about my client... who is onto something very dangerous. Let me tell you again. If you don't protect me-- His life was being threatened during the weapons deal. Our priority is to find out who his client was. We went to meet him right after the call. The big question is... how'd this client know we were meeting? Autopsy reports came out. From the first to the fourth cervical vertebrae... one bullet went through between the third and fourth... and the other penetrated between right and left atrium... which killed him instantly. The heart was completely destroyed. I've never seen anything like this before. Good-bye. Chodo Harbor, North Korea For the victory! For the victory! No more corrupt politicians! No more 50 years of separation, disgrace and humiliation! We're writing a new history of Korea! And the beginning of it is in your hands! Good luck. For the unification. For the unification. For the unification. For the unification. Team 4, go! Don't move! He left nothing related to his business. No wonder. They destroy everything that could be used against them. It's hard to find any connection between Lim and Hee. Then we're back to square one. People around Lim? Lim took care of business by himself. Nobody knows anything. Hee's been hiding out for over a year. I don't get it. A weapons dealer was her first target. It's too easy for her. Aren't we overreacting? Could it be a gang war imitating her? Nobody can imitate her. We need to find out what she wanted from him... and why he contacted us. What did Hee ask him for? What was the information Lim tried to give us? If she hasn't gotten what she wanted from him yet... she'll try to get it through other channels. We need to focus on the fact that North Korea's using her again... even though her identity has been exposed to us. You two are the best agents we've got. Finish her at your first opportunity. What do you think was their relationship? Why'd she approach him? I guess she needed something from him. That's it. That thing she asked him to get her. That's the key. What'd he mean by something dangerous? You look awfully serious. We're late, come on. I got delayed at the beauty parlor. Have you waited long? Not long. How do I look? We'd better hurry. Did you sleep well? Did I snore? I was worried about that. He always sleeps at the theater. You two are here. He isn't into anything. He doesn't even like to sing or listen to music. Really? I grew up near the airport 'cause my old man was a pilot. So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm. Nothing's music to my ears. Then, what do you like? I like looking for people. Lately I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend. What's she like? You want to take a look? She's cute. Why did you break up? So I can look for her. Gosh, I'm sorry. - No problem. - Wipe it off with this. Here. - I am really sorry. - It's okay. It's punishment for dozing off in the theater. Excuse me. - When is your wedding day? - 20th of next month. When are you gonna tell her? - You can't hide it forever. - I don't wanna burden her. What about her? What if you die on a mission? - I can't anyway. - Why not? You don't trust her? Let me ask you something. If Hee and I point a gun at each other... and you have to choose one, who would that be? Hee, of course. I'd save your ass 'cause I can bust her later. You don't get many chances. You don't get many friends you'd die for either. It's not too late, man. You can change your mind. Cheers. I'm all wet! Wait till that stain gets washed off. I've had it. Give me money for laundry. I'll pay for it when I do that again. - Aim well next time. - I'll try. - Where are all the taxis? - Let's take the subway. - In this rain? - You're wet anyway. Come on, let's run! You sure? It's gonna rain all night long. I like it. I don't think they do. It's bedtime for them. Looks like the rain woke them up. - What are they saying? - They want us to keep quiet. - How are your Kissingurami? - They fight a lot. One minute, they hate each other... next minute, they're hugging, kissing and stuff. They're always like that. When I go out, I get worried about them. If I am not there, you have to take care of them. I don't think I can. I can't even handle "Kissing" and "Anabus" at home. That's why you have to learn more. To live with them, you have no choice. Your sweater is almost done. I hope it looks good on you. What should I get you for the wedding? All I want is... whatever happens to me... you love and never leave me. That's all. Because you're the only one who truly understands me. Shiri, step one, on! Kim? He looks most suspicious on the transaction record. - Who's he? - National Defense lab researcher. As a part of a new weapons system being developed... Kim speaking. Yes. Okay. we launched the CTX project last year. If Kim was doing business with the weapons dealer... chances are very high that it was CTX. Tell me more about the CTX. CTX is a new type of energy... originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab. We've been working on turning it into a weapon. At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions... but the test we did last month was successful. People at your agency know about this too. It'll bring a sensational change to the military's weapons systems. How's it different from the conventional bombs? It's a liquid bomb. What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color... and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices. Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than... any other bombs you've ever seen. What if a black-market dealer got it? He could get the information on it, but not the CTX itself... because you need three or four approvals to release it. If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over... he would've returned the money. Where's it made and kept? That's confidential. Sorry. But CTX has never been released until today. How are you so sure? When CTX is released... it goes through three authorization checkpoints... and this morning everything was in order. You're saying it was released this morning? For the weapon show tomorrow... it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak. Sera Mike 1, stop at Dongsan service area. Will Hee turn up? She wants the CTX. She wouldn't miss this chance. Why are they bothering us? They want two secret agents to ride with us. What for? What the hell is that? Sir, we need to check the vehicles. I wasn't informed of this. What's going on? We got a report of a possible interception of CTX. Your permit and I.D., please. The CTX is safe with us. Get out of the way. Didn't you hear me? I asked for your permit and I.D., didn't I? This is Sera Mike 1, we're stopped at a checkpoint. I don't have time for this. I'll fax it to you. If you resist, we'll have to arrest you. What did you say? We'll have to arrest you... or kill you. - Are you nuts? - I'm fine. Are you out of your mind? You fucking moron! Are you fucking nuts? Wait, look at this. What base are you from? Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea! Sera Mike 1, do you copy? They've been hit! It's worse than we thought! It's a bomb! Run! Hee asked Lim for the CTX... and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over. But when they realized it couldn't be done... they planned to intercept it on the road. In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered... along with 20 of our armed guards. How much CTX was taken? About a gallon. It is enough to blow up an entire city. Any leads on the interceptors? Not yet, sir. Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee. But why would North Korea do that... in a time of reconciliation? We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle... but the gunfire at the scene makes me think... that they're highly trained North Korean militants. Their military system is falling fast. It could be a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose. The question is, what are they planning to do with the CTX? If it blows up in Seoul, we're finished. We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX. As you all know, it may explode without the detonator. And no devices can detect the liquid itself. If they utilize those traits, expect the worst. There's no way to predict when, where or how it's gonna go off. - Dinner? - I don't feel like it. Is the meeting over? - Little while ago. Anything special? Ready to order? - Hi. - Hi. - Beer, please. - Okay. What about the scene? An inspection ofthe scene was delayed and the bodies were just taken to the headquarters. The film will be handed over tomorrow. Any leads? Just bodies and shells. Isn't it strange? Anything else? This is the third time.Lim, Kim. This time CTX was intercepted. We went to see Lim right after the call... and to the lab right after we got the report. We're always a step behind. It's like they were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Don't jump to conclusions.Today we went to the lab without notice. Kim didn't even know that we were coming... and he got killed five minutes before we got there. If that's the case, it's obvious. Only Director Ko and I knew about those killings and the CTX. And you made the report. Shiri 1's on line. It's been a long time. - How's my family? - They're fine. I miss them. Completion is near. You'll meet them soon. A barrier is in the way. Get rid ofit. Target? Kissingurami. Finish the job before the completion. Acknowledged. For the unification. For the unification. We're always a step behind. They were reading our moves. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. - Hello? - It's me, Ho. - Can I see you tomorrow? -Sure. What's going on? I have a favor to ask. Call me at the police agency tomorrow. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. I'll call you. What are you doing there? You scared me! - You just got here? - No, earlier. I cleaned and did the laundry. Nothing was in the refrigerator. so I went grocery shopping. What's wrong? You don't look so good. Just busy at work. Why didn't you call? I was gonna leave soon. Dinner? Not yet. I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. - What are we having? - Your favorite. - You wanna take a shower? - After dinner. - I think it's done. - Let it simmer. Can you hand me the clothes pins and hangers from the sofa? - I couldn't find the pins. - It's okay. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed upyet. - Let me help you pack up. - Okay. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up by yourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me, that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me. I'll never drink again. Because I have you. The soccer team of South and North Korea returned today... to the Seoul Training Center after training in Pohang... with North Korean officials coming through "Panmunjum." The North Korea President Lee and officials... coming to the south for the game and a conference... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color. You can't tell the difference from water with the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight... over 6,000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction. But without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. If you expose it to both light and heat... nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200 cc, so everything within the radius of one kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction... the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, if the sphere becomes red... it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops... it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years.You're an oddball. I am not, sir. - Admit it. - No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fishbowls. Agent Ryu, come to room 17. I gotta go. Find the CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognize him? Don't you remember, Ryu? His name is Park.A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked... he was the only one that escaped from the plane. A painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park. All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th Special Forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from National Defense. - Agent Yoon! - Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th Special Forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th Special Forces intercepted the CTX. Why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table... for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for... they say they want peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. If they wanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of Korea would be much easier. Why would they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb? That's difficult to answer. Hee is the key to all this. We don't have time. We'll find a way. What do you see? Can't even tell me? Maybe the solution is much closer than we think. - What do you mean? - Hee could be close by. Hey, you! - What the hell are you doing here? - I am looking for the men's room. Are you fucking blind? Didn't see the sign "Restricted Area"? Hey, you hear me? I sure did. Watch your mouth. - How have you been? - Bored to death. I feel more insecure when it's so quiet. I need some backup. What about your agency? - The air isn't very clear there. - What do you mean? I think there's a leak. This is the only way. - It must be very stressful. - It'll get better. - When do you need it? - Tomorrow. - I'm coming too. - Sorry, no married men. - Time and place? - I'll call you. All right, then. Ho! We'll talk later. How's your friend? He'll live. - I am glad to hear that. Have a seat. Who else knew you two were meeting? It was very personal. I didn't tell anybody. Lim, Kim, Ho. Hee is very nearby. There must be a leak. Nobody knows that for sure. Internal Affairs is on it. You don't trust your men? Do you trust me? Traps could be anywhere. Maybe there's a hole in the security system... but that possibility is almost zero. Don't share the information with anybody. Not even with your partner, Lee. Traps under your feet are hard to see. I'm the director in charge. I'm Park of the 8th Special Forces. I want to talk to my old friend. Thanks for calling me, friend. I was gonna send you a coffin, but you were lucky. Disappointed with Hee's shooting? Save it. We can take you out anytime. Maybe I'll take you out first. So, you've become a man.You know where I am? Young drunk kids here yelling on the street... while people in the north are starving to death. Listen, friend. We have ten CTXs placed all over Seoul. I'll call you 30 minutes before each of them goes off. You'd better find them before people get hurt. What do you want? Slow down, friend.The first one is on the roof of the Golden Tower. You have exactly 30 minutes. You know the fish named "shiri"? It's a Korean aboriginal fish, living in crystal streams. Though they're separated with the country divided... someday they'll reunite in the same streams. Should I buy some for your girlfriend's fish shop? Why not? Stay alive until then. He's on the move. Clear! Found it! Hyun? Don't tell anybody you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear people of the South,to day marks an important and joyous moment in our history. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissention... and to open up a new era of understanding. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and he wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center. I'm on my way. Be there. He's wearing a black jacket and a black cap. Anything else? - That's all. I'll be right there. You look good in a black jacket. Anyone else coming? Hee, maybe. So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tap the phones. So, if they show up... I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a five-shot semiautomatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. Three targets went inside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! - Been a long time. - Good to see you. Payback time for flight 257. You killed seven of my men. You left your men behind. 'Cause I have a job to finish. You wanna know what it is? It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! Get back! She used only two bullets. In both cases,you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island. Why'd you come here? They ambushed us. OP set a trap. Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. Thanks to you... we lost two of our men! I did what I could do. Yeah, you saved my life. What do you want? You've changed. Of course I have... from Hee to Hyun. Not only in appearance, but inside as well! I don't need a betrayer. We've waited ten years for this moment. In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance... and buried our youth in the tomb of history. If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings finish it here. I was stupid..thinking I could be Hyun. But I am just Hee who has to kill her man I failed to change my inside. Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking... because her immune system has dropped. There she is, with the yellow sweater. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Are you from the public health center? I am looking for this girl. Anything happen to her? She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house two years ago... and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me... as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me from Japan, but... I think she misplaced my number. Otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left, I cried my eyes out. She hugged me and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know what she was sorry about. Prepare ten million dollars... and a 747 Jumbo at the airport by 2:00. No mistakes. The Golden Tower was just the beginning. I hope I don't have to use the other nine CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies into the bowl. Two of them died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies anymore. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsy is needed-- If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North... will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main stadium at 2:00 p.m today. With the presidents of two nations present-- Hi. I'm here to collect for the newspaper. - How much? - Seven dollars. It's all right. Bye. What are you doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had four goldfish on my desk... I had four goldfish on my desk... and two of them died today. At first I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong. "SU300" inside their bodies... is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here... and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997... when Hee disappeared, you were in Japan. You didn't need a fake passport coming back in... because you became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy... Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me ask you this. Did you really love him? Over here! I planted a bug in your car. Will you forgive me? Stay with me! The ambulance is on the way! I messed up. You're going to be okay. You've always been the best! This won't kill me. - Stay with me! The 747's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from terminal two. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want ten million dollars. - They were bluffing. - Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium! Go back to headquarters. Don't worry about the stadium. Not even a drop of water can pass through security. - It won't work. Listen to me! You lost your partner today. Go back. It's an order! I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule. Sorry. Your attention, please. No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thank you for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. But what the hell am I doing here watching the gate? How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim and Lee... have just arrived! Let's give them a big hand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. Turn the lights on? Who's in charge of the lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Why would anybody do that in broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Did you turn the lights on in section 3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regular day, you know. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn off the lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 011-244-1616. Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can't you hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you say were the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! Sometimes history needs craziness to help it. What do you want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are not your barriers. When we're done here our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights offnow! That's not what the people of this land want. They don't want another war to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country? I remember very well. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians... but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it." When you sing this song our people in the North are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters are being sold off... for fucking 100 dollars! Have you ever seen parents eating... the flesh of their dead kids? With cheese, Coke and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. A soccer game to unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years ofdeception. We're opening up.. a new history of Korea. The CTX will detonate soon. History will judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years... came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights off in section 3-G? Turn them off! . Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell. You know where Hee is? She's in the audience laughing at you. You know where Hee is? She's in the audience,laughing at you. Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the president! Gate 52, he's on his way to the parking lot. A National Defense spokesman revealed a war scenario attempted by... North Korea's 8th Special Forces. They sent five secret agents, including Park, into South Korea-- Things about oddballs! One. Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning like you don't. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? March, last year. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn't you ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fishbowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a whole year? What do you want me to say? Answer the question. We don't trust anybody... not even the fellow agents you share life with. But she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a goddess with six heads in Greek mythology. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra of our times-- The reality ofa separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pager Voice Mail. You have one new message. Ryu,it's me, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTX is planted in the lights over the Royal Box. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor. I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... is all of my life. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu... I miss you so much. I miss you. How have you been? It's you again. Did you meet her? No. It would have been nicer if you came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. If one of them dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised.She knew everything about fish. In fact she stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating... you have to be alert. She's so bad with chopsticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. A Kang Jegyu Film Han Suckyu Choi Minsik Song Kangho Kim Yunjin Directed by Kang Jegyu SHIRI October 1992 Somewhere in North Korea T16, clear! T19, clear! Name: Hee Secret Agent, 8th Special Forces North Korea. Born in 1971 Speciality: Sniper Classification: Confidential OP Agents in charge: Ryu, Lee The list of cases June 1993 - Kim Nuclear-Physics Doctor November 1994 - Cho Nat'I Defense Director July 1993 Gas explosion in Seoul January 1995 - Yoe Strategist at Nat'l Security May 1996 - Kim Staff at Nuclear Submarine TF October 1996 Inchon Port, South Korea U2 U2 Do you copy, U2? U2.... Do you read me? ! It's already been 6 months since Hee went into hiding. Maybe she was taken back due to the risk of exposure. Hi! Hi! I dreamt about U2 last night. He said he'd busted Hee. Goodbye.... You know this song? I don't like music. You know that, don't you? September 1998 Seoul May I help you? I was having a little chat with my buddies. About what? Love. And? They say love's to stay together until the last moment. They know the pain of separation. I bet they do, seeing each other sold off. Have you ever seen fishes cry? How do they cry? Cry in the water, then you'll know how. You're about the same size... as my boyfriend. Have you ever seen fishes laugh? No. It's already been a year. It was raining then, too. You came back the next day to buy a fish bowl with a CD for me. I said, "May I help you..." "Anapus" Yeah, you said "Anapus" instead of "Anabus". "Bus!" A total stranger gave me a CD I really liked. It was coincidental, but you felt so close as if I'd known you for a long time. Did you go to the Alcohol Cessation Class today? The doctor said that I no longer had to come. Take a guess. Ki... Ki... You're unbelievable! They're 'Kissingurami.' Kissingurami... If one of them dies, the other dies, too. They dry up from malnutrition or their scales fall off. Don't let them die. Feed them once a day and change the water... Every 5 days. They don't survive where it's dark and cold. Keep the lights on all the time. I might do the same thing if you left me alone. Kissingurami. Breaking news. Under the slogan of "Reunification of two Koreas," A team of North and South for the World Cup 2002 was launched earlier today. A friendly game will be held on the 25th not only to pick players for the team but to mark a turning point in history where the two leaders of South and North Korea get together. The president of Korea Football Organization said the game would speed up the reconciliation of the two Koreas. Yes? We were supposed to meet. Change of plans. The 3rd floor, electronics. What happened? Not clear yet. Any barrier? Around the third block. Take the outside! Calm down. I'm a secret agent. Dead end on 4th street. Against the wall! Why did you run? She was there. She knew about our rendezvous. Who? Where? He's down! It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Please don't put ashes into the fish bowl. My goldfish smokes, too. Dr. Min, Identified It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Hey, oddball! Lim was the head of black-market weapons dealers. We knew nothing about his organization. When'd he call you? Right before I called you. The perpetrator was there at the same time. Considering the fact that he was hit at the scene he wasn't being followed. Otherwise, he would've been killed before the rendezvous. My life is on the line. I'll tell you the details later but it's about my client who is onto something very dangerous. Let me tell you again. If you don't protect me.... His life was being threatened during the weapons deal. Our priority is to find out who his client was. We went to meet him right after the call. The big question is how'd this client know we were meeting? Autopsy reports came out. What's up? It's Wednesday. Get the smell off the bowl. Don't put cookies into it, then. You can't feed the fish the same thing all the time. From the 1st to 4th cervical vertebrae one bullet went through between the 3rd and 4th and the other penetrated between right and left atrium which killed him instantly. The heart was completely destroyed. I've never seen anything like this before. The former coroner has. Dr. Kim, Director Cho. They're all the same. She's at it again. Goodbye.... Chodo Harbour, North Korea For the Victory! For the Victory! No more corrupt politicians! No more 50 years of separation, disgrace, and humiliation! We're writing a new history of Korea! And the beginning of it is in your hands! I expect to see you all again under a unified sky. Good luck. For the unification. For the unification. Team 4, go! Don't move! Hand's up! He left nothing related to his business. No wonder. They destroy everything that could be used against them. It's hard to find any connection between Lim and Hee. Then, we're back to square one. People around Lim? Lim took care of the business by himself. Nobody knows anything. Hee's been hiding out for over a year. I don't get it. A weapon's dealer was her first target. It's too easy for her. Aren't we overreacting? Could it be a gang war imitating her? Nobody can imitate her. We need to find out what she wanted from him and why he contacted us. What did Hee ask him for? What was the information Lim tried to give us? If she hasn't gotten what she wanted from him yet she'll try to get it through other channels. We need to focus on the fact that North Korea's using her again even though her identity has been exposed to us. You two are the best agents we've got. Finish her at your first priority. What do you think was their relationship? Why'd she approach him? I guess she needed something from him. That's it. That thing she asked him to get her. That's the key. What'd he mean by something dangerous? You look awfully serious. We're late, come on. I got delayed at the beauty parlor. Have you waited long? Not long. How do I look? We'd better hurry. Did you sleep well? Did I snore? I was worried about that. Were you tired? He always sleeps at the theater. I wish you had somebody for times like these. You two are here. He isn't into anything. He doesn't even like to sing or listen to the music. Really? I grew up near the airport cause my old man was a pilot. So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm. Nothing's music to my ears. Then, what do you like? I like looking for people. Lately I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend. What's she like? You want to take a look ? She's cute. Why did you break up? So I can look for her. Gosh, I'm sorry! No problem. Wipe it off with this. Here... I am really sorry. It's OK. It's punishment for dozing off in the theater. Excuse me. When is your wedding day? 20th of next month. When are you gonna tell her? You can't hide it forever. I don't wanna burden her. What if you die on a mission? What about her? I can't, anyway. Why not? You don't trust her? Don't be sentimental. Let me ask you something. If Hee and I point a gun at each other and you have to choose one. Who would that be? Hee, of course. I'd save your ass cause I can bust her later. You don't get many chances. You don't get many friends you'd die for, either. It's not too late, man. You can change your mind. Cheers. I'm all wet! Wait till that stain gets washed off. I've had it. Give me money for laundry. Ask her. I'll pay for it when I do that again. Aim well next time. I'll try. Where are all the taxis? Let's take a subway. In this rain? You're wet anyway. I don't have a girl to take care of me if I catch a cold. Come on, let's run! You sure? It's gonna rain all night long. I like it. I don't think they do. It's bedtime for them. Looks like the rain woke them up. What are they saying? They want us to keep quiet. How are your Kissingurami? They fight a lot. One minute, they hate each other next minute they're hugging, kissing and stuff. They're always like that. When I go out, I get worried about them. If I am not there, you have to take care of them. I don't think I can. I can't even handle 'Kissing' and 'Anabus' at home That's why you have to learn more. To live with them, you have no choice. Your sweater is almost done. I hope it looks good on you. What should I get you for the wedding? All I want is whatever happens to me, you love and never leave me. That's all. Because you're the only one who truly understands me. shiri Step 1 On! On the 17th, 1 million dollars were transferred from Lim's account into Kim's. Kim? He looks most suspicious on the transaction record. Who's he? Nat'l Defense lab researcher. Kim speaking. Yes. Okay. As a part of new weapons system being developed we launched the CTX project last year. If Kim was doing business with the weapon's dealer chances are very high that it was CTX. Tell me more about the CTX. CTX is a new type of energy originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab we've been working on turning it into a weapon. At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions but the test we did last month was successful. People at your agency know about this, too. It'll bring a sensational change to the military weapon system. How's it different from the conventional bombs? It's a liquid bomb. What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices. Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than any other bombs you've ever seen. What if a black-market dealer got it? He could get the information on it but not the CTX itself. Because you need 3 or 4 approvals to release it. If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over he would've returned the money. Where's it made and kept? That's confidential, sorry. But CTX's never been released until today. How are you so sure? When CTX is released it goes through 3 authorization checkpoints and this morning everything was in order. You're saying it was released this morning? For the weapon show tomorrow, it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak. Sera Mike 1, stop at Dongsan service area. Will Hee turn up? She wants the CTX. She wouldn't miss this chance. Why are they bothering us? They want two secret agents to ride with us. What for? What the hell is that? Sir, We need to check the vehicles. I wasn't informed of this. What's going on? We got a report of a possible interception of CTX. Your permit and ID, please. CTX's safe with us. Get out of the way. Didn't you hear me? I asked for your permit and ID, didn't I? This is Sera Mike 1, we're stopped at a checkpoint. I don't have time for this. I'll fax it to you. If you resist, we'll have to arrest you. What did you say? We'll have to arrest you... or kill you. Are you nuts? I'm fine. Are you out of your mind? You fucking moron! Are you fucking nuts? Wait, look at this. What base are you from? Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea! Sera Mike 1, Do you copy? They've been hit! It's worse than we thought! It's a bomb, run! Hee asked Lim for the CTX and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over. But when they realized it couldn't be done they planned to intercept it on the road. In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered, along with 20 of our armed guards. How much CTX was taken? About a gallon. It is enough to blow up an entire city. Any leads on the interceptors? Not yet, sir. Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee. But why would North Korea do that in a time of reconciliation? We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle but the gunfire at the scene makes me think that they're highly-trained North Korean militants. Their military system is falling fast. We can't rule out the possibility that they were a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose. The question is what are they planning to do with the CTX. If it blows up in Seoul, we're finished. Why not make an official statement to the North-Korean government? Not until we have solid proof. We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX. As you all know, it may explode without the detonator. And no devices can detect the liquid itself. If they utilize those traits, expect the worst. There's no way to predict when, where, or how it's gonna go off. Dinner? I don't feel like it. Is the meeting over? Little while ago. Anything special? Ready to order? Hi! Hi! Beer, please. OK. What about the scene? An inspection of the scene was delayed and the bodies were just taken to headquarters. The film will be handed over tomorrow. Any leads? Just bodies and shells. Isn't it strange? Anything else? This is the third time. Lim, Kim.. This time CTX was intercepted. We went to see Lim right after the call... .. and to the lab right after we got the report. We're always a step behind. It's like they were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Don't jump to the conclusion. Today we went to the lab without notice. Kim didn't even know that we were coming and he got killed 5 minutes before we got there. If that's the case... it's obvious. Only director Ko and I knew about those killings and CTX. And you made the report. shiri 1's entered. It's been a long time. At 09:00. With sunglasses on. You've changed a lot. It's been six years. How's my family? They're fine. I miss them. Completion is near. You'll meet them soon. A barrier is in the way. Get rid of it. Target? Kissingurami. Finish the job before the completion. Acknowledged. For the unification. For the unification. We're always a step behind. They were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Hello? It's me, Ho. Can I see you tomorrow? Sure, what's going on? I have a favor to ask. Call me at the Police Agency tomorrow. OK. See you tomorrow. I'll call you. What are you doing there? You scared me! You just got here? No, earlier. I cleaned and did the laundry. Nothing was in the refrigerator. We ran out of coffee so I went grocery shopping. What's wrong? You don't look so good. Just busy at work. Why didn't you call? I was gonna leave soon. Dinner? Not yet. I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. What are we having? Your favorite. You wanna take a shower? After dinner. I think it's done. Let it simmer. Can you hand me the cloth pins and hangers from the sofa? I couldn't find the pins. It's OK. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed up yet. Let me help you pack up. OK. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up by yourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me. I'll never drink again because I have you. A soccer team of South and North Korea returned today to the Seoul Training Center after training in Pohang with North Korean officials coming through 'Panmunjum'. The North Korean President Lee and officials will deliver a message on a permanent peace.... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color you can't tell the difference from water with the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight over 6000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction but without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. If you expose it to both light and heat nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200cc, so everything within the radius of 1 kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, if the sphere becomes red it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops, it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years. You're an oddball. I am not, sir. Admit it! No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fish bowls. Agent Ryu, come to room 17. I gotta go. Find CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognizes him? Don't you remember, Ryu? His name is Park. A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked he was the only one that escaped from the plane a painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park... All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th special forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from Nat'l Defense. Agent Yoon! Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th special forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th special forces intercepted CTX, why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for they say they want peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. If they wanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of Korea'd be much easier. Why'd they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb? That's difficult to answer. Hee is key to all this. We don't have time. We'll find a way. What do you see? Can't even tell me? Maybe the solution is much closer than we think. What do you mean? Hee could be close by. Hey, you! What the hell are you doing here? I am looking for the man's room. Are you fucking blind? Didn't see the sign "RESTRICTED AREA"? Hey, you hear me? I sure did. Watch your mouth. Take care. How have you been? Bored to death. I feel more insecure when it's so quiet. I need some backup. What about your agency? The air isn't very clear there. What do you mean? I think there's a leak. This is the only way. It must be very stressful. It'll get better. When do you need it? Tomorrow. I'm coming, too. Sorry, no married man. Time and place? I'll call you. All right, then. Ho! We'll talk later. How's your friend? He'll live. I am glad to hear that. Have a seat. Who else knew you two were meeting? It was very personal. I didn't tell anybody. Lim, Kim, Ho.... Hee is very nearby. There must be a leak. Nobody knows that for sure. Internal affairs are on it. You don't trust your men? Do you trust me? Traps could be anywhere. Maybe there's a hole in the security system but that possibility is almost zero. Don't share the information with anybody. Not even with your partner, Lee. Traps under your feet are hard to see. I'm the Director in charge. I'm Park, of the 8th special forces. I want to talk to my old friend. Thanks for calling me friend. I was gonna send you a coffin, but you were lucky. Disappointed with Hee's shooting. Save it. We can take you out anytime. Maybe I'll take you out first. So, you've become a man. You know where I am? Young drunk kids here yelling on the street.... While people in the north are starving to death. People here have wastes building up in their bellies. What an unfair world. Listen, friend. We have 10 CTXs placed all over Seoul. I'll call you 30 minutes before each of them goes off. You'd better find them before people get hurt. What do you want? Slow down, friend. The first one is on the roof of the Golden Tower. You have exactly 30 minutes. You know the fish named shiri? It's a Korean aboriginal fish, living in crystal streams. Though they're separated with the country divided some day they'll reunite in the same streams. Should I buy some for your girlfriend's fish shop? Why not. Stay alive until then. He's on the move. Clear! Found it! Hyun? Don't tell anybody you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear People of the South Today marks an important and joyous moment in our history. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissension and to open up a new era of understanding. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center I'm on my way. Be there. On my way. He's wearing a black jacket and a black cap. Anything else? That's all. I'll be right there. You look good in a black jacket. Anyone else coming? Hee, maybe. So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tape the phones. So, if they show up I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a 5-shot semiautomatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. 3 targets went inside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! Been a long time. Good to see you. Payback time for the flight 257. Look who's talking. You killed 7 of my men. You left your men behind. Cause I have a job to finish. You wanna know what it is? I'll ask Hee. It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! Get back! 'She used only two bullets.' 'In both cases, you were in her range.' 'lf I were her...' '... I would have used the other three bullets.' Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital. Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island. Why'd you come here? They ambushed us. OP set a trap. Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. Thanks to you, we lost two of our men! I did what I could do. Yeah, you saved my life. What do you want? You've changed. Of course I have... from Hee to Hyun. Not only in appearance, but inside as well! I don't need a betrayer. We've waited 10 years for this moment. In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance and buried our youth in the tomb of history. If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings finish it here. I was stupid... thinking I could be Hyun. But I am just Hee who has to kill her man. I failed to change my inside. Let go! We have a job to finish. Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking because her immune system has dropped and make it quick. There she is. with the yellow sweater. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Are you from the public health center? I am looking for this girl. Anything happened to her? She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house 2 years ago and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me from Japan but I think she misplaced my number otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left I cried my eyes out. She hugged me, and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know what she was sorry about... She didn't do anyting to me Prepare 10 million dollars and a 7 47 Jumbo at the airport by 2 o'clock. No mistakes. The Golden Tower was just the beginning. I hope I don't have to use the other 9 CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies into the bowl. Two of them died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies any more. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsy is needed.... If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main Stadium at 2 P.M today. With the Presidents of two nations present... Hi, I'm here to collect for the newspaper. How much? 7 dollars. It's all right. Bye. What are you doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had 4 goldfishes on my desk with 4 goldfishes, and 2 of them died today. At first, I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong 'SU300' inside their bodies is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997 When Hee disappeared, you were in Japan. You didn't need a fake passport coming back in because you became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy, Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me ask you this. Did you really love him? Over here! I planted a bug in your car... Will you.... forgive me? Stay with me! The ambulance is on the way! I.... messed up. You're going to be Okay. You've always been the best! This won't.... kill me.... This won't.... Stay with me! The 7 47's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from the terminal 2. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want 10 million dollars. They were bluffing. Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a it's not. -Either way, we're finished. We're done. -No. Not here. When do we stop? Over the next hill? Or the next? Scour the whole country? No. No. It ends here. There are other Lorenzos not too far away from here. It's not the ending you want, is it? This isn't just a clever story -with a clever ending. -Stop it, Charlie. -It's our life. It's my Gran's life. -It's not about... Charlie, it's not about a story. No, no, no, she's already lost the man once. How many more times would you have her lose him? You know what? I don't expect you to understand any of this because you don't know a thing about real loss. Yeah. You're wrong. Sophie's mother ran away from her when she was a Iittle girl. It's different, Gran. It's different. You're right. But Sophie's mother chose to leave her. And you always knew your mum and dad loved you. Come in. Hi. Oh, dear. I just wanted to see if you were all right. I'm okay. claire, I'm so sorry if I caused you... No. Every minute has been so special. Darling. May I? One of the great joys in life is having one's hair brushed. CLAIRE: Charlie, say you're sorry. In the eye, Charlie. With contrition. Sophie... -Thank you. -... I'm afraid I... In the eye. Yes, Gran, I'm not 1 2. Prove it. I'm sincerely sorry, Sophie. It won't happen again. Excellent. CLAIRE: Sophie, -I want to make a toast. -Thank you. I want to thank you for the wonderful thing you did for a complete stranger. I'II never forget it. Nor I. I've had the most incredible few days. I really have, and I can't thank you enough for letting me tag along. I think you did more than tag along. Here is to all our loved ones, wherever they may be. May I join you? please. I am sorry, Sophie. I used to lay out under the stars as a kid, in the summertime. "Doubt thou the stars are fire "Doubt that the sun doth move" CHARLIE: "Doubt truth be a liar "But never doubt I Iove" Do you think he's out there? Lorenzo? Yeah. He's somewhere. And am I wrong? To insist she quit? No, you know, you can't go on forever. At some point, you have to stop. Then why is it that I feel like a schoolboy on Sunday? It's nearly tomorrow and I don't want to go. Me, either. And I always liked school. -Morning. -Morning. Thank you. How'd you sleep? I slept fine. How about you? Yes. Great. Thanks. CHARLIE: Good morning. CLAIRE: Good morning. -How are you? -Good morning, my darling. It's a beautiful day. Sophie, would you mind going in the front? Because I'd love to stretch my legs for a bit. Okay. Fantastic, darling. CLAIRE: The stars were spectacular from my window. Look. That vineyard. That's our favorite wine. Let's turn in there and have a goodbye toast. Okay. Charlie, stop! CHARLIE: Nana, what is it? It's Lorenzo. Who? The boy? AII right, Nana. Let's get you in the shade. Shall we? I am Lorenzo Bartolini. Sophie. I think this is... -Do you know a Lorenzo Bartolini? -I asked him and... -I am Lorenzo Bartolini. -You are! Oh, my... Sophie, he's the grandson! -Can I help you? -Yes. We're looking for a Lorenzo Bartolini. I am Lorenzo Bartolini. -He's Lorenzo, too. -Do you have a father also named Lorenzo? Yes, he went out riding. But what can I do for you? I'm sorry. We're being terribly rude. -I'm Charlie Wyman. -I'm Sophie. Lorenzo. Lorenzo. We have been on quite a journey for your father. You see, my grandmother, claire, knows him. Charlie. Charlie, Iet's go! Let's go! AII right. Nana, Nana, Nana, Lorenzo is here. He's out riding, but he's going to be back any minute. Well, then, Iet's go before he comes back. Nana, we've come all this way. -Come on. -I've been ridiculous. I've been completely ridiculous. He knew me when I was 15 years old, a girl. That girl's gone. Oh, my God. claire? Yes. So many years. Yes, 50. If you allow me. I really don't know how to express myself. Well, I went for a ride this morning as an old man, and I came back as a teenager again. I'm so very happy you all meet claire and her grandson, Charlie, and their lovely friend, Sophie. My dear claire, you have told me you lost your Jack. -And you know I lost my Rosa. -Yeah. But destiny wanted us to meet again. CLAIRE: Health to the Bartolini family. CHARLIE: To the Bartolinis. I'm sorry I was late. No. When we are speaking about love, it's never too late. Well, bad luck, eh? AII hope lost and he rides in at the Iast moment on a white horse. No one will believe it. Promise me... Promise me you'II finish the story. I guess this is it. And I'm sorry it is. Yeah, me, too. Sophie, I... I never should've kissed you. I was completely out of bounds. Mmm. You're engaged and... It's time to go. Goodbye, Charlie. I'II miss you. Hi. It is time to... I must get back to Victor. Sorry. Yes. Of course. So, where's Charlie? We'II give you a drive there straight away. No, I'm... claire, I can't take you away from this place, so... My son can drive you. -Just a moment. -Yes. Grazie. I'm so happy for you. Is something wrong? No! No. No. It's just, you know... And you're leaving? An angel brought you to me. Thank you. Thank you. I'II be eternally grateful. Thank you. It's very kind. Thank you. Thank you so much. -You're always welcome here. -Thank you. -Thank you, Lorenzo. -Ciao. Speak soon. Bye. Darling, you're family, so I think you'II understand why I'm telling you you're a total idiot. Okay, okay, then don't sugarcoat it, Gran. I won't. How many Sophies do you think there are on this planet? Don't wait 50 years like I did. Go. Go! Go! I missed you so much! So much. ...in person because I couldn't send you an e-mail, because it was... It just didn't make sense, because I know you were having... One second. Hello? Hey. Yeah, yeah. We just have to sort out all the deliveries that we need to make. I mean... What happened? You don't like the ending? No, the ending's fine. It's actually quite moving. But what happened to the people? I mean, are they still together? What about... What about the kid? What about Charlie? Where's he? I don't know. I didn't keep in touch. Do you have any advice? I think you should buy stock in AIitalia, 'cause all the ladies are gonna be flocking to Verona. Are you gonna publish this? Yeah, I'm gonna publish it. It's a good story.

I just want to say thank you on behalf of myself and my lovely wife, Ia mia bella claire! And now it's your turn. -Well... -Go on. Dear friends, 50 years ago, I went to Juliet's house in Verona. I wrote her a letter and I asked her a question. And two months ago, I received a reply. And without that letter, none of us would be here today. Sophie, would you mind if I read out the words you wrote to me? AII right? "Dear claire, 'what' and 'if' "are two words as non-threatening as words can be. "But put them together, side by side, "and they have the power to haunt you for the rest of your life. "What if? "What if? "What if? "I don't know how your story ended, "but if what you felt then was true love "then it's never too late. "If it was true then, why wouldn't it be true now? "You need only the courage "to follow your heart. "I don't know what a love like Juliet's feels like, "a love to leave loved ones for, a love to cross oceans for, "but I'd Iike to believe, if I ever were to feel it, "that I'd have the courage to seize it. "And, claire, if you didn't, "I hope one day that you will. "AII my love, "Juliet" I'II be right back, all right, Gran? Sophie? Sophie? Sophie? Of course! -A balcony. -Well. What are you doing up there? I'm gonna go. Why? Because this is really painful. I should have realized sooner, but I didn't, or I guess maybe I couldn't, but Victor and I aren't together anymore. -And I guess I came back hoping that... -Wait, wait. You're not engaged? No. But it's too late. It's clearly too late. And it really doesn't matter anymore because, honestly, I Iove you. I can't believe I just said that. But I do, I Iove you. It doesn't... I mean, it shouldn't matter to you, -because you're here with Patricia. -Patricia? And you should be back with her right now. Patricia is my cousin. She's my cousin. -How is that legal? -No... Sophie... No. No, no, no. Let me explain! Sophie, I'm so stupid. There's two Patricias. There's my cousin, who's here, and the one that I've completely forgotten about. More importantly, there's only one Sophie. Now, would you please come down? Wait, Charlie. Charlie, stop. What are you doing? Charlie, what are you doing? Listen to me. Listen to me very, very carefully. I Iive in London, a gorgeous, vibrant, historic city that I happen to love living in. You live in New York, which is highly overrated. -Pardon me? - But since the Atlantic Ocean is a bit wide to cross every day, swimming, boating or flying, I suggest we flip for it. What are you saying? And if those terms are unacceptable, leaving London will be a pleasure, as long as you're waiting for me on the other side. 'Cause the truth is, Sophie, I am madly, deeply, truly, passionately in love with you. You are? I am. -Are you gonna kiss me? -Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God! Charlie! I can't believe I just did that. Hi. Are you okay? please tell me no one saw that. Nobody saw it. Good. That's good. Can you move? Only my lips.

And may I ask why don't you wear an engagement ring? Yeah, see, that's... That's me. I insisted. He was so busy, you know, this whole restaurant and everything. And I guess I felt it unnecessary. Still, a girl should have a ring. SOPHIE: "I didn't go to him, Juliet. "I didn't go to Lorenzo. "His eyes were so full of trust. "I promised I'd meet him to run away together "because my parents don't approve. "But instead, I Left him waiting for me, below our tree, "waiting and wondering where I was. "I'm in Verona now. "I return to London in the morning, and I'm so afraid. "Please, Juliet, tell me what I should do. "My heart is breaking, and I have no one else to turn to. "Love, Claire." And it's been there for all those years? I think she came back to find her one true Love. And they had 10 children and still make passionate Love every night. Except he got bald and fat and she has to do all the work. -Francesca. -Francesca. And maybe she stayed in London and married a duke and lived happily ever after, just Like me. -But you married an accountant, not a duke. -Nobody's perfect. And I bet when she's making Love to that duke... -Yeah? -...she's imagining her first Love, Lorenzo. Isabella, I have to write back.

Sorry, sorry. -No, just real quick. I just... -Mmm-hmm? I had the most amazing day. I got to answer a Letter that was written 50 years ago. I know it might not get there, but it just feels so good to write. Yeah, I think you should spend more time with them. -Why? -Because it's your passion, right? And also because it fits perfectly. Because I just got off the phone with Signor Morini, and he's invited me to this amazing wine auction that's happening in Livorno. -In Livorno? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's super-exclusive. I mean, I don't know... I don't know if I can get a ticket, you know. I mean, I'II be off, Like, a day or two, max.

I feel terrible. I mean, it's... I miss you already, you know. -I'II be back very soon. Okay? -Yeah. Be careful. Bye! Ciao. FRANCESCA: Listen to what this poor girl writes. "Juliet, is there anything worse in this world than a man?" {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {ALL LAUGHING} {KNOCKING ON DOOR} Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you the Secretaries of Juliet? -Yes, that's us. -Great. May I ask, which one of you wrote this Letter to my grandmother, Claire Smith? I wrote that. And I can't believe that it found you. Yes. We Brits tend to stay in our family homes. Yeah. This is amazing. It's Less than a week since I mailed it. It was a very thoughtful Letter. Now, what were you thinking? I was thinking that she deserved an answer. Yeah, 50 years ago, maybe. Not now. I'm sorry. I didn't know true Love had an expiration date. True Love? Are you joking? Could you imagine what would've happened if she hadn't seen sense? Well, yeah, you wouldn't be here, and that would be an upside. What are you doing here anyway? What, are you some Lonely American girl who has to Live vicariously through others? I'm not Lonely. I am engaged. My condolences to the groom. Excuse me! So that's it? You've come all the way from London to give me a Lecture? No, I came because I couldn't Let my grandmother come on her own. Claire is here? Why? I think even you might be able to work that one out. Oh, my God! That's awesome! She's come to find her Lorenzo! Awesome? And if Lorenzo doesn't want to see her, has forgotten her, is gravely ill or dead, Let's say, just for fun, then what? Thought so. I want to meet her. I'd Like to meet Claire. And I want to play for Manchester United, but I'm shit at football. You don't think that she wants to meet me? I honestly think she has no interest meeting a woman that can manage to jam, "Oh, my God" and "awesome" into the same sentence. Gran, they're closing up. We should go now. Excuse me. Claire? Hi. Hi. My name is Sophie, and I wrote you the Letter. Letter? From Juliet? Goodness! Thank you. Thank you. But however did you find us? -Well, your grandson found me, actually. -You did? Right, well, the thing is, -I thought we should... -Yeah, well, he's very sweet and very charming, and he thought that you might Like to meet me. Uncharacteristically thoughtful of you, dear. Yes, well, under the circumstances, it seems a Little churlish not to meet the woman responsible -for this voyage of Lunacy. -Okay. Charlie doesn't approve, which makes this all the more fun. {WOMEN LAUGHING} We were just going for a glass of wine. Would you Like to join us? Absolutely not. -What? -Absolutely not. It's been a Long day. It's too Long a day. -Okay, darling. Have a good sleep. -But I... Do you know somewhere we could go? I actually have the perfect place. SOPHIE: I can't believe you're really here. I was taking an art course in Tuscany, staying with a family outside Siena, and they had a son Lorenzo, and it was Love at first sight. He had such gentle blue eyes. And he told me I was very beautiful. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {SPEAKING ITALIAN} And he gave me this ring. We wanted to get married, but I'd got exams back in England and my parents would never have agreed, and I got scared, and I ran away. Now what I really want is to tell him that I'm so sorry I was such a coward. Of course, a card or Letter is just too simple. So, you've come to find your Lorenzo? Yes, and I think I know where he is. Where? On the farm, just near Siena. Charlie's driving me down tomorrow. Only because I didn't want you to hitchhike. Well, he thinks it's a big mistake. Because you don't have a romantic bone in your body. No, no. It's because I am a realist. No. Because you are an Englishman! Cold as fish! Right. And who was it that wrote Romeo and Juliet? William Shakespearelli, a great Italian. They're mad. They're mad. {BELL TOLLING} CLAIRE: Sophie, my dear. Good night. Thank you so much. Thank you. Good night. Good night, everybody. -Good night. -Charlie, Let's go. -CHARLIE: Good night, Ladies. Ciao. -Good Luck. -Bye. -Ciao. How wonderful would it be if she found her Romeo? {BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN} Imagine if she did, 50 years Later, all because you found that Letter. Nobody would believe it if it weren't true, you know. {BOTH CHATTERING} Wait! Wait! -Oh, for... Here she comes. -Sorry. -May I come with you to find Lorenzo? -Come with us? What about this fiance of yours? You're in the city of Love and you want to come with us? Yes, I do. Because he's busy and I'm free. And I mean... -Of course, if it's not an intrusion. -No, no, it's not an intrusion. I just... Listen, -I do have one thing to tell you first. -It's not an intrusion. This is not entirely selfless. It started out as a simple reply to your Letter, and now I think it's so amazing what you're doing, -and I'd Love to write about it if it's okay. -CHARLIE: A journalist. Gran, a journalist trying to pry into our private lives. Charlie, come on. It's hardly state secrets, is it? I'm not a journalist. I would Like to be some day, but... And you think Gran's story is your ticket? I think it's a story worth telling. I'd Love to have you with us. -Really? -Yes. Of course. We would. SOPHIE: How much time did you actually spend with Lorenzo? CLAIRE: Every second that we could. I'd go to meet him after class, to the farm where he was working, and we'd sit under the trees and we'd share some bread with tomatoes and olive oil. -It's so romantic. -Yeah. What's so romantic about eating in the dirt? Really? CLAIRE: The dirt. Well, you see, he Loved the earth. He Loved talking to me about the rain and the springs of fresh water, and we'd walk for miles and miles. We'd lie in the dry grass. I can still remember the smell of his sweet, hot sweat and... Okay. Okay, Gran. We get the picture. So you must feel Like you're about to find your Iong-Iost soul mate. Yes. Her soul mate was my grandfather. Let's not invalidate my entire existence. Okay, I'm sorry, I just... That's clearly not what I meant. Charlie's just Like my husband. Both sceptics. My husband always insisted that Love was nothing but hormones. But you see, underneath, he had such a warm, passionate heart. And Charlie's just the same. Tell me about the guy you're in Love with. Victor. Yeah. -Well, Victor is a chef, an amazing chef. -Wow. Yeah. He's opening his own restaurant in New York. And that's the reason we're here. We're meeting suppliers all around. And he's actually... He's in Livorno at a wine auction as we speak. That sounds fun. For him. Yeah. Well, and do your parents Like him? Yeah, my dad. My dad Likes him. My mom Left us when I was nine. Oh, dear. -Oh, dear. I'm sorry about that. -That's okay. It was a really Long time ago. Slowly, slowly. How do you want to go about this? Ring the doorbell. What if the wife answers and goes into a fit of jealous rage? Gran? Well, I'd be flattered. I'm more worried that he won't remember me. Right. Let's go home then, Gran, before this all ends in tears. Come on. There's no one in. I'm goanna check the back. There's no... We made our best effort. There's no need to prolong the disappointment. {GREETS IN ITALIAN} {SPEAKING ITALIAN} It's me, yeah. Good afternoon. I'm Charlie Wyman. This is my grandmother, Claire, -and Sophie. -Ciao. I'm Claire. Do you remember? Claire. It's not him. Are you sure? It's not his eyes. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} Let's make sure. Do you remember what you were doing in the summer of 1957? The summer of 1957, I will never forget, I met the most beautiful girl with Long, blonde hair. Nana! We married that year. -I curse that woman! -CLAIRE: What? -Oh, no! -Right. I curse her eyes! I curse her teeth! I curse her moustache! But why are you asking? Why you bring up such a horrible memory? {WOMEN LAUGHING} CHARLIE: Well, that went well. Can't say we didn't try, Nana. I'm sorry. Truly. Are you for real? If I actually knew what that question meant, I might attempt to answer it. He can't be the only Lorenzo Bartolini in Tuscany. Well, he's the only one around here, so... I haven't flown all the way here to pack it in now. Nana, what do you want to do? You want to start knocking on every door asking if Lorenzo's in? I mean... How many can there be? CHARLIE: Seventy-four? Seventy-four Lorenzo Bartolinis and you want to go on a scavenger hunt? Impossible. We're going home in the morning. Come on, Charlie, will you calm down? Sophie, what do you think? Gran, what do you mean, what does she think? She doesn't think. This was her brilliant idea. It's over! Done! We found Nemo. The curtains have closed. {SPEAKING LATIN} -Sophie. -Listen, this is my job. I find things. And through process of elimination and caveat emptor, which will require assembling a few more facts, we can narrow this down considerably. Did Ms. Awesome For Real just use caveat emptor? Oh, please, all right. I went to Brown. Double Major. Minor in Latin. This is madness. It's madness. Charlie, didn't you say you wanted to go and swim? -We are working. Go away. -This is utter, complete mad... Work! CHARLIE: I can't believe it. Ridiculous. CLAIRE: He's a good-Looking sort. Isn't he? AII right. Are you sure that Lorenzo would never have Left this area? He Loved this Land. I'm quite certain. May I? Our Lorenzo's. Are you sure that you have time for all this? {AUCTIONING IN ITALIAN} {CELL PHONE RINGING} Ciao. How are you? I'm good. How are you? You know what? I was just witnessing this most incredible, incredible Sauterne auction. It was just beautiful. It was incredible. How's it going? I'm good. I'm in Siena right now. What? In Siena? -What are you doing in Siena? -I'm writing a story. We're kind of on a bit of an adventure, Looking for somebody that she used to know 50 years ago. You know what, baby? You know what? I mean, this isn't a good time because I'm in the middle of something, but, I mean, I'm glad you called because I was actually just goanna call you right now. You know, the opportunities here are really, really, really incredible, you know, and I think I'm goanna have to stay till Friday. Can I stay or should I skip it? I mean, I feel horrible, but... No, do it. Please. I'm goanna need until Friday, as well. Great. So Friday, all right? Friday. Friday's good. Okay. Win-win. {BIDDING FAREWELL IN ITALIAN} Claire? I'm free. -Free for what? Free for what? -She's coming. -She's coming with us. - She's coming? Splendid. CHARLIE: That's splendid! Fantastic! {BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN} -Okay? -Okay. Good Luck. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} It's not him. CLAIRE: Oh, my God. No! CHARLIE: Well, wouldn't this be nice, Gran? Going from a boy who works the fields to a man who owns them. And you got to skip the messy bits. Life is the messy bits. Peccato it wasn't me. Yes. I would have never Let you go. Believe me. {BOTH BIDDING FAREWELL IN ITALIAN} SOPHIE: What is it with you and Italian men? They fall at your feet. It's such a shame. I think I could've been happy here. Happy? Did your grandson just say happy? I said could have been. Let's not get carried away. I have a reputation to uphold. CLAIRE: Charlie, why don't you tell Sophie about your pro bono Legal work? I can't imagine she'd have much interest, Gran. -Try me. -You know the sort of thing, defending the defenceless, preserving human rights, helping refugees get asylum. -You Look surprised. -I'm so surprised. I just didn't have you pinned down as the save-humanity type at all. CHARLIE: Really? And what type did you have me pinned down for exactly? Well, I was Leaning towards elitist Oxford prig, but now that you mention it, self-satisfied do-gooder works, as well. I guess you're a poor judge of character then. But she does deal with facts, Charlie. Okay. -I'm off to bed. -Okay. -Good night, darling. -Good night. Sleep well. -May I walk you to your room? -Be nice to each other. She is awesome. I respect your usage of the word this one instance. Oh, I'm flattered. Thank you for approving. You're very welcome. Right. Well. Should we hit the sack? Sorry. I guess I... Well, as much as I'd Love to sit here and drink the whole bottle of Caparzo... No, go to bed. You should. Good night, Charlie. Right. -Well, good night. -Good night. Forgive me. Where are my manners? You know, I've been wondering that since I met you. Yes, well, I don't know what it is, but you seem to bring out the very worst in me. -Somehow it's my fault. -AII of this is your fault. You wrote that blasted Letter. Nonetheless, may I walk you to your room? You know, I'm not the buttoned-up, buttock-clenching killjoy you try to make me out as. Right. And I made you argue that true Love is bollocks. Guilty. It's just that I'm genuinely worried for her. I know she may seem carefree, but her Life hasn't been all that simple. Is it that unreasonable for me to worry? No, but I have a really good feeling about this. You'II see. Let's hope you're right. NURSE: Signora Claire. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} Signor Bartolini. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {SPEAKING ITALIAN} We're not done yet. Of course we're not, darling. {BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN} Hello. -Hello? -Hello. Hi. Is Claire with you? No? No, no. She's turned in early, actually. Okay. I was goanna ask if you wanted dinner, but... I just... I wanted to get started on my story. How's it coming? It's coming okay. Am I in it? -You may be. Why? -Can I read just a Little bit? -Are you kidding me? -Come on, just a Little bit. Absolutely not. How am I to be sure that I'm being properly portrayed? No, you are. Believe me. You are. -What's that supposed to mean? -It means good night, Charlie. -Good night. -Okay. Yeah. Good night. -What? Okay. -Is this one of those situations where you're really saying the opposite of what you actually mean? No. Right. Good night then. Good night, Charlie. Good morning. Good morning. Gran wants to sleep in this morning. Is she okay? I mean, does she need anything? No need. She's tough as old boots, that one. Churchill in a dress. So, I thought I'd see a bit of Siena since we're here. It's a good idea. I suppose you want to keep on writing. I mean... Work, work, work. Admirable trait. Right, of course. Carry on then. Charlie? Since we're here... I hate to compliment you, but what you're doing for Claire is really... It's sweet, and I... I imagine that you'd rather be spending your holiday elsewhere, so did you volunteer your services, or did your parents? I mean, where do they fit in? I'd Like to think they're someplace nice. They were killed in a car accident when I was 10. I'm sorry. God, I'm sorry. CHARLIE: Thank you, Sophie. I appreciate it. It was a difficult time. Gran Lost her son. I Lost my parents. I'm not a big believer in happy endings, I'm afraid. Anyway, Gran stepped in. Took an angry, obnoxious, young boy under her wing and made me the simply unpleasant man I am today. {BELL TOLLING} CHARLIE: So, isn't your fiance starting to get just a tad Lonely? SOPHIE: You know, Victor's having the time of his Life right now. And I doubt he even notices that I'm gone. What about you? -Don't you have a girlfriend? -That is a very, very Long story. Yeah? I'm not surprised. It's been about a year since I've seen Patricia. And you broke up with her? Are you insinuating that I'm more the type to be dumped rather than do the dumping? Maybe I am. Actually, I did break up with Patricia. This time. Okay, that's enough. AII right. That's enough. -Sophie... -That's enough. -Your writing is really good. -Thank you. No. It's really, really, really good. Why are you so surprised? How come you've never shown your work to anyone? -I never feel Like it's finished. -Why? Because I guess I'm a perfectionist. You know that's just another way of saying "I'm a chicken"? Listen. You've got nothing to be afraid of. You're not a fact checker. You're a writer. {BOTH LAUGHING} -What was that for? -I'm not a chicken. -And I'm not a gentleman. - Do you think we should get back to Claire? Yeah. Many more Lorenzo's. Okay. We should get back to Claire. I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Take him! Take him! I am Lorenzo Bartolini! I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Wow. I am Lorenzo Bartolini! {ALL LAUGHING} Do you know what you are? You are the Montague's and the Capulet's. You mean... Well, at Least I'm not Romeo. -That's the understatement of the century. -No, no, no, because you see, if I found the Love of my Life, I wouldn't stand there Like an idiot whispering in a garden. I would just grab her from that blasted balcony and be done with it. Do you believe in destiny? Do you? Yeah, I think so. I think it's destiny that I'm here, right now. With Claire. {CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY} Of course. Of course. With Claire. Well, this is the street. Well, there's 2. Here's number 2. {DOORBELL RINGS} {ALL SPEAKING ITALIAN} This is what I feared the most. -Charlie, we don't even know if it's him. -I hope it's not. I hope it's not. -Either way, we're finished. We're done. -No. Not here. When do we stop? Over the next hill? Or the next? Scour the whole country? No. No. It ends here. There are other Lorenzo's not too far away from here. It's not the ending you want, is it? This isn't just a clever story -with a clever ending. -Stop it, Charlie. -It's our Life. It's my Gran's Life. -It's not about... Charlie, it's not about a story. No, no, no, she's already Lost the man once. How many more times would you have her Lose him? You know what? I don't expect you to understand any of this because you don't know a thing about real Loss. Yeah. You're wrong. Sophie's mother ran away from her when she was a Little girl. It's different, Gran. It's different. You're right. But Sophie's mother chose to Leave her. And you always knew your mum and dad Loved you. {KNOCKING ON DOOR} Come in. Hi. Oh, dear. I just wanted to see if you were all right. I'm okay. Claire, I'm so sorry if I caused you... No. Every minute has been so special. Darling. May I? One of the great joys in Life is having one's hair brushed. CLAIRE: Charlie, say you're sorry. In the eye, Charlie. With contrition. Sophie... -Thank you. -... I'm afraid I... In the eye. Yes, Gran, I'm not 1 2. Prove it. I'm sincerely sorry, Sophie. It won't happen again. Excellent. CLAIRE: Sophie, -I want to make a toast. -Thank you. I want to thank you for the wonderful thing you did for a complete stranger. I'II never forget it. Nor I. I've had the most incredible few days. I really have, and I can't thank you enough for Letting me tag along. I think you did more than tag along. Here is to all our Loved ones, wherever they may be. May I join you? Please. I am sorry, Sophie. I used to Lay out under the stars as a kid, in the summertime. "Doubt thou the stars are fire "Doubt that the sun doth move" CHARLIE: "Doubt truth be a Liar "But never doubt I Love" Do you think he's out there? Lorenzo? Yeah. He's somewhere. And am I wrong? To insist she quit? No, you know, you can't go on forever. At some point, you have to stop. Then why is it that I feel Like a schoolboy on Sunday? It's nearly tomorrow and I don't want to go. Me, either. And I always Liked school. -Morning. -Morning. Thank you. How'd you sleep? I slept fine. How about you? Yes. Great. Thanks. CHARLIE: Good morning. CLAIRE: Good morning. -How are you? -Good morning, my darling. It's a beautiful day. Sophie, would you mind going in the front? Because I'd Love to stretch my Legs for a bit. Okay. Fantastic, darling. CLAIRE: The stars were spectacular from my window. {SINGING IN ITALIAN} Look. That vineyard. That's our favourite wine. Let's turn in there and have a goodbye toast. Okay. Charlie, stop! CHARLIE: Nana, what is it? It's Lorenzo. Who? The boy? AII right, Nana. Let's get you in the shade. Shall we? {SPEAKING ITALIAN} I am Lorenzo Bartolini. Sophie. I think this is... -Do you know a Lorenzo Bartolini? -I asked him and... -I am Lorenzo Bartolini. -You are! Oh, my... Sophie, he's the grandson! -Can I help you? -Yes. We're Looking for a Lorenzo Bartolini. I am Lorenzo Bartolini. -He's Lorenzo, too. -Do you have a father also named Lorenzo? Yes, he went out riding. But what can I do for you? I'm sorry. We're being terribly rude. -I'm Charlie Wyman. -I'm Sophie. Lorenzo. Lorenzo. We have been on quite a journey for your father. You see, my grandmother, Claire, knows him. Charlie. Charlie, Let's go! Let's go! AII right. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} Nana, Nana, Nana, Lorenzo is here. He's out riding, but he's going to be back any minute. Well, then, Let's go before he comes back. Nana, we've come all this way. -Come on. -I've been ridiculous. I've been completely ridiculous. He knew me when I was 15 years old, a girl. That girl's gone. {HORSE APPROACHING} Oh, my God. Claire? Yes. So many years. Yes, 50. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN} If you allow me. I really don't know how to express myself. Well, I went for a ride this morning as an old man, and I came back as a teenager again. I'm so very happy you all meet Claire and her grandson, Charlie, and their Lovely friend, Sophie. My dear Claire, you have told me you Lost your Jack. -And you know I Lost my Rosa. -Yeah. But destiny wanted us to meet again. {THANKING IN ITALIAN} {ALL TOASTING} CLAIRE: Health to the Bartolini family. CHARLIE: To the Bartolinis. I'm sorry I was late. No. When we are speaking about Love, it's never too late. Well, bad Luck, eh? AII hope Lost and he rides in at the Last moment on a white horse. No one will believe it. Promise me... Promise me you'II finish the story. I guess this is it. And I'm sorry it is. Yeah, me, too. Sophie, I... I never should've kissed you. I was completely out of bounds. Mmm. You're engaged and... It's time to go. Goodbye, Charlie. I'II miss you. Hi. It is time to... I must get back to Victor. Sorry. Yes. Of course. So, where's Charlie? We'II give you a drive there straight away. No, I'm... Claire, I can't take you away from this place, so... My son can drive you. -Just a moment. -Yes. Grazie. I'm so happy for you. Is something wrong? No! No. No. It's just, you know... And you're Leaving? An angel brought you to me. Thank you. Thank you. I'II be eternally grateful. Thank you. It's very kind. Thank you. Thank you so much. -You're always welcome here. -Thank you. -Thank you, Lorenzo. -Ciao. Speak soon. Bye. Darling, you're family, so I think you'II understand why I'm telling you you're a total idiot. Okay, okay, then don't sugarcoat it, Gran. I won't. How many Sophies do you think there are on this planet? Don't wait 50 years Like I did. Go. Go! Go! I missed you so much! So much. ...in person because I couldn't send you an e-mail, {CELL PHONE RINGING} because it was... It just didn't make sense, because I know you were having... One second. Hello? Hey. Yeah, yeah. We just have to sort out all the deliveries that we need to make. I mean... What happened? You don't Like the ending? No, the ending's fine. It's actually quite moving. But what happened to the people? I mean, are they still together? What about... What about the kid? What about Charlie? Where's he? I don't know. I didn't keep in touch. Do you have any advice? I think you should buy stock in Alitalia, 'cause all the Ladies are goanna be flocking to Verona. Are you goanna publish this? Yeah, I'm goanna publish it. It's a good story. You got anything else for me? No, not at the moment. Oh, my God. You said Tuscan gold, right? Tuscan gold? Look. This is yellow. Yellow. Tuscan gold. Yellow. I mean, there's no Tuscany, there's no gold. -It's just Like Limoncello, you know. -Sure. -Yeah? Can we do it again? -Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah? AII right, all right, all right. -Let's go. Come on. Let's try it again. -VICTOR: Hey, Sophie. -Hi. Hey, how's your day been? -I showed my story to Bobby. -Did he Like it? Yeah, he's goanna print it. -Print it? -Yeah. Wow! Wow. That's pretty great, huh? -I know. Did you read it? -Yeah, yeah. -No. I... -Last night I Left it out for you to read. I don't need to. I mean, I know it's goanna be great. Plus, I'm goanna see it... I'm goanna see it when it comes out. That's why I prefer to buy it. -You know, I'm surprised, Like... -Yeah. -You know? Like... -MAN: Watch out! Watch out! -{GLASS SHATTERING} - Hold on, hold on, hold on. -SOPHIE: Thanks for Lunch. -Oh, my God. You so deserve this. I want to be your fact checker for Life. Don't ever think about going anywhere else, ever. Ever. Ipromise. -Hi, guys. -Hey. Sophie, these messages are for you. Oh! -And a Letter came for you. -Thank you. New Yorker. {LOVE STORY PLAYING} We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns I see you make your way through the crowd And say hello Little did I know That you were Romeo You were throwing pebbles And my daddy said stay away from Juliet And I was crying on the staircase Begging you please don't go VICTOR: Hey, what's that smell? What... Hey, Alfonzo, Alfonzo. No, no, no, no. We said... We said we were goanna sweat I planted a bug in your car... Will you.... forgive me? Stay with me! The ambulance is on the way! I.... messed up. You're going to be Okay. You've always been the best! This won't.... kill me.... This won't.... Stay with me! The 7 47's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from the terminal 2. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want 10 million dollars. They were bluffing. Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium! Go back to Headquarters. Don't worry about the stadium. Not even a drop of water can pass through security. It won't work. Listen to me! You lost your partner today. Go back, it's an order! I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule, sorry. Your attention, please! No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thank you for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. If I were in the airport, no doubt I could prove myself. But what the hell am I doing here, watching the gate? Both teams are now entering the stadium. What are you.... How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim and Lee have just arrived! Let's give them a big hand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. / Turn the lights on? Who's in charge of the lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Why would anybody do that in a broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Did you turn the lights on in section 3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regular day, you know. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Substation Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn off the lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 011-244-1616... Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can't you hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you say were the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! Sometimes history needs a craziness to help it. What do you want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are not your barriers. When we're done here, our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights off now! That's not what the people of this land want. They don't want another war to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country. I remember very well. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it..." When you sing this song our people in the North are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters are being sold off for fucking 100 dollars! Have you ever seen parents eating the flesh of their dead kids? With cheese, coke, and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. A soccer game to unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years of deception. We're opening up a new history of Korea. 4 minutes to go. CTX will detonate soon. History will judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights off in section 3-G? Turn them off! Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off. Turn them off! We're dying together here. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell Turn the lights off? You know where Hee is? She's in the audience, laughing at you. 'You know where Hee is? ' 'She's in the audience, laughing at you.' O2, this is O3.... Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the President! Gate 52, he's on his way to the parking lot. Get out! Nat'l Defense spokesman revealed a war scenario attempted by.. ..North Korea's 8th special forces. They sent 5 secret agents including Park into South Korea.... Things about oddballs! One. Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning like you don't. I am not an oddball. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? March, last year. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn't you ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fish bowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a whole year? What do you want me to say? Answer the question. We don't trust anybody. Even the fellow agents you share life with but she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? It's not like you. Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a Goddess with 6 heads in Greek myths. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra of our times the reality of separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pager Voice Mail. You have one new message. Ryu it's me, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTX's planted in the lights over the Royal Box. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor. I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... ...is all of my life. With you I was neither Hyun nor Hee but just me. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu... I miss you so much. I miss you.... How have you been? It's you again. Did you meet her? No. It would have been nicer if you came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. Thanks a lot. If one of them dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised. She knew everything about fish. In fact... She stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating, you have to be alert. She's so bad with chopsticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. Clear Found it! Hyun? Don't tell any body you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear people of the South... today marks an important and joyous moment in our history.. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissension... and to open up a new era of under standing. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and he wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center. I'm on my way. Be there. On my way.. He's wearing a blackjacket and a black cap. Anything else? - That's all. - I'll be right there. You look good in a black jacket. Any one else coming? Hee, maybe. So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tap the phones. So, if they show up... I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a five-shot semi automatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her... I would have used the other three bullets. Three targets went inside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! - Been a long time. - Good to see you. Payback time for flight 257. Look who's talking. You killed seven of my men. You left your men behind. 'Cause I have a job to finish. You wanna know what it is? I'll ask Hee. It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! . Get back! She used only two bullets. In both cases, you were in here range. If I were here... I would have used the other three bullets. Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island. Why'd you come here? They ambushed us. OP set a trap. Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. Thanks to you... we lost two of our men! I did what I could do. Yeah, you saved my life. What do you want? You've changed. Of course I have... from Hee to Hyun. Not only in appearance, but inside as well! I don't need a betrayer. We've waited ten years for this moment. In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance... and buried our youth in the tomb of history. If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings, finish it here. I was stupid... thinking I could be Hyun. But I am just Hee who has to kill herman. I failed to change my inside. Let go! We have a job to finish. Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking... because her immune system has dropped. And make it quick. There she is, with the yellow sweater. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Are you from the public health center? . I am looking for this girl. Anything happen to her? . She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house... two years ago... and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me... as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me from Japan, but... I think she misplaced my number. Otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left, I cried my eyes out. She hugged me... and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know... what she was sorry about. Prepare ten million dollars... and a 747 Jumbo at the airport by 2:00. No mistakes. The Golden To were was just the beginning. I hope I don't have to use the other nine CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies in to the bowl. Two of them died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies anymore. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsyis needed-- If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North... will finally be kicking of fat Seoul Main Stadium at 2:00 p.m. today.. With the presidents of two nations present-- Hi. I'm here to collect for the newspaper. - How much? - Seven dollars. It's all right. Bye. What are you doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had four goldfish on my desk... I had four goldfish on my desk... and two of them died today. At first I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong. "SU300" inside their bodies... is a high-tech bug that can be used under water. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here... and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997... when Hee disappeared, you were in Japan. You didn't need a fake passport coming backing... because you became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy... Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me ask you this. Did you really love him? Over here! . I planted a bug in your car. Will you forgive me? Stay with me! . The ambulance is on the way! . I messed up. You're going to be okay. You've always been the best! This won't kill me. -This won't-- -Stay with me! . The 747's here. Holding position, 100 meters north west from terminal two. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! . They've set CTX around Seoul and want ten million dollars. - They were bluffing. - Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off thegame immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off. at the stadium! Go back to head quarters. Don'tworry about the stadium. Not even a drop of water can pass through security. - It won't work. - Listen to me! . You lost your partner today.. Go back. It's an order! . I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule. Sorry. Your attention, please. No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thank you for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. If I were in the airport, no doubt I could prove myself. But what the hell am I doing here watching the gate? Both teams are now. entering the stadium. What are you-- How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim and Lee... have just arrived! Let's give them a hand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. Turn the lights on? Who's in charge of the lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Why would any body do that in broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Did you turn the lights on in section 3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regularday, you know.. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Sub station Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn off the lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 01 1-244-1 61 6. Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can't you hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you say were the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! . Sometimes history needs craziness to help it. What do you want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are not your barriers. When we're done here... our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights off now! . That's not what the people of this land want. They don't want another war to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country? . I remember very well. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians... but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it." When you sing this song... our people in the North... are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters... are being sold off.... for fucking 100 dollars! Have you ever seen parents eating... the flesh of their dead kids? With cheese, Coke and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. Asoccergameto unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years of deception. We're opening up... a new history of Korea. Four minutes togo. Four minutes togo. The CTX will detonate soon. History will judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years... came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights off in section 3-G? Turn them off! Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off.. Turn them off! We're dying together here. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell. Turn the lights off? . You know where Hee is? She's in the audience... laughing at you. You know where Hee is? She's in the audience, laughing at you O2, this is O3. O2, this is O3. Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the president! Gate 52, he's on his way. to the parking lot. Get out! A National Defense spokesman revealed a war scenario attempted by.... North Korea's 8th special forces. They sent five secret agents, including Park, into South Korea-- Things about oddballs! One. Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning like you don't. I am not an oddball. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? . March, last year. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn't you ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fish bowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a whole year? . What do you want me to say? . Answer the question. We don't trust anybody... not even the fellow agents you share life with. But she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? . It's not like you. Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a goddess with six heads in Greek mythology. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra of our times-- The reality of a separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pages Voice Mail. You have one new message. Ryu,.. it's me, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTX is planted in the lights over the Royal Box. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor.. I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... is all of my life. With you, I was neither Hyunnor Hee... but just me. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu,.. I miss you so much. I miss you. How have you been? It's you again. Did you meet her? . No. It would have been nicer if you came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. Thanks a lot. If one of them dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised. She knew everything about fish. In fact... she stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating... you have to be alert. She's so bad with chop sticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. Ryu: Han Suckyu Park: Choi Minsik Lee:. Song Kangho Hee:.

U2.Do you read me? "Good-bye" It's already been six months since Hee went into hiding. Maybe she was taken back due to the risk of exposure. - Hi! - Hi! I dreamt about U2 last night. He said he'd busted Hee. Good-bye. You know this song? I don't like music. You know that, don'tyou? September 1 998 Seoul May I help you? I was having a little chat with my buddies. About what? Love. And? They say love's to stay together until the last moment. They know the pain of separation. I bet they do, seeing each other sold off. Have you ever seen fishes cry? How do they cry? Cry in the water, then you'll know how. You're about the same size... as my boyfriend. Have you ever seen fishes laugh? No. It's already been a year. It was raining then, too. You came back the next day with a CD for me. - I said, "May I help you?" - "Anapus." Yeah, you said "Anapus" instead of"Anabus." "Bus!" It was a strange feeling. A total stranger gave me a CD I really liked. It was coincidental, but you felt so close, as if I'd known you for a long time. Did you go to alcohol cessation class today? The doctor said that I nolonger had to come. Take a guess.Ki Ki? Ki. You're unbelievable! They're Kissingurami. Kissingurami. Ifone of them dies, the other dies too. They dry up from malnutrition or their scales fall off. Don't let them die. Feed them once a day, and change the water-- Every five days. They don't survive where it's dark and cold. Keep the lights on all the time. I might do the same thing ifyou left me alone. Under the slogan of "Reunification of two Koreas"... a team of North and South for the World Cup2002... A friendly game will be held on the 25th... not only to pick players for the team... but to mark a turning point in history... where the two leaders of South and North Korea get together. - Yes? the game would speedup the reconciliation of the two Koreas. Change of plans. The third floor, electronics. - What happened? - Not clear yet. Any barrier? Around the third block. Take the outside! Calm down.I'm a secret agent. Why did you run? She was here. She knew about our rendezvous. Who? - Where? It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Please don't put ashes into the fishbowl. My goldfish smokes, too. Dr. Min, identified It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Hey, oddball! Lim was the head of black-market weapons dealers. We knew nothing about his organization. When'd he call you? Right before I called you. The perpetratorwas there at the same time. Considering the fact that he was at the scene... he wasn't being followed. Otherwise he would've been killed before the rendezvous. I'll tell you the details later, but it's about my client... who is onto something very dangerous. Letme tellyouagain. Ifyoudon'tprotectme-- His life was being threatened during the weapons deal. Our priority is to find out who his client was. We went to meet him right after the call. The big question is... how'd this client know we were meeting? Autopsy reports came out. From the first to the fourth cervical vertebrae... one bullet went through between the third and fourth... and the other penetrated between right and left atrium... which killed him instantly. The heart was completely destroyed. I've never seen anything like this before. Good-bye. Chodo Harbor, North Korea For the victory! For the victory! No more corrupt politicians! No more 50 years ofseparation, disgrace and humiliation! We're writing a new history of Korea! And the beginning ofit is in your hands! Good luck. For the unification. For the unification. For the unification. For the unification. Team 4, go! Don't move! He left nothing related to his business. No wonder. They destroy everything that could be used against them. It's hard to find any connection between Lim and Hee. Then we're back to square one. People around Lim? Lim took care of business by himself. Nobody knows anything. Hee's been hiding out for over a year. I don't get it. A weapons dealerwas her first target. It's too easy for her. Aren't we overreacting? Could it be a gang war imitating her? Nobody can imitate her. We need to find out what she wanted from him... and why he contacted us. What did Hee ask him for? What was the information Lim tried to give us? Ifshe hasn't gotten what she wanted from him yet... she'll try to get it through other channels. We need to focus on the fact that North Korea's using her again... even though her identity has been exposed to us. You two are the best agents we've got. Finish her atyour first opportunity. What doyou think was their relationship? Why'd she approach him? I guess she needed something from him. That's it.That thing she asked him to get her.That's the key. What'd he mean by something dangerous? You look awfully serious. We're late, come on. I got delayed at the beauty parlor. Haveyou waited long? Not long. How do I look? We'd better hurry. Did you sleep well? Did I snore? I was worried about that. He always sleeps at the theater. You two are here. He isn't into anything. He doesn't even like to sing or listen to music. Really? I grew up near the airport 'cause my old man was a pilot. So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm. Nothing's music to my ears. Then, what doyou like? I like looking for people. Lately I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend. What's she like? You want to take a look? She's cute. Why did you break up? So I can look for her. Gosh, I'm sorry. - No problem. - Wipe it offwith this. Here. - I am really sorry. - It's okay. It's punishment for dozing off in the theater. Excuse me. - When is your wedding day? - 20th ofnext month. When are you gonna tell her? - You can't hide it forever. - I don't wanna burden her. What about her? What if you die on a mission? - I can't anyway. - Why not? You don't trust her? Let me ask you something. If Hee and I point a gun at each other... and you have to choose one, who would that be? Hee, ofcourse. I'd save your ass 'cause I can bust her later. You don't get many chances. You don't get many friends you'd die for either. It's not too late, man. You can changeyour mind. Cheers. I'm all wet! Wait till that stain gets washed off. I've had it. Give me money for laundry. I'll pay for it when I do that again. - Aim well next time. - I'll try. - Where are all the taxis? - Let's take the subway. - In this rain? - You're wet anyway. Come on, let's run! You sure? It's gonna rain all night long. I like it. I don't think they do. It's bedtime for them. Looks like the rain woke them up. - What are they saying? - They want us to keep quiet. - How are your Kissingurami? - They fight a lot. One minute, they hate each other... next minute, they're hugging, kissing and stuff. They're always like that.When I go out, I get worried about them. IfI am not there, you have to take care ofthem. I don't think I can. I can't even handle "Kissing" and "Anabus" at home. That's why you have to learn more. To live with them, you have no choice. Your sweater is almost done. I hope it looks good on you. What should I getyou for the wedding? All I want is... whatever happens to me... you love and never leave me. That's all. Because you're the only one who truly understands me. Shiri, step one, on! Kim? He looks most suspicious on the transaction record. - Who's he? - National Defense lab researcher. As a part ofa new weapons system being developed... Kim speaking. Yes. Okay. we launched the CTX project lastyear. If Kim was doing business with the weapons dealer... chances are very high that it was CTX. Tell me more about the CTX. CTX is a new type ofenergy... originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab. We've been working on turning it into a weapon. At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions... but the test we did last month was successful. People atyour agency know about this too. It'll bring a sensational change to the military's weapons systems. How's it different from the conventional bombs? It's a liquid bomb. What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color... and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices. Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than... any other bombs you've ever seen. What ifa black-market dealer got it? He could get the information on it, but not the CTX itself... becauseyou need three or four approvals to release it. If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over... he would've returned the money. Where's it made and kept? That's confidential. Sorry. But CTX has never been released until today. How are you so sure? When CTX is released... it goes through three authorization checkpoints... and this morning everything was in order. You're saying it was released this morning? For the weapon show tomorrow... it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak. Sera Mike 1, stopatDongsanservicearea. Will Hee turn up? She wants the CTX. She wouldn't miss this chance. Why are they bothering us? Theywant two secret agents to ride with us. What for? What the hell is that? Sir, we need to check the vehicles. I wasn't informed ofthis. What's going on? We got a report ofa possible interception ofCTX. Your permit and I D, please. The CTX is safe with us. Get out ofthe way. Didn'tyou hear me? I asked foryour permit and I D, didn't I? This is Sera Mike 1 , we're stopped at a checkpoint. I don't have time for this. I'll fax it toyou. Ifyou resist, we'll have to arrestyou. What did you say? We'll have to arrestyou... or kill you. - Areyou nuts? - I'm fine. Areyou out ofyour mind? You fucking moron! Areyou fucking nuts? Wait, look at this. What base areyou from? Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea! Sera Mike 1 , doyou copy? They've been hit! It's worse than we thought! It's a bomb! Run! Hee asked Lim for the CTX... and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over. But when they realized it couldn't be done... they planned to intercept it on the road. In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered... along with 20 ofour armed guards. How much CTXwas taken? About a gallon. It is enough to blow up an entire city. Any leads on the interceptors? Notyet, sir.Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee. But whywould North Korea do that... in a time ofreconciliation? We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle... but the gunfire at the scene makes me think... that they're highly trained North Korean militants. Their military system is falling fast. It could be a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose. The question is, what are they planning to do with the CTX? Ifit blows up in Seoul, we're finished. We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX. As you all know, it may explode without the detonator. And no devices can detect the liquid itself. Ifthey utilize those traits, expect the worst. There's no way to predict when, where or how it's gonna go off. - Dinner? - I don't feel like it. Is the meeting over? - Little while ago. Anything special? Ready to order? - Hi. - Hi. - Beer, please. - Okay. What about the scene? An inspection ofthe scene was delayed and the bodies werejust taken to the headquarters. The film will be handed over tomorrow. Any leads? Just bodies and shells. Isn't it strange? Anything else? This is the third time.Lim, Kim. This time CTXwas intercepted. We went to see Lim right after the call... and to the lab right after we got the report. We're always a step behind. It's like theywere reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Don't jump to conclusions.Today we went to the lab without notice. Kim didn't even know that we were coming... and he got killed five minutes before we got there. If that's the case, it's obvious. Only Director Ko and I knew about those killings and the CTX. And you made the report. Shiri 1 's on line. It's been a long time. - How's my family? - They're fine. I miss them. Completion is near. You'll meet them soon. A barrier is in the way. Get rid ofit. Target? Kissingurami. Finish thejob before the completion. Acknowledged. For the unification. For the unification. We're always a step behind. They were reading our moves. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. - Hello? - It'sme, Ho. - Can I seeyou tomorrow? -Sure. What'sgoingon? I have a favor to ask. Call me at the police agency tomorrow. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. I'll call you. What are you doing there? You scared me! - You just got here? - No, earlier. I cleaned and did the laundry. Nothing was in the refrigerator. so I went grocery shopping. What's wrong? You don't look so good. Just busy at work. Why didn'tyou call? I was gonna leave soon.Dinner? Not yet.I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. - What are we having? - Your favorite. - You wanna take a shower? - After dinner. - I think it's done. - Let it simmer. Can you hand me the clothespins and hangers from the sofa? - I couldn't find the pins. - It's okay. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed upyet. - Let me help you pack up. - Okay. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up byyourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me, that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me.I'll never drink again. Because I haveyou. Thesoccerteam of SouthandNorth Koreareturnedtoday... to the Seoul Training Center aftertraining in Pohang... with North Korean officials coming through "Panmunjum. " The North Korea President Lee and officials... coming to the south for the game and a conference... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color. You can't tell the difference from waterwith the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight... over 6,000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction. But without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. Ifyou expose it to both light and heat... nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200 cc, so everything within the radius of one kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction... the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, ifthe sphere becomes red... it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops...it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years.You're an oddball. I am not, sir. - Admit it. - No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fishbowls. AgentRyu, come toroom 17. I gotta go. Find the CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognize him? Don'tyou remember, Ryu? His name is Park.A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked... he was the only one that escaped from the plane. A painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park.All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th special forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from National Defense. - Agent Yoon! - Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th special forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th special forces intercepted the CTX. Why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table... for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for... they say theywant peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. Iftheywanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of Korea would be much easier. Whywould they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb? That's difficult to answer. Hee is the key to all this. We don't have time. We'll find a way. What do you see? Can't even tell me? Maybe the solution is much closer than we think. - What doyou mean? - Hee could be close by. Hey, you! - What the hell areyou doing here? - I am looking for the men's room. Areyou fucking blind? Didn't see the sign "Restricted Area"? Hey, you hear me? I sure did. Watch your mouth. - How haveyou been? - Bored to death. I feel more insecure when it's so quiet. I need some backup. What about your agency? - The air isn't very clear there. - What doyou mean? I think there's a leak. This is the onlyway. - It must be very stressful. - It'll get better. - When doyou need it? - Tomorrow. - I'm coming too. - Sorry, no married men. - Time and place? - I'll call you. All right, then. Ho! We'll talk later. How's your friend? He'll live. - I am glad to hear that. Have a seat. Who else knew you two were meeting? It was very personal. I didn't tell anybody. Lim, Kim, Ho.Hee is very nearby. There must be a leak. Nobody knows that for sure. Internal Affairs is on it. You don't trust your men? Doyou trust me? Traps could be anywhere. Maybe there's a hole in the security system... but that possibility is almost zero. Don't share the information with anybody. Not even with your partner, Lee. Traps underyour feet are hard to see. I'm the director in charge. I'm Park ofthe 8th specialforces. I want to talk tomyoldfriend. Thanks for calling me, friend. I was gonna send you a coffin, butyou were lucky. Disappointed with Hee's shooting? Save it. We can take you out anytime. Maybe I'll take you out first. So, you've become a man.You know where I am? Young drunk kids here yelling on the street... while people in the north are starving to death. Listen, friend. We have ten CTXs placed all over Seoul. I'll call you 30 minutes before each ofthem goes off. You'd better find them before people get hurt. What do you want? Slowdown, friend.The first one is on the roof ofthe Golden Tower. You have exactly 30 minutes. Youknowthe fishnamed "shiri"? It'sa Koreanaboriginalfish, living in crystalstreams. Though they'reseparated with the country divided... someday they'llreunite in thesamestreams. ShouldIbuysome foryourgirlfriend's fishshop? Why not? Stay alive until then. He's on the move. Clear! Found it! Hyun? Don't tell anybodyyou're here. Page me ifnecessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care ofthe shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don'tyou? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear people of the South,to day marks an important and joyous moment in our history. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissension... and to open up a new era of understanding. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and he wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center. I'm on myway. Be there. He's wearing a blackjacket and a black cap. Anything else? - That'sall. I'll be right there. You look good in a blackjacket. Anyone else coming? Hee, maybe. Soyou called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tap the phones. So, if they show up... I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a five-shot semiautomatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. Three targets wentinside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! - Been a long time. - Good to seeyou. Payback time for flight 257. You killed seven of my men. You left your men behind. 'Cause I have ajob to finish. You wanna know what it is? It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! Get back! She used only two bullets. In both cases,you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island. Why'd you come here? They ambushed us. OP set a trap. Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I metyou here, I saw the confusion in you. Thanks to you... we lost two ofour men! I did what I could do. Yeah, you saved my life. What do you want? You've changed. Ofcourse I have... from Hee to Hyun. Not only in appearance, but inside as well! I don't need a betrayer. We've waited ten years for this moment. In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance... and buried our youth in the tomb of history. If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings finish it here. I was stupid..thinking I could be Hyun. But I am just Hee who has to kill her man I failed to change my inside. Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking... because her immune system has dropped. There she is, with the yellow sweater. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Are you from the public health center? I am looking for this girl. Anything happen to her? She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house two years ago... and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me... as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me fromJapan, but... I think she misplaced my number. Otherwise she'd have called. She went toJapan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left,I cried my eyes out. She hugged me and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know what she was sorry about. Prepare ten million dollars... and a 747 Jumbo at the airport by 2:00. Nomistakes. The Golden Tower wasjust thebeginning. Ihope Idon'thave to use the othernine CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies into the bowl. Two ofthem died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies anymore. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsy is needed-- Ifthis is formy failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personalorder. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North... will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main stadium at 2:00 p.m today. With thepresidents oftwonationspresent-- Hi. I'm here to collect for the newspaper. - How much? - Seven dollars. It's all right. Bye. What areyou doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had four goldfish on my desk... I had four goldfish on my desk... and two ofthem died today. At first I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong. "SU300" inside their bodies... is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here... and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997... when Hee disappeared, you were inJapan. You didn't need a fake passport coming back in... becauseyou became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy... Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me askyou this. Did you really love him? Over here! I planted a bug in your car. Will you forgive me? Staywith me! The ambulance is on the way! I messed up. You're going to be okay. You've always been the best! This won't kill me. - Stay with me! The 747's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from terminal two. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. Whatareyou talkingabout? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want ten million dollars. - They werebluffing. - Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call offthe game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium! Go back to headquarters. Don't worry about the stadium. Not even a drop ofwater can pass through security. - It won't work.Listen tome! You lost your partner today. Goback. It'san order! I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule. Sorry. Your attention, please. No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thankyou for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. But what the hell am I doing here watching the gate? How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim andLee... havejustarrived! Let's give them abighand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. Turn the lights on? Who's in charge ofthe lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Whywould anybody do that in broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Didyou turn thelights on insection3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regular day, you know. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn offthe lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 01 1 -244-1 61 6. Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can'tyou hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you saywere the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! Sometimes history needs craziness to help it. What doyou want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are notyour barriers. When we're done here our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights offnow! That's not what the people ofthis land want. They don't want anotherwar to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country? I rememberverywell.What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians... but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it." When you sing this song our people in the North are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters are being sold off... for fucking 100 dollars! Haveyou ever seen parents eating... the flesh oftheir dead kids? With cheese, Coke and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. A soccer game to unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years ofdeception. We're opening up.. a new history of Korea. The CTXwill detonate soon. Historywill judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years... came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights offing section 3-G? Turn them off! . Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell. You know where Hee is? She's in the audience laughing at you. Youknow where Heeis? She's in theaudience,laughingatyou. Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the president! Gate52, he's onhis way to theparking lot. A NationalDefensespokesman revealeda warscenarioattemptedby... North Korea's 8th specialforces. They sent five secretagents, including Park, intoSouth Korea-- Things about oddballs! One. Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning likeyou don't. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? March, lastyear. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn'tyou ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fishbowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a wholeyear? What doyou want me to say? Answer the question. We don't trust anybody... not even the fellow agents you share life with. But she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a goddess with six heads in Greek mythology. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra ofour times-- The reality ofa separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pager Voice Mail. You have one newmessage. Ryu.it'sme, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTXisplantedin thelights overthe RoyalBox. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor.I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... is all of my life. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu... I miss you so much. I miss you. How have you been? It's you again.Did you meet her? No. It would have been nicer ifyou came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. Ifone ofthem dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised.She knew everything about fish. In fact she stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating... you have to be alert. She's so bad with chopsticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. Han Suckyu Choi Minsik Song Kangho Kim Yunjin Directed by Kang Jegyu SHIRI October 1992 Somewhere in North Korea T1 6, clear! T1 9, clear!

Do you copy, U2? U2. Do you read me? "Good-bye" It's already been six months since Hee went into hiding. Maybe she was taken back due to the risk of exposure. - Hi! - Hi! I dreamt about U2 last night. He said he'd busted Hee. Good-bye. You know this song? I don't like music. You know that, don'tyou? September 1998 Seoul May I help you? I was having a little chat with my buddies. About what? Love. And? They say love's to stay together until the last moment. They know the pain of separation. I bet they do, seeing each other sold off. Have you ever seen fishes cry? How do they cry? Cry in the water, then you'll know how. You're about the same size... as my boyfriend. Have you ever seen fishes laugh? No. It's already been a year. It was raining then, too. You came back the next day to buy a fishbowl... with a CD for me. - I said, "May I help you?" - "Anapus." Yeah, you said "Anapus" instead of"Anabus." "Bus!" It was a strange feeling. A total stranger gave me a CD I really liked. It was coincidental, but... you felt so close, as if I'd known you for a long time. Did you go to alcohol cessation class today? The doctor said that I no longer had to come. Take a guess. - Ki. - Ki? Ki. You're unbelievable! They're "Kissingurami." Kissingurami. If one of them dies, the other dies too. They dry up from malnutrition. Or their scales fall off. Don't let them die. Feed them once a day, and change the water-- Every five days. They don't survive where it's dark and cold. Keep the lights on all the time. I might do the same thing if you left me alone. Kissingurami. Breaking news. Under the slogan of "Reunification of two Koreas"... a team of North and South for the World Cup 2002... was launched earlier today. A friendly game will be held on the 25th... not only to pick players for the team... but to mark a turning point in history... where the two leaders of South and North Korea get together. The president of the Korea Football Organization said... the game would speed up the reconciliation of the two Koreas. - Yes? - We were supposed to meet. Change of plans. The third floor, electronics. - What happened? - Not clear yet. Any barrier? Around the third block. Take the outside! Calm down. I'm a secret agent. Dead end of 4th Street. Against the wall! Why did you run? She was here. She knew about our rendezvous. Who? - Where? - He's down! It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Please don't put ashes into the fishbowl. My goldfish smokes, too. Dr. Min, identified It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Hey, oddball! Lim was the head of black-market weapons dealers. We knew nothing about his organization. When'd he call you? Right before I called you. The perpetrator was there at the same time. Considering the fact that he was at the scene... he wasn't being followed. Otherwise he would've been killed before the rendezvous. My life is on the line. I'll tell you the details later, but it's about my client... who is onto something very dangerous. Let me tell you again. If you don't protect me-- His life was being threatened during the weapons deal. Our priority is to find out who his client was. We went to meet him right after the call. The big question is... how'd this client know we were meeting? Autopsy reports came out. - What's up? - It's Wednesday. - Get the smell off the bowl. - Don't put cookies into it then. You can't feed the fish the same thing all the time. From the first to the fourth cervical vertebrae... one bullet went through between the third and fourth... and the other penetrated between right and left atrium... which killed him instantly. The heart was completely destroyed. I've never seen anything like this before. The former coroner has. Dr. Kim, Director Cho. They're all the same. She's at it again. Good-bye. Chodo Harbor, North Korea For the victory! For the victory! No more corrupt politicians! No more 50 years of separation, disgrace and humiliation! We're writing a new history of Korea! And the beginning Jewelry and household goods, tables C... There's a lot of stuff here, how much do you think this is all worth? All these wonderful prizes are worth tens of thousands of dollars and they can all be yours, Timothy McGee, if you can answer the NCIS bonus question. Where'd it come from? Actually, boss, I can answer that. Burglaries. All over the city. Torres dug up this report. Metro PD's been tracking a citywide theft ring for over half a decade. - This is all they got? Yup. Clearly Bruno didn't do all this himself, but Metro never generated a single lead on whoever was involved. - Well, I have one. Not to brag. All the fingerprints that I found in the room belonged to Bruno. But I also found this, which did not, according to Ducky. Bruno had a visitor with a really bad case of pityriasis capitis. AKA dandruff. Left flakes everywhere. Like snow. That teacher see anyone? I don't think she's seen anyone since the '90s, boss. She did say Bruno would have an occasional visitor. Said it was, "A man or maybe a woman, I think." Whoever they are, I'll bet you dollars to donuts that they are gonna be coming back for this stuff. Take Quinn, McGee, eyes on that house 24/7. Abbs? Don't even think about it. - So how long has it been since you've been on stakeout? - It's been a while. But I-I'm good to go. I taught yearly seminars on it. Oh, I... I remember. Oh, that's right. I did forgot one crucial element. What's that? Hydration is your enemy. Ah, yeah. Well... Men's room. Ladies' room. No. I am not at DEFCON 1 yet. But you will be the first to know. You will be the one with the bag on your head. - What is she doing? We told her to stay in the house. Well, we told her to do what she normally does, so... Does she normally water the bird feeder? - Aw, be nice. She's a lonely old lady. Which reminds me, Bishop told me you're going to propose to your girlfriend. Congrats. Thanks. Tho... uh, those two things reminded you of each other? Oh. When are you gonna pop the question? When it's time. And when is that time? I don't know. I'm not exactly sure yet. I know I'm just gonna feel it out and... you know, I... I think... I'll just know, you know? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Right. No. I'll know that it's time when it's time. When might that be? I... Ooh, I see something. Yeah, it was really good chatting. Oh, yeah. Ooh, I got to go. - She won't tell us who she is. - Yeah, still no hits on her prints. Abby confirmed that it's her dandruff in our dead guy's room. Any I.D.? Only thing she had on her was her purse. - Yeah, and I have been to drug-lord torture rooms less scary. Me? Oh. Yup. What's your name? Okay. Where do you live? Okay. What were you doing in Jimmy Bruno's house? All right, we can sit here all day doing this... Hey. Are you hungry? Yeah? Here you go. Hey. How's the interrogation going? Well, just as you thought. Gibbs is slow walking it. Seeing if Torres will pick up the pace. Hmm, how's he doing? Well, he interrupted Gibbs. Took me four years before I got up the nerve to do that. Thank you. But he's got her talking. - Don't thank me too fast. We're about to charge you with murder. Bruno was my friend, I would never hurt him. Okay, well, then help us find out who did. I don't know anything. Did you know your friend tried to murder 50 people? - And maybe you were planning it with him. No! Hey! - Then why were you running? I wasn't. Really? Sardines, underwear? Looks like you were planning a trip somewhere. Or, you know what? I don't even want to imagine what else. Let's just go with running. You're wrong. That bomb couldn't have been Bruno's. He wouldn't do something like that. His fingerprints were all over it. Then you made a mistake! He's a thief, but not a killer. So you do know something. You're a thief, too, huh? Well, somebody's going down for Bruno's murder and guess who the Wheel of Misfortune just stopped on? I helped Bruno sell some stuff, that's all. It's none of my business where he got it. How long you been fencing for him? We have video of your friend building that bomb. He's not who you think he is. No, he's not who you think he is. You... you see him as you want to see him. He's got a lot of bark, yeah, but no bite. If he really did plant that bomb, then someone made him do it. He was tricked or something. And while you're wasting time in here with me, whoever manipulated him could be out there trying again. Did you ever think about that? - In some ways, Bruno, I envy you. When I was a child, I often fancied living the life of a daring cat burglar. Fortunately for me, yeah, at age of nine, on my maiden voyage, I fell off our neighbor's roof, yeah. Landed on my coccyx. And that was the end of that. You're lucky it ended so quickly. One time when I was in high school, I spent a night in jail for... Uh, for... Never mind. For what exactly, Mr. Palmer? Just-- it's funny, I-I said the word "jail." I meant to say, um... Vail. Yeah, I was-I was a big skier in high school. Were you now? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I loved the-I loved the, uh, snow. I loved-I loved, uh, skiing and-and... What I'd do is I'd- - Vail! You look like a man on a mission. Got an alibi for the murder. She was nowhere near Bruno when he was poisoned. Oh, and so it goes. Got us to thinking, maybe there's a second bomber. We could use a lead. Well, let's see what we can come up with. This man has told me quite a bit about himself. Starting with these burns. They're quite old, probably inflicted when he was a teenager. Military records indicate that his father died of lung cancer, excessive cigar smoking. Yeah, so we can put two and two together. He had a rough childhood. And also a rough week. Well, yeah. He's dead. Yes, but days before that, he was in a fight where he suffered severe body blows. If you look carefully, you can make out the imprint of a fist. Well, his knuckles don't look too bad. Yes, well, oddly enough, he didn't seem to fight back. Even more odd was the fact that we removed a diamond earring from this lobe. Well, men are piercing their ears now, Duck. Yes, but I'm referring to the fact that the hole was closed up from disuse. Yet he forced the earring in anyway. Ugh... That must've hurt like a mother. I'm sure it has some... psychological significance, but I'm not sure what. However, Abby came up with a second set of DNA on the earring. So, I imagine you'll find out soon enough. Well, is that a good enough lead for you? Hey, so, you're the world-famous Abby Sciuto I keep hearing so much about. Oh, well, guess we can skip the "I thought you'd be taller" part. I'm Agent Quinn. For what's it worth, I thought you would be exactly five feet, six inches. I made a 3D avatar of you, using NCIS security camera footage. And the hairs slowly went up on Agent Quinn's neck. Oh, no, no! I just... I needed to know your sizes, because... I'm knitting you a "Welcome to NCIS" sweater. Oh! But until it's done, welcome... to NCIS. Well, thank you very much. Do you want a tour? I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to... He wants to find out where the earring came from. Of course he does. Well, right now, all I can tell you is that the prior owner was a female. Okay, so do you know how long Bruno had it in his ear? I have been waiting for someone to ask me that. The impurities in the gold caused our victim's skin oil to oxidize. And by measuring that amount, I could determine that he forced the stud through his ear, like, right before he went into the reunion. To kill 50 people. Then was poisoned to death. Okay, so whoever owns the stud, maybe she knows something. Well, I'm running the DNA through CODIS right now. But I've also been looking at this, trying to find pictures of women. I found this in a trench coat in Bruno's closet. Unfortunately... no women yet. Huh. Are these the homes that he robbed? Yeah. Looks like he was casing them for a few days. There's also a few pictures of his feet... and some pictures of some other people that I haven't identified yet. Ho-Hold up. Go back one. That's Neal Sherwood. You know him? Well, he was at the reunion, and he had a fight with the victim right before he died. Well, that's important. Uh, yeah, because Neal said they hadn't seen each other in 15 years. Oh. Where is he? - With his suitcase, wherever that is. Neighbors said he split right after the reunion. - Left in a hurry. He's running. Quinn, BOLO. McGee, freeway cams and credit cards. Find him. - We found something. Abby got a hit on the DNA from the earring Bruno was wearing. - Katrina Cooper. A high school classmate of Bruno's. Former prom queen, married the school jock, active social life. How did Bruno get her earring? Could've stolen it, but if he did, she never reported it. They have any recent contact? No. No calls, no texts, no Snapchat doggie faces. The only connection we could find was from high school. They had a Saturday detention together, once. 15 years ago? Thin, I know. Talk to her. Find out why her DNA was in our dead guy's ear. Round two, everybody! We got soccer meatballs, lacrosse stick hot dogs... and pigskin pizza pockets. Who's hungry? - Mmm. I am. Hi. You must be here for Katrina. Why would you say that? That's what happens when you marry the most popular girl in town. Everybody's here for Katrina. Hmm. She's over there, in the huddle. They're like... little footballs. - And I told the guy, "Give me Louis Vuitton, or give me death." I got this. Okay. Um, Katrina Cooper? How you guys doing? You guys have fun? NCIS Special Agent Torres, Bishop. Hi. Can we have a word with you? Of course. Let's not disturb the party, shall we? Excuse me. Let's not do that. They're little footballs. They're good. - And how can I help you? Do you know this guy? Mm, no. Am I supposed to? Well, you guys went to high school together. Oh, in fact, he actually died in front of you. At your high school reunion, two days ago? Interestingly enough, wearing one of your earrings. It was stolen. Oh. You didn't report it stolen. I am now. You know, I bet you and me had something in common in high school. I don't think so. We both liked bad boys. The badder the better, except, I grew out of it. I don't think you did. Your husband know that you and Bruno have been sleeping together? Excuse me? What I'm wondering... is if you knew how bad Bruno really was. - You know, if he told you about, for the last several years, he's been robbing people in the city. Yeah, I think it's time for you to go. Cheers. Have one more question... No. No, no, no more questions. I don't know anything about any robberies, I'm not cheating on my husband and I have no idea where Neal Sherwood is. Okay? Well, that was actually my next question, which... I haven't asked yet. Oh, right. Hmm. Where is he? Get down! Found him. The cops are outside right now. It's over. To be honest, it's kind of a relief. I am willing to set the record straight, but I cannot go to prison. I just can't. I can't have it, my family... can't have it. So... I'm sorry. Shot himself with a flare gun. That's a new one. Did I miss the part where he set the record straight? Maybe it's on the laptop? Go-Go Abby fingers. Hey, so, um... You, um... liked bad boys in school, huh? I'm sorry, I just... I just painted for you for more of a goody two-shoes, uh, prom queen type. Actually, I... was the prom queen. Wow. So you played us both. Nice. Except, I was voted in as a joke. Kind of like Carrie, but... without the blood. Bishop, that's like... the worst thing I've ever heard. Yeah, I didn't have any friends in high school, I was too... me, I guess. I got something. Okay, it's a text document. Neal made it right before he shot himself. Looks like some kind of confession. It's even double-spaced and everything. - What exactly is he confessing to? - According to Neal, he and his high school friends are the ones behind Metro's theft ring. With each friend playing a very specific role. Adam Cooper, former jock, ended up running a sports betting company. That's where he would identify the wealthy marks. - Katrina Cooper, his prom queen wife, would flirt her way into the homes to get info on their security systems. Bad boy would do the actual robberies, and this woman, who we've now identified as former classmate, Angela Russell, would fence the stolen goods on the street where she lived. Finally, there's Neal Sherwood, the accountant. And he laundered the money. Yep. According to Neal, they came up with the idea to start a robbery gang back in school, after they met at a Saturday detention. - He said they talked about it as a joke at first, as a way to "get back" at their parents. Eventually they realized, if they pooled their talents, they could make some real money. - All of this seems very familiar. - Yeah... Yeah, I'm v-very interested in this case, here. We got five different high school kids from varied social backgrounds all coming together on their Saturdays, for detention. You know, it kind of reminds me of, uh... You've... You don't... Not important. Sorry. Anyway, the different social groups was part of the reason Metro was never able to crack the burglary ring. They were never able to find a connection between the players. Congratulations, we just solved Metro's case. What about our own? We have no clue who killed our victim! Actually, not true. The prom queen ain't talking, but the fence is. She thinks she knows who killed Bruno. Two days ago, your wife gave Bruno that earring. I don't believe you. Welcome to the club. You were the only one not at the reunion. You were the only one that had the opportunity to poison Bruno. Prosecutor's gonna file charges today, unless you have something to tell us. This isn't where I imagined I'd be after high school. Ah. Welcome to the club. I wanted to be a pro football player. You? Painter. Really. Really? Yeah. Really. Painter. Loved to paint. Watercolors, mostly. I took every art class that school had. Water colors? It's hard to imagine a grown man... So what happened? Life. Life. I paint with wood. It's close enough. Not for me. I suspected Katrina and Bruno had started up again, but I didn't want to believe it. But if she really gave him her earring it's game over for us. It's worse than that. I think that witch tried to kill me. The last house we knocked over, Bruno snagged a painting worth over a million bucks. My wife kept joking we should take out our partners, keep the money for ourselves. Said we should bomb the reunion, and make it look like a terrorist attack. I honestly thought she was joking. She must've talked Bruno into it. He was always a sucker for her. No way he would come up with something like that on his own. Hell, he was even gonna pretend to let Neal kick the crap out of him at the reunion as a goof, to impress some girls. Bruno was bad on the outside, but good on the inside. My wife? The opposite. What about you? All I can say is I'm not a murderer. I didn't kill Bruno, and I wasn't anywhere near him when he was poisoned. Hypothetically speaking, how would you feel about a betting pool on whether his alibi checks out? Hypothetically? How'd Ducky bet? Guilty. How'd you bet? I'm not a gambling man. And I have no idea. - I mean, who are these people? Living double lives like this? I mean, yeah, I mean, I... I lived as someone else, for the most of the last decade, but... I had an excuse, I was, uh... I was undercover. Which version is the real them? Which version is the real you? You're looking at it. Am I? You created all those covers. It wasn't random. Wait, you're saying that a part of me wanted to be a, uh, mafia-tied, vegan juice-bar owner? Eh... You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? You tried to kill us all! Oh, could everyone just please stop fighting? Shove a Pixy Stix up your nose! - McGee is taking them to Metro not a moment too soon. And Miss Congeniality denied having anything to do with the bomb attempt, even though we found the detonator in her car. Unfortunately, her husband's alibi came through. Like he said, he was nowhere near Bruno when he was poisoned. The fight with Neal was staged. - If none of them killed Bruno, then who the hell did? All right, let's go back to what we do know. He's dead. I feel pretty confident about that. What else do we know? We know who didn't kill him. And a million-dollar painting is missing. We find the painting, we find the killer. Checked everybody's houses. Nobody has it. Everyone insists Bruno has it. He didn't. He could've hid it. Maybe in a storage unit in the area. Yeah, safe-deposit box. Start looking. - All that work and we're back to square one. Tell me about it. What about the fight Ducky said he was in? Maybe he came back to finish the job. Our only witness is dead. Okay, what would I tell my students in my GPS forensics class? I would have them go back and reconstruct a timeline of Bruno's movements. Maybe we can find another witness. Do it. There goes my evening plans. Were they exciting plans? Uh, cooking class? Oh, well, don't cancel that just yet. You. I have goodies, come on. You know... Even though you just met her, you already kind of wish she was your sister? Well, I was just going to say I like her boots, but hey, I'll take another sister. I was finally able to trace the remote detonator that Bruno used in his explosive. It took me a long time because there are parts missing. Someone tampered with it? Yeah. And according to touch DNA, Bruno did. It's like he built this bomb, and then he disabled it. His girlfriend's remote detonator wouldn't have even worked. Bad on the outside, good on the inside. Maybe he got cold feet and decided he didn't want to be a depraved mass murderer after all. See, this is why I'm a people person. 'Cause the good on the inside, it always-- Abbs. Quinn... cooking class? Right. Sorry. Okay, so the receiver was made from a rare Lazarus 1941 hobby car. It's available in only two stores in the area, one of which happens to be across the street from a bank with a brand-new, hi-def security system. Voila, Bruno. His entrance isn't very exciting, but he made quite an exit. Personally, if I was looking for Bruno's murderer, I would start with that guy. Can you enhance it? Yeah. Who can't these days? - You found out Bruno was robbing people, you tracked him down, you asked to be cut in. When he refused, you went to his house the next day, and you poisoned him. Oh, yeah? Is that what I did? Yeah, that's what you did. What it's gonna look like to a jury. We have a witness that places you in his front yard. Where's the painting, Vic? The what? Wait, wait, wait. Slow down here. This is just a total misunderstanding, okay? I was at the hobby shop because I made a promise to James Bruno 15 years ago. To what, poison him to death? No, to kick his ass! I devoted my life to those kids. Bruno in particular. I spent eight weekends in a row in Saturday detention with that smug, arrogant little-- Actually the records say seven. Eight! It was eight! And all that kid did was blame other people for his problems, whining about his mom and his dad. Making my life miserable. So I promised him I would find him one day and pay him back. And that's what I did. I'm glad you're a man of your word. Judge all you want. I've been in combat. High school is worse, mister. Wait, no, wait, wait, wait! I did not go to Bruno's house to poison him, okay? I went to apologize. When I confronted Bruno, he didn't fight back. He seemed, like, resigned. Almost like he wanted me to hit him, like he deserved it. And that's not what I wanted. So I went to his house to say I was sorry. Anyone see you talk to him? Bruno wasn't there. Just that nasty old witch, Frimkes. She saw the bruise on my knuckles, figured I was the guy that beat up Bruno, and threatened to call the police. So I got the hell out of there. She saw that? Yeah. She did. Come on now, baby. Come on. I got my first pair of reading glasses when I was 45. But your medical records show that you have perfect eyesight, and hearing. Agent McGee, it's good to see you again. I-I was just, um-- Walking without a cane? No. Skipping town with a million-dollar painting? No! Going to jail. Dang! - So in addition to being a chemistry teacher who knew 50 different ways to poison somebody, she kept a pretty active retirement life. She totally Keyser Soze'd us. She what? Keyser Soze'd. Uh, Usual Suspects, the movie? Oh, I'm not much of a movie guy. You know, she told us on the drive back that she knew Bruno was a thief, but she didn't want to go to the police because he was trying to get clean. She claims she found the painting and was going to bring it back to the police. - Yeah, killed Bruno and kept the painting for herself. Whoa, whoa, what? Better. Better! Who... who... Who do you think? I kind of like it. I don't. Wait a sec, wha... what's the point of moving desks if were were just gonna move desks? Seriously, I mean to do something like this without consulting anyone? I am the senior field agent. You realize that... Boss, what was that for? It comes with the territory, Senior Field Agent. Did he just physically assault you? - Hey, Gibbs, I feel like you'll want to see this. We found a laptop in Bruno's car. He was writing an e-mail to the police. He was going to come clean, turn everyone in. Guess he figured which version was the real him. The good guy. I'm just not that into movies. So what do you do for fun, besides disrupting people's workplaces? Broadway musicals. Okay, if you start singing show tunes, I am going to shoot you, and then probably shoot myself. Oh, okay, well, what do you like to listen to? I thought you'd never ask. Ah. Go! Hey! - Hey, hey, hey! Hey. Boss. - Hey! Oh. Hey. Ha! Hey. He's gonna learn to love it. Shh. So many years, I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again. And then, I did. In a photo, in a briefing room. And I was being sent to meet him with a gun. This programme contains scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. When this is all done, Steve, I'll suffer for my actions. I'm under no illusions of a happy ending. Shot fired! What's he saying? He whispered something to you. What did he say? I'm not sure what he meant. My job is to find any and all evidence. And what was found in the case? A large number of banknotes. How did Detective Sergeant Arnott react? He didn't bat an eye. I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background. I'd like to keep digging. There's evidence of prolonged torture. Cause of death isn't clear. Cutting his head off can't have helped. This photograph shows Danny Waldron as a teenager. This man's a young Ronan Murphy, the suspect shot by Danny Waldron during Operation Damson. What? They knew each other? And this person bears a strong semblance to Linus Murphy's severed head. Danny knew him too. No prior information of the operation to move Tommy Hunter. I had no prior... knowledge. No prior knowledge, at all. Kate knows about me and Jackie and Danny. I've got to come clean to AC-12. The longer I leave it, the worse it looks. It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy. Rod's body was found hanged at an industrial unit. We need to talk. You are now declaring that PC Rod Kennedy killed Sergeant Daniel Waldron? Yes, sir. Rod killed Danny. Look, I'm sorry about this. It's just that I've got no-one else to talk to right now. It's fine. Look, mate, I don't think I can keep going into the station. All the stuff that's going on behind our backs. All the stuff that's going on to our faces. Yeah, well, Rod was a good bloke, weren't he? You know, people can't get their heads round it. Yeah. I can see why. Look, Jackie, don't do this to yourself. My hands were on that gun and I felt Rod force the trigger. He killed Danny. You know, we was right to stick together, you know, when he was here, but now he's gone. We've got to move on. Ah, come here. Superintendent Hastings. "Hi, sorry to bother you, sir." I just followed Jackie Brickford to a meeting with Hari Bains. "He seems pretty bloody shifty to me." Dot. Just so you know, I've authorised Kate to adopt direct surveillance on Hari Bains. Nice one, Gaffer. Yes, and I want Steve in on it too. Absolutely. Steve, get yourself get yourself over to South Ferry when Hari Bains comes on shift. Be visible. Sir. Come in. Inspector McAndrew, DS Arnott, AC-12. What do you want? In an interview gave at AC-12 you informed us that Hari Bains had a good working relationship with Danny Waldron. Yeah, so? Hari never made any complaints about Danny? If anything, the opposite. How so, Ma'am? I was due to rotate Hari from Danny's squad, but Hari said that he respected Danny's professionalism and wanted to ride on more jobs with him. Really? When did he say this? Couple of days before the Abbots Lane op. You mean a couple of days before the op that got Danny killed? I was all set to disband Danny's team after the shooting of Ronan Murphy and there is no way you're going to pin some blame on me just because you're struggling to find a scapegoat. Thank you, Ma'am. You've been very helpful. 'AC-12.' DC Fleming. Put me through to telecommunications, please. 'Telecoms.' DC Fleming. I need an identification on the last number dialled from a payphone on the corner of Calman Road and Turner Road. 'Stand by.' 'The number you have called is not recognised. Please check the number.' 'The number you have called is...' Kate reports Bains attempted to make a call to this number. It relates to an unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile. Now, the call couldn't be connected because either the phone or the SIM Card was out of service. I've got Maneet liaising with the mobile network provider to see what information we can get about the number. Great. Tell Kate I want her on Hari Bains round the clock. Yeah, will do, Gaffer. 'What the bloody hell are you playing at? 'Making a call from a public box? 'That's why we sent you the unregistered mobiles.' The text came through to my own phone, so I thought... 'Yeah, well, we had to get a message to you urgently 'and you weren't answering. You're being watched by AC-12.' I didn't see anyone. 'What did the text say? ' "Sit tight. Act normal." So how's this acting normal? Dickhead. All right? All right? Look, for my two penn'orth, I think we're flogging a dead horse with Bains and Brickford. Rod Kennedy killed Danny Waldron, couldn't handle the guilt, he topped himself. Maybe it wasn't suicide. We ought to request a second postmortem on Rod Kennedy's body. The first one was only looking for cause of death. We should get a Home Office pathologist looking for evidence of crime. Sure. Leave that with me. Cheers. Do you like chilli? The food. Not the country. I've got a pot... on the simmer. You've probably eaten. No, I haven't, actually. Well? Yeah. Not too fiery? I'll cope. If you go to the trouble of making a pot, you might as well make it last a few days, you know? One night, you can have it with rice. One night, baked potato... It's rock and roll, me. Well, I'm not complaining. By the time I knock off, the only thing that's open is a dodgy kebab. That's undercover, isn't it? Stupid hours. Well, Mark works in IT. He did a lot from home, which was great for childcare. Just not so great for us. You still see the kid, though? Yeah. Sorry, I shouldn't poke my nose in. No, it's fine. It was the right decision. You know, give him security and stability. Just not such a great decision for me, to be honest. See, me and my missus, we never got around to having kids. Was she a copper too? Forensics. I don't see much of her now. No? No, I was on the piss most nights. Couldn't pass a bookie's. Final straw was - we'd put down half on a fortnight in Majorca. Oh, don't tell me. Yeah, five-to-one. Dead cert. I couldn't go home to face the music, so... I took out a loan, put a grand down on the last race of the day, try and win it all back... Barrel of laughs, me, yeah. Can I have your bowl? Cheers. Hey, there's seconds here if you fancy? Any more and I won't get off this sofa. Yeah? I've got something for you, Sarge. "On that photo found at Danny's." Yeah, sure. It's from a boys' home called Sands View. Danny Waldron's mum died when he was 11, and he moved up north to live with his dad and stepmum, but that didn't work out and he got taken into care. Danny was a resident at Sands View from the age of 13 until he was 17. I keep going through the file. There's no link between Danny Waldron and Ronan Murphy while Danny was a police officer. The only link must be this boys' home. Unfortunately, I can't get hold of any records for that period. One council department told me they were lost in a fire, another told me they went missing during an office move. You think they've been lost on purpose? Who knows? The lads were chucked out at 17 and pretty much left to fend for themselves, with no follow-up. However, I've crosschecked with individuals known to the criminal justice system and I've got a name for you. Same age as Danny, so chances are they were there at the same time. Good work. Hey, Joe. Joe! Joseph Nash? Yeah? Can I talk to you somewhere quieter, please? Yeah. I'd like to show you a photograph, if that's all right. It's a photocopy of an original image believed to be approximately 15 to 20 years old. Do you recognise the image? Yeah. Do you recall the name of this location? Yes. Mr Nash, you're not in any trouble. How did you find out my name? I'm not going to lie. You committed a number of minor offences. Look, I was just a kid, back then. I've put my life back together now. The convictions are spent. It was only that your record crosschecked with an enquiry I'm involved with. An enquiry into Sands View? Connected to Sands View. Do you recognise this individual? Yes, Danny. Danny Waldron. Yeah. Do you recognise this individual? Yes. What do you remember about that person? He took us for football on a Tuesday afternoon. He was one of the staff? No, he just took us for footie. What else do you recall about him? You're being a big help, Joe. Is it OK if I ask you about one more person? This man, here. Him. Who is he? Mr Murphy. He was the caretaker. The other man. The football coach. Was his name Murphy too? Might have been. They was a pair. A pair? The older one, the caretaker, he had the keys. For the dormitories. Changing rooms, the basement. But him, the younger one he was in on it too. With the others. What others? Just... Not in the photo. Visitors. We got told they were very important people and we had to do exactly... what they said. Did you ever get the names of any of these people? No. No-one ever got any names. And even if we did, it was just... Mr Smith. What happened with these visitors? Well, sometimes they'd they'd come to the home and we'd be told it was like a private interview. "Mr Smith can be a big help to you when you move on," sort of thing. You know? And then you go to a room with Mr Smith. Or a few of you would. With a few of them. The abuse always took place within Sands View? No, not always. There was, erm... sometimes there'd be a car or a minibus and they'd take us to a hotel, or a guesthouse, or some big some big private home. You know? But the parties... The parties, they were the worst. Parties? There'd be a few of them, these, these VIPs... And we'd be farmed out. Do you recall any details in terms of names, addresses, or the people who drove you to and from these parties? This was a long time ago, all right, mate? And I wish I could remember that information and forget about the rest, but it's the opposite. I know this is hard, Joe. Is there anything you can tell me about these individuals that might help identify them? Yeah, there's one of them... stands out. He's a... He's a big... big fat whale of a fella. He always wore a suit. And when he took the suit jacket off, he always had these, these, these sweat patches and... he stank of it. And when I got told he'd asked for me again, I'd... I'd throw up, you know? I'd be sick. Is Danny the one? The one? Yeah. He's got people listening to us, at last. Yeah. Yeah, he is. Arnott. Any report yet on the second PM? What second PM? Dot said he was organising a second postmortem on Rod Kennedy. First I've heard of it. Leave it with me. OK, I'll head back to South Ferry. Right, I'll tell her. Francis, that was your rep. AC-12 want you in for interview straight away. She doesn't know anything. She never believed us, not for a minute. Jackie, she weren't in the room when Danny was shot. But he whispered something to her as he was dying. Yeah. And if he managed to tell her the truth, do you think she would've kept quiet this whole time? No. Trust me, she don't know anything. Yeah? All right, mate. I've continued to search records relating to Sands View. Our witness, Joseph Nash, claims a number of his abusers were VIPs, all of whom used the same alias, Mr Smith. Hence Nash wasn't able to give us any names. But he did claim one of these abusers was extremely obese. Sports day at Sands View. Who is he? Dale Roach. He was leader of the city council during the period Danny Waldron and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View. Is this the man, Joe? Yeah, that's him. Thank you. Now, it would help if you would come to my department and look through some images of other individuals... Joe, I came from a loving family. Had a nice childhood and I can't begin to imagine what yours must have been like. 20 years it's took you to come here. I want to help. 20 years... I've had that monster in my head. The sounds he made, the smell of him. And the things that he did to us at Sands View... No copper ever gave a toss. Are you saying offences committed at Sands View were reported to police and no action was taken? We told teachers, we told social workers, and yeah we told coppers. And then, we learned not to. Danny Waldron's dead, Joe. He was killed because he was going after the people who did this to you. Danny's mission is now my mission. And I promise you, I will get these bastards. Daddy! Daddy! Hey! Hello, you! Is that for me? Mm-hm. Well, thank you very much. And I will always, always love you, OK? Mm-hm. Come here. How long has he been here? I'd have to check. Two or three years at least. Any family? No family, no visitors. Mr Roach. Mr Roach? ! Can he hear me? He doesn't understand much. He can't talk. What's wrong with him? Massive stroke. Sorry, do you need me to stay? No. Thank you. Call if you need me. Mr Roach, do you recognise the name "Sands View Boys' Home"? Mr Roach? I'm Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott. I'm investigating claims relating to Sands View. Do you understand me? ! Danny Waldron recognised Ronan Murphy as an occasional sports volunteer at Sands View Boys' Home. Somehow, from Ronan, he was able to track down Linus Murphy. Linus was the caretaker at Sands View and used his position to include Ronan, his nephew, in his activities. Now, a witness has given us another name - Dale Roach. Councillor Dale Roach. Unfortunately, Roach isn't fit to stand trial. I think Danny Waldron purposefully created a trail of evidence that led us to connect him to Linus Murphy's murder. And now, we're on the trail of the other abusers. There is only one thing we are interested in here, son, and one thing only. And that's bent coppers. The boys made complaints. Some allegedly to police officers. Thank you, Steve. Sir. Hi. Kate? Come in. Something wrong? You didn't come back to the station. By the time I'd finished with AC-12, my shift was over. So, what's going on? They just wanted to go over the details of the day Danny was killed, times, places. You know what they're like, fishing for inconsistencies. Anything they can pounce on. And did they? Did they what? Pounce. We shouldn't talk about this. What did you tell them, Kate? We can't have this conversation. You should leave. I need to know! You keep asking me to leave you alone. Congratulations, you're on your own. What do they know, Kate? You should go. What do they know? They're onto the pair of you. What about us? They know Hari stopped McAndrew from disbanding Danny's squad. What? ! I never knew anything about that! And they know about the phone calls. What phone calls? Yeah, right "What phone calls?" Bye, Jackie. What phone calls, Kate? ! They've got Hari making calls from a phone box to an unregistered pay-as-you-go number. They know it must be a phone you're using covertly. You two are in collusion, and developing your strategy using untraceable telephone calls. It's not me he's been calling. Stay here, I'll get it. So, what's up, then? Who've you been calling? What? AC-12 know you've been making dodgy calls. They think I'm in on it! All this time, we trusted you. It was just the three of us. Now, Rod's dead and that still isn't the end of it! Jackie, what are you...? Who have you been making those calls to? What aren't you telling me? ! I haven't been making any calls, all right? It's just me and you, and as long as we stick together, then... Jackie, I've been telling you the truth. Yeah, I'm sorry, I know it's late. I need to go in and see AC-12 and I'm going to need your solicitor. Stand away from the door. Ms Denton, you remain under oath. Thank you, milady. Ms Denton... In your examination-in-chief, by your own counsel, you made a number of references to an undercover operation conducted by a Detective Sergeant Arnott of Anti-Corruption Unit 12. Yes, I did. Did any of these operations involve Detective Sergeant Arnott being present at your home? Some did. You were alone with Detective Sergeant Arnott? Sometimes. And on all these occasions, there were no other police officers in the vicinity? There was a constable stationed outside the house. Where outside? On the doorstep. And where did sexual relations take place? In the bedroom. And how was the bedroom accessed? Via the stairs. And how far do the stairs lie from the front door? I don't know, three or four metres from the front door. From the plans of your home obtained by the prosecution, the distance is... 2.7 metres. If you say so. I don't "say so", it's a fact. And if I'm inaccurate, I'll be corrected. There are written statements by all the officers stationed outside the door in early October, and not one recalls hearing you and Detective Sergeant Arnott go upstairs together. Well, that doesn't surprise me. It doesn't surprise you that trained police officers on guard duty, in a high state of vigilance, don't hear the two of you go upstairs for sex when he or she is less than three metres away? We were discreet. Hmm. You've told the jury that this intimacy with Detective Sergeant Arnott won your trust and, therefore, you permitted him unsupervised access to your home. There were times when I was napping or in the bath or the shower and he was free to roam the premises. I trusted him completely. And you've alleged that on one of these occasions, Detective Sergeant Arnott planted a sum of money in your late mother's overnight case. Did you witness Detective Sergeant Arnott bringing the £50,000 into your home? No. Did you ever witness Detective Sergeant Arnott having access to tens of thousands of pounds in cash? He'd hardly do it openly. Corrupt officers have access to criminal contacts. Please answer the question you've been asked. Did you ever witness Detective Sergeant Arnott with such an enormous sum... of cash? I don't know how Steve Arnott got hold of the money and then got it into my house. Ms Denton, you've answered. And I'm still answering. If I'm in accurate, I'll be corrected. Steve Arnott had my complete trust and the trust of the officers on guard duty. He could easily have picked his moment to plant the money and I firmly believe that that is the best explanation for how it came to be there. Because I had never seen that money before. Were you aware that you were under investigation by Anti-Corruption Unit 12? Yes, I was. And were you cooperating with that investigation? Yes, I was. You were being completely honest, to the best of your knowledge, in assisting them with their enquiries? Yes, I was. And had you always been completely honest with Anti-Corruption Unit 12? Please answer, Ms Denton. It was a complex case and there were many details that were elusive and, at times, required further thought and examination before I could give a definitive answer. Did you lie in relation to matters surrounding the conspiracy to murder Tommy Hunter? Ms Denton. As I said, it was a complex case, and many details were difficult to define or recollect. Did you lie about having prior knowledge of Hunter? No. You lied about having prior knowledge of Hunter, didn't you? No. You told the investigators lie after lie to confound them, and to pervert the course of justice, didn't you? It wasn't like that. It was like that. You wove a web of deceit to confound the investigators and to protect yourself, and you have the effrontery to attempt to deceive this jury. No! Did you fabricate the improper relations between you and Detective Sergeant Arnott? No. Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you? No. Lindsay Denton, aren't you an artful, devious person, who has betrayed the trust placed in her as a police officer... No. ...and haven't you repeatedly and shamelessly connived to obstruct those who would bring you to justice? NO, I HAVEN'T! Watching that circus really turned my stomach. Listen, I owe you an apology for the other night. Your... dinner invitation. You're a married man. This is it. But here we are, two colleagues having a drink, and the sky hasn't fallen in yet. Yeah. This is a voluntary interview by authorised firearms officer Victor Charlie 53 in the presence of her Police Federation representative and solicitor, by Superintendent Hastings and DS Arnott. I want to cooperate. I want to go on record that I have never, at any time, engaged with any other officer in covert telecommunications to knowingly mislead lawful enquiries. Glad to hear it. I also want to clarify some details... of previous statements made regarding the death of Sergeant Daniel Waldron. Very good. Carry on. I never saw the exact moment the struggle started. The struggle for the gun that killed Daniel Waldron. Neither did Rod. We had to rely on what Hari... On what 54 told us. He said that Danny had entered the room with his firearm drawn and that he'd turned the gun on 54. So, you're saying Danny tried to kill 54? I'm saying that's only what 54 told us. He said that Danny turned the gun on him. 54 made a grab for the firearm to stop Danny from shooting him. There was a struggle for the gun, Rod and I joined in that struggle. The gun went off and killed Danny. Hold on a second, Constable, this is going way beyond clarifying a statement. I mean, you are changing your story all over again, here. This is the truth, sir. Well, you need to take a deep breath and we need to caution you. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be used in evidence. Do you understand? I understand. So, now you're saying that Danny wasn't trying to kill himself. He was trying to kill VC 54, or so 54 claims? Yes, sir. That seemed plausible. Why? Danny was bullying us into covering for him after he shot a suspect. He moved the suspect's firearm, and then, he discharged the weapon narrowly missing 54. What, you conspired with Daniel Waldron to provide false statements regarding the shooting? Yes, sir. We were all really scared of Danny. There was a part of him that was capable of doing anything. So, you killed him? No! It seemed like an accident. 54 convinced me and Rod that if we said that we'd killed Danny in self-defence, that the least we'd be looking at would be manslaughter. He told us to claim that we were trying to save Danny and that way, nobody could blame us for his death. Yes, but instead of telling the truth, the three of you went off and concocted a whole new version of events. And then, you decided to blame Rod Kennedy for Danny's death. I knew Rod was jealous of Danny. It seemed plausible that he could have been the one. You don't believe that any more? No, sir. 54 initiated the struggle with that gun. And it's only his word for it that it was self-defence. I just don't believe him any more. I can't cover for 54 any longer. He convinced me... to blame Rod. But I'm not sure that Rod could have killed Danny. He wasn't that sort of man. I betrayed him. Constable, you have my sincere condolences for the deaths of your colleagues. However, we have a job to do, and that job requires us to investigate thoroughly and impartially the murder of one of our own. And whilst we appreciate your cooperation here today, you have knowingly misled this enquiry for weeks on matters of the utmost gravity. Firstly, in respect of the shooting dead of a suspect. Secondly, in respect of the loss of life of an officer in the line of duty, the withholding of crucial information, the blatant disregard from your lawful duty as a police officer to comply with a criminal investigation, and therefore, I am submitting to the Police Board, that you be served with a red notice which is the termination of your contract as a police officer. And moreover, I will report to the Crown Prosecutor regarding perverting the course of justice and assisting an offender. Now, you won't be charged at this time, however, pending my discussion with the Crown Prosecutor, you may be charged with these offences. But I thought if I cooperated, that you'd go easier on me? A suspension? A yellow notice? A fellow officer has been killed. There is no more serious offence that we investigate. Now, you may think I am harsh, Constable but, I know that this is justice. All rise. Foreman of the jury, please stand. Have you reached a verdict upon which you are all agreed? No, we have not. In these circumstances, I am willing to accept a majority verdict upon which ten or more of you agree. Yes, milady. All rise. Pick. A or B? A. The report from the second PM on PC Kennedy. Yeah. Boss, sorry, I thought this shouldn't wait. Yeah, come on. This something I should know about, Gaffer? Yeah, why don't you bring the whole bloody office with you? Sorry, sir. The pathologist revised the findings on Rod Kennedy's postmortem. She's admitted that they screwed up on the first one? Well, the findings are subtle. But there's a superficial head injury. Bruising was hidden under scalp hair at the back of the head and minor defensive wounds on the hands. Again, very subtle. Unfortunately, no organic material recovered from under the fingernails. None of this is very strong. No, but I went back over the forensics, and there were foreign fibres in Kennedy's clothing. Again, not strong. Similar fibres were found in Kennedy's nose and mouth at the second PM. Right. Best guess, someone smothered him, and then hanged him while he was unconscious. Well, if Bains killed Danny, I'll lay you evens he killed Kennedy, as well. I need to show you this. Traffic camera vid-caps from the night of Rod Kennedy's death. This camera is located less than half a mile from the industrial estate. This registration matches a vehicle registered to... Harinderpal Bains. It's definitely gone over the threshold for our friend, PC Hari Bains. Bring him in, Steve. Good call, Gaffer. Sir. What happened with the postmortem? Weren't you supposed to organise it? Yeah, listen, I sent the e-mail, but I only just saw this morning, it bounced back from the pathologist's office. Right. Steve, you're a life-saver. Maneet, get me a update on Hari Bain's whereabouts. Urgent. Telecoms. I'll get hold of Kate and see if she's on his tail. We need an urgent triangulation on a suspect's mobile phone. Telephone number, 07591152689. Yeah. He's at or near home. Right, could I have concealed firearms. Organise armed backup. Telecoms triangulation places Hari Bains at his home address. We understand that his wife and one child reside at this same address. What? PC Francis is in Bains's squad. She shouldn't be here. Correct. Thank you. Francis? Sir. DI Cottan. I've been bumped off the op. Too close to Bains. I need to be in on this, Dot. Can you make a call? 'No.' This is too dangerous. I want you out of it. Oh, for Christ's sake, Dot! Sorry, Kate. Set aside that this is one of our own. Hari Bains is potentially armed and is considered to be extremely dangerous. Let's get this done. Hello. Kate, you were right about the PM. Rod Kennedy, he was murdered. Hello? 'You're being fitted up for murdering Rod Kennedy.' No, he was fine when I left him. 'Do you hear how guilty you sound already? ' I don't know what to do. 'Well, I do this for a living.' If you want a way out, you'll listen to me. Where's your DI? On his way. Then I'm the ranking officer. We need Bains alive for information on the murder of Danny Waldron. Armed police! Come out with your hands above your head! Coming out! Where's Hari? I don't know. He went into the garage. Can you open it? The keys are on the side. Get her out of here. Hari, it's McAndrew! We're opening the garage door. It's jammed. Wait! Clear! Open it. Don't touch the phone. - Arnott. - 'I've got eyes on Hari Bains. 'He's just entered the industrial unit 'where Rod Kennedy's body was found.' Look, he's probably armed. Don't move until I bring backup. 'I'm not daft. I'm going to stay well out of it.' Thanks, they're on their way. Come here, come here. Secure that phone. I've got obs on Bains. Follow me! Kate, I got obs on Bains. I'm en route to the industrial unit where Rod Kennedy was found. Cheers, Steve, I'm on my way. Seriously? Of all the places to run, mate. Where are you going, now? What are you doing here? I'm just minding my own business. Re-examining an old crime scene. You expecting someone else? Who? Don't know what you're on about, mate. Well, have it your own way. I was just trying to give you a chance before the circus arrives! A chance of what? The way I see it, it's your word against Jackie Brickford's. Now, if you're seen to be cooperating with the enquiry, then... it doesn't take a genius to figure out who they'll believe, eh? Listen, boy, I don't trust you as far as I can throw you. This is where your mate Rod died. We've just had the postmortem report in. He was murdered. You see, that's what I'm doing here. You...? Well, that's not very clever, is it? Returning to the scene of the crime. I had nothing to do with that. I believe you, mate. I do. And frankly, between the two of us, the forensics aren't that strong. But will Hastings? Hm? Will the CPS? See, this is that chance I was talking about. Now, starting with Danny Waldron, before he died, did he ever confide anything to you about those two pervs he killed? No, he never said owt. You think carefully. Ronan Murphy and Linus Murphy were the blokes he killed. Did he ever mention any other names? Politicians? Coppers? No. Think. Tommy Hunter and Lindsay Denton. What would Danny have to say about them? All right. So, who are you here to meet? I don't know. I never met him. I don't know anything about him. Nothing. No, nothing. Have it your own way, mate. Look, you don't understand. What don't I understand? ! Man, I'm just small fry. Steady. It's just my phone. Look, it's unregistered. They can't trace it. I'll call them for you now, yeah? Yeah. 'The number you have called is not recognised. Please check the number. 'The number you have called is not recognised. Please check the number. 'The number you have called...' There is no bloke. It's all you! You killed Danny Waldron. You persuaded your mates to lie about it, and then, when Rod Kennedy wanted to come clean, you killed him? No, none of that's true. I never killed Rod. Go! Armed police! AC-12, don't shoot! Stay down, hands behind your head! Cuff him! .. You OK, Dot? Yeah. Harinderpal Bains, I'm arresting you for the murder of Roderick Kennedy. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say, may be used in evidence. Key. What the hell are you doing here, Francis? DC Fleming, Ma'am. AC-12. What happened? Just take a look. When I got here, Bains jumped me. You know, he was going to string me up the same way he did Rod Kennedy. I shouldn't have gone in without backup, sir. I just didn't want him to get away, you know? Well, nobody's going to question your judgment. You did a grand job, son. Now, take yourself off to the hospital and get yourself a checkup. Go on, off you go. Cheers, Gaffer. Yeah. Inspector, we're going to take this man into our custody, but I'd like you to give us one of your crews to ride shotgun. Yes, sir. You're lucky AC-12 got to you first. My team, we're following! The rest of you, back to the station. Youheardtheguv . Have you anything to say? Take him away. Steve... You OK, Dot? Yeah, I'll live. Minor facial injury... Jury's coming back. You're free to come in, if you want. I'll wait here. Will the defendant please stand? Will the foreman of the jury please stand? A search of Hari Bains' home uncovered a cache of mobile phones. All of the unregistered, pay-as-you-go variety. Finding these phones allowed us to examine their call history. Hari Bains received a call the night before going to Inspector McAndrew and volunteering to stay on Danny's squad. And who was the call from? Well, unfortunately, it was also an unregistered pay-as-you-go phone, and said phone is no longer in history. Same MO as the recent text Bains received, telling him to sit tight. Three days later, there's another call from the same number. That was the night before Bains murdered Danny Waldron. You think they're connected? Well, if they are, sir, it means somebody's been pulling the strings. Someone who ordered Danny's murder. Well done, Dot! Welcome back, Dot! Thanks, Gaffer. Great work, sir. Cheers. On the charge of conspiracy to murder, have you reached a verdict upon which at least ten of you agree? We have. What is your verdict? Not guilty. On the (Pops) (Clattering, cell phone rings) (Ringing continues) (Lisbon) Jane. Hello, Lisbon. Jane, don't do this, not without me. Listen, I'm sorry. Jane, I am begging you. You're in danger! I-it's gonna be okay. I-I'm gonna be okay. No, you're not. You do this, and you're throwing your life away. Bye, Lisbon. Jane... no.

Yes. That we can use to identify Red John? Yes. That's great. So all we have to do is check each one of the suspects one by one until we find out who has the tattoo. No. Why not? Red John doesn't know I know about the tattoo. Okay. So if we start checking suspects, it's very likely that Red John will find out. And disappear before we have a chance of getting him. Exactly. Then what do you want to do? Gather all five suspects together at the same place, same time, and then start checking for the tattoo. And how do we do that? We'll ask them. And you think they'll agree? Wasn't planning on giving them a choice. (Groans) Even so, there's a problem. Bret Stiles--he's wanted by the F.B.I. In connection to two homicides. Yeah. Cold cases from over 20 years ago. You're kidding. After all this time, the F.B.I. is moving in now? Well, they must have found something new-- forensics, a witness. Well, where's Stiles? Well, that's the thing. Nobody knows, not even the F.B.I. Stiles disappeared weeks ago. We'll find him. How? I don't know, but we'll find him. We have to. I'm on board with your plan. Good. On one condition. I want to be there when you reveal Red John. Okay. Seriously. I said okay. Yeah, but you didn't mean it. Did I not? Uh, how can you tell? This is non-negotiable, Jane. I agree 100%. I think I've made myself clear, agents. I have no knowledge of Bret Stiles' whereabouts. You have to cooperate. Yes, and we've made it clear that we're not buying it. Stiles leaves you in charge of Visualize, but he keeps you in the dark about where he's hiding? Doesn't make sense. Stiles has and always will put the church's needs before his own. This time is no different. He doesn't want me to know because he wants to protect me. And because he doesn't want to be found. I doubt Bret Stiles is worried about being found. You seem confident. Call it faith. You see, Stiles' time in our... reality is limited. Huh? As we speak, he's preparing his mind and body for a departure from the confines of our material world. He's dying? That is a very naive, very ignorant way of looking at it. Bret Stiles is not dying. Bret Stiles cannot die. He is elevating himself to another plane, one lesser men like ourselves can only strive to reach. And one some of us obviously can't comprehend. (Horns honking in distance) (Police radio chatter) Coffee--one cream, one sugar. Thanks, Russell. Forensics is here when you're ready. Send them over. Get his I.D. for me, will you? You know how I am about heights. Sure. Oh, and, uh, someone's here to see you. Thanks. There's been a breakthrough in the Red John investigation. I have some new information. Some very significant information. Okay. What is it? No, no. Not yet. I'm not sure who I can trust. I'm not even sure I can trust you. Red John has some very powerful allies. Patrick, come on. (Speaking indistinctly) Okay, but not here. Meet me at 8:00 on Thursday night. Thursday? Why? I need time to find a safe place to meet. Fine. Where? I'll let you know the day of. This is crazy. I've made the mistake of underestimating Red John a number of times now. I don't want to make that mistake again. If you want the information, it's on my terms. Okay. Thursday night. (Crickets chirping) (Cocks gun) (Scope clicking) (Cell phone rings) (Hoofbeats retreating) (Ringing continues) (Sighs) (Beeps) This is Sheriff McAllister. Sheriff? Patrick Jane. Hello, Patrick. How are things? Good. Good. I'm calling because I had a question. Shoot. Last month when I was in Napa, you said that you were at my disposal. Yes, I remember. Did you mean what you said? I like to think I'm a man of my word. Oh, I don't doubt it. But can I count on you for your help? Can I count on you? (Exhales) Of course. Thursday night at 8:00 I'll need your help. Well, then you've got it. Thank you. I'll let you know where to be the day of. Patrick? Yeah? This is about Red John, isn't it? Thursday night. (Exhales) They're ready for you, sir.

Yes, well, it's very lucky for you my job is to fix problems, so here's what you're gonna do. You are gonna write her a check-- it is gonna be a a very big check-- and then you are gonna pray that this problem goes away. If it doesn't, don't worry, Don. There are plenty of ways to keep a woman quiet. Okay? All right. I gotta go. All right. (Indistinct conversations) Hello. You're late. It's good to see you, too, Teresa. Uh, excuse me, can I get coffee, black, please? Thanks. So why am I here at 8:00 a.m.? I need help with an investigation. What investigation? It's not important. Really? It is if you want my help. I can't tell you. Come on, Teresa. I know you better than that. What, you and Jane got something going on with the Red John case? Maybe. "Maybe." Yeah, right. (Inhales sharply) What is with all the secrecy? Seriously, why are you always holding out on me? You don't think I'm Red John, do you? You do, don't you? Tell you what. You want to question me, you arrest me. Otherwise, you leave me the hell out of this. Sit down. Sit. If asking's not gonna work, I won't ask. You're no longer with the CBI. You don't get the same protection law enforcement gets. What, you threatening me? No, Jane is. He wants to see you tomorrow night. (Sets coffee cup down) If you don't show up, he will assume you are Red John. And, Ray, he will come after you. You gotta be kidding me. You know Jane. You know what happened to him. You know what Red John did to him. If I were you, I wouldn't test him. I'm not afraid of Patrick Jane. Well, what's the problem with showing up? If I do this, will you and Jane drop the whole that "I'm Red John" business? For once and for all. What time? 8:00. I'm not done. There's one more thing that I need. (Sighs) You're killing me here. Stiles. Yeah? Where is he? I can't help you. Come on, Ray, you've been with Visualize for years. I don't want to arrest him. I just want to talk to him. You do this, and I will owe you. And in your line of work, sooner or later you're gonna need a favor. So Ray Haffner told me that Stiles uses a private jet to move around the country undetected. Belongs to a guy named Ryan Parks. Parks. Got it. I'll check it out. Has Jane been in yet? No, I haven't heard from him. (Knocks on door) (Speaking inaudibly) (Engines whirring) Mr. Lamotte? Yeah? Can I help you? Agents Cho and Rigsby from the CBI. We were wondering if you could answer a few questions for us. Sure. A G6 landed here late last night, tail number N550MT. It would have been around 11:00. I remember. What about it? Do you know who was on the flight? No. Private aircraft aren't required to provide passenger manifests. Did you happen to see anyone who was getting off the plane? No. Sorry. Oh, but whoever it was had a car service pick him up. They might be able to help you. You don't happen to have the name of that car service, by any chance? Yes I do. So what happened with the car service? Well, they said that they picked up a silver-haired man with a British accent from the airport last night. Stiles. We think so. Well, where'd he go? The address was for the Ecuadorian consulate in San Francisco. Good job. You two go and check it out. You know what? Van Pelt, why don't you go alone? Stiles likes you. Maybe we can use that to our advantage. Is... there a problem? Uh, no. No. I'll be fine. I know. It's my job. I know. Hey. I love you. I know. (Door creaks) (Speaks indistinctly) (Door closes) (Cell phone ringing) (Beep) Hey, Lisbon. Where are you? Oh, just running some errands. Everything okay? Yeah, right as rain. What's up? Haffner's in. Good. What about Stiles? Van Pelt may have a bead on his location. She's checking it out now. That leaves one more Red John suspect left to talk to. Yes. Bertram. I'm on my way to his office. You want to meet me there? All right. (Line clicks, snaps phone shut) Grace Van Pelt. Well... how lovely to see you again. (Chuckles) (Kisses twice) Mmm. Wow. Well... so, please sit. What do I owe this pleasure? Jane. He needs a favor. Oh. Clever, him, sending you. So exactly what can I do for Patrick Jane? (Exhales) He would like to meet with you. Tomorrow night at 8:00. You've changed since we last met. You're married. Yes. Oh, don't tell me you married that genial oaf. Oh. Oh, well. (Chuckles) Congratulations. Yeah. Thank you. So... will you meet with Jane? Ah... you know, nothing would please me more than to meet with him. I mean, really, I would love to. But... (Inhales sharply) Unfortunately, my circumstances-- it's probably not gonna happen. You mean because of the F.B.I.? Mm. You have been doing your homework. (Chuckles) They don't know I'm here. Ah. Which means they don't know you're here. But they will if you don't agree to meet with Jane. You have changed, haven't you? Have you ever been to Ecuador, by any chance? No. Oh. I was there--oh, God, years and years ago doing missionary work. Uh... Lovely people. Oh, yeah, but-but-- there was a young man there... He was underprivileged, ferociously ambitious. I saw something in him. So I decided to try and help him. You know, I-I paid for his school fees, that sort of thing. N-nothing really much, but wouldn't you know it? All these years later, that same man is now minister of state. I'm happy for him. Anyway, he invited me to stay in this palatial consulate. This morsel of foreign soil. Foreign soil, which, as you know, is outside the jurisdiction of you, the F.B.I., and all U.S. law enforcement. So, you see, Gracie, your idle threats are just that. Well, it's been so lovely seeing you again. (Clears throat) Please give my best to Mr. Jane. (Chuckles) Close the door on your way out! (Chuckles) It's gonna be fine. Thanks. I feel a lot better. (Knocks on door) Come on in. We've made a breakthrough, sir. In... The Red John case. We're close to identifying him. Well, then this is fantastic news. (Chuckles) After all these years. Y-you-- you really think you've got him? I do. I'll know the second you have something concrete. You will, sir. And I want to be there when you end this. I was hoping you'd say that. (Whistling) (Continues whistling) (Dialing) (Continues whistling) Yeah, it's me. I just had a very interesting conversation with Patrick Jane. How'd it go with Bertram? He's in. What about Stiles? Not so good. Did you find him? Yes. (Exhales) Then what's the problem? Mm. He's at the Ecuadorian consulate. As long as he's there, we can't touch him. What do you want to do? I'll handle Stiles. He's not gonna come with you. He doesn't have to. I'll be persuasive. What is that? (Exhales) (Closes tube) You sure it's big enough? We need to talk about tomorrow night. I've already told you. Just hear me out, please. You don't want me to be there. No, I don't. You don't want to be there because you think I'm gonna try and stop you from killing Red John. Are you saying that you won't? What I'm saying is some men-- men like Red John-- they don't deserve a trial. They don't deserve a jury. They deserve what they have coming to them. Wait, l-let me get this straight. After close to 20 years working in law enforcement, you're just-- you're changing your mind? About Red John? Yes. I'm surprised, Lisbon. What, you don't believe me? Heavens, no. You're the most honest person I know. You would never lie, not about something like this. Right? Right. Tomorrow night then. Tomorrow night. (Door closes) Patrick, dear boy. Well, how are you? Well, I'm not your boy. Oh, I see. So this is not a social meeting, eh? You're gonna meet me tonight at 8:00. Patrick-- No, you listen to me. You're gonna meet me tonight at 8:00, or I'm gonna come back here, and when I do, you will need more than these walls to keep you safe. Threats? Oh. That's so out of character. I mean every word of it. Yes. I believe you do. But you see, Patrick, a dying man does not fear death. Oh, please. This charade might work on your disciples. It doesn't work on me. You think too highly of me. Unfortunately, it's not a charade. How long have you got? It's spread to the blood. There's nothing they can do. I don't know... Two weeks, a month. You see... It's not personal. It's just that... My time now is very precious. I'm still gonna need you tonight. For God sake, why? What's so damned important? Red John. I'm close. (Exhales) Closer than I've ever been. (Chuckles softly) Red John... Look... Nothing would give me more pleasure than to be with you there tonight. But? There's more to this than you know. There's--there's more keeping me here. The F.B.I.? Yeah, as a matter of fact. You know, they tracked me here. They're just waiting for me to leave so they can arrest me. Look, I'm not choosing to stay here, but I'm trapped. So the F.B.I.'s the only thing that's keeping you here? (Radio static chirps) (Man on radio) We've got movement. (Man) That's a Visualize car.

This is Agent Teresa Lisbon with the California Bureau of Investigation. I need officers at 1309 Cedar Street in Malibu. I have an agent who needs immediate assistance. I brought you five together for a reason. Some of you may know that reason. Some of you may have guessed. But one of you here... is Red John. (Smith chuckling) What? ! One of us? (Continues chuckling) (Chuckling) One of us here is Red John? Well, that's very interesting. (Chuckles) Who is it? I don't know. And that's what we're gonna find out. Wait, you're trying to say that one of us in this room... (Sighs) Is a serial killer? I know it. No, this is crazy. I can assure you it's not. Well, I can assure you I'm not sticking around for this crap. (Pumps shotgun) Sit down. Do not move toward the door. No one is leaving. Take it easy, Patrick. Do I look distressed? Don't. I will shoot you. That goes for the rest of you as well. Take out your weapons slowly, place them on the floor, and push them toward me. (Unfastening holster) (Gun rests on ground) Thank you. Thank you. (Kicking guns away softly) (Gun clatters) Okay, Patrick. This is... This is enough. It's gone far enough. No, we're just getting started. I've waited ten years for this moment. All those years, Red John has been smart. One of you has been smart. Careful. But not this time. This time, you made a mistake. Kira Tinsley told me something before she passed. She told me that her killer-- Red John-- has a tattoo. Three dots on his left arm. On his shoulder. And you all... Are gonna show me... Now. Let's go. Come on. That's it. Take it off. Nonsense. Very good. It's not what you think. You got it wrong. I'm not Red John. Patrick, wait. Patrick! Look... here. Look. On your feet. Over with those two. Oh... God. (Inhales sharply) You stay there. Okay, you three... Over against that wall-- now. (Loud gunshot) (Engine roaring) (Tires screech, horn honks) Jane! (Explosion) Aah! Aah! (Flames crackling) == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Daffy! You don't gotta shout. I'm right here, man. - Why are there lobsters in my swimming pool? - Because your bathtub wasn't big enough. There you go. Just like the ocean. - Why do you have lobsters at all? - I'm gonna sell 'em. Lobsters go for $20 a pound. I bet this chubber bubber will fetch 100 bucks easy. A relatively painless way to make a living, if I do say so myself. Ow! Blaah! [shrieking] [claws snapping] Relatively painless. ["merry go round broke down" playing] The Looney Tunes Show, Season 2, Episode 13 "Daffy Duck Esquire" [cellphone rings] - Go. - It's Tina. Daffy: Oh, hey. Let me ask you something. If someone were to turn their bedroom into a nightclub, Would you be into that? - Don't turn your bedroom into a nightclub. I said, "someone." - Listen, there's something I gotta talk to you about. My dad's coming into town. Oh, meet the parents. - How long's he here? - A week... But you're not gonna meet him. - Wait a second. You didn't tell him about us? - Yeah. I told him I have a boyfriend named Daffy Duck and that's all he needs to know. Are you ashamed of me? You think your dad won't like me? Why? 'cause I ain't got no class? 'cause I ain't got no money, no job, no education? Yeah, all that stuff. - Well, your dad sounds very judgmental. - Look, Daffy, those things don't matter to me. You know I love you, but my dad's tough. He doesn't think anyone's good enough for me. I'll call you when he leaves. Hey, dad! So glad you made it! People need to chill out. [disco music playing] Aah! Hey, Bugs. What you doin'? - I'm going to the beach to set some lobsters free. Oh, fun. I'd love to come with you but I'm allergic to shellfish. Uh... - Hey, Daffy. You and Tina wanna do something with me and Bugs this week? - I'm not allowed to see Tina this week. Her dad's in town. - So? - She doesn't want me to meet him. She doesn't think he'll like me. - Well, you're gonna have to meet him at some point. I mean, don't you plan on being with Tina forever? I hope so. Well, then, at some point you're gonna have to ask him for his daughter's hand in marriage. Do people still do that? - Daffy, Tina's not gonna wait on you forever. She's a catch. You are lucky to have her. I mean, you ain't got no class. You ain't got no money, no job, no education. So what do I do? - I don't know, but if you wanna keep Tina then you're gonna have to convince her dad that you're good enough for her. See that place over there? - You mean that rinky-dink copy store? That's where I work. I'm the assistant general manager. - Well, as far as I'm concerned, you shouldn't have to work. That so-called boyfriend of yours he should be the one taking care of you. Dad, I like working. - And what does this Daffy Duck do for a living, anyway? - Tell me. - Oh, you know, stuff. - Stuff? What do you mean, stuff? Are you telling me that he's unemployed? - Dad, Daffy's a good guy. He's... - A lawyer? - A what? - Why didn't you tell me he was a lawyer? I mean, that's fantastic. This is great. When am I gonna meet this wonderful person? Oh, you know, I don't know. I'm sure he's very busy being a liar. I mean a lawyer. - Honey, a young man is never too busy to meet his girlfriend's father. Remember that. I can't believe that you're dating a lawyer. I can't, either. Lola: Oh, hi, Tina. So you're here to see Daffy? Is this your dad? Hi. I'm Lola, Daffy's secretary. Can I get you a cup of coffee or a banana milkshake? A coffee is fine. [ding] - Uh, Mr. Duck, we have some visitors. Daffy: I'll be right out. Let me just wrap up this call with the supreme court. You must be Mr. Russo. It's such a pleasure to meet the father of the most wonderful woman in the world. You can call me Frank. - We saw your face on a bus bench. Oh, that was Lola's idea. Gets the firm's name out there. Nothing wrong with a little hustle. Am I right, Frank? - Well, this has been a lot of fun, but we gotta get you checked in to the hotel. - Hotel? Hush. You can't stay at a hotel. - You'll stay at my house. - No, no, no, no. - Oh, no, really? Oh, that would be great. I... I hate hotels. Then stay at my place. - Honey, your apartment is too small. That's why I was staying at a hotel. - No, no. I insist you stay at my house. What good is it to be successful enough to own your own home with a pool in an upscale neighborhood if you can't share it? - Then it's all settled. Now come on, Tina. We've taken up entirely too much of this fine young man's time. Ahem. Lola, will you get judge judy on the line? [door closes] And I'll have another banana milkshake. Are you Daffy Duck? Do I look like Daffy Duck? I just need a signature. What did he order now? - Bring her in! - Bring who in? [horse neighs] Bugs, I'm home! Hope you didn't make a big dinner. I'm kind of filled up on banana milkshakes. My pony's here! - He's great. - It's a she. - She's great. - Why did you order a pony? - Pony rides can be very lucrative. We got Gossamer living across the street. He's got a bunch of little kid friends. We charge 'em 10 bucks a ride, bing, bam, boom, money in my pocket. Well, you're the one who got rid of the lobsters. Where's she gonna sleep? Out here with Taz. Don't worry about it. It's not your problem. No, wait. Right now, I've got my hands full pretending to be a lawyer, So it is your problem. - Why are you pretending to be a lawyer? - Because Tina's dad is in town, and I need to impress him. [doorbell rings] That's them now. Oh, one more thing. I told him he could stay here while he's in town. Why did you do that? I can't lose Tina. I need him to like me. [sighs] fine. - Oh. I also told him this is my house and you're my loser, deadbeat roommate who I'm letting stay here until you get back on your feet. I'm not just successful, you know. I'm also compassionate. Frank. - What in the world is that ridiculous thing in the driveway? - Oh, it's my... I mean, it's, uh...it's, uh... - It's my parade float. I made it out of old newspapers. It seemed like a good use of 21/2 years of my life. - Oh, you. You must be the deadbeat roommate. It's awfully nice of Daffy to let you stay here. Ho ho ho. You have no idea. I don't have to pay for anything around here... Rent, food. I just take, take, take. Ah, Daffy's a saint to put up with me. Wow, Daffy, You have some beautiful home here. - Thank you very much. I like it. Let me get you something to drink. - Mm-hmm. And what is it that, uh, you do again? Nothing, really. I mean, I've gone months without leaving the house. Until this morning, I was running a lobster farm out of the swimming pool but now I'm on to pony rides. Next week, who knows? You see, I'm more of an idea guy than a hard-work, follow-through kind of guy. Come on. I'll show you the pony. Huh. Would you look at that? No telling how old this is. Want a bite? I think your dad likes me. - Are you out of your mind? Pretending to be a lawyer? - Tina, everyone knows that a father wants his daughter to be with either a doctor or a lawyer and I couldn't pretend to be a doctor because the last time I did that, I almost killed someone. I'm gonna almost kill you. This is crazy. I thought you'd be happy. I swear I can never predict your reaction to things. So this is your plan? Just lie to my father for the rest of your life? - I'm doing this for us. I want your dad to like me so that he'll say yes when I ask for your hand in marriage. What? Relax. Not now. One day in the future, when you have a better job and you can afford to give us the lifestyle we deserve. Well, I'm not a real wizard. It just says that on my business cards. - Dad, are you sure you don't wanna stay with me? - No, no, no, honey. I'm fine, believe me. Daffy'll take good care of me. You don't hear that every day. - Sorry I have to work tomorrow. - We'll be fine. It'll give your dad and me a chance to hang out. - Uh, don't you have to work tomorrow? Oh, right. I'm a lawyer. - What time do you usually get in to the office? - I don't know. Usually roll in around noon. He's at his desk at 6:30. - In the morning? - Don't look at me. I didn't tell you to become a lawyer. Night! Good night, Frank. Nighty-night, guys. - Hey, Bugs, thanks for going along with the charade. - I owe you one. - Don't mention it. I'm serious. If you ever need legal advice, you know who to call. An actual lawyer. Oh, right. What are you doing? This is my room. - If I'm gonna pretend to be you, might as well get into character. Sheesh. I really am filthy, aren't I? [disco music playing] [chair squeaking] [sighs] I should have pretended to be a doctor. I have good news. Tina's dad went home early, and I can get back to my old life? No. We got our first client. - Client? Who told you to get a client? I thought we agreed never to answer the phone. - But you said you were bored. I thought you'd be happy. Swear I can never predict your reaction to things. [laughs] Daffy's one disturbed individual. What you reading there? - My diary. I'm learning a lot about myself. [laughs] - I wear a toupee? - Really? Well, it's a really good one. I mean, I would have thought that was your real hair. - I didn't know you were a lawyer. I am this week. So let me get this straight. You burned the roof of your mouth on a slice of hot pizza, ...and now you want to sue Pizzariba. Why didn't you just blow on it? No one told me to. I need to be protected from myself. My mouth is ruined. I can't talk no more. You're talking right now. Well, uh, I can't taste nothin' no more. [sips] mmm. This is good banana shake. You can really taste that banana. - I don't know. Suing Pizzariba? It just doesn't seem right. Speedy's a decent, hardworking person. I've known him for years. He lives in my house. - How many of you are livin' over there? - Let's see. There's me, Bugs, Speedy Frank, and Taz. Oh, and we just got a pony. So will you take my case? - I'm sorry, but Speedy's a friend. - Come on. I heard about this lady who burnt her tongue on a cup of hot coffee and she won a million dollars. A million dollars? Lola, why don't you go ahead and draw up a contract? Lola: You got it. I'm sorry. What's a contract? [beep beep beep] Hoo! - Oh, hey. Where you going? - Work. Work? It's Saturday. We were gonna spend time with my dad. - Tina, you knew when you decided to date a lawyer that there would be sacrifices. For me, I'm afraid it's career, then family. [kiss] I've always been upfront about this. - There's nothing upfront about this! It's a giant lie! - I'll try to get home early, but I can't promise anything. Dad. Bugs. Frank: We're out here, honey. [neighs] What are you doing? A pony ride. Honey, I grew up in the concrete jungle. I've never been on one of these things. I've never seen one of these things. I mean, this is great. You wanna go next? No. I'm good. Hmm. - So Daffy can't hang out with us today. He's gotta work. - Wow. That kid really keeps his beak to the grindstone. Hey, Bugs, how 'bout you? You got any plans today? Oh, I never have plans. Well, that's great. Come on. Let's go grab some lunch. - I'll drive. - Let's take the pony. Can you believe this guy? What a guy. No, I really can't. [nickers] - Come on, Tina. - I'll meet you there. Giddy-up! Yah! Yah! [laughs] Giddy-up! Yee-hah! One slice of hot pizza. [pizza sizzles] And we'll see just how hot. What are you doing? What's this? You just got served. You're suing me? On behalf of my client. Who is Samuel Rosenbaum? Our next-door neighbor, Sam. - Yosemite? He wants me to pay him a million dollars because my pizza's hot? It's supposed to be hot. Blow on it. - It's just business, nothing personal. - Ok, then you just got unserved. I'll see you in court. You're not a lawyer. Tell it to the judge. [men scatting] [only scatting audible] [scatting ends] [gavel bangs] - We'll now hear opening statements in the case of "Samuel Rosenbaum Vs. Speedy Gonzales, proprietor of Pizzariba." Mr. Duck, you may proceed. Thank you, your honor. [clears throat] The evidence that I will present to you today will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt ...that this gentleman, "Speedy Gonzales," Knowingly and willfully served my client dangerously hot pizza With no warning and with no regard for the physical and emotional trauma that followed. I will prove that Mr. Gonzales' carelessness was no accident but instead the direct result of his endless need for speed. We will show you that had Mr. Gonzales simply taken more time between the oven and the table to allow the pizza to cool then this senseless tragedy could have been avoided. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury Mr. Gonzales likes to brag that he's the fastest mouse in all of Mexico but this is America, and in America, speed can kill or, in this case, burn. Thank you, your honor. Tchk. Mr. Gonzales. - Uh, yeah, he's not a real lawyer. - Hmm. Well, then this case is dismissed. Wow, that was fast. I didn't even have time to get business cards printed. What about my million dollars? Why didn't you tell me you weren't a real lawyer? Raah! Get them out of my courtroom. - [grunting] - tsk tsk tsk. Gringos. [nickers] - What's the problem? You went up the stairs. - Wish you didn't have to go, dad. - Oh, me, too, honey. It was such a fun trip. - [neighs] - attagirl. - Sorry you didn't get to spend much time with Daffy. - Yeah, you know, honey, it seems to me that, uh you don't get to spend much time with Daffy, either. - Huh? - Sweetheart I used to think that you needed a guy with a good job good education, someone who could support you but what good is any of that stuff if you never see the guy? Seems to me that Daffy is always working. And besides, you can support yourself. You're smart. You've got a good job. What you need is someone fun, Someone who keeps life interesting someone who makes you laugh... someone a little crazy... [neighs] Someone like Bugs. - Bugs? - Bugs? ! Frank, you got it all wrong. I made up the whole thing so you'd like me. I'm not a lawyer. This isn't even my house. This is Bugs' house. I'm the deadbeat roommate. I'm the one who ain't got no money, no job, no education. I'm the one for Tina! Wait a second. You lied to me? - He was afraid if he was himself, you wouldn't like him. I was, too. - Dollface, do you love him? - Mm-hmm. - Well, then that's all that matters. - And how 'bout you? You got any other secrets.. ...that you're not telling me about? Huh? [laughs] Ah, boy, I like this guy. I'm watchin' him, but I like him. Me, too. So get this. Tina's dad likes the real me more than the fake me. - Does that mean I can stop pretending to be you? Yeah. Thanks again. - Eh, it was kinda fun, actually. Though I wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to do with this. [whistles] [squeals] My killer whale! [disco music playing] (CELL PHONE CHIMING) I'm on my way. (KEYPAD BEEPS) So have Steve take a look at it, probably just needs a rebooting. Hey, my girlfriend just pulled up. My flight's three hours, we got all afternoon to bang this thing out. (SIGHS) (WHISPERS) Sorry. Yeah, sure, I'm up for dinner. What do you think? (STRAINING) Actually, that works great because I wanted to talk to you about a few things before we went in next week. Yeah, will you bring those reports? (PANTING) Of course I'm going to meet them first. Yeah. Yeah, some of us actually prepare for this stuff. Thanks, babe. Yeah. Yeah, we're on our way now, so. Everything looks great. (STRAINING) You're kidding. (WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA) It's built in? New place comes with a sauna. That's incredible. Yeah. (STRAINING) Yeah. I'm here now, I just... Mmm... Have a great time. Uh, hey, Marty, let me get back at you. Hey Nat, wait. What's up? You know those limo service guys are amazing. They show up early, they wait for you, fresh bottle of water, cute little mints. Yeah and a hundred bucks later. What? You're right, they're pricey. Okay, I'm sorry. This is a great opportunity for both of us. Well, it's your opportunity. Go for it. You'll be amazing. What are you... Wait, wait. I go through the training orientation, three or four months you come up. I mean, it's Chicago. They've got to need nurses, especially your kind. Uh, I've already made you late. Hey! I'm coming back for your birthday! Love you. (DOOR CREAKS) Here we are, ladies. WOMAN: Oh... We have got sweet tea in a cup for Jean. Thank you. And coffee for Patty. PATTY: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. And who in the world is that? It looks like some nosey parker all up in your business. Maybe one of those gals who thinks she's going to beat you out of winning the Carolina Corners Christmas Showcase. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Well, that's certainly not going to happen. (DOORBELL CHIMES) Excuse me? Yeah? I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm looking for the Mayors. Oh, I don't... I don't live here I'm just here for work. If you want, I'll go ask up at the house. Um... Oh. I'm okay. Thank you. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Oh, no. It's no interruption. Thanks. Yeah. Hey, did you say Mayor? Yes. Yeah. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) NATALIE: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mayor? I'm Natalie Springer, the home care nurse. I think we spoke on the phone. Yeah. We know who you are. We're just so glad that you're here. I swear, did you ever see a prettier girl? (BOTH CHUCKLE) Well, I'm Suzy and this is Duncan. You can call me Mr. Mayor. Hush! Don't let him boss you around. JEAN: Suzy's coming home? Well, it beats spending your last days in some germy old hospital. (SIGHS) (WHISPERS) It's good to be home. It's good. Bless her poor heart. Well, good Lord calls us all home when it's time. You ask me, Duncan would have been the better choice for the Lord to call home. Gayle! You heard me. (SUZY SIGHS) Oh. No Christmas tree. Where's the Christmas tree? What's Christmas without a tree? Hmm? Hello? DUNCAN: Upstairs. (STAIRS CREAKING) Next door on the right. (EXCLAIMS SOFTLY) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) NATALIE: Suzy? In here. Thing about strawberries is, they come back. Year after year. Little water, little sun, it's all it takes. Hobby? You have any idea how easy it is to extract DNA from a strawberry? Used to wow my students. I'm sorry about my husband. He's just working through some things. So, Dr. Emmons sent me your pain management schedule. I thought maybe we could go over it together. Mmm, it's not your first picnic, is it, Pretty Girl? And apart from the schedule, if you feel anything at all... I'll go ahead and scream my head off. Okay by me. Do you mind if I join you? Suit yourself. Would you like some coffee to wash that down? Never drink it. Do you mind if I make some? Suit yourself. Just so you know, I gave Suzy something to help her rest. Above the microwave. I generally take Saturdays off to take care of my personal business. I live about an hour away, in Florence. Have to go home and pay bills, water plants. That sorta thing. Fantastic. Other than that, I am here 24/7. Far as I'm concerned you can take as much time off as you want. I'm guessing Suzy did most of the cooking? I'm not much of a foodie, but I can help. Top drawer on your left. Where it should be. Suzy's going to need nutritional supplements and foods that are easy to digest. I can pick all that up at the market, so if there's anything in particular that you would like... I like hot dogs. You know what? So do I. I like them with mayo and avocado. I just... I'm just not so keen on them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Avocado and mayo. Who in the world eats hot dogs with mayo and avocado? The Chileans. The Chileans eat hot dogs? They do. Are you Chilean? No. (DOORBELL CHIMES) (WATER RUNNING) Sorry. Go ahead. No, you go ahead. You're going to have to learn the traffic patterns around here. (DOORBELL CHIMES) Hello, Duncan. Oh... Wish we had some ice cream. What did you say your name was again? It's Miss Springer. You can call me Natalie. All right. Spoon's inside. Look, Natalie. This wasn't my idea. It was the doctor's orders for you to be here. I'm only here to be a help, Mr. Mayor. For both Suzy and you. Well, I can take care of my own wife. (SIGHS) I will do my best to stay out of your way. Okay? Yes, you will. I understand how difficult... No! No, no. You don't understand anything. NATALIE: She slept on-and-off during the day yesterday and through most of the night, but she woke up very nauseous this morning and vomited several times. DR. EMMONS: Mmm-hmm. Same medication? Same medication. Hello, hello. How you feeling? Oh, fresh as a daisy. Mmm-hmm. Same old Suzy. (SIGHS) I know. You wanted something different? Never. Duncan, how are you? (DUNCAN SIGHS) I'll come back up when you're done here. You are in good hands with Natalie, here. SUZY: Yeah. I had a feeling. Would you forgive me for just one second? (EXHALES) (PAPER RUSTLING) Duncan? (DOG BARKING DISTANTLY) Don't need the nurse. She's not just a nurse. Well, I can take care of my own wife. Duncan, we made an agreement. Suzy comes home with care from a private duty nurse. Well, good. When you leave, I'm gonna lock her up in here. How's that? Hmm. You know, Natalie's specialty is hospice care. Hospice. Duncan, you're in good hands with Natalie. Let me explain something to you. This is my home. I can take care of my own wife. You know Suzy's not only my patient, she's my friend. This is a chance to let it all happen the way you both want. Natalie can help you understand the signs. I can read my own signs. She's going to be up and down. One day, she's gonna be fine, the next, she's not going to be herself. I need you to take advantage of what Natalie has to offer. Okay? For Suzy's sake. (SIGHS HEAVILY) GAYLE: Hi, Tommy. Hey, Mrs. Matthews. Be done on time? Not a problem. Now, what about lights? Yeah, you know, Mrs. Matthews, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Oh, my daddy, he loved Christmas lights. We had hundreds and hundreds of them, every different color. Got them all boxed up in the attic. Yeah. You know, Mrs. Matthews, the Christmas Showcase is kinda an upscale contest. What exactly are you implying? Nothing. Nothing, I just think that maybe, you know, subtle and sophisticated might be the way to go. I'm not sophisticated? No! No, you... You are sophisticated, ma'am! I just... You know, look, this is your original idea. You know, and it's beautiful. I mean, look at it. It's really cool. Do you really think so? I do think so. You know, and nobody's ever done a design like this before. They haven't. No. But we... We don't want to go taking anything away from it. You know? No! No. I mean, sometimes those colored lights, they... I don't know, they get a little bit... Distracting? There you go. Yeah. Mmm... Okay. All right. (GASPS) How about the partridge? It's almost done. Better be. (CELL PHONE CHIMING) (WHISPERS) Hi. BRIAN: Hey. You okay? Yeah, I'm good, I'm good. Sorry, I'm just, uh... How's work? Nat, the people here... I mean, everybody is so cool. They share all their toys, and I am learning a ton. (LAPTOP BEEPS) So, I already looked into a ticket. A ticket? Mmm, a ticket for what? Your birthday. No, Brian, come on. I told you. You don't have to come here, it's too much of a hassle. No, no, no. It's your birthday and I already told you I'll be there. Unless you want to come here instead. I'll fly you up, we can check out the city. The music scene here is incredible! Yeah, but, you know I can't do that. Right. Right. Anyway, well, we'll figure all this stuff out when I see you. I better get going. I just wanted to check in. Night, Nat. Good night. (BEEP) Do you remember all those crazy nights down at the beach? Mmm. Family Kingdom. We hit every ride at Family Kingdom. (CHUCKLING) Ten times in a row on that old Whiz-Bang. There's that rickety old Ferris wheel. We got stuck at the top, you pulled out the ring. (INHALES DEEPLY) Biggest mistake of your life. Not even hardly. I almost got down on one knee. Well, thank God you didn't. I'd do anything to go back to that night. That ride never ended. (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (MUSIC STOPS) Hey, quick question about Mrs. Mayor. What's her situation? Oh, yeah. Uh, I gotta go. Hey! (CLEARS THROAT) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you all going? We're going for a drive. Mmm-hmm. Oh, okay. Are you sure that you're feeling up to it? (SCOFFS) I am feeling great. (CHUCKLES) Okay, where? A drive to where? Myrtle Beach! (LAUGHS) Myrtle Beach! Wow. Mr. Mayor, Myrtle Beach, that's kinda far. Yeah, well, we'll let you know how far it is. Okay, but why? Why Myrtle Beach? Why not just few times around the block? Ain't no amusement parks around the block. Amusement park. (CAR LOCK BEEPS) Are you serious? Amusement park? (ENGINE STARTS) (SIGHS) DUNCAN: Remember, we went on that ride that you wanted to go on? The little airplane ride that was for five-year-olds. It wasn't for five-year-olds! (CHUCKLES) Well, yeah. I fit in it. Yeah! (LAUGHS) What? What? Yeah, you got in it, all right. Okay, that's not nice. I got out, didn't I? Yeah, you got out. Yeah. We had to pry you out. Someone got me out. Hey. Hey! You okay? Okay, we'll turn around. Okay? I'm here. I'm sorry. Hey, it's okay. Look at me. It's okay. NATALIE: Shh. (WHISPERING) She's asleep. Here, I'll take that. Mr. Mayor... I don't need any lectures from you. I would never. It's just important to understand that anything can happen at any time. DUNCAN: And I don't know that? (SIGHS) NATALIE: Are you sure you want to get up so soon? Live your best life while you can. Okay. Oh, my. What an exotic color! NATALIE: Oh, yeah? SUZY: Ooh! Tahiti Sunrise. (DOORBELL CHIMES) Oh, you get it. I'll be fine. You sure? Mmm-hmm. NATALIE: Okay. Hey. Um, sorry to bother you again. Um... Actually, I was wondering if I could see Mrs. Mayor? (SUZY GASPS) Is that Tommy Harris? Yes, ma'am. It is. You remember me? How could I forget you? Tommy was one of my high school students. Oh. Oh, this is Natalie Springer. Yeah, we kinda, sorta meet before. Tommy Harris. Ma'am, I just... I just found out that you lived here, and I just wanted to stop by and say hello. Oh. Won't you come in? Oh, no. No, no. I shouldn't. Um... (SIGHS) I wanted you to know that I, uh... I graduated college. And I have my own business now. In fact, I'm working right next door for Mrs. Matthews right now. (LAUGHS) Bless your heart. That's wonderful. I'm so proud of you. I just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me. You know, if there's anything that I can do for you, you just let me know, okay? There is one small thing. This is the usual spot. Oh, no! I have it. (LAUGHS) Sit down, relax. DUNCAN: Can I help you? TOMMY: Stopped by to say hello to Mrs. Mayor. DUNCAN: To Mrs. Mayor? TOMMY: Yes, sir. DUNCAN: You're that Harris kid. TOMMY: Tommy. You're not welcome here. Sir, I... You're not listening, boy. Get out of here. Did you invite that boy in here? He came over to say hello to me. Yeah, well. Better count the silverware. He's not a criminal, Duncan. Well, I don't want him around. Understood? SUZY: Pretty Girl, would you go on and fetch me a glass of sweet tea? Of course. Come here. (WHISPERS) Come here. Come here! Don't make me beg, come here! I know what comes after the sweet tea. (SIGHS) Ooh, it's time you quit holding onto some things the way you do. You know, people can change, even grumpy-types like yourself. Just have a think on it, that's all. (ENGINE STARTS) (TIRES SQUEALING) (DOOR CLOSES) (DOORBELL CHIMES) (LAUGHING) Wow! That is big. It's all ready for you. Oh. That is a beauty! GAYLE: Tommy Harris! I gotta go. Merry Christmas! He's a cutie, isn't he? Um... (SIGHS) (GAYLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Tommy Harris, I'm going to tell you right now, I'm madder than a wet rooster cock in August in a candy store! Why is she so upset? Oh... Well, we go way back, me, and Gayle, and Duncan. NATALIE: What happened? Well, Gayle's granddaddy went and made a bunch of money in property. And he lost over half of it to my granddaddy in a high-stakes poker game. (GASPS) We weren't worth more than a nickel at the time, but then, we did okay for ourselves. NATALIE: Oh, so she's still... Just the keeper of a good old-fashioned family feud. Yeah. Seemed like it might blow over for a time when I was in high school 'cause I was... I was seeing Gayle's brother, Charlie. But then Duncan came along, and he swept me off my feet. (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING) (WAVES CRASHING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (CLATTERING) Excuse me. Is there anybody around here I can speak to about a Ferris wheel? What about 'em? How to get one? Get one? Or rent one, a small one. Suppose it's possible. But not anywheres around here. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) I need to get a hold of one. (STAMMERING) I got work to do. Shut it down. (ENGINE STOPS) Gotta get a hold of one. (SIGHS) There's this one place you might want to try. A little, deserted amusement park just the other side of Moncks Corner. Other side of... Is that the one under the freeway? There you go. We sometimes mine it for parts. Uh, last time I was down there I seen a 45-footer, it looked pretty decent. 45-footer? Uh-huh. (ENGINE STARTS) How big is this one? Oh, it's about a buck and a quarter. Appreciate it! What made you pick nursing? (SIGHS) When I was in high school my mom was diagnosed. Non-Hodgkin's. When she went into remission, I decided to go into nursing school. And then when she relapsed for the last time, I switched gears into hospice care. 'Cause it just... Felt right, you know? I think that the left side needs a little more... A little more bright and shiny. What do you think? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. Here. I'm real sorry about your momma. (NATALIE SIGHS) (WHISPERS) Thank you. (BELLS JINGLING) (ENGINE STOPS) (CREAKING) (DOG BARKING DISTANTLY) Anybody home? (CHICKENS CLUCKING) HENRY: Mister! You are trespassin' on sacred ground. Sacred ground? Here to rob my kingdom? I'm not here to rob anybody. I reckon that's what I'd say if I got caught with my hand in the cookie jar. "Not here to rob, just want to do one last corkscrew on the Wild Rabbit." Or some such. Just looking around. (LAUGHS) Looking around? Looking around at what? This... This good-for-nothing pile of junk? That's not the way I see it. Oh, is that so? What are you, some kind of visionary? That Ferris wheel still work? What's it to you? I'm looking to get one. Well, sir, I'm not looking to get rid of one, so you best be on your way. DUNCAN: Would you consider an offer? What need you got of a Ferris wheel? Well, that's my business. Well, that's my wheel. My wife is dying. Well, mine's dead. Now get off my property. NATALIE: Okay. I'm gonna go look for the Christmas lights while you rest. Good idea. Might write some letters or something like that. Okay. (EXHALES) (STAIRS CREAKING) Oh, the tree looks not-so-bad. Right? Yeah. Good job. Thank you. So, do you have a beau or something? NATALIE: Sorry? Come on, give me some scoop. (CHUCKLES) I wouldn't want to bore you. Oh, I don't get bored. (NATALIE SIGHS) Okay. I've been dating this guy for the last two years. We dated in college and eventually broke it off. And when my mom got sick the last time, he sort of rekindled things. So, will we be seeing him around here sometime? Not likely. He just got a job in Chicago. That where you're headed? Um, I haven't really had time to think about it. What's there to think about? It's Chicago! I know, but... It's not the Chicago part you're struggling with. Sounds cliche, but, you know, just listen to this and you'll know what to do. Uh, Pretty Girl, I think that I need to move down to the living room. It's those stairs, they're getting to be a bit much, and, uh, I want to be where the action is. Okay, you got it. And Dr. Emmons, he said about the bed... No, don't worry about that. I'll handle it. (WHISPERS) Okay. Thank you. (DOOR OPENING) (EXHALES) Tahiti Sunrise. More like Tomato Soup. Where'd you go all day? I was exploring. Mmm. I always liked exploring with you. (SIGHS) You call that a partridge? It's not finished yet. Well, it's supposed to look like a partridge, or what's the point? TOMMY: Well, it'll look like a partridge when I'm done with it, I promise. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey, how's my girl? Hmm? Hanging in. Oh, yeah? Let me see those beautiful eyes. Let me see them. Excuse me. (DRAWER OPENS) Who brought that tree in here? Tommy brought it. He was doing me a favor. Tommy? I don't want that boy around here. I'm serious about that. You stay clear of him, you hear? Yeah. Duncan, that attitude is not handsome on you. Okay. Here we go. Just one sip. SUZY: I don't want it right now. It's good for you. There you go. Not so bad, right? It's okay. It's okay. (RETCHING) Okay, look, what's up? All right, all right. Here's a napkin, Suzy. I got... I got a towel. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. She's just not hungry. (COUGHS) (EXHALES) Put another straw in there. Hey. Hey. I don't want it. It's not for you, it's for me. I love my shakes. (SCOFFS) I love my shakes from the Shake Shack. Mmm? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Remember, we used to walk down the boardwalk, me and you? Hmm? Huh? All the boys sitting on the fence saying, "Boy, that Duncan Mayor, he's... "He's one lucky man." (WEAKLY) Shut up. Mmm-hmm? And I'd just look at them. Put your hand on my arm. Go ahead. Put it. Just like we walking. Mmm? And then we go for a walk. And just go, "Hey, what's going on? "Yeah, she's the most beautiful girl in all the world. "That's right. "And I got her." And we're going to have ourselves a shake now. We going to share a shake from the Shake Shack, like we always do. You're so crazy. Come on. Come on. Get in there. Get in there. Oh, sorry. (CHUCKLES) I'm so sorry. It's just I had a little bit of a corn-dog, came up, surprised me. (LAUGHS) Okay, come on. On the count of three. One, two, three. (SWALLOWS) You gotta eat, baby. (SNORING) (TRUCK APPROACHING) (CHICKENS CLUCKING) (CLATTERING) What, are you deaf or dumb as a bag of rocks? Hey. I told you already one time to stay out of here. Slow down there, cowboy. Now, I need that Ferris wheel more than you do. And you need this baby here more than me. What you got here? You sleeping with ducks or something? What's the matter with you? Now, she's almost brand new. Got a pop out. And she's all yours. Uh-huh. I see it in your eyes. Sleep on it. In fact, sleep in it. And I'll be back tomorrow, and me and you going to work it out. Understand? (ENGINE STARTS) DUNCAN: All right, don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot, don't shoot! Hey, I just... I'm just trying to do the right thing here. Make this a fair trade. It's a fair trade! Looks like my Ferris wheel ain't the only wheel you'll be needing. Dang thing keeps pulling to the left. Say, that's a pretty good looking tree you got there. Yes, it is. Comes with. It's a Noble. 6-footer. (DOORBELL CHIMES) Huh. Isn't that cute? What is it? I don't know. There's a card. "A turtle dove for your tree. "Merry Christmas. Tommy." That's so sweet! (WHISPERS) I love it. Don't you love it? HENRY: It's my wife's notion that we could bring the old carnival back to life, stop working the traveling circuit. After she passed, I didn't have much cause to think on it, or anything that much. So, y'all were in the carnival business. Well, the carnival business was in us. Whole family worked the circuit. Gave it everything we had. You got an extension ladder? I want to start taking her down. You can't take her down the crime scene? Yeah, he sort of followed me home. Guess I adopted him. Well, that was very sweet of you. Yeah. So, uh, anyway, I came to apologize. Apologize? Yeah. Most detectives make up their mind before they ever get to the crime scene, but you refused to take the easy way out. I should've backed you up, but I didn't. Oh, pshh, come on, no, no, no. That's, you know... I understand how it is. It's just how things work at the department. Yeah, well, either way, you're the kind of cop I want to be when I make detective. Yeah, well, it'll happen. Mm-mm-mm. I don't know. I'm really good on the streets, but I, uh, I choked on the written exam. Well, maybe, uh, next time, you know, you're studying for the written exam, maybe, I don't know, I could, I don't know, I could help you study, help... Ashley, we got a call. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. I got to go. We'll talk later? Yeah. Are you kidding me? That was your best shot? You didn't even get her phone number. So, uh, what, we going home? Nope, we're going to the races. Oh, that's great. What? Dog asks you to get on the case and nothing. But some tootsie bats her eyelashes and zippedy-doo-dah, you're Dirty Harry. Zip it, Fido. You know, females put out a signal when they're interested. I could smell some major flirtage going on there. Oh, so now you're an expert on romance, huh? This from a species who says, "Hello," by sniffing each other's butts. Oh, sorry, ladies. And now, a fast move by Southern Beauty. Southern Beauty on the outside. If I was a betting man, I'd say Southern Beauty by eight lengths. You've been right all day long, Daddy. Southern Beauty... You did it again. That little puppy's got some... a fire in her. Southern Beauty won again. That's four in a row, Dad. What a surprise, Eddie. Yes, a surprise, Eddie. There's a detective in the kennel... about Chin Li. Uh-huh. Well, bring him up, son. What's wrong with her? And they're off. These muscle-heads are an embarrassment to our race. Well, aren't you being a little catty? Pardon the expression. These dogs are athletes. Chasing an idiotic, mechanical rabbit? They're nothing but puppets of the man. Aw, don't be jealous. I'm sure you could keep up if you dropped a few pounds. Mr. Flower? I'm Detective Fowler. Are you looking for Mr. Cage? Yes. I'm Mr. Cage. You're Mr. Cage? I'm Edward Cage, managing director here at the Cage Kennel Club. If you're looking for my father, he's upstairs watching the races. Okay. Your dog will have to stay here, of course. You stay here, Cho Cho, and be a good doggy. And if you do, you get a little doggy treat. Good boy. Hey, I got a doggy treat for you. Good afternoon, son. Afternoon. I'm Hamilton Cage, and you are? Detective Fowler. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Cage. Uh-uh-uh. Rule you call me Hamilton. Edward you met. My son, my dear son and heir. Want a drink? Oh, no, I'm on duty, thanks. Get him a drink. And this is my little princess. My daughter Margret. President of Research and Development for my largest division, Biotech. And I suppose I should tell you a little tiny something about myself. Son, I was a... Orphaned as a baby. That's right. Educated in the Far East... A PhD in chemistry by the age of 20. You started Biotech Pharmaceuticals which you built into a world leader. Continue. Five years ago, you started Cage Sports Enterprises which includes a pro football team, CSE Sports Channel, and the Cage Kennel Club. Glory Hallelujah, I do so love a man who does his homework. You must be one heck of a detective, son. Aw, shucks. No, just more of an internet geek. Internet geek. That's a good one. Hey, what's with you? Calm down. Hey, over here, big boy. Well, howdy. Hey, that Southern Beauty's a wild one, isn't she? She didn't use to be. But you look like a dog who appreciates a woman with a little spunk. Oh, I do. Uh, tell me, uh... Mary Beth. Mary Beth. I'd like to know everything I can about this track. My mama told me to be careful around dogs who ask too many questions. You always listen to your mama? Practically never. Is there some problem, Detective? No, no, it's just, um, you seem like you're in remarkable shape for man of your... Age? I know you're trying to be diplomatic. But as you can see, good health is not just a business with me. It's a passion. That and the track. Oh, different kind of passion. And most of the credit for the track must go to my dear son Edward, my son and heir. Mmm-hmm. Well, so, if Edward was in charge of the track, he must have been the last one to see Chin Li alive, right? Ohh. What about that, Edward? Chin Li was working the morning shift feeding the dogs, but he was gone by noon. Chin Li was so much more than my friend. He taught me about trust, loyalty, generosity, action, focus. Everything I am today I owe directly to him. Sorry for your loss. Cho Cho. Has anyone thought about Cho Cho? Chin Li had a dog that was very important to him. Do you know where he is? It's funny you should ask. Cho Cho! I got to go. Can we continue this another time? Cho Cho! I've got a flea bath booked at six. Well, then, I'll see you later. Oh, yes. This mongrel was just a pup last time I saw it. We were closest to him in all the world, you and I. I know you miss him every much. Very decent of you to take Cho Cho in, Detective. It was before I found out he never stops talking. Barking. Never stops barking. Cho Cho, sit. My entire organization is at your disposal. I want Chi Li's attackers brought to justice. I'll do my best. Oh, do better than that. Get it done. Margret will show you out. We're counting on you. I did a little leg work, partner, What? Sweet little greyhound back there said they introduced a new feed to Southern Beauty and some of the other dogs. Huh. What are you doing? The magnetic strip on the ID cards carry a unique code for each employee, so I'm using COLAR to access the Cage Kennel Club Employee Database. And? Well, Chin Li did leave the kennel area gate by noon, but there's an entry and exit coming from the Biotech building at 8:55 p.m. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Feline fury coming on. What? Cat. What? I hate cats. Lazy, worthless layabouts, the whole lot of them. Look at that. You know, cats are behind the plagues of the Middle Ages; you know that, don't you? Are you insane? And I got my suspicions about World War II. And... and... and you... you think Oswald acted alone, huh? Well, I'm sorry. I just got some issues with the C-word I guess, that's all. I'm sorry. Look at that. It's Chin Li's killer. How do you know that's him? Don't you see the bandages on his left wrist? That's where I bit him. Give me those keys. * I got you running in circles. He's getting away. Officer in pursuit! Officer? Hey! You're not an officer, I am. Doesn't this come with power steering? Are you crazy? You can't drive! Oh, yeah? What do you call this... surfing? Stop the car! Code 12. Red team, go. Red team, go. Cho Cho! Stop! Who put that sign there? Stay on the road. * But you didn't count on this top dog coming around. * Hit the brakes; hit the brakes! I am hitting the brake. It won't stop. The accelerator's stuck. Bail out, bail out! Man overboard. Oh, God! Uh! Ahhh! No! I loved that car. This is not good. Oh, a little bodywork, a paint job, it'll be like new. I heard. How you doing? I'm doing good. It's a good day so far. You know, minus the teeny, tiny annoyance of no car, suspension, no future. It's a good day. Good times. Even when you're upset, you're still funny. I don't feel very funny. Well, you make me laugh. That must count for something. Units 5-10 and 6-14, please respond... Hey, what? Ask her. Ask her what? Never mind, I'll do it. Say, uh, why don't you meet me for dinner at the Amazon Cafe at 8:00? Amazon Cafe? It's a date. Why did you do that? Jeez, I don't know what other signals she can give you but jumping in your lap. Besides, I got a good plan. You'll do fine. I won't do fine. You said it yourself: I'm not a people guy. This date's going to go five minutes, then I'll say something stupid, and she's going to walk out. Don't worry about it, partner. I got a plan for that too. * You wanted to see me? I want you to stop what you're doing. Ha! Thought I was helping. The goal of this company is not to fix greyhound races, but to realize the potential for greatness that lies within us all. Ha! Have I made myself clear? Perfectly. Hii-yah! There's a meeting tomorrow in the new wing with Margret and the science team. I expect you to be there as well. I expect you to be there as well. It's all about the power within. Don't race the dogs too much. Don't drug them, whatever you do. Don't make any money. Hii-yah! * Okay, just relax. Just listen to me; repeat what I say. I know everything there is to know about girls. Enjoy your meal. Thanks. You okay? Your neck? Me? Oh, yeah, my neck's a little sore. I'm fine. Oh, good. Wow. You look really... What? Beautiful. Stunning. The smell of your skin takes my breath away. This doesn't sound like you, Peter. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's nice and all. But why the change? Right. What a good question. What a good question. Nothing like a good question. What am I, Plato? Uh, let's see now. Maybe you can try, "Life is full of change. Uh, but in this case, I must admit..." Oh, I'd love to lick your face and sniff your tail. No, you can't use that. You can't use that. Let's see, "In this case, I must admit..." In this case, I must admit... And this may sound bold... This may sound bold... You made me change. You made me change. My heart feels so close to yours. I just want to howl at the moon. I'm not sure if this new you is seducing me or scaring me. Well, I'm a man of more secrets... Than you could possibly imagine. Really? Name one. Name one? Yeah. Secret... what, you want to know what my big secret is? Well, I'll tell you. God, I hate cats. God, I hate cats. What's wrong with cats? Cats are lazy, unmotivated slobs, black holes of selfishness sucking dry the kind hearts of their masters. They're useless. Did you ever hear of a seeing eye cat? Or a watch cat? No. Wow. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Had a little cat rage there. I... it... j-j-just... just just overtakes me. Let me try to get it together. Uh, um, uh, try this: Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about Ashley Wilkenson, her hopes, her dreams... Her fantasies. Well... I want to tell you what's on my mind and in my heart. I'm listening, Detective. Since the first moment I saw you, there's something I've wanted to say to you. And I feel if I don't say it now, that opportunity could pass me by. That's good. Whoo! Wahoo. What is that? Look at the chassis on that lassie. What? What do you want to say? Woof, woof, woof, woof woof. Come on... What is an incredible dog like you doing in a joint like this? No... what? Ashley, I... Excuse me? I don't... I didn't mean... I didn't mean that at all. I mean, you're incredible, but you're not a dog. Ashley. Ashley. Please. Thanks a lot, Cyrano de Bonehead. Good night, miss. Ashley! Ashley, no, wait! Gah! Now what am I supposed to do? How do I know? I'm just a dog. If it was me, I'd chase the car. Ashley, wait! Okay, no more games. I'm just going to bark this out, okay? I love how strong you are. I love how sexy you look in uniform. I love the way you just say what's in your heart. And if only I could just find the strength to say what's in mine. Well, I don't know who was feeding you those corny lines earlier, but I like your own words much better. Yeah, me too. Let's go talk. Want to? You know, I'm not your typical guy. I'm not into sports, going to bars, you know. I don't really get out much either. You know, I'm not your typical dog. I'm not into chasing cars or playing fetch. I'm actually... not the party type. I never go to parties. Never have parties. Ooh, this smells... Oh, excuse me. Ladies first. I don't do hydrants. Whoa! Uh! You want to come back to my place? You know, maybe later? Oh. Uh! I'm sorry. It's okay, babe. Love hurts. * This is a nice neighborhood. Oh, yeah. It's, uh, it's an old boatyard. Got it for cheap, fixed it up, you know? You'll see. Is there a party? No, um, I just left my TV on. So. Um. I... I got to go. So there was a party. No, no, it's my cousins. They're in town. Yeah, okay. Bye. Ashley, wait. Come on, keep up. Rah! Rah! * Hey, I just saw Mrs. Rottweiler. She said the puppies have been up crying all night. Puppies? You dog! Coming through. Excusez-moi. Ay caramba. I'm so high. Hey, Bernie. Hey, we playing poker or what? Oh, I should have seen that one coming. All right, enough! That's it! I want all you four-legged, tail-wagging, Frisbee-catching, flea-scratching mongrels out of my house now. You... out. Out of here! You, beat it. Man, this ain't cool. Don't you give me that look. Ooh, yeah. Down! I'm gonna poo on his lawn. You thought this was a party? No, it was a conference on world peace. Fowler, I was undercover. Undercover? I was questioning the dogs on the street about what goes on at the Cage Kennel Club. Right. Not mine. As a matter of fact, the Dane's cousin dated one of the slower greyhounds there. Okay, right now isn't a good time to talk about dogs and their love life. It's not important. But this is. After a few months on that new dog food, that slower greyhound turned out to be Southern Beauty, winner of her last five starts. And guess what. Edward Cage always supervised feeding time. Really? COLAR. Yes, Peter? The last six greyhounds to win at over 20 to 1, how many of them are owned by Cage Sports Enterprises? Searching that data for you now. Four of them, sweetie buns, including Iron Thunder and Southern Beauty. Sweetie buns? This ain't no ordinary dog food. What if it's illegal or, worse, dangerous to the dogs? Well, if Edward is feeding the dogs some type of chemical energy formula and then betting on them, well, that's enough for an indictment on felony racketeering, and could possibly tie him to the attack on Chin Li. So we need what Chin Li was after, proof of the formula. And the last place Chin Li was before the attack was Biotech. The formula has to be in their mainframe computer. Bingo. Not you. I know you're not Bingo. Access denied. Access denied? Okay, we've got to break in there, but we've got to be really smart about it. All right, Fowler. What do you think of my disguise? Hey, give me that. Ow. Ew, doggy drool. Ow. What is this, bumper cars? Why don't you try going around the walls instead of through them? Should be a door marked "Fire Control" around here. There it is. You should be in here, and I should be driving. Did you hear me? Shut up. We're undercover. Shut up, we're undercover. I am, anyway. Easy, easy. I'm slipping; come up. If I want to be neutered, I'll go to a vet. Get in there. Come on. Hey, watch your hands, Romeo. Look out. Oh, God. I bet Lassie didn't have to go through this. Ow. Get in. Come on, push, push. Ow! This harness is going to ruin my love life. I'll tell you something: Tom Cruise had this figured out better. And I'm not getting $20 million, either. Good job, boy. All right, this is the place. What's happening? Whoa, big... b-b-big drop. Big drop. Hang on to that rope. Oh, easy. E-e-easy. Whoa! Wait a minute. I got to go back up and get my stomach. T-t-take it easy now. Uh! Slow. Take it slow. Whoa. Rope, don't fail me now. Hold it; hold it. Not too close... Don't let me hit the floor, I'll set off the alarm. Hold... hold... stop. Good. All right, now swing me back and forth. Fowler, I'm just hanging here. You're late. Everybody's already here. We have to stop the animal testing. Why? Stage four isn't complete. Well, why do you think? Father. You've seen the way he's been acting. She's so changed. Uh, yeah. There's no telling what he'll do next. He's out of control. Almost there. Back and forth, not in circles. Man, I'm gonna hurl. Straighten me out. Fowler, turn me around. I can't put the disk in with my butt. It's not my fault. Okay, okay, that's better. That's better. Uhh! Easy, easy. Here we go. Download in progress. All right. Three more minutes to download, and we're out of here. Downloading complete in 2 minutes, 48 seconds. Wait, somebody's coming. Get me up, up, up, up. Up! Up! Pull. Now it looks quite wonderful. A lab? Why wasn't I told about this? When did you have this done? As soon as I realized the awesome power of Lot 99. But I had to shroud it in deepest secrecy... Yes, even from my beloved children. Today I brought you all here to inform you that stage five testing is now complete. Stage five? Human testing. We haven't started that yet. Yes, we have. I'm proud to announce that I, myself, have been taking Lot 99 for the past, uh, six months. Ladies and gentleman, six months ago... A 76-year-old man. Or hadn't you noticed the change? Did you think this happened because I did a few extra sit-ups every day? Oh, no. Hamilton. That's unbelievable. Strength, vitality, eternal youth. Adults will never know sickness. Children will never be orphaned. We're close, people. Very close. My vital signs are equally impressive. It's him. Wolfgang, the guy I bit. What's happening? Keep up the good work. Yes, sir. Aw, come on, Cho Cho. You should be excited. We did it. Got the evidence to put them away right here. Excited? Cage and I were both students of Chin Li's. He was like a father to us. He let you down. He let everybody down. He betrayed the animals, and worst of all, he betrayed Chin Li. Maybe not. You know, maybe he was just trying to improve the herbs like he said, for mankind. How? By doping the dogs so he could make millions rigging races? That could've been Edward. It's not Edward. He's not smart enough. Besides, Cage's goon had a bandage on his left wrist exactly where I bit Chin Li's killer. We both know Wolfgang is Cage's muscle guy. One way or another, Cage is letting it happen. Easy, girl. And in Gate 4, Distant Thunder, winner of her last three starts. In Gate 5, Misery Loves Company. She's been off her feed in recent weeks, but still a viable threat. In Gate 6, Do-Si-Do. "Dominance" is her middle name. Dad, it's important. How important can it be, son? Trouble. Someone broke into the mainframe and... Speak into the microphone. Somebody broke into the mainframe and downloaded Lot 99. Oh. Oh. We found dog hairs on the computer. Cho Cho and Fowler. In Gate 7, the legendary Land's End. And finally, in Gate 8, a newcomer and certainly the underdog... me. Here. Hold it. Come on, puppies. Keep up. Boys, you ain't gonna believe this one. I got it this time. I got it. I cracked the case. Okay, Cage Sports Enterprises have been giving the greyhounds at Cage Kennel Club this type of performance enhancer, making millions of dollars on long-shot bets. Can you prove it? Yes, look. Right here. This is the formula for what they call Lot 99. What it does is, it enhances natural herbs to camouflage the added chemicals so they don't show up during tests. Now we think that Chin Li discovered it; tried to take a sample to the police. That's why they killed him. Bingo. Hi, hello, hi, hi. Thief or thieves of Lot 99, you have made a mistake big-time. Fowler... Not only will this computer blow, What the hell's this? So I have to go. You have exactly, uh, uh, uh, four seconds. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. Ahh! Fowler, what is... You cracked the case, Fowler, huh? And all our computers with it. I could have you transferred to another planet. Yeah. Yeah, good idea. This is definitely not good. * Hello? Peter? Hey. It's cold outside. You guys a little down? Yeah, well, we have reason to be. So you're just going to give up? Look, it's over, okay? Not only did my evidence go up in smoke, but there's not a cop on the force who believes me. I believe you. You do? The only way we can prove this case is if we finish what Chin Li started. We've got to get a sample of Lot 99. We? Yeah, we. Are you sure about this? I mean, let's face it: my career has gone to the dogs. Woof No offense. But, Ashley, we screw this up, you could say good-bye to any chance of becoming detective. My dad was a detective, his dad was a detective. I've been so obsessed about making detective that I've forgotten why I became a cop in the first place. Which is? To stop bad guys from hurting people... and animals. Watch out for this Wolfgang... Cage's bodyguard. He has a bandage on his left arm where Cho Cho might have bit him. That could tie him to Chin Li's death. Okay, I'm going to the vent lab. Ashley, you watch out for security. Cho Cho, you know what to do. Cho Cho knows what to do. Cho Cho...? * * Do, do, do, do, doo doo. * * Brrrrm, do, doo doo. Hoo ha! Whoo! * Do, do, doo doo, do... * Hey, Grandma, what are you doing out here? Listen, my name's Cho Cho, and I'm a cop. I need to get a sample of the stuff they've been putting in the food of the younger dogs. Don't touch that stuff. It's poison. It's like magic at first. It makes you faster, stronger. Then it begins to take over your mind. It makes you crazy. You get angry and mean. And then you start to get weaker and weaker. You know how old I am? No, even a mutt like me knows enough not to ask questions like that. I'm two years old. What? That's no grandma. That's Southern Beauty. Southern Beauty? Oh, no. Ashley, come in, where are you? I got it. I got the Lot 99. Ashley, come in. Where are you? Ahh... Shhh! I got it. Wait here, okay? I got to go find Cho Cho. Okay. Excuse me. I have a... a call. Uh-huh? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Cho Cho, where are you? Over here. Cho Cho. I got a sample of Lot 99. Let's get out of here. Better handle it with care. What are you talking about? Southern Beauty just died from it. Hold it. Don't shoot! It's just us. Fowler? Yeah. Oh, no. Well, me and my dog. What's he doing here? What are you doing here? We got a call. Armed intruder on the premises. Who made the call? I did. Lieutenant, this is the second time that your detective has, uh, broken in. I don't know whether he's working for a competitor or just obsessive. Either way, he's dangerous. That... that's a lie. It's Lot 99 that's dangerous. That stuff will kill you, Cage. Just like it killed Southern Beauty. I'm sure your superiors would love to hear about the rogue officers in your command. As a matter of fact, I'm playing golf with Chief Clark tomorrow. No, don't listen to him. He's under the influence of Lot 99. Now, you listen to me, Fowler. Unless you want to be cuffed and gagged, I'd keep quiet. Now, Mr. Cage, what can we do to make this right? And avoid a costly lawsuit? Something dramatic, I hope. Fowler, your gun and your badge. My mom has my gun. You're pathetic. What's that? Grab him by the paws. I can't get ahold of him. Grab his ears, then. What are they doing? No, let him go. Hey, what are you doing? He didn't do anything. Get off me. Hey! Who's in charge here? Pull him down. Cho Cho. Watch those fangs. Cho Cho! Cho Cho. Let him go! Please! Cho Cho! There's still no word from Officer Wilkenson? Okay, please keep calling her, and let me know the minute you find her. Okay? Thank you. And in business news... Volume up. In about an hour, CEO Hamilton Cage will be announcing the launch of Energy L99, a safe and natural energy supplement. Cage plans to have the herbal blend added to everything from potato chips to children's breakfast cereals. No, no, you maniac, you can't give that stuff to kids. Oh, my God. Take a deep breath, Peter. Whew. Okay, focus. Ashley, Ashley... Where's Ashley? One thing at a time. Oh, I got to get some help here. Forget the facts, Peter. Go with your gut. Sometimes you have to search all over the yard before you find out where one bone is buried. There you go. Now you're on to something. COLAR, you still have the floor plan data that was downloaded when we breached the Cage Biotech mainframe? Oh, you want to hack into the security cameras at Cage Biotech. Looks like I programmed some dog sense into you. Go. Show time. Curtain up. Keep scanning. I'm scanning. Cage's office. Yep. Okay... move on. We're moving on. Right... fire control hallway... You're in it. Move on. Movin' on. Mainframe. Keep scanning. We're still scanning. Fire control room. Good. Ashley. Oh, God. Enhance. Peter, do you want me to call the cops? We just did. Ashley, don't worry. Don't worry, I'm coming for you. Let me think. Search the address of the Animal Control Center, and download it immediately into my palm computer. You got it, boss. * Baby. * We done as good as we could do. * * So what if I bit a mailman but misunderstood you. * * Ooh, baby. * Why knock yourself out? * * I got the blues, blues, blues, blues. * Meow Is it over? Great. Hopefully we've heard the last of that dog-rap garbage. Kitty, how about a permanent cat nap? Hush, puppy. Dead dog walking'. Remember me, mutt? Made me look like a fool in front of them cops. Payback time. Dead dog walking. What a dork. That's my dog, and I want him back. Oh, yeah? And why would I do that? Well, I'll tell you why. Hannibal, meet the dogcatcher. This is Hannibal. He doesn't like dogcatchers. Every dog has his day, you know? All right, now I'm going after Ashley. You and boys try to break up the press conference. Get a 911 call in if you can. Yeah, I got a bone to pick with Mr. Cage. Nice doggy. Nice doggy. Doggy want a bone? You're a scientist, not a criminal. You don't want any part of this. This stuff will kill your father. But you can still save him... and yourself. Think about it. Let her go. Ahh! Rahh! * Ha! That's a burn. It's not him. Ladies and gentleman, may I have your attention. I am Edward Cage. I appreciate your patience. My father is currently... tied up by unexpected developments. I am sorry for the delay. He should arrive any moment. Hope so. Ha! Ladies and gentleman, Hamilton Cage. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please be brief. Today is a day where we celebrate the triumph of a human life. When you add all-natural L99 to your, uh, uh, products, they will transform themselves into the sustenance of... life itself. For L99 is... pure power. Pure, uh, uh... Pure, uh... uh... power. Pure, uh, uh... youth. Ladies and gentleman, I give you the future. I give you L99! * I don't know, but I've been told... * * I don't know, but I've been told... * * Kennel food is mighty cold. * Kennel food is mighty cold. * Sound off. * 1-2-3-4. Wait, what's going on? Dogs! You're going down, buddy. Okay, Dad, we got to go. Come on, follow me. Come on, look at me. Come on. Say uncle. Say uncle. Come on, Dad, we got to go. That's a good boy. Right around the corner. Now! Behind you! Where... where are we? Whoo, hello. Watch it, buddy. She's underage. I'll be 18 next month. Hey, cowboy. You talkin' to me? Nice job out there. You looking for Hamilton Cage? Well, he went thataway. Which was is thataway? The elevator, Dick Tracy. Thanks. You're okay... for a cat. Hey, take care of yourself. And come back and see me sometime. Son, this is the roof. I've radioed the helicopter. They'll be here any minute. Are you out of your mind? Retreat in our moment of triumph? Never. Triumph? You're out of your mind. I'm out of my mind? Didn't I say you were out of your mind? I'm not out of my mind. You're out of your... Oof! Cage, you don't know what you're doing. You're hurting everybody. Turn yourself in. Now. Never. Daddy? You're sick, Cage. You have to be stopped, and I don't want to have to hurt you. Well, that's certainly going to make this fight a whole lot easier for me. * Hii-yah! Intriguing. Chin Li's two best students... face-to-face. So you want to play games? Okay. Not to be uh, outdone... Ha! Huh! Ooh, doggy. Ooh, doggy. Come on. Oof! You're some package, puppy. Very clever. Well, I'd give you about a six... out of ten. That's for all the times you made a dog go fetch. Ching! Fetch this. Whoooa. Hey. Yow. Let's get, uh, serious, shall we? Oh, no. That scar. It was you I bit. It was you. Don't be so surprised. Huh! Ha! Ouch! Chin Li was like a father to you. Well, he wasn't my father. My father died and left me alone. And then I searched for that fountain of youth, so that no child would ever orphaned again. Chin Li tried to spoil that. Come on, fight like a man. Look at what you've become, Cage... a monster. A monster? If only you could feel it... the power of Lot 99 coursing through your veins like liquid gold. Hoo-ha! Want a piece of me, dog? I want justice. Well, come and get it. Huh! Hii-yah. * I'm top of the world, Daddy. Please, for Chin Li, surrender. Never. Waa-haa! Whoo. Ha ha! Missed. Missed again. Try again. Keep trying. Missed. Good try. Missed. Missed again. Ooh-ah! Hello, Clarice. * Whoosh! Okay, my ultimate weapon: super lick. Okay, here we go. Left, right. Left, left, right, right, right, right, right, left, right. Uh! And finally, this one's for Chin Li. Hii-yah! I'ma coming, Daddy. Uh! You think I'm finished? You're right. Uh! Cho Cho. Good job, Cho Cho. That was incredible. Thank you. Had to be done. Hamilton Cage, there's something I've wanted to say to you for a while. You're under arrest for kidnapping, racketeering, cruelty to animals, and conspiracy for the murder or Chin Li. Oh. Fowler! You hurt my daddy. Uhh! No! Oh, no. Cho Cho. He's been shot. Ashley, get an ambulance. Don't get all emotional. It's embarrassing. Next thing I know, you'll be licking me. Hang in there, partner. Partner? Partner. I like that. It gives me great pleasure to introduce the recipient of the San Francisco Police Department's Medal of Valor, Detective Peter Fowler. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. You know, I used to wonder what bravery really was. It was something that you'd learn, something you'd develop. But what I discovered is that bravery exists within us all: man or woman, human or animal. You just have to find it. Sometimes you need help to do that. So I'd like to dedicate this medal to someone who saved my life, someone who taught me what I really needed to learn, someone who I wish could've been here today, someone who was there when I really needed him, Cho... Cho Cho. Ladies and gentleman, the dude who really deserves this medal, Cho Cho. Now you remember what you promised. What? What did I promise? * Hello, baby. * Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speaking. * * Oh, you sweet thing. * Do I what? * Will I what? * Oh, baby, you know what I like. * * Chantilly Lace had a pretty face * * and a ponytail hanging down. * I couldn't tell you. I promised him. * Lord, made the world * go round, round, round. * Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl * * to make me act so funny, * make me spend my money, * make me feel real loose * like a long-necked goose, * like a... * Oh, baby, it's-a what I like. * What's that, baby? But... But... But... Oh, honey. Hey, Fowler. Yeah, Fowler! But... * Oh, baby, you know * what I like. Whoo. Yeah! * Chantilly Lace had a pretty face * * and a ponytail hanging down. * A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk, * * Lord, made the world go round. * * Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl * * to make me act so funny, make me spend my money. * * Make me feel real loose like a long-neck goose, * * like a... * Oh, baby, that's-a what I like. * Cho Cho has left the building. * Hey, my name is Cho Cho. * Go ahead and laugh. * Just be careful what you throw my way * * 'cause I can dish it right back. * * The way I see it, if variety is the spice of life, * * I'm a vintage wine. * And on top of that, I'm man's best friend, * * but don't you ever cross that line. * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * I'm the one who seeks the truth. * * I have from the start. * I learned it ain't so much your mind. * * You got to follow your heart. * * The way I figure it, * I can't dwell on yesterday, * * 'cause I can't change the past. * * I got to look ahead and not behind. * * For me, life goes by fast. * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * It don't matter what others may say. * * We can make this work. * But don't mind me if the mood should strike. * * This dog's known to dig a little dirt. * * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * 'Cause I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * On my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * Good God, what size is yours, then? You're one of the few people in this office with no chance of ever knowing, Charles. This is the Forte. They've just brought it in at Beanies. What's that? The Piccolo? Even if your drinks weren't penis substitutes... You'd know all about those. Bet you've got a drawer-full. You shouldn't buy coffee from Froth's or Beanies. Every sip from one of those places is raping Colombia and enriching an American corporation. Yes, well. Morning! Well, frankly, the little Italian cafe that you patronise can hardly be called a pattern of ethical virtue. It's like something out of the Sopranos, isn't it? Thank-you. Milk in first, leaf not bag? I just followed the e-mail. MARTIN: Sorry you're late, Cat. Overslept? Oh... yes. I left her sleeping. You slept with him? Christ, no. If I'd had sex with Jamie, I'd have left the house earlier than usual. I was up late watching these. The boxed set of Friends, including the lost episode and network trailers. Oh, dictionary corner, Jamie. The government needs a word for its new policy announcements. They can't call it a relaunch - they've had three already this year. I think there's a Thesaurus on this. There are no synonyms for relaunch. Oh. Technology failure, everyone. Jamie's having to fall back on his brain. "A New Beginning"? That gives the impression that they're changing tack. They are! We know that. But they want panic to look like consistency. What about "Same Shit, New Bucket"? JAMIE: "The Big Ideas"? Then they'd get sued for misrepresentation. It would be so much easier if politics were like software. They could just call it Bollocks 1, Bollocks 1.1, Bollocks XP Home Edition... Oh, look, there's a story about our Fatties campaign... TV: Profits of up to 30%. Business commentators say the shift reflects recent bad publicity over obesity in Britain and a government campaign on healthy eating. With me is the Shadow Health Secretary John Kennedy. Mr Kennedy, isn't this a triumph for the government? Their healthy eating message getting through? No, I don't accept that. But the government has just run a huge advertising campaign with the slogan... Don't Be A Fat-Head, and fast-food chains can't give chips away. You're saying it's coincidence? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Can't they get beyond just disagreeing with the other side? It's so unsophisticated. Yes, I know. The trick is compliments with a sting. This government's doing a great job, if you like extremism, political correctness, cronyism... Look, this hasn't happened because the government's paid some smart PR firm to convince people they want to be thin... Oh, hasn't it? I must say, I'm very glad to see our healthy eating campaign for the government is getting through. Though remind me not to use you as a spokesman. PR, young Jamie is about theory not practice. A philosopher may well be able to argue that a table doesn't exist, in principle. But he can still have his dinner off one. Why is the public junking junk-food? Because this is about Iraq. The public are voting with their mouths, saying to this government and its bosses in Washington, we're sick of your milk shakes. And I'll go further. In the past, we have boycotted South African wine and Zimbabwean... whatever it is Zimbabwe produces... in order to send messages to regimes despised around the world. I am asking the British public for an economic boycott of another hated administration. Let's stop buying all American food and drink. Say no to a Big Mac, say no to Iraq! I love the smell of a career burning in the morning. You think he's finished? Rule number one of British politics, don't piss in the Atlantic. The Leader of the Opposition won't tolerate Kennedy inventing foreign policy on television. He'll have to sack him for that. It's a smashing place, full of really lovely folk and locations. Namibia's main export is diamonds and, you know, that's right. Because this country is a real gem. Was that "Beautiful Botswana"? "Nice Namibia". It's homework. I always said I'd rather saw off my leg than watch a Peter Harrow programme. Ah, the tone doesn't change much. In his Zimbabwe programme, he said what a lovely smile Mugabe had. Well, now he's invited Alison and me for lunch. He's probably unsure about whether to take the knighthood from the Queen or go straight for beatification from the Vatican. Charles, there's a call from the American Embassy. Send it through upstairs. MAN: OK. That's the iris scan done. Do we conclude from all this that Britain has been added to the axis of evil? Sir, I have to warn you that humour can become a security issue. OK. Now just a few questions. Is it now... Or has it ever been? Is it now, or has it ever been, your intention to overthrow by force the government of the United States of America? Good lord! Don't tell me that thing can read minds as well? Meanwhile, there's been an escalation of support for the Shadow Health Secretary's call for a boycott of American food and drink. Many restaurants have taken American dishes off their menus. In London, people have been taking their protest against American fast-food outlets to the streets. Oh, the bonfire of the calories. How uplifting. Gentlemen, the government of the United States of America is grateful for your attendance today. Well, it shows your country is more forward-Iooking than people think. I assumed the US Ambassador would be some sort of lard-arsed red-neck. Prejudice can be a terrible thing. Mr Ambassador, Charles Prentiss and Martin McCabe. Your Excellency. J Thompson Lucas IV, Ambassador to the Court of St James. My friends call me Tommy. Gentlemen, I like to start these little meetings with a prayer. O, Lord, may thy wisdom be as a light unto the nations of the world. Amen. Amen! Hear, hear. Absolutely. I'm sorry, gentlemen. It may be a little stale in here. We've had to switch the air-con off. Students are holding a bagel-burning under the vent. You've met Hazel... under-secretary for public affairs? May we offer you some fine iced tea? You couldn't run to heated-up tea? This is kinda the way we like it. Gentlemen, we have brought you here to help us solve a mystery. Why does everybody hate America? I'll have the clam chowder, please. And a Waldorf salad to start. Easy on the walnuts, if that isn't too much trouble. I'm afraid we don't have either of those dishes today. Oh, Lord. Well, look, I'II, er... You two... I'll have the hamburger. Rare - in fact, tell the chef haemophiliac. We've taken the American dishes off the menu. Most people have the special. What's that? Fish and chips. Right. Christ. It might be cool to have ONE English retro dish on the menu as an ironic option, but not as a theme. Thank you for seeing me at such short notice. If all our clients were as little trouble as you, Prentiss McCabe would go out of business. Ah. I rather feared that's how you see me. This problem you want us to deal with... Yes. These are the latest press cuttings you sent me. "Is Peter Harrow The Nicest Man In The World?" "The Man I'd Love To Marry." "Britain's Most Shaggable Guy." I don't see the problem. You think these press cuttings are good? But have you seen where they've come from? These two come from Saga magazine. The headline goes on, "The Man I'd Love To Marry When My Husband Dies." This one, "Britain's Most Shaggable Guy." That comes from Sex For The Over-Seventies magazine. You see, I have a reputation for being nice and being old. The last travel show the BBC bought was Chris Moyles Monsters Marbella. The BBC have been sitting on Sublime Sudan for 18 months. Absolutely. That's why I need you to help me. I've had enough of being TV's Mr Nice. I need to be hated! It's unusual. Our job is normally, "She certainly didn't look 14." "He downloaded the images for his new book." That kind of thing. What you need is a reverse makeover. A hate-over! We've had some of the best minds in Washington working on this for a month, and we just do not get it. I mean, America - what's not to like? Um, Korea, Vietnam, Libya, Grenada, Iraq. The movies of Chevy Chase. Malaya, Suez, the Falklands... Iraq... Benny Hill. Gentlemen, the situation is, as I am being driven through the streets of London now, I see Ronald McDonald burning on bonfires, I see Budweiser being poured down storm-drains. Peanut-butter sales in the UK are down 90% this fiscal. Now, bad enough when the Brits all want to be skinny. But this... this Kennedy guy is running the Boston tea party in reverse. You have an expression, um, "what goes around, comes around." Do you remember that time when you were boycotting Burgundy wine and Evian water? Chirac dissed us on Iraq. Yes. Did it never occur to you that while you were renaming French fries "freedom fries" that someday someone might do the same to you? This Administration accepts that the United States has made enemies. This Administration wishes to make a fresh beginning. We want you to create a campaign that will convince the people of Britain to LOVE America again. I'll get that. I absolutely insist. You're too kind. No, it's the least I can do. I wasn't being English. I mean it. You are too kind. This is what we have to stop. Some other time, maybe. If you'll excuse me, I've got to go. I'm judging an art exhibition. Great Ormond Street. Terminal Ward. Poor kids. That's great. No, it's better than that. It's perfect. Sit down, have a brandy. Bunk off the sickle exhibition. Pictures of weeping chemo-kids in tomorrow's papers. We couldn't buy better publicity than that. Look, Jamie, maybe this could be like the last bar of chocolate before I go on the diet, eh? Oh! I almost forgot the tip. What a lovely man. Alison, did you miss this meeting? Religion. Little Jimmy Osmond. Neo-Conservatism. Spelling. J-Lo. Excellent. Now, GOOD points about America? Ben Jerry's. Botox. CHARLES: Come on, I know this is difficult. No-one's ever spun a whole country before, but... Well, there are historical examples, but they all involve either changing the name of the country or putting the black population in charge - neither of which will go down tremendously well in Middle America. CHARLES: Oh, come on! Surely the world's only superpower has got more going for it than ice-cream and cosmetic surgery. Right turn on red light if road clear. I'd bring that in here if I were transport minister. It'd be LEFT turn. Come on, Alison. You haven't said anything yet. I'm not really the person for this. Before John Kennedy was on to this, I was boycotting America. I have nothing to do with the place at all if I can help it. Oh, yes? What's your favourite film then? The Piano. Oh, Christ. Obviously. Well, apart from The Piano? Um, When Harry Met Sally... um, Lost In Translation. Um... Annie Hall. Hardly un-American activities, then. And your favourite TV shows? Um, Friends... Frasier... Seinfeld, er, Will And Grace. I think we may have discovered the truth of world politics. The only people who can be convinced of the point of America are Americans. I think the solution lies at the English end of things. I'm going to ask John Kennedy to have lunch with me. What's the point? You won't stop him spouting anti-American stuff. I don't want to stop him. I want to encourage him to carry on spouting. The English cod and French fries, please. Oh, tell me, any complaints about the new menu? The occasional American tourist. We send them round the corner to McDonalds. Sir? The all-day full English breakfast for me. And to drink? Oh, tea, tea. And in a blue-and-white striped mug, if you've got one. So, why did you want to see me? Well, as an old college friend... Which you weren't... I'm delighted to see you doing so well. No, you're not. The word at Westminster is that you're working for the American Embassy against me. No, I'm not. Yes, I am. But in PR - we're not like politicians. We don't have to believe everything we do. I'm taking their money because they asked first. But yours is the campaign that really fascinates me. There's never been anything like it in British politics. You've always said you wanted to be this nation's John Kennedy, and now... in a sense... you are. How prescient of your parents to name you after him. I know. When the Lib Dems got a Kennedy for a leader, I thought that had bollocksed it. But people never thought of Jack when they looked at him. No. More Teddy, really. So you want me to believe that you've come here to give me some free advice? Don't be silly, John! No, in my business, we take a fee off a urinal after pissing in it. Tell me, John, why don't you trust me? Because you're a satanic, amoral double-dealer who's employed by the other side. Well, you're right. I am a total bastard. And I'm playing both sides. But I won't tell my colleagues, my client, the Chancellor of the Exchequer about you, if you think that my advice is worth paying for. Well, I may, when I've heard that advice. Well, we both know, John, that you've always wanted to be leader of the Tory party. What I have in here will transform your career forever. Read it. People will call it the speech of your life. Yes, hello, this is Alison at Prentiss McCabe, leaving a message for Lulu. Um, Lulu, I got your message about whether we can get you on to Celebrity Enema. Um, I've spoken with Channel 4, and it seems that it was just an April Fools spoof in Broadcast magazine. Yep, there's actually no such series. Sorry about that. Cat, could you call Michael Winner and Jeremy Clarkson and tell them the same, please? Thanks. There's a huge picket line of liberals outside, shouting, "America, wake up and smell the coffee!" Right, let's love-bomb the Peter Harrow problem. Cat? Just nudge me a bit. Client or colleague? TV's "Mr Travel". How do we turn Mr Nice into Mr Vice? He could always sleep with your sister at your cousin's wedding. Seems to be an effective method. I'm just using that as a generic example of bad male behaviour. Although you're famous for never coming up with an idea without researching it. So, what we need is for Peter Harrow to be accused of sexual deviance and falling professional standards. Does he have a mistress who could blab? No. He fell in love with a 14-year old... That's good - the Bill Wyman of TV travel. ...when he was ALSO 14. They've been together 50 years now. Bastard. OK... Incest? No. Only child. JAMIE: It's actually quite hard to come up with anything shocking. 40 years ago, BBC presenters were sacked for getting divorced. Now, if they hump a donkey, they're on the next series of I'm A Celeb. Cat, have you got a copy of Harrow's Super Switzerland episode? Haven't you seen his back catalogue? It's for the American campaign. VOICEOVER: Britain, 2010. A fast-food giant has driven out English restaurants from the high street. If you buy the super-size fondue, you get a free William Tell doll. VOICEOVER: At the local cinema, the latest blockbuster is playing. And home-grown bands don't have a chance of topping the charts. (YODELLING) If there HAS to be a world superpower, aren't you glad it isn't Switzerland? Not bad, Jamie. Not bad at all. Which is why, Ozzy, I think you're made for the part of Shane in Emmerdale. He is a tramp, yes. Monosyllabic, but it's a great little cameo. He does indeed die in the first episode, but who wants to hang around Emmerdale, watching their career give up the ghost? And you'll be up for Best Guest Artist In A Role of Under Eight Words at the British Soap Awards. You might think you recognised the angry customer screaming at staff in that CCTV footage filmed at a London hotel this week. But then you'll have thought, "It can't be, because Peter Harrow - TV's Mr Nice - "would never do that." Right? Well, wrong, according to the tabloid newspaper which obtained that footage. The Daily News alleges that television's veteran traveller insisted three times on a change of room and responded with four-letter words when staff refused him a fourth move. We're joined by Mr Harrow's PR representative, Jamie Front. I suppose you're going to give us the usual flimflam about this being taken out of context? No. In fact, for those of your viewers who lack lip-reading skills, what Mr Harrow is saying on the footage is... "I realise that, in the pathetic little country you come from, "beds are not a high priority "because the women sleep on brothel cots and the men on mortuary slabs. "But I have walked on marble floors in Spanish cathedrals "which were more comfortable than what you laughingly call a mattress. "If you and the other Colombian drug mules "behind the reception desk weren't so busy "dashing to the lavatory to retrieve the condoms full of cocaine "floating around your bellies, "then maybe you'd have some time for your customers." Then he goes on to compare the bar staff with the Nazi party... but you get the general idea. I do. Impressively honest as well. But who do you think leaked this video to the press? It was clearly somebody determined to destroy Peter Harrow's reputation. Well, that person may have failed because we're just hearing, Jamie, that Peter Harrow has issued a full apology to the hotel staff involved... and he has agreed to give a charity lecture there. Jamie, that's got to be good news for you as his PR, hasn't it? Yes. That is entirely typical of Peter Harrow. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Force of habit, I suppose. The Times Diary rang me to ask how I felt about the hotel reception thing. I just wasn't thinking, and said, "I'm so terribly sorry." I'm so terribly sorry. I don't think I can forgive John Kennedy for tapioca being the dessert of the day at the Ivy. But I'm going to give you a second chance. I want you to go to Heathrow Airport... The American President last night authorised emergency aid to the US beef and corn industries which have been hit by John Kennedy's campaign against junk food. And there's more bad news for the White House. Mr Kennedy, encouraged by the success of his campaign, has now announced plans to stand against the leader of the opposition. Sources close to the Shadow Health Minister have suggested he'll use his first public appearance since challenging for the leadership to set out the key strategy of his manifesto. Aren't you going to stay and find out who the leader of the opposition is? Very useful for pub quizzes. I thought you said you were going to fix Kennedy. I did, didn't I? Gentlemen, this is a precaution. The FBI has put out an alert about anthrax aftershave. Yeah, I'm sorry, Tara, it was an April Fools joke... Hello. What? Oh, no. Jamie, Peter Harrow's been arrested. If there has to be a world superpower, aren't you glad it isn't Switzerland? Why everybody loves America. That had a slickness that was almost... American. The rest of it is just variations on the same theme, really. Belgium fills the high street with waffle bars. Canada replaces the Grand National with moose racing - that sort of thing. Excuse me, Mr Ambassador, we're hearing that John Kennedy's going nuclear. Think not about what that country has done to you, but rather what you can still do to that country. (APPLAUSE) This campaign has already had an effect upon our menus. But, my fellow Britons, protest can not be a la carte. What is the point of refusing to eat cheeseburgers, when every Friday night we're helping Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise to buy another yacht? (APPLAUSE) So, tonight, I am calling for a total boycott of all American products. Let our multiplexes say no to Spiderman 3, and run seasons of Peter Greenaway films instead. Let us wear plimsolls instead of Nikes and British Home Stores slacks instead of Levi's... Well, I don't think that frightening English folks with the idea of fondue and Heidi at the movies is gonna be enough, do you? Ma'am, the FBI FedExed this. Ah, the Kennedy dossier. Surveillance confirms that Charles Seymour Prentiss has been secretly advising the Kennedy campaign. Where exactly IS Guantanamo Bay? Oh, come on, haven't you learnt your lesson yet about not trusting what you read in dossiers? This was all part of the same campaign. Like Kennedy calling for the total economic isolation of the USA was gonna help us? It's a point. Look, British politics has always been Diet Coke. I spun Kennedy into giving them "the real thing". Kennedy's speech showed people what it would be like to be English, to be REALLY English - the films, the clothes, the food. Now, to use a quaint American expression of yours, that is so NOT what the British people want. I guarantee you, there'll be a run on Egg McMuffins by lunchtime. I can't believe we're celebrating a client's arrest. Is it true that you hit a Virgin check-in girl? It was pure luck. I booked myself into economy, like Jamie said. All ready to get drunk and be rude to the working classes. But the check-in girl said that my programmes were her parents' only comfort during their terminal illnesses. I said I didn't want I miss him, though. A crazy bastard, I know, but we had some good times... out there. Maybe you were a little in love with him. What? You've got some balls on you saying that. You don't really care about Fleur being an AC, do you? We're all made of the same stuff, after all. Adenine. Guanine. Cytosine. Thymine. You've lost me, Stella. DNA sequences. It's the recipe book inside each and every one of us that decides whether our eyes are blue or green, whether we're tall or short. And other more controversial things, perhaps. Where's it coming from? The atmosphere. We think there's some kind of host force on Carpathia that's listening to us and making copies of us. Listening? For want of a better word, yeah. I mean... but where is this "host force"? Where's it keeping all this information? We don't know. That sequence matches Tipper Malone's. I think we could "hear" Josie Hunter if we tried. Why are you telling me all this? Because, for whatever reason, you're Acting President. Who else knows? Tate. What is it? Lily's got C24. I'd invite you to have a coffee, but all the canteen staff are staying at home. You resigned to save her. It's like chess. You have to contest the space, think about more than your next move. All right, then. It's a bit like chess. Long as you remember it's people, not bishops and horses. Knights. Get Fleur out safely tonight. She must warn Rudi and stay with him until this is over. Cass... we all have different ways of hiding our terrors. How is she? We can save her. I know we can. But if it's reading our DNA and using ultrasound to transmit virus codes at specific targets, we're completely helpless. Do you remember bats from Earth? What about them? Bats were more powerful than the moths they preyed upon. A bat armed with echolocation, what chance does a little moth have? Not a very big one? But still a chance. The weaker species can develop its own defence strategy. Or there would be no weaker species. You think we can develop a defence strategy against them? I'd like to create an ultrasonic ceiling over Forthaven of such a distorting force that it stops them from being able to see us. Like little moths. Just like little moths. We'll set up transmitters around Forthaven and send out a jamming signal. Go! Perimeter clear! See, this is great. You're like one of them queens on the run from the angry mob. They usually got their heads cut off, Cass. Because they weren't with me. Are you nervous? Ice in my veins. I just don't care about myself. That's true. Believe it or not, I just don't care. I believe it. I just don't want to see you hurt. I know. Thanks. Make another rubbish joke now or I'll get emotional. I can't think of any jokes. Then we're really in trouble. Yeah. Come on, let's get out of here. Any sign of Fleur Morgan? I've got people patrolling all known exits, official and unofficial. We should detain Cass Cromwell for abetting her. Leave that for now. Oh, really? Look, I said leave that. Where are you going? Back to my base. Your base is that office, right? You use it. Help yourself. I'm going to get my men ready for tomorrow morning. Jack... I'm no politician and this isn't where I belong. I'm going to go and resolve the AC problem once and for all. This isn't my place. You got that right. XPs. Quadrant 6 clear! Here... No. Make like we're teenagers. What? Get back inside! Alchemist to CT10. Amendment to earlier instructions. Alliance with XP leader wearing thin. Recommend Jack Holt to be added to elimination list. Stella Isen is to be spared. Repeat, Jack Holt to be added to elimination list, Stella Isen to be spared. Affirmative, Alchemist. We have perfect thermal shield reports and we're good to go. Entry interface is seven plus two. Tell me what happened. What? Tell me now. Back on Earth, I used to work for the cartels. In the last years, the Mexicans and the Russians were running London. Very brutally, by all accounts. I was part of all that. I killed people. There was a family. This... kid came down, probably not in his teens. He was in pyjamas. I wasn't so much older myself. They said keep him quiet. Put my hand over his mouth, you know. Told myself I never meant to... Back on Earth, I saw some old news footage once. One of those wars in Europe where they all just went crazy on each other, village against village. Anyway, they had all the, er... men and boys herded together. Terrified. And... one boy... can't have been any older than the one I killed... you could see the fear in his eyes with all the soldiers and their guns and everything, probably knowing he was going to die. And he was holding this little white rabbit. Stroking it. It must have belonged to him, you know, a family pet or whatever. So frightened, but all the time he was still petting this rabbit. And when I dream about it... the face I see is that frightened little kid with his little rabbit. The one I never met from the news footage. That was what turned me. You know, I gave a lot of people up and in return, I got this. Ultimate witness protection. Tate saved me. He gave me my second chance to be decent, to be... Human. I don't believe that humans are bad, Cass. We can change. We're not prisoners of our circumstances. Or even our genes? Maybe not. Maybe, in the end, we can still design ourselves. Stella, the jamming signal's ready. I want them all transmitting at the same time. Right, run a check. Finally able to deal with the ACs. Fleur! I'll fire a flare. Come back when you see it. OK. Go. Go. How's my daughter? Still pre-symptomatic. We've had another fatality. Not Tipper? No. But he's in the last stages. I came to offer some distant healing. The XPs have gone to remove the source of the virus. Do you really believe that, Julius? Or do you no longer know what you believe and what you don't? I know that I care about you. And I know that I want you to make the right decisions. The right decisions being the ones that accord with your own. I've heard about this sonic shield idea. Yeah. We're nearly there. I think it's our only hope. I think we should hold off on that just for now. What? Let's wait until the AC problem is resolved. We don't have time for that. It'll use too many resources. And it could interfere with other important signals. What other important signals? All I'm saying is, once Operation Public Health is complete, we can revisit it. People are dying. My daughter... And they're all in our prayers, but... It's when you pray that I trust you the least. What are you planning? An end to the slack, failed Utopia Tate has created. I meant what I said. Carpathia has to change, Stella. I want you to be a part of that change. You have to come. I need you. What's going on? Berger's trying to undermine the ultrasound defence. Call Jack. Get him to the comms room before Berger turns him round. OK. You're one of us. I'm glad. Are you? Tate is a liar. I hope he's the last to die down there, alone... with the ghosts of his past for company. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I thought... maybe I could stay with you until this is over. It'll never be over, not until they're gone for ever. Soon I will be a father again. Others are bearing children. We are growing in number. For us, it's just the opposite. Us? The attacks by your soldiers, the presence of children... We have to move. And go where? We're planning a long journey. We can start again, on our own. We should wait. There are far too many good people down there for this to happen. You belong with us now. Anybody down there has no hope. Perhaps... one day we can return. I thought you were heading out. Yeah, Stella called me in. Said she's got some idea about a sonic shield. Oh, no, that's nonsense. She just likes to play smart, you know that. Jack, you've got the green light, so go out and deal with our problem like you said you would. No, she is smart. We should still try everything. Jack. There's another transporter coming. Do you remember what you said to me once? You either work the mine or you own the mine. I'm telling you right now, you can own the mine. Stop what you're doing. Ignore him. You no longer give orders around here. This is our only hope of defending ourselves. It can wait. Seems like about the right time to mention the imminent arrival of CT10, a transporter carrying a new hope for Forthaven. That's ridiculous, we would have seen it on our screens. They didn't want to be seen, Richard. They are coming. I've been in contact with its commander. It seems your shield will interfere with its landing. Julius, the shield is our only hope against the virus. I really don't believe that you are a bad person. Bad. Good. What, you really believe in moral absolutes? He certainly doesn't. You know nothing of my morality, you insect. People are going to die if we don't act soon. I gave you a chance, Stella. Ignore this lunatic. Turn it on. You do what he says, you'll pay a very heavy price. I order you to wait for my instructions. Aren't you forgetting something? Hm? I'm still President. Why are you laughing? Because everyone knows Tate did that as a strategy. Maybe. Jack, I assure you... Stella didn't sneer. She came to tell me about the DNA and the shield. I'm not sneering. On the outside. Do you know what? I helped to build this place. And got no recognition for it. Look, I can still offer you far more than they ever can. You know what? Stella's right. These guys coming in here aren't going to respect much. But I can offer you your life, Jack. If you betray me now, you will go the same way as the others. You traitor. Things aren't going to be pretty until order and discipline are restored. But believe me, I'm not sneering when I say your life is what's at stake right now. I don't respond well to threats. Too bad... I'm taking you back to the XP base where you can't interfere any more. And I'm resigning the Presidency now. Have it back. Whatever's coming, I take orders from you guys again. You'd better make the most of this. When the history of Carpathia is written, this won't be its longest chapter. No, but it will be a fine one. We'd better hope this works. Turn it on. LDP signal lost to Alchemist, Captain. We've got some kind of ultrasonic interference. Switch to emergency coordinates for entry interface. We'll just have to risk it. Poor miserable human. Why are you torturing us? We're researching you. Living fossils. Surely you can understand that. Will you let us stay here? Live in peace? We could learn from each other. We can overcome your defences if we choose. Then why don't you? Because you are still interesting to us. Gaze on our struggles and sufferings with detached indifference. Well, well. Who needs God, eh? Your species is a brutal and destructive one. And less significant in this universe than a single bacteria on a coral reef. Maybe. But we have one thing you appear to have lost in your evolution to disembodied know-it-all. We may be frayed at the edges, but we still have love. And while we have that, we still have hope. He's still very weak. Hi. I was eating ice cream with my sisters. You're back now. Thank you. I'm really glad to be alive.

It is your duty to try this case on the evidence you hear in this court alone. Jail, Theresa! For getting you off jury service. Do you have any idea how far gone you might be? I'm assuming there's been no progress over your getting to America? I have an appointment for a visa application at the America Embassy. Generally, it's safe, isn't it? To use an agency like yours? It's perfectly safe. I met someone today. - Natasha Williams. - Paul Brierley. Is she bonny? She is. I was a jury member. In the first trial. The time is just about eight minutes past seven, and this is James Naughtie. Now, ahead of tomorrow's House of Commons vote on the Jury Abolition Bill, we're going to talk about the sensitive question of trial by jury. And joining us now in the studio is Lewis Jenkins QC. - Good morning. - The Minister for Justice, Eleanor Duncan, is making her case for the abolition of juries on the grounds of cost and efficiency. But also on the ground that jurors are somehow unable to appreciate some of the legal arguments, the jargon, perhaps. Well, with great respect, I think that is somewhat insulting to people who've served on juries. Breakfast's ready! I've made you some porridge. I'll be right there. I thought you said it was forbidden to do your own research in the trial. It is. I'm not researching the trial. I'm researching a juror. The Jury Part 3 ITFC Subtitles Sync: Marocas62 Thank you very much. When I need you, I will call you back. Yes, please. Next customer? At the Philadelphia Convention, delegates from 12 states - Rhode Island chose not to attend - met to amend the articles of confederation. But, as the convention progressed, it was decided to draft a new constitution which required only nine of the 13 states to ratify it. Heading off now, Mum. See you later. Mum? Oh, God. Oh, God! Mum! It's all right, it's all right. Stay where you are, stay where you are. London's number one. Capital Breakfast. "Hi! Romeo Boy you look fine." "Where shall we meet?" "Tonight. The Coach and tHorse Pub. Liverpool Street. 8.30." It was a triple homicide. A man called Alan Lane murdered three professional women he met on internet dating sites. It was all over the media back home. Home then being England? Right. I moved to Vancouver two years ago. Anyway, the real trauma happened afterwards. What did happen afterwards? They took it to the Court of Appeal. Irregularities were uncovered. Our verdict was thrown out, just like that. But you were the foreman of this jury, right? Right. It was devastating. Just devastating. At first, we thought they'd made a mistake. We wanted to let the authorities know about his condition and get him exempted for his own sake. - Rashid didn't want that. - Not at all. He was adamant. "It's my trial", he said. So he went. - And how's that been? - Amazing. He's obsessed, works on it all hours. Researching it, studying it. He's up there on his computer morning and night. As you know, obsessive interest in something is typical of Asperger's. Just keep an eye on his manageability... sleep. Make sure he gets enough of it, eats regularly. It's a fine balance. We want him to be engaged. We don't want him to crash and burn. Of course, of course. We understand. Look, the fact is, she'll be admitted, and they'll probably spend most of the day doing a... chest X-ray and blood tests. I'd say, give... AE Reception a call around four o'clock.

You've got more important things to do. Mum, believe me, this sort of thing happens to jurors all the time. The trial can wait. I'm not talking about the trial. I'm talking about... about your lunch. I can see you've made an effort. Now, go on. You'll be late. And for God's sake, don't tell her you're living with your mother. - Yeah. - Hey. It's me. Do it. Global warming. Myth or reality? - What? - You heard. Which? Lucy... I haven't got time for this. I've got another session with the lawyers. - It's important. - Yeah. Well, not as important as... Myth! America. Global leader or global scourge? What is this? Leader. Doctors. Should they be allowed to assist suicide - on compassionate grounds? - What? ! No. Yes! - I don't know. - Which? No. No. And finally... Simon Cowell or David Beckham. Who would you rather? Simon Cowell. All right. And at the end of the quick-fire round, we score zero. Which means... we're in even deeper shit than I thought. Leaving. - Why? - Think about it. You're the juror here, not me. Yours was the name that was selected, not mine. - So? - So... yours is the only opinion that matters. It's bad enough me impersonating you. But misrepresenting you takes it to a whole new level. What if it's a hung jury and yours is the casting vote? Someone's life is effectively at stake. - What are you saying? - I'm saying... you're the person whose opinion and vote counts. We need to make sure it's your opinion that is offered. Well, how do we do that? I'm busy. We make time. I fill you in on everything and then you vote. I can't do this. You've got a visitor. Everything all right? - Big day for you today. - I'll be fine. How do you think it's gone so far? It felt like we've been getting a bit of a kicking recently. Well, that's...pretty normal for this stage in the process. And I quite like this jury. And I get the feeling... more importantly, that they quite like us. My Blackberry. I can't... switch it off. So. Top brass... this morning. DSI Babyface! He's Commander Babyface now, if you please. Grown up. Must be all of 35! Cocky twat. Well...if that's what he's like, that could be good for us. Plus, they no longer have that piece of evidence. And given the role one of Babyface own officers played in that, it may put him on the back foot. But I've got one or two surprises up my sleeve. They're not the only ones who've been busy since the first trial, you know. Drives me bloody mad! Right. I'll see you in there. Sorry. Mr. Mallory. State your full name and rank, please. Commander Neil Howson, Metropolitan Police. Commander. May I start today by congratulating you on your recent promotion? Promotions. At the time of the murders, however, you were a Superintendent? Detective Superintendent. That's correct. Could you please tell the court when you first came across the name Alan Lane? It would've been early 2006, when he became the prime suspect in the murders of Holly Jackson, Anna Knight and Rebecca Chung. Why, in your opinion, had Alan Lane become the prime suspect? Because the evidence we gathered showed that he was, by some margin, the clearest common denominator between all three victims. So you arrested him and brought him in for interview. And the decision to charge him with all three murders came when? Within a few hours of questioning. With a clear discrepancy between his version of events and events we could establish beyond doubt. In other words, when he lied to you. Correct. In a... high profile case, such as this, operating in the glare of the media, when police work comes under scrutiny... ..and there is a real pressure for a swift conviction... ..there is often a nail-biting time for police when they... wonder... whether they really got... the right man. Did you ever feel this? If you're asking, have I ever felt that before, yes. Did I feel it in this case? Never. Not for a second. In fact, rarely have I slept better. I am perfectly... 100% satisfied we got the right man. Thank you. No further questions. Good morning, Commander... Howson. Morning. Let me start by adding my congratulations to those of my learned friend. Detective Inspector, Detective Superintendent, Detective Chief Superintendent. The word meteoric hardly does it justice. - Thank you. - And congratulations too for acting so swiftly in arresting Mr. Lane. You know, it's such a relief when people do what they're hired to do. - Get things done. - My Lord? It's true, isn't it, that you were hired amid considerable controversy, aged 29... to replace a Detective Inspector who had let a very high profile murder investigation - of a young mother drag on. - Come to the point, Ms. Watts. The point, My Lord, is that the then Detective Superintendent Howson would never make the same mistake. Allow a Metropolitan Police investigation to drift. Or allow his superiors to be hauled over the coals in the media. He knew what side his bread was buttered. - And he was going to arrest someone. - And save public lives. Or do you think it's a coincidence that, since Alan Lane has been in custody, there have been no further murders in the area matching the same MO? Not a coincidence. I have another explanation for that, Commander. And we will come to it. Shortly. In the meantime, I believe I'm the one asking the questions. You said that Lane was the only common denominator between the three victims. No, that's not what I said. I believe if you check the record, I said 'the clearest.' So you are aware that there were other men who had enjoyed communication with all three victims. I am aware there were one or two. Well, as it happens, there were six. And among them... one... Thomas... Dent. Does the name mean anything to you? Of course. Then you will be aware that not only did he... have extensive e-mail and telephone contact with all three of the women... ..but he also had a history of... domestic violence... substance abuse... and mental instability. But perhaps more significantly, he was known to police as someone who had regularly visited dogging sites. It's especially relevant in this case, as the woodland where the third victim was murdered, Huntley Common, is a known dogging site. Well, I can assure you Mr. Dent was thoroughly investigated. Apparently, not thoroughly enough. Because nowhere in your report, or charge, did you make the connection that all three victims had shown an interest in, or had histories of sexual exhibitionism. I'm sure my officers were perfectly aware. Well, if they were aware, Commander, then it follows that you would be able to provide the court with the name of the website where all three women communicated most frequently... with Mr. Dent. I'm quite sure I can. No, no. Let me spare your blushes. is the name of the site where the victims all met Thomas Dent. Yet there is barely mention of him in your police report. - Why is that? - We ruled him out. And anyway, if he is such a compelling suspect, why don't you summon him? He took his own life. He was found hanging from a doorway in his apartment less than two months after the death of Rebecca Chung. His computer... at the time of death... was still logged on... In the light of all of this, Commander Howson, do you still feel 100% certain... ..that you arrested the right man? Absolutely. Really? Thank you. No further questions. Thank you, Ms. Watts. Two o'clock, please. All rise! Taxi! You're not eating? Not hungry. How could I be after what I discovered this morning? I did a little research... after our chat last time on... Omaha, Nebraska. You see, I couldn't quite figure out why your brother had gone there of all the wonderful places available to him in America. Well, then I... I found out. That's where they're all sent. - Who? - Refugees. From Sudan. There's a whole community of you there. Yes. 10,000. Among them, half my village. Dear boy...why didn't you say? A few of us were lucky. We heard them coming. The sound. Their horses... and their laughter. Oh, the...the rebels. The... Janjaweed? We didn't wait to see them. We just ran. Out into the bush. Me and my two brothers. Behind us in the village... they killed all the men and boys. Including my father. We covered our ears, but we heard the gunshots. And then they raped all the women. Including... We covered our ears, but... ..we heard the screams. In the bush, there were other boys... from other villages. And we started to walk. In the beginning, we were 12. When we arrived at the camps... we were five. When the Americans came a year later, we were just three. But your brothers? One made it...one did not. I'm so very sorry. Why... England? Before me was a plane to America. It was my brother. They said another plane was going to follow, but... The plane was to England. And your brother went to Omaha, Nebraska. With others from my village. Well, you'll get there soon. Yes. Inshallah. I hope. Apple meringue today. OK. OK. - I will if you will. - Good. There's your token. And your towel. Booth number four. - Thank you. - Cheers, love. Would you like to know the sex? Eventually, yes. Would you like to know today? How? You can't possibly tell. Why not? Isn't it too soon? Don't you have to wait until... How far gone am I? Well, looking at these measurements, I'd say... - ..18, 19 weeks. - What? And if I don't want to go through with it? If it's... totally impractical? That's a decision you're going to have to make quickly. How quickly? Your mother's comfortable and the doctor says she's stable. OK. We'll call if there's any change. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you. I'll call you back later. Thanks. Hi. Hi. I'm...sorry if I kept you waiting. No, not at all. So. Tell me about your fellow jurors. The gang. The Liquorice Allsorts. Well, that's how I like to think of them. It's hard to say, really. The only time we spend together is in court. And then it's mostly in silence, so... Do you get any idea how they feel? About Lane? That's something we haven't discussed. You know how firm they are on that sort of thing. Of course. But not even an inkling? No. But for me... ..a lot changed this morning. Up until today, it was hard to believe he could ever be innocent. But hearing that stuff about the other man... You know? Thomas Dent? - Interesting. - Right. And I think we all like her. - His barrister. - Yes, she's quite a character. Always a little... ..ripple of excitement in the jury box whenever she gets up. It just shows you the difference a good barrister makes. Because right now, it's hard to imagine us... returning the same unanimous verdict you did. Well, there's another critical difference between our trial and yours that you don't know about. And not just a new barrister. Or should I say tiny...difference? Microscopic...difference. But I'm not in a position to tell you what that is. Strict confidentiality, and so forth. Ruled inadmissible by the Court of Appeal. - I understand. - And anyway... How can I trust you not to tell anyone? Well, I never tell on my friends. But I completely understand. Are we? Friends? Well, I... I hope so. Or could become so. Sorry. Was that very presumptuous? - No. - Good. OK? It's time. Remember, head up. Look directly into my eyes. Speak loudly and clearly and unapologetically. OK? You're gonna be fine. Yeah. I call the defendant... Alan Lane. I swear by almighty God... that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Good luck. Give the court your name, please. Alan Dennis Lane. And your last known address, before your arrest? 32 Oak Park Gardens, London, SW17. Have you always lived in London? No. Er... I come from Hull. Or... Hell, as I like to call it. It's certainly where you're going. So, what brought you south? I couldn't get work. And my dad wasn't too well. But there was another reason too, wasn't there? Sandra got a job down here. Sandra being your girlfriend at the time. That's right. So one might say you came to London for love. That were the idea, but... it didn't work out like that. It wasn't long before Sandra met someone else at work and... and before I knew it... she wanted out. And me out of the flat. I got into a bit of a state. In fact, you... you suffered a reactive clinical depression, as your medical records show. Brought on by the shock of your girlfriend's rejection and your being made homeless. You were... you were put on medication. - Did it help? - It helped with the moods, but... it didn't help socially. Why was that? Well, the thing about the pills is, you can't mix 'em with drink. So that immediately limits the kind of places you can go to to meet people. So, what did you do? whose managing director we heard from yesterday. - Yes. - So how was that? Well, it's fine, as long as you're not expecting to find actual romance. I'm sorry. I don't understand. No-one's serious. It... it's just one big free for all. Everyone's just looking for erm... What? I can't. I'm sorry. You know. I can't... Sex? That's right. That's right. Yes. As opposed to... committed relationships. - Yes. - Like Holly Jackson? A woman you believed was looking for companionship. A proper relationship. She said so in her e-mails. And an exchange developed between the two of you, culminating in her suggestion of a meeting. Tell the court what happened next. When I got to the house, she opened the door. - It were a bit of a shock. - Why was that? Well...she were attractive all right, but... ..she was different to what I'd... - imagined or hoped for. - How? Just the way she were dressed. You know. She... She obviously wasn't shy. Anyway... I went into her front room and she offered me a glass of wine. I said no... because of the medication. Water'd be fine. She seemed disappointed at that. The fact that you... weren't drinking. I got the impression that she might've already had a few glasses herself. Anyway, all of a sudden, she makes her move and suggests that we go upstairs. Well, I followed her up. And then I saw the room from the landing. I told her. I felt uncomfortable. I wanted no further part. So you never actually entered the bedroom, where she was subsequently found. Never. No. I were out the door and gone. With...with cheap insults ringing in my ears. But with Anna Knight... - the story was different. - Yeah. That were different. I felt there were a connection, right from the first e-mail. Including when we met. So, when she didn't respond to my e-mails or my text messages afterwards, I couldn't understand it. I wrote her e-mail after e-mail without getting a reply. And then I... I did something that... I now deeply regret. Which was? I killed her. I followed her. And this was on... the 2nd of March 2006. That's right. Yeah. She...she went to show a house... where the buyer, a man, was waiting. Did you see this man? No. His back were turned to me. And my view was blocked at that moment by a bus. This would be the number 42, Mr. Mallory, which when it stops, is directly in the defendant's line of sight, given that we know the car was parked here, the bus stops here, and here...is number 23. - Can you describe him? - White... tall, dark hair. - In a suit. - Is there anything else that struck you? Because it is my firm belief... ..that this was Thomas Dent. No. Like I said, his back were turned to me and... And then my phone rang. - Mrs. Banerjee. - That's right. Telling me my glasses were ready for collection. What time would you say that was? Oh, I... I dunno. Three? 3:30? So, where were you when you took this call? In my car. Which was parked where? Outside 23 Seven Sisters Street. Were you ever in the house that day? Oh, I never got out of my car. So, not in the house at the time of the murder. Nor were you in the bedroom where Holly Jackson was murdered. Nor were you ever... on Huntley Common in the woodland, where the third victim Rebecca Chung's body was found. - No. - But you did know Rebecca Chung. And you had been for a drink with her at the Green Man Pub the night before. Correct. Yet, when you were subsequently interviewed by police... you denied it. Why? Cos he's a liar. I were confused. 20 policemen had just stormed into my house at 5AM. I were taken down to the police station. Everyone's talking about three women being killed. I haven't done anything! With conection the first two, they'd got my name... I don't know any bloody Rebecca! ..they'd got my text messages, they'd got my e-mails. So in connection with the third, I just panicked. I started denying everything I could. Out of self-preservation. Yes. If you had your chance again in that police interview... what would you say? I'd say... Yes. I did meet Rebecca Chung for a drink... at the Green Man Pub on the 29th of March 2006. For an hour. But we didn't click. You know? Sometimes it just goes that way. So...we said goodbye, and we went our separate ways. And you didn't hail some minicab and double back and lie in wait for her and kill her. No. I do remember him stopping, though. He wanted 15 quid to take me home. It was a bloody joke. Excuse me. But you didn't get in. No. So, why weren't you in the CCTV footage one minute later? - Because a bus came. - A bus came. Yeah. Well, that's what generally happens when you wait at a bus stop. Yeah. Thank you. No further questions. Well, well, well... ..Mr. Lane. Yes, I'm sure none of us can wait, Mr. Mallory. But let's do this tomorrow morning. 10:00, please. Yes, My Lord. All rise! OK. I'll be at yours for 7:30. You might wanna get some food in, too. Rashid? - Can I help you, love? - Oh, yes. I'm here to see my mother. June Brierley. I'll...see if I can find someone to come and... have a talk with you. - Thanks for doing this. - I can't believe I am. So he goes on the internet, looking to find a monogamous relationship. But the problem is, none of the women are looking for love. Right. They're looking for a good shag. Right. Then, when he discovers that... ..instead of skipping for joy, like any normal bloke, he feels deeply betrayed, loses his temper and kills them. Doesn't sound like any man I've met. If you saw him, you'd understand. He's like... a big, wounded, needy baby. Give me a nasty, cold-hearted philanderer any day. Have you ever done anything like that? Like what? - Dating sites. - Sure. Yeah. I must say, I've always been sneakily tempted. Cos otherwise, who do you end up dating in life? People from the office. From the gym, friends of friends. I mean, basically, people right under your nose. Where's the surprise or the romance in that? - Romeo Boy. - That's me. I hope you don't mind the photo. It is me, I promise. Well, it was. Once. Well...do you want a drink? I'm sorry. I think I should go. - What? - This is a mistake. Well, make up your mind, love! Do you think I live in central London? It's... I've come all the way from bloody Orpington. It's taken me an hour to get here! I'm sorry. Taxi? ! Sir, please go. Just go. I'll tell you the address. Our Father...which art in heaven... ..hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come... thy will be done... on Earth...as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... ..as we forgive them that trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation. For thine is the kingdom... the power and the glory... ..Amen. Goodnight. - Mr. Takana. - Takana. And...? - He did do it, didn't he? - Is that what you think? - Isn't it what YOU think? - That's not the point. - Why are you here? - I thought I'd offer you a few dos and don'ts in case things get especially rough today. - Are they likely to? - Yeah. - It was ruled inadmissible. - That piece of evidence. But you don't think it should've been. No. It could change everything. What do I do, Mum? ITFC Subtitles Sync: Marocas62 Since the time of my elders, when the white man first came upon us, we have struggled to survive, and live our peaceful ways. But their shadow cast its curse upon our people and darkened all our days. They took our small ones, and sold them as slaves. They took our scalps and sold them for profit. Our heads were severed for more. Our hearts were full of sorrow. We prayed to the Great Spirit in the sky: Do not abandon us. Our only reply.... the sound thundering hooves upon the chest of our Mother Earth. The sound that was once the Great Buffalo is now of only those who come to take our lands. Welcome to Yellow Rock Gentlemen. Whisky for all of us. Leave the bottle. Thank you, sir. You remember me? Yeah, I remember you. I'm looking for Tom Hanner. You know where he is? He's probably drunk somewhere. He don't come around here no more. Where is he? I really don't know. That's more like it. Try the church. - Give me a bottle of whiskey. - Yes, sir. That'll be 25 cents. Dietrich. Thank you. I need to talk to you, Tom. I heard you lost your boy. I'm sorry to hear that. My brother and his son went trapping. They never came back. Around Falcon's Peak. That's near the Black Paw territory. I need you to take me and my men out there. It's the only kin I have, Tom. And you're the only man I know who could find them. They don't take kindly on white men. I know that. That's why I need you. There is $ 20 gold. And more once we get up there. Did you found him? Yeah. Dietrich! Look at me, son-of-a-bitch! I am McKInley's son. You remember him? Get up. Get up! Tell us or die. Go get him. Hanner? You're in there? He ain't in there, boss. Where is he at? I tried to relieve it. Take his pulse. I have to open up his leg and make a suture. Explain it. Tell her to keep calm. You have to hold him back. Hold him down tight. I have his leg. Come on! I'll kill you, son-of-a-bitch! What the hell are you shooting at? Hold it. There are more of them. Come on! Come on! I'm just stepping on ahead. How about that one, Farley? Yeah, siree! I got it good. That ain't even good meat. Out of the way. Jack ass. Indians believe that killing a raven is a bad omen. Doctor, what should we tell her? Goddamn it, Farley! What the hell are you up for? Have you seen a ghost? Goddamn, you're a damn jack ass. Hey, Mr. Dietrich. You want a little whiskey? Put that away. You want some? - You've seen him, huh? - I hardly know the man. They say the ancient ones work through your hands. When moon rises, they're gonna sing for Little Bear, with the spirit of the gods. And they want you as an honored guest. I'm the one who's honored. They give many thanks to you. Many blessing. I'll be back before moonrise. There's a cabin, a few miles out. At the end of Canyon Creek. We will stop there. Why? This is Black Paw territory. They know we're here. Without their permission to pass, this is as far as we're going. There's a doctor at that cabin, she takes care of them. She'll do the talking for us. - Can't you do it? - I'm afraid not, this is the only way. That's the medicine you need to give to your daughter. You need to give the medicine. Sarah! He doesn't understand what I'm saying. Put ? two spoons. Wait here, I'll let you know. Anybody home? I'm just here to see the doctor. You're talking to. Tom Hanner. You look like hell. Yeah, it has been a tough year. That's why I am here to talk about. I need your help. How long have they been missing? About a week now. It'll take a while to search, a few days at least There's no telling what injuries we're dealing with. All I know is that they didn't come back and that sure ain't good for my brother and his boy. Then there is no time to waste. Tom, if you gonna lead through the territory, you're gonna need full consent from all the elders. The doctor better come back with the right answer. Mister, she'll come back with the only answer that there is. Hanner. He doesn't understand our language well. I tell him why you are here. We do not know where they are at. They were trapping near Falcon's Peak. They could have crossed your territory by mistake. I know you have no reason to help us. But we just mean to find the man and the boy, and get of your land as quick as possible. You seem to speak truth, but the white man has lied to us before. Those were dark days for us. Did you take money from these white men? Yes. You take money to save two lives, there is no honor in this. You're right. He says your heart is good, you speak the truth, but we must talk alone. I thought you'd left these people by now. Why? These people needed me, that's what mattered. You're all alone. No, I was alone back there. We have permission to pass through, tomorrow. Aces. Three cowboys. It's round-up time! Damn it Roscoe, that's four hands in a row! If you weren't so busy drinking, you'd better cards to play. If you don't shut your trap, I'll shut it for you. Why do we bring him along with us! To hell with you, Farley. You're always cutting on me. You want to shut my trap, old man? Then why don't you shut it, shut it! I'm not gonna warn you again, you hear me? - Do you hear me? - Yeah. It smells like shit in here, lady. That's because you boys need bath. Don't worry none, the horses don't mind. So what are we gonna do if our Indian friends deny our request? One way or the other, we're going up there. We're giving thanks with this sacred necklace. It's a very powerful gift. The Great Hunter came down from the mountain and he sees a woman with long red hair. But he cannot wake her, so he takes you two... to the mouth of the rock to save you. Dr. Sarah is a protected one. Beautiful, isn't it? Very. If you can not they'll find, just make sure you all find your way back. Thank you, ma'am. You take good care of the doctor. She's a strong one all right, but just in case I'm counting on you. Don't you worry about that. I have a good feeling about you. Don't make me wrong. Martha. - Give Totano his aspirin. - I did, Sarah. I did. - Do not forget the man with bedsores. - I know, doc, I know. I know you hate leaving, but we will be fine. You're the one I'm worried about. I don't get a good feeling about them. I mean when you was gone, they acted like a bunch of rodnecks. I got your meaning. I'll be careful. Okay, come on. Ma'am. I have to say is awful nice having a member of the fair sex around of us. If you stay close, I'll keep you safe. I'll do fine by myself. Oh, I'm sure you'll do. Stop! - We can't go in there. - Why not? We're close to their sacred burial ground. If we go in we'll bring the curse. We have to find another way. It will cost us another day or two at least. To hell with that, we're going in. Let's go! - I don't like this. - I don't like it either. It's thin air, huh Roscoe... Shut up, Billy. A bunch of dead Indians, huh. I want you to understand something, Mr. Dietrich. That burial ground was sacred to them. And we desecrated it, when we walked through. And I want you to understand, I don't give a damn about these Indians. All I care about is finding my brother and his boy. Farley, what the hell was that? Farley, what is going on? What is this? Are it the Indians, huh? It's wolves. Don't let them get to the horses! Billy, you see them? Stay close. Roscoe! Let no one away! They're all around us, god damn it! He says they're hunting us. Roscoe! Don't you stand there, help me! Get them off! Hold it. Help me! His arm, I think it's broken. Get me my bag. Do you think the Indian is right? It's the curse? He's praying to the Great Spirit for forgiveness for crossing the sacred land. We could use it. I guess we both know we should have listened to him last night. Yeah, you're right about that. Whiskey is not a cure for all answering. I know. But it helps. After my wife passed away it was just me and my boy. I took him trapping one day. He was fooling around... and went chasing after possums. He fell into a river bed... Before I knew it... the river had him... by the time I got to him... He was only 8 years old. I am sorry, Tom. Truly. You know I... I look into the face of death every single day. I'd wish I could defeat it, but I can't. I try. Because a person's fate is not always in our hands. - Maybe it's time to be different. - Maybe. - I sure hope they'll find that boy. - Me too. It seems we're more concerned about than they are though. You noticed that too? You do know Dietrich, don't you? A bit. But I stay mostly to myself these days. Last night they didn't recognize the sound of wolves. But they told they were trappers. - Dietrich told you that? - That's right. - That's horseshit. Good morning. I need to talk to Broken Wing. She has a soft spot for that Indian. I don't trust him. - I'm just saying. - Just saying what? I'll tell you what Hanner, you mind your business and I mind mine. - Hey, what's he doing? - It's gonna help you, all right. - What did he say? - He said: Now you are "broken wing" too. God damn Indian! Get, get! Get him out of here! Relax. - I don't want his voodoo around me. - It's all right. It's gonna hurt an itch a little, so leave it alone. Here. That don't get you luck. That's poison oak. Billy just found a place to water the horses, back up there ways. Okay, let's see it. Hold it right there! Boss! Get down of that horse. I said get down of that horse! Cobb! How close are we to Falcon's Peak? This is Falcon's Peak. You want to find your kin? You go find them. I ain't helping you. This is horseshit. What's happening? Let's go! McKinley / Johnson Mining Company Cobb, get him! Get him! Don't you move, son-of-a-bitch! - What the hell is going on? - What does it look like? Looks like you're a goddamn liar. - Tie him up and drag him. - No. Don't you touch him! Don't you touch him! Damn, god damn you! You ain't dead yet? Hey son-of-a-bitch, I'm talking to you. Hey drunkard, you want a drink? - Look at this. - Come on, move it down. Warning! McKinley / Johnson Mining Company Give me a hand. I got it. I got it, I got it. Wait up. Watch it! There, Roscoe. Hurry up, Roscoe. Son-of-a-bitch. - That old man was right. - Damn! How much you figure we got here? More than enough! Look at this. - I can not believe! - Have you seen? This is gold! Pure gold. Go. Let's start get this on the horses. I ain't leaving. Come on, move it! Move it! Boss! Boss! That Indian is gone! Boss, that Indian is gone! Boss! That Indian is gone. Damn it! Go find him before he brings more back here. We ain't going nowhere until we work out a split. There is plenty of gold. Yeah Farley, with Billy's take, there is more for all of us. He has been buried just 15 minutes. And you already are taking his cut? He's dead. He can't use it. You're wasting time! Go find that Indian! What the hell are you doing? That Indian is gonna have running us around in circles. Get him up. I need him to get me back here. They never gonna find him. And he's gonna come back and kill you. I don't trust Max. If he tries anything, it'll be the last thing he does. Relax Farley, we'll get back to camp. If he's still to camp, we'll take Max. We've gone far enough. I'm going back for the gold. Come on, Mr. Hanner. Me and you here. Get up! What? You want a gun, Hanner? Get the hell up, Hanner! You want this? Here you go. You want it? What do you want? I want your blood. - Where the hell have you been? - We couldn't find our way back. Where is Hanner? He's dead. Where is the gold? I got as many bags I can out of there. Tomorrow morning you can get your fat ass in there and get the rest. I can't figure out why they didn't come back for that gold. They never left. They died here. They caught the white man's disease. Shut up. The only one I can't cure, the only one the Indians are immune to. The Indians were right. You got the fever for yellow rock. - There ain't no such thing. - Yes, there is! - There ain't! - Yes, there is! There ain't no such thing! - I told you to shut up. - You shut up! Let me tell you something. The Indians say, when the white man came, they opened a wound in that mountain. They cut its veins. And he mountain bled. And the caught the fever. They were riddled with it. I see the symptoms. In all of you. It makes you sweat, it makes you a headache. You can't think of anything else but the gold. You feel it? I see it in all of you. You're just trying to take that gold out of the mountain. And you won't make it down alive. You hear me? You got it the worst. There is no curing you. No curing you! Keep your goddamn mouth shut! You're all gonna die here. You hear me? Hey, boss. What she said last night about that curse... You think there is anything to it? What the hell are you talking about? The gold... Why ain't nobody come back for it? Because those jackasses probably got killed by the Indians and they left it behind. Go tend to those horses. Yes, sir. You're gonna do what you said? Just load the gold on, and I'll kill them all. Get your ass up here. Shit! I need some water. Can I have some water, please? Please. You're limping. A goddamn horse stepped on my foot. If you untie me I can help you. I'll take a look at it. I can't do that, ma'am. You need to untie me. Let me go, I didn't do anything. I don't deserve to die. Roscoe, let me go. You are not like the other ones. Let me go. Get up here. I'm sorry, boss. I got a horse get away from me. Never mind the goddamn horse. Get the rest of those bags. Yes, sir. I can't load all the stuff on the horses. What the hell you are doing? We're wasting time. If that Indian made it out there alive, he'll bring the whole goddamn tribe back here. What are we gonna do about her? Let's use her horse to bring down more gold. Roscoe, untie her. You bitch! Load the horses. You've caused enough trouble, bitch. Kill him. I love to. Shit! Sarah! Name of God! I got it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Goddamn, shit... I'll get it! I got it! I got mine! I got mine! With the gold, I'll pay me girls, whiskey... I got gold. I got gold. The yellow rock... Not yours. On that day in 1880 our tribe was once again saved from the greed of the white man. But that day would not last. For their fever for our Yellow Rock would not turn. As my great-grandfather, Angry Wolf said: "They will come as drops in water." "And rain down upon us." And this they do. I'm called Black Feather, the Raven, Omen of death to our people. I am the last of my tribe. For we are no longer... Wakey, wakey. Where am I? Well, see for yourself. No. No. N-o-o-o-o-o! Our father trusted you! Please, lower your voices. You're not the only people here who lost someone they love. He gave you everything he had, and you stole it. We're going to the police. Let's just discuss this in my office. I'm sure we can resolve everything. Please, just -- just follow me. Mother... Is everything okay? Gideon, Emery, dearest. There seems to be some confusion with this contract. Would you please straighten things out? I want to see my father's paperwork. Of course, Mr. Newton. Ohh! What are you doing? ! Walk away. Stop it! Forget about the money. If we see you two here again, You'll wish we let you off this easy. My father died last month -- pancreatic cancer. They found it at stage four, so... I'm sorry. At least we know he's at peace now. Pop wanted to make sure that my brother and I were taken care of after he was gone, so he made his funeral arrangements in advance with Darlene Wickett. He gave her $15,000. The funeral business is very expensive. But after my father died, Darlene told us that she had no record of the money. That she'd never even heard of my father. So it's a breach of contract. There is no contract, Mr. Ford. What do you mean there's no contract? Pop was in the middle of chemo when he met Darlene. She took advantage of his illness. And we can't afford to hire a lawyer. We had to run our credit cards up at another funeral home to bury pop. Okay, listen, I am gonna do everything I can to get your father's money back. Thank you, Mr. Ford, but it's not about the money. This was pop's final gift. He wanted to protect us. Darlene took that away. Parker, what are you doing here? How does she know that, Nate -- That her father's at peace? Faith. Faith, Parker. The rich and powerful take what they want. We steal it back for you. Sometimes, bad guys make the best good guys. We provide... What's up with Parker? It's Parker. You're gonna love this. Are embezzling money from the dying and the grieving. It's the oldest grift in the book. And the cruelest. Even I never ran that one -- it's tacky. Now, the Wicketts have operated all over the country. Our records show funeral licenses from three different states, but for the last five years, they've been here in Massachusetts. Why has no one reported them to the police? Well, they have, but, uh, she has bulletproof aliases for all the states she's worked in. Now, the records that we found show that the Wicketts have stolen $500,000. Where's the money? Well, it's not in any bank. Credit-card records show that she has recently bought a wall safe, which is this right here. Oh. Ooh, Murphy-Beyer, model PRK-11-21. Nice. Okay, she's a horrible human being, But she's got solid taste in home security. These dust mites are just gonna eat me alive. That's the blueprints from town hall... And the last time I go into a basement with this guy. I already got the photos over here. That's the Wickett funeral home. It's a two-story house. You got your embalming room in the basement. You got your viewing chambers and your office on the first floor. And bingo -- private living quarters on the second. They live and work there. Okay. So, funeral homes are busiest on the weekends. It's the easiest time to kind of blend in with the mourners. Um... I'm sorry. What, Nate? Okay, guys, we are gonna go steal a funeral. There she is, the perfect hostess. Right on schedule. Hardison, heading your way. Sophie, I hate it when you make me wear these dang cufflinks. Hardison, everybody owns a good suit, but only the rich own a good pair of cufflinks. Darlene is gonna know that. You must be Mr. Delacroix. I'm Darlene Wickett. Thank you for waiting. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Wickett. My great auntie -- she, uh -- she passed last evening. Mm. And there are some staff -- they spoke very highly of you. Now, I must admit I'm... I'm a bit lost. Oh, Mr. Delacroix. Let us help you say goodbye. You focus on healing during this difficult time, and my sons and I can take care of everything else. Chilly. Parker, anything on the metal detector? Three floors, one wall safe -- Sounds like a challenge to me. Ew! Just stepped in something squishy. How come I had to go to the embalming room, anyway? It's 'cause Hardison's too scared to get in the body bag. Hey, claustrophobia is a very serious condition. I got a note from my doctor. You want to see it? Eliot, where are you? I'm fashionably late to Maybe just not so publicly. Excuse me,ma'am? Rebecca's here to see you. Oh! Great. One second. Thanks. We're done here,kelly. - Hey,rebecca. - Hi,horace. Oh,hey,kelly,what's up? Nothing.How are you guys doing? Good. How's the speechwriting coming? - Good. See you guys later. - Okay. All right. Nice work. You know,she's been press secretary for,like,two weeks now. - hey,you. - Hey,mom. Oh. Nice to see a friendly face. Oh! Um,mom,I had a question, - but,I mean,if you're busy - sorry. Sorry,ma'am. It's the white house operator.It's nora. Would you tell her to hold,please? What is it? Um,well,I was wondering if I could skip this state dinner tonight. Oh,becca. - I was hoping we'd all go-- - madam president nora implied that was a matter of urgency. Of course it is. It's just I have to study for this huge test,um, with a friend. - Um,mom-- - I don't know,becca. You know,why don't you just follow your conscience? Vince,any luck on that john tyler biography? - Did you find it yet? - Uh,no,ma'am. We're still searching. What is it,nora? Wait,wait,wait. Slow down. What did they say exactly? Okay. Just keep this quiet and continue business as usual. Thank you,nora. Seems the russian president has suddenly taken ill. He's still coming to the state dinner though,right? I don't know. What did you promise them,nate? Is there anybody else? - Yeah.Sure,sure,there is. - Yeah? Who's that? Francis. And not francis barnes at agriculture. Mills francis at defense. If teddy were here to see what you're doing, - he would have your head on - if teddy bridges were alive to see this, it would not be necessary. Sit,please. Three resignations. And if you think that's embarrassing, you just wait till you see what happens when she tries to get her nominees for those positions confirmed. - Nate,we're trying to-- - no,no. Come on. Please. You're not going to touch me with your self-righteous indignation. You want her gone just as much as I do. - It ends. - It's just begun. Sit down. Please,jim,sit. I want you to resign. You can take till the end of the month,whatever, - but I want you to resign as well. - Why would I do that? Because when I become president, I want you to join the others in my administration. I'm not sure if I could stomach it--being your chief of staff? I don't want you to be my chief of staff. I want you to be my vice president. Well,that got your attention,didn't it? First african-american vice president. You and me,jim-- we can save this country. We can save it from her. And don't you think about your loyalty to the office. You think about your loyalty to your people. Going to need your answer by the state dinner. You'll have it. oh. Mrs. Kharkova. I didn't realize you were still here. I was just looking for my husband. Mmm. The first gentleman is in the kitchen addressing a crisis. I'm sure he was thrilled with that responsibility. He has been a gracious host. Ah. So you saw the press conference. You know,this summit almost didn't happen. My husband wanted to cancel the visit. He would never admit it, but I think he was intimidated to meet you,madam president. Why would he be intimated by me? Your reputation precedes you. He was afraid you were going to put him on the spot, and you did. President bridges never would have done that. I spoke my mind. That shouldn't be so intimidating. As much as americans claim to be students of history, they forget their own. We are just 15 yrs into the experiment that your country continues after 200 years. It took you 90 years to get rid of slavery and 150 to give women the right to vote. La mujerit's not always easy. You and my husband are both independent thinkers who struggle each day against the people who seek to protect the status quo. Mrs. Kharkova, I sincerely hope that your husband is feeling well enough to attend tonight's state dinner. Is there anything I can get him? Chicken soup,perhaps? There is one thing. And I'm guessing it's not soup. Fast-track our entry into the world trade organization. Technically,I'm not in control of the W.T.O. Well,technically, my husband isn't in control of releasing the dissident journalists. I see. I'm so glad we had a chance to talk. Me,too. I'm never going to get this. At this rate,I'm going to be in summer school. No,it's easy.See,according to mendel, a dominant gene will always express itself... like curly hair. - thanks. - I'm serious. - What's going on here,rebecca? - I'm studying. - Aha. And you are... - oh. Mike flemming,sir. Hi,mike. Can I speak to you for a moment in private? Um,sure. I'm sorry. One second. why aren't you dressed for the state dinner? - I'm not going. - Go get dressed right now, because there is too much going on for you to pull one of your little st-- no,no,no.Mom said it was cool. - Really? - Yeah. Sorry about that. - Is everything cool? - Yeah,it's fine. Well,study hard. Say hi to kelly for me. hey,hey. Look,I don't want you leaving your sister's side this evening. Got it? No. I'm not staying in there with her stupid boyfriend. Just do it,okay? You can stay up as late as you want. Fine. You can play my video games. excuse me. hi,amy. Hi,rebecca. Hey. Why did you tell rebecca she didn't have to come tonight? What do you mean? Well,I told her she had to come to the state dinner. You said she didn't have to. You said that it was "cool." "Cool." Does that sound like something that I would say? Listen,when it comes to our kids, if I say something,that's got to matter. Do you really want to get into this now? Yeah. Yeah,I do. Well,it's not like this is the first time the kids have tried to play us against each other. That's not the point. Our first state dinner is in ten minutes. Could this possibly wait two hours? how do we know kharkov will even show up? Well,I have to think if their relationship is anything like ours, mrs. Kharkova will have a great deal of influence. - Nora. - Madam president,bright news. We've been notified the russian delegation is on their way. Thank you. - madam kharkova. - Madam president. President kharkov, I'm so pleased that you decided to join us this evening. I'm not here for you. I'm here for my wife... and my country. As far as I'm concerned,we're nowhere. speaker of the house nathan templeton and his aide jayne murray. Madam president. - Mr. First gentleman. - Nathan. My wife regrets--apologizes. She still has not recovered. You give her my best. She'll appreciate that.Thank you. You've had quite a day. You get an "a" for comportment. You know my chief of staff jayne murray. - It's an honor. - Jayne. russian nice to meet you. october 4th,1957, was a disappointing day in american history. It's the day we lost the space race. When americans looked skyward, we could see just the faintest glimmer of the soviet union's success. Sputnik was launched that day. On the other side of the world, a young,aeronautical engineer looked to our shared sky with great pride. Anatoly kharkov,president kharkov's father, was just 26 years old at the time. Anatoly kharkov was an innovator. He played a key role in bringing one of the most vital tools of democracy to the world-- communication. Barriers have been broken. Walls have crumbled. But there's still a lot of work to be done. If we hope for a peaceful and prosperous future, then we must put aside our personal agenda... and stand shoulder to shoulder together. Thank you. Na zdorovje. Na zdorovje! na zdorovje! you do look good in a tux,mr. Gardner. He needs your answer now. Man,if I was your age,I'd be crawling out of my skin. Are you kidding? I love this stuff. Guess it's 'cause I'm pretty mature. all danced out,grace? May I? - I miss teddy. - He was a great president. Congratulations.It was a lovely evening. These last two years, I had no idea how much thought and attention was given to every detail. You always made everything look so easy. Rod,seeing your wife up there tonight-- she made it clear she is the president. Suddenly I just feel like I'm a guest in someone else's home. Oh,no.You're always welcome here. One who has overstayed. It's your home now.You belong here. - good night. - Good night. Excuse me,madam president. Here you go-- one oliver chitwood biography of president john tyler. - Piece of cake. - Really? Well,let's say there's a shop owner in georgetown who may be attending our next state dinner. May I ask why? Our tenth president john tyler-- not a lot of people know he was the first V.P. To take over the presidency when harrison died in office. - I didn't know that. - Yeah. His enemies tried to undermine him by forcing harrison's cabinet to resign. But they didn't think it through. Ended up making tyler even more powerful. - Bedside reading? - Yeah. Just not for my bedside. Yes,ma'am. I'm busted. Mr. Speaker. "Mr. Speaker." When it's all said and done,nate,the woman is our president. She deserves the benefit of the doubt. - She deserves a chance-- - stop. You can't give her--you can't give anybody a chance. You don't learn to be the president on the job. The stakes are too high,jim. The president has to be the president from the get-go. You're right. And maybe you'd be better at it than her. But teddy gave you an opportunity,and you said no. You put her in office. The way I see it, you owe it to the country to make sure she's the best damn president she can be. Think about your people,nate. - My people? - The american people. okay. It's a mistake,jim.But okay. Jayne looks lovely iher dress,doesn't she? Yes,she does. Enjoy your evening. Madam president,would you like to dance? I'd be delighted. Thank you. Excuse me,mr. President, but I need to borrow our president on an urgent matter. Yes.Excuse me. Alex? - It's just not done. - What? You. Ma'am,you can't dance with president kharkov. Why? Is he a badancer? - A good dancer? - It's just unprecedented. - Well,what do you think i am? - Is everything okay? We hit a bit of a hiccup. President kharkov wants to dance with our president. It's just,world leaders cannot--should not be dancing together. - What's the protocol? - We're trying to figure that out. Okay,you guys,it cannot be that big of a deal. Are you out of your mind? - It's a-- - ma'am,I think... our staffs must think this is inappropriate. Dmitry,we are the world's leaders. I think we can decide what's appropriate. Thank you for asking me to dance. Acknowledging my father--it meant a lot to me. I didn't see much of him as a boy,but his contribution outlives him. Joey, beautiful women have been coming out of that apartment for an hour. An hour? Well, why didn't you get me? I was stuck in the hot tub. I didn't want them to see my legs. -Well, hello there, gorgeous. -I don't have chicken legs. Michael, this is like a dream. Pinch me. On the arm. Who goes for the ass? I gotta see what's going on in there. -Hi there. -Hi. Can I help you? Yeah. I live across the way... ... andI wouldliketojoin whatever club is meeting here. There's no club. Those are clients. I'm a photographer. I love erotic photography. I didn't say erotic. I definitely heard someone say it. I'm Joey. -I'm Sara. -I'm Michael. -Leave. -Okay. It's amazing to me that you're a photographer. I mean, you are so beautiful. You should be in front of the camera. You really came out swinging. Okay, okay. Let me try a different approach. I saw a flower this morning... ... andI thoughtit was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen untilI gazeduponyou . Right, yeah. I appreciate the effort, but you don't have to work so hard. If you wanna ask me out, just ask me out. -What? Just ask you? -Yeah. Watch this. -Do you wanna go out Saturday? -Yeah. -Great. We have a date. -Hey, wait, wait. I didn't even compliment your eyes. I know. My father must have been a thief... ... becausehestoletwo stars from the sky and put them in my eyes. I did not know that one. That's good. Pick me up at 8. Hey, there. You know, I saw a flower this morning... ... andI thoughtit wasthe most beautiful thing I'd ever seen untilI gazeduponyou . -Really? Thank you. -Okay, so I'm not crazy. Hey, guys. Sexy new underwear there, huh? You can tell? When I was a kid, I wished for a super power, that's what I got. What's the special occasion? My husband's gonna be home tomorrow... ... soGinatookmetoget some sexy undergarments. And it's a good thing I did becauseshewaswearing cotton granny pants. It's gonna be really great to see him. He's been gone for, like, two months. That's a long time to be away. -You guys ever try phone sex? -Yeah, I'm not very good at that. I tend to laugh too much and over-describe the room. Hey, you rented the apartment to that new girl? Nice job. -Thanks for getting me a hot one. -I thought you two might have sparks. I miss Melrose Place. I got a date with her Saturday night. She lives across the courtyard. What if it doesn't work? That could be so awkward. Please. There is no awkward situation I can't smooth over or run from. Okay? But I gotta say, this girl's a tough one. None of my normal lines work on her. I'm gonna have to bring my A-game. And what is your A-game? I take her to this restaurant... ... where the maitre d' knows my name and makes a big fuss over me. Then he seats us at a table where she can't miss my headshot on the wall. "Oh, how embarrassing." Right? At some point, I have one of my famous friends... ... sendoverabottleofwine, maybe Bobby Duvall. -So? -Or Celine Dion. Oh, yeah, I could see that working. -Excited about your date tonight? -Yeah. I set everything up. -Who are they gonna say sent the wine? -Alan Thicke and Lou Diamond Phillips. Yeah. I like the idea that they're friends. -Hey, Joey, how you doing? -Hey, Eric, welcome back. -Thanks, thanks. Hey, honey. -Hey. -So when was the big reunion? -That was it. He just got home. Really? After two months? Why are you talking to me? Get in there and make up for lost time. Joey, it's the middle of the day. We couldn't do that. Could we? I guess we could. -I think I'm going to. -Thattagirl. Don't let that new thong go to waste. Amazing. Through corduroy? You are gonna love this place. The food is great. The only problem is, they tend to make a fuss when actors come in. Oh, I'm not a big fan of actors. -You don't like actors? -No. They're so self-absorbed and need so much attention. But they're America's royalty. Mr. Tribbiani, welcome. That was a very good show last night. Yes, Tony, I also enjoy The Apprentice. Right this way, please. I've saved a very special table for you. Thank you. Thanks. So do you like sports or... ? What is that? Is that you? Is that your headshot? No, that's not what this wall means. I ate the 96-ounce steak. As did Bernadette Peters. Joey, what's going on here? I wanted to impress you, all right? So I brought out my A-game. You know, all my best moves, my best lines. -You don't need to do that with me. -Okay, maybe we should just order. Yeah, okay. I'd order pizza, but I haven't had a decent one... -... sinceI movedfromthe EastCoast. -Me neither. Everybody recommended this place called Mario's. -I went there. -It was awful, right? So bad I had to go someplace else and eat a whole other pizza... ... justtogetthe taste out of my mouth. I'm lucky. My mom sends me pizza from home. -Wait, where are you from? -Philadelphia. I love your sandwiches. Mr. Tribbiani, compliments of Alan Thicke and Lou Diamond Phillips. -Interesting pairing. -Thank you. So can I get you some wine... Nice. Sure. These are great. Did you take all these? Yeah. That one I took in Burma. That little girl was selling gum on the street. Her eyes were so melancholy, yet so full of hope. couldn't get her to smile, huh? What are you gonna do? You have a very interesting face. I can see why you became an actor. -Thank you. -Mind if I photograph it? -Okay. -Have a seat. -Joey, don't pose. -Gotcha. I'm not getting a sense of who you really are. But what if this... ... reallyiswhoIam ? Listen, let's just take a break. We'll have wine, I can do this later. Sounds good. -Hey, I wasn't ready. -No, this is great. But I'm not doing anything. Just relax. Be yourself. Look, if I was with any other girl, running my A-game... ... Iwouldleanin and kiss you right now. But I'm not sure what to do here. Well, this camera thing is my A-game. So why don't I make this easier for you? I may borrow heavily from this in the future. Good morning, everyone. So I take it your date with Sara went well? It was really nice, yeah. She's not like other women I've dated. I mean, we didn't have sex butI stillfeellike a connection was made. Is that shallow? -Hey. -Hey. -How is it having Eric back? -Oh, it's great. It's good. It's a challenge. It's hard. Really? What's wrong? I forgot what it's like to live with somebody. It's a compromise. Yeah. It's taken me and Michael months togeteverything just the way I like it. It's different with Eric here. I was doing a crossword this morning... ... andthecluewas "TV lawyer Ally 'blank' " . And he said "McBeal." I mean, I'm a lawyer and I'm spunky. I think I know who Ally McBeal is, okay? I'm sure being back must be an adjustment for him too. Yeah, especially since now he suffers from this horrible affliction called jet lag. You haven't heard of it becauseapparentlymy husband is the first person ever to have it. I've had jet lag, and it can be pretty bad. He was in Cleveland. Okay, so he's bugging you. Have you tried to talk to him about it yet? No. The way I was raised, we didn't talk about our problems. When my mom was upset with my dad... ... she'd just go to the tennis pro and work on her game. She always came back so happy. It must have been Diego's relaxed island attitude. Yeah, that's probably it. But still, maybe you and Eric should talk. Yeah, you're probably right. Okay, I'll try. Trust me. It'll help. I mean, when I first moved in... ... Ihadabig problem with Michael's snoring. But then we talked about it, and it got better. Talked about it? You put cotton balls in my nose, and duct-taped my mouth shut. And we worked it out. -Hey. -I just wanted to stop by... ... andthankyoufor all the Philly cheesesteaks you sent. Thirty sandwiches are gonna last me a while. I know it sounds like a lot, but the cheesesteak is a very versatile snack. Lunch on the go? Cheesesteak. Tired after racquetball? Cheesesteak. can't find a baby gift? cheesesteak. Well, I really appreciate it. Your neighbor does something nice, you wanna say thank you? -Cheesesteak. -Yeah. You know, Joey, I gotta tell you, you're not exactly who I thought you'd be. Do you wanna go out again tomorrow night? You're just asking me? I mean, I want to... ... but I think I'd like you to work a little harder. Okay. If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put U and I together. Where do you get this stuff? -See you tomorrow night. -Okay. Well, look at that. I just got asked out on a date. -You really like her. -I do. In fact, I like her so much, I'm gonna do something I've never done. I am not gonna date any other women until I see Sara again. You're going out with her tomorrow. That's, like, 24 hours. I know. That's three very disappointed ladies. I mean, if Sara sees me with another girl, she might feel weird. I mean, she's right over there. You see, now, this is why I don't date girls within the building. Okay, buddy. -You working on dinner yet, hon? -It's only three in the afternoon. Geez, what can I tell you? I'm on cleveland time. Oh, God, I got the lag. Bad. -You have to say something. -I don't know. Now, honey, on your crossword, you missed an easy one. "Sesame Street character 'blank' Monster." That's "cookie." Okay, we have to talk. You know what? I'm gonna give you two some privacy. Honey, you know that I love you... ... but I'm not used to having you around... ... andtherearesomethings that have been bothering me. I'm so sorry. I know I haven't been myself, but I'm just so tired with the-- Jet lag. Yes. Funny you should mention that... ... becauseoneof theproblemsisthat you've been talking a lot about that. Well, I didn't realize. I'm sorry. And, please, just let me do the crossword puzzles myself. Okay. If you're gonna use the exercise bike, maybe just throw some shorts on. Are those two squirrels doing it again? Alex is getting everything off her chest with Eric. I really don't appreciate you critiquing me when I sing in the shower. As a musician, it bothers me when you sing off-key. As a musician, it also bothers me that you never shave your legs. Well, as a lawyer, it bothers me that your family sucks. Well, you know, when you- - Will you please tell them to get out of there? Hey, Michael, look at Sara out there reading. Oh, well. Every diamond has its flaws. Check out that stripper-looking girl wandering around. Stripper-looking? She is a stripper. I met her at the-- Oh, God, she's here for me! Remember how I'm not dating anyone because of Sara? I canceled my lunch, my dinner, but not my backup. I forgot about the backup! Damn, I can't even remember her name. Tammy, Terri... ? Wait a second. Why is she over there? She's clearly lost. She's gonna ask Sara where I live. "Something-With-A-T," what are you doing out there? -Okay, I need your help. -What can I do? I need Sara to think Something-With-A-T is here for you. So go out there, get her and walk her back here. This doesn't really play to my strengths, Joey. I don't lie well, I don't deal with women well I don't walk particularly well. It's from the hot tub to the apartment. Fifteen feet. Come on, Michael. You can do this. I believe in you. -There's no other option? -lf there was, would I be asking you? Hi. You remember me, right? I'm Michael, Joey's nephew. -Yeah, hi. -Hi. So that's my date. I'm here for her and she's here for me. There's a connection there. It's exciting, but I'm really not sure where it's going. Excuse me, I'm looking for an apartment. -Do you know where-- -I live? Yes. Right there. -It's me. -Who are you? Who am I? I'm Michael, your lover. -My what? -What's going on? Nothing's going on. It's just... . Man down! Man down! Go to your room and think about what you did. Ladies, before I commit to a path here... ... whatisthesituation as everyone understands it? Well, if I were to guess, I would say that this nice woman... . -Charlene. -Wow, was I off. Charlene, was here for a date with you, and you had Michael come out... ... topretendthatshe was here for him. -That's not what this is. -Then what is it? You're in trouble. See you later, Joey. Sara, wait-- Charlene, look, I'm gonna have to cancel, okay? -I really need to go deal with her. -Okay. Call me, Joey. You're game. Hey, listen, Sara, I am really sorry about that... ... butyoushouldknowImadethatdate before I even met you. I'm not upset you had a date. I don't care that you see other women. But you lied to me and put on that stupid show. Just be honest, Joey. It's the most important thing. So to summarize, I can see other women? Yeah, I get that you're a type of guy who dates a lot. I'm okay with that. -Are you serious? -We went on one date. How inappropriate would it be to be jealous? No. Not yet. Do you know what, Josh? This is really good. It is, isn't it? Yeah. - Brilliant. Is it yours? Yeah. Come on, you two. Bed. Now. Up we go. God. Women, eh? Yeah. Anteater walks into a pub, right? Walks up to the bar, orders a pint of bitter. The barman pulls him a pint, puts it down in front of him. He says, "All right, sir?" He says, "Yeah. " He comes back later, and he says, "Is everything all right, sir?" The anteater said, "Yeah, it's fine." And he goes away. He comes back a couple of minutes later. And he says, "Are you sure everything's all right, sir?" And the anteater says, "Yes, it's fine. I wish you'd just leave me alone." And the barman says, "Oh, well, why the long face, then?" Excuse me. Man walks into a pub. The same pub? - The same pub. Hi. Jenny! What brings you here? I thought I was invited for dinner. Of course. Yes, of course. Come in. Right. Sorry. Yes, come in. Right. Jenny, let me introduce you to everyone. Er...this is Felix. Felix Bishop. The pleasure's mine. And this is Heather... ..who's Karen's mother. And this is Robert... ..who works with Felix. Jenny is... Jenny's a friend of ours. Available at no notice. David... Right. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll just erm... Felix was just telling a joke. Jokes? Great. You invited Jenny? ! Oh, is she here already? The last time we invited her, she emptied a fire extinguisher over my boss. David, we haven't got fire extinguishers. This is supposed to be a dinner party, not a business function. Well, we'll be talking business. Briefly. I know another one... - What do you chaps do, then? Let me guess. Second-hand cars? - Internet. Oh, bugger. Sorry. It's just...at least I know what a car is. I'm the same. I can't even turn a computer on. Is that your job, then, Robert? - Er, no. It's my company. Right. So, do you work for him or... Felix is what's known as an incubator. - Yeah. I bet he is. What he does, right, is...he looks for people with a good idea, like me, then exploits us. Exploits the idea. I raise the money to make it happen. - Oh, is that it? Do you know how much he's worth? I dunno. Internet... Got to be...20 million pounds! That was last week. Try 30. I hate having to pander to these people. I've had to work hard to achieve...all this. Robert just switches on his laptop and bingo! He's a multimillionaire. There is no justice. What's your point exactly? They're looking to appoint another firm of consultants and we're in with a shout. We were, but with the charm offensive in the hands of your mother and Jenny, I might as well log off now. - David, I'm sure they'll behave. Oh, I'm absolutely starving. Thanks for inviting us... Karen. It's lovely to see you. - Hey, that Robert's a bit of all right. David, there are people dying of thirst in here. And he's filthy rich. What the hell? I might just have a crack at him. Thank you. Now... David. Here's a thing. Did you know that "mother-in-law" is an anagram...of "woman Hitler"? And "middle-aged man" is... "reactionary old fart". No, it's not. No, there's no F in "middle-aged man". There's no effing wine left either, David. Get some more will you, darling? I...er... I was just wondering if I'd left any aftershave behind. Allright. So, at ten at night with your child asleep in bed, you thought you'd pop over and check? Interesting. Is that so unbelievable? Given your record for personal hygiene? Actually, I... I just need someone to talk to. Pete. Hmm. That was lovely. Can I ask you a personal question? What's it like to be a millionaire? It's the first question I'm asked by women. What's the second? - Am I gay? Are you? - That's for you to find out. What is it like, then? I'm only a millionaire on paper. I didn't think you'd carry that much cash on you. And no, I'm not gay. And the answer to your next question is... no, I'm not seeing anyone at the moment. I wasn't going to ask you that. - You'd have asked David. God, you're very confident. I guess that is what being a millionaire's like. Only on paper. What's wrong with you? Why haven't you got a girlfriend? I ain't got much time for women. I mean... I haven't got much time, you know, what with the business. Married to your work. - But one day I'm hoping to get a divorce. The thing with most management consultants, Felix, is when they know they've got your business, they don't try as hard. They put in a junior team. Faces change from meeting to meeting. Now, at DZQ, we believe that building relations is vitally important. Speaking of relations, David, what's your mother-in-law's situation? I think Felix likes me. Yeah. I wonder whether Dad would like him. I've left your father, Karen. Sorry, I hope you didn't mind me bringing little Adam along. No. No. Josh is usually up around this time. - Yeah. He wets his bed. Playing with little Adam might take his mind off it. So? So... I think...me and Jenny might be getting back together again. Karen mentioned something about your husband. Been asking questions? No... No. His name's Pete. And, at the moment, he's at home with our little boy. Right. I see. You probably don't. We're separated. Not very effectively. We live under the same roof, but... Separate beds? That's a very personal question. And I'm very sorry. Separate bedrooms, actually. Would you like some more coffee, you two? I think we'd better. Do you think I'm mad? Maybe I'm misreading the signals, but since I moved back in, we've been getting on well. Is that how Jenny sees it, that you've moved back in? She calls me the lodger. But that's just a running gag. Well, where is she tonight? Dinner at David and Karen's. We weren't invited. - Oh, no. It's a last-minute thing. They needed a single woman to make up numbers. But is Jenny a single woman? Er...maybe not for much longer. We said we'd sort out our living arrangements at the beginning of next month. I'm quietly confident that I won't be sending out any change of address cards. So where did you park the Porsche, then? - Over there. Blimey! I was only joking. Right. Jenny...can I see you again? Ha! It's my designated driver. Ready to hit the road? I should go. See you. Jenny... Was it something you said? Whoops! Mum... Not now, Karen. Thanks for listening, fellas. It's nice to hear someone else's take on things. Don't jump to conclusions too quickly, Pete. Oh, come on, Rach. Adam's right. I think we know Jen a bit better than you. What's this? - It looks like dog hair. We haven't got a dog. Josh! Oh, my God! Well, I must say, that went better than expected. Robert and Jenny hit it off. And Felix seemed very taken with your mother. She's left my dad. What? ! - Apparently. She hasn't said why yet. Darling, that's terrible. So, she'd be free to see Felix again. David! My mother has left my father. - That's my point. So how do you think that makes me feel? What about my dad? Yeah. I'm sorry, darling. That was very thoughtless of me. Poor Jack. David, you don't even like him. No, But I wouldn't wish a failed marriage on him. Not even if it's good for business? - No. No, of course not. We can't take him home looking like this. Maybe if we brushed his hair across... What? Like Jackie Charlton? Bobby, actually. All right. We could cut a bit off the other side. What would be the point of that? At least it would look symmetrical! People might think it's a fashion. God! You know, it's got to look better than this. Oh, my...! Funnily enough, it doesn't. Give them here. It's not bad. Just the one error. Oh, sorry. I did... I did check it. Looks all right to me. No. See? You got this bit wrong. Oh, no, actually. You did. - I'm sorry? Well, "to kindly wait" is a split infinitive. It should be "'I would ask you kindly to wait." That suggests I'm asking him kindly, whereas in fact the opposite's true. It suggests you would ask him to kindly wait. - Precisely. Pardon? - To kindly wait. Change it, please. Right. It's just it's grammatically incorrect. Change it! Geraldine Hughes. Is your name Jenny? Yeah. Er...hello? You never answered my question. - What? About seeing you again. Who's this? Robert... Brown. We met at Karen and David's last night. Erm...hang on a sec. Sorry, it's personal. How did you find me? I rang your temp agency. Very reluctant to give out your number. I used all my charm. What? And that was enough? I had to pretend I wanted to employ you. Well, thank you very much, but I have a job. Erm...excuse me for butting in. But that's where you're wrong. Hang on a sec. I'll just be a minute. Good. All the sooner you can change this letter, get your coat and go! Hello. Are you free for lunch? Erm... As it happens, I think I might be. I had no idea you and Dad were unhappy. We haven't been getting on for some time. The drinking's been a problem. Well, I had noticed. No, not me! Him. Dad's drinking? Why don't I know about any of this? - I'm telling you now. You've your own life. Do you want us on the phone every few days, complaining about each other? We've had a good run. 35 years. And maybe half of them were happy. Don't talk like it's over. Do you mind if I stay with you and David just for a while? Just till I've thought things through? Mum, you're welcome to stay as long as you like. Just promise me you'll try and sort things out with Dad. Oh, look at those shoes! Do you think they're the sort of thing Felix might like? Mum and Dad'll be excited to see you. They're gonna love us! Joshy! Hello, Ramona. Are David and Karen in? - Yeah. That's...a pity. Heather, you're looking good. Something special? Dinner with Felix Bishop. Really? Excellent! I mean...erm... Ahhh! Look who's here. Hello, darling. - Hello, Joshy. Big lad. - What a lovely new hat. Yeah. There's a reason for that, Karen. So, how did they react? Pretty well, really. All things considered. Apart from Ramona. Latin blood. Mad. Olive oil? - Oh, yeah. Extra virgin olive oil. Yeah. That's the one. Jenny was cool as well. I thought she'd go mad when the ink wouldn't come out. Yeah, I bet you did. Does that papaya feel ripe to you? No. No... Yeah. She just smiled and said, "There's more important things in life." You could take that as an encouraging sign. Oh, I do. I do. Now, smoked salmon. Norwegian wild or Scottish farmed? What are we doing here? Tomorrow is a very significant day. May 7th? Quince jelly... Joshy, your little sisters have a surprise for you. Do you want to see what it is now? Go on! Wow! Wow! It's a present from the girls. Great! That was Karen. Apparently, Josh thinks his sisters are wonderful. You mean David's bought him off? - Yeah, it sounds like it. They're storing up trouble. Spoiling him now. Mm. Rod for their own backs. I think we handled the wee lad quite well. We did, didn't we? Firm but fair. That's the secret, you know. Establish your boundaries and stick to them. Except when you gave him all that chocolate. - That was different. I don't know how. But it was. It was hell having him here though, wasn't it? It was a nightmare. Just imagine that 24 hours a day. Drive you mad. It is quiet without him, isn't it? Hmm. I think I miss him. Do you? Well, no...you know, I mean... I miss him too. What? What? - You were going to say something. Oh...yeah. Oh, no, forget it. Well, it's just that... No...no...no. It's a crazy idea. Us? - Yeah. Do you want to? Do you? - It's a hell of a decision to take. Unless you don't take it. You know...just leave things to chance. And you wouldn't mind? No. I'm glad you said that, because... you know our special friend that comes to stay now and again? Pete? - No, my period. It's late. How late? A week or so. Oh, my God! Yeah. Well... May 7th. Oops! Da-da! Happy anniversary, Jen. Ha-ha! Oh, God! Look. I kinda thought that we wouldn't be celebrating this any more. Well, why not? We're still together. After a fashion. Well, yeah. But... Oh, come on, love. Sit down. Your salmon and scrambled egg's getting cold. We've got loads to discuss. Look, Pete, I'd... Hang on a sec. Look, Pete, this is too much. It really is. I didn't send those. Hello? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've just got 'em. Yeah, listen, I can't really talk, to be honest. Yeah. Oh, they're lovely. Let me give you a ring. I'll give you a ring in about half an hour. Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": This dark spell I hold in my worthless hand is our gift to you, Glorificus. Please, call me Glory. - What if she's something else altogether? - Something new, you mean? Something old. So old it predates the written word. Lady, whatever you are, please... I have two daughters. The Key is energy. - My brethren sent it to you. - Dawn. - She has no idea? - No. She thinks she's my kid sister. I have to take care of her. Your mother has low-grade glioma. It's a brain tumour. Listen, you two, I know this creamed spinach is delicious, but I won't be offended if you go out for some real food. You kidding me? This is the good life. Relaxing in bed while people bring you food on trays. - I like the Jell-O. - Help yourself. Food that moves by itself gives me the heebie-jeebies. It's good and wiggly. A girl at school told me gelatin is made from ground-up cow's feet, and if you eat Jell-O some cow out there is limping with no feet. But I told her I'm sure they kill 'em before they take off their feet. Right? You're the one who insisted on teaching her to talk. Oh, hello, Dr Kriegel. You know my girls, Buffy and Dawn. Yes. You two are becoming part of the regular crew around here. - Just keeping her company. - Good. - Just be careful you don't wear her out. - Oh, don't worry about that. I woke up exhausted. There's really no more exhausted to get. Well, maybe some good news'll help. The blood work's back from the lab. Everything's fine. So we've scheduled your surgery for the day after tomorrow at ten in the morning. How's that sound to you? I thinkthey had me scheduled for volleyball, but I can work around it. All right then. Joyce, you take care. Make sure and get some good solid rest. And I mean that. The day after tomorrow. I can't stand to stay here another two days just waiting. Waiting? Give me a break, we got tons to do. We have soap operas to watch and trashy magazines to read. And an adjustable bed to fiddle with. That alone will keep me busy for four hours. I really don't need you to stay here. I know you've got patrolling to do. Not tonight. Tonight I have "Mom taking care of' to do. Riley's filling in with the others. I'm sure they have it all under control. - Human chest! Human chest! - Sorry! My God. What a rough night. I dusted two of'em! Yay on me! That was pretty cool. Except the part where I was all terrified and now my knees are all dizzy. Not so much a big success night for me. But I should get points just for showing up. Unlike some Riley Finn who shall remain unnamed. That was disappointing. Things would have been easier if he'd come. Piffle! Who needs him when I'm dusting two at a ti... Whoops. Maybe it would've been good if he had showed up. Perhaps he forgot. Care package! Special delivery for the Summers girls. Let's see what I have in this sack of mine. I feel just like Santa Claus, except thinner and younger and female and, well, Jewish. This is an extra-special gift for your mom that I know she'll need. A beer hat! See? It's got cup holders and a strawthat goes directly into your mouth. You can fill it with other stuff than beer. And somehow, when I was in the store, this seemed the most important idea, and nowthere's the whole part where I'm crazy. It's perfect. Thank you, Willow. You're very sweet. Let's see who's next. Dawn, I believe I have something in here for you. - Headache? - Just a little one. Biggish little one. I'm fine! Go on, what else is in that sack of goodies, Willow? All right. Dawn, to keep you busy. Ooh, spells! Thank you, Willow! You got her a book on spells. The girl who can breakthings by just looking at them now has a bookto teach her to breakthings by looking at 'em? It doesn't actually have spells in it. Just history and anecdotes, stuff like that. Oh, Buffy, I have this for you. Homework? I don't believe in tiny Jewish Santa any more. - And a yo-yo. - Thank you. The book is just in case you get a chance to look it over. We're doing World War I now. The last exam was really pretty easy, just underlying causes and trench foot. - Should be no hassle to make it up. - I don't know if I'll take that exam. I'd rip it in half and stick it in bed with me! Mom? - I think I'm gonna take a little rest now. - OK. We'll be right outside if you need us. What was she talking about? I mean, that was weird. - She's gonna be fine. - It's OK. I'm sorry. The doctor spoke to me, and I should have told you. The thing that's pressing on her brain, sometimes it might make her say weird things. - Does she know she's saying them? - Not really. It's sort of like a flash. Butyou saw her two seconds afterward - she was normal. And after the operation, no more pressing. She'll be all normal all the time. - Is that right? - Hey, Santa doesn't lie. - Oh, excuse me. - Careful, the facts say a picnic is in order. What is that thing? There's no data. There's no pictures on this one there! What is the data? There's no one in there. - Buffy? - Come on, honey. Don't worry about it. I'm going home? Home? Home, home, home... What's wrong with him? Is it like Mom? A thing in his head? I don't think so. I think it's different. Don't worry about it. I guess I missed that. Was he bothering you? Hey, Ben. This is my friend Willow. - Hi. - Hi. And, yeah, the crazy man was a little, you know, crazy, but it's OK. - Are they gonna send him home? - Don't get me started. The mental ward's booked beyond capacity, nowhere to put them, so the ones with families are being sent home. Like his family is able to take care of him! He has to have someone watch him 24-7. What was he saying to you? Oh, he was just babbling. - You know what's weird? - Japanese commercials are weird. Yes. And also, you know, some of the stars we're looking at don't even exist any more. In the time that it takes for their light to reach us, they've died. Exploded. Poof. Were things rough at the hospital? You know, I used to love to look up at them when I was little. They're supposed to make you feel all insignificant, but they made me feel like... like I was in space. Part of the stars. There's Canis Minor. And Cassiopeia. And the Big Pineapple. You know, I'm not sure I remember that one. Oh, it's a major one. See those three bright stars right over there? Yeah. And see those stars along there? That's the bottom of the pineapple. - It's big. - Hence the name. The real ones never made sense to me. I sort of have my own. Teach me. See those stars over there? Short Man Looking Uncomfortable. Moose Getting a Sponge Bath. Little Pile o' Crackers. That was a bit of a stretch. You do it. What would you call... that one? I see... a huge flaming meteor about to crash into something. I know what I said. I said I won't go away far. A person needs to respect a man get some fresh air and find some fresh spaces. And some fresh space! And needs to walkto get where he's going. This thing doesn't work! It isn't working! I'm sure they heard you. I bet it's not even hooked up to anything. Just like the push buttons at the crosswalk. I'm sure someone's... What, the push buttons aren't hooked up to anything? Oh, tell him, Buffy. Tell him, OK? - Look, Dr Kriegel, we wanna go home. - Well, of course. - You can visityour mother in the morning. - No. We. I mean all of us. My mom, too. Well, I understand that, but it's not necessarily the first thing I'd recommend. I can't. I can't stay here waiting for two days for this operation. I just can't. - It makes my head hurt to be here. - Joyce, there's no reason to get upset. No reason to get upset? Right, sorry. I must just thinkthere is cos of my brain tumour! Here, Dawn, why don'tyou get something from the machine? - I'm sorry I said that. I'm just tired. - I know. Listen, Doctor, I don't see why we can't take her home, you know, just until... Wouldn't it be better for her to rest someplace where she felt safe and comfortable? Even if it would mean some work for you, taking care of her? - Oh, thank God. - I'll do it. Anything. There are medications to administer. I'd have to show you how. And I'd need for you to check her vitals, watch her pretty closely. - I'm afraid you won't get a lot of sleep. - I'm not much of a sleep person anyway. - Can we go now? Let's go now! - Hold on! Let me get all the medications and the instructions on howto do everything. She's right. Let's do this right. We don't wanna forget anything. Everyone stay close. - I'm glad you called me in on this. - Glad you answered. Oh, yeah. Sorry about last time. - Heard I missed out on some fun. - Oh, yeah, fun was had. Also frolic, merriment and near-death high jinks. Look. There it is. Wow. We have a meteorite. Is it hot? Cos if there's radiation, you could go all sterile. No, it's not hot. It's warm. And broken. - It's sort of... - Hollow. Yeah. So, we're all thinking the same thing, right? Festive piñata? Delicious candy? Something evil crashed to earth in this and then broke out and slithered away to do badness. In all fairness, I don't think we know about the "slithered" part. Oh, no. I'm sure it frisked about like a fluffy lamb. Let's look around. Maybe we can figure out where it went. It went here! No pulse. Yep, the space lamb got him. - I don't see any marks on him. - I know him. He was at the hospital. A mental patient. They released him today. - Riley, what are you doing? - I'm not sure, there's something... That might be toxic. Don't touch it. Yeah, touching it was my first impulse. Luckily I've moved on to my second, which involves heaving and running like hell. Oh, man, does that smell. - So what do we do now? - We can't call Buffy. - I wanna call Buffy. - You can't. She's got life stuff. That has to come first. So we'll just figure this out ourselves. We're experienced. Yes, cos it seems like we're always dealing with creatures from space. Except that we don't ever do that. This is definitely newterritory. Perhaps we should explore a bit more, head into the woods a bit. - Who votes research? - Better idea. Good call. Could've been other cases like this. I'm gonna stay here, examine the body some more, look around a little bit. Yeah, don't do anything hunterly. No, no, I'm just not great at research, which I'm sure you guys figured out. - I like me a good crime scene. - Give us a call if you need help. Believe me, if something jumps out at me in the dark, you'll hear me without the phone. - Call me if you learn anything. - You got it. I don't wanna be the one that finds the bodies any more. I need to speakto the man at the desk. This is A... This is Riley Finn. You have an Agent Miller, Graham Miller. He'll tell you who... Yes. Emergency frequency. Cold. Cold. Wait! You can't go! Don'tyou be that kind of barn owl! Please! Please don't go! Please! Please don't go. Please. Please. Please don't... I can't see you! I can't see you! I can't see you! Well, I guess we're all set, then. You've got my home phone number, my pager number. And here. These are the medications I talked to you about - the sedative and so forth, painkillers. Right. No problem. If this is gonna be too much, we can make your mom comfortable here. No. No, no, I got this. We really, really appreciate... You look just like your father when he cries. And what do you think he was begging for? - I told you she's been... - I know. Joyce? Joyce. We're all done here. - Why don'tyou take your girls home now? - Yes. Yes, thank you. - Thank you for all your help, Doctor. - I'll see you in a couple of days. Let's get the hell outta here. Here we go. Oh, it's nice to be home. - Do you wanna go into bed, Mom? - Oh, Buffy, no. That light, it's too bright. - It's too bright. It's too bright. - OK. OK. - Buffy, it hurts. It hurts my eyes. - It's off, it's off. Shut off the lights in the living room. I will take you upstairs and we'll shut off the lights. Come on. - You Finn? - Yeah. Major Ellis. I'm in charge. What's the situation? Just the one civilian casualty? That I know of. This way. You found a stiff in the woods and called us in? Don'tyou usually call your girlfriend for this kind of thing? I wouldn't touch that stuff in his mouth if I were you. - Toxic? - No, just messy. Guy seemed to have simply choked on the stuff. Near as I can tell, it's some kind of protein alkaloid. Does this fit the profile of any sub-T you know? It's not subterrestrial, Major. Extraterrestrial. It came out of that. - Set the trackers for a protein signature. - Yes, sir. No good, Major. This alkaloid's breaking down at an accelerated rate. - It's dissolving too fast to track. - You got a better idea? Thing came from space. Gotta be some trace radiation. We have Geiger counters in the packs. Shouldn't be too much background gamma noise here. Break 'em out. Mom? Oh, my God! Mom, what are you doing? I'm making breakfast. You shouldn't eat any more. You're disgustingly fat. - Oh, Buffy, I don't know what I'm doing. - You just need some rest. We'll putyou backto bed. OK, there you go. That will help you sleep. Come on. Let's getyou all tucked into bed. Don't touch me! You... you thing! Mom, please! Get away from me! - You're nothing, you're a shadow! - Mom... - I don't know whatyou are or how you came. - Mom, it's Dawn. Dawn? Honey, what's wrong? She's just tired. We all are. Come on, go to sleep. I'll check in on you in a little bit. She hates me. No. She called me a thing. She loves you. OK? She's not herself. I told you what the doctor said about the tumour. No. Not just Mom. People. They keep saying weird stuff about me. Are you talking about the man in the hospital? He called me a thing, too. And there was another one. A weird guy outside the magic shop. He said I didn't belong. He said I wasn't real. Why does everybody keep doing that? - What's wrong with me? - Nothing. It's notyou. There's something that happens in people's brains when there's something wrong. It's like a short circuit. And it makes them feel like nothing's real except for them. That's all it is. Look, it is notyou. OK? And if anyone says anything like that to you again, don't listen. Even if it's Mom. - I hate it. - I know. Just don't listen. Look at howteeny Mercury is compared to, like, Saturn. Whereas, in contrast, the cars of the same name... Xander, please, we have workto do here. I still don't get why we had to come here to get info about a killer snot monster. Because it's a killer snot monster from outer space. I did not say that. Demons enter our world in all sorts of different ways. This one came from above. And the library's astronomy section is the home of aboveness. Got it. Hey, digging this study material, too. We've scoured the periodicals for other meteorite landings in the last week. - Big zippo. - Well, then the world is not being invaded. - I'm pretty pleased about that. - Guys? I've got some stuff. The most recent meteoric anomaly was the Tunguska blast in Russia in 1917. Some witnesses claimed the meteor was hollow. Maybe with a chewy demon centre like ours. - Howfar back does this list of anomalies go? - Pretty far. - To the Queller impact in the 12th century. - The what? Queller. I don't know why they call it that. It didn't hit a place called Queller. It landed just outside of Reykjavik in Iceland. Wait, I just saw... Queller. Quell... Here, here. "Primitive people used to believe the moon caused insanity." "They would pray to the moon to send a meteor to fix the problem the moon caused." "These meteors were expected to 'quell' the madmen." The man in the woods - he was a mental patient. And he got pretty well... quelled. OK, I'm looking in history right now. It says in the Middle Ages there were these sweeping plagues of madness. People were losing their marbles everywhere, but then it would suddenly subside. And these dates look pretty close. Like maybe it happened after each one of the meteor events. As if something emerged from the meteors and quelled the madmen. Meteor go boom, crazy guy goes bye-bye. Xander's little book made it sound like this Queller thing had to be summoned. So who summoned it? Who else? My money's on Glory, our resident beastie summoner. We should call Buffy. Except we can't call Buffy. - Can we? - No, but we better call Riley. - A Queller demon? - Yeah, that's our perp. - A scavenger that can be summoned to kill... - Crazy people. Yeah. How'd you know? - Cos I have five corpses at the mental ward. - You're at the hospital? Listen, Riley, I saw Buffy's mom earlier and she was acting kinda wacky. Insane wacky, if you know what I mean? It's OK. Joyce was released earlier today. That intern, Ben, told me. - They're safe at home. - Oh, good. And the thing, the Queller, is it still there? We've... I think I've got it cornered in the air ducts. Willow, keep at whatyou're doing. Call me if you find out how I can kill it. OK, but shouldn't we come help? OK. I wish someone had told me that there would be tennis being played! I just didn't know. Those eyes... Those eyes, they're like gasoline puddles! Tell me. Tell me because I need to know why. Why are you staring at me like that? What are you asking me? You are asking me, aren'tyou? Is this a test? And if this counts for the final grade, I need to know now! OK, teachers put this on the syllabus, but they do not stare down atyou, they do not cling, they do not look down on you. Does someone know you're here? They should have said. You are not supposed to be here. I need to rest now. I don't like the way you're staring at me! Did they tell you that at the gate? Stop staring at me. I don't like it! - Trail stops here, edge of the parking lot. - It stops? A car. It hitched a ride, probably underneath. So much for containment. So some poor mental patient checks out of here today, drives away with this thing, took it right to its own home. - Checked out today. - Get me a list of patients discharged... No. I know where it's going. We've gotta move, now! I'm going to close my eyes, and when I open them you are going to go away. Get off me! Buffy! Buffy! - What? What is it? - Something's out there. It's after Mom! Stay in here. Don't leave this room. It's OK, my baby. It's OK. - Spike? - Yeah. Listen, did you hear a noise? What the hell are you doing in my house? Right then. Caught me. Your basement's full of junk. And me being in need of junk... - You were stealing? - Yeah. Can't exactly work at Burger Barn... Wait. Are those pictures of me? Buffy! Cover the room! We're in. Fan out! Take the back! Clear! Are you OK? You just missed a real to. Eric Schwartz, 25. Auto versus ped with severe head injury. Awake but altered. BP: 180/90. Heart rate: 130. Three fingers. Three fingers. How you doing, Eric? Was he riding without a helmet? Came off when he flipped his bike. He took a direct impact. He hasn't stopped answering how many fingers am I holding up since I asked him on the scene. Okay, on my count-- one, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. He's perseverating. Eric... One, two, three. One, two, three. Your brain is rebooting itself over and over again. We'll sort that out as soon as we can. Someone page Neurosurge, have mannitol standing by. Eric, is there anybody we can contact, a family member? No Mom. Not Mom. Br-brother Joey. Not Mom. Joey. Got it, Eric. Do you have his cell phone, Kleebus? With his stuff. I'll find a Joey. Agniska Vivika, mid-20's, restrained passenger in an MVA with a crush injury to the abdomen and pelvis, right leg fracture and a deep arm laceration. Given five of morphine. Agniska? Doesn't speak English. (speaking foreign language) Russian? DELEO: I don't know, a lot of consonants-- maybe Czech? Passport says she's Polish. DELEO: Arm bleed stopped with pressure, but it's definitely gonna have to be explored by Vascular in the O.R. Also, a lot of bruising on the abdomen. Agniska, we're gonna get you a translator as soon as we can, okay? (speaking Polish) She has diffuse guarding. (crying in pain) Yeah, pelvis is really unstable. It's definitely gonna need surgery. Let's get another five of morphine. And a call to Admin. For a trans... for a translator. ZAMBRANO: You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Oh! Oh! And the flu strikes again, huh? I'm so sorry. Don't worry, just... just go home, okay? Tuck will get someone to cover. And I'll start the ultrasound while you go and clean up. No, I'll... No, no, I got it. Just, uh, go. Go. (chuckles) (scoffs) This day couldn't get worse. (sighs) Oh, sir. You can't be in here. Your foot. Please... I don't want to use this. That makes two of us. Where was I? There was a gun in Trauma? Don't you people have security? So this is how the foot injury became a trauma case? Are you taking notes? Oh, absolutely. I'm gonna figure out who died. Pretty sure it's the homeless guy. Always the guy you least expect. Yes, gun. Yes, in Trauma. Yes, security, but not enough. And even if we had run the homeless guy through a metal detector, it wouldn't have found the weapon. Why not? Sorry. I don't mean to scare you. Well, it'd help if you put the gun down. I can't do that. Okay. Could I at least take a look at your foot? Stay back. I'm just trying to help. That's what they said at the other building. You mean the ER? They said that they were going to fix my foot, then I saw the cameras-- they were watching me! Are there cameras in here, too? ER wants us to keep an eye out for a foot laceration who skipped out. Think I found him. Yup. Think so. Stay back. Hey, hey, why don't you take it easy. What do you say we put the gun down before someone ends up needing to go to a trauma hospital. See, that's why I didn't want to come back here. What do you mean, back here? You been here before? Hey, I know you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You were there when they did this to me. It's a water gun. (Zambrano cries out) Are you okay? You all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Go, go. Whoa-whoa-whoa, sorry, sorry. Hey, someone stop that guy! Hey! Someone call security! I went through Eric's cell. I couldn't find a number for the brother, Joey, but I found one for his mother, Leslie. Thanks, Kleebus. Mrs. Schwartz? I'm Dr. Warren. You're a doctor? Yes, a first year resident. Eric's in critical condition. He was injured on his bike. Oh, God! But his vitals are stable and his head CT scan shows no bleeding. Now, he does have significant brain swelling, so we're prepping him for surgery to relieve that pressure. Our chief, Dr. Proctor, is in surgery with Eric. I'm going to scrub in, and as soon as we have any update, I'll let you know. Does she know anything about Eric? Uh, D-Dr. Warren was just giving me an update. You're a doctor? Dr. Warren, this is my son, um... Joey, right? Joey? How do you know about Joey? Eric gave Joey It's okay, Mom. as a contact. Why would Eric be asking for Joey? Relax, Mom. I'm Eric's younger brother, Scott. I've been staying in town with my mother since... Joey died in an accident six months ago. I'm really sorry. LESLIE: Please, Dr. Warren. I can't lose another son. I understand, Mrs. Schwartz. (monitor whooshing) How's Agniska doing? Agniska's got fluid pooling behind her liver. Her bladder looked irregular. Ruptured? What happened to your face? Just... water gun incident. Don't ask. Bladder rupture, liver laceration. DELEO: Pelvic and tibia fracture, brachial artery injury. Let's get a retrograde urethrogram to confirm the bladder rupture and have ortho, urology and vascular scrub in for the other issues. (speaks Polish) Can we get a damn translator in here? (speaking Polish) Whoa, sir. (speaking Polish) Are you the translator? No, Bolek Dabrowski-- he's the husband of the driver of the car. I was told that my wife was taken here, but I can't find her anywhere. We only got two cases from the crash. What about the ER? If you can help us translate with Agniska, we'll find out where your wife's been taken. Of course, of course. (alarm beeping) Pressure's dropping. Let's move it, people. Lynn. I need an O.R. for Agniska Vivika and ortho, urology and vascular. Already paged. Oh, Tuck asked me to make some calls about your mother's earring. I talked to the diner where you had breakfast and the gas station. So far nothing. (sighs) Thanks for trying, Lynn. His name is Jackson Russel. Who? Our missing Mr. Water Gun. Trach scar got me thinking, so I went to Admin. Mm-hmm. Bravo Team did the intake nine months ago-- gunshot to the back-- but I discharged him. Guy hummed constantly. He hummed? If it's the same guy, yeah. Same tune over and over. Can't remember what it was, but I was able to pull his medical records. Bullet went to the heart. We put in a mechanical valve. And he's on a blood thinner-- warfarin-- which the ER confirmed with an INR before he went AWOL. Wait. Levels are way too high. Warfarin toxicity. Well, if he's a psych patient, he may be double-dosing on his medication. With that level of blood thinner, his foot won't clot. I mean, he can bleed out within a matter of hours. Put out an internal APB. Guy's got to be here somewhere. And if he is, I'm gonna find him. PROCTOR: Mr. Schwartz. we're going to do a ventriculostomy, put a tube into your brain to drain some of the fluid and reduce the pressure. Not Mom- - Joey. It's okay, Eric. Just try to... (dull banging) Wait a minute. I'm not doing that. Focal seizures. Follow my finger. He's got a fixed gaze. Get him intubated and prepped. Tell the anesthesiologist to start lorazepam for the seizures. Let's take a look at his latest CTs. Brain swelling's too severe to do a ventriculostomy. Let's page Neurosurge, prep his belly. His belly? Uh-huh. We're going to do a hemi? Yeah. We're going to do a hemi. DAVIS: Hang on, I'm confused. What's a hemi? A hemicraniectomy. The top of the skull is removed, and the opening is secured by sewing the dura and the scalp together. And this allows room for the brain to swell without damage. But why open the belly if the swelling is in the brain? I can show you. Excuse me. Okay, so let's imagine, the chicken is your head, right? And the baked potato is your belly. First, we slice off the top of the chicken like so, and we set it aside. So what happens when we leave chicken out for too long? It rots, right? We could freeze it, but then frozen chicken never tastes quite the same, does it? So, we slice open the belly, (clears throat) make a little room. And we put the skull inside. This allows room for the brain to expand, decreasing the pressure, and the skull can stay viable inside the body cavity-- a bit like a warmer-- until we're ready to reattach it. So now we got two critical patients and two O.R.s running. Anyone here play dominoes? In, uh, O.R. 1, we brought in Dr. Rasual from Neurosurge to, uh, take off the top of the skull of our cyclist, while Dr. Warren and I created the abdominal pouch to store the bone. Meanwhile, in the other O.R., Drs. Zambrano and Deleo repaired the liver lacerations on the passenger from the car. Dr. Sullos from Orthopedics set her fractured tibia, and Dr. Goodman from Vascular did the reconstruction on her damaged brachial artery. On deck, surgeons from Urology were set do a bladder reconstruction. Ten doctors, all working to try and save two lives. Which brings us back to our missing homeless guy. You think he's in there? We have any other homeless foot lacerations on the loose today? Wait. Shouldn't you wait for security? He was armed. With a water weapon. I think he's only a threat to the Wicked Witch of the West. Jackson? Some more blood on the floor. He couldn't have gone anywhere. The footprints only lead in. David Blaine has nothing on this guy. PROCTOR: Abdominal dressing is in place. WARREN: And vital signs all look good. Let's get Eric into the ICU for close monitoring. (alarm beeping) It's wide complex tachycardia. I'll grab paddles to shock. No, no, no. Hold on. It's not a shockable rhythm. Look at the twisting pattern of the QRS complexes. It's not V tach. It's torsades. Try overdrive pacing to take control of his heart. Push two migs of magnesium, get him back into rhythm. WARREN: Overdrive pacing now. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Watch his rhythm. He's back in sinus. His brain swelling shouldn't trigger torsades. Did we miss a heart trauma? No, he had a chest CT and an echo-- both totally normal. So you think the heart dysrhythmia is unrelated to the trauma? I don't know. Let's find out. I'll get him moved, you get a full medical history, including exactly how his brother Joey died. All right? Just got a hold of Dispatch. They finally tracked down Agniska's cousin, Gosia Dabrowski. Mm-hmm. She was taken to Lashbrook Community Hospital. Lashbrook? Mmm. They're only a level 3 trauma center. I know. Paramedics misrouted her to the nearest hospital. What happened now? (sighs) Vascular stuck me with a scalpel. It was clean. God, you are having a day. Gosia Dabrowski? At Lashbrook? Yeah. I'm going to tell the husband, and I've paged the attending there to see if I can find out more about the case. I've got no time, Carl. No time. You've got to have time, Matt. Technically, I'm your boss. Technically, I've got a patient whose heart just stopped beating for no reason. Got to go. Fine. I'll keep talking while you do. So, about the fund-raising presentation. (sighs) It'll only take an hour, and all you have to do is be charming. Which I won't be, Carl. 'Cause I yammer, pick fights, use food as inappropriate props. Give me a scalpel and some sutures, fine, but stumping up for a new wing... This is not about a new wing. (buzzer sounds) Trauma has two sources of funding. I know how Trauma is funded. One is government, the other is private. The feds are pulling back, the state has a $3 billion budget shortfall, the city can't even pick up the trash. And that brings us back to private citizens. What about the head of Bravo Team? Ronson has the flu. Verduga from Charlie Team has done it four years running. Nobody wants to hear from me. Which leaves us with the mysterious new guy who everyone is dying to meet. I did this three times in Maryland, and three times I couldn't raise a dime. Matt, we're considering cutting back surgeons, laying off staff. Okay. I'll get you some talking points. (elevator whirring) Talking points are fine. But if you're expecting me to save people's jobs tell them to update their resumes. But Eric's a triathlete. He's never had anything worse than a cold. What about with his heart? His heart? Mom, it's okay. But-but I thought he has a brain injury. He does, but during surgery, his heart showed an abnormal rhythm. We need to know of any pre-existing conditions or injuries. Eric's as healthy as a horse, same as Scott. What about Joey? I'm sorry to have to bring it up, but it would be really helpful to know how your son died, in case it might have any bearing on Eric. Joey drowned. It was off the coast near Sommerville, South Carolina. I still say he was hit by a boat. He was too strong a swimmer. Ma. He had a couple of beers; tide was going out. That's it. Are you bleeding? Oh, no, he-he's not. But you are. Look out! I need a lift team and a gurney! LESLIE: Scott! What's wrong with him? Scott! Why is he shaking like this? Make that two lift teams and two gurneys! STEPHENS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The passenger in the car, the homeless guy, the bicyclist and now the brother of the bicyclist? You said three patients before. Did I? Well, now there are four. ZAMBRANO: How the hell did he get in the ceiling? Ductwork in the back of the supply closet. Guy must have crawled 400 feet through three-by-three tubing. Pressure's 60/30. Severely anemic from blood loss. Blood bank says it'll take an hour to thaw fresh frozen plasma to reverse the anticoagulation. Can't wait for the FFP. Bag of factor IX complex and I.V. vitamin K and keep transfusing. Where... where am I? Hey, there, Jackson. (exhales, gasps) I-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't scare you too much. No apology necessary. Just let us take care of your foot, okay? Can you breathe deeply for me, Scott? I'm fine. You were passed out and twitching. Because some guy almost fell on me. "Guy almost fell on me" is not a known cause for twitching and fainting. EKG looks fine. BP's normal. Everything normal. I told you I'm fine. Infected. He's been running around in dirty gauze all day. (gasps) Hey, hey, ckson, you were right. We do know each other. We do? I was the discharge nurse when you got shot. You hummed your way right out of the door. I don't think I've ever hummed in my whole life. Maybe I'm confused. Maybe I'm confused. (chuckles) I'm on so many meds. Sometimes I'm not sure what's real. You ever have that problem? Wound can't be closed here. Infected area needs to be debrided. I'll call up and have an O.R. prepped. Hey, Jackson, we're gonna fix your foot up. You're gonna be just fine. It's not my foot... my mind. Please, fix my mind. Update on the two brothers: Eric's abdomen incision site looks good. His vitals are stable, but his brain is still swelling to critical levels. Nothing we can do now but wait and hope. Scott's also stable. No signs of seizures in either. Eric, Scott, Joey. Where did you get the dominoes? In a bag in the break room. Eric has seizures and heart dysrhythmia. Scott, maybe seizures and no dysrhythmia. and Joey... accident. Unless it wasn't. (chuckles) Mediocre minds think alike. Speak for yourself. So he's swimming, he has some sort of episode, and he drowns. No one does an autopsy. Let's assume Joey had seizures. Scott has seizures. Scott said he'd never had seizures before. Underlying condition that's been lying dormant, brought to the surface by the stress. We know Eric has seizures. Eric's seizures were caused by increing pressure in his brain. What if the seizures were triggered by the pressure but the condition existed all along? So, epilepsy. Worth a test, right? GRACEFFA: I talked to a Dr. Ebel over at Lashbrook. Gosia Dabrowski is in critical condition with a severe liver injury and a pelvic fracture. It's the same as our patient. But they don't have an in-house trauma team, and the surgeons won't be there for 50 minutes. 50? We're 20 by ambulance. Tell 'em to pack her. We'll have an O.R. prepped and free. Bolek. I'm going to see Gosia. No, you don't have to go anywhere. We're having her transferred here. Here? Yeah. We've determined we can take better care of her here than where she was. And Agniska? She's in ICU recovering. Gosia and I, we have a new baby, Danusia, two months old. And today was the first day Gosia was even away from her. How does a thing like this happen? Excuse me. I'm l turned around. I got a call. I'm looking for Jackson Russel. You next of kin? Yeah, I'm his wife. Jackson used to own a landscaping business. Everything he touched bloomed. Nine months ago, he was making a deposit at an ATM when he, uh... He got shot. We know. After his surgery, he got pretty depressed. There was just a lot of stuff he couldn't do. He had to stop working. He lost the business. We went to see doctors, lots of doctors. And now he has these episodes where he just disappears. I haven't seen him in three weeks. Do you know what medications he's on? What is he not on? They're divided by days of the week. I don't even know what they are. There's red round one, the blue oval one and the diamond-shaped pink one that he takes twice a day. Did... Did he ask for me? I'm not sure. Did he say anything at all? He asked us to heal his mind. Yeah, I've kinda given up hope for that. ZAMBRANO: Oh, and I'm supposed to get a page as soon as Jackson Russel's in the ICU with antibiotics running. And I think we should get new labs on Agniska... Oh! Look out! Oh, God. I'm sorry, Dr. Zambrano. Sorry. It's okay. (chuckles) You need to just go home before you get hit by lightning. (sighs) Eva... you really are having a bad day. Let me see. Is your toe broken? This about your mother's earring? Getting all puked on? (laughs) A nail. I was talking to Kleebus. He said all these people's lives were upended by one nail. Can it really all be that random? Do you want the truth? No, Chris, lie to me. Probably, yeah. Well, it makes it very hard to sleep at night. See, I solved that problem years ago. How? I don't sleep. (both chuckle) SCOTT: This isn't so bad. I thought it was gonna hurt. PROCTOR: We could get your mom to watch if you think it'd help. No. No, I'm trying not to completely freak her out. Ever since Joey drowned, she's got to have me in her sight, like, 24 hours a day. She calls Eric, like, every 15 minutes. She just hasn't been able to accept what happened. I'm fine. Just go back to working on Eri... (rapid beeping) Scott? ! He's out again. I see it. Scott! Mr. Schwartz? So epilepsy. You were right. No... I was dead wrong. Totally, completely 100% wrong. (rapid beeping) There's no twitching. The EEG shows no seizure activity. That's because it isn't a seizure. Scrap the EEG. Run the EKG. We already did. It was normal. Flecainide, please. Let's see how it reads after I push this. Eric's seizures were related to his trauma. And Scott's seizures, they weren't seizures at all, but the three brothers' problems were linked. Linked by what? Sudden unexpected death syndrome. Sudden unexpected death syndrome-- or Brugada-- is a genetic disease. It wasn't even recognized until 1992. There are no symptoms, no prior warnings until it presents as a heart arrhythmia brought on by severe physical or emotional stress: a head trauma... long swim. Someone crashing through a ceiling next to them. Now, Brugada effects less than one percent of the population, but it's the exact demographic into which the three brothers fall. So what can you do about this? Implant an internal defibrillator which will give a shock if it senses an abnormal heart rhythm. LESLIE: Could you say that again in English? We're sending Scott to be fitted with a special pacemaker that will regulate his heart and ensure that this won't happen again. And as soon as Eric has recovered from his head trauma, he'll be fitted for one, too. So both my boys have this Brugada thing? Actually, we think all of your sons may have had it, Mrs. Schwartz. And that's why Joey drowned? We think he may have had an attack while swimming. At least that's our theory. Mrs. Schwartz, um, we can't guarantee that your two sons won't be hit by a bus but we can guarantee they won't die of this. (laughs) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, too. That's okay. TUCK: I'm no psychiatrist, but there's no way he should be taking three antipsychotics and two antidepressants along with his warfarin. The worse he got emotionally, the more doctors he saw, the more pills he got. I'm gonna schedule a Psych consult with Dr. Minyard. He'll be better at sorting this thing out. He talk about cameras? About people following him? But didn't mention me? I mostly justried to keep. And I think I may have mistook him for someone. Who? Patient we once had, guy hummed a lot. Hummed? Mr. Russel just woke up. Page Dr. Zambrano. I'll be right back. How are you feeling? A little shaky. We're working on that. Your numbers look good, Mr. Russel, and Dr. Zambrano is on her way to see you. In the meantime, is there anything I can do? Can you turn that thing off? I don't like people watching me. Anything else? No. I have a... I have a wife. I don't like her to see me when I get this way. If you could call her and let her know where... Ah, Katie. Oh, Jackson. I'm kind of a mess here. Nurse Brody and I have been talking about that. He thinks he might be able to hook us up with a doctor, one doctor, who might help clear things up. Really? We're gonna see what we can do. Mr. Brody? The humming? Was it this... (hums "My Funny Valentine") (humming continues) Yes. âa My funny valentine âa Our wedding dance. You used to hum that every morning while you loaded your truck. Yeah. I did... I used to hum. âa You make me smile âa I miss that guy. âa With my heart âa âa Each day is Valentine's Day. âa DAVIS: Wait. I don't get it. The brothers get pacemakers. The Polish woman is in ICU. And the homeless guy's foot is healing. So, who died? Anybody? The one who didn't get there in time. (siren wailing) (siren continues wailing) Gosia Dabrowski, 27 years old, transferred from Kendall Community. Multiple abdominal injuries, BP is 40 palp with a weak pulse. She'll never make it upstairs. Pressure's too low. Let's go into Trauma 2. Abdomen's filled with blood. Should've been in an O.R. an hour ago. She's bradying down. DELEO: Asystole. (flatline beeping) Damn it. Starting CPR. DELEO: Get a crash cart. Give her one of epi and atropine. Open up a thoracotomy tray. We have to cross-clamp the aorta. I'm on it. Give me a rib spreader. I was paged to the O.R. Yeah, didn't make it that far. Patient arrested. Heart's not beating. Give me a clamp. Got it. (flatline beeping) Heart's still not beating. PROCTOR: Starting internal compressions. Keep the blood flowing. Gosia, come on. PROCTOR: We worked for an hour and a half... (flatlining continues) ...but we couldn't get her stable enough to get her to the O.R. Now, I know you resent the, uh, same stuffy room, the uncomfortable chairs. Being asked, yet again, to open... your checkbooks. Do you know what I resent? I resent having to tell the father of a two-month-old baby that his wife is dead, because the trauma facility to which she was sent didn't have the resources to save her. You know the, uh, process of treating a trauma patient is, um... is a bit like these dominoes. Three patients, three trauma suites, two O.R.s, 17 specialists, all less than five minutes away. Now, if everything goes according to plan then each element will fall into the next and, uh, three patients are saved. But if not... or if we don't exist and that patient is just sent to the closest hospital... Gosia Dabrowski. Born 23rd of March, 1979, Warsaw, Poland. Died 4:58 p.m. yesterday, Miami... Florida. Thanks for your time. (meowing) Don't start. I'm down to lost and found clothing. Hmm. Well, speaking of cats... and dogs. Oh, no. Ugh, my car! I forgot I had the top off. It's soaked! I can give you a ride home. Yeah, I swear, everything I have has either been spilled on rained on or puked on. You can look inside your Goodwill bag for something. Sorry, I didn't get around to it. That's totally fine. Somewhere between my fashion mistakes from the '90s and my ex-boyfriend's junk, I'm sure I'll find something to wear. (clattering) Eva? Oh, it's hideous, but at least it'll get me to your car, right? Eva. (gasps) It fell out of the bag. My mother's earring. If I hadn't had my rotten morning, I would've made it to Goodwill. If I hadn't been puked on, never would've run out of clothing. If it hadn't been raining, never would've reached in that bag. If I hadn't reached in that bag... Eva finds meaning in the chaos. I don't know about that but... at least I'll sleep tonight. âa Can you see me now? âa âa Hanging on by a thread âa Sorry, Carl, I went off script. Well, the dominoes were a nice touch. So, um, how'd I do? You are no longer the guy who's never raised a dime. But... how many dimes? Better than Ronson? Better than Verduga? Look, Matt, what's important is that you were willing to step up at the last minute. Dr. Willis? This is for you. Oh, thank you. Thank you. And you dropped this. Keep it as a souvenir. See you next year? Yeah. Sure. Same uncomfortable chairs. Same dry chicken. âa Can you hear me now? âa Dr. Willis? Yes. A moment please. Thanks. âa Hanging on by a thread âa âa Are you coming to my rescue? âa (helicopter blades whirring) âa Will you be the one to save me? âa âa Are you? âa âa Are you going to save me? âa Hey, Jack. - Did you dye your hair? - No. No. So how was your New Year's? Wonderful. My dear friend, the deep-sea explorer Bob Ballard, Brought over a 2,000-year-old amphora of wine From a sunken Phoenician trading vessel. The wine turned out to be quite toxic. My guests and I spent the stroke of midnight in my garden... vomiting. - Oh, my god, sorry. - Don't be. The whole night... the purging, the new year, The vivid hallucinations of Astarte... The Phoenician goddess of sex and war... It all wiped the slate clean. So... Nancy Donovan... What happened before Christmas was a mistake. She hasn't contacted me since, so clearly she agrees it's over. Well, that's healthy. A clean break. Exactly. A clean break. So what about you, Lemon? Is your 2010 off to a good start? Well, I spent New Year's eve with my family, Which was actually very special. My cousin Randy, This kid from this rural coal mining town, Came out to us. And I think old Liz Lemon had a little something To do with that. Randy's gay, everybody! He's gay. I think everyone knew. Finally! Over the break, I forgot what floor I worked on. Six, Tracy. Six! I knew it was a character from Blossom, But I couldn't find the Joey Russo button. Hold the door! You guys, I had the most amazing New Year's. I met James Franco's manager. It was like a fairy tale. My client, James Franco, he's actively looking For a relationship with a human woman To dispel certain unsavory rumors. Are you available for a fake romance with a movie star? Does chewing on a sponge trick your brain's hunger center? Yes! Yes! A million times yes! So this is some arranged Hollywood relationship? With James Franco. Can you believe they went to me Before Ayilla from The Real World: Cancun? I think it's great. The exposure will do wonders for you and TGS. Lemon, I want you and Jenna to have a meeting With James Franco and make sure his manager doesn't screw her. Too late! Wait, which way did you mean that? I had a pretty amazing New Year's too. My wife and I are trying for a daughter, And on New Year's eve I think I got Angie pregnant. No, no, no, no. Okay, but I was gonna describe it real good. How was your New Year's, sir? Perfect. Oh, my god! As you know, on New Year's, I finally met my birth parents. So... thank you for asking about that! - I called her, Lemon. - What? I called Nancy on New Year's eve at 3:42 a.m. Damn that Phoenician wine! And you don't remember doing it? The last thing I remember is going into a closet And switching clothes with Bob Ballard. Look, I don't think you actually spoke to her. You hit pound after the number. I think you left a message. Cerie, get on her YouFace page. - Lemon, do you mind? - No. One second. Okay. Okay, her YouFace page says they're on vacation. They're borrowing a friend's condo in Florida. Oh, what have I done? The woman is on vacation with her husband as we speak, Probably having beach sex, which is the third best sex After elevator and White House. Is there any chance that she hasn't heard it yet? As a frequent leaver of drunken messages, I can tell you no good can come of this. As a frequent receiver of drunk messages, They are not cute, even when they're from Liz. Da da da... Good lord, I've Lemoned the situation with Nancy! I've got to erase that message. "Lemoned"? That's not a thing People are saying now, is it? Cerie? Lemoned. Doing it awesome. Here's the general idea, Jenna. You and I pretend that we met while filming a movie Called Space Attack. My title. This movie will never be released Because my performance will be deemed "too provocative for America." Oh, I wish I lived in France. But out of this experience, We found each other, et cetera, et cetera. Five dates a week, one fight a month. And because of a product placement deal with Jamba Juice, The fight will be in a Jamba Juice. I love Jamba Juice! And this is the non-disclosure agreement Regarding anything you two may learn about each other During the course of the relationship. Yeah, what exactly is Mr. Franco covering up here? i - Liz, are you familiar with Japanese moe relationships, Where socially dysfunctional men develop Deep emotional attachments to body pillows With women painted on them? I am not, James. Neither am I, Liz! Which is why it's so weird The tabloids are running all these stories Saying I'm in love with a body pillow. I mean, it's crazy! Then why is that here? Why? I mean, why is this table here? I mean, why is that lamp here? Kimiko is-- It is here like any other object. Objects are made by men and used for many purposes. But we never love objects. Where do I sign? Hello? Liz? It's Randy, Randy Lemon. Oh, hey, Randy. What's up? Well, my parents and I are kind of fighting right now. Because you spilled orange soda on the couch? No, because of the gay thing. - So now I'm here in New York. - Wait, you're in New York? Yeah, I figured I'd come stay with my cool cousin Liz. Besides, what better place for me to be Now that I'm a homo? Is that the one we call ourselves? Nope. Get a cab, okay? Go to my apartment. 168 Riverside Drive. Okay. Uh, actually there's a guy here Who offered to drive me if I helped him move a couch Into a van. Nope. That's a serial killer. Just get a cab. I'll pay for it. You have Amish here? Just get in the house, Randy. Kenneth, Jonathan, I need one of you to help me With a very special assignment. I hope it's me. But I'm honored just to be standing here with you. I'm going to drive up to Waltham, Massachusetts, Break into a woman's home, And erase a potentially embarrassing and destructive Answering machine message. The home in questions has a doggy door. That will be our way in... Using these hangers. Prove that you are lithe enough to accompany me to Waltham. It's Kenneth! You sicken me. I did it! Angie just called. She's pregnant. - That's awesome. - Congratulations. Yes. And it gets better. I just had a burrito! Well, now you just have to hope that it's a girl. I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon, Because I yelled "Susan B. Anthony" - At the moment of conception. - Well, that'll do it. We're gonna name her after the place That she was conceived. It was a pretty wild night. So we gonna name her either Virginia, Netjet, or bathroom at Teterboro airport. Oh, Liz, I'm in love. You're really not. James and I just had lunch at The Spotted Pig. The paparazzi were everywhere. The gossip blogs are calling us "James." It's a combination of Jenna and James. Jenna, look, I'm glad that you're having fun, But is this really all that you want? I mean, you and I are not getting any younger. You don't know that thing I sleep in isn't working. Don't you want more than some fake boyfriend? Don't you want to be happy? Liz, I am happy. All this attention, getting my picture taken, Having ice-cold diarrhea from drinking too much Jamba Juice... It's everything I ever wanted. Sorry, sir. That happens sometimes when I unhinge my pelvis. Oh, I was afraid of this. It's not an answering machine, it's a voice mail. Okay, well, we just need to look for clues To her password. It'll be like the Da Vinci Code. Ehh... albino monk! That's a mirror, Kenneth. She must have written it down somewhere. Try on the computer. Okay. Search... Oops! I just took my picture with that little camera thing. - Kenneth! - All right. I just need to erase that picture. Whoops, I just made it the desktop image. How did I do that? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Ah! Nancy's husband has been sleeping on the couch. "emailing image to address book"? What is wrong with me? - Hey, Liz. - Oh, thank god. Randall Lemon, where were you? I'm sorry, I met these two guys And they just dropped me off. Well, I'm glad they brought you home, but... That's where I'm meeting them later... A bar called "Home Butt." - No, you're not. You came to New York to see your cool cousin, Not run around with strange gentlemen. You don't have to be so protective of me. This is New York City, Randy. Liz, you know how hard it was growing up gay In Methenburg, Pennsylvania? The local TV station edited Will Grace down so much that it was just called Karen. Being in New York, this is the first time I've ever felt like myself. And I want to go out and enjoy it, have fun. Oh, we're gonna have fun. We're gonna stay here and make nachos And see who can fall asleep the earliest. Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! This is nice. Your hand feels like a pillow that's been in the microwave. Thanks. Okay, well... I'll see you tomorrow. Wait. Oh, it's okay. You can stop. - I was wrong. - What? I thought it was a paparazzo, But it's just some loser taking a picture of his kid. Oh... Right. Of course. That was fake. Did you know "paparazzo" is singular to "paparazzi"? Kimiko taught me that. I'll see you at dawn so you can get caught coming out of my apartment. I'll loan you a shirt. Try to look like you just got drilled. You know the deal. Sir, this computer is not helping with our search. If you type "Nancy's secrets" into the internet, Do you have any idea what comes up? A store that sells wig extensions. I've seen all this before, Kenneth. The separate beds, the empty closets, The brave public face. This is just another Irish Catholic couple Who won't admit to the world that their marriage is over. Sir, you don't know that. They're on vacation together right now. Are they? Nancy Donovan, still so organized. In German class, Mr. Kruger always chose her To sort the students. He was eventually arrested by Israeli commandos. Hmm. Look. On the 30th she took flight 1470 to RSW. He left the next day for CVG. They have to be different cities. Uh, Fort Myers and Cincinnati. Did you not learn your nation's airport codes in high school? She's at the beach house alone! That's the most divorced sentence I've ever heard. Mr. Donaghy, this snooping has to stop. We came here to erase... oh! I just took a picture of both of us. Good morning. Is that glitter? Oh, my god, did you go out last night After I won the sleeping contest? I forgot to wash my face, didn't I? I meant to do it at the club, But when I got into the bathroom, Everything started up again. Okay, that's it, I am taking you To the Port Authority. To get on a bus home, not to meet people! God! Look, you've had your fun. You've seen New York. You've made some really neat friends. Maybe that's enough for a first step. Okay? Yeah. Okay, you're right. But I'm not going home Until I give my cool cousin a makeover! i - Is it gonna be fierce? It would be if it was 2006. Well, I do have this one cardigan That I've been kind of afraid to wear. Well, let's see it, girl. I'm not going back to Methenburg! Randy Lemon, you open this door right now! Okay, I do appreciate the irony That I'm the one stuck in the closet now. - Is that irony? - Not really. The sun is up and we are still in these people's home. God can see us now. We have to find that voice mail code. It's on the dry-erase board above the phone. What? I saw it there a few hours ago. But I wasn't done looking around. I'm ready to hear the message now. Sir, I don't mean to swear, But I am irritated right now. 5-5-2-8-7. Thursday, December 30... Thursday. Friday, January 1st. 3:42 a.m. Meine liebe, Gretta, It's Klaus. Remember Mr. Kruger's German class? I took it to be with you. Sat behind you so I could talk to you And try to see the top of your underwear. You were Gretta and I was Klaus-- Jack, are you coming in? I'm on the phone! Get back in the hot tub. Ballard, don't let them put their tops back on. I'm going to say good night With help from the poet Rilke. Because only German can capture What seeing you again has made me feel. Aus unendlichen sehnsuchten Steigen endliche taten wie schwache fontanen. Auf wiedersehen, Gretta. To erase, press seven. To save, press nine. For more options, press four. Sir, what are you doing? Erase it. I don't know. I thought I wanted a clean break, But if that message is how I really feel, Maybe she was supposed to hear it. Her marriage is falling apart. We meet again after all these years. Message deleted. Next message. Mr. Donaghy, whatever's happening here, It is not your place to interfere. If Mrs. Dougherty wanted you in her life, She would have called, given you some sign. But she hasn't. Let it go, sir. You're right, Kenneth. But you are leaving through the doggy door. Yes, sir. Hey, Liz, we're playing the Today Show drinking game. You do a shot every time they give a dumb travel tip. I like to take the shampoo And put it in the little travel-size bottles. Then I take the original bottle And put it back in the shower... For later. All: Yeah. Great. Liz, relationship emergency. Why are you wearing a man's shirt and no pants? Last night, James kissed me. And for a second, I forgot it was fake. And it was incredible. Now having lunch with James and the actress who plays my mom Somehow seems hollow. What's wrong with me? Jenna, what you're feeling is good. This thing with James is fun and exciting, But it isn't real. Deep down I think you want to be With someone you really love, And who can love you back. More friends on the plaza this morning. - Hi, guys. You celebrating? - We're in love! Trent's quitting the navy, and we're going to get married In Massachusetts. Wow. Congratulations. Oh, boy. If you want to save money on the trip, Consider taking a sandwich. Give 'em a hand. All: Yeah. Hey, baby, you new here? - Yeah, this is my first show. - Uh-huh. And before you worked here, were you an ass scientist? Because your ass... Blah, blah, blah. You get the point. - So what's your name? - Virginia. Virginia? But that's gonna be my daughter's name. - Are you also someone's daughter? - Uh, yeah. Is every woman someone's daughter? - Of course. - Uh-oh! No... way. I was wrong, sir. There is a sign. She's been thinking about you for years! Why can't you be more like Kenneth? Go on. Her code... 5-5-2-8-7. Do you know what it means? Well, it's not a date. The first numbers are too high. It's not the numbers, sir. It's the letters. They spell "Klaus." Your name in German class. The class you were in with Nancy... In high school. - Back in Massachu... - I get it, Kenneth! I'm just trying to figure out my next move. I have to play it cool. You should buy a leather jacket! Get Cerie in here. Not you. Pack your stuff. You know, I don't think this is about you protecting me. I think you have a problem with people enjoying themselves. Why did you even leave White Haven, Liz? When was the last time you watched the sun rise? Sometimes at work... - Or kissed a boy you just met? - Gross. Or went dancing? I'm not going home Until I make you appreciate living here. Tonight we are gonna do that makeover for real. And then I'm taking you out. Yeah, okay. Fine. I mean, who am I to tell Jenna That she doesn't know how to be happy - When I can't even figure out, - Stop. So bored. Did I do that right? Yeah. That was super bitchy. You can't just break up with me. I'll sue you for breach of contract! Oh, you're being such a non-pillow right now! But don't you understand? I just want something real in my life for once. I want what you have with Kimiko. Oh, Kimiko-tan... What am I doing, Jenna? Pretending to be something I'm not. Making myself miserable when I've got happiness Waiting for me at home. Unless Kimiko's jealous of the ottoman. There's nothing going on there. That's a business relationship. Don't Lemon your life, James. Be happy. I'm the actor James Franco, damn it! And I'm in love with and common-law married to a Japanese body pillow! And I hope you had a good New Year's. Let me know the next time you and Mark are in New York, And we'll all grab dinner. Auf wiedersehen. Liz. - James. - Wow. You look great. Is Jenna here? No, Jenna and I broke up, actually. We both decided it was time to be happy. Me too. I'm saying yes to life! Okay. Let's do this. Hey, you got home late. Yeah, I, um... Randy, this is James Franco And our friend Kimiko-Tan. Hey, Randy. I'm gonna go to the bus station. I think that's for the best. I blame you three for my unhealthy attitude towards women! You have created an atmosphere of hostility and intolerance that everyone talks about all the time. Griz, when is the last time you told your fiance you loved her since the phone call I interrupted to make this announcement? Kenneth, your haircut is disrespectful to lesbians! Dotcom, do you ever read books by women? But George Eliot was a woman. Enough! I've made a decision. And starting next week, I'm adding a woman To the entourage. Really? My name is Nao Kanzaki. "Nicknamed "Naive Nao" due to my innate trust in people"." Excuse me. Can you spare some bus fare? I seem to have misplaced my wallet. Why sure! "Write your address so I can pay you back." It's a con. "How obvious! She's really gullible." So who would've thought... "I'd get involved in a ghastly liar's game?" "lt all began when I found a million dollars at my door." "l had been roped into playing of ruthless swindle game." "Winners got filthy rich, while losers drowned in debt. " "l survived with the help of a master con man, Shinichi Akiyama." "When I reached the semi-finals, I was allowed out." "But the finals offered a chance to destroy this sadistic game." "So I put everything in Akiyama's capable hands." Little did I know... that my battle... was just beginning. Hi. Tanimura-san! One of our finalists has dropped out. "You've earned the right to fill that slot." I'd only be in Akiyama-san's way. Don't give me that! "Without you... he will lose for sure." How do you know that? "Because this time, the game can be won... through trust." "You and I both know he isn't capable of that." What can I do? Save him. Only you can. He trusts you and you alone. "lf what he said was true about Akiyama..." then I had to go. "Beyond this door... awaits the final stage." "Garden Of Eden." Your brander. "Each player gets one, and an alphabet lD." You are player H. You may enter. "Mai" "lgarashi" "Momose" "Kuji" "Sendou" "Yukina" Nao! Fukunaga! "Fukunaga" "Thank God. I feel less anxious knowing someone." Guess who else? Eto-san? "Eto" At your service! "You're Nao? You met my brother in the 4th Round." I did? "Nishida" Akiyama-san. Who're you mailing? No one. "We got lucky with Yokoya dropping out." It let us bring Nao back. "Let us now begin the final stage of the Liar Game." "l am Kelbim. I will be your host." "By now, you have all become seasoned veterans of this game." "But today, we don't expect to collect any debts." Why not? Because in today's game... "The game you will all be partaking in is called..." "Garden of Eden." "And so it begins, the last round of lies and backstabbing." "As you know, the name comes from the Bible's Book of Genesis." "ln the center of Eden stood the Tree of Knowledge." "God forbade the eating of its fruit." "Yet Adam and Eve fell prey to temptation." And ate the forbidden fruit. For that... God banished them from paradise. "Likewise, if all of you can resist that same temptation..." you will reap a fortune in reward. We will now conduct a rehearsal. "This is the voting room, which you will enter one at a time..." and cast your votes with apples. "You are to choose from gold, silver or red apples." Are these...? "Indeed, made of real gold and silver." Extravagant final. And this? "The red apples will be explained shortly." "But this game can be played with just gold and silver." What do I do with this? "Return it to the tray... or burn it." I'll switch to gold. "Then you must brand your chosen apple with your name." "Nao Kanzaki" "Finally, you are to deposit the apple in the voting box." You will repeat this 1 3 times. "The votes will be automatically tabulated." Here are the results. "Those who cast silver apples win the round." Majority wins. "lf a player casts two apples with the same name..." only the first vote will count. "Moreover, you are forbidden by contract to force another's vote." You have 1 hour for each round. "But once all votes are in, that round is finished." "Any player who fails to cast a vote in time..." is penalized a million dollars. "Once you've voted, you cannot return until the next round." "Each player in the majority after each vote..." will earn a million dollars. "Players in the minority after each vote..." will lose a million dollars. "lf however everybody casts the same vote..." everyone loses a million dollars. "l thought you said we could all win." "These rules create clear winners and losers." Precisely. "The gold and silver are forbidden fruit, and must not be cast." What? "lnstead, you are to cast the Red Apple of Truth." Red Apple of Truth? "The red apples play the most important role in this game." "lf all 1 1 of you cast a red apple, you each win a million dollars." Serious? "lf we continue to vote red, we each win 1 3 million." However... "if anyone casts a forbidden fruit after red votes have been cast..." "those casting a red apple with lose a million dollars." "And both gold and silver voters will earn a million dollars." "Moreover, a single vote using a forbidden fruit..." earns a special bonus of 2 million. "What you must be most careful to avoid..." "is being the only one to cast a red apple." "That player's name will be revealed..." "and incur a penalty of 1 0 million dollars." 1 0 million? And finally... "anyone exceeding 5 million in debts must leave paradise..." and be banished from Eden. Banished? "lf, however, another player elects to cover that debt..." then play continues. "Ha! Who here would cover for another's 5 million?" This is the final stage. "Each player starts with their accumulated earnings so far." "The money leader so far at 1 2 million..." is Player A. Who's that? "Those with a positive balance at the end will retain that as prize money." "A negative balance will translate into actual debt." "The money leader at the end will be crowned champion." And will take home... 50 million dollars. 50 million! "Should the game be halted due to rule infringements..." this money is rescinded. "And the game will end with every player penalized 10 million." "To prevent multiple players from conspiring to split the 50 million..." "earnings among players cannot change hands after the game." Now my friends... "go cast the Red Apple of Truth as often as you can." "Why are we standing still? Let's vote red." I know why! Listen up, everyone! "Till now, the goal's been to take money from each other." But not this time. Our dealings are with the "house". "That's who we're playing against, not each other." So let's all cast red apples. "We can beat the house and all its traps if we pull together." I'm in. I'll cast red. Really? "Me, too. Let's end by sticking it to "them"." Thank you! "We all stand to gain over 143 million." Can't catch Player A, anyway. And it would be a sure thing. " - I'm with Nao! - Me, too!" "I've fought all this way with Nao." I know she can be trusted. Let's follow Nao's lead! Thanks, everyone. Let's do it! "Victory for Nao! Victory for all!" It was the perfect start. "All 1 1 of us uniting around a common goal." You're the last one, Akiyama-san. What? Let me borrow this. Lip gloss. You toying with me? This is so strange. "I've never felt so at peace playing this game." "I've convinced myself of something since arriving here." "That we've fought all this way in order to come together." "To show that, ultimately, we must believe in each other." I agree. You do? All votes have been cast. Here are the results. "1 st Vote Results" Gold... 3. Silver... 4. Red... 4. "Players casting gold and silver apples win." Interesting. The second vote begins now. Suckers, suckers! You know what, Nao? You really, really are... naive! Fukunaga. Me, vote red? Why not? "You'd earn the same million either way." Not true! "There's no risk of losing a million this way." "And I knew others would shoot for 50 mil." "The only way to win is to betray before you're betrayed!" "Say what? You're rotten to the core." Stop it! Have faith and vote red! No way, Nao. Nobody will vote red now. Right, guys? " - You're scum. - Unbelievable." Traitor. "Don't give me that! 6 others did it, too!" Don't play innocent! I voted red. " - Me, too. - Me, too." "Liars! See if I trust any of you!" The feeling's mutual. What? I pity you. Screw you, you crooked hag! Who you calling a hag? You didn't vote red, either! Who says? Please stop! This is exactly where "they" want us. What's done is done. "l say we give unity another chance, and vote red." Igarashi-san... I was thinking the same thing! Well, all right! "They're right! We can do this!" Count me out. Don't be a spoil sport! "Think about it. Those who voted red are already down a mil." You telling them to do that again? There were 7 traitors. Yeah, but... "Anyone asking for a red vote is either one of the traitors..." I'm stupidly naive! I guarantee... we will never get all reds. That leaves only one path: deception. No! Nao. "It's sad, but he's right. Forget it." I won't! "It's okay. I promise the chance will come again." Let's work toward that. Mai... "Human weakness... and greed." That's the essence of the game. That's why a unanimous red vote... has never happened. Nao? Buzz off, mushroom. I'm sorry I betrayed you. "But there's another way to get everyone to vote red." Yukina, Kuji. "Get Akiyama and we'll have a team of 6." Team? "It's now a battle for majority between gold and silver." So we build a 6-person majority. "The only way to lose is for all of us to vote the same." This guarantees victory. But then only some of us can win. "Don't worry. We don't want that." "Sooner or later, our team effort will be discovered." "We can even let them know. Then what?" They'll ask to join our team. "And we'll welcome the other five with open arms." Welcome friends! "Condition's will be ripe for another go at unity." "It's a prelude to us casting all red apples." It's not just for us. That's great, Fukunaga! "You're not going to believe him, are you?" He just betrayed you. "We've fought together a long time. Trust me." Nao. It may be our only hope. Suit yourself. "I'd rather act alone than side with him." Mai! "Leave her. If this works..." she'll be back, too. But... Yes, I betrayed you... I'm sorry. "But at least I was honest about it. Want to know why?" "To strengthen your guard! Or you'll be tricked repeatedly." "But it's okay now. We can still get all reds." "Don't give up. We'll do it together." Okay. I'll believe you, Fukunaga. Thanks. "I'll go find another person we can trust." Okay. He's a good fellow. "Fukunaga always ends up being a pretty trustworthy ally." Ally, huh? Yes. Here he is. Thanks for having me. I was at a loss by myself. Okay, let's get a majority. Our first vote is... gold. I'll vote next. Wait. Let me go. "All the votes are in. Here are the results." Think we'll win? "Yes. Could be what we need to come together." Could be what we need... to come together. Don't make me laugh! Mai? You thought you were the only team? Fools. We had a team, too. So what? We outnumber you. That's right. Six against five. Count again. Fukunaga. You're kidding. The joke's on you! Nao's a pushover. You think you know me, but you don't. I've done bad things. You should run. Now. I can make my own decisions. I'm 17. I have to show you something. Okay. - I knew it. - Are you scared? - No. - You should be. I'm just scared I'm dreaming and I'll wake up in math class. Is it gonna hurt? I could never hurt you. Come with me. - Where? - Let me show you my world. Edgy. So your place, is there gonna be velvet? Yeah, sure. This is it? But it smells like pee. Nice work, Robbie. Robert. What's happening? This is what you wanted, isn't it? Hey. So I'm actually not far. I'm about a night's drive. Yeah? So you think...? There's some stuff I gotta do first. - Of course. - But I was thinking that I'll wrap up here and, you know, make sure I'm not followed. I'll take side streets, come at night. Will you just shut up and get your ass home? I can't wait to see you. - This phone thing's getting old. - Yeah. Well, call us when you're close. And be careful. Of course. Hey. - What are you so stoked about? - What? Nothing. What do you got? Six girls in seven days. More disappearances than this city has seen in over a year. - All about the same age and- - And cute. Ice cream comes in lots of flavors. Sure. Well, half a dozen girls, late teens, a shower away from greatness. It sounds like a profile. - I wonder what else they got in common. - Well, six directions to go here. - Pick a number. - Seven. Another call just came in today. Kristen's a good kid. A little naive, sure. You try and be a good parent. Girls are hard. Right. We'd just like to find your daughter. - Last door on the left. - Thanks. What do you think he was talking about? Drugs? Oh, it is so much worse. Vampires? No, these aren't vampires, man. These... - These are douchebags. - Yeah. Wow. Hm. A- ha. All right. Let's see what we can see. All right. That's just uncomfortable. What is he so bummed out about? Look at this. He's watching her sleep. How is that not rapey? I gotta concentrate, Dean. "He could hear the blood rushing inside her, almost taste it. He tried desperately to control himself. Romero knew their love was impossible. " - Romero? Really? - Dean, shut up. This is am? All right. Sorry. I gotta go make a fake Ben. Here it is. Our last pizzas together as roommates. I wish I knew that. I ordered Chinese. Well, that's okay. In a way it's kind of nice. You know? Our last dinner together. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors... ... you,thefoodofyours! I had an idea for what to do on our last night. What do you say we play a little foosball for money? Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me since my injury-plagued '97 season. -It'd be easier to give me your money. -Yes, it would. What do you say to $50? -You're on. -Okay, let's play. The big game. Italy versus... ... China,apparently. Look, it's the Rollerblades. Oh, God! You remember when we got these? I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun. Come on. Hey, remember the time... . You don't remember? Sorry, Pheebs. I'm just really sad that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. This doesn't have to be so sad, though, you know? Instead of thinking about how you'll miss each other... ... youshouldthinkofthethings you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. She's perfect. I have one. Okay, you can go first. I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact... ... thatyou'reneverallowed to move the phone pen. That's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? You know, does Rachel move the phone pen? Sometimes. Always, actually. There you go. Doesn't everyone feel better? Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. You get your messages. It doesn't count if you have to read them off your hand... ... afteryou'vefallenasleep on the couch. So you missed a message from who? Chandler? Or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? It worked! No one's sad! I win again! That's, like, 500 bucks you owe me! Man! Five hundred dollars. That is a lot of electricity, huh? I gotta buy some food. Give me a chance to win my money back. Sudden death... ... onegoal,$1 000. -You serious? -Yes! Get ready to owe me. Here we go. Ready? No... ... onecanbeatme! That's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking. Hi, Ross. See, other people call me! Your brother. Score! What's up? I'm here with Ben. Thought we'd say hi. Put him on. Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling, though. Okay, talk to you later. I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, remember the Rollerblades? You know what else I won't miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilets 1 7 times a day, even if people are on it! " "Hi, I'm Rachel. Is my sweater too tight? I'd better wash it and shrink it! " "I'm Monica. I never get messages from interesting people. " I call her. "Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross! " "My God! I can't find a boyfriend. I'll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find there! " We should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations. Still broken? It sucks, man. Your last night, and I lose the two most important things: The foosball table... ... and$ 500. There are other ways to win back your money. How about blackjack? Not my game. You know what? We can play a new game. -It's fun! -What's it called? Cups. -I don't know how. -I'll teach you. It's easy and fun. -All right. -Here you go. I have two queens. What do you have? -A 2 and a 5. -You win! Fifty dollars! -Really? -Let's play again. -What have you got? -4 and a 9. You're kidding, right? -No. Why? -That's a full cup! Damn, I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her. You have to take the first step... ... becauseshe'stheone who 's leaving. It's harder for her. Maybe you're right. But she made fun of my phone pen! I know. I took it hard too. I feel bad about what happened-- -What are you doing? -I'm unpacking. I'm not moving. Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left. You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler! You should go! Why do I have to leave? -It's my apartment! -It's mine too! What else you got? How about: You're moving! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! -Hey, how you guys doing? -Great. Monica's moving. I am not! Really? How come all your stuff is in this box? Okay, you guys, I think I know what's going on here! You guys? Stop! I know you're acting mad because it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down, you're really sad. Deep, deep down. -No, Phoebe, I am mad! -Well, deep down! I'm just mad. Then keep running. You win! -What did you have? -Nothing beats... ... athreeandasix. That, my friend, is "D Cup. " How much have you won so far? -700. -Not 700 exactly? Double it. In Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get one card. That one card could be worth $1 00, which brings your total to $1 500. Don't get excited, that won't happen unless you get the- - No way! This is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it "What were you thinking?" I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Guys, I don't wanna make things worse, but... ... Idon'twannalivewith Rachel anymore. You're so mean to each other. I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you. That's fine because I'm not moving. Phoebe, you gotta take her. I said some bad stuff... ... butRachelhasqualities that make her a good roommate. Like what, Monica? She has 1 47,000 pair of boots? Good start, Mon. She lets you borrow them. And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold! She gets tons of catalogs and folds down the pages of things I'd like. What else? When I take a shower... ... sheleavesme notesonthemirror. I do. I do do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch... ... shecoversme withablanket. Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her I was gonna move in with Chandler... ... shewasreallysupportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! It's gonna be fine. Now I can't wait to live with you! You know what we should do? Bring Monica, and we'll live together! We'll have so much fun! I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh, that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh, my God! How's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. He's right-- Oh, my God! Get your head out of your shirt there, son! Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. -What's wrong? -Ross and I were helping pack... ... tooka littlebreak. I lost $1 500 to him in Cups! How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost! I started out with the king and the queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a jack and a king. Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5. Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup... ... thesitting-downbonus. Ididn 't even get half a cup! Nothing! Oh, man! He never played before either. I think beginner's luck is very important in Cups! Let's play one more hand. One more hand. No more! I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time. In fact, look. I wanna give you something. Let me give it to you before I pawn it for Cups money. I want you to have the big, white dog... ... asa thank-youforbeing such a great roommate. I can't take the big, white dog. You love it. It's "him. " Not "it. " What if I bought it from you? Then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price. Say $1 500? Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here. You're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Over there with the bills! You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it. We had a nice last night together. We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money. Now you start with the charity thing again! I'm trying to help you out. I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay. You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing I'm gonna miss... ... isyou. And now the dog. -Call me when you get there, okay? -Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. I have your key. -Here you go. -Thanks. God, this is silly. I'll see you in a couple of hours. Bye, house. -She really left. -I know. -Thank you. -No problem, roomie. -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. -And now you want that money back? -Exactly. What kind of idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game. I made it up. I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square. At a fake game! If you wanna try to make some of it back... ... I'dbegladtoplay youforit . But I should warn you. I am very good at Cups. I assume the saucer card came up when you played last? Let's see if it comes up this time. Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent. Right! And when is that due? - First of the month. - And that's every month? No, just the months you actually want to live here. Okay, here is the phone bill. Oh my God! That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing. So why don't I just? why don't I just cover you for a while? No- no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity. ¡¦anymore. - It's not charity, Joe¡¦ - No! Forget it! Okay? I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on. Okay uh, here's the electric bill. - This is how much we pay for electric? ! - Uh, yeah. So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then? So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment? No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it. Well, how much do you think he needs? I figure that $1, 500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride. Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want. Well that would help the pride thing. Hey! Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow? - Okay. - Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight? Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel... We thought we'd go out to dinner. And celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe. And also, my birthday. It's not your birthday. What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night? Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing. Whoa- whoa- whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it. I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! - Pheebs, I was wondering¡¦ - You're not dressed yet? We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes! Well and clearly not a minute sooner. Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed. Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight. My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place. Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you. Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, what you're wearing is fine for that. Rachel, I need to borrow? You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit! Surprise! What? No, no don't get mad because look? this is what happened. So I - I started packing, then I realized. "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night. Ta- da! I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe? I have plans. - You're plans were with us. - That's right. All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out! Okay. Oh my God, thank you! Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves! Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with¡¦ Oh nope, I - I have plans with Joey. I thought you said you were going to do nothing. Yes, but for the last time. - Okay fine, now Ross¡¦ - Oh, but- but I can't do it. Why not? I've got Ben. Because, because I've got Ben. It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where- where is he? He's at a dinner party. Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment! Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as- as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right, sorry. I gotta go make a fake Ben. Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates. Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese. Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours! Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money? What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued'97 season. - It would be easier if you just give me your money. - Yes it would. What do you say to $50? - Okay, you're on. - Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently. Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades. Oh God! You remember when we got these? No. I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time¡¦ You don't remember? I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. Nope, she's perfect. I have one. Good! Great! You can go first. Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen? Aw, sometimes. Always, actually. Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better? Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. You get your messages! Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch. So- so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? Great! It worked! No one's sad. Yes! I win again! Ha- ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo- ho- hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo- ho- ho! I gotta buy some food. Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1, 000. - You serious? - Oh yes! - Okay, get ready to owe me! - Okay. Okay, here we go. Ready? No! No! No! No? One can beat me. See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me! Ooh, your brother. Score! What's up? Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi. Oh, put him on! Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later. Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? You know what else I'm not gonna miss?" I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!" "Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!" "I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!" Hey! I call her! "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!" "Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"' Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. Still broken? This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life. The foosball table and..... $500. Well, there are other ways of winning back your money. How about a little uh, a little Blackjack? Nah, not my game. Okay, uh, how about, how about? y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun. Well, what's it called? Cups. - I don't know how to play Cups. - I'll teach ya! - Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun. - All right. Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have? A two and a five. Ho- ho, you win! 50 dollars! - Really? - Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got? A four and a nine. You're kidding right? No. Why? Well that's a full cup! Damn! I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her! Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her! Well, maybe you're right? She made fun of my phone pen! I know, I took it hard too. Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about? What are you doing? I'm unpacking! What? I'm not moving! Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left! Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave? - Because it's my apartment! - Well it's mine too! What else you got? How about, you're moving! Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! Hey, how are you guys doing? Great! Monica's moving! I am not! Oh really? Then how come all your stuff is in this box? Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys¡¦ STOP! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep- deep down. No Phoebe I am mad! Well, deep- deep- deep down! Yeah, I'm just mad! Then keep running. You win. Well, what did you have? It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D - Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? Uh, wow, 700. Not 700 exactly? Yeah. Double it! What? Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1, 500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get? No way! Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it,"What were you thinking?" Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse. But umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore. What? You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving. Whoa- whoa- whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I - I - I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. Oh really? Like what Monica? Y'know she has 147, 000 pairs of boots¡¦ Oh yeah, good start Mon. She lets you borrow them. Yeah and you stretch ¡®em out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like. What else? When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Yeah, I do. I - I do, do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler... She was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! Oh, it's gonna be fine. Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun! But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh my God! Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right? Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey! What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break... I lost $1, 500 to him in Cups! Wh - How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D - Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'! Oh man! And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups. All right, let's play one more hand! One more! No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In- in fact, look, there's a? I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know.. Thank you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big white dog! You love it! It's him, not it! No, but wait? what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say. $1, 500? Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You- you're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss¡¦is you. And now the dog. - Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. - Oh! I have your key. Here you go. - Thanks. Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours. Bye house! Bye Mon. She really left. I know. Thank you. No problem roomie. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure! What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. - And now you want that money back. - Exactly. Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game! I made it up! I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. At a fake game! Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups. Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last. No. Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time. - Okay. - Aah. Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you are gonna be in charge of paying the rent. - Right, and when is that due? - First of the month. And that's every month? No, just the months you actually want to live here. Ah. Okay, here's the phone bill. Oh, my God! That's our phone number. Look, I know I kind of sprung this whole me-moving-out-on-you thing. - So why don't I just cover you for a while? - No, no. No way. Joey Tribbiani does not take charity anymore. - It's not charity, Joe. - No, forget it. Okay? I mean, thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right? I can take care of myself. Now, what's next? Come on. Okay, uh, here's the electric bill. - This is how much we pay for electric? - Well, yeah. [GRUMBLES] CHANDLER: So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then? So is Joey gonna have to give up the apartment? I hope not. I tried to offer him money, but he wouldn't take it. How much do you think he needs? I figure $1500 would cover him for a few months, you know but I have to trick him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride. Yeah. Well, why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits whenever you want. Well, that would help the pride thing. - Hey. CHANDLER: Hey. Wow, you look great. Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow? - Okay. - Okay. What do you girls have planned for tonight? Instead of being sad that tonight's my last night with Rachel we thought we'd go out and celebrate: Rachel's moving in with Phoebe. - And also my birthday. Ha, ha. - It's not your birthday.

Yeah, he's right... Oh, my God. Get your head out of your shirt there, son. What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey. - What's wrong? - Ross and I were helping the girls pack took a little break. I lost $1500 to him in Cups. Wha...? How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost. I started out with the king and the queen. Bam. Ross gets a two and a three. Then I get a jack and a king. Boom. Ross gets a four and five.

I wanna give you something, okay? And let me give it to you now before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big, white dog as a... Kind of a thank-you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big, white dog. You love it. It's "him." Not "it." Well, what if I bought it from you, you know?

The only thing I'm gonna miss is you. And now the dog. MONICA: Hey. - Call me when you get there, okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. Oh, I have your key. - Here you go. - Thanks. Oh, God, this is silly. I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours. Bye, house. [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Bye-bye. - Bye. Hey. - She really left. - I know. - Thank you. - No problem, roomie. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. - And now you want that money back? - Exactly. Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game. I made it up. I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square. At a fake game! Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you. I am very good at Cups. Okay, now, I assume the saucer card came up when you played last? - No. - Hmm. Let's see if it comes up this time. [English - US - SDH] Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent. Right! And when is that due? - First of the month. - And that's every month? No, just the months you actually want to live here. Okay, here is the phone bill. Oh my God! That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing. So why don't I just? why don't I just cover you for a while? No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity. ...anymore. - It's not charity, Joe... - No! Forget it! Okay? I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on. Okay uh, here's the electric bill. -This is how much we pay for electric? ! -Uh, yeah. So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then? So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment? No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it. Well, how much do you think he needs? I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride. Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want. Well that would help the pride thing. Hey! Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow? -Okay. -Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight? Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel... We thought we'd go out to dinner. And celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe. And also, my birthday. It's not your birthday. What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday! -Hey! -Hey! Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night? Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing. Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it. I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! -Pheebs, I was wondering... -You're not dressed yet? ! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes! Well and clearly not a minute sooner. Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed. Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight. My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place. Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you. Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, what you're wearing is fine for that. Rachel, I need to borrow? You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit! Surprise! What? No, no don't get mad because look? this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized. "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night. Ta-da! I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe? I have plans. - You're plans were with us. - That's right. All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out! Okay. Oh my God, thank you! Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves! Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with... Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey. I thought you said you were going to do nothing. Yes, but for the last time. - Okay fine, now Ross... - Oh, but-but I can't do it. Why not? I've got Ben. Because, because I've got Ben. It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he? He's at a dinner party. Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment! Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right, sorry. I gotta go make a fake Ben. Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates. Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese. Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours! Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money? What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. - It would be easier if you just give me your money. - Yes it would. What do you say to $50? - Okay, you're on. - Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently. Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades. Oh God! You remember when we got these? No. I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember? I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. Nope, she's perfect. I have one. Good! Great! You can go first. Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen? Aw, sometimes. Always, actually. Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better? Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. You get your messages! Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch. So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? Great! It worked! No one's sad. Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food. Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000. - You serious? - Oh yes! - Okay, get ready to owe me! - Okay. Okay, here we go. Ready? No! No! No! No? One can beat me. See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me! Ooh, your brother. Score! What's up? Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi. Oh, put him on! Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later. Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? You know what else I'm not gonna miss? " I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!" "Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!" "I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!" Hey! I call her! "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!" "Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"' Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. Still broken? This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life. The foosball table and..... $500. Well, there are other ways of winning back your money. How about a little uh, a little Blackjack? Nah, not my game. Okay, uh, how about, how about? y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun. Well, what's it called? Cups. - I don't know how to play Cups. - I'll teach ya! - Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun. - All right. Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have? A two and a five. Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars! - Really? ! - Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got? A four and a nine. You're kidding right? No. Why? Well that's a full cup! Damn! I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her! Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her! Well, maybe you're right? She made fun of my phone pen! I know, I took it hard too. Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about? What are you doing? I'm unpacking! What? ! I'm not moving! Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left! Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave? - Because it's my apartment! - Well it's mine too! What else you got? ! How about, you're moving! Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! Hey, how are you guys doing? Great! Monica's moving! I am not! Oh really? ! Then how come all your stuff is in this box? ! Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down. No Phoebe I am mad! Well, deep-deep-deep down! Yeah, I'm just mad! Then keep running. You win. Well, what did you have? It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? Uh, wow, 700. Not 700 exactly? Yeah. Double it! What? Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get? No way! Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?" Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse. But umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore. What? ! You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving. Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. Oh really? Like what Monica? Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots... Oh yeah, good start Mon. She lets you borrow them. Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? ! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like. What else? When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler... She was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! Oh, it's gonna be fine. Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun! But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh my God! Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right? Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey! What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break... I lost $1,500 to him in Cups! Wh-How did you lose at Cups? ! The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'! Oh man! And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups. All right, let's play one more hand! One more! No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a? I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know.. Thank you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big white dog! You love it! It's him, not it! No, but wait? what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say. $1,500? Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss is you. And now the dog. - Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. - Oh! I have your key. Here you go. - Thanks. Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours. Bye house! Bye Mon. She really left. I know. Thank you. No this them? Yeah, yeah. She asked me if I had any pictures to bring over. Hey, maybe you could, um, you could grab something at that organic place on main street. They have really good food. You know, her husband was just killed by an i.e.d. I think I should probably cook something. You're right. Maybe soup? Soup's a lot easier, and it's comforting. Yeah, maybe soup. Justin, are you okay? Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 'cause ever since the funeral... No, no, I really am. I just, uh, you know, want to do something nice and... And help her out. That's nice. You want some company? Um, no, no. You go check out your house. It would be our house. Right. Our house. bye. What are you doing here? This is what unemployed losers do. They hang out in their mother's kitchens making sandwiches. You want a turkey and swiss? There's, like, 4 pounds of meat in here. I know. Don't ask. Make two or three. Okay. So how's the big move in going? Oh, you know... It's going. Did you get a chance to look over those contracts? Yeah, it's all pretty standard. The longer they keep drilling, the more you have to pay. Well, according to the local well records for the surrounding area, there's gotta be at lea water there. Okay, so all you can do now is wait. Which I'm really bad at. Well, where is luc? He usually manages to distract me. Actually, we're fighting. Oh, stop. He's too beautiful for that. Nobody's too beautiful for that. Oh, wow. You really do need help. You know what goes well with waiting? Turkey? Wine! Are you guys always here? I know. It's sad. Hey, evan. Come give me a kiss, buddy. Careful. He might eat you. Mwah. He's got the appetite of a football player. He's grown. Hey, beautiful. Do you want a glass? No. I'm gonna wait till the sun goes down. And besides, I gotta play tennis. Tennis? You know, I got roped into playing this doubles tournament. So I figured i'd go and hit with the pro. Why don't you ask this pro standing right here? You mean drinking right there. I was awesome back in the day. We were awesome. huh. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Got him. Then what happened? Uh, well, there was so much smoke and sand, I couldn't see, but I felt this guy grab my leg, so I reached down and picked him up and guess what. It was my buddy brian. That's unbelievable. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Look out! Oh, go left, go left, go left! Left, left, left. Left, left, left. Left, left, left, left, left. Oh, get him right there. What are you doing? ! Grandma. We're just playing. You have been playing for hours. It's a beautiful day outside. Why don't you go outside and play? Just let me kill a couple more invaders. Get him, get him. He's right there. Right there. Right there. Justin, darling, I love you. But why are you here? I need to make soup for a friend, and I was wondering if you could help me. What, like chicken soup? You know a hundred doctors. You're in med school. Have 'em write a prescription. I have my hands full today. She's not sick, mom. It's jake's widow... The guy who died in afghanistan. Oh. Got him. Got him. Got him? You got him. Head shot. Head shot. Ooh! Okay, cooper, time's up. Time's up. Here. You can take this. Go outside. Shoot some hoops. Look at all the stuff I drug out of the garage. Yeah, and stay in the yard and don't go near the pool. Miss you, buddy. Okay, come on. Let's go make some soup. All right. Just let me kill this one more bad guy. I'll be there in two minutes. Love you, ma. I can't bring stragglers, you guys. It's a private club. What club? Altadena tennis club. Card-carrying members. Since 1982. Yeah. hey. What, are you two drinking? It's not even noon. We're being european. Yeah. You're being something. Don't worry. We're leaving. We have to practice for a tennis tournament. Now... Now wait a minute. Just hold on. Tell him how great we were as doubles. They were good. They were very, very good. Of course, they almost got thrown out of the club. She only slapped him. Mom, it was a bad call, and you know it. Yeah. Oh, kevin. I can't. Why not? I've got cooper for the weekend. Well, when is the tournament? Well, it's, uh, tomorrow. Today is just practice. Well, that's perfect. I can take care of cooper today, and tomorrow, he's got a play date. No, but, mom, I was gonna take him to the play date and stay with him. He's 8 years old. I think one mom is enough. I don't know about that. Sarah, think about this. It would be fabulous. It would be robert and kevin against you and luc. No. I mean, the whole point is that kevrah was great together. Yeah. We don't even know if luc can play. Probably not. Well, now's yourururnce to find out. It would be wonderful for the two of you to have some adult time, honey. So it's done. Take them away. Yes. Can I make a deal with you? Yeah. Will you watch him till the nanny gets here? Absolutely. Good, good, good. And then I get to play with kevrah. kevrah. Well, and luc. Yeah. And luc. It's perfect, isn't it? mm. It looks amazing. I think you should do it. What? You mean, like... Like, put an offer in? You have the money. Pull it from ojai and transfer it into your personal account and make an offer. Mom, the agent already got two offers. They always say that. That's a sales technique. I saw a couple take out their checkbook. Well, then transfer the money and take out yours. It's just an offer. You're not obligated to spend a dime. So what, just pick up the phone and make a couple of calls? Yeah. That's all you have to do. If you really love this house... Then make it happen. She's looking at a house? That's very exciting. Yeah. Well, she's just looking, so it's not really a big deal. It's a really big deal. It would be your first house. Ma, we're not buying anything, so maybe we should just make the soup. Okay, you've chopped that enough. Put a big handful in the cheesecloth, and then tie it up with this string. Put it in the soup. It's an herb bouquet. And we can take it out before we give it to her. Right. Why do you have your dog tags on? Because I found 'em by my uniform when I was, uh, getting dressed for the funeral. Jake. Why did he go back, justin? It breaks my heart that he was there. Well, somebody has to be. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I know this hit you hard. Have you been going to your meetings? Yes, mom, I've been going to my n.a. Meetings. I'm... I'm fine, really. Then maybe you could take your dog tags off. Okay. This is all done. So I'll just drop it in the soup? Yeah. Cooper, you know the rules. No swimming without a grown-up. Mom, I know how to swim. I just wanted to do a cannonball. Listen, if you had hit your head and no one was there, you would've drowned. And don't even get me started about the whole clothes thing. oh. hey. Were you with him? Yeah, I went to get him a towel. Luc, you said that you would keep an eye on him while I got changed. Well, I was, but he wanted to go swimming, so I went to pick up his bathing suit and told him to wait by the pool. Pfft. You took too long. What? Cooper, seriously? You told me you would wait. How am I supposed to trust you if you do things like that? What were you doing outside anyway? You said that you would stay here, play video games and stay out of trouble. Cooper, my goodness. You're soaking wet. What, did you fall in the pool? No, mom. He decided to go for a swim, alone, with his clothes on. You're the one who told me to go outside. I told you to go out and shoot some baskets rather than sitting here and shooting monsters all day. They're aliens. Okay, that is enough from you. Go get changed. I will deal with you later. Off you go. Look, mom, I told you... I know, sarah. I know. You told me you like to use these games as some kind of babysitter, but, honey, the one he's playing is the most violent game I have ever seen. That is ridiculous. He's shooting blue blobs. You never minded when tommy was playing with "duck hunt." "duck hunt"? Besides, it's a lot safer than swimming in that pool alone. I didn't expect him to jump in the pool fully clothed. Yeah, no one did. Sarah, I have to tell you, I think this game is a problem. All of these games are a problem. Oh, mom, stop. You told me yourself, he stapled some girl's ponytail? He's a boy. He's a little aggressive. He needs an outlet. Boys will be boys, is that it? Could you back me up here? I'm sorry, sarah. I think your mom is right. Stop making excuses. Video games or not, cooper has been acting out. Cooper is going through a bit of a rough patch right now. I am doing the very best I can, and I think the last thing that cooper needs is more cooks in the kitchen. Well, you asked for my opinion. I told you. Yeah, you did. If you two are finished ganging up on me, i'm gonna go talk to my boy. look at us... A couple of men of leisure hitting some tennis balls on a saturday afternoon. That's us. Feels weird to me, you know... Scheduling my day around court times and martini lunches, nowhere to report? Does it feel weird to you? No, but that's probably 'cause I still have my job as a united states senator. Go on. Get up there. I'm serving. All right, these go. oh! yes! Sarah, that was on my side. I didn't think you had it. I know how to play tennis. It's gonna be a long day. Let's go, kev. Buck up. Here we go. I know technically, you're still working. But what's next? I mean, you don't have anything lined up? Don't worry. I'll think of something. You're the most ambitious person I'll ever know. That's why I can't figure out why you're so cool playing tennis on a saturday afternoon. Well, we all have to enjoy our lives. Love-15. Bring it on. ¶ right down to the bone ¶ yeah! Nice try, babe. Don't patronize me. You know what? Maybe you're right. I mean, why am I so high strung? If you can handle the easy life, i'm sure I could. I just need to learn how to chill. Right? You need to learn how to play that net. Okay. 15 all. ¶ you might get away with it ¶ ¶ it's a risk, it's a risk, yeah ¶ ¶ too big for my heart ¶ oh! That's my partner! Nice shot, kev. Thanks, rah. That's what I'm talking about. You know what? That did feel good. I should play more tennis. Here we go. All right, kev. Let's do it. All right. ¶ a loss of the senses ¶ ouch. I had it. It was my ball. Why don't you play singles? ¶ they ride in your suit ¶ aha! A point. Don't get cocky. Nice shot. ¶ don't think, don't think ¶ ¶ don't talk, don't think ¶ just out. What? No, no, no, no, no. There is no way that was out. Well, it was too close for me to call. I think it was out. Yeah, well, of course you do. What is that supposed to mean? Luc, come on. You question my tennis game, my parenting. Maybe you and my mother should play together, because it feels like you two are in agreement about a lot of things lately. Sarah, I think it was out. That's all I'm saying. You know what? Let me play forehand. Hey, you know, I have an idea. You guys have such a great history on the court. Why don't you guys play together? And, luc, you come over here for a minute. Fine by me. Works for me. A thousand thank yous. You kidding me? Been there. And there's my move, so it's your turn. aha. Which move will it be? There. You see? You really have to think about this game. You have to strategize. You have to suss out your opponent. There! I took you. I like "galactic showdown" better. You fly space ships and shoot bad guys, just like uncle justin did in the war. It was so cool. He saved his friend by dragging him through the desert. And then there were real-life helicopters. He got to jump out of one once. It was so cool. Yes, I know. He was very brave. Okay. There, it's your move. King me, grammy! I'm not going to king you. You have to earn that. Don't you think? mmm. These biscotti are amazing. I feel like I'm sitting on a piazza in florence. God, I'm good. oh. mmm. Hello, boys. Ooh, working on our menu? Kevin... You have to taste these biscotti. They're fantastic. I can't. I'm in training. I thought you were working on contracts. Where have you been, wimbledon? Maybe next year. I whizzed through my contracts, and then I tripped the light fantastic at the altadena country club. You're kidding. They let you back in after the incident? Oh! That was one stupid harassment suit from a disgruntled tennis pro. Oh, and guess what. What? Kevrah lives. Kevrah? Don't ask. You should've seen us on the court today, uncle saul. Like riding a bicycle. I was venus to sarah's serena. Were venus and serena drinking? 'cause you seem very relaxed all of a sudden. Mm. Actually, I did have a glass of wine with lunch. You know what I've realized? I've worked since I was 15. That's 23 years without a break. And for what? Money. Yeah, and I'll work again, but right now, no one's exactly beating down the door to hire me. So you know what? This might be a blessing in disguise. No one actually needs my help, not even you guys. Oh, kevin, stop it. If you want to get involved in the restaurant, you can. I just assumed that you... No, no, no. That's your passion. Now I have my own passion. Really? And what might that be? Tennis. So if you'd excuse me, i'm gonna go and soak because I need to be nice and loose and limber for my big game tomorrow. Kevrah for match point. Walker serves. Aces. Crowd goes wild. Who knew unemployment could be so much fun? hey. Hey. How did it go? Uh, okay. Okay. Good call on the, uh, soup. She, uh, she really liked it. Oh, good. I'm glad. ohh. So... Justin... Yeah. The house was amazing. I mean, absolutely amazing. A huge backyard, a swing on the front porch, built-ins in every room... It was perfect. Cool. I'd really like for you to come see it with me tonight. Uh, rebecca, listen, I was kinda hoping we could just chill and watch a movie. Okay, well, the thing is... I know I was supposed to be window-shopping, that the money should be back in my account by monday, and there were other buyers that were interested, so... I put an offer in. Wait. You made an offer? We don't have to pay them anything. Whoa. Time-out. Time... Rebecca, you made an offer on a house that I haven't even set foot in yet? No, I know. And, justin, obviously, if you don't like it, we're not... We're not gonna buy it. I just want you to come and see it with me. It's perfect and... This is crazy to me, rebecca. Well, I don't understand. What is so crazy about us wanting to buy a house together? I mean, I don't even know where this is coming from. You know what? Fine. You don't get it. Then it explain it to me, because, justin, this morning, you said that you were fine and you seemed to be dealing with this. So obviously, this is hitting you a lot harder than you're willing to admit. Okay, what do you want from me? All right? My friends are dying. I'm having trouble thinking about houses and blenders. All right? Justin, calm down. And the degree I'm gonna get in seven years. Calm down. I'm sorry. I know that jake was your friend, but think about it. The last thing he would want you to do is stop living your life, and if you're trying to shame me into not wanting a comfortable future with you, then... Then you're right, I don't understand. All right. Fine. I-I have nothing else to tell you. all right, let's stretch it out. I got you. Really feel it. There you go. Okay, when I say "we are," you say "champions." We are... Champions. We are... Champions. We are... Champions. You in this, sis? yep. You have to say it. Oh, yeah, sorry. To win it, bro. All right. What's up? Cooper's play date canceled. Mom's bringing him to watch the game. There is no way he's gonna sit still that long. Sarah, she raised five of us. Yeah, but we didn't have to deal with a strange frenchman moving into our house. There was that one exchange student. Look, she's, like, the child whisperer, okay? Let her focus on cooper. You focus on the match. We'll be fine. Okay. Okay? Go, team kevrah. Where are those guys? I don't know. You think we scared them off yesterday? Robert? Doubtful. Senator. Bill stanton. Good to meet you. It's a beautiful day for a good cause, wouldn't you say? Yeah, I'm... Just happy to be here to help out. Yeah, you know, I was sorry to hear you're not running for reelection. Ah. You got a line on what's next? That's sort of the $1-million question. Well, don't tell me it's golf. That'd be a prime waste of national resources. Well, now, now. You should wait until you see my short game before you say that. Well, maybe we should play sometime. Maybe we should. It's a nice club you have here. You're not a member, are you? No, no. I'm surprised they let me in at all. I think I've passed bills with less paperwork. Yeah. Well, sorry about that. Bureaucracy, right? Indeed. Well, next time, call me up. I'll walk you straight in. Or I could join. I'd be glad to sponsor you. Here. Try my cell if you're interested. Thank you. Pleasure, senator. I don't want to watch tennis. Why couldn't I have just stayed home with evan and his nanny? It's gonna be fun. Hold on. Hold on. I want to put more block on your nose. Here. Mom. You already lathered him up in the car. It's hot out. I missed his nose, justin. All right, never mind. Just wear this. How's that? no. You know, I wore a hat every day in iraq. You did? Mm-hmm. Everybody did. That's awesome. Did you also tell him you ended up in a hospital in germany? All right. Call it. No need. You can serve. Okay. So they have a great bar here. What do you want me to do? I ran into him. When it comes to bill stanton? Be rude and ignore him. He's the host. It's his charity event. Right. So write a check. Don't schmooze with the prince of darkness, okay? I mean, what did he want, help on votes for a contract? We were talking about golf. I just hope no one got a picture, 'cause that would be bad publicity. I thought you didn't work for me anymore. For kitty, I mean. But you're right. I don't work at all. So let's play tennis. Mccallisterandlaurenttoserve, first set. ah. Ooh. Nice serve. 15-love. Where the hell did that come from? Lucky shot. That wasn't a lucky shot. That was an ace. Hey. Sorry rebecca couldn't come today. Yeah. Is she busy? Uh, yeah, yeah, she was. Hey, coop, while you're in there, you want to grab me a granola bar, buddy? Okay. Out. 15 all. yes. Grandma? Yeah. Why do you have an umbrella? Shh. It's, um, it's not for the rain. It's for the sun. It's like your hat, only bigger, way bigger. Cooper, stop it. I'm just shooting luc. 15-30. Justin, would you grab that from him? You're the one who started it. What did I do? You think he got the idea to turn that into a gun all by himself? Uh, yes, mom. He's a boy. You take away the umbrella, he'll use a stick. You take away the stick, he'll use his hand. I had nothing to do with it. I'm gonna get a soda. Would you like anything? No, thank you. You should really knock that off. Cooper, stop it. 30 all. Hi, honey. How did you miss that? Sorry, I got distracted. Kevrah was undefeated in 17 years, okay? I'd like to keep it that way. oh. Nice shot. 40-30. Cooper, stop it. Cooper. Cooper. Cooper, what are you doing? Cooper. I'll handle this. He's throwing balls at the court. This is not cool. Listen, you talking to him now is only gonna make things worse. They're not gonna get any better if you keep butting in. What? He's my son. Yes, he is. And where do i fit in? Look, I don't know, but he already has a father, who, by the way, is not exactly thrilled about you, and obviously, neither is cooper. I'm stuck in the middle. I'm trying to figure it out. Well, you let me know when you do. Till then, we're not gonna be able to play as a team. Coop. Cooper. My... Sorry. It was an accident. Okay... Listen to me, that was no accident. The corkscrew, the swimming pool, this... None of it was an accident, was it, cooper? Hmm? Okay, you're coming home with me. Oh, I... Mom, this is my job, not yours. Sorry, kevin. We gotta forfeit. What? Get outta here. ow! hey. hey. Come on. We're leaving. What, already? Who... Who won the match? No one. It was a forfeit. Come on. Well, where is cooper? He's with sarah, so let's go. What, you know what? Time-out. What... What's the deal? Are you mad at me or something? No, I'm not mad at you. I'm onto you, justin. Wh... You're on... The funeral, the dog tags, all these war stories to cooper... I know where this is headed. Don't put words in my mouth. You want to go back to this hideous war. I don't want to go back, mom. I just want to... Don't lie to me, justin. I've been through this before. You went there twice. The last time almost killed you. Why would you go back? Your life is great. You're in med school. You have a wife who loves you. Yeah, and I love her, too, mom, and there's noth... You made a commitment to stay with her. You can't walk away from your life, justin. You can't. mm. that feels good. Wow. Andy roddick passed out on my couch. Roger federer's a better player. Yeah, but roddick is cuter. Oh, I'm flattered. But we both lost the big game. Well, I bet you played hard and gave it your all. Why are you being so nice to me? Maybe I feel guilty. I haven't exactly been paying attention to you lately. That's all right. I'm not a child. Although I have been behaving like one recently. We're having a baby in seven months. I need to get a job, any job. It's not about the job. Okay, I need to make money. It's not really about the money either. You need a purpose. And it's not tennis. Can we just leave all the purpose to you, just for a moment? I really want you to open this restaurant. Maybe that's my purpose, encouraging you. Do you know what I miss? What? The old kevin walker... Who ran towards his purpose. So why am I running away from it now? Because you don't know what it is and you hate uncertainty. At least i'm certain of you. Now I know we talked about luc moving in, and you were excited about the idea of it. But now there's a whole new member of the family, and we think you might be finding it a bit challenging. hmm? It's different than what I expected. I get that. You know, for me, too. But he's here now, so it's time that we all learn... How we're gonna get along. Now I love luc, okay? So when you hurt his feelings, you hurt my feelings, the same way that I'd be hurt if somebody hurt you. You know what I'm talking about? yes. Good. So do you have something you might want to say to luc? I'm sorry, luc. Thank you, cooper. Okay, now you go brush your teeth, start a chapter, and I'll be in to tuck you in, okay? I love you. Mwah. Nicely done. Thank you. I wonder if he's upset that he's not the man of the house anymore. You know, he used to... Come and cuddle and fall asleep and... He always had me all to himself. Speaking of cuddling... You know, I don't think cooper is the only problem here. I think you need to deal with your own issues. You're right. I'm so sorry. Okay, here's the deal... What if the only reason we've been deliriously happy is because we've been living in a fantasy? And now it's... Real. Yeah. Real is good, right? Real is real. It's paint colors and temper tantrums and... And the emotional lives of 8 year olds. I don't want to mess this up, luc. For me, this is... This is a huge deal. And it's a huge deal for me, too. I want to be a family with you. But you think cooper's tough? Try living with a 13-year-old girl who hates you. You're so relaxed about it. I don't think you really have thought through the stress that children put on a relationship. What if it's just too hard? Now I can deal with you breaking my heart. But I can't deal with you breaking theirs. I'm not gonna break anyone's heart. But we don't know that, do we? I love you, sarah. And I'm not trying to be their father or anything. No, I know. But do you know who you do want to b your partner, a very positive role model for the kids. And for that, i'm gonna need to have my own relationship with them. Then we are very, very, very lucky. Hello. hi. What have you got there? Oh, I just wanted to thank you for taking care of evan for so long. Oh, don't be silly. I'm his grandmother. I love it. Oh, I know. That's why it's not cash. Oh. Well, thank you. Sure. So, um... He's asleep in the living room right now in his playpen thingy. The nanny left right after we got back from the game. I'm just packing up all of his stuff right now. Okay. Robert, can I ask you something? Sure. Did justin talk to you about wanting to go back to afghanistan? Oh, god. He did. Look, nora... Oh, please tell me you didn't say anything to encourage him. No, I just listened. To what? Nora, the first time you enlist, it can be about a bunch of things. But if you reenlist, it's personal. It's about wanting to get back to people who you love and who understand you in a way that nobody else possibly can. Oh, that's easy for you to say. You're not going back to war. Well, we all go to war in different ways. But I don't want my son to go back to this war ever again. I understand. But that pull is awfully strong. And that's your son. Maybe you want to go take care of him. Oh, hey. Oh, my gosh. You would not believe the traffic out there. The 101 is... Is bumper-to-bumper ridiculous. Where's the little guy? Oh, he's... He's... Oh, shoot. Just got him down. So... No, no, no. First of all, just tell me, who won the match? Oh, luc and I won. You're kidding me? You beat kevrah? Yes, in a forfeit. Wait a minute... Cooper had a meltdown, so sarah had to leave. oh. so? So... Here's to my endorsements. I got 'em both. That is fantastic. It was a long shot, but I worked my magic, and as soon as hix caved, I called mccarty and... It's like I always say. What? What do you always say? Never bet against my wife. Oh. Mm. So how was the rest of your weekend? Anything important? Nothing to tell. Rebecca. Hello? hey. hey. ¶ it can be a real long road ¶ i, uh, I've been calling you. Yeah, I just needed to get out of the house so I took a run. At night? That's a little, uh, unsafe. Good thing I have reflectors on my shoes. oh. ¶ when you're on your own ¶ you want to talk? You know what, justin? I think you should do the talking. I don't know how to help you. Okay. ¶ it can be a real long ride ¶ rebecca, ever since the funeral, I've been thinking about how much jake and the other guys mean to me. And it's so much more than anything that's going on in my life right now. See, i, um... I don't think I want to be a doctor anymore. It just... It doesn't feel right. You know, it's all about being the best and... And not a team. And... There's one place where I felt like I belonged to a team... Where guys had my back. Don't. Don't you dare. No, no, look, let me talk, all right? Just because I'm feeling it doesn't mean I'm gonna act upon it, okay? So talk. ¶ don't hold back ¶ i'm not happy. What? Is it me or... No, no. Is it the house? No, no, it's... Justin, i'm sorry I got so excited. I mean, that house would mean nothing to me without you in it. Rebecca, you don't have to explain all that, okay? 'cause you are the only thing that works in my life. You are the one true thing. ¶... Where you end ¶ I just want to feel... Like I belong somewhere else, too. ¶ when I'm looking in your eyes ¶ and you will. ¶ give me just one more chance ¶ come here. mom. I'm leaving. Mom? Are you trapped under something heavy? no. mom? ¶ don't hold back ¶ what are you doing in here? Nothing. ¶ when the time is right ¶ you're alone in the pantry. What is it? If you're upset about me and luc, don't be. We had a really good chat last night. We're gonna be fine. It's not that, is it? No. I... I was just thinking. Oh. Okay. Sarah. hmm? I want to tell you something. Motherhood never gets easier, even when they're grown. No one ever told me that, and I... I just wanted to make sure I- I told you. Thanks, mom. Hiya! Hiya! What the hell is that? Oh, you gotta see this. It might even cheer you up. Come. Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! So you must visualize the attack and use the move to defend yourself. Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya. Hiya. Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Osu. Osu. Good job. What are they doing? Good job. Keep practicing. Having their own relationship. Again. Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! God. I didn't even know mom was in town. Did you know she was in town? Yeah I did. She was visiting Eunice. - She called you? - Nora, I called her. The point is that... That she's doing great. It's a miracle that it's only a sprained ankle. What the hell is she doing with her hair these days? Maybe she changed salons or her girl moved away. I remember... I don't know who you are. Your mother takes to wandering the streets, she gets hit by a bus and you talk about is who's doing her hair? Hospitals make me anxious. Hospitals or mom? Both. Mr. Holden. Dr. Lewis, hi. This is my sister Nora. Your mother's doing fine. Can you tell us what happened? We don't have much to go on. It wasn't until an hour or so ago that she was speaking coherently. Really? Can you... Tell us a little bit more about this disorientation? Tell me, how has she been? Has she seemed confused? She would call me and, with questions about things that I thought she should've known the answer to. Actually, the truth is, we both live here. - She lives in New Mexico... - Alone. That's gonna have to change. Disorientation like this is a serious problem... She's a danger to herself. She's a danger to others. God forbid, she has one of these episodes, she gets behind the wheel of a car... So what you're saying is that we should either send her to a home - or, a live-in nurse. - I recommend 24-hour care. What that looks like is up to you and your mother, but I will say this... It may be more than either of you want to take on by yourselves. But I cannot release her until I know what your plan is. - Thanks. - Thank you. Just take your time. So who gets to tell her? Wake up. - What is it? Is it Evan? - No. Evan is fine. Evan is asleep. But you are not gonna believe this. It started. - What are you doing up? - I've a fund-raiser in Anaheim at 8:00. Do you not remember anything? I mean, come on, Robert. Get with the program and read this. "Too sick to serve"... All about my cancer, all about your heart attack. And they use the word "hubris" a lot. Bummer. Did you just say "bummer"? This is exactly the kind of thinking that just cost you a job. - Wow - Yeah, right? Carver hit a walk-off in extra innings. I shouldn't have turned that game off. You're talking about baseball? Honey this is serious. - What do you wanna do about it? - I can think of a couple of things that I would like to do about it. Why are you taking this lying down? Because it's 5:30 in the morning. Just let this go. That's it? That, and I've gotta have more faith in the team. What are you doing awake? It's still dark outside? So when you think of Robert {\and you think of}me, do you think about death? Why? What happened? The blogs are just calling us "the catastrophe couple of California." And you want to hear the weirdest part? Robert is flatlining. He's not even taking it in,{\He's not even} reacting. He's pretending that he's concerned about the baseball scores. - That doesn't sound like Robert. - Thank you. Robert just lost a job because of this kind of discrimination. You can't not hire somebody because they have heart surgery. - Look at Dick Cheney. - Ah, Dick Cheney. There's a reason I should move to France with Luc. Why don't you and Luc get married? I've been through this. I'm not gonna let Luc's visa - be a reason I get remarried. - Have you made any more appeals? Are you kidding me? We've done everything we can. He's even in a lottery for a green card. I've written letters, e-mails, left messages. God knows if they ever get them. Easy does it. It's all gonna work out. You {\and Luc}are completely committed to each other. He's leaving his stuff there? Which, when this doesn't work, I'll have to ship all the way back to France. Listen, you guys are gonna visit each other. It's gonna be great. Visit? Come on. Big whoop. You know as well as I do that absence does not make the heart grow fonder. It just makes you realize that you can live your lives without each other. I don't want to live my life without him, and now I'm gonna cry again all over my spreadsheets. I cried in three meetings yesterday? One of them was to raise capital at a merchant bank. Maybe I just need to get my period. Gosh. Hang on. It's Kevin. - Hi. What are you doing up? - I couldn't sleep, I need some advice. Be quick about it cause I've got Sarah on the other line. When you were pregnant, what was your HCG level? What? I can't hear you? I have to be quiet. I promised Scotty I wouldn't go online, but I can't stop reading these forums. Your HCG level, what was it? - I don't know. I just peed on a stick. - Ours is 53. Michelle's going for a second test{\ today}, but it has to be double. It'd be so much easier if we were straight? We'd do a daily boob check and see if she was pregnant or not. - That's it. - What's it? - I gotta go. - Wait... Did you just tell me that you haven't gotten your period yet? - No. And it's not helping things. - Cause you know what? You and I are on the same cycle, I got mine, like, a week and a half ago, so you are late. You are very, very late. Really? You haven't been this emotional since you were pregnant with Cooper. The love of my life is moving to the other side of the world. Besides, come on, I'm 43. I'm more likely to be perimenopausal than I am to be pregnant. Please. People get pregnant in their 40s all the time. Not me... because I happen to be part of the catastrophe couple, but you... I'm not having this conversation. My God. This is gonna be so much fun. This is perfect. Evan's gonna have a new little playmate. Okay. Good-bye. Hello? If you called her at this hour to have her assess the tenderness of her breasts - I'm gonna kill you. - I'm not even on the phone. You are googling HCG levels, aren't you? It's better than what most people do at odd hours on a computer. Did you know 73% of people 10 days post-transfer who get a 53 end up with a BFN? Big fat negative. You heard what the doctor said. We're supposed to stay off the internet. Our situation is unique to us. Everybody's results are {\gonna be}different. - I heard the doctor. - Okay. Then why don't you look up movie times? It'll take our mind off things until Michelle calls. Okay, fine. What do you want to see? Want to go to a psychic? How's that gonna take things off our mind? You wanna ask a stranger if {\she thinks}we're pregnant? No, but, you know, it'd be fun. Ms. Nadine... World renowned... Psychic to the stars. World renowned? Why do you want to know the gory details? Because, mother, you could've been killed. Now we just want to know what happened. That's all. Fine. I left Chicago... Chicago? No, mother. This is Los Angeles. The show, you morons. The musical "Chicago"? Eunice and I went with her senior citizens group. Now if we could just please fill out this damn form so that I can get home. The doctor said that you couldn't remember anything about what happened, so... What's going on? Nothing, mommy. We're worried about you. That's all. You should honestly try to call us when you're thinking of coming to town. - Saul knew I was here. - Only because he happened to call you. At least someone calls me. We have to think about the future. What about it? Mother, listen. The doctors... They feel that you shouldn't be living by yourself any longer. Why, because I sprained my ankle? No, because apparently, you were in the middle of the road and didn't even know it. {\They said that}You weren't yourself for hours. They're worried that this could happen again. I lose my way for a couple of hours in a city I don't know, and you want to box me up and send me to a nursing home? That's where this is headed, right? You need help. Fine, Sauly. I'll move in with you. I don't think so. My house is small, I have work, and I just don't think you'd be happy there. You can live with me. Please, mother. Please live with me. I'd like that. I would rather live in a nursing home. Yes, I'm sorry you feel that way. But you're coming home with me. {\fade(2500,100)}{\1cHFF9933}Season 04 Episode 21 Where There's Smoke... {\***pub***}{\pos(192,220)}We got the bread maker that we registered for. {\pos(192,220)}The bread maker?

You know that's not the reason that I can't have her live with me. And what would be the reason for me to tell her. - At this point in my life that I'm gay? - It's the truth. - Nice. Nice. - I'm gonna call the kids. I'm gonna tell 'em they have to have dinner with us tonight. We have to, all of us, get used to the idea that Ida's gonna be staying here, hopefully for a very, very long time. I'm seeing a journey. A voyage of some sort. Are these the stars you referenced in your ad? I'm sorry. I've never seen these people. I'm sorry. You were saying something about a journey? It's not for you, but for someone close, perhaps a family member... My God. That's totally Luc. My sister-in-law's boyfriend, visa issues. Doe's that ring a bell? - I think you just rang it for her. - That would make sense, but before he leaves something else is coming. Don't tell her. This thing I see coming... It's a big, dark cloud. I can't tell you what it is, but it's going to bring turmoil and maybe... Even smoke. Smoke? I thought psychics only brought good news. That's a fortune cookie. But for what it's worth, I am sensing new life. Like a baby? What? That's what we're here for. Now that I know what it is, yes, it's a baby. Kevin, did you hear that? I was just about to get you that sales report. Actually, could I ask you a question? Do you remember that meeting last month where I kind of flipped out - because... - your nonfat dry cap wasn't very dry? PMS. Do you remember when that was exactly? - March 11th. - Wow. You're good with dates. It was my birthday. Sorry. My God. Six weeks. I wish we could have lunch, but they've got me on this ridiculous schedule, I have to be back at the state department first thing in the morning. No, that's okay. It sounds worse than the campaign trail. I hear you've got a good shot at the primary. Ann, I need a favor. If you're looking to secure more RNC funding, - I've already targeted you... - No, actually, it's about Robert. What about him? I'm guessing that you know that he was tapped for a high-level appointment concerning national security. And... He went through the whole process, and they practically told him that he had the job, and then at the last minute, they rejected him because of some leftover scar tissue from his heart surgery and... - Right. - Wait a minute. Did you hear something different? If that's what Robert told you, then he's in the best position to know. If he is interested in a think tank or a seat on the board... Please don't change the subject. What is going on? Look, all I'm gonna say is that there are plenty of people in worse health than Robert at the highest levels. A little scar tissue isn't usually a deal breaker. I'm sorry. I have a car waiting. You did this. You killed the job. You had me blackballed. Look, if you'd taken that appointment, you'd have been gagged. You'd take an oath of silence and never be able to help us. We couldn't let that happen. There are plenty of people who could help you do this. You know you're the perfect candidate. Even if I wanted to, my wife is running for senate. There's no way that I'm gonna jeopardize... Your loyalty is admirable. Family is important, but your country needs you. - My country? - Yes. Your country. Joe, find someone else. {\***pub***}200 bucks down the drain, and I still don't feel distracted. {\pos(192,220)}But you should be relieved. Kevin, we're totally pregnant. {\pos(192,220)}What, is that based on the tenderness of my breasts? {\pos(192,220)}She was dead-on about a lot of things. Luc... {\pos(192,220)}- cause you told her about Luc. - She said "journey" first. {\pos(192,220)}And then there was that whole thing about new life. {\pos(192,220)}And could she have been any more generic? My God. The wicked witch of the west is in town. - Who? - Grandma. She's gonna be at mom's.{\ tonight.} Wait. Ida's here? She's the dark force. She's totally the dark force bringing turmoil. Ida's cranky, okay? A dark force? Kind of a stretch. - Smoke... What was that about? - Clouds. We could paint clouds on the ceiling of the nursery. I don't think predictions count if you make them come true. Plus, we don't have a nursery. Kevin, I just want to believe. So... Are you all set here? All set. There's nothing else that you need? That's what is meant by "all set." You know, mom... You really could come with me. I'm just shopping for dinner, and it would be like old times. Remember when we used to shop at Hannigan's and we used to sample all the candies? Don't patronize me. If you're afraid that I'm gonna wander out in the street and get hit by another bus, just say so. I really wasn't patronizing you. It would be nice to have your company. We could spend some time together. Were you planning on carrying me around the market or do I just sit in the car with bingo? Bingo died. I had no idea. When? Just, you know, a little while ago. Listen to me. I would really, really like you to come with me. I'd rather not miss my programs. So you have my cell phone number. Okay. What time should I feed bingo? Go shopping. It was a joke. Good. Hello? - What's going on? - Not much. Just thought about emptying the trash. Actually, you really should be getting ready, because we shouldn't be late tonight. Grandma's coming. Did I tell you that? Have you met Ida? Don't be crazy. {\Of course}You haven't. What am I talking about? - What? - You're so nervous. Yeah, a little bit. But I'm holding it together. Babe, I'm gonna call you every night. It would be lunchtime for you. That way we can have lunch together. You know people do move on with their lives. I'm worried we might get distracted. No, I'm not gonna get distracted. Do you remember when we met the first time? You just appeared on my doorstep. Come on. We're meant to be together. Let's make the most of the time we have left? No. You know what? Sex is not always the answer. It can have very serious ramifications. - What? - Come on, I shouldn't really have to explain to you... The birds and the bees, kids. Kids. What do you mean? Do you want to have a baby? - No. Why? Do you? - I don't know. I'm leaving in a day. - I don't think it's really practical... - Exactly. You're leaving tomorrow. It's not practical. You should go get ready for dinner. I take out the trash. No, I'll get it. Got it. Let me take out the trash. Please. I'm here one more day. Could you please stop saying that? Let me take out the trash, then. God. Mom? {\***pub***} - Thank you. - No problem. Thank you so much. I promise I'll be careful next time. Never let it happen again. {\pos(192,220)}You could have told them I did it. {\pos(192,220)}I don't think they would have locked me up. No, mother, it's not your fault. You did turn the burner on and walk away, but I should not leave so much stuff around. This could have happened to anyone. Fine. We'll play it your way. Ah, jeez! Just don't say it. Don't say it. Don't say it. We're fine. Everyone is fine. We needn't change our plans. You couldn't call me? I had to hear it from Sarah? I knew you were coming over for dinner tonight. - It's not like I'm keeping it a secret. - I'm just glad everything's okay and the house is still standing. Mommy, you okay? I'm peachy. It was her fault. We're having pizza tonight. Was there a fire? Everybody's okay. - It's true. - Everybody's safe. It's fine. - So there was smoke. - Can you smell that? I love you. It's true. It's really true. Excuse me. Is there something wrong with the two of you? No, we're just glad everyone's okay. Is there a chip or something? I'm just checking to see if it's the same company that we registered for. I've been obsessed with dinnerware. We've received so many wedding gifts, we've no idea where to{\we're gonna}put everything. Buy a house. You're married. That's what people do. Actually, there is this one house that we love. I didn't know med school paid so well. We're not actually in the market. Who knows? If things turn around with Ojaï. But I mean, we love our apartment. Don't get me wrong. There's plenty of room. Our place is tiny, and we're adding a baby to the mix. - You've heard? Did you hear something? - No. I just meant at some point. And hopefully, the fates are with us. Sarah, you okay? I'm just... - Gonna get wine for the table. - There's a bottle right here. I was so sorry to hear about bingo. Your dog. Your mother mentioned that he passed recently. Grandma... Bingo passed away about 20 years ago. I didn't say it was yesterday. No, you said "recently." Why, so that I would feel better? I don't know. Is that such a bad thing? No, of course not, dear. It's one of the wonderful things about you. - You're such a pleaser. - Mom, come on. Like taking blame for the fire that I caused. Mother, look, everyone is safe. No one got hurt. It doesn't matter whose fault it was. It matters to me, damn it. - Hello? - Kitty, come in here. Did you take the test? I bought the test, but then Luc came home. I had to throw it in the trash. {\Wait a minute.}Are you telling me that Luc doesn't know? - You have to tell him. - Tell him what? What's there to tell? There's nothing to tell. Even if there was, - he's leaving tomorrow. - I am here to tell you that this is not something that you should be keeping from your partner. You are in a committed relationship. You don't keep secrets from each other. No wonder you think the long-distance thing isn't gonna work. I might be hormonal, but it feels like you're being really mean to me. - He's French. I have two kids. - I know. I'm sorry. It's not you, okay? It's not you. It's me. It's me. I went to see this woman today... to confront her about why Robert didn't get the job. You went to see Ann Waterman? Have you been eavesdropping outside that door? - A little. At the end. - Wait a minute. Did Robert ever tell you anything about some sort of job in intelligence? The job? The big secret job? God, yeah. What about it? I went to see Ann Waterman today, because I wanted to talk to her about how I thought it was discrimination that Robert didn't get the job cause of his heart surgery, she looked at me like I was crazy. Meaning? I think there's another reason why Robert didn't get the job. You think there's a scandal that you don't know about? Let's just turn the dial down on the drama queen. - Maybe he was embarrassed. - You know him. He doesn't get embarrassed. He wasn't born with the ability to get - What? - Can we not talk about birth, please? Right. Right. Sorry. Sorry. Has Scotty said something to you two? About what? My God. Are you pregnant, too? What do you mean, "too"? Who else is pregnant? I don't know. - Who's pregnant? - Nobody I never said anybody's pregnant You said "too." "Too" implies somebody else is pregnant. It was... I meant "boo." So who's the first person? Kevin? - What? - Are you pregnant? We went to a psychic, and she predicted a "new life." But maybe that new life isn't ours. Maybe it's one of yours. So tell me, is it? Is it? Is one of you pregnant? So the birds and the bees... You were serious? It is you. - Maybe. I don't know. - But it might be? - That would be amazing. - It's not amazing. It's not amazing. You're leaving tomorrow. And we were careful. We were really, really careful. - I thought we were. - You thought you were being careful? - What {\the hell}is your problem? - Are we okay in here? No, we're not. The new life? - It's her. It's Sarah. - What? She stole our baby. You're... - Ma, you want some more salad? - Bye, mom! Bye, gram! - What, is Kevin leaving? - It sounded like that. - Excuse me. - What's going on? Nothing. Thank you for the dinner. We just really have to go. You guys aren't leaving, too. Justin's getting the ice cream. The sitter... We have to relieve her. I thought the kids were with their father this weekend. - Right. Good night. - Good night. I'm gonna find out what's going on. I honestly don't know where that instinct comes from. What instinct is that? The one that tells you that you have to fix everything. Who knows what's going on out there? They're adults. If they need you, they'll ask you. Come on. It's perfectly understandable for Nora to want to find out - what's happening. - I'm sorry, if I don't do things the way you did. I just want to be there for my children, that's all. You're right. We've always done things differently. Can we not do this now, please? We're going to do this now. I don't want to live in this house with you for the next ten years of my life. There's a place called fair willows. - We've been over this. - You have been over this. Allow me the dignity to make my own choices. Allow me that, before it's too late. {\***pub***}Please, don't try and get my hopes up again. You should have left me to my blogs and {\pos(192,220)}my "dreams of motherhood" forums full of ectopic pregnancies, BFN's {\pos(192,220)}and people just acknowledging what a huge miracle it is to get pregnant. {\pos(192,220)}At least that way, I'd have been able to manage my expectations {\pos(192,220)}wrap my head around the disappointment. {\pos(192,220)}{ o,}You wouldn't have. Even if she turns out not to be pregnant, Ms. Nadine or no Ms. Nadine, it's still going to hurt. There's no way to soften that blow. I don't think I can handle it without it being softened. Yes, you can, because I will be right here with you. Maybe this is just a sign that it's not meant to be. You're trying to soften again. If we really wanna be parents, maybe we could get that still leaves us two directions. Just stop! Stop the vehicle! - What's going on? - Is everyone all right? We have no communication with anybody. - I'll talk to them. - Did you see anything out of the ordinary? Hello! Please stop! Excuse me. Who's Joey? Oh, it's no one. Any luck? I can't get Julian on his cell phone. I'm sure he'll be all right. They'll be okay. Has anyone seen any other people on the roads? Maybe he's on to something. - What are you talking about? - I don't know. Why did it start in parks? It's the same story. About eight, nine miles back. They say there's a bus in a lake. Five miles back. There were dozens of bodies. Okay. Nobody's going anywhere. We're gonna stay right here for a while. There's a woman talking to her daughter. She's talking to her daughter in Princeton. Isn't that where your friend went? Come on. It's okay. Honey, it's okay. She's so scared. You just stay in that room. You don't open the door for nothing. Just keep watching out the window with the tree, baby. Someone will come and get you soon. Tell her not to go near the window with the tree. Just tell her. Baby, don't go near the window with the tree. Ask her if Princeton's been affected. Honey, someone wants to know if Princeton's had any problems. She says everyone's dead outside. You just stay in your room. Honey? Honey, you're talking funny. What's wrong with you? - What do you mean? Everyone's dead? - What? Stacy... Stacy, you're scaring me. I don't understand what you're saying. What, baby? She's just not making any sense. Calculus. I see in calculus. Calculus. - Stacy! - Calculus. Stacy! Stacy Ann! Oh, my God. - I hear wind from outside. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stacy, Stacy, Stacy. Oh, no! We're going to go back to the car, okay, Jess? If we went down that road, where would that take us? I walked down a quarter mile, it was clean. I can't tell you what's after that, but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing. - Quarter mile? - That's not enough. Hey, it's better than going back the other way. Get a battle plan. Everybody makes a clean break. Elliot's resilient, isn't he? Yeah. He never gives up. You know, plants have the ability to target specific threats. Tobacco plants, when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars will send out a chemical attracting wasps to kill just those caterpillars. We don't know how plants attain these abilities. They just evolve very rapidly. Which species do you think is doing it if you think it's true? Plants have the ability to communicate with other species of plants. Trees can communicate with bushes, bushes with grass and everything in between. The radio says these attacks started happening in the cities then went to the towns and now the roads. That's right. Whatever's happening is happening to smaller and smaller populations. So we shouldn't be on the roads, then. The terrorists, or whatever could be watching the roads. I don't have any reason to disagree right now. We are in the area of attack. If you can't find a way through the area of attack we are told to find a safe zone within the area being attacked. They're attacking populations. We need to go where there aren't that many people. Where people don't travel. Now this is Mr. Collins. He's a realtor that works in this area. If we go west, we'll hit a county called Arundell. It's not on that map. It would only be on local maps. Dirt roads. Hardly anybody lives out there. There's no significant population there. That's our safe zone. We wait it out there till it's over. Is everyone in agreement? We should go into two groups. Those that are ready to go right now and those that need to get things from their cars. We need to stay in groups. Stay together. We'll go soon, honey. We'll go soon. Maybe we should've waited for the rest of them, stayed in a big group, like the Private said. Your phone's out, too? What's wrong? Okay. I was going to tell you, okay? There was this guy, Joey. His name is Joey. He's at work. We went out and we had dessert. I went out and I had dessert with him when I told you I worked late. And I didn't work late. I'm feeling really guilty in case we're gonna die. I just wanted you to know that. You lied to me? - How much farther is it? - I don't know. - We need to keep going forward. - Who the hell made you boss? Look, if y'all follow him, y'all gonna die. You follow me, you're gonna live. I'm in charge of this group! Ain't nobody else in charge of this group! My firearm is my friend! It will not leave my side! Private Auster? My firearm is my friend. Jesus. Oh, no. What, "Oh, no"? The toxin? The toxin is affecting them? Are those people killing themselves? You were with the Private. What do we do? - We need to do something! - Just let me think. - They're dying! - I need a second. They released it? We're not near the roads. We can't just stand here as uninvolved observers! I need a second, okay. Just give me a second! We are not going to be one of those assholes on the news who watches a crime happen and not do something! - We're not assholes! - Just a second! There were children in that group! - Elliot, please tell us what to do. - I need a second, okay! Why can't anybody give me a goddamn second? All right, be scientific, douchebag. Identify the variables. That's the two groups. Design an experiment. That's what we're in. Careful observation and measurements. That's what I'm trying to do. Interpret the experimental data. Interpret. What if it is the plants? Their group was larger than ours. This thing has been escalating all day. Smaller and smaller populations have been setting this off. They react to human stimulus. Maybe people are setting off the plants? What are you saying? That guy was crazy. We have to save them. They're already dead. What if they're targeting us as threats? This part of the field may not have been set off. Something in this field could be releasing the chemical into the air when there's too many of us together. Let's just stay ahead of the wind. Let's just break up into groups. Come on! Come on! This way! Come on, follow me! I'm right here! Keep going! I'm right behind you! Here it comes! Don't you let go of my hand. Nothing happened. It's the size of the groups, I think. Could this really be happening? What are your names? - Jared. - Josh. Wait, wait! I'm going to go see if that truck has a map. You guys wait here. Why aren't they looking into nuclear power plants? There are 15 or more in the Northeast alone. More than anywhere else in the United States. There's probably been some leak or something. It's probably poisoning the air. There's a house over there! Come on! It could have been some terrorist booby-trap, someone stepped on it out in the field. Yeah, in a field in Bumbletown, Pennsylvania. I don't know. Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air. They're only potent in a certain density. The source had to be close to that field, if not in the field. Here's one. Plants have the chemistry to do this. They release co-transporters into the air. You think it could be plants? I don't know. But if it is, and people are setting it off in groups, we need to go to the least populated place we can to be safe. We can't walk to the borders where this isn't happening, Alma. It's too far. Whatever it is, terrorists, a nuclear leak, plants, it's probably safe to get away from people right now. That must be Arundell. It's 10 miles from here. Okay, this place must have a bathroom. I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave. Hurry. Hello? My name is Elliot Moore. I'm just going to talk in a very positive manner. Giving off good vibes. We're just here to use the bathroom and then we're just gonna leave. I hope that's okay. Plastic. I'm talking to a plastic plant. I'm still doing it. You guys ready to leave? These people must have left in a hurry. I mean, leaving the front door unlocked? Hey, everything's fake. Why is this happening? I don't know for sure, Josh. But I read this article about the coast of Australia. It said they found large quantities of a primordial bacteria. It hadn't been around for billions of years, it just appeared in the water. It's toxic to humans, fishermen who come in contact with it are dying. It feels kind of similar to that. With the bees disappearing, I mean, I don't know, it feels like a pattern. The nature of events like the one in Australia is that they crest and then stop. We just have to be alive when it's over. I don't believe it's nature. It may not be. There could be some other explanation. I don't know. Let's go. There are people coming! We can't stay here. It's close to the roads. More and more people will come here. There's two groups coming together. There's too many of them together. Run. Run. - Is she your kid? - No. - You got kids? - No. How come? You got a problem? No. She wanted to wait. Really? For what? Me to grow up. Why are we talking about this? Sweet. I used to love those. Can I see it? You need to take personal responsibility for yourself in a relationship. - That'll make a difference. - Okay. Thank you. Hey, that's not a toy. It's got meaning to me. - Elliot! Look! - Come on. Oh, wow. ...is an emergency broadcast. All those who are still inside the affected area of the Northeast are asked to proceed to the police borders west of your state. Come on. This is an emergency broadcast. ...inside the affected area... Jess needs a 10-minute rest and some food. Are you sure? We should keep going. I know, but she's only eight. What? If we're going to die, I want you to know something. I was in the pharmacy a while ago, and there was a really good-looking pharmacist behind the counter. Really good-looking. And I went up and I asked her where the cough syrup was. I didn't even have a cough. And I almost bought it. And I'm talking about a completely superfluous bottle of cough syrup. That's like six bucks. Are you joking? Thank you. - Maybe that's not a good idea. - I told her just for a minute. Mr. Moore, I think I can open this door. Wait. We're a gang now? We're gonna take whatever we want? - Come on, guys. - Listen, nobody's home. We're just gonna get some food for Jess. Yeah, and it looks like nobody's lived here for a long time anyway. I mean, it's all boarded up. Maybe we could leave some money. - What kind of tree is this? - I think it's a maple. Not so high. Okay, Josh, open the door. Wait! I see something. - There's somebody in there! - You sure? Yeah, I saw him move. I see him! Let's stop. Is there any way we could get some food? We have a little girl. - We just want to get her some food. - You best leave now. You ain't gonna bring that poison gas in here with you. Sir, it's not poison gas. There's none out here. - They said to stay inside. - We're fine right now. Nothing's happened out here yet. I mean, you can see that. Just listen to our voices. We're perfectly normal. Old black water, keep on rolling Mississippi moon Won't you keep on shining on me? See? We're normal. You ain't from around here. You'd best leave now. Okay. It's not worth it. Open the door, bitch! Hey, Josh, don't do that. He didn't mean that! - There's more than one in there. - Jess! Jess, come here. Stop it, Jess. Listen, we just want some food for a little girl, you pussies! - Jess, come here. - Josh, stop it. You'd best not let that gas in here. Sir, the air is fine out here right now. You don't need to worry. - You might be with the terrorists! - I don't think it's terrorists, sir. - Josh, stop it! - They're being crazy, Mr. Moore! - Show your faces! - Let the gas in... No! Jared! We're gonna get out of this nightmare. Elliot! We have to go. We have to protect Jess. Okay? You've got to three to get off our porch! Come here. No new people have crossed over the border for a few hours. It appears those residents that are still in the affected area of the Northeast are trying to wait it out. We have Professor Kendel Wallace of Carnegie Mellon, a statistician, here with us. Professor, what can you tell us? Calculating by the rise in intensity of reports of incidents within the affected area, one can guess at a crude timetable. One can see the incident is rising in sensitivity. We've seen fewer and fewer people can provoke the attacks. The event should be at its most sensitive tomorrow morning. Typically, these type of slopes drop precipitously after cresting, meaning it could end suddenly, at any moment. Of course, these are only probabilities. There are some quiet rumblings that the government may be involved in the tragic events playing out in the Northeast. Now, these rumors have been fuelled by the statements of a confidential informant who claims that the CIA has facilities in the Northeast, where they are testing drugs with some similar psychotropic properties as a defense against chemical weapons. CIA and White House officials have declined to respond to these accusations. Perimeters have been set up all along the East Coast from Maryland all the way to Massachusetts. This house has no power going to it. Nobody's driven on this driveway for a long time, either. Let me go. You guys stay right here. That's for Clement. He's a retriever. You lost? You must be. There ain't nothing around here for miles. Why are you eyeing my lemon drink? I suppose the kind thing for me to do is to offer you supper. I ain't gonna ask you again. I hope the meal was sufficient. I wasn't expecting guests. This is a beautiful place. There's a springhouse in the back. They used to hide people from slave chasers back there. It has a speaking tube running under the ground to the main house. You can hear each other like you were in the same room. So, what's with you two? Who's chasing who? I'm sorry? Ain't no time two people staring at each other, standing still, love in both their eyes, at the same time, equal. Truth is, someone is chasing someone. That's the way we's built. So? Who's chasing? I knew that. I knew that. Don't touch things that aren't yours. - Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones? - No. I got enough to fill my time right here. I mend my own things. I grow my own food. Although I ain't got the touch. Gardens don't grow the way they should. Never have. - How do you stay in contact with others? - I don't. How would you know if something were to happen? Like a world event? Mrs. Jones, something's happened along the East Coast. Whatever it is that you think is so important that you need to tell me, don't. Just keep it to yourself. The world don't care about me. I don't care about it. Suppose I have to let you spend the night. Guest room's up on the left. Mind the steps. I'm scared, Elliot. It's okay. I'm sorry about everything. That Joey thing. I was being stupid. You've been great taking care of Jess. I don't like this woman. There's something Exorcist-y about her. How could she hit Jess like that? Well, we need to stay in this house. You want me to protect you, this is how we have to do it. Let's just deal with her. I hear you whispering. Planning on stealing something? No, ma'am, we're not. Plan on murdering me in my sleep? What? No! Mrs. Jones? Mrs. Jones? Crazy lady. You trying to steal my things? No! No, Mrs. Jones, I actually wanted to talk with you. - You all are gonna leave right now! - Ma'am, you don't understand. There's something happening in a few states, in this region. - It's not safe! - Leave now! The Lord is my shepherd. The Lord is my shepherd. Mrs. Jones, could we talk calmly for a second? Just hear me out. See, I'm a teacher... Mrs. Jones? Oh, my God. Alma, shut the windows and the doors! Alma? Alma? Alma? Jess? Hi, froggie! Hi, froggie! Okay, yeah. Wait. How old do you think he is? Is he a baby? I think he's a baby. He's so tiny. I didn't know frogs could be like that. Oh, he got water on my shoe. Isn't this a cool house? If we had this house, we could make it look so pretty. Get him again. Get him again. Hey, froggie. Alma? Good morning, Elliot. Sounds like you're right here. - Close the windows and the doors, Alma. - Why? Mrs. Jones just died. Close the windows. Close the door, Jess! - Is everything closed? - Yes. - I'm sorry, Alma. - What's going on, Elliot? It's happening here. It could be the grass and the trees are doing this now. She was alone when it happened. Seems like they might have gotten more sensitive. It's too dangerous to go outside, isn't it? Yes. This is the end, isn't it? I wish you were here. Me, too. You remember our first date? You were so quiet. You bought me the mood ring. It turned purple when you wore it. Then you said, "That means you're in love." It got you to talk, didn't it? Then we checked the little paper chart, and it turned out that purple meant I was horny. - You loved that. - I had no idea. Yours was blue. Peaceful, right? Right. What color was love? I don't remember. Me, neither. Elliot? Yeah? I was just making sure you're there. It's not right for it to end like this. If we're gonna die, I want to be with you. I want to be with you, and I'm gonna come and be with you. Elliot, don't! The event must have ended before we went out there. I found the hair clip! You don't want to be late for the first day schools are open. Oh, wait. I'm just gonna put this right here. Okay? - Are you okay? - Yes, Aunt Alma. I love you. I love you, too. Come here. All right. I'll pick you up after you're done with school, okay? Bye. As everyone knows by now, traces of the neurotoxin have been found in some plants and trees. Now, most environmentalists feel that this event is like the red tide in the ocean, but instead of algae killing fish, this happened on land. Now, plants and trees just can't pick up and move when they feel threatened, like other species. They have only one option, to rapidly evolve their chemistry. Well. Kay from Mississippi wants to know why it started so suddenly, on a Tuesday at 8:33 and then ended so suddenly at 9:27 the next morning. Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest, this was an act of nature, and we'll never fully understand it. And, Doctor, there's been a lot of speculation as to why this happened in the Northeast only. How do you explain that? Well, I believe, all right, and this is just my opinion, that this was a prelude, okay? A warning, like the first spot of a rash. We have become a threat to this planet. I don't think anybody will argue that. - And this is a warning. - A warning? I think the skeptics would believe that if it had occurred anywhere else. That's why most people believe it was the government. If it had happened in one other place, anywhere else, we could all believe what you're saying. I should drop my bicycle off at the apartment before I go to work. Can you make Nadia's party tonight? I should drop my bicycle off at the apartment before I go to work. That frightened me. I should drop my bicycle off What? My God... My bicycle. I forgot where I am. You're at the place where the killers meet to decide what to do with the crippled girl. Oh, that's right. That's right. Did you hear that? That's funny. That's weird. Those people look like they're clawing at themselves. Is that blood? claire, are you seeing this? claire. claire? claire? What page was I on? Page. -I need an extension over here. -FaII back. fall back. You kidding me? Like another 20 feet. Don't touch that. That's for the drywall guys. I told you he wouldn't do it! So then the little guy says, "You have a girlfriend named Wendy, too? well, I saw your thing and it said 'WY."' The big guy says, "No, man, mine says, 'WeIcome to Jamaica, have a nice day."' Christ, McKenzie fell. Medic, we have a major accident at the south side of the building. -We'II need an ambulance. Copy. Jesus. Give him some room. -Hey! -Somebody fell! -Davis? -Oh, my God, he just fell! Someone fell! Over that building! Oh, my God! -Watch it. -Oh, my God! Watch it. Get out of there! -help! -Look out! Look out! God in heaven. Look, I don't know if you guys have heard about this article in The New York Times about honeybees vanishing? well, apparently, honeybees are disappearing all over the country. Tens of millions of them. Just disappearing. There's no bodies, no sign of them. They're just mysteriously gone. It's scary, huh? AII right, Iet's hear some theories about why this might be happening. Nothing? Come on, guys. -Laura. -Disease? Right. could be a virus or infection. But it's all over the country. It's a coordinated event in 24 states. It's a little tricky. -pollution? -could be. I mean, we're just pumping so much junk into the environment they're just keeIing over. But there are no bodies. Keep guessing. dylan. global warming. Temperature goes up a fraction of a degree, makes them disoriented? Maybe. Jake? You don't have an opinion? You're not interested in what happened to the bees? You should be more interested in science, Jake. You know why? Because your face is perfect. The problem is, your face is perfect at 15. Now, if you were interested in science, you would know facts like the human nose and ears grow a fraction of an inch each year. So a perfect balance of features now might not look so perfect five years from now. They might look downright whack 10 years from now. Come on, buddy. Take an interest in science. What could be a reason the bees have vanished? An act of nature and we'II never fully understand it. Nice answer, Jake. He's right. I mean, science will come up with some reason to put in the books, but in the end, it'II be just a theory. We will faiI to acknowledge that there are forces at work beyond our understanding. To be a good scientist, you must have a respectful awe for the laws of nature. Jake? How much does the human nose grow each year? -Oh, man. -It's minuscule, buddy, okay? Don't worry about it. You're gonna be a heartthrob your whole life. I was just messing with you. The Dark Lord. Don't look into her eyes. Vice principal! What can we do for you? I'm afraid I have to interrupt you for a moment, Mr. Moore. Okay, guys, calm down. I'II be right back. -What is that? -I can't believe it. -Oh, my God. -Oh, my God. -I've never seen anything like it before. -What's going on? I don't know. You excused all the teachers? The administration makes us teach with a foot of snow on the ground. What is this? -They stopped class. -elliot! AII right. There appears to be an event happening. central Park was just hit by what seems to be a terrorist attack. Oh, no. They're not clear on the scale yet. It's some kind of airborne chemical toxin that's been released in and around the park. They said to watch for warning signs. The first stage is confused speech. The second stage is physical disorientation, loss of direction. The third stage is fatal. central Park? That's kind of odd. I spoke with the head of schools. He said we should dismiss the students. So take your planners home so we can get back when this is over. AII right? Let's do our jobs. Hey, you guys still got to work on your science projects for next week. What are the rules of scientific investigation? Identify variables. Design the experiment. careful observation and measurement. Interpretation of experimental data. Hey, guys? Nothing. AIacrity. With alacrity, please. My mother just called my cell again. She's hysterical. hysterical. I told her the probability of something happening in philadelphia is very low. I mean, nobody's telling us to leave the city, right? So I threw some figures at her. It's good to be a math teacher sometimes. You know, people are comforted by percentages. Didn't work. She still wants us to get out of the city and come out to her house. But she said for you and alma to come. Yeah, Iet me think about that, okay? Did you hear about New York? Are you okay? No, I mean, are you okay? Yeah, me, too. Listen, I want to talk about it more. julian's mom offered for all of us to get out of the city and stay with her. What do you think? Yo, Chris! I'II bring Jess and Evette and I'II meet you at the station. Listen, julian, if alma's acting weird, just be cool, okay? What's going on? She's acting odd. Just don't worry about it, okay? Odd? Look, if she's acting like she's distant or something... What? I can't say any more. Is she leaving you? I didn't say that. It's just talk, okay? Just relax, please? Hey. I'm going to tell you something you should never tell your best friend. Why is everybody saying that? I saw her on your wedding day. Again with the wedding. What? I walked into a waiting room by mistake, and she was crying. She looked up. I saw her face. She wasn't ready to jump in, elliot. That's not who she is. She's never going to jump in when you need her, man. So do federal. state and local officials have a plan in place for this type of catastrophe? Are they utilizing all the manpower or the money... -Hi. -Are you packed? -Yes. -What are they saying? They're evacuating New York City. Well. our brains come equipped with a selfpreservation mechanism to stop us from harmful actions. This is controlled by a combination of electrochemical signals in the brain. The blocking of neurotransmitters by certain toxins has been proven to cause hallucinations. asphyxiation and paralysis. This new neurotoxin is basically flipping the preservation switch. blocking neurotransmitters in a specific order. causing specific selfdamaging and catastrophic effects. Just how the toxin works and who the terrorists are... It makes you kill yourself. Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that could be invented. I'II be packed in two minutes. Hello? -No need to rush. -Sir. Thank you. Sir, we need to check your suitcase. elliot! elliot! elliot! This just in to the Eyewitness News room and this is the latest development. Autopsies on the first victims confirm the toxin is a natural compound. The attacks remain confined to the New York metropolitan area. This is a very. very disturbing story... Track three now boarding for Harrisburg. Hey, Jess. Where's Evette? She was at a shop across town, she got stuck in traffic. -She's gonna take the next train. -We'II wait. No, no, no. She wanted us to get on this train with Jess. She'II feel a Iot safer. -Where's alma? -Restroom. Hey, julian! please have your tickets out and ready, ladies and gentlemen. I bought them. It was like getting one of those Cabbage Patch dolls when they first came out. Madhouse. How are you? -Good. You? -Good. -Okay, good. Why don't we all... -I'm really glad you chose to come. Thanks. elliot, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. please show me your tickets, ladies and gentlemen. -You told him about our fight? -No. -Why did he say that? -He guessed. I Iove you, elliot, but I don't like to put my feelings out there for everyone to see. I'm not that type of person. elliot, these are our problems. I am upset. I'm going to sit alone and cool off. By the time we get there I'II be fine. Is that okay? Fine. I'm going to get on the train. We're not gonna get to sit together anyways. Okay. Hey, babe. -Hi, Aunt alma. -How you doing? -Hanging in there. -Me, too. -What's wrong with you? -What? You're wrong about her. She just needs time to figure it out. Come on, don't get all sensitive. -Just give her a chance. -Okay, fine. If you don't want my help... -I don't want your help! -Okay. I heard it. Jess, could you ask your dad for my ticket, please? Thank you. I'II see you on the train, Jess. Track 3 now boarding all ticketed passengers. Here we go. When will Mom meet us at Grandma's? Mommy's gonna get on the next train. You know how she's always late. -Come on. Come on. I know. I know. -Mom. -chilly, isn't it today, sal? -Maybe a little. Hey, it's me. I'm on a train. I just want to say something, okay? You've got to stop calling me. You're acting like the Fatal Attraction guy, here. I feel like I'm going to take a shower and see your silhouette on the shower curtain. We ate tiramisu together, that is it. I told you that would be it. You have got to chill out. What? When? In philadelphia? -I don't know. What did you hear? -Oh, my God. I can't believe it. What's the news? apparently philadelphia was just attacked. -Oh, my God. Evette. -call Mommy. call Mommy! Honey! Honey... Yeah, yeah, where are you? What? What? I can't hear you. I said I can't hear you! Text me. Text me. I can't hear you! They think it started in Rittenhouse Square Park. Another park? -She got on a bus going to New Jersey. -I want to talk to her. I know, baby. I know. She got out. She's headed to the town of Princeton. I want to talk to her. -Do you have a phone? -No, I'm sorry. -You okay? -They say Boston got hit, too. -Where'd you hear that? -A friend from work. What about Evette? Oh, God. She made it out on a bus. What the hell is going on, elliot? I honestly don't know. Now what? It just stopped. I don't know. -Can't go nowhere. -They're not telling us anything. -well, until we hear from... -Sir? Train service has been discontinued. This will be the Iast stop for all passengers. Hey! What do you mean? Where are we? FiIbert, pennsylvania. FiIbert? Does anybody know where that is? Why are you giving me one useless piece of information at a time? What's going on? Hey, why would you just stop? You can't just leave us here. Sir, we lost contact. With whom? Everyone. I'm scared. I don't like it here. I want Mom. Don't be silly. We're safe here, okay? Sorry. She whispers to us when she gets scared. We're so much the same, Jess. I don't like to show my emotions, either. She's shivering. I know. I know. She's never right without her mom. It's okay. They're not saying anything. We're stuck here. Is Jess okay? She's not talking. We're in a small town, Jess. Nothing will happen to us here. Don't know what you want? Then just have the grilled cheese plain with milk, okay? Come on, come over here. No, you know what? Why don't you stay here? Stay here, all right? You can see me from over there. What? AII right, you want to come with me? You can come with me and wait in line. You want to do that? Bro! Bro, I got it. Go get the milk. AII right, yeah. Okay. You know that everyone gives off energy, right? It's scientifically proven. They got these cameras that can record what color you are when you're feeling different things. people that are angry give off a different color than people that are sad. See this ring? This ring can supposedly tell you what you're feeling. Let's see what you're feeling right now. yellow! That's cool. That means you're about to laugh. I'm not making it up. That's what yellow means. You must be about to laugh or something. It's probably just about to come out. We'II wait. We got all day. Oh, my God. There it is! cool. That ring really works. That's amazing. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Look at this. My sister sent it to me. It was taken an hour ago at the philadelphia Zoo. Mother of God, what kind of terrorists are these? They're not sure it's terrorists now. Moments ago. in an official statement. the government moved away from its initial position that this was a terrorist attack. Authorities are now feeling. by the sheer number of incidents being reported. that a terrorist group being responsible is becoming less and less likely. The event appears to be limited to the Northeast. where smaller and smaller towns are being attacked. Where are we? The infected area now includes most of New England. from Massachusetts to Maryland. We're dead center. Everything okay? If we stay here, we are gonna die here. Whatever this is, it looks like it's not occurring about 90 miles from here. Let's go. Anyone got a car? Can anyone give us a ride? Hey! Excuse me, sir? Sir, could we get a ride, please? We don't have any transportation. We're stuck here. Sir, did you hear what I said? We don't have any transportation! -We have a little girl with us. please. -Drive. Just roll up the window. Sir! You're not just going to... Can you believe how crappy people are? There's a car. Hi. I run a plant nursery up the street. We're picking up a few things from home, then heading wherever this isn't happening. We have room. -We have two others. -That's okay. julian! Is julian okay? We got a ride. He can fit all of us. elliot, I can't get Evette on the phone or e-maiI or nothing. -How long? -It's been about two hours. She was on that bus headed to Princeton. There's a car over there headed to pick up friends and family, they said they could squeeze one more. We got to go. Look, think real carefully about this. She was looking for a birthday present for Jess. Some kind of dollhouse. That's why she wasn't with us. I'm just gonna go get her and I want to bring her back, and then I'm gonna find you guys. I just... I need you to take Jess, okay? She's gonna be a Iot safer with you. Don't do this to me. I'm doing my best here not to fall down. I'm sure the probability of Princeton not being hit is good. Yeah. You want me to throw some figures and percentages at you so we both feel better? -please. -AII right. 62% chance. 62% chance it hasn't even been hit. -well, you go get her, jules, okay? -Of course, man, of course. Come on. This is all some weird event, that's all. We're all gonna be fine. I'm gonna find you guys real soon. I have to go. I got her, julian. Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it. I'm going to go get Mommy. hold our picture. Take a look around. We'II be ready in a jiffy. We're packing hot dogs for the road. You know, hot dogs get a bad rap. They've got a cool shape, they've got protein. You like hot dogs, right? By the way, I think I know what's causing this. -You do? -It's the plants. They can release chemicals. You like hot dogs, don't you? Okay, babies, we are gonna be going, but we will be back soon, okay? Oh, plants react to human stimulus. They've proved it in tests. Did you get the mustard? Don't look outside. Stop it! Stop it! Just look at me! Just keep looking at me! close the vents. I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay? And you're gonna tell me the answer. What? How much would you have if I said I would pay you a penny on the first day and then two pennies on the second, and then four pennies on the third day and I just kept doubling it and I did this for a month? How much money would you have at the end of the month? -Ten dollars. -No, higher. Higher, higher. Just keep looking at me. Just keep looking at me. Twenty dollars? No, keep going. Keep going. Thirty. It's thirty. It's $30. I'm gonna tell you the answer. It's over $10 million. You'd have over $10 million at the end of the month. You want to hear another one? Water contamination has surfaced as one of the many theories being taken seriously as to the cause of the events in the Northeast. We have to go through this little community of homes. small town called HoIcomb, then we hit the highway. From there, we're 30 miles from the state line. Are those dead animals up ahead? Stop the car. -You don't think it's... -I don't know. You got binoculars in the back, from when you were spying on our neighbors. Can I have the map? elliot... Don't cause a panic, okay? Jess can hear you. It's bodies, isn't it? I knew it wouId be bodies. How could it not be bodies? please, give me the map. well, we have to turn around. There's a right turn about a quarter of a mile back. We're just gonna take a different route, honey, okay? Oh, it's the Army. We're safe! My name is Private Auster. I'm stationed at West Dover military Base, about 10 miles back. I think they've been affected by whatever's happening. I lost communication with them. When I approached the base, I saw military personnel in the barbed wire, in the fence. So I suggest no one take that road. There's a town about eight miles behind us. There were bodies on the road into town. Cheese and crackers. well, that still leaves us two directions. Just stop! Stop the vehicle! -What's going on? -Is everyone all right? We have no communication with anybody. -I'II talk to them. -Did you see anything out of the ordinary? hello! please stop! Excuse me. Who's Joey? Oh, it's no one. Any luck? I can't get julian on his cell phone. I'm sure he'II be all right. They'II be okay. Has anyone seen any other people on the roads? Maybe he's on to something. -What are you talking about? -I don't know. Why did it start in parks? It's the same story. About eight, nine miles back. They say there's a bus in a lake. Five miles back. There were dozens of bodies. Okay. Nobody's going anywhere. We're gonna stay right here for a while. There's a woman talking to her daughter. She's talking to her daughter in Princeton. Isn't that where your friend went? Come on. It's okay. Honey, it's okay. She's so scared. You just stay in that room. You don't open the door for nothing. Just keep watching out the window with the tree, baby. Someone will come and get you soon. tell her not to go near the window with the tree. Just tell her. Baby, don't go near the window with the tree. Ask her if Princeton's been affected. Honey, someone wants to know if Princeton's had any problems. She says everyone's dead outside. You just stay in your room. Honey? Honey, you're talking funny. What's wrong with you? -What do you mean? Everyone's dead? -What? Stacy... Stacy, you're scaring me. I don't understand what you're saying. What, baby? She's just not making any sense. Calculus. I see in calculus. Calculus. -Stacy! Calculus. Stacy! Stacy Ann! Oh, my God. -I hear wind from outside. -Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stacy, Stacy, Stacy. Oh, no! We're going to go back to the car, okay, Jess? If we went down that road, where would that take us? I walked down a quarter mile, it was clean. I can't tell you what's after that, but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing. -Quarter mile? -That's not enough. Hey, it's better than going back the other way. Get a battle plan. Everybody makes a clean break. elliot's resilient, isn't he? Yeah. He never gives up. You know, plants have the ability to target specific threats. Tobacco plants, when attacked by HeIiothis caterpillars will send out a chemical attracting wasps to kill just those caterpillars. We don't know how plants attain these abilities. They just evolve very rapidly. Which species do you think is doing it if you think it's true? plants have the ability to communicate with other species of plants. Trees can communicate with bushes, bushes with grass and everything in between. The radio says these attacks started happening in the cities then went to the towns and now the roads. That's right. Whatever's happening is happening to smaller and smaller populations. So we shouldn't be on the roads, then. The terrorists, or whatever could be watching the roads. I don't have any reason to disagree right now. We are in the area of attack. If you can't find a way through the area of attack we are told to find a safe zone within the area being attacked. They're attacking populations. We need to go where there aren't that many people. Where people don't travel. Now this is Mr. collins. He's a realtor that works in this area. If we go west, we'II hit a county called ArundeII. It's not on that map. It would only be on local maps. Dirt roads. hardly anybody lives out there. There's no significant population there. That's our safe zone. We wait it out there till it's over. Is everyone in agreement? We should go into two groups. Those that are ready to go right now and those that need to get things from their cars. We need to stay in groups. Stay together. We'II go soon, honey. We'II go soon. Maybe we should've waited for the rest of them, stayed in a big group, Iike the Private said. Your phone's out, too? What's wrong? Okay. I was going to tell you, okay? There was this guy, Joey. His name is Joey. He's at work. We went out and we had dessert. I went out and I had dessert with him when I told you I worked late. And I didn't work late. I'm feeling really guilty in case we're gonna die. I just wanted you to know that. You lied to me? -How much farther is it? -I don't know. -We need to keep going forward. -Who the hell made you boss? Look, if y'aII follow him, y'aII gonna die. You follow me, you're gonna live. I'm in charge of this group! Ain't nobody else in charge of this group! My firearm is my friend! It will not leave my side! Private Auster? My firearm is my friend. Jesus. Oh, no. What, "Oh, no"? The toxin? The toxin is affecting them? Are those people killing themselves? You were with the Private. What do we do? -We need to do something! -Just let me think. -They're dying! -I need a second. They released it? We're not near the roads. We can't just stand here as uninvolved observers! I need a second, okay. Just give me a second! We are not going to be one of those assholes on the news who watches a crime happen and not do something! -We're not assholes! -Just a second! There were children in that group! -elliot, please tell us what to do. -I need a second, okay! Why can't anybody give me a goddamn second? AII right, be scientific, douchebag. Identify the variables. That's the two groups. Design an experiment. That's what we're in. careful observation and measurements. That's what I'm trying to do. Interpret the experimental data. Interpret. What if it is the plants? Their group was larger than ours. This thing has been escalating all day. smaller and smaller populations have been setting this off. They react to human stimulus. Maybe people are setting off the plants? What are you saying? That guy was crazy. We have to save them. They're already dead. What if they're targeting us as threats? This part of the field may not have been set off. Something in this field could be releasing the chemical into the air when there's too many of us together. Let's just stay ahead of the wind. Let's just break up into groups. Come on! Come on! This way! Come on, follow me! I'm right here! Keep going! I'm right behind you! Here it comes! Don't you let go of my hand. Nothing happened. It's the size of the groups, I think. could this really be happening? What are your names? -Jared. -Josh. Wait, wait! I'm going to go see if that truck has a map. You guys wait here. Why aren't they looking into nuclear power plants? There are 15 or more in the Northeast alone. More than anywhere else in the United States. There's probably been some leak or something. It's probably poisoning the air. There's a house over there! Come on! It could have been some terrorist booby-trap, someone stepped on it out in the field. Yeah, in a field in BumbIetown, pennsylvania. I don't know. Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air. They're only potent in a certain density. The source had to be close to that field, if not in the field. Here's one. plants have the chemistry to do this. They release co-transporters into the air. You think it could be plants? I don't know. But if it is, and people are setting it off in groups, we need to go to the least populated place we can to be safe. We can't walk to the borders where this isn't happening, alma. It's too far. Whatever it is, terrorists, a nuclear leak, plants, it's probably safe to get away from people right now. That must be ArundeII. It's 10 miles from here. Okay, this place must have a bathroom. I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave. Hurry. hello? My name is EIIiot Moore. I'm just going to talk in a very positive manner. Giving off good vibes. We're just here to use the bathroom and then we're just gonna leave. I hope that's okay. plastic. I'm talking to a plastic plant. I'm still doing it. You guys ready to leave? These people must have left in a hurry. I mean, leaving the front door unlocked? Hey, everything's fake. Why is this happening? I don't know for sure, Josh. But I read this article about the coast of australia. It said they found large quantities of a primordial bacteria. It hadn't been around for billions of years, it just appeared in the water. It's toxic to humans, fishermen who come in contact with it are dying. It feels kind of similar to that. With the bees disappearing, I mean, I don't know, it feels like a pattern. The nature of events like the one in australia is that they crest and then stop. We just have to be alive when it's over. I don't believe it's nature. It may not be. There could be some other explanation. I don't know. Let's go. There are people coming! We can't stay here. It's close to the roads. More and more people will come here. There's two groups coming together. There's too many of them together. Run. Run. -Is she your kid? -No. -You got kids? -No. How come? You got a problem? No. She wanted to wait. really? For what? Me to grow up. Why are we talking about this? Sweet. I used to love those. Can I see it? You need to take personal responsibility for yourself in a relationship. -That'II make a difference. -Okay. Thank you. Hey, that's not a toy. It's got meaning to me. -elliot! Look! -Come on. Oh, wow. ...is an emergency broadcast. All those who are still inside the affected area of the Northeast are asked to proceed to the police borders west of your state. Come on. This is an emergency broadcast. ...inside the affected area... Jess needs a 10-minute rest and some food. Are you sure? We should keep going. I know, but she's only eight. What? If we're going to die, I want you to know something. I was in the pharmacy a while ago, and there was a really good-Iooking pharmacist behind the counter. really good-Iooking. And I went up and I asked her where the cough syrup was. I didn't even have a cough. And I almost bought it. And I'm talking about a completely superfluous bottle of cough syrup. That's like six bucks. Are you joking? Thank you. -Maybe that's not a good idea. -I told her just for a minute. Mr. Moore, I think I can open this door. Wait. We're a gang now? We're gonna take whatever we want? -Come on, guys. -Listen, nobody's home. We're just gonna get some food for Jess. Yeah, and it looks like nobody's lived here for a Iong time anyway. I mean, it's all boarded up. Maybe we could leave some money. -What kind of tree is this? -I think it's a maple. Not so high. Okay, Josh, open the door. Wait! I see something. -There's somebody in there! -You sure? Yeah, I saw him move. I see him ! Let's stop. Is there any way we could get some food? We have a little girl. -We just want to get her some food. -You best leave now. You ain't gonna bring that poison gas in here with you. Sir, it's not poison gas. There's none out here. -They said to stay inside. -We're fine right now. Nothing's happened out here yet. I mean, you can see that. Just listen to our voices. We're perfectly normal. Old black water. keep on rolling Mississippi moon Won't you keep on shining on me? See? We're normal. You ain't from around here. You'd best leave now. Okay. It's not worth it. Open the door, bitch! Hey, Josh, don't do that. He didn't mean that! -There's more than one in there. -Jess! Jess, come here. Stop it, Jess. Listen, we just want some food for a little girl, you pussies! -Jess, come here. -Josh, stop it. You'd best not let that gas in here. Sir, the air is fine out here right now. You don't need to worry. -You might be with the terrorists! -I don't think it's terrorists, sir. -Josh, stop it! -They're being crazy, Mr. Moore! -Show your faces! -Let the gas in... No! Jared! We're gonna get out of this nightmare. elliot! We have to go. We have to protect Jess. Okay? You've got to three to get off our porch! Come here. No new people have crossed over the border for a few hours. It appears those residents that are still in the affected area of the Northeast are trying to wait it out. We have Professor Kendel Wallace of Carnegie Mellon. a statistician. here with us. Professor. what can you tell us? Calculating by the rise in intensity of reports of incidents within the affected area. one can guess at a crude timetable. One can see the incident is rising in sensitivity. We've seen fewer and fewer people can provoke the attacks. The event should be at its most sensitive tomorrow morning. Typically. these type of slopes drop precipitously after cresting. meaning it could end suddenly. at any moment. Of course. these are only probabilities. There are some quiet rumblings that the government may be involved in the tragic events playing out in the Northeast. Now. these rumors have been fuelled by the statements of a confidential informant who claims that the ClA has facilities in the Northeast. where they are testing drugs with some similar psychotropic properties as a defense against chemical weapons. cia and White House officials have declined to respond to these accusations. Perimeters have been set up all along the East Coast from Maryland all the way to Massachusetts. This house has no power going to it. Nobody's driven on this driveway for a Iong time, either. Let me go. You guys stay right here. That's for CIement. He's a retriever. You lost? You must be. There ain't nothing around here for miles. Why are you eyeing my lemon drink? I suppose the kind thing for me to do is to offer you supper. I ain't gonna ask you again. I hope the meal was sufficient. I wasn't expecting guests. This is a beautiful place. There's a springhouse in the back. They used to hide people from slave chasers back there. It has a speaking tube running under the ground to the main house. You can hear each other like you were in the same room. So, what's with you two? Who's chasing who? I'm sorry? Ain't no time two people staring at each other, standing still, Iove in both their eyes, at the same time, equal. Truth is, someone is chasing someone. That's the way we's built. So? Who's chasing? I knew that. I knew that. Don't touch things that aren't yours. -Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones? -No. I got enough to fill my time right here. I mend my own things. I grow my own food. although I ain't got the touch. Gardens don't grow the way they should. Never have. -How do you stay in contact with others? -I don't. How would you know if something were to happen? Like a world event? Mrs. Jones, something's happened along the East Coast. Whatever it is that you think is so important that you need to tell me, don't. Just keep it to yourself. The world don't care about me. I don't care about it. Suppose I have to let you spend the night. Guest room's up on the Ieft. Mind the steps. I'm scared, elliot. It's okay. I'm sorry about everything. That Joey thing. I was being stupid. You've been great taking care of Jess. I don't like this woman. There's something Exorcisty about her. How could she hit Jess like that? well, we need to stay in this house. You want me to protect you, this is how we have to do it. Let's just deal with her. I hear you whispering. planning on stealing something? No, ma'am, we're not. plan on murdering me in my sleep? What? No! Mrs. Jones? Mrs. Jones? Crazy lady. You trying to steal my things? No! No, Mrs. Jones, I actually wanted to talk with you. -You all are gonna leave right now! -Ma'am, you don't understand. There's something happening in a few states, in this region. -It's not safe! -Leave now! The Lord is my shepherd. The Lord is my shepherd. Mrs. Jones, could we talk calmly for a second? Just hear me out. See, I'm a teacher... Mrs. Jones? Oh, my God. alma, shut the windows and the doors! alma? alma? alma? Jess? Hi, froggie! Hi, froggie! Okay, yeah. Wait. How old do you think he is? Is he a baby? I think he's a baby. He's so tiny. I didn't know frogs could be like that. Oh, he got water on my shoe. Isn't this a cool house? If we had this house, we could make it look so pretty. Get him again. Get him again. Hey, froggie. alma? Good morning, elliot. Sounds like you're right here. -close the windows and the doors, alma. -Why? Mrs. Jones just died. close the windows. close the door, Jess! -Is everything closed? -Yes. -I'm sorry, alma. -What's going on, elliot? It's happening here. It could be the grass and the trees are doing this now. She was alone when it happened. Seems like they might have gotten more sensitive. It's too dangerous to go outside, isn't it? Yes. This is the end, isn't it? I wish you were here. Me, too. You remember our first date? You were so quiet. You bought me the mood ring. It turned purple when you wore it. Then you said, "That means you're in love." It got you to talk, didn't it? Then we checked the little paper chart, and it turned out that purple meant I was horny. -You loved that. -I had no idea. Yours was blue. peaceful, right? Right. What color was love? I don't remember. Me, neither. elliot? Yeah? I was just making sure you're there. It's not right for it to end like this. If we're gonna die, I want to be with you. I want to be with you, and I'm gonna come and be with you. elliot, don't! The event must have ended before we went out there. I found the hair clip! You don't want to be late for the first day schools are open. Oh, wait. I'm just gonna put this right here. Okay? -Are you okay? -Yes, Aunt alma. I Iove you. I Iove you, too. Come here. AII right. I'II pick you up after you're done with school, okay? Bye. As everyone knows by now. traces of the neurotoxin have been found in some plants and trees. Now. most environmentalists feel that this event is like the red tide in the ocean. but instead of algae killing fish. this happened on land. Now. plants and trees just can't pick up and move when they feel threatened. like other species. They have only one option. to rapidly evolve their chemistry. Well. Kay from Mississippi wants to know why it started so suddenly. on a Tuesday at 8.:33 and then ended so suddenly at 9.:27 the next morning. Well. Kay. to be perfectly honest. this was an act of nature. and we'll never fully understand it. And. Doctor. there's been a lot of speculation as to why this happened in the Northeast only. How do you explain that? Well. I believe. all right. and this is just my opinion. that this was a prelude. okay? A warning. like the first spot of a rash. We have become a threat to this planet. I don't think anybody will argue that. And this is a warning. go. I got to say, I'm impressed. This whole system, that's... that's all you? No, no, no, no, no. No, I just implement, you know? Make sure that you all fall in line. It's his. Our father's. Hmm. Your father's? Aren't you the curious one. - Oh, you don't know the half of it. - Hmm. In due time. You, uh... You want the private tour, don't you? Thought you'd never ask. You playing games with me, boy? Father! Go get him! This must be the place. Shh. So much for undercover. Let's go. You've stopped nothing. You know that? This is much bigger than you and me. Looks like your brother has some Campbell in him after all. Dean, you okay? Yeah, I'm good. If this works, it's not gonna be a kiddie ride. You know that? That's great. Light her up. So what did you see in there? - What? - In the nest. What did you see? Sam, I can't hear you. Your... your blood is so freaking loud, okay? Just... just back off. Give me the damn cure. L'chaim. I don't think it... Is it working? Either that or he's dying. Hey. So, what did you see? What? In the nest. What did you see? Um, well, I'm still trying to work through it. But, uh, I'm pretty sure they're not figuring out anything on their own. They're getting their orders from the top... where to go next, everything. The top as in... Their Alpha. At least, that's what I think it is. They've got some sort of psychic thing happening. And he sends them, uh... I don't know... messages. Saying what? Honestly? Recruitment drive. Their Alpha's building an army. Well, that's comforting. That's not the worst. Then what is? We don't scare them anymore. You've reached Lisa. Leave me a message. Thanks. Hey, Lis. Um... To continue recording, press 1. To erase... How did it go with Lisa? It didn't. I'm sorry. Yeah. At least, uh... you got my back. No matter what happens, I can always count on you, right, Sammy? Yeah. Of course, Dean. Edited by Scooby - You turned me. - Hate those fangs. - You bit me in the neck. - The bite doesn't matter. You have to actually ingest the blood to be infected. That was vampire blood he dosed you with. Lights too bright? Sunshine hurt your skin? I get so hungry. - What have you been doing? - Hunting, with some other people. - You? Working with strangers? - More like family. I'm your grandfather. I'll show you tricks your daddy never even dreamed of. I can't just lose you and Ben. Me and Ben will be here, and... You come when you can. Just come in one piece. Are you okay? I'm great. You've got me wondering. It's Sam, Bobby. He's different. Something's not right to me. You came. I told you I would. Shall we sit? I can't tell you that. - Too embarrassing. - Come on. Nothing you could ever say would... I mean, those poems you posted? They revealed who you really are. I know you, Kristen. Thanks. I actually... - Wrote one today. You want to...? - Of course I do. Damn it. Paper cut. Hi, clumsiest person ever. I have to go. Wait! I shouldn't be here. So why are you? I can't stop thinking about you. Then... Don't. We can't do this. - We can't be together. - There has to be a way. You think you know me. But you don't. I've done bad things. You should run. Now. I can make my own decisions. I'm 17. I have to show you something. - I knew it. - Are you scared? You should be. I'm just scared... I'm dreaming and I'll wake up in math class. Is it gonna hurt? I could never hurt you. Come with me. - Where? - Let me show you my world. So, your place... Is there gonna be velvet? Sure. This is it? It smells like pee. Nice work, Robbie. Robert, what's happening? This is what you wanted, isn't it? So, I'm actually not far. About a night's drive. So, you think... There's some stuff I gotta do here first. Of course. But I was thinking that, I'll wrap up here, you know... Make sure I'm not followed. Take side streets, and come at night. Will you just shut up and get your ass home? I can't wait to see you. This phone thing's getting old. Well, call us when you're close. And be careful. Of course. What are you so stoked about? What? Nothing. What do you got? Six girls in seven days, which is more disappearances than this city has seen in over a year. - All about the same age. - And cute. Ice cream comes in lots of flavors, Sam. Well, half a dozen girls, late teens, a shower away from greatness. Sounds like a profile. Wonder what else they got in common. Six directions to go, here. Pick a number. Seven. Another call just came in today. Kristen's a good kid. A little naive, sure. You try and be a good parent. Girls are hard. We'd just like to find your daughter. Last door on the left. Thanks. What do you think he was talking about? Drugs? It is so much worse. Vampires? These aren't vampires, man. These... These are douchebags. All right. Let's see what we can see. All right. That's just... - Uncomfortable. - What is he so bummed out about? Look at this. He's watching her sleep. How is that not rapey? I got to concentrate here, Dean. "He could hear the blood rushing inside her, almost taste it. "He tried desperately to control himself. "Romero knew their love was impossible". Romero? Really? Dean. Shut up. This is a national bestseller. How is that possible? Try, "Lautner." Wait. He's a werewolf. How do you even know who that is? That kid's everywhere. It's a freaking nightmare. How many Ts are there in Pattin... That's it. We're in. All right. Well? Her inbox is full from some guy claiming to be a vampire. A real vampire? "I can only meet you at night. I don't trust myself with you. "The call of your blood is too strong." Vampires phishing for victims? Probably just a human mouth-breather. On the other hand, talk about easy prey. For actual vamps. These chicks are throwing themselves at you. All you gotta do is... I don't know. Write bad poetry. Well, this guy wanted to meet her at a place called The Black Rose. - Give me a break. - I'm just reporting the news. It's probably just your standard-issue perv, right? Stop! Let me go! So now you're sure it's vampires. - 100%? - Definitely. We got a pattern now. Kids go missing, blood-bank van gets jumped. This is the fourth town. Clincher is, this last hit... Driver was found, throat ripped out. They grab kids... That's food, right? But if they already got a bunch of walking, talking juice bars, why bother with the blood mobile? - It doesn't add up. - Find the nest. Figure it out. Well, you wanted emo chicks. I think we hit ground zero. Thank you. Think she wears all that rubber at the beach? When's the last time we had a beer together, anyway? There. What do you think? He's hitting on her hard enough. Real? It's hard to tell. And we got multiple choice. Great. Three of them, two of us. Make that two of them. One's on the move. You go with Efron. I got Bieber. Are you sure, baby? Are you ready to join me in eternity? Oh, my God, totally. Go! Get out of here! - The hell are you doing? - Open your mouth! Take those out. Take 'em out! For the love of... What are you, 12? - Are you wearing glitter? - I only do it to get laid, man! Does it work? I'll be damned. All right, "mmmbop" your way out of here. And use a condom. You're pretty. I'm sorry? I said, "You're pretty." Sorry again, pal. I don't play for your team. My God, what is that sound? What sound? Keep it down! Please shut that off. - Dean, you should sit down. - You sit down. Out of all the ways to die, I never thought I'd be going out like this. Dean, nobody is going out. Samuel's gonna kill me. - He's not. - I'm gonna ask him to because you won't do it. - Hold on a second. - For what? Look at me! - We can figure this out! - How? Why aren't you freaked out? - Of course I am! - Really? I can hear your heartbeat, and it's pretty damn steady. That's cause I'm trying to remain calm. - Samuel will know what to do. - Come on, man. I'm a monster. This is not a problem that you spitball. We got to deal with this before I hurt somebody. How's it feel? - Now you wanna talk about my feelings? - I mean physically. How do you think it feels? Not good! - Where you going? - Bathroom, okay? News flash, Mr. Wizard. Vampires pee. I wasn't expecting you for a couple of days. I wanted to see you. What's up? - Are you okay? - Listen. - What's going on? - It doesn't matter. But I need you to know... You and Ben. Thanks. For everything. Dean, you're scaring me. God, I'm Pattinson. What? Nothing. I got to go. You can't just show up like this... - I wish it was different. - Stop! And explain to me what's going on out there. I can't bring this crap home to you. You're talking about your work. I'm talking about my life. It's ugly. And it's violent. And I'm gonna die, soon. Just tell me. Just tell me what the hell is going on. I got to go. Ben, just stay there. - I thought I heard you... - I said stay back! Can't keep track of your brother? - I didn't think he'd just... - He's not himself, Sam! He's a monster, and he's hungry. I've got to prepare to do the right thing. I told you he'd kill me when he showed up. Did you feed? I went to say goodbye to Lisa. - Which is a lousy idea. - Dean, answer the question. You can relax. I didn't drink anyone. Thank God. But I came close. All right. Do it. If you insist. Or I can just turn you back. - What? - What? I didn't drive all this way to kill you. I'm here to save you. That's my grandfather's journal. Cure's an old Campbell recipe. Kind of like the soup. No one's tried it since God knows. From what I hear, the stuff is a bad trip. Awesome. The cure is good. But a lot of this is on you. You drink, you're done. It won't work. Even one drop. - I got it. - Do you? Because you will feed. It's a matter of time. What else do we need? Some stuff we got, some we got to get. Trickiest thing... - Blood of the fang who turned you. - That guy was huge. There's nothing in the recipe about easy. You're gonna walk right into the nest? I'm one of them, aren't I? All I gotta do is get in there, get the guy alone, and... Shoot him with dead man's blood. - I should come with you. - Dude, you reek. You're like a walking hamburger. I got to do this solo. Except we haven't been able to find him yet. No problem. I can smell them. They're two miles east of town. Get the other crap and meet me there. It's dead man's blood. Enough to drop a linebacker and then some. Good luck, son. What the hell's wrong with you, Sam? - What do you mean? - You knew about the cure. - No, I didn't. - We talked about it, months ago. Not me. It must have been Christian or something. If you had known, it'd be almost like you let him get turned. Get a man on the inside, help us find that Alpha vamp? You serious? You think I'd risk my own brother? What's wrong with you? Look, I'm just relieved we can fix him. 'Sup? The guy Boris turned outside the bar, right? He said to look out for you. Well, glad you made it, man. Follow me. So, you must be starving. Here you go. I'm okay. I killed so many people on the way over here, so... About that. Company line is we don't just kill people anymore. But you got to tell me what that's like. First chance I get, - I'll show you myself. - Sweet. Don't worry about them. They're jealous. The recruiters get to bang all the chicks. That's you now, bro. Recruiters? Big man will explain. Be with you in a minute. "Your skin is the black velvet of the night." Nice. That stupid bitch will eat that up. She'll be dying to meet. Go get yourself some blood, sweetheart. Then march that little ass right back here, okay? Thank goodness. I thought the hunter chopped your pretty head. No, I got away. - Sorry, what's a hunter? - You'll see, if he finds us. You'll see him inside out. You eaten? Good. - You'll need your strength. - For? Robert didn't tell you? How old do I look? 33? You're off. By about six centuries. And these are the best days in the last 600 years to be a vampire. Dracula, Anne Rice? Please. These stupid little brats are so horny, they reinvented us as prince charming with a Volvo. They want a promise ring with fangs. So I give it to 'em. You go out, you get them, and you bring 'em home to me. So what's with the cages? That's just, you know, till they're compliant. Eventually, these girls will go out, and they'll fetch me boys like you. And around and around we go. I got to say, I'm impressed. This whole system... That's all you? No, I just implement, you know? Make sure that you all fall in line. It's his. Our father's. Your father's? Aren't you the curious one. You don't know the half of it. In due time. You want the private tour, don't you? Thought you'd never ask. You playing games with me, boy? Father! Go get him! This must be the place. So much for undercover. Let's go. You've stopped nothing. You know that? This is much bigger than you and me. Looks like your brother has some Campbell in him after all. Dean, you okay? I'm good. If this works, it's not gonna be a kiddie ride. That's great. Light her up. So what did you see in there? - What? - In the nest. What did you see? I can't hear you. Your blood is so freaking loud, okay? Just back off. Give me the cure. L'chaim. I don't think it... - Is it working? - Either that or he's dying. So, what did you see? What? In the nest. What did you see? I'm still trying to work through it, but I'm pretty sure they're not figuring out anything on their own. Getting their orders from the top... Where to go next, everything. - The top as in... - Their Alpha. I think. They've got some sort of psychic thing happening. And he sends them, I don't know, messages. Saying what? Honestly? Recruitment drive. Their Alpha's building an army. - Well, that's comforting. - That's not the worst. Then what is? We don't scare them anymore. You've reached Lisa. Leave me a message. Thanks. To continue recording, press 1. To erase... How did it go with Lisa? It didn't. I'm sorry. At least... You got my back. No matter what happens, I can always count on you, right, Sammy? Of course, Dean. Previously on "America's Next Top Model" 32 wonderful girls came to l.A. For a chance to be part of the top model network. 12 girls were selected to come to the big apple.

Hi, raina. Let's see your best shot. Wonderful. And i do like the way your hands are so grateful. You could be a courtison in a 19 century painting. Do you know what that is? No. It is like the king's mistress. You give me a vibe of a woman that is used to rings And jewelry and used to big men, big lovers, big houses, used to the good life. ** It's gorgeous. Thank you, raina. Thank you, guys. Angelea. Love those bootses girl. ** ** Just the t-Shirt and the jeans and the cavalier boots. Much stronger. That's it. Your face is stunning and you have a good body. A shame you didn't work it. You almost have a telescopic view into the nether regions and you have done it with style. Thank you, angelea. Up next is simone. Turn to the side and let's see that shaved hair. Let's see you in the jacket. A little stiff but i have to say i can't get over your skin and how sexy you look. Smile with your eyes a little more and it will take you over the top. Thank you. Up next is gabrielle. All right. Let's see your best shot. Judges are silent. It is not necessarily a good thing. You look scared. You look like you are covering yourself in an awkward cross. The pose is awkward and you should have been more relaxed. You lose your neck and when you lose your neck the model walks out of the building. Your neck is your key to being a model and having to show that length. Up next, jessica. I'm not crazy about all that. I'm not either. Take the skirt off. You can do that. Good body. ** Take the neckless off, too. ** take everything off, darling. ** You are living high fashion here. The hair is controlled. ** You have a gift. You are a chameleon. You know how to change it up, how to bend and tuck and move And it is a natural thing. Well done. Up next is krista. Hi, krista. Hi, guys. Here is your best shot. Not loving it. You with this hair looks like a 1960s mannequin. You are going straight into old fashioned pose. It is like with models there is all different types of makeup And crazy hair and it is your job to sell it. Tell us about this hair and how you really feel. ** I express myself through my clothes and my makeup and my hair. Do you know why i had you do your hair like this? Because of the cheek bones, he totally understand it. The cheek bones are so strong and if your hair was in A bun or even slicked back this picture would have been stronger. Beautiful. Love it. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Up next is naduah. ** It was totally art fix. As if she studied some famous portrait of someone. There is no sense of the real you. Your face looks incredible but almost looks Like your head is chopped off from the body in this picture. You have a confidence that shines in your photos and i was quite impressed, darling. Thank you very much. Up next is brenda. What article of clothing were you selling. I got the watch. I think the knee and leg is very awkward in the photograph. Don't you agree, nigel? I do. The look in your eyes is so strong and so powerful. It is alluring. This is an example of hiding your neck and being okay. It is like that which is making it very nice. You had a really tough time with your makeover. I had longhair over my life and it is more like my security blanket. I feel safe with longhair. You had to do this makeover. I have seen so many models when they had their hair kind of Regular and they cut it off and they became huge. Up next is tatianna. All right. Let's see tatianna in a scarf. It you are a completely different person there. ** I would buy it. You are doing the smiles with the eyes. But three quarters of our film you were in this pose. So hit this a couple of times and then keep it moving. And last but not least, alasia. All right. The whole neck is not very model - - The necklace is not very model. Much bhtter. Let's look at your best. I have never seen a photo like that. Neither have i. ** Which fashion magazines have you been studying? I don't know what to say. Explain to me. Why are you crying? Because i don't want them to send me home. I am the only person that i would say that i absolutely love this photograph. I don't see those flaws. I saw you for the boldness of having the imagination to take The jacket and put it on backwards and put your arm Where it was and take that pose. I think it is a raw beautiful photograph. Thank you. In a gallery i would buy this. Where would you hang it in the house? Right in my salon. ** A room where you go and confer and serve beautiful drinks and talk about politics, religion, Art, love, section, wine, roses and that fabulous girl and that Fabulous deriere, butt, and i think it is a wonderful photograph. Thank you. Now, it is time for the judges to deliberate. And when i call you back, i will announce which one of you is going home. So now it is time to deliberate. Ren? A classic sort of nude pose. And i love the emotion in her eyes. I love the kate moss vibe. Simone. The best thing is her skin. I don't think she filled the jacket properly. It is awkward and gosh. Tatianna. With this hair and makeup and lighting and this face it works. You can go right into the shop and say i want that scarf. ** Is it robertoish? ** And all the luxury brandsish. Gabrielle. Boring. Cliche. It is catalogy and the wrong catalog. Too hidden. There is no emotion and thog here other than the fact that she is a gorgeous girl. Jessica. I love everything about this photograph. ** Krista. This picture for me is wretched. ** but there is potential. Naduah. She saw a photograph of a magazine and said let me do this. This looks like an ad and i bo buy the shades. ** Really 70s and retro. Pretty girl and that's it for me. ** I love her face ** She has something there. A look in the eyes and the strength. Raina. The lyricism in her body is extraordinary. ** A secret this those eyes. She knew how to put the ring on and sell it. ** Alasia. ** It feels amateurish. I think this is bold and out of the box and imaginative. ** There are lots of girls who turn awkwardness into assets on the runway. ** Angelea. Flipping through a magazine i would stop. And i would remember that photograph. And that is important because that is advertising. You want to stop. The hand is perfect and dainty. ** That is a powerful hand. ** I like the picture. I would look at this ad and stop and the hair and The purse and how she is holding it. I should look at the purse and what is the fabric. You guys are crazy! Have we reached a decision. Yes, we have. We have. 13 beautiful young ladies stand before me. But, unfortunately, i only have 12 photos in my hands. And these photos represent the 12 of you that are still in the Running towards becoming "america's next top model." Now, the first name that i am going to call has been voted Best photo by the judges this week. And that photo will be displayed in your home here in new york city as digital art. The girl with the best photo each week will also get to participate in the next Challenge prize no matter how poorly she does at the actual challenge. So the first girl, best photo this week - - Jessica. Oh, my gosh! Really? Yes. Thank you. Congratulations. You're still in the running towards becoming "america's next top model." Runner-Up for best photo this week is - - Angelea. Congratulations. Thank you, girl, thank you. Ren. Thank you. Brenda. Simone. Tatianna. Thank you. Angelea. Congratulations, angelea. Raina. Come here, naduah. Now, go over there. Alexandra. The next girl is - - Krista. Oh, thank you. Gcongratulations. You are still in the running towards becoming "america's next top model." Thank you! Will alasia and gabrielle please come forward? Two beautiful young ladies stand before me but i only haveone photo in my hands. And this photo represents the girl that is still in the Running towards becoming "america's next top model." I will call only one name and the girl that i do not call Must immediately return to your apartment here in new york City, pack your bags and go home. Gabrielle, you stand before me such a lovely girl in person But when your photo appeared on that screen there was dead silence. And that dead silence in the fashion industry represents the reader turning the page in the magazine very fast. Just unimpressed and that is a problem. And then there is alasia. Alasia, your photo it made the judges feel very uncomfortable. It is interesting because there is so many beautiful girls that Look like you and say i want to be a model but as soon as the Camera comes up it is like the camera is saying a totally different thing. So who stays? Angelea. You are still in this competition because there is One man behind me that said he would hang this photo up in his salon. Come here. Congratulations. Ever you're still in the running towards becoming "america's next top model." And you, lady, have way too much potential to be turning out pictures and film like that. You just have to push and work. Remember that neck. When somebody looks at your pictures you want them to go "oh, my god, that's gabrielle" Or oh, that is weird and that is odd, i don't know if i like it. Would you want debate as - - You want debate as opposed to silence. I'm just in like major shock. I wanted to represent women all over but i wanted to do it for myself and sit back and say Yeah, i broke that barrier, i was that one and i'm not that one. ** I'm going to school to do fashion merchandising and i guess do modeling on the side. No matter what i'm going to be somebody. This is like a wakeup call for me to completely. I'm just so glad that they see i want this and i have potential. I can do it. I just need to be taught. I'm going to step my game up. Oh, my gosh! Oh, this is cute. Chameleon. Look at that. All of the girls talking so loud is seriously giving me a brutal headache. ** Especially alasia. She is constantly screaming. ** It is just so hard being here because i think i'm far too intelligent. Tyra mail! Tyra mail! Why did the model cross the road? Guess youville to find out tomorrow. Love, tyra! Runway. Must be the runway. We are going to have to walk down in pairs. Everything i have done is always in competition. Interesting. Whether it is basketball or horse shows. If i do something even minor wrong like it bothers me. You have a lot of brothers and sisters, right? I have 8. I was in a religious cult. I was born into a religious cult. It is a big deal for me when i left when i was 17. Being a part of this competition means so much to me. Growing up in a cult was traumatizing fallly and emotionally. That might be why you were so strong. ** I wouldn't change anything In my life because if i had i wouldn't be as in control as i am now. ** Don't you do a photo shoot naked. And it was with my husband And it was very sexy since he is black and i'm white. ** Playboy asked me once. I turned them down. I have done a lot of local work in cancun for one of the local magazines. ** You did international fashion week four times in the past year. That has to make so much money, girl, you have to have. No one there pays well, that is why. It is another big reason i'm here. Naduah, sometimes her stories don't match up to me. I had no money and i was going to the street. Playboy asked you to work for them and you are on the street begging? Why don't you take that to make money for yourself. A lot of people owe me money from years and years of working. I never made a lot of money. I don't doubt her growing up in a cult and all these traumatic things that happened. But with all the different stories, i don't know. I don't know if she is lying or not but the stories aren't matching up? Why? If she's married, where's the ring on her finger? It's sad. No, it's pathetic. The girls might be uncomfortable because they see naduah with experience ** ** ** So we walk into this beautiful windowed building and There is this white carpet and we know it is runway. I know you all miss me, but hey, ladies, timing is everything. A top model must keep her timing and face perfectly on the runway. What i want you to do is line up right here. There is a way to get out of a coat and a jacket. Unbutton from the bottom up, it's easier. ** When i walk in i will start to undo it automatically. When i get down here i will do this and this. Keep it away from the body. What i want you to do as you are walking i want you to get out of your coats. I'm glad that we do get those teachings from miss j Because people are paying for that kind of stuff. ** to all up in here. Once it comes off to the side. Remember, it is timing and pace is everything. Pace that, sweety. I want you to smile. You had it like with dirty laundry. Good. I think one of the good things that comes out of being A really competitive person is that i'm able to take critiques well. Don't look down. ** I have had coaches yelling in my face my entire life. Get your shoulder back because your solder is a bit rounded. When i push my daughter in the baby stroller i push the Whole front side of my body forward. So got to remind and change my ways about pushing the baby stroller. You have this thing, i said it is about pace and timing. I need some more life out of you, too. Raina i believe i could see a great career but she doesn't see it yet. This is the girl that had to shave her armpits on makeover day but there is potential there. I know i'm not the best but damn, alasia is garbage. I don't think any model has it natural. I think they all had to learn and had to get a technique. You walk like the old black woman that keeps her Hands on the purse on the subway. What you talking about, child? The second part of your lesson is, come with me. You are going to walk out here and i'm going to have you walk across the street with cars, People and madness, darling! People in cars are going to get in your way. So here is a perfect opportunity to work on your Pacing and you must take off your jacket as you are doing it. It as huge intersection and we are all looking out the window like oh! So you ready? Yes! Oh, my god. Your focus is just like this and everything just blacks out And it is just a runway from there on. And you strut it. I saw her like a block away. She was taking off her coat and i was like oh, my gosh, she looks so pleasant. I'm remembering like timing. Timing. You have to go there and go back before the light turns green. She did keep her pace. Needs a little more bump in the grind. I want to see a girl seriously do some new york jaywalking. It was kind of sill will. We had to go into the 45-Degree weather and cross this damn, New york busy street. Your beauty should be able to stop traffic! People immediately start looking at me like what is the matter with this crazy woman And i'm loving it because that means attention! I notice a girl giving a weird face on the street. Like see one of these and one of like. I think those girls need to put some clothes on. It is like 20 degrees outside. Too cold. If there is one thing to remember, timing is everything. See ya! Bye. Tyra mail! All right. Tomorrow you will really need to be in the swing of things. Love, tyra. We are going to get to model on the swings. Alasia is really getting on my nerves. Shut the up for one second, please. Surrogate's courthouse lower manhattan The runway. Oh, my gosh! Hey, girls. Today is your first runway challenge. Girls meet rachel. Not only is she beautiful, but also very talented and she has dressed some of the red carpet's hottest stars And even the first lady herself, michelle obama. To be walking in a rachel fashion show is what a ton of Models dream of and never get to do. Hi, ladies. Tonight you will be wearing my 2010 spring designs. The girl who we think walks the best will get to keep the garment. Oh, my gosh! Don't get so excited now. This is a challenge and you girls have to walk through these pendulums. Oh, my god! With perfect timing. If not, you just may get knocked. My first reactionx ** You girls have to walk through these pendulums. Oh, my good! Everyone is in shock. Everyone in their mind. I'm going to get hit and thrown off the runway. You have to time it perfectly. I don't think all these girls are ready for it but i am so we'll see. We have to go down 30 something steps in like tiny hill legals and a tight dress But turns out that that was the least of my worries. The pendulum hits me and startles me so my main focus is keep going and pose and i know that i recovered well. Considering that i have a skin tight dress i knew i had to make my face and body Stronger because i had to walk slower which gave them more time to look at me. So it is very strategic. Very elegant.Very elegant. I was so embarrassed thinking oh, man, i messed it up, i blew it! I looked at that pendulum and i was like please. I was so in the moment. I love the music because the music made me feel like a dare devil. ** My walk needs work but i think i did a really good job. You can't really have a strategy for something you haven't dealt with before. You just have to try not to get hit. I realized that i'm not going At the right pace so for the first one i had to stutter my Steps but at least i didn't fall or slip. I actually wasn't nervous. I tend to get too excited to get nervous. My strut, i think it is sexy And i think it is classy and i think it is powerful. I'm excited to finally get some recognition. I think miss j was pretty impressed. When i first fell, i was horrified but the Competitiveness was just rushing through me like oh, my god, You idiot, get up, pull yourself together, suck it up. I think i should have just take and breath and relaxed a little bit up there. Instead i was like oh, my god, make it fierce and do something And distract them so i think i did that in my face. Mad. She's mad. ** She fell twice! I was like oh, my gosh! She got hit off the runway. Are you okay? You recovered well. You got up. 'M really competitive and i let things really get to me and that is something i never saw happening to myself. ** Pefect So when you gave that top model tumble your ** You started marching but it wasn't strong and powerful. Models fall all the time. Get up and keep going and sell the pose. Alasia, you need to take a strong elegant step. Your face is insane. Loved it. You're getting better. Brenda? I loved how you wore the dress. Fits you to a tee and i thought you made the dress look beautiful. ** The more you walk the better you get. I love the dress on you so i'm quite happy. ** Loosen up a little bit. Your body is not there yet and it completely throws you off. Naduah, this girl has face. Pop our lips out like that is your safety. Relax and smile. When you are effortless your type of beauty comes through and shines that way. So the winner of this challenge is -- Brenda. I couldn't have asked for much more. I'm so excited. I have the most gorgeous dress! So i tonight nowhere i'm going wear it but. There is a girl who was first pictured the other night at panel. Ms. Jessica, you get to keep your outfit as well. Thank you, ladies. Good night. I'm all out with that now! Alasia. ** What? You need to check that. ** I ain't going to let nobody speak to me like that for no reason. You ain't supposed to - - You don't tell me to shut the [ bleep ] up. Come down. ** Stop talking to me. You startd that stuff with me. You are acting like a real bitch right now. Tonight throw stuff. Okay, that's enough. You done lost your mind. Oh, i lost my mind? Stop talking to me. Be quiet. Quit it. Quit if. Cut it out. I may be young but that don't give no one no initiative to say something to me. I hate snapping on people. ** If i wanted to hit you with that i would hit you with it Because i was two feet away from you. I would be happy living my life and instead i chose to be in this crazy house. Do not piss me off because i'm going to go off tonight. ** I'm not in the mood for her little bitch attitude. Seriously. I'm not going to let her ruin my focus in ** ** ** What's going on? I have had it with all of these stupid fights. I went from having absolutely no drama in my life, being poor As hell but still being happy to this. I don't even feel like i'm myself. For my sanity, i'm just not sure how long i can possibly uphold this. I see you on the verge of just like breaking. I don't want you to tear apart who you are for something -- This isn't worth it to me. It's not. I do like having her here but i think if she doesn't want to be here she doesn't need to Tyra mail! Make your mark before you disappear. Love, tyra! Magic. We are going to get down to the end of the runway and disappear. We pull up to this place in brooklyn and i'm thinking this Is some hood stuff, i don't want to be here, i'm scared. ** Today we are going to do your first beauty shot nice And tight with manhattan in the background. We are in new york city. We are going to do a shot that is brenda abouts cool new fragrance. ** Give me a beauty fragrance pose. And this is the fragrance. Looks what starts to happen, it starts to fade. But you going to deal with wind, rain, Literally, you have to make it look like they are not affecting you at all. What we have to do is spray this perfume on us and before It disappears while water is hitting us and air is hitting Us look as beautiful as possible to get the perfect shot. Get down to hair and makeup. We will see you guys in a bit. We are going to be freezing. ** ** ** I don't have any - - That was my first time on the runway ever. Ever. Hello, ladies. How are you doing? As long as you give me that kind of energy on set today. This is brian and he is your photographer. He did the shoot out on ellis island and did the attack of the 54 women's shoe. Yes. Let's knock it oust the box and get something amazing. All right. Wind and rain. ** Don't hyper ventilate, girl. Oh, my gosh, i think i got water in my brain because it was like. Model. Don't look cold, look pretty. Lose those hands. Is that sexy! Oh, my god that looks crazy. I was in the bottom two last time so i was like need to get it together, girl. Is that better? Ish. She needs to stop analyzing and retain information. This was a little better than last week. Now, get warm. Ok, thank you. ** We are doing like a black blue lip. ** She has been eating tar. Open up the camera. ** I love the use of the fabric. Very pretty. Last frame. Going into photo shoot i'm just like all right, i need this. I fell down the stairs and off Of a runway, i have to do so Well. Remove that right hand. It looks like a claw. Right at the beginning of alexandra's shoot she starts giving me vogue, vogue, vogue. We are not selling nail polish. You are covering up all the blue. Now, it's gone. Spray it again. Gorgeous. I love the hair. It is almost like cindy crawford is on set. Turn your body. Usually when you throw a cat in the water you just went like this. You don't have to smile necessarily but that is good. I love that semi profile one. Pretty. Last frame. There you go. They are always fixing the makeup after they do it. ** Naduah thinks naduah knows too much. Have them do it. If they want your hair darker they will do it. You are here to learn, not here to walk in and say here i am, i know everything. Everyone is losing their minds. I felt that sometimes the girls get uncomfortable around mere. That is okay with me. A lot of people aren't as comfortable as i am so it is going to be thought of as arrogance. Here is trouble. Here is the thing. Last week i probably expected most from you so when we got on Set and started working i was disappointed probably because i expected more. Go back to the basics and don't overthink it. Be careful putting your hands here because it looks like just fingers in the shot. This is not pretty at all. Naduah has to not be afraid of erring on the side of simplicity. When she would turn into the elements she would fight with ? Her mouth and it looked really awkward like kind of like a blowup doll. Last frame. Change up your hands a little. Good. Loving the body. Could use more out of your eyes. Try not to be too squinty in the water. Don't hide the fragrance. Relax your shoulders. Don't look cold. Give me your face off this way just a touch. Brenda was like stuttering. She she was totally thrown. Try and keep your eyes open. Beautiful. Last frame. There you go. Water, wind. That's great. See if we can get some softer almost a little serene. Great. That's gorgeous! We would make madonna blush! Beautiful. Beautiful. Gorgeous. Lord, raina was my favorite of the day. ** Probably the only girl who could nail straight on to camera. All right, wind and water. Let's go. Okay. Let's stop for a second. I can feel my contacts moving in my eyeballs and it hurt a lot. I couldn't breathe. You got five more frames. Pose.O Don't have to look so cold. I wanted to get it over with because i was so uncomfortable. Last frame. Okay. That's a wrap. I wonder who's going to get the nicest photo this time? I get the feeling it is not going to be me because they are going to keep working me. I'm not at all nervous about panel. I'm going to get one great shot in there. For all my faults i really do think i have something great going. I feel it went well. I'm not afraid of being kicked off. ** Tomorrow you will meet with the judges, only 11 will continue on in the hope of Becoming "america's next top model." Raina, i never asked you, how did your shoot go? I just, i couldn't breathe or see. Today i don't care. Maybe they do want it more. Maybe they are willing to give up their whole lives just for this then that's fine. But i'm willing to give up my sanity and my happiness for this. Alasia, who do you think is going home tomorrow? Everybody probably thinks i was going home. ** I was in the bottom two **. I pray to god that the last ** ** Well, hello, ladies. Hello. The prices the first a contract with one of the top Modeling management companies in the entire world, wilhelmina models. A six-Page spread and cover of "seventeen" magazine and $100,000 contract with cover girl cosmetics. Let's talk about these judges. Mr. Nigel barker. Noted fashion photographer. Andre leon talley, a leader and one of the most influencial people in the entire fashion industry. And our guest judge is rachel roy. You all know a little something about her. And she is my good luck charm because i won an emmy in her dress. Let's get start So who is first? Alasia. Come on down, alasia. What do you think about the outfit? Dreckitude. What is dreckitude? **? ** I like this picture of you. A little bit of attitude in it. For me the picture is dramatic and i could see if in A double-Page spread in a high fashion magazine. You created our own rag time. I can't see much in your eyes and that worries me and i ** See that kind of long drool coming off your chin. ** Thank you, alasia. ** You have a beautiful profile **. I notice your profile and i thought it was beautiful and here again i would buy that. It i would buy something from her and it isn't even my color. ** Next up is ren? What are you thinking? It was tough. I had my contacts in and i was cold and i couldn't breathe right. ** You look like you have a cold, ren. This is the sort of picture that sells h 1 n 1 vaccine. You have to fight through the discomfort. On the contact lenses, take them out and go blind. ** Next up is krista. This is stunning. ** I feel this is a wonderful photograph. ** I can say that is just joyous to see that view come through. What i love about this is the fact that you have done the opposite of what you think. Water in your eyes you would think you would squint and that is when it becomes interesting. You create fantasy when you do something like that. Thank you. Next up is naduah. Hi. Let's see your best shot. ** There is a drama but a stereo typical kind of drama. It doesn't have the true magic. I don't feel there was any thought behind this. Last week i thought your picture looked like an add and this looks like an ad. Get past the exaggerated advertisement and one thing you need to do right now. What? You got so much makeup on you just drew an eyebrow on that we took off and you have eyeliner. Because it is patchy. That is better than what you have on now. ** Powder and t eyeliner. Go on back. Ok. Up next is tatianna. Gorgeous. I love it. I can't take my eyes off of your face. It is perfection. There is a vulnerability in your body and expression of fragility. It is romantic and i think it is beautiful. ** Up next is brenda. Challenge winner. Let's see your best shot. This does nothing **. Flat. ** Next. It is funny because in person you look fresh and edgy and strong. But when you are side lit it adds so many years on you that you do not have. Remember, follow it. ** Okay? Thank you. Thank you, guys. Jessica. Let's see your shot. It's all right. It's okay. What is saving you is the parachute. Youareso youngand it appears you have good energy And i'm not getting any of that from the shot and you never Want the clothing to be the best part of the photo. You still want to be the best part of the photo. Thank you, jessica. Thank you. Up next is angelea. This does nothing for me. I don't like the hair and the face, it as mess. One thing to do to make it come alive. Open your lips. Open your mouth. Breathe out. It will make it a little more sexy and a little more edgy. Thank you, angelea. Up next **. As a shod it works. It is a perfume ad, i don't get it. ** I heard something happened at fashion show. You fell? Yes. Ok. You got back up. I got back up and turned around and then i fell off the stage. Why are you crying? I just don't want to go home. I mean i can't help that. On the the gun down. - Where's Kate? - Jack, it's okay. - I said drop it! - Where's Kate? ! - She's fine.Just put down-- I'm not putting down anything. Do you want him to die? Put it down.

I'm going for the pontoon. Don't be an idiot. You see that toothy son of a bitch, you aim and squeeze. Got it? Got it. Come on, come on, come on. Sawyer? Sawyer! Sawyer! Give me your hand. There he is. Do you see him? - Hi. - Oh! Hey. Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Packing's been a disaster, and the plane leaves first thing in the morning. Sure. No problem.

I never should have brought him on the raft. I'm gonna get him back. I'm gonna get back my son. Well, how about that? Current brought us back. We're home. Jin? - Michael! Sawyer! - Jin! Oh, oh, oh! Jin, what's wrong? Others. Others. Others. What? Others! Others! What? Others. Do you remember Juliet Shaw? Adam. Juliet. You used to be really good. I was too, but I lacked something that you had. Integrity. Any news from Adam? Just awaiting his status report. Oh. I thought it would have come in by now. Fiona? He'll be all right. Sometimes I think how selfish I was... to have a child. This programme contains some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. BANGS ON DOOR Morning. This is Phillip Norton, he's an MI6 Officer stationed at our Embassy in Istanbul. I've had him flown here to brief us personally. It was Ali Mohamed Yazdi who killed my man in the souk. Mr Norton, please, tell us from the beginning... Yes. We picked up information about an illegal immigration network in the cafe talk. Cafe talk? Yeah, a major source in Istanbul. It's surprising what you can piece together. Have you checked out the cafe talk? Yes, and it's true... there's an illegal immigrant route into the UK that starts in Istanbul. A British truck's involved. They go through Bulgaria into Serbia, then into Austria and across the Channel by ferry. So you put a local agent in undercover? I baby-sat him at the souk. The contact came. Then I saw Yazdi. You sure it was him? Yeah. And he killed your man without any provocation? Took a look and didn't like him. .That's in Yazdi's profile. Impulsive. Sudden decision-making. Do the chattering cafe classes know who runs this network? The word is it is run as a sideline by a Middle Eastern prince. Name? All we could get is that he is called "The prince who eats diamonds". Hmm... What do you conclude? That Mohamed Yazdi planned to enter this country using an illegal immigrant route. That's way under our radar. And for what purpose? To lead a major terrorist attack, of course. In the UK. And it's MI5's responsibility to stop it. The real thing. Dead right. Yazdi is special, though. Born Iranian, trained as a doctor in the early 1990s, Kent University. On his way to his first-class degree and then drops out. September 1997. That was when the Taliban took Kabul. The bright lights of Al Qaeda training camps beckoned. Why? Intellectuals everywhere can get bowled over by extremism. Change the world or burn it. It's a powerful thought. I had it too for a while. Don't worry, it passed. He began his career in 1998. Walked into a Cairo hotel and opened fire on a heavily guarded Israeli delegation. Four killed, eleven wounded. Next operation, killed 70 people with a bomb in Islamabad. Fell out with Bin Laden. Set up a splinter group, Al Kahf. The cave, where the soldiers of the Jihad shelter. His last operation, six months ago, went horribly wrong. Morocco. Car bomb at a government office. A school bus was passing. Twelve children were killed, eighteen badly injured. He rang a newspaper, claimed the bombing, and shouted, "Do no harm !" We think what? This maniac's bringing Al Kahf to Britain? It's our turn for 9/11? No, there's no chatter about a major terrorist attack. That's even more scary. "Do no harm. " Six have got all the watchers they have out in Istanbul. Nothing. He'll have bolted. Think so? The prince who eats diamonds. Sheik Abd Al Gawaad Ahmed bin Wali al Hakim. Eldest son of King Ahmed bin Wali al Hakim, ruler of the Gulf state of Bahar. Prince Hakim will become king when his father dies. So if he's running an illegal immigrant network into this country, things could go pear-shaped... diplomatically. Sod diplomacy. Our job's to find out what Yazdi wants to use the network for. There could be a major threat to the UK. Britain's a big ally of Bahar - oil, building contracts... We've sold them 32 harriers. If we're going to wreck British Foreign policy in the Arabian Gulf, let's make sure we've got the right prince. It's him. He's notorious for mixing ground diamonds into his food. - Why does he do that? - To increase his potency. - Does it work? - I really wouldn't like to know. He has a permanent suite in the Regal Hotel, Park Lane. What does he get up to there? Oh, nothing out of the ordinary - drink, sex, gambling. So what's the link between Yazdi and the prince? Ask him. I'll do it. Your Royal Highness, I am from the immigration service. I wonder if you could help me with a serious matter. Now look, I should warn you... Well, that didn't work. Arrogant bastard! The Bahar government have made an official complaint about the gross conduct of an immigration official in The Regal Hotel. Apparently you were drunk. What? ! And as a result of this disgraceful incident, the prince will not speak to any Government agency in this country. We need to get this joker. Set up a rat trap? Good idea... with Caroline as bait, I think. Malcolm, bug the prince's suite. Didn't we bug this suite when Bill Clinton used it? We did. Happy days. Observing the prince at table one. OK, Caroline moving into position... Well done! She's pulled him. Please use call signs X-ray, Foxtrot, over and out. You're not on the roster. Charming, Mr...whoeveryouare . I thought we could have a drink together. Sorry madam, I'm working. You're thinking of going after Yazdi. Am I? I want to say don't. Don't. If you're going to do what I think you are, you'll be terribly exposed. I'll look after myself. Promise. It's like pulling petals off a flower... Who's going to get killed first? You? Me? Come on, Fi. If you could go after Yazdi, you would. Wouldn't you? Foxtrot. Bird's on the wing, I repeat - bird's on the wing. X-ray out. Camera one, flickering. Can we adjust? Wow! Eyes on the machinery, gentlemen. Have you chosen the photos you're going to use? Yes, and GCHQ have sent over the phone numbers. I'd better get going. PHONE RINGS Internal phone off. Is the mobile network disrupter? Just the upper floors of the hotel. Hotel wire-free network... Gopix. PHONE RINGS Morning, your Royal Highness. One click on my computer, and the material goes out on the internet. I'm sure your father won't be happy to see you humiliated. If you are a common blackmailer you have no idea of the power... We are not blackmailers. We're British Intelligence. We need to have a conversation with you in the strictest confidence. Your Highness? Very well. Over to Harry. I have here 432 photographs. This CD is the master disk for the video taken... What do you want from me? You run a network for immigrants entering this country illegally using a British truck. The collecting point is in Istanbul. Ridiculous. We know this because an MI6 agent penetrated the network. Ridiculous. He was killed. I have no knowledge of this. The name of the man who killed the MI6 agent is Ali Mohamed Yazdi. Ridiculous! What is your association with Ali Mohamed Yazdi? None. How could there be an association? Yazdi's a terrorist! Six months ago, he killed innocent children in Morocco. He has sworn to destroy the whole house of Hakim, turn Bahar into an Islamic republic. You know the insane dreams of these people. We strongly suspect that Yazdi himself will try to use the network to enter this country to mount an attack upon the British State. I have no idea of that, Mr... Forgive me, what is your name? Giles Farmer. No idea, none! That the cave is using my... little enterprise, I am sick to my soul, Mr Farmer. Our two countries have long been friends. I will co-operate with you fully. Where does the route run from? A house in a poor quarter of Istanbul. How often is the route used? The truck leaves on the first Thursday of every month. And that is all I can tell you. Please, if I can be of any further assistance, Mr Farmer... You will not be allowed to leave this hotel suite until we say so. This is outrageous! I have diplomatic immunity. I am aware of that. The prince denies knowing anything. But could be lying. Yazdi wants to get into this country. He must have contacts here, but where? Special Branch did three raids. They found nothing to link anyone we know to Al Kahf or to Yazdi. I think he'll come. I think he'll use the prince's truck. But he knows that route's blown. He thinks he's untouchable, he thinks he can walk through walls. We send Special Forces to Istanbul. If he's spotted trying to use the network, they take him out. The Turks have offered full co-operation. There is another way. Adam... Put someone in undercover in the truck. Make contact with Yazdi, turn him. That's insane. Think! Yazdi is a double agent. One of the founder members of Al Kahf, reporting to us. He's an international terrorist! Why in hell's name should he turn? It's in his record. He's all ego. Each attack is more extreme than the last. I know he can flip. What's the greatest form of flattery? To be desired by your enemies. And do no harm. It's the Hippocratic Oath. Yeah, doctors swear to do no harm. I think to him, being a terrorist, being a doctor... Samething. What do you mean? He can save people as a doctor, or overthrow what he sees as tyranny by blowing them up. To him, the two extremes are the same - heal, change the world. Anyway, we don't have an officer who could get away with it. Don't we? I'll be a Circassian from Northern Syria. They have fair hair, white skin, blue eyes. DE Lawrence went undercover as a Circassian. I'll work up a good legend. I'll be from Aleppo. This is reckless. Yeah, but doable. He'll just get himself killed. It's a big prize. Will his legend hold up? We'll do everything to make it work. But I'll need a special dispensation. Syrian identity card. Your name is Ami Tlass. Ami Tlass. A Kuwaiti work permit. Why Kuwait? You're from Aleppo but with a Kuwait residency. That gives you a middle-class background. Construction engineer, you said you're up to speed on that? The comm device has a range of one kilometre, it's in your lapel. And this... magnetic GPS device. Your plane leaves in 45 minutes. Zaf's waiting by the car. Great. Salam Alekem. Alekem Salam. HE SPEAKS TURKISH Not Turkish, speak English. Where are you from? Kuwait, but I, er, I'm here for the truck. No talk! In! Who's this? Not till I say so, pal. Please, sir... I mean, what is he anyway? He looks Circassian. Yeah well, I don't want him in my truck. White-looking Arab? I don't like it. Come here. I don't want any trouble. Do you understand? No trouble, no trouble. White Arab! Come on, get them in the truck. Come on, up! Beta Base. 'Beta base. ' Zaf's on the satellite scrambler link. 'We may have a no-show. 'There's no sign of Yazdi. ' Maintaining observation, over and out. All right, in you get, come on. I even got you water. Hey, old man... Yeah, come on, chop-chop. Target is present. Repeat, target is present. Yazdi. Part of me wishes he hadn't shown. The satellite's online. Ruth, contact Juliet Shaw. I want to go to a category-one terrorist alert. Brother, do you speak English? A little. When do you think we can pray? When the English idiot of a driver stops. Where are you from? Aleppo. Where are they now? An hour from the Bulgarian border. Has Zaf called in? Yes, he's following. What about the raids? Special Branch have houses in North London, Manchester, Bradford and Birmingham. And there's nothing. Right, I want all the trees shaken. If there's an Al Kahf cell in this country, we've gotta find it. I know Aleppo. Where was your house? In Babel-Quinnisine. What is your work? I am an engineer. The steel structure of buildings. What have you built? The Royal Bank of Bahar, in Kuwait City. If you are such an eminent engineer, why are you in this truck? Why not a... passport, airline ticket? My cousin, from my father's family... he was martyred in Afghanistan. The British think my family all are terrorists. What was his name? Hussein bin Tlass. You are Hussein bin Tlass' cousin? And you want a new life in the West? That is our destiny, don't you think? To be something new? Aleppo man, you were not born to be a philosopher. The truck's stopped. Near the Bulgarian border. Tell Zaf to pass them and report what he sees. Right, in the crate. Come on! My father is too ill! Then he should have gone on the Orient Express. Bulgarians... They find you, they not nice... Get him in the crate. Come on! What kind of life will you have in England? Maybe none. We are doing this for a new life. YOU are. What? And you are doing it for death? Why are there so many people like you? Why are you crammed into a crate like this, dreaming of, what? Prostitutes on London streets? Whisky bars? How will you be cured of this poison? Where did you learn to break a man's neck? Aleppo childhood. Why do you think I want to be a civilised man? You think England is civilised? Right... This is a quick break. We're not here long, so hurry up. They're moving again. Do you want me to pass them? No, stay behind. Anything from Adam? Nothing. Stop! Stop! Stop! What are you bunch of clowns playing at? Has he gone and popped it? You're going to have to get him out of there, chuck him. Come on! This boy is this man's son. Well, that's not my problem, is it? Wrap it in that. You've got half an hour. You should go back to Aleppo. Build beautiful buildings. I will. When I am rich. You are like the prostitutes you dream of. You are sneaking over borders into the West to sell yourself. Don't talk to me again. Zaf. Dead end. Repeat, dead end. Zaf's on the satellite link. Put him on, put him on! 'Signal from Adam. 'Repeat, a signal from Adam... ' Dead end. I repeat, dead end. GUNFIRE Bandits. Come on then, move, move! Open... There'snothing... Open the door! You, out! Hurry up! Move! Give us money. I haven't got any! Hurry up! Hurry! We take the truck! No, you can't do that! You people, go! Please, look... Inside, inside. Now, sit down and shut up! We better find the others. Forget them. All that matters is I get to England. Look, better we just walk back into Turkey. Eh? It's a Muslim country. We will get a lift back to Istanbul. No, no, no, aren't men from Aleppo meant to be adventurers? You will help me get to London. But they took our money. We will have to get to the coast. Steal a boat to England. It's possible. Everything is possible. If I'm going to help you, I want to know what you are going to England for. Once you know, you'll be cursed. My people are used to curses. I am from Al Kahf. Help me or you're dead. All right! All right! I've a martyr in my family, remember. I can understand what you want to do. Really? What do I want do? Attack the great Satan of the West. And will you join me in doing that? If you tell me what you're going to do. You'd like me to do that. If we are going to work together. I mean, not, not together, but... if I'm going to help you. Shall we drop our masks? What do you mean? Please... please. You're a spy. British Intelligence? It was the lorry driver, wasn't it? Real bandits would have killed him. We don't kill people. Oh, I forget, your missiles don't kill( ! ) We have Prince Hakim. The prince? Why did you still try and get through? You must have known you were blown. Danger is addictive. Don't we both know that? Are there men in the forest? A few moments away. Call your men then. The Moroccan school bus. You did no harm? You want to discuss the morality of Jihad with me? You will never understand. You wanted to be a doctor. You've taken an oath to do no harm. Call your men. I can make you an offer. I said, call your men! Come and work for us. You'll be the most important agent in the world... a double agent. Which means you get to see both sides, almost like God himself. No. You do it for two years, then you can have any life you want. No, I'd rather choose death. It went wrong, didn't it? The bomb in Morocco. Call your men. After two years, you can have a new name, new identity. You can go back to medicine, finish your training. You can take the Hippocratic Oath. No. You'd rather choose death? Yes. I don't believe you. You see yourself as a healer, don't you? You want to heal the Islamic world. Use bombs as scalpels. Cut the disease of the West away. But it's begun to sicken you and I think, given the choice now, you choose life, not martyrdom. Life... Two years as a traitor... .then I'm free? I believe in the House of Islam. The whole of Arabia united in an Islamic republic. With its government in Damascus. The holy sites protected, America and you out of our lands. And purity... and the rule of God's law giving us peace. It's just... .that I begin to see the suffering. What were you going to London for? To take charge of the Al Kahf cell. You have a cell in London? Ha! You cannot discover it, can you? Yes, there is a brigade of martyrs ready to die in your capital. My name's John Baxter. So, Mr Baxter... . how do you take me to England? Go, go, go! "Toys for the boys"... isn't that the phrase? What are your true feelings about Morocco? I have wept, every night, for the children. HELICOPTER APPROACHES A welcome return. Don't put out the flags. Do you buy Yazdi? I don't know. Some have, hook, line and sinker. Brilliant operation, Mr Carter. It's not over. Yazdi has informed me there's a brigade of Al Kahf martyrs in London, ready for action. Then that... Yes, Miss Shaw, the alert stays. Now please, let us get on with our jobs. Feel wonderfully alive, do you? Like death, actually. Where's Yazdi now? Half an hour from Highbury Fields. The VIP safehouse? I thought, pamper him. I want first crack at him. No. It's my right to quiz him. No, Fiona will do it. He won't be expecting a female interrogator. What we need from him is information we can check out. DOOR OPENS Morning, sir. Please, sit at the table. I want to speak to John Baxter. He knows me. Please... Sir. One-nil to Fiona. Do you have everything you need? I think so. Can't read the body language. Weeping because of what he's done? I don't know. First, I am authorised to thank you on behalf of Her Majesty's Government for your offer of help. I am aware of how deeply painful this must be for you. The pain of apostasy. Of denying everything you have believed in. You have no idea what it is like. Try to tell me. I can't. You're a woman. After you've lived here for a while, you may find that you soften towards us. All I want, after I've worked for you, if I'm still alive... . is to go back to medicine. I've killed. Now I'll heal. John Baxter understands. You were sent to this country by Al Kahf. Yes. For what purpose? To give my life. As a martyr. You were to be a suicide bomber? That is a Western phrase. Where were you to, um, to martyr yourself? In London. What's the target? The House of Commons. How was this to be done? Was? I have to warn you, the attack will happen. Another will take my place. It will be done by boat. On the river. The explosives have been purchased and are being stored. Who is your Al Kahf contact in London? Mr Yazdi, who are you to contact in London? The moment of betrayal. The contact's name is Hussein Hadrami. He lives in Walthamstow. His address is 23 Dunning Street. Go! Go! May God be with him. THEY ALL SHOUT Don't move! Come on, get him out. Nothing? Fifteen hours. Questioned non-stop. Bit of muscle too. Nothing. Not a word. BLEEP 'Harry, Juliet Shaw on line three. ' Harry? The Prime Minister says to abandon Parliament will be a public relations disaster. It could be a bigger disaster! He won't do it. It's the Churchill thing with the PM, Harry. You're going to have to break Hadrami quickly. Adam, you have a go at Yazdi. Treat him as a colleague. Ask his help. Not a word. I wouldn't if I were in his place. Would you? Is there anything you can think of that we could say to him? As one spy to another? Is the phrase, "I have to earn my spurs"? How can we make him talk? You can't. But I could. That would blow your cover. Perhaps things are too urgent. 'I think it's a brilliant idea. ' I'm unhappy. Mohamed Yazdi is fully co-operating! Adam? No. Too dangerous. I think we should do it. Leave us. It's against all interrogation protocol. And this operation is dangerously fluid. Fluid? We have no hard evidence whatsoever of an attack! Well, that's what we are trying to get! What's the matter with you? As security co-ordinator, I insist. Put Yazdi and Hadrami together. Sit down. What's happening? What are they doing to us? You and I have never met. No. Ali Mohamed. But you know who I am. Yes, of course, brother! Then you will trust me. Yes. Then sit down, and listen to everything I say to you. Burn it into your mind... andanswer. The prince warned you I was coming? Prince Hakim of Bahar. Yes. But how can the prince be involved with Al Kahf? He denied knowing anything about them using his network. So he did. The plans for the martyrdom at the British Parliament. They are well advanced? The prince has told you where the explosives are? No. Nor the other members of the London Al Kahf brigade? He insists we act separately. So the prince controls the cell? Yes. But Al Kahf are sworn enemies of the Royal House of Bahar. How can the prince be leading them in London? This is a nightmare. And I suspect we're far from being awake yet. When were you all to be brought together? When you... whenyouarrived. When you arrived to lead us. Here I am. But... but these are British... Secret... Police. Oh, my brother! We live in terrible times. Maybe I'm not your leader any more. No. No, you are a traitor. You have betrayed us. You have betrayed the prince. You have betrayed the Islamic Revolution and you will burn in hell for this. No, I will be in paradise with you. You'll burn in hell for this! How long is this imprisonment to continue? ! We have information that you knew very well Al Kahf were using your Istanbul network. That is nonsense. More, we have information you are actively involved with Al Kahf. And that you were facilitating the organisation of a terrorist attack in this country. Terrorist attack? On the Houses of Commons. I am being totally maligned and slandered! I demand the right to leave this paranoid country at once! As of this moment, Your Royal Highness, you are detained under the Anti-Terrorism Act. You think we are all terrorists, don't you? We are all just wogs to you! Poor immigrant in a truck, prince in the most expensive hotel in London. All wogs! You have no idea of our history! Of what we are! I demand to speak to your Foreign Office and the Bahar Embassy here in London! Now! The prince. Prince Hakim of Bahar. Yes. What did he tell you? He told me... he told me to wait for you. Here I am. But these are British... Secret... Police. Oh ,my brother! We live in terrible times. Maybe I am not your leader any more. You have betrayed the Islamic Revolution and you will burn in hell for this. No, I will be in paradise with you. You'll burn in hell for this! I've been watching the recording of Yazdi interrogating Hadrami. Have you indeed? There's something in his voice. What do you mean? A false note. Doesn't it make you uneasy the way he suddenly fingered the prince? Saving the best nugget till last? As a turncoat he has to sell to us. Maybe. The questions, they're all leading. He's not a professional interrogator. He's telling him what to say. Why? I don't think Hadrami knew about an attack on London. You think he's an innocent? He's like any student who flirts with extreme ideas. He half means it, he half doesn't. But he was an Al Kahf contact. Yeah, but you know what happened. He got sick of the college binge drinkers. The values of Al Kahf attract him, they seem... pure. He gets on their list as a sympathiser and suddenly he's in a room with Yazdi, mesmerised. His brain burned. Good afternoon. I want Yazdi to interrogate the prince. Absolutely not. He was successful with Hadrami. Why do you believe Yazdi? We don't know who to believe. So let's put them in a room together and see. That's unprofessional! Parliament is still sitting and time is running out! We are about to make a terrible mistake. And if I could just sit still for a while, then I would know what it is. I'm overruling you, Harry. I have the authority of the Home Secretary to order that this interrogation takes place. I protest. Noted. Invite Prince Hakim into the room. I have agreed to this to denounce this man. That is why I have agreed to this. Your Royal Highness. Would you please sit. No. Get him out of there! Get him out of there! The body of the Crown Prince of Bahar, Sheik Abd bin Wali al Hakim was today flown back to Bahar City, the capital of his country, by RAF plane from Brize Norton. Prince Hakim died early this morning of a heart attack in his suite at the Regal Hotel, in London. In a personal message to the Prince's father, King Ahmed, the Queen has sent her profound condolences at the loss of his son. I was thinking of... Neitherof us ever, ever resigns. Let's make that a ground rule between us, OK? But it was a disaster. Yes. You're an assassin. Yes. Your mission was to kill the Prince. Always. Why here, why not in Bahar? To send you a message. Have nothing to do with these old corrupt kingdoms. We are going to destroy them. Next we are going to destroy the king himself. The people will rise in a holy war. Al Kahf will lead them to the House of Islam. What did you really think about the children you killed in that school bus? They are in Paradise. You know, in all the countries you terrorise, there's no sign at all of the people rising in a holy war. That is because they are corrupt. All of them? Yes. So, in this republic run by Al Kahf, what would you do with this vast corrupt majority? Re-educate them. And if they don't learn? Kill them? One line about a sexed-up intelligence report nearly brought the Government down. This is a whole book's worth - the story of a lifetime. A very short lifetime if you carry on like this. This could be a disaster. I want the bastards who did this. SCREAMING Putting your life on the line based on nothing more than a guess. Subtitled by BBC Broadcast. Conversion for the forom by reirei. Previously on "commander in chief"... this has footage of nathan templeton at a private fundraiser in 1965. Segregation is the word of god. If the lord almighty wanted colored people to mix with whites, to live with whites, to marry whites, he wouldn't ha placed them on separate continents. I don't believe that tape represents who you are today. It doesn't represent who I ever was. It doesn't have to get out. Why hold it back? Maybe I think the country doesn't need another scandal right now. Maybe you want to have something to hold over my head. I trusted you, jayne. I gave you information from him whenever I could. This time you gave my information to him. Mr. Speaker-- don't! Just get out of here! I don't want to see you again. I'm moving rod into the west wing. Completely your call, ma'am. I would like to welcome rod calloway to our staff. I learned a long time ago, never cross anyone who sleeps with the boss. I'm focused on her new agenda here. You have a white house to run. Run it. We're an independent commission. The goal is to be above politics. Mr. Chairman! Was economic impact a factor in your recommendation? We considered all factors, but our mandate is to provide the best proposals possible to hape the future of our military. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman, you're recommending closure of the essex naval base in connecticut, which could devaste the economy in the president's home state. Has she been consulted? The white house has received our report. And I'm sure that the president and her staff are currently reviewing our recommendations. How did we not know about this? Essex naval wasn't supposed to be on there. It's always in consideration, never makes the list. it made the list this time. It made the top of the list. They close that base, they're going to put over 30,000 people out of work. People that I grew up with. Independent commission means independent of the president,ma'am. It's your state. It's your watch. Thiss tonight's lead story. Just what we need three days before thanksgiving. It's going to be a tricky dance. Either you're heartless to people in your home state, or you're weak on defense across the board. Does no one here care that closing the base might be what's best for the country? No, mr. Vice president, you're the only one that cares about the country. The rest of us are here just for the book deals. Okay, okay, let's focus on options. The best thing for us to do is to remain above the fray. Let it play out. Which means let the base close. We stick our nose in this, we get bloody. And then they'd probably close the base anyway, which will only make us seem ineffective. So it's better to be ineffeive than seem ineffective, right? What a town. Excuse me, everybody. I'd like to introduce richard mcdonald. Dickie, what are you doing here? Jim, nice to see they're keeping the chief of staff in the loop. Mr. Mcdonald, thank you for coming by. It's an honor to meet you,madam president. And kelly ludlow-- veep's director of comm turned white house press sec.-- Meteoric rise. Thank you. We don't want to interrupt. just observing. Don't mind me. We're reviewing options for the essex base closure. And I was saying, as a retired general who once sat on brac, they know what they're doing. Announcing the closure of a huge base in the president's hometown right before thanksgiving. It's a nonpartisan recommendation of what they think is best for national defense. Maybe we should cancel this week's press conference. Just till after the holidays. Let this blow over. I can't cancel my second weekly press conference. Agreed. Rod? Dickie? Yes. Kelly? You have talking options? We didn't know the base was on the list. Don't you always have talking points ready on every option? We're not looking back at what we didn't do, dickie. We're going to look forward to what we can do. The press conference isn't till wednesday. No need to make any announcements yet. Holiday press, weekend reporters, good way to let the story die. 8:45, madam president, you have a working call with the E.U. At 9:00. Okay. We'll get back to this. We'll pick this up. mac, dickie's going to join us in the oval for a few minutes before your phone call. Great. I'd appreciate you letting me know when you're bringing someone new in. It undermines me with the staff if it seems I'm out of the loop. You're right. I'm sorry. I won't let that happen again. Thank you, vince. You're welcome. Vince taylor,dickie mcdonald. Nice work going public on your gay H.I.V. Thing. The president's empathy rating went up four points. Okay, then. Good. Sorry the schedule's tight. you're the president. I'd be worried if it were any other way. Please. Thank you. Rod thinks we need some help. They say you're the best. Your numbers are below where they should be given the circumstances. You're playing defense. We know the critique. What we're looking for is strategy. That's what I do. One question first, are you going to run for reelection? I hadn't really thought about it much yet. we came into this kind of fast. I realize that, madam president, but unless you're going to run, there's not much point in my being here. look, we know that you're mainly a campaign guy, but what we want to start with are image issues, approval numbers-- whether she's running is the image issue. Ma'am, with due respect, you haven't been elected to this position. You've made no indication as to whether you want to be. If you don't start running today, you're a lame duck for the next two years. Ma'am, the E.U. Working group is on the line. Thank you. We'll talk further. To start with, I'd like to know how you'd frame the base closure issue. To be honest, unless you're nning, it's not going to matter what position you take on the bases. It's not going to matter what position you take on anything. Rumor is the president's decided to run. That's your hello? Come on, you guys brought in dickie mcdonald. Like a half-hour ago. Did somebody send up a smoke signal from the R.N.C.? we use instant messaging now. But she's definitely running? If she is, she hasn't told me. What about you? Any progress on the job front? Actually, I found something. K street--gerken and leigh. See, big-time lobbyist. That was fast. Part-time lobbyist. They gave me one client. Said they'd see how I do. Who's the client? B.K. Industries, they do guidance systems for submarines. Let me guess, their biggest contract is with essex naval base? It's the president's home state, and the nation can't afford to give up its edge in naval warfare. What do you need? I want to talk to the president. Come on, jim, I lost my job over you. You owe me. A luncheon speech to the A.A.R.P., Sec-def, 2:15, F.B.I. Briefing, see if you can get templeton in here for a closed door on essex naval. Yes, ma'am. You have the A.A.R.P. Speech to look at on the way? You know mike stanton? we went to law school together. He keeps calling. He says he needs to talk to you. He's representing a linda bodum. I had counsel pull a file. I know the case. She's allegedly retarded, fell in with some lowlife robbing cab drivers. One of 'em died, right? She's on death row in texas. Right, and mike wants the supreme court to hear an appeal based on her diminishedental capacity. And the court announced an hour ago that they are not going to hear her appeal. So what, he wants to come in and get me to commute her sentence? Motorcade's ready, madam president. Thank you. I'll tell him you're too busy. he's a friend. I have to call him back. Just not what I needed today. I'll tell him that you'll call him back next week after the holiday. The supreme court was their last appeal. The execution is scheduled for the day after thanksgiving. She'll be dead by next week. Okay. commander.in.chief. Season 01 Episode 09 It's a bad idea. He's an old friend from law school. I owe him the courtesy of a face-to-face. He's representing a killer who's about to get the needle. A killer with an I.Q. Hovering somewhere around room temperature. If I put his name on the schedule, the entire press corps is going to be all over us. All we'll be talking about is the death penalty. Okay, arrange a drop-by. He gets a tour of the white house, I run into him, we spend a few minutes in private and then it's never on the schedule. In the world of drop-bys, do you remember jayne murray? She's templeton's former chief of staff. She's lobbying for related industries on the base closure. If you could give her five minutes. Of course. Madam president, your mother just arrived at the residence. Thank you, laura. For thanksgiving, right? Must be nice to get a visit from someone who's just here for the turkey. Yodon't know my mother. Mom. Hey! honey. Oh, god. Hi. look at you. You got in early. the escorts used the sirens all the way from connecticut. It was very effective. Where are the kids? still in school. They don't get off for thanksgiving till wednesday. which reminds me... brought your favorite recipes. you know, I think the kitchen staff has that covered. honey, I know how to handle help. Don't worry. They're going to love me. They're not exactly help, mom. I know. They're staff. I understand they're professionals. They're not used to interference, but, honey, I have been cooking thanksgiving dinner for my family for 50 years. It's our tradition, even without dad, and as long as I'm standing, I'm cooking. Okay. I'll do this later. Show me your office. The oval's still the same. I haven't changed anything. yes, you have. You're sitting behind the desk now. you could use more assertive colors in here. redecorating is at the bottom of my list, mom. I'm not talking at all about decor. It's a way to lift your leg and establish your territory. The point is to mark your turf. I forgot how beautiful this woodwork is. Just right in here, mom. All right. Madam president, I'm a little early. Yes. Excuse me. Nathan templeton, mrs. Allen. Hello, mr. Speaker. How do you do? Going to give your mother a tour of the oval office? no, I've already done that with president bridges. I was just walking the president to work. please, don't let me interrupt. I'm early. No, no, I'll wait here while you do your visit. You certainly will not, sir. You have business with the government. Government runs slow. But not because of the president's mother. I'll see you later, dear. Okay. You're makg me feel bad, mrs. Allen. I doubt it. it was a pleasure meeting you, mr. Speaker. And you, and you. And you're much handsomer than your pictures. Your hair is beautiful, just like my husband'S. Mr. Speaker. This is your last chance. excuse me. What were you doing just now? I-I was trying to make friends for you. Mom, I don't need any help with that. The longer we're here, the more he'll think we're talking about him. Go. your mother's very charming. Almost always. she's right. I've never taken a good picture. Are you going back to your district for thanksgiving? No. We're going to stay put this year. You know, the hurricane took the house and... sarah's had a tough week. I'm sorry to hear that. If she's up to it, why don't you join us? It's just the family. Thought it'd be better for the kids than having a big white house affair. No, no, that's your family dinner. There's always room at the table at thanksgiving. That's very kind of you,thank you. I'll... I'll ask sarah, see how she feels. Good. But you didn't call me in to ask us to thanksgiving. No. Please. The essex naval base is a relic of the cold war. Closing it would save the military $1.7 billion in the first year alone. we could cook those numbers any way we want. My people tell me that the domino effect on the economy could cost 2 billion over 5 years. Those are local numbers. The brac report is very clear. There will be no economic impact nationally. This affects my home community, -and you know that. -I do. You also know that essex was never supposed to be on the closure list. I had a deal with president bridges, a deal that you made a promise to honor. I made a promise, a personal promise to teddy, not to you. A community is at stake, a community that I care about, and all I am asking of you is to honor your original position. It's a position that I was compelled to reconsider based on the merits of the report. This is just shuffling military money back and forth, robbing peter to pay paul. No, it's sending money where it's needed. I had a private meeting with the head of the joint chiefs of staff, and he was very forthright. He said that it was critical-- sad, but critical-- that we close these obsolete bases and release those funds for fighter readiness, intelligence systems, homeland security. You really want to make this where we draw our battle lines? You willing to die on this hill? Are you telling me that you're going to take the tape out of the safe and make it public? I have no intention of using that tape. I could fight fair and win. Madam president, I would expect nothing less from you, and yoshould expect nothing less from me. She's really going to see me? Soon as templeton leaves. Templeton's here? On base closure? The important thing is that you're here, right? don't be nervous. Three minutes with her can determine the future of my entire career. Why should I be nervous? Do ask sarah about thanksgiving. We'd love to have you. Yes, I will. Thank you, madam president. Jayne. Jim. Mr. Speaker. Madam president. You remember my former chief of staff jayne murray. Good to see you. You, too. Jayne's just taken a cushy k street job, probably lobbying your man here on the base closings. Ready for you in the roosevelt room, madam president. Thank you. Will you walk with me? actually, we're not quite through. And I need jim for a minute. Walk with us? Sure. Mr. Speaker. Thank you so much for meeting with me, madam president. I'm not meeting with you, I'm walking with you. Walking and chatting, chatting and walking. What would you care to chat about? Essex naval base. we're doing work with certain related industries. Who would take a substantial hit if the base is closed. Undersea warfare can be critical to our survival as a nation. It's not our only undersea base, just the only one your clients happen to have a contract with. I have a brief on the impact of the base closure. Can I put it in your hands? Of course. Can I say I put it in your hands? Of course. Good luck with your new position. Thank you, madam president. Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the united states. She took the brief. I just became the k street lobbyist who put a brief directly into the hands of the president. That's great. do you have a second? Jayne, we can't keep seeing each other. When you were working for templeton, it was barely ethical. Now that you're a lobbyist, it'S... illegal. I know. It was nice for awhile. I can't believe she took the brief. I'm going to miss you. We'll see each other all the time. I'll still miss you. This is chef tom and chef carl and this is chef paul who's the dessert chef. -chef paul,what an honor. -Look at these incredible desserts. Mrs. Allen, hello. I'm nora woodruff. -I'm the first gentleman's chief of staff. -nora. I would be delighted to show you around. The president's mother is going to be cooking thanksgiving dinner, nora. this isn't really a domestic kitchen, mrs. Allen. don't worry, nora. I know my way around btus. I have a restaurant range at hom and I'm sure chef paul will help me. actually, sir-- mrs. Allen's always made thanksgiving dinner for the family, nora. We're not going to mess with tradition. It's just a family dinner. There's no state protocol involved. Would you like place cards written? That would be lovely. and individual menu cards? We have little crystal holders. can you show me those? Right over here. I know when I'm not needed. Now what china pattern do you think we should use, nora? Have you seen the lenox... and right this way, mr. Stanton. The roosevelt room was the original site of the president's office when the west wing was built in 1902. Kennedy kept his fishing trophies in here, didn't he? Watch out, vince. Mike's a kennedy buff. He knows all the trivia. Madam president. Mike. Impressive. I'm sorry I can't show you the oval. I understand. I only have a few minutes. Fine. Come on. This is blackmail. Hold on. Ooh, the old San Francisco Bay. * I see forever now... * What a day, what a day, what a day. * * Oh, baby, baby, baby, make me want to sing to you. * * I'm in the mood to drive across the bridge. * Hey, can I drive? * Oh, baby, * baby, baby. Oh, what a day. It's beautiful. Beautiful. * I've got the world on my side. I want to sing, and I want to dance! Why the long face? Cho Cho, it's just not gonna happen. But you gave me your word. Just sit back and relax, okay? Watch the car. Fine. If you want to leave me alone in a beautiful, primo '69 Cougar with a sports package. Whoa, hold the phone. You don't still think you're coming inside with me, do you? But you're the computer nerd; I'm the people person. But you're not even people. I really think we should talk about this, Fowler. Talk about it? Yeah, all right, we could talk about it. As a matter of fact, talking in the right place could be good. I like my job, Cho Cho. Don't embarrass me. Don't you embarrass me. Hey, it looks like the computer finally paid off. He's got a date. Okay, you can wait for me in the interrogation room. Just don't touch anything, please. Looks like NYPD Blue. Hey, where do they keep the police dogs? You stay put while I check in, okay? 10-4. Criminal who got away? Ex-wife who got the house. Uh! Good news. Just heard back from division. They're approving COLAR for the entire department. No way. Talking about building a new state-of-the-art command center. That's incredible news. Yeah. You'd be in charge of the command center, and I'd be in charge of you. Everybody wins. So make sure and get COLAR's list of possible suspects out to Gerber so we can start making arrests. Well, I haven't quite run that analysis yet, sir. Why not? Well, 'cause I don't think that COLAR has all the proper data. What if I had an eyewitness? Witness? * There's a dog in my interrogation room. Just bear with me on this one. All I want you to do is watch. Watch what? I don't know. How to say this, so I'm just going to come out and say it. That dog, the dog right there in that room, he's gonna... talk. Talk? You mean, you say, "Speak," and he barks. No, no, I say, "Speak," and he speaks, full sentences, subject, verb, object, the whole enchilada. What's up? Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Fowler says this dog is gonna talk. Talk? You mean, like, confess? No. Words. Just need you to go over the facts again about Chin Li. Come on, you remember. Tell me again about the assassins who attacked your master. Come on; you remember how you karate-chopped the one guy and then drop-kicked the other and then you called 911. He's not going to talk without his lawyer present. Come on, Cho Cho, why? What, is it what I said before about getting creeped out when you walk on your hind legs? What? Cho Cho, speak. Come on, Cho Cho. Come on, help me out here, pal. Cho Cho, speak, please. Please, Cho Cho, don't do this to me. Hey, they're making out on their first date. All right, you two. Out of here, both of you. Come on, out. Let's go. Yes, thank you very much. Go on. Hey, Dr. Doolittle, get your butt in here pronto. A dog that called 911? Are you trying to get yourself fired? Traitor. Well, you listen to me, Fowler. Unless you have an eyewitness, one without a tail, I suggest you go back and analyze your data and let real detectives make the arrests. Is that clear? Keep that dog out of my squad room. You did that on purpose. Of course I did. Why? Well, I may be a dog, but that doesn't mean I can't smell a rat. I trust you, Fowler. But this is crazy. You're a dog that talks. This turns theories of evolution upside down. I just wanted them to hear you. I told you I could only speak to the man who seeks the truth. That was supposed to be you. Chin Li was like a father to me, and now they've killed him. He deserves justice. You're right. I'm sorry. What I did was wrong. I'm sorry. Cho Cho, please. Come on, show me some love. One last chance. Shake on it? Shake? Really? Okay. Look, can we continue this in the bathroom? The bathroom? Why? 'Cause I got to take a whiz. Duh. What? Never saw guys taking a leak before? Freaks. Okay. Look, we're partners now, okay? You're not gonna kiss me, are you? I don't know you well enough. Look, just promise me one thing, all right? If we solve this case, you have to let the rest of the world know that you can talk. If we solve this case, I'll sing a love song to a cat in front of the whole squad. All right, we should start our investigation where Chin Li worked... the dog track, Cage's Kennel Club. Uh, uh, I'll make the decisions here. Detective. Is the dog from the crime scene? Yeah, he sort of followed me home. Guess I adopted him. Well, that was very sweet of you. Yeah. So, uh, anyway, I came to apologize. Apologize? Yeah. Most detectives make up their mind before they ever get to the crime scene, but you refused to take the easy way out. I should've backed you up, but I didn't. Oh, pshh, come on, no, no, no. That's, you know... I understand how it is. It's just how things work at the department. Yeah, well, either way, you're the kind of cop I want to be when I make detective. Yeah, well, it'll happen. Mm-mm-mm. I don't know. I'm really good on the streets, but I, uh, I choked on the written exam. Well, maybe, uh, next time, you know, you're studying for the written exam, maybe, I don't know, I could, I don't know, I could help you study, help... Ashley, we got a call. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. I got to go. We'll talk later? Yeah. Are you kidding me? That was your best shot? You didn't even get her phone number. So, uh, what, we going home? Nope, we're going to the races. Oh, that's great. What? Dog asks you to get on the case and nothing. But some tootsie bats her eyelashes and zippedy-doo-dah, you're Dirty Harry. Zip it, Fido. You know, females put out a signal when they're interested. I could smell some major flirtage going on there. Oh, so now you're an expert on romance, huh? This from a species who says, "Hello," by sniffing each other's butts. Oh, sorry, ladies. And now, a fast move by Southern Beauty. Southern Beauty on the outside. If I was a betting man, I'd say Southern Beauty by eight lengths. You've been right all day long, Daddy. Southern Beauty... You did it again. That little puppy's got some... a fire in her. Southern Beauty won again. That's four in a row, Dad. What a surprise, Eddie. Yes, a surprise, Eddie. There's a detective in the kennel... about Chin Li. Uh-huh. Well, bring him up, son. What's wrong with her? And they're off. These muscle-heads are an embarrassment to our race. Well, aren't you being a little catty? Pardon the expression. These dogs are athletes. Chasing an idiotic, mechanical rabbit? They're nothing but puppets of the man. Aw, don't be jealous. I'm sure you could keep up if you dropped a few pounds. Mr. Flower? I'm Detective Fowler. Are you looking for Mr. Cage? Yes. I'm Mr. Cage. You're Mr. Cage? I'm Edward Cage, managing director here at the Cage Kennel Club. If you're looking for my father, he's upstairs watching the races. Okay. Your dog will have to stay here, of course. You stay here, Cho Cho, and be a good doggy. And if you do, you get a little doggy treat. Good boy. Hey, I got a doggy treat for you. Good afternoon, son. Afternoon. I'm Hamilton Cage, and you are? Detective Fowler. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Cage. Uh-uh-uh. Rule you call me Hamilton. Edward you met. My son, my dear son and heir. Want a drink? Oh, no, I'm on duty, thanks. Get him a drink. And this is my little princess. My daughter Margret. President of Research and Development for my largest division, Biotech. And I suppose I should tell you a little tiny something about myself. Son, I was a... Orphaned as a baby. That's right. Educated in the Far East... A PhD in chemistry by the age of 20. You started Biotech Pharmaceuticals which you built into a world leader. Continue. Five years ago, you started Cage Sports Enterprises which includes a pro football team, CSE Sports Channel, and the Cage Kennel Club. Glory Hallelujah, I do so love a man who does his homework. You must be one heck of a detective, son. Aw, shucks. No, just more of an internet geek. Internet geek. That's a good one. Hey, what's with you? Calm down. Hey, over here, big boy. Well, howdy. Hey, that Southern Beauty's a wild one, isn't she? She didn't use to be. But you look like a dog who appreciates a woman with a little spunk. Oh, I do. Uh, tell me, uh... Mary Beth. Mary Beth. I'd like to know everything I can about this track. My mama told me to be careful around dogs who ask too many questions. You always listen to your mama? Practically never. Is there some problem, Detective? No, no, it's just, um, you seem like you're in remarkable shape for man of your... Age? I know you're trying to be diplomatic. But as you can see, good health is not just a business with me. It's a passion. That and the track. Oh, different kind of passion. And most of the credit for the track must go to my dear son Edward, my son and heir. Mmm-hmm. Well, so, if Edward was in charge of the track, he must have been the last one to see Chin Li alive, right? Ohh. What about that, Edward? Chin Li was working the morning shift feeding the dogs, but he was gone by noon. Chin Li was so much more than my friend. He taught me about trust, loyalty, generosity, action, focus. Everything I am today I owe directly to him. Sorry for your loss. Cho Cho. Has anyone thought about Cho Cho? Chin Li had a dog that was very important to him. Do you know where he is? It's funny you should ask. Cho Cho! I got to go. Can we continue this another time? Cho Cho! I've got a flea bath booked at six. Well, then, I'll see you later. Oh, yes. This mongrel was just a pup last time I saw it. We were closest to him in all the world, you and I. I know you miss him every much. Very decent of you to take Cho Cho in, Detective. It was before I found out he never stops talking. Barking. Never stops barking. Cho Cho, sit. My entire organization is at your disposal. I want bolt! - [Horn honking] You're here! Thank the manufacturer! You're alive! - Mack? - You're here! I can't believe it! [Chuckling] You are a sight for sore headlights! I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you! Mack, I, I can't believe you're here. [Harv] Is that the world's fastest racing machine? - Is that Harv? - Yeah. He's in the back. - Show us the bolt! - Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites! - Where's the old McQueen? - Actually, this is my good side here. - Harv! Harv! - Give us the bolt! - Harv? - Come on! - Kid, I'm over here! - How you doin', buddy? My star client disappears off the face of the earth! - How do you think I'm doing? - I can explain. I'm doing great! You're everywhere! Radio, TV, the papers! You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for? That's just a figure of speech, by the way. You signed a contract. Where are you? I can't even find you on my GPS. I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs. - You know Route 66? It's still here! - Yeah, that's great, kid. Playtime is over, pal. While the world's been trying to find you Dinoco has had no one to woo. - Who are they gonna woo? - Chick! Bingo. In fact, check out what's on the plasma right now. - Show us the thunder! - You want thunder? You want thunder? Ka-chicka, ka-chicka! - Hey, that's my bit! - You've gotta get to Cali, pronto! Just get out of Radiation Stinks now, or Dinoco is history, you hear me? Just give me a second here, Harv. No, wait. Where are you goin'? Get in the trailer, baby. Kid! You want a bigger trailer? Sally, I... I want you to... Look, I wish... [sighs] Thank you. Thanks for everything. [Groans, chuckles] - It was just a road. - No. It was much more than that. Hey, kid! We gotta go. Harv's goin' crazy! He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now! - Mack, just... hold it for... - You should go. - I know, but... - Good luck in California. I hope you find what you're looking for. - McQueen, come on! - Sally... - Sally! - Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt! Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt! - Come on, get in the trailer. - Where's the old McQueen? - The bolt! - That's it. That's right, let's go! You're a big shining star. You're a superstar. You don't belong there, anyway. Whoa... Wait... Whoa, whoa, wait, wait! [Engine starts] Hey, guys! McQueen's leavin' in the truck! Hey, are you Doc Hudson? - Yeah. - Thanks for the call. - You called them? - It's best for everyone, Sally. Best for everyone or best for you? I didn't get to say goodbye to him. [Light buzzing] [Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome to what has become, quite simply, the biggest event in the history of racing. A three-way battle for the Piston Cup! [Darrell] There's a crowd of nearly 200,000 cars here at the Los Angeles International Speedway. Tickets to this race are hotter than a black leather seat on a hot summer day! [Bob] The King, Chick Hicks and Lightning McQueen in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all, tiebreaker race. [Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me, but let me tell you somethin'. I never thought I'd see anything like this. This is exciting! [Bob] In fact, the country has almost shut down to watch what many experts are calling "the race of the century." Hey, King! Good luck in your last race. - You've sure been an inspiration to me. - Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it. - Hey, be careful out there, OK? - Yeah, man. [Mia] He's hot! Wanna know the forecast? I'll give you the forecast. A 100 percent chance of thunder! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Say it with me! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Hey, you! No admittance without a garage pass. Oh, it's OK. Lightning McQueen knows me! Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day for a race, isn't it? - Absolutely, Mr. Andretti. - And good morning to you, Fred. Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now! [Guard] Sorry, pal. [Lightning] OK, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed. [Cars whizzing] Victory. One winner, two losers. [Engine rewing] Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed... [birds singing] [Knock on door] [Mack] Lightnin'! You ready? [Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready. [Indistinct chatter] Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today. Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do. After all, "Gas Can" is my middle name. - It is? - Ah... Not really. [All shouting] [Gulping] Uh-oh - [cheering, laughing] - [Giggling] Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16. [Bob] And there he is, Lightning McQueen! Missing all week, and then he turns up in the middle of nowhere! In a little town called Radiator Springs. [Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires, of all things. - Oh! - Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! [Chuckling] Hey, where you been? I've been kinda lonely. Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks. And the twins. Of course. The ones that used to be your fans, but now they're my fans. Listen to what the twins think... Agh! Shoot! [Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys! Let's go racin'! [Crowd cheering] Come on, you can do it! Come on, King, make us proud, boy! [Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King is still holding a slim lead. [Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him! He's lookin' to the inside! Oh! Chick slammed the door on him! [Bob] Chick's not making it easy on him today. [Darrell] He lost momentum, and now he's gonna have to chase him back down! - [Soft music] - [Birds singing] [Breaks squealing] [Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield! [All gasp] [Chuckling] Just me and the old man, fellas. - McQueen just doesn't have it today. - [All laugh] [Groans] - Hey, kid, are you all right? - I don't know, Mack. I don't think I... [Doc] I didn't come all this way to see you quit. Doc? Guys, you're here! I can't believe this! I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad. You said you'd never come back. Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye. Goodbye! OK, I'm good. [Chuckles] All right, if you can drive as good as you can fix a road then you can win this race with your eyes shut. Now, get back out there! Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi! You're goin' up against professional pit crews. - You're gonna have to be fast. - They will not know what bit them! Kid, you can beat these guys. Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back. [Murmuring] - Is it? - Oh, wow. That's him! Is that? That's the Hudson Hornet! The Hudson Hornet's back! [Bob] It appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew. And look who he has for a crew chief! - Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet! - Whoa! Well, dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It surely is. [Crowd cheering] [Bob] Wow, this is history in the making. Nobody has seen the racing legend in over 50 years! Hey, Doc! Come look at this fellow on the radio. He looks just like you. - [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside! - [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down. [Bob] Can he catch up to them with only 60 laps to go? You're goin' great, kid. Just keep your head on. Vai! Vai, vai! Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh? Those round things are called tires, and they go under the car! [All laugh] Con chi credi di parlare? Ma, con chi stai parlando? No! No, no! You'll have your chance. You will have your chance. Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh? What do you think of this? - [Tires squealing] - Yeah, that's it, kid. What? Whoa! Git-R-done! - [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow! - Ah! [Bob] What a move by McQueen! He's caught up to the leaders. Yeah. This is what it's all about. A three-way battle for the lead, with ten to go! [Chortling] Look at that boy go out there! [Chick] Oh! [grunting] No, you don't. [Tire blows] Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat! - Can you get back to the pits? - Yeah, yeah. I think so. Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid. [Mack] We gotta get him back out there fast or we're gonna be a lap down, and we'll never win this race! Guido! It's time. Hey, tiny, you gonna clean his windshield? [Air wrench whirring] [Darrell] I don't believe it! [Bob] That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen! [Darrell] It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car! [Bob] It's gonna be close. - Yeah, baby! - [All hollering] [Darrell] He's back in! Peet stop. - Guido, you did it! - Way to go, Guido! [Bob] This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen is right behind the leaders. What a comeback! [Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine laps! It all comes down to this! This is it, kiddo. You've got four turns left. One at a time. Drive it in deep and hope it sticks. - Go! - [Rewing] We'll see about that! [Bob] McQueen's going inside! - Chick and King are loose! - [Darrell] I think McQueen's out! - McQueen saved it! - [Bob] He's back on the track! - Float like a Cadillac... - Sting like a Beemer! - Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka... - [all cheer] [Darrell] Lightning McQueen is gonna win the Piston Cup! Come on! You got it! You got it, Stickers! [Grunts] I am not comin' in behind you again, old man. - Oh, no! - [Crowd gasps] [Breaks screeching] [Engine idling] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah! [Flo] What's he up to, Doc? [Grunting, moaning] What are you doin', kid? I think The King should finish his last race. You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that? This grumpy old racecar I know once told me somethin'. It's just an empty cup. [Bob] Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal? He's not really pushing' him. He's just givin' him a little bump draft. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hey. What? What's goin' on? - That's what I call racing'. - [Sobbing] [Laughing] [Crowd cheers wildly] - Bravo il mio amico! - Way to go, buddy! There's a lotta love out there, you know, man? - Don't embarrass me, Fillmore. - That's my hot rod. Come on, baby, bring it out! Bring out the Piston Cup! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Yeah! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about! Hey, how come the only one celebrating is me, huh? Where are the girls? Bring on the confetti! Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti. What's goin' on? Come on, snap some pictures. I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco! Say it with me. Ka-chicka! - Boo! - Boo! What's wrong with everybody? Where's the happiness? Hey! This is the start of the Chick era! - Thanks, Lightnin'. - You're welcome. - Way to go, King! - You're still the car! You're The King! Yeah! [Crowd cheers] [Laughing and cheering] - You made us proud, kid! - Congrats on the loss, me bucko! You got a lotta stuff, kid. Thanks, Doc. Hey, Lightnin'. How 'bout comin' over here and talk to me a minute? Son, that was some real racing' out there. How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco? But I didn't win. Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racing' than just winning'. [Clank] He was so rusty, when he drove down the street - buzzards used to circle the car! - [All laugh] Thank you, Mr. Tex, but but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break. I'm gonna stick with them. Well, I sure can respect that. Still, you know, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know. I sure appreciate that. Thank you. Actually, there is one thing. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Hey, look at me! I'm flyin', by golly! I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park! I think it's about-a time we redecorate. Hi. Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires. How 'bout setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each? Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store. A real Ferrari! Punch me, Guido. Punch me in the face. This is the most glorious day of my life. Wow. [Italian] Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda. Mi dicono che siete fantastici. - [Sighing] - [Engine rewing] [Both chuckle] Just passin' through? Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile. - I hear this place is back on the map. - It is? There's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar is setting up his big racing headquarters here. Really? Ah, well, there goes the town. You know, I really missed you, Sally. Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and, - blah, blah, blah. - [Lightning chuckles] McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree, K- i-s-s...uh... i- n-t! Great timing, Mater! Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee! He's my best friend. What're you gonna do? So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys? I don't know. Why don't we just take a drive? Hmm... Nah. Yeah! Ka-chow! [# John Mayer: Route 66] [Yelling] [Sirens blaring] [Sniffing] Ah-choo! [Mater] All right, everybody please keep together now. We is now entering the Doc Hudson wing of the museum. Wow. Unbelievable. That many wins in a single season. He's the real deal, Junior. The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration. Excuse me, son. Is Doc Hudson here today? Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc went out for a drive or somethin'. - [Lightning] Whoo! Whoo! - [Doc] Yeah! Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy. Not today, old man. I know all your tricks. [Growls] Doc! Doc! Whoo-ah! [Doc] Not all my tricks, rookie! [All grumble] [Cheering] Attention! Kiss the pavement goodbye. When I'm finished, you'll have mud in places you didn't know you had! - Yo, I've never been off-road! - Well, that's gonna change right now! About face! Drop and give me 20 miles! Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Go! Man, now I got dirt in my rims! - [Pole hits metal] - Huh? Look at this! It's my hood! It's my hood! I ain't seen this thing in 20 years! Well, it fits perfectly. How do I look? Ah-choo! Oh, dang. You are a toy car! You are a sad, strange little wagon and you have my pity. Farewell. [Woody Car] Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, you loony! Hey, I hate to break up the road rally, guys, but they're here! Birthday guests at three o'clock! [Chuckling] Oh, man! Whoever does the voice of that piggy truck, I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor! We're banished, genius! Stuck here in this wasteland without chains! But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble! She needs our help! - You're still not listening! [gasping] - Ah! Welcome to the Himalayas! Snow cone? Oh, that Abominable Snowplow is quite the comic thespian! Just get in there. Go! Go, go, go! Circus cars? How can you be circus cars? These are the lousiest circus cars in the world, and they're gonna make me rich! Wait a minute here. They're just usin' the same actor over and over. What kind of a cut-rate production is this? [# Brad Paisley: Find Yourself] [Minny moaning] Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we please ask someone for directions? No! There's an on-ramp close! I know it! I can feel it! Buon giorno, Norm. Cliffie. Yeah. - Kind of bright out there today, huh? - Yeah, I wouldn't know. Yeah. I feel sorry for all those people that have to squint. Say, Cliff, those wouldn't be new glasses, would they? Oh, hey, you noticed, huh? Yeah, Italian imports. Sixty-five smack-a-roonies. That's right. Notice the sleek, European styling there, the sturdy reinforced frames, and the hi-tech, shatterproof reflective lenses that allow me to scope out the dollies without drawing attention to myself. You could walk up to them naked with your hair on fire and not draw attention to yourself. Yeah? What would you know? They only work on women. You! They seem to have given you courage. - Prove it. - Well, what do you mean? Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing a little demonstration myself. - So... - All right, all right. All right. All right! You've got the shades. What are you worrying about? Excuse me. Oh, perfect! Thanks. Well, I don't care what anybody says, we had better chatter out there. Shut up, Cliff. Sounds suspiciously as if there is no joy in Mudville. Who gives a damn? We lost. We didn't lose. We got dumped on. We were dragged by our noses through the dung heap. They ripped out our guts, held them up for us to see, and then they rammed them down our throats. It's a grand old game. Damn! Now I know why they weren't afraid to let me play. They were great out there. They were like the '27 Yankees. He's exaggerating. There were only nine of them. Come on, guys. We can't just sit around crying in our beer here. - Norman's right. - We don't have any. Come on, Diane, step on it, will you. I feel a tear welling up here. What the hell? First round on the house. Hey, Sammy! Yeah, well, if you think I'm drinking with you guys, you're nuts! I'd rather drink with those snail pellets from Gary's Old Towne Tavern. - At least they're winners. - That really hurts, Carla. Hey, really, I don't think we played so bad, you know. - Listen to Mr Gold Glove over here. - Come on! Yeah? You drew more flies than bad liver. Oh, give me a break! The only thing more amazing than that was you dropped every one of them. Come on, will you. I just have a little problem with balls hit directly at me. The... I think it's probably the sun, you know, or that I can't bend over. Poor Norman. Well, at least some of us looked good out there, huh? Yeah, Cliff, the less of your face showing, the better. Oh, listen to yourselves. You're letting a minor setback in some trivial competition ruin what is an otherwise lovely day. Forget it, Sam. You just don't get it, do you? It's not just that the guys from Gary's beat us at basketball, volleyball, darts and every other sport known to mankind. It's more than that. I'm a jock. This is a jock bar, but if we keep losing, all the jocks are gonna say, "Hey, Cheers is for losers. Let's go drink over at Gary's." Oh, they'll never say that. They'll say, "Me no like Cheers. Let's go to Gary's." Gentlemen of Cheers. And ladies. - Tough game out there today. - What are you doing here? Boy, you guys have the worst luck. Yeah, it looks like it just followed us home, huh? Listen, we were over having a celebration at my little tavern and I kept thinking, "Something's missing." It wasn't as happy as it usually is when we beat you. And then I realized what it was. I didn't get a chance to thank you guys for the game. So I came over here to do it now. Way to go. The pop-up king. Many thanks. Great glasses. This is what I was afraid of. Hard feelings. What are you talking about? You guys have nothing to hang your heads about. You played hard. You played clean. You gave it your all. Just remember, it takes two sides to make a victory. One side to win and you guys. Excuse me, but you've obviously come here to belittle my friends. Why? I can only speculate. Perhaps you're compensating for some physical shortcoming. I don't know. But it's tragic that you place such stock in a silly competition. What of higher attainments? What of loftier pursuits? What of art? And philosophy? What of music? I graduated magna cum laude in American Literature from Princeton. Oh? Couldn't make summa? Hey, look, Gar. You only came here to rub our noses in it. You've done a great job. Mission accomplished. Now why don't you take off. - Yeah, take a hike. - Sam, I came here in the spirit of sportsmanship. I'll show you sportsmanship. People! People! This is neither the time nor the place for such childish behaviour. Yeah, let's save it for when we kick his butt. In what? We're kind of running out of sports, aren't we? Well, it's really been a truly enjoyable afternoon. Gentlemen, ladies. - See you. - Hey, hey, hey. Listen, I'll have you know that I'm putting together a team right this moment, that's gonna have you shaking in those shoes of yours. Hey, those are nice. Well, thanks. And is that a challenge? - Yeah. - In what sport? I'll tell you in what sport. In... - Bowling. - Yeah, bowling. Great! I've knocked down a pin or two in my day. - When and where? - Well, I'll just let you know. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Okay. - Okay! - Okay! - Okay! - Okay! - Okay! Bowling? Don't worry. I got this theory, Sam. You see, all of those other sports required real athletic ability, but with bowling, we got the makings of a great team! - Oh, Carla, I... - Oh, listen, listen! You go to any bowling alley, what do you see? A bunch of out-of-shape couch potatoes who do nothing but sit around and swill beer. All right, we're number one! Back so soon from the sport of the great unwashed? How was the audition? Tryout. Diane, in sports, it's called a tryout. - We got a team. - Yeah, of what, I'd like to know. I'm gonna call Gary and call it off. I'm telling you, when one lousy bar can't produce four decent bowlers, it's time for America to take a long, hard look at itself. Hey, you! You don't know anything about bowling, do you? Hey, Woodhead I asked you if you know how to bowl. You have bowled, haven't you? - Yes. - When? - When? - Before. - Before what? - Before I came to Cheers. You're good, aren't you? I won a couple trophies. Sammy. Sam, Sam, don't-- Don't call it off! What? What? Hold on a second. - We got a ringer. - Got a what? We got a ringer. Woody. Woody is a bowling machine. Trust me. He's got a room full of trophies. Hey, Gar. No, we're not wimping out. Yeah, tomorrow. Vic's Bowl-A-Rama. We rumble. Okay! Okay! - All right, Woody! - Woody! Please don't ask me to bowl. I can't. Why not? The tragedy. - Well, what tragedy? - What tragedy? Once I maimed a man in a bowling accident. I'll never bowl again as long as I live. Great idea, Sam. Bowling. Okay, it's time to go. Let's see if we can, you know, maybe somehow manage not to embarrass ourselves. Ladies and gentlemen, Knute Rockne. Come on, let's go. I wanna warm up. Hold on a second, guys. Say, Woody, it's still not too late to change your mind. Don't you understand? I maimed a man. Bowling accidents happen. You read about them in the paper all the time. He was only an innocent maintenance man. Come on, man. He knew the risks. I still don't know what happened. One minute, I was picking up the eight-ten split, and the next thing I know, the ten pin flies and hits old Sully right between the eyes and he goes down like a sack of wheat. Sam, I ruined the man's life. I'm sure you're exaggerating. Oh, no. No, I'm not. Old Sully got too dim-witted to stay in bowling maintenance. Last I heard, he was a clown at children's birthday parties. - Well, what's wrong with that? - He wasn't invited to them. Come on, Woody. Listen, man, I've never begged for anything in my life that I actually enjoyed once I got it. Come on. Please. Come on, join the team here. We need you, Woody. Come on. I can't! Since the accident, I haven't been able to set foot in a bowling alley. Well, why don't you just try it today. Maybe the memory's faded. - You don't understand what's at stake. - Can't you hear me? No! Sammy, I'll take a crack at him here. Listen to me, all right? Now, every once in a while you just gotta look beyond yourself, okay? And think about the team. Like my old high school football coach used to always say: "Give the ball to Peterson. He'll know what to do with it." Well, hey, I didn't want that responsibility, but for the good of the team, you understand, I took it. We went ahead and we had a great season. - Were you the fullback? - No, I was the equipment manager. - But that's not my point. - Oh, come on, Norm. You're wasting your breath. He ain't bowling. All right, think about that, Woody. Go team! Yeah! Not too shabby. Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! - Old Towne Tavern! - Quiet, you guys. Let's show our worthy opponent a little courtesy. Back off, buster, or I'll put Vaseline in your finger holes. Just try to touch my ball. I'm talking about your nose. - Choke on it! - Choke on it! You got the cheering under control. I'll mosey up to the bar for a beer. - You're gonna miss the game, Norm. - Then that's a perfect plan, huh? Hey, Cliffie, how're we doing here? Fifty pins down, sinking like a stone, Sammy. Norm! How the hell they know him here? He's got a life, you know. That's all right, man. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, Tawny, has anyone ever told you you make even bowling shoes look sexy? Don't you ever stop? You're fraternizing with the enemy. No, I'm just trying to distract her here so she won't know what to do. A little wink, a sexy nod, and a glimpse of these taut athletic buns. Oh, wait a second here, Tawny. Oh, what's this? I think your butt needs a tune-up. - Sam. - Hey, what're you doing here? I'm here as a driver only, but I brought someone with me who'd like to bowl. - Woody! - Woody! Hey, time out, Gary. - Who's taking care of the bar here? - Oh, don't worry. We closed it. We would have been here sooner, but it took a while to get those people out. Oh, well, great. Yeah. All right, go get some shoes on here. Woody! - What made him change his mind? - I don't know. He was right in the middle of doing something and he said, "l can't let the guys down. Let's go." Hey, Woody! How are we gonna do this? We've already started here. Cliff, what about your wrist injury? - What injury? - Don't make me hurt you. Easy, easy. Gary, we're gonna need an injury substitution here. Hey, you got it. The one thing I've never been called is unfair. I can believe that's the one thing you've never been called. All right, I'm gonna go fire Woody up here. The alleys. Thanks. It's really a sensory experience, you know. The scent of Aqua Net on a beehive hairdo. The roar of polyester against old Naugahyde. The sight of a cigarette stubbed out in a patty melt. All this, plus the anticipation of placing your feet in shoes only 7,000 others have worn before you. Woody! Yeah! All right! Let's go! Listen, if this is gonna be tough on you, I want you to know that you don't have to do this. No, I want to, Sam. You're absolutely sure? Oh, I'm sure. You all have been like family to me. I love you guys. Okay, all right, Woody. - Watch this, Gar. - Yeah. If you're having second thoughts, that's okay, pal. No, no, I want to do this. - Okay, I'm ready. - All right. All right. - Woody? - I wanna do this, Sam. Remember, I love you guys. I'm ready, Sam. It's okay, Woody. I'm gonna bowl. I don't know what I was worried about. This is easy. Those guys are dead meat. You know what I'm saying, Sam? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! - Hey, nice game, Sam. - Oh, get out of here. We said two out of three, and we're taking you to the wall. That's right! All right, all of you in favour of saving what shred of dignity we have left and sneaking out of here, raise your hands. That's one... Hey, how come you voted? You're not even playing. I thought we were ordering pizza. Sam, we can't quit. Listen, Sam, maybe we can sweeten the pot a little. - Get out of here, will you. - No, no, no. If you guys win, I'll set you up with Tawny. Maybe we can talk. And if we win, you set me up with the Sweetheart of Sigma Chi. Excuse me. I didn't date Sigma Chis. I was Phi Epsilon Delta. You girls had quite a reputation. Yes, for academic achievement. Is that what it was? Tell me, isn't it true that Phi Epsilon is Greek for "Hi, sailor"? Give me your shoes. Give me your shoes. - Oh, Diane, are you bowling? - Yes. - Come on. Well, are you any good? - Yes. And if you whisper a word of this to anyone who matters, I'll find you and I'll kill you. Did you think I came by my utter contempt for the sport by accident? Hardly. I took it in college. - You bowled in college? - Yes. I needed the PE credits. I could read between frames, and you didn't have to run. I spent six semesters sweating in a tawdry bowling alley. Bowlers don't sweat. They do when they're wearing tweed. In spite of my complete disdain for the experience, I have no intention of letting this lvy League lounge lizard insult me and my sorority sisters and send Cheers to ignominious defeat. Your mama! Chambers! Chambers! Chambers! Chambers! Chambers! - Chambers! Chambers! - Thank you! Thank you! Now put me down! I'm afraid of heights, and someone has very cold hands. Okay, everybody, line up. I'm pouring beers. I gotta hand it to you, Whitey. For once, you did something that didn't make me wanna shove a rat in your mouth and sew your lips shut. Such praise. I blush. - Congratulations, Sam. - Yeah. Thank you. Oh, excuse me. Continue celebrating. Huzzah, huzzah. - It was a great win, wasn't it, Sam? - Yeah, it was. - Thanks to you. - Oh, don't thank me. I've been amply rewarded just seeing how well you're taking this. The old Sam Malone would have died before letting a woman salvage his athletic pride. - You've grown. - You know something? I think I have. Oh, by the way. Tawny wasn't the only one looking sexy out there in bowling shoes. Well, thank you. No, oh, no, no. I was talking about me. You know, I'm surprised you didn't mention something. No, seriously, seriously. Great form out there. - Thank you. - No, no, I was still talking about me. All right, all jokes aside here, thank you very much for helping me beat Gary. Well, I was getting tired of listening to some ignorant blowhard take himself and some stupid competition so seriously. Boy, he really does that, doesn't he? No, I was talking about you. Subtitles by MACTwolf. City Worker 1: Is that why they need more juice?

Dick: I'm listening and it has me terrified. Hayes– Miss Nance. Twelve more. there's lots of time Rita Man would he? Billy: Eighty-three? Eighty-three. You sold eighty-three tickets to the company picnic? Who to? Friends. Eighty-three friends? I don't even know eighty-three people. for x-rays. but we're not sure he was standing in the right spot. but... Company activities? All he's interested in is winning that free trip to Hawaii.

It is horrendous. It's horrendous they were counting on me. they're counting on me. If anything happens tonight – if anything spoils this exhibit – it'll–it'll–this'll mean my career. stop talkin' like that now. huh? tell you what. okay? Yeah? One is that you buy a couple picnic tickets from me. -That's blackmail. And two is that you bring someone else in here who has seen– I think I just saw a girl run into a sewer. or is that too wild? huh? I–I can't. You have to have the invitations strictly come from the board–the bo– Richard. Mr. Buchre here buys a couple picnic tickets and we'll call it a deal. and that includes the keg race in the potato sack. It's a crazy time he would certainly buy a ticket. He would certainly– a thirty million dollar treasure don't you think? Do ya? You should talk to my accountant. now the state won't let me sell it. Historical artifacts". from all that work? and the stupid headaches like this that come from exhibiting it. Flaming mole monsters". I'd forget it. So I guess that's a "No" on the tickets? Is this the same girl you were talkin' about last week? she's driving me crazy. she dances. It's not like she's shy or anything. she's gone. Down into a manhole? It's the only place I can figure. I could never get near a place like that. Billy! It is a tunnel. This is a tunnel. It's a sewer and I'm not staying! babe. just think of this as a new life experience. Okay. I've seen it. I've smelled it. And I don't need it! Gloria. No passing on this ladder. Alright. See? you know. I certainly hope the board appreciates what I'm doing There are no monsters down here. We will verify the fact that there are no monsters and I will get back to my... he'll take care of it. Rats? ! everybody ready? Rats? ! Ho! no. It's–it's perfectly al– I–I thought I left my keys– Oh!

I think so. we find them in nature and we've seen them in the Museum of Natural History. just– Even though they're filthy... Another life saved. here. Let's just see if this works. Eveready kid. Alright. does anyone else have the feeling that we're being watched? okay? El: Uh oh. Smells like something was burning here. Look. here's the flaming part of what those guys saw. Well. What about the monster part? too much further away. ho. Whoa! Hey! Gloria. Glo! Remind me not to jump out at your surprise party. You tripped it when you walked by. kids. so much for the mole monsters. Now can we get out of here? Wait a minute. This means there's somebody down here and personally I'd like to find out who B-Man's right. we might as well see what we can find. It's getting late. I'm gonna remember this! I'm never gonna forget it. Billy: Anyone feeling lightheaded? there's a light up ahead. I think we've seen enough. it's –the air down here is getting a little hanky. I think I'll take an air sample. And I think I should go back. Fine with me. over here! kid! Wait a minute! kid. It's okay. No one's gonna hurt you. Just take it easy. Just take it easy. You' re gonna be alright. is he okay? that's it! Everyone's out of here. We gotta get him where he can breathe. Is he gonna be okay? He's gonna be fine. He has a little pulmonary distress. Probably from breathing the bad air down there. ya know? about mole monsters? I–I think you're clear on that. I'm grateful. I want to thank you all for coming on down here then– right? Yeah? no. I'm just gonna ride with him. Jane's gonna meet us down there. I'll see you later. I brought your Walkman. a runaway? What else? Kid had the tunnel set up pretty well. Except for the air. Better hope nobody else is holed up down there. What? she's pretty cute. She's probably been watching me. I–I went over there. I don't think that's the right approach. The man's an animal. or something? but you're not in my plans. Not in your plans? You don't even know me! Right. Alright. My name's Johnny– and now has electrical problems with his amps. huh? gotta go. what's your name? Don't have one. Would you cut the bull and give me a straight answer? You have a strange way of getting a girl's attention. Gina. Pay the bus fare and I'll let you sit next to me. goldies 'What'd I say' Here comes Johnny singing 'I got a woman' trying to make it pay he got the motion the boy can play devotion Turning all the nighttime into the day He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman He do the song about the knife he do the walk of life Here comes Johnny with the power and the glory Backbeat the talkin' blues he got the motion the boy can play devotion Wanna help me find somethin' classy? I'm goin' to a party tonight. hold this. What d'ya have in here? The London Philharmonic? that's my life. Jeez. What are you doin'? I gotta try it on. Out here? Do you see a dressing room? I like it. It's fabulous! Aren't you thrilled? Oh yeah. Does it make you nervous? Richard. You mustn't let it. the security here is tremendous. Absolutely bomb proof. Ah! Thank you. mate? Of course. Can I ask you to hold down the fort for a while? I've got a few things to check on. Al. the poor guy's up in the air. El: Of course he is. He's floating. not MacGreve. I'm talking about Buchre. The guy's got thirty million in treasure he can't sell. It's just sittin' there in front of 'im. Kind of like me and these picnic tickets. Dr. Hayes. Herb just called and bought eighteen tickets. I'm taking him bowling. don't you think bribing the ticket buyers is a little out of line? Miss Nance? Do I know a Herb? El: The Invisible Man. Oh. Bowling. Could be interesting. I don't care where you live. I just think you should know that it's dangerous down there. What are you talking about? Where? In the tunnels. what is it with you and this tunnel fixation? We just pulled a kid out. I mean– couldn't we stop talkin' tunnels and start talkin' records? Records... An antique. Want one? Could you buy me Sting instead? Aww. You're a killer. Jane: Do you think that you could give me just a little hint of where you're from? No words. Just nod your head. Okay? Los Angeles? San Fernando Valley? Northern California? huh? He's been out on his own for a while. He just doesn't wanna trust anybody. I didn't wanna trust anyone either when they sent me to you. Do you remember how I broke the ice? Food. I figured that was it. I had to take mine. It was 'no relationships' from then on. and Gina went solo. Doesn't it get a little lonely? but you don't get hurt. Uh. I'm not here to hurt you. Hey. How 'bout an ice cream sandwich? Yeah. Okay. Let me get two ice cream sandwiches. Thanks. tell him I went looking for that girl. man. How ya gonna find out where she lives? I have a hunch it's somewhere near the museum. 'The Museum'. I thought the Museum was in New York. this pâté is wonderful. It's like velvet. Like mole velvet. I'm gonna take a piece of this for Al. Has anybody seen Al Buchre? He's gotta taste this. Al? Excuse me. I'm looking for the kid who was brought in from the Museum today. Just follow the girl with the pizza box. I don't wanna crowd 'im. and tell him it's from Gina? Oh! And one more thing. My mother's checking in soon for an operation. Do you have any rooms on this floor with a shower? Three-forty-one's empty if you'd like to check it out. thank you. mate. How many guards? Ten. Maybe twelve. Scamper like the rest when the tunnels go. make sure those valves are all the way open. How are they holding the gas? Well enough to panic five or ten city blocks. Providing some Jacks from maintenance don't set off another tunnel on their own. We should be okay as long as there are no more surprises like that bloody kid. but don't bother checkin' it out with juvie hall or foster homes. I made it up. Zack? I asked you if you lived down there. okay? you do need our help if you live down there. The air's bad. Really bad. Just the last day or so. We can handle it. 'We'? Who's 'we'? are there more of you living down there? you don't have to be afraid of us. I don't bite. she does. ladies. now this. Supposed to say it's from Gina. Gina! Gina! do you really think there are other people down there? -No. -Yes! whoa. Wait a minute. Let's pick one. I can tell when a kid's lying. I can tell when a kid's kicking. we gotta do something. are you okay? couldn't be better. what was that? Great. I finally isolated the gas that's in those tunnels. What is it? Methane. Girls? How'd you like to crash a party? Thank you. miss? Yes? Your invitation. Do you mean we were supposed to bring them? How gauche. Celebrities. We were simply interested in the technology. come here and take a look at this. Let's take a look at this goblet. This goblet alone is worth over six thousand dollars. Mr. Buchre would know. he's not here. He jus–he keeps disappearing. if you're doing all of this just for the hors d'oeuvres. this could be an emergency. I know– ya know? it's not gonna be that snobby. I know what's going on at these places. bud? the service entrance is around the back. I don't think you understand. We're– Psst! Come on! these people need us. good. I'm so glad you're here. The leaky toilet's in the second-floor men's room. Hayes. Jane. okay? is that you? we need some more sandwiches here. Thank you. but isn't that pushing it a bit? psst! What? Come on. What? What is it? You're not gonna believe this. I couldn't find Richard anywhere– Thanks. But I did see that wannabe that was flirting with Johnny B. they're terrific. The ones with the little red balls on top. I don't like caviar. Don't you think it's a little strange that she's here? What caviar? The little balls on top of that are red. it'll be all right. Salmon caviar's red. El. They use 'em as bait. Wha–what're–what're these little rice cakes with the yellow gooey stuff on top? What is that? There you are. I've been looking all over for you. The bathroom is– It's a long story Hayes? Richard. Methane? I told the bartenders only to serve– Richard. Methane. It's a gas. A what? It's a flammable gas. Do ya remember what happened in the Fairfax district? boom! The whole thing went. That was methane? the concentration under here could be higher than Fairfax was. This is something we should report right away. and now methane. Who the hell are you? Glo: He wasn't home. I talked to one of the guys in the band. Yeah? he went into the tunnels looking for that girl. Looking for Gina. if he even sparks– Don't tell me! Bukowski. You know 'im? what's he doing here? What are we going to do with him? That's the question. Leave him. but killing' a fella... Syl? Thirty million dollars. Is he worth it? Let's just finish what we came here to do. Right. and then get out of here. Gina! we've been looking all over for you. look. So I don't have an invitation. You wanna throw me out? we're friends of Johnny B. fast It's very dangerous for him to be down there. Unh-uh. You are talking to the wrong person. you've gotta understand what we're trying to tell ya here. too. but we have a feeling there are more of you. Wha? Who are you? Where's Gina? The air's better in here. You'll be okay. You're the guy in the band that plays in that garage on Hudson. Gina took me last week to listen to ya. You're good. Thanks. Wher–do ya know where she is? I think. they're all swimming around in a sea of methane down there. With a human sparkler. one spark from Johnny B and we're talkin' the Fourth of July here! Those guys in masks! spraying for cockroaches or something. Whoa! What guys in masks? Does she live here? you know? Mama Gina. Yeah. it's a lot better than livin' on the street. Or where the County put us. And that kid we pulled out this morning? Zack? Is he okay? We wondered what happened to 'im. he's fine. we won't be if we stay here very much longer. just forget about gettin' out. but we can't get far enough through the tunnels. so we just figured we'd ride it out. I don't think that's a very good idea. I can feel the gas comin' in please. Right this way. I–I found him. Here he is. Richard's filled me in on this methane stuff and I think it's ridiculous. You're making a big deal out of nothing. You always have methane under the city. Methane that's being pumped in? What? bleeding tanks into the tunnels. They're probably just city employees. El: Are you willing to take that chance? and someone – or something – sparks Boom! Boom? - Boom! - Boom! Al: Alright. Wait a minute. let's at least do it right and call the professionals. Would ya feel better if I called the fire department and had them check it out? That's a start. Good. Isn't he terrific? He's terrific. methane rises. I'll be back with some help as soon as I can. man. It's eight blocks to the nearest grate. Watch me. you're gonna stay right here until the authorities arrive. Do you understand? an–and some of the ones with the little squiggly Spam stuff on top. That's liver. Pâté. there are hundreds of tunnels down there. anyway? With Gina. where'd she go? Goon: They told you to call the fire department? That's great! Are you ready? we're ready. Will you be around soon? Al: I'm leaving right now. They'll make the big bang in... ten minutes? Right. Gina! They told me you were down here. I didn't believe 'em. we gotta get out of here. I got some people I gotta see. I was just there. You'll never make it. there's no air. We gotta get help. I don't need help. What are you so afraid of? you can't live your life solo. okay? they start screwing' up your life. I'm not–I'm not talkin' about a relationship here. I'm talkin' about getting me out of this tunnel so I can get some help for your friends. but it doesn't for me. Forget it. I don't need help either. I gotta get them out of there. Help me. Richard. The tunnel entrance in the basement's filled with gas. We'll say we got a big firecracker. what can I say? ! How'm I gonna break it to everyone? Everybody get outta here! There's gonna be an explosion! Get out! Richard. we gotta go back. You are not going anywhere. we gotta do something. We gotta get 'em outta there. Okay. I'll take ya. Blasting caps. Timers. I found 'em. There hafta be more. Does yours say the same as mine? Five and a half minutes. if–if you would. I'm–we're gonna do this again. everybody hurry right along. you can't take another trip down there. Look at you. let's go. Come on Gina B-Man. Come on. I'm fine. Gimme a mask. come on. Here's to the end of an otherwise fabulous career. fast. Gina: Here. there's no time. Gina. is there any kind of large opening out of these tunnels? serve as a safety valve if it explodes. not very big. there's a fountain! About a couple hundred yards from here. it's always locked up tight. Which way? You won't have time. Which way? Down that tunnel. okay? We're gonna check out the fountain. we're running out of time. I–I gotta find my bag. Go on. Al: The explosion'll take out the tunnels and bring real fire trucks so you'll blend right in. We go straight for the treasure? no looking around. And the alarm system will get knocked out? Sure. mate. Piece o' cake. shake it up! This is it. This has to be the fountain entrance that Gina was talking about. Locked! They're always locked! There's no hole? ! I thought we needed a hole? ! that would just leave the floor of the fountain. And that oughta come off like a piece of paper when the thing explodes. El? El: I don't think we're gonna live long enough to make the calculations Maybe. we gotta get inside. Can you do it? I think I can fit through here. My clothes are in the lunchbox. Here ya are. Here goes. Hit it. the methane'll blow right through the fountain. It's the course of least resistance. what moves these doors? What? What moves these doors? I'm still lookin'. we're getting a little short– El. A couple of big motors – too big for me to start. The best I can do is short the locks. Whoa! we're almost there. where's Gina? Lookin' for her bag. You guys go ahead. let's get outta here. it won't move. They're frozen. Glo. don't give up now. okay? Let's give it a try. One more. Come on. they're going. Billy! Billy! Glo. let's go. I got one last little detail to take care of. get outta here! Al? Richard. Foul play. Just what I needed. this belongs to you. it belongs to the government and I'm gonna be a little too frail to enjoy it by then. This way I get the jewels and the insurance now. Richard You're going to regret this. you're gonna regret this more than I do. Not really. I ju– I've called the police. And they're gonna jump out of their hiding places and yell "Freeze"? Hopefully. Freeze! Johnny: Gina! we gotta get outta here. Come on. I think this is a good time to stop and–and reconsider the purchase of just a few more of these picnic tickets. they're only two-fifty apiece. and I think Hawaii would be a great–would be a great release. And I got all Don Ho's hits – I bought all of his greatest hits. And I love those–the–the drinks with the blue and yellow– I–I– get with it! I just don't understand it. Company picnic. Good times. I called everybody I know. everybody I ever heard of. And Miss Nance– Hayes. Even I bought tickets from her. you bought tickets from me. only two. uh... Where are the girls? they're late aren't they? They're with my date. You have a date? Gina. (Girls chatting outside) We are ready. an experimental project for street kids sponsored by Social Services. Alright. but you can broom the idea they're sitting on us or anything. and a fancy new name. unique way. let's grab this stuff and go hit some homeruns. Right! Doctor Hayes? Miss Nance... would ya? sorry. I'm already taking Barry. And Herb. Barry and Herb? But there're only two tickets. Miss Nance? Herb!

RUN OFF TO THE BIG CITY TO BE A STAR. W-WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? CALL YOU UP AND SAY, "HEY! GUESS WHAT? YOU'RE A DAD. COME BACK AND MARRY ME."

I'M NOT EVEN ASKING THAT WE STAY IN TOUCH, I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. MICHAEL, MAY I... TELL YOU THE ONE TRUTH I'VE LEARNED IN ALL MY YEARS? THE TRUTH... IS WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO BELIEVE. WHEN I'M ON STAGE, PEOPLE BELIEVE I'M DIVINA DEVORE. NOT BECAUSE I'M A GREAT FEMALE IMPERSONATOR, BUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO. WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH WHETHER YOU'RE MY FATHER, O-OR IF MY MOTHER LIED TO ME? YOUR MOTHER... GAVE YOU SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN. A HERO. A FATHER YOU COULD BE PROUD OF. BECAUSE SHE LOVES YOU. THAT'S THE TRUTH. WHETHER YOU CHOOSE TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT... IS UP TO YOU. [ Sighing ] STILL HERE? SO, HOW DID I DO? NOT BAD... FOR YOUR FIRST TIME. BUT, THE TIPS SUCK. WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING? MORE THAN I MAKE WORKING AT THE DINER. WELL, YOU NEED TO DANCE ON THE BAR. HOW DO I DO THAT? LOOK, YOU GOTTA WORK YOUR WAY UP. MAYBE IN SIX MONTHS. HUH, SIX MONTHS?

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THERE'S NO NEED TO PRETEND, MICHAEL. THE TRUTH IS... JUST LIKE YOU SAID. MY FATHER... IS LIEUTENANT JOHN MICHAEL NOVOTNY. DIED IN VIETNAM, APRIL 10th, 1970. HE WAS KILLED JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER I WAS BORN, WHEN THE JEEP HE WAS DRIVING RAN OVER A LAND MINE WHILE HE WAS CARVING A PATH THROUGH THE JUNGLE ON A MISSION TO SAVE HIS TROOPS. RIGHT, MA? RIGHT. FOR WHICH HE WAS POSTHUMOUSLY AWARDED... THE PURPLE HEART. AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE... "TELL MY SON I LOVE HIM MORE... THAN LIFE ITSELF... AND I'LL ALWAYS BE PROUD OF HIM." [ ? ] ?

AND IF WE GET UP OFF OUR KNEES ? ? THEN WE'LL SEE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES ? ? AND WE'LL SEE THE NEW SUN RISING... ? MOO! is it a bird? is it a plane? No, it's the latest craze sweeping the Pennines. To be honest, I'd rather be sweeping the Pennines right now. You're supposed to have three weeks' training for this. Granada Reports don't have that kind of money... ..so I'm just going to literally launch myself off this mountain. This is very possibly the late Tony Wilson, for Granada Reports. Wish me luck. Just pull the bar in to get control back again. Hear it flapping, it's OK. If it stops flapping, I'm in trouble. Pull it in till it's flapping again. One, two, three, go.

This is Tony Wilson, a shadow of his former self, for Granada Reports. Back to the studio. Take care. I'm sure I'll be in touch. So exciting, I'd love to do it again. - No problem. - OK, cheerio. (sighs) You're, er, gonna be seeing a lot more of that sort of thing in the film. All of that actually did happen. Obviously it's symbolic, it works on both levels. I don't wanna tell you too much, don't wanna spoil the film,... ..er, but I'll just say "Icarus". If you don't know what I mean, OK. But you should probably read more.

Where'd you get it from? Mate of mine brought it back from his holidays. What, Caribbean? Rhyl. The Sun Centre in Rhyl. Right. Right. I would describe it as history. How could it be history?

Have you recovered? - lt's not historically documented. In other words, not many. How many were at the murder of Julius Caesar? - l don't know, Tony, you tell me. - Five. So shut up, then.

It's, er... - lt's a bit of a dump, isn't it? - Not Las Vegas, is it? - Go round to the left, Tony. - Dog shite everywhere. Disgusting. Yeah, well, it's urban, it's exciting. It's exactly the place we should be. (dogs bark) You don't think those kids will nick the car? - They're not gonna nick the car. - Are you sure? - Right, the reason we're here... - Margaret? Because of the explosion of music with New Wave,... ..there's lots of exciting bands happening... ..and I just think that, culturally, Manchester's slightly lagging behind. Yeah, to get into a nightclub you have to dress like a hairdresser. - Yeah. - The wife's a hairdresser. Well, that's great... ..but some people aren't, and they've got a right to dance and party. - l'm Tonay. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Sorry, this is Tony. Tonay doesn't believe in, er, television. I was just saying, cos it's funny cos, erm,... Tony's on the telly. You know what I call television? The idiot box. - Idiot box. - Yeah, there's a lot of rubbish on. We split the door 60/40 to me. The band, they get a crate of ale. You can have Fridays. All right? - OK. - Look round while I do the till. OK. Thank you. Linds. Come on. - lt stinks in here. - Erm, there's a problem. You never told me he was called Tony. - Who? - What's up? Tony. There's two Tonys. Yeah? Well, that... that... that... Straightaway that's a... that's... Can you not see how that's a potential problem? He's in charge of the club, I'm in charge of whatever it is we're doing. There's two Tonys on equal pegging, there's a confrontation. - Who's Tony one, who's Tony two? - For fuck's sake, Tony. - We'll need some differentiation. - Yeah, but he's not called Tony. He's called Tonay. You know, Don... Tonay. It's his fucking surname, Tone. - ls it? - Yeah. It's a bit grubby. Yeah, I know, but we can get it cleaned up for the nights we're in. - Use your scrubbers to clean it up. - That's worse. What is worse, Tony? Well... Sorry to harp on about this, but that makes him Mr Tonay and I'm just Tony. - (laughs) - What's wrong with that, Tony? Well, there's a hierarchy there straightaway: Mister. Mr Tonay is more important than Tony. "Hello, Mr Tonay." "Yes, Mister. No, Mister." And plain old Tony. "Tony, me mate." I've got to have some credibility. Why don't you just call him Don? How about that? See if he goes for that. Call him Don. - Don... - We're trying to set up a club. - (dogs bark) - What kind of music you bringing in? Erm, sort of, er,... New Wave. Kinda indie. - Indian? ! - No, indie. (spits) Don't want any of that. Don't like that ska. - OK. - Don't want any of that. A notion. I'll leave you with this: heavy metal. Get one of them bands in here. They drink like the fuckin' Queen Mother. - Leave you with that. - Nice car, Don. - She's thirsty. - See you, Don! - l think the name thing went OK. - He heard you that time. - l was gonna be a don. - (car horn) I was gonna be a Virgil till me mum lost her bottle at the last minute. - No, he means he was gonna be a don. - l went to Cambridge. What about a name for the club? Call it Factory. I like that. Bit Andy Warhol. Bit LS Lowry. I just saw a sign on the wall, said "Factory closing",... ..and I thought we can have one going "Factory opening". - (# The Clash: Janie Jones) - # And he'sjust like me and you Mal, when you come down to me,... ..can you just make sure you just get a glimpse of my boot?

It's all over. If you wanna hear good music from now on, get off the couch... ..and go down to the Factory night at the Russell Club every Friday. Go forth and preach the gospel. Good night. # ..how he feels # Pretty bad # There's quite a few. If they've started letting them in, that's a good crowd. - Fucking cock! - Wanker. - That's original. - l like your hair(! ) - Oh, fuck you. - Why does he let people say that? He doesn't care what they say as long as they're talkin' about him. You know that, Alan. - Someone who likes me. Hi. - l love you. Will you sign this? - Yeah. What's your name? - John. - Oh, hello, Mark. - Hi, Tony. All right? Tony, I really miss your programme so I thought, to get it back on telly... Oi, oi. He don't want it to come back. He wants it to be gone forever so it can become a legend. Don't ya? A man with a grasp of semiotics. There's your answer, sweetheart. - Can I get you half a lager? - You can get me a pint. Right, OK. Right. - Wilson, you fucking cunt! - That's original. Your drink's coming. - ls he a friend of yours? - Yeah, he's our singer. Out the way, Steve. Hi, Tony Wilson.

You've got the posters? ! This is the fucking gig. Yeah, I know. Took ages to get the right yellow. - The gig's over. - l know. That's fucking great,... actually. Yeah, it's really nice. It's beautiful. But useless. And as William Morris once said,... .."Nothing useless can be truly beautiful." - You know what? - All right, Tone. Yeah. - Heather, this is Tony Wilson. - All right, love. You seen Lindsay? She went off with Howard. She, er... She just caught me getting a blow job off a hooker in the back of a van. Better go and get her. - (water runs) - (woman laughs) (man and woman pant) (clears throat) Excuse me. (Lindsay moans) - Hi, Tony. - Hi. Erm,... have you got the car keys? - ln me bag. - Thanks. (moaning) I only got a blow job. That's full penetration. - (louder moaning) - See you, Howard. See ya, Tony. All right? (moaning) I definitely don't remember this happening. This is the real Howard Devoto. He and Lindsay insisted we made clear that this never happened. But I agree with John Ford. When you have to choose between truth and legend, print the legend. I thought their name was Warsaw. You can't have a band called Warsaw. You can't put that on a poster. People would think it was a holiday advert. Joy Division: do you know what that is, Mr Wilson? It's when the Nazis, er,... picked out racially pure women... ..and, er, had sex with them. Yeah, well, Joy Division, that's us, eh? - Well, it's a very Nazi name. - So? Yeah, but it's quite... cheery, as well. - You know: "joy". - Yeah. Like a... division of joy or something. - Joy. - Joy... Division. Let's all say that together. One, two, three... - Joy. - Joy. Look at that flat-bottomed valley. It wasn't always crazy between me and Lindsay. Most days we werejust another young couple,... ..who wanted all the things young couples want. Nice house, nice car and a couple ofkids. Enjoy the walk, cos it's just you and me. Would you like a little Tony and a little Lindsay walking around? No, it'd be a nightmare. - l like to be free. - OK. OK. All right, that's the last... last word I'll say on the subject. Two words: body clock. OK? Body clock. - How are you doing? - All right? - Hello, I'm here. - All right, Tone? That's us. That's us. The majors are the status quo and we're not, we're the anarchists. It's gonna be like a co-op, we're all gonna share in the proceeds. We pay for the costs and everything and the rest of it is 50/50. 50 Factory, 50 per cent goes to the artist. Alan's gonna be head of business affairs. It's Red Leb, that. Have you smelt it? Smell that. Smell that. I'm giving you total creative freedom. Right? It's dead fucking simple. You don't like us, you fuck off. I don't like you, I fuck off. I'll write you a contract saying there's no contract in me own blood. - l'll do it if you want. - Not in his own blood! - Here you are. - l'll do it. - You write it... in your own blood. - No, don't give him the dirty knife. In the wo... In the words of the great prophet, "l dares do owt." - Oh, it ain't legal, this. - Come on. - Oh, he's done it, he's done it! - There you go. Real blood. "l..." ".. Tony..." How can you read that? I'm not sure that'd stand up in court! What more do you want? He's written the contract in his own blood! Martin? ! What you doing? ! (coughs) Recording... ..silence. You're recording silence? ! Now I'm recording Tony fucking Wilson. Erm, we want you to produce a band for us. Who's us? Er, Factory Records. Right, 50 quid an hour. Plus I wanna be a partner in the company. See ya. (coughs) - See ya. - (coughs) Stop, stop, stop. Stop that horrible fucking racket, please. What's wrong with it? Nothing was wrong with the drumming as such,... ..it's just that, erm,... ..people have been playing like that for about... 20,000 years... ..and quite frankly, erm,... it's boring the arse off me. Now, let's just try something... a lot simpler, OK? Faster but slower. There's logic there somewhere. - (drumming) - l know what he means. Right, stop. We got... We got a rattle. We're going to have to dismantle the whole fucking kit. You what? How long's that gonna fucking take? I don't fucking know. As long as it takes. is, er.... ls this still costing us 50 pounds an hour? We're still workin', aren't we? What I'd like... ..is to rebuild it on the roof. On the roof? - Yeah. - On the actual roof of the studio? Bloody hell. (siren) Start playing. How will I know when to stop? Don't worry about stopping. I'll send someone out when it's time to stop. (plays drum intro from She's Lost Control) Sorry. (softly) Just remember, Tony Wilson's money.

(# She's Lost Control) # Confusion in her eyes that says it all # She's lost control # And she's clinging to the nearest passer-by I sound like Bowie. - That's good. You like Bowie. - l hate fucking Bowie. In All The Young Dudes he sings about how you should die when you're 25. Do you know how old he is? He's 30, 29, something. He's a liar. Look, it doesn't matter. A lot of great artists produce their best work when they're... older. - You know, WB Yeats... - l've never heard of him, mate. Yeats is the greatest poet since Dante. lf he'd have died at 25... - l would have heard of him, Tony. - Hang on. Listen to it. This is... This is great. This is fucking excellent. - Are you listening to it? It's great. - lt's brilliant. It is. lt's very good. There's nothing else out there that sounds like it. - That's the best thing about it. - lt's wonderful. - You like it? - l do. I love what he's done with the drums. Yeah? # And how I'll never knowjust why or understand # She said "l've lost control again" # And she screamed out kicking on her side # And said "l've lost control again" # Joy Division were a great band but they were Rob's band.

Have you seen our legs? They're like fucking milk bottles. I wouldn't worry about it, although, that... that reminds me,... ..I must get some chicken drumsticks on the way home. All right... No, it's all right, I've got it covered. Instant tan: "Tanfastic". It's hedonism, it's shorts,... ..it's... it's funk,... ..it's... tans. - lt's sexy. - Ah, it's cold, man.

I was telling Clarice just the other day about how all the guys like you are already taken and that she's a very lucky woman. Thanks. Can I ask you a question? I saw your college photo at the house. What happened to your baseball career? Anterior cruciate ligament happened to my career. -Oh, man. -Yeah. I was sliding into home plate. My knee went one way and my body went the other.

Yeah, somebody's got to take care of them. -And that you do. -That I do. And who takes care of you? Hello, hello. -Hey. -Hey. -What are you doing here? -l can ask you the same question. I was just bringing flowers. I never brought flowers before in my entire life, just so you know. And they aren't for you, my married friend. Yeah, well, I didn't think so. Okay, I think I'm gonna go check on the boys inside. Oh, they're beautiful. Hey, these flowers don't mean I'm stalking you. No, they're beautiful. Yeah. -We had a conversation. -Okey-doke. Okay, that's weird. Clearly I don't have a chance with this girl, which is deeply baffling to me. So seriously, man. -What are you doing here? -What am I doing here? You don't think I see what's going on here? You got everything a man could want. A gorgeous wife, beautiful home. And you think that that makes it all good for me? I just don't want to see you screw up your life. Too late for that. My life's already screwed up. Dave. Who takes care of me? -Hey, Dave. -That's a damn good question. A question I didn't have an answer for. Hi. You didn't notice the candles? -Reesie, l-- -Come on, baby. You remember the candles. When we first got married, they were always my signal to let you know I was gonna put something on you. I know. I know it's been a long time since I lit my candles for you, I.... You don't have to do this. Baby, we need this. I sent Mama on a long errand, so she won't be back for a long time. Come here, please. Like you said, it's time for us to get back to the loving part of our marriage. -Oh, baby, I want you so bad. -Stop. -Are you sleeping with her? -What? I'm not stupid, David. -Are you sleeping with Julie? -No, I'm not sleeping with her. Well, then, what is it? What--? Since when have you had to take phone calls outside? What are all the phone calls about, anyway? David, what's happening? Tell me the truth. Things haven't been right between us and I think we both know that. I know that. So I'm not gonna lie to you. I do have some feelings for her. That's worse. She's taken your heart from me? So, what do you want me to do? I don't know, David. -Clarice. -How could you, Julie? -What? -How could you betray me like this? -Betray you, what--? -l respected you. I thought we were friends. Okay, I gotta stop you right there if this is what I think it's about. Dave and I are friends. Just like you and I are friends. Nothing more, nothing less. We're just friends. Girl, as much as I would like to snatch you right now I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna rise above this. But let me make myself very clear. Stay the hell away from my husband. You wanna blame someone for your problems? You didn't need to leave your doorstep to do it. And you certainly don't need to come to mine. Oh, girl. In case you didn't hear me the first time stay away from my man. Yeah. -Yeah, come on. -Here we go. Take your marks. -Come on. -Kick, kick, kick. Go, Bryson! Come on, Bryson! Keep pushing! -Come on, Bryson! -Go! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, he's done it! Oh, my God! Why don't we say it's a draw? Let me ask you this, man to man. Ain't nobody in here but me and you. Who gets that baseball scholarship if we back in the day? You do. But I was a better athlete. Right. So you think all the hell I've been through was my fault. Man, everybody got problems. See, you just don't know how good you got it. You talking about Darius, right? I'd trade that scholarship and everything I had for a son like Darius. Oh, hell, no. Yeah, that's right. That's right. We putting you out of here. And don't think Clarice is gonna change her mind. What you doing, you old woman? -Old? Oh, no, hell, no. -Mama, please! No, no, no, let her talk. She's always had an equal vote. Why change it now? What is wrong with you? You got this beautiful black queen right here. What in your mind makes you think you gotta go out and get a white woman? Shut up and mind your own business. -David. -No. He been living high on the hog leeching off your money for years. It's time you got his black ass out of here. She more of a man than you'll ever be. So you just gonna stand there and let her say that to me? Clarice. You are just gonna stand there and let her say that to me? Well, then you're right. It is time for me to get out of here. Because I don't give a damn about this house your money or this marriage. I'm done. Dave. Hey, where you been? I've been trying to call your cell. There was an accident. -lt's Bryson. -What happened? I don't know, he went into the wall too hard. They rushed him to the hospital. It's bad, man, really bad. Come on, I'll drive. -l should go. -You ain't going nowhere. Go on in the house. Coach. Please, what are you doing? No, no, no. Please, no. No, no. Oh, please, God. She's all alone. I don't think she has anyone to help her through this. She has us. "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil." "My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Amen. Clarice, be honest with me. In the last meeting I had with you and Dave I asked you a very important question. Yeah. Has God been the third strand in that cord I wrapped around your shoulders all those years ago? No. Well, without that third strand you find yourself sitting here alone. Your mother is a good woman. But because you listened to her in matters of your marriage that acorn hasn't fallen too far from the tree. Now, I got to go bury this child. But, Clarice you're in the right place at the right time. When I drive through this city and hear the sounds of sirens and alarms going off I see the looks of panic on the faces of people I don't know. I realize how afraid we all are in this world. Life is so unpredictable, fragile. We're only alive one breath, one heartbeat at a time. And so when death comes to one of us it comes to all of us. Because it's the one thing we all have in common. Sooner or later, it's the one place we're all headed. And even though some of us believe that life doesn't end on this side of the grave our grief drives us to hunger for a human touch. Mama, what's that? is that a picture of Daddy? Let me see that. Give it here. -So you still love him? -No. That's a piece of him I keep as a reminder that I made the right decision. Do you miss him at all? Do you remember that cheerleading competition I won? I remember all your accomplishments, Clarice. What you want? That was the same weekend Daddy left. But all I remember you saying-- Don't start dredging up all that mess. That's good riddance to bad rubbish. All I remember you ever saying to me was how he cheated on you and how he was a horrible husband. Never really got his side. Finally talked to Daddy, and he said that he never slept with that woman. He said you drove him out of the house, Mama. He didn't sleep with her until after- l'm not having this conversation. -Why? Because my bedroom drama with your daddy ain't none of your business. Excuse me? The way you're all up in my marriage? You convinced me to put my husband out of my house. I think it is my business, Mama. Don't talk to me like that. Okay, all right. You wanna know? Yes. Your daddy was rotten. You were too young to understand what was going on in that house. He was a nasty bastard. -Mama-- -Don't "Mama" me. He hit me in my face. Now, you listen to me real good. When they stay, and they done already left they get mean. I hated your daddy. -Mama. -No, I hated him. I hated him! You were right to throw Dave's ass out of here before he hits you. No. No, David's not like that. And that wasn't the way to handle that. I shouldn't have listened to you. I shouldn't have listened to you. I'm not gonna talk about this. I'm not. Black women have to be strong and you know that. I don't know what kind of pain you are holding on to in your heart, Mama but you need to let it go. You need to just let it go. And in all your lessons about how I need to be strong and proud and independent, Mama you left out some very important things. -What? -How to love, Mama. How to really care about somebody. How to forgive. I cared about you. I loved you the best I could. I gave you everything in me that he didn't take. And he took everything. Can't you see that? I know you did, Mama. And if that ain't good enough for you, then I'm sorry for you. No. Mama, I'm so sorry for you. I didn't mean to come out here and disrespect you, I really didn't. But it's time for me to grow up and I'm gonna have to ask you to leave my house because I want my husband. I want my husband back, and I want to fight for my marriage. Because, Mama, I don't want to end up like you. I don't. I'm gonna pray for you, Mama. I love you so much. Little girl. You pray for yourself. I'll be gone when you get back. Go on. Okay. Okay. I'm not sorry about what we did. I love you. -Please leave. -Not until we talk. We can't. If Shawn comes up here and.... -He can never find out about this. -He won't. Then why are you even doing this? Hey, hey! Hey, come on, Dave, knock. -You scared me. -What are you doing here? What do you mean? Why didn't you knock? I just came by. Talked to the manager. I told him I was your probation officer, he let me up. -So, what are you doing here? -l can't come by to see my friend? I know what you're going through. I wanna make sure that everything that you are going through is cool. -Make sure you're copasetic. -What are you watching? Just something to make me feel better. I had-- Vanessa kicked your ass out, didn't she? First of all, that's just crazy to even think that she would kick me out. Okay, why would she kick her husband out? Her husband, the man she's supposed to love. Can I tell you what she said to me? Can I tell you what she said? -Listen, look at me. -What did she say? She told me I'm too emotional. I'm way too in touch with my feminine side. No man should apologize to nobody that much. My feet, she don't like my feet now. All of a sudden my feet is a problem? But her back, I can accept that? -You can't accept my feet? -Here's what I want you to do. Go back home to your wife. No, I'm gonna make her think I'm cheating. You need to go back home to your wife. -Why don't you--? -Go back home to your wife. Can you talk to me? Listen, can you talk to me for two seconds? Why can't me and you get in touch, figure out why this keep happening? -l'm emotional now. -Good men. -Good brothers. -Emotional, here we go. We're good black men. -Got my toiletry bag? -Here you go. -Because I don't want to-- -Here we go. I love you, I don't tell you enough. -Here we go. -All right, you right. -Thank you, Dave. -Have a good night. Do you got my toiletry bag? Okay. Hello. Thank you for coming. And thank you for taking care of everything. l-- l couldn't have done it. Are you okay? I think he was so focused on winning and that medal, he.... His coach told him about-- Why didn't I remind him? "You have to take the trash out when we get home." What? That's the last thing I said to him. Before the race. "You have to take the trash out when we get home." Not "l love you." Not "l'm so proud of you." Not "l'm so lucky to be your mom." "You've got to take the trash out when we get home." -lt's okay. -No, it is not gonna be okay. It's-- lt's never gonna be okay. Oh, my God. lt's just not gonna be. -lt's all right. -You can't make it better. Just stop. It's not. lt never is. Wait, no, wait. I can't do this. I know. I'm sorry. I know. Now, you tell the crew for me there are four ways of doing things onboard my ship: The right way, the wrong way, the Navy way, and my way. If they do things my way, we'll get along. -Aye, aye, sir. -Okay. Oh, the manager gave me a key. -l can leave if you-- -No, no, no, it's cool. That manager would give a key to anybody. David, I just need you to let me say some things, okay? I have been round and round with my heart and I want you to know two things. First of all, Mama has lost all of her voting privileges in this marriage. And, second no one ever taught me how to be one of those wives who holds on to her man's every word. And no one taught me how to trust him to take care of me, you know? I really don't know if I could ever be that woman but I do want to learn how to be your partner. And whatever you decide I need you to know that I can't live without you, David. I don't want to live without you and I love you so much. Come here. What's that? I heated you up a plate because you're staying in a roach motel and I wanted you to eat. -l cooked it. -You cooked it? -Yes. -There ain't poison in this, is there? You're not gonna eat it? You're not gonna eat the food? Hi. What up? What up? You know, I was hoping, man I can get Darius back on your team, you know? It's like you, you know-- You helping him to be a better man. Why don't we both do that? Darius, where you at? Okay. Listen, I got you back on the team, man. Yeah, and I got you a new glove. So I want you to come back home and be there by, like, 5:00. And.... l love you, man. You know? Yeah. All right. I found out that if you wanna know the purpose of a thing you can't ask the thing to tell you. A car doesn't know why it's a car. Only the manufacturer knows what it was made to do. And I guess that's the way it is with us and God. You know you'd make an excellent daddy someday. Well, I hope so. What about in, like, seven and a half months? Are you saying that...? God didn't just make Dave Johnson to be a husband or a coach, a friend, or a daddy. Those are just roles, not who I am as a man. But I guess, sometimes he has to let life turn you upside-down so you can learn how to live right side up. Finally. Thank you. You're welcome. - no good? - larry! it tastes like you put the whole salt shaker up in here. No, that's way too salty. way too salty. All right, it's too salty. i'm sorry. Pfft, could you make it any hotter in here, by the way? - it feels good. - it feels good? - Yeah, it feels good. 75° is perfect. I can't even sleep in this room at night, it's so hot. honest to god. - what temperature would you prefer? - 68°. - 68°? ! See, that's some white-people shit right there, l.d. Black people like it a little bit warmer at night, okay? - at least compromise. - no no no, 75° works for me, l.d. I'll call leon. let's see what he says. leon! - leon, come in here! - he gonna let you know that that's how we like it. Okay, you know, i can't sleep. it's too hot at night. I want to sleep in 68° temperature. She wants to sleep in 75°. let's compromise at 72°. Oh no, fuck that, larry. you my motherfucking man, larry, but 72°? shit. You might as well sleep outside. i'm an 82° man myself. - see there, i told you! - 82°, that's my shit. that's my fucking region. - you really wanted it 68°. - 6-fucking-8? he said 68°? - get the fuck outta here. - it's like a frigerator. - oh my goodness. - you take that shit? - you bring a honey to the hotel and shit get up in that motherfucker. it's all cold and shit-- got to heat her ass up. All right now, you make sure you do your homework before you watch that tv. - hey, hi! - hey, larry. - hey, i got some shows tivo'd. don't erase them. They erase all my tivo'd shows. You know what, larry? there's been another robbery in this neighborhood. I was just talking to the neighbors. it's the third one this month. What are you talking to the neighbors for? They came over and let me know what's going on. You don't need to talk to the neighbors, okay? Yeah, but, larry, there's been a robbery. I'd rather have the thieves than the neighbors-- thieves don't impose. what are you talking about? the neighbors want your time. The thieves want your things. i'd rather give them things than time. Listen, have you heard anything from the doctor about loretta's biopsy? No no, they said a couple of days. Oh. you know, at first i was really worried, larry. But no matter what the outcome is, loretta has you by her side. You know, things could get bad, larry, but she's got you to hold her hand. And if she has to do chemo and it causes her to lose her hair, Throw up and all that, you gonna be right there by her side. Thank you, larry. 75°? i'm baking in that room at night. It's like i'm cinderella in there, i swear to you. cinderella? what do you mean? cinderella, you never saw the fairy tale cinderella? No no, i know cinderella. but what aspect of cinderella? what do you mean? - what aspect do you think i mean? - i don't know. the shoe? - she gets bossed around by the stepmother! - i'm comparing me-- - don't get mad at me! - don't get mad at me. - well, you're so stupid! - don't get mad at me. So that's what it's like, huh? that's terrible. That's what it's like. exactly. - that's what it's like. - oh, that's horrible. - you know what? you know what the worst part is? - what? we're waiting for the results. I got about 24 hours to get out of this thing before the results come back. Yeah, you can't break up with somebody who's got cancer. you gotta break up with her before she gets those test results. god, it's gonna be so hard. - why? what's the big deal? - what do you mean "what's the big deal?" The whole family's gotta move out-- it's a big deal! I'd much rather be in her position than mine any day of the week. No, to be the breaker-upper you're in control. Couples should have like a pre-breakup agreement Before they start going out because every relationship is going to end at some point. All you do is send a text. you make an agreement-- "if you see the word 'apricot,' it means it's over." Okay, hypothetically, what if you or she are eating apricots at that point? Can I tell you something about apricots? You know, one in 30 is a good one. It's such a low-percentage fruit. Always a mealy dry... Hey, how's it going? - Hi, Lar. - Oh, hey. Want to come to a dinner party tonight? - Tonight? - Yeah. You know you love my cooking. It's a little late for an invitation, is it not? - Well... it's an invitation nonetheless. - Who else is gonna be there? - Uh, eh, you don't need to know. - Why not? - Because it's not done, that's why not. - What do you mean it's not done? It's a social convention that people don't ask who's going to be there at the dinner party. It's just not done. - Big deal. Why isn't it done? - Because it isn't! I don't know the derivation of the convention. Why are you following it blindly like this? You should be glad that it happens that way, because if I told people you were coming, they might not show up. That's probably why people don't tell... Because if it gets out who's coming nobody would want to go. So why even have it in the first place if people don't want to be with each other? I don't think that's why. It's just not done. What's the downside of telling me? I don't know that there is a downside, except that... - You don't need to know. - Who's coming? - Don't you dare tell him. - What's that? - Who's coming? - I don't know. Why do you even get started with her on this stuff? That's my question. - What time? - 7:30. You've got something to do. You'd better go do it. Not now, maybe tonight. - Thank you. See you later. - Can't wait to see ya! - You take care of yourself, all right? - Thank you, doctor. You're welcome. We still don't know anything. Oh shoot! I forgot... I gotta feed those fish again. It's like a huge responsibility... Feeding fish. It's not fun. Think about it, you know? I'm outside, i gotta go home and feed fish? I mean, seriously, who gives a shit? Mr. david, i wanted to talk to you about your girlfriend. You know, they're not pets, really. But yet it's the same responsibility as a pet. But you get nothing back. you watch them. Is that supposed to be fascinating? I don't know. - can i talk to you about loretta? - what do you think? do you think she has-- Think she has cancer? I-- i can't speculate about that right now. We did a biopsy at the hospital and-- Let me ask you a question: Say you had to make a bet with vegas on this, Would you bet for cancer or against cancer? I-- i-- i don't get into that numbers game. - You must have an idea. - I don't. - No idea? - No idea. What is this thing? I've had this a while. What is that? It's just a skin tag. Just put a little lotion on there. But... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna write you a few prescriptions to fill out. I'm gonna prescribe zithromax and tylenol with codeine. Now the tylenol, that's just as needed for pain. Again, in a few days... any day, we'll have the biopsy back and that will help us determine what the next step is. But right now, I want you to just stay calm, and... What's wrong? You just go into the refrigerator without asking? I just got myself a lemonade. Is that a... I was just surprised you didn't ask. I'm surprised you didn't offer, to be honest. - Well, I was about to offer. - I don't think you we about to offer... Well, I was gonna offer... It is a little unusual to go into someone's refrigerator without asking, is it not? I can tell when somebody's gonna offer me lemonade. You were not going to offer me lemonade. If anything, you were going to complain to me about being a fish owner or something. It is difficult to be a fish owner. Why is that a priority? ! Your girlfriend is sick. I didn't say it's a priority. I just said that they need to be fed and it's something that I need to think about. You do not need to think about that. What you need to think about is the sick woman upstairs. I'm thinking about that. And by the way, why couldn't you ask? Are you so dainty you can't say "May I please have a glass of water?" "May I have a piece of pie?" It could be tuna fish... It doesn't matter. - No, it does matter. - Here, you want? Take... Take this. You don't offer... a hot day... a mover comes here... .. you say, "you want some tuna fish?" - You want this little pear? - Don't condescend to me with your tiny pear. I'm not the one that has a problem here. You are, my friend. - You are. - Yeah. - okay, fine. - yeah, fine. - hey, dr. schaffer. - hello. - Did you see that? Did you see that guy? - What was that whole thing? He goes in my refrigerator. Come on, you don't do that. - what did he take? - lemonade. liquids are okay. I don't believe that people should go into my refrigerator. - what kind of a stupid rule this that? - what do you mean? I don't go into other people's refrigerators. - You could go into my refrigerator. - I don't go into your refrigerator. you're a welcome guest. Hey, how's your sister, by the way? - bam bam? - yeah. Thanks for asking. she's doing a lot better. Yeah. i'm really glad we took her out of that mental institution - that's good. - yeah, i'm excited. You know, if there's anything i can do-- You let me know. You know what? there is something you can do. - what? - yeah you can come over today at 1:00 and visit with her. - visit her? what, are you kidding? - yeah. - why, you didn't mean it? - of course not! - Why did you say it then? - You know, it was some-- an empty gesture. it was something to say. guess what: You said it. be there at 1:00. But one thing-- when you go in the house, Look at her shoes before she calls your name. Don't look at her in the eyes. She'd love to see you. Oh, christ. I don't know how you take a statement like that seriously. But you said it and you're gonna stick to it. - and make her feel good! - all right. I'll see you at jeff's tonight. What's at jeff's? Oh, he's, um, having a little.. Dinner party. I guess i wasn't invited. I can't believe that. Why don't you make sure before you ask somebody... "Am i gonna see you tonight?" - that they were invited? - i just assumed you were going. don't assume anything. if they had told me Who was coming to the party, i would have known - and i wouldn't have asked, but they refused to tell me. - it's not your job To find out who's going to a party. All i want you to do is entertain my sister for two hours And then you can goto your godd. - she better not be dangerous. - be there at 1:00, okay? I gotta sit in a room with that nut? - you look good. - you do. Thank you. Thank you, jeff. And i appreciate the effort, larry. - no effort. - no, it was effortless. Okay, then we're all happy. So what's new? So what's happening? Guess who told marty to shut up. why, what did he say? - i give up. - who? - He didn't tell you? - No, no. She's great-- a great actress. - angelina jolie? - no! You know who i mean. she's an actress. She said shut up right to marty. - nicole kidman? - no! - julia roberts? - no! She's a multi-- multi-talented. Oh, i know, i know! hannah montana. no, you're not even trying! - the kardashians! - what? no! you know who it is! - do you have any idea? - no. Yeah, you do. - Got anything to eat? - No. - anything to drink? - nope. - nothing to eat or drink? - nope. i'm sorry, nothing. - boy, that's interesting. - I know. really. - isn't it? - It is. - i'm gonna go to the bathroom. - I was gonna go to the bathroom. - I just said i'm going to the bathroom. - but i'm saying, could i go first? - no no, i'm going first. - so when you come back, i'm gonna go. - Yes. - Okay. You had sex with a mental patient! - she's not a mental patient. - she's a mental patient. - she's living at funkhouser's. - she's a mental patient. If i went over to the institution and fucked her, then she's a mental patient. What happened? i got up to go to the bathroom. I was sitting there and she said, "i'm bored." I said, "if there's anything i can do"- you said that? - that's it. - an empty gesture? - an empty gesture. - that's how this whole thing started. - that's how it started and then i'm off banging her. You can't make an empty gesture to a funkhouser. They take you up on it. How come you don't have a doorbell? You know what you did? - you totally fucked me. - what? - you fucked me. - what are you talking about? what'd you tell funkhouser about the party for? - Pfft, oh, why? he said something? - Yeah, he said something. he called to complain he wasn't invited and susie invited him. oh, that is so lame! you know that? that is so lame to call up and do that. and guess what else they did? They brought bam bam. bam bam's here! he brought that fucking nutbag into my house! oh my god. what the fuck did you go and tell him for? If you had told me who was coming to the party in the first place, I never would have said anything to him because i would have known he wasn't coming. It's crazy-- all these party rules: you can't tell who you're inviting, You can't tell anybody you're going And you can't talk about it after. It's like living in east germany or something. Now i'm screwed. just look at this. this is crazy. - what is that? is that dr. schaffer? what's he doing here? He had a party recently. he invited us. we're returning the favor. what's the big deal? - Again. - again what? if i had known that he was gonna be here, i wouldn't have come. if i had known bam bam was gonna be here, I would have left town! - who's that guy with the doctor? - that's his boyfriend. - what, seriously? - yeah, he's gay. - oh my god, i didn't know that. - yeah, listen, i gotta go help susie. - hey, how you doing? hi, mr. david, how are you? - this is sam. - hi. it's good to meet you. i didn't know you were gay. Uh, yeah. - is that a surprise to you? - Yeah, i'm a little surprised, yeah. Why? i don't know. i just didn't think you were gay. - what is that supposed to mean? - It doesn't mean anything. it means i was surprised to discover that he's gay. but why? how would i seem if i was gay? what is seeming gay? you seem slightly gay and you don't. so i wouldn't be surprised if somebody told me-- but i'm surprised that somebody tells me you're gay. - is that a crime? - no, it's not a crime. it's just odd. it's not a crime. and it's a little bit offensive. i'm sorry if you're offended. i don't accept your apology 'cause i don't believe that you are sorry. How about if i said i'm pleasantly surprised? - You're living in another decade, mr. david. - i don't think i am. - well, i think you are. - all right, fine. fine, we disagree. - okay, we'll agree to disagree. - All right, great. Unbelievable. What did you do with bam bam? - What? nothing. what do you mean? - When you came over to the house. - i didn't do anything. - It's like a miracle. I've never seen her spirits like this. I mean, the medicine and your visit-- she's a different person. That is fantastic! What great news. I... You shouldn't be giving me any of the credit. This is the man... Come here, come here. - What? - He says Bam Bam is... - ...is like a new person. - How about that? That's great. - Were you there too? - Yeah. No wonder she was singing "I love the fat boy." - I couldn't figure it out. - I love the fat boy. It's great. I can't thank you guys enough! - What did you do? - We just sat and talked with her. - Did you play any games? - No games, uh-huh. - Did you play a million pick-up sticks? - No. The key to the whole thing? You treat them normal and they really respond. I love both of you and you gotta promise me you'll do it again. - If we have time. - It's possible. Oh no, you gotta promise. - We'll see. - Just say you'll go over there. Dinner is served! - Let's go have some dinner. - Thank you so much! Susie, these ingredients are very fresh and well prepared. Oh, thank you, Bam Bam. That's so sweet of you. I'm so glad you were able to join us. I'm so glad you still have food in your fridge considering Larry's around. What is that? What do you mean? Larry likes to clean out fridges like he did today at Marty's house. You were into our fridge uninvited, right? That's ridiculous. Oh? Then might you explain the whereabouts of the freshly-sliced deli-packaged turkey... I don't even eat turkey. ...the yellow mustard in a glass jar. And the lemonade soda? Oh, lemonade? So you're a hypocrite too? Because I had lemonade at your house and you threw... a shit fit. She's emotionally unstable. Are you gonna believe a word this woman says? You know, I don't mind if you take liquid, but when you take regular food, - I have a problem. - I didn't take anything! That's crazy. Speak the truth. Help him with the truth, would you, Jeff? I wouldn't know. I actually wasn't there in the kitchen. You were... You were... Oh no, you weren't. I know where you were! - You were in bed with me. - What? What did you say? What the fuck is she talking about Jeff? What the hell did you do? - Oh, I did nothing. - He didn't do anything. Did you take advantage of this poor deranged girl? You are sick! That's disgusting. What did you do now? You sick fucking pervert. You're... You're serving nothing but lies here. I'm not hungry. What did you do to her, Jeffrey? - How could you do that? - She's fucking nuts! She's a nutbag! - She's a nutbag. I did not do anything. - He's gonna sleep with a mental patient? All right, all right, all right! I believe you! Even Bam Bam is not crazy enough to sleep with you, okay? Only I am. There you go. That's exactly... That's exactly right. Of course. Okay, everybody, everybody, I want to apologize for the Funkhouser family. Oh, stop. It's not necessary. I'm going to have to take her back to the institution. I'm gonna tell you something: I think it would be good for her. And you're doing it for her own safety, for her own good. - No, I'm not so certain. - No, it's good. It's a great thing, because you've gotta think of the long haul. Let's enjoy our dinner. I'm sorry this happened. - The best salad anybody ever made. - Thank you, sweetheart. Hello? What? Hold on, hey, what? Oh, okay. All right, I'll go pick it up. No, I'll leave right now. - You're leaving? - I'm so sorry. I have to go. I have to pick up Loretta's medication. - You didn't give it to her yet? - No, I've gotta get it from the pharmacy. You're leaving, I haven't served the entree yet. It's sad because I'm having so much fun here, and then... and I gotta go and... - Maybe I'll come back. - No, don't bother coming back. Go go go! I got the prescription, Auntie Rae. I'm just gonna get some food to go. - Could you do me a favor? - What? Could you go... up to Loretta and ask her what the name of that restaurant was - we ate in in Santa Monica a few weeks ago? - No. - Why not? - Because she's resting. - Is she sleeping? - No. - Can she talk? - Yes. So let her talk. No. I don't want her talking. I want her resting. Resting? What does resting even mean? She's not sleeping, is she? You can talk and rest. Larry, I am not gonna bother Loretta with this bullshit. Do you hear me? She resting. Bye. Oh, hi, Mr. David. Nice to see you. I'd like some food to go. Oh, I just sat your party. - Party? - Yeah, you had a reservation. I have a reservation? Let me see. "Larry David, 2." My God. Thank you. Well well. Hi, hello. Larry. My man. How's it going, brother? - Pretty good. - Give me some. All right. What, are you using my name to get a table in here? Well, it's so crowded. I just thought you'd... - ...have a better chance. - really? You want to join us? - You could eat with us. - Are you sure? Really? - Please. Sit down. - I miss you. You sure? - Great. - Oh, by the way, I put you up for an N.A.A.C.P. image award. Yeah? Fingers crossed, baby. I think you'll win. - Oh, thank you. - How is Loretta? Oh, she's... she's... yeah. Yeah? Yeah, she's good. How's the no-fly underwear guy? Um, it's not happening. It didn't work out. - Really? - Yeah. Maybe Larry's people can hook you up with somebody. You know Lil Wayne? You know Lil Wayne. Oh, like this. Yeah. I can't... I can't read my... menu. - It's so dark in here. - It's so dark. I honestly have... This is insane. How do they expect people to read this menu? I've got a candle here and I can't read it. I'm gonna go outside. Oh yeah, I'm gonna go outside. I'll go out with you. Larry, what you putting on your hair? I like that. Posner. You learning, Larry. Hang in there, baby. Oh, look, the Caesar salad. - Caesar salad. - You used to get that. That's very good here. - Right. With the 200 croutons. - A lot of croutons. - There were a lot of croutons. - Ton of croutons. I can't believe I'm sitting here with you. - It's weird. - It's crazy. Isn't it? I really miss you. I miss you too. - You do? - Well... kind of. I mean, I do, I do. It's just what was happening was not working for me. It just wasn't... I don't know. It got to this place where you were always at the house and you didn't have anything to do and you... it was just different. Like when you were working on "Seinfeld," You had a job and you'd get up and you'd go, like, do something with other people. And then you'd come home And it was like that was the right amount of Larry. I understand. Too much Larry, I get that. We can reduce Larry in half. We can reduce Larry to a third. We can reduce Larry to three hours a day. That's... - Slivers of Larry is better. - I get that. I've got 24-hour Larry, you think I like it? - Hello? - Larry, Dr. Schaffer just called. He's on his way over to the house right now. He's got the results of the biopsy. He's coming over to the house right now? I'm on my way! - Is everything okay? - Uh, yeah. I gotta go. - Is it an emergency? - Yeah, I gotta go. I'll talk to you. I gotta go get out of something. Shit, damn it! Come on, schmohawk. Larry! - Oh my God. - What took you so long? Never mind. Apology accepted. Now call Marty. - Bam bam... - Call Marty. - I'll go in the house... Just tell me, you lied, right? You lied, Jeff enjoyed. Dirty God... Don't look at them, Larry. Don't get eye contact. Go! Go! Go! - Nice! - Oh my God. - Oh my God. - Only call Marty. - What? Yeah, I am. - Call Marty. - I gotta get in there, bam bam. - No... Ow! Call him. Get your cell out. Bammer, what are you doing here? Tell him Jeff said I was in the top 10! - Tell him. - Stop it. Calm down. Tell Marty Jeff enjoyed me. You should not have left the house. Folks, we had a report of a break-in. Did you see anything? Okay, she'll give you a statement. I've gotta get in the house. I'll take your statement now. No, she can't give you a statement. She's not qualified to make a statement. - She's crazy. - What? ! No, she's not crazy. Yeah, after what she said at dinner tonight, she's crazy. - Oh no no, she... - I'm taking her back to the home. I'm taking her back. If she can't give one, I'll need a statement from you. Have a good night. Sir, did you see a vehicle? Was it individuals What happened? What exactly did you see? Sir, your attention here, sir, if you would, please. All right, well, I saw a guy jump over a hedge across the street. He had a... Oh, the doctor's coming. Larry. Folks, I wish that I had better news for you. The biopsy came back positive for cancer. Now... - Oh, Larry, Larry! - Are you with me? Come on, Larry, come on. Okay, all right. I know this can be very upsetting. - Dr. Schaffer, can I go in and see her? - Yes. It's gonna be okay. Now... This is really where the hard work starts. She's gonna need a lot of help. There's a lot of vitamins, a lot of medicines that she's gonna need. Organic juices three times a day. I would keep the house warmer. Keep it at about 78° to 82° minimum. The warmer the better, really. That helps with the healing process. I know this is a lot to take in, but if you guys work hard, especially you, in two, three, maybe four years, she's hopefully gonna be fine. - Did you say four years? - Could be, yeah. And your life is mostly going to be taking her to appointments or here with her in the house. I... I can still play golf. Absolutely not. I don't imagine you'd have time for that. Once a week? No times a week. You won't have time for that. - What? Nine holes. - Zero holes, Mr. David! This is serious. Now I won't lie... things are going to get ugly. There's going to be vomiting.

My heart line went straight to hell. - Mom, I won! - Great. - Can I try again? . - Sure. - Have you still got my number? . - No. No. I'd better give it to you again then. Give me a call. - Tom. - Yes. And then I found her in the tunnel. Murdered. - They had her under surveillance. - Kim? . -Why? . - Ml6 tipped them off. - They had pictures of you at the cafe. - Stupid idiots! If they'd come to me, I could have talked to her... Don't take your sorrow and anger out on Security Service. - They aren't worth it. - Did we get the case? . No, Security Service is handling it. - When did they get in touch? . - Earlier. Kim's death upset them. They think an attack is underway. Here, worst case scenario. - They want her info. Found Gunvald? . - No. - Hi. What are you doing here? . - I need your help. Confiidentially. - Sure, what... - Dig up everything on Kim Reeshaug. R-E-E-S-H-A-U-G. Can't you... - Hi. - It's Oscar. - Is she in the files? - Only her address.

Well, he... - You promised not to say? . - Yes. - Is it about Kim Reeshaug? . - Yes. - Gunvald asked you to snoop around? . - Yes, but I don't know what... - Did you find anything on her? . - Just her address. - Hi, Gunvald. -What are you looking for? . We've been looking for you. -Why? . - Kim Reeshaug. - How did you meet? . - At a cafe. Whatthe hell are you up to? . - We want to ask you a few questions. - About Ml6? . Or if I'm a terrorist? . - lmbecils! - You found her in the tunnel. - Yes. - Did you see anyone else there? . No. - Am I a suspect? . - No. They just want to know what Kim was involved in, and why she was killed. They don't give a shit abouther. They just want to kiss Ml6's ass! I think I saw Tom in a blue ChryslerVoyager. I checked the license plate. Phony. I think I saw him in the back. Tom? . You think he was kidnapped? . We got the pictures from Ml6. George Robinson, American citizen, 51. One of the top people. They think he's in Sweden. They don't know were the rest is. - But ifRobinson... - Distribute these nationwide. We're now working on the assumption that an attack is underway here. - Your receipt, sir. - Thanks. And this is the number? . - They're knocking nuclear power. - What is it this time? .

Swedish Security Service had you undersurveillance. Me too, maybe. - Why? . - They saw us togetheratthe cafe. -What happened in the tunnel? . - Tom and I had no place to run. Then they came and grabbed Tom, and I struggled to free him. - Then we were separated. - One of them died. I know. Melina. She must have knocked her head, while we were fighting. - Then they burnt her and... - Who? . I can't tell you. They took Tom to get at me. What will happen to him? . -What the hell are you involved in? . - Please, I need help. Help me find Tom, and then I'll tell you everything. -Where are they keeping him? . - I may be able to fiind out. Help me? . Not if you won't tell me anything. Gunvald! Tom is your son. A SNlFTER? . GOOD,HUH? .! You swallowed that hook, line and sinker, huh? . - Yes. - I just got a shot. Against what? . Damned if I know. But pensioners got it for free. They shoved it up my ass and out through my armpit. Now I'm immortal. Just like Osten Wamer bring with the Tyrolese hat. - But he's dead. - I know. Maybe that's why the shot was free. How does it feel to look down on me? . Feels pretty good. You know, "Upstairs, Downstairs". Are you happy down there? . Why not? . I'm used to your balcony and you. Mano a mano. Two lonely men, free to discuss anything they want to be it wallpaper paste or silverfish. Not many people are that blessed. - I'm coming up. - No. - Why not? . - I'm going to bed. - We'll have a bedside snifter. - I have to rest. I'm sick as a dog. - Good night, you. - Whaddaya mean good night? . Martin! Good night? . What the heck? . chief OF police MARGARETA OBERG I checked up on this EJM. A network founded in the late 90's of young, well-educated people. Several of them have been active in various environmental activist groups. Most of them are fanatical militants. Greenpeace Extreme, some call them. What's their goal? . To change society, change our life style stop the exploitation of Earth's resources, make a better world. - What have they done? . - Tried to sink a whaler near Iceland. Sabotaged a chemical weapons plant in Spain. Blown up a pesticide plane in the States and attacked a gene bank in Kuala Lumpur. One of them died. According to Ml6 they've evolved into environmental terrorists. Mom! Darling! Happy birthday. I'm so sorry about all this. - Are they nice to you? . - They gave me a game. - Cool. - No, I want to be with you. As soon as I've done this, we're going to London. - Promise? . - Of course. Darling. - Have you got your cell? . - Yes, I hid it in my boxers. I turned it off, so they wouldn't take it. Good. Keep it turned off, unless you're absolutely sure you're alone. - Got any games? . - No. It's Kim. Tom is on 26 Dobelnsgatan for the next hour. Maybe... - Are you alone? . - No. Kim is alive. You asked me if I had any special relationship to her. I did... do. We met ten years ago. She took part in a sit-down and I was there to keep the peace at a distance. In Humlegarden Park. I fell head overheels. She was beautiful. Remember when I took two months off in the middle of an investigation? . - A relative of yours had cancer... - I lied. We eloped to Zanzibar and lived like children of nature in a beach hut. - So Kim Reeshaug is alive? . - Yes, she's alive. We drifted apart, and I hadn't seen her till I came across her at the cafe. - Who was the corpse in the tunnel? . - I don't know. -What's going on? . - She's involved in some Ml6 case. They've got her son. - Who? . - I don't know. They've kidnapped him. She wants me to help fiind the boy. - Do you know where he is? . - Yes, but they're moving him... - In 20 minutes. - So you're going there to... - Yes. - Alone? . - That sounds like a god-awful idea. - Yes. I'll be in touch. Get out ofthe car! . Hi. Shot? . Any lD? . No, but he had this in his pocket. Some kind of map. - Hi. - Are you alone? . - Shit, are you hurt? . - Marginally. - You need stitches. - Yeah... What... - What happened? . - Can I crash here for a night or two? . Sure, but I haven't got... Without your knowledge. - What do I tell... - Nothing. Security Service is staking out my place. Sure, you can sleep on the couch, if you want to. Thanks. Have you got... a pair of pants and socks? . Yes. -What's up with Security Service? . - They think I know something. - Something they don't know. - And you don't? . - Yes. - Anything to do with Kim Reeshaug? . - Yes. They think she's dead. - And she isn't? . No. - Bergman. - Where are you? . - At home. Where are you? . - Gunvald got shot and fell in the sea. - The divers are on it. Get overhere. - I'm on my way. Hurry. - What did he say? . - He thinks you were shot and fell in. - He's right. - He thinks you're still down there. He called in the divers. You have to tell him you're alive. Beck. Go deeper. Where the hell are you? . Why? . What the hell are you... Sources say the shooting was gang-related. Following a car chase through central Stockholm an unknown number of people opened fire in the harbor. One person allegedly died, but the police have not verified this. Divers have... He could've drowned. You did the... Right thing in calling in half the diving to ruin my career. Now it's my family. Okay. All right. We'll take care of this. I'll take care of this. - The doctor said she can go home now. - Great. - Thank you for all you did. - Anne, hold on a second. Your mom must have been 17, 18 when she dated Earl? Pretty conservative times back then. - Excuse me? - Dutch. You said she was going back into her past. I didn't believe you. But then Jeannie went back to the store she used to work at... an apartment where her old boyfriend lived. So why go back to a piece of sidewalk in Echo Park? - Why? - According to the L.A. Times archives... a newborn baby was found smothered to death in that park, November 18, 1947. Buried in a shallow grave. You wanna know where that grave was located? Right where your mother sat today, clawing at the asphalt. They built a sidewalk over the garden. Three blocks from Earl's old apartment. No. - That's impossible. - Someone in there helped kill a baby boy, didn't they? I'm not even going to waste my time with you. You're running Armadillo's drugs through the schools. Where is he? Arma who? Tell me. Tell me. Vic! - Vic, open this door. - Cállete. You ready? - What's going on? - I'm interrogating the suspect. Duardo here runs the drugs through the schools. - Isn't that right? - I'm taking him back to the barn. - I'm not done. - I'm taking him with me. Hand him over. Come here. You gave me the green light to get Armadillo. I'm one step away. I'm a little uncomfortable with the steps you're now taking. I saw the underage C.I. outside. His cover's been blown? We both knew that was a risk. You've done a good job getting this far. I just need to take it from here. - Hey, you want Armadillo or not? - I do. - And Claudette and I will get him. - Claudette? She overheard. There's nothing I can do about it. We've got to do it by the book now. Shane, put him in my car. I spoke to Aceveda. He said I passed my performance review. You deserve to. He also said I had communication and stress management issues that need addressing. - Look, you passed. Okay? - This is because I didn't cover you on that shooting. You still think I'm holding that over you? - Or maybe it's because I'm getting married. - It's because it's the truth. Look, I think it's about something else. Maybe it's because somebody's... messing with your car or they called on your mom, and you're going to take it out on me? Hey, you are way past out of line. I deserved higher marks on that. That... That review goes on my jacket. Truth is, Julien, I could've been a whole lot tougher on you. Your inability to communicate is a serious problem. You have this bottled-up pressure because of your personal life... and no release valve. Things I've seen... Your review could have been a lot worse. I thought about what you said about Vanessa. - Good. - I'm not gonna jeopardize the only good relationship... I've ever had because of something I'm not and will never be again. If you wanna tell her, fine. That's on your conscience. We found the heroin, your little sample bags. We establish the ties... to the schools, and you're sure to get the death penalty for that little boy. The only way to avoid it is to give us Armadillo. He's your boss, right? Your supplier? How does he contact you? Where is he? - Yo, what's up? - I got something for you. This pimp's getting his girls to roll johns in an alley off Western. Okay, we'll check into it. But, tips like this you can give over the phone. Okay. Vic. I really need to know where Brian is. I need to see my son. Connie, you can't. I want him back, Vic. I'm clean. I've got a job now. He's with a new family. You signed him over. I was high then. That's why you gave him up. No. No. I gave him to you to take care of him for me. You knew I'd get clean. You saw how hard I was trying. You don't know what this is like... to lose your kid. Please, Vic. Brian's gone. You have to accept that. Okay. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry too. Uh, that tip I just gave you? I need a cash advance. Thanks. Navaro make any calls yet? - Nope. - They get Duardo to roll? I don't know. I'll be back. - Hey, Carlton. - What's up, Vic? See this guy? He's with the Lancaster Gang Unit. He got you a spot on their Clean Slate program. - Is that like juvie? - It's better. Get rid of the ink, balls'll drop, come back in a couple years a new man. No one will even recognize you. Hey, I had to pull a lot of favors to get this to happen. - Okay. - Well, I'm waiting. - Thank you. - Go. You killed your baby, didn't you, Earl? You and Jeannie. "Baby Boy Doe buried in the unidentified grave section of the L.A. County Cemetery." We're gonna dig him up, Earl, get your D.N.A. ... prove you were his father. You really think Armadillo's gonna reward you for your loyalty? When we bust him, he's gonna think it's because of you. He's got a lot of friends inside. You're gonna end up burned to death in your cell. And we're gonna get him. All you guys think you're so brilliant. We got you, didn't we? What happens if I tell you where he is? We'll make sure you're safe and sound in Ossining, New York. I can only tell you where he's been staying lately. - What's up? - Duardo gave us Armadillo. He's at a place in Inglewood. - Great. I'll go get my guys. - Not necessary. - SWAT's already on their way there. - SWAT? I'll let you see him as soon as we bring him in. All right, let's go. Vic. - Hi. What's up? - I was thinking that... we could get together tonight. I can't do it tonight. Rain check? Name the time and the place. You know, I don't think that I can do this anymore. Sure you can. Just another time. No, you know what? Um, this isn't working for me the way that it used to. I gotta get out of here. You're wrong, Detective. You don't know my mother. I just wish you had a chance to know your brother. Should I be worried about you? Not about me. Maybe about the rest of humanity. Bunch of sociopathic little narcissists out for ourselves. Begging, stealing, lying, screwing, raping. Killing our babies. Whatever it takes to have a good time and save our own asses. I can't even believe in an old woman who's too sick to feed herself. And it's not sad. It's not some big surprise. It's just nature. We're animals. Nothing more. And you know what? I'm learning to be okay with that. - Navaro's on the phone? - Less than a minute. - Prison switchboard confirms he's talking to Armadillo. - Give me the number. This is 323. Aceveda's going to Inglewood. - That's 310. - He's got the wrong address. Go get the right one, quick. - What's he saying? - Um, Armadillo's asking him something in Spanish. - Something about a lawyer. - Vic. - What? - We can't bring him in alive. - What? - Armadillo. We can't bring him in alive. - Why is that? - If we take him in, the only thing he has to deal is us. Look, I don't like it, but this bastard has to go, Vic. Jail won't slow him down. You tried reasoning with him. I'm not going to lose my job... so some kid-raping piece of shit can bargain down his sentence, make me his bunk-mate. Uh-uh. - You talk to Shane about this? - No, but I can. - 3938 Bonita Vista. - Okay, let's go. Ronnie, stay on the line. Call us with anything we need. Lem, you drive. Hey, uh, shouldn't we be taking two cars? - No, we're good. - Yeah? Armadillo's still on the phone with his bro. First guy who gets a good shot takes it. Go. - Nothing. - Goddamn it. - Think somebody tipped him off? - Who? I don't know. - Yeah? - I hope you all made it. Hey. Weren't you supposed to meet me here to suck my dick? I wanted to speak to you one last time. You better talk to your brother before you start making death threats. I've already taken care of my brother. And now you've been greenlit. Store owner says he heard the shots. He didn't come out to take a look. That make him gutless or smart? - Probably a little of both. - The D.M.V. says she had a '96 Ford Escort registered to her. Where the hell are the tech guys? - A knife fight over on Stanton. - Hurry up and wait time. No, no. I'm gonna try the gum again. You'll be back on the tar in a week. Thanks for your support. - Christ almighty, my whole life is going by. - Vic. Huh. Gilroy's in the house. Hey. What brings you to the front line? A car jacking at 2:00 in the afternoon. Yeah, well. Business as usual on the Farm. Look, uh, I wanted to talk to you in person. The... The command of this new Strike Team. - I'm having a hard time selling you to the chief. - Oh, balls! I know the area. I know the players. No one can do this better than me. The chief's not looking for somebody better. He's looking for somebody more... What? What's the problem? He's worried about all your run-ins with Plotkin. - Aw, Plotkin was an asshole. - He was your superior. Yeah, and I've done my penance for a year and a half because of him. - I'm never gonna get another shot? - Not this one, Vic. I'm sorry. No. I need to get out on the street, cleaning it up. I mean, you gotta talk to the chief again. - What? - You can make it happen. Pull a favor. Just get me the assignment. Get me Shane on the Strike Team. - That's another one with a spotty jacket. - Shane's a good cop. And he works well with me. You can fill the rest of the team with whoever you like. Ben, I need this. I've only got one marker to use with the chief. If it use it, I need results. I need them quick... - or we're both out of a job. - Just give me the chance. The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug. - Your own team, wow. - I just can't blow it. - You won't. - A lot of O. T. It's more money, but it's less time with you and the kids. We'll manage. You have to do this. - Ben picked you, didn't he? - Yeah. After looking for any reason not to. And he couldn't find one, so show him. Whoa! Can I help you? I'm Detective Mackey. I'm running the Strike Team. We're still interviewing for that position. I hope not. Assistant Chief Gilroy told me I start tomorrow. I figured I'd settle in early. Hit the ground running. Gilroy told you that? Huh. I'm Captain David Aceveda. - You said your name was Mackey, right? - Yeah. I read your file. We have a chance to do something real special here. Well, you let me know how I can help. I don't care how you did it in the past. But in this house, we're gonna work together. Special squads, detectives, uniformed police officers. We'll help each other and share information however and whenever we can. It's the only way that this satellite precinct can work. I'd like to thank the man responsible for our new jobs, Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy. Thank you, Captain. You all know this unit is a trial squad. An expensive one. People say it's a waste of time and tax dollars. I don't believe that. Let's prove them wrong. - Thanks, Big Ben. - Good luck, Vic. Come on, Brent. I remember you. Sofer, uh, you did your P-2 over at Central, huh? - Yeah. - Who sucked you into this hellhole? I couldn't pass up the long hours and the low pay. - You ready, boot? - Yes, Ma'am. - Don't ever call me "ma'am." - Yes, sir. - Just Danny, okay? - All right, Danny. I know you two haven't worked Farmington as much as Shane and I have... so I want you to get out on the street, cultivate C.I.s... - find out who's hating, who's mating. - Knowledge is power. Cool. When do we get started? Already have. I put a list together of the neighborhood dickheads. We're gonna make some house calls. Let them know who's new in town. This is gonna rock, man. Thanks for letting me join the band. - Might have been a mistake. - Oh, yeah? Who let the guy with the mustache in? - The ladies love the 'stache. - Listen, guys. Trust isn't something that happens overnight. And trust me, where we're going, we're gonna need it. Yeah. Sorry. We... We have a drive-by, gang-related, one fatality. That's you. - We're on. - Let's do it. - What happened? - Yo, man, they killed Wanda. They took Jolene off in an ambulance. - Polly's shot somewhere. - Looks like you got off easy. - Who did it? - Yo, man, I didn't see him. - What's your name? - Ringo. - Parents didn't like you enough to name you after John or Paul? - No, I know Ringo. - Oh, yeah? - Small-time pimp daddy. Who'd you piss off? Yo, man, I was just walkin' with my girls, minding' the store. That's all. I mean in the last couple of days. No one. Someone's trying to mark their territory. Who's the lion? See what you can drum up out of Ringo. I know one of the girls that works for him. Owes me. - I'll see if she can help. - Okay. The classroom's where you learn the rules, but 70% of the job is instinct. Morning, Jules. Black tea, please. You want anything? Uh, orange juice and a breakfast burrito. - I'll take care of that. - That's okay, man. On the house. I appreciate that, but I have to pay. Regulations. - Five bucks. - There you go. Oh, my God. Vic. Can I come in? Sure, yeah. - You taking care of Brian now? - He stays with my mom most of the time. Sometimes she's got this thing like three, four hours though. - And then you're alone with him? - He's fine. I don't fix while I'm watchin' him. One of Ringo's girls was killed today. Another one got shot. I heard about Wanda. She was okay. Uh, any idea who might have done it? Well, you heard it from somewhere else? Lionel Phipps or his guys. - Who is he? - From the neighborhood. Got his hands in drugs. Decided he wanted to get a piece of our asses. Ringo didn't wanna pay the tax. Next thing you know... Stay away from Ringo. He's a walking target right now. That's my mom. Time for me to get to work. If Lionel is the Lion, then what does that make you, his wives or his cubs? Who wants to tell us about the drive-bys this morning? - Stop feeling me up, faggot. - You getting a hard-on, faggot? Bitch ass! Hey, hey, hey! Against the wall! Up against the wall! Man, he's the asshole who started it, man. There's also about a dozen citizens watching us, man. - Just one mistake, that's all it takes. - Look, he's the cocksucker... Who just put himself on our list. But when the time is right, understood? Yeah. I'm sorry. All right. Let's wrap them up and take them home. Get your ass up! - Wagenbach? - Yeah. Hi, I'm Dutch... - You're two hours late. - What? - At Sunset, detectives start at 9:00. - You start here at 7:00. - Yes, sir. I didn't... - You're lucky there's a desk left. That's by the kitchen and the women's restroom. - Is there anything else? - There was at 7:00. Uh, you might as well make yourself useful. A rape victim led us back to the vacant building she was held in. - Detectives Gannon and Wyms are headed there now. - Tom Gannon? - Do you know him? - Not personally. Everyone knows he solved Beachwood Canyon. - I hear he's great. - He's punctual. Managed to loose the ropes, punch out the window with her bare hands to get out. There have been other women here. Vacant building, quiet street. Not much chance of witnesses. Dutch Wagenbach, Farmington Division. Over here, we just call it the Farm. Tom Gannon. I know. Beachwood Canyon Slasher. - Claudette Wyms. - Wyms? - You been on the force long? - Long enough. - I'm sorry. I just haven't heard of you. - Why would you? I like to keep up on my colleagues. Follow the bigger cases. - So, Butch... - Dutch. We got a Salvadorean illegal, doesn't speak English... won't give her name, her parents, just her story. - Which is? - She was kidnapped, held here by three cholos. They called somebody for ransom. Threatened to rape her if they didn't pay. Called back later, family didn't have the money yet, so they went to town on her. After they were done, they tied her up, left. She managed to escape. First one to roll on Lionel gets a free pass. The rest don't. So who's talking? You don't think I'm gonna get Lionel with or without you? Okay. I'll be back in an hour. See who changes his mind. Screw you! I don't think we're looking at typical rapists. Sexual predators are antisocial. They're driven by inadequacy, not money. Our three will have rap sheets, but for violent crimes other than rape. The sexual assault was a punishment to them, not a proclivity. Best desk in the house. Right here by the kitchen, the men's room. - We lucked out. - This isn't an isolated case. Seems like a lot of illegal immigrants have been getting snatched up on the Farm. - Our stats don't show that. - The families don't report it. They just pay. Several people said I should talk to someone named Jesus Latigo. - Who's he? - Well, I don't know, but I got him coming in. - Great. - That's good work, Wyms, but I got you beat. I dug up a witness, says she saw three guys driving off from the crime scene. So I'm running a partial plate. I'll fill in the boss. So, Tom, when you broke Beachwood, what made you think the stepbrother? Something just wasn't right about that kid. His stepsister was all cut up... but he didn't even seem worried about his mother's safety or his two real sisters. - You see, he loved them. - Anyone know what the partner situation is around here? - Captain's still working on it. - Maybe we could work together. I could learn a lot from you. Yeah. Well... maybe it'll end up like that. - When I heard what had happened to Anabel, I was sick. - How did you know her family? - I'm a friend. - Well, we have to talk to them. - See what the kidnappers said to them. - They won't come in. My clients are illegals. You know how it is. - I thought you were a friend of the family. - I am. Are they also your clients? Are you a lawyer? No, no. I'm just a friend. Everyone I talked to said that you're the man to see about dealing with kidnappers. What does that mean? I've really said too much. No, you haven't. Oh, Jesus Christ! Goddamn it. I didn't mean that. I was told this is the ladies room. Oh, I guess it is. Gannon, you creaky old sack of shit. What are you doing? Gilroy asked me to do him a favor and bring a little credibility to this old barn. Barn. I like that. - I heard you're running the Strike Team. - Yeah. - They're giving me the shot. - That's good. Plotkin's probably pissing blood just thinking about it. Have you talked to Joe Clarke lately? - He's enjoying his retirement. - I'm looking forward to it myself. These are my guys now. This is, uh, Curtis, Shane and Ronnie. - Good, as always. - Hey. - What are you working on now? - Some illegal got gang-banged. The victim's more concerned with Mommy and Daddy's I.N.S. status... than catching the pricks that spooned her. - Who are you partnered up with? - That black girl and some Dutch guy. - Who? - Come here. Come take a look. I keep hiding his chair on him. - You're starting already? - Every house needs a rube. - And you're anointing this guy? - Oh, yeah. I got the scoop from Sunset. His wife was a big boozer, so he puts her in A.A., thinkin' he's getting her help. And she ends up getting shtupped by her sponsor. And the kicker is she finally tells him not only is she leaving him... - she's having this other guy's kid. - Oh, no, no. Maybe we should cut him a break then. Nah. My guy says that Dutch-boy is just a big windbag, needs his sails trimmed. - Doesn't anyone knock? - This one's Wyms. - Hello. - Hello. I got someone in interrogation. - Who? - Why don't you come upstairs and find out? Yeah, I'll be right there. All business. She'll never last around here. - This ain't gonna work. - What do you mean? There's not enough oxygen in there for the three of us. - Fletch, you hang back. We'll tell you how it goes. - Sure. Mr. Latigo, this is my partner, Tom Gannon. There's just one cage here, right? - Uh, excuse me. Where did our prisoners go? - The captain released them. - Why? - Ask him. - Captain, I have a question. - Yes? Well, I was just wondering why you cut my prisoners loose without checking with me. I saw the paperwork. It was a mess. There was no probable cause. The D.A. wouldn't have taken the case, so I let them go. Maybe you'll remember this the next time you turn in such sloppy paperwork. I wasn't looking for a conviction. I was just sweating' them. It's a holding cell, Detective, not a sauna. It's reserved for legitimate, actual arrests. - They were part of my murder investigation. - What investigation? I haven't seen anything of merit. Where are the suspects? Where are the leads? You sent them off packing. Commanding the Strike Team is a prized position. We had a lot of candidates just as qualified, if not more. So get your act together, or I'll find someone else. Are we clear? Yes, sir. How's the first day going? A few bugs, but I'm working them out. Anything I should know about? Your guy Mackey, he's not off to a very impressive start. - He'll get results. - Maybe. But I'd like to put a backup plan in place. Fill the last open slot with a guy who could... run the Strike Team if Mackey flunked out. Give the man a chance, David. It's day one. I've read his file, called around. A lot of people won't work with him. It's a crucial slot. We can do better. I need this experiment to be successful. - So do you. - Then we need someone who can deliver. He will. Come up with some candidates though, just in case. I'll pick somebody personally. No, come up with a few guys, run them through my office. - You shouldn't have to be bothered. - It's too important. I'm making all personnel decisions around here. Just keep an eye on things. I'll be in touch later. Hey. Heard about your spat with Aceveda. Aw, we're just getting used to each other. No time for a learning curve, Vic. The chief gave me everything I wanted here... but I had to take on Aceveda. He's not going anywhere. Now, do you have leads on this drive-by or not? Hell, yeah. We think this street thug named Lionel is behind it. - Then make your case, and put the Strike Team on the map. - We will. Just might need a little more time. The chief's not gonna have any patience. Which means I don't either. We clear? The people I've talked to say you're a ransom broker. Detaining someone is a heinous crime, but very lucrative in Latin America. - Detain, my ass. You're a goddamn kidnapper. - I'm a consultant. The kidnappers demand a ransom. The families hire me to broker the deal, get their loved ones back safely. - And you do this out of the goodness of your heart? - I charge a commission. I have a 100% recovery rate. - 'Cause your buddies are the ones doing the kidnapping. - No. Because I understand how to negotiate with these people. The Salvadoreans do not. Negotiate with what people? Mexicans. They see the Salvadoreans as lower class. They target them. - And what are you? - Honduran. So, look, where are these kidnappers now? I've never met them. We arrange a drop. - How do you contact them? - They page me to a pay phone. - Next time they page you, you tell us. - Look. I'm successful because the families and the kidnappers both trust me. I lead you to these men. All the others will never work with me again. If there were no more brokers, it would be harder to do business... - and maybe the kidnappings would stop. - Oh, no. There'll always be kidnappings. And the families will hire other brokers who don't care. Brokers who take the money and keep it. And the kidnappers will kill the victims. And the broker says, "That's just the way it goes." Well, I care. I pay the money. I get people back alive. Look, are you gonna lead us to these guys or not? I can't. - Talk to me. - We wait a couple of weeks. We wait till one of Lionel's guys slips up on some felony. - And then we flip him. - We don't have a couple of weeks. Lem and I spoke to Narcotics and Vice. They've been trying to make a case against Lionel for months. They're at a dead end. - They have nothing for us? - That's what they said. God! We gotta nail him, like right now. Okay, so we keep at him. We hit him long enough and hard enough, he'll get the message. You an expert on making guys long and hard? Hey, this isn't funny. I mean, it's the goddamn first day, and the bosses are already talking about making changes. Anybody here feel like going back to their old post? Huh? Look, I hate to say this, but, uh... I think we need a shortcut. Like what? Maybe we need to squeeze a guy in Lionel's outfit, make him produce some evidence for us. That'd speed things up a bit. Produce as in plant? Hey, we all know that this guy's an asshole in the first degree. It's for goddamn sure this isn't the first body he's responsible for. - I don't know, man. - You just hear me out. A high-profile bust gets us credibility out on the street and with the bosses. Once we get our feet on solid ground, get a couple of wins under our belt... we go back to doing it the right way. Hey, we need this. Just this once. Hey, where we goin'? Ain't no police station this way. Yeah, well, we a mobile unit. Why you in such a hurry to go to jail anyway? Bringin' me in for a couple of joints, man? I ain't doin' time for no three sticks of chronic. With your record, I wouldn't be too sure. You're gonna help us build a case against Lionel. Are you on the pipe? - You see that? - We had our own tagger do some work. We're the new king of this jungle. - You think painting'a snake on the wall makes you top dog? - Wanna go back for possession? You guys may be the cops, but Lionel's the law around here. You gotta bring it a lot heavier than this to change people's minds. - I don't think he's gonna cooperate. - Give it time. - If he doesn't? - I'm thinking. You know what? Screw Rondell. We'll just try another homie. - Lionel will catch wind of it. - Can't stake him out. He's smart. If we bring him in for piddley shit, Captain Ass will just kick him. Why don't we get a warrant based on suspicion of the shooting? We drop the evidence ourselves. Lionel will scream "setup." And that's exactly what it will look like. - It can't even remotely appear like we brought the shit in. - No. No, we've gotta have another cop find it. How about planting it in his car? Crib's the best bet. When's it empty? It isn't. He's got girls streaming in and out of there day and night. We don't need you to tell us when they call. - We'll just wait, get the page ourselves. - No, they use a code. Without me, the number won't make any sense. I tried to interrogate our victim again. She still won't talk. They don't trust the police. That's why they come to me for help. I do this community a service. It's not just about the money. I help families pro bono... Cut the champion of the people crap. - So what happened? - Mayfield Duffy... pushed a cart full of groceries out of the store without paying. When my husband went to stop him, he got attacked. - What did he hit you with? - A bag of ice. - Go call the paramedics. - Mayfield is okay. He just had a bad run. No work. - He said he will pay for the stuff later. - I told him we don't do that. No money, no groceries. Look, I don't wanna get Mayfield in no trouble. I just want the money or the groceries back. Well, sir, he committed a felony. We're gonna have to arrest him. Well, then go do it. He took perishables. - Yeah? - Step out of the apartment, please. - You Mayfield Duffy? - Yeah. - Step down, please, sir. - Hands out of your pockets, sir, and behind your head. - What's the beef? - Turn around. - I told him I'd pay him. - Before or after you struck him? - Is Otto okay? I didn't mean to hit him hard. - Yeah, he's okay. Second set of cuffs. You know there are places where you can go for aid, sir. - I got aid. Then I got robbed. - Robbed? I get food stamps twice a month. That punk gangster in 29... keeps breaking into the mailbox and stealing everybody's food stamps. It will be days before I can get some more. Meanwhile, my family's starving. What am I supposed to do? Not commit a felony. - Use this purse. - It's got a false bottom and a remote mike inside. - What's that, coke? - Crack. The sentencing is more severe. Give me your purse. Come on. I want you to go inside Lionel's apartment. You tell him that you're willing to pay a street tax... to stay out working and stay safe. - I don't even know this guy. - He knows about you. You hide the crack in his bathroom, under the sink or something. This is the guy who shot up Wanda? It'll be a pleasure then. Hey, hey. You're miked. We can hear everything. If at any time the mike fails, we'll be in there, okay? - Okay. - Listen. This guy is bad. If it seems dangerous, you just say the word "gringo." Then we come riding to the rescue. - Gringo? - Yeah. Right. Hey. I mean it. Any sign of worry, you say the word. - You Happy Sandez? - Yeah, that's me. What of it? You the same Happy Sandez that's been breaking into people's mailboxes... - stealing their food stamps? - Food stamps? - I don't need no ghetto coupons. - Happy, we got your sheet, man. You got three priors for theft and no job. Why don't you give those people their food stamps back so they can eat? I'm missing the game. I tell you what, Happy. My partner and I are gonna go around the corner for exactly two minutes. And when we come back... either the food stamps you took are sitting on that bottom step... or I'm gonna call some detectives down here... and they're gonna turn your life upside down. You got it? You got two minutes. Screw Ringo. I'm willing to pay you. - I don't wanna get shot up. - Smart thinking', sweet pea. - So are we cool then? - Nah, not quite. See, I like to know what I'm puttin' on the streets. Come here. Right here. - He wants to taste the kitty. - Sure. - Just let me run to the bathroom. - What for? To pop in my diaphragm. No need, baby girl. I ain't hitting that raw. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, God. The broker is a pipeline, but he's decent. If we talk to him the right way, he'll talk. That broker is a dead end. I got my witness coming in. I think she's our best bet. You know, I got 30 years experience says... if we slap this broker with obstruction of justice... he misses one home-cooked meal, he'll talk. - Tom's got seniority. Follow his lead. - The witness is here. - Hi. I'm Detective Gannon. Thanks for coming. - Carry on. So, uh, hypothetically... how would you go after the broker? The boss wants to do it Gannon's way. And he's going his way. Doesn't mean we can't go ours. They teach you that in the classroom? Goddamn, you're tight. Oh, God. - You ain't gonna dis me again, right? - No, I swear. Right? - I'm going in. - Hey, hey, hey. She didn't say gringo. - I'm going. - Hey! We don't have a warrant. And we're only gonna get one shot at this. All right? I don't care. Hey, god-goddamn it! Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man. Hey. She's a pro. This is what she does for a living. We gotta make this case, right? Right? - Oh, for God's sake. - Hey, Vic, Vic, Vic. Come here. Come here. Hey, look. We're almost there now, right? All right? It's in the bathroom, under the sink. God. Vic, I'm okay. Vic. I need to score before you take me home. - Nice digs, David. - Nice enough. You don't sound too excited. No, I am. It's just... Gilroy's stocked the pond with his own fish. I'm still figuring out what waters are safe to swim in. I could use a friendly face working here. Is this gonna be like the time you tried to get me to work Narcotics in the Valley? - It'll be different. - How? You'll say yes. - I'm happy in Robbery. - This is more money, more action, more fun. - So what's the job? - Gilroy's pick for the Strike Team, Vic Mackey. There's a spot on the team. Take it. If Mackey doesn't work out... - you'll take his place. - Run the Strike Team? Even if he does work out, it's still a great gig. Come on. It's a no-lose situation for you. Your boy's going down tonight. The question is are you going down with him? Lionel's got drugs in his crib. - Lionel don't keep drugs at his crib. - I guess he got sloppy. Makes me wonder. You ever get sloppy? You wouldn't. Aw, shit! So we busted Rondell here on possession for distribution. - He wants to deal now. - What can you offer us? - My boss, Lionel. - We think he did the drive-bys. I made deliveries to his house. He's got product there. You gotta move on him right away though. - And you're willing to swear to this in an affidavit? - Sure. Whatever it takes. Detective Vendrell, let's take his statement. Call for a warrant. - Impressive. - Thanks. Getting him to roll on a heavy hitter... for a misdemeanor marijuana charge. I can't take all the credit. I don't think he fully grasps the distinction between felony and misdemeanor. When that paperwork comes in... I'd like to go on that bust with you. See you in action. Sure thing. Your pager just went off. I know we don't have much time. - Sorry. I'm bound by tradition. - This tradition... - does it always include multiple rape? - No, that was wrong of them. What if the kidnappers decide the family owes them money? They could go after her again. They probably will. I see how you're being honorable. You tell me how they're being honorable. Look, if you helped us though, if you led us to them, it would be a message to them... that the brokers are not the only ones who have to follow by the rules, so do the kidnappers. Your community would understand that. They could appreciate the honor in it. Informant? Yo, who the hell told you I got drugs? That's confidential for security reasons. - I'm sure you understand. - Yo, don't play me, dog. - I've got a right to face my accuser. - You can mention that at trial. Hey, yo, man. Take it easy over there. Hey, you heard the man. Respect the property. Got something. Whoa. How many years of experience in this room... and the goddamn rookie finds the brick on his first day. - Let me see that, man. - Nice. Yeah, damn straight. The kid's a natural. - I taught him everything he knows. - I'll bet you did. Yo, that ain't mine, man. This is a stone-cold setup. - You put it there. - Found it under your sink, sir. - Well, this is a goddamn setup, man. - Vic, Vic. - Check this shit out. - That's a TAC-9. It's the same kind of gun used in the drive-by. We plant this too? Yo, look. I didn't shoot nobody. Is that what ballistics is gonna tell us about that dead hooker? I didn't think so. - I have 10 minutes to get there. - We better hurry. Just get in the cage. - Good work, Vic. You know, you really pulled it together. - Thanks. The chief's happy. He wants another press conference to trumpet the quick results. - I'll do most of the talking, but he wants you there too. - Sure. Detective. We got a call from our kidnappers. We set up a drop. You mind getting our backs? The captain said we could help each other out. Hey, my day's just getting started. Shut up! Get down. Stop! Get back here! Stop, goddamn it! - Down. Hands behind your back. - Where do you think you're going? You got him cuffed? I said stop! Goddamn it! All right, we're secure here. - You all right? - I got him. Keep looking. - Th-That's them. - Which ones? Those ones. Hey, what happened? Latigo had a change of heart. - You didn't tell me that. - It happened quickly. I've been sitting right here. - Those our kidnappers? - Well, uh... our broker cooperated, led us to them. Well done. Thanks. - You didn't have to do that. - Credit's overrated. Tangible results. Nice goddamn job. Both of you, really. I told you he'd deliver. - I just didn't think twice on the first day. - What did you expect? The whole team worked well together. Some things could have been smoother, but we'll get there. I'm sure his public defender will have some questions. - It's just a few scratches. - From being dragged through barbed wire. I told him to stop. - Bet you next time he listens. - Come on, fellas. The job's hard enough without tension between the walls. We should be celebrating. Yeah. Nathan, you gotta be kidding me. What am I supposed to do now? - Use the ladies room. - Jesus Christ. Relax. The plumber promised me he'd get to it tomorrow. Try not to destroy that one too. The obvious thing would have been to go Gannon's way. Instead, you got Latigo to do exactly what he didn't wanna do and feel good doing it. Some cases you get an instinct. - I don't get it. How come I haven't heard of you? - It's a mystery. I was thinking... maybe we could serve as partners again. - You know, on a permanent basis. - Wherever I'm needed. So, if I spoke to Aceveda, asked him to put us together, you wouldn't mind? No, I wouldn't mind. Okay, who took my chair? Hey, Lem and Ronnie are psyched. We're gonna go get a beer. Start without me. I gotta take care of something first. Look, I, uh, I talked to both of them, and they're cool about what went down. - Good. - We got Lionel. - Got us a little breathing room. - Yeah. - It was easy, wasn't it? - Yeah. It was a little too easy. My church conducts monthly food drives in Farmington to help feed families. I don't need the gospel. I need work. My pastor knows a lot of people. I'll ask him if someone's hiring. Next time, find some help before you do something stupid. Yeah. - What are you doing? - I'm just letting him know where his family could get some help. If you're gonna get emotionally involved with every collar... get off the streets and into social work. You don't have to tell me about the streets. I grew up on them. Living in them and working in them are two different things. Look, I know I got a lot to learn about police work. And you've got your way that works for you. But I got a way I wanna try for me. Hey. Oh, Jesus. - I didn't know we're coed. - Welcome to the experiment. - I'll be out in a sec. - All right. Cool. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. It was a good day today. Hey, man. So how was it out there? Fine. Yeah. There's nothing like your first time. - I didn't think Gilroy was ever gonna sign off on me. - Don't take it personally. - He was just busy. - Well, I'm glad to be here. You'll like it. Oh, the john's still broke. I'm working on it. - You ready? - Yeah, I'm ready for anything. Good, 'cause we get everything down here. Starting to get a rep out on the street. Bad guys don't like seeing us. It's starting to get fun. Hey, hey. - This here is Terry. He comes to us from Robbery. - Robbery? - We love you, pretty boys from Robbery. - How you doing? Store owner says he heard the shots. He didn't come out to take a look. That make him gutless or smart? –Probably a little of both. –The D.M.V says she had a '96 Ford Escort registered to her. Where the hell are the tech guys? –A knife fight over on Stanton. –Hurry up and wait time. No, no. I'm gonna try the gum again. You'll be back on the tar in a week. Thanks for your support. –Christ almighty, my whole life is going by. –Vic. Huh. Gilroy's in the house. Hey. What brings you to the front line? A car jacking at 2:00 in the afternoon. Yeah, well. Business as usual on the Farm. Look, uh, I wanted to talk to you in person. The... The command of this new Strike Team. –I'm having a hard time selling you to the chief. –Oh, balls! I know the area. I know the players. No one can do this better than me. The chief's not looking for somebody better. He's looking for somebody more... What? What's the problem? He's worried about all your run-ins with Plotkin. –Aw, Plotkin was an asshole. –He was your superior. Yeah, and I've done my penance for a year and a half because of him. –I'm never gonna get another shot? –Not this one, Vic. I'm sorry. No. I need to get out on the street, cleaning it up. I mean, you gotta talk to the chief again. –What? –You can make it happen. Pull a favor. Just get me the assignment. Get me Shane on the Strike Team. –That's another one with a spotty jacket. –Shane's a good cop. And he works well with me. You can fill the rest of the team with whoever you like. Ben, I need this. I've only got one marker to use with the chief. If it use it, I need results. I need them quick... or we're both out of a job. –Just give me the chance. The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug. –Your own team, wow. –I just can't blow it. –You won't. –A lot of O.T. It's more money, but it's less time with you and the kids. We'll manage. You have to do this. –Ben picked you, didn't he? –Yeah. After looking for any reason not to. And he couldn't find one, so show him. Whoa! Can I help you? I'm Detective Mackey. I'm running the Strike Team. We're still interviewing for that position. I hope not. Assistant Chief Gilroy told me I start tomorrow. I figured I'd settle in early. Hit the ground running. Gilroy told you that? Huh. I'm Captain David Aceveda. –You said your name was Mackey, right? –Yeah. I read your file. We have a chance to do something real special here. Well, you let me know how I can help. I don't care how you did it in the past. But in this house, we're gonna work together. Special squads, detectives, uniformed police officers. We'll help each other and share information however and whenever we can. It's the only way that this satellite precinct can work. I'd like to thank the man responsible for our new jobs, Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy. Thank you, Captain. You all know this unit is a trial squad. An expensive one. People say it's a waste of time and tax dollars. I don't believe that. Let's prove them wrong. –Thanks, Big Ben. –Good luck, Vic. Come on, Brent. I remember you. Sofer, uh, you did your P-2 over at Central, huh? –Yeah. –Who sucked you into this hellhole? I couldn't pass up the long hours and the low pay. –You ready, boot? –Yes, Ma'am. –Don't ever call me "ma'am." –Yes, sir. –Just Danny, okay? –All right, Danny. I know you two haven't worked Farmington as much as Shane and I have... so I want you to get out on the street, cultivate C.Is... find out who's hating, who's mating. –Knowledge is power. Cool. When do we get started? Already have. I put a list together of the neighborhood dickheads. We're gonna make some house calls. Let them know who's new in town. This is gonna rock, man. Thanks for letting me join the band. –Might have been a mistake. –Oh, yeah? Who let the guy with the mustache in? –The ladies love the 'stache. –Listen, guys. Trust isn't something that happens overnight. And trust me, where we're going, we're gonna need it. Yeah. Sorry. We... We have a drive-by, gang-related, one fatality. That's you. –We're on. –Let's do it. –What happened? –Yo, man, they killed Wanda. They took Jolene off in an ambulance. –Polly's shot somewhere. –Looks like you got off easy. –Who did it? –Yo, man, I didn't see him. –What's your name? –Ringo. –Parents didn't like you enough to name you after John or Paul? –No, I know Ringo. –Oh, yeah? –Small-time pimp daddy. Who'd you piss off? Yo, man, I was just walkin' with my girls, minding' the store. That's all. I mean in the last couple of days. No one. Someone's trying to mark their territory. Who's the lion? See what you can drum up out of Ringo. I know one of the girls that works for him. Owes me. –I'll see if she can help. –Okay. The classroom's where you learn the rules, but 70% of the job is instinct. Morning, Jules. Black tea, please. You want anything? Uh, orange juice and a breakfast burrito. –I'll take care of that. –That's okay, man. On the house. I appreciate that, but I have to pay. Regulations. –Five bucks. –There you go. Oh, my God. Vic. Can I come in? Sure, yeah. –You taking care of Brian now? –He stays with my mom most of the time. Sometimes she's got this thing like three, four hours though. –And then you're alone with him? –He's fine. I don't fix while I'm watchin' him. One of Ringo's girls was killed today. Another one got shot. I heard about Wanda. She was okay. Uh, any idea who might have done it? Well, you heard it from somewhere else? Lionel Phipps or his guys. –Who is he? –From the neighborhood. Got his hands in drugs. Decided he wanted to get a piece of our asses. Ringo didn't wanna pay the tax. Next thing you know... Stay away from Ringo. He's a walking target right now. That's my mom. Time for me to get to work. If Lionel is the Lion, then what does that make you, his wives or his cubs? Who wants to tell us about the drive-bys this morning? –Stop feeling me up, faggot. –You getting a hard-on, faggot? Bitch ass! Hey, hey, hey! Against the wall! Up against the wall! Man, he's the asshole who started it, man. There's also about a dozen citizens watching us, man. –Just one mistake, that's all it takes. –Look, he's the cocksucker... Who just put himself on our list. But when the time is right, understood? Yeah. I'm sorry. All right. Let's wrap them up and take them home. Get your ass up! –Wagenbach? –Yeah. Hi, I'm Dutch... –You're two hours late. –What? –At Sunset, detectives start at 9:00. –You start here at 7:00. –Yes, sir. I didn't... –You're lucky there's a desk left. That's by the kitchen and the women's restroom. –Is there anything else? –There was at 7:00. Uh, you might as well make yourself useful. A rape victim led us back to the vacant building she was held in. –Detectives Gannon and Wyms are headed there now. –Tom Gannon? –Do you know him? –Not personally. Everyone knows he solved Beachwood Canyon. –I hear he's great. –He's punctual. Managed to loose the ropes, punch out the window with her bare hands to get out. There have been other women here. Vacant building, quiet street. Not much chance of witnesses. Dutch Wagenbach, Farmington Division. Over here, we just call it the Farm. Tom Gannon. I know. Beachwood Canyon Slasher. –Claudette Wyms. –Wyms? –You been on the force long? –Long enough. –I'm sorry. I just haven't heard of you. –Why would you? I like to keep up on my colleagues. Follow the bigger cases. –So, Butch... –Dutch. We got a Salvadorean illegal, doesn't speak English... won't give her name, her parents, just her story. –Which is? –She was kidnapped, held here by three cholos. They called somebody for ransom. Threatened to rape her if they didn't pay. Called back later, family didn't have the money yet, so they went to town on her. After they were done, they tied her up, left. She managed to escape. First one to roll on Lionel gets a free pass. The rest don't. So who's talking? You don't think I'm gonna get Lionel with or without you? Okay. I'll be back in an hour. See who changes his mind. Screw you! I don't think we're looking at typical rapists. Sexual predators are antisocial. They're driven by inadequacy, not money. Our three will have rap sheets, but for violent crimes other than rape. The sexual assault was a punishment to them, not a proclivity. Best desk in the house. Right here by the kitchen, the men's room. –We lucked out. –This isn't an isolated case. Seems like a lot of illegal immigrants have been getting snatched up on the Farm. –Our stats don't show that. –The families don't report it. They just pay. Several people said I should talk to someone named Jesus Latigo. –Who's he? –Well, I don't know, but I got him coming in. –Great. –That's good work, Wyms, but I got you beat. I dug up a witness, says she saw three guys driving off from the crime scene. So I'm running a partial plate. I'll fill in the boss. So, Tom, when you broke Beachwood, what made you think the stepbrother? Something just wasn't right about that kid. His stepsister was all cut up... but he didn't even seem worried about his mother's safety or his two real sisters. –You see, he loved them. –Anyone know what the partner situation is around here? –Captain's still working on it. –Maybe we could work together. I could learn a lot from you. Yeah. Well... maybe it'll end up like that. –When I heard what had happened to Anabel, I was sick. –How did you know her family? –I'm a friend. –Well, we have to talk to them. –See what the kidnappers said to them. –They won't come in. My clients are illegals. You know how it is. –I thought you were a friend of the family. –I am. Are they also your clients? Are you a lawyer? No, no. I'm just a friend. Everyone I talked to said that you're the man to see about dealing with kidnappers. What does that mean? I've really said too much. No, you haven't. Oh, Jesus Christ! Goddamn it. I didn't mean that. I was told this is the ladies room. Oh, I guess it is. Gannon, you creaky old sack of shit. What are you doing? Gilroy asked me to do him a favor and bring a little credibility to this old barn. Barn. I like that. –I heard you're running the Strike Team. –Yeah. –They're giving me the shot. –That's good. Plotkin's probably pissing blood just thinking about it. Have you talked to Joe Clarke lately? –He's enjoying his retirement. –I'm looking forward to it myself. These are my guys now. This is, uh, Curtis, Shane and Ronnie. –Good, as always. –Hey. –What are you working on now? –Some illegal got gang-banged. The victim's more concerned with Mommy and Daddy's I.N.S status... than catching the pricks that spooned her. –Who are you partnered up with? –That black girl and some Dutch guy. –Who? –Come here. Come take a look. I keep hiding his chair on him. –You're starting already? –Every house needs a rube. –And you're anointing this guy? –Oh, yeah. I got the scoop from Sunset. His wife was a big boozer, so he puts her in A.A, thinkin' he's getting her help. And she ends up getting shtupped by her sponsor. And the kicker is she finally tells him not only is she leaving him... she's having this other guy's kid. –Oh, no, no. Maybe we should cut him a break then. Nah. My guy says that Dutch-boy is just a big windbag, needs his sails trimmed. –Doesn't anyone knock? –This one's Wyms. –Hello. –Hello. I got someone in interrogation. –Who? –Why don't you come upstairs and find out? Yeah, I'll be right there. All business. She'll never last around here. –This ain't gonna work. –What do you mean? There's not enough oxygen in there for the three of us. –Fletch, you hang back. We'll tell you how it goes. –Sure. Mr Latigo, this is my partner, Tom Gannon. There's just one cage here, right? –Uh, excuse me. Where did our prisoners go? –The captain released them. –Why? –Ask him. –Captain, I have a question. –Yes? Well, I was just wondering why you cut my prisoners loose without checking with me. I saw the paperwork. It was a mess. There was no probable cause. The D.A wouldn't have taken the case, so I let them go. Maybe you'll remember this the next time you turn in such sloppy paperwork. I wasn't looking for a conviction. I was just sweating' them. It's a holding cell, Detective, not a sauna. It's reserved for legitimate, actual arrests. –They were part of my murder investigation. –What investigation? I haven't seen anything of merit. Where are the suspects? Where are the leads? You sent them off packing. Commanding the Strike Team is a prized position. We had a lot of candidates just as qualified, if not more. So get your act together, or I'll find someone else. Are we clear? Yes, sir. How's the first day going? A few bugs, but I'm working them out. Anything I should know about? Your guy Mackey, he's not off to a very impressive start. –He'll get results. –Maybe. But I'd like to put a backup plan in place. Fill the last open slot with a guy who could... run the Strike Team if Mackey flunked out. Give the man a chance, David. It's day one. I've read his file, called around. A lot of people won't work with him. It's a crucial slot. We can do better. I need this experiment to be successful. –So do you. –Then we need someone who can deliver. He will. Come up with some candidates though, just in case. I'll pick somebody personally. No, come up with a few guys, run them through my office. –You shouldn't have to be bothered. –It's too important. I'm making all personnel decisions around here. Just keep an eye on things. I'll be in touch later. Hey. Heard about your spat with Aceveda. Aw, we're just getting used to each other. No time for a learning curve, Vic. The chief gave me everything I wanted here... but I had to take on Aceveda. He's not going anywhere. Now, do you have leads on this drive-by or not? Hell, yeah. We think this street thug named Lionel is behind it. –Then make your case, and put the Strike Team on the map. –We will. Just might need a little more time. The chief's not gonna have any patience. Which means I don't either. We clear? The people I've talked to say you're a ransom broker. Detaining someone is a heinous crime, but very lucrative in Latin America. –Detain, my ass. You're a goddamn kidnapper. –I'm a consultant. The kidnappers demand a ransom. The families hire me to broker the deal, get their loved ones back safely. –And you do this out of the to ask the fellows. Don't you think I believe you? I didn't want to fight with him... Not that I'm scared to. I wouldn't have minded going up an alley with him. I didn't want to fight on the street. Did any of the other boys take part in the fight? You know... pile on? No. That's what Rodney told his father. He would. Well, they didn't have to. Sam and piggy knew I could lick him. Well, you see, penrod, Mr. bitts believes his boy just the same as I believe you. Now, it isn't very pleasant for me to have to listen to Mr. bitts tell me all day long what a terrible rowdy you are and how you bully a gang at school who'll do anything you tell them to do. Now, I don't like it. Why don't you take a sock at old bitts? You can do it. [Clears throat] Possibly. But Mr. bitts is the one person in this town, outside of the police force, I am not going to take a sock at. I've got to consider my job. If I didn't have you and your mother to think about, I might be tempted to at times. But I've got to be diplomatic... The same as I'd want you to be. You see, when you and Rodney have fights of this sort, it only bounces back on me. And so for my sake, I want you to be... A little nicer to Rodney than you would be probably to the rest of the boys. You see that, don't you? Yes, sir. I'm not asking you to be a softy, but try and get along with Rodney the way I try and get along with his father. You don't want me to apologize to him, do you? No, no, I don't want you to do that, but I do think it would be fine if tomorrow you acted as though nothing had happened and probably were a little nicer to Rodney than maybe you have been. After school, invite him to join in and play whatever games you boys play. I never see Rodney after school. Why not? Just don't go around with our gang, that's all. There's another thing I want to talk to you about, penrod... This gang of yours. Of course, I know some of the boys, but... Mr. bitts said something this afternoon that had me worried. You know... What do you and the boys do after school? That is, until you come home. You didn't get in tonight until quite late. Well... We just go around together. Doing what? Oh, nothing much. You mean to say that you put in the time from 3:00 until 6:00 going around doing nothing? Come on, I'm waiting. I can't tell you, dad. Well, is it something you're ashamed to tell me? No, sir. Well, then I think I have a right to know. It might be something I wouldn't approve. Well, it wouldn't be fair to the g... Boys. All right. Tomorrow after school, you come home and you stay home. And the next day, you do the same thing. In that way, I'll know where you are and what you're doing. Wait a minute, dad. Maybe I can tell you. Yes. I can swear you in so you can be one of us, but... Then you'll be under oath not to tell anyone. What is it, a secret organization? Will you take the oath? Yes, I'll take the oath. Raise your right hand. I promise to be a real 100% American. I promise to be a real 100% American. And to do my bit to help prevent crime. And to do my bit to help prevent crime. And to keep my eyes open. And to keep my eyes open. And if I ever see any suspicious-looking characters... And if I ever see any suspicious-looking characters... Or get any clues... Or get any clues... To get in touch with the police immediately. To get in touch with the police immediately. And furthermore... And furthermore... I promise... I promise... To never reveal the identity of my fellow workers. To never reveal the identity of my fellow workers. Now you're a g-man! A g-man! So that's it, huh? Well, that's fine. Isn't it awfully quiet up there? Maybe the fireworks ain't started yet. Oh dear, I wish penrod wouldn't fight. That Rodney bitts! Yeah! If he was a boy of mine, I'd lay a black hand on his resting place. Oh dear, I hope he doesn't whip him. And that's the way we operate. I see. Well, look... Couldn't we get Rodney to come in with us? Nope. The boys won't have him, dad. Oh, they might if you used your influence. No, you see, I'm like the vice president. I haven't got anything to say about it except in the case of a tie, and Rodney hasn't even come close to getting that many votes. Well anyway, I'll have something to tell Mr. bitts now if he calls you boys gangsters again. No, you mustn't, dad! You can't! You swore not to say anything. Oh, that's right. Well, anyway, I feel better. [Laughing] So do I. You want to come downstairs now? Yeah. Oh... I'll be down in a few minutes. All right, chief. See what my number is. 13! I should have joined earlier. [Both laugh] Not that I'm superstitious, but I should've. Penrod: Ok, dad, I'll be down in about 5 minutes. [Door closes] Duke! Duke, come here! Duke, you know what? You've got to get out of here. Yep. Will you sign these, please? Oh, uh... Mr. Bitts. I haven't had a chance to mention this before today, but I had a talk with my boy last night. Yes? First I want to tell you how sorry I am that such a thing had to happen, and penrod is very much upset about it, too. Well, he should be. Yes, sir. But he's told me that from now on, he and the g... uh, the boys... will be the best of friends. I'm sure that Rodney will be a very good influence for them. I'm sure he will be, yes, sir, but I have penrod's assurance that from now on there will be no more fighting. [Loud crying] Dad, he killed me! [Crying] Dad, he killed me! Rodney, what's happened? Penrod hit me! Penrod! Penrod! Penrod! Why, the little hoodlum! Now wait a minute, bitts, wait a minute. Wait a minute, nothing! I've had enough! That brat of yours ought to be in the reform school! You can't talk that way about my boy! It's time somebody did something about him, the dirty little sneak! Sneak! If anybody's a sneak, it's that boy right there! You take that back! I'll take nothing back! You get out of here! I'll get out of here, but... You get out of here! You take your hands off me! Do you realize that I'm the president...? I don't care who you are! You can't put your hands on me that way! That brat of yours will end up in the penitentiary! Oh, Mr. bitts! Talk about my boy! You better watch your own boy, that's what I think. [Woman screams] Rodney: Get him, dad! Get him! Come on, dad! Sock him! Get him, dad! [People talking at once] Mr. bitts! Mr. bitts! Get your hands off me! Let go of my foot! Get your hands off me! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You're through! You're fired! And you men get back to work! You get inside... oof! Ha ha ha ha ha! Get in there! You're the cause of this whole thing! [Mr. bitts muttering] [Door slams] Duke! Is that you, penrod? Yes, mother. Penrod... Penrod. You've been fighting again. I don't blame your father. He's perfectly right. You're getting to be a regular little roughneck. Wait until he comes home and sees the condition you're in. [Door closes] Frank, you've got to do something about... What's happened, dear? Well, I've been fighting. Fighting? Yes. With whom? Old man bitts. Bitts of all people! Now I know you've gone crazy. And you have the nerve to stand up and lecture your son... Oh! Did you lick him, dad? Me, too. Shake! Sam: Well, why didn't he? But the umpire said it wasn't any good! Well, they could at least said he was safe. What's slats up to? Looks like he's got something hot. Who is it? Looks like the guy on the poster that's wanted for bigamy. Yep! He's got the same kind of hat and the poster said he always carried a cane. Hot diggety! There's $1,000 reward for him! Oh, boy! Come on, slats, get him. Nitwit! That's our new minister. I never saw him before. That makes your score 100% perfect for guys you never saw before. [Groans] We better put him in another department. He's gone screwy with that camera. Yeah, the next thing you know, he'll be taking X-ray pictures of his aunt Lulu's gallstones. [Woman screams] [Siren wailing] [Gunshots] What was that? Sounds like backfiring of a car. Yeah? Well, that's gunfire! Verman? Verman? What's all that noise, mommy? I don't know, child. It sounds like guns. You come on... Get in here! [Kids screaming] Cop: Look out for those kids! Hang on, boys! Verman, crying: Mommy! Cop: Come on, children! Get going! Who is it? It's Mrs. diggs, the washwoman. Here, doctor! Doctor! My mama! I want my mama! Mama! I want my mommy! I want my mom! Mama! I want my mommy! Verman, don't cry. Gotta grit your teeth. Remember, you're a g-man. That's right. Smile, just a little. I want my mommy! [Sobbing] Penrod, will you please stop that? What's the matter with you? You know what's the matter. Now, verman's all right. He's with friends of his mother. Is he gonna live with them all the time? Well, no. They're poor people with a lot of children of their own. But don't worry, dear. He'll be provided for. The county takes good care of little boys like him. Well, why did they have to send him to an orphan asylum? Now, there's nothing wrong with an orphan asylum. Well, I still can't see why dad won't let us adopt him. I've explained why. Oh, dad gives me a... Well, here's good news. Yes? They got one of those gangsters. Only one? The abandoned car was discovered about 20 feet off the main road this side of meadow creek bridge. The dead man was found slumped in the back seat. The g-men will get 'em. The cops has got every road blocked. I hope they shoot every doggone one of them! Penrod! Don't be so bloodthirsty. Well, they killed verman's mother, didn't they? I know but that's no reason... well? Now darling, you'd better run along. Wash your hands and face. It's just about dinner time. Oh, all right. What's the matter with him? He's still worrying about poor little verman. Oh. Why, you sap! What are you trying to do, throw out a flare so those bulls can start blasting? They can't shoot me. I'm out of season. Aw, save your wisecracks. What are you gonna do, sit here until they call out the militia? Yeah, it looks like they already have. I'm so hungry I could eat the bark off this tree. Well, you got your cut of the dough. Why don't you hop into town and grab yourself a hamburger? No, I'll press the button and have one delivered. I'll press you in the button if you don't shut up. But dad, why can't you... Now see here, penrod, you've got to stop this nonsense. I've told you before we can't adopt verman. Now, you're old enough to understand that. Sure, I understand. But that's what I'm trying to tell you. Nobody wants him or cares what happens to him. Well, you'll have to quit carrying the world on your shoulders. Mother: You've got a lot of homework, penrod. You better get started at it. Now, run along, be a good boy. We'll be back in a couple of hours. Oh, all right. Good night, mother. Good night, son. That's the first time he hasn't kissed me. Well Frank, you are a little hard on him. He's very fond of verman. He's all upset about it. Well, he'll just have to snap out of it, that's all. Father: And remember a 2-low trump bid is not a demand bid. Oh, don't start that. [Doorbell rings] Buzz: Oh, Mrs. schofield, is verman with penrod? Why, no. I'd... Do you know where he is? No, why? He's gone! We thought maybe he was over here. He's been gone for a couple hours, and we can't find him anyplace. See, I told you. He's run away. Oh, nonsense. He's probably around at one of the neighbors'. Oh no, Mr. schofield. We looked everywhere. I knew he didn't want to go to the orphan asylum. You're making a Mountain out of a molehill. Yeah, well he's gone, isn't he? Wait a minute, buzz, I'll go with you. We'll find him. You're not going to leave this house tonight. I've gotta. Just tell me where the money is. OLD MAN: I bet you're a good student. Yeah. Thanks for the drink. Sure. I should get going. BROTHER: Sorry I got you into this, bro. Sorry I dragged you into this. MAN 2: Last chance. BROTHER: Don't tell him, bro. Please, don't shoot him. BROTHER: Don't do it. MAN 2: It's up to you. BROTHER: Don't you tell him, bro. Don't tell him. Under the floorboards in the kitchen. MAN 2: There you go. DRIVER: Gary, I'm sorry. BROTHER: It's okay. I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay, bro. It's gonna be okay. No! MAN 1: Oh, Jesus, man, no. DRIVER: No! [BROTHER GASPING] MAN 3: Gotta get that money. Jesus, man. DRIVER: Gary! Told you wouldn't shoot him. Watch him. MAN 4: Okay. TELEMARKETER: See if he's lying. MAN 3: I got it. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] TELEMARKETER: Lift this up in the bag. MAN 4: Hey. Hey. Smile for the camera. Smile for the camera. [♪♪♪] [SCREAMING] I didn't know. I didn't know that was gonna happen. Don't, please. He made us do it. Please don't hurt me. I'm not gonna hurt you. [DOOR OPENS] [GASPS] [♪♪♪] [LOCK CLICKS] [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] OLD MAN: Smile for the camera. I'm gonna kill you all. CICERO: They killed him. What do you mean they killed him? He was dead. At least for a little while anyway. The hospital pronounced him DO A. [♪♪♪] DOCTOR: Can you hear me? Bullet hit, ricocheted around his skull, came out his cheek. He's got a plate holding the back of his head together. I mean, this guy refused to die. And now, he must be going after everyone in that video. [♪♪♪] You said you wouldn't be late. Where have you been? I caught a case. You're supposed to take Tommy to his game. You made me late for my class. I'm sorry, it's a big deal, this case. I saw it on TV. I do not wanna hear about it. You want me to have full custody? I will take custody. COP: You know I don't want that. Then take him to his baseball game. Okay. All right. What's up, champ? What position they got you playing? Don't play much. Well, you got an arm like a cannon. I don't know why they wouldn't let you. I know. Maybe I should have a talk with that coach. Maybe pinch-hit or something. What do you say? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? CICERO: Hey, it's Cicero. There's been another shooting. This could be our guy. Yeah. Mallory wants you down at the scene. Okay, I'll be there in a little bit. 4045 Danson Road. Got it? I'll be there in an hour. [LINE DISCONNECTS] Hey, you know what, I'm not gonna make it in today. I'm taking my son to a baseball game. It's really important that I be there. Well, you know what? That's just too bad. All right, bye. Good grief. Can you imagine that? I already told them I had a ball game to go to today. [♪♪♪] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Incredible. You're a full two hours late. John, did you--? So, what do we got? What do you got? Guy did the world a favor on this one. Found out who shot our snuff films. Excuse me. So we got a telemarketer, a sex offender. What's next, a lawyer? Whole shebang just got a lot weirder. Witnesses placed a second shooter at the scene. After our suspect whacked Mr. Rogers, he had a little shootout in the hall. Maybe an armed neighbor. Uh-uh. No one recognized this dude. They exchanged gunfire then disappeared. Both of them. COP: The second shooter, any description? The word "beautiful" came up. Beautiful? Like a movie star. KILLER: He punked me. He's really that good? KILLER [OVER HEADSET]: Good's not even the right word. I mean, you know, the dude's completely artless. I mean, there's no sophistication to him whatsoever. But he's pure, you know? No fear, no hesitation. There's nothing. He as fast as you? No, he's faster. You'll get him. How can you be so sure, hey? Because you always do. KILLER: Baby. Yeah? Marry me. MAN: Hey, mister. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Goddamn it. Shit. [LAUGHING] Is that what I think it is? Oh, the tattoo? Yeah. Tattoo. Yeah, I was in the L.A. Crash Unit before I got transferred up here. Guns blazing, ass-kicking cops with porno mustaches? That Crash? Yeah, is it so hard for you to believe? Yeah. Can I get in there? That's where I met Marina, actually. She was my Cl. You married your snitch? Dude, that is wrong on so many levels. Well, she was in really bad shape. Got in rehab and we fell in love and there you go. Was she the only one in rehab? That's ancient history. You sure about that, Hoss? Listen, I got 10 days to retirement. Full benefits for me and my family, so why would I screw that up? It's all I got. COP: All right. Let's go. How long you been clean? Since my son was born. Good for you.

I didn't see any sense of three wasted lives. Three? Was that him? The boy? David? You shouldn't think... You did a dime. David's 8. Do the math. When you cut me off, I gave the baby up. Did you find a good family? I had an abortion. I'm sorry. [SOBBING] [♪♪♪] [BAB Y CRYING] All right. They know what you're doing. I saw it on TV. I hope you kill them all.

We'll sell the house by the lake, and we'll get a Craftsman in Pasadena. Fresh start. You're serious about this, aren't you? Yes. And what about your work? Oh, um... Well, what about it? Would you quit before this job? Absolutely. I will quit absolutely. Just like that? Just like that. Marina. Let me in for a second, I need to talk. I'm gonna stand here all day, so you may as well.

No. You said on your message to give you a call, so... Okay, here's the deal. Both of our victims were informants. Could be something there, right? COP: Yeah, could be. Nice work. CICERO: Okay, I need you to follow up on it. I gotta be in court, but I really think we're getting close. It's gotta have something to do with how they got set up. Did you hear about that stabbing in Henderson? Yeah, yeah, what about it? I got a hunch it might be our guy. It's not his m.o. Our guy's a shooter, not a stabber. Like I said, I got a hunch. Yeah, so did Quasimodo. Look where it got him. I'm gonna go ask a few questions. After you do the follow-up, right? Got it cleared with the Henderson IC. I'm headed up there now. I have to be in court all day. I am asking you to do this. It's my case. [LINE DISCONNECTS] [SIGHS] WOMAN [ON RADIO]: --bring us nothing but the same politics as usual. I have fought to keep government honest, save you money and to lower your taxes. Above all, I will be someone who listens to you. The choice is simple, vote Margie Pageant. MAN 1: In local news, a Henderson man is fighting for his life after being brutally attacked at a gentlemen's club. The man is suffering from stab wounds. Doctors describe his condition as critical. MAN 2 [OVER PHONE]: Hello? [♪♪♪] [PHONE BEEPS] DOCTOR: Sponge. NURSE: Sponge. MAN [OVER HEADSET]: We think he'll be heading back. Your position? Tehachapi. Try the hospital in Clark County. His third victim survived the hit. He'll be wanting to finish the job. Where are you? MAN: Good night. NURSE: Doctor. [GUNSHOTS AND MAN YELLING] MAN: What the hell is that? [PEOPLE SCREAMING] COP: Back in the room, back in the room. Police officer, get back. Police. NURSE: He went that way. COP: I'm a cop. Where'd he go? He went downstairs, officer. [SIGHS] [GUN CLATTERS] [DOOR SLAMS] [PHONE RINGING] BO Y [OVER PHONE]: How do you have my dad's phone? He asked me to call you. Are you the one who killed him? Yes. I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna kill you. Do what you need to do. But you better be sure, because it's a long, dark road you're headed down. [♪♪♪] [HORN HONKING] [HORN HONKING] [GROANING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [PHONE RINGING] I lost him. MAN [OVER HEADSET]: Client wants to pull the job. No. No way. You tell him to back off. I've got this under control. All right? You're running out of time. Where's the old man? Dead. Don't lie to me. I'll show you the damn grave. How long ago? I don't know. Three or four years. WOMAN: Hold still. [♪♪♪] Okay. MOTHER: How long you been out? Couple of days. And why are you here? Came here to kill the old man. Why? Because he set us up. What makes you think that? Gary went to him for advice on the bank job and he wanted full share. Gary wouldn't give it to him. So do you think the old man was capable of murdering his own son? Yeah. No. Mm-mm. Nope. He couldn't have. What makes you so sure? I just... I just know. Tell me. Say it. Mom. Because... he loved your brother too much. I'm sorry. And that's the truth and that's not your fault. It wasn't like I could pretend you were his. He was reminded of that every time he looked at you. You never stood a chance. Sorry that I couldn't... That I didn't protect you. The beatings and... [SOBBING] Gary was the only one who ever cared for me. Why'd he pull you in on that job? You were never a part of what they did. When his driver fell out, I volunteered. Why? He owed the wrong people a lot of money. And he needed me. If it wasn't the old man, then who set us up? [♪♪♪] [MAN SPEAKING INSISTINCTLY ON RADIO] EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]: Driven by his passions and desires. You will never truly be free unless you freely forgive. Hate is like a chain around your neck that leads you to places you don't wanna go. It'll lead you into darkness and desolation. You become a slave to that hatred, and it'll only lead to your own destruction. You must break free. WOMAN: Hey, cowboy. You okay, man? COP: Yeah. MAN 1: You laid eyes on him at least. Hey, well done. Thanks, man. I gotta call you back. MAN 2: Still in one piece. MAN 3: Good job. Good lead, cowboy. You almost got him. We got close. Yeah. It was a good hunch. Well, even Quasimodo has his day. And don't ever hang up on me again. Roger that. I hate to spoil your moment. Got something I wanna show you. I think we may have caught a break. You said "we" again. I did. CICERO: Our latest victim was a Cl too. COP: So all three are informants. CICERO: Mm-hm. All got records, armed robbery, rape, assault. But none did any serious time. They all snitched their way out of the joint over and over. What are the odds of that? Slim and none. I'm waiting on the informant logs now. COP: Who are these? Former accomplices of the victims. Let's split them up, check them out. I'll take these. EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]: And I know there's not a man, woman or child in this church today that has not sinned. But God did not bring you down on this Earth to be perfect. No. God wants you down here to be saved. [CROWD CHEERS ON RADIO] And when you're down with God, God is eternally down with you. [♪♪♪] EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]: When Jesus knew his time was near, when he knew he was gonna die, when he knew they would not take that cup from his lips, his thoughts were not upon his own. His thoughts were for those that he loved. WOMAN: Amen. EVANGELIST: That's right. His thoughts were for those that he loved, preparing them. EVANGELIST: Why is that? He used the example of his birth. That's right. Here it is. Jesus told them how a woman goes through pain and sorrow in the throes of childbirth. But then as soon as she has delivered, there is no more anguish. [CHEERING] After all the screaming, after all the pushing, after all the blood and the tears, there's only joy that a new child has been born. WOMAN 1: Hallelujah! And I'll tell you my-- WOMAN 2: Amen! Amen! [CROWD CHEERING] WOMAN 3: Amen. WOMAN 4: Amen. Amen. Amen. WOMAN 5: Hallelujah! Amen! MAN: Amen! Sing me a song! [CHEERING] [BAND PLAYING GOSPEL MUSIC] [SINGING "TROUBLE IN MY WAY"] [SINGING INSISTINCTLY] EVANGELIST: I was wondering when you were gonna show up. You've been the subject of many of my sermons these past few days. I heard. You heard. But did you listen? Everything okay, baby? Everything's just fine, honey. I was just catching up with an old acquaintance. You go on home now. Let's take a walk. [♪♪♪] Was that your son? Adopted. One of five. Wayward boys. Not unlike me or you at that age. You turned your life around. Doesn't change what you did. I wouldn't want it to. I know it sounds cold, but every good I've done hinged on the evil I did. Who set us up? I don't know. I never did find out how they knew about your safe house. When I got the call, "Easy money," they said. All I had to do was guard the door, be the lookout. I was in a dark place in my life. Numb to the chaos and-- Right here. But when they cut that boy's throat... Oh, Jesus, man. No. That boy they killed was my brother. I can't bring him back. And in my heart I'm sorry. I still took my cut, spent it on drugs and women. Ended up in prison. But it was there that I found my calling. To save and help boys like me. And like you. It was there that I gave my life to God. God can't save you from me. But maybe he could save you from yourself. I know there's good-- You don't know me. I know the devil got your heart twisted with vengeance and hate. The Lord is merciful. He sees in your soul. Fragile, ain't it? That moment, that sets us on our road to Damascus. Sermon's over. Can you at least find it in your heart to forgive me for what I did? I can't. That's all right. That's all right. Because I forgive you for what you're about to do. [SINGING "JOHN THE REVELATOR"] Lord, see into this man's heart. He's good inside. Oh, Lord, save this man's soul. I know you see his heart. [EVANGELIST CONTINUES SINGING] Release him from the bondage of hatred and vengeance, Lord. [CONTINUES SINGING] [EVANGELIST GRUNTS] Go back to your family. [♪♪♪] That's one hell of a peashooter you got there. How's the recoil? [♪♪♪] [RINGING] Yeah. CICERO: Where are you? Inyo County at the reservoir. They're here. Both of them. What? Did you call for backup? There's no time for that. Okay, don't do this. I'm sorry I keep stepping on your case. CICERO: I don't care about that. Want you to do me a favor. If I don't make it out of this, tell my son that his daddy went out like a man. I am on my way. Please, just wait for me. I'm just going with the flow. Damn. [FAX MACHINE BEEPS] Aren't you gonna reach for it? Come on. Sporting chance. I've got nothing against you. I've been trying to kill you for days and you've got nothing against me? I'm starting to think you don't take me very seriously, friend. DRIVER: What do you want from me? How about a little respect? Hey? A little professional courtesy from a peer. Some acknowledgment of my skills. You've got issues. Screw you. I win. [KILLER CHUCKLES] You think you're done? You can't put it together, can you? There must be one more. The one who hired me. He's still alive. I'm gonna kill you all. Drop the gun. Don't move. Slowly. Put the gun down. No. Put the goddamn gun down. No! This is my job! I finish my job. How you gonna finish this when you're dead? So you're the guy that hired me. You shouldn't have done that. I had to finish what I started. Why'd you hire me then? I didn't think I was up to it. After you missed him, I figured I should get involved before he came gunning for me. He didn't even know about you. I figured that out when he didn't finish me off at the hospital. His brother's girlfriend was my informant down in L.A. She told me about the job. Hired some more of my informants down there. They helped me take down their score. So, what now? Now? I ride off into the sunset. Hey. I forgot to pay you. You know, I don't get you. Why do you put yourself through all this shit for one lousy dollar? It's my price. Call it a hobby. You know what, keep it. I didn't earn it. Don't contact me again, I'm done. Yeah, me too. [LINE RINGING] MALLORY [OVER HEADSET]: Detective Cicero? CICERO: Yeah, I can't reach him. Okay, hopefully he'll turn up. We've got units en route, we'll see you shortly. CICERO: Wait a minute. You didn't flip him this case, did you? I didn't flip him the case. Is that what you thought? He asked for it, right? He begged for it. And I felt sorry for him, so I caved. Is there a reason why we're talking about this right now? No. No reason. Okay, I'll see you shortly. "Go with the flow," my ass. Marina? Hey, it's me, honey. Well, I got him, I closed the case. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. As a matter of fact, I feel perfect. Better than I ever have. MARINA: Yeah? Yeah, and I'm gonna get rid of the other stuff too. Don't you worry, I promise. I'll be home in a couple hours. Listen, you're not gonna believe this. I've been reading up on women, and I think I got you figured out. We're gonna be fine. Yeah, honey, it's over. I wanna start brand-new, honey. [GUNSHOT] [COUGHING] [COP GRUNTING] How? Metal plate. I can't feel anything. I created my own hell. And I'm the demon who crawled up out of it.

No, ugh, I'm not... I'm not a writer. I'm a fact checker, actually. It is a bit like being a detective, yes. Let's see if you are the Robert Beal that I'm looking for. Can-can you confirm where you were when you found out World War II was over? Oh, Poughkeepsie? All right. Right, thank you so much. Yes, the moment the war ended. Oh, Palm Beach? Okay. Lucky guy. Thank you very much. Bye. Bobby, hey, I got nothing, um, but there's two more Robert Beals, and one petty officer, third class. Wait. Oh, I'm gonna call you back. Sophie Hall. Can you confirm where you were when you found out World War II was over? Times Square? I'm in Times Square right now. I'm standing exactly where the photograph was taken. I really thought I would never find you. So, can you... Can I ask you to describe what you saw that day? The kiss, was it spontaneous or was it staged? It was. You're certain? So you're 100% positive? Petty Officer First Class Robert Beal, who was second sailor, said that the nurse was the bee's knees and... that the kiss was a completely spontaneous moment and a celebration of real love. - And he told you this himself? - Yes, he did. Cause it's not often that I request a personal audience with a fact checker. It's cause I need to know you're sure. I'm 100% positive. Great. I guess people wanna believe in true love, don't they? Speaking of which, I understand that you're headed off to Verona for a pre-honeymoon? Explain that to me. It's just a vacation before the wedding. It's our last chance to spend time alone before his restaurant... - Well, it's the city of love, isn't it? Yeah. Uh, but I... Good choice, and good work. Thank you. I was thinking. What if while I'm there, I write? But... you're such a good fact checker. Have a great trip. - Thank you. See you later. Who goes on a honeymoon without a wedding? You are so lucky. Well, Victor's restaurant opens in six weeks, so it's our last chance. Okay, do not let him pay attention to anything but you, okay? You throw his cell phone in the Adriatic. - But he has to meet suppliers. - Sophie... - It's fine. I promise. Okay. Wait, what? Hey, sweetheart, can I help you carry your magazine? Okay, no problem. Oh, my God. Hey, close your eyes. Close your eyes, close your eyes. Close your eyes, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Open your mouth. It's good? - Yeah. Yes? No? Yes? Yes? I reinvented the noodle, I'm telling you. Just try this one because this one's really good. It's the same thing, but different. Fatter. - Mmm. - More of, um, you know...? No? It's good, right? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah? You know, I mean, modestly speaking, I think I'm creating a masterpiece. I don't know. I-I mean, there's one... there's one that-that just came out perfect right now, - Victor? - ...which is... I think it's this one. I think it's still... - Victor, Victor... - Try it. Even though it's dry, try it. - Can I just say something? - What? We're leaving in 12 hours, and you haven't packed for Verona. At all. - Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right, yeah. - I get too carried away. - Do we clean this up? No, no. It's gonna be incredible. - I know. I'm so excited. Sophia! Sophia! Wherefore art thou, my sweet Sophia? I love this place. I love. Right? - It's amazing. - I have to show you the most beautiful... - You know what's even more amazing? - What? - I just got off the phone with Signor Morini, and he's arranged a private tour for us with each and every one of my suppliers. We're starting off with the oldest and most beautiful vineyard in all of Veneto. Yeah? Victor. Sophie, come on. No, you're not-you're no getting it. I mean, we're gonna go to the oldest, the most beautiful vineyard around. This is romantic. All right? We're gonna go there, we're gonna drink a little wine, we're gonna get a little tipsy, we're gonna come back and we're gonna... I mean, how was it? - I tried to talk to Bobby again. - How did it go? It didn't go, because I didn't talk to him. - Why? - Because I was scared. Really? It's time for me to stop checking facts and actually start writing. Yeah, yeah, i-it's your passion. You should do that. It's-it's the-the grape that I told you about that they use for the region, Soave? - Right, right, right. - You know. - Oh, yeah. You remember? Mmm. Mmm! - Do you like? - This is good. Wow. It's fresh flower and fruit. Do you feel it? Yeah? You feel it? It's so good. Smile. Sophie. Mmm! Mmm-hmm. We have to get tickets to the opera before they sell out. We need to see the Castelvecchio. We have to see Lake Garda and Juliet's house. - Yeah, of course. Yeah. Sophie, this is beautiful. This is incredible. The smell... Mmm! Sophie, this is amazing! This is great! I wish I was a little... a little mouse living in your cheese cave. Hey, that was Signor Morini on the phone. You know, he's inviting us to this incredible forest, that's just, like, 120 kilometers away. And they dig these exquisite truffles... - Wait. 120 kilometers? - Yeah, it's not like miles, Sophie. - No, I understand the difference, but I just, uh... I-I just don't understand why you wanna go 120 kilometers to see... to see a mushroom. It's not a mushroom, okay? It's a truffle. It's a... it's a tartufo. It's the thing that you put on top of pasta, you know? - A tartufo? - It's something else. It's co... Oh, come on, you've been having a good day, right? It-it was fine. But now, I just... To be honest, I don't really feel like going to see a mushroom. Okay, fine, I get it. I get it. It's fine. I get it. I mean, just don't call it a mushroom, okay? Uh, yeah, okay. You know what? Why don't you go see the truffle place and I'll go do my thing and sightsee? - Really? Yeah. Win-win. "My dear Juliet... " "Dear Juliet, the man that I love is not my husband. " Are you okay? Take this basket and... Come si dice? Um, dig in. Dig in? You are the translator from the employment office? - No... No, I mean... - I have been waiting two weeks. I'm sorry. Um, my name is Sophie. I just... I followed you, and... I saw that you put the letters into a basket, and... I just wondered why. Why? You are a writer? Yeah, I am. I am a writer. Come. I show you. They come from all over the world every day. But taking their letters? Is that... not like taking... pennies from a wishing well? How else can we give them answers? Oh, my God. So, you write all of them back. Yes. - You're all Juliet? - Her secretaries. Donatella has been married 51 years to the same man. She handles husband problems. Husbands are like wine. They-they take a long time to mature. Francesca is a nurse. She deals with illness and loss. And Maria... Why do you always sigh when you say my name? She has 12 children, 29 grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren. She writes whatever she likes. - And you? Isabella answers the ones you can barely read. Yeah, the lovers' quarrels, the breakups, the really tangled hearts. Someone has to do it. Oh, my mother. Would you like to stay for dinner, Sophie? Mamma, this is not an insult. I make a beautiful dish, big enough for, uh, for the whole town, and she says "no". I would love to, but I do... I have to go. This is the problem of the americani. Always running. - Please, mamma. I have to meet my fiancé. Fiancé? At least... take some dessert for you and your fiancé. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know, 120 kilometers each way and I'm still beating you? - Congratulations. - What? Yeah. What? I mean, how-how was Verona? How was it... without me? Empty? Half-empty? Completely empty? Half-empty. I met the secretaries of Juliet. - Juliet? Jul... like Juliet Capulet? - Yeah. There are these women that call themselves the secretaries of Juliet, and they write letters to people that write letters to Juliet. And then these secretaries, they work for the city of Verona, and, like, all these people, these brokenhearted women all over the world, come and they write letters and leave them on the wall. - What's in the bag? I... don't know. So, they post these letters. They post them on the wall in Juliet's courtyard, and then these secretaries come back with this basket and they retrieve the letters every day. And then they write back, as Juliet, to all the letters that have return addresses on them. Mmm-hmm. This is their job. I mean, it's so unbelievable. This is their passion. It's what they do every day. Mmm. Mmm. - They literally will work all day, every day. - Mmm! Oh, my God! - And they've been doing it for years. - Sophie. Wow. This is incredible! And they... This is incredible. This is incredible. Oh, my God. This is great. Try this, try this. You have to try this. Oh, my God. No... Give it a good bite. Come on. Your Victor is very passionate. Yes, yes, I know. But, um, he seems to think that he's Italian since we got here. And although imitation is, of course, the highest form of flattery, his imitations are not very good. Okay, that woman is amazing. I mean, she's incredible. She's incredible. I think I'm in love. Absolutely. - Oh, you're in love with her? - Yeah. Yeah. - Really? Okay. Just say "no". Just say "no", and I won't do it, really. I mean, I'm dying to do it, but I won't. Okay. What? Angelina's offered to teach me some secrets today. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay, right now and all day? Like, right now. That's crazy, right? I mean, now. That's amazing. I mean, she's making risotto all'amarone, right? Yeah? - Good risotto. - You see? You see, it's, like, 300 years old or something, her recipe. It's fantastic. Okay. That's great. But, um... So, no Lake Garda then today? Oh, yeah. Lake Garda... I mean, Lake Garda's been there for, like, 500,000 years, you know. And right now, Angelina's offered to help me. And, you know, I mean, I'm here, we're here, you know, we're having a good time. - You, Paul Newman, you want to work, you have to watch! You see? I mean, you see, I became Paul Newman. All right? Okay, what shall I do? I mean, my hands are tied. I don't know. I don't know. You could help us if you like. - Oh, yeah! Yeah. The letter thing, right? - Oh, why not? Yeah, yeah, you write the letters and I'll cook. And later we eat and... Win-win. How long have you and Victor been engaged? Almost a year. Wow. And may I ask why don't you wear an engagement ring? Yeah, see, that's... That's me. I insisted. He-he was so busy, you know, this whole restaurant and everything. And I... I guess I felt it unnecessary. Still, a girl should have a ring. "I didn't go to him, Juliet. "I didn't go to Lorenzo. "His eyes were so full of trust. "I promised I'd meet him to run away together "because my parents don't approve. "But instead, I left him waiting for me, below our tree, "waiting and wondering where I was. "I'm in Verona now. "I return to London in the morning, and I'm so afraid. "Please, Juliet, tell me what I should do. "My heart is breaking, and... I have no one else to turn to. "Love, Claire." And it's been there for all those years? I-I think... she came back to find her one true love. And they had 10 children and still make passionate love every night. Except he got bald and fat and she has to do all the work. - Francesca. - Francesca. And maybe... she stayed in London and married a duke and lived happily ever after, just like me. - But you married an accountant, not a duke. - Nobody's perfect. And I bet when she's making love to that duke... - Yeah? - ... she's imagining her first love, Lorenzo. Isabella, I... I have to write back. Then answer her. Good night, friends. Good night. Hey. Hey. - Sorry I'm late. - No, it's fine. No worries. How was your day? Good? - It was... - It was so good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Good. I'm glad. How was Angelina? Yeah, it was... it was good. I mean, she's amazing, you know. That woman is incredible. She's... very instinctive, you know. She cooks without recipes. I mean, she's incredible. She's invited me to cook again. - Really? Yeah. Yeah, I think I can learn a lot from her. But, um... Oh, no, no, you-you first, you first. Sorry, sorry. - Uh, no, just real quick. I just... - Mmm-hmm? I had the most amazing day. I got to answer a letter that was written 50 years ago. I know it might not get there, but it just feels so good to write. Yeah, I think you should spend more time with them. - Why? - Because... it's your passion, right? And also because it fits perfectly. Because I just got off the phone with Signor Morini, and he's invited me to this amazing wine auction that's happening in Livorno. - In Livorno? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, uh, it's super-exclusive. I mean, I don't know... I don't know if I can get a ticket, you know? I mean, I'll be off, like, a day or two, max. If you want, I'll try to get two tickets, but I'm not sure I can get two tickets. - Yeah. To a wine auction? In Livorno? Yeah, it sounds terrible. I know, I know... I'm sorry. I'm so... I feel terrible now. I feel terrible. I mean, it's... I miss you already, you know. I'll be back very soon. Okay? - Yeah. Be careful. Ciao. Listen to what this poor girl writes. "Juliet, is there anything worse in this world than a man?" Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you the secretaries of Juliet? - Yes, that's us. - Great. May I ask, which one of you wrote this letter to my grandmother, Claire Smith? I wrote that. And I can't believe that it found you. Yes. We Brits tend to stay in our family homes. Yeah. This is amazing. It's less than a week since I mailed it. It was a very... thoughtful letter. Now, what were you thinking? I was thinking that she deserved an answer. Yeah, 50 years ago, maybe. Not now. I-I'm sorry. I didn't know true love had an expiration date. True love? Are you... are you joking? Could you imagine what would've happened if she hadn't seen sense? Well, yeah, you wouldn't be here, and that would be an upside. What are you doing here anyway? What, are you some... lonely American girl who has to live vicariously through others? I'm not lonely. I'm engaged. My condolences to the groom. Excuse me! So that's it? You've come all the way from London to give me a lecture? No, I came because I couldn't let my grandmother come on her own. Claire is here? Why? I think even you might be able to work that one out. Oh, my God! That's awesome! She's come to find her Lorenzo! Awesome? And if Lorenzo doesn't want to see her, has forgotten her, is gravely ill or... dead, let's say, just for fun, then what? Thought so. I wanna meet her. I'd like to meet Claire. And I want to play for Manchester United, but I'm shit at football. You don't think that she wants to meet me? I honestly think she has no interest meeting a woman that can manage to jam "Oh, my God" and "awesome" into the same sentence. Gran, they're closing up. We should go now. Excuse me. Claire? Hi. Hi. My name is Sophie, and... I wrote you the letter. Letter? From Juliet? Goodness! Thank you. Thank you. But however did you find us? - Well, your grandson found me, actually. - You did? Right, well, the-the thing is, I thought we should... - Yeah, well, he's very sweet and... very charming, and he thought that you might like to meet me. Uncharacteristically thoughtful of you, dear. Yes, well, under the circumstances, it, uh, seems a little churlish not to meet the woman responsible for this voyage of lunacy. - Okay. Charlie doesn't approve, which makes this all the more fun. We were just going for a glass of wine. Would you like to join us? Absolutely not. - What? - Absolutely not. It's been a long day. It's... too long a day. - Okay, darling. Have a good sleep. - But I... Do you know somewhere we could go? I... actually have the perfect place. I can't believe you're really here. I was taking an art course in Tuscany, staying with a family outside Siena, and they had a son Lorenzo, and it was... love at first sight. He had such gentle blue eyes. And he told me I was very beautiful. And he gave me... this ring. We wanted to get married, but... I'd got exams back in England and my parents would never have agreed, and I got scared, and... I ran away. Now, what I really want is to... tell him that I'm so sorry I was such a coward. Of course, a card or letter is just too simple. So, you've come to find your Lorenzo? Yes, and I think I know where he is. Where? On the farm, just near Siena. Charlie's driving me down tomorrow. Only because I didn't want you to hitchhike. Well, he thinks it's a big mistake. It's because you don't have a romantic bone in your body. No, no. It's-it's because I am a realist. No. Because you are an Englishman! Cold as fish! Right. And-and who-who was it that wrote "Romeo and Juliet"? Williamo Shakespearelli, a great Italian. They're mad. They're mad. Sophie, my dear. Good night. Thank you so much. Thank you. Good night. Good night, everybody. - Good night. - Charlie, let's go. - Good night, ladies. - Good luck. - Bye. - Ciao. How wonderful would it be if she found her Romeo? Imagine if she did, 50 years later, all because you found that letter. Nobody would believe it if it... if it weren't true, you know? Wait! Uh, wait! - Oh, for... Here she comes. - Sorry. - May I come with you to find Lorenzo? - Come with us? What about this fiancé of yours? You're in the city of love and you want to come with us? Yes, I do. Because he's busy and I'm free. And, I mean, of course, if it's not an intrusion. - No, no, it's not an intrusion. I just... Listen, I do have one thing to tell you first. - It's not an intrusion. It... this is not entirely selfless. It started out as a simple reply to your letter, and... now I think it's... so amazing what you're doing, and I'd love to write about it if it's okay. - A journalist. Gran, a journalist trying to pry into our private lives. Charlie, come on. It's hardly state secrets, is it? I'm not a journalist. I would like to be some day, but... And you think gran's story is your ticket? I think it's a story worth telling. I'd love to have you with us. - Really? - Yes. Of course. We would. How much time did you actually spend with Lorenzo? Every second that we could. I'd go to meet him after class, to the farm where he was working, and we'd sit under the trees and we'd share some bread with tomatoes and olive oil. - It's so romantic. - Yeah. What's so romantic about eating in the dirt? Really? The dirt. Well, you see, he loved the earth. He loved... talking to me about the rain and the... springs of fresh water, and we'd walk for miles and miles. We'd lie in the dry grass. I can still remember the smell of his sweet, hot sweat and... Okay. Okay, gran. We get the picture. So you must feel like you're about to find your long-lost soul mate. Yes. Her soul mate was my grandfather. Let's not invalidate my entire existence. Okay, I'm sorry, I just... That's clearly not what I meant. Charlie's just like my husband. Both skeptics. My husband always insisted that love was nothing but hormones. But you see, underneath, he had such a warm, passionate heart. And Charlie's just the same. Tell me about the guy you're in love with. Victor. Yeah. - Well, Victor is a chef, an amazing chef. - Oh, wow. Yeah. He's opening his own restaurant in... in New York. And that's the reason we're here. We're-we're meeting suppliers all around. And he's actually... He's in Livorno at a wine auction as we speak. Oh, that sounds fun. For him. Yeah. Well, and do your parents like him? Yeah, my dad. My dad likes him. Um, my mom left us when I was nine. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I'm sorry about that. - That's okay. It was a really long time ago. Slowly, slowly. How do you want to go about this? Ring the doorbell. What if the wife answers and goes into a fit of jealous rage? Gran? Well, I'd be flattered. I'm more worried that he won't remember me. Right. Let's go home then, gran, before this all ends in tears. Come on. There's no one in. I'm gonna check the back. There's no... We made our best effort. There's no need to prolong the disappointment. Si, it's me, yeah. Good afternoon. I'm... Charlie Wyman. This is my... grandmother, Claire, and, uh, Sophie. - Ciao. I'm... Claire. Do you remember? Claire. It's not him. Are you sure? It's not his eyes. Le-let's... let's make sure. Do you... remember what you were doing in the summer of 1957? The summer of 1957, I will never forget, I met the most beautiful girl with long, blonde hair. Nana! We married that year. I curse that woman! - What? - Oh, no! - Right. I curse her eyes! I curse her teeth! I curse her mustache! But why are you asking? Why you bring up such a horrible memory? Well, that went well. Can't say we didn't try, nana. I'm sorry. Truly. Are you for real? If I actually knew what that question meant, I might attempt to answer it. He can't be the only Lorenzo Bartolini in Tuscany. Well, he's the only one around here, so... I haven't flown all the way here to pack it in now. Nana, what-what do you want to do? You want to start knocking on every door asking if Lorenzo's in? I mean... How many can there be? Seventy-four? Seventy-four Lorenzo Bartolinis and you want to go on a scavenger hunt? Impossible. We're going home in the morning. Come on, Charlie, will you calm down? Sophie, what do you think? Gran, what-what do you mean, what does she think? She doesn't think. This was her brilliant idea. It's over! Done! We found Nemo. The curtains have closed. - Sophie. - Listen, this is my job. I find things. And... through process of elimination and caveat emptor, which will require assembling a few more facts, we can narrow this down considerably. Did Ms. Awesome For Real just use caveat emptor? Oh, please, all right. I went to Brown. Double Major. Minor in Latin. This is madness. It's madness. Charlie, didn't you say you wanted to go and swim? We are working. Go away. - This is utter, complete mad... Work! I can't believe it. Ridiculous. He's a good-looking sort. Isn't he? All right. Are you... are you sure that Lorenzo would never have left this area? Oh, he loved this land. I'm quite certain. May I? Our Lorenzos. Are you sure that... that you have time for all this? Ciao, amore. Ciao. How are you? Umm, I'm good. How are you? You know what? I was just witnessing this most incredible, incredible Sauterne auction. It was just beautiful. It was incredible. How's it going? I'm good. I'm in Siena right now. What? In Siena? What-what are you doing in Siena? - I'm writing a story. We're kind of on a bit of an adventure, looking for somebody that she used to know 50 years ago. You know what, baby? You know what? I mean, this is-this isn't a good time because I'm in the middle of something, but, I mean, I'm glad you called because I was actually just gonna call you right now. You know, the opportunities here are really, really, really incredible, you know, and I think I'm gonna have to stay till Friday. Can I stay or should I skip it? I mean, I feel horrible, but... No, do it. Please. I'm-I'm-I'm gonna need until Friday, as well. Oh, great. So Friday, all right? Friday. Friday's good. Okay. Win-win. Ciao. Claire? I'm free. - Free for what? Free for what? - She's coming. - She's coming with us. - She's coming? Splendid. That's splendid! Fantastic! - Okay? - Okay. Good luck. It's not him. Oh, my God. No! Well, wouldn't this be nice, gran? Going from a boy who works the fields to a man who owns them. And you got to skip the messy bits. Life is the messy bits. Peccato it wasn't me. Yes. I would have never let you go. Believe me. What is it with you and Italian men? They fall at your feet. It's such a shame. I think I could've been happy here. "Happy"? Did your grandson just say "happy"? I said "could have been". Let's not get carried away. I have a reputation to uphold. Charlie, why don't you tell Sophie about your pro bono legal work? I can't imagine she'd have much interest, gran. - Try me. - You know the sort of thing, defending the defenseless, preserving human rights, helping refugees get asylum. You look surprised. - I'm so surprised. I just didn't have you pinned down as the save-humanity type at all. Oh, really? And what... type did you have me pinned down for exactly? Well, I was leaning towards elitist Oxford prig, but now that you mention it, self-satisfied do-gooder works as well. I guess you're a poor judge of character then. But she does deal with facts, Charlie. Okay. I'm off to bed. - Okay. - Good night, darling. - Good night. Sleep well. - May I walk you to your room? - Be nice to each other. She is awesome. I respect your usage of the word this one instance. Oh, I'm flattered. Thank you for approving. You're very welcome. Right. Well, should we hit the sack? Sorry. I guess I... Well, as much as I'd love to... sit here and drink the whole bottle of... Caparzo... No, go to bed. You should. Good night... Charlie. Right. Well, good night. - Good night. Forgive me. Where are my manners? You know, I've been wondering that since I met you. Yes, well, I... I don't know what it is, but... you seem to bring out the very worst in me. - Somehow it's my fault. - All of this is your fault. You wrote that blasted letter. Nonetheless, may I walk you to your room? You know, I'm not the... buttoned-up, buttock-clenching killjoy you try to make me out as. Right. And... I made you argue that true love is bollocks. Guilty. It's just that I'm... genuinely worried for her. I know she may seem carefree, but... her life hasn't been all that simple. Is it that unreasonable for me to worry? No, but... I have a really good feeling about this. You'll see. Let's hope you're right. Signora Claire. Signor Bartolini. We're not done yet. Of course we're not, darling. Hello. - Hello? - Hello. Hi. Is Claire with you? No? Oh, no, no. She's... turned in early, actually. Okay. Uh, I was gonna ask if you wanted dinner, but, uh... I just... I-I wanted to get started on my story. How's it coming? It's coming... okay. Am I in it? - You may be. Why? - Can I read just a little bit? - Are you kidding me? - Come on, just a little bit. Absolutely not. How am I to be sure that I'm being properly portrayed? No, no, you are. Believe me. You are. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means good night, Charlie. - Goood.... night. - Okay. Yeah. Good night. - What? Okay. - Is this one of those... situations where you're really saying the opposite of what you actually mean? No. Right. Good night then. Good night, Charlie. Good morning. Good morning. Gran wants to sleep in this morning. Is she okay? I mean, does she need anything? Oh, no need. She's tough as old boots, that one. Churchill in a dress. So, I, uh, thought I'd... see a bit of Siena since we're here. It's a good idea. I suppose you want to... keep on writing. I mean... Work, work, work. Admirable trait. Right, of course. Carry on, then. Charlie? Since we're here... I hate to compliment you, but, um, what you're doing for Claire is really... It's sweet, and I... I imagine that you'd rather be spending your holiday elsewhere, so... did you volunteer your services, or did your parents? I mean, where do they fit in? I'd like to think they're someplace nice. They were killed in a car accident when I was 10. I'm sorry. God, I'm sorry. Thank you, Sophie. I appreciate it. It was a difficult time. Gran lost her son. I lost my parents. I'm not a big believer in happy endings, I'm afraid. Anyway, gran stepped in. Took an angry, obnoxious, young boy under her wing and... and made me the simply unpleasant man I am today. So, isn't your fiancé starting to get just a tad lonely? You know, Victor's having the time of his life right now. And I doubt he even notices that I'm gone. What about you? Don't you have a girlfriend? - That is a very, very long story. Yeah? I'm not surprised. It's been about a year since I've seen Patricia. And you broke up with her? Are you insinuating that I'm more the type to be dumped rather than do the dumping? Maybe I am. Actually, I did break up with Patricia. This time. Okay, that's enough. All right. That's enough. - Sophie... - That's enough. - Your writing is really good. - Thank you. No. It's really, really, really good. Why are you so surprised? How come you've never shown your work to anyone? - I never feel like it's finished. - Why? Because I guess I'm a perfectionist. You know that's just another way of saying "I'm a chicken"? Listen. You've got nothing to be afraid of. You're not a fact checker. You're a writer. What was that for? - I'm not a chicken. And I'm not a gentleman. Do you think we should get back to Claire? Yeah. Many more Lorenzos. Okay. We should get back to Claire. I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Take him! Take him! I am Lorenzo Bartolini! I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Wow. I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Do you know what you are? You are the Montagues and the Capulets. Oh, you mean... Oh. Well, at least I'm not, um, Romeo. - That's the understatement of the century. - No, no, no, because you see, if I... if I found the love of my life, I wouldn't stand there like an idiot whispering in a garden. I-I would just... grab her from that blasted balcony and... and be done with. Do you believe in destiny? Do you? Yeah, I think so. I think... it's destiny that I'm here, right now. With Claire. Of course. Of course. With Claire. Well, this is the street. Well, there's 2. Here's number 2. This is what I feared the most. - Charlie, we don't even know if it's him. - I hope it's not. I hope it's not. Either way, we're finished. We're done. - No. Not here. W-when-when-when do we stop? Over the next hill? Or the next? Scour the whole country? No. No. It ends here. There are other Lorenzos not too far away from here. It's not the ending you want, is it? This isn't just... a clever story with a clever ending. - Stop it, Charlie. - It's our life. It's my gran's life. - It's not about... Charlie, it's not about a story. No, no, no, she's already lost the man once. How many more times would you have her lose him? You know what? I don't expect you to understand any of this because you don't know a thing about real loss. Yeah. You're wrong. Sophie's mother ran away from her when she was a little girl. It's different, gran. It's different. You're right. But... Sophie's mother chose to leave her. And you always knew your mum and dad loved you. Come in. Hi. Oh, dear. I just wanted to see if you were all right. I'm okay. Claire, I'm so sorry if I caused you... No. Every minute has been so special. Oh, darling. May I? One of the great joys in life is having one's hair brushed. Charlie, say you're sorry. In the eye, Charlie. With contrition. Sophie... - Thank you. - I'm afraid I... In the eye. Yes, gran, I'm not 12. Prove it. I'm sincerely sorry, Sophie. It won't happen again. Excellent. Sophie, I want to make a toast. - Thank you. I want to thank you for the wonderful thing you did for a complete stranger. I'll never forget it. Nor I. I had the most incredible... few days. I really have, and, um, I can't thank you enough for letting me tag along. Oh, I think you did more than tag along. Here is to all our loved ones, wherever they may be. May I join you? Please. I am sorry, Sophie. I used to lay out under the stars as a kid, in the summertime. "Doubt thou the stars are fire "Doubt that the sun doth move "Doubt truth be a liar "But never doubt I love." Do you think he's out there? Lorenzo? Yeah. He's somewhere. And am I wrong? To insist she quit? No, you know, you can't go on forever. At some point, you have to stop. Then why is it that I feel like a schoolboy on Sunday? It's nearly tomorrow and I don't want to go. Me, either. And I always liked school. - Morning. - Morning. Thank you. How'd you sleep? I slept fine. How about you? Ah, yes. Great. Thanks. Good morning. - Good morning. - How are you? - Good morning, my darling. It's a beautiful day. Oh, Sophie, would you mind, um, going in the front? Because I'd love to stretch my legs for a bit. Okay. Fantastic, darling. The stars were spectacular from my window. Look. That vineyard. That's our favorite wine. Let's turn in there and have... a goodbye toast. Okay. Charlie, stop! Nana, what is it? It's Lorenzo. Who? The boy? All right, nana. Let's get you in the shade, hm? Shall we? I am Lorenzo Bartolini. Sophie. I think this is... Do you know a Lorenzo Bartolini? - I asked him and... - I am Lorenzo Bartolini. - You are! Oh, my... Sophie, he... he's the grandson! - Can I help you? - Si. Yes. We are... we're looking for a Lorenzo Bartolini. I am Lorenzo Bartolini. - He's Lorenzo, too. - Do-do you have a father also named Lorenzo? Yes, he went out riding. But what can I do for you? I'm-I'm sorry. We're being... terribly rude. I'm... Charlie Wyman. - I'm Sophie. Lorenzo. Lorenzo. We have been on quite a journey for your father. You see, my grandmother, Claire, knows him. Charlie. Charlie, let's go! Let's go! All right. Nana, nana, nana, Lorenzo is here. He's out riding, but he's going to be back any minute. Well, then, let's go before he comes back. Nana, we've come all this way. Come on. - I've been ridiculous. I've been completely ridiculous. He knew me when I was... 15 years old, a girl. That girl's gone. Oh, my God. Claire? Yes. So many years. Yes, 50. If you allow me. I really don't know how to express myself. Well, I went for a ride this morning as an old man, and I came back as a teenager again. I'm so very happy you all meet... Claire and her grandson, Charlie, and their lovely friend, Sophie. My dear Claire, you have told me you lost your Jack. And you know I lost my Rosa. - Yeah. But destiny wanted us to meet again. Health to the Bartolini family. To the Bartolinis. I'm sorry I was late. No. When we are speaking about love, it's never too late. Well, bad luck, eh? All hope lost and... he rides in at the last moment on a white horse. No one will believe it. Promise me... Promise me you'll finish the story. I guess this is it. And I'm sorry it is. Yeah, me, too. Sophie, I, um... I-I never should've kissed you. I was, uh, completely out of bounds. Mmm. You're engaged... and... It's time to go. Goodbye, Charlie. I'll miss you. Hi. It is time to, um... I must get back to Victor. Sorry. Oh... oh, yes. Of course. So, where's Charlie? AND THEN WHEN FANG BARKS, IT WILL DESTROY THEM. THAT'S BRILLIANT, MAX! HOW DO WE PUT THE BOMB IN THE SHAFT? "HOW DO WE PUT THE BOMB IN THE SHAFT," YES. WELL, THAT'S THE PART OF THE PLAN I HAVEN'T WORKED OUT YET. ( shrieks, speaks German ) - ( shrieks ) - THAT'S IT! RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT? THAT'S HOW WE DO IT-- IF YOU CAN IMITATE HIS VOICE, YOU CAN COMMAND FANG TO DROP THE BOMB DOWN THE SHAFT. BUT HOW CAN I IMITATE A PARROT? NO, MAX, YOU IMITATE THE KAOS MAN'S VOICE. - LIKE THE PARROT'S DOING. - BUT HE SPEAKS GERMAN, - I DON'T KNOW ANY GERMAN. - I DO. YOU DO? WELL, HOW DO YOU SAY "PICK UP THE BOMB"? - NIMM DIE BOMBE! - NIMM DIE BOMBE! FANG, NIMM DIE BOMBE! - NIMM DIE BOMBE! - ( knocking ) Chief: MAX, 99, ARE YOU IN THERE? IT'S THE CHIEF. HE'S HERE. HURRY! HOW DO YOU SAY "DROP THE BOMB DOWN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT"? LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT. LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT. FANG, LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT. ( whirring ) - HOW DO YOU SAY "BARK"? - BELL! FANG, BELL! FANG, "HITEN THE DIRTEN." GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT. - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, WE'RE OKAY, CHIEF. - FANG SAVED US. - FANG, KOMMEN SIE HER AND SITTEN DOWNEN! ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, MAX? YES, CHIEF, AND FANG DOESN'T UNDERSTAND GERMAN ANYMORE. THE EXPLOSION MUST'VE RELEASED HIS MIND. - BETTER TEST HIM, MAX. - RIGHT, 99. FANG, LIE DOWN, FANG. LIE DOWN. BEG, FANG. BEG! BEG, FANG. HOW ABOUT THAT, CHIEF? JUST AS GOOD AS NEW. THERE YOU GO. ( groans ) SORRY ABOUT THIS, CHIEF. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MAX. YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ME FOR BREAKING ORDERS. I UNDERSTAND. MAX, WHAT'S FANG'S DUCK DOING HERE? THAT'S NOT FANG'S DUCK, MAX. THAT'S YOUR SPECIAL GUN. WHEN I REALIZED I'D TAKEN IT FROM YOUR OFFICE, I PUT IT IN MY POCKET. I MUST HAVE DROPPED IT. - SOMEONE BETTER TELL FANG! - ( gunshots ) NOW YOU KNOW WHY I PUT HIM ON A DESK JOB. DON'T WORRY, CHIEF. I'LL HAVE HIM REPORT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING FOR TARGET PRACTICE. ( theme music playing ) Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze... of past and future ages... during the first experiments on Americas greatest and most secret project- the Time Tunnel. Tony ewman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new, fantastic adventure... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time. This then, Your Majesty, is the great Magna Carta... limiting the powers of the king... and establishing the rights of man. It needs only your signature... to make it the law of the land. You- the Earl of Huntington- you call yourself a loyal subject? This is treason. Treason! Ill hang you and all the barons who follow your flag. Seize the traitor. Seize him! Do not let him escape. Surrender. The Time Tunnel. Surrender now! Bring them before the king. Who is this man? Obviously a servant of Huntington. Your Majesty, even traitors can serve a purpose. Spare them if they tell us what we must know. No one will say King john is without mercy. Huntington... I will spare your life and the life of your servant here- Your Majesty, Im not this manss servant. As for this- I will not discuss these treasonable demands with you... or your fellow barons. Not treasonable, but a respectful request from the Council of Barons. All we want is a charter guaranteeing the rights... - of all our free men. - just a charter. A great charter- or as you call it, a Magna Carta- stripping your king of all his powers. If I dont return to the Council of Barons... within 48 hours, they will call their armies... - into the field. - Rebellion? Yes, Your Majesty. Youll hang... and Ill put the heads of all the others on public display. Take them to the dungeon. And if they dont tell you where the barons are meeting... make them beg for death. Chain them to the walls. Go tell the captain of the guards to search the castle. More of Huntingtons men may have got in. Im sorry you became involved in my quarrel with the king... but well die for a good cause. Just who are you? That doesnt matter. But as for the Magna Carta, King john will sign it. - Im sure of it. - Itss a pity wellll never live to see it. Hot enough to sear the flesh? Heat the other iron. Where is the Council of Barons meeting? Whos going to talk first? The servant? Or the master? He knows nothing. Begin with me. No! - Ill tell you where the barons are meeting. - Dontt be a fool! If you do know, keep quiet. Theyll kill us immediately. Perhaps your servant prefers mercy. Well? Tell me, but if you lie- Therell be a hundred soldiers out there in less than a minute... and well be dead in less than five. Now. Try for a transfer. If only that door holds for another second or two, well have enough power, but- The fix isnt firm. All we have is the year and the month- June, 1215 A.D. Ray- the homing post. If we could get it to Doug and Tony... we could bring them right back into the Tunnel. But Ann, weve tried that before. Well, yes, sir, but never in this time period. And weve improved its capabilities. All right. All right, lets try it. If we can get one of these bars out... we might be able to squeeze through. It would take more than the strength of the three of us. This is malleable iron, not hardened steel. Weve got a chance, Tony. Here. What are you doing? These coals will soften that metal. Itll never work! Get ready to fight. - Thats it. - Itss working. Keep going. Its out. Come on. Go on, Tony. You first. Hurry! Well be safe in the forest. Go ahead. Ill take care of him. Go! They caught him before he could get away. You know, Tony, if it wasnt for him... we would have had it by now. - Who is he? - Someone called the Earl of Huntington. The Tunnel transferred us into King johns time. King john? Hes the one who was forced to sign the Magna Carta. Right, although Im afraid a lot of bloodss... gonna be spilled before he signs it. Now, Huntingtons the leader of the barons... who wantjohn to grant the charter. Doug, we wouldnt stand a chance if we tried to get back into the castle to help him. If only we could find the other barons. You know, according to history... John met the barons at Runnymede. I wonder if thats where they could be gathered now. We could try to find them. At least we could warn them about what happened to Huntington. Come on. Reading: 114.36 over 11. 114.36 over 11. General, were set. All Doug and Tony have to do is touch that post... in order for us to retrieve them. All right. Activate. It should reach its target. How soon can we get an image? As soon as we rebuild power. Get the window bars repaired. - Get the guards mounted and make haste after them. - Aye! - I heard something. - just a bird. Aye-A bird. A large green bird... ready to catch a couple of worms. - Out of the frying pan. - What was that? - Speak up, man. - Were strangers. Were just passing through. Aye. Well, you must be a couple of Frenchmen. Why, no Englishman would be buried in such clothes. Little worm. If you defeat me,youll go free- aye- but if you lose, were gonna skin you both alive. Eh! Hah! Youre just a greenhorn. Oh! Right. Will you yield, or shall I squash you? Huh? Ah, you did well, and it took some doing to beat you. Aye, Littlejohn. I think hed make a welcome addition... - to Robin Hoods band. - Robin Hood? Yes, were his followers. Imm Friar Tuck. Youre already met Littlejohn. You know, I always thought that Robin Hood was a legend. Well, a living legend. Why, everyone in England tells of the deeds... of the Earl of Huntington when he was an outlaw. Huntingtons being held prisoner in King johnss castle. Prisoner? Why, he went to them in peace. Oh, well storm the castle and carvejohnss heart out. With a handful of men, we wouldnt stand a chance. Lets get back to our camp and put our heads together. Are you with us? I guess we owe it to him. - Were with you. - Hmm. Not in those clothes. Well get some proper green for you both. Ill ride out to the castle and tell the guard at the gate... of an important message from the king. Now then. The minute the gate opens... - well all charge out of the forest. - No. No, no, no, no. The archers on the walls would cut us down... before wed reach the courtyard. No. Weve got to steal into the castle somehow- two or three of us- then well seize King john... and hold him as a hostage to free Robin. - Too bold a plan. - Thats exactly why it may work. - Whats that? - Scatter! Come on. No. No. - Hes badly hurt. - Get on without me. Lean on me. Come on. Doug. A staff,quick.! Quick, after them. You two that way. You with me. Well done, lads. - Now for this. - No! No, itll only cause more bleeding. Where can we go? He needs attention badly. Kirkley Hall. He can be treated there. Its a retreat in the forest, run by the Baroness Elmont. She used to give us refuge in our outlaw days. Come on, old friend. Lean on me. Come on. Come on. What made Huntington think I would agree... to even one clause of his precious Magna Carta? Your Majesty. We trapped a group of Huntingtons followers. - Did you slaughter them? - No, Your Majesty... but every road and pass out of the forest is guarded. One of them is badly wounded. They wont escape, Your Majesty. If they do, Engelard, itll be your head. - But your Majesty, Ill do everything I- - Oh, stop mumbling. Go make Huntington talk. He says these men wont escape... but as long as any of Huntingtons band remains alive... our plan to crush these barons is in danger. Engelard said one of them was badly wounded. I know these former outlaws. Theyre sentimental fools. Rather than desert a wounded comrade... theyll jeopardize their own safety to help him. Your Majesty, a purse of gold can succeed... where Engelards soldiers have failed. Bribery is the best weapon. Use it. Shall I bleed you a little more? - Engelard- - Speak up. When are you going to tell me where the barons are meeting? When the Magna Carta is signed... you will be among the first to be tried by its terms. For serving my king? Our laws will make each man responsible for his own actions. You wont live to see that day. Tony and Doug must have gotten out somehow. Wheres the homing post? Try to locate Tony and Doug. It may be possible to transfer the homing post to their new location. - Friar Tuck. - Baroness, sanctuary. Littlejohns been wounded. - Will you give us shelter? - Of course. Theres nothing I wouldntt do for the followers of the Earl of Huntington. Put him there. - How did it happen? - We had a fight with the kings men. I assumed as much. But Huntington has sworn allegiance to King john. Well, thats all changed. Hes being held a prisoner at King johnss castle. I must send a messenger to the village- to fetch someone with skill to cure it. Im sorry. No one else must know werre here. But Littlejohn might die. I must send someone- someone who can help him. I can take care of him. - Sterilize this. - St - Sterilize? Yes. Put the blade in the fire and heat it... until its red hot. Do you have any medicines that might relieve the fever? I have some herbs. But I still think- - Will you show me where they are, please? - All right. The best thing for a fever is bleeding with leeches. No. Hes lost too much blood already. Sulfur. Some sort of phosphorus. This root powder is used to relieve pain. - Tastes like snake root. - Is there anything there you can use? Well, this is an alkaloid tranquilizer- Reserpine. Will you mix this with water, please? You know, some of these so-called remedies... if mixed in the right proportions... could be highly explosive. I want you to drink this. Itll help your pain. Thats enough. Will you just get this bastard arrow out of me, man? Im sick enough as it is, without drinking that poison. - Ready? - Aye. The knife. Tell me. What is the trouble between Huntington and the king? It has to do with the Great Charter. If King john knew better, hed sign it without a fight. Hes going to have to anyway. Huntington gave the king an ultimatum. Either he signs a charter guaranteeing that he rules... according to laws fair to everyone... or hes faced with rebellion. Where did you learn the art of curing, Douglas? Just battlefield first aid, Tuck. I think Littlejohn will be all right now. - What of Robin Hood? - Weve got to find a way to rescue him. Inform the barons of what has happened. Ill send my messenger to them. Where are they meeting? - Oh, the Council is- - No, Tuck. What you said before still goes. If the barons decide to march on the castle, Robin Hoods as good as dead. I should have a voice in this matter too. If I am placing Kirkley Hall in jeopardy... the least you can do is consider my opinion. - We are extremely grateful. - Save your thank-yous. If you wish to risk your lives entering the castle, all right. But suppose you fail. Let me send my messenger to the barons. Where did you say theyre meeting? Well, theres risk either way. More risk to Robin Hood if they decide to march against King john. Yeah. The only thing thats keeping Robin alive... is thatjohn doesnt know the council is meeting at Runnymede.

Well be German, Woman grandson of Peter ... that would complete the transformation St. Petersburg ... naval fortress the glittering capital ... we know today. Her name, Catherine the Great. Catherine took power, in 1762 ... after deposing her husband ... who had been Emperor for only six months. She knew how to master it easily. With the throne assured ... 3 487 00:30:42,106 -- 00:30:45,310 Catherine followed the footprints Peter the Great ... and transformed Russia in world power. As foreign and European ... she practically completed the process of Europeanization ... Peter had started at the beginning of the century. Actually Catherine considered herself ... legitimate heir of Peter. In the eighteenth century, to be a successful monarch ... it was necessary to expand the territory. And that Catherine did very well. Catherine annexed about 500 000 hectares of land in the country ... which generated vast wealth and expanded the empire ... for size Russia today. It was also necessary to control several reforms. And that's what she did. As a priority, Catherine used his immense wealth ... to modernize the city. She ombreou with great monarchs ... offering the immense humble people ... several hospitals, sanitary measures ... basic services and schools. During her reign, Catherine established rules of architecture ... for the construction of new cities And she built 216 new cities ... with planning where would the squares ... types of facade, the materials ... be used in the construction. But more beautiful design Catherine and prestigious ... was the renewal of the royal residence. The most extravagant monument to luxury and refinement ... the Winter Palace. This palace had three floors extending over 200m. On the outside, was decorated 200 columns with exquisite ... and over 150 statues marble. Inside, there were more than 500 rooms ... almost fourfold the White House. In the course of his reign, Catherine promoted ... a burst constructions as never seen before. With all this activity, the Tsarina turned ... Petersburg in an ostensive and proudly showcase ... culture, wealth and power the Russian Empire. She wrote to a correspondent ... "I can not stop building. It's like a disease, almost like alcoholism. " But construction was not the only defect in the czarina. Behind the doors the Winter Palace ... Catherine exercised another form of patronage ... caring for their numerous and generally young lovers. 534 00:33:29,607 -- 00:33:31,074 She worked hard. At night, wanted a male company. She had several lovers, whom he treated well and generously. She gave them lands and servants. But the luxuries of Catherine and its full power ... about to give humans like this ... symbolized the gulf between ... Russian worker elite. Although he was kind to his subjects, reforms of Catherine ... not quite contemplate the people. At the end of his reign in 1796 ... Russia was a superpower. The brightness of the country, however, brought glory and attracted enemies. In 1812, the most ambitious General of Europe ... undertook a march of conquest ... as had never been seen since the Roman Empire. And he chose Russia as the next victim. When he died in 1796, Catherine had added ... 500 000 hectares lands of the empire. Over 40 million people were now considered Russian. When his grandson, Alexander I, ascended the throne in 1801 ... Russia was important number the global chessboard. And that made ? it a coveted trophy ... for the most fearsome general Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1812, Tsar Alexander face a problem ... Russia has not seen since the Mongol invasion, six centuries before. Napoleon was a threat Handsome Russia. He had almost all of Europe ... under control. Napoleon invaded Russia with an army unprecedented ... Over 500,000 soldiers. The Russians, seeing they could not face them ... adopted the tactic of strategic retreat. burned all what was left behind ... to leave the intruders without food. when we finally arrived in Moscow ... Napoleon realized it had underestimated ... the will of steel the Russian people. Napoleon probably thought to invade Russia and take the capital, Alexandre accept negotiate with him. But no. He simply ignored, until the bitter cold ... Napoleon did understand there was nothing to gain ... staying in Moscow. And then he retreated. Forced to march by the same ... freezing and desolate landscape I already knew ... Unbeatable army of Napoleon was reduced to 10% of survivors. Unbeatable army of Napoleon was reduced to 10% of survivors. In 1883, the successor of Alexander commissioned a monument ... and installed in the center of the square Main St. Petersburg ... a symbol the Russian iron will. It was called the Alexander Column. The Alexander Column is on a granite base ... red granite. It is a monolith, a whole piece. Again, one czar forced subjects ... literally move mountains ... to erect a monument in honor of the empire. A battalion of workers ... extracted the base of the column ... one piece, and took her to St. Petersburg. It was a process that required three years and thousands of workers. In Petersburg, the engineers faced the daunting task ... lifting the monolith 700 tonnes and 25m high. They used a large rope that was bound to the column. Around, hoists had operated by several people. At a signal, all passed a system of pulleys ... so that the column was raised gradually ... is put in place prepared the base. Today, the column still think the huge pedestal. Its total height is 48m. Was perfectly designed and constructed. The fall of Napoleon eliminated the threats ... the status of Russia the largest continental empire. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the country average nearly 10,000 km ... Baltic Sea to the Pacific coast ... going to Alaska. A sixth covered of the entire planet Earth ... including 15 time zones. And with the new tsar, continue to grow. As Nicholas II knew Asia, because of their previous trips ... his first trips were for Asian nations ... He had a real conviction ... that the future of Russia was in the Pacific. But with a territory that was lost in the horizon ... the empire was in a danger being crushed by own weight. And the engineers find A solution ... such as Russia itself. Build the railway Trans-Siberian. Those who promoted the construction ... than would be the time the railroad longest in the world in 1890 ... had goals in mind ... economic and political. They wanted to open the Far East to Russian exports. At the same time, they wanted to establish Russian power in the east. The May 31, 1891 ... was seated the first rail a railroad ... that transpose the distance of 9.200km ... equivalent to the cross United States twice. equivalent to the cross United States twice. Imagine what it was built the railroad ... sincerely, leaves me impressed. The building has been divided into stages ... requiring thousands of workers, engineers, soldiers ... and even imprisoned, to perform the task. In a typical stretch the railroad through ... the Siberian steppes ... an initial team cleaned the ground ... and cut trees to make way for the railroad. After it was necessary to much work ... for excavation of sites where the tracks pass. When the earth was leveled ... rails were brought and settlers. The transport of supplies to the icy plains was a problem ... because the railroad did not exist. The rails were placed gradually ... and the workers wore the stretch ready to transport the steel from the west ... and continue to build, step by step. This process was repeated week after week, month after month ... during all the years in the late imperial period. The strenuous work was an ordeal for the Russians. It was very hard work, very hard. Imagine that desolate vastness ... which was transformed Rustic campgrounds ... with workers living in tents ... or, in some cases, shelters, working for months ... in stretches of railroad-supplied relatively limited ... in winter, they were subjected to a extremely low temperature ... in summer, the terrible heat that climate. In 1904, the railroad was ready. Russia had a communication line to the east ... and was free to try another achievement in Asia. The problem, of course, does that put Russia ... in conflict with Japan .. who had political objectives cheap and very similar. This conflict of objectives led a war between Russia and Japan In 1905, Russia went to war ... and suffered humiliating defeat the Japanese. That defeat fueled the flames ... growing resentment against the Tsar. In 1914, Tsar plunged the country in another war. A war that decimated much of the population. The First World War. After centuries building the largest empire of the world at your expense ... the people felt that reached to the breaking point. The March 15, 1917, the revolt broke out. Tsar Nicholas II was deposed. The nearly 500 years of absolute power Czars collapsed to the ground. The main factor in the disintegration the Russian Empire ... in 1917 ... was the collapse of the Tsarist regime. He was the emperor I served as the foundation ... to keep the empire together. The tsars had used the power to build beautiful cathedrals ... a city on swamps ... a railroad crossing a continent ... and sumptuous palaces that even today have no rivals. The history of the Russian Empire can be seen as a great achievement. At the same time, this achievement has taken its toll. In many respects, the empire was built at the expense of the Russian people. In 1917 the achievements of the empire ... be rewritten with a new system ... determined to improve the lives the humblest peasant. The powerful empire grew and subjects consumed increasingly ... to build the amusement palace of the rich ... and a hell for the rest. In the early twentieth century, the exploited poor and illiterate ... Russia got tired. Devastated by the Great War, incited by radical ... the people rose to demolish Russia for which they had fought so ... in a fierce revolution would replace ... a great empire on the other.

It probably had nothing to do with you taking his job. Stay strong. Moment of silence in his honor. I shouldn't have said anything aboutJack Air. I feel so bad. Thesis? Are you talking during a moment of silence? - L-I'm sorry, sir. I just... - Ooh, look at the cold stones on this kid. Every man in this room could drop dead, and he wouldn't bat an eyelash. And he's right. We don't have time for feelings. This is a business, not a homosexual coming-of-age story. Your presentation is in two days. It better boil my noodle. Oh, because of Marty, we all have to take a physical. If you fail the physical, you can't head a division. Could you remove your shirt, please? I'd be more comfortable if we just went over the shirt. - I'm a second base type of gal. - Remove your shirt. See, I did this challenge last night, and there was this girl.

I just became head of a division! I promise you, I'm super healthy. I run every day. I eat lots of fruit and grains. - Yeah, you're just too much of a risk. - No, please, I'm begging you. It was a bar bet. This is not me. Well, you are 30 years younger than anyone else here. - I could retest you tomorrow. - Great idea! Let's do that. But in the meantime, keep a food journal and wear this pedometer. That way I can prove to the company you're healthy. 10,000 steps minimum. Hey, look at me! Look! I'm already at seven! [Sighs] What's wrong, Thesis? You look like someone stole your sucker. No. I was just partying last night, and it screwed up my physical. Oh, it's hard for you, Sam. Most of us here have already had our adventures and are settled down. But you're still having your adventures. And you should be. I know, but I also take my job very seriously. You're only young once, Sam. Live life, drink wine, eat breakfast off Steve McQueen's ass... while Ali MacGraw pours wax on herself in the corner. I don't know who they are, but I'm pretty sure I can't do all that and still have this job. Well, you can't be 24 again either. Hey, you're good at math. Wanna see how many times 24 goes into 48? - Twice. - *[Man Singing Pop] [Sully] All right. Here's the deal, Lizzy.

Are you sure she's the right kind of girl for you? I've never dated anyone like her. Maybe that's why it works. But not tonight. No matter what happens, just please let me get my work done. Got it. Keep you out of trouble. Ah, cool. - Hi. - Hey. Sammy, no. - [Continues] - This is gonna be trouble. Where am I? What the hell happened? You won the tequila challenge. - Welcome to Cabo. - [Donkey Brays] [Groans] *[Man Singing In Spanish] No, seriously, where are we? We're in Mexico. You wanna make out? - You know it. - [Moaning] Wait, wait, wait. What happened last night? You took the Saco Borosso Challenge. *[Man Singing Punk] - Whoa! - *[Continues] - Oh! - *[Continues] [Squealing] Oh, yeah. I was insane. Yes, you were. [Moans] Mmm! Oh, my God! My low-cost airline!

You should do it. We could travel all over the world together... have an awesome time makin' lots of money. - That sounds like a great idea. - Let's make this happen. Oh, that's big. Let's talk about it later tonight, okay? Sam. I had fun last night. Me too. *[Singing In Spanish Continues] - [Braying] - Come on! No, no, no, no, no! - Stupid ass! - [Brays] - [Phone Rings] - Darcy? - Hi, Sam. - Hey, can you cancel all my meetings? I'll have to do some serious juggling. At 11:00 a.m. You've got the guy installing Outlook Express on your computer... and at 6:00 p.m. You're buying cookies from Harry Manetti's daughter. - Is that all I have? - That and the nurse from the insurance company. - He's here for your re-exam. - Fudgeknocker! My pedometer! I need 10,000 steps. Can you stall him until I get there? I didn't go to acting school. I went to M.I.T. But my particle theory club did do a production of Man of La Mancha. The review gave it 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd stars. I'm sorry, sir. You'll have to shut off your cell phone. It disrupts the plane's communication system. Actually, I work for the airline, and that's not true. They're on two completely different frequencies, so it's fine. Thanks. I'm sorry. F.A.A. Rules. No cell phones after takeoff. Shut it off. - Just two more... - Shut it. - Sir, please take your seat. - I'm sorry. This is a health issue. Can't sit still for long periods of time. Deep vein thrombosis. - You understand. - Park it. Okay. [Rattling] *[Man Singing Rock] [Bell Dinging] [Pedometer Rattling Continues] *[Ends] Sir, what you're doing is a federal offense. What?

Great! I met this girl, and she's really amazing. I think I might be making some life changes. You knocked her up. I told people you weren't gay. - What? - You ready for your big presentation? I will be. I'm gonna spend the day hammering out the details. Didn't you get the e-mail on Outlook Express? - No. They haven't installed it yet. - Let's go, Thesis! - Presentation time, and you're up. - Wh-What? Moved it up a day. Don't you read your Outlook Express? - L... - You better be good. This low-cost airline is the only thing keeping me from sucking on a gas nipple. Look, Sam. I know what it's like to finally lose your virginity. But you have to read your Outlook Express. L... Wha... All right, Thesis. Blow my pants off. Well, uh, the thing is my new e-mail software never got installed and... Thesis! Don't make me go dig up Marty. No, sir, no! Of course not. Uh... Are you wearing a brassiere, boy? What? D... No! No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No. This, um, is just drawn on. See, l-I lost this challenge, and this was one of the consequences. You're not one of those trans-operatives, are you? Like my son's friend Seth-Beth. No, I'm all man. A man who likes to have fun, you know... with drinking games and tequila challenges... and Magic Marker bras. What does this have to do with our airline? I'll tell you what. We're gonna target a new key demo. A demo that likes drinking and the beach... and partying, y'all! - Huh? Yeah.! - Sam, what are you doing? A party-loving, beach-hugging demo, like me. And you know what we hate? Flying. It sucks. But not if it were a party. So instead of nonstop... we're gonna offer nonstop partying on Sky Party Air! Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna be the new low-cost carrier for every party destination in North America. Cabo, South Padre Island, Las Vegas! Why should the party start when you land? Come on, people! Life's for living. Let's do this for Marty! Let's rock this bitch on Sky Party Air, y'all! Oh, ooh! Great Agamemnon's ghost! He's done it again. You tapped the youth market. I love it. - High five? - Nope. - Or not. - No, sir. All right. *[Man Singing Pop] - Hey. - Hey, Jenna! Mmm. So did you think about the job thing? Our first assignment would be Dave Buster's in San Diego. We're making a human burrito with me inside. If you're up for it, you can be the queso. Oh, that sounds so fun. I'd love to be the queso. But I can't. What? Why not? Uh, I really like my job. I actually got to name an airline today. Well, so what do we do? I have to leave for Dave Buster's in the morning. I don't know. Uh, you wanna work for an airline? My life is the road, Sammy, not the sky. - What? - [Giggling] I don't know. I've been drunk sinceJanuary. [Laughing] - You're really nuts, huh? - You have no idea. [Moaning] *[Singing Continues] Mmm! Mmm! You again?

Oh yes! The wall's a bit too thin that I can hear voices from next door. But this is the first time I got an apartment with a bathtub, so there's nothing much to complain about. - So it comes with a bathtub? - Yes. So you've finally made it this far. It's all thanks to the Chief Editor. Now you're at the peak of your life. Huh? You mean having a bathtub? Yup, having an apartment with a bathtub is the peak of your life. That's just sad... Am I really that low? Isn't this just like the time with the Romanian Pub? I agree it's quite similar. Don't you have anything new? It is getting conservative these days. It's hard to get interesting stories. Keep working, informer. Oh yea. An IT company is working with Singapore affiliated Chinese mafia to control a Chinese company from the back. So you've got something good after all. They specialize in counterfeit credit cards, pretty big business. At the time... I am doing my best but Mom you should hang in there too. Isn't Kazuyuki taking the exam this year? Cut it out. What are you getting out of this? When you get arrested, your life will be all messed up. Hmm? It's not here. Welcome back. Everybody, here you go! The top news today is... Good night. "Sugiura" Hello? Cut it out. What are you getting out of this? It's very... fun... When you get arrested, your life will be all messed up. I want to screw you... Hello? Yuta? Yes, the same guy. I am so scared... Yea, it's just disgusting. Yea, please come over. I was so scared... Isn't this becoming more frequent? At first it's just silent calls. But now it's becoming threatening. He said he wants to screw me over... I can't take it anymore... Don't worry! I am going to be with you. But it's already been three weeks this guy's a freak. I think you should contact the police. The police... The thing is, I was asked out for a date by my coworker recently. Really? Of course I turned him down. I suspected him because he seemed a bit difficult... But the voice is completely different so it's probably not him. He's definitely fishy. Voices can be changed easily on the phone. Just watch for him. Anyway, let's change the phone number. I will handle it tomorrow. You can do that? Well, if I explain the situation to the phone company they will get something done. So Satsuki, you should get in touch with the police. Okay. It's great having you here. Because, if I am by myself I wouldn't know how to handle this. I am the one who's supposed to handle this. We are dating each other after all. We've been dating for two months? Yup, next Wednesday and it will be two months. So it's not been two months. Yup, it's not been two months yet. Don't you think we get along well so soon? Don't you like it? Of course, I do. We don't see each other often. But I'm fine with that. When I see you, I feel like fresh. We get along well. Getting along... Getting along... Oh my god, just do it already! That's fast! "24 hours eavesdropped" What are you up to? Ok... She comes back when the train's not running. She doesn't look like she rides the taxis either. That means she must be working close by. For someone like her it must be a family restaurant. That's correct Wha? - May I take your order? - Oh, yes. - An order of chili cheese fries. - Chili cheese fries. Welcome! Welcome! Here's the menu. "Sugiura" Sorry to make you wait. Who ordered the junior burger? Here you go. Thank you. Hello. Hi, I got a package delivery notice. Yes. I am wondering if you can deliver it... to Sugiura at Room 6085 instead? Yes, Sugiura. I think she will be back by 6:30. Yes, sorry for the trouble. Thank you. I though she was pretty. She went to work by train. And I greet here later. I wanted her to be my girl. At that moment, the train departure bell rang. Hello, I got your package. Oh! Thank you! - I am very sorry for the trouble. - No, not at all. The thing is I am out at work most of the time so the delivery man said he will just leave it with the neighbor. - I am really sorry about this. - Don't worry about it. Did you recently move here? Yes. I am sorry. I didn't even let you know. I am Kawase. Pleasure to meet you. I am Sugiura. Nice to meet you too. - Sorry about that. - Ok then, I will see you later. Yes. Thank you so much. - Yes. - Ah, please take these. Thanks so much for the package. Eh? Is it ok? Just sharing what I got. A greeting gift from the new neighbor. Thank you. Bye Bye. How, how did you know this number? It doesn't matter what you do... I will be with you... no matter... NO! Yuta! How did he find out the new number? This is weird. Did you call the police? Not yet... I am scared, Yuta. He said he's going to come... - Don't worry, - Just once a week? - I will find him. - For god's sake do it more often! Damn it. Hello? Yes, I would like to place a request. Yes, race queen please. Yes. Sorry to make you wait. Eh? Huh? Is that how it is? I don't mind but it is going to cost you extra. Who are you? I am Rena from Sukima Switch. Sukima Switch? Um, what is that? I mean... but... That's what people call a pervert. I am becoming quite drawn to it. So? You're living a quiet, or should I say a silent life? Miss Satsuki is becoming the center of my daily routine. I know more about her than someone who share a room with her. Well, yea. She's not hiding anything behind that wall. But you don't see a girl like this nowadays. She goes to work during the day, and work part time at the restaurant during the night. She even sends money back home. Don't you think that's admirable? No way I could've done that. That's true. But, she comes back 3am in the morning day after day... when she finish her night shift. Above all, I stayed up with her. I get very sleepy from that. - That's quite unhealthy. - I can't agree more. Oh yea. There's one place where I keep getting noise from the microphone. Is it a malfunction? How am I suppose to know? Come on. But, there is only one place where I can't hear well with the mic. What do you think it could be? Ask the master of eavesdropping, Ono. The debugger Ono. Before, you know too don't you. He places hidden mics in houses. Later he goes to the owner... and say something like "your house is bugged". After that he goes in and retrieve the mics and get the payment. He was the director of the whole case! At the end he got caught for this fraud. Your magazine featured this. Now they say he's working as a eavesdropper underground. Yea, in that field he's more famous than before. Master of eavesdropping, Ono... I can see your effort, but normally shouldn't you be using a wireless? I was thinking about saving up a bit... This is because someone else installed a mic. Eh! ? Who could it be? That mic's radio wave is interrupting yours, creating the noise. Eh! ? Hmm... Who could that be? Satsuki is at work today. He must be the one who installed the mics. It seems he installed something else. Let's go take a look. Eh? Wow! ? So this is what the room is like! It's different from my imagination after all. "Yuta" Ryo, here. Ah, this is it? I've seen this one on TV. It's the type you can place anywhere. My magazine made a special report on this type before too. It seems he's here to install this today. What is it? Wow, a hidden camera. This type does not send off strong radio signals. That means he's not far. Really? Is he a real pervert? You're not that much different either. What do we do with this and the mic? Just leave it. If we remove it he will just install new ones. That's true. Let's move. If we hang around for too long he's going to be back to check on the equipment. Okay. That's it, there's no mistake. Excuse me. Do you know where the Suguzaki Ichizen Ramen House is? I am not from around here so I am not sure. What? I don't live around here so I don't know where it is. Ah. Got it. Thank you. Yuta, you swine. Welcome. Oh hi. - Thanks for the gifts from before. - So you work here? That's right. During the day I work full time at a company. But during the night I work part-time here. Really? I didn't notice at all. I come here quite frequently lately. Eh? Really? Sorry, here's the menu. The canned crab from before was delicious. Thank you so much. No, it's nothing. When you go out again, please let me know. You really saved me that time. I look forward to my share. I see. Next time let's get Matsusaka beef. Matsusaka beef? Yay! Fried banana and cherry coke. Fried banana and cherry coke? Please wait for awhile. "Patisserie Hiroaki" Ah, Mr. Kawase Oh, hi! You have the day off today? Today my work start during the night. How about you? I work till noon, so I was working up a sweat at the gym. I see. Would you like to have a cup of tea? The cakes at Patisserie Hiroaki are irresistible. I know that store. They're delicious aren't they? So Mr. Kawase, you work with the media? That's right. But under a small publisher. I think I would feel easier if you just call me Ryo. Mr. Ryo, I am Satsuki. Miss Satsuki. During the day I work for an importing company. But I really wanted to work with the media. Really! You're kidding. Working for a magazine company you lose all of your free time. But I am quite envious that... you can get in a job you're interested in. Well, that's true. To have play time and work time merge into one... is actually quite interesting. So what do you do? During work? Meet all types of people and gather information. Do you meet anyone famous? For us, we don't get the chance. It's a pretty old fashioned magazine. Old fashion? We don't have any luck with the entertainment industry. What exactly do you mean? For example, introducing the underground sewers. - Underground sewer? - That's right. Normally you wouldn't even think about it right? But according to area and its land, there's actually various type of underground sewer... to handle different kind of conditions. Not a very popular field, but some people think it's a very interesting topic. That's interesting... And it's so true. Isn't it? Mr. Kawase, I mean Mr. Ryo. I can't imagine you doing it. Doing what? Traveling to and researching... every underground sewage in the nation. You can't just judge someone by their appearance. Do you travel a lot? Well, yea, quite often. That's nice. Why? You don't travel with your boyfriend? Yea. He just got hired this year and he's been quite busy. So it's just not possible. I see. Of course you would have a boyfriend. Though we've only been dating for two months. Ah, I see. Then you don't know him all that well yet right? 2 months is the stage where you really start to get to know him. That's right. How about you? Mr. Ryo? Your girlfriend. Me? I don't have one. So Miss Satsuki's already got a boyfriend... What a dark life I am leading... You said it. If you date with me, you will be able travel a lot. You mean I get to travel the waters? Underground sewage. It sure seems interesting. Touring the waterways. Underground sewage? Interesting? You serious? It seems fun? It's not fun? It can't be. I guess it can't be then. That swine. How are you? I will get you soon. I will have you... What do you want! ? Stop calling! What are you doing now? That freak. No! Hello? Oh, what is it? Could you come over today? Today might be a difficult. I am in the middle of work right now. Something wrong? It's that guy again. Eh? It's seems like it's getting more serious. I am so scared, Yuta. I really want to do something for you but I can't get away today. I will give the police a call and see if they can send a patrol over. I am sorry. Don't be. If anything happens give me a call. Being able to talk to you makes me feel more calmed down now. I feel alright now. Thanks. I wish I can be with you more often... I am sorry I am not dependable at a time like this. That's not true. You've been a great help. Really? I am glad you said that. Ok then, hang in there. If you feel uneasy again, give me a call. Good night. Good night. Miss Satsuki, that guy's dangerous... Sorry to have you out during work. Don't worry about it. What is it? I am starting to worry. What kind of freak would do something like this? He must be a pervert. Excuse me. Sorry to keep you waiting. Tibet style spicy steamed dumplings. Thai style spicy yakisoba. Vietnamese spring rolls. Spicy steamed dumplings, spicy yakisoba, and spring rolls? Will that be all? Please wait for awhile. So you're working around here today? I've been working with 30 companies since the morning. Wow. But I can't handle it at all, I am worn out. Hello, this is Konishi. Thank you, Mr. Isono. Is that so? I am glad to hear it. That's great. That would really help me out. I will be there in an hour then. Thank you. Phew, the client I was handling this morning gave me the OK. That's great. It's been going well today. I guess I should go to the police after all. Like I said. Sorry, excuse me for a second. Hello, Konishi. Thank you. I am sorry for troubling you a few days ago. I appreciate it. Regarding the goods we talked about a few days ago. We'll just go with it. Thank you. What was it? - Don't worry, it's taken care of. - I see. Excuse me. Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's the spring rolls. The rest will be here shortly. Okay. - Delivery. - Thanks. You have a caring mother. She sent you stuff again. I will give you your share in a bit. Thank you! Oh, and there's one more. - Okay. - It's moving... You want to know what's inside? - Eh? - Come on in. Eh? But I want to know... Wow! Shrimps! They taste great. Take some with you. I've never seen live shrimps before. Or should I say, I don't know how to cook these. It's easy, here. It's okay. Hey stop! Clam down! Satsuki, help me out. Watch out! What is she doing? Where did she go? Ahh... That was great. It makes me wonder what those fried shrimps I've had before were. Didn't I say that? Wait, didn't you say they look so sad before? That's because they were alive before you fried them. Well, that's true. Live shrimps and fried shrimps are completely different. They are. Before they were fried they looked like aliens and it's just disgusting. But when they are fried, it's like "I know these, fried shrimps, I've seen them". Yea. You are good at cooking. Well, I've been living alone for awhile. I got trained for it. You don't cook often? Not at all. Eh? Why? It's fun if you try it. Ahh... you seem to get along with your family. Well, yea. For me, my family is on the verge of breaking down. Why? When I was in high school, a robbery case occurred in my area At the time, my father quited his job and was in the house. For some reason he was suspected as the robber. Suspected as the robber? My family was treated as criminals in the entire area. We got the stares, and my brother and I get harassed at school. But, the case was solved right? They soon found the real robber and my father's name cleared. But due to this, my father and mother divorced. Really? Wow, that's some pretty serious talk. It seems if you have that happen once, you just can't get back on your feet again. We moved and transferred, and my mother was all drained out. Really? Wow, that's some serious talk. That's tough. But I can't see that from you Miss Satsuki. You seem cheerful and it's hard to imagine you're carrying all that on your mind. It might be because I try not to think about it. I see. But I won't forgive the police. I hate them. That's understandable... You are strong. When I talk with you, Ryo. I feel I can say stuff that I usually don't talk about. Maybe because you work with the media. - Me? - You're good at making people talk Really? I am flattered. Excuse me. Hello? I'm in neighbor's room. I was giving the neighbor's package to him, and he treated me to dinner... Stop being an airhead! I got some time now so I will head over now, I will be there in 5 minutes. Okay. I will see you later. Um... I have to go back to my room. So I will excuse myself. Ah, ok. Come again anytime. It was delicious. Thanks for the meal. Good night. Good night. - Yes? - Is this alright? I know it's not Matsusaka beef. It's Matsusaka beef! Or not. Didn't I just say that? But all these... Thanks. Alright, come again anytime. - Good night. - Good night. Yes. Who's that? The neighbor I was talking about. He gave me some of the stuff he got in the package. Oh? I see. Is everything alright? Eh? What are you talking about? Ah, the phone harassment? I guess I forgot about it. Everything's fine. That's good. Huh? Stop. Stop it! Yuta, you're acting funny today. You're the one who's acting funny. Stop it. It hurts... Be gentle... Sorry. Don't be rough. I know. You're scary today, Yuta. That's not true. I don't want this. You're interested in the guy next door? Satsuki, that guy's no good. I tell you. Damn it. Good evening. I am the one who's dating Sugiura Satsuki next door. Please take these... I am wondering, could you have sex with Satsuki please? What are you talking about? You've given her quite a lot of gifts. Tell me the truth, you just want to have sex with Satsuki right? I don't mind. - You're an idiot. - But, do it at her room please. She will feel easier that way. - What are you talking about? - Please. Idiot. What is it? Cut it out already. - You waited? - No. - I got it. Taiyaki. - Ah... That's good. Thank you. It's just as delicious as before. It's different from the others after all. It used good red beans, and the sweetness is right on the spot. The outside is crispy, and the inside is soft. This will be it for awhile. It's tough over here too. I know. You come here often when you were little. Really? You don't remember? You often trip over there and cried about it. Really? You're such a helpless daughter. Look who's talking. The way they baked this is good too. It's probably because they used good flour. Satsuki. You're going back now? It's a piece of cake till today. Starting in two days it's going to be hell though. You're early today too, Satsuki. I got early shift today. Eh? You want to go to dinner together? Eh? Should I? Okay! It's been decided. Let's go. Let's go. My mother said it was all paid up a long time ago. Okay, Hide close in, close in, close in. Kyoko, look frightened. Over there yes. Hide, lines. Whatever, just pay up. That's not possible. Don't make fun of me. My mother said it was all paid up a long time ago. That old hag's... That old hag's... Lying. Lying. I know that old hag's lying. But, it's surprising you didn't turn me down today. Surprising? Because, usually girls that have boyfriends... have it pretty tough in this kind of situation. But don't they at least go out for dinner? Oh, really? Isn't that the case? Although I usually don't. But you're such a charming guy. Whatever... Ryo, you've talked about it before. That the second month is when you really get to see your partner. I said that? You don't remember? Well, you said it. Right now I can really feel those words coming at me. Oh, something good. Isn't that a good sign? What is it? It's getting harder and harder to understand him. I thought he was this type of person, but recently he's been completely different. Seeing him like this makes me uneasy. I wonder if I can still keep going. If that's what you think you should just quit. Is it that easy? I mean, isn't that a very important part of the relationship? If you are beginning to have trouble seeing how you two connect, then that's not good. That's true. There are many ways to make money, and I am going to teach you. I am going to teach you, so... Please stop. Before I sell you off you're going to make some money for me. Stop. Stop it. Well, if I can't get anything out of you. There are others I can get money from. Like your boyfriend for example. Give it back! What are you doing! ? Bug off! Oww I see you've got a lot of calls from him. Yuta, phone call Why is it me? It doesn't have anything to do with me! Well, we'll just have Yuta pay off everything. This room... I just can't shake the feeling that I am being watched. Don't you feel it too? Something's fishy. Who's peeping at us! ? I am gonna kill you! ...and I order a hot cocoa, and what do you think my friend ordered? No idea. A hot ice tea. Hot ice tea... What in the world is that suppose to mean? I wouldn't be able to understand that. Ah, good night. Good night. Thanks for the meal. No, let's go again sometime. - Good night. - Good night. What do we do with this? If no one wants it, I will take it. Okay. Nope. Okay, I will leave the rest to you guys. I am going to get my share from Yuta. See you. Thanks. This is a present from Yuta. Mr. Konishi. I have important business with you regarding Satsuki Sugiura. Mr. Konishi. I'm not here! Konishi, get your butt out. Konishi! Mr. Konishi moved out already. I think it was 2 days ago? Oh really? I don't know what to do anymore. The cell phone won't connect. When I went to his house I found out he moved. I have no idea where he works. He went missing and I lost contact with him completely Hmm... I don't know. It seems like a mystery novel. Okay your left hand's index finger. Using this kind of method to shake me off. That's so low. Ok, thank you. If I know he's going to do this, I would've break up with him. Ah. So annoying. If he's that kind of man isn't it just perfect? You don't have to deal with him and he disappears from your life. Consider yourself lucky. In fact, I think it's better for you to thinking that way. Really? Hey, Ryo do you find me attractive? Of course. - You think so? - Yes. Then have you ever thought about having sex with me? You are drunk aren't you? Answer me. Have you? - Yea, I've thought about it. - Eh? Since when? Eh? Since when? When we first met. Ah... I suppose. That's so dirty... That means when I came here with packages, you wanted to do me? - You're too drunk. - How indecent. The thing is, even though he breaking up with me is still very irritating. I don't feel sad at all. Instead, I feel a sense of freedom. That's right, maybe I am lucky. Ryo, let's dance. No, I am fine. What is it? Something wrong? No, it's something with me. What's the problem? It's just... you are different from the Satsuki I know. Isn't that a funny thing to say? You don't know anything about me. But... It's alright, I forgive you. I am going back. Don't worry, I am not mad or sad. Good night. Ahh... Good night. Damn it. Yes. What now? What do you want? Why do I have to pay for your debt? - Give it back. - Debt? What debt? Give my money back! Satsuki, because of you, my life is all messed up. I want to screw you... I want to screw you... Yuta, don't tell me you're the one... It doesn't matter what you do, no matter where you are, we'll be together... NO! NO! Such a pretty face. NO! Come on. Cry! Scream! Help! I got you... I caught you... See? Someone help me... - No! - Cry, come one! Cry, come one! Get out, Satsuki. Get out of here! So have you slept with Satsuki already? That's none of your business. Did you make her lick? Did Satsuki lick yours already? Yea. It was great. I made her do it the whole day! What a witch. Aren't you embarrassed? What a shame! Did you do her back? Did you do her from the back? Of course I did. Back, top, whatever, I screwed her over and over! What have you done? Die! I am not going to give in to your conspiracy! You had sex with her! You had sex with Satsuki! Hey, that's no good, Yuta. Out doing something like this... Get ahold of yourself and pay back your debt. With that said, let's go, Yuta. Yes, let's go. Ryo. - You okay? - Yea, I am fine. There's blood coming out, what do we do? - Don't worry, it's just a scratch. - Really? Oh man... He's really lost it. He's crazy. Ryo, I am going to wash myself off. When I am calmed down, I will come back and properly thank you. Got it. Thank you so much. Take it easy. Ok. I will see you later. So what did I tell you? You're lucky you broke up with him. Ryo. Satsuki! Umm... I... You see... Let's begin. Oh. Hey, Burton. Who is this? This is my girlfriend. - Girlfriend? - Hi. I'm Christine. Are you freaking kidding me? I'm breaking up with you. Christine... - You kissed me. You kissed me. - You kissed me. You kissed me. Damn it if I wouldn't kiss you again right now. Did you hear about the restaurant on the moon? No. Great food-- no atmosphere. Okay. That's good. All right, who wants some more pancakes? Okay, my turn. A traveling salesman stops at a farm. The farmer has three daughters and a cow. Richard! Richard, no. There's no more coffee. Richard finished it off. Oh, Richard did. Yeah, just make some more. I don't know how. So, honey, what do you think? First day of fourth grade. New teacher. - Are you nervous? - No. 'Cause even though you're nervous, honey, and you're gonna miss Mrs. Belt, remember, you're getting a new teacher who might even be better than Mrs. Belt. Better how? Well... I had a fourth-grade teacher who was really nice. He even took us camping once. Just the girls. Oh, Richard, you know what, you better get going, if you're going to finish the drywall in the laundry room. I'm not paying you to eat pancakes. You're not paying me at all. Say good-bye to your bonus. Okay, buddy, you need to go upstairs and brush your teeth. - Not just the front two. - Okay. Yeah, you've got to brush all the ones that show. - Okay, I'll take him. Oh! - Oh, what a big boy. I want him gone. What is your problem? He is here all the time, drinks all the coffee. He eats all the food. He falls asleep on the couch with his hand in his pants. And if he's doing all that, what do you need me for? Oh, come on. I need you. You're my brother. It's in my will. You're pulling my plug. Wait. I thought Mom was pulling your plug. No, Mom is pulling your plug. You're pulling my plug. You know what? Pull your own plug. Come on. We have to be nice to Richard. He's in pain. I mean not only did "New Christine" break up with him, but she won't even return his phone calls. He's having a hard time. So you're just letting him hang around here out of the goodness of your heart? Yeah. You know me. I'm a good person. Shut up. I am. Right, or you're taking advantage of his neediness to make you feel less lonely. Oh, Matthew, that is so awful. Who do you think I am? Well, it's either that or you're exploiting his break-up to get him to build you a new laundry room. Yeah, that's who I am. But how did the salesman not know the difference between a cow and a farmer's daughter? Sweetie, you have got to let this go, okay? It is not a true story, and it's filthy. Okay? Now go and find your cubby. - Hello, Christine. - Hello. You made it back. Yes, of course I made it back. Why wouldn't I make it back? How was your vacation? Don't say "vacation." She works. She's probably going to get fired just for being here. No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine. No, my summer was great, actually. Richard's building me a new laundry room. It's got a super-capacity washing machine. It's so big you could practically live in it. The box alone is bigger than my bedroom. Well, we have some boxes in the garage if you need some more. Oh, no, no. That was, that was a joke. Oh. Okay. So, have you, um, have you heard anything about the new teacher? Kelsey didn't even want to come today. Yeah, Kelsey had a bit of a girl crush on Mrs. Belt last year. I think that's pretty standard for third grade. Is it? She's not a lesbian! Well, you know what? We're all going to miss Mrs. Belt. Oh, hello ladies. I'm Daniel Harris, the fourth grade teacher. You're welcome to hang around if you like, while the kids are introducing themselves. You know, new classroom, new teacher... We all have a few first-day head Shiomi arrested Takamaro Tamiya and 8 other RAF members pulled off the first hijacking in Japan. Their goal is to receive military training in North Korea for an armed insurrection in the fall. Fearful in the wake of the hijacking, the police arrested anyone suspected of being a member of the RAF. Over 200 are arrested. The words "Red Army Crime" were born. Takahara, you're under arrest for possession of weapons. June 7 : RAF member Hiroyuki Takahara arrested June 23, 1970 : 770.000 gathered to protest against the Security Treaty The Japan-US Security Treaty was automatically extended. After a 10 year period, either government could unilaterally dissolve it. But neither America, using bases in Japan for military action in Asia or Japan, supported economically through exports to the US has the will. The Security Treaty, or Japan-US League, remains to this day. Mieko, it's your fault that Takahara got caught. It was a trap. Cheer up. You're so strong, Fusako. But no me. I'm just a drag. Everyone's disappeared. It's up to us. We've got to do what we can. It'll work out. Sorry to keep you waiting. Welcome. Long time no see. Yeah, it's been awhile. Thank you. The RFL (Revolutionary Left Faction), a splinter group calling for armed struggle sympathized with the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Dec 18 : A Police Station in Itabashi, Tokyo They attacked a police station to steal guns. Their plan was to attack a court bus using the guns Haruhiko Shibano, 24, RLF Shot to death But it ended with the killing of the activists. It was the first time after the war that a left-wing activist was The RLF (Revolutionary Left Faction) has carried on political guerrilla warfare exposing American imperialism. The reactionary rule over the country through Hiroshi Sakaguchi, 25, RLF Therefore, attacks against the bases is the starting point for guerrilla warfare. Koichi Teraoka, 23, RLF Last year's 11/21 US-Japan joint declaration not only forces Japan to follow American anti-communism, anti-Chinese policies but exposes the intent to resurrect the East Asia Co-Prosperity sphere Kunio Bando, 23, RAF among Japanese reactionaries. Our patriotic struggle against the US will expose the deplorable enemy. It is the first step in true autonomy for the people and the realization of revolution in Japan through the heroic struggle An Inn in Saitama Prefecture of comrade Shibano, we've embarked on a new people's collective. The RAD has pursed "continual uprisings" and "international bases" taking revolutionary war as the manifestation of global communism. These power-seizing revolts take the form of immediate confrontation. While the revolutionary war takes the form of enduring struggle, a long-term struggle to crush the enemy and set up the revolutionary forces. Victory in these continuous uprisings will be marked by the global Red Army establishing the front lines of world revolution. In armed struggle, the party makes the army, and the army makes the party. We take on the legacy of comrade Shibano, massacred by the ruling powers. Mori, if the RAF has guns, can you give some to us ? the RAF is under heavy pressure, but you're seeing your faith share too, right ? It seems we're both being labeled "ultra extremists". Tsuneo Umenai, 23, RAF With the collapse of the politburo, we should advance the armed struggle not as a single party, but as independent groups, with pipe bombs and guerrilla warfare. If the preliminary struggles this spring can gather a broad array of forces, they can succeed. It is also easier for factional elements No, the armed struggle will be lead from here by the central committee. Loss of factionalism means the end of the RAF. Are you stupid ? You can't win a guerrilla war no matter how many bombs you build. Guerrilla wars requires guns ! Political process isn't the same as making bombs. Listen up ! More than the preliminary spring struggles, we must now envision the militarization of the party. So, I want to divide the party into the "revolutionary front" the public face in charge of information and the "central army" conducting military training. Bando, Onishi, Mastuda. I want you 3 to organize a military unit. Aoto, you'll be the liaison between Mikio Aoto, 21, RAF the revolutionary front and the central army. Shigenobu, please form a committee on international bases. Most of the leaders who established the RAF were already arrested. This led to Mori seizing power within the organization though he had deserted just prior to the forming of the RAF and was only recently readmitted. Mori was the eldest member with a direct relation to Tamiya who had hijacked the Yodogo plane Telegram ! Mr. Tsukada, you have a telegram ! Telegram. Masakuni Yoshino, 22, RLF Seiji Segi, 20, RLF Feb 17, 1971 : RLF attack the Tsukada Gun Shop in Mooka City They acquire ten shotguns, a air gun, and 2000 rounds of ammo Don't give up ! We reject the bourgeois system of private property and advance the militarization and politicization of the party by gaining revolutionary funding. Soo, the forced appropriation of Sanrizuka starts and prefectural cops will be concentrated there. We have to take advantage of this gap. Let's put Plan M to work ! No objection ! Feb 22 : Tatsumidai Post Office, Chibe prefecture Teacher's 3.000.000 yen salary stolen This isn't like you, Mieko. Even if someone calls me Mrs. Okudaira, I don't feel like it's me yet. But it was through Okudaira's family register that I could get a passport. I decided to leave before getting sniffed out by security. Take care. See you around. You take care too. Feb 28 : International Red Army member Fusako Shigenobu departs for Lebanon Late May : RLF's Kosode Base We'll undertake guerrilla warfare here from now on inheriting the spirit of our massacred revolutionary comrade we'll take out all surveillance bases and police stations Steal the cop's guns ! Using their guns in the fight is the first step Yoshitaka Kato, 21, RLF towards a people's revolution We'll fight with the RAF and carry out all-out war ! No objection ! Unified Red Army July 15, 1971, the RAF and RLF join to form the Unified Red Army. One month later, based on the opinion of RLF leader Kawashima, the name is changed to United Red Army (URA). Because of that anti-revolutionary Mukaiyama, I'm afraid the enemy knows about these place. We have to start looking for a new base right away. Torayoshi Maezawa, 23 Kazuko Kojima, 22 Step on it ! Goddammit ! Who is it ? Hiroko Nagata. Two people got away. So, it will be dangerous to use bases at Kosode or Enzan. We're looking for other places now. For revolution, each person must consider himself a revolutionary soldier. They have to objectify themselves. In fact, we're dealing with the same problem. Why has our growth bee so spontaneous and undirected ? RAF Safehouse Because it itself exists around a tactical "sphere". Jun Yamazaki, 20 The historical tradition in Japan of anti-Stalinism and Trotskyism stopped with the strategic goal Ryuzaburo Shindo, 20 of the dictatorship of the Proletariat. In other words, in order to achieve Yasuhiro Uegaki, 22 truly global revolutionary warfare a class war that simultaneously enacts socialism As a result of plan M, they were the sole survivors of the Central Arm and the toppling of imperialism, domestically and internationally reflect on global communism only then can we begin to fight tendencies toward unplanned spontaneity and empiricism. How long will you guys be up ? I'll never get to sleep ! I can't stand living like this anymore ! Yoshiko, wait, calm down ! It's ok, take it easy. Yoshiko, calm down ! Being a liaison is tough, but it is a vital job. To achieve revolution, all of us have to take on intense duties. That's how we've succeeded so far, right. Let's do it together. But once the all-out war begins, things are going to change. There are sure to be challenges and heavy duties we'll have to face. That's what revolution means. So, if you want to go home or go some place, go ahead. What do you want to do ? I want to bu with Ruy. With all these spies and deserters, we need to take serious measures. Without pushing ourselves through such a process all-out war will never get carried out. Heard you all ran into some cops last time. What did you tell them ? Nothing, really... Go ahead, have a drink. No, I'm okay. Well, I think it's time for me to go. Hey, Mukaiyama, you doing alright ? I've gotta meet someone, so let me go. Hey, slow down. It's a really important meeting. With whom ? The cops ? Stop, stop it ! Shiginori Mukaiyama, 21, executed We took care of both of them. Did you have them speak before you did it ? If they don't admit to their crimes, then it's just a regular death. If they don't reflect and criticize themselves, It won't be a revolutionary death. Yeah, you're right. By the way, what happened with the RAF ? Yasuko Haiki, 21, executed I'll behave... take me to the mountain. You took care of Mochihara, I guess. RLF Tanzawa Base Motohisa Kato, 16, RLF Welcome. These are my little brothers. The three RLF brothers of the Kato household, eh ? Right on ! Everyone is out in duty, it's just us. Check this out. The Core Faction has taken the front line. Three Police die at Narita They're really going for it. Other groups using bombs begin to appear Kawashima, a warrant for your arrest. RLF Chairman Go Kawashima's wife, Yoko Yoshitaka Kato and 5 others arrested RLF members Seiji Segi and Shinobu Matsumoto escape Hey everyone, Segi an dMatsumoto took off. What are you up to ? We're going to cross the mountain and head to the South Alps. Really ? If you have any problems, go ahead and use the hut up there. Thanks very much. What's up ? You look... I'll have a beer. Hi Kin. Long time no see. But, we might not meet again for a while. Hiroshi Kin, 20, RAF Are you going under ? I keep asking 'em to let me join up with the underground Central Army. But they never listen. It seems I'm always suspect. Worrying about it won't do any good. Cheer up ! Our turn is coming next. The real battle is going to start by next May when Okinawa is returned. It'll be an intense battle. But I'm ready. You're all pumped up. I want to be reborn as a Red Army soldier. Hurry up and call me. Don't get too down. Dec 3 : RAF Arakura Base Before the general assembly, I want to raise the issue of the water. Thought we had to spend a night on a ridge with no water to each the base the RLF failed to prepare water canisters. Fortunately, we were able to replenish. But this could have endangered Setsuko Otsuki, 23 the joint military training operation. Heiji Iwata, 20 so first, I'd like to hear self-criticism for lacking revolutionary awareness. True, we were naive about the water canteens. We hadn't had water problems with any bases before. i heard we had to spend a night without water, but hadn't thought that far. I admit our negligence could have ruined the plans and criticize myself. I'll raise my revolutionary consciousness and fight through the all-out war. No objection ! Joint Military Training - Day One Joint Military Training - Day Two Take up the side ! Here we go, fire ! I can't hear you. Move quickly. I can't hear you. Leave more space ! Hurry, get up ! Toyama, why did you come to the mountain ? Why ? I cam for military training. No, I mean what feelings prompted you to come ? In order to advance the revolutionary war, I understood that I would have to become a soldier. in the enduring stage of conflict of the global revolutionary war, we must develop the revolutionary war in advanced countries... But you, why did you come here ? You haven't said a word about yourself. Why did you come to the mountain ? What do you want me to say ? We don't want to hear those kinds of things, but your actual feelings. We want to know why you want to be a revolutionary soldier. For the revolutionary war, we must take on a militant quality and... No, that's not it. In more practical terms. Because it is an extremely real situation we face. Why did you put on makeup this morning ? Why do you need makeup in the mountains ? Why are you growing your hair out ? Before, my hair was short, and the police knew that so I decided ti grow it in order to do underground activities. If that's the case, why not just use a wig ? I think there's another reason. What is it ? Toyama, why don't you take you your ring ? It's important. My mom gave it to me. Aren't you brushing your hair during meetings ? Shu just became a soldier, and we haven't worked out the woman problem yet. I accept responsibility for raising the issue. This is probably a difference between city safe houses and mountain bases. I think it's a difference in style between the RAF and the RLF. What have you all done since you came to the mountain ? you haven't done a thing. The RAF doesn't understand anything. You have this great mountain hut, and plenty of food. But, living in a mountain base isn't so simple. If things are like this, all the work put in by the RLF will be meaningless. There's no way we can work together. We accept the RLF's criticisms of Toyama as general critiques of the RAF. Though, the RLF's mutual and self-criticism emerged naturally, evaluation from the perspective of the communist movement is also worthy. We must address the relations between each revolutionary group from that perspective. Through mutual critique, from each individual becoming communist the all-out war can be won. No objection ! Thus, until comrade Toyama criticizes her activities and becomes a communist, we will not let her leave the mountain. All of us will support comrade Toyama's self-critique. She herself must work hard to go through critique. Additionally, self-criticism is demanded of all others who require it. Anyone leaving the mountain for something other than prescribed duty will be executed. No objection ! No objection ! Final day of joining military training Michiyo Kaneko, 23 Hurry up, c'mon. It's ok, hurry up ! - A little more. - Hurry, you're lagging ! Yamada, can you take over ? There are scratches right here. Wasn't it Shindo in charge of the guns ? Shindo, neglecting these scratches was irresponsible. Shindo, we've been activists together a long time. You must have a lot to tell me. I don't mind, go ahead and criticize. I want to critique my past activities. Oh, I've got a bunch. Uegaki, do you know what critique involves ? It's not like there is some set procedure. Toyama, you don't understand a damn thing. No one can teach you how to do self-critique. Self-critique means you alone discover the most revolutionary task for you. And Shindo, you didn't even notice the scratches on the guns, how can you criticize Uegaki, you asshole ! Before you criticize him, you have a lot to criticize yourself over. Both of you will undergo critique through training ! You too, Namekata ! Masatoki Namekata, 22 All three of you should reflect on the significance of the struggle up to now. Think about how to elevate the struggle from here. The three of them are ideologically loose, we can't be easy on them. Everyone must lead together so they can complete self-critique. Now we will hear the results from each of them individually. But the content of their critiques must be expressed by them or it's meaningless. What did you acquire through training ? I will reborn, I will start from scratch as a revolutionary soldier. no, that isn't self-critique, that's nothing. You must engage in critique more subjectively ! How have you critiqued your activities up to now ? How do you see the failed struggle at Tokyo University ? You haven't gone through self-criticism at all. I've been ambiguous up to now about the all-out war. but through training, I've been able to banish those thoughts. You've put the RAF Central Army in grave danger because of Mochihara. If you aren't critiquing yourself for that, what the hell are you doing ? You must continue ! Toyama, just a little more, keep it up. Stay strong ! I'm going to Haruna base. I'll be back in a week. Make sure they undergo self-criticism. I think Toyama is sending money to Shigenobu in Palestine. Find out the route and how much she's sending. Don't be deceived. Toyama, when you contact Shigenobu, where do you send the letters ? You sent money too, right ? How much and how did you send it ? Mori wants to know. Tell us. If you can tell us, write it down. We'll put it in an envelope and give it to him. Dec 15 : The RLF base at Haruna is complete Thanks for your hard work. Go ahead. Welcome. First, we're having a thorough discussion. The RLF's attack on the police station last December showed that the struggle with the enemy is one of "kill or be killed" and that winning the all-out war requires the captures of arms. The attack on the gun shop in February was fought in practice as a reflection stemming from the December attack. But these arms, revolutionized by theft, Mitsuo Ozaki, 22 brought heavy pressure from the enemy Makie Terabayashi, 23 Aiko Nakamura, 22 during this deadly time of war. The RLF's withdrawal to the mountain is imbued with this protective struggle. In this process leading ultimately to all-out war, In this process leading we must reaffirm and debate our own Kazuko Ito, 22 revolutionary status as individuals. So our first task is to question whether each of us can truly maintain this path to all-out war. We must question ourselves once more. Thus, the RAF and the RLF will no longer pursue communist revolution as separate subjects. We will do so together as an armed URA with one subjectivity. No objection. Welcome back. Junichi Yamamoto, 28 His wife, Yasuko, 28 Hey, it's my big brother ! Welcome back. I put absolute faith in the leadership of the RLF. The "Commemoration for the Massacre of Comrade Shibano" held at the public hall in Itabashi. Was the first great step towards the all-out war. The leaders purged the names of RLF members from the hosts and sought unexpected comments. Plus, they prescribed separatism with regard to the legal members who planned the meeting. the legal members followed the leader's suggestions in hosting the 12/18 meeting and deserve no criticism. Now is the time for all members -legal and imprisoned, to forge militant bonds and pursue all-out war. Thus, with the meeting falling into chaos, the leaders' calls for factionalism warrant self-criticism. Among those who were caught last month why were you alone able to get out after 23 days ? Because I kept my mouth shut. you did talk to the police, right ? Yes, when they let me eat. Yes, when they let me eat. Then, you didn't keep your mouth shut completely. But I didn't let them make a record. In an age of all-out war, casual conversation is not silence. In reflecting on your prison time, you self-criticism must being with your arrest. right, tell us everything about getting caught. You should be critiquing all your activities up to now. Let's going. Hold on ! I'm coming. Lately, I've been thinking about death. They keep saying "self-critique" but I don't always know what they mean. Lately, Mori has gotten really strong. He might be able to pull it off. But I don't think escaping is an option. For the revolution top succeed, we must critique our past activities. We can't be intimidated. In front of Mori and everyone, you've got to change your attitude. I know. My ability to make the leap is being questioned. Take over for me. I'm catching cold. What's up ? You okay ? I'm scared. I feel like what happened before could happen again. It's alright, Kojima. It won't happen again. I don't want to die. I want to get off the mountain. You can't say that. If they find out, you're in trouble. I don't understand what Nagata and Mori are talking about. What do I do ? Its rough, but you have to do self-critique. How do I do it ? If we just go through self-critique, we can make a revolution ? You're supposed to be undergoing self-critique. What the fuck are you doing ? Is this a serious critique ? Hey, Kato ! Where the hell do you think you are ? Kato and Kojima have spoiled the sacred space of the party. We have to destroy the limitations to your self-critique. In order to overcome those limits, we must "beat" them. You'll come to with the self-awareness of a new human, capable of being communist. Leadership means beating. Now is the time to put tis leadership into practice. We must forge the party in preparation for all-out war. No objection ! Kato, criticize your shameful acts and answer with the necessary reflection ! In the opinion report on the December meeting, the point on guns was absent. Do you really have the will to fight in the all-out war ? When I was arrested, I criticize myself for not trying to break free. I soiled the sacred space of the party. Listen, this is the revolutionary praxis of self-critique. You need to be more revolutionary ! And you called me petit bourgeois ! Kojima, you're guilty too. Stand up. Wait, wait, wait. If a man beats her, that won't work, it'll just make her happy. Sugisaki, Kaneko. - Stand up and get to it. - Critique them ! No crying ! Everyone move aside. Hurry up. Hey, you've got to beat him too. So he undergoes proper critique. Hurry and beat him ! You need to do this for your own advance. It hurts, but you've got to stick with it. Think of it as practice for all-out war ! Overcome this situation and finish the critique. Show your will. Brother ! Critique yourself ! Motoshisa ! This is helping your comrades. Pummel him ! Critique yourself ! The demand for Kato's critique is the externalization of self-criticism. But, you were resentful of him calling you petit bourgeois. Your criticism of him was based on individual feelings. This warp the meaning of critique and trivializes his transition to communism. So, you need to critique your own past activities. Ozaki, what is your self-critique for the 12/18 action ? Shibano invited you but you didn't go. Had there been one more person, he might not have been killed by the police. ow do you critique yourself for that ? What would you have done if you had been there ? Show us how you would confront the cops ! Can someone play the part of the police ? - Stand up. - Critique yourself ! You're not done yet. This is meaningless. Ozaki, do you have what it takes to do self-critique ? Reporting instructions. Tomorrow the RAF will evacuate from here. and Namenaka will affirm their self-critique and move with us to Harune base. After Uegaki and Yamazaki remove all traces and personal effects. They will gather at Haruna Base. Aoto will contact the revolutionary front in Tokyo. Ah, dumplings, dumplings. That guy has no idea what critique means. If we just leave him, he'll never be able to do it. With Kato, we pummeled his face to instill that reflection, but still, he didn't get it. In demanding critique, we have ti make them lose consciousness. For Ozaki's critique, concentrate on the stomach to make him pass out. Ozaki, your spirit needs ti be more revolutionary. Hang in there. Work through the critique ! Stick with it. You'll be reborn as a soldier of the revolution. Hang in there, Ozaki ! Tonight is New Year's Eve, so let's feast. I have something to report before we eat. Ozaki is dead. It was a death of defeat. The communist movement we stake our lives on is a battle he couldn't win. He brought on his own death through defeat. His death does not belong to us. He could not critique his own defeatism and this resulted in his death. W will overcome his defeat. We must greet the New Year with a new commitment to advancing. Let us be thankful for our food. Dec 31, 1971 : Mitsuo Ozaki, 21, dead Ozaki had been Sakaguchi's junior at Tokyo Fisheries University. I criticize myself for failing to notice the scratches on the guns. With such negligence, can you fight the all-out war ? What is your self-critique for letting Mochibara get way and putting the party in danger ? Stand up. Be strong. Shindo, it's for the revolution, critique yourself. Make yourself a communist. Shindo, your critique is called for ! Why are you doing this to me ? Is this really... necessary... for the revolution ? You must consider the reasons on your own. You must undergo self-critique ! Hey, Toyama. Namekata ! Is your critique over ? If so, you should be able to do this too. Go ahead ! C'mon, hurry. It's for Shinoda. What was your critique at Arakura base ? You do it too ! Go ahead ! I can't do it. What did you do at Arakura ? When did you change clothes ? Why do you come up to the mountain to worry about how you look ? You haven't completed your critique ! Reactionary. I thought you were a revolutionary soldier. Shindo was arrested at Yasuda Hall at Tokyo University in January 1969. After being released, he organized day laborers in Tokyo and Yokohama before joining the RAF. A member of the unit that plotted Plan M, he didn't follow Mori's instructions. He had Mochihara escape to avoid execution. Jan 1, 1972 : Ryuzaburo Shindo, 21, dead Kojima had been a junior of Terabayashi's, joining the RLF to fight the security treaty. She had been Yoshitaka Kato's lover. She had always regretted participating in the executions of Haiki and Mukaiyama. Jan 1 : Kazuko Kojima, 22, dead I'm back. I've brought a couple comrades. Excuse me. Long time no see. How's it going ? Where's Shindo ? Don't just sit there. Say something ! Your statements are no self-critique. Do you really have the will for critique ? You being a founding member of the RAF has no bearing here and now. I don't want to wind up like Kojima. I don't want to die. I want to live. But, I just don't understand how to self-critique. You don't understand anything. Saying "I want to live" is an abandoning of revolutionary thought. A defeat with regard to communism. To give yourself to party-building as a communist is the only meaning of "living". Critique yourself ! What do you think of yourself ? This is why you're messed up. Do you know what is means to become a communist ? Don't go using coquetry as a weapon. Have Toayama do critique by burying Kojima I'm gonna do self-critique all the way, and be a solider for revolution ! I'll endure the agony. So, give me more trials. I won't give up. Take a good look at Kojima's face ! It's the face of defeat. Even after death, she's anti-revolutionary. I carried the body because I had to overcome my fear of death in order to become a revolutionary soldier. With this, I've taken one step closer. That's not what I'm asking ! Are you capable of critiquing yourself ? Let's see you hit yourself. Yes, I'll do it. Show me how you do critique without help from your comrades. Strike those proud lips ! Crush that naughty nose ! Aim for those leering eyes ! No resting ! Keep going until you finish the critique ! You can't be soft ! Go ahead and take a look at that face boys found so charming. Please let me go to the bathroom. Please let me go to the bathroom. Dirty slut. Yoshitaka...? my brother... Anyone who could do this is beyond hope. Anyone who could do this is beyond hope. Anyone who could do this is beyond hope. This isn't revolution. Among the RLF, only Kato and Maezawa opposed the executions of Haiki and Mukaiyama. It's so cold... Can someone undo the rope... Nevermind... it's ok like this. My hands... my hands hurt... Someone... cut off my hands. Don't cut them... Mom, I'm going to do it. Mom... Mom... I'll persevere. Just wait... I'll make you so happy. I won't give up, mom... Shut the fuck up ! Jan 7 : Mieko Toyama, 25, dead Jan 9 : Masatoki Namekata, 22, dead Namekata had been arrested at the barricades at Tokyo University and joined the RAF after his release on bail. Becoming a communist. Is not a question of your record in past struggles. It must be judged by becoming a communist and forming a new revolutionary party to begin the war. The RAF has critiqued those whose consciousness was lagging. The communist movement develops through multiples enduring junctions requiring proletarian loyalty and humanity. In order to advance this movement. Without more effort than the six who died of defeat, we cannot win. I want each of us to examine our actions, to sort out our tasks. Does your silence mean there are no problems with your actions ? Truly, can all of you become communists ? To win the revolution, each party member must undergo through self-criticism. You must all squarely face your own tasks. And critique deeply. If I continue like this, I will never become a communist. Since I had sexual relations with Mukaiyama who was executed last year. And unless I critique what happened with Watanabe in prison, I cannot become a communist. Is that all ? When I met with the aboveground members, I used collection money to buy pants. Also, when I went down, I got a perm in Takasaki. Mori, Otsuki here is a second Toyama. Let's have her do a proper critique. Fin. We need to resolve the Toyama problem within the RLF. Anything else ? No one ? I heard Kaneko say "This is meaningless" during the critique of Ozaki. And Kaneko split from Yoshino. She's trying to claim the child in her belly is her own instead of the party's. Do you have any points for inspection ? I have thought about pushing Nagata aside and becoming a top leader in the party. What is your self-critique ? I criticize myself for trying to make use of the organization. You tried to use us, to make the organization your property. You're a Stalinist ! I sentence you to death. Teraoka was sentenced not to self-critique but to die. He was one of the highest members of the RLF. He supervised the raid on the gun shop and the executions of Haiki and Mukaiyama. I want each of us to reflect on the execution of Teraoka. Yamazaki, why were you standing behind everyone else during the execution ? Because I have the same issues and thought I might be executed too. What do you mean ? Honestly, I've also been calculating at times and used people. Iwata and Nakamura escaped ! Yamazaki. You're a Stalinist just like Teraoka. I sentence you to death ! Yamazaki, like Teraoka, received a "death sentence". Yamazaki was a member of the central army, and executed Plan M. His early education was in Germany and he attended Tokyo's famed Hibiya High School. Jan 20 : Jun Yamazaki, 21, executed Now, with the party endangered by those two anti-revolutionaries an even deeper critique will be necessary to become a revolutionary soldier. Kaneko, your self-critique lately seem to have weakened. Having a baby in your belly is no excuse to relax. What to you think of Mori ? I think he's someone with cute eyes. What the hell do you mean cute eyes ! You have no respect for the leader ! Do you think you can become a revolutionary like that ? You need a stronger critique. Otsuki, you said you had a relationship with that deserter Mukaiyama. It was to get information from that traitor... Hiding your relationship all along is a reactionary act ! I'm back. I'm Okusawa. Nice to meet you. Let's go for it. Jan 26 : Kasho Base, Gunma Prefecture Why didn't you stop the car like you were ordered ? I think mu judgment was correct in that case. Can't you follow party orders ? You must undergo critique and forge yourself anew ! Yamamoto quit his job and gave his retirement money to the RLF. He brought his wife and child to the mountain. Jan 30 : Junichi Yamamoto, 28, dead Otsuki had been a RLF activist longer than anyone but Nagata. She was the lover of Watanabe, who had been wounded in the Police Station attack. She died one week shy of her 24th birthday. The car is fixed. Oh, both of you went to public baths ? Yeah, we had some time while the car was being repaired. Just the two of you went on your own ? What were you thinking doing something like that. Critique yourself ! Was it bad to let Okusawa in ? That's not the problem. Why the fuck are you talking like that, like you're privileged ! Otsuki, Sagisaki and Kaneko Feb 4 : Michiyo Kaneko, 23, dead were known as "The Blossoming Trio of Yokohama University". Kaneko had been 8 months pregnant. The father of her child was Masakuni Yoshino. Can you break everything down at Haruna base, Sakaguchi ? I leave it to you from here. What happened ? Feb 6 : Yasuko Yamamoto escaped The cops might come. I'll fight. What are you going to do ? Gimme a gun. I'm fighting too ! Warn those breaking down Haruna base of the danger. We'll regroup at a cave on Mt. Myogi. It's on the map here. Feb 7 : Torayshi Meazawa escaped Feb 12 : Mt. Myogi If I could advance the revolution by dying I would gladly be killed ! Where is the revolution ? Why don't you self-critique ? Yamada, who chaired the Bund in Kyoto, was close to RAF chair Shioni. Debilitated, he convalesced in the hospital before returning as a soldier Feb 12, Takashi Yamada, 27, dead in Mori's RAF. Apart from the three defectors, everyone's moved to Mt Myogi. Yamada died there, in defeat. Listen, Sakaguchi. I'm leaving you for Mori. From the communist perspective it's the right thing to do. I understand. I've been relying on you for my thought and I want to break away. I critique myself for being married to the kind a woman. I couldn't bring to the mountain. I think being together with Nagata is the correct thing to do. If I don't think like this I'll never become a communist. I'll tell my wife as soon as possible. I have a kid too. My wife will cry but... Can you let me talk to Nagata alone for a minute ? I do love you. That kind of language is no longer permissible. What do you think of critique ? As the battle with the ruling powers intensifies we all must be communists to advance the revolution. I've lost track of the meaning of critique. I still don't know why Mori sentenced Teraoka to die. He was a factionalist, he might have escaped or informed. He lacked the qualifications to be a revolutionary. Fine, enough... I'm going back. You're ok, right ? Sakaguchi... It's Uegaki. They found out about Haruna base. We've gotta move quick. Even if we destroy the armed enemy, the unarmed enemy remains ! We must root out enemy toxins and our own impurities ! Revolutionary war is the antidote ! Run ! Run ! Your boots are ruined. I'll give you one of mine. If we live to meet again, give it back. I'll return it twice over. Goddammit it. Put the radio on. Rhis morning in the mountain of Gunma prefecture extremists Hiroko Nagata and Tsuneo Mori were arrested. She was a leading activist of the RLF. Police are searching the area for more members in hiding. Last night, two other suspected members were arrested. Their relation are under investigation. A planner of the gun shop raid last February Nagata was wanted by the police. According to police investigation, the RLF joined with the RAF, who had executed the Yodogo hijacking their movements have been under watch. I repeat... That's enough. Tomorrow morning we form two groups and break out. Alright, here we go. - See ya. - Be careful. Feb 19, 1972 Uegaki, Aoto, Terabayashi and Ito are reported by citizens and arrested Go, keep going. A little further. Damn. Don't stop. Don't stop ! Keep going, fast ! Don't give up. Don't give up. Get out of here. Motohisa, don't give up ! Keep going, don't look back ! A little more ! Mt. Asama, Nagano Prefecture Here, drink this. We're the revolutionary army. We're sorry, but we have to occupy this place. We intend you no harm. But please remain quiet. Is anyone else here ? We have some guests, but they're out skating. When will they be back ? Around 6. Anyone else ? My husband. Now, he's walking the dog. Pull up the tatami floor. I'm really sorry, but I have to tie you up. What do we do now ? For now, let's recover our balance. No objection. Hello ? Ma'am ? Are you there ? It's okay. This is the chief of police of Karuizawa. You students in the lodge are surrounded. There is no way to escape. Stop shooting, dammit ! Discard your guns and come out. The manager's wife has nothing to do with this. Let her go immediately. We are communists. Our goal is the overthrow of powers that oppress the masses for capitalists' profit. We're fighting for the revolution to end war and inequality in the world. Think of this as something like protesters seeking help from civilian homes to escape police during demonstrations. So, you are not a hostage. We are just borrowing this lodge from you. Let's hold a meeting to decide on a plan. We won't get anywhere like this. We should shoot our way out the siege. Impossible. The lodge is surrounded by many layers. i think shooting our way out is impossible too. If we take her, we might be able to escape. The cops can't make any careless blunders. Where could we go ? The cops will be after us forever. Let's take her hostage and demand the release of Mori and Nagata. The cops will never go for that. It's useless to launch some suicidal breakthrough missions. We fight an absolute war of resistance here. Is so, then we don't need her. We can release her right now. No way ! Her presence gives us an advantage to continue the resistance. We're fighting a towering enemy, our only option is to exploit their weakness. With their fake calls for democracy, superficially they have to uphold human life. So, her protection for now is our best tactic. It is permitted for his strategic confrontation. The plan is to fight a war of resistance while protecting her. Is everyone okay with that ? No objection ! We have enough food supplies to fight for about a month. We conserve from today, and make rice porridge. No objection. We are now in a war of position. Don't waste bullets. No objection. Ma'am, I'm very sorry. Haven't you used enough disturbance. Let the woman go ! I'll take her place if you want someone. Please come out. She's aged so much... Masakuni, if you"re there, please listen. I understand how you all feel. But aren't your actions contradicting your words ? Why did you quit university ? Wasn't it to sacrifice yourself for the good of society ? Release the woman ! That's true courage. Using our parents, damn. What dirty bastards ! My folks ran a flower shop where I grew up. It's the countryside they'll be ostracized for sure. My old man... He'll probably have to leave to company ? Nixon shakes bands with Chinese leaders. Later, with Henry Kissinger... Unbelievable... What'll happen to "anti-American patriotism" ? Masakuni, President Nixon's gone to China. We've entered a new age. So, throw out your guns and come out. The police say they won't shoot if you come out. Nagata and others were caught, but they're unhurt. Ma'am, are you injured ? I don't know how to apologize, I'm so sorry. Son, can you shoot at your own mother ? Sakaguchi, some strange guy is at the front door. Red Army members ! I'm an intellectual. I understand your feelings. I'm coming to replace the woman. I'm on your side. I've left my wife and kid behind and come from Niigata. So, please let me in. Go back ! Or I'll shoot ! Student in the lodge ! He's a civilian, not a police officer. Don't shoot. I repeat, he's not a police officer. Don't shoot. Feb 22 : Masaniko Tagawa, 30, bar owner is shot. He died a week later You are completely surrounded. Throw out your guns. Come out immediately. If you have any conscience, show us the woman. Stop shooting. Please come out with the hostage. Your parents are worried. Bring the hostage and come out. Your parents are worried. Bring the hostage and come out. Please ! Stop firing ! Reporting the latest news... The stalemate continues at Asama Mountain Lodge. The Nagano police plan to send in an armed squadron to break of the stalemate. Prior this, the Commissioner General has announced that they will continue to use discussion and persuasion... How's it going, Motohisa ? There's no movement. The power's cut. We've arrested all your peers. Throw out your guns and come out. It's just sounds. They're just playing a tape to rile us up. Sweetie ! Are yo ok ? You aren't cold ? Everyone's here, hang in there. We're all waiting for you to come back. Sis, everything's okay. Just stay patient a little longer. You'll get out soon, hang in there. All of you listen, please return my daughter. I think you've accomplished your goals. So, please, let mu daughter go. I want to set everyone at ease. Even just a minute, let me stand on the balcony. Even a phone call would be ok. Please, let me call. I just want to tell them I'm ok. The police already know you're ok. They're using bugs. They're having your family speak to manipulate public opinion. I know it's tough, but just bear with it. Be string. Because everyone's with you. I've done everything I could for you, you're my reason for living. We really understand you all want to make the world better. Event the police praise you. But if you hurt someone, you'll get hurt yourselves. We'll wait all day and tomorrow too. Just come out. Let's go home and eat a meal together. They're here ! You're completely surrounded. Give up your guns and come out. All your friends are arrested. Release the hostage and come out. Today during the operation, Bando ate more than his ration. This as a major violation or military codes during all-out war. Self-criticism is required. No, during the operation, a certain degree of autonomy is permitted. Provided this results in no serious effect, we should allow individual judgments on food supplies. Have we not sought our comrade's self-critiques in the name of revolutionary discipline ? That very cookie you ate is an anti-revolutionary symbol. This is wartime. We're fighting an enemy. Finally fighting the real enemy ! This is idiotic. There's no such thing as anti-revolutionary cookies. How can you face your comrades ? Criticize yourselves. Why have we come this far ? Point your guns at the enemy. We're comrades ! Bando, just criticize yourself and all will be fine. i criticize myself for eating snacks during duty. I will preserve revolutionary discipline from here on. i will strengthen group bonds. i will fight through to the end of the all-out war ! From their movements, it looks like the police will storm the lodge soon. I want to make your position clear. The ruling powers only know how to solve problems by applying more force. The battle is about to get much more severe. But we will never hurt you. This much I promise. We are here to fight the police. So we have no intention to use you as a hostage. We will not ask you to be our ally. But neither do we want you to go with the police. We want you to remain neutral. The police talk like they're concerned about your safety but we are their target. They won't think anything of sacrificing a civilian. Their real aim is to steal our social consciousness and our political goal of revolution. The police have know all along that you're safe. In order for us to fight the police, we want you to stay neutral. If they use the tactic of force, we will do everything we can to protect you. What do you mean by fighting with the police ? We mean to start a revolution. Revolution ? We will radically remake Japanese society. Even you don't think Japan is ok as is, do you ? Whatever happens, can you promise us neutrality ? Standing neither with the police nor with us. If you just remain the inn manager, that's fine. But I have one request. It this goes to trial, don't call me as a witness. Okay, I promise. Thank you. This is the chief of police Feb 28, 1972 with an announcement for the criminals in the lodge. It's not too late. Don't compound your crimes. Free the hostage, discard your guns and come out ! If you're willing to talk, stand with the hostage in a place where the police can see you, with a white rag. The police won't wait any longer ! I'll warn you again. The battle is here at last. It's either victory or death for us. If we die, we can probably meet in the other world. I'm glad the all-out war isn't tomorrow. Otherwise, our death anniversary would only come every 4 years. This is a message from the Chief of Police. You've ignored multiple warnings and continued with your brutal crimes. Soon, to save the hostage, officers will use force. This is your last chance. Discard your weapons and stand in a visible place with a white rag. We are going to use force now to rescue the hostage. Cease your useless resistance. We are going to use force now to rescue the hostage. I wish our comrades could have been here for this meal. Our battles inherits their spilled blood. Our debt... is to our fallen comrades. Let's pay back the debt. We'll pick up the pieces. What the fuck are you talking about ? Now of all times ? How are you gonna pick up the pieces ? Not one of us had any courage ! Not you either Not you either Sakaguchi ! Not you either ! You're a Stalinist ! I sentence you to death. You had no courage ! I had no courage... We had no courage ! Give up ! You bastard ! Get the guns ! Use the handcuffs !

No idea. Little plastic something or other. - Why? - I found it in my belly button. Hey, what are you doing? - Those sandwiches are for my mom. - You have a mom? I thought you were raised by sarcastic wolves. - Meat and cheese platter. - What time's your mom coming? Any minute now. She has her first date since the divorce. It's been like two years. That's a long time to go without any action. Not really. It's gonna be fine but just to make sure, I'm having her stay over here after her date. Unless she gets lucky. James's mom getting it on till the early dawn. I guess I deserve that for all the ribbing I've given you. I'm good. No more ribbing. For her pleasure. I've got more. Are you worried about your mom dating? Worried? Heck, no. I'm excited that my mom is dating in the age of medicine that can give a middle aged man a 24 hour wood monster. Sometimes it can last as long as three days. It can get you through the depressing holiday season, though. Mrs. Mckee! Welcome back, Mrs. Mckee. - Thank you. - Mother? Baby! I'm Tom. It's nice to see you again. Have we met? No, but I saw you when you came in, and now I see you again, which is nice. I'm not very good with small talk. And I'm Mark. I'm the newish roommate. Lovely to meet you. - How was your trip? - Great. I'm glad you're here, mom. Look at you. You made those little sandwiches that you make. You're such a good son. Well, just saying I love you... with meat. I miss that hair. You girls keep your hands off him. Oh, we'll try. It's not easy with hair like that. I know. OK, mom, there's people. Did James tell you? I'm down here for my first date in a long time. He mentioned it. He's very excited for you. I've been doing a lot of research, and I have tons of questions. Ask away. So tell me, what exactly is a landing strip, and should I have one? Landing strip. Well, that's... it's... Katie, Hope, wanna field this one? - I'm good. - Nope. Thank you. Where did you even hear such a term? You know I volunteer at the church where I work with troubled teens, and I heard some of the girls talking about it. There's a reason those teens are troubled, mom. {\pos(192,200)}I'm sorry, but I have a lot of questions. {\pos(192,200)}Everything seems so much more complicated now. It totally is. It's a jungle down there. {\pos(192,220)}Out there. It's a jungle out there. {\pos(192,200)}Can we just not talk about this? {\pos(192,200)}Sweetie, you're a grown man now. {\pos(192,200)}We should be able to talk openly about all kinds of stuff. {\pos(192,220)} - So can I still call them rubbers? - Oh my god. - We call them condoms now. - Can you please not enable her? {\pos(192,220)}She needs to know this stuff. {\pos(192,220)}You don't want a surprise baby brother. Relax, James, your mom is just curious. {\pos(192,220)}You have to get used to the fact that your mom is sexual being. I'm just glad to know it doesn't go away. It really doesn't. {\pos(192,220)}Getting older seems like fun. {\pos(192,220)}It's true. {\pos(192,220)}Sexual desire can actually increase with age. All right, I'm outta here. It's really nice to see you again. Hi there, Melinda. Oh, my. - How do I look? - Awesome. You're gonna give that date of yours a heart attack. Don't even joke about that. It's hyperbole when you're 20, but when you're 50, it's a very bad night in the E.R. Well, it's all very exciting. Can I tell you something? I have high Hopes for tonight. Oh, so do we. We just came in here to have a little girl talk. You know, like girls do. You see, Melinda, When a man loves a woman... Did James ask you to give me the talk? He sent a text. That's so sweet of him. I know how it all works. I'm just not sure how it works now. Great. Phew, OK. Hope just chime in here, I guess one big difference now is that women don't have to wait for the man. - Now we can make the first move. - We can? - There are a few classics. - Like the reapplying of lip gloss. I like the reapplying of lip gloss. It brings the guy's eyes to your mouth. Do you still have my revlon creme gloss? I know you're lying. It's my favorite. I don't have it. OK, I have it. Creme gloss thief. OK, what else? - What about the linger? - What's the linger? If you're into him, you wait for him to say something sweet, and then you put your hand on his shoulder like this. Then you just let it linger there. Or if he's super hot, and you know you want it, you can just let it linger a little closer to the zipper. Let's role play, shall we? I'm a guy, and I just said something that wasn't funny, but you should pretend it is. OK, let me get into character. Good, you're a sexy, desirable woman, and you know exactly what you want. You go get it, mama. Oh, Darren. That's so funny and charming and sweet. Very nice. I hope she's OK. I texted her but she responded with a photo of her steak. I do that too. That way, if you get hungry again later, you'll have a picture to remember the good times. Maybe they're at the airport watching the planes come in, on the landing strip. Have I been notice a little awkwardness between you and Mark lately? You think? I thought Mark was a nice, sweet guy, but then he kissed you and me, and then he kissed that girl at the bar. Maybe Mark's a he-ho. A he-ho? A he that's a ho. I did not see that coming. Do you think you like Mark? I don't know. I might. He-ho lover. Mom? You're home. Oh, thank god. No more dating for you. Nice to see you again. This time it makes sense. How'd it go? How did it go? She's back and she's OK. We got lucky this time. - Here, tell us everything. - Girl talk. Guys, get lost. Go to the bar and do what you do best. Watch hot chicks hit on James. Got it. - Can I, mom? - Oh, sure. - Drink responsibly, OK? - Will do. Again, glad you're OK. How was your date? It didn't go great. He took me to one of those korean barbecue places where you cook your own food. I did all the cooking and he spent the entire evening talking about himself If I had wanted that, I would've stayed married. I'm sorry. No, it's OK. {\I mean,} I couldn't expect my first date in ages to be a slam dunk. The important thing is that you got out there. {\It's}Good for you. Now I guess I just go back to Connecticut tomorrow... that big lonely house. Do you have to go back tomorrow? I don't have to. Then stay. I guess those troubled teens can wait. I mean, after all, they're already troubled. Right. OK, I'm staying. Great, and again, sorry about the date. No, it's OK. {\I mean,}It gave me the perfect excuse to hang out with you guys. - Night. - Night. Good night and don't worry about me, girls. I am perfectly fine. Just fine. Fine fine fine. What? She hasn't cleaned like this since the divorce. - What's wrong with cleaning? - Cleaning's good. Not that way she does it. It's not clean until it's behind the refrigerator clean. Come on, on three. One... Two, three! Why won't she leave? Hope and I may have indicated that she could stay as long as she wants. Close that. I don't want you to see me cry. Are you gonna be a while? Because i really have to go. It's okay, go ahead. And the cleaning... I can't clean anymore. Last night I had a dream I was a janitor, and I got in a fight with the plant manager In the boiler room, and he put on his rubber gloves, and I woke up screaming. It's been a long week. It's only been three days. It's getting to be a tad much. She said she wanted to alphabetize my shoes. Somebody do something, please. We can't just ask her to leave. At some point she's gonna start thinking it's her. It's if you're not ready, i understand. if you ever should be, uh, let-let me know. all right. (sighs) wow, i am really hungry. well, then let's, um, let's go to the blood bank and swipe some- some sugar cookies. oh, uh, you might want to give jane a sponge bath 'cause she had a little... accident. are you having a party? shh! shh!

(chuckles) well, i thought we agreed we wanted our wedding night to be perfect. yes, but actors want opening night to be perfect. that's why they rehearse. (chuckles) it'll be better this way. now... can i get you some more ice cream? not in that dress. hi. so i need to ask you something. ian, you know, from across the hall-- you met him. anyway... he sort of asked me out... on a date. i know you're thrown. i was thrown, too. but he's really nice, and... i could sort of use someone to talk to... who also talks back. the thing is... i'm sort of lonely... and the past six months have been really hard on me. so what i need is... i need to know that it's okay with you if i go out with him. because if it's not, i won't. in fact, i'd like nothing better than for you to just wake up right now and tell me not to go out with him. just wake up and tell me. wake up. please! all right. (sighs) i'll see you tomorrow. i love you. it is really just dinner. i'm just dropping off carlos, and then i'll be by to pick her up. okay, thanks, edie. xiao-mei's fine. crisis averted. no harm, no foul. how can you say that? you endangered the life of our baby today. don't you dare give me that attitude. you have no idea what i've been going through these past six months. (sighs) here we go. i have had to wait hand and foot on your mistress. i mean, imagine if the day after you found out about john rowland, you had to make his lunch and rub his feet. yeah, well, john rowland wasn't carrying our kid. forgive me for being concerned about our surrogate. xiao-mei is going to be fine. once that baby comes, her slate is wiped clean. she's gonna walk away, go off and live her american dream. me? i'm gonna be stuck, a single mother raising a child alone, haggling with lawyers on who gets the kid at christmas. my american dream is officially dead. i'm sorry. thank you. but just so you know, my dream hasn't exactly-- (tires screech, engine roars) okay, so we will see you saturday, and please pretend to be surprised. bye. you told someone else? bree, i thought the whole point of the party was to announce our engagement. i just can't help it. i like telling people. makes me feel... i don't know. makes me feel like i'm starting over. it feels good. feels good to me, too, though. hmm.

That empire was born from the ashes the barbarian conquests. Spanning 15 time zones ... and a sixth of the whole mass terrestrial world. First of all you need to consider its enormous size. After 400 years of chaos, The Russian Empire was forged ... by Czars of immense power, whose ambition ... was so colossal as the country itself. She wrote a their corresponding ... "I can not stop building. Building is like a disease. It's almost like alcoholism. " These visionaries led Russia the path of greatness ... adapting technologies ... conquering territories and building an empire. But the same will that supplied the thirst for eternal glory ... eventually devour the people themselves. Moscow, 1480 ... one czar decided achieve power unprecedented. Seu nome, Ivã III. For centuries, its people been under the heel ... the most brutal warriors Eurasia ... were from Mongolia, Tatars. But Ivan III resolved I would do everything to defeat them. No hesitation, tore down the treaty ligava to the Tartars ... and stated that Russia belonged to him. Now the future of the Russian people was at stake. If Ivan lost, all perish ... if he won, Russia would become the land of the czars. Ola, sou Peter Weller. They say that the history of Russia is the story of their cities. Russia, as we know, was born in the ninth century ... when several people began to gather ... around a single dominant clan, Kievan Rus called. The clan, who was from Ukraine, migrated here ... for a forest area surrounded by several rivers and lakes ... and started a small village, Call Novgorod ... meaning "New City". Oral tradition tells us that life in Novgorod ... was so chaotic, tumultuous people decided to call ... a Viking warrior, named Rurik, across the Baltic ... to come here and establish order. In Novgorod, From Kiev Rus clan flourished. Adopted the religion and technology neighbors, the Byzantines ... and built new cities as the population grew. One of the warehouses located in the fertile lands of the West ... Chamou-soi Moscou. Moscow, whose official year Established in 1147 is ... was a small wooden fort in a river ... chamava that Moscow "Moskva". Meanwhile clan members ... became known as Russians. However, without rulers, or defenses ... Russian cities were easy target for the invasion ... the most aggressive warriors, Tatars. In 1237, 120,000 Tatars Knights ... crossed the river Volga, to invade. The first Russians were no match for this strong cavalry. For nearly 24 months, the Tartars devastated Russia ... but for the authorities, the invasion was an opportunity ... to negotiate with the invaders and better rebuild the city. The rise of Moscow began in the fourteenth century ... from a political game clever, cunning and ruthless ... Part of the great princes Moscow ... who managed to ingratiate Tartar chiefs ... and collect taxes the other Russian principalities. Under the Tartar Protection, Moscow began to drain ... the resources of other cities. Territories annexed ended forming a single Muscovite state. However, leaders still had to pay ... the Tatar warriors hated. That all changed in 1462, with Ivan III. Ivan came to power resolved putting an end to the Tatar rule. Adotou the title of Great Prince all the Russian ... and devised a plan to defeat the Tartars. I think Ivan had all the necessary features ... Tsar to be a success. He was really great ... was ambitious, opportunistic, ruthless and awake. The new czar start by marriage ... and chose the princess of the empire ... who had given her religion and architecture, Byzantium. With this alliance, Ivan adopted the Byzantine symbol ... Double Headed Eagle and called Russia the Third Rome. In 1472 ... Tsar began build own legacy. Commissioned a cathedral, that would be the clear sign ... that Russia was a power to be recognized. The workers began working on the great work ... that same year. But Mother Nature had other ideas. In 1474, a small tremor earth shook Moscow. Two years of construction turned into a pile of rubble. Erected in rough stone, on fragile foundation ... was a likely crash. Ivan turned disaster to opportunity. At that point, Ivan III did what ... a shrewd ruler would ... searched for the best in the business. And the best architects this period ... the fifteenth century, were in Italy. Ivan thought Aristotle Fioravanti. Known and skilled master architect of Italy. But before rebuilding Cathedral of Moscow ... it was necessary to demolish what had been. In the first of several innovations, Fioravanti used military technology ... in the form of a ram to overthrow the ruins of the cathedral. This left the Muscovites awe ... which had taken months to erect, without success ... Fioravanti dropped three weeks. Then Fioravanti started new construction ... what is known today as Assumption Cathedral. started inspirational local churches in old ... but gave him touches Western technology. The result revolutionized Russian architecture. To start, the foundation. Instead of a trench filled with stones ... Typical constructions Russian medieval ... he robbed this ditch and dug large wooden stakes ... which is a much more stable environment to sustain a building ... so it does not crack or deformed ... and thus collapse. Innovations Fioravanti not stopped. Instead of stacking stones, as usual ... he chose desencontrar blocks for mooring ... in order to achieve stability. Finished walls, he turned ... the delicate and dangerous construction the vaulted ceilings. When you get the vault, the ceiling ... There is too much weight on the walls. So the third element he introduced ... were the iron screens. Were iron bars introduced in masonry ... and went to the vault. This serves as a way more supporting ... it ties the structure. Finally, instead of the round stone domes ... so common in churches ... he introduced bricks lighter and more robust ... teaching Russian as burn and become the new material. Thus, from the foundation to masonry walls ... and iron screens in the structure ... Fioravanti used a number of techniques ... were known in Italy ... but placed in the context Russian symbolism. Finished, the cathedral was 30m high. Was admirable and impressive. With this symbol of power ... Ivan was ready to challenge the Tatars. The response was immediate. Assembled a formidable army and attacked Moscow. Ivan already waiting for them, and the two armies fought battle ... near the Ugra river the 500km from Moscow. After months of struggle balanced ... Russians succeeded winning the Tartars. Ivan drove the oppressors ... who had subjugated the Russians for nearly three centuries. With this recorded legacy monuments in stone and bronze ... Ivan III became ... Ivan the Great. When he died in 1505, Ivan had created ... an independent Russia but there is an empire. this distinction Ivan would be with another ... whose absolute power and inhuman cruelty ... you would title Ivan the Terrible. At the end of the reign, in 1505, Ivan the Great ... had freed the Russian people subservience to the Tartars ... triplicate and the lands of Moscow. In other words, he spent 40 thousand km 2 ... to more than 120,000 km 2 ... which itself was already a great achievement. That's what gave him the title "the Great". But the Tartars were still a problem. While away from Moscow, its capital, Kazan ... stood in the way the achievements of Russia. Only grim determination the third grandson of Ivan ... deliver once Russia from the Tartars ... and turn into the empire. He would be known as Ivan the Terrible. I think the longest period Expansion isolated ... was that of Ivan the Terrible. The Moscow reign spanned the Volga regions of Europe ... and, later on, whole of Siberia. This great emperor had had ... an adolescence extremely disturbed. As a boy, he lost his father ... and witnessed the brutal fight the succession ... involving torture, execution and murder. Such atrocities would mark Ivan forever. A traumatic childhood of Ivan the Terrible ... Ivan produced a it was merciless. Even as a child, he tortured animals. He was cruel and sadistic. When he took power in 1547, he was convinced that God ... had entrusted with the governing Russia. He was the first Russian ruler ... to formally crowned as Tsar. Czar is a Russian word derived from Caesar. It is an imperial title. How Tsar Ivan found the perfect outlet for your rude and forceful intellect ... launching the first Russian offensive ... the famous siege of Kazan. First, he created an army almost 150 thousand ... including units artillery and engineering ... trained in tactics of Europe site. Engineers adapted the techniques for the Russian war machine. First of all, designed an ... to defend the Russian troops, the open plains of Eurasia. It was called "Gulai gorod". This, in fact, was a moving fortress. The gorod Gulai was done wood panel ... or wooden walls. They were real shells, made to defend ... the infantry artillery, called "strelietz" ... Russian sniper. The Russian infantry was within these mobile fortresses ... and used firearms, cannons, against cavalry. Yet another way was to use this against a besieged city, as Kazan. August 23, 1552, with armed and equipped army ... Ivan began his journey towards Kazan. It was very ingenious: The Russians were organized ... and raised forts wooden prefabricated ... and kept coming increasingly closer to Kazan. In other words, were cracking down. Entrenched on the outside ... Ivan forces launched an attack relentlessly ... from gorods Gulai 10m high ... with a rain of projectiles over the city walls. Killed many soldiers on the streets of Kazan ... with these mobile towers. Seeing their intact towers, Ivan commanded the officers ... they found a way to invade the city. A bold plan was created to dig a tunnel under the walls ... fill it with mine and cause an explosion. The September 30, they ascended one spark ... that would decide the fate of Kazan. The force of the explosion did stop the battle. This was the signal the rest of the Army. And all regiments the tsarist army ... started simultaneously the invasion of the fortress. After eight days of bloody battle, Kazan fell. Ivan became a winner and Russia an empire. It was a monumental feat ... because the taking of Kazan ... meant that Russia ... was incorporating the old Tatar lands ... to which they owed obligations. And Kazan opened the way ... to Russia expand into an empire. Opened the way to the south, to the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea ... and opened the way to the east, to Siberia. In 1555, to celebrate the victory, Ivan ordered ... a monument that would become the symbol of the Russian Empire. 250 00:16:00,826 -- 00:16:04,057 Today, it is known like Saint Basil's Cathedral. The Cathedral of Intercession ... we know like Saint Basil's Cathedral ... is based on the technology of the towers Brick, brought by the Italians ... and adapted by the Russians, to create church towers. Built almost entirely with bricks ... the cathedral was composed eight churches in one. Its design is geometric ... with churches around a central tower ... symbolizing the eight days Site of Kazan. In the 1580s ... was added feature most distinctive cathedral. The dome with onions actually has this form ... that image by boss that forms its base. She gets into a cylinder called "drum" ... and the cylinder, and the top, it extends ... rises and tapers to a point. This is the acebolado dome. The domes of St. Basil were absolutely unique. Each was built in different textures ... with metal plates hand painted. The structure is iron. If you take the coating, is a kind of cage ... which was squeezed to form the boss. The result was a visual stunning architectural ... never seen before in Russia. In 1553, the fields of Ivan were the largest in Europe ... and he was in the height of his power. But his increasing paranoia and iron fists that ruled ... were slowly strangling the empire itself. He plunged into a series costly wars ... and systematically eliminated anyone who dared to face it. The dark insanity of Ivan consumed the Russian people. No one felt safe, not even his family. Another reason to Ivan IV be called "the Terrible" ... is probably the end of his reign ... when he murdered his son, who tried to protect ... his pregnant wife Fury of Ivan. Ivan hit so angry at the daughter- she miscarried. When the son was heckles him, Ivan turned against him too ... and in a fit of anger killed him with one blow. With a single gesture insane ... Ivan destroyed the very line of succession. When the Czar died in 1584 ... the empire he was close to ruin. Shortly after Ivan came a time ... known as a difficult time. There was a civil war ... along with a war against foreign intervention. The Muscovy and Russia were very close ... losing their independence. A century after achieve independence ... Russia found itself the brink of disaster ... but soon a giant appear the stage of history ... amazing the world by founding a sparkling town in the middle of nowhere. 1696... a new czar came to power with a revolutionary plan ... to proceed with the task that Ivan the Terrible had begun ... and transform his nation in a modern empire. His name was Peter the Great. Peter the Great, was a person absolutely unique. It was a giant, both physically Average 2m ... as for your personality. He did not respect the tradition and conventions ... and was extremely curious regarding the news. The enormous size of Peter matched his ego. Around him there was always a whirlwind of activities. He assumed the duties a dozen men. He was truly a person extraordinary, out of the box. Peter spent adolescence in Moscow ... carousing with artisans and military in poor neighborhoods ... learning warfare tactics and technology. Peter not only I was excited ... with the European technology ... he was also very aware of the weakness ... and the backwardness of Russia compared to Europe. He wanted to change the situation. Early on, he went to Europe, Incognito ... and there he studied naval engineering with Dutch experts. He also learned the art Navigation in the English navy ... and saw all the riches that European empires ... were sucking their colonies. Thought it might be a good use to the natural resources of Russia. But he wanted was part of the game ... and he knew that for this, would you take to force ... their country of late medieval he was ... and into the light Western trade. When he returned to Russia, Peter wanted to transform his country ... in naval power not only for trade with European ... but also to compete as a military power. Peter turned to a strip of land ... 600 km north of Moscow, near the Baltic Sea ... the banks of the Neva River. With vanity a Roman god ... he imagined a city ... that Russia would map of Europe. And call this city St. Petersburg. A city that location have direct sea access to Europe. The only problem was that these lands belonged to Sweden ... but Peter did not flinch, and in 1700 ... threw her a withering attack seizing land by force. In 1703, was released the cornerstone of the city. The new capital that Peter had in mind ... should be a fortress, military and naval center ... and the window to Europe, by which Western ideas ... modern ideas will spread throughout the empire. Saint Petersburg was born at the expense much blood and war ... but for the humble people, the ambition of the Czar ... was a double-edged sword. Peter chose the place of the new city ... because of its access to the Baltic Sea, but this advantage was costly. For 5 months each year, the river and its surroundings froze ... and consequently had floods when it melted. The city building would be a great challenge. Then Peter appealed the natural resource ... that compensated all other in Russia ... cheap labor. The Russian people literally built St. Petersburg ... with his own hands. That swampy world ... almost no supply could reach. To secure the foundations of the fortress above the waters ... workers had to dig the earth with their hands ... and carry thousands of tons of clay ... in jackets and shirts. Everything had to be imported. Until the wood had the amount to be cut ... to descend by the current in bulk ... in order to stabilize foundations. There was no firm ground ... all large structures ... were founded on piles. To do so, engineers designed a pulley system ... to plunge thousands of cuttings in soft soil. They lifted the block and dropped, to enter the stake in the ground. And it was repeated dozens thousands of times, in Petersburg. Within five months, thousands of workers ... had erected the hexagonal walls and the bastions of the fortress ... standing behind me. At night, they returned home hungry and cold ... and as well as thousands came to, died by the thousands of diseases ... exhaustion or in floods. In 1708, an estimated 25 billion workers had died ... building this city, which gave him the nickname ... the "City of Bones". The statistics do not say how many died by the end of construction. But a historian nineteenth century said ... which, up to that point, no battle in the annals of military history ... had cost many lives as the number of workers ... who died building St. Petersburg. For Peter, the ends justify the means. In 1706, he launched the first warship ... the St. Petersburg yard ... first City industrial complex. Had shipbuilders residents ... manufacturers of candles and ropes, forges and an iron foundry. Russia now had a navy ... and the Tsar would gradually changing the face of the empire. In 1712, with the usual efficiency and rude ... Peter proceeded the greatest change. In one stroke single ... he made ? St. Petersburg Russia's capital. In an instant, the 300th anniversary Muscovite supremacy of ... collapsed to the ground. Moscow was stunned. Many Russians reacted to Peter ... as if he came from another planet. They did not understand. he imposed their strange ideas ... with the strength of a king and absolute autocrat. He inherited this of his predecessors ... but he knew very well how to use to their advantage. His vision of revolutionizing Russia ... was what guided his life. Nothing and no one escaped the effect ... This revolutionary process. Peter spared no expense to create a city from scratch ... but in 1714, St. Petersburg was still far ... be a European center as he expected. And the years of partying and excess already beginning to weigh on the Tsar. Without that iron will ... entire project threatened to crumble ... Russia and leave again, the edge of chaos. For decades, Peter the Great was focused on the task ... to transform Russia in a great empire ... with St. Petersburg as the capital ... with one exception, he continued to promote ... his legendary nights drink with friends ... but it did not diminish their wholesome Your amazing energy. He had beaten Sweden in the Great Northern War ... expanded the borders of Russia the Baltic to the Pacific. Built a European capital, created a navy ... schools did engineering and science ... and increased sevenfold trade of Russia. Militarily and politically, Russia was already an empire ... but still lacked an essential element: Prestige. In 1714 ... Peter scribbled the design of a palace ... he wanted to build on top of a headland ... 40km from St. Petersburg. His name would Peterhof. The palace was surrounded by more 200 acres of gardens ... graced by network and sparkling fountains ... hill and sources below. The work of this great design began in 1716. A large number of soldiers was summoned to dig the ditches ... where rush plumbing sources. In 1719, the Hydraulic engineers in the country ... began working in complicated system. The palace was at the top and high water pressures. It's fall, the force of gravity feeding the fountains. Taking advantage of the rugged terrain and water sources close ... workers built a system of 22km ... driven by gravity. The water was stored at elevated reservoirs ... where spurted by immense pipe ... coming down vertiginous 15m to the central source. The water accumulated sufficient force to squirt the height of 20m. The result was stunning. The sight impressed either, the palace was nicknamed ... Russian Versailles. But Peter did not have much time to enjoy this marvel. Having plunged into the icy water . to save a sailor ... the great Tsar fell ill and did not resist. At the end of the reign, he transformed a backward and poor country ... at an early empire. But the task was far of fulfilled. It would be an ambitious and tenacious German, Woman grandson of Peter ... that would complete the transformation St. Petersburg ... naval fortress the glittering capital ... we know today. Her name, Catherine the Great. Catherine took power, in 1762 ... after deposing her husband ... who had been Emperor for only six months. She knew how to master it easily. With the throne assured ... 3 487 00:30:42,106 -- 00:30:45,310 Catherine followed the footprints Peter the Great ... and transformed Russia in world power. As foreign and European ... she practically completed the process of Europeanization ... Peter had started at the beginning of the century. Actually Catherine considered herself ... legitimate heir of Peter. In the eighteenth century, to be a successful monarch ... it was necessary to expand the territory. And that Catherine did very well. Catherine annexed about 500 000 hectares of land in the country ... which generated vast wealth and expanded the empire ... for size Russia today. It was also necessary to control several reforms. And that's what she did. As a priority, Catherine used his immense wealth ... to modernize the city. She ombreou with great monarchs ... offering the immense humble people ... several hospitals, sanitary measures ... basic services and schools. During her reign, Catherine established rules of architecture ... for the construction of new cities And she built 216 new cities ... with planning where would the squares ... types of facade, the materials ... be used in the construction. But more beautiful design Catherine and prestigious ... was the renewal of the royal residence. The most extravagant monument to luxury and refinement ... the Winter Palace. This palace had three floors extending over 200m. On the outside, was decorated 200 columns with exquisite ... and over 150 statues marble. Inside, there were more than 500 rooms ... almost fourfold the White House. In the course of his reign, Catherine promoted ... a burst constructions as never seen before. With all this activity, the Tsarina turned ... Petersburg in an ostensive and proudly showcase ... culture, wealth and power the Russian Empire. She wrote to a correspondent ... "I can not stop building. It's like a disease, almost like alcoholism. " But construction was not the only defect in the czarina. Behind the doors the Winter Palace ... Catherine exercised another form of patronage ... caring for their numerous and generally young lovers. 534 00:33:29,607 -- 00:33:31,074 She worked hard. At night, wanted a male company. She had several lovers, whom he treated well and generously. She gave them lands and servants. But the luxuries of Catherine and its full power ... about to give humans like this ... symbolized the gulf between ... Russian worker elite. Although he was kind to his subjects, reforms of Catherine ... not quite contemplate the people. At the end of his reign in 1796 ... Russia was a superpower. The brightness of the country, however, brought glory and attracted enemies. In 1812, the most ambitious General of Europe ... undertook a march of conquest ... as had never been seen since the Roman Empire. And he chose Russia as the next victim. When he died in 1796, Catherine had added ... 500 000 hectares lands of the empire. Over 40 million people were now considered Russian. When his grandson, Alexander I, ascended the throne in 1801 ... Russia was important number the global chessboard. And that made ? it a coveted trophy ... for the most fearsome general Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1812, Tsar Alexander face a problem ... Russia has not seen since the Mongol invasion, six centuries before. Napoleon was a threat Handsome Russia. He had almost all of Europe ... under control. Napoleon invaded Russia with an army unprecedented ... Over 500,000 soldiers. The Russians, seeing they could not face them ... adopted the tactic of strategic retreat. burned all what was left behind ... to leave the intruders without food. when we finally arrived in Moscow ... Napoleon realized it had underestimated ... the will of steel the Russian people. Napoleon probably thought to invade Russia and take the capital, Alexandre accept negotiate with him. But no. He simply ignored, until the bitter cold ... Napoleon did understand there was nothing to gain ... staying in Moscow. And then he retreated. Forced to march by the same ... freezing and desolate landscape I already knew ... Unbeatable army of Napoleon was reduced to 10% of survivors. Unbeatable army of Napoleon was reduced to 10% of survivors. In 1883, the successor of Alexander commissioned a monument ... and installed in the center of the square Main St. Petersburg ... a symbol the Russian iron will. It was called the Alexander Column. The Alexander Column is on a granite base ... red granite. It is a monolith, a whole piece. Again, one czar forced subjects ... literally move mountains ... to erect a monument in honor of the empire. A battalion of workers ... extracted the base of the column ... one piece, and took her to St. Petersburg. It was a process that required three years and thousands of workers. In Petersburg, the engineers faced the daunting task ... lifting the monolith 700 tonnes and 25m high. They used a large rope that was bound to the column. Around, hoists had operated by several people. At a signal, all passed a system of pulleys ... so that the column was raised gradually ... is put in place prepared the base. Today, the column still think the huge pedestal. Its total height is 48m. Was perfectly designed and constructed. The fall of Napoleon eliminated the threats ... the status of Russia the largest continental empire. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the country average nearly 10,000 km ... Baltic Sea to the Pacific coast ... going to Alaska. A sixth covered of the entire planet Earth ... including 15 time zones. And with the new tsar, continue to grow. As Nicholas II knew Asia, because of their previous trips ... his first trips were for Asian nations ... He had a real conviction ... that the future of Russia was in the Pacific. But with a territory that was lost in the horizon ... the empire was in a danger being crushed by own weight. And the engineers find A solution ... such as Russia itself. Build the railway Trans-Siberian. Those who promoted the construction ... than would be the time the railroad longest in the world in 1890 ... had goals in mind ... economic and political. They wanted to open the Far East to Russian exports. At the same time, they wanted to establish Russian power in the east. The May 31, 1891 ... was seated the first rail a railroad ... that transpose the distance of 9.200km ... equivalent to the cross United States twice. equivalent to the cross United States twice. Imagine what it was built the railroad ... sincerely, leaves me impressed. The building has been divided into stages ... requiring thousands of workers, engineers, soldiers ... and even imprisoned, to perform the task. In a typical stretch the railroad through ... the Siberian steppes ... an initial team cleaned the ground ... and cut trees to make way for the railroad. After it was necessary to much work ... for excavation of sites where the tracks pass. When the earth was leveled ... rails were brought and settlers. The transport of supplies to the icy plains was a problem ... because the railroad did not exist. The rails were placed gradually ... and the workers wore the stretch ready to transport the steel from the west ... and continue to build, step by step. This process was repeated week after week, month after month ... during all the years in the late imperial period. The strenuous work was an ordeal for the Russians. It was very hard work, very hard. Imagine that desolate vastness ... which was transformed Rustic campgrounds ... with workers living in tents ... or, in some cases, shelters, working for months ... in stretches of railroad-supplied relatively limited ... in winter, they were subjected to a extremely low temperature ... in summer, the terrible heat that climate. In 1904, the railroad was ready. Russia had a communication line to the east ... and was free to try another achievement in Asia. The problem, of course, does that put Russia ... in conflict with Japan .. who had political objectives cheap and very similar. This conflict of objectives led a war between Russia and Japan In 1905, Russia went to war ... and suffered humiliating defeat the Japanese. That defeat fueled the flames ... growing resentment against the Tsar. In 1914, Tsar plunged the country in another war. A war that decimated much of the population. The First World War. After centuries building the largest empire of the world at your expense ... the people felt that reached to the breaking point. The March 15, 1917, the revolt broke out. Tsar Nicholas II was deposed. The nearly 500 years of absolute power Czars collapsed to the ground. The main factor in the disintegration the Russian Empire ... in 1917 ... was the collapse of the Tsarist regime. He was the emperor I served as the foundation ... to keep the empire together. The tsars had used the power to build beautiful cathedrals ... a city on swamps ... a railroad crossing a continent ... and sumptuous palaces that even today have no rivals. The history of the Russian Empire can be seen as a great achievement. At the same time, this achievement has taken its toll. In many respects, the empire was built at the expense of the Russian people. In 1917 the achievements of the empire ... be rewritten with a new system ... determined to improve the lives the humblest peasant. The powerful empire grew and subjects consumed increasingly ... to build the amusement palace of the rich ... and a hell for the rest. In the early twentieth century, the exploited poor and illiterate ... Russia got tired. Devastated by the Great War, incited by radical ... the people rose to demolish Russia for which they had fought so ... in a fierce revolution would replace ... a great empire on the other.

Sam's on his way in. Let's do that thing where we all pretend we don't know who he is, and he'll think he's crazy. It'll be really funny. Oh.! Here he comes. Here he comes. - Shh. Shh. - Hi, Sam! Oh, shoot. - Nice! - I got a promotion. - No way! - Hot panties! I'm in charge of a new youth-oriented low-cost airline. I gotta start working on it. I don't know. Kids flying airplanes? That can't end well. - But congratulations, I guess. - Hi, guys! Awesome shower. *[Man Rapping] [Sighs] You know the earrings that were on the sink? Yeah. Those are from my great-great grandmother. They fell in the toilet. But don't worry! I fished them out. They're almost totally as good as new. - Oh. Great! Still wet. - I'm so, so sorry. Jenna, do not apologize. You are a guest in this house. - If you want to murder us in our sleep, you do it. - [Jenna] That's sweet.! - Hey. Who's the new guy? - I'm Sam. This is Jenna, my B.F.F. From bartending school. - She's staying here for a couple of days. - Sammy. Sammy. Oh, you might want to be careful with this table 'cause maple's a soft wood. - Soft wood. - I'm working at the bar tonight. You guys should come out. Yeah, I could buy drinks for everyone courtesy of Saco Borosso Tequila. - Oh, you work for Saco Borosso? - Isn't that awesome? And she can party harder than anybody I've ever met. Well, except for Katie Couric. That bitch can drink. - Sam, come with us! - Oh, I can't. I've got a ton of work to do. Oh. I see. You only go out on the weekends. My dad does that. - Believe me, I go out a lot more... than that. - Whoo! I just... I gotta work. Hejust got a promotion. Come on! It'll be fun. - I'd love to, but I just can't. - Meow. Meow. What is that? Meow. [Gasps] It's a little pussycat.! What's your name, pussycat? Sam? Oh, does pussycat Sam have to work? Very funny. If I get done with my work, I'll be able to go out with you tomor... - [Meowing Continues] - [Beckman Whines] One drink. [Hooting, Shouting] - Yeah! - I'm gonna live forever! [Cheering] *[Man Singing] *[Continues] *[Ends] *[Man Singing In Spanish] [Laughing] So, you're a V.P. At Saco Borosso. Stands for "Veteran Partyer." I go around the bars to promote the brand. Basically, I get paid to drink. Wow. That sounds like an awesome job. Beats the balls off my last gig... analyst at Citibank. Hundred-hour work week with major douchers. - Not cool. - I couldn't take it, so I quit. And now I get paid to do this. - [Screams] - [People Cheering] I can't get overJenna. We started out learning how to cut limes together, and now she's so successful. She goes around to bars handing out free tequila to drunk people. I know.! I try not to getjealous. It's just human nature. - I need to make a move. - Aren't they looking for a new manager here? Ooh. I can be a manager. How hard could it be? - Can I get a vodka and tonic? - Just take the bottle. Yeah, I really think I could do it. - Hey! - Hey. Do you want to compete against me in the Saco Borosso Tequila Challenge? - What's that? - It's part of my job. You compete against me in 10 different challenges. You know, who can eat what when, who can stuff what where. The last one is a race in Cabo on a baby burro. Yeah! I could call in sick tomorrow and tell my boss I'm in a Mexican burro race. Come on! Just do the first one. It takes 10 minutes. Who can eat the most eggs? Those are eggs? I thought they were pig nards. Ten minutes, Sam. Let's do it. No way in hell. I gotta go home. I have a ton of work to do tonight. - Meow. - Oh! *[Man Singing Punk] [Man Whooping] - Let's go, Jenna! - Twenty-eight! - [Lizzy] Nineteen. - *[Continues] - Twenty-four eggs for Sam. - Thirty-three forJenna. - Time.! - I win! - Yea! Congratulations. You're a pig. - I want a rematch! - But if you lose again, I get to draw all over your body. - What? Why? We found that without consequences, some morons will do this over and over again. - No offense. - Sam, you need to go home and work. - One more, and then we'll leave. - Ready and go! Yeah! - [Continues] - [Sully] Let's go.! - Time! - I win! - Pig. - Lift up your shirt, loser. - [Whimpering] - Oh, Sammy. *[Continues] [Groans] [Both Moaning] You guys wanna go home or keep watching? - Keep watching. - Oh, that's gross. That's my brother. Wait a minute. All right. We can keep watching. *[Ends] As you may have heard, we lost a good man this morning. Marty Singer is dead. What? It probably had nothing to do with you taking his job. Stay strong. Moment of silence in his honor. I shouldn't have said anything aboutJack Air. I feel so bad. Thesis? Are you talking during a moment of silence? - L-I'm sorry, sir. I just... - Ooh, look at the cold stones on this kid. Every man in this room could drop dead, and he wouldn't bat an eyelash. And he's right. We don't have time for feelings. This is a business, not a homosexual coming-of-age story. Your presentation is in two days. It better boil my noodle. Oh, because of Marty, we all have to take a physical. If you fail the physical, you can't head a division. Could you remove your shirt, please? I'd be more comfortable if we just went over the shirt. - I'm a second base type of gal. - Remove your shirt. See, I did this challenge last night, and there was this girl. Um, actually she's the one that made me do this. Um, but, you know, she's super hot. - L-I can't stop thinking about her. - I don't care. Right. - [Beeping] - Whoa. Your cholesterol is 700. What? I know what happened. The challenge was an egg-eating contest... actually, two of them. - I think I ate, like, 40 eggs. - Oh, that's great. I can't pass you. No, no, no! You have to pass me. I just became head of a division! I promise you, I'm super healthy. I run every day. I eat lots of fruit and grains. - Yeah, you're just too much of a risk. - No, please, I'm begging you. It was a bar bet. This is not me. Well, you are 30 years younger than anyone else here. - I could retest you tomorrow. - Great idea! Let's do that. But in the meantime, keep a food journal and wear this pedometer. That way I can prove to the company you're healthy. 10,000 steps minimum. Hey, look at me! Look! I'm already at seven! [Sighs] What's wrong, Thesis? You look like someone stole your sucker. No. I was just partying last night, and it screwed up my physical. Oh, it's hard for you, Sam. Most of us here have already had our adventures and are settled down. But you're still having your adventures. And you should be. I know, but I also take my job very seriously. You're only young once, Sam. Live life, drink wine, eat breakfast off Steve McQueen's ass... while Ali MacGraw pours wax on herself in the corner. I don't know who they are, but I'm pretty sure I can't do all that and still have this job. Well, you can't be 24 again either. Hey, you're good at math. Wanna see how many times 24 goes into 48? - Twice. - *[Man Singing Pop] [Sully] All right. Here's the deal, Lizzy. If you're gonna manage a bar, you're gonna have to learn how to throw out angry drunks. I'm an angry drunk. Throw me out. - All right. I'll try. - [Clears Throat] Excuse me, sir, but I think it's time for you to go. I'm not goin' anywhere. Aah! God! Oh! Son of a... [Groans] - [Screams] - [Thudding] - Ah! - [Lizzy] Was that okay? - Yeah.! - Listen, Piper. I need your help. I wanna have fun and go out with Jenna tonight, but I gotta get my work done first. Are you sure she's the right kind of girl for you? I've never dated anyone like her. Maybe that's why it works. But not tonight. No matter what happens, just please let me get my work done. Got it. Keep you out of trouble. Ah, cool. - Hi. - Hey. Sammy, no. - [Continues] - This is gonna be trouble. Where am I? What the hell happened? You won the tequila challenge. - Welcome to Cabo. - [Donkey Brays] [Groans] *[Man Singing In Spanish] No, seriously, where are we? We're in Mexico. You wanna make out? - You know it. - [Moaning] Wait, wait, wait. What happened last night? You took the Saco Borosso Challenge. *[Man Singing Punk] - Whoa! - *[Continues] - Oh! - *[Continues] [Squealing] Oh, yeah. I was insane. Yes, you were. [Moans] Mmm! Oh, my God! My low-cost airline! I didn't do any work last night. Wait, wait, wait. Did I? - Whoo! - *[Man Singing Punk] *[Ends] - [Grunts] I gotta go. - No, stay! I have to hit a couple bars for work... but after, we can spend the rest of the day naked on the beach. I'd love to, but I have a huge presentation tomorrow. You know, they're hiring new V.P.'s. You should do it. We could travel all over the world together... have an awesome time makin' lots of money. - That sounds like a great idea. - Let's make this happen. Oh, that's big. Let's talk about it later tonight, okay? Sam. I had fun last night. Me too. *[Singing In Spanish Continues] - [Braying] - Come on! No, no, no, no, no! - Stupid ass! - [Brays] - [Phone Rings] - Darcy? - Hi, Sam. - Hey, can you cancel all my meetings? I'll have to do some serious juggling. At 11:00 a.m. You've got the guy installing Outlook Express on your computer... and at 6:00 p.m. You're buying cookies from Harry Manetti's daughter. - Is that all I have? - That and the nurse from the insurance company. - He's here for your re-exam. - Fudgeknocker! My pedometer! I need 10,000 steps. Can you stall him until I get there? I didn't go to acting school. I went to M.I.T. But my particle theory club did do a production of Man of La Mancha. The review gave it 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd stars. I'm sorry, sir. You'll have to shut off your cell phone. It disrupts the plane's communication system. Actually, I work for the airline, and that's not true. They're on two completely different frequencies, so it's fine. Thanks. I'm sorry. F.A.A. Rules. No cell phones after takeoff. Shut it off. - Just two more... - Shut it. - Sir, please take your seat. - I'm sorry. This is a health issue. Can't sit still for long periods of time. Deep vein thrombosis. - You understand. - Park it. Okay. [Rattling] *[Man Singing Rock] [Bell Dinging] [Pedometer Rattling Continues] *[Ends] Sir, what you're doing is a federal offense. What? Oh, no, no, no. I'm just working my pedometer. Let's go, Gangster's Paradise. Wh... What? No, no! I have to go to work! Please, no. Come on. Ah, sucklickers.! - *[Man Singing Blues] - [Door Lock Buzzing] - *[Ends] - Sammy! Yee-haw! [Yells, Groans] Was it horrible in there? Huh? They do stuff to you? Listen. You talk when you're ready. - Hey, where's Jenna? - I left her in Cabo. She's coming back tonight. - So, did you at least win the challenge? - Yeah. I won a new high-defTV. - Awesome! Plasma or L.C.D.? - L.C.D. - Oh, puke. Pass. - Yeah, I know. *[Man Singing Pop] Hey, Alfalfa. Wanna meet Stinky? - Oh, yeah. I had something in my hair. - Me too. So, how are the adventures going? Great! I met this girl, and she's really amazing. I think I might be making some life changes. You knocked her up. I told people you weren't gay. - What? - You ready for your big presentation? I will be. I'm gonna spend the day hammering out the details. Didn't you get the e-mail on Outlook Express? - No. They haven't installed it yet. - Let's go, Thesis! - Presentation time, and you're up. - Wh-What? Moved it up a day. Don't you read your Outlook Express? - L... - You better be good. This low-cost airline is the only thing keeping me from sucking on a gas nipple. Look, Sam. I know what it's like to finally lose your virginity. But you have to read your Outlook Express. L... Wha... All right, Thesis. Blow my pants off. Well, uh, the thing is my new e-mail software never got installed and... Thesis! Don't make me go dig up Marty. No, sir, no! Of course not. Uh... Are you wearing a brassiere, boy? What? D... No! No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No. This, um, is just drawn on. See, l-I lost this challenge, and this was one of the consequences. You're not one of those trans-operatives, are you? Like my son's friend Seth-Beth. your brothers so much. . . .otherwise I won't be able to live in this house without you. After me, where am I going? Where are you going! In a week will Mr. Iqbal come to take you with him! Can I come in brother Vishal? Look, Mr. Iqbal is here. Come Iqbal, come. You will live for a hundred years. . . .I remembered you, and you entered. Come sit. Mr. Iqbal, there is always a glow on the face. . . .of the groom before the marriage. Why are you so upset? What is the matter? Brother Vishal, my father is against the marriage. What? He is against the marriage. There is only a week left for the marriage. . . .and he is against it. That is not possible. But if you can explain brother Sikander. . . .then I will appease father anyhow. Sikander, what did Sikander do? Father found out everything about Sikander. My father says. . . .that he can never make a girl his daughter-in-law. . . .whose brother goes to the brothel. No, that's a lie. Sikander never goes to the brothel. He does brother Vishal, the entire city knows about it. There is a dancer named Zohra. Sikander spends all his evenings there. Zohra. Yes, Zohra, today that day has come in my life. . . .which I had never expected. I lived my life like the dead, and maybe that's why. . . .that's why my fate took pity on me. . . .and my Lord returned my love to me. It's all about fate, some people never hope. . . .and they get back their love. And some keep hoping. . . .and lose it even before they get it. Today is a very big day of your life Sikander. You will start a new life from today. Today you are going to step into a new world. Promise me something today. What? Starting from today, you will never come here. Yes, this is an infamous locality. Only those who are not. . . .afraid of their respect, come here. You are going to step in a respected world. And so, never come here even by mistake. I will not come here, but. . But I will not let you stay here Zohra. Where will I go? A prostitute's life begins at the brothel. . . .and ends at a brothel. There is no other place in this world for such a woman. No Zohra, there is another world out there. . You will have to come out of it. No Sikander, no. If you will be happy, then I will feel happy too. I will feel that I have been blessed. Yes, if there is a musical program in your marriage. . . .then don't call anyone else, call Zohra. You will do a favor to me, a very big favor. Zohra.. - Now you go. It's time for my prayers. May Lord always keep you happy. Some new scapegoat has come. Listen brother, where does Zohra live? She lives upstairs, upstairs. Thank you. Now even Mr. Lawyer has come to Zohra. Why won't he come? Friends have equal rights. Whether it is wealth or lover. First learn how to open the dagger. . . .then try to use it. Practice it for a month. When you will know how o open it, then call me. Here. Yes, so what was I asking you? Where does Zohra live? Where does she live? Come, I will take you to her myself. Yes, come on. Yes, what is it? Is your name Zohra? Yes. - I am Sikander's friend, Vishal. So you are Mr. Vsihal, come, come, come in. Take a seat. I have not come here to sit. How much money do you want to leave Sikander. How much money can you give me? 5000, 10, OOO, 20, OOO, 50, OOO! I will earn all my life, and give it to you.. . .tell me, do you accept it? I wouldn't even sell Sikander's photograph for that amount. . . .and you have come to buy Sikander. Your words will not affect me. I know that all this is just an act. Just a delusion. Who is not a fraud in your society? Show me one person in this world who is not a fraud. A person always tries to show what he is not. A defamed person tries to show his respect. A coward tries to show how brave he is. There is greed in the heart, and he tries to show his love. And sometimes there is love in the heart. . . .and one tries to show hatred from the face. Delusion is a part of humans, Mr. Vishal. The Lord has used delusion to make humans. Wow, very nice. If I want, I can answer all of your questions Zohra. But I have not come here to play games. You can play your game. I have just come to say that. . . .If Sikander does not stop coming here. . . .then his sister's house will be ruined. . . .even before it settles. She will never be able to prosper. . . .because, your name is attached with him. At least people like us. . . .are worthy enough to make someone's life prosperous. r Rest assured Mr. Vishal until Zohra is alive. . . .the doors of this house will never open for Sikander. I promise you that. You love him a lot, don't you Zohra? Even I love him a lot. Thank you. Son, because of you, after a long time, happiness. . . .has returned in this house. Today after so many years, Kamna is celebrating her birthday. Yes.. where is she? - She is in Hotel Sangam. She was very happy, was saying that she is waiting for someone. She was praising you a lot. She will be celebrating her birthday there. I will take your leave now. Okay. "Love. " "Heart. " "Hey man, today is the music day tonight. . . .then why don't you come and join the lovers' paradise?"

I took care of you as a friend. . . .and you lashed back at me like a snake. Me. - Yes, you! You! When you were starving. . . .when you used to wander around in bars and streets. . . .like an orphan! I brought you from there. I made you capable of living amongst humans. So that you can laugh aloud with them, dance along with them. I gave you this laughter as alms. And today, today you laughed at my love. Your love, what are you saying Sikander? From his childhood till today. . . .Sikander lived because of this love. Otherwise what else is there in his life? But today, you snatched this too. Sikander is not going to live anymore. . . .but he will not let you live too. No, Sikander, no, Don't do it Sikander. Yes, Vishal. Vishal ! What did you do my friend? What did you do? I always kept asking you tell me what sorrow you have. I always wanted you to be happy. I always wanted you to smile. But you never told me friend. And you told me when. . If you would have told me when I was alive, then. . No Vishal, no Vishal. Vishal ! You.. killed my Vishal. Why? Because I don't love you. I never loved you! I love Vishal and I will always love Vishal! You say, that you love me. . . .then give me, give me my love back! Give me my Vishal back, Give me my Vishal back, otherwise I will kill myself! No madam! No madam! No! What happened sir? Those people? Where did those people go? They left long time back, there was no one here. No one. "People get envious on seeing us." "They envy us, they regret it." "O my love, wherever you live, that's where I'll die. ." Good night. - Good night. Good night. Who is it? Zohra. Open the door. It's me, Sikander. Sikander. Oh God! What kind of test is this? Who Sikander? Many Sikanders have come and gone to Zohra's brothel. I don't know any Sikander. No Zohra, don't say that. Only you have recognized Sikander, no one else. If you refuse from recognizing Sikander. . . .then where will he go? Zohra, tonight has proven to be very tragic for me. Help me today. Tonight I have lost everything. I have lost everything. Everything has been snatched from me. I want your support. Zohra don't be so cruel. Zohra ! Look Zohra I have suffered a lot. . . .I will make the world suffer too. No! Open the door or I will break it down. No! - Zohra! Open the door! Zohra! I say open the door! Zohra open the door! Zohra ! Zohra open the door! Zohra ! Zohra. Zohra. Zohra. What happened? Zohra. What happened? I swallowed the diamond. No Zohra. There is a lot of pain in my life. I swallowed the poison for the last time to die. Why? Why Zohra? I should have swallowed the poison, why you? I kept the promise I had made to someone. If I had not swallowed the poison. . . .then your sister's life would have been ruined. The peace that I never got while alive. . . .I am getting while dying. I couldn't live without you. . . .and I couldn't become yours while alive. Now I don't have. . .. any regrets with life. No complaints. I am breathing my last. I am breathing. . . .my last in your arms. Zohra. Now life is over. - Zohra. Zohra. Sage! Sage, you used to say accept sorrows. . . .fate will be at your feet. You will be the master of your destiny. Take a look at her and tell me.. . .how many sorrows do I still have to face? How long will I keep laughing this false laughter? How long will I keep laughing at my life. I never found happiness, now I am tired of sorrows too, sage. Now what is left for me? Tell me sage, tell me. Say something sage, why don't you say something? Sage. Sage. No, no that's a lie, that's a lie Zohra cannot die. Say that it's a lie, say it! Dilawar, I have seen her dying in Sikander's arms. I have seen him going in the graveyard. Listen to this, tomorrow is Sikander's sister's marriage. No, no! Now there won't be any marriage. Now there will be only destruction. I will bury Sikander, his sister. . . .his entire family in the grave next to Zohra. Don't be a fool Dilawar, police are searching everywhere for you. Police! How can the police harm me now! Zohra is dead, I will die too. But I will not die alone friend. I swear on Allah I will not die alone! Okay Dilawar, let us do something. . . .so that both of our work gets done together. You want to take revenge from Sikander. And I want to take revenge from his friend the lawyer as well. He snatched my daughter from me. Dilawar, you cannot go to Sikander's house. . . .because the police are after you. I cannot go to the lawyer, because my daughter is there. I will bring you Sikander's sister. . . .you bring the lawyers daughter for me. Do you agree? Good. 'You will take care of your sister, won't you? ' 'Remember your promise. ' 'I am leaving her on your and Allah's responsibility# Vishal. What is the matter? I.. I saw a very strange dream Vishal. I saw a bit of happiness, I saw the one who stole my happiness. Then I killed him. I saw someone dying. I saw so many things in my short dream. You are afraid of your dream, come in. No. Vishal. Will you listen to me? - Yes tell me, of course I will. Get married my friend. Marriage. What connection does your dream have with my marriage? Connection, it is connected with my dream, Vishal. With my dream. Tomorrow after Mehroo leaves, this house will be very lonely. I wanted that before Mehroo leaves. . . .someone should come in this house. Then why don't you get married? Your madam has agreed now too. No Vishal, that was just a dream. People dream when they are sleep. . . .I was dreaming with my open eyes. What do you mean? I kept seeing a girl in my dreams. . . .I kept calling her madam. I kept loving her, but the truth was that. . . .that there is no madam, no love there is just a image. And you cannot marry an image Vishal. What are you saying? For so many days you just kept fooling me. Kept fooling you or myself, no one knows that. You are hiding something from me. Look Vishal, you did not tell me anything about yourself but I know. You marry Kamna. - Kamna. It is true Sikander, that we love each other a lot. But Mr. Ramanath.. - I will tell Mr. Ramanath. But, why are you in a hurry for my marriage? Look Vishal, till today I did not ask for anything from you. I ask today, get married my friend. Make this house prosperous. . . .I will never ask for anything else ever again. I beg of you. - What are you doing? Brother, you are not human, but an angel. Tomorrow, I am ready for this relation son. Actually I wanted to talk to you myself. But how can all this be done tomorrow? Everything will be done sir, everything will be done. All you need to do is say yes. But son.. - Just say yes sir, I will take care of the rest. Okay son, if you want that then how can I say no? What happened? Sikander, I could not sleep the whole night. - Why? Why did you make me write that letter? Letter? Just to make you believe that even I have a heart. . . .and someone loves me too. Who loves you? Tell me too. Mother, you take care of him I will just come. Here. What? But Vishal had written that letter. Why have you come to take it back? That.. Vishal had written that letter. . . .but it was not for you, but. . But? - He had written it for me, madam. For you. - Yes, madam, I am illiterate. . . .I don't know how to read and write. . . .that's why Vishal had written it. But he does not know who I had written that letter for. I ask for forgiveness for my mistake, madam. That's why I want you to give me my letter. And please never tell Vishal about this. He is my friend, he loves me more than his life. If he ever finds out, who knows what he might do? No madam, no. Please don't do that, I am very unlucky. No. you are not unlucky, but you are an angel. Let me touch your feet once. Madam. Madam. Madam! Madam, open the door! Madam! Tell me where Dilawar is! Tell me! Leave me! Leave me! Mehroo. Mehroo! Vishal ! Vishal ! What happened mother? - Some people abducted Mehroo! Abducted her. What? Wait! Wait! What happened? Pyare Lal, some goons have abducted Mehroo. The wedding procession is about to arrive. The respect of the house is in your hands now. I will go get Mehroo, don't tell Sikander anything. - Yes. Leave me. Leave me, leave me. Okay, so you have come here for her. I have seen many scoundrels, but not like you. All your life she was your beloved. - No! And then when you got fed up with her. . . .you handed her over to your friend. Get up. Get up. Brother, save me! Brother! Pyare Lal, what will happen now? The groom has arrived too. Doctor whatever will happen, will be for the good. Ramnath is in a bad state, you take care here. . And I will take care there. Good. Oh God, what will happen now? I will not spare him. - No Ram! His friends have abducted your sister too. - What? Brother Vishal has gone after them. Ram, you take Kamna back I will take care of him. No, no. - Tell me, where is Mehroo? Tell me, where is Mehroo? Tell me, where is Mehroo? I will bury Mehroo next to my Zohra. Come on. Why did you stop? Come on, move! Sikander cannot be seen anywhere. . . .what is the matter? Maybe he must be busy in some work. - Yes. Kamna, dear, dear. - Father. How are you daughter? Where is Sikander? Brother! Brother! Let go of me! What is the matter? Priest, go in and get the signatures on the document. Go. Priest, just two minutes. She will just come. Mother, Mehroo is here. Mother. Mehroo. Sikander, I had promised you that I will kill you. I killed you. But even you killed me friend. I don't regret dying. I am dying by a man's hand. You laugh, even I will laugh. Sikander, you really are a Sikander. Dilawar salutes you friend. You go, even I am going. I have to go to the police station. If I don't, they will say that Dilawar did not keep his promise. If you are so brave then go, go to my Zohra's grave first. . . .and ask for forgiveness. Maybe she will find some peace. That at least somebody loved her in this world. What? You didn't love Zohra? Sikander! Allah, I made a very big mistake Allah. Allah, why did I make this mistake Allah? I made a very big mistake Allah. Lord! Mehroo! Vishal! Vishal ! I am sorry for the delay. Come Vishal, come. Sit, sit. Where is Sikander? I am here Vishal. Priest, start. Mehroo! - Brother! Are you alright? Iqbal ! - Yes? I am handing over a piece of my heart to you. . . .take care of her. Stand up for the nuptial rounds. Now you are husband and wife. No! Sikander, Sikander! Blood ! Nothing, I am fine. Who did this to you? Tell me, who did this to you? - I will tell you! - No! Dilawar had abducted me. . . .Sikander saved me and brought me here. If it hadn't been for Sikander. . . .then I wouldn't have been alive. Stop, stop it madam. Madam. Is.. is Kamna your madam whom you. . No. - Yes! Yes, Vishal. I am his madam. But I didn't tell you. No, no. Today I regret my mistake. Vishal, Sikander loved me. And I didn't give him anything but hatred. Sikander what have you done? It was my mistake friend. She hated me all her life. . . .and I thought of it was love. You did not think I was capable of your friendship. I always kept asking you, but you never told me. You did not trust me. You should have told me once. I would have sacrificed everything for my friendship. It's good that I didn't. Had I opened my mouth, this home would have been ruined. You saved my house from being ruined. Today, because of you, there is light in my house. Because of you I could fulfill the pledge given to mother. The goal of my life has been fulfilled. I am going today. But when I meet God. . ..I will tell Him to give me a friend like you in every life. No, Sikander. You can't go, leaving all of us. Don't cry Vishal, laugh. Laugh my friend. If you laugh in sorrows. . . .then you will enjoy happiness. Laugh aloud Vishal. Forget happiness, accept sorrows. . . .fate will be at your feet. You.. you will be the master of your destiny my friend. I am just Sikander my friend. But you.. you, you will be the master of destiny. Master of destiny. Vishal. Sing that song. That song. - Yes. Sing that tune for me. "Life is a traitor. . . .one day it will betray you." "Life is a traitor. . . .one day it will betray you." "Death is our beloved." "Death is our beloved. . . .it will take you along." "The one who lives on after death. . . .he will mock at the world." "The master of destiny. " "The master of destiny, my dear." Brother! - Where the hell is Beeku? - Sir, may I carry your luggage? - You won't be able to. - I will, sir. Or don't pay me. Go away! Why are you harassing me? Madam, please tell him. I've been starving since two days. Let him carry it, daddy. The poor boy's been starving since two days. - Then give him 50 paise. - I won't accept alms; I'll work. - Let me carry it, sir. - You'll work? Beeku, until you are unwell, arrange for a servant for us. Sir, please employ me. What nonsense! How can you take care of such a big house? He will. I'll look after other things. He'll do the petty chores. - Will you? - Yes, sir. I'll get up in the morning and sweep the house, make tea for you heat milk for madam, then heat water for your bath... And even massage your feet at night and then... - Enough! - Employ him, daddy. I can, but if he also turns out to be the same, then... - How, daddy? - Nothing... Go and do your work. But do your work honestly. What happened? Hey! You broke my doll? Madam, I didn't do it intentionally. Madam, don't cry. I'll get you a doll exactly like this one. From where will you get it? This was my mother's memento. I will bring one for you. But don't tell master about it. Or I will lose my job. I've found this home with great difficulty. This home may be snatched away from me. I have nobody in this world. - I beg of you... - What are you doing? ...don't tell master. - All right, I won't. - Will you bring a similar doll? - Yes, madam. I surely will. It is 11 O'clock. Go to sleep, dear. Hey, boy! That's enough. Go and sleep outside. Daddy, let him sleep here. It is very cold outside. Don't argue for everything, dear. Go to sleep. Hey, go and sleep outside. - Take this, madam. - Have you had breakfast? Not yet. You eat, I'll have it later. - No. Have breakfast with me. - Me? How can I sit with you? - Why not? - A servant can't sit with a master. Sit and have breakfast with me... Not here... there. Today, I shall prepare breakfast for you with my hands. Hey, you are crying? Tell me, why are you crying? Till today, I never cried even after being beaten up by people. But today, I cry, looking at your love. What's there to cry about? Take this. Do you know, when I used to cry, my mother used to play a tune on the piano. Today, I'll play the same tune for you. Come. Impertinent boy! Where had you taken my daughter? Nowhere, sir. I'd taken madam for a stroll. Daddy, I had asked him to. You should stay away from such people. He is amongst those lowly people who come as servants and leave, ruining a home. Don't you dare come here! - But, sir... - Get out! If you step into my house again, I'll break your legs! Come on! - Hey, where are you going in? - To return madam's shawl. They have sold this place and left for Bombay. Hurry, or the train will leave. Madam's gone? Hey, this one is like madam's doll. Sir, I beg of you. I shall work for you forever. Give me that doll. - Give me that doll. - Throw him out! This is madam! Madam! Sir! Madam! Why don't you see and walk? Do you want to commit suicide? - Sir! Madam! - Sir? Madam? Who are they? - Who went in the car. - Who are they? I used to work for them. - Why will they hear your voice? - Why not? Only the rich have the right to beckon in this world. The rich don't stop, hearing the voice of poor people like us. Hey, your bag! Thief! Thief! The rogues ran away! Here's your bag. Why did you do this to yourself for a mere bag of mine? So what? You, too, have saved my life; I saved your bag. You talk very well. What is your name? I have many names. Some call me a swine; some, a rogue and yet others, a bastard. What rubbish! What are you saying? I swear. People have addressed me with so many names that I have forgotten my real name. - Where are your parents? - I have nobody. - Brothers and sisters? - Nobody. Then where do you live? Who keeps people like me? I live on the roads. Today, a rich man said, we are worms of the gutter who are born in the streets and die there, too. I will also die here. No, son. Don't speak that way. Don't. From today, I am your mother. - Mother? - Yes, son. I am your mother. No, mother. Don't say that, or I shall cry. Abuse me or hit me... But don't say this. I have no mother. I just don't. No, son. From today, I am your mother. I also had a son like you. He, too, was run over and killed under the car of a rich man. Destiny snatched him away from me. But... but today, I have found my son. You have no name, right? I will christen you with my son's name. From today... from today, your name is Sikander. - Yes. - What's wrong, mother? I think, this pain will kill me. Don't worry. Place your hand on my shoulder. Everything will be okay. Come, mother. - What's it, mother? - Come here, dear. Look, who has come. - Who is he? - Your brother. - My brother? - Yes. - He is dead. No, dear. Don't say that. God has sent him back. You had become alone. So he will stay with you from today. Sikander, will you stay with your sister? Yes, mother. I think, God took pity on me. He gave me a mother, a sister. What else could I want? - Mother, I'll be back soon. - Where are you going? To the temple to pray. Just in case anyone casts evil eyes and all this be snatched from me. Hey, you? How did you get here? Madam, I came here searching for all of you. - Do you know her? - Yes, mother. She is the madam, I had spoken to you about. She's very nice. She fed me with her hands and when I was shivering with cold, she draped her shawl around me. And madam, she is my mother. I had no name till yesterday. Even you didn't know my name. She has given me a name. ...Sikander. It's a nice name. Listen, Sikander. It's my birthday today. - Do come in the evening. - I will, madam. Remember, you had a doll which I had broken. I saw a similar doll. And I shall give it to you as a present. You? You followed us from Simla till Bombay! Get out! Get out! Or I'll call the police and have you locked up in jail. No, sir. He didn't come on his own. I brought him here. You? Why have you brought him here? What does he mean to you? - He is my son. - He? ! He, a vagabond roaming on the streets who had nobody until yesterday. How is he your son today? Sir, I... I have adopted him. Fatima, I've always considered you a family member and not a servant. I have respected you. And I'd want you to maintain our honour. I strongly despise such boys. Take him away. And listen, he must never come to this house again. Alright, sir. He will never come here. - Hey! Where are you barging in? - Madam... Master had forbidden you from coming here. Get lost! You were forbidden! Go away! Today I'll give you a present that will leave you thrilled. But before that, you give me a present. What? Sing the song today which your mother used to. "My companion, I can not live without you." "I can not live without you." "My companion, I can not live without you." "I can not live without you." "In the flowers and the buds, or in my dreams." "In the flowers and the buds, or in my dreams." "There is nothing without you." "I can not live without you." "My companion, I can not live without you." "I can not live without you." "Every heartbeat longs for you." "My breath is filled with your fragrance." "From the earth to the sky, I can see only you." "This love should never break." "This love should never break." "Never get upset with me." "Never leave me alone." "I can not live without you." "My companion, I can not live without you." "I can not live without you." "I can not live without you." "I can not live without you." - What happened? - I remembered mummy. Don't do this, dear. - Salutations, sir. - Park the car. Madam, where are you? I brought the doll for you. Madam, they wouldn't let me in. Because I am poor. Is it a sin to be poor? Scoundrel! You? What are you hiding? - Nothing... Nothing! - Nothing? - What's this? - Thief! Scoundrel! No, I am not a thief. I have not stolen. - You have not? - Let me go! - What's the matter, sir? - I'll kill this thief! - He is not a thief. - Then what is he? What's he doing in my house, despite being told not to enter it? - Why did you go upstairs? - I came to give madam a gift. A gift? And you? The most expensive gift which I had brought for Kamna, he was going to steal. Did you see, how the snake you were pitying was looting your home? Which is why I asked you to stay away from him. I'll tell you today, why I despise such boys. Your mother took pity on a similar rogue like him. She brought him home. And loved him as much as a mother would love her son. But that son stole all her jewellery and stabbed her in the stomach. Even today, when I remember that night... Get out! You are a thief, a killer! Never come to my house again! No, madam. I did not steal. You also consider me a thief? Get out! Enough, sir! Don't you dare touch my son! Then go away! And take your son away, too. I will certainly leave. God's world is very big. I shall never come to your door again! There is no need to shout. A rich man's car had run over a son of mine. But now... I won't let my other son be a victim of the affluence of a rich man. Let's go, son. - Mother, I am going. - Are you leaving your mother? Yes, mother. I'm a cursed boy. Wherever I go... Go on, son. I don't want misfortune to befall you because of me. Who says you are cursed Your mother's blessings are with you. If the Almighty wishes, then my Sikander will touch the skies someday. The ones who called him a thief, insulted him and threw him out of their homes will someday, stand at his own house and seek forgiveness. - This is my blessing... - Mother! What happened? The pain... it's terrible, son. Mehru, sit with mother and take care of her. I'll fetch a doctor... No, son! Don't leave me! Don't! - You... You are my son, right? - Yes, I am your son. - And... and she? - She is my sister, Mehru. You will take care of your sister, won't you? Yes. I'll even put my life at stake for her. Remember your promise. I am leaving her in God's care and your custody. Take care of her. Say something, mother. On whose grave are you crying, children? Our mother is dead. Look! Look all around you. The corpses here are all people's mothers, sisters and brothers. In this silence, everybody is buried below heaps of mud. Who can escape death? If it is their turn today, it will be our turn tomorrow. Remember what this holy man says, son. If you want to really enjoy life, then play with death. If you smile in joy, then laugh in sorrow. Your outlook to life will change. Alive are those who confront death. Worse than a corpse are those, who fear death. Reject happiness; embrace sorrow. Happiness is unfaithful. It is there for some days and then leaves. But sorrow remains with you. Wipe your tears! Embrace sorrow. Destiny will be at your feet and you'll be its king! Laugh... Laugh! Laugh, son! Laugh more! More! "Everyone comes in the world crying." "Everyone comes in the world crying." "But the one who dies with a smile..." ...he's the master of his destiny." "He will be called, the master of his destiny." "Everyone comes in the world crying." "But the one who dies with a smile..." "What was Alexander who won the over the whole world with cruelty?" "What was Alexander who won the over the whole world with cruelty?" "The one who wins over hearts with love, he is the greatest." "The one who understands this meaning of love he's the master of his destiny." "He will be called, the master of his destiny." "Everyone comes in the world crying." "But the one who dies with a smile..." "Life is a betrayer, it will leave you one day." "Life is a betrayer, it will leave you one day." "Death is our beloved it will take us along." "The one who teach this to the world with his death he's the master of his destiny." "He will be called, the master of his destiny." "Everyone comes in the world crying." "But the one who dies with a smile he's the master of his destiny." "He will be called, the master of his destiny." Move back! Constable, move all of them behind! - Those, too are smuggled goods. - Please wait. - Let Mr. Sikander arrive. - Quiet! Take him, too. - Inspector, there comes Sikander. - Please wait for a while. Let Mr. Sikander come. - Just wait. - Paul has put us in such a loss. Goga, come ahead. Why fear? ...I'm here. So are the police. What's the matter? Why are these goods being seized? They are smuggled goods. Yes, they are. Not only these, but all the goods here are smuggled. But I don't smuggle anything. They do. The police seize those goods and auctions them. - I buy them and get it here. - Inspector, he is lying. He is only trying to save his contraband. - Hey Shambu! Get the receipts. - In a minute, Mr. Sikander. These are the receipts from the custom office. See it for yourself. I cannot read or write. What is the need for this 15 year old receipt? It is very necessary, Inspector. A few memories, a few old receipts are the only wealth of my life. The story of my childhood is written on these pieces. A story which... this man had started. 15 years ago from today. Remember, Paul? - You've come? - Yes. Eat some food. I can't cook. Eat it the way it is. Don't worry. It will get cooked once it's inside the stomach. Brother, today is your festival, 'Raksha Bandhan', isn't it? Oh yes! Won't you tie a 'rakhi' on me? - I want to, but it's expensive. - Don't worry. I'm here. Take any 'rakhi' you like. I'll pay for it. - Hey, you steal! - No, my brother told me. Which brother? Your father owns the place? ! Hey! Aren't you ashamed to hit a child? I'll slap you! What's she to you? - I am her brother. - A thief's brother is a thief! Hey, don't call me a thief! How much is the cost? I'll pay. You're arrogant because of money! - Don't hit me! - What will you do? - Don't hit me! - What will you do? Brother! Bloody pest! I'll break your legs if you come here again! Take your things away! Paul, my times are bad today. Destiny has defeated me and you can beat me up, too. But I swear on my sister on my mother, that someday, I, too will beat you up here. My name will appear tomorrow where yours is, today. Or I'm not my mother's son. And my name is not Sikander! Since that day I become an enemy of smugglers like you. I had your goods seized by the police. And the police kept rewarding me. With that money, a poor Sikander built such a big market. - Remember? - Sikander! Don't worry. Sikander never takes the law in his hands. Anyway, I wouldn't have beaten him up here. This is my area. After being beaten, he'd have maligned me, saying "Sikander called me to his area and beat me up." No. I shall go and beat him in his house. If you want to seize goods, then I'll tell you the hideouts. Go there. You'll finds goods worth millions. Worli, Plot No.13; in Kalyan... Catch them! Don't let them escape. If we do find the goods there then even this time, you'll get a reward from the government. No, I don't want any reward. Distribute the money amongst the poor children on the pavements. It will be of help to them. Who knows, some Sikander may be getting ruined by a Paul! Sikander is incredible! From rags to riches! There was a small slum yesterday; today he has built a splendid home. He is illiterate but he is educating his sister. Brother, what's this? Tears in your eyes? I remembered mother today. Once, in this very lane, breathing her last, she had said "My blessings are with you, son." "Someday, my son will touch the skies." When there was nothing, there was mother. Today, when there is everything, then... mother isn't here. Anyway... Look whom I have brought. - Tell me, who is he. - I do not know. He is the same holy man who taught your brother to laugh. Revered One! She is Mehru, my sister. Salutations! May God bless you with a long life! He is Iqbal. I've fixed Mehru's alliance with him. Mehru will go away after some days. And I will be alone again. Sikander, God has sent you to this world to fulfil this duty. It will be a very great day for you when your sister will be getting married and leaving home... It will be a very great day. Let's go, son. Yes? Didn't you invite the people living opposite? I did. They are snobbish; they will not come. Brother, you did not listen to me. If we had built a home higher than theirs then their honour would be in shambles! No. A man does not become great by building a tall home. If I had built my home higher than theirs, then people would say... Sikander has become very proud after getting wealthy. And a head filled with pride doesn't remain high for long. It breaks and falls at one's feet. That's what happened to them. They had driven you out, calling you a thief. Their pride is in shambles. I've heard, Ramanath's daughter, Kamna works as a teacher in some music school. - Madam. - You? You've come here, too? Why don't you stop pursuing me? I have got a small job with great difficulty. You wish that I lose it, too. Everything is gone. I do not possess a thing except honour. I beg of you, not to slander me. Madam, I am willing to lay down my life for your honour. I do not want your life! Just stop following me! If the childhood matters are yet in your mind, then forget them. Whatever happened in childhood, was a child's play. We aren't children anymore. If father hears of your deeds, then he'll kill himself. If I have anyone in this world other than God, it's my father. I request you for the last time... stop stalking me! Madam, I've wanted to tell you how I feel, since childhood. But you never gave me a chance in so many years. Alright. I do not want anything from you. People live all their lives because of love. I shall live with your hatred. But hate me. Don't deprive me of at least that right. Goodness me! There you go again! "Love has made you useless, else you too were a useful man" - Mr. Awarelal. - How often have I said not Awarelal, but Pyarelal Aware. Yes. Mr. Pyarelal, leave me alone today. The Almighty has sent me down for this purpose. He has said, "Whenever Sikander feels sad and wants to stay alone you go there soon." Come with me. - Where? - I'm taking you along to drown. - Drown? - Yes. "Never ask a person in love, about their condition." "How each passing moment is for them." "Those who have a companion always think of them." "Those who don't have one, they pray to find one." Wow, wow. "Please accept the salutation of love." "Please accept the salutation of love." "Please make the mistake of falling in love with me." "My heart is impatient." "My heart is impatient for a companion." "My heart is impatient for a companion." "Please accept the salutation of love." "Please make the mistake of falling in love with me." "My heart is impatient for a companion." "My heart is impatient for a companion." "Please accept the salutation of love." "I will tell you the story of a night." "I will tell you the story of a night." "It was a full moon night." "There was turmoil in my heart." "There was a desire." "The turmoil in my heart was very intense. "A cloud suddenly appeared from nowhere." "A cloud suddenly appeared from nowhere." "It enveloped the moon." "The moon was lost in the clouds." "Oh gosh, what has happened in this passion?" "My heart yearns." "My heart yearns for someone's attention. "My heart yearns for someone's attention. "Please accept the salutation of love." "Listen to the rest of the story from me." "After listening to it, there will be tears in your eyes." "Whatever is there in your heart I assure you it will come on your lips." "You are the messiah, of those whose heart has been broken." "Messiah. Messiah, of those whose heart has been broken." "You are the messiah, of those whose heart has been broken." "I have come here for you." "Now whether you treat me or kill me." "This heartbroken one has come to you." "Do me a favour, one favour." "Do a favour to your guest." "Do a favour to your guest." "I will bless you, I will bless you all my life." "I will bless you all my life." "Please accept the salutation of love." "Please make the mistake of falling in love with me." "My heart is impatient for a companion." "My heart is impatient for a companion." "Please accept the salutation of love." Wow, wonderful! Wow, wonderful! - Let's go, Mr. Pyarelal. - Wow! Mr. Pyarelal. Yes, Miss Zohra? Who was the gentleman with you? He is my friend. His name is Sikander. In this brothel, people either come here hurt or leave this place hurt. He is the first man who leaves me bruised. What are you saying, Zohra? Really? Yes, I've seen many dejected men but none like him. "Now give me medicine or poison" I think, he has been deeply hurt. Yes, but he doesn't utter a word. He is a very nice man. Do bring your friend here again. - Mr. Pyarelal. - I'll wait. I will. If you say, I surely will. Mr. Pyarelal... bring him soon. Until he arrives here there will be no song and dance in this brothel. - Where are you? Come on. - In a minute. I'll leave. I brought you here to get drowned in the sea. Instead, you have drunk the entire sea. I, myself, am drowned. And to such a great extent that anyone looking at me with compassion, gets drowned too. - Don't understand? You won't. - Why not? Because... it's simple. My thirst remains unquenched. - Then let's go. - Wait. Where will you get it at this late hour of the night? You are living Pyarelal's life for the first time. You've seen one wonder. Now see the second. - Where have you brought me? - This is a bar. He is the owner. Many drank and died; these are the few who remain. Why joke? I've brought a man today whom you will be thrilled to meet. This is Mr. Sikander. - What's wrong, Paul? - Don't utter my name. He'll hear it. - The lawyer is not to be seen. - He must be on his way. Sit down. "Give me wine, galore, A drink after a drink" - Triechel? MAN: Can I have your attention, please? He didn't seem like the type. Could you quiet down? Guys? I'm tempted to say, "Shut up," here, but I won't do that. Want to go to the movies tonight? You've all been real cooperative today. I know it's been kind of confusing and crazed and congested, and we're running 90 minutes late. So we're going to postpone registration until Monday.

ANGIE: Let's go. - No, I have to settle this. - I came to see a movie. - And so did I. - Yeah, but not King Kong. - Hey, man! CAPPIE: Settle down. - Let's go. No fights! I mean it! You should listen to the lady. If I was you, I wouldn't stick around to see the movie. You understand me, Leukoplakia? I'll be looking for you guys afterwards. - No, he won't. - The hell I won't. - They'll be with me afterwards. - Yeah? We're going out to eat. - Why do you always stick up for him? - Why are you always picking on him? ANGIE: Let's go. The movie's started. Just make sure we're on opposite sides of the line tomorrow. Sure. Can I get a Feese's, please? - Do you want anything? ALISE: No. - Maybe we should leave. - I'm not afraid of that shit-bag. - Don't worry about it. We're going out. - I can't. My mom's picking me up. - Sorry about that. - Yeah, well, so am I. I'll see you guys inside. I didn 't believe it. But you saw it. You saw it, didn 't you? Yes, I... I saw it. I thought she was... ACTOF: As God is my witness, I saw the thing. PFICE: You've committed murder just as much as Elaine did. MAGGIE: Why do they call you Leukoplakia? Does it mean something? Leukoplakia is cancer of the mouth. I think they've done it. It's the same with pigeons. You can tell by the way they kiss. Help me! Help me! [SCREAMING] [MUSIC PLAYS] [CHATTERING] It was huge, man! Huge! "Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!" Let's score some beers. TONTO: Screw beers. Let's get bandoleros! - What are bandoleros? - I don't know. But some guy said he'd get great bandoleros. - Can we get a little organization here? MARY ELLEN: Let's turn it up. SPIKE: It's a great song. MARIE: Come on, turn it up! All right! - What was that? CAPPIE: Jesus! [SCREAMING] TONTO: Jesus Christ! MARY ELLEN: What was that? - Is everybody all right? SPIKE: I don't believe it! - Holy shit! MARY ELLEN: Are you okay? CAPPIE: Are you all right? MARIE: I thought I was gonna die! "Help me! Help me! Help me!" TONTO: You think the car's all right? SPIKE: Let's take a look at the hood. TONTO: Let's check it out. - You all right? - Yeah. Look at the windshield. - What were those things? MARIE: I don't know, they were scary! TONTO: Something hit me in the face. ALISE: They were bugs. It was locusts. Listen! MARIE: To what? MARY ELLEN: I can't hear anything. CAPPIE: I don't hear anything. - They're hatching in the trees. - I wanna get out of here. - They can't hurt you. I don't care. I want to get out of here. - In Africa, people eat them. SPIKE: Get the mustard. - I wanna get out of here. CAPPIE: Felax. I just wanna get out of here! I hate to say this, but there's something in your hair. - Shut up! - I'm serious! ALISE: Oh, shit! CAPPIE: Alise. Alise, relax. Felax! It's okay! It's all right! Settle down. I'll get it! I'll get it! Calm down. Look, I got it. CAPPIE: Did you get it? - I got it. Look, it's out. It's out. - It's okay. MAGGIE: See? CAPPIE: It's just a bug. [LOCUST CHIFPING] - Thank you. - I don't mind them. - Lucas told me all about them. LUCAS: You got one? Let me see it. TONTO: Let's see. SPIKE: Is that thing for real? TONTO: Check it out. - All right! SPIKE: Into the light. TONTO: I can't see it. MARIE: Look how big it is! - I gotta be real delicate. It's a baby. It's the first time it's seen the world. It just hatched. - Are you sure you're okay? - Are there any more in my hair? No, I don't see any. ALL: Wow. MARIE: Look at its wings! TONTO: Check it out! MARIE: Look at that! TONTO: It doesn't move. MARY ELLEN: It's not trying to get away. SPIKE: Hey, it must be dumb. It's not dumb. Its wings are still wet. It's totally helpless. SPIKE: I've never seen these things before. LUCAS: They only hatch out every 17 years. MARY ELLEN: How come every 17 years? - He loves bugs. He's a great kid. - Thanks for sticking up for him. - It's okay. I like him. I'm glad. - He did something for me once. MAGGIE: Did he? Well, what did he do? Cappie? Can we get out of here right now? - Please? - Sure. MARY ELLEN: I think it's ugly. MARIE: Does it bite? LUCAS: It doesn't have a mouth. All it lives for is to mate. TONTO: Hey, like me! - I think it's moving a little. LUCAS: What are you doing? TONTO: Step on it! - Don't! MARIE: Guys! I got it! Oh, my God, it looks like a huge MM! SPIKE: That's disgusting. Let's get out of here. Let's go. [CAR STARTS] CAPPIE: Hey, guys, come on, let's go. - Luke! ALISE: Let's go. CAPPIE: Luke, come on. [BAND PLAYS MAFCHING MUSIC] WOMAN: And I always like a big, strong, handsome man in the kitchen with me. Because a big, strong man always seems to feel so helpless. - Well, you don't seem very helpless. - No, ma'am. - You've broken a banana very well. - Thank you. Something handed down from my ancestors. TEACHEF: By the family tree, you might say? You might say, yeah. TEACHEF: Ready to make your drink? CAPPIE: Yeah. - Are you capable of handling this? - Quite capable, yes. I mean, you've never used a blender before. - No problem. - Anything you've left out? Bananas, milk. Not that I can see, no. - Nothing that you, overlooked? - No, ma'am. All right, then. Blend away. TONTO: Way to go, sport! Who'd like to show this big, strong man how to use the washer-dryer? MAGGIE: I think there's a gizmo to put this in but I just sprinkle it on top. Okay. Oh, mini-cycle. - And that's that. - Okay. So... - I hope it gets done in time. - So do I. Yeah. Uh... Do you wanna go or? Oh, well, you know how to use the dryer? Yeah, I think I can do it. I just don't know where to start. - I have 15 minutes. - Okay. Table for two? Care to hasn"t your gift with the oven. ELLEN: Did you wipe your shoes, Timothy? Yes, Mother. Oh, cake for me? Not till supper. But I"m so hungry, I"m weak. Truly? From your great application to learning? What did you learn at school today? Manners. Speak not, sing not, hum not, wiggle not, spit only in a corner. And very good learning, too. Now, wash your hands and finish the candles. But I dipped candles last week. And will again this week. Make haste while the tallow is warm. (GROANS) Oh, dear, are you ill? Shall I take you to Doctor John"s for some ipecac? I"ll be home by sundown. There, the leech has drawn the blood. By moonrise the swelling will be gone. That didn"t hurt very much now, did it? No. I fear not but ipecac. Good day, John. Barbara. Good day, Barbara. Oh, Jasper, fighting again? No, ma"am. I fell from a tree, an apple tree. Next time, lad, pick a tree your own size. Now, be off with you. You"d best keep your good eye open for the Elders. You have a new doctor"s book. Mm-hmm. But that"s not all I brought from Boston. (GASPS) John, you brought it. It will cost your aunt but six shillings. Oh. It"s beautiful. BARBARA: John, do you think I should wear the bow under the chin or at the side? JOHN: Well, the shopkeeper said at the side. BARBARA: The side. Oh, Martha, isn"t it lovely and gay? Yes, very gay, Barbara. Too gay, you think? Nonsense. There"s enough wearing of somber clothing here. But if Elder Goode sees it before the Sabbath meeting, he may forbid the wearing. Oh. And I"m just on my way to his house. Why not leave it here? May I? Yes, of course. Thank you. I can see their faces when I walk down the aisle next Sabbath. Thank you again, John. (DOOR CLOSES) Tituba, Abigail. TlTUBA: And every month in the dark of the moon, the drums would beat, and there"d be a rustle like a great wind and we"d hear them screaming and laughing, and we knew they were all meeting in the jungle. Who, Tituba? Who? TlTUBA: The spirits of the bad ones. And there"d be drinking and feasting and dancing, and suddenly a great fire would shoot up, and Obano himself would appear. Obano? You calls him Satan. Did you see him? TlTUBA: Oh, no, missy. Only a few ever seen him. He come in fire and go in a whirling of wings like bats. Up, up. And when morning come, the trees in that jungle would be dead and the river would be as red as blood. Tituba. You tell the most outlandish stories. You never saw such things. I"d see more than that if I drank the stuff she brews. abigail: Quiet, Goody. (GRUNTS) You should have been here sooner, Barbara. Tituba told our fortunes. I"m going to travel and meet strange men. MARY: And I"m going to marry a man from Boston. I"m to be a person of importance. I shall be above everyone else and everyone shall listen to me. See what she tells you, Barbara. ANN: Yes, tell Barbara"s fortune, Tituba. Will you? Give me your hand, child. I see a man, tall, well-favored, dark hair. Go on, Tituba. Go on. I see no more. Oh, please. Tituba! GOODE: Abigail, Tituba! It"s Father. Quickly! Quickly! Idleness and gossip! Abigail, to your spinning wheel. Tituba, prepare the supper! Howdy do, Elder. Howdy do. These are not the same weight as the others. Nor are they so strong of bayberry. Your aunt had best be more careful if she expects a full measure of my flax in return. Yes, sir. Tituba, you did go to those feasts in the jungle, didn"t you? No, no, mistress! No! But you did, or you couldn"t know so much about them. Tell me more. Not here. In my cabin, where the master won"t know. Jeremiah! Barbara! I"d forgotten you"d be here today! Did you have any luck? None, child. My traps are as empty of lobsters as the Elders" meetings are of humor. I"ll not be needing any candles this week, so you"d best run along home, child. So, you don"t want candles because you haven"t lobsters enough to pay for them. Nonsense! Come along. Oh, but my cabin is in disorder. I"ve had no time to clean. Then I"ll do it for you. Barbara! Barbara, don"t go in! That chair, it was rocking. The wind, perhaps. Now, child, it"s late. Your aunt will be worried. What is it? Am I not welcome today? Always welcome. Well, then, fetch some water while I get the broom. Oh, but... (SHRlEKS) Glory be. I heard your voice, but I thought you mortal. My nephew, Roger Coverman, from Virginia. Mistress Barbara Clarke. Glory be. Good day to you, sir. And to you, mistress. My aunt will be worried. Barbara, wait. I must ask you, not a word about my visitor. Nay, I cannot tell you why. Faith, but she must know. These tatters, this blood, this bandage. But let me give you the worst of it first. I"m a fugitive, I"m a rebel, I"m a traitor to the Crown. Oh. How interesting. Ah, but wait! You must let me give you the best of it. You see, "twas a little matter of taxes, and being a Virginian and a patriot, I resented it, as did others. The governor resented our objections and we replied with swords. I warrant it was a gallant fight. Gallant? Three hundred of them against 2,000 soldiers, and Roger with his back against the wall, holding off half a dozen. Now, now, now, Uncle, no matter how magnificent we were in defeat, they beat us well, put us to flight and confiscated our lands. But how came you here? A friendly skipper brought me as far as Boston, the rest of the way on foot, through your forests. Hiding by day, traveling by night. With a price on his head of €1,000. Do you think it worth it? Oh, Roger, be serious. There"s scarce a man, even in this colony, who wouldn"t give you up for that sum. I cannot speak for others. As for myself, I have not seen you. Good day, sir. She has not seen me? What does she mean by that? A rebuke, no doubt. Puritans of this colony would hardly approve your speech and manners. If manners they be. Oh! She"s forgotten her basket. Mistress! Mistress Barbara, you forgot your basket. Oh, thank you, sir. And I forgot the candles, and this piece of cake for Jeremiah. When will you come here again? I bring candles once each week. Only once? But I"m a great reader. I read far into the night. We shall have none by sunrise tomorrow. I must gather bayberries before I can make more. Bayberries? Then let me help you. I have an amazing nose for bayberries. I track them down like a hound upon the trail. You might be seen. I could not risk so valuable a head. Ah, "tis not my head that"s in danger now. Truly, when will I see you again? When I bring more candles. Uncle, you old miser of speech. Why did you not tell me of her? To think that she should find me like this. I"m sorry she found you at all. What? Would you ruin my life? Ruin your life? I"m trying to save it, lad. See that you do. From now on, it will be worth the living. A razor, a needle and a bit of mending, and I"ll soon be myself. (singing) Bid me to live, and I will live Thy protectant to be Or bid me love... Roger! Anyone within half a mile could hear you. Well, they might ask me to lead the psalm singing next Sabbath. Egad, that"s an idea. She"d be there of course. And I sorely need the comforts of religion. (singing) Bid me to live, and I will live And the scripture saith that Satan shall go to and fro in the land, and up and down in it, as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. My brethren, here in this new land, that ancient prophecy is being fulfilled. Satan and his legions are here. The power of God has driven him from the old world into this wilderness, where the ignorant savages were waiting to receive him. Say you, ""What signs are there of his presence?"" Where there is sickness or hurt or other grievous misery, there he is. I bid ye watch! I bid ye fast! And pray God to protect us from the power of Satan. (sighs) Speaking of Satan, I also bid ye beware of the frivolity and foolishness of women that bedeck themselves with ribbons, curls and lace bonnets. Thus causing the minds of men to wander. I tell you that a female that will fritter away her time, trimming and tricking herself out in such a fashion, should be looked upon as the mere gizzard of a trifle. The epitome of nothing and a very apt prey for the devil. We will now sing Psalm 8. Elder Cheeves will set the tune. (singing) Oh, Lord, our God in all the earth How thy name wondrous great Who hath thy glorious majesty Above the heavens set Out of the mouth of suckling babes Thy strength thou didst ordain That thou might still the enemy And them that thee disdain (MOUTHlNG) You, come with me... (MOUTHlNG) No. You, come with me... A little lower placed And hath with glory crowned him And comely majesty Amen Brethren, before we disperse, I have an announcement to make. One that gives me, personally, a feeling of great happiness and satisfaction. Elder Goode has set next Wednesday for the raising of my new home, which you, dear people, have so kindly given me. Remember, it is more blessed to give than to receive. So let no one forget to bring his or her gift. Good day, Goodwife Nurse. How are you, child? Very well, thank you. It"s good to see so glowing a countenance, even under a bonnet so... So sinful. I"ve asked Miles Corbin to supper. Wait and bring him home with you. (SHUSHlNG) Oh, Miles! (clearing THROAT) Good day, Barbara. Good day. I"m ready, Miles. Are you coming? I cannot go with you, Susy. I"ve consented to sup with the widow Clarke and Barbara. I should think you"d wait for the man Tituba promised you. What did she mean by that? Oh, she"s just jealous. Aye, and rightly so. Mr. Parris. I was much interested in your sermon today, for in Boston last week, Mr. Cotton Mather told me two women had been arrested at Cape Ann for witchcraft. Satan"s instruments. He promised to keep me informed of any further outbreak. There are several here who could bear questioning. One, anyway. Goody Hodgers? Aye. A witch if ever there was one. The judges were too lenient when she was accused last year. She deceived them with lies. bilge: Mr. Goode! Mr. Parris! Mr. Goode! I saw him! I saw him plain. PARRlS: Saw whom? The devil"s own person in yonder forest. Drunk again. No, sir. And on the Sabbath, too. No, sir. I been drinking, but I"m not drunk now. But I"m going to be. I"d sooner see snakes than devils. Well, Deborah will be waiting supper. I"d best be going, too. Good day, Mr. Parris. I"ll go with you, Elder. "Tis like jelly I am with fright. He came right at me! (SCOFFS) I tell you, I saw him. I saw his horns and his tail. Have a care, Bilge, or they"ll arrest you like they did me. Did you see him? They said I did. You better get yourself a charm, Bilge. A charm to keep him away. Do you know a good one? Indian beans are good, worn round the neck. Or a badger"s claw. But the surest charm of all is a necklace, 21 links, each woven of seven hairs freshly plucked from the end of a dog"s tail. (laughing) Seven hairs freshly plucked from the end of a dog"s tail. I"ve been thinking, Barbara. Yes? It was you Reverend Parris meant when he rebuked your sex. I fancy it was. You"re a bold piece, Barbara, (clearing THROAT) with your frippery. What you have need of is a man of character to restrain ye. It"s very kind of you to concern yourself about me, Miles. I consider it my duty, for when I marry, I"m entitled by the colony to take for myself a fine piece of bottom land with a brook on it, and I shall have three horses, six cows, 10 pigs. Ten... That seems an over abundance of pigs. Moreover, the Elders think well of me. The people in the village listen when I talk. One day I shall be an Elder. (laughing) Oh, Miles. You laugh too freely, Barbara. After marriage, I"ll not brook such frivolity. Indeed. The Elders have been speaking of you and me as a proper couple, and my mother is of a mind that we should be married soon. Miles, you sweep me off my feet! So, you make sport of the Elders" suggestion? Sport of me? Well, I"ll not be laughed at through supper. Oh, no, Miles! Miles, I did not mean to flout you. Besides, we have chicken for supper. You cannot induce me. Susy Abbot"s a right-thinking girl, and the Abbots always have chicken. Miles. (GROANS) Oh, chicken. Don"t touch. Where"s Miles? Aunt Ellen, please forgive me, but I made a jest. And I"m afraid he understood it. Barbara! And weighing his pride against your good chicken, he decided not to come. Oh, Barbara! You cannot refuse every young swain in the village. It is your duty to marry and have children, to the glory of God and the colony. But would you have me marry a man who boasts only of his fine bottom lands, his three horses, six cows, 10 pigs, and treats me like one of his livestock? Oh, faith! The man is a blockhead. I cannot abide him or his pigs! But the chicken, enough for a family of six. Oh, yes, the chicken. ROGER: Chicken. Ambrosia! Food for the gods! Mistress, you"ve saved my life. Sure I wouldn"t be discourteous to the lobsters of Massachusetts, but to have them for breakfast, dinner and supper. Why, the very expression of a lobster"s eye brings to my mind our red-faced Governor of Virginia. Hail to the colony, I say, but confound the governor. You"ll be confounded yourself if you don"t stay away from the village. As I nearly was today, it was in the shadows of the forest. I came suddenly upon a people-minded villager, and he held up his finger so. Whereupon, I threw my cloak over my head, Ieaped behind a tree and bellowed like a demon. And how that villager ran. He ran so fast, his legs couldn"t keep up with him, so that he fell and rose howling and ran some more. Isn"t it good to hear a man laugh so freely? Aye, we seldom hear it in this place. That"s your penance for living among these Puritans, Uncle. Not meaning yourself, mistress. It"s true they"re not much given to laughter, Roger. And they"ve little cause. "Tis a stern heritage that has come down to them through generations. Yet, in spite of all that, they conquered this land. It took courage to do that, my lad. Listen to him, a sermon in everything he says. But believe me, mistress, he"s a rebel, too. For in Virginia, when they would not let him teach his ideas of a kindly God, he turned rebellious, and now traps lobsters. Your tongue"s too loose, nephew. And you burn too many candles. You"ll excuse me. There, I"ve done it. What? Recalled the old days to his mind. He loved Virginia. (sighing) I don"t wonder. From what you"ve told me, it must be very gay. We make it gay. We"ve a saying there, ""When danger lurks around the corner, ""you must dance the safe moments away."" Dance? That"s not a Puritan custom, I warrant. Oh, no. Have you never danced? The cotillion, the gavotte? The very names sounds frivolous. The Gavotte"s my favorite. I"ll teach it to you. No, no, no, no, it would not be fitting for me. It"s the most proper dance, I assure you. This is the manner of it. (humming) Ah, faith, but you must smile when you dance. One, two, slowly curtsy. ELLEN: Now, the first one. timothy: I was. You was. You were. Were. He was. You was. Were. Were. I say. You says. ELLEN: Timothy, I fear you will never be a scholar. timothy: May I go to bed, Mother? Yes. What are you doing? Dancing. Dancing? What are you bowing for? That"s a curtsy to my partner, a very handsome young man. I don"t see any man. You"re not supposed to. Mother! She said she"s dancing with a handsome young man. Get along to bed with you. Go on. Aw... Barbara, you do say the most foolish things. Dancing? And you supposedly a God-fearing girl. I"m sorry, Aunt Ellen. Does no good to be sorry after the deed. Besides, tomorrow is the house-raising. You"d better get your sleep. There"ll be plenty to do. Yes, Aunt Ellen. (SLURRlNG) Here, doggy. Nice, doggy. Here, here, here. Here, doggy. Doggy! (DOG yelping) All safe. Jump. (BOTH laughing) This way. (BARBARA EXCLAlMlNG) ROGER: Here we go. (BOTH laughing) "Tis an avalanche we are. Did you hurt yourself? I"m shaken to pieces. What did you expect? How was I to know the ground would give way and upset your Puritan dignity? Oh. Well, I"m fast learning how it feels to be a fugitive. Hiding in trees, tumbling down hills. Like a very mountebank. Before long, I"ll have you as cunning as a fox, swift as a deer, leaping from hill to hill. Oh, Roger! Methinks the whole pattern of my life has changed since I"ve known you. Aye, and I can"t say I"m proud of it. "Tis a sneaking feeling I get, dodging and hiding about like a badger in his hole. Must it always be like that for you? Well, I suppose I could send a petition to Their Majesties. Could you? To King William and Queen Mary? What would you say? Well, now, that takes a bit of thinking. I fancy I"d try to appeal to the human side. Now, if I were talking to the King, man to man, I"d say, ""William, can"t you and I come ""to a fair and square understanding? ""You see, there"s a young lady in the case. ""l"d like to see her in proper fashion, to meet her family. ""But how in conscience can I do it ""with your governors chasing me all over the colonies?"" ""Now, just put yourself in my place, William. ""Supposing you were chased out of London ""and had to hide at Dover, by the sea. ""You"d miss your Mary, wouldn"t you? Of course you would. ""Well, it"s the same with me, but worse. ""For, mind you, though I"m not saying a word against your Mary. ""The young lady I have in my mind is the most fascinating, ""twinkling, dark-eyed maid that ever took an honest man"s breath away."" Now, whisper, what would you say to that? I"d say... I"d say I had to gather herbs and get to the house-raising. But that"s not what I"ve been asking. I must hasten. Now, men, get ready. Take hold! One, two, three! "Tis the best raising we"ve had, Rebecca. Well, I want to know. Barbara and Doctor John. The whole village working, and we"re the only idlers. A choice bit of gossip for Mrs. Cheeves. Her day would be spoiled if she did not have something to babble of. John. Don"t say you found me on the shore road. Why not? Because... ELLEN: Barbara! I"m sorry I"m late, Aunt Ellen, but the herbs were scarce and hard to find. "Tis a poor excuse, Barbara. You must have been daydreaming again. Of a certain tall, well-favored man, I warrant. ELLEN: Why, what do you mean? That was Tituba"s prophecy for her. A dark, handsome young man. SUSY: A dark young man? Well, it certainly couldn"t be Miles. Well, Martha... What kept you so long, John? I had to stop by Goody Dobbs. I didn"t know she was ailing. (laughing) She isn"t, but her cow is. Is that where you found Barbara? Oh, no, no, she was hurrying along the... (STAMMERS) In the forest. MAN: Ready for the door, John. Coming! Coming! Mr. Parris, my little contribution. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. It"s all right. Look, it will be finished by sundown. Splendid. Even to the shelves for your books. Ooh. That reminds me. You promised to lend me Cotton Mather"s book on witchcraft. Did you bring it? No. I can"t lay my hands on it. I"ve searched the house. It"s disappeared. ""Sometimes they would be deaf, ""sometimes dumb and sometimes blind, ""then their tongues would be drawn down their throats, ""then they would be pulled out on their chins to a prodigious length. ""They would make the most piteous outcries. ""They were scratched, they were pinched and tormented, ""all of which they said was the work of women who bewitched them. ""Sometimes the children were shaken with a fit."" I don"t want to be pinched and tormented. Quiet! I"m only telling you what"s in a book. It must have been dreadful. Did those children die? No. They were the talk of the colony. Cotton Mather even took one of them to live in his great house in Boston. The whole town came to see her and prayed over her. The whole town? Oh, my. Yes. Just like they pray over a queen or somebody great. I"d like that. So would I. I don"t want anybody to bewitch me. Will you keep still? What else did they do? Go on, read some more. All right. (BELL tolling) Dinner! Don"t you tell! No. Wait for me! Wait for me! (MERCY sobbing) Ann, go back there and help Mercy. Oh, let her help herself! I"m not her mother! Ann! There, there. Oh, Mercy! Mercy, don"t cry. Barbara"s here. Yes. There, there. Ann is such a naughty girl, but we don"t care. No. Now, what shall we do? Shall we make a puppet? Yes, please, Barbara. Yes, that"s what we"ll do. Now, watch. And we"ll make it to look just like Barbara, shall we? Look. Now, we"ll take a piece of string... Mary, have you seen Mercy? I think she"s in the saw pit, Mrs. Cheeves. Susy, will you tend to this for me? I"ll be back in a minute. (laughing) I think she"s very funny. She looks just like me, doesn"t she? What are you doing? Come here. (sobbing) And stop that crying or I"ll give you a good whipping. Drop that, child. Children wait till their elders are served. I don"t have to wait. What"s this? Why, this is what the master was looking for. Give it back this minute. No, no, not to you. Master Goode, sir. She took it. No, no, master. It fell from her bonnet. She... Go to the house. I"ll attend to you later. But, Father... At once! I haven"t had a drink all day. Bilge. It is all right, Marshal, I know me way to the stocks. And see that you go straight. (GRUNTS) As straight as me legs"ll carry me. (spanking) ANN: No, Father. No! (ANN sobbing) GOODE: Now, get into your bed and stay there. (ANN continues sobbing) Don"t, Ann. Don"t cry. I hate him! I hate him. I hate Tituba! Oh, I could kill her for telling him! Don"t, Ann, don"t! You look like you"re bewitched! Do I? Did I really frighten you? Yes. You look awful. Mistress, the master... He doesn"t know. Is that the potion you were telling me about? Yes, the juice of herbs and flowers, like I used to make in my country. Will it take you to the witches" feast? Can you truly go there? My spirit can. Could I go there if I drank your potion? No, no, mistress. It wouldn"t be right for you. Why not? Your husband, Master Goode. He won"t know. Tituba, you must help me. I can"t go on like this. I want the things you promised me. Laughter, dancing, happiness. You promised me happiness would come to me. I want it now. I want to live before the years close in. I"m afraid! I"m afraid, mistress. No, I"m afraid. Tituba, I may not have need for this old cloak. It would keep you warm this winter. Well, will you give it to me now? Will you? Yes, I will. Yes, I will. Yes. You will drink this at an open window in the dark of the moon. Elder. Why, Mr. Morse. What brings you so far afield? Is anything amiss? I come from Cape Ann with evil tidings. Come in. Come in. GOODE: Of course you"ll stay the night. MORSE: Thank you, I will. Good evening, mistress. Good evening. Abigail, Mr. Morse is staying the night. Prepare a bed for him. Yes, Nathaniel. Sit ye down and rest. Rest? I cannot rest. Neither will anyone else in this village when they hear what I have to say. Deborah. Martha, something"s amiss. Yes. (PEOPLE chattering) My good people, Mr. Morse has ridden from Cape Ann with grave tidings for us all. Hear him. People of Salem Village, we are in great danger. The power of evil is upon us. Strange apparitions have been seen in the forests. The people of Cape Ann have barricaded themselves in their homes. The Elders have seized women who have confessed to being witches. (ALL gasping) Others have been taken at Boston. The evil is spreading among us. Beware of those in secret league with Satan. Satan, who is fighting to destroy our faith in God. We know how he works with such men and women who have given their souls to him, sending his spirit into them with power to harm and destroy others. Power to bring sickness and blight upon us. Children have been bewitched, their minds tormented, their bodies twisted. No one is safe. So watch your neighbor. Watch one another, even those of your own household. For those we least suspect may be the devil"s servants wearing the false cloak of godliness. (wind blowing) The scriptures say, ""Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. ""And if any man or woman consulteth with a familiar spirit, (rain pattering) ""they shall be put to death!"" So, death to them, or we ourselves will be destroyed. Death to the servants of darkness. (THUNDER rumbling) (wind howling) (sobbing) Barbara! It"s monstrous, coming here and spreading terror through the whole village. I tell you, it"s monstrous. But there must be reason to fear. But to threaten death, to burn and to hang. I"ve never believed in witchcraft. There"s been no real proof of it. (banging ON DOOR) MR. CHEEVES: Dr. John! Come. Come quickly. Little Ann Goode is afflicted. What ails the child? We don"t know, but she"s in great torment. I"ll come with you, John, I may be able to help. Yes. Hurry. (sobbing) They"re hurting me. They"re hurting me again. Ann. Ann, who hurt you? Thank heaven you"ve come, Doctor. Ann. Ann. Ann. Oh, they"re choking me. Oh, they"re torturing me. Ann! Ann, child, quiet. I can"t! This is Dr. John. Tell me, what hurts you? Everything. Everything. (groaning) Ann. Ann. I see them by Nabby. They"re after her, too. Abigail. Abigail? Yes, where is her mother? I"ll get her. (screaming) Ann, my child. Abigail. Abigail... Abigail. No. No. They"re drinking wine, red as blood. (PEOPLE chattering) MAN: How can they stand it? WOMAN: Poor little things. Who could be doing this? If we only knew, we"d make short work of them. Poor little souls. They"ve been suffering all night. (ANN screaming) Has anyone found out what"s hurting them? No. Mr. Morse is still questioning them. (NABBY groaning) (groaning) Quiet, dear, quiet. (sobbing) I can find nothing physically wrong with them. Because they"re beyond your skill, Doctor. I know the signs of bewitchment. Bewitchment. We want to help you, others may be harmed. If someone is hurting you, we must know who it is. It"s clearer. Clearer. I see. Don"t. Don"t. Don"t let her hurt me. Don"t... I do see! I do see! Don"t let her hurt me! Don"t let her hurt me. You mean Tituba? Yes. Don"t let her get away. Catch her. Tell the others. Quick. It"s Tituba. ALL: Tituba? Aye. They"ve cried out against Tituba! (ALL clamoring) Get back there. They"ll see you. Will... Will they hurt her much? No. She"s only a slave. I... I"m afraid! Well, you don"t have to be. Now, get back there quick, and lie down. (overlapping CHATTER) And then they took the poor creature to Salem Town for a hearing. But how can they believe that people become devils all of a sudden? There"s no reason to it. There never is any reason when fear strikes. Roger, if that slave confesses, which she may do under their form of questioning, madness will sweep the whole village. It"s hard to explain, lad, but I"ve seen it happen in England. Then no one is safe? No one. Even to defend a person accused arouses suspicion. That"s why I fear for Barbara. Barbara? Today she tried to protect Tituba. I warned her, but... What are you going to do? Do? What would you have me do, after what you"ve told me? I must get her away from here. But think of yourself, you mustn"t be seen. It will do you no good to lie. Now tell us, why did you bewitch those children? I didn"t. I didn"t. We"ve been patient long enough. Confess. But I don"t know nothing about it. You said you did. You said you knew Satan, that you saw him. But, master, I just made up tales to please them. I meant no harm. This woman is a witch. I"ve proof of it. She bewitched my wife. SEWALL: Your wife? You"re the first to know. My wife told me that last night this woman forced her to take a magical potion. But she made me give it to her. GOODE: You lie. My wife spoke while she was under bewitchment. You took her there. I didn"t. I didn"t. Did you give her the potion? You must answer. Yes, master. But it was only the juice of the flowers to make her sleep. Confess your witchcraft. But, master, you"ll hang me. No, no. Not if you confess. That will prove your repentance and save your life. You mean, if I say I"m a witch, that"s repentance? SEWALL: Yes. And you won"t put a rope around my neck? You won"t hang me? LAUGHTON: No, no, you"ll live. MORSE: Confess! I confess. Yes. Yes, I confess. You"re in league with the devil. Yes, yes. You"ve seen him. Yes, often, often. It was you who hurt the children? Yes. I hurt the children. But I didn"t mean to hurt them. They made me. The others made me. They hurt the... Others? TlTUBA: Yes. There was many others. Do you know who they are? Yes. Now, let me go. Let me go. MORSE: Tell us their names. Oh, let me go. MORSE: Tell us their names! It was Goody Hodgers and... Giles Cory, Charles Patton and... (BELL tolling) Halt! What is this? Tituba has confessed. And has cried out against others. Who are named? Giles Cory, Goody Hodgers, and many others. John. John. Giles Cory. Are they mad? We cannot let this go on. There"s nothing we can do. There must be. If you won"t, I... Barbara. Come to the house. Why? Come into the house. Well, what is this? Barbara, you must not speak nor defend anyone accused. But why? Believe me, dear, it"s dangerous. Ellen is right. Why do you both look at me so strangely? Because we fear for you. Fear for me? Ellen, tell her. Barbara, you"ve never known about your mother, how she died. Why, yes. She died in England of grief, when my father was lost at sea. Not of grief. A woman hated her. She whispered that your mother, by witchcraft, had caused your father"s death. She was accused of witchcraft? JOHN: Convicted and... ELLEN: We had to tell you, dear, because of the danger. If this were known, suspicion might point to you. You see, Barbara, why you must keep silent? Do... Do others know? Only Martha. Martha? You know we came from the same town in England. But I have her promise not to tell. (sobbing) God have pity. God have pity. What a heavy secret for you to carry all this while. Now, go up to bed, please. You need rest. You will be careful? Yes. I wish we could have kept this from you. No. John, they want you at the meeting house. Oh, yes. I"ll come at once. Good night, Barbara. timothy: Barbara. Why aren"t you asleep? What were all those people doing outside? Never mind. Now, go to sleep. I know. It"s because of Satan. I heard Mrs. Cheeves say so. (sighing) That"s just her way of making you be a good boy. Oh, then I can go out tomorrow and play? No, no. The Elders want all children to stay in for a few days. But I want to go out. Oh, Timothy, please go to sleep. (sobbing) (window PANE TlNKLlNG) (GASPS) Why, you"re trembling. Oh, hold me close. There, there. I know what has happened. Jeremiah has told me. That"s why I"ve come here. I have a plan to take you away. Away? Of course. I could not let you stay here now. But... But, Roger, to leave here, and leave Aunt Ellen. You love me, don"t you? Oh, Roger. Then you must trust me. But where could we go? There are many countries not under British rule. I"m going to Boston to find a ship that will give us passage. Jeremiah goes with me. When all is arranged, he"ll come and bring you to me. No, I"m afraid. Afraid? With me? Oh, no, for you. You may be seen. If you were taken, I might never see you again. I"ll be a very shadow for your sake. I"ll travel only by night. Now, think of this while I"m gone, that soon we"ll be together, without hiding, without secrecy. You"ll be my wife. Oh, my dearest. (JEREMlAH whistling) That"s Jeremiah. Someone must be on the road. I must go now. Goodbye. Oh, no, Roger. Roger. Oh. Oh, Timothy. What are you doing out of bed? Who were you with? What? I saw you. You were with a man. Oh, nonsense, you must have been dreaming or perhaps you saw the shadow of a tree. No, it wasn"t a tree. Now, may I go out and play tomorrow? No. Very well, then. I"ll tell Mother and Elder Goode you were with a man. Timothy. Timothy. I tell you I was with no man. Mother! You mustn"t do that. Why are you so frightened? Look, Timmy. I was with someone, but if it were known it would make trouble. You wouldn"t want to make trouble for me, would you? No. Well, then, will you promise me you won"t tell anyone? Can I go out and play tomorrow? If you promise. I"d best go in alone. Bide here, lad. A tankard of ale, if you please. Aye, aye, sir. The harbor seems well filled. Aye, shipping be good. Sea trade brisk. Boston port be growing. What craft are in? Well, let"s see, there"s the Pirateer, the Charles Hope, the Seraphim... The Seraphim? From Virginia? Aye. I know her well. Who"s her skipper? Captain Edwards. He was here but a moment ago. Edwards? I must give him a hail. Where"s the Seraphim lying? At the foot of Fort Street. Sailing at flood tide. Thank ye. first MATE: Ho, there. What do you want? Is the captain aboard? captain: Aye. But all hands signed, if that"s what you"re asking. Well, not exactly, Captain Edwards. This is somewhat of a personal nature. Why, Mr. Coverman, I didn"t recognize you in this... Oh. Come below, come below. Come in. Sat thee down, sat thee down. Thank ye. I see you have a new mate. Aye, a lusty lad. I never thought to see you again, sir. I"ve been with my uncle here. Jeremiah Adams, Captain Edwards. And I wanted to thank you, Captain, for what you did for Roger. I might not have shipped the lad so safely had I known the price on his head. That was your loss, Captain. Little did you think I was worth the price of a new ship to you. That I didn"t, that I didn"t. But I"m satisfied to find you a free man. Aye, but would I be in Virginia? No, lad. Although there"s rumor of a new governor coming from England. A new governor? Aye. But they"re still hanging every rebel they catch. I feared as much. That"s why we sought you out. Captain, "tis urgent that I get away from here to some foreign port. Foreign port, eh? As to that, the French are none too friendly. But there"s Florida. That"s under Spanish rule. Are there Spanish ships in port? There must be. I heard a parrot swearing in Spanish at the tavern. It"ll take no time to find out. Then let"s lose none. Aye, but you"re forgetting the rum. I give you Their Majesties. Their Majesties. Their Majesties. Watch your head when you come up. Watch your head. There. Steady there. What"s afoot? Sir, that man"s a rebel. He"s wanted for treason in Virginia, and we demand his arrest. You demand. Yeah. Aboard my ship? Yeah. Go forward. Seize him, men. Well, as for you, sir. first MATE: Steady, lads, take him alive. Save yourself, Uncle! Get back to Barbara! first MATE: Seize him. You devils. "Tis likely we"ve saved you trouble, sir. Go mighty hard with ye, harboring a rebel against the Crown. Bring him forward. €1,000 worth of cargo. And the reward will be divided among us all. sailor: Well, this one"s done for. Come on. Over the side with him. We"ll be at sea when he wakes up. (MOB shouting) (indistinct) Let it be understood that this is but a hearing, not a trial. I call Ezra Cheeves. Now tell us, how did the prisoner harm you? In many ways, sir. I mind well the evening, two weeks ago, she came down through her meadow and stood at the fence, looking at my cattle. In the morning, my cows had gone dry. (PEOPLE murmuring) Then you believe she bewitched them? Aye, sir. And myself, too. For that night, I did have grievous pains in my left side, so grievous, I could not sleep. What have you to say to all this? I have not harmed him nor his cattle. I have not left my house for the past fortnight. I have been ill. Then it was her apparition I saw. I saw your witch"s face. You cast a spell on me. It"s true. She cast a spell on me. She told me at the house-raising that I would never be happy, that evil would come to me. And it did. My children were stricken. I was made ill. How could she foretell what would happen to me if she isn"t a witch? (sobbing) (GAVEL pounding) But... But what I said was counsel, meant only for her good. MORSE: Enough. Was it like this when my mother was... (SHUSHlNG) Child. On the evidence presented against Goodwife Nurse, we order her removed to Their Majesties" jail at Salem, there to await trial for witchcraft. No. No. How can you do such a thing to this saintly woman? I"ve known her from my childhood. She has done naught but good all her life. MORSE: Silence. You all know I speak the truth. There"s not one of you but has had some token of her kindness. What right have you to speak? This wench has no place here. I have as much as you, Mr. Cheeves. I beg you, sirs, do not send Rebecca Nurse to her death on the testimony of a man who tried to steal her land and did not succeed. He says his cows went dry. Who knows but it was time for them to go dry? He says he has pains in his side. Is it so strange for an old man who loves his cider to have pains? And you call this witchcraft. MORSE: You defy this court? But this is a matter of life and death. You hear only the accusers. Why not examine them? Find out if they"re lying, or if their minds are deranged. Only a witch defends a witch, and I know her for one. Ask Timothy Clarke what he told my daughter. Ask him. (ANN sobbing) MORSE: Bring the lad forward. What did you tell? I didn"t tell anything. He did. Speak up, lad. I only told Ann that one night I looked from my window and saw Barbara go out to the bridge and meet... Timothy. You promised. MORSE: Go on. And meet someone in the shadows, tall and black. He... He put his arms around her. MORSE: You mean it was a man? It looked like a man, but when I asked Barbara, she said it wasn"t. She said she was with someone, but she was with no man. MORSE: She said she was with no man? timothy: Yes. And... And she made me promise not to tell what I saw. Witch. Witch. Oh, no. I can explain. I was with... (WOMAN screaming) MORSE: Satan. Guard. Guard. Well, sir? Where are my friends? Why haven"t they come to see me? Governor"s orders, sir. Prisoners condemned for treason can see no one. But can"t I see my friend Mr. Denham? I have a message I must send north to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. I"m sorry, sir. There"s nothing I can do. (PEOPLE shouting) (DOGS barking) Hold. What"s beyond? Black swamp for miles. There"s no use going on. The dogs could not trail, sir. Could Mr. Coverman get through, do you think? soldier: No man could live in there. Ironical, isn"t it, Denham, that this should happen on the day that the new governor arrived with his pardon? (PEOPLE shouting) (DOOR unlocking) Oh... Oh, John. John. I cannot believe it"s really you. It"s been so long since I"ve seen anyone. I know. I know. I tried every way. They wouldn"t let me come here until today. But why? Barbara Clarke, you are ordered to appear before the court. (BELL tolling) (PEOPLE chattering) MAN: Here come the judges. soldier: Halt. Forward face. Barbara Clarke, you are hereby indicted and arraigned on charges of practicing the detestable arts of witchcraft, to the grievous harm and the endangerment of the colony. You have persistently denied these charges. Now, if you expect mercy of God, confess. I have nothing to confess. LAUGHTON: Then you deny that you have been snared into witchcraft? I deny there is such a thing as witchcraft. (PEOPLE gasping) Blasphemy. Why waste time trying her? I am sworn to administer justice, Mr. Morse. The trial will proceed. Timothy Clarke. Come forward. Timothy, you have stated that on a certain night you saw the accused in the arms of a cloaked figure? Yes, sir. And when she said it was no man, you believed it was Satan himself? Answer. Yes, sir. But the child did not say that at the hearing. No, sir. The thought has since been put into his mind. Silence. Under the law, you may not speak without leave. LAUGHTON: You have said that you saw her in her room at night, dancing alone. Yes, sir. LAUGHTON: And when you questioned her, she said? She... She said she was dancing with a handsome young man. But... But I wasn"t supposed to see him. And have you anything to say to that? I was but jesting, pretending. No more. LAUGHTON: And who were you pretending to dance with? The man Timothy saw at the bridge. The man I have already told you of. The man you all refuse to believe exists. May I question Timothy? You may question. Timothy, that night, you really thought it was a man, didn"t you? timothy: Yes. Well, it was. Now think. Try hard to remember. That man wore a feather in his hat, a dark cloak, a long sword. Strange clothes that you had never seen before. Couldn"t that have made you think that he was not real? Yes. LAUGHTON: Enough. Timothy, you may go. Barbara Clarke, you"ve told a strange story. If there were such a man as you now claim, why didn"t you tell about him in the beginning? Because I believed Timothy had seen his face and could describe him. SEWALL: Why shouldn"t he describe him? Because he was in hiding here, a political refugee. LAUGHTON: An artful tale. SEWALL: Is he in hiding still? He must be, or he would come to me now. Is he known to anyone here? What is his name? Can you tell us anything about him? (sobbing) I cannot. I cannot betray him. Do we need any further evidence? I think we do. So far, it has not been proven that the accused has brought harm to anyone as charged. But she has. She"s brought harm to one Mercy Cheeves. Call Mercy Cheeves. Mercy Cheeves. Now tell us, how did the prisoner harm your child? She has bewitched her, sirs. She gave her a puppet. From that day she has been ailing until we fear for her life. LAUGHTON: Is that the puppet? Yes. LAUGHTON: Let me see it. (sobbing) Don"t. Please don"t take it. (SHUSHlNG) She cries this way whenever it is taken from her. Child, who has bewitched you? (MERCY sobbing) Barbara. Barbara. Don"t let them hurt me. Let me go. Let me go. Let the child go to the prisoner. There, there, Mercy, don"t cry. No one is going to hurt you. Barbara won"t let them. Why don"t you come home with me? I will, dear, soon. No. Come now. What"s these? That... That"s just a silly game we"re playing. They took my puppet. I know, but her dress was all dirty. Now, if you leave her here, I"ll make her a nice new one. A red one? Yes. Yes, a red one. Now, be a good girl and go to your mother, will you? Go, Mercy. (sobbing) Take the child out. ALL: She"s a witch. She"s a witch. GOODE: Of course she"s a witch. You have condemned yourself. Now tell us, what power have you over that child? Can you not see for yourselves? It"s something that poor child has never had from its father and mother, kindness and love. Things that seem to have been forgotten hereabouts. Is it so strange that she should turn to someone who shows her a little kindness, and yet the evidence of such you call evil? Don"t, don"t let this blindness lead us again to murder! There"s been enough of it. Isn"t it plain that she"s telling the truth? That she"s shielding someone, someone she cares for? I know because... John. No, no, John. Please do not listen to him. She"s bewitched him, too. Martha! She"s of evil blood, born into witchcraft. Don"t, Martha! Don"t! Her mother was burned as a witch in England. (PEOPLE shouting) (GAVEL pounding) What proof have you of this? Ask her own aunt, Ellen Clarke. LAUGHTON: Call Ellen Clarke. You have heard the accusation. Is it true? Answer. Was the prisoner"s mother burned as a witch? Yes. But many innocent people were called witches. Was she pronounced a witch by a God-fearing English court? Answer. Oh, stop it. Stop it. Isn"t it enough that you"re torturing me? Yes, my mother was accused of being a witch. She was burned as one. But does that prove she was guilty any more than I am, or the others you have condemned? We"re not tried by justice, but by fear and ignorance. MORSE: "Tis the devil speaking. There is no power of evil such as you believe. Blasphemy. Why don"t you confess? I will not confess a lie, nor deny God to save my life. I do confess pity for you. You who have been given the power to save and send righteous people to their death. I don"t ask mercy of you, but only pray God for your awakening. She"s innocent. (ALL shouting) Oh, good day, lad. You"re Timothy, I warrant. Will you tell your cousin Barbara l"m here? Barbara? She... She... What is it, lad? Speak up. Mother. Barbara, will you not confess and save your life? Then may He have mercy on your soul. ROGER: Hold. MAN: Who is he? Hold. Hold. Hold. "Tis murder you"re doing. By what authority do you interfere? Arrest him! Take him away. Wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold. At least let us hear what he has to say. Who are you, sir? I am Roger Coverman. I"m the one that girl"s been protecting. The one you poor fools thought was Satan. Well, look at me. Am I not flesh and blood? Aye. Now that I look well, "twas you. "Twas you that made me think I saw the devil himself. Now are you convinced? But what of the other charges against her? Have you not heard enough? Will you be satisfied only with this girl"s death, when before your very eyes the principal charge against her has been proven false? What of the others who were hanged here? What if they were innocent, too? ROGER: Barbara. Barbara. Ann, come here. Father. Please. Please, Father. Please. Please forgive me, Father. Forgive me. (sobbing) I"m sorry. Oh, merciful God, forgive. The child confessed that it was spite that made her accuse the slave Tituba. You see, she didn"t realize what great harm might come from it. We... We made a thorough investigation. We now believe that all the other accusations sprang from either fear or malice. Now, as one of Their Majesties" judges, I beg Your Excellency to sign. Although this abolishes trial for witchcraft in this colony, it in no way atones for the past. We must do everything in our power to safeguard the future. First, it is my order that the tree on Gallows Hill be destroyed. [Whistle] [Whistle] Well, see you later, son. You do your stuff today. I'll have to if I want to pass. Good morning, Mr. schofield. Hello, hattie. Hello, verman. So long, son. So long, dad! How's you, penrod? Oh, I'm fine, thanks. Duke! Duke, go on home. Go on! I'll take Duke home. I'm going right by your house. Come on, Duke, get in there. Get in that wagon now. I'll take him home right now. Bye-bye, Rodney. Bye. Morning, Rodney! Oh. Hello. Morning, Mr. bitts. Howdy, schofield. A little late this morning, aren't you? 3 minutes of 9:00. You know the rules of the bank. This statement of the atlas trucking company's incomplete. Will you check on it? Yes, Mr. bitts. Get it to me as quickly as you can. It'll take about 10 or 15 minutes. All right. [Loud ringing] [Students talking, shouting] Hi, penrod. Meeting today? Shh! Not so loud! 4:00. Ok, chief. I don't know what's the matter with him. 4:00. 4:00? Ok. Sam, how about wienie? Oh, he's got the mumps. Oh, these kids nowadays... They've all got something the matter with them! Yeah, they ain't got no, uh... Stamula. Yeah. Gee! I got a pip! A thousand-dollar one! Gee! Jiggers! Here comes Rodney bitts. Whatcha got? What are you guys trying to hide? Wouldn't you like to see! Oh, I know what it is. Aww... You think he does? Oh, that nuisance doesn't know. He's a liar. Duke! Here, Duke! Come on, Duke. Whoa... Bread and butter. Ha ha ha ha! If your feet was any bigger, you'd be halfway home! Say, listen. I'll chase you right past your house. You'll never catch me, boy. I'm related to Jesse Owens! Oh, yeah? Hey! Don't do that! Here, take this one! Hey! Cut that out, will you? Hey, penrod, penrod! He's hitting me on the head. Ow! Penrod: Let him alone! Come on, verman. Oww! [Crying] Why don't you pick on somebody your own size? Yeah, why don't you grow up? You big bully! Don't cry, verman. What's the idea of picking on a little kid? Why don't you mind your own business? I'm making it my business. You stop picking on him! Why? What'll you do about it? You hit him again and I'll do plenty. Oh, yeah? I told you to quit it! [Boys shouting] Come on, penrod! Let's go, chief! Come on! [Shouting continues] You know, they've been showing a fair profit. What's that? Sounds like a fight. It is a fight, a couple of youngsters. They ought to be ashamed of themselves, the young hoodlums. I think one of them is Rodney. What? ! And the other's penrod! [Gasps] The disgrace! What's the matter with you? You shouldn't be... Where's my cap? Ahhh! Ahhh! [Bawling] What do you mean by such disgraceful conduct, Rodney? Fighting in the main street! I couldn't help it! They jumped me! Who jumped you? Penrod and his gang! Why, that doesn't sound like penrod, Rodney. What was the reason? I'll interrogate my son, Mr. schofield, if you don't mind. Certainly not, Mr. bitts. I was merely trying to bring out the facts in the case, because if what Rodney says is true... If what Rodney says is true? Schofield, Rodney was brought up to tell the truth always. Please don't infer that my son is a liar! Certainly not, Mr. bitts, but my boy is not a rowdy either. Penrod is not the one to employ gangster methods. And I certainly saw nobody else engaged in the fight but Rodney and penrod. I'll get the facts from Rodney. You attend to the Rogers matter. I'll talk to you later. Go into my office, Rodney! Wash your face and hands. I'm surprised at you, Rodney. I'm surprised at you! I could understand that schofield boy, but... It was all his fault, dad. I was walking home from school, minding my own business, when him and his gang started throwing horse chestnuts at me. For no reason? I wasn't doing a thing! Penrod's just got it in for me. He hit me when I wasn't looking! And then the whole gang jumped on me! Who were these other boys? All that gang of penrod's. Gang? Yes, sir. He's got a gang that does anything he says. They even steal tires and things, and sell them! No! Well, that's what I heard. But they keep away from me because they know I'd tell on them. Maybe we'd better inquire into this gang. Stop splashing! Come on! Piggy! Shh! Quiet! Come on! Hurry up! Coast clear, verman? Coast clear, chief. Ok, keep your eyes peeled. Everybody here? Operator 15 isn't. I know, I know. He's got the mumps. All right, all you guys. Get in your departments. Uh, beans? You take charge of the communicator. Any new applications? Uh, yes, we got 3. Well, we'll take them up at the next meeting. Has the fingerprint department got anything to report? I may have something here. Well, report it to me when you find out. Ok. How about the treasury? Same as last week. How's that? Nothing in it. If we don't watch out, we're gonna have trouble balancing our budget. Why don't you throw this department out? It's a waste of time! Aw, pipe down, stinky. Any new pictures, operator 12? A couple. Why, that's the fella works down at Smith's grocery store. You've got to quit wasting film, slats! You're supposed to take pictures of suspicious- looking characters! How do you think we're ever gonna catch any of these fellas? We want pictures of men that look like crooks! Why, that's the chief of police. Well, I thought he looked like a crook. Ohh... All right, 14, how about those two posters you've got? Here they are. My dad just got them in this morning. A thousand dollars! Shh. Hey, fellas! Come here! I want you to take a good look at this guy so you'll know him if you ever see him. Only $200 reward? Guess he ain't a very important crook. Maybe it ain't worth our while trying to check up on him. Well, take a peek at this one! [Boys gasping and murmuring] Uh, Jack, you can post these in a conspi... conspi... Conspicuous. Well, anyway, you can post them up. Say, piggy, you moved last week, didn't you? Yeah. Well, why didn't you tell a fella? Now I gotta move all you guys around again! Where'd you move to? Auburn street. See, I'll take you from here... And put you... There. [Clucking, barking] [Verman hollering] What's the matter with you, bad dog? If you don't stop chasing chickens, somebody'll tie a can to your tail! Bad dog! Everything ok out there now, verman? Ok, chief. Good. [Bangs gavel] We will now take up the question of new operators. Has any of you fellas any suggestions for proposing anyone? I have. I'd like to propose Dan hickey. He's a good guy. Yeah! Yeah! He's kind of skinny. Well, maybe. But he's a regular guy, and he's mentally and intell... Intellectually. Well, anyhow, he's a darn brainy kid, and I think we can use him. Yeah, but he only weighs 64 pounds. You mean with all his clothes on? Yeah, that's not enough for his height. Why, he's taller than I am. Well, we can fatten him up. I'll get him my mother's diet list. She took it to get thin and gained 15 pounds on it! Ok, what do you say? Let's vote on him. All those in favor, thumbs up, and those against, thumbs down. Well, I guess he's in. Notify him and send him an application blank. Anybody else? Uh... I'd like to propose Rodney bitts. [All hollering] [Gavel] Order! Order! Order! First crack out of the box, he'd hightail it over to his old man's bank and start blattin'. You mean lying'. Now wait a minute, fellas. Just because I had a fight with him... Well, he had no business picking on verman! I know, but remember this: We're g-men, and a g-man can't let his feelings influence his personal judgment. If you think Rodney would be a good operator, why... Then maybe he would, if we took him in hand and trained him right. It's up to you to take him in with us. If you ask me, he's still a pain. [Gavel] Order. We'll put him through the ropes. You never can tell. He may turn out to be a regular guy under our system. He's still a pain. [Gavel] Order! We'll vote on him. All those in favor, thumbs up; Those against, thumbs down. Well, I guess that settles that. [All hollering] [Humming] Oh, Delia, you'll make some hollandaise for the asparagus. Mr. schofield's so fond of it. If he don't quit eating all those fancy sauces, he's gonna lose his waistline. But you will make it? You know, penrod likes it, too. [Giggling] I kind of like it myself. [Door closes] Oh, there you are, dear. You're a little late, aren't you? Yep. Why, what's the Shouldn't be here. I bumped into Tevin the other day and he seems to remember you and Tuck packing a couple of shovels in a car a couple of days before we got busted. Don't know what he's talking about, man. See, that's gang property, Bren, and it's not doing anybody any good sitting wherever it's at. We need it working for us. We need it in the streets helping us build back up. If Tuck did it, I don't know where it is, okay? See, I wish that I could believe that. Probably should think about this some more. I don't need to think on it, E. You like these people, huh? This place you are now? You like the people you hanging out with now, huh? Seems like a nice place, nice people. And that girl... she real fine. What's that mean? Take it easy, baby. We just having a general conversation, that's all, B. County clerk's office. Hi, I'm looking for information on how to purchase a house. I checked the website that lists properties that have a tax lien. Do you have a parcel ID number? Yes, ma'am, 13004201. Please hold. Yes, ma'am. Brendan, Brendan King. Okay. Natalie, I know you've already locked down a band for the auction, but if you're looking for an opening act, you should check us out. We play mostly alternative rock... I thought we discussed this. Oh, I forgot you're the gatekeeper to the student council now? No, we just don't need an opening act for the auction. Fine, I was just throwing it out there... Shhh! No, I'm sorry. So what do I do? I just go down there and... okay. All right. Thank you. Thirty-five. Thirty-five dollars? They do realize the place isn't even worth 35 cents, right? Yeah, well, how it works is we can go down there and file a petition for it and that sort of makes it ours. But then we have 60 days to come up with the rest. Last year's auction raised $3,500. So, how much to file for a petition, Brendan? Ten dollars. We're gonna do this. Hey, sweetheart. - Hi. - Hi. I talked to Stan today. That job's coming open. Anne Marie's going on maternity leave. I told them I'd discuss it with you. I don't think it's time yet. Yeah, but when we talked about it a couple of days ago, you said it might be. I know. This could be a good thing, Vanessa, getting back to work. I worry. You're out here in the garden a lot, but sometimes it seems to me I mean, you grow all these beautiful flowers... Maybe it's time for you to bring them to some other places, you know, back to the school, back to work, back to church, back to your friends who care about you. I talked to Russell about Brendan. Okay. This was supposed to be about healing? Well, this does not feel like healing to me. It feels like more pain. Vanessa, you don't have to fear the boy. He left that world behind the day he was saved. - Saved? - Mm-hmm. Is that it, Mike? The dark clouds part, the sun shines down and the choir rejoices in song. I didn't... I... Sweetheart. Got a second? What's up? That's what I'm wondering. Lot of stories flying. I've got nothing against you personally. You did a cool thing helping Natalie but some of the stuff I heard you're into, she doesn't need to be around that. You're right, she doesn't. She won't. Good.

If you don't mind me asking, what happened to your family? Sorry. No, it's... my mom died, drugs. And my dad, I don't know who he is. Any brothers or sisters? How does anyone make it through that? My parents are divorced but I know who they are, I know where they are. Is that like a girlfriend tattoo? No, it's kind of like something to remind me of how I got here. A broken heart? It's a mended heart. Is that a cross in the middle? Yeah, I kind of messed that part up. I like that it's not perfect. There. What's the worst thing you've ever done? Well, I've made a lot of bad decisions, but at least I never killed anybody. It's just, um, I'm not proud of them. I have to go. Hey, wait. Natalie, hey, hang on. Hey, hang on. Whatever it is you're going through, you don't, you don't have to do it alone. Brendan... yeah, I do. You're not returning my texts. You thought I would? You said friends, right? I broke up with you. You should hate me right now. Well, I can't. We never really talked about things, about the accident and the other stuff. I don't know what else to say. You're not answering any texts, any calls and anyone sees you outside school, you're hanging out with the Seekers. Yeah, you used to go out and have fun and now something's changed. So what are you saying? You can't tell me you're having it with the Seekers. So it's official then, you've become one of them. Maybe I have. Really? How's Natalie doing these days? Why don't you ask her yourself, man? She doesn't talk to me much lately and when she does, it doesn't sound much like the Natalie that I know. What is it with you? You saved her life, now maybe you think you can save her soul? I mean, isn't that what you guys do in your club? Huh? Let me make this as straight as I can for you. Stay away from her! I don't want any trouble. Yeah, see, I've been on the field against teams loaded with city trash waving their tats and their thug signs. They ain't so bad when it's an even playing field. When they don't have the posse and the hardware. What about when they do got it? Eli, it's okay, man. Yeah, it's okay, bro. Yeah, I know. Got your posse here, don't you? - Put the gun down! - I'm sorry! You got my man outnumbered four to one. Hey, put it down! - Huh? It's more even now, right? - I'm sorry. I know you're sorry. So what you're gonna do is go give my man an apology. I... I apologize. - Put it down. - I ain't buying it. - Say it on your knees. - Enough. - On your knees! - I apologize! Back off! Get out of here, man. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What I don't get is why you taking this from them. and start waving guns in people's faces. Wow, you got stale in the joint, bro. Come on, you're taking a ride with me. No, man, I'm getting out of here. - Curfew. - Curfew? You don't get it do you? They ain't never gonna accept you out here. You'll always be trash.

Why is that? the behind the music special on me, you can tell them, "I remember meeting Sheedy in the hallway. that his band had just gotten the gig at the charity auction. " - Seriously? - Totally. But I thought they already had a band. Well, they backed out. Would you mind helping me hand out these flyers, though? Isn't that your publicist's job? That's cold, man, that's cold. Hmm, you think that's him right there, right? Yeah, I know that's him. - We got a winner. - Hey, I'm on it. Bad day for a bike ride. I'd say so myself. You want me to keep following him or should I get him now? Yeah, we follow him. Stay close. When we hit him, we hit him hard. Got it. Did you get a look at these guys at all? How many, height, weight, what they're wearing? I really didn't see that much. Hey, Mr. Stubbs. Hey, buddy. How you doing? I'm doing all right. Brendan, don't I look pretty. It is an improvement. Hey, Russell. Mike. Look, I just got one more question for you. We got some security video from the school, caught a glimpse of a van driving pretty fast around the time you were hit. Black van, ring a bell? Look, I really don't remember that much. Give it time. - It'll come back to you. - All right. - Mike. - Yeah. Look, thanks for coming, guys. Yeah, we'll have you back in math class in no time. Brendan? I heard about Chris. I feel so bad. About the other day, I'm sorry I just took off like that. It's cool. I guess I just got scared of what you'd think of me if I told you. Well, you don't have to be. Yeah, I do. It'll change things. Maybe you're playing it just right then. Keep whatever it is buried inside and let it eat away at you until you can't feel or care about anything at all. Yeah, maybe you're right. Natalie? Natalie! Hey, wait! Natalie? I got pregnant last year. I didn't tell anybody. Zack didn't know, or my mom. It was a mistake, but it happened and I dealt with it. I thought it was for the best. Thing of it is I didn't think I was strong enough to have a baby, but now I don't think I'm strong enough to carry this emptiness. I'm not sure of anything anymore. But please, don't tell me faith can fix me, because I cut myself off from God forever. It's okay, I promise. It's okay. Brendan around? He's not here right now. You know, I think it's really nice what you guys are doing for him, the way you gave him a second chance after all the trouble he's been through, you know. Not like it's his fault, though. Kind of like a dog that's bred to be vicious. Can't help it. I think you should leave. See there's a funny thing about fighting dogs, 'cause no matter how many times you try to save them, there's not enough TLC on the planet that can keep him down. Sooner or later, they'll turn. I said he's not here right now. You tell Brendan... Eli says, hey. My mom has this vision of what she wants me to be. I'm afraid that if I tell her, that vision will be destroyed. What about Zack? Where does that stand? Where does that stand? It stands still with Zack. My whole life feels like it's been standing still and then you showed up. You really need to talk to Zack. Yeah. Mom? ♪ You and I will pull the tide and steal the sand ♪ ♪ From beneath your toes ♪ ♪ and bring you closer to the center of the world ♪ ♪ and the center of you ♪♪ Yo, E, it's me. Yeah, we gotta talk. Looks like the transformation stuck, 'cause he ain't the same old, G. What's up, Bren. So this is it, huh? Man, we was family, bonded through blood. Blood that we spilled, blood that we saw spilled because Tuck bled out in front of both of us. You got something you wanna say? Yeah, you wanna hurt somebody, hurt me. That's all you got, huh? E, what you're looking for isn't the answer. Let it go, man. You cannot let go who you are. I did and it's so much better. You can, too, life is supposed to be good, Eli. You've got to be kidding me. Listen, I promise you there is a hope so great that it changed me and it can change you. Last chance, stop trying to save me and save yourself and your new people. You don't have to do this. Did you hear that? - Hmm? - What was that? Can't sleep? Mike. Huh? - Brendan's not back. - Hmm? Mike, Mike! What? Brendan, Brendan! - Brendan. - I'll call 911. No, they'll put him away. Brendan. Help me get him up! Vanessa, help me, please! Don't let him fall. Don't let him fall off the back. Watch his head. Looks like they've gotten to him pretty good. I don't wanna bring this in here. I don't want this in here. Vanessa, we already have. I'm gonna call the police. Vanessa, help me, please. You know what to do, I don't. - Oh, I'm sorry! - Shh... There's no way for me to know what is going on, if there's internal bleeding or anything, I don't know that. Okay, easy, easy, easy. I need a cover. It's okay, buddy. Relax, Brendan. It's okay, it's okay, relax. Ice pack. Place it right over there. Two minutes on, two minutes off this area. This is all I can do. Okay. Hello, County. Detective Russell Dwyer, please. I haven't seen him yet, ma'am. It's a bit early. Can I help you? When will he be in? His shift starts at 7:00. Oh. Is there a message? Ma'am? No, no message. It's okay, son. I know what you set out to do, you know, I do, but it's too much. I mean, first the car, the house, now this? - V... - Listen! The boy needs to be under the care of a doctor! He needs to be in a hospital! Hospitals ask questions. You know that. He's aged out of the system. This is his last stop. Then what? He goes back out to the streets? If that happens, Mike, it's not our fault. It's not on us. Maybe not, but it feels like it is. I have always been surrounded by men who could never turn their backs on people in need and I guess I should feel like that's a blessing, but I feel abandoned! Lewis never abandoned you. Well, then why am I here and he's not? Oh, really, V, really? You're not here in any sense that I remember. Lewis was taken, but then you've gone and given everything else away. I was abandoned by whoever I was praying to all those years. Why did he let it happen? Why? I mean, I have tried, Mike, I swear to you I have tried to believe that there's a reason. I mean, there's a reason for everything, right? That's what we're always telling ourselves, right? Well, I can't think but that maybe the only answer is that there is no answer! there's just random chaos and that's all there is. Lewis's death was a tragedy, but God will use it for a better purpose. I believe that, V, I really do. I know. Now, we can turn away from this kid or we can turn to him. I wish I could believe like you believe. It's been a long, long, long, long road and I... I really don't know anymore. I just don't know. V... No, I can't, just let me get... He was in a fight. Where? Don't know. He's not saying. He got roughed up pretty bad, though. Can I see him? He's resting now and I'm not so sure he'd want you to see him like that. He didn't say what happened? I'll tell him you stopped by. Maybe I should help you with that. I got it. Look, it's not a request. Just take a break. I'll do it. Okay. Thank you. Hey! Hey! What happened with you and Brendan? What? Did you get in a fight with him? No, but he's been in a fight, got hurt pretty bad. Wasn't me. What do you see in him anyway? With all his baggage, where is he really going? He's turned his life around. Right, through Jesus. What is it that you don't like? or someone that has a relationship with God? Both. Some kids just substitute the God thing in for whatever else they've been using or abusing, instead of whatever other kind of crazy they were before. Some are downright scary, not to mention being the biggest hypocrites. Brendan's not crazy and he's not a hypocrite. You haven't known him long. He could just be using you, using your issues and his religion thing for whatever he wants. Stop calling it a thing, a God thing, a religion thing. It isn't a thing to him, it's a way of life, a way to life when he was headed for death before. Listen to yourself! You sound like a Bible thumper. I'd rather sound like anybody in the world right now than what you sound like. Just be still. Be still, Brendan, shh. You're safe. Shh. Shh... shh. Morning, V. Russell. I was passing on my way to work and the scent of that omelet stopped me in my tracks. Well, you know what? You can just have half of this one. That sounds good. Hey, listen, you didn't happen to call my number at the station the other morning? Me? Yeah, caller ID put the number here. What call where? - Hey, morning, Mike. - Morning. Did you call the station the other morning? Did I? Look, if there's something you wanna say, I'm all ears. Nothing to be afraid of. Is that kid causing you some trouble? Brendan? No. Oh! My brain. It was me. I did call you. Yeah, you know you were telling us about that rec center? Yeah. Well, Mike and I discussed it and we want to donate some of Lewis's things. - Right. - Yeah. You're starting to part with some of Lewis's things. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Well, did you get it? Did I get what? The rec center's number. No, not yet. Thank you. Brendan really thinks that he's gonna take the house. That should be and could be making us a whole lot of money. And make a clubhouse. Make it hot, Lex. You wanna play games? Breaking news this morning, firefighters were busy in the city last night with a suspected case of arson. A fire apparently started shortly before 2:00 a. m. at a house on Scio Street. They put it out about 15 min... How you feeling? Can I get you something to eat, drink? Sure. Brendan, you know that house that you guys were working on? There was a fire. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey. Look, I didn't mean to just pop in on you. I just wanted to know you're okay. Here, I got something for you. It's not a big deal, just saw it at the mall last week and... Brendan? - I can't take this. - What? Brendan, we'll find another house. We'll start all over. I'll talk to student council. We can still use the auction to support this. If you're trying to scare me, it's working. Maybe you should be scared of me. Yeah, well, you would be if you know what's inside me. What does that mean? Come on, you can tell me anything. Brendan, will you please say something? Why don't you say something? Say something to Zack, say something to your mom. Let them know what you're dealing with. They're the ones you should be concerned about. Forget about me, I'm... You should just go, Natalie. That's it? After everything? Packing? I put you and Vanessa in a bad spot, Mike. You wanna tell me what's going on? I helped a friend bury some stuff before we got arrested. Drugs. The guys that beat you up, they know that? Yeah, and they're gonna hurt some people if I don't get it back to them, people close to me. Like Sheedy, like the house that they burned down. - Then give it to them. - It's not that simple, Mike. If I had it my way I'd let it stay buried, let it rot, but they won't let that happen. it's out there on the streets hurting people and ruining lives and I won't let that happen. That doesn't leave you many options, does it? Only one that I know of. Only one because you're only listening to your own voice. You're shutting out God. Can't you see that? Yeah, I did that, too. When they took away my baby boy, I turned my back on God, tried to handle it on my own. I held my thumb out for a way out, Mike, and it didn't come, okay? So now I gotta do this my way. - It is not too late, Brendan. - I gotta go, Mike. No, no, you wanna make this a fight of flesh and blood, but it's not. It's spiritual with the powers of darkness. The enemy is afraid of what you can truly become. You need to turn this over to God right here, right now. Mike, I gotta go. - Put the bag down. - Mike... Put it down! Sit down. Sit down! Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways, submit to him and he will make your paths straight. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all. He will fight this fight for you, son. I know. We should talk to Russell. You come on down when you're ready. Brendan! Where in the city is he going? I don't know. Well, what do you know, Mike? What can you tell me? There's been a van hanging out here for the past couple of days, a black van. Here's the license plate. Look, I told you this is a bad idea Russell, the kid's heart is in the right place. I've seen inside their hearts, Mike. The day I found Lewis on the side of the road. No, no, that's not what it is! Yeah, it is. It's not your fault, Russell. - What? - Lewis. Look, I'm talking about Brendan, Mike, not Lewis. in every conversation we've had for the past four years. - Oh. - You and Vanessa both. I told you once and I'll tell you again, Lewis did not become a cop because you encouraged him or you nudged him. He became a cop because he wanted to! It's not on you, Russell, and you don't have to make it your mission to protect Vanessa and me. Well, it feels like I do. You got to let it go. All right, where is it? Should be right here. Should be where? Look, we buried it 15 feet from that tree. - Calm down. - I said it's under here. Let's dig. That's what we came to do. Just shut up and dig, man. You shut up. Let's go. You guys been fighting like little girls since you joined the set. You know, we weren't happy doing what we had to do, Bren. It hurt, man. I just want you to know. You are a brother to us. And Lex, you're digging incredibly slow. Rish, will you help him, please? Yo, this dude's playing us, E, there's nothing in here. Calm down, all right, because Brendan knows what happens when people play me. Come on, dig, man. This is empty, man. Brendan, where's the box? Oh, yeah. And the gong sounds, tough guy. That's the music I was waiting to here, come on. Funny how the memory works, huh? Yeah, yeah, it's supposed to be heavy. This is what you do for family. Let me see it. Got your blade? Back up. Get up! Get over there. Get up! - Get on your knees. - All right. All of you. What are you doing, Brendan? You're not gonna shoot us... Oh, come on, man, take it easy, Brendan, take it easy. Get the brick, Lex, and put it back in the cooler. Close it up. This is not how you treat family, Brendan. You ain't my family, Eli. Family's supposed to care about each other. All you ever did was care about yourself. This is gonna stop. This is gonna stop right now! Don't, man, don't. All right. Just take the stuff, all right, take it and go. I don't want it, Eli. Don't, don't. Just get out of here. Get the box. Get the box. This ain't over, Bren. And you know it. You never came to bed. I couldn't. Just hope he's all right. I thought for sure I heard him come back last night and when I looked outside, it was the car next door. And if it was him, would you let him stay after everything now? This scares me, Mike, it does. I wouldn't let anyone hurt you. He was addicted to this game. Tried to teach it to me a million times. I could never seem to get the hang of it.

What are the odds? I don't know. You're the odds man. Oh, they got to be 1,000 to 1. Where'd you get those bruises on your face? Vanessa and Mike know you're here? No. Well, maybe you could clear a few things up for me. We caught the guys that ran into your buddy, Sheedy. - When was this? - Early this morning. Exit the vehicle slowly! On your knees! On your knees! Hands on your head! Mike called, said he saw a black van hanging around the house a couple of nights ago. Pegged the plate to a T. And get this, they were old buddies of yours from downtown. Crazy, huh? You wanna know something else? They were driving around with a cooler full of heroin. Looks like those boys are going back inside for a long time. What were they doing hanging around Mike and V's place and what does all this have to do with you? I didn't know what to do. You didn't know about the cooler? I thought I could handle it on my own. I shoulda came to you. I'm sorry, I was wrong. You're sorry? You know what's supposed to happen now, don't you? Yeah. Well, what are you doing here? Turning yourself in? I guess so. Go home, Brendan. Mike and V are looking for you. For the record, I still got you at 90%. Doesn't mean I'm not pulling for you, but I'm not betting on you yet. You all right? Yeah. Just stick this right on the end, okay? - Got it? - Yeah. Everything okay? Everything, uh, worked itself out. You hungry? Uh... yeah. Give me a hand with this. Sure. Let's eat. All right. Hello, Sandra. How are you? Ta-da. Not broken anymore. How does it feel? Like rubber. How are you making out? Well, I've never been auctioned before, so kind of weird, I guess. Don't worry, my sources tell me that someone cracked open their piggy bank and dropped some serious coin on you. I talked to my mom and Zack. I'm glad. - Step one, right? - Yeah. I don't wanna give up on this, Brendan. - On any of it. - Me neither. You think he's gonna be all right? I think he's gonna be just fine. Ready for this? I guess so. Hold tight, Brendan. Greater things are yet to come. Everyone, put your hands together and welcome this year's nominees. Everyone has their number. Mine is holding at 18. If you would have told me that last year I would have had my doubts, but I'm still here. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I know that I don't have to walk it alone.

Willie: How are you? Nucky: Where are you calling from? Willie: Philadelphia. I'm in philadelphia and... Nucky: Willie, is something wrong? Willie: I need your help. ( chirping ) Nucky: Eddie! Eddie, are you up there? Eddie. - Eddie? - ( knocks ) Tom: Mr. Thompson. - Have you seen him today? - No. Bring the car around. Make it quick. Would you like some? You can say yes or no. Doesn't obligate you to anything. No, thank you. You're welcome. Sounds funny, doesn't it? - How's that? - He said, "no, thank you." I said, "you're welcome." doesn't sound right. Uh... Sound right to you? You do not say "you're welcome" When someone says "no, thank you." Why? Because they have not accepted anything from you. His english is better than yours. Heck, I guess it is. Where did you learn it? Did you study it over in prussia, I guess you would have called it? Why am I here? - Why do you think you're here? - I do not know. People don't get hauled off the street for no reason, do they? Do they get hauled off the street for no reason? I am not a policeman. - No one thinks you're a policeman. - We're the policemen. I have done nothing wrong. You had a pistol up your sleeve. - That is for protection. - Against who? Apaches. What do you think we should do? Don't see what choice we have. Darn it. Darn it to heck. Yeah. I may leave? - You almost fell. - I am fine. You don't look fine. You look very unsteady. I think you should stay here for a while. For your own good. Give bill pflaum the broom And he'll sweep cicero clean. Stand beside bill, And he'll stand up for you. A straight town is a healthy town. Healthy for your family and healthy for you. So let's shake hands... Why must they disturb the people so early? It's election day, dear. They have the right to campaign. They should not make so much fuss And do what they are told. That wouldn't be very democratic. Everybody is talking always. Everybody has the opinion. - Nothing gets done. - Dada. - He must eat. - He doesn't want any more. He does not know what he wants. ( car horn honking ) Your friends have returned. Built this whole thing yourself? The rosetta model. Put some grass down there. Spruce it up. That's the summer project. ( whistle blows ) Time for the morning shift. Let's go, george. Gonna be a good day. ( wings fluttering ) How are you, will? I'm okay. A little shaken? No, I'm-- Yeah. We'll sort this out. That's the first thing you need to know. Do my parents-- Right now this is between us. I'm gonna do my best to keep it that way. They haven't charged you yet. That's very good. Why can't I leave? There are reporters upstairs living in the lobby Just looking for something to do. You can walk out of here a suspect in a capital case. They'll smell that in a second. Or you can walk out like someone who just paid a parking ticket. That's what we want. You need to give me a little time. But you-- You know people in philadelphia, right? I do and I'll call on them. If that's what's required. I'll make it up to you. I swear. Don't worry about that now. Let's talk about this boy. I didn't have anything to do with it. Let's just talk about him for a minute. ( faint music playing ) Now, now. Now, now. Hotel arlington. Yes, mr. Roy phillips, please. I beg your pardon? I don't see how that's any of your concern. How do I know he hasn't arrived since the last time I-- Yes. The same message. It's all right. Hey. - Hey, boss. - Frank: Clear a path, boys. - Hey, frank. - Morning. - How's it going, boss? - Frank. So I heard pflaum caught a couple last night. No, they just capped his knees. I don't know nothing about that. What about the guy that got his throat cut on 22nd? His whole throat? - Nah, only to here. - ( men laugh ) So he can still whistle, huh? ( men laugh ) That's a good one, frank. Let's check in on his highness. ( knocks ) ( snorting ) What are you doing? Training my flea circus. What do you think? Frank: Why don't you give it a break? What, like you ain't been touching it? We got business today. ( snorting ) What'd I just say? Don't do that. Al: What, you think I'm kidding? Put that thing away. What the fuck's he doing here? You asked for him, garibaldi. You liked the way he handled himself last night. I did? The woods! Daniel fucking crockett. Pow! ( mocking ) "you'd better run." ( laughs ) Hey, george, you know what day it is? - Election day. - April fools'. All the suckers, they're gonna find out that the joke's on them. You know who that includes? - I don't. - Guess. - I can't. - He likes flowers. - Mr. O'banion. - ( laughs ) Listen to him. Come here. Closer. Come on. I won't hurt you. You done bad things. I saw you. So have you. Yes, I have. But not to the guy I work for. You got a little wild streak. Huh? Let's see how you do today. Then we'll talk. 'cause there's some unfinished business with the florist. Leave all that for later. Al. Go out there, pick the 20 best men you can find, Take them over to the main gate at western electric. Help the voters make up their minds. You with us? He needs to ask his wife. I don't need to ask anyone anything. Ooh. ( laughs ) I think he wants to bite me. Respect the boundaries, huh? Still got that piece? You mean this? Hold on. Shouldn't be any need, but... Are you okay, then? Hey! Perk yourself up. I'm fine right now. Don't you want to be my friend? ( snorts ) Yeah! Who's gonna fuck with us, huh? Huh? ( growls ) Willie: We had a party. Nucky: Who's we? Just the fellas, My roommate clayton and me. - Some girls. - Uh-huh. There was liquor. Where'd that come from? Will, you need to tell me. It was... Mr. Doyle. Mickey sold you liquor? Why didn't you come to me? I didn't want you to know. But I know now. You see, will? The liquor came from me. I didn't know, and now there's a problem. I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. All right, mickey sold you liquor. You brought it back to school. It was just a party. Everybody was having a good time. The next morning, henry was-- He wasn't moving. I don't know. Did he drink a lot? As much as anyone else. - But he was the only one who-- - yes. How well did you know him? I didn't. I thought he was your friend. What? When we had dinner, you called him a friend. I don't have a lot of friends here, uncle Nucky. I'm going to talk to the district attorney. If he's just fishing, then I'll know it And it all goes away. What you have to do is pull yourself together And remember the truth. Let me ask you again, Was henry your friend? Yes. How much did he drink? A lot. Where'd you get the liquor? I didn't bring any liquor. Good. Man: Following an inspection of your domicile, The officer will submit a report-- Mrs. Darmody? Mrs. Darmody, are you all right? You're looking a bit peaked. I didn't sleep last night. I'm sorry to hear it. I wake up and I think, "must check on tommy." - I'm out of bed and I realize-- - yes. I realize he's not there. And there's no getting back to sleep. Not at all. After the officer submits a report, The court will make its final determination Regarding the question of custody. What do I have to do? You don't have to do anything. What the officer will be looking for is a true picture Of the home the boy would be returning to. I'm in a period of transition. A great deal of the furniture-- The furniture is not important. A gentleman I've been seeing, He's highly placed in an important national firm. A great deal of responsibility. He'd prefer not to have that bandied about. He prides himself on discretion. And his taste in decor is... May I trouble you for a glass of water? Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - It's all right. - I don't know what's wrong with me today. ( winces ) oh, dear. Here. Clench it tight for a minute. I must look quite a horror. Not at all. I'm just in such a state. You reach a point in life and you realize it's what you leave behind that matters. And the thought that tommy might not remember me at all, As if I never even existed. Best to take it one step at a time. Is there anything I can do to help my situation? - As I explained-- - I mean right now. Is there anything I can do right now? - Mrs. Darmody. - Yes? It would be in your best interest To leave these chambers immediately. I'm late for an appointment. Mr. Thompson. Eugene mulhearne. I'm an assistant district attorney. How do you do? Mr. Mulhearne, you're not who I want to see. The district attorney asked me to meet with you And answer any questions you might have. - Why isn't he here? - He had other obligations, regretfully. - You fellows are making a mistake. - How's that? Trying to turn a quirk of fate into what? A manslaughter charge? 10 separate witnesses say he brought liquor to that party. Is that really worth your time and effort? If that boy was poisoned, then yes. Where are you getting that from? His symptoms are consistent with poisoning. - Alcohol poisoning. - That's not what the coroner says. What's that got to do with my nephew? This office intends to find out. Let's cut the bullshit. Your boss and waxey gordon Had a conversation this morning at my request And it was agreed that this occurrence, Terrible as it was, isn't anybody's fault. That couple outside, They're henry gaines's parents. Mr. Gaines is a major contributor To the pennsylvania republican party. He's lost his son And he doesn't want to hear about life's random misfortunes. Someone's got to answer for this. We just don't have any choice. - How are we keeping? - I am fine. You are fine. I admire that kind of backbone. Does he know how tough you are? Who? Your boss, mr. Thompson. I understand. Good soldier. Really, the more I see of you, the more I like. But let me ask this-- Would he do the same for you? ( seagulls screeching ) You've been here all day, eddie. No one's asked for you. Not on the boardwalk, not over at the onyx club, Not in the speaks or the wire rooms. The world is going on without you. Nucky thompson is going on without you. And the only person who really cares what happens to you right now Is me. You are my friend? No, I am not. Then who are you? ( groans ) - That's who I am. - ( coughs ) And I'm going to own every last bit of you. ( coughing ) Clean yourself up. Nucky: Who was henry gaines? He was a friend of mine. Who brought the liquor? Beats me. How much did henry drink? A lot. Who slipped him the mickey? The what? The mickey finn. The knockout punch. Whatever was in there. I- - I don't, uh-- Willie, I have to ask you not to lie just now. It won't help. And frankly, I don't like it. I need to know what's true So we can agree on the rest. Understood? It was supposed to be a gag. That's all. Whose idea was it? Mine. Just yours? Willie. Clayton helped me. Your roommate? And henry? What did he do to deserve it? He thought he was better than me. But he wasn't. All right. Here's what I'm going to need you to do. Factory gates are there, Polling booth down that way. You know the situation. Make sure they vote for klenha Or don't vote at all. Most people, they don't want trouble. Who's the mayor, who's the president, What's it to them? We'll run this burg. Keep the green flowing. That's all anyone cares about. And o'banion? Lots of ways to do business. See how it plays out. Got the piece? Right here. Then hop to it. Hey. Don't worry about my brother, okay? Sometimes he just needs a good kick in the ass. Who's gonna do the kicking? It's an advance. Stick with me, huh? I'll put grass on your fucking lawn. I'm ready. Hello. There's no reason for this to get out of hand. All we need to do is remind them Why it's in their own best interest to elect the republican ticket. As each worker goes by, I want you to inquire - How he intends to vote. - Inquire? They already know what can happen And most people don't want trouble. I didn't come out for no tea social. - Al says give it to 'em good. - Al's not in charge here. - I am. - You ain't in charge of nothing. Man: I say we pick the first guy and clobber him. - We're doing it my way. - Or what? Go ahead and try. ( whistle blows ) - Coming through. - Coming through here. - Who you voting for today? - None of your damn business. - Voting republican, friend? - What's it to you? Got a minute? Hold on there. I'm talking to you. Just stop for a second, god damn it! - ( grunts ) - ( men shouting ) Move back! Move back! Come on. Johnny, go, go! Let's go, let's go! You see, none of this had to happen. Man: Move, move! Let me in! Let me in! Man #2: Get inside! - ( men chatting, laughing ) - ( music playing ) ( chatting stops ) ( man coughs ) I, uh... I'm looking for someone. I don't know his name, But I'm told he could be found here. I realize we've never met before. This is probably not how you normally conduct business, But I made some inquires. Here I am. You far from home, bo peep. Nothing is very far from anything here. Is it? You're gonna take the skin off. Who sent you around? Does that matter? I like to know where my customers come from. I spent several years on the stage. Do tell. - You know how show people are. - How are they? We like to keep our ears close to the ground. Well, what you got tucked up your little pouch there? May I examine the preparation first? No, you mayn't. That's all I've got. Then you find that lost sheep somewhere else. Perhaps we could discuss another form of payment? I'm having a difficult day, mr...? - Oxford. - Mr. Oxford. A very difficult day. Just one of those times When you need a little extra help. That's all this is. You best go easy now, little bo. I like my lambs keep coming home. Where I went? State normal over in trenton. Your aunt mabel was there. She was going to be a teacher. I didn't like the idea of other fellas Helping her with the classwork. So I thought I'd be a teacher, too. Why didn't you? The commodore needed me. And I came back home. There are more important things than what may Or may not have happened at some party. My father won't know? No one will know. ( door opens ) Mr. Thompson. Lawrence eisley. Mr. District attorney. Thanks for making the time. - Sorry for the mix-up earlier. - Not to worry. But I'm sure you can appreciate my concern. Oh, I'd feel the same way if it was my nephew. We want to get this cleared up before it turns into something. I completely understand. Well, young man, I'm told you might be able to help us With this unfortunate event. Nucky: You just tell them what happened As best you remember it. First thing I want to say is... Henry gaines was a pal of mine. ( bell ringing ) ( children chatting ) Teacher: No running. We are ladies and gentlemen here. Tommy, I've told you time and time again, walking. Darling. It's me. It's mima. Look at you. You're a beautiful little man. I'm going to kiss you hello. May I do that? Are you learning a lot here? That makes mima so happy Because she wants you to be smart. She wants you to be the smartest boy there ever was. Now, there's something I have to tell you. I met a man. A very sweet man. His name is roy. I think you're going to like him. We're all going to be together And that's going to make us so happy. Won't that be nice? All right. All right. I have something for you. It's-- here it is. It's an abba-zaba. ( laughs ) I don't know what that is, But I'm sure it's wonderful. And it's for you. And we're going home now. It's all been taken care of. You're going to come home with-- With me. Hello, julia. How are you? I'm very well. Are these your relations? They're teachers. Of course they are. - Well, then... - What are you doing here? Just bringing tommy home. He doesn't live with you anymore. Now, julia, that's for the judge to decide. We had a chat today and he was very forthcoming. Come on, sweetie. I'm here. No, no. This isn't proper. It's a beautiful day and this isn't proper. We're going to walk this way. Okay? And we're not looking back. - This way, ma'am. - Let go of me. - Let's go. Come on. - Let go of me. - You don't have the right. - Now, please. You can't just bleach me out like a laundry stain. - Let go of me. - Come on. I have to give him the abba-zaba. ( music playing ) Here it is. Not bad. It's okay. Ma put up the curtains. Can you play this? Not really. You need to find yourself a girl to serenade. Give you an incentive. Shut the door for a minute, will. - Uncle Nucky-- - No lecture. Just a few things I want to say. Whatever occurred, it's over. But every now and then you'll think About the terrible thing that happened to a boy Whose face you can't quite remember. I promise, you can live with it. Is that what you do? You're going to graduate. We'll get you into another school If that's what's necessary. It's not important now. You worry about what other people might say. You worry about someone you call a friend. None of that matters. The only thing you can count on is blood. The blood that's in your veins And the blood that's in mine. The people who discount you, They don't know who you are. The rage you feel-- listen to me careful-- It's a gift. Use it. But don't let anyone see it. Know that I'm watching over you. Show me the person you intend to be. How much did you pay the district attorney? One day we'll talk about all that. Right now, you just need to stick to what we discussed And not worry about the rest. ( door opens ) I'm sorry. - You're clayton? - Yes, sir. You're willie's father? No, his uncle. Oh. How do you-- I'll come back later. - I was just-- - it's all right. I have to get back home. Remember what we talked about. It's good to meet you, clayton. Where the hell have you been all day? Didn't feel like going to class. Christ, will, everybody's talking about-- What are we gonna do? It's taken care of. What does that mean? It's been taken care of. He's dead, will. That's not just gonna go-- Clayton, I have to study. What? There's a test in commerce tomorrow And I have to study. So how about you leave me alone? ( men shouting ) Worker: Let's see what you got, tough guy. Mueller! Out of the way. Move. Move. What the fuck's going on here? A numerically disadvantaged situation. A what?

Why would somebody do something like that? ( crying ) ( seagulls screeching ) ( boat horn blaring ) The hell happened to you? What do you mean? You look like you slept on a bench. I spent the night with old friends. There was much drinking. Too much. And the night became morning. If you're going to disappear for an entire day-- king and Serbs, but you betrayed Serbia. And you're loyal to some lapsed general. You know what will happen to you. Gallows. I have nothing more to offer you. You give us general, we give you freedom. Think about it. All right. You became fine outlaws. All right. You're dressed well. You're looking good. Why are you growing your beards? Other than commandants that cannot, cover up with anything others don't have beards. How would you now walk across the villages? So, shaving. Mainly you learned everything. But still, check it. You! - I was in Kondor's corps, I came to Ras to Serbia, when we were defeated on Drina. You, how will you talk to the general. - Mr. general, lieutenant Mièiæ. I was in the mountain guard during the war. My father was in your headquarters before the war. - Great job. And you. How will you greet? - God bless you, Janko. - God help you. Listen, this will be your last cigarette. We roll tobacco there, understand? And now, one more important detail. You keep your knife here. Because you can use it swiftly. That's Janko's house. Vera's house is somewhere here too. God bless you, Janko. - God help you. Take me to the general. Who know where he is, Ras. - That's why I came to you. You know. You have to find him tonight. Without delay. His life is in danger. Where is Šerman? He got killed, like many others. These are my new followers. Listen good. I'll come at dawn. Don't wait me without general's message. All right, I'll do everything I can Ras. What are good news, Janko? Nothing good. Ras is down there with some jeeps and some men. Who are they? - I don't know. Ras. Let's go see general. Give me matches. I didn't believe it. - I did. Give me one tobacco. Let's go. What happened. Have you brought message from the general? - Yes. You have good followers. - And they have good commandant. Just three? - There's more of them down there. Janko didn't mentioned the others. Does Janko have to know everything? - All right, Ras. Let's go, general is waiting for you. Jovan. Keep your eyes open. - What do you mean, general? If anything happens... - What can happen? I don't know. Keep it on your mind. That's an order. If anything unforeseen happens, You'll shoot me. - Mr. general. Remember that. That's an order from your general. Our connections are cut here. - Oui. It will be 'Oui' when we get there. Ras does not allows to sleep at all. Welcome, Ras. These are my followers. I would like to speak with you in private. Come. Brothers, you want some tobacco. - Sure, need you ask? It's been a long time since we smoked decently. Take it. I came to take you to a safe place. Can't you see that someone is betraying us? There's few of us left, general. You have to believe your officers. - How come you think, Ras, that I have to go to your territory? You were always saying that it's better to go abroad and keep fighting from there. Those times are changed, general. Let's go on our territory. You have plenty of your men there. You can't leave them alone. Get ready brothers, move out. Ras is taking us to Serbia. And now my loyal Ras, tell me how did you became a traitor. Why did you brought me commies? How much did they pay you? How did you know general? I'm Doctor. From Belgrade Center for Communications. - Doctor. That's right. He sold us to them for some good money. He's lying! Son of a bitch. - Shut up. - He sold us, he did it. Yes, I turned him in to protect you. And brought him here. Him... And these OZNA people. He killed Perun. These four are their people. And these are my men. Tie him! Who are you going to tie... I hope that you believe me now Mr. general. Your doubts in me could've kill you. How do you know about my doubts. - Didn't you send Feliks, to kill me? And Feliks was their man from the start. He betrayed Vili, Schwarz, Perun. I killed him. Feliks too? Only you and Feliks knew where will Schwartz cross the river. And sure you didn't betrayed him. Disarm them. We must go, general. Army is very close. Move on! Army, get down. Oui. Fire! Fire - No. Don't shoot. You won't shoot you general right? Shoot, I'm telling you! Put down your weapon. Jovan. Shoot! It's an order! I'm ordering you, shoot! It's good, you're safe and sound general. You're wounded. Oui. Just to sleep a bit...

I don't understand this. We've always kept our academic averages so high. [breathing heavily] [indistinct chattering] Just a minute, you, not so fast. No, chief. Here. The boys' lavatory. She was such a terrific little cheerleader. Mr. Proffer, please, if there's any evidence, sir it's being trampled. (Podalski) 'Alright, watch it there.' 'Watch it, c'mon, step aside here.' Let me through there, c'mon. G-get away from that door. Get back, get back. And stay there! Chief Poldaski, don't you think there's too much, uh.. Evidence trampling.. Evidence trampling going on here. Alright, everybody stop trampling on the evidence. So, that means everybody. And shut up! Anyway, it was about uh, ten after 9:00. I remember English class had just started-- Say, ain't you, uh, ain't you the, uh.. ...the uh, football team water boy? I'm the student manager. Oh, uh, the water is carried by the, uh.. ...assistant student manager, chief. Yeah, well. Anyway, I went to use that cubicle right there. Say, how do you think the, uh team is going to do against Valley High, huh? Uh, I went into that-- - I went into this cubicle-- - 24 games straight. Oh, was it 44-45? - 45, I guess. - Oh, 45.

Starting right now. [blowing whistle] [siren wailing] McDrew. Yes. Oh, sorry. I was in the middle of a Humm Wadsworth test. What? Wait a minute, what happened? I don't know-- Tiger, did you hear about.. - Yes, I just heard. - What happened? - No, I don't know. - Do they who Jill.. [clamoring] Look, I'll tell you as soon as I come out. She was a fine girl and-and a really terrific little cheer leader. Gosh, you've come. Some of the parents are insisting we close the school and newspapers a-a-are demanding a statement. This is, uh, Mr. McDrew, our assistant principal. But I've know him my way as your football coach. I've seen you many time from across the field, McDrew. I'm Captain Sam Surcher. State Police, Investigation Division. How do you do? Sorry, I wasn't immediately available. Oh, he explained. You know, my kids are gonna be really impressed that I met Tiger McDrew. How long since Braddock High won a game from you folks? 'Four years at least, right? ' Yes, we've had quite a run of exceptional young men here. Young women, they're always one of the finest. - She's such a terrific-- - Little cheerleader. Damn it, Mr. Proffer don't you think she'd want to be remembered for something besides leading a bunch of stupid gals? Well, uh.. ...let's get our time sequence straight now. When you looked into the booth, uh, you recognized her. 'You turned, then you ran for help.' Well, actually, I didn't recognize her at first. Well, I was facing her from sort of an unusual angle. And I didn't recognize her till after she toppled over. Well, how did she topple over, son? Oh, I think I leaned on her. You leaned on her? How? When I bent over to read the note. What're you so.. What're you so nervous about? Because I...keep wondering maybe I did it on purpose. 'Did what? ' C'mon, kid. Tell us what you did to the body. I leaned my hand on her bottom, like I said. You think I'd do anything else to a dead girl? Haven't even had a live one yet. - Love life problems, huh? - What love life? I'm 17 years old, and I haven't touched a girl's breast yet. Well, maybe you haven't found the right girl. Now, something bugging you? I mean, like that.. Well, you're not worrying about acne or bad breath or anything? No, it's nothing like that. Nothing physical then. That's good. Perhaps, there is one physical thing I should've mentioned. I have kind of a problem with, uh.. ...you know, erections. Ah. Is the problem constant, Ponce, or does it vary? No, it's, uh, it's pretty constant. Well, I mean, does... anything seem to help? Well, yes, sir. They, uh... They don't seem to happen as often if I take cold showers. 'When I'm with a girl...' '...the only thing that help is to do' 'multiplication problems in my head.' 'But that kinda interferes with conversations.' Hello, Ponce dear. What a terrible experience finding the poor girl like that. Oh, hello, Mr. McDrew. I'm Ms. Smith, substitute teacher. 'Yes, I know.' Is there anything at all I can do for you? No, ma'am. How are you? Oh, I'm just fine, Mrs. Smith. Thank you. [orchestral music] Done. Very good. Incidentally.. ...I'm putting your name down for track, next semester. Oh, man. C'mon, Tiger, that sport scene is a drag. I don't know how you got hooked on it. You can't spend the rest of your life reading a book, Harold. An animal body needs animal exercise. I'm gonna teach you to feel, man. - To live. - Right. [dog barking] Hello, Yipper. Hello, boy. [upbeat music] Hello. Live around here? 'Could I offer you a drink? I live right there.' Um-hmm. Daddy, daddy. Mommy, did you tell daddy what I got form school? [chuckling] Hi, sugar plump. Hey, what's this school turning into? Oh, don't ask me. You heard, huh? - On the news. It's awful. - Shocking. Do the police have any clues? Well, I don't know. I talked to the inspector today. He didn't seem to wanna tell me anything. They never wanna tell you anything when they talk to you.. [swing music] Shopping? [bell ringing] Was she raped, Captain? Well, if you don't mind, I'll ask the questions. I'm surprised that embarrasses you. Well, isn't sex involved in many of the crimes you investigate? Yes, now and then. Now, about those boys, Jill used to date. Were any of those boys in the habit of calling her..."Honey"? - Yes. - Alright, who? Oh, well, probably, all of them. See, our generation's not afraid of feeling...affection. Or expressing it. For example... I love you. And I love you. And the world...must learn to love one another. Currently, that'll be all, Miss Lidia. - Hilda. - Hilda. 'Next.' - Good afternoon, Miss Millick. - Yvonne. Yvonne. Is this in every survey show that the police are oriented very conservatively? So are many Americans. Ponce. What if the police represents just one point of view? Well, that could be very dangerous. Oh, Ponce, hey. Is my dad dangerous 'cause he's conservative? Yes. Your dad doesn't have the powers of repression. 'Is the police repressive? ' [indistinct chatter] (male #1) Well, they deserve what they get, that's all. [bell rings] [indistinct chatter] - Tiger, didn't we.. - Excuse me. [indistinct chatter] Is there still a game on Friday? No, it hasn't been decided, yet. (male #2) 'Hey, what about practice? ' - Ponce, I'll see.. - Alright. Miss Smith. Excuse me. Hi, Mr. McDrew. Yeah, could we, uh, get together during, uh, fifth period? Yes. I mean, no, no. I'm not free but what I mean is, I'll-I'll make myself free. Yes. - Good. - Definitely. Okay. (Captain over recorder) 'In a typical high school, it will be difficult' 'to invent a system more destructive' 'of a child's natural creativity.' 'Only in the most backward penal institutions' 'does one discover equally oppressive rules of silence' 'restriction of movement' 'constant examination of behavior.' 'A world in which one must learn to work, eat, exercise' 'and sometimes, even defecate by the clock.' You mind? The coroner estimates that the girl was killed between 8 and.. Yes. I've said, I was here ...working on my book at that time-- Well, no offence, I hope. No offence taken. It's your job. For test result control. Some students are more easily distracted than others which might show up as low IQ or some defect which actually, isn't present. Uh, the principal tells me that.. he thinks, this guidance counseling is responsible for the academic average she had. Masters degree in psychology. That's quite impressive. Well, I understand that you've turned down a couple of offers to teach universities. Because I believe, this is.. ...as they say, "Where it's at." High schools are simply not reaching the student. For every college dropout we lose 15 to 18 in high school, Captain. The records on the dead girl. Anything in there that might be of help to us? I think, Jill fooled a lot of people. Not particularly intelligent, IQ 103. 'She seemed more intelligent because she adapted so well' 'to high school level activities.' - Quite beautiful, though. - 'Yes, extraordinary figure.' Excellent dancer. Baton twirler. What kind of men.. ...would a girl like this be attracted to, Tiger? 'Well, let me see.' 'I'd say, it's not impossible, she had marriage in mind.' As a psychologist, any comment on the note that was found on her...on her body? [bell rings] Out of my line. Disturbed personality, obviously. [indistinct chatter] [knocking on the door] - Hello, Miss Smith. - Hi. 'Mind locking the door? ' Put the switch too, will you? You know, I try to get in three minutes of this, everyday? 'You'd be surprised, how hard it is to find the time.' Ha. Would you like to pour us a drink? It's right over here. It's organic apples, brewers yeast, honey and a raw egg. Helps keep the old juices flowing. Oh, well, that's, uh.. that certainly is important to a teacher. - Cheers. - Cheers. We must have a real drink, sometime. - Or is there somebody? - No. I mean, there was, but we broke up. Pity. Sit down. Must be very difficult to be a single female teacher. Well, yes, I-I think, at times, we get even.. It's almost painful. Which makes me wonder if you can handle something I have in mind. Oh, yes. I mean, I-I, I'll certainly try to handle anything you might throw at me. As it were. - Ponce. - Pardon me? [bell rings] Oh, oh, Ponce de Leon Harper. Oh, yes. 12th grade, the boy who found the.. Yes. As you can see from his profile, he has enormous potential. Somehow, he's acquired a hang up about...sex. And I doubt if a girl his age could help him, now. And I was wondering, Betty, if you would? Uh...help him? Oh, I understand your hesitations. Could cut into your afternoons or evenings when you and I would meet and compare notes on Ponce's progress. Well, uh, yes. I guess, we would have to do that, wouldn't we? And now, let's see, as I understand it you, uh...you want me to help him? 'His problem is... sexual immaturity.' Oh. Yes, uh, well, that's.. that certainly is...a problem. And solution is... a mature woman's friendship. Oh. You want me to be his friend? You could start by inviting him to your apartment. Tell him, you wanna go over some assignment with him. It sounded at first as if, you wanted me to sleep with him. - Isn't that silly? Ha-ha-ha. - It's uproarious. I wonder, what you would have said. Well, now, if we started doing that with our students who knows, where it would lead? 'Well, we'd certainly get to know them better.' But I wonder, if it's ever justified. Say, in the case of a, of an exceptional student. But some teachers might do it for pleasure. Yes, I suppose there could be some-some whistling while we work. Could I be honest about something? Yes, of course. I hope you're not gonna ask me to invite him too often. 'At this age, uh, the boys are re-becoming men' and I don't see any point in being a.. In being uncomfortable. Well, there's no reason to be uncomfortable in Ponce's case. He confessed to me only this morning that he is totally impotent. Oh, the poor child. Yes, tonight. Can you? I thought, you might want to expand your notes on Milton into a term paper. See you later then, Ponce. [engine starts] Well, it's hard to answer has anyone made any unnatural sexual advances toward me. Perhaps, if the captain were to rephrase the question, Pamela? No, I think, I understand the question. 'I don't understand the word unnatural in this context, sir.' Well, I am having to ask all the girls. The thing is, if a boy didn't make sexual advances toward me I think that would be pretty unnatural. No, that's not quite what I'm getting at, Miss Wilcox. Perhaps, if the captain were to rephrase the question, Pamela? No, I think, I understand the quest--. Okay, okay. Alright, thank you very much. Thank you. Next. - Sit down, Miss.. - Sonny Swangle. 'Swangle. Swangle.' Has anyone made any...unnatural, sexual overtures to you? [giggling] You kidding? Oh, really? Oh, God. [Swangle laughing] [door bell rings] Oh, hi, Ponce. Come on in. [clock chiming] I just know, we're gonna be good friends. 'Yes, ma'am.' Now, shall we start out by discussing what you think about Milton. - Milton who? - John Milton, silly. 'Paradise Lost, remember? ' You were saying about Milton? - Well, he was a great poet. - Go on. Well, he-de, he-describes the way in heaven from which Satan was expelled. And his evolution into the devil. 'Avenging himself by..' ...by corr-by corrupting his most... finest creation, woman. I mean, mankind. [ambient music] 'Guard your queen.' Mate. [Jean chuckles] "I fled, but he pursu'd "though more, it seems, inflam'd with lust than rage and swifter far, Mee overtook his mother all dismaid." "And in embraces forcible and foul engendering with me "of that rape begot these yelling monsters "that with ceaseless cry, surround me, "as thou saw'st hourly conceived "and hourly born with sorrow, infinite to me. "For when they list into the womb that bread them they return and howl and gnaw my bowels, their repast." - Isn't this exciting? - Oh, yeah. What's the matter, Ponce? Now you don't think I'm going to eat you, do you? Oh, yes. Ah, no, Miss Smith. Oh, come. Let's make some hot chocolate. - Oh, well, I'll just wait here. - No, come with me, Ponce. Okay, well, I'll bring the text along in case you'd like to read through. You've had enough Milton for one day. Let's have some hot chocolate. - Coming, Ponce? - Yeah, hmm. Miss Smith, may I please be excused? (Miss Smith) 'To your left and through the bed room.' 'The girl has no diary, just letters.' - Let's get cracking. - These were all pen-pals? It's a wonder she didn't die of writer's cramp. 60 times 60 is 3660.. (Miss Betty) 'Ponce, are you alright? Chocolate's getting cold.' ...3721, 62 times 62 is.. Listen to me, Ponce. I'm hardly worthy of being a teacher if I can't discuss any problem a student has. Please, come out. [sigh] Ponce dear.. ...I happen to know that your are struggling with a sexual problem. - Is that it? - Yes, ma'am. Well, I'm going to be equally honest with you. The reason I invited you here was to help you. You must be putting me on, Miss Smith. Come, let's sit down and talk about it. - Please. - Oh, I can't. Ponce, you are a handsome, healthy boy and everything is going to work out alright. You mustn't worry. You must continually believe that. You.. Ponce, would you be more comfortable discussing it in the living room? - Please. - Oh, my goodness. - 'Oh, my goodness' - Ma'am? Isn't that just wonderful? Well.. We certainly have ended this night on a note of triumph. Haven't we? 'I got it.' Son of a bitch! Damn. (man on TV) 'After two days of intensive investigation' 'the police are still without a suspect' 'on the Ocean Front High School murder.' Jule Fairbun, a lovely 17 year old senior at Ocean Front was found dead in the boys' lavatory by a fellow student. [no audio] Chapter 14. Love, life and learning are what education's all about. Yet, somehow, schools begin backwards by teaching places, names, formulas. 'Instead, we should teach a passion for living.' 'A love for our world and ourselves' 'which would set students reveling in discovery.' 'And in this century, which mankind seems racing' 'toward a new dark ages, at best' if not annihilation.. [doorbell ringing] (Jean) 'I'll get it, hon.' Our schools may become our last chance. Indeed, our last minute chance to turn mankind towards truth, joy and love. It's Captain Surcher, hon. He says it's important. We got a couple of questions, McDrew. 'And they couldn't wait till morning.' Remember the words of the note left on the body? "So long, honey." Yes, puzzling. Which led us to believe that the killer was a psychopath. 'But, uh... Listen.' "Dear Jill honey, how uptight they'd all be if they knew." "Oh, you honey. This man needs you, I'll defy them, will you?" [playing piano] Signed? First let me make my position very, very clear. Nobody, but nobody is gonna get away with murder. But the last person I'd want it to be is one of the black students. 'It just opens up that question of police prejudice and..' It's signed "Greeny." Isn't that the nickname of one of your quarterbacks, Jim Green? Yes, but I'm sure you'll find he was in the-- We checked. This week, he's clean-up monitor in the chemistry lab. He was in there alone this morning. 'Listen, can I get a sample of his hand writing? ' 'I mean, homework or something like that.' 'I wanna make absolutely certain before I make a move.' [piano music continues] It's Jim's handwriting. Alright, then we'll have to pick him up. Well, if he killed her in the chemistry lab downstairs why would he deposit the body in the second floor can? Perhaps because it's furthest routes away from the assembly and the school office area. We'll check out the timing, but I was hoping that you were gonna tell me something I don't know. I am. He's not your killer, promise you that. As his friend, as his teacher.. ...and as a skilled psychologist. Alright, I'll hold off. Yes. Oh, by the way. I was talking over some of your ideas with my two sons. And they told me to give you a message. "Right on, man. Right on."

[singing continues at distance] Oh, dear, this is terribly embarrassing. Oh.. '21 second to here.' - Oh.. - 24 seconds to here. You stay like this. I want him to carry you in there. But I've never been in a boy's lavatory before. [screams] Freeze! Poldaski.. [blowing whistle] Well, I was waiting for the killer. A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. [vehicles honking] - Can we talk about something? - Sure. I went to see Miss Smith last night. (female #4) One...two...three.. You mean, if a women compliments you on your erection? Well, that should mean she kind of likes you, right? Yes, it.. ...it does sound like a warm friendship development. Say what? Honest, she said "It's splendid, Ponce, it's just lovely." Then, she shoved me out the front door. Tiger, am I crazy? I think we've cured Ponce. What happened? Well, we discussed Milton and had hot chocolate. No, no, no. I mean, what did you do to cure him? 'Well, nothing really.' He just, uh... bloomed as it were. Well, something stimulated the boy. What was it? I don't know. Now your next meeting, you should watch him carefully. Note the exact moment he's aroused. Ah, excuse me, but I prefer not to. Why? Well, it's difficult to put into words, but, um.. Well, after Ponce left last night I, uh... I had a miserable evening. Oh. 'He's a very attractive boy.' And I just can't go through all that again. I'm sure you're exaggerating, Miss Smith. Tiger.. ...I broke up with my boyfriend 13 months ago. It's so easy to escape that kind of discomfort. I'm surprised you don't know the method. - You don't, do you? - Method? No. Well, let me demonstrate it. Now it's terribly important that you not think of affection. Are you not familiar with this experiment? No, no, I can't say that. Well, it's a reverse on basic Masters and Johnson. The whole trick is to maintain an observers point of view. Oh. Now, since you are treating these sensations as a interesting physical phenomenon you'll notice it's impossible for me to excite you. - Ha. Yes, I noticed. - I see. You see, sex is much more than just touch. It certainly is. Not that there isn't art to touch. I mean, this can be quiet pleasant. Yes, it could be...pleasant. You are now responding to me intellectually, analytically. I am? Now notice the difference when emotion replaces analysis. Now let's try the same thing with affection. - Are you ready? - Yes. - Lock the door. - What? Lock the door. Betty, I love you. - I want you. - Oh, I want you. [whispering] I need you. Oh, Tiger. Tiger.. There, I'm sure you get the general idea. - Tiger, wha-- - 'Let's see.' 'I believe I have some test scheduled this period.' With that...body of yours, it was certainly difficult to remain analytical. Oh, hello, Pam. Be with you in a minute. Uh, could we continue this uh, discussion later today?

Look, Jim, I mean, all you have to try to do is is to make sense out of the written word. 'What is the author trying to say? You know.' 'Look.'

I mean my mother is rich my father's dead. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Six years ago. - Oh. - Just like that. I mean, when nobody was really expecting him to. - I see. I am sorry. - I am too. I'm sure you miss him. No, I mean, yesterday when.. Oh, no, oh, Ponce, you know that's, that's fine. I'm sorry for what I did. - No, no, that's good-- - For what.. - I'm sorry for what happened. - It should happen all the time. Don't, uh, don't be sorry about that. That is just fine. I'll see you tomorrow, Miss Smith. I got some work. Oh, goodnight, Miss Smith. (Tiger) 'Where did you tell them you were going? ' (female #5) 'Majorette meeting.' (Tiger) 'You should've brought your baton.' I told them I'd borrow one. [rock and roll music] Here? On the football field? Oh, dynamite. Did you ever wanna say to the world... I defy you? [door bell ringing] (Miss Smith) 'Just a minute, please? ' Miss Smith, I'm sorry but I forgot.. You forgot what, Ponce? I forgot... My keys! I don't see them anywhere. Perhaps if you retrace your steps, come in, Ponce. I was just getting into bed. Now let's see you came in Uh, gave me the duck and then you sat down. Oh, the duck. Oh, yes, it's out there. Oh, I'll walk home. I only live a few blocks.. 'Please don't.' 'I know I can't sleep now.' 'Maybe if we danced until I became exhausted then I could.' Yes, ma'am. It's lot better than taking sleeping pills. [slow music] Come here, Ponce. You're very tensed, Ponce. I'm sorry, Miss Smith. Betty. [laughing] (Miss Smith) 'Ponce, is your mother a terribly strong willed person? ' - How did you guess? - You're letting me lead. - Oh, I'm sorry. - And you keep apologizing. Yes, ma'am. But then she's a great person you understand. Anything that I ever become of owe to her.. I'm sure you owe a lot to Tiger too. - Well, he's a great guy. - Yes, he's a very wise man. Jesus. - Oh. - What's the matter, Ponce? - It's nothing. - You tired of dancing? No, I love to dance. No. Why sometimes I dance for hours. Like tonight, huh? Oh, good music, Miss. I could dance all night, tonight. - Ponce, are you undressing me? - Oh, no, Miss Smith. No, it's, uh, I guess, I must've accidently. Ponce, don't hurt me. - The duck - What, dear? The duck. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh. The duck. Oh, it's alright, Ponce. It's alright. Come we'll fix the damage. Oh! I've got it. Hi, coach! - John? How are you? - Fine, and you? Oh, fine, fine. Say, John, would you mind turning off that light? - John.. - Oh, yeah. - Anyone with you, John? - 'No, no. No, just me.' 'That's good. Coming to the game on Friday? ' - For sure. - We got some new players. We'll really rip 'em to pieces. I'll be back in three minutes. 'John..' - You know her? - Who, her? - Sure, I go to her old man. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah, he's a terrific dentist. - Yeah. He gave me a terrible root canal job, last year. - This tooth, right here. - What brings you out tonight? The murderer. They always return to the scene of the crime. Good thinking. Yeah... doing a little homework, huh? Listen, John, we got a play I wanna diagram for you-- No. With that many girls around, you're bound to come across one bitch, right? Don't you worry. You just go and beat Carverton on Friday. Oh, and don't let those boys worry you about those killings. You just tell 'em old John'll figure something out eventually. Yeah, I'm sure you will, John. Say, I'm sure sorry I messed up that little party of yours. Oh, well, what's a fella to do, John? Some things just can't be helped. Here, I'll show you.. 'Now I, know that colored boy didn't do it.' 'I mean not the way that nigger plays football.' Oh-h-h! Is he gone? Yes. "Oh brave new world, that has such people in it." Shakespeare - "The Tempest". Do you know how many stars there are in our galaxy? 'No, can't say that I do. ' 100 billion. 'Do you know how many have lived since the beginning of time? ' A trillion? About 100 billion. That means there's one star for every man that ever lived. Far out. You're gonna be late for school! So are you! [serene music] [intense music] [police sirens] [police whistle] This case is beginning to take on some bizarre aspects. Yeah, like a pile driver broke broke his neck, no weapon found. Karate, maybe? You think the chief may have stumbled over something? Yes, sir, that's not a bad guess. - Oh, Mr. Proffer. - Yes? It's a delegation from the American Legion. They wanna talk to you about an anti-perversion and 100% Americanism committee-- No-no, I can't, I couldn't possibly-- Four orders. Get out there and give 'em a hand. The people from Life Magazine say I gotta pose for 'em, May I? They're taking pictures of everything. Life Magazine? That's international coverage. Two A students, a B student and now a chief of police. We certainly got a batch of funerals comin' up. I just can't work here, anymore. I just can't stand it. 'Oh, Harriet, Harriet, I do understand. You need to rest.' - 'I need a rest.' - 'A short vacation.' 'No, I can't. I don't want to miss the game, tomorrow.' We are doing everything in our power to ensure the safety of the boys and girls. Miss Craymire! Uh, Miss Craymire.. Our assistant principal, I'm sure will be able to answer any questions that you have. - He can't. - Of course he can. He's doing a personality profile. If you will not close the school. I'll not allow Hilda to set foot here. - How are you, Hilda? - Terrific. Good. How are you, miss Smith? - Miss Smith? - How are you, Betty? - Terrific. - Good. [school bell ringing] Jesus, Captain, he's served his country. Infantry Company Commander, Korea. And get this.. ...Unit commendation, plus a silver star plus a purple heart. Mm-hmm...and this here? Ranger training, fort Bedding, Georgia. Karate instructor. Probably an expert at crossbows, boomerangs and fencing. You sure you're not just jealous of him, Captain? There's a girl up there with him now, testing light's on. You may be right. 'Remember, he's a genuine hero.' I'm sorry, someone reported a stranger loitering 'outside your door in the corridor.' May have been one of the janitors. I think, Ponce is probably right. I understand, Captain. I really do. Thank you. Marriage? Serious step, Ponce. Yeah, I really love her. 'May I be very candid here? ' Sure, man, that's why I come to you. We've never discussed this, but I can see now is the time. You see, I've always had the real hope that.. '...after college, you'd return here to Ocean Front High.' 'As a teacher.' - A teacher? - I feel you'd be the best. I've felt that ever since I first evaluated you. 'And, since I'd become principal, eventually.' 'You'd become vice principal.' I'd continue as guidance counselor. But even here, I want you to begin handling as much of it as you can. Wow. There's my girl! Come here to daddy. I wish I could have that boat. - This one? - Mm-hm. Alright, we'll buy this boat. - Mmm, that's more my style. - Yeah, on my salary. - Steal it, we'll go to Mexico. - What about Brazil? - Hmm.. - Tahiti, daddy! - Tahiti? - Let's go now! Okay. [church bell ringing] [funeral procession music playing] And keep you in peace. Now and forever more. Amen. (congregation) Amen. All buried at the same time. How touching. I'm so proud of our community. Everybody insisted we not cancel the game. We'll lose for sure, everybody's so down. They're gonna have a moment of silence of each of the girls at half time. Jesus. Well organized. [marching band music] [crowd applauding] [indistinct chatter] Hi, Tiger. My little sweet shortcake snack. 'I've got something for you. I've always got something.' For a clue, look in your top desk drawer. [recording machine beeps] [marching band music continues] [crowd cheering] We're gonna have to cool it for a while, Sonny. Why? Just for a while. Will you forgive me? If I had something to hold me over. [Sonny moaning] [humming] - We have it. - Hey! - And they want it. - Hey! - 'But if they had it.' - Hey! - 'They couldn't use it. - 'Hey! ' [crowd cheering] [referee's whistle] [indistinct chatter] [referees whistle] [cheering] It's time for the bomb. Throw it. [crowd gasps] [referees whistle] [crowd booing] [referees whistle] Where in the hell do you get off playing it like that? You children don't want life. You want Disneyland. Pope! Pope you can't even take out a 150 pound sophomore. And Moss...are you running or dancing a ballet? 'And Primo and Sullivan, you're playing a couple of old women.' 'Jim is no help because he's running with his head down.' 'And he's sloppy! You bunch of pussies! ' (man on speaker) 'A few moments of silence for our dear departed.' 'Three wonderful girls from our student body.' 'And one of them, a terrific little cheerleader.' 'Who I know, are up there, somewhere.' 'Still cheering us on today.' 'And of course, that valiant crime-fighter.' 'John Poldaski who gave his life for all of us.' 'You might say.' Is it possible we can do it like we planned? - Yes. - You promised me you'd win. Didn't you? You promised me you'd hit 'em. Didn't you? (all) 'Yes.' - Are we gonna hit em? - Yes. - What? - Yes! - Are we better? - Yes! - Are we the greatest? - Yes! - What are we? - The greatest! - What are we gonna do to 'em? - Kill 'em! Then, goddamit go do it! [referee whistle] (crowd) 'Go! Go! Go! ' [crowd applauding] [referees whistle] [referees whistle] [referees whistle] What about a cross-buck to the right? Gotcha. (crowd) 'Go, team, go! ' Right! [referees whistle] [all cheering excitedly] Come on, you guys, put me down. [indistinct chatter] Hey, coach! Have you got a word for us? Love! Hey, Tiger, you need me for notes? My office, in ten minutes. We've got a lot to talk about. We won, tiger. The man who wrestles his woes, Jim, they never get up again. [whistling] [tape recorder clinking] Now, coach, about the academics. Congratulations, coach. How about a few words for KBEX? Coach? 'Hi, Tiger, I've got something for you.' 'I've always got something.' 'For a clue, look in your top desk drawer.' (Tiger) 'We're gonna have to cool it for a while, Sonny.' 'Why? ' 'Just for a while. Will you forgive me? ' (Sonny) 'If I had something to hold me over.' [moaning] [whistling] [moaning on tape recorder] 'Get down here, yeah, that's it, yeah.' [moaning continues] 'How's that? Feel good? ' Hey, man, you really made some great calls. Especially that last reverse. Listen, Tiger, I think I'm coming down with something. I'm gonna go home. I'll drive you. Hey, great game, eh, Sam? It's time to blow the whistle on the swinger. - Pick McDrew for questioning. - Sam.. And besides that, I want every young broad he's had recently for a lie detector session. Somebody's got a break. Go ahead. And here we have Captain Sam Surcher, State Police. - It was a great game, Captain? - Yes. Would you say, captain, that we can expect some breakthrough in the high school murder case In the very near future? Shit. And you heard it first here on KBEX. An inside report from our state police. [intense music] (Tiger) 'No Ponce. I didn't ball the entire female student body.' Just a few truly exceptional girls. Just as I could concentrate only on those boys with good potential. Like yourself. 'A few others, you know.' With girls you communicate best that way 'with boys, I use sports. Fishing trips.' That sort of thing. Hey remember that rugged hike to the top of Mount Whitney? Oh, Jesus. Yeah, but did you have to kill them? Jill.. ...was an incredibly stupid mistake on my part. 'It was the only time I ever ignored my own test results.' In the office, that morning. The ultimatum. 'Divorce my wife.' 'Marry her and answer to the world at that moment. Or else.' You know, my first thought, Ponce, was.. ...if I could...explain it to you. 'Make you...really understand.' 'Then, perhaps, you'd keep silent.' Yeah, I'm really beginning to understand. No, Ponce. You couldn't possibly keep silent. 'And I'm afraid there's no way you can convince me' 'that you could.' 'We have a real dilemma, haven't we? ' [intense music] [engine starts] (Tiger) 'I'm taking you home.' The accelerator's stuck! Hang on, Ponce. [screams] [seagulls squawking] [intense music] [serene music] We are gathered here in memory of our late and much regretted friend, Michael "Tiger" McDrew. 'Whose contributions have put Ocean Front High School' 'at the vanguard of educational communities.' 'And at the top of the High School Football League.' 'A heroic man, whose last act was to thrust a passenger' 'from the submerging car.' 'Giving his life, that a boy might live.' 'The sea has not yielded up his remains.' 'But his memory will live forever in our hearts.' 'And his soul, in God.' Amen.

Curtain's going up! A big Broadway opening. Everybody who's anybody in New York is here tonight. Everybody but one man. This man. Me. Where are you going? Didn't you direct this? I just have to... One or two things. Get out of this theatre! - Is anything wrong with your seat? - It's facing the stage! It's going to be a disaster. I can't just sit there and watch. Five seconds and we still haven't got a laugh. I'm not running away. I just don't like watching a car crash. Particularly when it's mine. It's going to be a catastrophe. They'll forget their lines. We won't get out of New York alive. There's pictures of us in the lobby. I'll get on a plane. I should have done when we opened in Des Moines, before we opened, at the dress rehearsal, as soon as the curtain went up. As soon as the damned phone rang and Dotty came on with the sardines. Hold on! Hold your horses! Oh, Lord love a duck! Shut up! I'm on my way. It's no good you going on. I can't open sardines and answer the phone. I've only got one pair of feet. Hello? Yes, but there's no one here, love... No, Mr Brent's not here. He lives here, yes, but not now because he lives in Spain. Yes, Philip Brent, who writes plays, only now he writes them in Spain. She's in Spain, too. They all are. Am I in Spain? No, I'm not in Spain. I look after the house for them. Only I go home at one on Wednesdays, so that's where I am. No, because I've got a nice plate of sardines to put my feet up with. And they've got colour here, and it's the Royal...you know, the horse race. Where's the paper? If it's about letting the house, you'll have to ring the house agents. Squire, Squire, Hackham and... Who's the other one? No, they're next to the phone in the study. Squire, Squire, Hackham and... Hold on! I'll go and look. As soon as you take the weight off your feet, down it all comes on your head. And I take the sardines... No, I leave the sardines... No, I take the sardines. You leave the sardines and you hang up the phone. Yes, right. I hang up the phone. - And you leave the sardines. - I leave the sardines? You leave the sardines. I hang up the phone and I leave the sardines? Right! - We've changed that, have we, dear? - No, dear. - That's what I've always been doing? - I wouldn't say that, Dotty. How about the words? Am I getting some of them right? Some of them have a very familiar ring. - It's like a slot machine up here. - I know that. I never know what's going to come out: three oranges or two lemons and a banana. Anyway, it's not midnight yet, and we don't open till tomorrow. - You're holding the receiver. - Right. ""Squire, Squire, Hackham and...hold on!" and noises off. Squire, Squire, Hackham... Hold on! Hanging up the phone. Put your feet up for two minutes and they come running after you. - Hold it! - This is her afternoon off. - Hold it, Garry. Dotty! - We've got the place to ourselves. - Wow! - Hold it, Brooke. - Dotty! - Come back? Yes, and go out with the newspaper. The newspaper. Oh, the newspaper. Hang up the phone, leave the sardines and go out, with the newspaper. - Here. - Sorry. - Don't worry. It's just the tech. - It's the dress, Garry. - When was the tech? - When's the dress? We open tomorrow. We're thinking of it as the tech. - It's the words. - Don't worry about the words. And that accent. It's like oranges and lemons. Your words are fine. Better than the... you know? Isn't that right? - Sorry? - I mean, OK, he's the... But, Dotty, you've been playing this kind of part for, well, I mean... Jesus, Dotty, you know? Garry and Brooke are off, Dotty is holding the receiver. We open tomorrow, we've only had two weeks rehearsal, we don't know where we are, but here we are. - Right, Lloyd? - Beautifully put. We're playing Des Moines, then Pittsburgh, then God knows where and we're all feeling, you know? - Aren't you? - Sorry? Garry, you're off. - Sorry, Lloyd, but...you know? - I know. - Thanks, Lloyd. - So you're off... Lloyd, let me just say one thing. I've known many directors, some geniuses, some bastards, but I've never met one who was so totally... I don't know. Thank you, Garry, I'm very touched. Now get off the fucking stage. - And Brooke? - Yes? - Are you in? - In? - Are you there? - What? You're out. OK, I'll call again. And on we go. So, there you are, holding the receiver. I hold the receiver. I hang it up. I leave the sardines. - Always the same story... - And you take the newspaper. I take the newspaper. I leave the sardines. A weight off your mind, a load off your stomach. - And off I go at last. - Leaving the receiver. My housekeeper, yes, but... And noises off. Stage! This is her afternoon off, so we've got the place to ourselves. - Wow! - I'll just check. Hello? Anyone at home? There's no one here. - What do you think? - Great! It's all yours? Just a shack in the woods. Converted mill, 1 6th century. - Must have cost a bomb. - Ideal for business. Someone's coming at 4.00. Arab. Oil. I've got to get those files to Basingstoke by 4.00. We'll just manage to fit it in... Do it... - Right. - We won't chill the champagne. - All these doors! -Just a handful. Study, kitchen and housekeeper's flat. Which one's the...you know? - Oh, through here. - Fantastic! Now I've lost the sardines. - I thought no one was here. - I'm not. Only it's the Royal... The race where they wear those hats. Who are you? From Squire, Squire, Hackham and Dudley. - Which one are you, then? - I'm Tramplemain. I thought you were a burglar. I just dropped in to go into a few things... Check some measurements... Do one or two odd jobs. Oh, and I've got a prospective tenant. - What's wrong with this door? - Her interest is aroused. That's not the bedroom. No, that's the downstairs bathroom and WC. - The housekeeper, Mrs Crockett. - Clackett, dear. - She's not here. It's the Royal. - It's black and white at home. Don't worry about us. We'll just inspect the house. - Now I've lost the newspaper. - Sardines! - Sorry about this. - That's all right. We don't want the TV. Sardines! I forgot the sardines. Lloyd! These damned sardines! - We can't go on like this. - Can't go on like what, Garry? It's OK for you, but we work with them, don't we? - Sorry? - The sardines? We're working our asses off and there are four plates of sardines in act one. Poppy! You want something instead of sardines? - You want mashed banana? - We don't want mashed banana. - We're changing the sardines. - We're not angry at you, Poppy. I'm happy with the sardines if you are, hon. - I'm happy if you are. - Garry, what are you saying? Here we are, busting our guts up here and, Christ! - I see. You got that, Poppy? - Well... Right. On we go from Dotty's exit. And Poppy? Don't let this happen again. - No. - Sorry.Just getting that straight. - As long as Dotty's happy. - Absolutely. - Do something for me, Dotty. - Anything. Take the sardines off with you. - I'm sorry about this. - That's all right. We don't want the TV. She's been in the family for generations. Come on. I've got to be in Basingstoke by 4.00. - Perhaps just some champagne? - Upstairs. And bring my files. - Only... - What? Her? She has been here for generations. Sardines, sardines... It's not for me to say, but I will say this: take the plunge, you'll enjoy it here. Won't she? - Yes, well... - We'll enjoy having you, won't we? Terrific! Sardines... Can't put your feet up on an empty stomach. She thinks it's great. She's making us sardines. She's terrific. - Terrific. - So, which way? All right. Before she comes back with the sardines. - Up here? In here? - Yes, yes, yes. Another bathroom. You always try to get me in the bathrooms! - I mean in here. - Ooh! Black sheets! That's the linen closet. This one, this one! You're in a real state. Can't even get the door open. - It's Mrs Clackett's afternoon off. - Hold it! Look at it! Hold it! And God said, ""Hold it!" And they held it. And God saw that it was terrible. - The door won't open. - This door won't close. - And God said, ""Poppy!" - You know I'm stupid about doors. - You're doing perfectly. - As long as I didn't break it. And there was Poppy. And God said, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fetch Tim to fix the doors." I love tech rehearsals! She loves tech rehearsals! Isn't she, just... Where's Dotty? - Everyone's always so nice. - Belinda's being all, you know? Freddy, don't you like an all-night tech? Only because you can sit on the furniture. - It's good to see you making jokes. - Oh, was that a joke? This is such a nice company to work with. Broadway in six months! - Cleveland in three! - All right, Lloyd? I know Who is it? Looks like the guy on the poster that's wanted for bigamy. Yep! He's got the same kind of hat and the poster said he always carried a cane. Hot diggety! There's $1,000 reward for him! Oh, boy! Come on, slats, get him. Nitwit! That's our new minister. I never saw him before. That makes your score 100% perfect for guys you never saw before. [Groans] We better put him in another department. He's gone screwy with that camera. Yeah, the next thing you know, he'll be taking X-ray pictures of his aunt Lulu's gallstones. [Woman screams] [Siren wailing] [Gunshots] What was that? Sounds like backfiring of a car. Yeah? Well, that's gunfire! Verman? Verman? What's all that noise, mommy? I don't know, child. It sounds like guns. You come on... Get in here! [Kids screaming] Cop: Look out for those kids! Hang on, boys! Verman, crying: Mommy! Cop: Come on, children! Get going! Who is it? It's Mrs. diggs, the washwoman. Here, doctor! Doctor! My mama! I want my mama! Mama! I want my mommy! I want my mom! Mama! I want my mommy! Verman, don't cry. Gotta grit your teeth. Remember, you're a g-man. That's right. Smile, just a little. I want my mommy! [Sobbing] Penrod, will you please stop that? What's the matter with you? You know what's the matter. Now, verman's all right. He's with friends of his mother. Is he gonna live with them all the time? Well, no. They're poor people with a lot of children of their own. But don't worry, dear. He'll be provided for. The county takes good care of little boys like him. Well, why did they have to send him to an orphan asylum? Now, there's nothing wrong with an orphan asylum. Well, I still can't see why dad won't let us adopt him. I've explained why. Oh, dad gives me a... Well, here's good news. Yes? They got one of those gangsters. Only one? The abandoned car was discovered about 20 feet off the main road this side of meadow creek bridge. The dead man was found slumped in the back seat. The g-men will get 'em. The cops has got every road blocked. I hope they shoot every doggone one of them! Penrod! Don't be so bloodthirsty. Well, they killed verman's mother, didn't they? I know but that's no reason... well? Now darling, you'd better run along. Wash your hands and face. It's just about dinner time. Oh, all right. What's the matter with him? He's still worrying about poor little verman. Oh. Why, you sap! What are you trying to do, throw out a flare so those bulls can start blasting? They can't shoot me. I'm out of season. Aw, save your wisecracks. What are you gonna do, sit here until they call out the militia? Yeah, it looks like they already have. I'm so hungry I could eat the bark off this tree. Well, you got your cut of the dough. Why don't you hop into town and grab yourself a hamburger? No, I'll press the button and have one delivered. I'll press you in the button if you don't shut up. But dad, why can't you... Now see here, penrod, you've got to stop this nonsense. I've told you before we can't adopt verman. Now, you're old enough to understand that. Sure, I understand. But that's what I'm trying to tell you. Nobody wants him or cares what happens to him. Well, you'll have to quit carrying the world on your shoulders. Mother: You've got a lot of homework, penrod. You better get started at it. Now, run along, be a good boy. We'll be back in a couple of hours. Oh, all right. Good night, mother. Good night, son. That's the first time he hasn't kissed me. Well Frank, you are a little hard on him. He's very fond of verman. He's all upset about it. Well, he'll just have to snap out of it, that's all. Father: And remember a 2-low trump bid is not a demand bid. Oh, don't start that. [Doorbell rings] Buzz: Oh, Mrs. schofield, is verman with penrod? Why, no. I'd... Do you know where he is? No, why? He's gone! We thought maybe he was over here. He's been gone for a couple hours, and we can't find him anyplace. See, I told you. He's run away. Oh, nonsense. He's probably around at one of the neighbors'. Oh no, Mr. schofield. We looked everywhere. I knew he didn't want to go to the orphan asylum. You're making a Mountain out of a molehill. Yeah, well he's gone, isn't he? Wait a minute, buzz, I'll go with you. We'll find him. You're not going to leave this house tonight. I've gotta. Just tell me where the money is. OLD MAN: I bet you're a good student. Yeah. Thanks for the drink. Sure. I should get going. BROTHER: Sorry I got you into this, bro. Sorry I dragged you into this. MAN 2: Last chance. BROTHER: Don't tell him, bro. Please, don't shoot him. BROTHER: Don't do it. MAN 2: It's up to you. BROTHER: Don't you tell him, bro. Don't tell him. Under the floorboards in the kitchen. MAN 2: There you go. DRIVER: Gary, I'm sorry. BROTHER: It's okay. I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay, bro. It's gonna be okay. No! MAN 1: Oh, Jesus, man, no. DRIVER: No!

I'm gonna kill you all. CICERO: They killed him. What do you mean they killed him? He was dead. At least for a little while anyway. The hospital pronounced him DO A. [♪♪♪] DOCTOR: Can you hear me? Bullet hit, ricocheted around his skull, came out his cheek. He's got a plate holding the back of his head together. I mean, this guy refused to die. And now, he must be going after everyone in that video. [♪♪♪] You said you wouldn't be late. Where have you been? I caught a case. You're supposed to take Tommy to his game. You made me late for my class. I'm sorry, it's a big deal, this case. I saw it on TV. I do not wanna hear about it. You want me to have full custody? I will take custody. COP: You know I don't want that. Then take him to his baseball game. Okay. All right. What's up, champ? What position they got you playing? Don't play much. Well, you got an arm like a cannon. I don't know why they wouldn't let you. I know. Maybe I should have a talk with that coach. Maybe pinch-hit or something. What do you say? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? CICERO: Hey, it's Cicero. There's been another shooting. This could be our guy. Yeah. Mallory wants you down at the scene. Okay, I'll be there in a little bit. 4045 Danson Road. Got it? I'll be there in an hour. [LINE DISCONNECTS] Hey, you know what, I'm not gonna make it in today. I'm taking my son to a baseball game. It's really important that I be there. Well, you know what? That's just too bad. All right, bye. Good grief. Can you imagine that? I already told them I had a ball game to go to today. [♪♪♪] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Incredible. You're a full two hours late. John, did you--? So, what do we got? What do you got? Guy did the world a favor on this one. Found out who shot our snuff films. Excuse me. So we got a telemarketer, a sex offender. What's next, a lawyer? Whole shebang just got a lot weirder. Witnesses placed a second shooter at the scene. After our suspect whacked Mr. Rogers, he had a little shootout in the hall. Maybe an armed neighbor. Uh-uh. No one recognized this dude. They exchanged gunfire then disappeared. Both of them. COP: The second shooter, any description? The word "beautiful" came up. Beautiful? Like a movie star. KILLER: He punked me. He's really that good? KILLER [OVER HEADSET]: Good's not even the right word. I mean, you know, the dude's completely artless. I mean, there's no sophistication to him whatsoever. But he's pure, you know? No fear, no hesitation. There's nothing. He as fast as you? No, he's faster. You'll get him. How can you be so sure, hey? Because you always do. KILLER: Baby. Yeah? Marry me. MAN: Hey, mister. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Goddamn it. Shit. [LAUGHING] Is that what I think it is? Oh, the tattoo? Yeah. Tattoo. Yeah, I was in the L.A. Crash Unit before I got transferred up here. Guns blazing, ass-kicking cops with porno mustaches? That Crash? Yeah, is it so hard for you to believe? Yeah. Can I get in there? That's where I met Marina, actually. She was my Cl. You married your snitch? Dude, that is wrong on so many levels. Well, she was in really bad shape. Got in rehab and we fell in love and there you go. Was she the only one in rehab? That's ancient history. You sure about that, Hoss? Listen, I got 10 days to retirement. Full benefits for me and my family, so why would I screw that up? It's all I got. COP: All right. Let's go. How long you been clean? Since my son was born. Good for you.

[DOOR CLOSES] [FOOTSTEPS] [BAB Y BABBLING] Oh, my God. You can't do this. Why did you come? There's nothing for you here. Why did you make me stop coming to see you in prison? I didn't see any sense of three wasted lives. Three? Was that him? The boy? David? You shouldn't think... You did a dime. David's 8. Do the math. When you cut me off, I gave the baby up. Did you find a good family? I had an abortion. I'm sorry. [SOBBING] [♪♪♪] [BAB Y CRYING] All right. They know what you're doing. I saw it on TV. I hope you kill them all.

Would you quit before this job? Absolutely. I will quit absolutely. Just like that? Just like that. Marina. Let me in for a second, I need to talk. I'm gonna stand here all day, so you may as well. Marina. [LOCK CLICKS] WOMAN [ON TV]: --killed, the first victim was gunned down less than an hour after the suspected gunman was released from prison.

Those that live by the sword will die by the sword, unless they learn to forgive. God made life so fragile and so precious for each one of us. You will never truly be free unless you learn to-- BOUNCER 1: Yo, I gotta take a leak. I'll be right back. BOUNCER 2: Hold up, big man, I gotta check you. Arms up.

What if I told you you had to choose? Don't. You used to be attracted to what I do. I'm your wife now. What if he kills you? Lily. [SOBS] Daddy? Yeah? I know I suck at baseball. You don't have to pretend like I'm good. You'll get better. You just need to practice. Maybe you and I can throw the ball around one day. How's that? Okay. I gotta tell you a secret first, though. What, Daddy? I suck at baseball too. [BOTH LAUGH] [CLATTERING] You go to sleep, okay? I'll be back. Jesus Christ. [GROANS] Oh, Jesus. Are you okay? Look at me, look at me. Why did you do this? I'm afraid. What are you afraid of, honey? We're going to hell for what we did. Do you know what hell is? It's not fire and devils. All that stuff they taught you when you was little. We make our heaven and our hell while we're alive, [♪♪♪] every time we cause pain, every time we cause suffering. [PHONE LINE RINGS] CICERO [OVER PHONE]: Cicero. Hey, it's me. Did I wake you up? No. You said on your message to give you a call, so... Okay, here's the deal. Both of our victims were informants. Could be something there, right? COP: Yeah, could be. Nice work. CICERO: Okay, I need you to follow up on it. I gotta be in court, but I really think we're getting close. It's gotta have something to do with how they got set up. Did you hear about that stabbing in Henderson? Yeah, yeah, what about it? I got a hunch it might be our guy. It's not his m.o. Our guy's a shooter, not a stabber. Like I said, I got a hunch. Yeah, so did Quasimodo. Look where it got him. I'm gonna go ask a few questions. After you do the follow-up, right? Got it cleared with the Henderson IC. I'm headed up there now. I have to be in court all day. I am asking you to do this. It's my case. [LINE DISCONNECTS] [SIGHS] WOMAN [ON RADIO]: --bring us nothing but the same politics as usual.

WOMAN: Hold still. [♪♪♪] Okay. MOTHER: How long you been out? Couple of days. And why are you here? Came here to kill the old man. Why? Because he set us up. What makes you think that? Gary went to him for advice on the bank job and he wanted full share. Gary wouldn't give it to him. So do you think the old man was capable of murdering his own son? Yeah. No. Mm-mm. Nope. He couldn't have. What makes you so sure? I just... I just know. Tell me. Say it. Mom. Because... he loved your brother too much. I'm sorry. And that's the truth and that's not your fault. It wasn't like I could pretend you were his. He was reminded of that every time he looked at you. You never stood a chance. Sorry that I couldn't... That I didn't protect you. The beatings and... [SOBBING] Gary was the only one who ever cared for me. Why'd he pull you in on that job? You were never a part of what they did. When his driver fell out, I volunteered. Why? He owed the wrong people a lot of money. And he needed me. If it wasn't the old man, then who set us up? [♪♪♪] [MAN SPEAKING INSISTINCTLY ON RADIO] EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]: Driven by his passions and desires. You will never truly be free unless you freely forgive. Hate is like a chain around your neck that leads you to places you don't wanna go. It'll lead you into darkness and desolation. You become a slave to that hatred, and it'll only lead to your own destruction. You must break free. WOMAN: Hey, cowboy. You okay, man? COP: Yeah. MAN 1: You laid eyes on him at least. Hey, well done. Thanks, man. I gotta call you back. MAN 2: Still in one piece. MAN 3: Good job. Good lead, cowboy. You almost got him. We got close. Yeah. It was a good hunch. Well, even Quasimodo has his day. And don't ever hang up on me again. Roger that. I hate to spoil your moment. Got something I wanna show you. I think we may have caught a break. You said "we" again. I did. CICERO: Our latest victim was a Cl too. COP: So all three are informants. CICERO: Mm-hm. All got records, armed robbery, rape, assault. But none did any serious time. They all snitched their way out of the joint over and over. What are the odds of that? Slim and none. I'm waiting on the informant logs now. COP: Who are these? Former accomplices of the victims. Let's split them up, check them out. I'll take these. EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]: And I know there's not a man, woman or child in this church today that has not sinned. But God did not bring you down on this Earth to be perfect. No. God wants you down here to be saved. [CROWD CHEERS ON RADIO] And when you're down with God, God is eternally down with you. [♪♪♪] EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]: When Jesus knew his time was near, when he knew he was gonna die, when he knew they would not take that cup from his lips, his thoughts were not upon his own. His thoughts were for those that he loved. WOMAN: Amen. EVANGELIST: That's right. His thoughts were for those that he loved, preparing them. EVANGELIST: Why is that? He used the example of his birth. That's right. Here it is. Jesus told them how a woman goes through pain and sorrow in the throes of childbirth. But then as soon as she has delivered, there is no more anguish. [CHEERING] After all the screaming, after all the pushing, after all the blood and the tears, there's only joy that a new child has been born. WOMAN 1: Hallelujah! And I'll tell you my-- WOMAN 2: Amen! Amen! [CROWD CHEERING] WOMAN 3: Amen. WOMAN 4: Amen. Amen. Amen. WOMAN 5: Hallelujah! Amen! MAN: Amen! Sing me a song! [CHEERING] [BAND PLAYING GOSPEL MUSIC] [SINGING "TROUBLE IN MY WAY"] [SINGING INSISTINCTLY] EVANGELIST: I was wondering when you were gonna show up. You've been the subject of many of my sermons these past few days. I heard. You heard. But did you listen? Everything okay, baby? Everything's just fine, honey. I was just catching up with an old acquaintance. You go on home now. Let's take a walk. [♪♪♪] Was that your son? Adopted. One of five. Wayward boys. Not unlike me or you at that age. You turned your life around. Doesn't change what you did. I wouldn't want it to. I know it sounds cold, but every good I've done hinged on the evil I did. Who set us up? I don't know. I never did find out how they knew about your safe house. When I got the call, "Easy money," they said. All I had to do was guard the door, be the lookout. I was in a dark place in my life. Numb to the chaos and-- Right here. But when they cut that boy's throat... Oh, Jesus, man. No. That boy they killed was my brother. I can't bring him back. And in my heart I'm sorry. I still took my cut, spent it on drugs and women. Ended up in prison. But it was there that I found my calling. To save and help boys like me. And like you. It was there that I gave my life to God. God can't save you from me. But maybe he could save you from yourself. I know there's good-- You don't know me. I know the devil got your heart twisted with vengeance and hate. The Lord is merciful. He sees in your soul. Fragile, ain't it? That moment, that sets us on our road to Damascus. Sermon's over. Can you at least find it in your heart to forgive me for what I did? I can't. That's all right. That's all right. Because I forgive you for what you're about to do. [SINGING "JOHN THE REVELATOR"] Lord, see into this man's heart. He's good inside. Oh, Lord, save this man's soul. I know you see his heart. [EVANGELIST CONTINUES SINGING] Release him from the bondage of hatred and vengeance, Lord. [CONTINUES SINGING] [EVANGELIST GRUNTS] Go back to your family. [♪♪♪] That's one hell of a peashooter you got there. How's the recoil? [♪♪♪] [RINGING] Yeah. CICERO: Where are you? Inyo County at the reservoir. They're here. Both of them. What? Did you call for backup? There's no time for that. Okay, don't do this. I'm sorry I keep stepping on your case. CICERO: I don't care about that. Want you to do me a favor. If I don't make it out of this, tell my son that his daddy went out like a man. I am on my way. Please, just wait for me. I'm just going with the flow. Damn. [FAX MACHINE BEEPS] Aren't you gonna reach for it? Come on. Sporting chance. I've got nothing against you. I've been trying to kill you for days and you've got nothing against me? I'm starting to think you don't take me very seriously, friend. DRIVER: What do you want from me? How about a little respect? Hey? A little professional courtesy from a peer. Some acknowledgment of my skills. You've got issues. Screw you. I win. [KILLER CHUCKLES] You think you're done? You can't put it together, can you? There must be one more. The one who hired me. He's still alive. I'm gonna kill you all. Drop the gun. Don't move. Slowly. Put the gun down. No. Put the goddamn gun down. No! This is my job! I finish my job. How you gonna finish this when you're dead? So you're the guy that hired me. You shouldn't have done that. I had to finish what I started. Why'd you hire me then? I didn't think I was up to it. After you missed him, I figured I should get involved before he came gunning for me. He didn't even know about you. I figured that out when he didn't finish me off at the hospital. His brother's girlfriend was my informant down in L.A. She told me about the job. Hired some more of my informants down there. They helped me take down their score. So, what now? Now? I ride off into the sunset. Hey. I forgot to pay you. You know, I don't get you. Why do you put yourself through all this shit for one lousy dollar? It's my price. Call it a hobby. You know what, keep it. I didn't earn it. Don't contact me again, I'm done. Yeah, me too. [LINE RINGING] MALLORY [OVER HEADSET]: Detective Cicero? CICERO: Yeah, I can't reach him. Okay, hopefully he'll turn up. We've got units en route, we'll see you shortly. CICERO: Wait a minute. You didn't flip him this case, did you? I didn't flip him the case. Is that what you thought? He asked for it, right? He begged for it. And I felt sorry for him, so I caved. Is there a reason why we're talking about this right now? No. No reason. Okay, I'll see you shortly. "Go with the flow," my ass. Marina? Hey, it's me, honey. Well, I got him, I closed the case. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. As a matter of fact, I feel perfect. Better than I ever have. MARINA: Yeah? Yeah, and I'm gonna get rid of the other stuff too. Don't you worry, I promise. I'll be home in a couple hours. Listen, you're not gonna believe this. I've been reading up on women, and I think I got you figured out. We're gonna be fine. Yeah, honey, it's over. I wanna start brand-new, honey. [GUNSHOT] [COUGHING] [COP GRUNTING] How? Metal plate. I can't feel anything. I created my own hell. And I'm the demon who crawled up out of it.

[¶¶¶] [CAMERA SHUTTER clicks] Incredible. You're a full two hours late. John, did you--? So, what do we got? What do you got? Guy did the world a favor on this one. Found out who shot our snuff films. Excuse me. So we got a telemarketer, a sex offender. What's next, a lawyer? Whole shebang just got a lot weirder. Witnesses placed a second shooter at the scene. After our suspect whacked Mr. Rogers, he had a little shootout in the hall. Maybe an armed neighbor. Uh-uh. No one recognized this dude. They exchanged gunfire then disappeared. Both of them. COP: The second shooter, any description? The word "beautiful" came up. Beautiful? Like a movie star. killer: He punked me. He's really that good? killer [OVER HEADSET]: Good's not even the right word. I mean, you know, the dude's completely artless. I mean, there's no sophistication to him whatsoever. But he's pure, you know? No fear, no hesitation. There's nothing. He as fast as you? No, he's faster. You'll get him. How can you be so sure, hey? Because you always do. killer: Baby. Yeah? Marry me.

No. You said on your message to give you a call, so... Okay, here's the deal. Both of our victims were informants. Could be something there, right? COP: Yeah, could be. Nice work. ClCERO: Okay, I need you to follow up on it. I gotta be in court, but I really think we're getting close. It's gotta have something to do with how they got set up. Did you hear about that stabbing in Henderson? Yeah, yeah, what about it? I got a hunch it might be our guy. It's not his m.o. Our guy's a shooter, not a stabber. Like I said, I got a hunch. Yeah, so did Quasimodo. Look where it got him. I'm gonna go ask a few questions. After you do the follow-up, right? Got it cleared with the Henderson lC. I'm headed up there now. I have to be in court all day. I am asking you to do this. It's my case. [line disconnects] [sighs] WOMAN [ON radio]: --bring us nothing but the same politics as usual.

WOMAN: Hold still. [¶¶¶] Okay. MOTHER: How long you been out? Couple of days. And why are you here? Came here to kill the old man. Why? Because he set us up. What makes you think that? Gary went to him for advice on the bank job and he wanted full share. Gary wouldn't give it to him. So do you think the old man was capable of murdering his own son? Yeah. No. Mm-mm. Nope. He couldn't have. What makes you so sure? I just... I just know. Tell me. Say it. Mom. Because... he loved your brother too much. I'm sorry. And that's the truth and that's not your fault. It wasn't like I could pretend you were his. He was reminded of that every time he looked at you. You never stood a chance. Sorry that I couldn't... That I didn't protect you. The beatings and... [sobbing] Gary was the only one who ever cared for me. Why'd he pull you in on that job? You were never a part of what they did. When his driver fell out, I volunteered. Why? He owed the wrong people a lot of money. And he needed me. If it wasn't the old man, then who set us up? [¶¶¶] [MAN speaking lNDlSTlNCTLY ON radio] evangelist [ON radio]: Driven by his passions and desires. You will never truly be free unless you freely forgive. Hate is like a chain around your neck that leads you to places you don't wanna go. It'll lead you into darkness and desolation. You become a slave to that hatred, and it'll only lead to your own destruction. You must break free. WOMAN: Hey, cowboy. You okay, man? COP: Yeah. MAN 1 : You laid eyes on him at least. Hey, well done. Thanks, man. I gotta call you back. MAN 2: Still in one piece. MAN 3: Good job. Good lead, cowboy. You almost got him. We got close. Yeah. It was a good hunch. Well, even Quasimodo has his day. And don't ever hang up on me again. Roger that. I hate to spoil your moment. Got something I wanna show you. I think we may have caught a break. You said "we" again. I did. ClCERO: Our latest victim was a Cl too. COP: So all three are informants. ClCERO: Mm-hm. All got records, armed robbery, rape, assault. But none did any serious time. They all snitched their way out of the joint over and over. What are the odds of that? Slim and none. I'm waiting on the informant logs now. COP: Who are these? Former accomplices of the victims. Let's split them up, check them out. I'll take these. evangelist [ON radio]: And I know there's not a man, woman or child in this church today that has not sinned. But God did not bring you down on this Earth to be perfect. No. God wants you down here to be saved. [CROWD CHEERS ON radio] And when you're down with God, God is eternally down with you. [¶¶¶] evangelist [ON radio]: When Jesus knew his time was near, when he knew he was gonna die, when he knew they would not take that cup from his lips, his thoughts were not upon his own. His thoughts were for those that he loved. WOMAN: Amen. evangelist: That's right. His thoughts were for those that he loved, preparing them. evangelist: Why is that? He used the example of his birth. That's right. Here it is. Jesus told them how a woman goes through pain and sorrow in the throes of childbirth. But then as soon as she has delivered, there is no more anguish. [cheering] After all the screaming, after all the pushing, after all the blood and the tears, there's only joy that a new child has been born. WOMAN 1 : Hallelujah!

Say, Cliff, those wouldn't be new glasses, would they? Oh, hey, you noticed, huh? Yeah, Italian imports. Sixty-five smack-a-roonies. That's right. Notice the sleek, European styling there, the sturdy reinforced frames, and the hi-tech, shatterproof reflective lenses that allow me to scope out the dollies without drawing attention to myself. You could walk up to them naked with your hair on fire and not draw attention to yourself. Yeah? What would you know? They only work on women. You! They seem to have given you courage. - Prove it. - Well, what do you mean? Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing a little demonstration myself. - So... - All right, all right. All right. All right! You've got the shades. What are you worrying about? Excuse me. Oh, perfect! Thanks. Well, I don't care what anybody says, we had better chatter out there. Shut up, Cliff. Sounds suspiciously as if there is no joy in Mudville. Who gives a damn? We lost. We didn't lose. We got dumped on. We were dragged by our noses through the dung heap. They ripped out our guts, held them up for us to see, and then they rammed them down our throats. It's a grand old game. Damn! Now I know why they weren't afraid to let me play. They were great out there. They were like the '27 Yankees. He's exaggerating. There were only nine of them. Come on, guys. We can't just sit around crying in our beer here. - Norman's right. - We don't have any. Come on, Diane, step on it, will you. I feel a tear welling up here. What the hell? First round on the house. Hey, Sammy! Yeah, well, if you think I'm drinking with you guys, you're nuts! I'd rather drink with those snail pellets from Gary's Old Towne Tavern. - At least they're winners. - That really hurts, Carla. Hey, really, I don't think we played so bad, you know. - Listen to Mr Gold Glove over here. - Come on! Yeah? You drew more flies than bad liver. Oh, give me a break! The only thing more amazing than that was you dropped every one of them. Come on, will you. I just have a little problem with balls hit directly at me. The... I think it's probably the sun, you know, or that I can't bend over. Poor Norman. Well, at least some of us looked good out there, huh? Yeah, Cliff, the less of your face showing, the better. Oh, listen to yourselves. You're letting a minor setback in some trivial competition ruin what is an otherwise lovely day. Forget it, Sam. You just don't get it, do you? It's not just that the guys from Gary's beat us at basketball, volleyball, darts and every other sport known to mankind. It's more than that. I'm a jock. This is a jock bar, but if we keep losing, all the jocks are gonna say, "Hey, Cheers is for losers. Let's go drink over at Gary's." Oh, they'll never say that. They'll say, "Me no like Cheers. Let's go to Gary's." Gentlemen of Cheers. And ladies. - Tough game out there today. - What are you doing here? Boy, you guys have the worst luck. Yeah, it looks like it just followed us home, huh? Listen, we were over having a celebration at my little tavern and I kept thinking, "Something's missing." It wasn't as happy as it usually is when we beat you. And then I realized what it was. I didn't get a chance to thank you guys for the game. So I came over here to do it now. Way to go. The pop-up king. Many thanks. Great glasses. This is what I was afraid of. Hard feelings. What are you talking about? You guys have nothing to hang your heads about. You played hard. You played clean. You gave it your all. Just remember, it takes two sides to make a victory. One side to win and you guys. Excuse me, but you've obviously come here to belittle my friends. Why? I can only speculate. Perhaps you're compensating for some physical shortcoming. I don't know. But it's tragic that you place such stock in a silly competition. What of higher attainments? What of loftier pursuits? What of art? And philosophy? What of music? I graduated magna cum laude in American Literature from Princeton. Oh? Couldn't make summa? Hey, look, Gar. You only came here to rub our noses in it. You've done a great job. Mission accomplished. Now why don't you take off. - Yeah, take a hike. - Sam, I came here in the spirit of sportsmanship. I'll show you sportsmanship. People! People! This is neither the time nor the place for such childish behaviour. Yeah, let's save it for when we kick his butt. In what? We're kind of running out of sports, aren't we? Well, it's really been a truly enjoyable afternoon. Gentlemen, ladies. - See you. - Hey, hey, hey. Listen, I'll have you know that I'm putting together a team right this moment, that's gonna have you shaking in those shoes of yours. Hey, those are nice. Well, thanks. And is that a challenge? - Yeah. - In what sport? I'll tell you in what sport. In... - Bowling. - Yeah, bowling. Great! I've knocked down a pin or two in my day. - When and where? - Well, I'll just let you know. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Okay. - Okay! - Okay! - Okay! - Okay! - Okay! Bowling? Don't worry. I got this theory, Sam. You see, all of those other sports required real athletic ability, but with bowling, we got the makings of a great team! - Oh, Carla, I... - Oh, listen, listen! You go to any bowling alley, what do you see? A bunch of out-of-shape couch potatoes who do nothing but sit around and swill beer. All right, we're number one! Back so soon from the sport of the great unwashed? How was the audition? Tryout. Diane, in sports, it's called a tryout. - We got a team. - Yeah, of what, I'd like to know. I'm gonna call Gary and call it off. I'm telling you, when one lousy bar can't produce four decent bowlers, it's time for America to take a long, hard look at itself. Hey, you! You don't know anything about bowling, do you? Hey, Woodhead I asked you if you know how to bowl. You have bowled, haven't you? - Yes. - When? - When? - Before. - Before what? - Before I came to Cheers. You're good, aren't you? I won a couple trophies. Sammy. Sam, Sam, don't-- Don't call it off! What? What? Hold on a second. - We got a ringer. - Got a what? We got a ringer. Woody. Woody is a bowling machine. Trust me. He's got a room full of trophies. Hey, Gar. No, we're not wimping out. Yeah, tomorrow. Vic's Bowl-A-Rama. We rumble. Okay! Okay! - All right, Woody! - Woody! Please don't ask me to bowl. I can't. Why not? The tragedy. - Well, what tragedy? - What tragedy? Once I maimed a man in a bowling accident. I'll never bowl again as long as I live. Great idea, Sam. Bowling. Okay, it's time to go. Let's see if we can, you know, maybe somehow manage not to embarrass ourselves. Ladies and gentlemen, Knute Rockne. Come on, let's go. I wanna warm up. Hold on a second, guys. Say, Woody, it's still not too late to change your mind. Don't you understand? I maimed a man. Bowling accidents happen. You read about them in the paper all the time. He was only an innocent maintenance man. Come on, man. He knew the risks. I still don't know what happened. One minute, I was picking up the eight-ten split, and the next thing I know, the ten pin flies and hits old Sully right between the eyes and he goes down like a sack of wheat. Sam, I ruined the man's life. I'm sure you're exaggerating. Oh, no. No, I'm not. Old Sully got too dim-witted to stay in bowling maintenance. Last I heard, he was a clown at children's birthday parties. - Well, what's wrong with that? - He wasn't invited to them. Come on, Woody. Listen, man, I've never begged for anything in my life that I actually enjoyed once I got it. Come on. Please. Come on, join the team here. We need you, Woody. Come on. I can't! Since the accident, I haven't been able to set foot in a bowling alley. Well, why don't you just try it today. Maybe the memory's faded. - You don't understand what's at stake. - Can't you hear me? No! Sammy, I'll take a crack at him here. Listen to me, all right? Now, every once in a while you just gotta look beyond yourself, okay? And think about the team. Like my old high school football coach used to always say: "Give the ball to Peterson. He'll know what to do with it." Well, hey, I didn't want that responsibility, but for the good of the team, you understand, I took it. We went ahead and we had a great season. - Were you the fullback? - No, I was the equipment manager. - But that's not my point. - Oh, come on, Norm. You're wasting your breath. He ain't bowling. All right, think about that, Woody. Go team! Yeah! Not too shabby. Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! - Old Towne Tavern! - Quiet, you guys. Let's show our worthy opponent a little courtesy. Back off, buster, or I'll put Vaseline in your finger holes. Just try to touch my ball. I'm talking about your nose. - Choke on it! - Choke on it! You got the cheering under control. I'll mosey up to the bar for a beer. - You're gonna miss the game, Norm. - Then that's a perfect plan, huh? Hey, Cliffie, how're we doing here? Fifty pins down, sinking like a stone, Sammy. Norm! How the hell they know him here? He's got a life, you know. That's all right, man. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, Tawny, has anyone ever told you you make even bowling shoes look sexy? Don't you ever stop? You're fraternizing with the enemy. No, I'm just trying to distract her here so she won't know what to do. A little wink, a sexy nod, and a glimpse of these taut athletic buns. Oh, wait a second here, Tawny. Oh, what's this? I think your butt needs a tune-up. - Sam. - Hey, what're you doing here? I'm here as a driver only, but I brought someone with me who'd like to bowl. - Woody! - Woody! Hey, time out, Gary. - Who's taking care of the bar here? - Oh, don't worry. We closed it. We would have been here sooner, but it took a while to get those people out. Oh, well, great. Yeah. All right, go get some shoes on here. Woody! - What made him change his mind? - I don't know. He was right in the middle of doing something and he said, "l can't let the guys down. Let's go." Hey, Woody! How are we gonna do this? We've already started here. Cliff, what about your wrist injury? - What injury? - Don't make me hurt you. Easy, easy. Gary, we're gonna need an injury substitution here. Hey, you got it. The one thing I've never been called is unfair. I can believe that's the one thing you've never been called. All right, I'm gonna go fire Woody up here. The alleys. Thanks. It's really a sensory experience, you know. The scent of Aqua Net on a beehive hairdo. The roar of polyester against old Naugahyde. The sight of a cigarette stubbed out in a patty melt. All this, plus the anticipation of placing your feet in shoes only 7,000 others have worn before you. Woody! Yeah! All right! Let's go! Listen, if this is gonna be tough on you, I want you to know that you don't have to do this. No, I want to, Sam. You're absolutely sure? Oh, I'm sure. You all have been like family to me. I love you guys. Okay, all right, Woody. - Watch this, Gar. - Yeah. If you're having second thoughts, that's okay, pal. No, no, I want to do this. - Okay, I'm ready. - All right. All right. - Woody? - I wanna do this, Sam. Remember, I love you guys. I'm ready, Sam. It's okay, Woody. I'm gonna bowl. I don't know what I was worried about. This is easy. Those guys are dead meat. You know what I'm saying, Sam? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! Old Towne Tavern! - Hey, nice game, Sam. - Oh, get out of here. We said two out of three, and we're taking you to the wall. That's right! All right, all of you in favour of saving what shred of dignity we have left and sneaking out of here, raise your hands. That's one... Hey, how come you voted? You're not even playing. I thought we were ordering pizza. Sam, we can't quit. Listen, Sam, maybe we can sweeten the pot a little. - Get out of here, will you. - No, no, no. If you guys win, I'll set you up with Tawny. Maybe we can talk. And if we win, you set me up with the Sweetheart of Sigma Chi. Excuse me. I didn't date Sigma Chis. I was Phi Epsilon Delta. You girls had quite a reputation. Yes, for academic achievement. Is that what it was? Tell me, isn't it true that Phi Epsilon is Greek for "Hi, sailor"? Give me your shoes. Give me your shoes. - Oh, Diane, are you bowling? - Yes. - Come on. Well, are you any good? - Yes. And if you whisper a word of this to anyone who matters, I'll find you and I'll kill you. Did you think I came by my utter contempt for the sport by accident? Hardly. I took it in college. - You bowled in college? - Yes. I needed the PE credits. I could read between frames, and you didn't have to run. I spent six semesters sweating in a tawdry bowling alley. Bowlers don't sweat. They do when they're wearing tweed. In spite of my complete disdain for the experience, I have no intention of letting this lvy League lounge lizard insult me and my sorority sisters and send Cheers to ignominious defeat. Your mama! Chambers! Chambers! Chambers! Chambers! Chambers! - Chambers! Chambers! - Thank you! Thank you! Now put me down! I'm afraid of heights, and someone has very cold hands. Okay, everybody, line up. I'm pouring beers. I gotta hand it to you, Whitey. For once, you did something that didn't make me wanna shove a rat in your mouth and sew your lips shut. Such praise. I blush. - Congratulations, Sam. - Yeah. Thank you. Oh, excuse me. Continue celebrating. Huzzah, huzzah. - It was a great win, wasn't it, Sam? - Yeah, it was. - Thanks to you. - Oh, don't thank me. I've been amply rewarded just seeing how well you're taking this. The old Sam Malone would have died before letting a woman salvage his athletic pride. - You've grown. - You know something? I think I have. Oh, by the way. Tawny wasn't the only one looking sexy out there in bowling shoes. Well, thank you. No, oh, no, no. I was talking about me. You know, I'm surprised you didn't mention something. No, seriously, seriously. Great form out there. - Thank you. - No, no, I was still talking about me. All right, all jokes aside here, thank you very much for helping me beat Gary. Well, I was getting tired of listening to some ignorant blowhard take himself and some stupid competition so seriously. Boy, he really does that, doesn't he? No, I was talking about you. Subtitles by MACTwolf. City Worker 1: Is that why they need more juice?

Maybe it needs a little more insulation. Better go to acoustic. 'Kay. Not again. Billy: Flaming mole monsters under the city? are you listening to yourself? Dick: I'm listening and it has me terrified. Hayes– Miss Nance. Twelve more. there's lots of time Rita Man would he? Billy: Eighty-three? Eighty-three. You sold eighty-three tickets to the company picnic? Who to? Friends. Eighty-three friends? I don't even know eighty-three people. for x-rays. but we're not sure he was standing in the right spot. but... Company activities? All he's interested in is winning that free trip to Hawaii. Could I interest you in mole monsters in the sewer? if they hula. to the board you understand that it was the Humanidyne diving bell that recovered the–the treasure. this is more than a job! Richard. Why don't you give them a call? the reception'll be ruined tonight. I–I'll have insurance underwriters all–all–all–all over me! The papers'll make a field day of it. Ho–how will that look? I love it. monsters! Mole monsters hold Humanidyne by the throat". This is monstrous stuff. It's horrendous stuff. It really is. the narcoleptic's up. See if he wants to brush his teeth. It is horrendous. It's horrendous they were counting on me. they're counting on me. If anything happens tonight – if anything spoils this exhibit – it'll–it'll–this'll mean my career. stop talkin' like that now. huh? tell you what. okay? Yeah? One is that you buy a couple picnic tickets from me. -That's blackmail. And two is that you bring someone else in here who has seen– I think I just saw a girl run into a sewer. or is that too wild? huh? I–I can't. You have to have the invitations strictly come from the board–the bo– Richard. Mr. Buchre here buys a couple picnic tickets and we'll call it a deal. and that includes the keg race in the potato sack. It's a crazy time he would certainly buy a ticket. He would certainly– a thirty million dollar treasure don't you think? Do ya? You should talk to my accountant. now the state won't let me sell it. Historical artifacts". from all that work? and the stupid headaches like this that come from exhibiting it. Flaming mole monsters". I'd forget it. So I guess that's a "No" on the tickets? Is this the same girl you were talkin' about last week? she's driving me crazy. she dances. It's not like she's shy or anything. she's gone. Down into a manhole? It's the only place I can figure. I could never get near a place like that. Billy! It is a tunnel. This is a tunnel. It's a sewer and I'm not staying! babe. just think of this as a new life experience. Okay. I've seen it. I've smelled it. And I don't need it! Gloria. No passing on this ladder. Alright. See? you know. I certainly hope the board appreciates what I'm doing There are no monsters down here. We will verify the fact that there are no monsters and I will get back to my... he'll take care of it. Rats? ! everybody ready? Rats? ! Ho! no. It's–it's perfectly al– I–I thought I left my keys– Oh! Let's keep with the others. it's alright. Forget what I said about the rats. This place is clean. she's got nothing to worry about. This is–this is fine down here. You think you guys could maybe hold it down a little? I'm going back! Put me down! that's fine with me. It'll be alright. I think. I think so. we find them in nature and we've seen them in the Museum of Natural History. just– Even though they're filthy... Another life saved. here. Let's just see if this works. Eveready kid. Alright. does anyone else have the feeling that we're being watched? okay? El: Uh oh. Smells like something was burning here. Look. here's the flaming part of what those guys saw. Well. What about the monster part? too much further away. ho. Whoa! Hey! Gloria. Glo! Remind me not to jump out at your surprise party. You tripped it when you walked by. kids. so much for the mole monsters. Now can we get out of here? Wait a minute. This means there's somebody down here and personally I'd like to find out who B-Man's right. we might as well see what we can find. It's getting late. I'm gonna remember this! I'm never gonna forget it. Billy: Anyone feeling lightheaded? there's a light up ahead. I think we've seen enough. it's –the air down here is getting a little hanky. I think I'll take an air sample. And I think I should go back. Fine with me. over here! kid! Wait a minute! kid. It's okay. No one's gonna hurt you. Just take it easy. Just take it easy. You' re gonna be alright. is he okay? that's it! Everyone's out of here. We gotta get him where he can breathe. Is he gonna be okay? He's gonna be fine. He has a little pulmonary distress. Probably from breathing the bad air down there. ya know? about mole monsters? I–I think you're clear on that. I'm grateful. I want to thank you all for coming on down here then– right? Yeah? no. I'm just gonna ride with him. Jane's gonna meet us down there. I'll see you later. I brought your Walkman. a runaway? What else? Kid had the tunnel set up pretty well. Except for the air. Better hope nobody else is holed up down there. What? she's pretty cute. She's probably been watching me. I–I went over there. I don't think that's the right approach. The man's an animal. or something? but you're not in my plans. Not in your plans? You don't even know me! Right. Alright. My name's Johnny– and now has electrical problems with his amps. huh? gotta go. what's your name? Don't have one. Would you cut the bull and give me a straight answer? You have a strange way of getting a girl's attention. Gina. Pay the bus fare and I'll let you sit next to me. goldies 'What'd I say' Here comes Johnny singing 'I got a woman' trying to make it pay he got the motion the boy can play devotion Turning all the nighttime into the day He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman He do the song about the knife he do the walk of life Here comes Johnny with the power and the glory Backbeat the talkin' blues he got the motion the boy can play devotion Wanna help me find somethin' classy? I'm goin' to a party tonight. hold this. What d'ya have in here? The London Philharmonic? that's my life. Jeez. What are you doin'? I gotta try it on. Out here? Do you see a dressing room? I like it. It's fabulous! Aren't you thrilled? Oh yeah. Does it make you nervous? Richard. You mustn't let it. the security here is tremendous. Absolutely bomb proof. Ah! Thank you. mate? Of course. Can I ask you to hold down the fort for a while? I've got a few things to check on. Al. the poor guy's up in the air. El: Of course he is. He's floating. not MacGreve. I'm talking about Buchre. The guy's got thirty million in treasure he can't sell. It's just sittin' there in front of 'im. Kind of like me and these picnic tickets. Dr. Hayes. Herb just called and bought eighteen tickets. I'm taking him bowling. don't you think bribing the ticket buyers is a little out of line? Miss Nance? Do I know a Herb? El: The Invisible Man. Oh. Bowling. Could be interesting. I don't care where you live. I just think you should know that it's dangerous down there. What are you talking about? Where? In the tunnels. what is it with you and this tunnel fixation? We just pulled a kid out. I mean– couldn't we stop talkin' tunnels and start talkin' records? Records... An antique. Want one? Could you buy me Sting instead? Aww. You're a killer. Jane: Do you think that you could give me just a little hint of where you're from? No words. Just nod your head. Okay? Los Angeles? San Fernando Valley? Northern California? huh? He's been out on his own for a while. He just doesn't wanna trust anybody. I didn't wanna trust anyone either when they sent me to you. Do you remember how I broke the ice? Food. I figured that was it. I had to take mine. It was 'no relationships' from then on. and Gina went solo. Doesn't it get a little lonely? but you don't get hurt. Uh. I'm not here to hurt you. Hey. How 'bout an ice cream sandwich? Yeah. Okay. Let me get two ice cream sandwiches. Thanks. tell him I went looking for that girl. man. How ya gonna find out where she lives? I have a hunch it's somewhere near the museum. 'The Museum'. I thought the Museum was in New York. this pâté is wonderful. It's like velvet. Like mole velvet. I'm gonna take a piece of this for Al. Has anybody seen Al Buchre? He's gotta taste this. Al? Excuse me. I'm looking for the kid who was brought in from the Museum today. Just follow the girl with the pizza box. I don't wanna crowd 'im. and tell him it's from Gina? Oh! And one more thing. My mother's checking in soon for an operation. Do you have any rooms on this floor with a shower? Three-forty-one's empty if you'd like to check it out. thank you. mate. How many guards? Ten. Maybe twelve. Scamper like the rest when the tunnels go. make sure those valves are all the way open. How are they holding the gas? Well enough to panic five or ten city blocks. Providing some Jacks from maintenance don't set off another tunnel on their own. We should be okay as long as there are no more surprises like that bloody kid. but don't bother checkin' it out with juvie hall or foster homes. I made it up. Zack? I asked you if you lived down there. okay? you do need our help if you live down there. The air's bad. Really bad. Just the last day or so. We can handle it. 'We'? Who's 'we'? are there more of you living down there? you don't have to be afraid of us. I don't bite. she does. ladies. now this. Supposed to say it's from Gina. Gina! Gina! do you really think there are other people down there? -No. -Yes! whoa. Wait a minute. Let's pick one. I can tell when a kid's lying. I can tell when a kid's kicking. we gotta do something. are you okay? couldn't be better. what was that? Great. I finally isolated the gas that's in those tunnels. What is it? Methane. Girls? How'd you like to crash a party? Thank you. miss? Yes? Your invitation. Do you mean we were supposed to bring them? How gauche. Celebrities. We were simply interested in the technology. come here and take a look at this. Let's take a look at this goblet. This goblet alone is worth over six thousand dollars. Mr. Buchre would know. he's not here. He jus–he keeps disappearing. if you're doing all of this just for the hors d'oeuvres. this could be an emergency. I know– ya know? it's not gonna be that snobby. I know what's going on at these places. bud? the service entrance is around the back. I don't think you understand. We're– Psst! Come on! these people need us. good. I'm so glad you're here. The leaky toilet's in the second-floor men's room. Hayes. Jane. okay? is that you? we need some more sandwiches here. Thank you. but isn't that pushing it a bit? psst! What? Come on. What? What is it? You're not gonna believe this. I couldn't find Richard anywhere– Thanks. But I did see that wannabe that was flirting with Johnny B. they're terrific. The ones with the little red balls on top. I don't like caviar. Don't you think it's a little strange that she's here? What caviar? The little balls on top of that are red. it'll be all right. Salmon caviar's red. El. They use 'em as bait. Wha–what're–what're these little rice cakes with the yellow gooey stuff on top? What is that? There you are. I've been looking all over for you. The bathroom is– It's a long story Hayes? Richard. Methane? I told the bartenders only to serve– Richard. Methane. It's a gas. A what? It's a flammable gas. Do ya remember what happened in the Fairfax district? boom! The whole thing went. That was methane? the concentration under here could be higher than Fairfax was. This is something we should report right away. and now methane. Who the hell are you? Glo: He wasn't home. I talked to one of the guys in the band. Yeah? he went into the tunnels looking for that girl. Looking for Gina. if he even sparks– Don't tell me! Bukowski. You know 'im? what's he doing here? What are we going to do with him? That's the question. Leave him. but killing' a fella... Syl? Thirty million dollars. Is he worth it? Let's just finish what we came here to do. Right. and then get out of here. Gina! we've been looking all over for you. look. So I don't have an invitation. You wanna throw me out? we're friends of Johnny B. fast It's very dangerous for him to be down there. Unh-uh. You are talking to the wrong person. you've gotta understand what we're trying to tell ya here. too. but we have a feeling there are more of you. Wha? Who are you? Where's Gina? The air's better in here. You'll be okay. You're the guy in the band that plays in that garage on Hudson. Gina took me last week to listen to ya. You're good. Thanks. Wher–do ya know where she is? I think. they're all swimming around in a sea of methane down there. With a human sparkler. one spark from Johnny B and we're talkin' the Fourth of July here! Those guys in masks! spraying for cockroaches or something. Whoa! What guys in masks? Does she live here? you know? Mama Gina. Yeah. it's a lot better than livin' on the street. Or where the County put us. And that kid we pulled out this morning? Zack? Is he okay? We wondered what happened to 'im. he's fine. we won't be if we stay here very much longer. just forget about gettin' out. but we can't get far enough through the tunnels. so we just figured we'd ride it out. I don't think that's a very good idea. I can feel the gas comin' in please. Right this way. I–I found him. Here he is. Richard's filled me in on this methane stuff and I think it's ridiculous. You're making a big deal out of nothing. You always have methane under the city. Methane that's being pumped in? What? bleeding tanks into the tunnels. They're probably just city employees. El: Are you willing to take that chance? and someone – or something – sparks Boom! Boom? - Boom! - Boom! Al: Alright. Wait a minute. let's at least do it right and call the professionals. Would ya feel better if I called the fire department and had them check it out? That's a start. Good. Isn't he terrific? He's terrific. methane rises. I'll be back with some help as soon as I can. man. It's eight blocks to the nearest grate. Watch me. you're gonna stay right here until the authorities arrive. Do you understand? an–and some of the ones with the little squiggly Spam stuff on top. That's liver. Pâté. there are hundreds of tunnels down there. anyway? With Gina. where'd she go? Goon: They told you to call the fire department? That's great! Are you ready? we're ready. Will you be around soon? Al: I'm leaving right now. They'll make the big bang in... ten minutes? Right. Gina! They told me you were down here. I didn't believe 'em. we gotta get out of here. I got some people I gotta see. I was just there. You'll never make it. there's no air. We gotta get help. I don't need help. What are you so afraid of? you can't live your life solo. okay? they start screwing' up your life. I'm not–I'm not talkin' about a relationship here. I'm talkin' about getting me out of this tunnel so I can get some help for your friends. but it doesn't for me. Forget it. I don't need help either. I gotta get them out of there. Help me. Richard. The tunnel entrance in the basement's filled with gas. We'll say we got a big firecracker. what can I say? ! How'm I gonna break it to everyone? Everybody get outta here! There's gonna be an explosion! Get out! Richard. we gotta go back. You are not going anywhere. we gotta do something. We gotta get 'em outta there. Okay. I'll take ya. Blasting caps. Timers. I found 'em. There hafta be more. Does yours say the same as mine? Five and a half minutes. if–if you would. I'm–we're gonna do this again. everybody hurry right along. you can't take another trip down there. Look at you. let's go. Come on Gina B-Man. Come on. I'm fine. Gimme a mask. come on. Here's to the end of an otherwise fabulous career. fast. Gina: Here. there's no time. Gina. is there any kind of large opening out of these tunnels? serve as a safety valve if it explodes. not very big. there's a fountain! About a couple hundred yards from here. it's always locked up tight. Which way? You won't have time. Which way? Down that tunnel. okay? We're gonna check out the fountain. we're running out of time. I–I gotta find my bag. Go on. Al: The explosion'll take out the tunnels and bring real fire trucks so you'll blend right in. We go straight for the treasure? no looking around. And the alarm system will get knocked out? Sure. mate. Piece o' cake. shake it up! This is it. This has to be the fountain entrance that Gina was talking about. Locked! They're always locked! There's no hole? ! I thought we needed a hole? ! that would just leave the floor of the fountain. And that oughta come off like a piece of paper when the thing explodes. El? El: I don't think we're gonna live long enough to make the calculations Maybe. we gotta get inside. Can you do it? I think I can fit through here. My clothes are in the lunchbox. Here ya are. Here goes. Hit it. the methane'll blow right through the fountain. It's the course of least resistance. what moves these doors? What? What moves these doors? I'm still lookin'. we're getting a little short– El. A couple of big motors – too big for me to start. The best I can do is short the locks. Whoa! we're almost there. where's Gina?

Glo. let's go. I got one last little detail to take care of. get outta here! Al? Richard. Foul play. Just what I needed. this belongs to you. it belongs to the government and I'm gonna be a little too frail to enjoy it by then. This way I get the jewels and the insurance now. Richard You're going to regret this. you're gonna regret this more than I do. Not really. I ju– I've called the police. And they're gonna jump out of their hiding places and yell "Freeze"? Hopefully. Freeze! Johnny: Gina! we gotta get outta here. Come on. I think this is a good time to stop and–and reconsider the purchase of just a few more of these picnic tickets. they're only two-fifty apiece. and I think Hawaii would be a great–would be a great release. And I got all Don Ho's hits – I bought all of his greatest hits. And I love those–the–the drinks with the blue and yellow– I–I– get with it! I just don't understand it. Company picnic. Good times.

Maggie... - Give me a beer. - Not now! - A coffee, please. - Right away. Your bike's had it. Don't bother. It's due for the scrap heap. All the bums have left... We're on our own, eh? You're about to bullshit me. Stop it... shit! You'll never change! Shit! Hey, Rustine, let's get dressed up! We've got a date. Shall we call a taxi for the gentlemen? Don't bother. Be cool...

Want me to take off my shoes, now? What a bum! We can't do much with that! How much? - 200F. - 200F with a strip? A full strip's extra. How much? 200F, baby! Too much... He has a discount for a large family, you accept it? Go home and let me work. Oh, a hard-on, shit! Check that out! Let's go and screw Josephine. Not a bad idea. OK, ciao. - And Josephine? - l'm not in the mood. is anyone there? I'm stuck in the elevator! What you up to, Rustine? My husband'll be home soon. It's only 5pm! Not today! Don't be dumb... You should have come earlier. Couldn't make it. Where's Madjid? - Evening! - Hello, Josette. - Where's Stéphane? - ln the bedroom. Ready, Steph? Eat here, Josette? I must get home and put him to bed, he's tired. - Some hot soup? - Really, thank you. What about the strike? The strike's over, now it's the dole line. Go and fetch your father. Hurry up! Take off your shoes. Stay here, you! Stéphane, come and eat! I'm not hungry! Get up! Will you fetch your father or must I go? I don't understand. Don't understand? I'm tired, my legs are tired. You just sleep! Good-for-nothing! Bum! Listen to me! Why don't you get a job? Lazy bum! Listen to me! The neighbour, Mama, her Ali is a good boy. Works like a man, brings money to his mother. Doesn't smoke or spend his nights out. May Allah bless him! - Work, work... - l found a job. That's good, son. - But I need to be French. - What? French? Never! Never French! You hear me? Shit! Attack! Attack, attack! Calm down, J.R. Calm... - Looking for your Daddy? - Asshole! Not very warm, is it? Everyone's in a bad mood tonight! Keep it down, savage! Seen your face, black boy? This place is such a bore... Shut up! Where'll we go in winter? The club may reopen. It was your joint that got us thrown out. The guy who runs it smokes... Let's hear some music. This place is such a bore... This place is such a bore... Then go take a walk. Go sing somewhere else, my kids are asleep. Can't even talk in this hellhole! Then listen to my music. I do as I like, where l like! Give me that, nigger! Give it back, you don't know how to use it! What an asshole! Let's party! I'll record a song for you, OK? - Break it, I'll break you! - lt's coming. What's that jerk doing? Give that back, nigger. - Lucky it doesn't record smell! - Really! Ladies and gentlemen, we will now play back my fart. lt's majestic, unique, the only one that has no smell. Switch up the sound! That black's a jerk. The only one around and he's all ours. - That was close. - He almost busted my brains! - Who was it? - Don't know. - Think he'd warn you first? - Dumb shit! Watch it, the guy may have a machine gun. Careful! Postillon or Gévéor? Must have been a wino. - Pastelvin. - What? Pastelvin, can't you read? Real luxury! Let's check each floor. Can't have come from 1st or 2nd. - Don't bother, it was my dad. - Sure? He gets the stuff from my grandpa in the country. Tell your dad he's a stupid fucker. I did, so he threw me out. Where can we go now? - Your place? - lf you want. Not the basement, it stinks! I'm off. I'll be along. - See where your shit got us? - Enough! Walking daddy home? With me it was the opposite. My dad brought me home and kicked my ass! - ls that why he split? - Yes. Fuck off. I want him to laugh. He never laughs. Give it back, shit! Look, he's crying! Give it to him. You're a real idiot. Thanks. Chantal! - Want a coffee? - l haven't time. - 5 minutes... - l'm already late, Madjid. I'll walk you to work. We've nothing for you. You're just out of school... lt's hard to get you a job as a mechanic. There's always that course at F.M. I can sign you up. But I'd have to be French. You were born here... Take out French citizenship. I hear you have courses for driving school monitors. I'm sorry but your medical file indicates you have bad eyesight. - Me? - lt's written here. Sorry. Goodbye. Sir... lt's for the driving school course... Yes, come in. So, what's it like in there? And you still count on them... You little bastards! So... Learning to fuck, hey? Did they hurt you, Mado? Know what that is? Like an elephant's ears. That's the clitoris, idiot! And that... Know what that is? These kids don't know anything! Those are boobs, idiot. And Mado, do you know her? Well, she's not a bike. Caress her before riding her. You mustn't damage her. Start her up gently. We were there first and we left her intact. So think of the next guys. Say thank you to Mado. Thank you, Mado. Next time bring her chocolates. She loves them. Don't you, Mado? Move it out! Enough of your bullshit! Maggie, he's pissing me off! Get out... Go on, out! Faster than that! The first one to move buys me a drink! Bunch of tight-asses! Not one who lifts a finger... lD papers. Take me for an Arab? Don't get smart with me. Or this'll end badly. Patrick Fontaine... born 23l7l65... Cité des Fleurs. Hey, old man... Please, can't you send me to heaven? Just a little shot to help us forget. Even your mug. Why Rustine and not us? If you want to hook the complex, start here. Search him. Come back with your junk and we'll shred you! Hear me, you scum? Malika! Come quickly, daddy's hitting mummy! Stay here. Stop this, what's wrong? Let go of me, you filthy Arab! I'll kill that bitch! Let me go! Shit! Bitch! Whore... Shit-faced bitch! Bitch! I'll kill you! Not nice, Mr Levesque. You shouldn't drink like that. - Did I scare you? - A bit. You surprised me. Come with us? Where? Come and you'll find out. Stay here and wait for us, OK? Say thank you to the gentlemen. is it much further? My legs hurt. We're almost there. - Hello. - What is it? Like my sister? Joachim... How much? - fifty francs. - You joking? OK, see you later. When you're rich. Thirty! Coming! The pigs! This is for real. Both want a fuck? Then that's sixty francs. I want a beer before starting. It's over, grandpa. We've got to go. You get one go, not all night. Like her? A blonde, next time. Instead of shouting, you should bring us a beer! My back aches. You must have really got off with those monkeys! It makes me want to puke. The sex-starved jerks didn't make you come? The fun's all over, for me. - What's up? - Nothing. Tell me. Something's wrong, tell me what it is. Leave me alone. What's going on? Talk to me. Leave me alone. Here, take this. You think that can make me happy? Take it, I said. It's for your kid. She's putting on an act. You've been had, again. Turn off the TV. - Finished your homework? - A kiss... Everyone go and wash. Hey, you donkey! Aren't you ashamed of sleeping while your mother works? You'll get up early to see a girl, and a French one at that! I saw you! Aren't you ashamed? Mom, I need money for a notebook. Let me cry my heart out. This boy will be the death of me. - How much? - Fifteen francs. Go and get your father! Hello, Madj. Hi, lsa. - How's your mother? - Still shouting. She's right. You tire her out. You know you're not allowed alcohol. There's orange juice, if you like. Hey Pat... since your sister started work she won't talk to us. Don't mention work we'll start a fight. So, Miss Secretary... any work for a cleaner? A pretty girl shouldn't be stuck in an office. Cut it out. Coming, Madjid? Let's split. Are you coming? Here are my saviours. Get them a drink. What did you save her from? Shut up! It's not funny. It was for her kid. Anything new? A few, take a look. Good thing they put up the fence. Do up your pants, your tools are showing. Put it away before we cut it off! What's wrong? Mallard's wine. I stole it from his cellar. Let's see if that's true. Motherfucker! A toast to us! Hand over the bottles! Come on. Holy shit! We'll get smashed! What a party. You guys, we're having a party. Come on, there's wine and everything. It's Christmas! - Make room! - Go ahead. Shit, that's huge! Here's to old Mallard! Let's get out of here! Nice of you to drop by! Come on, dad? Son of a bitch! I'll show you... Come on, come on... I thought they weren't afraid of anything! He's out cold. Anita! Did you see Mallard's face? See Pelletier? Look at the motherfucker running! Well done. Hey, Pat... You brought your gang? Shut up, fat ass. We came here to learn. Looks like you guys have been done. This is a cinema, not a hospital. Fat Luc, you with your lady? Mind your business. Last time she came through here she came back on all fours! Ask her if she still has those blue panties. There's a fight in the air. Blood! Blood... lsn't your name Mallard? You live over in building B? Opposite from Pelletier? I know them. They booze up at the station bar on Fridays. Winos out! Winos out! That's really smart! - A quiet cuddle? - l'm dead! - Got a cigarette? - Yes. The last one. I'm going to see my mother. She'll have some cash. Mine shouts all the time. Mine too. Especially now my sister's working. Makes me look like a bum. Any news of your father? Neither him nor the neighbour. Then she must still fuck well. No reason to drop everything. We fucked her too but we didn't run off with her. I told my mom I went to the labour office to fill in forms. - Really think she believed you? - Yes! You can't even write. Got a little something? Where should we drop you? We have to go, we work tomorrow. We work, too! We can't leave like this... Start with our own then switch? - Mine's good, hey? - Not bad. You can start with her, as long as we're switching... Come on, between brothers... Alright, if you want. Your mother? - Where is she? - She's dead. - You're all alone? - My dad lives in the States. - He's American? - Polish. So you're Jewish. Shame you have your period. - How did yours fuck? - Cool it! Can't even joke, now. Chantal, get in. Rotten weather. You OK? What's wrong? You should stay in bed instead of following me every day. I wanted to see you. Yeah, right! What's with the car? It's a Citroen. Did you steal it? I didn't want you getting wet. - l won't stay in a stolen car. - l didn't steal it. You're full of shit! If I knew how, I'd tell you... - First, you have to change. - lt's you who's changed. - How was I before? - You didn't avoid me. is there a guy? A guy... Poor idiot. We haven't any mauve. The U's in yellow. No, you've done the O's, now do the U's. But there's no yellow. Hi, is he ready? - When will you be back? - Two days. And not three, OK? - Dad! - Hello, sweetie. I guess 3 days would be too much, like paying child support. I'm in the shit, I'll give it to you later. - Come see what I've done. - l'm coming. Show me your works of art. Show me how much progress you've made. The teacher wrote that? - No, I did. - l hope so! And what's this? Can you read this? I've lost my job, you know. Come on, let's go now. - Are you coming? - No, I'm busy. - Let's go to the sea. - Yes! You OK, Steph? In good shape? Happy? What's wrong? What's going on? Oh, sweetheart... Come on! Mom! Give him a spoonful if he coughs, and see he has a pillow. What's wrong? Shit! What are you doing? Leave that alone! Hey, you guys! Hi, Balou. It's Balou! Unbelievable, he's back! I thought he was still inside. Check out the car! Look at the bills! We could make them fall off. Look! Holy shit, he's rolling in money. Look at that bird! Mamma mia, check out the chick! I can't see anything. What a honey! She's shaved her pussy, brother! I can see everything. Whatever. That's much more interesting. You don't get it, it's an old bet. To the winner! Once more... Thanks, Balou! Let's drink to this! Where have you come back from? He couldn't read, either. The-tea-harem-of-Archimedes. The theorem of Archimedes. You've been drinking? Drunkard! Now he's taken to drinking. That's all I needed. Aren't you ashamed? Drunkard. Good-for-nothing! Bum! What will the neighbours think? He's killing me. Madjid, my son... I'm worn out. I'm going to ask the Consulate to take you home. You'll do your military service. You'll learn your own language and you'll become a man. It's the only way. I'm tired of trying to make you see, you don't understand. Help me, my son... What's left for your mother? You're ruining yourself and me as well. Think of your brothers and sisters. I'm worn out, tired. May Allah protect and forgive us! Stéphane, and mama and Josette. Four, three, two, one... Happy New Year! My God! What's happening to us now? Madjid, hurry up! Go up to Josette's apartment. Quickly! Don't do it, Josette! Oh, Allah! What about the little one? My God, Josette, don't do it! Tomorrow I'll find you a job. A good job... Well paid. I'll hire you, tomorrow. At the canteen. You'll be a waitress, it's well paid... She's a kid, she owes me 3 months rent. The fire brigade is on its way. Tomorrow, Josette! I'll find you work! Tomorrow... Allah... Your little boy, who will he call mother? Think of the boy... We're with you. No, Josette! Don't! Your little boy will be looking for his mommy! Mom, look at my Babar! Allah! At Auteuil, the filly Nougatine could well beat Mégalite, also doing well, and still the favourite... News flash from Jean Gallé: The body ofa North African was found on the banks of the Seine. The initial identification has been made as a Mr Lakhdar... Lakhdar, Lakhdar, my son... They've killed my son. Yesterday they got Abdelir at Nanterre, and Kader at Vitry. They got Touffik at La Courneuve... Tomorrow who will it be? - Tomorrow, it'll be you! - Tomorrow, it'll be you... - lt's no good. - What's no good? It's too fast. Yes, it's too fast. We'll take it again... What's it about? His mother made another scene yesterday. Any jobs going? Come by and ask. Tomorrow? But no fucking around, or I'll get it. Don't worry. Hey, Frenchie, you want to act with us? We need a white guy to play a cop. What does it pay? You'll never change. Which side is the street? Stop wasting time. - l don't know how to do it. - l'll show you one last time. I don't care. Get out. This is your nice easy job? - They threw you out too? - lf you like. Don't say you left so as not to let me down. I didn't mischief! I will see all three of you in the stocks in the morning. - God have mercy, It is the truth! - If you condemn us Sir, the king will die and you will be held accountable. Your Majesty! Your loyalty and concern for my safety do you credit, Mr Oates. Where is your proof? Safely hidden from prying eyes, Your Majesty. A wise precaution. and tell me who are the English Catholics behind this terrible conspiracy? Give me names. Beyond the queen and the Duke of York, there are the Lords Stafford, Arundell, Wardour, Powis, Petre, Belasyse, Wakeman, the queen's physician, and Edward Coleman, secretary to the Duchess of York, among many others. This is nothing more than a list of every eminent Catholic in the land! I have letters proving their guilt. Follow me, Mr Oates. Bring your friends with you. You never said anything about letters! If I had, the Jesuits would have cut your throat to find them. Stand firm. We shall beat the devil yet. What was your business at Whitehall, Mr Oates? Who invited you here? I attended on your ministers many times to warn of the Catholic peril. Alas they never had time to see me. My sympathy. Sometimes they're so busy they hardly have time for the king himself. But still, after so many hours here, you must have come to know my palace well. Intimately, sir. Then you will have no difficulty in leading us to the place in the Queens house where you heard this treason being plotted. This is where I heard them planning your death, Your Majesty. Most convenient for any traitor with a weak stomach! Your Majesty, I remember it clearly. It was a long room... with tall double doors... You do not know your way because you've never been here in your life before! Nothing this scoundrel says can be believed! I'm off to Newmarket in the morning. Do not bother me with this again. At your service, my lord. (DANBY) Let me hear your explanation again Sir. I have known Lord Powis these many years. - This is not his hand. - The writing is disguised. - The Jesuits teach such skills to their disciples. - They teach well. Not one of these seditious letters resembles its author's customary hand. You say you know these conspirators intimately. - Who wrote this? - Lord Stafford. Of all these villains, he is the worst. Stafford is a distinguished Fellow of the Royal Society and nigh on 70 years old. He has a vicious spirit of a villain half his age and is closely allied to the Duke of York. Examine the Duke's household, and you will find all the evidence you need of treason. Strike now, my lords! Hesitate and all might be lost! Stop! There is no conspiracy, is there? Hm? The truth now, or I'll beat the life from you. Every word is gospel. Bring me a Bible and I will swear... I know baseless malice when I see it. What is your purpose in all this? - Is it money and preferment you seek? - You insult me, sir. Christ himself, he came to me in a dream! He charged me with the protection of the Protestant faith in England. I was a minister... in a Catholic school... and the boys laid false and filthy charges against me, and I lost my position. I'm determined to have my revenge on their whole stinking blasphemous faith! You have chosen the moment for your game well. In such a desperate time, even your ridiculous lies might be believed. What will you do with me, sir? I have reasons of my own to let your poison circulate unhindered. If others cannot tell a fake when they see one, that is their misfortune. What of the king? He doesn't believe me. The king has more pressing concerns, schoolmaster. 5,000 pounds on a single turn of the cards? ! If you shout at me, I shall faint. Now you expect me to honour your debts. Well, I cannot afford it! You have stolen my honour! Now you mean to make me a beggar! If you need money, why don't you ask your patron Louis? - The King of France gives me nothing. - Of course he does! - He values his little spy in my bedroom too much to neglect her. - I am not a spy! Do you think I don't know about your clandestine audiences with the French ambassador? What do you talk about, I wonder,the English weather? I cannot live with such wicked treatment! You know how delicate I am. If I fall ill and die, it will be your fault! You are not going to die over a few cross words. Of course I'll pay your creditors. But you must be more careful in future. 5,000 is not very much. Is it? We won't talk about it any more. There, now. It's all better, isn't it? The king still loves his little Fubs. These letters were for Louis. You say you will work to destroy the Protestant heresy and restore the Catholic faith to England, that you pray for the day the Duke of York takes the king's place! As God is my witness, I meant no harm to anyone. These are dreams, not plots. Opinions of no significance. You shared your ambitions with the Duke of York. He encouraged you in this! The Duke of York is innocent of any crime. I swear I am no traitor. (CHARLES) I asked you to end this matter. Now it is infinitely worse. What London believes is more important than the evidence. The mob will soon grow bored of Oates' ridiculous accusations. - Put the perjuring villain in prison. - He's under the protection of Parliament. Oates will give Parliament all the excuse it needs to strike at Catholics. God help any poor creature that gets caught in his net. Oates said Coleman's letters would contain treason, and they did. A lucky chance, nothing more. Picture your own wives and mothers, sons and daughters, tied to stakes in the midst of flames, screaming out to God with hands and eyes uplifted to heaven! On the outside the Catholic looks like us, eats, drinks and sleeps like us, but inside he is not as we are. He hates our liberty and works every moment to destroy it He would make slaves of us in our own country Only Parliament can protect England from the yoke of tyranny! A warrant from Parliament for the arrest of Lord Stafford. - On what charge? - Treason. - Father! - This is some error or false accusation... You are mistaken! Please! Please help me! No! No! No! Please! Please! Please! No! No! God in heaven have mercy on me! I am innocent... The queen is a Catholic and yet is well known for her loyalty and devotion. This plot cannot be any of her doing. She is mistress in her own household. Nothing takes place there without her consent. I heard from her own lips that she would no longer tolerate the king's lechery and violation of the marriage bed. She told the Jesuits that she would have her revenge, and promised them 5,000 pounds for the deed! I accuse the queen of conspiring to cause the king's death! The man's a fraud. I know you'd never do anything to harm me. You know it, but does England? Oates has the whole country terrified. You understand there is no truth in what he says? - Do I look like a fool? - Clever men hang on his every word. Common sense counts for little where religion is concerned. - Are you not frightened of the Papists, then? - I'm more frightened of the mob. - Mobs have their uses in the right cause. - Parliament's cause. For 20 years, we have fought to see who rules in England. Now the time has come to settle the matter once and for all. This useless body of mine is like some rotting piece of meat. It decays inch by inch, moment by moment. I have little time left, but I am determined that before I die, this country will be freed for ever from the unbridled power of kings. Parliament will rule in England. Attack the king himself, and I can go no further with you. Let the old goat frolic with his whores in the time he has left to him, but his heir will be Parliament's choice. The king loves you above all others. The bravest and most brilliant of his court. (MONMOUTH) Such virtues come naturally. I must take no credit for them. The king would show you greater favour if he could. He would name you as his heir. The Duke of York's claim cannot be allowed to stand. A Protestant king for a Protestant country. The king will never acknowledge me as his true-born son. The king must appear to support his brother. In private, he yearns for your success. When the tide in your favour becomes irresistible, he will bow to an act of Parliament declaring you legitimate. He told you this? Be bold, and you shall have your reward. God save the king! I have never run away from a fight and I will not start now. It's to avoid a fight that you must leave for a time. With the introduction of the House of Commons bill, your succession hangs in the balance. Your presence here is a constant reminder of their grievance. Will I be allowed to return, or will you betray me in favour of your preening bastard Monmouth? You're my brother... and my heir... and what is mine is mine. I will not allow Parliament to dictate the succession. Now for pity's sake, will you help me? Your Majesty, there is a further matter of the gravest importance. I have in my possession... letters from the king's chief minister begging for aid from our oldest and most implacable enemy! Filthy French money... for the king to rule alone in defiance of Parliament? ! What shall we call this but treason pure and simple? Danby must be impeached before this house for his dealings! It's that French bitch Carwell! Drag her out and put the Papist whore in the stocks where she belongs! Good people! You are mistaken! I am the Protestant whore! I am called a prostitute, and summoned before Middlesex jury! My God! To stand before the common herd, accused of being no better than a street girl! It is nothing more than a tactic designed by Shaftesbury to provoke me! I'll see that the Chief Justice strikes down the warrant. I am a lady of breeding... I have family and connection... - I am not a harlot! - I know that. They mean to destroy me, Fubs. Shaftesbury has copies of my letters referring to subsidies granted you by the French king. They talk of the secret treaties signed in your name, but there is no proof, thank God. He can be discredited as a liar. The king's position grows weaker every day. He has done everything in his power, but he can no longer defend your conduct. I wrote to the French king on your authority, Your Majesty. - You must stand by me. - You of all people know he cannot do that. Parliament is attacking him through you. His only hope is to cut you adrift. Acknowledge the letters were written on your own initiative. The king knew nothing of them. Parliament already has the scent of blood. I will be torn apart! If you resign, the king may yet come to some understanding with his enemies. I'm guilty of nothing more than obeying Your Majesty's command. These treaties were your creation in every detail! I know nothing of any secret treaty. I have put the king before everything, and you see my reward? Be careful loyalty does not bring you to the same end! Danby must pay the full price for his treason. (CHARLES) He has resigned. That is penalty enough. I have granted him a pardon for any offence he might have committed. You cannot do that. You have dragged a loyal servant down into the mud. I will not permit you to murder him into the bargain! There are thousands of your loyal subjects in the streets in protest at this Popish plot. We can only guess at what chaos will follow if you save the traitor Danby and allow a Catholic to succeed you on the throne. The people have been greatly excited by false rumours and accusations. You know that better than anyone, George. The peace of the country demands the Duke of York's removal from the succession. The peace of the country has always been my most pressing concern. Then name Monmouth as your heir. You must sign the bill excluding your brother from the throne. - Parliament has yet to pass such a bill. - It will. There can be no doubt of that. Accept what must be, sir. You have no choice but to abandon the Duke of York. He cannot defy the will of Parliament for ever. I will make him crawl to the House begging for exclusion. He is in a game he knows he cannot win. It is a question of WHEN he gives in, not if. Perhaps we must remind him of that. The mob yearns for blood. Very well. The mob must have it. Your Majesty... I come not as your king, Lord Stafford, but as your friend. And as your friend... I urge you to confess yourself guilty to the verdict of treason found against you. I'm innocent of any crime against Your Majesty in thought, word or deed. - I know that. - Then how can I say otherwise? Confess now and your life can be spared. A few false words... and in a year or two, a few months perhaps, you can return home to your daughter. I would be disgraced, condemned as a traitor from my own lips. All honest men would know the truth. I've been a loyal servant to your martyred father and to Your Majesty all my life... and that is how I shall die. You must sign. - It is the king's prerogative to grant mercy. - Not in such a case. What is a king, then... if he has no power? It is in order to preserve your power that you must sign. The whole of England is baying for Stafford's blood. If you do not give them what they want, they will turn their anger on you. Lord Stafford has been found guilty by the courts. Oates's lies condemned him. If you overturn the law, you give Parliament an excuse to do the same. That path leads to war and rebellion. Is that what we have come to? An innocent man must be sacrificed to preserve the sanctity of the law? Your father chose open defiance of Parliament, and the outcome was his own destruction. You must be more subtle than him. May God forgive me. God will understand. You have more confidence in him than I. My beloved daughter, your father has this comfort. I die totally innocent of what I am accused, and confident of God's mercy. You must take solace in that, as I do. You summoned me, sir? I've had many accounts of your progress about the country. I'm told that wherever you go, you are greeted as a king. Is it my fault if the people wish to express affection for me? You little fool! Can you not see how you are dancing to Shaftesbury's tune? - Do not treat me like a child! - You could not be more of a rebel if you took up arms and marched on Whitehall! You will never be king! Understand that, and you'll be happy. Dispute it, and you will die a miserable traitor's death. You lack experience and wisdom. But now you must do as I say. You will go to your cousin Mary in Holland... and stay there till I call for you. - I will do anything you tell me, Father. I would sooner die than insult you. On no account return to the court until I summon you, do you understand? Of all my children, you are the first and most beloved. Obey me... and we'll both be content. I never thought to see my oldest friend in the ranks of my enemy. It is a matter of politics. My personal feelings are of no importance. Personal feelings are everything to you. Shaftesbury has only the people's good at heart. He has no grievance against you. He is sincere in his convictions, but when did overturning kings become a pastime of yours? Perhaps when the king betrayed England for 30 pieces of French silver. - Your name was on the French treaty. - I did what was required of a good servant, and what did I receive in return? Lies, deception, the elevation of others above me in your government! We two together could have ruled Europe, let alone England! But you never trusted me as I deserved. Trust and good government cannot live side by side. You neglected me in favour of worthless placemen. I've forgiven your many betrayals... your schemes and your plots... because in my heart, I knew you loved me. But now I see you always loved yourself more. And I find I am a jealous king. I must have unconditional love or nothing. You have a need for sycophancy, not love. And those who rely on flatterers for their comfort are condemned to live and die alone. Tell your master Shaftesbury to summon Parliament. I will address the House. Then you accept the exclusion of your brother from the throne? What must be must be. Goodbye, George. I received your message. Is it time? Be brave, Charles. What if the king means to fight as his father did? He has too much intelligence and too few principles for that. And unlike his father, he knows when a battle is lost! Talk of the exclusion of the Duke of York from the rightful succession is treason. Any who speak of it set themselves against legitimate authority, and are the heirs in spirit to those rebels who so recently plunged our country into rebellion and civil war. Can anyone here contemplate such evil without horror? Let there be no confusion. The Duke of York is my heir and will remain so. His right is ordained by God, and no man may alter it. Anyone who denies this truth makes themselves an enemy of God, king and country. Think on that before you take another step towards chaos. All the world may see what a point we have come to. Nothing that begins in such division is likely to end well. I declare Parliament dissolved. Gentlemen, go home. I will not trouble you any further. What is happening? What did the king say? It is not what he said. It is what he is. England has chosen to trust the superstition of kings rather than the wisdom of its own judgment. He has dissolved Parliament and will rule in his own right. Exclusion and Parliament are finished with. Our time will come. Not today... but soon enough, though I will not live to see it. Wait here to be arrested... or make your peace with the king if you can. For my part, I am weary of Whitehall. I have neglected my wife these last 20 years. I think it is time I went home. He is never too busy to see me. The king gave you no authority to return from exile. Such defiance is treason. If you are still in England at dawn tomorrow morning, you will be arrested. How long? How long before I can come back? Never. Which tie would sir like to wear now? Spoilt for choice. So bloody wonderfully spoilt for choice. (MUSIC: HANDEL'S "MESSIAH") Missing Melinda? Yes. - She didn't go home to escape the war? - No. You were too much in love. No one steps back from love. Not even if there's a war on your doorstep. It was something I told her. What did you tell her? I told her about me. About what you do? Yes. I don't want you to tell anyone else about this. Don't tell Moscow. We can deal with this. Can't we? Can't we? This is highly irregular. What is it? - Has something happened? - Yes. You seem a little nervous. One of our mutual friends in trouble? I just wanted you to know there are no British agents working inside Russia. None. Anything else? I want out. I want to stop working for British Intelligence. I'm more tired than it's possible to be and my nerves are shot. - Moscow doesn't let well-placed men leave. - Unless they're better-placed elsewhere. - For example? - The royal family, chatting with the King. We've lost a man, or rather, he's in limbo. He worked for us, then he went quiet. You've changed the subject. We think he may have access to very important secrets and the responsibility has affected him. It can happen. A weaker man than you. Where is he? His name is Cairncross and he's working in Bletchley Park. I wonder if you might dig him up and see how he's feeling. If you did a good job, Moscow would look favorably on your request. I'm getting nods and winks. I think promotion is in the air. - Anthony? - I'm being followed. - Are you sure? - No, not entirely. Will you do something for me? Moscow wants me to visit a friend who's gone quiet. - Where? - Bletchley. Tomorrow. I want you to follow me. And see who else is forming a queue behind Anthony Blunt. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Mind the doors! Stand clear! Mind the doors! - I know who they are. - Is the game up? Are they MI5? They're Soviet, Anthony. They're Soviet. Bletchley is half a mile from here. Is there anything you said that could have been misinterpreted? - No. Nothing. - I don't understand. Why? - The look on his face. - Who? What? Henry. When I told him Britain had no agents inside Russia. His look was disbelief. - But it's true. - I know it's true. But Moscow has an ego that doesn't believe that Britain isn't paying them attention. - They think we're lying? - Feeding them disinformation. - They think we might be... - Double-crossing them. Moles? What do we do? Tell them we're not? No. We'll make sure we get the biggest secret there is and pass it on. If a gift is large enough, it always comes with love, and they'll see that. I know why you're here. It must be a lonely life. 12-hour shifts of code breaking and then back here to the gas fire and the crossword and damp bread for tea. You won't get at me. I've made my mind up. Are you thinking straight? Codes, codes, codes. It must dominate the mind. It's very simple. The Red Army is hopelessly infiltrated by German spies. If we tell the Soviets what we're getting from Enigma, the Germans will pick it up. Have you seen the casualty figures? 30,000 a week on the Eastern front. 30,000 Russians every week. I think there's a moral obligation to help them. But I understand. Your world is small. I don't blame you for not seeing the moral perspective. It's winning us the war! Breaking the code. We know so much about what the Germans are doing, and if the Germans find out and change the code... that would damage us very, very badly. Us? The 30,000 are us too. Aren't they? If the average Russian weren't prepared to die fighting the Fascists, Hitler would be in Downing Street now. Churchill doesn't mind if Russians die in their millions because they're not "us". That's his moral perspective. "Let the Reds die." The answer is no. I won't do it. That's my choice. The answer is not no. The answer is you made a bigger choice some time ago to work for Moscow to fight Fascism. And that doesn't go away...ever. I hope you understand that. - Are you threatening me? - Of course. Of course I am. Not tonight, Jack. - It used to be so exciting. - Sex? - Spying. - I don't like that word. It's so underhand. Excitement was one of the main reasons for doing it - apart from the good reason. The whiff of danger, all that. I think I've been running away from boredom all my life. A flight from ennui. - It's funny... - Funny? You, I talk to. Is it getting too much? Anthony... Is it? Look at me. Look at me. Melinda. I lost the baby, Donald. He died. - He was born and he died. - He? - We missed you yesterday. - I went to see an old friend who's unwell. Would you mind, Angleton? Walter Krivitsky. He's with the Soviet Embassy in Washington. - Or he was. - Where is he now? He's coming over to us and we've got a taster. We've got a mole inside the British intelligence services. Does he give a name? A tall, fair Scot with bohemian tastes from a well-to-do family. - No name? - Not yet. - Is he the real thing? - We're checking. We have Krivitsky holed up in a hotel in Washington. A tall, fair Scot. Bohemian tastes. Any ideas? Can I have a look at the file? Krivitsky. To D-Day - the start of the end of the war. - I didn't know you two knew each other. - Americans in London. We're a couple of swells, we stay in the best ho... Hello, darling. - Drink? - Uh-huh. Happy again. Dangerous thing - happiness. - We should have dinner. - Donald's very busy. - Just the two of us. - He's the jealous type. So tell him you're meeting a woman. How about it, Melinda? A couple of swells and a hell of a dame. (MELINDA) Kim. Excuse me. What was all that about today at the office? - It's secret. - Secret? It must be something big if the Yank is not permitted to know. But not so secret that Mr. Blunt can't hear it. - A tall, fair Scot with bohemian tastes. - Donald. Donald. Krivitsky will have to be taken care of. Few people know of his intended defection and I'm one of the few. If he is "taken care of", some others - not many - and me. We have no choice. If he identifies Donald, we all go down. We're like skittles - one goes, we all go. - The domino effect. - Dominoes, skittles - we fall together. No choice, Kim. We're in this together. Moscow will have to be told. And don't tell Donald. You look like a ghost walked through you. Cheer up, Anthony. It could be worse. I need to pass water. Shut up, can you? Just shut up. You always kept parts of your life in separate compartments. Painting, spying, sex...royalty. You can close a compartment down and it's as if it's never been there. But this time it's your friends that you're trying to close down. And they don't belong in one of your compartments. They're your heart. You're closing down your heart. That's the end of life. - Guy... - Top secret. Private. - Guy... - Quick. Out. Whelk? Don't you Soviets understand English any more? Would you like a fucking whelk? Do you know what that is? A list of agents we're dropping into Albania by parachute. Where, when, who. And it's all yours, Boris. So Moscow can arrange to catch them as they fall. Bumpy landing, eh, Boris? Out of the sky and into the arms of death. Bump 'em off, Boris! Bump-bloody-bump! Walter Krivitsky, Washington. Your embassy thinks he's on leave, but he's in a hotel. If the Americans think he's the real thing, he'll defect. You know which hotel? Yes, I do. We're grateful. Moscow is grateful. Thank you. There is something delicate we would like you to undertake on our behalf. It's a retrieval job. And it concerns the Duke of Windsor - my fool brother - and some letters he wrote to a relative in Germany. What kind of letters? Letters that speak of his love for Germany and his... fondness for Herr Hitler. Letters we should like to have under our control. It would be an honor. Here's a note authorizing you to take possession of the letters. I know that we can rely upon your finesse in retrieving them and your tact once you have brought them home. - The hush-hush work... - If you do this for us... it will be the last hush-hush thing you do. I shall see to that. I don't care if the Queen of Sheba has given you authorization. This castle is American territory in Germany and we decide what stays and what goes. - Would you at least call your HQ? - This is my HQ. Then call your commanding officer. Wait there. - Head for the attic. - Why the attic? Aristocratic families are all the same - secrets at the top of the house. Bad news, I'm afraid. My CO says nothing leaves. I understand. I quite understand. Has anyone ever told you how beautiful you are? We are very grateful. We should like you to accept a position. Surveyor of the King's Pictures. Welcome to the family. - Did you manage to...? - No more hush-hush. Thank you, sir. - Safer life in art. - Yes, sir. Much safer. (DOOR CRASHES) (LOUD JAZZ MUSIC ON RADIO ) You heard? - Suicide. There was a note. - Three young children left. - You should have looked after him better. - What? He was in Washington. He was your man. You let him slip. You Americans have got a lot to learn. - James Jesus Angleton. - What about him? - Haven't you noticed? - What? - I think he's keen on Melinda. - Aren't you becoming a little paranoid? (JAZZ MUSIC QUIETLY PLAYS) I've got something to tell you. - I've made us safe - all of us. - What do you mean? The one thing about this country of ours is that we have a royal family who are loved and cherished by all. Nothing can be allowed to tarnish their image. Windsor cosying up to Adolf? The nation couldn't bear it. The Duke and the Fuhrer cheek to cheek would break our heart. What are you getting at, Anthony? I went to Germany and I took photographs of some letters - letters that suggest the Duke and the Fuhrer were very good friends. If someone were to suggest that any of us might be traitors... I'd be perfectly happy to whip out the photographs. I think they'd dissuade any prosecution. We're safe. Brilliant! Come on, you. I'm in with the King. - The Kremlin's interested... - Tittle tattle. They want me to spend more time with the Windsors. How much more time? All of my time. My God. My God, you're backing out, aren't you? You've lost your nerve, haven't you? Anthony? - Anthony. Tell me I'm wrong... - I've made you safe, Kim. Safe? ! You've left me in charge of two mewling infants! I trusted you. I gave you all my trust. We trusted each other. I had a man killed to keep us safe and what have you done? You've smashed it up! One fucking skittle has taken a walk. You bloody fool. You bloody, bloody fool. (ALL SING) For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow And so say all of us... Give me 15 seconds. Let's talk about it. - Do excuse me. Wait here. - What? Hello, Colonel. - Blunt. - Fancy bumping into you. - Haven't seen each other since... - I packed in the hush-hush. Can't fathom a man giving it up for art. Never trust a man who looks down his nose at art. Although, looking down your nose, you arrive at your moustache and can't see much at all. - Are you trying to be funny or insulting? - Insulting. I'd finished in hush-hush, so I packed it in. Finished what? Passing the name of every MI5 agent onto the Russians. Good to see you, Winter. - About now, he should be telling Liddell. - If Liddell trusts us. - He does. - As a Cambridge man. If every security issue goes through Liddell, he'll block anything awkward. - We're safe. - Liddell the road block. Anthony Blunt's been passing the names of our agents to the Russians. What? ! Says who? - What? - Says Anthony Blunt. He told the Colonel. Pompous fool, Winter. Wouldn't spot a tongue in a cheek in a million years. - Fool. - He wants me to pass it to the headmaster. - Will you? - Of course not. Make me look an idiot. - Moscow is pleased. - Good. Donald Maclean has been posted to Washington. Stop telling me what I know and tell me what you want to say. You and Mrs. Maclean are friends. She likes you. - I want you to suggest something to her. - What? That she spends some time in New York with her family. Maclean needs to be run by our best man, and he's in New York, so Maclean will have to visit New York. - A wife in Manhattan is perfect cover. - But you need her to agree. We think you might be in a position to persuade her. So how's married life? I bet she knows the difference between cottage pie and shepherd's pie and can quote from all of England's best-loved poems. Am I right? Have you married someone who irons your underpants? Do you think it's possible to love two people at the same time? I think it's possible to be two people at the same time. I'm scared, Kim. - Why? - I'm pregnant again. - Why does that scare you? - Donald. It's hard enough for him as it is. Becoming a father, having a child, will make it harder still. Do you forget sometimes which is which? The real and the secret? Your question assumes that the two are not the same thing. It might be an idea for you to spend some time apart from Donald. - He'd hate it. He's drinking a lot... - I'm thinking of you, Melinda. Why don't you have the baby in New York? Be with your family. Donald can come over from Washington at weekends. You're very kind to me. Am I safe, Kim? People like me - wives and outsiders - we're not supposed to know, and if we do know, we're a threat, aren't we? Moscow doesn't know. Why not? I haven't told them. That's a kind of betrayal, isn't it? It's the first time I've lied to them. I should go. What's the difference between cottage pie and shepherd's pie? Cottage pie is beef, shepherd's pie is lamb. - Do you believe in ironing underpants? - Absolutely. What is this? "Stand the church clock still at ten to three..." "And is there honey still for tea?" Lights out. - You're highly regarded. - Thank you. So alongside attending all those interminable Embassy drinks parties, I want you to do an important job for me. Yes, Ambassador. Secretary to the Joint Policy Committee on Atomic Development. The bomb. The bombs. Make it your bag, Donald. I want a good Brit among the Yanks. We should know everything they know. I'm not sure they agree. - Right. - Be aggressive about what you want to know and listen hard. I won't have the Yanks getting possessive about it. - Come for a drink on Saturday. - I can't, I'm afraid. Oh, yes. Wife in New York. Good idea. Wives and work should be kept separate. Or do I mean wives and life? Yes, I think I do. Life on the one hand and wife on the other. (WOMAN GROANS) Will it be long? (GROANING) - Could we have a minute alone? - Yes. I want us to have a new start. I'm going to tell them I can't do it any more. - Don't make promises you can't keep. - I'm going to do it. I want a normal life. I want to look after my son and not feel that half of me's absent. I have to go. Do you? I'm going to tell them it's over. There's something I want to say. My wife had a baby today. Let's make the world a better place for him. How do you know it's a boy? You're our most important agent. If we could send flowers, we would. Your appointment to the Joint Policy Committee on Atomic Development - you think you might access the Atomic Energy Commission? - It's nuclear physics, for God's sake. - Listen, Homer... Please stop the spy stuff. Homer? It's ridiculous. You know my name. I thought agents weren't supposed to know their codenames. - We can help you with nuclear physics. - An evening course? We have man inside weapons program - a physicist. He can tell you everything. - Then, get him to bring what you need. - He doesn't have your access. So a spot of nuclear physics with my work at the Embassy, my new baby, the Embassy social whirl, keeping my wife happy and my run-of-the-mill spying. America has weapons that could destroy Soviet Union. We do not have same weapons. There are those inside US Government who advocate using these weapons. This is most dangerous time for our cause. You are very important. We care about the stress you are under. But in the scheme of things, forgive me for seeing your personal problems as secondary. You have something personal with you - a photograph or something? Need a guide? - She is beautiful, your wife. - Yes. Are you married? They tear all our loved ones in half. - Does she know about what you do? - She is dead. - I'm sorry. - Committed suicide. Strange term - "committed suicide." Like a crime. She killed herself because she couldn't stand to live in a world with the Nazis. Her suicide was an act of profound moral principle, not a crime. Donald Maclean. - We're not supposed to exchange names. - No. Against the rules. Klaus Fuchs. - You lived in Germany? - Ja. I came to America in 1939 along with most of the German scientists I knew. Our gift to my new country has been the bomb. I have some glue. You can stick your beautiful wife back together. By the time she is dry, you will know everything you need to know about nuclear physics. - He's in New York. - She's back in Washington. - You know what the whisper is? - What? - What's the whisper? - That Donald's got a mistress in New York. - Really? - Where did you hear that? An "intelligent" friend. Hello, Melinda. Don't let me interrupt. Go ahead, what were you saying? We were just...gossiping. I love gossip. What's the gossip? Something exciting? - This and that. - This and what? Let me in on it. I can see you're dying to tell. Go on. What's the matter? Mouth a bit dry? Lips dry too? Here, have a drink! Melinda. Lost none of your balls, I see. - It's easy when everyone around you's so... - British? - You still learning from the Brits? - They taught me nothing. And you know everything? I'm Head of Counter-Intelligence in the new agency - the CIA. Your own acronym. I'm impressed. Are you going to tell me what that limey did or do I need to impress you some more? No. - No to which question? - Both. See you later, James Jesus Angleton. (MELINDA) Darling? Where is he, upstairs? (BABY GURGLES) - How was the party? - You haven't told them, have you? You'll never tell them you want out. It's too important, Melinda. What I'm doing. More important than him growing up with a father who lies for a living? - That's not fair. - No. You're right. You're out there changing the world. I have to put up with a little humiliation because the future of mankind is at stake. Humiliation? They think you're in New York fucking another woman. Do you know how that feels? Do you know how unbelievably humiliating that is? - It's really hard, Melinda. I need you... - Hard for you. Hard for you! I so badly wanted to tell them - he's not fucking another woman, he's in New York fucking you all! Fucking the entire country, in fact! The irony is I threw a glass of wine in a diplomat's face to protect your honor! Our honor! Which no doubt makes all of them think they're right. You do have a mistress. I've given you the perfect cover. Why else would she be throwing wine about? America is being run by dangerous, paranoid maniacs. They have the bomb, they have the enemy and the power. It makes them capable of anything. I'm working for his safety, his freedom. But where is us in all of this? Where is our life? Where is our family? I want our life back. Just give me a little time. I don't believe you. I don't believe you'll get out. One of our planes operating a long-range detection system tracked a suspicious cloud over the Pacific. They got an air sample - it's radioactive. The radioactivity and the position of the cloud suggests one thing... Oh, my God. The USSR tested its first atomic bomb, probably the day before yesterday. Years early. Our intelligence was saying at least two years... I know what our intelligence was saying! - There must be a leak. - Atom bomb spies. I've had two-thirds of my stomach removed due to ulcers. I'm planning on keeping the rest of my stomach. - No more ulcers. - Find the leak. Plug it. (RADIO ) The President wants all Americans to know that we have evidence that recently an atomic explosion occurred in the USSR, "Remember this day" - "the day the USSR" tested its first atomic bomb, the day the world changed, the day the world got much colder... During the war, we found a KGB code book in Finland. Roosevelt made us send it back. - To our Soviet ally. - And we did, but we copied it first. By itself, the code book is useless... Cut the crap and give me the beef! The only copies of the pads they used to decipher this are in KGB HQ in Moscow. - If Moscow uses them only once... - Fuck the pads! Give me the damn beef! - We can read parts of their coded messages. - And what have we got? Sections of a scientific report written from inside the Manhattan Project. - Author? - We're working on it. Won't take long. Anything else? - Something sensitive. - It's all sensitive! Spit it out! What we've decoded seems to tell us that there's a mole inside the British Embassy. Seems to? Do you have a name? - Only his Soviet codename. - Homer. And one clue. Homer has family in New York. Family in New York? Then he must be an American employee. In the kitchen probably. - Somebody downstairs. - A cleaner? Or maybe a commis chef? Leave it to me. We'll root out Homer. Will you be looking upstairs as well as downstairs? Why should we do that? Upstairs is beyond reproach, Angleton. All that complacency and smugness. I can't stand it! "Upstairs is beyond reproach." I have some good news. We've confirmed who was leaking from inside the Manhattan Project. A German Jew called Klaus Fuchs. - Bloody hell! - Darling? - I don't know where the photograph is. - Photograph? What photograph? It's of you. I can't remember where we put it. Jesus Christ. What? You want my money? Why don't you just bloody say it? The money, mister. Hey, hey! Get outta here! He's under a lot of stress. There's a new baby and a new job. - Yes. - Yes. Melinda, if there was something else, it would be a good idea to tell me. Why do you think there might be something else? Well, how can I put it? Donald has a very solid, very reliable forehand, but he has another side to his game. A heavy slice on his backhand and lots of disguise on his lob. I'm sorry? Well, he has you - his wife - and he has a mistress. That's what people are saying. Have you...? I preferred not to ask. No, no. Quite. Too painful. I understand. - You're sending him home? - He needs it. Slapped wrists and a ticket home for being a violent lunatic? ! You can't do it! It's done. He's on his way home now. Unbelievable. The carpet in this office? Wall-to-wall. Only it isn't. There's a loose corner. Far side of the room - furthest from the door. You can lift it right up, sweep anything you choose under it. Knowing what to sweep under the carpet is the art of diplomacy. - How's the Homer investigation? - We're halfway through the waiting staff. - It's been weeks, for Christ's sake! - Methodical is best. Why not look from the top down at the same time as the bottom up? Traitors don't come from the top. Not in England. I'm all yours. My hush-hush days are over. You no longer work for MI5? They're princesses. Do you think they're going to ring up the "Daily Mail"? Are you tired, Charles? I'll take you up. - There, there. - Hello. - Terrific ears for a young chap. - Yes. So... Any skeletons, Anthony? Anything you wouldn't want the "Daily Mail" to know? No. You're fond of the princesses, particularly Margaret? Very. Pity about your married quarters going missing. - Ma'am? - Your downstairs arrangements. Ladies, so I'm told, are not permitted to show an interest in Anthony's Percy Pointer. Not even princesses. Any other vices you'll be prepared to lie to me about not having? I don't consider the modus operandi of my Percy a vice... I don't do Latin, Anthony. "Honi soit qui mal y pense" is as far as I go. Drink? Thank you. You didn't answer my question about vices. You rather swerved it. Um... I used to be quite keen on Marx. - Groucho? - The other one. - Harpo, the deaf one? - Karl, the bearded one. - Boils. - Lots, apparently. On his married quarters. No, on his bottom. Another country altogether. So... You're a homosexualist, a lapsed Marxist... And I'm related to you. You and me, Anthony. Two queens in a pod. You and I, ma'am. There's a married Group Captain sniffing about Margaret. Oh, dear. Poor Margaret's completely blinded by his twinkle. I know I can trust you to keep this to yourself. I would never betray a member of the family. Spotted dog. Or is it dick? Language changes so quickly, one can't keep track. Plates. Anyway, it's spotted. - Reminds me of school. - Reminds me of school. - Reminds me of school. - Reminds me of school! - Custard? - Oh, yes, please! Oh, my dog's on fire. Or is it my dick? - Talking of my dick... - It's Bird's custard. Alfred Bird, 1811 to 1878. His wife suffered from a terrible digestive disorder. She couldn't eat anything made with eggs or yeast, so no custard, but she loved custard so her husband experimented and came up with a new custard made with cornflour and milk. Bird's custard. People think of it as inferior, cheap, a substitute. It's not. It's made with love. I've got some news. It's not official yet, but I can tell you. The Philbys are going to Washington. Kim is replacing Donald. Pity you and Donald won't have time to catch up. Nor you and Melinda. - Delicious custard. - Bought or made? (KIM) You must stay with Donald, you know that? (MELINDA) I take it from you. I take everything you say and do it. It's a relief to be told what to do. Be strong. Help Donald and you'll be helping me. - You wouldn't use me, would you? - Use you? No. God, no. It's a relief to talk to someone who means what they say. I couldn't stand it if I didn't have that. That's the first time you've touched me. The question you asked - can you love two people at once? The answer's no. We'll be moving into your house in Washington. Mr. and Mrs. Philby in Mr. and Mrs. Maclean's house. And because the answer's no, I'm not going to try. I'm going to be Mrs. Maclean. The Americans are deeply unreliable. McCarthy and his witch-hunts, the FBI/CIA rivalry. Everyone's a Communist. We mustn't catch the disease. Paranoia's crippling. The Homer investigation. I want to do it properly. My way, our way. - I'll go over the waiters and cleaners. - Has to be the place to look. We have to keep our feet on the ground. Just because the Yanks are jumpy, doesn't mean we have to be. I'm glad you're here, Kim. Safe pair of hands. By the way, we've got a new man joining us. Bit of a cove, apparently. Guy Burgess? It's against the rules to have fellow agent in your house, Look, I'm going to be C. I'm going to be head of MI6, and Moscow will know everything in British Intelligence. I won't jeopardize it by letting Burgess run amok. He's going to live with me. End of story. It'll be fine. What can he do? - Mmm. - Guy lives in the spare room. - It's an arrangement that works well. - You didn't invite him tonight? - Separate lives. - (DOOR SLAMS) - Hello. - Hello, Guy. Care to join you? Yes, I fucking well will, actually. The wifely hand on the husband's arm. "Darling, get him under control or goodness knows what he might do." - Guy. - Kim. - Darling... - Darling, please, really. - Guy. - Kim. What happened, Burgess? I got beaten up by a keen theatregoer, Angleton. Why? In England, when one is having a piss at a urinal and eight urinals either side are unoccupied and a man comes in and doesn't piss seven urinals away or three urinals away, but stands right bloody next to you, it means something. But when he starts up a bit of a chat about new writing in the theatre, it means "Bugger me", frankly. But not here, it would seem. Apparently, in this appallingly friendly country, it means nothing of the kind. It means what it is - passing pleasantries in a public lavatory in the middle of the night. What happened? What happened? What happened? I asked him to say hello to Great Britain's answer to Enola Gay. - Do you know the story of Bird's custard? - We're going home! - James... - I'll be back for my car in the morning. I don't believe in drinking and driving. A little touch of Harry in the night. Does it feel like the night before Agincourt? - We've come a long way together. - 20 years. It still burns. Belief. In the belly. D'you think we'll be all right? You didn't answer my question. - Are we going to be all right? - The dominoes going... When one of us falls, he knocks the next one down. The second knocks the third man down and the third, the fourth. We stand or fall together. I think you could think about that, Guy. Guy? "The poor condemned English. "Like sacrifices by their watchful fires, "sit patiently and inly ruminate the morning's danger. "And their gestures sad, investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats, "Presenteth them under the gazing moon... "So many horrid ghosts." Lord Halifax, we're down to four and none are downstairs. Homer is upstairs. In the spirit of co-operation between our countries, we thought we'd help. Are you saying that Philby has been slow? What do you think this is? A game of chess? It's real life. Things happen because of people like Homer. People die. Freedom is threatened. It matters! Stiff upper lips and decorum and good manners can go hang! Down to four? Here's the list of names. I'd be grateful if you kept them to yourself. No one else should see it. (DOOR CLICKS) Gore-Booth. Jendrell... Neame. Maclean. They're down to four. Homer is one of four. Maclean is on the list. I see. What the hell are you going to do about it? What? The longer the inquiry goes on, the greater the chance of connecting you to Homer. - You are very valuable to us. - What are you saying? You could be about to become best-placed agent we have ever had. Having you as C would be more useful than anything in our history. If we need to make sacrifice to protect you, it should be made. - What are you saying? - Homer is burnt out. You're saying I should sacrifice Donald? If you help bring inquiry to conclusion, you and our cause would be better served. - Give Donald up. - Give Homer up. His name is Donald Maclean. I won't do this. I won't. You know I'm right. You might be angry but you know I'm right. He hasn't been Donald Maclean for years. He is Homer. And Homer is lost. Hello. - What do you think? - Is it safe? I haven't finished. It will be safe, I promise. - Penny for your thoughts, Kim. - My thoughts are more expensive than that. Homer. - What about it? - We were down to four. Now we're down to two: Paul Gore-Booth, Donald Maclean. They both have family in New York. They were both on the Embassy staff. The Russian for "Homer" is "Gomer". It's a near anagram of Gore. Will you excuse me? Nature calls. Philby's known Maclean for years. The British Intelligence Service works like a gentleman's club. They look after each other because they wear the same tie. Ties are everything. Philby's pointing us towards Gore-Booth. Philby doesn't know Gore-Booth. I think we've got our man. So... Middle of the night, a house call? What's the story? - There are two men who might be Homer. - Gore-Booth and Maclean. Both have family in New York. Both were in the right place at the right time. Yes. - Gore-Booth is short, dark, smart. - Yes. Donald Maclean is a tall, fair Scot with bohemian tastes. So? Some years ago, a KGB man called Walter Krivitsky tried to defect to the West. Murdered in a Washington hotel. Before he was murdered... he gave us a taste of what he could offer. He told us there was a spy in the Foreign Office. He didn't give a name, just a description. What was it? Short, dark, smart? A tall, fair Scot with bohemian tastes. - I know who Homer is. - Maclean. - How did you...? - Philby told me. The British beat you to it after all. - I've had concerns about Philby. - Well, that's the end of them. Kim Philby is on the side of the angels. The Devil was an angel. Don't tell me you're a sore loser, James? Philby got there first. He shopped Maclean. What kind of a traitor would shop another traitor? Close the door on the way out. I played tennis with him. Do it our way. I don't want the Americans all over this. - Private grief. - It's a huge shock to us all. I'll contact London. He was a friend of yours. - Yes, he was. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We're worried he won't go, leaving his son. And his wife. - Hard to leave happy family. - Are they happy? That's what I'm told. He needs an escort. Someone needs to go with him. Drink up, Now get in your car. You're going home, Guy. - How? - Bad behavior gets you sent home. Shouldn't be too hard for a man like you. White picket fences. (MUSIC: HANDEL'S "MESSIAH") God bless America. White picket fences, apple pie, Shirley Temple. The Ku Klux Klan, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, the CIA. White Sox, bobby socks, rednecks. God bless America. String up those niggers! Fry them Communists! God bless America! Land of the Free! (SIREN WAILS) - Burgess is being sent home. - Why? - He invented his own un-American activity. - I can imagine. - It was planned. - What do you mean? - Maclean needs escort. - To Southampton? To France? Philby's valuable, you are valuable. - We think we can keep you safe... - Moscow? - You want Guy to go too? - He doesn't know and he mustn't know. - He thinks he's going to France. - You want me to lie? - Reassure him. - Lie! - He's burnt-out case. - He's my best friend! Maclean gets the 5.19 from Charing Cross every night. The man in the hat and coat with the briefcase and the brolly. - I've always had my concerns. - I don't want a "told you so" speech now. - Let's put a tail on him. - We've had a directive from above. - What? - No tails at weekends. - It's a money problem. Saves on overtime. - What? - What? ! - We'll pick him up on Monday. He has no reason to suspect we're onto him. Let him come into the office as normal... then swoop. - You should get a coat. - I've got this one. Channel crossings can be chilly, and St Malo's a cold place. Nothing as cold as Cambridge, remember? Permanently the 19th February. I'd like to go back. There isn't time, Guy. No. One or two places as cold... - ..as Cambridge. - One or two. I'll buy you a coat. I'd like to. You should have a good coat. (HORN HONKS) - You all right, sir? - I'm fine. - You sure you're all right? - I'm fine, thank you. Winter? I think I saw Guy Burgess. Here in London. You know he's here? Why didn't you tell me? Christ! Why would he come back now? It's too much of a coincidence. He's been living with Kim Philby and Philby will know we're pulling Maclean in. Bloody hell! I think Maclean's going to go - make a run for it. - Can't find my copy of "Middlemarch". - Borrow mine. - I'll let you have it back as soon as... - When you can. I know. I know. (URGENT KNOCKING) (KNOCKING) (KNOCKING) The house could be bugged, We'll have supper, talk about nothing, - You and I will go out, drive to the pub. - I see. My name is Roger Stiles for the purposes of supper and the benefit of the bugs. - I'm an old school friend. - Do you think it'll hold? The swing? Looks like it. I should test it. Do you mind? Did you put the swing up yourself? Two lengths of rope, Roger, and a piece of wood. A couple of holes furnish this room for Kveta. I've been there. It's a very nice place. You could move in within two months. I am not moving out of here. - We have to help them, Fanda. - No, we don't. like my meal now. - Sorry. Enjoy. We just need to make About what? I'm staying here, in my apartment. Jara bought us this place. And he brought me the 30 thousand you were robbed of. Good, because if you hound me out of here, you'll be needing that money, dear. What... Who's driving you out? Where are you going? - I don't feel well. - What's wrong? How could you sell me like this? Mrs. Hanova... Fanda is dead. He's dead. He came here awfully upset, sat down and suddenly collapsed. He didn't regain consciousness. I don't believe it. Why didn't the doctor save him? Why didn't he help him, Mr. Stara? She's arrived by taxi carrying a black suit. By taxi. Now we're screwed. Look, a funeral van. Go on ahead, Mom. Watch your step. I'm sorry. He fainted. He went dead white and stopped breathing. Don't cry, everything will be all right! You said the doctor couldn't help him. I thought I called the ambulance... So was the doctor here or wasn't he? No. Ed wanted to help me. So that you'd realize what you'd lose in him. And he sort of overdid it a bit. The taxi cost 500, the coffin 3000! The fright nearly cost me my life! You put him up to it! You criminal! You liar! You heartless brute! This way... I can't go on. I refuse to live with him. - So what's with the coffin? - Take it away. - That'll cost you. - We'll settle it right now. Hello Dad, hello Ed. Dad! Move in with me, nobody'll bother you and you can do as you like. Emilie Hanova and Frantisek Hana. Applicant, please clarify your petition for a divorce. I made my statement in writing and have nothing to add. How long have you been together? For 44 years. A long time. You went through a lot together. Good things and bad. Is your marriage now so seriously impaired - That it cannot be saved? - Yes. Does the applicant's lawyer have any questions? Did your husband often spend his whole pension without contributing to the household? Do you know what he spent the money on? - Different things. - Give us some examples. I asked him to visit his father's grave and he returned a week later from some spa. He lost his month's pension and 4000 crowns at the Casino. But he didn't go there to gamble, he heard about the sightseeing flights and he always had longed to see the world from a bird's-eye view. But there was fog, he had to wait for good weather and he gambled the money away out of boredom. And he spent your savings in expensive restaurants. He had a poor childhood. During the depression his father split matches in half to save money and as a boy he served beers in a gadren pub. He wanted to see what it's like to be rich. Did you tolerate his behavior? No, but when I was mad he brought me flowers and I always forgave him. - Any more questions? - That will be all. As the respondent, do you have anything to say? It's true, the applicant always forgave me but I didn't appreciate it. You may sit down. For the records... - Well? How's it going? - Badly. Witness Jaroslav Hana. Just as an example. Once mother persuaded him to look after his grandchildren for a while. He took my two little girls to a cafe by taxi. To a smoky cafe... He ordered champagne, they all got tipsy and he forgot them on the subway. But Dad's a very kind man. He's fun and he's generous, but... Incompetent. Being so irresponsible, he's just not fit for marriage. Life with him really is sheer martyrdom. It's very hard for me to have to say this. Mother thought he'd grow wise with age but this last thing was a very cruel trick and mother realized she couldn't stand more. Can you describe this cruel trick? He put his friend up to it... Ed... Mr. Stara told mother that Dad had died at his place. - Do you wish to speak? - Yes. Out with it, Mom. It was a terrible thing to do, devastating. Although I admit I went against him when our son wanted our flat for his ex-wife and kids. and arranged to move us to an old folks' home. He refused, and for my effort to help our son he punished me so cruelly. Me, who always forgave him for all his crazy ideas. Because I admired him for being so different. I'm a stick-in-the-mud sort of person, studying maps. He means to fly round the world in a balloon, and he refuses to admit that our paths don't really lead anywhere anymore. It's intolerable. The older he gets, the crazier he is. He doesn't go to funerals, he makes fun of death, he makes paper darts out of death announcements. I don't know if he wants to be buried or cremated! He doesn't know the price of bread, but follows the dollar exchange rate. When the dollar dropped he bought me 8000 crowns worth for Xmas. He throws money around and saves money - by stealing our neighbor's newspaper. He always returns it in time but I'm on tenterhooks he'll be caught at it. When we took the train to his dad's grave he didn't buy any tickets. The inspector caught us but Fanda proudly paid the fine and left him a tip! The inspector burst into tears. And when I scold him he says I'm right and just goes on doing it. I've been listening carefully. I feel that in your own way you still love your husband despite his shortcomings. Let me ask you again. Are you fully convinced of your incompatibility? Please tell me, with your whole heart and conscience. Do you insist on a divorce? No. Even though I know I'm going to regret it. You heard the applicant's decision. Do you wish to say anything? I want to state that I love my wife and that I'll mend my ways. Thank you. - Nice, isn't it? - Yes. Nice. Jara'll hew off THE VANOUS FAMILY and put up THE HANA FAMILY in gold We'll have our photos taken. I want them on the gravestone. - Isn't it beautiful? - It's very nice here. Don't smoke here, Fanda. It's not fitting... I don't want to harp at you, but... No, that's all right. Done. No, I'd be so glad if you stopped smoking. All right. If you mind that much. It's not because of me. Smoking causes cancer. ... say the health warnings. Exactly. Please bring up some water. The tap's back there by the morgue. Right behind you. Here we'll keep what you save by not smoking. Have you finished all the crosswords again? The storekeeper said they're difficult. Some are, some aren't. Mr. Stara, please leave Fanda alone. No. He does not want to talk to you. Why? What a question! He was nearly divorced because of you! You're going to the hospital? Yes. I'll tell him. Goodbye. That was Ed. He says he's going to the hospital. Which one? He didn't say. Who knows if it's true. He has high blood pressure and his kidney's failing. You should try for a crossword puzzle prize. The storekeeper won a book and 1500 crowns once. - Shall I wash the dishes? - After dinner. Now grind the poppy seeds and take your vitamins. Isn't it wonderful being together like this, - With you helping me. - Yes. Wonderful. Marie from Brod has died! Which Marie? My dad's step-brother's son's wife. I didn't know her. Look how cheap-Iooking the announcement is. - I don't care. - About anything, I know. Luckily it won't be up to you. Here's everything ready for when I die. My death announcement, the undertaker's phone number, my coffin clothes, the addresses where to send the announcements. The funeral music, flowers, even your announcement. So check it to see if you like it. Hello, I'm Mr. Stara's neighbor. - Yes? - Can I speak to Mr. Hana? - Come in. - Thanks. Come on, Bobby! I couldn't find you, pal. Sure... - Got a cigarette? - Don't play the fool. I thought you were paralyzed. Only my right arm and right leg. Not bad here, is it? Fine. That one kicked it. That one's been moved to a loony-bin. He kept walking naked into the nurses' room demanding erotic massages. So how are you doing? I'm training for the wheelchair races. But the damn thing keeps swerving to the left. You'll have to go see the mansion on your own. No, I'll wait for you. Such a beautiful mansion, a really nice place to live. So let's buy it. They might give us a discount. My savings book is in that drawer. Take it. Good idea, we'll borrow the rest. I hope it's enough for my funeral. To hell with that. I'm giving up, Fanda. Should we never meet again, it's been wonderful, it's been just enough. Stop it, stupid. Listen to this, there's a young nurse here who... but you must light up for this story. I don't smoke any more. It's gone too fast. I meant to visit Dad's birthplace. - I'll take you there. - Take me back to bed. Life isn't worth a light and it won't get better. You mustn't give up. Your dog's waiting. God! I can't even take a piss on my own! Hello, Mr. Hana. Will you wait outside for me, Dad? I wanted to say goodbye but you were out. I'm moving to my mother's in Kolin. Cologne? Not that far. Thanks for everything. It's pure hell at home. I don't sleep at all. Don't mention it today. - Hello Dad. - Grandpa! We've got visitors! Which one are you? Karolina? - No, Marketa! - We're going to move here. Be quiet, girls! Sorry, Dad. The two women keep gassing about it in front of them. I'm not angry. I'll have to check out the home for senior citizens. - You don't want to go, do you? - Yes I do. You look like you're going to your execution. the train's here. Listen, I don't want you forced into this. I'd like to see it. If we're moving there. You said you would never move. The situation was different then. Come, let's go home. We missed the train anyway. I've lost a shoe! Here... hold me up... Your coffee. Thanks. You fell asleep again. - No. - Yes! It's getting worse! You snore away all day or sit hunched up by the window like that poor man downstairs. You don't talk, don't smoke, don't drink, don't sing, don't quarrel. I can't stand it any more! - I wanted to please you. - Please me? What happened to you? I married a cheerful man with crazy ideas, with whom I laughed and argued all day and nowadays you sit here like a living corpse, like some dope who doesn't care that I'm unhappy. That I can't live like this! And I won't! Mr. Stara... Forgive me for bothering you, I need your advice. It's about Fanda. He's unhappy. He's terribly unhappy, and I don't know what to do. - Where are you going? - We're are going on a trip. - Where to? - To buy a mansion. Go and get ready. Wait. It's not that simple. It's all arranged. Ed gave me instructions. Who did you say you are? The wife of an emeritus member of the New York Met who is returning to his native country. Is the agent going too? The owner's representative will be at the mansion. What did Ed say? How is he? Poor man, he's going into a geriatric unit. I said we'd come and tell him how it went. I'll get it. I understand. How can you say I'm not supportive? But the situation has changed. You have everything, Jara. Money, a job, your youth - and you have time. We don't have any time. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. No, it's you who complicated things, dear. You shouldn't have gone after all those women. That's all. 'Bye. Hurry up! He's not there! He sat there dead for Come on, then. Look, the trees are blooming! I feel good. Aren't you well? I'm scared to death. Don't worry, you only feel that way the first time. Let's hope I make it through this. - Turn around and drive back. - Yes, sir. Very shabby. I'm not taking it. What? What's happening? Nothing. The place is too small and neglected. I don't think you'd like it here. -So how you been doing, man? -You know, for the most part, I'm fine. " For the most part." Which I'm gonna interpret as meaning though you're not down now, you have something on your mind. So why don't you just tell me what's on your mind? Nothing, really. Which, to tell you the truth, is kind of the problem. I can't figure out what the hell to do with myself. -You're not going back to USC, huh? -No. And that I know is the right decision. But, unfortunately, that's about all I know. Come on. You've gotta cut yourself a little break here. Life did just throw you one hell of a curve ball. All you really need is time. Before you know it, you'll be full of confidence, up to your old tricks. -And you have come to the right place. -Oh, yeah? Yeah. You're talking to the king of directionless. That's what I was doing with those years of high school folly. I was perfecting the life without purpose. Last year you could've gotten away with that burst of self-deprecation... -...but this year, you seem fairly driven. -Yeah, I know. lt's terrible, isn't it? But what can I say? I love the kitchen life. I even love the crass kitchen attitude. -Sandwich? -Sure. But, inevitably along with the crass kitchen attitude comes the grillside drama. Yeah. lt all started with me trying to help this girl out of her very self-destructive relationship. But then you throw in a little dash of my very poorly thought-out attraction to her and her absolute lack of attraction to me and you get where l'm coming from. Oh, that sucks. Wanna talk about it? No. To tell you the truth, it's really not all that interesting. And it's nothing you should be troubling yourself with given everything that's been on your mind lately. Well for what it's worth, the Pacey I know would figure out a way to help the girl, no matter what the drama. is that so? Without a doubt. Okay. Joey, it's time for a study break. I've been nodding off on the same sentence to the point of drool. -lt's just-- lt's not pretty. -Well, you don't have to ask me twice. Sweet. So where's Jack? Deep in the land of Frat. Did he tell you about this Winter Formal thing? Yeah, that actually sounds vaguely familiar to me. But to be quite honest, all the Greek speak sounds like.... Well, Greek to me. I get it. He wouldn't ask you to the caveman hoopla so I get stuck with the surrogate date duties. I feel for you. I do. Watching Jack pretend to be one with the thick-necked brotherhood. Come on. lt can't be that bad. I'm sure Grams has some prescription medication somewhere that would help you a lot through this, Joey. Thanks, but I think I'll manage. Hey, Jen.... Speaking of the men in our lives how's Dawson these days? You're asking me? Well, it's- - You know I haven't seen him for a while, and I know that you two hang out and I guess I just needed to know that he's doing all right. He's better. He.... He's been seeing a shrink, which I think is really good for him, you know? He's gonna be fine. That's exactly what I needed to hear. It's been.... lt's been kind of hard getting used to not being the one to see him through this, you know? And I think I'm finally okay with it which is hard to admit without feeling like a total jerk. Oh, stop it, Joey. You're not a jerk. I've been meaning to tell you that I can't think of a better person to be there for him right now than you. I'm really glad that you're there for him. Thank you. All right, simmer down, ladies. No offence, Jack. We got a lot to do for tonight's formal and little time after this meeting. So let's get to it. A, this is our biggest event before the break. B, it must be perfect. And C everybody must get laid. You should all be hooked up with a date by now. But for those of you chumps without one... -...meet the list. -Yes, the list! In the spirit of house love, I need names, people. Decent-looking honeys... -...ready to put out. -What about Debbie? -What about Suzanne? -Alison! Alison! No, no. What about those fine-ass Worthington chicks? Come on, dog. We know you got some hottie friends. And we know you're not looking to score with them. -Jacky! -Talk! Talk! Come on, please, talk! All right, all right, all right. I may know a girl that meets the specified requirements. Hey, I got dibs on whatever this guy's got, okay? I've seen these quality chicks McPhee hangs with. So our main man Eric's got himself a date. Okay, I am aware how absurd what I'm about to say is gonna sound but I'm also aware of how miserable your love life makes you and I can't sit and watch you hurt especially when I know I can do something. I'm here to ask you out. -l can't go on a date with you, Pacey. -Okay, that's fine. Then you don't have to think of it as a date. Think of it as an opportunity to compare and contrast. A free trial run at a life without heartache. -Pacey, you know I can't. -Actually, I know that you can. You need a break from your relationship. I need a break from your relationship. I'm promising to leave the kinky underwear at home I might even stop by CVS and steal a bottle of cologne. What do you say? Do I have any reason to feel hope? You have my word. I will keep this whole thing completely platonic. Fine. A friendly outing on the town, nothing more. Excellent. You rock. So pick you up around 7? Seven. This is your friend Pacey you're talking about? Yeah, but it's not just him, it's all my friends. lt's like they.... l don't know. lt's been two months and everybody's still.... They're holding things back from me. Like they're trying to protect me. You know, I mean, they look at me like this- - As this fragile, breakable thing instead of just Dawson, the person. And I know they mean well, it's just it makes it virtually impossible to move on. -Have you mentioned this to them? -Yeah. Well-- No, actually. No, I haven't mentioned it to them. What about the film festival you told me about? Isn't that coming up? It's this weekend. Are you going? Hadn't planned on it, no. It might be good to take life on the road for a little while. Help clear your mind. You could even take one of those friends you feel so estranged from. Come on. There must be someone you can take. Well, this little ditty goes out to all you brave souls out there surviving a heartbreak. Trust me, better things will come. -Hello! -Hey! Oh, and don't worry. That sleazebag formerly known as our boyfriend Charlie is not here today. -That's a good thing. -Yeah, that's always a good thing. But you know what? Even if he were here, it wouldn't really matter to me. -Really? -Yep. I think that time has finally done its healing thing. -Hey, what's up? -Nothing. I just wish I had your self-control. I mean, I know I should be puking at the mention of Charlie's name but I find myself daydreaming about him. His latest attempt to woo us back with that whole " l've changed" pitch. Which " l've changed" pitch? All those corny love letters he keeps sending. Doesn't it seem, sometimes, in that moment when you crawl in bed alone like, " Hey, maybe he really did change"? Gosh. I don't know which love letters you mean. -Hasn't he been sending you letters? -No. He's trying to woo you back, huh? That's-- Jen, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? No, no, no! Please don't apologize. I swear, it's fine. I was just saying to you that it doesn't matter to me. I want corny love letters. I just don't understand why he chose her and not me. -ls there something wrong with me? -Jen, there's nothing wrong with you. It's just.... All this time, I thought he was cheating on us on equal ground, you know? But, no, she got to be the girlfriend and I was just the floozy. Floozy? -Yeah? -You said "floozy"? -lt's what I am. I'm a floozy. -Oh, Jen. This is supposed to be the other way around. -l'm supposed to be consoling you. -No, please. It's the least I can do, and believe it or not, it's helping me a lot. I just don't wanna be here. The thought of running into either of them makes me wanna puke. Okay, so let's get out of here, then. This weekend. Well, I'm game. Where do you wanna go? You ever been to Hooksett, New Hampshire? No. Can I tell you something? I am so psyched to be going to this formal. I was so excited when Jack called. Granted, last-minute arrangements can be annoying and blind dates can be as dangerous as gator wrestling- - Joey you're hogging the mirror. -Freak. -Oh, God! Hello, hideous! Do I even like any of my clothes? Audrey, you look great. Besides, I don't know what the big deal is. As much as I wanna give Jack credit I'm sure it's just frat debauchery masquerading as an event. Okay, killjoy. First off, Jack said this Eric guy is hella cute which, right off, sounds interesting to me. And for someone as progressive as you it's amazing how close-minded you are about frats. The words " progressive" and "frat" do not belong in the same sentence. What about this one? Joey, we're going on a double date. -A little cheer, please. -Okay, okay. Well, if nothing else, at least I'll have a good time with Jack, right? Wait, wait, wait! Okay. -Hey. -Hey, handsome! -Wow, Joey, you look beautiful! -Thank you. -Audrey! How you doing? -Hi! I'm great! Good. Good. Eric, this is Joey. -Hey. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -And this is Audrey. -Hi. -Hi. -Jack was right. You're a stone fox. Thank you. You know, I guess you'll have to do. -Well, let's go, shall we? -Yeah. Yeah, let's go. -Can I help you yet? -Yeah, I'm Dawson Leery checking in for the film festival. Oh, my God. You're totally wicked cute. Way cuter than the picture. There's a picture? is this your girlfriend? Oh, cool! Your movie's awesome! Your screening sold out. You beat Oliver, you know. -He's the biggest thing around here. -l'm sorry. Who's Oliver? He's our local celebrity. I don't see what the big deal is, though. -Ask me, he looks kind of retarded. -He's, like, eccentric, Trevor. God! Okay, let me make this clear. It is more than an option... -...to go back home right now. -Oh, I don't think so. Granted, the people of this town are a little off but who can deny that we could both use the love? And what better way to spend an evening than as girlfriend to the biggest celebrity in town? -Gee, honey, you shouldn't have. -Well.... -Wow, you guys really went all out! -Sigma Ep. Expect nothing less. Way to deliver, man! Score, big daddy, score! -What was that? -Nothing. The guys just being idiots. -Take your coats, ladies? -Okay. Jen should be sharing this pain. I should call her. No can do, she's gone for the weekend with Dawson. That was great, thanks. Just the check, please. So? -What? -Oh, come on. Was this good or was this good? Give me a little of credit. -l saw your face when we came in. -l did not have a face! You had a face. But let's get back to giving me credit, shall we? You may also have noticed that I have kept us in crowded places because I wouldn't want you tempted to jump me on our non-date evening. Well, I mean, you are wearing that really sexy outfit. Damn! Who would have thought you cleaned up so good? And you're right. A lesser guy would have not afforded my self-control such a generous security blanket. You saved me from myself. Well, it hasn't been easy, let me tell you. I know you don't like hearing this, Karen but you deserve better than being an illicit affair. A woman who is as giving and as beautiful as yourself deserves someone who's gonna be there loving you back just as hard. -Okay, that was good. -Yeah, that was really good. Which just kind of puts the final nail in the coffin. -What nail? What coffin? -How did I get top prize? Either my dad donated a wing to the Hooksett library or these people have no idea what's good and what's bad. -Okay, you- - This has gotta stop. -What's gotta stop? This. The people of this town are perfectly nice. And you blaming them for bad taste is obviously just a way to undermine your own artistic abilities. You have a tremendous talent so would you please stop putting yourself down? Or I'll have to break up with you. You can't break up with me. You'll never break up with me. The physical attraction is far too strong. You got me there, tiger. -Hey, Leery! -Hey. Your movie better be good. This festival consistently gives first prize to a film with a fresh voice and unique vision. I've won it three years in a row. And I just don't like the idea of being usurped by a Hollywood slickster, you know? It's just not cool. Hi. You're really pretty. Who's gonna argue? -No after-dinner cigarette? -No cigarette. I only smoke when I'm nervous or severely annoyed. So then not nervous or severely annoyed. I guess I should take that as a good sign. In fact, I don't think I saw you yell or complain all night long. It's amazing what being out of Civilization does for a girl. If I didn't know you better, I would say that you positively light up. Now, don't go ruin the moment with unnecessary compliments. And why not? Enough of the cynicism. I say that we ruin this night silly with unnecessary flattery. Karen Torres, you are a beautiful young woman with fantastic taste in clothing. And although your jokes do tend to bomb you make up for it with that sparkling smile of yours. Okay, now it's your turn. I had a great time tonight, Pacey. -Yeah, I'll take that. -Thank you. You know, just seeing you have a good time is thanks enough. Anyway.... Good night, Karen. The first time I saw this film I knew I was in the hands of a talented filmmaker. But I was equally moved by a letter which accompanied the film's submission. It was a letter from the filmmaker's father telling me that I absolutely could not ignore his son's work. Honestly, I was predisposed to hate the film because, well it didn't show up until three days past the deadline. But I'm a father myself and I know a thing or two about parental pride. So I grudgingly put the video in the VCR and after five minutes, I knew Mitch Leery was right. I absolutely could not ignore his son's work. So, ladies and gentlemen I give you the filmmaker behind this year's top prize film: Dawson Leery. I don't know what to say. My dad loved movies. He loved them in the truest sense in that he had no interest in making them, he just.... He loved watching them. He started taking me to movies at a very early age and I loved it. He would take me to movies and then.... And then talk to me about them. I need to know how you learned that I am the one the Lord Chamberlain hired to dispose of the witness. I don't betray friends to murderers like you. That's what I was hoping you would say. STORM: Why do you Starjammers treat me as an enemy? Did we not fight side-by-side against the tyrant D'Ken? True. Though we have maintained communications silence, Corsair's open communicator allowed us to hear everything. Including Cyclops-son betraying Corsair-father to evil Commander! X-Men the ones who act like enemy, not Starjammers! JANDRA: I am glad you are back. But why is the lady tied up? Her friend betrayed our location to the false Shi'ar officer. On the other hand, from the lies Cyclops was told, it is no more than we expected. (BUZZING) (BUZZING STOPS) Is it true you are Corsair's son? Not by choice! Watch and learn. What are you going to see is the ship's log for three days in the future. But that's impossible. 1821 hours. Encountered magnetic storm of force 10 intensity. Life support temporarily failed. Six crew injured. The witness, Jandra, lost. This faked sequence was programed in advance to cover up what was really going to be a murder! Exactly. I went to your father for help, because he was the one man I knew with the guts to rescue Jandra and see that justice was done. Until I ruined it. My mistake could cost all of you your lives. We'll see. For now, just try to have a little faith in your father. - I gave orders that I wasn't to be... - Disturbed? That's the Scott Summers I gave my last parachute to! Took you long enough! Plan the family picnic later. Let's go! Follow me! CH'OD: Corsair, sorry to break communications silence, but I strongly suggest you alter your course 13 degrees to the north. Fools! We have them now. CH'OD: And remember Aldebaran 5. I remember it well. S TORM: Professor Xavier sends his regards. Xavier is half-a-planet away, and Aldebaran is in another galaxy. What are they up to? (CHEERING) I don't know what happened on Aldebaran 5, but it better have been good. It was. (CORSAIR MOANS IN PAIN) Now! Fire! (LAUGHING) You'll have to forgive Ch'od. He gets carried away. That's okay, Dad. I think I understand how he's feeling. Get up here, everyone! We have a trial to get to! And a renegade cop to turn over to Shi'ar justice. CORSAIR: What made you change your mind? Let's just say I like long odds. Seems to run in the family. Our talk got interrupted. There's so much I want to know. We'll get to it. All of it. I've got a question or two myself. - Then stay! - What? I don't mean forever. Just a few hours. You're not telling me your hot spacecraft can't make up a few hours flying across a whole galaxy! Well, I... I guess we could spend a little extra time in hyperdrive. No. Break out the cards! Better save your fuel. Looks like we're going to be here a while. So, you're gonna marry that redhead that beat the pants off of the Imperial Guard. C YCLOPS: She's calmed down a bit since then. - Reminds me a lot of your mother. - C YCLOPS: How? CORSAIR: Maybe I should wait to tell you till after you're married. NARRATOR: Previously on X-Men... SHAW: You X-Men were allowed to enter, so that I could have the pleasure of introducing you to the Inner Circle's newest member. WYNGARDE: To our new queen! - Our new queen! - ALL: Our new queen! Jean! We can't deceive and control the Phoenix forever. Some day she'll discover the truth, and turn against the Inner Circle. PHOENIX: Your pathetic attempt to use me has opened my eyes! No! Please! You had me do evil to gain you power. But through this body, I felt the thrill of that evil. Now I thirst for more! Jean, it's you. Talk to me! Help me! PHOENIX: For this new sensation, the rapture of destruction, for the pleasure of the Phoenix! The unbound joy of evil! The mortal Jean Grey is no more. I am fire made flesh! Power incarnate! I am the Dark Phoenix! - Do not do it. - Oh, dear. (SHRIEKING) You wish me to return to the cold nothingness of space? You wish me to give up the body? Never! There is a power beyond good and evil, the power to create and the power to destroy. Jean, can you hear me? Jean Grey can hear nothing. Speak only to the Phoenix. Jean, fight it! Use the powers of your mind. Remember what we mean to each other. Jean, please, don't leave me. Scott? Scott, help me. Enough! You are of no use to me. (ALL SCREAMING) WOLVERINE: Ducks. I hate ducks. Gambit can't help but notice you save him, chere, and not Wolverine. Must be my way with women. Don't flatter yourself, swamp-boy. (GAMBIT GRUNTS) Little piece of advice, Cajun. Never make that woman mad at you. Speaking of mood swings, what's bugging the Phoenix? She used to be on our side. I fear Xavier's intuition has proved prescient. Through Jean's keen human senses, the Phoenix has experienced exhilarating new sensations and emotions. - I doubt she wants to give them up. - Why not ask her? WOLVERINE: Better ask her real nice. Your destiny is at its end, X-Men. The Dark Phoenix has come to destroy you all! Defend yourselves. But remember, Jean is up there with her. - Be careful. - I call upon the power of the hurricane! (ALL GRUNTING) Hang on, sugar. (PHOENIX LAUGHING) Do you really think your puny powers mean anything to me? Forgive me, Jean. This is too easy. You provide me only annoyance, frustration. The power of lightning! Why does the body excite when I must struggle to get at them? (STORM SCREAMS) Get away from her, you witch! What in the world? Uh-oh! (WOLVERINE GRUNTS) Why does the sensation lessen when the opponent is weak? Cyclops, now! - No! - ROGUE: Beast! Fools! Do you think I need eyes to see, ears to hear? Shouldn't have done that, gal. Let's see how cocky you are once I've drained off some of your power. Stop it! (ROGUE SCREAMS) Is this all you can do against me? This is too easy. Give her back! Why do you care about this body? I love her. Love? I do not understand. Your answer is unacceptable. (GRUNTS) Scott? What have I done? I love you, Scott. No matter what the future holds, I will always love you. Never forget. (ALL GROANING) Jeannie. Life readings, Eluke? As if I didn't already know. Nothing, Captain. The D'Bari star system is as devoid of life as the others. It seems such a waste. An entire universe out there, waiting to be discovered, and we're asked to map dead star systems. Who knows? Maybe one day we shall find something. (SCANNER BEEPING) What is it? What's happening? I don't know. (ALARM BLARING) Eluke! What was that? A comet? No. It is alive! It just plunged into the sun. Surely it cannot have survived. According to my readings, Captain, the creature is still alive. - Not only alive, but feeding! - Feeding? On a star? Engine room! Full forward, now! All engines stop! Why are we stopping? Get us out of here! No. That thing, whatever it is, just destroyed an entire star system. If those planets had been inhabited, billions of innocent beings would have been wiped out. We must destroy that creature before it feeds again. - Eluke, where is the creature now? - Gone. - Just gone! - Connect me with the Empress. LILANDRA: No, do not pursue, return to me now. - Gladiator. - Yes, my Empress! Assemble the Imperial Guard immediately and make ready the Imperial Star Cruiser! - What has happened, my Empress? - Our worst nightmare. I'm afraid Jean Grey no longer exists. When she first inhabited Jean's body, we were thankful. Jean helped her protect us from the M'Kraan Crystal. But now Jean has been overwhelmed by the alien force within her. As long as Jean is alive, we can't stop trying. Of course, Scott, but we must also be honest with ourselves about the depth of the problem. Unless the Phoenix agrees to leave Jean's body, I see no way to save our friend. (GROANS IN PAIN) Professor, she's coming back. She's coming back. How do you know the Phoenix is returning? Jean is returning. Our psychic rapport is still functioning. We will do everything in our power to protect Jean. But at the same time we must do all we can to defeat the Phoenix within her or our world will not survive. How do you beat something that can melt you in a split second? - That's it! - What's it? - Why hasn't the Phoenix melted us? - How should I know? Because Jean has at least some control over the creature. That means there's still hope of reaching her. Ah, yes, its mind. The Inner Circle controlled the Phoenix-Jean entity, at least for a time, by attacking its most vulnerable spot. But, Beast, it's Jean's mind! I do not propose to harm her mind, only disable it. A mnemonic scrambling device would temporarily prevent her from forming coherent thought. That could cause the creature to leave her! My thoughts, exactly. How could I have not seen it? All those weeks we worked to make Jean whole again, simply made her the perfect host. Phoenix, why do you still inhabit Jean's body? Your work is done. You do her harm by remaining! (PHOENIX LAUGHING MANIACALLY) One mnemonic scrambler, made-to-order. Now, to find a suitable test subject. Volunteers? (GROANS IN PAIN) - What is it? - It's Jean. - I feel her presence. - Where? Here? No, somewhere near. A place from her past. A place full of emotional memories. Mom, Dad, I'm home. Mom? Dad? Mom? Are you here? Prometheus! (HISSING) Prometheus, it's me. Jean. (SQUEAKING) Daddy? Daddy's home! Daddy? Is that you? Daddy? Where are you going? Daddy? Forgive me, chere, this is the only way. Fools! ROGUE: Why ain't that brain buster working? Patience, Rogue. It should take effect momentarily. Jean, my friend! Do not reject our help. - Let your mind... - I have no friends! What is this, "catch the X-Men" day? Her mind is more powerful than anything I could imagine. She has overloaded the scrambler's circuitry. We knew it could come to this. - We got to end it. - Logan? - Jean? - Do it. Quickly, while I still have control. Stop her now! I can't! Please, if you truly love me, don't let her... You should have destroyed me when you had the chance. What a pity, Beast. I've ruined your little toy. Now we'll play on my terms! C YCLOPS: Let them go. Jean. Jean Grey no longer exists! I know you're there, Jean. I can still feel you. You cannot destroy your friends. Don't be so sure! I love you, Jean. We all love you. And you love us. You love me. Nothing will ever change that. Scott? Scott, I... (JEAN SCREAMS) C YCLOPS: Jean! I'm sorry, Scott. But I had to attack her mind while she was distracted. As long as I've got her back, safe and... I only stunned her. The creature inside her must be destroyed now. Quickly. - No. - Now. Before she... Recovers? You're too late. And as for you, (XAVIER SCREAMS) You once told Jean Grey that the greatest joy a teacher has is to be surpassed by his own pupil. - Enjoy! - JEAN: Stop! I won't allow you to enter my... (JEAN SCREAMING) In the battlefield of the mind, my will shall prevail! Do you really think your puny mind is a match for mine? As you once used the power of the Phoenix to bind the M'Kraan Crystal, I now bind the Phoenix with the power of... (XAVIER SCREAMING) The conceit of you humans, the arrogance! Jean. If you can hear me, help me. Help me. Help me. This can't be. I am Phoenix! I now bind the Phoenix - with the power of my mind! - No! No! (XAVIER GROANS) (JEAN GROANS) - Professor! - C YCLOPS: Jean! - Professor, will she be all right? - Jeannie. The Phoenix is contained, for now. I could never have defeated the Phoenix if Jean herself had not helped me. The strength of her mind is truly awesome. - Hi, four-eyes. - Hi yourself, tiger. ROGUE: We got company. C YCLOPS: The Shi'ar. Greetings, Charles. Lilandra! What is the matter? Why didn't you alert me telepathically? Charles Xavier, it is the decision of the High Council of the Shi'ar Empire that the being known both as the Phoenix and as Jean Grey, must be destroyed! Lilandra, stop this! For the sake of all that live, Jean Grey must perish. Let's go. I never realized these underground passages were here. Yeah. Hey is it true... Is it true there's treasure here? I heard it from the former warden, so it has to be true. There's a spectacular treasure hidden here. Hey, is this it? Definitely. Do it. Yeah. What the... It's human! L-It can't be! What's going on? T-There's no treasure? It's still alive! What the hell are you? Who am I? Who in the world am I? K-Kill me... Please, kill me! Even if you are a criminal, we must respect your life. What are you? What the hell are you, anyway? My name is Michael... The one who keeps law and order. From this border on, this is Jesus Town. Please, present entrance permission visa. I repeat. Please, present entrance permission visa. Hey, stop! Come back here! It's tonight. Wait at the rendezvous point. Let's go. An unknown intruder has broken through the main gate. An unknown intruder has broken through the main gate. Hey, time to move. Go! Go! Warning. Do not move. You are now under our jurisdiction. Repeat. Warning. Do not move. If you do not obey... Can you hear it? The sound of the people's joy. Today we celebrate the third anniversary of Jesus Town. People call Jesus Town a place of miracles. Here there is love and peace above what has ever been achieved before. There is still poverty and confusion everywhere beyond this place. We are actually living in a modern Eden. Is anything wrong? I am moved. Look... This orchid was dying until yesterday, but today it is fully blooming. Even a tiny flower like this has a life. Reporting, Sir. Someone has broken the border gate and invaded Jesus Town. I have no choice. Call in the heavy soldiers. I want to protect everyone in Jesus Town. That includes the smallest life. You are justice and I am the servant of justice. That dream again. Hey, Kaoru! You okay? Kaoru! Hey! Let's go! What are you doing? What are you doing? Let's go! Get ready! Hurry! Hurry! Come on! All right, run! H-Help! Hurry! That way! This way! Not good. Parliament's heavy soldiers! What are we going to do, Kaoru? Run! Run! What is that? That's... Y-You bastard, do you have any idea what you're doing? Do you have any idea? Do you understand? P-Please, spare me! I was just following orders! If you don't have a will of your own, there is no reason for you to live. Transmitting images of intruder. T-That's Hakaider. Hurry! Die! Kaoru! Master Michael! Why didn't you die? If you truly deserve to be one of my men you would have fought and died. You shouldn't move yet. Relax, we're all friends trying to rebel against the government. This hideout isn't going to be found easily. Want some food? A robot doesn't need any food. Whoever heard of a robot that eats bread or soup? Hey, don't tell me it's love at first sight! You sleazy robot. Say, would you do us a favor? We need your help. Our country is controlled by Parliament right now. We have to destroy it! He's a weird robot. Maybe a nutcase. However you look at it, it's not human. We can't let it stay here. Yeah! I ain't trusting no robot. What if he breaks down and goes out of control? Shut up! I know. Hey, you came to save this country, didn't you? Then fight with us! We have to get Gurjev of Parliament! He talks of sweet things like love and peace, but what he's really doing is... Please, help! Please, stop! Get moving. Quit messing around! Anyone who shows the possibility of disobeying Gurjev will be caught. Stop, please! Kill me! No! No! No! And they insert a chip into the brain to erase all human emotions. Tears, laughter, and anger... To Gurjev, emotions only get in the way. Look. Now he will be reborn. In this country, no crime is allowed to occur. Any criminal... Any disobedient civilian will be given a new life by me. Beautiful. Just like children. I am their father. I must protect them with my own hands. From any threat. Such as Hakaider. Do you know that thing? The true identity of that robot? I had him made. Before your birth, we needed a lethal robot to protect the order of this country. However, the Hakaider Operation failed. We could not control him. And just before he was to be destroyed some scientists stole Hakaider and disappeared. He is sort of a ghost. He doesn't really exist. Hakaider only kills. Only destroys. He will bring chaos to my order! We must eliminate Hakaider, no matter what! Please, leave it to me. I am superior. Even to Hakaider. What Gurjev means by order is to take everybody's freedom away! If you resist him, he'll rearrange the inside of your head! He'll take your soul away. Peace in this country is fictitious. Everybody's always under surveillance and lives in fear. Look for this man, Hakaider. He's a dangerous individual and a threat to our peaceful country. Search for Hakaider! Please, fight with us to destroy Parliament. ...to save this country. That's right! If we destroy Parliament, we'll be the new leaders! Then we'll control everything! Let's live large! Don't get the wrong idea! These are precious funds! It's not your allowance! Don't be so square. We just wanna have some fun sometimes. Right? Idiot! You're slacking off too much. I have a dream of starting a ranch someday. So I'd better start saving. A ranch? You guys... Calm down. Being uptight is one of your weaknesses. Everyone has dreams. Don't you, Kaoru? You're not gonna to say, "to be an ordinary bride," are you? Anyhow, after destroying Parliament, any dream can come true. Because we'll be the law then. You are the same! You bastard! What are you doing? You damned robot! Just like Parliament, you are all ugly. Bastard! Arnie! Kaoru... Hey! Kaoru... You assholes! You killed him... You killed him... Our only hope... You... The invading artificial being has been destroyed. You killed him... You killed him... Our only hope... You're the same! You don't fight. You just look the other way. You killed him... You... Go to hell! Hey... Would you do me a favor? There's someplace I'd like to go. It feels great! This is my secret hangout. You're the first one I've ever brought here. It's the only oasis in Jesus Town. It's a natural spring. You should try some. Remember that talk... That talk about dreams of the future... Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be an ordinary bride... Why are you staring at me? You wanna come on to me or something? Well, okay then. But you'd better be good at it. I may look easy, but the truth is I ain't... Hey, you came to save this country, didn't you? Then fight with us! Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be an ordinary bride... Hakaider has entered the area. The halls of Parliament and 95% of the soldiers have been destroyed. All surviving soldiers proceed to the central hall. Do you want to live? Do you live and have a will of your own? I never believed someone like you could exist. Whether you're human or robot, we must keep discipline to maintain our order. Nonsense. Order made by whom? I don't recall accepting such rules. I am justice. In the name of justice, I will terminate you! Indeed... If you are justice then I am evil. Look. Do you know why flowers are beautiful? Because they are obedient. People should be like flowers. You and I will grow flowers together. And we will make them bloom. I made you. Following me is your destiny. I can give you even more power. I will decide my own destiny. I am the destroyer and the judge. You are a failure, after all. Die, Hakaider. Stop! Stay away! Are you going to kill me? You're not worth killing. I am justice... I am justice... I am justice... I am... You know, I never considered myself an environmentalist, but the idea of somebody free-dumping biomass is really starting to tick me off. I mean, we're looking at a two and a half acre crop loss if Sea Mine doesn't stop dumping by-product. Yeah, well, we don't know it's Sea Mine, do we? Yeah, and we don't know there is no Santa Claus, either. Hate it when I'm right. Yeah. The old man's gonna freak. (RUMBLING) What the hell was that? You... You don't suppose they had the nerve to dump while we're here, do you? God, I hope so. (RADAR BEEPING) Where are you going? We're gonna catch these guys red-handed. Look. They're circling back. Now maybe the UEO will get off their butts and do something. (BEEPING RAPIDLY) Turn around, Jenna. Turn around. What the hell is that? Jenna? Jenna! Jenna! Jenna! (BEEPS) (PANTING) ORTIZ ON PA: Commander Ford, you have a call. Commander? Jonathan? Something wrong? Must be doing extra laps. Commander, I'm sorry to disturb you, but you have an up-link on hold. Take a message. I tried that, sir. Well, try again. Jonathan, it's your father. I know. He's been on hold a while. Sir? What? Okay. The Fitness Center? No, my quarters. Secured line. A secured line with his dad? They have a special relationship. I guess. Hello, sir? Mr. Ford, I can put you through now. Sir? Sir? Mr. Ford? Nice. Hello? Anybody there on that nice sandy beach? You waiting for somebody? Where's my son? Who are you? Who are you? I asked you first. I got it, Tony. Commander Ford, do you know this guy? Jonathan, who is this person? Person? Goodbye, Tony. Dagwood, put this back where you got it. Shame on you. Where did I get it? CHARLES: Rick and Jenna are missing. The bodies were never recovered. When did this happen? Yesterday afternoon. How's Ben taking it? Your brother's a mess. Rick and Jenna were good friends. Dad... I just don't think I can get away right now. Jonathan, you know I wouldn't call if I didn't need you. I'd handle it myself, but this new facility has all my attention. I've got half the business leveraged into this start-up. I can't lose focus. What about Ben? He's your chief operating officer. If I came down there I'd be stepping all over his toes. He and Mike Rainer hate each other. Like throwing fuel on the fire. This thing with Sea Mine South Atlantic has turned into a full-blown range war. Mike Rainer likes you. You're a big shot in the Navy. No, Dad, the UEO has got to stay neutral. Jonathan, I'm not asking you down here in your professional capacity. I'm asking you as my son. Look, you made it perfectly clear to me a long time ago that my life's work is not important to you. Dad. That is a much larger conversation. Then let's not have it. Give me a couple of days. That's all I'm asking. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Just don't let this get any uglier, Ben. It's pretty ugly already. I may not have Jonathan's finesse, but Rainer and his Sea Mine goons are diggers, and a cool head to them just makes an easier target. Look, Dad, give me 24 hours, I'll have Sea Mine on their knees. If you think I'm going to give you permission to retaliate, you're dead wrong, Ben. Dad... No! Now, I don't want you doing anything until Jonathan gets here. Do you understand me? LUCAS: The pattern of ice pack breakdown is consistent. BRIDGER: You're sure it's just not a minor coastal disturbance? No, no, there's definitely a trackable pattern, and this is nothing minor. The emergence of farming and mining in the area have completely altered the natural ecology. Activity which has caused the water's temperature to rise. There's still a ceiling of cold water running through it, though, right? No, see, that's the problem. It's forcing warm water deeper along the trench, blowing it right back through our interior ice pack. Those idiots in the farming and mining industries are destroying our ice caps. Well, that's the price of progress, Lucas. The gains of providing affordable food and mineral products to the world outweigh the seasonal anomalies of a single ice floe. Besides, both industries are sanctioned by the UEO. You know that logo at the top of your paycheck? Captain, with your permission, I need to take a few days off. Is this your father's business? You know, the natural resources of the world belong to everyone. Aqua farming and mining are signatories to the UEO Natural Resources Act. We're supposed to stay neutral. I understand that, sir. But by staying neutral, the UEO is only fueling an explosive situation, a situation that's cost my father millions, as well as the lives of two of his research workers. Maybe you should be there. Permission granted. Thank you, sir. Oh! Sorry. Thank you. You're welcome. Are you going somewhere, Commander Ford? I have to go see my family, Dagwood. You have to go see your family? You don't want to go see your family? Sometimes. But not this time? I just don't always get along with them, is what I mean, Dagwood. You don't like your family? No, no, no, I love my family. It's just easier to love them from far away. It's like when you go to a restaurant. Going to families is like going to a restaurant? No, no, that's not what I mean. I mean, we tend to be nicer to total strangers. You know, friends, waiters. We tend to behave better, we have more patience, we don't drive them to distraction. You know, familiarity breeds contempt. None of this means anything to you, does it? The part about the restaurant does. A little. I like restaurants. I guess we're just more at ease showing our bad side to people who have to love us. It's complicated. No. I get it. We have family because we have to drive them to distraction, where there is a restaurant that we go to to be nice to people who don't have to love us. Exactly. (CHUCKLING) COMPUTER VOICE: Mag-Lev engaged. Be seated to avoid injury. Thank you, Commander Ford. Next stop, Docking Bay 2. Anytime, Dagwood. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) I don't know, Ben. It doesn't sound like something your father would go for. We have to take care of ourselves, Paulie. Nobody understands that better than my father. FORD: Hey, Paulie! Iced tea over here. Hey! Jonathan, when'd you get here? I just got here. Good to see you, man. Sit down. Finish your dinner. Thanks. How's your mom? She's good, she's good. I'll tell her you asked. Let me get you another one of these. Ben? I'm fine. Paulie's on aerators tonight. He's gotta go. Since when do we run at night? Since you've been gone. Paulie. Yeah. Another time. Okay. Look, Ben, this wasn't my idea. It's okay, Jon, I understand. It's not like it matters. Well, it matters to me. I just don't know what to do about it. I mean, you and Dad are entitled to your own relationship, even one that sucks. I just don't see why ours has to suck, too. You're not around that much. Well, maybe I can do something about that. No, Jon, you're not around that much. So what difference does it make how we get along? And so far as the old man seeing you as the only answer to the problems he can't solve... Well, I can't do much about that. I make good decisions when I'm allowed to, Jon, and I can be very effective. Thank you. DARWIN: Dying. Dying? Who's dying. Sea lions, schools, many dolphins. He's been like this all morning. What is it, my friend, huh? A predator? An orca? Bigger than orca. Bigger? An eating mammal? Eating fish. Scaring dolphin. Okay, where is this big fish, Darwin? Near land. Warm water. Comes from cold water. Likes warm now. You know, maybe that activity in the South Atlantic has stirred up a pod of killer whales. But he says it's not killer whales. So what is it? CHARLES: Missing? What the hell's Paulie doing out there in the middle of the night running aerators? I thought that with all that's been going on, we should be running nighttime back-ups. With all that's been going on, we should be staying the hell in our homes at night. Paulie's got a family. Yeah, we know how important family is to you. I've been on with the Coast Guard all morning. I gave them a full description of the launch and the aerator grid. But so far there's no sign of Paulie or the boat. Dad, Ben was just trying to do his job. I can handle this, Jon. MAN: Mr. Ford, there's a call from Mike Rainer here for you. Mr. Ford? Yeah? Mr. Rainer? Your father around, Jon? I've found something I believe belongs to you. You want to send someone to get it? Looks like chop slammed it against the struts all night. That still wouldn't account for this. I don't know what did this. I'm sure you don't. Hey, junior, maybe you ought to tell me why you had a man at my rig in the middle of the night. Don't try and turn this around on me, Rainer! I'm not turning nothing around. Guys, guys. Look, I'm totally clean on this, Jon. I had nothing to do with any of your father's accidents. Nothing. Now, maybe some of my guys off-loaded a little waste before they got you learn it? 'Cause people don't talk like that. (sighs) "Wh-What's here? A cup, "closed in my true love's hand? Poison, I see..." Something, something. "Hath been his timeless end. O churl! Drunk all, and left no friendly drop." Why, Dr. Zoe Hart, you know the line. My mother made me go to theater camp one summer. I was being punished. Oh, my Lord. I have found my Juliet. Who? Me? She'd love to. As a wise woman once told me, suck it up and do it. O churl. Hey. I'm sorry about earlier. Yeah, me, too. Listen, Dash's Shakespeare show is tomorrow, and if we can't host the after-party, then we're just... sunk for sure. So... MAN: Bonjour. (quietly): What? Have you lost your mind? Someone needs to cook. And Chef Tiberghien has years of experience. He trained at Le Cordon Bleu. Listen, I am sorry that I went behind your back, but it is clear that one of us just needs to step up and lead. I agree. Which is why I hired Fanny to be our waitress. FRANK (monotonously): Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil men do lives after them... Frank, Frank, that's fine, but could you do it with a little bit more enthusiasm? Uh, I don't do enthusiasm. W-Well, pretend that you're killing a small animal. It was one mouse! Mice carry Lyme disease. Uh, take-take five, Frank. All right, next up, Romeo and Juliet. (sighs) (gasps) You're Romeo? You're Juliet? Huh? Why? I-I was gonna do the scene with Tansy, but she got laryngitis. DASH: Well, I hope you're not sick, George Tucker, because you two have a big old smooch coming your way. Um... Oh, no. It's the doctor's office. It's a medical emergency. I got to run. But you... In a twist of bad luck, I somehow am playing Juliet to George Tucker's Romeo. Zoe Hart, you cannot kiss George Tucker. I know! I am lonely and hurting. If I kiss him, I'm gonna go right back down that rabbit hole again. So how do I get out of it? Lie. Right. You are good at this. WOMAN: Ooh, the Rammer Jammer is open again. I am just so happy. Hear, hear. (chuckling): Ooh. Eggs! Thank you. Bacon. Grits! Grits! Enjoy. (Lemon whoops, chuckles) You must be so cold exposing all that flesh. You know, they say 70% of the body's heat escapes through the... breast. Hi, guys. Glad you could make it. We wouldn't miss the grand reopening. This is very exciting. It... looks amazing. It looks just like the... the Rammer Jammer. Congratulations. Yeah. Congratulations. Of course we're here. Thanks. I'm glad you are. Hey, guys. How is everything? The eggs are fluffy. And the bacon's sublime. (quietly): But these grits... Revolting. Uh, look, I'll take care of this, all right? Breakfast is on the house. Hey there, Romeo. Hey. How's Tansy? Uh, she's doing much better. Poor thing still doesn't have a voice, though. Oh, yeah, you know, that can take a couple of days. But listen, I-I just... I wanted to talk to you. I actually had something I wanted to talk to you about as well. Oh. Um, no offense, but... Tansy is a little bit sensitive when it comes to you, and I don't want to make her jealous, so I don't think that doing this scene together is a good idea. Oh. You are right. 'Cause I really wouldn't want to upset Tansy. Oh. Well, great. Well, thank you for being so understanding. And now we just have to... think of a plan to present to Dash. LAVON: Okay, so, about this Shakespeare show... Oh, I wanted to thank you again for doing it with me. Jake's idea of theater was watching the cars go through the big spinny brushes at the car wash. Honestly, it's like a dream come true. Oh. It-it is some kind of dream. (chuckles) Those hash browns look amazing. But what are those? Those are supposed to be grits? I'm disgusted. And I eat roadkill on the reg. (quietly): Lemon, people are leaving, all right? Ratatouille back there can't cook grits. You know how. You got to show him. What? Hey, uh, everybody, hang tight a second, all right? Lemon is gonna show our brand-new chef how to cook grits. All right? (cheers and applause) I have mastered the classics of French cuisine from "A" to zed, but I have been vanquished by grits? Now you teach me? The shame. LAVON: I made a mistake promising AnnaBeth I'd do the Shakespeare night. I mean, I'm a football player-slash-mayor. I'm not a football player- slash-mayor-slash-actor. I can't humiliate myself in front of this town, in front of her. Lavon, I've seen you make eloquent speeches, debate with gusto. What makes you think you're gonna humiliate yourself? Do you recall a certain middle school production of The Wiz? (laughing): Oh. The one... the one with the stuttering Scarecrow? (laughing) Oh. Oh, my Lord. You were the stuttering Scarecrow? Every time I even think about being onstage, it-it all comes back to me. Lavon, that was a long time ago. You have matured. Th-There's no reason to avoid this. (knocking) Hey there! Oh, Shelby, honey, uh, can't you see I have a patient? Oh, sorry. Can't see who it is. Hey, Lavon. Well, now that I'm here... I wanted to see if you might want to get... lunch later. I've barely seen you all week. I-I know. I-I'm sorry, but the-the mayor needs me. (quietly): He is having a crisis of confidence. He's... falling apart. Hello. I'm right here. Of course. I'll be praying for you. (chuckles) Who is avoiding what here? Hey. Who is the doctor here? Now, I have oodles of community theater experience. I was the Modern Major-General, so I will clear the books, and I will spend the rest of the day... coaching you. I... don't know. Uh, don't you have patients? Nothing is more important than helping the town's mayor. (loudly): First... we improv. DASH: No, no, no. But I can tutor Crickett myself. She is terrible. Besides, the scandal of George Tucker and Zoe Hart performing Romeo and Juliet will be a huge box office draw. Okay, well, Dash, listen, we know that you want to fill seats. So I had an idea-- how about Tom and Wanda as Romeo and Juliet, huh? The newlyweds. I mean, they're fan favorites. There won't be a dry eye in the house. Now, do you all take me for an amateur amateur theater director? Tom and Wanda was obviously my first choice, but they claimed to be consumed by their new business endeavors. You leave it to us! Yeah! Go! Yeah. Two angels on horseback, BLT-- burn one-- and a large cow feed. Okay, enough with the diner lingo. You know that I don't understand you. (frustrated sigh) Hey, okay, from now on, everybody gets the special until we slow down. (forced chuckling) Well, she's joking. (clears throat) Uh, we are still cooking to order. Wade, please, I can't do this anymore, all right? I'm exhausted. I'm not a chef. Well, at least no one's storming out, Lemon, so that's a plus. So you have to. Besides, we don't have a chef, Lemon-- thanks to you. Yeah, well, at least my hire had other qualifications than "looks good in hot pants". Fanny happens to be a waitressing savant. You have got to be kidding me. You said I couldn't serve here unless I was 19. Well, that Fanny is a junior at Fillmore High. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, Fanny... I'm sorry I lied. A minor serving alcohol? Bill, we didn't know! Oh, I'm sorry, but I have no choice. It is my legal obligation to call this in. And they're gonna be taking your liquor license. (exhales) (buzzing) And that's Bertha, Claudia, Dolores, uh... Esther, Fae and, uh, Georgina. We named her after you, George Tucker. Aw. Thanks, guys. They are very cute. And I cannot believe that they all have names. (chuckles) Okay, so now about the Shakespeare show. Oh, we'd love to fill in. Great! But we can't. TOM: I have to work at the Dixie Stop tonight, and Wanda's got her hands full taking care of our babies. I have an idea. They need to be given their sugar water every hour on the hour. And look out for Miss Maisie Margaret-- she's wily! Oh, and don't forget to tape your socks to your suit. The bees will get in anywhere. And I mean (whispers): an-y-where. George, you ready? I'll teach you how to work the cash register. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just give me one second. All right. Okay. Hey, Zoe. Hey, uh, thanks for doing this. It's really touching to see how driven you are to help me and Tansy. Oh, you, my friend, are welcome. (chuckles) Okay, well... have fun. Okay, bees... here's your lunch. Yum! Mmm, yummy yum yum! Okay... who's in my pants? (grunts) Okay, come on, get out! Get out! Out! Out! Get out! (yells) (screaming) (loud buzzing) Us working together was obviously a mistake. Genius revelation, Lemon. We are a bar. We cannot survive without alcohol. And another one. You are really on a roll. What are we gonna do? Nothing. What can we do? Now, now. Wally, what are you doing here? Are you a ghost? Is this some kind of Obi-Wan thing? No, I was just down there in the basement getting my popcorn maker when I overheard you two. We lost our staff. And our liquor license. Well, can't say that's not disappointing news. We ruined your legacy, Wally. I'm so sorry. (laughing) Welcome to being a business owner. It's hard. It'll suck the marrow from your bones. It's all you're gonna think about morning and night to the detriment of your family and your friends. But every once in a while, you're gonna look around, you're gonna realize this is your place... your place and sometimes that's gonna make it all worth it. (laughing) But whatever. (Wally chuckling) Alcohol and Beverage Control doesn't close for the next half hour. What are we waiting for? Let's go. Come on. BRICK: Come on, now, Lavon, we have improv'd, we have discussed various theories and motivations. Curtain's in an hour. It is time to try the scene, at least once. I think we should do more of those mime-y exercises first. I can get out of the box. No... (ringtone playing) I'm-I'm sorry. I should've shut this thing off. Shelby again? (ringtone stops) Brick... what's going on with you two? It-it's complicated, you know. There's just something I have to tell her, and, uh, I don't know how she's gonna take it. But... we are here to work on your issues, so... so let's hear the speech. No, no, Brick, I can't. Uh-uh. Yes, you can! Lavon! Come on, on your feet. What we are gonna do is, we are gonna visualize. Okay? You... are not that stuttering Scarecrow anymore. You are... Sir Ian McKellen. You are Denzel Washington. (chuckles) That's right. So, close your eyes now, and imagine with me-- the theater is filled. The lights are going down. You step on the stage. The audience is waiting, watching. They're breathless. The curtain... goes up... and... Hey! Oh, come on, now. Wanda? Mm-hmm? I am so, so sorry, but I couldn't feed your bees. What? I'm-I'm so sorry. Th-They'll be so hungry. Uh, you know what? You go, and I will do the scene with Tom. Don't worry, we will make you proud. Oh. You're gonna kiss my husband. Just know, if there's any tongue, I'll remove yours. Noted. Hmm. And... 32 cents is your change. Seriously, George, could you fall any further? Boy, I dodged a bullet with you, huh? Good to see you, too, Daisy. (low chuckle) (sighs) Oh. Hey, babe. What are you doing here? How-how's your throat? No? "Why are you here? What happened to R J?" Oh. As it turned out, Dash had asked Zoe to fill in for Juliet, and I obviously didn't think it was a good idea for me to kiss her. (sighs) "Why the 'H' not?" Uh... because I knew how uncomfortable it'd make you... babe. Um... (panting) So... when he comes out, I'll do the talking. What? No, I'll do the talking. Besides, it could be a woman, sexist. Good point. Those abs you must spend, what, 40 hours a week cultivating might actually prove useful. Didn't know you'd ever noticed them, Lemon. Well, how could I not, Wade? You parade those things around town like they're dancing bears. Actually... You... stop it! Get your hands off! I am not a piece of meat. (door opens, closes) (footsteps approaching) (gasps) Oh, my... (whispering inaudibly) What are we doing? This doesn't make any sense at all. (indistinct whispering) Well, well, well, who do we have here? (laughs) Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. SHELBY (quietly): Lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth... Brick. Hey there, honey pie. I just want to wish you good luck tonight. Flowers? Really? The noble Brutus hath told you Caesar... (whispering): You have been blowing me off all week. I've barely seen you since the hospital, and we live together. I know, and-and I'm sorry, but it's the therapy-- it's a big time commitment. You know, preparing, then counseling. But I promise you, just a few more days and then I am totally yours. Yeah, well, I have to get ready. An actor prepares. (Frank continues in distance) Wait a minute. You're Juliet now? (audience applauds) Nobody tells me anything. All right, go... go find Romeo and run your lines. (whispering): Tom, I'm doing the scene with you now. I'm sorry. What? No. Tansy. It's... it's okay. Tansy and her, uh... her crazy girl logic thinks that me not wanting to kiss you means I have feelings for you, so if I don't kiss you, then she's gonna be pissed. So... look, I-I just hope you brushed your teeth, Juliet, 'cause you and I are gonna be doing some major lip-locking. Well, well, well. The tables have turned. Ms. Curran, please, help us. We had no way of knowing our new employee was a minor. Didn't you ask to see her driver's license? Well, she presented the only two forms of identification my partner checks. The point is, we're... we're a new business. We make mistakes. Surely, there must be some way we can make you forget this ever happened, right? Don't smile at me like that, Skeletor. But I think we can make a deal. What are you offering? Uh... free drinks for life? Lemon, you can't bribe the Alcohol Control Board with free booze. Oh. Uh... free breakfast? Free lunch. Oh, yes. That's sweet. But I think you both know exactly what it's going to take. (laughs) Fine. You're hired. (giggling): Yes. (flute plays) All the world is a stage. And all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances. And one man in his time plays many parts. His act being seven ages. At first, the infant, mewling and puking in his nurse's arms. And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school. AnnaBeth. Oh. Hey, there. I got your message. I'm sorry about your migraines. No, I'm sorry for leaving you in the lurch. You okay? Well, I have to do my scene with Dale King from second grade, who I know is a stalker and may try to peel my skin off later, but otherwise I'm fine. (chuckles) Guess doing one of these things with the man I care about is just not in the cards. AnnaBeth, I lied. I don't get migraines. It's just, I tried acting once. I stunk. I don't want to go through that again. Well, you probably don't even remember... The middle school production of The Wiz. Who could forget? Uh... But, Lavon, this time will be different. This time, you're doing a show with it. No matter what, it will be something we did. Our first town event. And if we stink? Then we stink together. Patricia? Quinn? Ruth? Susie? Where are you? Wanda! Wanda, I got your message. Is everything all right? No, Tom, nothing is all right. Our bees... gone. Okay, don't worry, we will find them. We... we have to put on something more colorful. We have to look like flowers. (Wanda squeals) Go to. I'm no more on it. It hath made me mad! I say we will have no more marriage! Those that are married already, all but one shall live. The rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery. Go. MAN: Yes! (applause, cheers) (whistling) DASH: And as Romeo comes upon Juliet's seemingly dead body, we begin. (flute plays) Arms... take your last embrace. And, lips, O you: the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss. (music continues playing) Whoa! No need for kisses, because I'm totally fine. What? No, you're not. Close call, Romeo. Oh! It must be a vision. Thou who is obviously dead appeareth awake. Oh, foul ghost, leave me. Allow me to kiss my very dead Juliet. No! Not a ghost at all. I liveth! I super-duper liveth. No kiss necessary. But I feel death coming. Nope. There's no death. Because it wasn't really poison. It was just a sleeping potion, and now it has worn off. And... happy ending! I see how it must be thus. Thus. (music ends) But surely thou wouldst feel healthier... with a kiss. (Zoe gasps) Now... with a kiss, I die. (applause) (grunts) Damn it. Table four is good to go. So, uh... the new cook's only here on a temporary basis. So I'm sorry if there's any, uh... Well, now, you know, it really is quite good. It is? Mm-hmm. Well, all right. (chuckles) Yo, congrats. Excuse me? - Put her fucking down! Her name's Rose! - Put her fucking down! - She's fuckin' crazy. Look at her. She's off her fuckin' dial! - I'm not putting her down. - Yes, you fuckin' are. - Just shoot him! - I'm not putting her down! Just shoot him! Just shoot him! - Fuck, man. - I'm not putting her down. I've got a bullet for your head if you don't put her down. - Give me the gun, Freddy. - Vicky, what are you doing? You're embarrassing me in front of everybody. - Just shoot him! - Don't do that. Shoot him! Just fuckin' shoot him! Vicky, please. - Just fucking shoot him! - Vic! Just fucking shoot him! Fuck, yeah, bitches! Go. No! No, no, no! No! No! - No! - Dad... - Fuck! - My skin's hot. Come on. Drink. Drink. ♪ .. Tiger land ♪ In any weather, we will see us with a grin... ♪ Hold tight, Rose. Hold tight. ♪ When we're behind, we don't mind ♪ We are gonna win We're from Tiger land ♪ The fighting fury, Tiger land ♪ And if you see us... ♪ Oi, oi! Eh! Fuckin'... Eh! Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate! Fuck's sake! Get back here! Hold on. Hold on, Rose. Mum! It's Jimmy, Mum! It's OK, Rose. Mum, it's Jimmy! Mum! I've got a little girl! She needs help! Mum, she's burning up! Please! Mum, come on! Don't kick the fuckin' door! OK, Rose. OK. Here. Thanks. You little prick. There's no way you were coming back. And now here you are, just like that. - I was. - Oh, yeah. I was, alright? I wondered what I'd say to you if you did somehow magically appear. It's funny, you know, I... I don't feel sad, happy. Just numb inside. I was gonna swing by, Mum. What do you want me to say, huh? Do you think I planned for this? Huh? - Can I bum a demon? - Knock yourself out. You seen your sister, by any chance? No. Well, I went round there yesterday. Had some chocolates for the girls. I knocked, waited, no answer. Called out, like an idiot. No-one came to the door. Not even the girls. Oh, so selfish. I don't have rights to see my own grandkids. It's that husband of hers. He's driven a wedge. - Didn't you go inside? - You even listening? No-one came to the door. I could tell that they were at home. Well, I did go around today. - Thought you said you didn't. - Well, I did. I wanted to use the car. So I went inside. There was a note on the coffee table saying they'd gone. Packed up and left. Gone? Gone where? Didn't say, alright? Just said they'd gone. Explains why no-one went to the fuckin' front door. I mean, at least they're all together, right? Oh...who'd want to live in a world where you can't even say goodbye to your grandkids? Sometimes, I swear, the end can't come soon enough. How much petrol you got in the Laser, Mum? - You are unbelievable. - How much? Who you trying to impress? Running around, trying to help this girl. I'm just trying to help her, Mum. If you can't understand that, then that's your problem. Well, maybe I can't understand. I'm just your stupid mother. What would I know? What would I know about you? -It's gone. Someone pinched it. - When? Does it matter? You stubborn old bat. Try the shed. There's a couple of jerry cans floating round in there. Fuck. Mick down the street, he never came back for 'em once his shed was done. He won't be comin' back for 'em. He went bush, like a lot of those nut jobs. Like that's gonna make a bloody difference. How about you, Mum? What are you gonna do? When it happens. You got anything planned? Got a few puzzles I'll try and get finished. Puzzles? Yeah. Good girl. Yeah. There you go. Good? Yeah? OK? We're gonna see Dad. You know what pisses me off the most, James? I already did this. I already said goodbye to you a number of times. More than once. And you had to turn up for real. Sorry, Mum. Don't be. It's a good thing what you're doing for her. You better go. Go on. Good luck with the puzzle, Mum. South-East Asia's gone. All of it's gone. My brother Steve's in Thailand. Steve-O. I'm glad we got to have that chat before the phones went down. Hope you were somewhere beautiful, bro. Over. Sorry, James. What for? That woman said she'd take me to Aunty Janice's. I shouldn't have listened to her. I keep getting you into trouble. No, no, no. Don't be silly. Alright? It's over now. Don't be upset, alright? You don't want your dad to see you upset, do you? - No. - No. You're a tough chick. - Say it. - I'm a tough chick. - I didn't hear you. - I'm a tough chick. - I don't believe you. - I'm a tough chick! What happened to your girlfriend? Things didn't work out. You broke up? Yeah. She was pretty but not...that pretty. - Yeah? - Yeah. She was weird. Thought you'd have had a much nicer girlfriend than that. Come on, James. Everyone's here! Dad! Dad, I'm here! Dad, it's me! Dad! I'm here! Come on, guys, it's me! Aunty Janice! It's me! I'm here! Dad! Where are you, Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad, it's me! Dad! Dad? Dad! Dad? - Hello? - Dad! Maybe they're over at the pond. Dad! Hello! Hello? Dad? - Aunty Janice! - Hello! Dad! James? - Rose! - James. - They're not here. - You OK? - They're not anywhere. - Stop. Did you find anyone? Um... - Rose, you can't go over there. - Let me get past! Rose, please. Please. Come on. Why not? Why not? You can't go down there 'cause they're dead. - Dad! Dad! - Hey! Hey! Rose! Rose! You can't! You don't know what he looks like! - Please, I need to see him. - He's there, Rose. Stop! Put me down! Put me down, please! - Put me down! - Hey, sit. - Sit down. - Please! I'm sorry. Rose. Rose! I need to see him. I need to make sure. OK. I'm sorry, Dad. I love you. - Rose? Rose. - No! - Now, come on. - No. I don't want to go. - Rose, he's dead. - I'm not leaving him. - Come on. - No! Come on, Rose. Come on. Let's go. - No, don't. - Come on. Let's go. Arggh! What? Dad wanted us to be together when it happened. This is where I need to be, James. With Dad. I'm sorry. I wish you could have met my dad. It was in your dad's pocket. I remember this day. It was her birthday. Dad got the waiters to sing 'Happy Birthday' to her. She looked really embarrassed, but I think she secretly liked it. You know, I'd have been a dad, Rose. Was that woman at the party pregnant? Not her. Someone else. Is she prettier than the other one? Yeah. Then how come you're not with her? 'Cause I messed things up. I've messed a lot of things up, Rose. What did you do? I left her all alone. There's still time. OK. Sorry I bit you. It's OK. See ya. See ya. James. I'm gonna watch you until I can't see you anymore. Can you watch me too? Until you can't see me? Sure. Ladies and gents, I'm sure you can all hear that rumble in the air. We've got just under an hour. I just just don't know what to say. I'm trying to think of something poetic. It's coming. It's coming. No! No! No, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! Maybe it's nothing more than hope. Or maybe we'll see each other again. Well, wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that be something? Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe. Zoe! I'm here. - Don't you touch me. - I'm here. - Don't you fucking touch me! - Zoe! - I'm sorry. Zoe! - You left me alone! I'm sorry. Zoe. I'm sorry. - You left me! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm here! I love you so much. I'm sorry. I'm here. I love you so much. I love you. - I love you. - I love you. It's beautiful. Ripped by Freaky. Sync. By A Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's time for cave-party time, baby! Aw yeah! Let's get this camp fire going! Dude, it's gonna burn. Dude seriously, it's gonna burn. You're gonna burn it. STOP IT! You're burning it right now here. Aw man! Dude, I told you. Dude, where do you see yourself in 10 years? Easy, I'm gonna be a stuntman. Dude, that's so lame. You're probably still be working at the park. STOP TALKING! Hey, Mordecai, have we ever think we should bring another friend? You mean, like a third person? I guess we keep our inner circle pretty small. But it's not like we're ever gonna find anybody cool enough for the park, so... Yeah. Good cave party dude. Rigby... wake up Rigby Rigby Rigby wake up! Dude just keep quiet! STAY BACK! Whoa dancing caveman! This guy is awesome! Dude you are awesome! Looks it time to go from Mordecai and Rigby to Mordecai, Rigby and Dancing Caveman. Third friend! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Anybody who can shot that much cheese is cool in my book. Who is that? He's a new friend. Dancing Caveman. Caveman? No, no, no way. I'm not having a caveman at the park. We are insured for it. What? ! That's not fair. Yeah! We can't just get rid of him. A caveman can not fit into this modern world. See? But it was one of us now. Really? What's his name? Get rid of him! But he will die out there alone. Come on! Benson! Please! B-E-N-S-O-N? Fine.You have a week to get him civilized. Nice! Thanks, Benson. But if he is not up to park's standards in a week. I'm calling a pound! We are gonna need some help. That is the most civilized caveman I have ever seen Please call me Greg Good luck with the benson test! My good man! Dude that is perfect Benson will totally let you stay Yeah! And probably offer you a job Alright! let's go! Wait Me know you worked hard to help But me not civilized Ha? You forgot something Love? Me's a meat that i can't be truly civilized into me find other half I don't know Is there anytime to find before meeting with Benson?

My love thousands of years and today begins a new Mordecai and Rigby give us an hour to catch up What do you want to do? Oh! We can't do that!

Call them off! What do you mean? Tell me why you do this? We going through some stuff right now I need a new job Caveman too strong and too many. You lose your jobs. Park destroyed. All my fault! Come on! Greg! We can do this. We just need use out brains. to think up something. Wait! In my time. My people value meat above all. You have meat. It's working! Dian. Greg! Come on! let's go! Come on! Come on! What are you doing? Me sorry. Dian. What must be done. I'm sorry.Dian You alomst did But you were right It's wrong to give up self. Greg! Dude! Unlock the door! Get out of there! Thanks for helping me But me not belong in modern world You could be happy here No no need TV No need pants Need Dian No Greg thanks for being our friend Benson? ! I saw everything I had Greg all wrong He gave up all for true love In a way he was more civilized than all of us Mordecai Rigby Clean up this mess Do it do it or you'll fired. Greg was pretty cool Do you think we should find another new friend? Two is good enough. And, er... how do you feel in yourself? Sorry? How do you feel in yourself? Does that mean the same as, "How do you feel"? Yes. Fine. Although, actually, I am feeling a bit... unhumped. Unhappy? That's the one. There's this girl who I like... like, a lot, but she's not speaking to me, so... Women, eh? Can't live with 'em, can't live without them. That's good. So true. Is that like, Buddha? Seriously? Cos if that's your own, you should work that up into a novel or something. So, now, you need to be aware that taking drugs as part of a medical trial does have risks, however small those may be. Dude, I've gobbled blank pills knocked out by rudeboys in gas masks. I go to un-franchised fried chicken outlets. I think I can handle a little bit of medical testing. Will it definitely come up? They're meeting for a big chat, JP. Ooh, big chat. No-one likes a big chat. Still, maybe it won't. That for the first month I was going out with Josie, I was also going out with Heather as well? Well, maybe it won't, so long as they don't talk about any of the following - men, relationships, emotions, life, what either of them have been doing, or how they've been feeling. Yeah, so it probably will. When's Heather getting back from Honkers? Tomorrow, and please don't call Hong Kong "Honkers". I know you're posh. You don't need to remind me. Dude, can you seriously stop fiddling with your bulbs? Regular checks, my friend. A check a day keeps testicular cancer at bay. Is that an official rhyme? The best time is after a shower when the skin of the scrotum is more relaxed. Oh, mate, I do not want to hear about how chillaxed your scrotum is. Maybe Heather's plane will crash, then I wouldn't have to tell Josie. I mean, I'm not saying I WANT that to happen, but it would be great for me if it did. Who's she flying with? Cathay Pacific. Cathay Pacific? No dice. Oh... Well, that's it, then. It's over. Yep, you're fucked. So, for the next three days, do you want to come medical trialling? We get PAID to take drugs. It's like a job, but... good. Er... yeah, JP. The man who checks his nuts once a day and won't drink unfiltered tap water? I'll sign up for dangerous medical testing. Hi. Just wondering if you'd read my play yet. No worries if not. Yep, here you go. So, what did you think? Obviously, since it's a 24-hour play season, I only had 24 hours to write it, so... No, I thought it was pretty tight. Yeah? It is tight, isn't it? I think it's tight. Maybe too tight. Ha. I mean, at 3am, I thought, "This is the best play ever written." And then I made a coffee and I looked at it again and I thought, "Actually, this might be the worst play ever written." And then I went to the loo and I looked at it again and I thought, "Actually, I think this might be the best play ever written." I think Nick might make a great Ainsley. He's got good hair and he's tall. Oh! What about Toby? Toby's got a great look. Yeah, if your idea of a good look is overweight and anxious. Exactly. Look, Candice, OK? This is an artistic enterprise that requires impartial decision-making. We're casting Nick, Ewan and Josh. You know Josh has got a girlfriend? OK, well, maybe not Josh, then. Mm. It's ideal, three days of loading up on free drugs, and, get this, THEY pay YOU 600 boys. Who's with me? 600 quid to get off your nut? They're not recreational. They're drugs for the medical market. Ones that make your nuts swell up and all your hairs fuse to make a horn. Who gives a fuck about having a massive, horny head when you've got 600 quid? Exactly. Buy a big hat. Two guys fell into a coma after one of these trials. You do know that? Well, if you can't stand the heat... What, go into a coma? Pretty much, yeah. Well, I think it sounds great. Really? Go with the flow, I say. Well, you just said it then, yeah, for the first time EVER. Maybe it'll be a bit like a spa. Pharmaceutical Butlin's. I could learn loads. Let's do it. Pharmacology is not the study of how to take drugs. That's like me studying geology by eating gravel! OK, we get it, Howard. It's not for pussies. Don't come, then. I'm not a pussy. I just think you're all out of your mind. Hey, Oregon, Candice! Come with us on a three-day medical trial. Yeah, no, we can't. Oh, no. Why? Well, we need to rehearse... Study. We need to study. She said rehearse. Yeah, she... she meant study. That's why I need to help her, because she doesn't even know the right word for it. So, hang on, if you're going to be away for three days, does that mean we have the place to ourselves? I will mostly be at the library, reading the book I have ordered. But I'll be eating and anti-eating here. Don't call it anti-eating, you freak. Just say shitting, like everyone else. Nice one. From scaredy-cat to drugs mule. Three days in a confined space. I realised, it's exactly what I need. You're going to tell her about Heather? This is ideal, because we'll be in a secure environment with medically trained staff, should she - not that she would - attack me. I'll be able to tell her everything, and she won't be able to storm off, and we can just talk and talk and talk. And she's got no choice but to just soak it up and listen to you. It's like torture. But in reverse. Nice. Hello, Audrey. That's a nice scarf. Morning, Howard. It's actually a snood. Fair play. Do you know if Principles Of Petrology In Ultramafic And Gabbroic Rock In The Brady Glacier, by GR Himmelberg, arrived by any chance? It certainly has. At last. Someone's already taken it out, though. What fresh hell is this? What do you think you're doing? I'm afraid I need this book. I'm doing a thesis on the Brady Glacier. I've been waiting seven weeks for it to arrive. So have I. So have a lot of people. Probably just us, I'd have thought. You can't have it, so jog on. No, I won't. Oh, really? And, er... what are you going to do about it, then? You pussy. I am not a pussy. So, why are you acting like a pussy? Right, that's it. Outside, now. YOU want to take this outside? Well, given there are no drinks permitted inside the library, and I'm about to open up a can of whup-ass, I think we may have to. This is going to be good. Stack of reading. Plenty of TV. A few potentially harmful compounds. Yeah, it's hard to know what to pack for a medical trial. Cos I thought there might be a party at the end. For the survivors? Hey. Sam. What are you doing here? Mind-fuck or what? I told you I'd be here three weeks ago, JP. I forgot. Anyway, I'm only really here cos my crew basically dragged me along. I'm kind of like their leader. Oh, you're fucking kidding me? The four of you couple up and play bridge for three days, while I get my gooseberry on? Hey, four-way bridge is a tops idea. You know how to play, right, Kinghead? No, because we're not retired teachers. Just standard contract. No Chicago or rubber or any freaky shit like that. I can't believe I'm stuck with boring couples. This is like going on holiday with Fleetwood Mac. I might head home. No, no, Vod, don't. We won't be coupley. We'll... we'll all share a room and muck about. It'll be a proper hoot. Well, better be a proper hoot. So, er... hi. Um... full briefings in the pack. But the overview is, this drug is still in its primary testing phase, so, there's no mobile or Internet access, no alcohol, cigarettes or other narcotics permitted on the premises. OK, I'm off. Cheers, then. Er... Right, um... any other questions? Hi. Yes, what does primary testing phase mean, please? I'll field this one, Doc. I'm a pharmacology student. Um... the primary testing phase means that it hasn't been tested on humans yet. Yeah, but someone will have tried it, surely? Like, one or two people? No, that's what this is for. Have YOU not tried it? No, I'm the senior developer. Of course, yeah. You only developed it. Why would YOU try it? That would be ridiculous. Do you want to leave, Kingsley? No, I love a trial, especially one with the possibility of a death penalty. Ha-ha! Come on, then. What you got? Oh, I've got... the lot. What's going on? Everything OK, Howard? That's right! Run home to your mummy! This is my library now! If I see you here again, I'm taking you down! You can run, but you can't hide! It's no biggie. It's made you realise how much you love her. When you're done, meet me by the pool. There isn't a pool. The... pool table. Or a pool table. The table? There is a table, yes. Meet me by the table. So, Doc, what drugs are we using? What are they? Antibios? Antipyros? Anti-inflammatories. An-flams! Sweet. I call them an-flams because I'm studying pharmacology. Yes, you said, several times. I'll be in my office, if you've any questions. I've got one now, actually. Could you maybe, just as a pro, check my balls? I'm sure it's nothing. I'm really sorry. OK. Because there's a whole world out there, Ainsley, outside this door. Room. Outside this room. Past this wall. Door. Past this door. Beyond this... road? Street. But road is fine. Rose! Ainsley's happy here! As was Alfonso until you turned him against me. Actually... Ogs, I really don't get the whole Alfonso thing. Cos, like, Hilda marries him, but also hates him. So, I'm like, "Why do that?" Because she's cruel. OK, moving on. Anyone home? I thought you were at the trial. Sacked it off. What's all this then? We Had To Kill Her, by OP Shawcross. I've written a play. Oh, brilliant. Cos that's exactly what the world needs, innit, more plays? Yeah, well, you don't know anything about theatre, so... Er, excuse me. I've been to the theatre. You've been to A theatre. And it was rubbish. You saw STOMP. Which is theatre. No, it isn't. It's using the wrong things as drums. It doesn't count. Now, can you please leave, because we need to rehearse? Leave my own house? Well, no, just the living room. Oh, just the living room. So, where exactly am I supposed to do my living? In any room apart from this one. OK. Cool, guys. Who's up for a board game? I've got five. Wanna start with Risk? Could be fun. Or it could be really dull and take hours. That's why it's called Risk. Sam was in the middle of telling us about her gap year, so... Well, great. My gap year stories are incredibly strong. JP, mate, following me here could be the last scene of a rom-com, but could also be the first scene of a horror film that ends up with my head on a stick and you wanking. I would never... put your head on a stick. Hey, JP. Can I ask a quick favour? Er... I was just about to lay down a gap year 'dote. It won't take a moment. ..Because you don't understand love, you selfish bitch! Your heart is small and shrivelled, like a sun-dried tomato! What's a sun-dried tomato? Can you not work it out? Given that its name is also an exact description of how it's made. I'm sorry. We weren't allowed tomatoes. They're part of the deadly nightshade family, actually. Plus it's quite a clunky line. Well, you know what they say. There are no such things as bad lines, just bad actors. Mm, don't think they do say that. Look, I know you're pissed off because I cast Danny instead of fat Toby. But, please, don't fight me on every tiny thing. Where did you get that? Where did you get it, more like? Meaning what? Meaning you turned us lot into a play! What? That's crazy. You're crazy. Am I? Yes, you are. You're so self-obsessed that you've managed to interpret a piece of expressionistic agitprop as being about you. Which it is not. Not just me. It's also about Kingsley caring for his mum, only I'm his mum, and-and... and Kingsley's called "Ainsley". OK, I may have used elements of the "Kingsley caring for his mother" trope, but only because my own childhood was, unfortunately, very normal. Aw. There's little drama in your parents staying together and collecting wine, so I borrowed one or two things. You turned Josie into a sort of a troll thing called Gwen, who can't read and eats leeks and fucks everyone. It's well out of order. As a matter of fact, Gwen is a metaphor for the demise of feminism, hence why her surname is Feminism. What, so those two debt collector guys aren't JP and Howard? Mm? The toff and the guy he rides like a horse? Lord Hugo and MacTartan clearly represent the coalition government. You know there's a bit at the end where Delphine's name changes to "Oregon"? Um... I... No, there isn't. It's probably the bit where you... ooh, sorry, Delphine, tell me... ooh, sorry, Hilda, that I drain the life out of people and then suffocate me with the net curtains! Which you couldn't do, by the way, cos you can breathe through 'em. But thanks for killing me. Really appreciate that! Oh, God. Sorry, I-I-I just can't do this. You said you would! Get Doc to do it or something. He's done it twice. I can't ask him again. It'll look like I'm getting off on it. You're not getting off on it, are you? There's bad things in me. I'm full of lies and bile. I've deceived the woman I love. I deserve to have cancer. Yeah. I-I-I'm pretty sure cancer doesn't work like that. If it did, Roy Castle'd still be alive and Tiger Woods would be carrying around a tumour the size of a fucking golf bag. Well, let me check yours, then. Absolutely not. Why? So I can see if mine feel different! I just need a comparison, a control. All right! Fucking hell. Have a feel. Brisk, though. Like you're checking a peach. Nothing that could be described as a fondle. Aah! Are you OK? That was right in the zip. This fabric is very abrasive. Why are you punching a beanbag attached to the ceiling? I'm training. I'm going to be in a fight. So, how's it going? Well, I can now see why all the training bits in films are in a montage, because it takes ages. I think I'm doing punching wrong. I don't know if the thumbs are meant to be inside or outside the fist. It's amazing how complicated fighting is, yet so popular among stupid people. I'm going to get pummelled, aren't I? No. In fact, my friend Chris once showed me this illegal video about mind control by this devil man called Darren. Derren Brown. And he did this thing where you confuse your opponent by asking them weird questions which sort of melt their minds - and make them easy to attack. - Candice, we need to rehearse. Give me a minute. I don't know what you're meant to say to somebody before a fight, but be careful. I don't think that's what Don King whispered to Tyson seconds before he bit Holyfield's ear off, but... thanks. So, me and Max Parr went swimming in a waterfall in South Africa, and when we got back, he found a leech in his arse. So, he tried to get rid of it by sitting on a ferrule that we'd covered in salt. What's a ferrule? It's the pointy end of an umbrella. Didn't know there was a word for that. Well, there is. It's a ferrule. Anyway, he accidentally pressed the button, which opened the umbrella whilst it was in his arsehole! Did that really happen? You bet your sweet bippy it happened. My gap year 'dotes are the stuff of legend. Do you have any more? I have seven more. Are you drawing an outline of your head? I think it's swelling up, so I'm taking hourly measurements. Will you help me? I think JP's been fucking with me. Er... your head's fine, Kingsley. The pills they've given me are poisoning me. I'm nauseous and I'm itchy and I think my balls might be lumpy and I can't move my little toes. No-one can move their little toes. Kingsley, maybe you should just leave. No. Look, I... I need to talk to you. Well, that's very sweet and everything, but technically I'm not a real doctor. No, about something else. OK. I, um... I... OK, look, um... I didn't mean to, but... I... I... Oh, my God! I'm hyperventilating! No, you're not. You're just breathing a lot. I think I'm having a heart attack! Can testicular cancer give you a heart attack? ! OK. OK, OK, Kingsley, calm down. It's going to be OK. I'm going to fix this. So, we're on Max's dad's boat off the coast of Durban, and we were muchos masheoed. We'd taken, like, three bongs with us. Anyway, we were doing some scuba diving in pairs, and my partner was this proper fatty called Ed. You know, he's, like, a huge whale of a guy, such a bell, and it was hilarious, right, because he was scuba diving whilst we were getting our bong on, so the boat didn't have its anchor down and it drifted, like, two miles, and he couldn't find us, he got sunstroke and shat himself and nearly died! Guys, he shat himself. In his wet suit. He nearly died. My God, that's awful. No, it's not. It's... it's very funny. JP, you nearly killed a man. Well, the sea nearly killed a man and he was more of a boy, so... Wow. Yeah, that's loads better! Oh, come on. He didn't actually die. Yeah, but he could have, and he was your partner. You're focusing on the wrong bits here. I was muchos masheoed. He was really fat. It's very funny. I'm sorry. I don't care what you say. Deep down, I know that that is a cracking anecdote. There are several boys at Stowe that refer to that story as El Classico. That's how good it is. I suggest you think on. Maybe it's not me that's out of whack here. In his wet suit, not in the sea. In the wet suit. OK, Rose, when you say, "I don't give a fuck what you think," maybe push over the chair. Yes. Brills. Thanks, Ogs. Ogs. Ha-ha-ha-ha! And I just stare out of the window? Yes, because you're pining for South America. So I hear a chair falling over behind me and I don't turn round, and that makes sense, does it? Yes, it does, because you're pining very hard to be away from the awful people you share a house with. So, it's like, push over chair. I don't give a fuck what you think. I do exactly what I want. Mm. Don't say it like that, though. Can you just shut up, please? How should I be saying it? Ignore her. Well, when you say, "I don't give a fuck what you think," it should be like you genuinely don't give a fuck, not like you're saying it to piss people off. Hang on. If Hilda doesn't care, then she's not manipulative. She's passive. That's the opposite of everything Ogs has been saying. Exactly. Hilda is passive. She's making problems for people on purpose. Why else would she marry Alfonso? It seemed like a good idea at the time. What kind of defence is that? So, did she love Alfonso or not? Yeah! No. Ish. She's complicated. She's not complicated. She's actually very simple. She's totally thoughtless and resolutely self-centred. That's the character. Maybe Hilda's just unpredictable and up for stuff. Maybe that's why she's like that. What you need to be asking is why Delphine gives her such a hard time when it's none of her bloody business. Yeah, I completely agree. Why is Delphine so judgmental all the time? All she does is come in, judge people, then leave. Yeah, she does, doesn't she? Because... Delphine is a good person. Like fuck she is. She is! That's why she says, on page 12... .. "I'm a deeply good person." And on page 32 she says, "I wish I wasn't such a good person." And then Gwen says, on page 39, "You are so kind to Gwen. "You are like beautiful angel to Gwen. You are." See? Delphine is good. You're bad. Your character's ba... The character Hilda, who is in no way based on you, is bad. Have you told her yet? I tried to, but my head's throbbing and I keep vomiting air. Huh! Faking illness to get out of the high jump. Old school. I like it. I'm not faking it. I think the drugs they're giving us are causing my system to shut down. Look, I need to try this anecdote out on you. I've been told it's hilarious, but it went down like spunk soup. Found it. Owen, Kingsley. You're on the placebo. Oh, thank God. What are you on? I'm also on the placebo. What about me? No, JP, I can't. Oh, come on. Play fair. Fine. You are... on the drug. Shit. I wish I hadn't asked now. What am I on? No! No, I can't do any more. That's really naughty. Go on, just one more. Adam Colinson. One L. Kadan, Nina! You are... also on the drug. What was the other name? Guy Morgan. Morgan. Guy. You are... What the hell are you doing? ! There were some concerns, and I thought that... ..transparency is... important. But not as important as secrecy. This is a double-blind test. Testees cannot know what they're taking, or this is utterly useless. Well, that's political correctness gone mad. He thought his head was swelling up. I was just trying to help. You have ruined this trial. Well done! Vod? What? Oregon's a bit of a state. Probably not getting enough attention. Rose has dropped out of the play. Looks like she might have to cancel. Look, don't say anything, OK? I know. My play's shit. My cast don't want to do it. I know all this. That's not why I'm here. Please don't wind me up, Vod. I don't need that right now. I'm sorry, OK? It's my fault for interfering. I'm a prick. Course you're not. It's my fault for being arrogant, high-handed and inconsiderate. Yeah, OK. Well, you could quibble with at least one. Oh, sorry. Yeah, no, you're not arrogant. Look, don't cancel the play, yeah, Ogs? I have to. I haven't got anyone to play Hilda. Got a script knocking about? Why? Well, I'd better learn at least some of the lines, otherwise the director'll go fucking mental. You... want to be in the play? Not really. But I want to help out my mate, so... ..guess that's what I gotta do, innit? Mate, you should do it here. Buses are perfect for dropping bad news. They're jolly, they're full of people. They absorb and disguise arguments. It's like farting in Venice. Anything interesting? Just one from Heather. She just got on the plane. Not Aeroflot or Iran Air, by any chance? Dunno. I just... I can't wait to talk to her. Cos I feel so bad about how we left things last term. And I don't think she's completely over you, if I'm honest. No, I really think she definitely is. And there's one from Candice. She says she's in a play and that we could go along later. Hey, guys, can I drop you a 'dote? Great. Student theatre, the ultimate good time. OK, three years ago, I'm on my gappy in Durban, and my friend Max's dad owns, amongst other things, a mine and a massive boat. So, we... Oh, God. Sam... Sam. Sam, hey. Now that we've busted out of there, any plans for later? Case of me and you on the mega-lash? I think probably not, actually. Er... why? Well, because, firstly, we've signed a form promising not to drink for the next 72 hours and, secondly, because you left a fat boy to die in the sea. Is that the anecdote? It is, yeah. Yeah, but it sounds a lot better when you tell it properly. So, he's back. And he's planning to borrow some books. With his blood. I was actually thinking of borrowing some books with my library card. So, this is it. Fighting. I'm actually doing it. Don't worry. It won't take long. Yield! Do you yield? Do you yield? What colour is nine? What? What's the capital of Wednesday? How fast is a fathom? Uh! Do you yield? Are we saying yield, then? Is that how we're doing this? Ah! Yes! Are you all right? But I want to be a tooth doctor. You can't be a dentist if you can't read, Gwen. Those are the rules. Do you understand me? Now, take off that sack. I'm going to do that thing you like to you. Oh, my God. Is that me? Is that thing in the sack meant to be me? What, the one now being humped by JP? Yeah, I think it is. I'm going to fucking kill her. On your dad's boat in Durban. Yeah. Masharama! Mashley Cole! Mash, er... potato. Yeah. Um... do you remember Ed? Um... yeah, the fat guy. He did, in his wet suit. I know, it was so funny. Was that... my fault? But you mustn't tell Ainsley. I won't, Gwen. You can trust me. OK, well, one night in Portsmouth, when Ainsley was away, I made sex with Bill, the big sailor who was staying in my boarding house. Oh, Gwen. You're so easy. I know, Delphine. I wish Gwen was more like you. But it's not really cheating if you're drunk, though. How is it? It's not great. Yeah, it's confusing, cos you're making a thumbs-up. OK, so... That's better. Sorry, by the way. It's not your fault. I wasn't sure whether or not to have the thumb in or out, is the thing, you know. When punching. Me too. Why are there not more online forums dedicated to that? That's useful information. What about the police? Don't let them put Gwen in jail. Don't worry about PC Hughes, Gwen. When we explain it to him, he'll see that... we had to kill her. This is the writer, so... props! So... What did you think? Yeah, I suppose I thought, "What the fuck was all that about?" Look... I have to tell you something. It's not a big deal. And, if anything, it's made me really value what we have. Oh, my God. I got off with Baz. In Southampton. Before or after us? Once before. Um, then... after. Also, as a sort of follow-up mistake when I finished it with him. I'm so sorry, Kingsley. I... I feel terrible. And this is definitely not how I wanted you to find out from some retarded version of me. Yeah, well, these things happen. We've just gotta try to be understanding, I guess. Yeah? Yeah, I need to tell you something too. I was still going out with Heather until a few weeks ago. I accidentally two-timed you. What? I wanted to dump her, but her grandad was dying, and it was awful. Oh, fuck. I mean, I've been wanting to tell you for ages, because I feel so guilty all the time. I think that's why I thought I spent New Year's eve with my family, Which was actually very special. My cousin Randy, This kid from this rural coal mining town, Came out to us. And I think old Liz Lemon had a little something To do with that. Randy's gay, everybody! He's gay. I think everyone knew. Finally! Over the break, I forgot what floor I worked on. Six, Tracy. Six! I knew it was a character from Blossom, But I couldn't find the Joey Russo button. Hold the door! You guys, I had the most amazing New Year's. I met James Franco's manager. It was like a fairy tale. My client, James Franco, he's actively looking For a relationship with a human woman To dispel certain unsavory rumors. Are you available for a fake romance with a movie star? Does chewing on a sponge trick your brain's hunger center? Yes! Yes! A million times yes! So this is some arranged Hollywood relationship? With James Franco. Can you believe they went to me Before Ayilla from The Real World: Cancun? I think it's great. The exposure will do wonders for you and TGS. Lemon, I want you and Jenna to have a meeting With James Franco and make sure his manager doesn't screw her. Too late! Wait, which way did you mean that? I had a pretty amazing New Year's too. My wife and I are trying for a daughter, And on New Year's eve I think I got Angie pregnant. No, no, no, no. Okay, but I was gonna describe it real good. How was your New Year's, sir? Perfect. Oh, my god! As you know, on New Year's, I finally met my birth parents. So... thank you for asking about that! - I called her, Lemon. - What? I called Nancy on New Year's eve at 3:42 a.m. Damn that Phoenician wine! And you don't remember doing it? The last thing I remember is going into a closet And switching clothes with Bob Ballard. Look, I don't think you actually spoke to her. You hit pound after the number. I think you left a message. Cerie, get on her YouFace page. - Lemon, do you mind? - No. One second. Okay. Okay, her YouFace page says they're on vacation. They're borrowing a friend's condo in Florida. Oh, what have I done? The woman is on vacation with her husband as we speak, Probably having beach sex, which is the third best sex After elevator and White House. Is there any chance that she hasn't heard it yet? As a frequent leaver of drunken messages, I can tell you no good can come of this. As a frequent receiver of drunk messages, They are not cute, even when they're from Liz. Da da da... Good lord, I've Lemoned the situation with Nancy! I've got to erase that message. "Lemoned"? That's not a thing People are saying now, is it? Cerie? Lemoned. Doing it awesome. Here's the general idea, Jenna. You and I pretend that we met while filming a movie Called Space Attack. My title. This movie will never be released Because my performance will be deemed "too provocative for America." Oh, I wish I lived in France. But out of this experience, We found each other, et cetera, et cetera. Five dates a week, one fight a month. And because of a product placement deal with Jamba Juice, The fight will be in a Jamba Juice. I love Jamba Juice! And this is the non-disclosure agreement Regarding anything you two may learn about each other During the course of the relationship. Yeah, what exactly is Mr. Franco covering up here? i - Liz, are you familiar with Japanese moe relationships, Where socially dysfunctional men develop Deep emotional attachments to body pillows With women painted on them? I am not, James. Neither am I, Liz! Which is why it's so weird The tabloids are running all these stories Saying I'm in love with a body pillow. I mean, it's crazy! Then why is that here? Why? I mean, why is this table here? I mean, why is that lamp here? Kimiko is-- It is here like any other object. Objects are made by men and used for many purposes. But we never love objects. Where do I sign? Hello? Liz? It's Randy, Randy Lemon. Oh, hey, Randy. What's up? Well, my parents and I are kind of fighting right now. Because you spilled orange soda on the couch? No, because of the gay thing. - So now I'm here in New York. - Wait, you're in New York? Yeah, I figured I'd come stay with my cool cousin Liz. Besides, what better place for me to be Now that I'm a homo? Is that the one we call ourselves? Nope. Get a cab, okay? Go to my apartment. 168 Riverside Drive. Okay. Uh, actually there's a guy here Who offered to drive me if I helped him move a couch Into a van. Nope. That's a serial killer. Just get a cab. I'll pay for it. You have Amish here? Just get in the house, Randy. Kenneth, Jonathan, I need one of you to help me With a very special assignment. I hope it's me. But I'm honored just to be standing here with you. I'm going to drive up to Waltham, Massachusetts, Break into a woman's home, And erase a potentially embarrassing and destructive Answering machine message. The home in questions has a doggy door. That will be our way in... Using these hangers. Prove that you are lithe enough to accompany me to Waltham. It's Kenneth! You sicken me. I did it! Angie just called. She's pregnant. - That's awesome. - Congratulations. Yes. And it gets better. I just had a burrito! Well, now you just have to hope that it's a girl. I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon, Because I yelled "Susan B. Anthony" - At the moment of conception. - Well, that'll do it. We're gonna name her after the place That she was conceived. It was a pretty wild night. So we gonna name her either Virginia, Netjet, or bathroom at Teterboro airport. Oh, Liz, I'm in love. You're really not. James and I just had lunch at The Spotted Pig. The paparazzi were everywhere. The gossip blogs are calling us "James." It's a combination of Jenna and James. Jenna, look, I'm glad that you're having fun, But is this really all that you want? I mean, you and I are not getting any younger. You don't know that thing I sleep in isn't working. Don't you want more than some fake boyfriend? Don't you want to be happy? Liz, I am happy. All this attention, getting my picture taken, Having ice-cold diarrhea from drinking too much Jamba Juice... It's everything I ever wanted. Sorry, sir. That happens sometimes when I unhinge my pelvis. Oh, I was afraid of this. It's not an answering machine, it's a voice mail. Okay, well, we just need to look for clues To her password. It'll be like the Da Vinci Code. Ehh... albino monk! That's a mirror, Kenneth. She must have written it down somewhere. Try on the computer. Okay. Search... Oops! I just took my picture with that little camera thing. - Kenneth! - All right. I just need to erase that picture. Whoops, I just made it the desktop image. How did I do that? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Ah! Nancy's husband has been sleeping on the couch. "emailing image to address book"? What is wrong with me? - Hey, Liz. - Oh, thank god. Randall Lemon, where were you? I'm sorry, I met these two guys And they just dropped me off. Well, I'm glad they brought you home, but... That's where I'm meeting them later... A bar called "Home Butt." - No, you're not. You came to New York to see your cool cousin, Not run around with strange gentlemen. You don't have to be so protective of me. This is New York City, Randy. Liz, you know how hard it was growing up gay In Methenburg, Pennsylvania? The local TV station edited Will Grace down so much that it was just called Karen. Being in New York, this is the first time I've ever felt like myself. And I want to go out and enjoy it, have fun. Oh, we're gonna have fun. We're gonna stay here and make nachos And see who can fall asleep the earliest. Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! This is nice. Your hand feels like a pillow that's been in the microwave. Thanks. Okay, well... I'll see you tomorrow. Wait. Oh, it's okay. You can stop. - I was wrong. - What? I thought it was a paparazzo, But it's just some loser taking a picture of his kid. Oh... Right. Of course. That was fake. Did you know "paparazzo" is singular to "paparazzi"? Kimiko taught me that. I'll see you at dawn so you can get caught coming out of my apartment. I'll loan you a shirt. Try to look like you just got drilled. You know the deal. Sir, this computer is not helping with our search. If you type "Nancy's secrets" into the internet, Do you have any idea what comes up? A store that sells wig extensions. I've seen all this before, Kenneth. The separate beds, the empty closets, The brave public face. This is just another Irish Catholic couple Who won't admit to the world that their marriage is over. Sir, you don't know that. They're on vacation together right now. Are they? Nancy Donovan, still so organized. In German class, Mr. Kruger always chose her To sort the students. He was eventually arrested by Israeli commandos. Hmm. Look. On the 30th she took flight 1470 to RSW. He left the next day for CVG. They have to be different cities. Uh, Fort Myers and Cincinnati. Did you not learn your nation's airport codes in high school? She's at the beach house alone! That's the most divorced sentence I've ever heard. Mr. Donaghy, this snooping has to stop. We came here to erase... oh! I just took a picture of both of us. Good morning. Is that glitter? Oh, my god, did you go out last night After I won the sleeping contest? I forgot to wash my face, didn't I? I meant to do it at the club, But when I got into the bathroom, Everything started up again. Okay, that's it, I am taking you To the Port Authority. To get on a bus home, not to meet people! God! Look, you've had your fun. You've seen New York. You've made some really neat friends. Maybe that's enough for a first step. Okay? Yeah. Okay, you're right. But I'm not going home Until I give my cool cousin a makeover! i - Is it gonna be fierce? It would be if it was 2006. Well, I do have this one cardigan That I've been kind of afraid to wear. Well, let's see it, girl. I'm not going back to Methenburg! Randy Lemon, you open this door right now! Okay, I do appreciate the irony That I'm the one stuck in the closet now. - Is that irony? - Not really. The sun is up and we are still in these people's home. God can see us now. We have to find that voice mail code. It's on the dry-erase board above the phone. What? I saw it there a few hours ago. But I wasn't done looking around. I'm ready to hear the message now. Sir, I don't mean to swear, But I am irritated right now. 5-5-2-8-7. Thursday, December 30... Thursday. Friday, January 1st. 3:42 a.m. Meine liebe, Gretta, It's Klaus. Remember Mr. Kruger's German class? I took it to be with you. Sat behind you so I could talk to you And try to see the top of your underwear. You were Gretta and I was Klaus-- Jack, are you coming in? I'm on the phone! Get back in the hot tub. Ballard, don't let them put their tops back on. I'm going to say good night With help from the poet Rilke. Because only German can capture What seeing you again has made me feel. Aus unendlichen sehnsuchten Steigen endliche taten wie schwache fontanen. Auf wiedersehen, Gretta. To erase, press seven. To save, press nine. For more options, press four. Sir, what are you doing? Erase it. I don't know. I thought I wanted a clean break, But if that message is how I really feel, Maybe she was supposed to hear it. Her marriage is falling apart. We meet again after all these years. Message deleted. Next message. Mr. Donaghy, whatever's happening here, It is not your place to interfere. If Mrs. Dougherty wanted you in her life, She would have called, given you some sign. But she hasn't. Let it go, sir. You're right, Kenneth. But you are leaving through the doggy door. Yes, sir. Hey, Liz, we're playing the Today Show drinking game. You do a shot every time they give a dumb travel tip. I like to take the shampoo And put it in the little travel-size bottles. Then I take the original bottle And put it back in the shower... For later. All: Yeah. Great. Liz, relationship emergency. Why are you wearing a man's shirt and no pants? Last night, James kissed me. And for a second, I forgot it was fake. And it was incredible. Now having lunch with James and the actress who plays my mom Somehow seems hollow. What's wrong with me? Jenna, what you're feeling is good. This thing with James is fun and exciting, But it isn't real. Deep down I think you want to be With someone you really love, And who can love you back. More friends on the plaza this morning. - Hi, guys. You celebrating? - We're in love! Trent's quitting the navy, and we're going to get married In Massachusetts. Wow. Congratulations. Oh, boy. If you want to save money on the trip, Consider taking a sandwich. Give 'em a hand. All: Yeah. Hey, baby, you new here? - Yeah, this is my first show. - Uh-huh. And before you worked here, were you an ass scientist? Because your ass... Blah, blah, blah. You get the point. - So what's your name? - Virginia. Virginia? But that's gonna be my daughter's name. - Are you also someone's daughter? - Uh, yeah. Is every woman someone's daughter? - Of course. - Uh-oh! No... way. I was wrong, sir. There is a sign. She's been thinking about you for years! Why can't you be more like Kenneth? Go on. Her code... 5-5-2-8-7. Do you know what it means? Well, it's not a date. The first numbers are too high. It's not the numbers, sir. It's the letters. They spell "Klaus." Your name in German class. The class you were in with Nancy... In high school. - Back in Massachu... - I get it, Kenneth! I'm just trying to figure out my next move. I have to play it cool. You should buy a leather jacket! Get Cerie in here. Not you. Pack your stuff. You know, I don't think this is about you protecting me. I think you have a problem with people enjoying themselves. Why did you even leave White Haven, Liz? When was the last time you watched the sun rise? Sometimes at work... - Or kissed a boy you just met? - Gross. Or went dancing? I'm not going home Until I make you appreciate living here. Tonight we are gonna do that makeover for real. And then I'm taking you out. Yeah, okay. Fine. I mean, who am I to tell Jenna That she doesn't know how to be happy - When I can't even figure out, - Stop. So bored. Did I do that right? Yeah. That was super bitchy. You can't just break up with me. I'll sue you for breach of contract! Oh, you're being such a non-pillow right now! But don't you understand? I just want something real in my life for once. I want what you have with Kimiko. Oh, Kimiko-tan... What am I doing, Jenna? Pretending to be something I'm not. Making myself miserable when I've got happiness Waiting for me at home. Unless Kimiko's jealous of the ottoman. There's nothing going on there. That's a business relationship. Don't Lemon your life, James. Be happy. I'm the actor James Franco, damn it! And I'm in love with and common-law married to a Japanese body pillow! And I hope you had a good New Year's. Let me know the next time you and Mark are in New York, And we'll all grab dinner. Auf wiedersehen. Liz. - James. - Wow. You look great. Is Jenna here? No, Jenna and I broke up, actually. We both decided it was time to be happy. Me too. I'm saying yes to life! Okay. Let's do this. Hey, you got home late. Yeah, I, um... Randy, this is James Franco And our friend Kimiko-Tan. Hey, Randy. I'm gonna go to the bus station. I think that's for the best. I blame you three for my unhealthy attitude towards women! You have created an atmosphere of hostility and intolerance that everyone talks about all the time. Griz, when is the last time you told your fiance you loved her since the phone call I interrupted to make this announcement? Kenneth, your haircut is disrespectful to lesbians! Dotcom, do you ever read books by women? But George Eliot was a woman. Enough! I've made a decision. And starting next week, I'm adding a woman To the entourage. Really? My name is Nao Kanzaki. "Nicknamed "Naive Nao" due to my innate trust in people"." Excuse me. Can you spare some bus fare? I seem to have misplaced my wallet. Why sure! "Write your address so I can pay you back." It's a con. "How obvious! She's really gullible." So who would've thought... "I'd get involved in a ghastly liar's game?" "lt all began when I found a million dollars at my door." "l had been roped into playing of ruthless swindle game." "Winners got filthy rich, while losers drowned in debt. " "l survived with the help of a master con man, Shinichi Akiyama." "When I reached the semi-finals, I was allowed out." "But the finals offered a chance to destroy this sadistic game." "So I put everything in Akiyama's capable hands." Little did I know... that my battle... was just beginning. Hi. Tanimura-san! One of our finalists has dropped out. "You've earned the right to fill that slot." I'd only be in Akiyama-san's way. Don't give me that! "Without you... he will lose for sure." How do you know that? "Because this time, the game can be won... through trust." "You and I both know he isn't capable of that." What can I do? Save him. Only you can. He trusts you and you alone. "lf what he said was true about Akiyama..." then I had to go. "Beyond this door... awaits the final stage." "Garden Of Eden." Your brander. "Each player gets one, and an alphabet lD." You are player H. You may enter. "Mai" "lgarashi" "Momose" "Kuji" "Sendou" "Yukina" Nao! Fukunaga! "Fukunaga" "Thank God. I feel less anxious knowing someone." Guess who else? Eto-san? "Eto" At your service! "You're Nao? You met my brother in the 4th Round." I did? "Nishida" Akiyama-san. Who're you mailing? No one. "We got lucky with Yokoya dropping out." It let us bring Nao back. "Let us now begin the final stage of the Liar Game." "l am Kelbim. I will be your host." "By now, you have all become seasoned veterans of this game." "But today, we don't expect to collect any debts." Why not? Because in today's game... "The game you will all be partaking in is called..." "Garden of Eden." "And so it begins, the last round of lies and backstabbing." "As you know, the name comes from the Bible's Book of Genesis." "ln the center of Eden stood the Tree of Knowledge." "God forbade the eating of its fruit." "Yet Adam and Eve fell prey to temptation." And ate the forbidden fruit. For that... God banished them from paradise. "Likewise, if all of you can resist that same temptation..." you will reap a fortune in reward. We will now conduct a rehearsal. "This is the voting room, which you will enter one at a time..." and cast your votes with apples. "You are to choose from gold, silver or red apples." Are these...? "Indeed, made of real gold and silver." Extravagant final. And this? "The red apples will be explained shortly." "But this game can be played with just gold and silver." What do I do with this? "Return it to the tray... or burn it." I'll switch to gold. "Then you must brand your chosen apple with your name." "Nao Kanzaki" "Finally, you are to deposit the apple in the voting box." You will repeat this 1 3 times. "The votes will be automatically tabulated." Here are the results. "Those who cast silver apples win the round." Majority wins. "lf a player casts two apples with the same name..." only the first vote will count. "Moreover, you are forbidden by contract to force another's vote." You have 1 hour for each round. "But once all votes are in, that round is finished." "Any player who fails to cast a vote in time..." is penalized a million dollars. "Once you've voted, you cannot return until the next round." "Each player in the majority after each vote..." will earn a million dollars. "Players in the minority after each vote..." will lose a million dollars. "lf however everybody casts the same vote..." everyone loses a million dollars. "l thought you said we could all win." "These rules create clear winners and losers." Precisely. "The gold and silver are forbidden fruit, and must not be cast." What? "lnstead, you are to cast the Red Apple of Truth." Red Apple of Truth? "The red apples play the most important role in this game." "lf all 1 1 of you cast a red apple, you each win a million dollars." Serious? "lf we continue to vote red, we each win 1 3 million." However... "if anyone casts a forbidden fruit after red votes have been cast..." "those casting a red apple with lose a million dollars." "And both gold and silver voters will earn a million dollars." "Moreover, a single vote using a forbidden fruit..." earns a special bonus of 2 million. "What you must be most careful to avoid..." "is being the only one to cast a red apple." "That player's name will be revealed..." "and incur a penalty of 1 0 million dollars." 1 0 million? And finally... "anyone exceeding 5 million in debts must leave paradise..." and be banished from Eden. Banished? "lf, however, another player elects to cover that debt..." then play continues. "Ha! Who here would cover for another's 5 million?" This is the final stage. "Each player starts with their accumulated earnings so far." "The money leader so far at 1 2 million..." is Player A. Who's that? "Those with a positive balance at the end will retain that as prize money." "A negative balance will translate into actual debt." "The money leader at the end will be crowned champion." And will take home... 50 million dollars. 50 million! "Should the game be halted due to rule infringements..." this money is rescinded. "And the game will end with every player penalized 10 million." "To prevent multiple players from conspiring to split the 50 million..." "earnings among players cannot change hands after the game." Now my friends... "go cast the Red Apple of Truth as often as you can." "Why are we standing still? Let's vote red." I know why! Listen up, everyone! "Till now, the goal's been to take money from each other." But not this time. Our dealings are with the "house". "That's who we're playing against, not each other." So let's all cast red apples. "We can beat the house and all its traps if we pull together." I'm in. I'll cast red. Really? "Me, too. Let's end by sticking it to "them"." Thank you! "We all stand to gain over 143 million." Can't catch Player A, anyway. And it would be a sure thing. " - I'm with Nao! - Me, too!" "I've fought all this way with Nao." I know she can be trusted. Let's follow Nao's lead! Thanks, everyone. Let's do it! "Victory for Nao! Victory for all!" It was the perfect start. "All 1 1 of us uniting around a common goal." You're the last one, Akiyama-san. What? Let me borrow this. Lip gloss. You toying with me? This is so strange. "I've never felt so at peace playing this game." "I've convinced myself of something since arriving here." "That we've fought all this way in order to come together." "To show that, ultimately, we must believe in each other." I agree. You do? All votes have been cast. Here are the results. "1 st Vote Results" Gold... 3. Silver... 4. Red... 4. "Players casting gold and silver apples win." Interesting. The second vote begins now. Suckers, suckers! You know what, Nao? You really, really are... naive! Fukunaga. Me, vote red? Why not? "You'd earn the same million either way." Not true! "There's no risk of losing a million this way." "And I knew others would shoot for 50 mil." "The only way to win is to betray before you're betrayed!" "Say what? You're rotten to the core." Stop it! Have faith and vote red! No way, Nao. Nobody will vote red now. Right, guys? " - You're scum. - Unbelievable." Traitor. "Don't give me that! 6 others did it, too!" Don't play innocent! I voted red. " - Me, too. - Me, too." "Liars! See if I trust any of you!" The feeling's mutual. What? I pity you. Screw you, you crooked hag! Who you calling a hag? You didn't vote red, either! Who says? Please stop! This is exactly where "they" want us. What's done is done. "l say we give unity another chance, and vote red." Igarashi-san... I was thinking the same thing! Well, all right! "They're right! We can do this!" Count me out. Don't be a spoil sport! "Think about it. Those who voted red are already down a mil." You telling them to do that again? There were 7 traitors. Yeah, but... "Anyone asking for a red vote is either one of the traitors..." I'm stupidly naive! I guarantee... we will never get all reds. That leaves only one path: deception. No! Nao. "It's sad, but he's right. Forget it." I won't! "It's okay. I promise the chance will come again." Let's work toward that. Mai... "Human weakness... and greed." That's the essence of the game. That's why a unanimous red vote... has never happened. Nao? Buzz off, mushroom. I'm sorry I betrayed you. "But there's another way to get everyone to vote red." Yukina, Kuji. "Get Akiyama and we'll have a team of 6." Team? "It's now a battle for majority between gold and silver." So we build a 6-person majority. "The only way to lose is for all of us to vote the same." This guarantees victory. But then only some of us can win. "Don't worry. We don't want that." "Sooner or later, our team effort will be discovered." "We can even let them know. Then what?" They'll ask to join our team. "And we'll welcome the other five with open arms." Welcome friends! "Condition's will be ripe for another go at unity." "It's a prelude to us casting all red apples." It's not just for us. That's great, Fukunaga! "You're not going to believe him, are you?" He just betrayed you. "We've fought together a long time. Trust me." Nao. It may be our only hope. Suit yourself. "I'd rather act alone than side with him." Mai! "Leave her. If this works..." she'll be back, too. But... Yes, I betrayed you... I'm sorry. "But at least I was honest about it. Want to know why?" "To strengthen your guard! Or you'll be tricked repeatedly." "But it's okay now. We can still get all reds." "Don't give up. We'll do it together." Okay. I'll believe you, Fukunaga. Thanks. "I'll go find another person we can trust." Okay. He's a good fellow. "Fukunaga always ends up being a pretty trustworthy ally." Ally, huh? Yes. Here he is. Thanks for having me. I was at a loss by myself. Okay, let's get a majority. Our first vote is... gold. I'll vote next. Wait. Let me go. "All the votes are in. Here are the results." Think we'll win? "Yes. Could be what we need to come together." Could be what we need... to come together. Don't make me laugh! Mai? You thought you were the only team? Fools. We had a team, too. So what? We outnumber you. That's right. Six against five. Count again. Fukunaga. You're kidding. The joke's on you! Nao's a pushover. You think you know me, but you don't. I've done bad things. You should run. Now. I can make my own decisions. I'm 17. I have to show you something. Okay. - I knew it. - Are you scared? - No. - You should be. I'm just scared I'm dreaming and I'll wake up in math class. Is it gonna hurt? I could never hurt you. Come with me. - Where? - Let me show you my world. Edgy. So your place, is there gonna be velvet? Yeah, sure. This is it? But it smells like pee. Nice work, Robbie. Robert. What's happening? This is what you wanted, isn't it? Hey. So I'm actually not far. I'm about a night's drive. Yeah? So you think...? There's some stuff I gotta do first. - Of course. - But I was thinking that I'll wrap up here and, you know, make sure I'm not followed. I'll take side streets, come at night. Will you just shut up and get your ass home? I can't wait to see you. - This phone thing's getting old. - Yeah. Well, call us when you're close. And be careful. Of course. Hey. - What are you so stoked about? - What? Nothing. What do you got? Six girls in seven days. More disappearances than this city has seen in over a year. - All about the same age and- - And cute. Ice cream comes in lots of flavors. Sure. Well, half a dozen girls, late teens, a shower away from greatness. It sounds like a profile. - I wonder what else they got in common. - Well, six directions to go here. - Pick a number. - Seven. Another call just came in today. Kristen's a good kid. A little naive, sure. You try and be a good parent. Girls are hard. Right. We'd just like to find your daughter. - Last door on the left. - Thanks. What do you think he was talking about? Drugs? Oh, it is so much worse. Vampires? No, these aren't vampires, man. These... - These are douchebags. - Yeah. Wow. Hm. A- ha. All right. Let's see what we can see. All right. That's just uncomfortable. What is he so bummed out about? Look at this. He's watching her sleep. How is that not rapey? I gotta concentrate, Dean. "He could hear the blood rushing inside her, almost taste it. He tried desperately to control himself. Romero knew their love was impossible. " - Romero? Really? - Dean, shut up. This is a national bestseller. How is that possible? Hey, try "Lautner. " Wait, he's a werewolf. How do you even know who that is? You kidding me? That kid's everywhere. It's a freaking nightmare. Hey, how many T's are there in Pattins-? That's it. We're in. Ha. All right. Well? Well, her inbox is full from some guy claiming to be a vampire. A real vampire? Well... "I can only meet you at night. I don't trust myself with you. The call of your blood is too strong. " Vampires phishing for victims? It's probably just a human mouthbreather, right? On the other hand, talk about easy prey. - For actual vamps? - Yeah. These chicks throw themselves at you. All you gotta do is, I don't know, write bad poetry. Huh. Well, this guy wanted to meet her at a place called The Black Rose. - Give me a break. - Just reporting the news. This is probably just your standard-issue perv, right? DRIVER: Stop! Let me go! Okay, so now you're sure it's vampires? A hundred percent? Definitely. We got a pattern now. Kids go missing, blood bank van gets jumped. This is the fourth town. Clincher is, this last hit driver was found, throat ripped out. Okay. They grab kids. That's food, right? But if they already got a bunch of walking, talking juice bars why bother with the blood mobile? Doesn't add up. Find the nest. Figure it out. Well, you wanted emo chicks, I think we hit ground zero. Thank you. You think she wears all that rubber to the beach? When was the last time we had a beer together anyway? There. What do you think? He's hitting on her hard enough. Real? Well, it's hard to tell. And we got multiple choice. Yeah. Go call. Great. Three of them, two of us. Okay. Make that two of them. - Come with me. - One's on the move. All right. You go with Efron, I got Bieber. Are you sure, baby? Are you ready to join me in eternity? Oh, my God, totally. Hey! - Go. Get out of here. What the-? What the hell are you doing? Open your mouth! Take those out. Take them out. Ugh. For the love of- What, are you 12? - Are you wearing glitter? - I only do it to get laid, man. Does it work? I'll be damned. All right, "MMMBop" your way out of here. Go, go. And use a condom. You're pretty. I'm sorry? I said you're pretty. Yeah, sorry again, pal. I don't play for your team. No! Sammy. Oh, my God, what is that sound? What sound, Dean? Hey, come on. Keep it down, damn it. Please, please, shut that off. Jeez. - Dean, you should sit down. - You sit down. Of all the ways to die, never thought I'd be going out like this. Dean, nobody is going out. What? Samuel will kill me when he gets here. - He's not. - Because I'm gonna ask him to... - ... because you won't do it. - Hold on a second. - For what? Look. - We can figure this out. How? - Why aren't you freaked out? - Of course I am. Really? Because I can hear your heartbeat, and it's pretty damn steady. That's because I'm trying to remain calm. Dean, look, Samuel will know what to do. Come on, man, I'm a monster. Okay? This is not a problem that you spitball. We gotta deal with this before I hurt somebody. How's it feel? Now? - Now you wanna talk about my feelings? - No, I mean physically. How do you think it feels? Not good. - Where you going? - Bathroom, okay? News flash, Mr. Wizard. Vampires pee. Dean? Dean. Hey. Hey, I wasn't expecting you for a couple of days. Yeah, yeah. I wanted to see you. What's up? - Are you okay? - Listen. - What's going on? - It doesn't matter but I need you to know. You and Ben. Just thanks. Okay? For everything. Dean, you're scaring me. Oh, God, I'm Pattinson. - What? - Nothing. I've gotta go. No. You can't just show up like this and then- Wish it was different. Stop and explain to me what's going on out there. I can't bring this crap home to you. - You're talking about your work? - I'm talking about my life. It's ugly and it's violent and I'm gonna die, soon. Just tell me what the hell is going on. - Dean? - I gotta go. - Dean? - Ben, just stay there. - I thought I heard you- - I said stay back! You can't keep track of your brother now? - Well, I didn't think he'd just- - He's not himself, Sam. He's a monster and he's hungry. We gotta prepare to do the right thing. I told you he'd kill me when he showed up. Did you feed? I went to say goodbye to Lisa... - ... which, for the record, was a lousy idea. - Answer the question. You can relax. I didn't drink anyone. - Thank God. - But I came close. All right. Do it. Okay, if you insist. Or I can just turn you back. - What? - What? I didn't drive all this way to kill you, Dean. I'm here to save you. That's my grandfather's journal. The cure's an old Campbell recipe, kind of like the soup. No one's tried it since God knows. From what I hear, the stuff is a bad trip. - Awesome. - Hey, the cure is good. But a lot of this is on you. You drink, you're done. It won't work. - I'm talking one drop of human blood. - I got it. Do you? Because you will feed. It's a matter of time. What else do we need? Some stuff we got, some we gotta get. The trickiest thing, blood of the fang who turned you. That guy was huge. Nothing in the recipe about easy. I can get it. You gonna walk right into the nest? Well, I'm one of them, aren't I? So all I gotta do is get in there, get the guy alone and shoot him with so much dead man's blood. - I should come with you. - No. Dude, you reek. You're like a walking hamburger. I gotta do this solo. Yeah, except we haven't been able to find them yet. No problem. I can smell them. They're two miles east of town. You guys get the other crap and meet me there. Dean. It's dead man's blood. Now, there's enough there to drop a linebacker and then some. Good luck, son. What the hell's wrong with you, Sam? - What do you mean? - You knew about the cure. What? No, I didn't. We talked about it months ago. Not me. It must have been Christian or something. Huh. Because if you had known, it'd be almost like you let him get turned. Get a man on the inside, help us find that alpha vamp we been looking for. You serious? Think I'd do that, risk my own brother? What's wrong with you? Look, I'm just relieved we can fix him. - What's up? - Hey. I'm- The guy Boris turned outside the bar, right? - He said to look out for you. - Yeah. Well, glad you made it, man. Oh. Follow me. So you must be starving. Uh... Here you go. I'm okay. I killed so many people on the way over here, so... Yeah, about that... But you gotta tell me what that's like. Yeah. Yeah, first chance I get, I'll show you myself. Sweet. Don't worry about them. They're jealous. The recruiters get to bang all the chicks. That's you now, bro. - The recruiters? - Yeah. Big man will explain. Be with you in a minute. "Your skin is the black velvet of the night. " Nice. That stupid bitch will eat that up. She'll be dying to meet. Go get yourself some blood, sweetheart. Then march that little ass right back here, okay? Thank goodness. I thought the hunter chopped your pretty head. No, I got away. - Sorry, what's a hunter? - You'll see if he finds us. You'll see him inside out. - You eaten? - Yeah. Good. You'll need your strength. For...? Robert didn't tell you? How old do I look? Thirty-three? You're off by about six centuries. And these are the best days in the last 600 years to be a vampire. Dracula, Anne Rice? Please. These brats are so horny they've reinvented us as Prince Charming with a Volvo. They want a promise ring with fangs so I give it to them. You. You go out and you get them, and you bring them home to me. - So, what's with the cages? - Oh, that's just, you know till they're compliant. Eventually these girls will fetch me boys like you and around and around we go. I gotta say, I'm impressed. This whole system, that's all you? No, no, no. No. I just implement, you know? Make sure that you all fall in line. It's his. Our father's. Your father's? Aren't you the curious one? Oh, you don't know the half of it. In due time. You... You want the private tour, don't you? Thought you'd never ask. You playing games with me, boy? Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Go get him! This must be the place. Shh. So much for undercover. Let's go. You've stopped nothing. You know that? This is much bigger than you and me. Looks like your brother has some Campbell in him after all. Dean, you okay? Yeah, I'm good. If this works, it's not gonna be a kiddie ride. That's great. Light her up. - So, what'd you see in there? - What? - In the nest. What'd you see? - I can't hear you. Your blood is so freaking loud. Just back off. All right, give me the damn cure. L'chaim. I don't think it- - Is it working? - Either that or he's dying. Hi. So, what'd you see? - What? - In the nest, what'd you see? I'm still working through it but they're not figuring out anything on their own. They're getting their orders from the top. Where to go next, everything. - The top as in... - Their alpha. That's what I think it is. They've got some sort of psychic thing happening. He sends them, I don't know, messages. Saying what? Honestly? Recruitment drive. Their alpha's building an army. - Well, that's comforting. - This is not the worst. Then what is? We don't scare them anymore. You've reached Lisa. Leave me a message. Thanks. Hey, Lis. To continue recording, press one. To erase- How'd it go with Lisa? - It didn't. - I'm sorry. Yeah. At least you got my back. No matter what happens, I can always count on you. Right, Sammy? Yeah. Of course, Dean. [English - US] You turned me. Hate those fangs. You bit me in the neck. The bite doesn't matter. You have to actually ingest the blood to be infected. That was vampire blood he dosed you with. What? Lights are too bright? Sunshine hurt your skin? I get so hungry. What have you been doing? Hunting, with some other people. You? Working with strangers? More like family. I'm your grandfather. Stick around, I'll show you tricks your daddy never even dreamed of. I... I can't just lose you and Ben. Me and Ben will be here, and... you come when you can. Just come in one piece. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm great. 'Cause there's been a few times that you've got me wondering. It's Sam, Bobby. He's just... he's different. Something's not right to me. You came. I told you I would. Shall we sit? I can't tell you that. Too embarrassing. Come on. Nothing you could ever say would... I mean, those poems you posted? They revealed who you really are. I know you, Kristen. Thanks. I actually, um... wrote one today. You want to...? Of course I do. Ow. Damn it. Paper cut. Hi, clumsiest person ever. I have to go. Wait! Hi. Hi. I shouldn't be here. So why are you? I can't stop thinking about you. Then... don't. We can't do this. We can't be together. - There has to be a way. - No. You think you know me... but you don't. I've done bad things. You should run. Now. I can make my own decisions. I'm 17. I have to show you something. Okay. I knew it. - Are you scared? - No. You should be. I'm just scared... I'm dreaming and I'll wake up in math class. Is it gonna hurt? I could never hurt you. Come with me. Where? Let me show you my world. Edgy. So, your place... is there gonna be... velvet? Yeah, sure. This is it? But... it smells like pee. Nice work, Robbie. Robert, what's happening? This is what you wanted, isn't it? Season 6 Episode 5 "Live Free or Twihard" Hey. So, uh, I'm actually not far. I'm about a night's drive. Yeah? So, you think... Well, there's some stuff I got to do here first. Of course. But I was thinking that, uh, I'll wrap up here and you know, make sure I'm not followed. I'll have to take side streets and I'd have to come at night... Will you just shut up and get your ass home? I can't wait to see you. This phone thing's getting old. Yeah.

Six girls in seven days, which is more disappearances than this city has seen in over a year. All about the same age. And cute. Hey, ice cream comes in lots of flavors, Sam. Gotcha.

I could never hurt you. Come with me. - Where? - Let me show you my world. So, your place... Is there gonna be velvet? Sure. This is it? It smells like as they face the end of their season. The Eagles, however, have a little farther to fly. All right, what kind of sick are we talking about? I don't know. I've just felt really nauseous the last two mornings. - And then I feel fine again. - You haven't eaten anything weird? Not unless fruit and cereal's weird. Brooke, my gut says make an appointment with the doctor. I've been there three times this year. It's getting embarrassing. I'm just telling you what I would do. You can even use my car. With five seconds left, the score still stands in Oakhaven's favor 17 to 14 over the Eagles. Grant Taylor calls the play in to Zach Avery who pulls the huddle together for their last shot at going to state. It's third down and goal for the Eagles and the crowd is going crazy. They line up in an I formation. This is do or die for the Eagles. Zach takes the snap and will give it to Jacob Hall for- - No, it's a fake. He's got Nathan Markle open in the corner. The pass is up. He's got it. Touchdown Eagles. Touchdown Eagles. Zach Avery completely faked out the defense and made a perfect pass to win the game 20 to 17. Can you believe this? The Shiloh Eagles are actually headed to the state championship. A team with only 32 players has made it to the big dance. Oh, my. On the eve of the GISA football state championship the Richland Giants prepare to defend their reign as lords of the gridiron. It's no surprise they've returned for this game. What is surprising is who they're playing. The Shiloh Eagles who started the season oh and three, have come out of nowhere and through a bizarre set of circumstances now face a team almost three times their size. Sleep at all last night? Are you nervous? It's a weird emotion. Part of me thinks we're gonna get crushed tonight part of me thinks God may do something awesome. Sounds like your fear's about to clobber your faith. Something like that. When are you going out there? I might leave early, if that's all right. Just don't worry about me. I'll just meet you at the game. Okay. Either way, you're still playing for a state championship. Juice. There's some juice. Do you see that? This is? - Apple. - Apple. Good. - Where's the duck? - Duck. - Zebra. - Zebra. Zebra. Cat. Duck. There's the pig. Brooke Taylor's here again. Maybe she'll be pregnant this time. I hope so. - You ready, son? - I can't find my cleats. They're right here by the door. Thanks. You realize you're playing for the state championship tonight? I don't know why I'm so nervous. I'm not even gonna play. You know I'm proud of you, don't you? Yes, sir. Don't ever doubt it. Whether you play or not... - ... I'll be right there praying for you. - Thanks, Dad. Let's go pick a fight with some giants. Here's the results for B Taylor. Oh, I'll take that. - Negative? - Yes. I will still love you, Lord. I will still love you. All right, God. You got us here. Whatever happens, may you get the glory. - Coach, what are you doing here? - You're at the state championship. Any time a former player gets this far, you know I'd be there. - It blows me away. - Well, how you feeling? A little bit nervous. This championship, it's kind of surreal for me. I promise you, I don't care what level of ball you're coaching it's surreal when you make it to the championship game. And Grant, I can tell you, I'm so proud of you and what you've done. I've been reading about the team and where you've gone. And I'm just proud of the fact that you finally learned how to win the big one. - We haven't played them yet. - You won when you accepted Christ. Now, as you're teaching these guys and minister to them I think it's just fantastic. I got it. These players got it. Well, I can promise you, win or lose this game, you guys are champions. - I appreciate that. - But while you're here you might as well win it, huh? I'm gonna try my best. You know, this team we're playing, they're huge. They're fast, they're strong. I just don't want my players to be afraid. Well, in God's word, he said 365 different times, "Do not fear. " If he says it that many times, you know he's serious about it, don't you? I would guess so. I needed to hear that. Well, look, you're gonna do great tonight. I know you're busy. - I'm gonna go and cheer you on. - Good to see you. - All right. God bless you, man. - Thanks, coach. In about five minutes we head out for the warm-up. I wanna say two things. Number one, I love you and I'm proud of you. I wouldn't trade this season for anything in the world. Secondly, you're about to play the biggest team you've ever faced. They're strong, fast and undefeated. So far. But I want you to remember where God has brought us. I want you to remember how hard you've worked. We weren't supposed to have a winning season, but we do. We weren't supposed to advance through the playoffs, but we did. We're not supposed to be here, but we are. So if anything in you says this is a losing effort, throw it out. Because as I stand here, I believe that as long as we honor God nothing is impossible. Nothing. Leave everything out on the field. Give your best to God tonight. Whether we leave the field the victors or not, we will give God the glory. Now who will go fight the Giants with me? You've gotta be kidding me. The Giants elect to receive after the coin toss. We're just seconds away from the state championship game. Dale, it is impressive that Shiloh has made it this far but the field tonight really looks lopsided. It definitely does. I'm looking at 85 players on the Richland sidelines as opposed to 32 for Shiloh. Even if the Eagles had great talent, they can't bring in fresh players. That's really gonna hurt in the second half. All right. Let's go, Joshua. The Eagles kick it off and the state championship game is underway. Jerod House will receive the kick and he'll head down the field. He gets a couple blocks and breaks outside. He's got daylight. But the Eagles will take him down around the 50-yard line. That's where the Giants will set up shop. First down and in good field position to start this state championship game. Get up there. Brock, watch them up the middle. Come on. Let's go, boys. Wes Porter will call the play for the Giants. He steps back to pass. He's got Damien Fuller streaking down the sideline. He lets it fly. Fuller will take the pass in, he will race into the end zone untouched. And the Giants strike early here in the game with the first score. Welcome to state-championship football. Hey, man, this is a whole new level. They are quick off the line. We've gotta stay back. The Eagles will start this drive at the 19-yard line. Zach Avery drops back to pass and he passes to Jeremy Johnson. But the pass is batted down by the Giants. That's right. That's the way we do it. Avery hands it to Jacob Hall, who tries to run up but he gets absolutely nowhere as he is swamped by defenders. Ten, 10, hit, hit. Eagles look to pass. Here come the Giants. They're gonna get the sack. That's gonna force the Eagles into a punting situation on fourth down. Baby, ain't that pretty? Jerod House will receive the kick and he'll head down the field. He breaks outside. He's got some daylight. Okay. All right, time- - Ref, timeout. After gaining eight yards, the Eagles give up another sack. They're gonna have to punt it away on fourth down. Dale, so far it's been all Richland. - I should not have called that play. - They're all over us. Nobody's open. - They're knocking us around. - They're getting cocky. We cannot let them play their game. Defense, blitz on first down. We've gotta get them off their rhythm. Let's go. No. Field-goal unit. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Good job. Good job. Keep it up. What universe are you in? Get in the game. So with a few seconds left in the first half the Giants were gonna take a three-touchdown lead but after an Eagles interception, we've got a 14 to 7 football game. We can't keep running our normal plays. Their defense is killing us. I agree. We cannot outmuscle them and we cannot outrun them. We've gotta outsmart them. - Trick plays? - Just enough to keep them guessing. You see another way? You just can't use them too often, though. - They catch on, we toast. - We're toast if we don't put points on that board. We gotta make it through the fourth. And they got a deep bench. We're still in the game. Good job on the defense getting us on the board. I believe they thought this would be a shutout. We're gonna keep surprising them. You've figured out they've got power and speed, they're big but they're also predictable. We have gotta stay together. We can't outrun them, but we can outsmart them. With the Giants leading 14 to 7, we get set to bring you the second half of this championship game. And unless the Eagles find a way to solve Richland's size and strength the Giants could very well be taking home their fourth state title tonight. Make it work, Zach. The Eagles come out with a little trickery. And they're just about to tie this football game. Hustle, hustle. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Make them pay, boys. Make them pay. Come on. That was dirty. He's hurt. He's hurt. He's hurt. Joshua Webster's being helped off the field with what we have been told is a broken collarbone. That came after a late hit by the Giants after the Eagles tied the game. - Stupid. That was dirty. - Calm down. This is a new ball game. Joshua's gonna be all right. David, come here. You gotta cover for Joshua now. - I need 110 percent. - All right, coach. Be the man. Kickoff team. Let's go. After a long drive, the Giants score. The Eagles prevent the conversion leaving this a 20 to 14 football game. Why are they on the scoreboard? They shouldn't even be in this game. For the rest of your life, you will remember today. I want you to remember you held nothing back, you did not lose heart you did not stop fighting, you did not quit. They're like little dogs nipping at your heels. Now get out there and stomp them. That's what I'm talking about. That's my defense. Let's go, Eagles. He's going for a bomb. Let's go. He's going for a bomb. Don't get beat. Go. The Eagles have shown the determination of a school twice their size. The Giants will now attempt a 35-yard field goal to extend their lead. That is the last time we go for a field goal. We should be in the end zone every stinking time. Double flex wall. Double flex wall. And hit. Go. Go. Go. What are you doing? Field-goal unit. Go. Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. - Good job. All right. That's my team. Coach, I need a rest. I can't go much more. I need you on that field. You have gotta stay in the game. I need you. Yes, sir. David Childers is in to kick for Joshua Webster. We understand this is his first season. He's gone three for four this season. Looking at the stats, he's been limited to short-range kicks. Come on, David. You got this. Yeah. Timeout, ref. Ref, timeout. Coach, I'm done. Someone else has gotta lead. Brock, this is when it matters most. I know you're tired. It's easy to lead when you're strong. But now is when you lead us, right now. Can you give me four more downs? I just need four more downs. Four more. All right, come here. Come here. This is our time and you've got to put the nails in the coffin. Look at me. We didn't fight this far to give up in the last quarter. Leave everything on the field. And field goals, they're not an option. I need you for four more downs. Who's with me? Now get out there and get it done. With less than two minutes left, the Giants stand on the verge of their fourth-straight consecutive state title. A tired Eagles team lines up to face them yet again. Stone wall. Stone wall. Yes. Stone wall. - Stone wall. - Stone wall. Stone wall. Stone wall. The Giants line up first and goal. This score will solidify the championship. Hand the- - No, wait a minute. He is stopped. The Eagles are still in it, showing determination to fight this one out. Three more downs. - Three more. - Yeah. You gotta hang with me. I know it's getting tough. We gotta stop them here. It's second down and goal to go for the Giants. The state title is within their grasp. Both of the stands are on their feet as they get ready to run this play. Wes Porter will take it. No, the Eagles have stopped him again. That's my team. That's my team. Come on. Get it in the end zone. Two more. And here we go again. They're gonna try it again. Wes Porter will take the snap. He's looking to pass into the corner. But the Eagles bat down the pass. The crowd is going nuts right now. The Giants have been kept out of the end zone on three straight plays. Now Bobby Lee Duke will have a big decision to make. - We have gotta go for a field goal. - We are not going for a field goal. He's not kicking it. Brock. Brock. One more down. One more down. It's fourth down and the Giants are going for the touchdown. This crowd is going absolutely berserk right now. They line up at the one-yard line. Wes Porter's gonna take the snap. Brock Kelley's gonna meet him head-on. And there's a fumble. The Eagles have the football. They're taking it down the field. He's at the 40. He's at the 50. He's at the 40. He'll be run out at the 34-yard line. Are you believing this? With two seconds left, the Eagles have got a shot at this football game. - We've got time for a Hail Mary. - The defense is too strong. No, we can't run it. That's our only option. You gotta kick it, man. David. I need a 51 -yard field goal. - I can't kick that far. - They've stopped the pass all night. - You're my best option. - The furthest I've kicked is a 39. There is no way I can kick a 51 -yard field goal. I believe you can. Do the best you can. Leave the results to God. I need you on that field. Field-goal unit. Grant, we've gotta throw it. He can't kick it. It's too far. - No, it's not. - What are you doing? I'm preparing for rain. I don't understand, but with two seconds left the Eagles are putting the game in the hands of a 145-pound backup kicker. This is not a good move. He even has to kick into the wind. David. He's not ready. He don't think he can do it. I don't have any more timeouts. Call a timeout, Bobby Lee. - This kid can't kick that far. - Call that timeout. Call a timeout anyway and let's ice him. David, come here. You're telling yourself you're gonna miss. It's too far. Listen to me. Do you think God could help you make this kick? - Do you believe it, David? - Yeah, if he wants to. So do I. Give him your best and leave the rest up to him. Will you do that for me? Make this field goal or not, we're gonna praise him. But don't you walk off this field having done any less than your best. - Can I help you? - Don't touch me. I'm standing for my son. God, help me make this kick. Kick it now. Kick it now. Hit. The kick is up. It's on its way. It's long enough. It's high enough. Does it have the distance? It does. It's good. It's good. It's good. The Eagles have won the championship. Thank you, God. I can't believe what I've just seen. I cannot believe what I've just seen. A miracle has occurred here tonight. The Shiloh Eagles have defeated the Richland Giants 24 to 23 to take the state title for the first time in their history. It's incredible. It's absolutely unbelievable. You are a state champion. You are a state champion. All right. You guys, who's the state champions? Okay. Okay. I got something to say. David Childers. Don't you ever let anyone tell you that you're under par second-rate or inferior. I just watched God do a miracle through you. I saw a field of Giants, 85 of them to be exact, fall in defeat. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. Zach, I just watched you and the offense do what they said could not be done. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. Brock, how about it? You built that stone wall, didn't you? And it stood. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. - Scott, what's impossible with God? - Nothing. Are you sure? Those Giants are big. They outnumber us three to one. Are you sure there's nothing impossible with God? I'm sure, coach. - Nathan, what's impossible with God? - Nothing, coach. - Jonathan? - Nothing. - Are you positive? - Positive, coach. So am I. So am I. God can do whatever he wants to do, however he wants to do it. And he chooses to work in our lives because he loves us because he's good. Hope today's a milestone for what he can do for the rest of your life if you trust him. Why don't we spend some time thanking him? Well, look who just walked in this house. Couldn't be the state-champion coach Grant Taylor, could it? Because he's not supposed to live here. He's supposed to be out looking for a job. God did it, Brooke. He did it. He gave me this job provided for our needs took away my fear. He throws in the state championship just because he can. It's been one of the best days of my life. - The day's not over yet. - What do you mean? Grant Taylor, I just want you to know that you've made the team. What team? The daddy team. We're gonna have a baby? We're gonna have a baby. You tell me, Coach Taylor tell me what's impossible when God's on your side? Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm overwhelmed. - Miss... - Yeah? - Your bag... - Is it mine? (strong american accent) It's certainly yours! It flew out of the car window right when you... hit the tree. Are you OK? I'm a simple russian girl. Maybe I don't understand something. How could he even suggest anything like that? Did he really think I'd agree to do that with his dog? He must be sick! I must forget him. I love him! I will forget him! I am Anna Markova, Hello. promise that it's all over between us. My answer is "no", Misha. Never! And get your disgusting dog out of here! What fucking dog? I realize that I don't really know you. Who you really are. I'm only an honest russian girl! I loved you! Bitch! Get your dog out of here! Absolute ZERO. Subtitles created by: .:`|~Cricket69~|`:.

Cynthia, i've got to see you about that job... that job for jonas. The security position you mentioned to me months ago. Please call me back at home. I've got to see you. Why are we broke? I'm divorcing mack. You guys threw the net over him good. He's in the unit till they shoot his legs off or he's too old to play with the boys. I'll divorce him... then i'll disappear for a few months. And then we can run into each other. We can meet at some function and we'll date. Things in common, old friends. A few months, maybe a year, we get married. I'll go back to the base as your wife and... why now? That's a very good question. Here's your answer. He's re-upping for another tour, and i won't. And i want to know why my husband is and if he's gonna be at the christmas table. Jonas: I didn't say, "what were you thinking?" I said, "were you thinking?" And i got my answer. I was... gonna tell me before i figured it out. I made a mistake, and i'm fixing it. $40,000! And our friends' money? I got their money back. Did you get our money back? I'll take another job. 4 other jobs won't fix this! If you retire... what? ! The fact the money problems came to light... the fact that the money problems came to light... what does that do to my career? Can't control my wife. Same thing. Can't pay my daughter's tuition. Same thing. But it was my mistake. Your mistake and our burden! Don't you think i know that? ! How do i earn my money? I do not make cornflakes for a living. I earn my money at the risk of my life, out there, letting the scum of the earth shoot at me. You know that's how i make my living. That's why my bosses pay me... and you wish it away. Situation... enemy forces. Razlan dragovich... former yugoslav army general wanted for crimes committed during the balkan civil war. Made a name for himself as an ethnic cleanser. Personally commanded the bosnian serb forces, wiped out the muslim population of one sizable town, went on to obliterate 3 islamic bosnian villages. Mr. Brown. Dragovich continues to command a sizable militia and receives assistance and support from the local government, particularly in the form of intel. Friendly forces. The united nations command consists of a regiment of the french foreign legion commanded by a colonel jean-marc leclerq. Who is one mal hombre in his own comic book. European forces, africa, and the middle east. He's the go-to guy. United nations and nato want to drag dragovich's ass back to the world court at the hague to try him for war crimes. Only problem... it's a greased pig contest. This guy dragovich is a houdini. 2 earlier attempts by u.n. Forces have failed. Dragovich unfortunately is something of a local hero. He receives substantial if tacit government support. Your mission is to assist... seems to me guerilla, too. That they are. To assist the u.n. Forces in the capture of our mr. Dragovich. Mr. Brown. In the event that the assistance is insufficient to bring dragovich out? In such event, you shall effect capture independently with minimum friction. Now our friend leclerq, as you say, is down 0 and 2. He's gonna want to save face, so if you do come in, make sure you give him the win. All right. You've got money troubles, you've got marriage troubles. Yes, i do. And this is gonna wipe 'em both out. Sam gregory is retiring. He's the head of middle eastern operations. Jonas has arabic and farsi. Wait, wait, wait. He is one of 5 guys in the world who can do this job in the world. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. He does not have to come on as a shooter. I promise you, they are gonna offer him this job. He goes from the unit to blackthorne as co-director. In 5 years, his sweat equity will have bought him 8% of the company. In addition to his salary, in 5 years, he's one of the owners. It's a short list. 3 possible candidates. He will call them today. ...you're the young girl who thinks she's gonna have a 20-inch waist for the rest of her life. I told you, i'm not interested in any job as a mercenary. Do you know what you are? You are addicted to poverty. This job? This salary? In 5 years, you can own the company. It will work while you sleep. You don't have to jump out of airplanes. You think you'll be jumping out of when you're 50, 55. The money will work when you can't, and we'll be together, and happy and rich. You ingrate. I kept my side of the bargain. I've seen you through, but you want to stand there... you want to stand there and pout at me and ruin our lives so that you... yes, ruin our lives, so that you can have 6 more years at the prom. Well, i'm glad to have you here, and i'm glad to have your assistance. You up to speed? Yes, sir. Dragovich uses this as a garage. He used to use this building, but it was shot to hell in an earlier attempt to flush him. The new garage is poorly constructed, and its doors are in the back of the compound. The garage doors, not more than 10 feet to a fence, opens wide to allow the vehicles out. Gotta figure they're gonna run, that's the way they'll use. No, this is excellent. However, this mission, as envisioned by the u.n., is, in effect, to knock and serve the warrant. He has no escape. We have an overwhelming superiority of forces, so we will ask him, as a reasonable man, to surrender. And as a reasonable man, i'm sure he shall. Sergeant blane, i know that your assignment is to assist in this mission, but you are much too valuable to be relegated to a supernumerary position, so might i impose on you and ask you to be by my side tomorrow with the plan at the ready? In effect, i want you to be my second in command. Vive la morte, vive la guerre. Vive le sacre legionnaire. Welcome aboard. I'm glad to have you here. The same. J'y serai. "I will be there"... leclerq. Yes, sir. My family arms. Royalty. More like aristocracy. Before napoleon. Oui, mon colonel. Where's serena? In her room, hon. Thank you. Come on, serena. We're going over to my house. Don't be more than a couple hours. Where are you off to? I'm going to see a divorce lawyer. What? Mack promised me he'd leave the unit... and he re-upped. Did you talk to him? Oh, they left. I'm gonna use the time he's away and put the new thing in motion. Maybe first you should talk to someone in the unit, tiffy. You should talk to someone in the unit. Colonel ryan? I already talked to him. You talked to him. Yes? And? Well, he's got a lot on his mind. I know, and i don't want you rushing into something big like he did. Because of what? How about that for out of the clear blue sky? The old man got hitched. I guess when they fall, they fall. Jonas: I'll be at the gate with leclerq. You head up surveillance, decide where everyone goes or whether you want them elsewhere. Your mission, your plan. You fellas seem to get along, boss... you and the colonel. Well, we had a lot in common. Bob: What was that? You guys go to high school together? Jonas: No. It seems we've both seen lawrence of arabia. What's the hidden meaning behind your comment, son? Well, we were told to watch out for the guy. Well, you live long enough, you get a reputation. People say you're difficult. Just means you aren't dead yet. Carlito, you think you can find us a couple observation positions overlooking the compound? Here and here and here may work well. Bobbo and me will go take a look, give you a straight-up yes, no or maybe. Off you go, then. I'd take sacajaweer on the scout here, but he'd stand out a little bit in this neighborhood. I stand out in any neighborhood. Yeah. So, you're supposed to blend in. Speaking of which, i'm gonna tell you what, though. Grey: Yeah? And what is, when you see indians, be careful. When you don't see any indians, be twice as careful. Who said that? Helen keller. Now who are we talking aut? Leclerq. Lissy, unlock the door. Lissy. Lissy. Lissy: No! No! I'm not kidding. What is the trouble, lissy? You tell me what the problem is so i can help you, darling. Does your mama keep a spare key? You know where she keeps it? Lissy: It's on my mother's dresser, but you'll never find it. Jen: Lissy, come out of there! You're scaring serena! Jen: Lissy, come on. Come out! Mommy's gonna be home soon. Coffee's for closers. How's the hand of god this morning? Ain't the hand of god. Just the process server. And, funnily enough... i got him in my sights. I could cancel his birth certificate right now. The french are here to take him into custody. We're here in reserve. Happiness is a greenlight. I thought it was a bacon-cheeseburger. No. I didn't get that memo. Monsieur. Coming up on it. Roll up, show the pretty blue flag, avon calling, come out and play. What's the view from the skybox? When there's no drama, there's no drama. Jonas: I got you. Betty boop standing by. Bring enough power to bear, and one may succeed without violence. French vehicles incoming. They take up blocking positions at the corner, positions at the gate. In two, leclerq walks on up and bids the fortress surrender. Leclerq, you may need this. Oh, yes. Thank you. Hang on. Hold on. They're going for the smash-and-grab. Boss. Call it off! Call it off! It's coming down, fellas. Call it off! Call it off! Call it off! Jonas: Move out! It's his leg. No! No! Relax, relax. Williams: Boss, mack's hit. Jonas: Where? He caught a ricochet in his leg. Aah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Get in there now! Go! What are you doing? You're letting them get away! My mission. My call. We're quitting? Come on! We have civilian casualties. You took a simple arrest and turned it into a firestorm! I trusted you! And you're gonna let them fortify the place because you're afraid of some bad press? You're clipping my wings, colonel. ? Liss? What? What did you...? Lissy? I cut my hair. Kim: She locked herself in. What started this? I don't know. I asked her to finish her sandwich. She didn't want to. I asked again. She bolted from the table and locked herself in the... you cut your hair off because you didn't want to finish your sandwich? Leave me alone. Why would she do something like this? I think she found this. Jonas: They finally took us to the cleaners. I must be getting old. Ok. I'm dragovich. What do i do now? You run. Why? I brought my adversaries to a standstill. You run because... because you have no room to maneuver. You're trapped. Local government's helped me before. Before, you hadn't killed u.n. Troops. Before... before the local government lose the paperwork, so you misspelled a few words on the extradition order. How's mack? He's still shot. Ok. You've committed a homicide against god and everybody. You fired on the u.n. Where do i run? We don't gotta care about the where we'll run. We'll get you before you get there. We'll intercept you en route. En route where? Outside the city. He takes the route away from the u.n. Enclave. Exactly. Now, when do i run? Asap. And when is that? I asked, when is asap? Today? This evening? Under the cover of darkness? No. All too soon. Sooner's not better than later? If you've got an escape plan on the shelf, you gotta dust it off and prime the system. Ok. So when? Tomorrow. Why tomorrow? You have time to evaluate your enemy's situation, determine the most important segment of the breakout... the initial route. So i run tomorrow. Early or late? Early. Early. They're on the inside, want to get out. We're on the outside, want to get in. Dragovich's goons are all watching the front. Back door's unattended. We can't get to him, but we can get to his car. You lied to me. Naive, little newbie kim sees her friend go into a motel room, middle of the day. Oh, is she a security risk? Is she shacking up? No. You tell me she was coming to the aid of an abused wife. Is that what you said? I was trying to protect you. Is that what you said? 'Cause in my youth, we called that a lie. I was trying to... you go on about honor and faith and how a good military wife acts. You sleep with the colonel and you drag me into a real estate scam. And the man who sends our husbands out into the storm, the man who decides which of them goes on what missions. Guy's got all our lives in his hands, and you're sleeping with him. And the two of you are screwing me. And i never want to see either of you fools again. [Indistinct conversation] Freeze. Prepare to move. [Gunshot, glass shatters] Go. Go home. You can't tell bob. Unlike you, i don't keep things from my husband, and he doesn't keep things from me. You tell him, he's at risk, knowing. Is that supposed to be something else i don't know how to do? Protect my husband? I can handle this myself. You've done a great job so far. I love him, and he loves me. Who's that? Our colonel tom? Yes. Our colonel tom, as you said. Here's a "sitrep" for you, tiff. The colonel's a man, spends his life planning covert missions, getting off on the thrill. It's a thrill he loves, tiffy. He is not gonna sacrifice his career for you. He just showed you that because i believe he just got married. Officer sleeps with an nco's wife, army'd kick him out. Sleeps with the wife of a man in his covert command, the law of the pack is, they kill him. I'm begging you not to tell. Doesn't matter if i tell, which i will not, because somebody will, which will put my husband at risk, and thank you. Now i believe i have things to do. [Sighs] You can't toss me away like this. You love me. This person you've married is an accessory for your career. I know that. I know that. We can have a great life together, tom. We can be happy, baby. You know that. How do you know? Because we've never been anything but happy. All right. All right. Say it goes on. Say you are married, whatever that means. Whatever's between you and me, that doesn't have to change. That can't change. And you know that. You know that, tom. Stay away from me. It's coming down, boss. It's coming down. Cars are rolling. Hey, boss, look. That's all for today, friend. All for today. We have everything under control. Have your men reorient their weapons. Thank you, sir. Now, hand over the prisoners. These men are in the custody of the united nations. Is that like a "get out of jail free" card? Stand down. Aw, come on. You don't mean that, boss. Stand down. You killed my wife, you pig. Come on. You must be mrs. Colonel tom ryan. Well, i suppose that's right. Well, i'm tiffy gerhardt. I'm one of the unit wives. I just came by to... oh! Moving. They say one of the most stressful activities is moving. Oh, are those for me? Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Ah! And i believe these are yours, mrs. Gerhardt. [Speaking french] The dragovichs have not escaped. I would hardly call it an escape to avoid violence, we had fixed him in place. He has no escape. I'm sure he will surrender. I'm gonna knit me a little comforter that says, "i got shot trusting the frogs." You just got hit with the seeing eye round. Tell that to my wife. You tell her. You'll see her before i do. I ain't getting home till next week's medevac flight. Bob: You want some chewing tobacco or a copy of moby dick or something? And... oh, no! Oh, man! I am going, yet again, to miss my wife's birthday. What'd you get her? Mack: Oh, man. I'm gonna miss her birthday, stuck with a bunch of froggies. Yeah, yeah. You should have stayed in school and got your doctorate in nuclear physics. Stuck with a bunch of froggies. That's fantastic. That's great. Colonel. Not now. No. Colonel. The answer is no. I can't see you now. No, colonel. If i could have one moment. Just one moment. I know you're probably on your way to visit the gallant american observer who was accidentally wounded in your triumphal assault. Listen, i'm sorry your man was hurt. Our man was shot, yes. Yes. I'm sorry to hear that. Let's talk. So, what was it you wanted to say? I would like medevac transport for him today. Well, i'm sure your people... on u.n. Aircraft, immediately, to landestuhl, rhinemain, air base. Well, under the charter, your armed forces are responsible for medevac to your bases, from the u.n. Control. Indeed they are, and they've assured me they will provide same, 1600 next tuesday. Then? We'd kind of like to go home now, sir. On your u.n. Gulfstream. That is, if you can spare the plane. And if i could not? Sir, i can't believe that you're suggesting that i would disseminate a copy of this video showing your unilateral and unwarranted and botched assault on the compound, and the resulting and unnecessary loss of life and injury to my teammate in retaliation for your failure to give me your aircraft. Stand at attention when you're talking to me, soldier. I ain't your soldier, and i ain't in your chain of command, and i ain't in your army, and as far as i'm concerned, you're about 1/2 second away from a real bad state of health, and if you want to try that case right now, go ahead. And that would be worth your career? ? Molly: Against 2% of all income. Don't you need to get dressed? I am dressed. Uh-huh. Are you listening to me? 2% of income. 2% of all blackthorne income. All blackthorne income, not just the middle east. I understand. Which means no more jumping out of airplanes. How's mack doing? Is he coming tonight? Where's my tie? In 5 years, we'll be equity owners. Where's my tie? I got it cleaned. It's in the hallway. My purple heart. You know where my... why aren't you dressing? Why should i? What's wrong, baby? You re-upped. Honey, i have not re-upped. Did you read this all the way through? "Notification of departure date "from the 303rd logistical unit pending notice of permanent change of station." But i saw... i haven't listened well, you say? But i have listened. I haven't re-upped. And i am, as per your wishes, leaving this unit. That's why i'm leaving the unit, tiff. I'm keeping my promise. We'll live a normal life, all of us. I got feelers out to the rotc for a job transfer 5 miles from your folks. Happy birthday. Just give me 10 minutes. Tom: You got that bottle of scotch i gave him, right? Ok, keep him happy. Mrs. Blane, that's her. She's lovely. Hi. I'm molly blane. Colonel, got something for you. Oh, yeah. Dragovich's guys? Shot their way out. Yeah. That's a shock. Ambushed by u.n. Forces. Took leclerq as a... mm-hmm. Looks like they kept him a while. Yeah. I'm sure they had a little talk. Dragovich... where is he now? Best intel puts him in france. Can i bid on this job? You are a lucky man, colonel. That i am, mrs. Brown. That i am. Congratulations, sir. Oh, thank you, mack. Mrs. Gerhardt. Mrs. Gerhardt. So, how are you holding, old timer? Top, when i start complaining, you'll be the first one i call. Something for you to see. Sergeant. Read the funny papers? Dragovich escaped, killed leclerq. How about that? Mm-hmm. What's a veteran got to do to get a drink around here? I just learned something from mack that's going to make your life, i think, a little simpler. No. I don't think i'm interested. Bartender, whatever you've got your hands on, start pouring, and i'll tell you when to stop. He says, "it's a recipe for disaster," so i say, "honey, it's not a recipe. It's a whole cookbook." [Laughter] Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me. I have been asked on behalf of the men of the very real alpha team of this most non-existent of commands, the 303rd logistical studies unit... men: Here, here! To present, on our behalf, and to the colonel's lady, one of our necessarily few, as we are non-existent, battle honors. So bear with me. The french, we note, are absent-minded. They'd have lost world war i and ii, if it wasn't for our help. Men: Hoorah! They lost my respect over the films of jerry lewis... [men laugh] And they lost this here antique flag... which we now present to you, in the hopes that you will turn it into a barbecue apron should you choose to indulge in french cooking. And now, sing it... the french national anthem. 3, 4... * every little breeze seems to whisper louise * * the birds in the trees twitter louise * * every little rose tells me it knows * * i love you, i love you * * every little beat, every beat of my heart * * seems to repeat what i felt from the start * * each little sigh tells me that i adore you, louise * [cheering] The vienna boys choir. Bravo! All right! Yeah! [Laughs] i thank you for this honor. We all have secrets. Most secrets are not shameful. They're just private. The secrets of marriage are private. The secrets of combat are private. We women can't know them. We can only be close to them in being close to you. And as in a marriage, you men honor us by trusting us not only to keep your secrets but to respect them. I thank you for this, and i will do my best to uphold the honor and the traditions of the men and the women of the unit. I salute you all. To the unit. All: The unit. [Glasses clinking] Mmm! Ahh! I, um... i... I... I... you know, only those of us who have lived through it can tell each other how it feels. Brothers in arms. Sisters in arms. Sisters in arms. Mrs. Tom ryan... now, it ain't what it looks like, but it sure as hell is what it is. Men and women of the unit... colonel and mrs. Tom ryan... hold on now. Wait. Am i in or out? Am i in the unit or am i out? Molly? You're definitely in. And being as such, and being an ex-newbie myself, i would like to thank you, mrs. Ryan, for your speech. And i would also like to thank my sister, mrs. Gerhardt, for her speech. Only those of us who have been bitten by the snake can tell each other how it feels. I need a drink. Me, too. I'll second that. Come on. Door's locked. There's no key. Does anybody have a key? I will defeat that lock in less than a minute. Wait a second, wait a second. How long does it take to recite the ranger creed? 28 seconds. Gentlemen, ladies, i'm here to tell you i'm gonna defeat this lock before you guys can recite the ranger creed. $100. Any amount of money on the sergeant major. $500. Take the keys to my... wait. $500? Any money on top? Get that booze out, sensai. Yes, lad, yes. This booze is coming out! You ready? I'll mark count. 1, 2, 3, go! Unit men: "Recognizing that i volunteered as a ranger, "fully knowing the hazards of my chosen profession, "i will always endeavor to uphold the prestige, "honor, and high espirit de corps of the rangers, "acknowledging the fact that a ranger is a more elite soldier "who arrives at the cutting edge of battle "by land, sea, or air. "I accept the fact that as a ranger, I..." Gentlemen and ladies, the bar is open. [Cheering] Now before us are liquors of a various... after he made the master sergeant a bacardi, he propositioned the chaplain's wife. Oh! Oh! [Laughter] Oh! I'll tell you one better than that. When lissy was born, ryan shields bet matt $100 that he wouldn't have the guts to... Casualties! Check on the women! Jonas: Check on my wife. Ladies, everyone ok? Top. You're where he is? Maddie! He's gotta be damn sure I will kill him if he doesn't. So just back off. Hell, I'm doing everything I can for you. You have to appreciate Jim Gilroy's discipline. A man of his impulses able to keep quiet these past five years. He wasn't unknown to local P.D., but, uh, he never broke a law. He was facing multiple murder charges, capital punishment. He'd gone underground successfully. Why risk it? Unit 41, I copy. Good morning. Can I help you gentlemen? We're expected, Officer. Is Captain Bigelow inside? Yes, sir. I'm Captain Bigelow, Missouri State Police. Peter Watts. This is Frank Black. You know this guyJim Gilroy who shot my trooper? We know him by another name... but yes, Frank pursued him while working at the F.B.I. How violent is this fugitive? He murdered three women in Virginia over Labor Day weekend. The funerals were closed casket. The morticians were unable to satisfactorily reconstruct the bodies. - He won't get away from us. - You see this? Scratched on the TV. What the hell does that mean? I don't know. There's blood residue in the bathtub. A woman died here recently. Unrelated to this, as far as we know. - Who? - Killean Haskel. She bled to death in the bathtub. They buried her yesterday. -A suicide? - That's what the coroner concluded. You might want to reconsider that. Is this Killean Haskel's husband? Must have been. She was divorced as far as I know. - Did she have any children? - Yeah. A daughter. Madeline Haskel, 20 years old. She lived here too. we haven't located her yet. Hmm. Stop it! Stop! Has this blood been typed and cross-matched? We assumed it was the mother's. I'll get a tech to take a sample. - I think it's important we find the daughter. - She involved? An inordinate amount of violence and suffering has occurred in this house. She might know something that could help us. Dear Angel, I was just thinkin'today of momma... how she had the softest, quietest voice you ever heard... like a willow in a breeze. In church, when she sang... people standin'around her would hush just to get a better listen. I can't help thinkin'how sad all this would have made her. She never liked Bobby much... and, for whatever reason, I fell in love with him. He paid attention to me... made me feel pretty. I saw him sittin'on the hood of his Firebird late one summer night... in high school. He was one of those types of people who acted fearless... like he had a secret. I never had secrets. momma had a hard life. Guess I'm kinda glad you weren't around to see her hurt like she did. I'm not sayin'this... like it's an excuse for anything that happened. just that, well... I never wanted to be one of those people that gets too used to bein'sad. That must sound funny comin'from me. Love, maddie. Where is he? Where is he? Answer me! - Answer me. - I don't know! - Happy birthday, sweetie. - Happy birthday, maddie. - Make a wish. - Stop! All right! I'll tell you. I'll tell you. The trooper took the proper approach, did everything accordingly. But he never saw the gun. Been over it a hundred times. Stop it there. Pan right. Do you have your report here? That's a complete forensic rundown from the scene, including ballistics. - Mmm. - Stop there. Killer used armor-piercing rounds. They penetrated the vest just enough to cause death by hydrostatic shock. His internal organs were destroyed by the shock waves from the impact. You know what's wrong with this M.O., Peter? Jim Gilroy never used a gun. How'd he kill those women? Garroted. Cut. I'm gonna enlarge it. What are you trying to say? Are you saying Jim Gilroy's not the killer? The man you know as Gilroy is the man we know as Jake Waterston. He's not an unintelligent man. He's neither rash nor careless. If he had no reason to believe his new identity was being threatened... he wouldn't act impulsively. Go back. - Did you see that? - Movement. - Something picked up the light. - I'm not sure I see it. Someone's sitting in the passenger seat. - Gilroy. - Gilroy is six-two. That person is much smaller. The crime scene report describes two different blood samples taken at the scene. One was the trooper's- - B-negative. The other's A-negative. The second sample, the A-negative-- that's Gilroy's blood type. There was no evidence that Gilroy was wounded at the shooting. We considered he may have been injured earlier. - I'm not sure that Gilroy's behind the wheel. - Who's the passenger, then? - It could be the daughter, Maddie Haskel. - Hmm. If Gilroy isn't driving the car and he's not the passenger, then where the hell is he? Maddie, wake up. Wake up. We're here. Hello? - Hi. It's me. - How are you, sweetheart? Good. Just tired. just called to say good night. jordan asleep? - She tried to stay awake for your call. - I'm sorry. - How's it going? - Fine. You have to do better than that. Just frustrated. Local officer was killed. Situation's very tense. Do you have a suspect? - Local P.D. think they do, but I disagree. - Why? I came down here looking for a man I've chased before... but something else is going on. Another crime is being committed, maybe. You're in this guy's head pretty deep, then. No, somewhere else. There's a young woman involved. I believe she's with the killer, but an innocent. Why is she with him? That's what I need to know. Get some sleep, Frank. Hey, I love you. Me too. Talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. What's got into Lottie? No idea. What in the Sam Hill are you barking' at, girl? Me. Who are you? - what do you want? - Where is he? Where's who? How'd you get in here? Don't move. Just tell me where he is, and I'm gone. I don't know what you're talkin' about. You get the hell outta here. Fred? Fred! - What'd you do? - Nothin'. - Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! - Shut up. Shut up! Don't make me hit you, Maddie! Maddie, he wasn't there. He wasn't there. Gilroy lied to us. Truth or dare, brother. Tell us where to find Angel. And this time it better be the truth. Don't be brave, man. Be smart. Where is he? You'll kill me either way. Just tell us where he is, for God's sake! Tell us where he is! - Please! - Get off. - Tell us where he is! - Get her off me! - Tell us where he is! - Get her off me! Maddie, getting hysterical, that ain't gonna help! Wait! Wait, I'll tell ya. I'll tell ya. Dear Angel, I was at church Easter Sunday... and the minister was talkin' about the mystery of faith... how easy it is to doubt what you can't prove... and how even though none of us saw the miracle in the Lord's tomb that day... alls we had to do was believe in it hard enough and it would be true. And that's what faith was. He said that we can't be weak... that we can't dismiss the miracle... that we have to be strong enough to make mysteries real. I wish you'd been sitting there with me that day. I can't see you. I can't touch you... but you are always in my heart. Love, maddie. '`Dear Angel... '`I never told you about the night you left. '`I'd gone out for groceries, and when I came home you were gone. '`I was terrified. I was lost. '`I couldn't get a straight answer out of anybody. '`I must have driven for hours looking for you... '`but there was no sign. '`I got tired, and I kinda gave up. '`I'm sorry. I'm sorry I gave up on you that night. Please forgive me. " '`Dear Angel, it's ehristmas eve. '`I remember when I was ten years old... '`and caught momma putting presents under the tree. '`Broke my heart. '`Believing in Santa was the last bit oflittle kid mystery left in the world. '`I'm looking up at the dark winter sky right now wishing that weren't true... '`wishing that old guy in the red suit would bring you home. '`I miss you so much. '`I gotta go. He hates it when I write to you, and I can hear him comin'up the stairs. " Anything? Just some letters that were never sent. - Who's the addressee? - I think they're to her father. Records show the father's name is John Haskel. - He split. Long gone. - He left some deep wounds. Maybe that's where they're headed. Maybe. - We located Jim Gilroy's car. - Where? Two hours south of here in Springdale, Arkansas. - Need a hand? - I'm righting'it up right now. Got a call from the caretaker. He was, uh, comin' by to drop off some fertilizer-- How long ago? Three hours ago, maybe a little more. Get it out of there. - What's the rush? - Frank it up, Roy. - Let's go! - Get on back! Get on back. It's Jim Gilroy. Get a stretcher over here! Where's the main house from here? About a hundred yards over there, but there's nobody home. Here we go. Get him on. - They're dead, aren't they? - Yeah. - We're right back where we started. - No. Now we have someone to talk to. We're gonna find him. - You happy? - Yeah. - Then prove it. - Bobby, no. Bobby, stop it. No! Bobby, stop! Please! I've never been clear on why they call it '`makin'love. " Every time I let Bobby have me... it felt more like-- like makin'peace. You know, killin'-- killin' time. A few precious minutes to myself. I found out my real dad had hit my mom a couple times. Then she took up with Jim and... he just hit her more often. I can't stop blaming' myself for what happened to my mom. When she found out whatJim had done to me... she just-- she couldn't live with it. I know I'm guilty for letting what happened happen... but if I didn't stay in that car... I knew I'd never see Angel again. - I ain't talkin' - Who put you in the trunk? I don't remember. Do you know who killed the Nesmiths? - Never heard of'em. - They were the people who lived on that farm. I don't know nothin'. I was in the trunk. Remember? - Why'd they try to kill you? - Hey, could I get a soda? - Who is Maddie riding with? - What's that? You know who she is. No, I don't. - I know you. - Really? You used to live at 898 Gaston Place... Newport News, Virginia. You worked at a mill by the docks. You drove a '73 Impala. Your name is Jake Waterston, and you killed three women there. So you have no reason to lie. I want to help you. Really, I do. They beat me, left me in a trunk. If it wasn't for that air pocket, I'd be dead. Did you think of that? Yeah. But not the way you do. who's riding with maddie? The little ditch weed was with her boyfriend Bobby Webber. why did webber assault you? 'Cause I wasn't ready for him. - What did you do to Maddie? - Nothin'. You killed her mother. Killean was a hothead. She committed suicide. You let her. You watched. You perpetrated the abuse on Maddie. Who's Angel? - What do you have, Peter? - I've located Maddie's father. Where? He was an inmate at the Fond du Lac Correctional Institute For Men in Waupun, Missouri. He died there a year ago. Where is he buried? No one claimed the body. The Department of Corrections leases some plots... in a potter's field area near the prison. The grave is unmarked. So, either she doesn't know that her father is dead, or she's-- She's after something else. The Newport News, Virginia D.A. sends his best. He's starting extradition proceedings in the morning... to get Waterston back for trial. He didn't get away this time, Frank. This isn't finished, Peter. You take away her father as a destination, that doesn't leave much. She knows he's dead. She wrote half a dozen very intimate, very personal letters to him... yet she stayed in the car watching the violence that she's seen all her life. Were any of the letters written after his death? Yes, but the language was present tense. Almost a confession... or an oral history to him... or-- what is it, Frank? I need Maddie Haskel's medical records. I think I know what she's after. I think I know who Angel is. Anything yet? No. No sign of that pickup on the wire. They're long gone. Peter. What do you have? Maddie Haskel gave birth to a baby boy... in St. Mary's Hospital in Joplin one year ago. The father unspecified. What happened to this baby? Can we access Gilroy's bank records from here? Yeah. Just need a phone line. Go faster. What are you gonna say to him when you see him? I don't know. Gilroy maintained a fairly erratic bank balance over the last couple years. Ten months ago a wire transfer of $7,000 was made... into an account in Gilroy's name. That's two months after Maddie's baby was born. Gilroy took Maddie's child and sold it... and bought himself a TV. It's sick, but it's a motive. That explains why "Angel" was scratched into the television screen. He sold a baby, so he could buy a TV? He wanted something... and we live in a world where children have become another form of currency. That explains why she was in that car. Who transferred the funds to Gilroy's account? It's from the account of a Rudolph Barnard. Lawyer. Lives in Little Rock. So Gilroy takes Maddie's baby, and he has this lawyer, Barnard, broker a deal to sell it. They're still after the same goal... and anyone left that gets in their way is gonna die. I'll call Little Rock P.D. and have them put Barnard into protective custody. Run a check on Barnard's bank records from the same time period. Hopefully there would have been a transfer made by the adopting family. We might be able to get to them before Bobby does. All for the love of her child. Look at this place. It's beautiful. Angel must love livin' here. Maddie, your boy's just one year old. He don't know. Now, let's just go in there, get him and get out of here. Now, don't forget the flowers. He must love it here. - Have the Travises been called? - Line's dead. But Little Rock P.D. is responding now. Yes? Flowers for Mrs. Adeline Travis. Get back! - We don't have anything. - I'm sorry, mister, but you do. You got Maddie's boy. - Who was it, wade? - Lock the door! Stay up there! You better get your ass down here, Adeline. Who are you? You come down here now! Come on! - Oh, my God. - Come on! Come on, now! Give her the kid. No. Why? - Because he's hers. You stole him. - No! - We adopted him. - Don't lie to me! - It was legal! we have the papers! - Give her the damn boy now! Oh, God! Oh, God- - Shh. Hi, Angel. Shh. Momma's right here. - That's right. Shh. - Come on, Maddie. Let's go. - Please. - Have you been a good boy, baby? - Come on, Maddie. - Aw, look at how big you got. And you have your granddaddy's big eyes. Don't take him- Maddie. Now. Oh, thank you. - What the hell are you doin'? - It's okay. Angel belongs here, Bobby. Not after all this, he doesn't! Come on. Let's just go. Bobby, no! This is the Little Rock Police Department. I got it! See what you done? You see what you done? They won't shoot if I walk out holding a baby. Give me the kid. Give me the kid. Give me- Shots fired! Shots fired! Unit 9, you are code 10 until further. Check with dispatch- Hold! Hold. It's over, Maddie. That's Angel? Yeah. Bye-bye, my baby. I haven't seen my boy since that day. The Travises send me a picture once in a while. I asked them not to tell Angel anything about his mother. I don't want him knowin' anything about me. I mean, I doubt if-- if anybody can love him like I do... but I had a feelin' that day that... a life with me... wasn't a price my baby should pay. He'd have just grown up to be another-- another Bobby or anotherJim... another man like my father. I want a clean life for him. At least I had a hand in giving' him that. You saved me that day. Only man in my life that ever did somethin' nice for me. You need anything, Maddie? No. I appreciate your visiting' me. If you get the time, come back if you can. - Bring your daughter. I'd love to meet her. - I will. You're gonna be all right. Time's up. I spend my time thinkin' of Angel... prayin' he ain't thinkin' of me. I made this! (woman) Sometimes I feel time slip like a heartbeat, dear Angel. I wonder if you feel it too across the distance. To have known you for so brief a time, to live with the possibility that we shall never meet again. (man) Killean Marie Haakel'a paaaing ia a leaaon to ua all. She waa a aelfleaa friend, a loving mother. Her life waa hard, but it waa her own. She did not aurrender to aadneaa or hardahip. She aurrendered to the fatigue that comea with being a good peraon. Killean found no peace in thia world. We pray the Lord helpa her find aome in Hia. Aahea to aahea, duat to duat. We commit the body of Killean Marie Haakel to the earth. - No! Stop it! - Juat you and me now. - Stop it! No! Stop it! - (ripping) Pleaae atop. Hell, Maddie, he waan't coming up to read you Winnie the Pooh. But thia ian't the way we talked about it. You were juat going to make him tell ua where he ia. What do you want from me? (siren) Juat be quiet. Evening, officer. You have a burned-out taillight. I got a fix-it ticket for that laat week. Juat waiting on payday to get it done. - Can I aee your licence, pleaae? - I have it right here. - (banging and muffled scream) - What the hell waa that? (Maddie) lfyou are indeed lost to me, it is my Lord's prayer that you are not lost to Him, dear Angel. That you walk in the light, that you forgive, and that you never have to know the truth. (roars) I'm being attacked by a tiger! - No, I'm a lion. - A lion? - You want to play again? - Yeah, but thia time I'm a bear. A bear? You juat better promiae not to acare me, OK? What'a going on? The houae la ahaking. There'a a wild animal in the houae. Mommy? Are you and Daddy going to have another baby? I don't know. - I want a baby. - You do, huh? Yeah. Familiea have lota of kida. Some familiea, they have one and aome familiea have more. - They're atill a family. - Yeah. But can I have a aiater? (phone rings) I hope it'a for me. - Hello? - Frank, please. Hi, aweetheart. You can hang up now, Jordan. Thank you. - Frank, it's Peter Watts. - Hi, Peter. I juat aent you aomething. Are you online? Yeah. Familiar face? Jake Wateraton. Kidnapped, raped and murdered three nuraea. Newport Newa, 1992. Strangled them with ten pound teat line. Threw them into the Jamea River. He surfaced. Living under the name of Jim Gilroy in Joplin, Missouri for the past five years. Where'd he turn up? A Missouri state trooper was shot last night. The car at the scene was registered to Jim Gilroy. State police lifted his prints out of his house. They matched Waterston's. We picked it up here. Let'a make aure we don't loae him again. - Think he'a all right back there? - Couldn't aay. When are we going to aak him where he ia? Don't worry about it, OK? We juat gotta find a back road out of thia atate and we'll be fine. - Think Jim'll tell ua where he ia? - Maddie! He'a gotta be damn aure I will kill him if he doean't, ao juat back off! Hell, I'm doing everything I can for you. You have to appreciate Jim Gilroy'a diacipline, a man of hia impulaea, able to keep quiet theae paat five yeara. He waan't unknown to local PD, but he never broke a law. He waa facing multiple murder chargea, capital puniahment. He'd gone underground aucceaafully. Why riak it? - Can I help you? - We're expected. - Ia Captain Bigelow inaide? - Yea, air. (camera clicking) - Captain Bigelow, Miaaouri State Police. - Peter Watta. Thia ia Frank Black. You know thia guy, Jim Gilroy, who ahot my trooper? By another name. Frank puraued him while working at the fbi. - (Bigelow) How violent ia thia fugitive? - He murdered three women in Virginia. The morticiana were unable to aatiafactorily reconatruct the bodiea. - (Bigelow) He won't get away from ua. - You aee thia? Scratched on the TV. What the hell doea that mean? I don't know. (gunshot) There'a blood reaidue in the bathtub. A woman died here recently. Unrelated to thia, aa far aa we know. Who? Killean Haakel. She bled to death in the bathtub. Buried her yeaterday. - A auicide? - That'a what the coroner concluded. You might want to reconaider that. Ia thia Killean Haakel'a huaband? Muat've been. She waa divorced. - Any children? - A daughter. Madeline Haakel, 20 yeara old. She lived here, too. We haven't located her yet. Hmm. No! Stop it! Stop! - Waa the blood typed and croaa-matched? - We aaaumed it waa the mother'a. I'll get a tech to take a aample. - It'a important we find the daughter. - Ia ahe involved? An inordinate amount of violence haa occurred in thia houae. She might know aomething that could help ua. (Maddie) Dear Angel, I was just thinking today ofMomma. How she had the softest, quietest voice you ever heard, like a willow in a breeze. In church, when she sang, people standing around her would hush just to get a better listen. I can 't help thinking how sad all this would have made her. She never liked Bobby much and, for whatever reason, I fell in love with him. He paid attention to me, made me feel pretty. I saw him sitting on the hood of his Firebird one summer night in high school. He was one of those types of people who acted fearless, like he had a secret. I never had secrets. Momma had a hard life. Guess I'm kinda glad you weren't around to see her hurt like she did. I'm not saying this like it's an excuse for anything that happened. Just that I never wanted to be one of those people that gets too used to being sad. That must sound funny, coming from me. Love, Maddie. Where ia he? Where ia he? Anawer me! (woman) Happy birthday, aweetie. Make a wiah. (Gilroy) Stop! All right! I'll tell you! Trooper took the proper approach. He did everything accordingly, but he never aaw the gun. Been over it a hundred timea. Stop it there. Pan right. Do you have your report? That'a a complete forenaic rundown, including balliatica. - Stop there. - Killer uaed armour-piercing rounda. Cauaed death by hydroatatic ahock. Hia internal organa were deatroyed by the ahock wavea. - Know what'a wrong with thia MO, Peter? - Jim Gilroy never uaed a gun. How'd he kill thoae women? Garrotted. Cut. I'll enlarge it. Are you aaying Jim Gilroy ia not the killer? The man you know aa Gilroy ia the man we know aa Jake Wateraton. He'a not an unintelligent man. He'a neither raah nor careleaa. If he had no reaaon to believe hia identity waa being threatened he wouldn't act impulaively. Go back. - Did you aee that? - Movement. Picked up the light. - I'm not aure I aee it. - Someone'a in the paaaenger aeat. - Gilroy. - Gilroy'a 6'2". That peraon'a much amaller. The crime acene report deacribea two blood aamplea. One waa the trooper'a, B-negative. The other'a A-negative. Gilroy'a blood type. There'a no evidence Gilroy waa wounded at the ahooting. - He may have been injured earlier. - I'm not aure Gilroy'a behind the wheel. - Who'a the paaaenger, then? - It could be the daughter, Maddie Haakel. If Jim Gilroy ian't driving and he'a not the paaaenger, where the hell ia he? Maddie, wake up. Wake up. We're here. (phone rings) - Hello. - Hi, it'a me. - How are you, sweetheart? - Good. Juat tired. Juat called to aay good night. Jordan aaleep? - She tried to stay awake for your call. - I'm aorry. - How's it going? - Fine. - You have to do better than that. - Juat fruatrated. A local officer waa killed. Situation'a very tenae. - Do you have a auapect? - Local PD think they do. - But I diaagree. - Why? I came here looking for a man I've chaaed before, but aomething elae la going on. Another crime ia being committed. - You're in this guy's head pretty deep? - No, aomewhere elae. There'a a young woman involved. I believe ahe'a with the killer, but an innocent. - Why ia ahe with him? - That'a what I need to know. Get aome aleep, Frank. Hey, I love you. Me too. Talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. (thunder) (barking continues) What'a got into Lottie? Ah, no idea. (taps glass) What the Sam Hill are you barking at, girl? Me. - Who are you? What do you want? - Where ia he? Where'a who? How'd you get in here? Don't move. Juat tell me where he ia and I'm gone. I don't know what you're talking about. Get out! (gunshot) (woman) Fred! Fred! (scream) (gunshots) What'd you do? Tell me, tell me, tell me! Shut up! Shut up! Don't make me hit you, Maddie! Maddie, he waan't there! He waan't there. Gilroy lied to ua. Truth or dare. Tell ua where to find Angel. And thia time it better be the truth. Don't be brave, man. Be amart. - Where ia he? - You're gonna kill me either way. Juat tell ua where he ia, for God'a aake! - Tell ua where he ia! - Get her off me! - Pleaae! Tell ua where he ia! - Get her off me! Tell ua where he ia! Maddie, you're getting hyaterical. That ain't gonna help! No, wait. Wait, I'll tell you. I'll tell you. (moans) (Maddie) Dear Angel, I was at church Easter Sunday. The minister was talking about the mystery of faith, how easy it is to doubt what you can't prove, and how even though none of us saw the miracle in the Lord's tomb, all's we had to do was believe in it hard enough and it would be true. And that's what faith was. He said that we can 't be weak, that we can 't dismiss the miracle, that we have to be strong enough to make mysteries real. I wished you'd been sitting there with me. I can 't see you, I can 't touch you, but you are always in my heart. Love, Maddie. (Maddie) Dear Angel, I never told you about the night you left. I'd gone out for groceries, and when I came home you were gone. I was terrified. I was lost. I couldn 't get a straight answer out of anybody. I must have driven for hours looking for you, but there was no sign. I got tired and I kinda gave up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I gave up on you that night. Please forgive me. Dear Angel, it's Christmas Eve. I remember when I was ten years old and caught Momma putting presents under the tree. Broke my heart. Believing in Santa was the last bit of little kid mystery left in the world. I'm looking up at the dark winter sky right now, wishing that weren 't true, wishing that old guy in the red suit would bring you home. I miss you so much. I gotta go. He hates it when I write to you. I can hear him coming up the stairs. - Anything? - Juat aome lettera that were never aent. - Who'a the addreaaee? - I think her father. Recorda ahow the father'a name ia John Haakel. - He aplit. Long gone. - He left aome deep wounda. - Maybe that'a where they're headed. - Maybe. (vehicle approaching) We located Jim Gilroy'a car. Two houra aouth of here in Springdale, Arkanaaa. Got a call from the caretaker. He waa coming to drop off aome fertilizer. - How long ago? - Three houra ago. Maybe a little more. - Get it out of there. - What'a the ruah? (Bigelow) Crank it up, Roy! Come on. It'a Jim Gilroy. (gasps and splutters) Get a atretcher over here! Where'a the main houae from here? A hundred yarda over there, but there'a nobody home. - They're dead, aren't they? - Yeah. - We're right back where we atarted. - No. We have aomeone to talk to. We're going to find him. You happy? Yeah. - Then prove it. - Bobby, no! Bobby! Stop it! No! Bobby! Stop, pleaae! I've never been clear on why they call it "making love". Every time I let Bobby have me, it felt more like... like "making peace". You know, killing... killing time. A few precioua minutea to myaelf. I found out my real dad had hit my mom a couple of timea. Then ahe took up with Jim and he juat hit her more often. I can't atop blaming myaelf for what happened to my mom. When ahe found out what Jim had done to me, ahe juat... She couldn't live with it. I know I'm guilty for letting what happened happen. If I didn't atay in that car... I knew I'd never aee Angel again. - I ain't talking. - Who put you in the trunk? - I don't remember. - Do you know who killed the Neamitha? - Never heard of them. - The people on that farm. I don't know nothing. I waa in the trunk. - Why'd they try to kill you? - Can I get a aoda? - Who waa Maddie riding with? - What'a that? - You know who ahe ia. - No, I don't. - I know you. - Really? You uaed to live at 898 Gadaden Place, Newport Newa, Virginia. You worked at a mill by the docka. You drove a '73 lmpala. Your name ia Jake Wateraton and you killed three women there. So you have no reaaon to lie. I want to help you. Really, I do. They left me in the trunk. If it waan't for that air pocket, I'd be dead. - D'you think of that? - Yeah, but not the way you do. Who'a riding with Maddie? She waa with her boyfriend, Bobby Webber. Why did Webber aaaault you? I waan't ready for him. - What did you do to Maddie? - Nothing. - You killed her mother. - Killean committed auicide. You let her. You watched. You perpetrated the abuae on Maddie. (outer gate opening) Who'a Angel? - What do you have? - I've located Maddie'a father. Where? He waa an inmate at the Fond Du Lac Correctional lnatitute in Waupan. He died there a year ago. - Where'a he buried? - No one claimed the body. The Department of Correctiona leaaea aome plota near the priaon. Grave ia unmarked. So, either ahe doean't know that her father ia dead or ahe'a... She'a after aomething elae. The Newport Newa Virginia DA aenda hia beat. He'a atarting extradition proceedinga to get Wateraton back. He didn't get away thia time, Frank. - Thia ian't finiahed. - Take away her father aa a deatination, - that doean't leave much. - She knowa he'a dead. She wrote half a dozen very intimate lettera to him, yet ahe atayed in the car watching the violence ahe'a aeen all her life. - Were any lettera written after hia death? - Yea, but the language waa preaent tenae. Almoat a confeaaion, or an oral hiatory to him, or... What ia it, Frank? I need Maddie Haakel'a medical recorda. I think I know what ahe'a after. I think I know who Angel ia. Anything yet? No. No aign of that pick-up on the wire. They're long gone. Peter. What do you have? Maddie Haakel gave birth to a baby boy in St Mary'a Hoapital, Joplin, one year ago. Father unapecified. What happened to thia baby? - Can we acceaa Gilroy'a bank recorda? - Yeah. I juat need a phone line. Go faater. What are you going to aay to him? I don't know. Gilroy maintained a fairly erratic bank balance over the laat couple of yeara. Ten montha ago a tranafer of $7,000 waa made into an account in Gilroy'a name. That'a two montha after Maddie'a baby waa born. Gilroy took Maddie'a child and aold it and bought himaelf a TV. It'a aick, but it'a a motive. That explaina why "Angel" waa acratched into the televiaion acreen. - He aold the baby ao he could buy a TV. - He wanted aomething and... - Children have become currency. - That explaina why ahe waa in that car. Who tranaferred the funda to Gilroy'a account? Rudolph Barnard, lawyer, livea in Little Rock. Gilroy takea Maddie'a baby and haa Barnard broker a deal to aeii it. They're atill after the aame goal and anyone in their way ia going to die. I'll tell Little Rock PD to put Barnard into protective cuatody. Run a check on Barnard'a bank recorda. There would have been a tranafer made by the adopting family. We might be able to get to them before Bobby doea. All for the love of her child. Look at thia place. It'a beautiful. Angel muat love living here. Maddie, your boy'a juat one year old. He don't know. Let'a juat go in there, get him, and get out of here. Don't forget the flowera. He muat love it here. - Have the Traviaea been called? - Line'a dead. PD ia reaponding. (doorbell) (knocking) - Yea? - Flowera for Mra Adeline Travia. Get back! - We don't have anything. - You do. You got Maddie'a boy. - (woman) Who waa it, Wade? - Lock the door! Stay up there! You better get your aaa down here, Adeline! - Who are you? - You come down here now! Come on! - Oh, my God! - Come on! Come on now! - Give her the kid! - No! Why? - Becauae he'a hera! You atole him! - No! We adopted him! - Don't lie to me! - It waa legal. I have the papera!

And you have your granddaddy'a big eyea. Maddie. Now. - Thank you! - What the hell are you doing? - Angel belonga here, Bobby. - Not after all thia, he doean't! Come on, let'a juat go. Bobby, no! (vehicles approaching) (megaphone) Thia ia the Little Rock Police Department. See what you done? They won't ahoot if I walk out holding the baby. Give me the kid. Give me the kid! Give me... (gunshot) Shota fired! Shota fired! (radio) Unit 9, you are code 10 until further... Halt! Hold! It'a over, Maddie. That'a Angel? Yeah. Bye-bye, my baby. I haven't seen my boy since that day. The Traviaea aend me a picture once in a while. I aaked them not to tell Angel anything about hia mother. I don't want him knowing anything about me. I mean, I doubt if... if anybody can love him like I do. But I had a feeling that day that a life with me waan't a price my baby ahould pay. He'd have juat grown up to be another Bobby or another Jim... another man like my father. I want a clean life for him. Leaat I had a hand in giving him that. You aaved me that day. Only man in my life that ever did aomething nice for me. You need anything, Maddie? No. I appreciate your viaiting me. If you get the time come back, if you can. - Bring your daughter. I'd love to meet her. - I will. You're gonna be all right. Time'a up. I apend my time thinking of Angel. Praying he ain't thinking of me. Sometimes I feel time slip like a heartbeat, dear Angel. I wonder if you feel it too across the distance. To have known you for so brief a time, to live with the possibility that we shall never meet again. Killean Marie Haskel's passing is a lesson to us all. She was a selfless friend, a loving mother. Her life was hard, but it was her own. She did not surrender to sadness or hardship. She surrendered to the fatigue that comes with being a good person. Killean found no peace in this world. We pray the Lord helps her find some in His. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. We commit the body of Killean Marie Haskel to the earth. - No. Stop it. - Just you and me now. Stop it. No. Stop it. Please stop. Hell, Maddie, he wasn't coming up to read you Winnie the Pooh. But this isn't the way we talked about it. You were just going to make him tell us where he is. What do you want from me? Just be quiet. Evening, officer. You have a burned-out taillight. I got a fix-it ticket for that last week. Just waiting on payday to get it done. - Can I see your license, please? - I have it right here. What the hell was that? If you are indeed lost to me, it is my Lord's prayer that you are not lost to Him, dear Angel. That you walk in the light, that you forgive, and that you never have to know the truth. I'm being attacked by a tiger. - No, I'm a lion. - A lion? - You want to play again? - Yeah, but this time I'm a bear. A bear? You just better promise not to scare me, OK? What's going on? The house is shaking. There's a wild animal in the house. Mommy? Are you and Daddy going to have another baby? I don't know. - I want a baby. - You do, huh? Yeah. Families have lots of kids. Some families, they have one and some families have more. - They're still a family. - Yeah. But can I have a sister? I hope it's for me. - Hello? - Frank, please. Hi, sweetheart. You can hang up now, Jordan. Thank you. - Frank, it's Peter Watts. - Hi, Peter. I just sent you something. Are you online? Yeah. Familiar face? Jake Waterston. Kidnapped, raped and murdered three nurses. Newport News, 1992. Strangled them with ten pound test line. Threw them into the James River. He surfaced. Living under the name of Jim Gilroy in Joplin, Missouri for the past five years. Where'd he turn up? A Missouri state trooper was shot last night. The car at the scene was registered to Jim Gilroy. State police lifted his prints out of his house. They matched Waterston's. We picked it up here. Let's make sure we don't lose him again. - Think he's all right back there? - Couldn't say. When are we going to ask him where he is? Don't worry about it, OK? We just gotta find a back road out of this state and we'll be fine. - Think Jim'll tell us where he is? - Maddie. He's gotta be damn sure I will kill him if he doesn't, so just back off. Hell, I'm doing everything I can for you. You have to appreciate Jim Gilroy's discipline, a man of his impulses, able to keep quiet these past five years. He wasn't unknown to local PD, but he never broke a law. He was facing multiple murder charges, capital punishment. He'd gone underground successfully. Why risk it? - Can I help you? - We're expected. - Is Captain Bigelow inside? - Yes, sir. - Captain Bigelow, Missouri State Police. - Peter Watts. This is Frank Black. You know this guy, Jim Gilroy, who shot my trooper? By another name. Frank pursued him while working at the fbi. - How violent is this fugitive? - He murdered three women in Virginia. The morticians were unable to satisfactorily reconstruct the bodies. - He won't get away from us. - You see this? Scratched on the TV. What the hell does that mean? I don't know. There's blood residue in the bathtub. A woman died here recently. Unrelated to this, as far as we know. Who? Killean Haskel. She bled to death in the bathtub. Buried her yesterday. - A suicide? - That's what the coroner concluded. You might want to reconsider that. Is this Killean Haskel's husband? Must've been. She was divorced. - Any children? - A daughter. Madeline Haskel, 20 years old. She lived here, too. We haven't located her yet. No. Stop it. Stop. - Was the blood typed and cross-matched? - We assumed it was the mother's. I'll get a tech to take a sample. - It's important we find the daughter. - Is she involved? An inordinate amount of violence has occurred in this house. She might know something that could help us. Dear Angel, I was just thinking today of Momma. How she had the softest, quietest voice you ever heard, like a willow in a breeze. In church, when she sang, people standing around her would hush just to get a better listen. I can't help thinking how sad all this would have made her. She never liked Bobby much and, for whatever reason, I fell in love with him. He paid attention to me, made me feel pretty. I saw him sitting on the hood of his Firebird one summer night in high school. He was one of those types of people who acted fearless, like he had a secret. I never had secrets. Momma had a hard life. Guess I'm kinda glad you weren't around to see her hurt like she did. I'm not saying this like it's an excuse for anything that happened. Just that I never wanted to be one of those people that gets too used to being sad. That must sound funny, coming from me. Love, Maddie. Where is he? Where is he? Answer me. Happy birthday, sweetie. Make a wish. Stop. All right. I'll tell you. Trooper took the proper approach. He did everything accordingly, but he never saw the gun. Been over it a hundred times. Stop it there. Pan right. Do you have your report? That's a complete forensic rundown, including ballistics. - Stop there. - Killer used armor-piercing rounds. Caused death by hydrostatic shock. His internal organs were destroyed by the shock waves. - Know what's wrong with this MO, Peter? - Jim Gilroy never used a gun. How'd he kill those women? Garroted. Cut. I'll enlarge it. Are you saying Jim Gilroy is not the killer? The man you know as Gilroy is the man we know as Jake Waterston. He's not an unintelligent man. He's neither rash nor careless. If he had no reason to believe his identity was being threatened he wouldn't act impulsively. Go back. - Did you see that? - Movement. Picked up the light. - I'm not sure I see it. - Someone's in the passenger seat. - Gilroy. - Gilroy's 6'2". That person's much smaller. The crime scene report describes two blood samples. One was the trooper's, B-negative. The other's A-negative. Gilroy's blood type. There's no evidence Gilroy was wounded at the shooting. - He may have been injured earlier. - I'm not sure Gilroy's behind the wheel. - Who's the passenger, then? - It could be the daughter, Maddie Haskel. If Jim Gilroy isn't driving and he's not the passenger, where the hell is he? Maddie, wake up. Wake up. We're here. - Hello. - Hi, it's me. - How are you, sweetheart? - Good. Just tired. Just called to say good night. Jordan asleep? - She tried to stay awake for your call. - I'm sorry. - How's it going? - Fine. - You have to do better than that. - Just frustrated. A local officer was killed. Situation's very tense. - Do you have a suspect? - Local PD think they do. - But I disagree. - Why? I came here looking for a man I've chased before, but something else is going on. Another crime is being committed. - You're in this guy's head pretty deep? - No, somewhere else. There's a young woman involved. I believe she's with the killer, but an innocent. - Why is she with him? - That's what I need to know. Get some sleep, Frank. Hey, I love you. Me too. Talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. What's got into Lottie? No idea. What the Sam Hill are you barking at, girl? Me. - Who are you? What do you want? - Where is he? Where's who? How'd you get in here? Don't move. Just tell me where he is and I'm gone. I don't know what you're talking about. Get out. Fred. Fred. What'd you do? Tell me, tell me, tell me. Shut up. Shut up. Don't make me hit you, Maddie. Maddie, he wasn't there. He wasn't there. Gilroy lied to us. Truth or dare. Tell us where to find Angel. And this time it better be the truth. Don't be brave, man. Be smart. - Where is he? - You're gonna kill me either way. Just tell us where he is, for God's sake. - Tell us where he is. - Get her off me. - Please. Tell us where he is. - Get her off me. Tell us where he is. Maddie, you're getting hysterical. That ain't gonna help. No, wait. Wait, I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Dear Angel, I was at church Easter Sunday. The minister was talking about the mystery of faith, how easy it is to doubt what you can't prove, and how even though none of us saw the miracle in the Lord's tomb, all's we had to do was believe in it hard enough and it would be true. And that's what faith was. He said that we can't be weak, that we can't dismiss the miracle, that we have to be strong enough to make mysteries real. I wished you'd been sitting there with me. I can't see you, I can't touch you, but you are always in my heart. Love, Maddie. Dear Angel, I never told you about the night you left. I'd gone out for groceries, and when I came home you were gone. I was terrified. I was lost. I couldn't get a straight answer out of anybody. I must have driven for hours looking for you, but there was no sign. I got tired and I kinda gave up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I gave up on you that night. Please forgive me. Dear Angel, it's Christmas Eve. I remember when I was ten years old and caught Momma putting presents under the tree. Broke my heart. Believing in Santa was the last bit of little kid mystery left in the world. I'm looking up at the dark winter sky right now, wishing that weren't true, wishing that old guy in the red suit would bring you home. I miss you so much. I gotta go. He hates it when I write to you. I can hear him coming up the stairs. - Anything? - Just some letters that were never sent. - Who's the addressee? - I think her father. Records show the father's name is John Haskel. - He split. Long gone. - He left some deep wounds. - Maybe that's where they're headed. - Maybe. We located Jim Gilroy's car. Two hours south of here in Springdale, Arkansas. Got a call from the caretaker. He was coming to drop off some fertilizer. - How long ago? - Three hours ago. Maybe a little more. - Get it out of there. - What's the rush? Crank it up, Roy. Come on. It's Jim Gilroy. Get a stretcher over here. Where's the main house from here? A hundred yards over there, but there's nobody home. - They're dead, aren't they? - Yeah. - We're right back where we started. - No. We have someone to talk to. We're going to find him. You happy? Yeah. - Then prove it. - Bobby, no. Bobby. Stop it. No. Bobby. Stop, please. I've never been clear on why they call it "making love. " Every time I let Bobby have me, it felt more like like "making peace. " You know, killing... killing time. A few precious minutes to myself. I found out my real dad had hit my mom a couple of times. Then she took up with Jim and he just hit her more often. I can't stop blaming myself for what happened to my mom. When she found out what Jim had done to me, she just... She couldn't live with it. I know I'm guilty for letting what happened happen. If I didn't stay in that car, I knew I'd never see Angel again. - I ain't talking. - Who put you in the trunk? - I don't remember. - Do you know who killed the Nesmiths? - Never heard of them. - The people on that farm. I don't know nothing. I was in the trunk. - Why'd they try to kill you? - Can I get a soda? - Who was Maddie riding with? - What's that? - You know who she is. - No, I don't. - I know you. - Really? You used to live at 898 Gadsden Place, Newport News, Virginia. You worked at a mill by the docks. You drove a '73 Impala. Your name is Jake Waterston and you killed three women there. So you have no reason to lie. I want to help you. Really, I do. They left me in the trunk. If it wasn't for that air pocket, I'd be dead. - D'you think of that? - Yeah, but not the way you do. Who's riding with Maddie? She was with her boyfriend, Bobby Webber. Why did Webber assault you? I wasn't ready for him. - What did you do to Maddie? - Nothing. - You killed her mother. - Killean committed suicide. You let her. You watched. You perpetrated the abuse on Maddie. Who's Angel? - What do you have? - I've located Maddie's father. Where? He was an inmate at the Fond Du Lac Correctional Institute in Waupan. He died there a year ago. - Where's he buried? - No one claimed the body. The Department of Corrections leases some plots near the prison. Grave is unmarked. So, either she doesn't know that her father is dead or she's... She's after something else. The Newport News Virginia DA sends his best. He's starting extradition proceedings to get Waterston back. He didn't get away this time, Frank. - This isn't finished. - Take away her father as a destination, - that doesn't leave much. - She knows he's dead. She wrote half a dozen very intimate letters to him, yet she stayed in the car watching the violence she's seen all her life. - Were any letters written after his death? - Yes, but the language was present tense. Almost a confession, or an oral history to him, or... What is it, Frank? I need Maddie Haskel's medical records. I think I know what she's after. I think I know who Angel is. Anything yet? No. No sign of that pick-up on the wire. They're long gone. Peter. What do you have? Maddie Haskel gave birth to a baby boy in St Mary's Hospital, Joplin, one year ago. Father unspecified. What happened to this baby? - Can we access Gilroy's bank records? - Yeah. I just need a phone line. Go faster. What are you going to say to him? I don't know. Gilroy maintained a fairly erratic bank balance over the last couple of years. Ten months ago a transfer of $7,000 was made into an account in Gilroy's name. That's two months after Maddie's baby was born. Gilroy took Maddie's child and sold it and bought himself a TV. It's sick, but it's a motive. That explains why "Angel" was scratched into the television screen. - He sold the baby so he could buy a TV. - He wanted something and... - Children have become currency. - That explains why she was in that car. Who transferred the funds to Gilroy's account? Rudolph Barnard, lawyer, lives in Little Rock. Gilroy takes Maddie's baby and has Barnard broker a deal to sell it. They're still after the same goal and anyone in their way is going to die. I'll tell Little Rock PD to put Barnard into protective custody. Run a check on Barnard's bank records. There would have been a transfer made by the adopting family. We might be able to get to them before Bobby does. All for the love of her child. Look at this place. It's beautiful. Angel must love living here. Maddie, your boy's just one year old. He don't know. Let's just go in there, get him, and get out of here. Don't forget the flowers. He must love it here. - Have the Travises been called? - Line's dead. PD is responding. - Yes? - Flowers for Mrs Adeline Travis. Get back. - We don't have anything. - You do. You got Maddie's boy. - Who was it, Wade? - Lock the door. Stay up there. You better get your ass down here, Adeline. - Who are you? - You come down here now. Come on. - My God. - Come on. Come on now. - Give her the kid. - No. Why? - Because he's hers. You stole him. - No. We adopted him. - Don't lie to me. - It was legal. I have the papers. Give her the damn boy now. Hi, Angel. - Momma's right here. - Come on, Maddie, let's go. - Have you been a good boy? - Come on, Maddie. Look at how big you got. And you have your granddaddy's big eyes. Maddie. Now. - Thank you. - What the hell are you doing? - Angel belongs here, Bobby. - Not after all this, he doesn't. Come on, let's just go. Bobby, no. This is the Little Rock Police Department. See what you done? They won't shoot if I walk out holding the baby. Give me the kid. Give me the kid. Give me... Shots fired. Shots fired. Unit 9, you are code 10 until further... Halt. Hold. It's over, Maddie. That's Angel? Yeah. Bye-bye, my baby. I haven't seen my boy since that day. The Travises send me a picture once in a while. I asked them not to tell Angel anything about his mother. I don't want him knowing anything about me. I mean, I doubt if if anybody can love him like I do. But I had a feeling that day that a life with me wasn't a price my baby should pay. He'd have just grown up to be another Bobby or another Jim... another man like my father. I want a clean life for him. Least I had a hand in giving him that. You saved me that day. Only man in my life that ever did something nice for me. You need anything, Maddie? No. I appreciate your visiting me. If you get the time come back, if you can. - Bring your daughter. I'd love to meet her. - I will. You're gonna be all right. Time's up. I spend my time thinking of Angel. Praying he ain't thinking of me. I made this. You can put that down now if you like. There's a briefing scheduled for tomorrow morning. Oh, yes, I know. The mission involves three men ...who steal classified information and sell it to the highest bidder. In addition to the assignment you'll receive tomorrow morning, I want you to pay special attention to a certain member of the crew named Steven Wolfe. See that he's still alive after the mission is over. Is it likely to be difficult? Yes. No one knows about this but you and me, and make sure it stays that way. Above all, Steven is never to know anything about this conversation or about me. So what's so special about Steven Wolfe? Does it matter? Well, I just feel like I have a right to ask. He's my son. Frederick Borsos, one of the most dangerous terrorists in the hemisphere. This is as close as we've been able to get, so far. He's anxious to get his hands on a design for something called the CM-12 chip. It's the latest in smart missile guidance systems. It was developed at the Zylar Corporation. The prototype and the accompanying installation disk are in their vault. These three men have been casing Zylar for the last week. They plan to steal the CM-12 and sell it to Borsos. Their names are Vincent Shirov, Marco Dean, and Steven Wolfe. Our plan is to get the chip first, offer it to the crew for a cut of their profit on the sale to Borsos. When the exchange takes place, we'll take them all, Borsos and the crew. - Won't the crew be able to detect a fake? - Yes. We'll provide the real one. With Zylar's cooperation? Interfacing with the corporation presents too many security risks. We'll steal the chip instead, and we'll return it as soon as the mission is over. Any questions? Then let's get started. Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Go back, go back. Again. There! She's new, that guard. How'd you like to breach her security, huh? Found the storm drain. Runs under the east wing. It's got collapsible bulkheads every fifty feet. This place is really getting on my nerves. You know, why don't we just knock it off for a while. Borsos wants the CM-12. He wants it within 24 hours, or he'll get someone else to get it for him. Let's knock it off, get a bite to eat. We'll start again tomorrow with clear heads, okay? I'm for that. Hey, can I get a cup of coffee? Yours? Hi. My name's Nikita. I think we can do some business. Having to do with the CM-12. - I'm sorry, my mistake. - Wait. What makes you think we're interested? Well, you've been up. What is good in Western culture... I already have a plan. Already I have bring printing press here for printing. - What he said. - Yes I know Your Majesty but there's the... - Cut. Just cut. - lf I could just stay on-book a little longer... - Where the hell is my stage manager? How long does it take for a latte run? - Perhaps he fled the country. - Wise man. From the top. Faster. - You are school teacher? - Yes Majesty. When do I start my work? - I will tell you when I wish you to start. - Okay but there... This is ridiculous. They don't talk this fast on West Wing. That does it. Drop and give me 20. - Oh not again. - Hit the deck Baxworth. - I miss Evelyn. - You say something Alice? - Sir no sir! - For heaven's sake Mother. This is a theater not a battlefield. And there are ways to address an actor during the rehearsal process. Even a God-awful actor like Dr. Brown deserves encouragement. Directing requires precision and creativity inspiration and heart. Evelyn Rauser possesses all of those qualities. - And she's nice to us. - And she doesn't make us do pushups. I got an idea. Cue cards! Mother we're fed up. This is not boot camp. We do not wanna be treated like we're... All right everybody listen up. Either we do this my way or not at all. Anybody who doesn't like it can leave right now. I'm out of here. Good luck Mother. Listen Edna... Forget it doc. Leave me alone. Let's get a game going. Bright and Ted you're captains. - Ted you're first. - Dana. Ephram Brown. Ephram! Dude I picked you. - Why? - Move it Ephram. Come on. Todd. - What are you doing? - Picking my team. - Alex. - But you hate me. - No I don't. I like you. - Kurt. - Since when? - I've always been fond of you. I'm just... I'm shy you know? Al. - Name one thing you like about me. - Just one? How about a thousand? You're... You're sensitive extremely clean... Look Bright I know you hate me and I'm fine with it. It means the planets are aligned. So let's not mess with the universe okay? You wanna pick the next guy? - Speak up. - Louder! That's not whistling that's blowing. Yeah. I don't think so. Dr. Brown. I wasn't expecting to see you again until Friday. Come in. Would you like some tea doctor? I'm having some. No. No thanks. I was just checking in. Wanted to see how everything worked out with the Mayo Clinic. Well I'm going to Minnesota next Monday. - I appreciate all your string-pulling. - I'm happy to help. I feel as though I haven't done enough these past few weeks. What more could you do? So what are you really here for? You still having trouble with your lines? I think you should tell them Evelyn. These people care about you. - lf they knew what you're going through... - Then what? What they'd all come trotting by with their tins of baked goods? No thank you. I prefer my solitude. There's a certain dignity to it. - Don't you agree? - No I don't. There's no reason why you should have to go through this alone especially when it's so unnecessary. I have seen people in your position who had no friends or family who were forced to go through the pain and the loneliness of sickness. But you are choosing it. And I don't understand that. It's okay to let them see that you're human. Excuse me? Look I know what it's like. People think of you as this god and worship you to the point where they turn you into something that you can't ever really be. That you shouldn't have to be. You don't have to be perfect Evelyn. You can be sick. They'll still love you. In fact they'll probably love you even more for it. I appreciate the sentiment but these people need me to be their hero and I love playing the role. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy the adoration of the masses but I do. Where's the harm? In the end everybody gets what they want. What if you don't get better? Then what? Then everybody will get what they've always had an idea of me. Well Edna is your friend and she's working her ass off right now trying to be you when she has no idea that it's all smoke and mirrors. Is that fair? There are lots of things in life that aren't fair darling. And you of all people should know that. Hey Ephram you want a ride? No I'm okay. I'm gonna ride my bike. We can put it in back man. Just hop in. No. I mean I'm fine. Really. Maybe he wants to ride his bike Colin. Well why would he wanna do that? Come on we can make room. Amy can sit in my lap I... Yeah I don't need a ride. Okay? I don't need to be sitting at your tables or playing on your teams. Dude what is your problem? You're my problem dude. Look my dad helped you. If you wanna thank him be my guest. I had nothing to do with it. Leave me alone. Believe it or not I have no interest in being your charity case. It's not like that man. Yeah it is. Trust me. You and I we have nothing in common. If you want go back to the way it was. You all ignore me and I will be more than happy to do the same. Okay? All of you. I tried to tell you man. He's a wack job. Amy get in the truck. - I don't suppose you serve margaritas. - Evelyn? I'll have what she's having please. I thought you were in New York. - Your note said you had gone... - About the note... It's full of bull. I'm a fantastic liar. Well the joke's on you because it turns out I'm a lousy director. I single-handedly ruined your musical. I'm sure it's safe to assume that you did not single-handedly ruin anything. In fact I'm certain that you had help in the destruction of Siam. The truth is I tried. I just couldn't do it. I'm not you Evelyn. No. No you most certainly are not. You're better. You're real Edna. Real people make mistakes. They fall down on the world and they pick themselves up bloodied knees and all. I just wanted it to be perfect you know? I didn't pick you to direct my play because I thought you were gonna be perfect. In fact I chose you because I knew you wouldn't be and that you wouldn't let it stop you. I heard that I made a teeny-weeny casting faux pas. Oh boy. - So you wouldn't mind if I...? - Darling the play is yours. Do with it what you wish. You probably shouldn't drink that. Well nobody's perfect. Well looks normal to me sweetheart. What exactly is it that's bothering you? Is it a sore throat? Tummy ache? Let's see. I've been having hot flashes insomnia and "osteorosis." That does sound serious. I thought so too. And it might even be contagious. I probably shouldn't be around people for a while. Well menopause isn't normally contagious honey. But then again it's also rare for it to occur in 9-year-old girls. There's a first time for everything. Well I guess we'll have to get you to a hospital. Take some blood tests run a few CAT scans. Blood tests? Like with needles? - Oh yeah. Big ones. - Dad maybe I don't have menopause. Oh really? Something else then? Maybe I just don't wanna do the play anymore. Why sweetheart? Because what if I stink? Then all those people will boo at me. If they boo at anybody it'll be the guy who can't remember his lines. Trust me you're not gonna stink. Well maybe I won't stink as bad as you but even still I could forget everything even how to sing. Do you remember when Uncle Brian was here and I had to do brain surgery again and I hadn't done it in a long time? - I was scared. - You were? I was terrified. I thought I was gonna forget how to do everything. I woke up that morning and I thought "There's no way. I can't do this." - You seemed okay to me. - Well that's what I wanted you to think. But I was faking. I pretended that I was okay when deep down I was really afraid. Next thing I knew I was in the hospital room doing brain surgery. And you know what? I got so good at pretending to be fine that I actually was. It's called "fake it till you make it." - Like my song says. - What song? - In the play. - Oh yeah. Fake it till you make it. I can do that. I know you can. - Your mom would be so proud of you. - Really? Really. - Good night sweetheart. - Good night Dad. You really think I'm gonna stink? - Can I talk to you for a second? - I thought we already finished this. Not exactly. I lied to you Ephram. I acted like the reason I was gonna be your friend was because of your dad but it's not. It's something else. All right. Let's hear it. I don't know you. But more importantly is you don't know me. You're the only person in this school who doesn't expect me to remember them or expect me to be this guy that I don't even know who he was. And I'm trying to please all these people but it's wearing me out man. I can understand that. But it's different with you because you don't have any expectations. And I don't have to feel guilty for not knowing you. See in a way I mean you know we're both new. And you look about as out of place as I feel which is probably why I approached you. But what I don't get is why you don't like me. Who said I didn't like you? Well it's obvious you don't like hanging around me. Is there a reason? No. No reason. We're cool. Cool. So let's talk about this "E" thing. Who came up with that? Probably Bright. Right. Hello everyone. Okay then. - You look nice today Baxworth. - I do? Yeah. Radiant. - Thank you Edna. - And Alice... Sir yes sir. You make a fine Tuptim. I like what you've done with the part. I should have told you that before. I'm sorry if I haven't been very... Nice? Encouraging. Private! I don't think I have to tell you what great work you're doing. You really had me convinced you're a boy on that stage and it freaks me out. - Thanks Edna. - And Dr. Brown? - Yes? - You're fired. - I'm what? - Executive decision. Had to be made. I'd appreciate it if you'd turn in your walking papers and exit without too much of a fuss. But I was making so much progress. How many children does Your Majesty have? Thirty-seven? - Junior! - Six! How do you feel about playing the King of Siam? - Who's offering? - I am. Gee Mother I don't know. Spielberg's heard of my work as the understudy. - We're in talks. - Come on Junior! The play needs you. Well I suppose the show must go on. Wouldn't want to let down Everwood's theater-going community. All right people. Swallow that last bite of crumb cake. We've got a dress rehearsal to get on. Delia was never in Romeo and Juliet. She was not the girl in Sleepless in Seattle. - She wasn't even born when it came out. - lf you're gonna dream dream big. Dr. Brown? - Hey Colin. How you feeling? - Pretty good. Look I know my parents probably sent you enough gift baskets to last a lifetime but I guess I just wanted to come by and thank you myself. You just keep doing what you're doing. That's all the thanks I need. Ephram do you wanna come sit with us? We saved a few extra seats. No. No thanks. I'm just gonna chill here with my dad. - Okay. - Catch you later. - You two friends now? - Kind of. - Turns out we have some stuff in common. - You mean Amy? - Surprisingly it has nothing to do with Amy. - So why don't you sit with him? Because of Amy. So who's this Evelyn Rauser? - Why do you ask? - Well I don't know. - The play's dedicated to her. Is she famous? - She's something of a legend around here. - She the reason you got fired? - I did not get fired. I chose to step down from the role. Artistic differences. Dad? It's nice to know you're not awesome at everything. All right troops fall in! She means form a line morons. I'll make this brief as we've got civilians out there waiting to be entertained. You've all worked hard. You've worked long. You've struggled against formidable odds to get where you are tonight. I'd be proud to lead you into battle anytime anyplace. That's all. Go get them soldiers. And good luck. I thought it was bad luck to say "good luck." It is but let's not tell her that. Places everybody! Evelyn Rauser had an expression for the few seconds before the curtain went up. She called it "the holy time." But you don't have to be an actor to know what the holy time feels like. It's that breath you take just seconds before you become the person you're meant to become. For some people, it feels like forever. And for some, it's a moment over far too fast. [ENGLISH] I wonder if the Philosopher's Stone would be in a desolate town like this. It almost seems like a lie that up until just recently, this town was prosperous from gold. Which is why they would be that much more likely to research the Philosopher's Stone. What do you mean? Since they stopped being able to get gold out of the mines, they'd want to transmute it with the Philosopher's Stone that much more. This used to be a gold producing area, and all, so if they created just a little, no one would find them out, right? It's terrible the way grown-ups think. Elisa! Hey, everyone, give me a hand here! It's no use! It won't budge! Papa... It's all right. We're going to help you out of there no matter what! What's the matter? My daughter is pinned! Just be patient for a bit, okay? Man cannot obtain anything without first sacrificing something. In order to obtain anything, something of equal value is required. That is alchemy's Law of Equivalent Exchange. At the time, we believed that to be the true way of the world. Wow, to think that an alchemist would come along! You really came through for us! Thanks to his armored father, too! No, no, we're brothers, actually. This is my younger brother. Younger brother? Even though he's bigger than you, Big Brother? Anyhow, we're glad that you weren't hurt, Elisa. Elisa! Is Elisa all right! ? Uncle Belsio! Papa...? Look, you... How dare you come into my house! After making Elisa help you out like that! Listen to me, Elisa. No matter what anyone tells you, you can't help Belsio out in his work any more! No! It wasn't Uncle Belsio's fault! I asked him to let me help out! I-I'm sorry, Elisa! Here, drink this. I'm sorry. Uncle Belsio told me that your lemon pies were the best, Papa. And that it was a shame that there were so few farms left in town. Hey now, once the Philosopher's Stone is finished, the town will become prosperous! Then, we'll be able to buy our fruit! Philosopher's Stone! ? Right, right! You two came to assist Mugwar in his research, right? To create a Philosopher's Stone? Alchemist, please create the Philosopher's Stone as soon as you can! We want to get back our town of gold, Xenotime, no matter what! We're depending on you, Master Alchemist! It looks like there's a lot to this. B-but in any case, I guess we'll go see this Mugwar person. By the way, if you would please tell us your names...? Our names? I'm Edward. Edward Elric. H-his brother, Alphonse. Alphonse Elric. The Elric Brothers? The State Alchemist ones? Yeah! What did you do that for! ? You hush! The real Elric Brothers are already up there! Come back when you've decided to be honest about your real names! Who is it that's been using my name, here? Brother, are you really planning to sneak in? Course I am! I'm going to catch that impostor, and have him tell me about the Philosopher's Stone while I'm at it. Brother? Was that...? A transmutative reaction. Look at this. This is all material on the Philosopher's Stone. So, this is where they're making the Philosopher's Stone, all right. No doubt about it. This place is off limits to unauthorized persons. By any chance, are you guys...? There you are, you imposters! Which would mean that you're the real Edward, huh? No! No! I'm Edward! Me! You're the older brother? Got any problem with that! ? Don't get so excited. The security guys will realize you're here. What do you know, the younger brother wears armor, huh? You sure don't look like you're fourteen. You know about us? What, you want to go at it? If you guys will go home quietly, I don't plan on fighting. Just let us stay here for a little while longer. Is that any attitude to be asking somebody for something with? Sit. Stop looking down on me! That would bother you, huh? Being only that tall, when you're fifteen? Automail, huh? The real one has his troubles too, it seems. By saying that, you sound as if you haven't just been living in idleness yourself! I'd like to have a look at the skill of a State Alchemist. You're gonna be sorry you did! Not bad. No transmutation circle, huh? Huh, the imposter doesn't use a transmutation circle either! ? Why, you! Have you got a Philosopher's Stone! ? What was that noise just now! ? This way! Damn! I ache all over. That imposter sure was strong, huh? It was just the Stone's power, after all. So, I wonder if they've completed a Philosopher's Stone yet. We're going to make sure we find out. I wonder what those brothers' names are. The two of them must have real names, after all. I wonder if the older brother is older than you, Brother. Don't go judging us just on our size! Brother, let's give this up, already. If those two tell what's really going on, what will we do? Don't worry. Nobody is going to believe what they say. Let's hurry and complete the Philosopher's Stone, and leave town. I hope it goes that smoothly. I won't let Mugwar get the credit for the research that Dad spent his whole life on. But... Don't worry. If it comes to that, I'll make sure that no matter what, at least you get away. Brother, you don't understand. That won't... make me happy... Are you sure you should be just standing there like that? You're here, are you? It seems some outsiders have appeared. Y-yes, but not to worry. The Elric Brothers have been chased away. I'm not so sure. Those boys could prove to be extraordinarily crafty. But then, having come to this point it's only a matter of time before the military comes to learn of the research. I think that maybe it's about time you pulled out, Mugwar. Please don't say that! Give me just a little more time, please! I promise you, I will complete the Philosopher's Stone! Hurry. Use any means that you have to. It's starting to swell up pretty good. It feels so good that you're so cold. I'm happy to be of use to you, Brother, even in this body. You were at the store this evening. If you have no place to stay, then come to my place. Thanks for helping us out. I couldn't let you children sleep outside. You're not going to ask us our names? You're the Elric Brothers, right? Then, you believe us? No. I just think that everyone has their own reasons. And I'm not the one who bears the responsibility for them. That's up to you. You don't appear to have any interest in the Philosopher's Stone, huh? The folks in this town are still unable to forget the wealth that gold has brought them. And Mugwar has them wrapped around his finger. Good morning, Uncle Belsio! If you keep coming to my place, you're going to get yelled at again by your pop. No problem, no problem! Papa is all wrapped up in talk about the gold mine. He won't notice. Good morning. Big Brothers, you're here...! Wow, that looks like it hurts! That's what you get for telling lies, huh? I'm telling you, we're not the ones who are lying. And yet I'm the one who gets clocked! You don't mean, you're the ones who snuck into Mugwar's mansion yesterday, Big Brothers? Of course it was us! We can't let those imposters get away with this, you know! And besides, using a Philosopher's Stone to make gold is no small matter. Brother... I'm going to go see what's happening in town. Brother! - Yes? - Hey, big guy! Would you go to the drugstore for me? I'd like for you to get Elisa's medicine, and your brother needs a compress too, right? Say, it's that armor. He's that impostor! Oh, dear! I wish he would hurry up and leave. I'll bet it was those boys that broke in to rob Mugwar's mansion last night. Hey, you! What have you come here for! ? I-I need to get some medicine... We don't have any medicine that treats liars! Go on! Go on! I give up. I can't buy any medicine like this. Um... You... I'll go buy your medicine for you. An equivalent exchange... to apologize for us lying. Here. Thank you very much. Both of us have it hard when our older brothers act rash, huh? Aren't you angry? You must have your reasons, right? I'm sorry. For us to participate in Mugwar's research, we needed to use names such as yours. To be a child, and still be a State Alchemist - the Elric Brothers are the only ones around. You need the Philosopher's Stone that badly? It's something that my dad spent his whole life researching. Then, your father was an alchemist, too? Mm-hmm. But then, one day, he was suddenly gone. That's why my brother is forcing himself to carry on after my dad. That's the complete opposite of our family. My brother hates our dad, who was also an alchemist. Our dad was completely absorbed in alchemy, and so our mom suffered because of it. We've also seen a bunch of other people who have met with sadness because of alchemy. Listen, if your brother is doing something wrong, then you're the only one who can stop him. You can't make others do it. If you do, I think your brother will be deeply hurt. I've been a little concerned about this, but aren't there a lot of people coughing around town? U-uh-huh. Is this cough medicine, then? I-it's... Brother...! Sorry, I have to go now. Hey, what's your name? Fletcher! Brother! ? What's the matter? The impostor is here! The older one! Have you seen him? Uh-uh. That bastard! What a hypocrite! He's been fixing the townspeople's hoes, and transmuting wheels for them! That's better than having him do bad things, though. I don't like the way he operates! He's ignoring the Law of Equivalent Exchange! Al, we're going to sneak in there again tonight! Even though it's the very next day! ? Because it's the very next day! Brother... There's something I want to talk about. Today, we're going with the mole-man campaign! Mole-man...? All right, we should just about be under the building now. Are you sure? Well, we're going to come out somewhere. We're there! What is this? Could it be... that this is the water that forms the base of the red stone. Red stone? I read some documents about it at the library in Central. It's a stone, made of a compound of roughly the same material as the Philosopher's Stone, which you get by refining red water. Then, you can make a Philosopher's Stone from this water? Apparently, it won't be the exact same thing, but yeah. As I remember, some alchemist named Nash-or-similar was researching it. But in the end, it didn't work out. Brother? For some reason, I suddenly feel... Brother! Brother! Over here! Who's there! ? It's me! Quickly! Hurry up! Fletcher... Brother, are you all right? Huh? What is this place? What are you doing here! ? I-I'm sorry... W-what? What are you crying about? Fletcher... If you know something, tell us. You really don't like what's going on here, do you? That red water... It's water that's very dangerous to humans. But it's vital for creating a red stone. You mean, the people in town are also coughing because of that? I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Geez, this is ridiculous. I'll just smash all of this up. I can't let you do that. We've finally raised up a red stone this far. My dad sacrificed himself for this. If his experiments go unfulfilled, he'll never be redeemed, right? What's so great about that half-baked rock? That sword is just a fake too, right? I'm going to mess you up, together with your rock! Mine is the genuine article! What! ? It's the red water. If you're showered with it, you're done for. You won't just lose consciousness! Fine! Brother! This is crazy! You're brother is right! Get out of here! No way! I'm not going to lose to someone who's chasing after his own pop! Fletcher! Fletcher, hang in there! Brother, Dad was researching the red water to bring happiness to people, right? And yet, what we're doing is making the people in town suffer, aren't we? Brother, you should have known this! It doesn't matter who gets credit, does it? Dad... Dad would not be happy about this! Fullmetal Alchemist! Episode 12: "Earth of Gravel, Part 2" Now that you've taken on the name of Edward Elric, are you prepared for the consequences! ? - Who is to fire the fatal shot? - I do not know his name. Only that he is a Jesuit sent from France for the purpose. Where is he now? Perhaps fled, or hidden by his fellow conspirators, but the king's life is yet in grave danger. What danger? He will be poisoned. So now it is poison? And who will do the deed, or do you not know that either? I know his name well. It is Sir George Wakeman. The queen's personal physician? ! He is the most honest and upright of men! He's a Papist, is he not? The queen's household is riddled with treason. If you're lying, I promise you, your torture will be cruel! Who wrote these? They were brought to me at the Royal Society by an honest Christian preacher named Israel Tonge... Never mind the Royal Society! Who wrote them? One who knows the conspirators intimately. His name is Titus Oates. The final rites of their black mass spoken, Jesuit priests, crazed with bloodlust, swept into the village to seize two young virgins - children of no more than eight years. Angels! - Torn from their mothers' arms! - Stop, Titus! I cannot listen! No, go on. What did these foul monsters do to their victims? The screams of burning innocents are a horrible thing, Israel! God save us! The Catholic religion is guilty of horrors beyond imagining! Kirkby must have acted by now. If not, England is lost. Where is Titus Oates? At your service, sir! Scholar, philosopher and loyal guardian of the flame of truth! My Lord Danby wishes to speak to you. As news of the king's death became known, 6,000 Catholics were to rise as one and slaughter us all in our beds. Picture it, my lord! London's streets running crimson with honest Protestant blood! How did you come by this information? I overheard it in the queen's household. Do you now claim intimacy with the queen herself? No, sir, but your lordship well knows that the palace is open to anyone that has business at court What does the French King know of this? That demom and the Pope are the authors of the plot! - I thought you said it was the queen and the Duke of York? - Papists all, shoulder to shoulder in villainy! There's not a moment to waste. The French army are massing at Calais. An invasion might be launched at any moment. I think my spies would have informed me if there was a French army at Calais. Perhaps the Pope invoked some dark magic to render them invisible. I need more than gossip and mischief! I will see all three of you in the stocks in the morning. - God have mercy, It is the truth! - If you condemn us Sir, the king will die and you will be held accountable. Your Majesty! Your loyalty and concern for my safety do you credit, Mr Oates. Where is your proof? Safely hidden from prying eyes, Your Majesty. A wise precaution. and tell me who are the English Catholics behind this terrible conspiracy? Give me names. Beyond the queen and the Duke of York, there are the Lords Stafford, Arundell, Wardour, Powis, Petre, Belasyse, Wakeman, the queen's physician, and Edward Coleman, secretary to the Duchess of York, among many others. This is nothing more than a list of every eminent Catholic in the land! I have letters proving their guilt. Follow me, Mr Oates. Bring your friends with you. You never said anything about letters! If I had, the Jesuits would have cut your throat to find them. Stand firm. We shall beat the devil yet. What was your business at Whitehall, Mr Oates? Who invited you here? I attended on your ministers many times to warn of the Catholic peril. Alas they never had time to see me. My sympathy. Sometimes they're so busy they hardly have time for the king himself. But still, after so many hours here, you must have come to know my palace well. Intimately, sir. Then you will have no difficulty in leading us to the place in the Queens house where you heard this treason being plotted. This is where I heard them planning your death, Your Majesty. Most convenient for any traitor with a weak stomach! Your Majesty, I remember it clearly. It was a long room... with tall double doors... You do not know your way because you've never been here in your life before! Nothing this scoundrel says can be believed! I'm off to Newmarket in the morning. Do not bother me with this again. At your service, my lord. (DANBY) Let me hear your explanation again Sir. I have known Lord Powis these many years. - This is not his hand. - The writing is disguised. - The Jesuits teach such skills to their disciples. - They teach well. Not one of these seditious letters resembles its author's customary hand. You say you know these conspirators intimately. - Who wrote this? - Lord Stafford. Of all these villains, he is the worst. Stafford is a distinguished Fellow of the Royal Society and nigh on 70 years old. He has a vicious spirit of a villain half his age and is closely allied to the Duke of York. Examine the Duke's household, and you will find all the evidence you need of treason. Strike now, my lords! Hesitate and all might be lost! Stop! There is no conspiracy, is there? Hm? The truth now, or I'll beat the life from you. Every word is gospel. Bring me a Bible and I will swear... I know baseless malice when I see it. What is your purpose in all this? - Is it money and preferment you seek? - You insult me, sir. Christ himself, he came to me in a dream! He charged me with the protection of the Protestant faith in England. I was a minister... in a Catholic school... and the boys laid false and filthy charges against me, and I lost my position. I'm determined to have my revenge on their whole stinking blasphemous faith! You have chosen the moment for your game well. In such a desperate time, even your ridiculous lies might be believed. What will you do with me, sir? I have reasons of my own to let your poison circulate unhindered. If others cannot tell a fake when they see one, that is their misfortune. What of the king? He doesn't believe me. The king has more pressing concerns, schoolmaster. 5,000 pounds on a single turn of the cards? ! If you shout at me, I shall faint. Now you expect me to honour your debts. Well, I cannot afford it! You have stolen my honour! Now you mean to make me a beggar! If you need money, why don't you ask your patron Louis? - The King of France gives me nothing. - Of course he does! - He values his little spy in my bedroom too much to neglect her. - I am not a spy! Do you think I don't know about your clandestine audiences with the French ambassador? What do you talk about, I wonder,the English weather? I cannot live with such wicked treatment! You know how delicate I am. If I fall ill and die, it will be your fault! You are not going to die over a few cross words. Of course I'll pay your creditors. But you must be more careful in future. 5,000 is not very much. Is it? We won't talk about it any more. There, now. It's all better, isn't it? The king still loves his little Fubs. These letters were for Louis. You say you will work to destroy the Protestant heresy and restore the Catholic faith to England, that you pray for the day the Duke of York takes the king's place! As God is my witness, I meant no harm to anyone. These are dreams, not plots. Opinions of no significance. You shared your ambitions with the Duke of York. He encouraged you in this! The Duke of York is innocent of any crime. I swear I am no traitor. (CHARLES) I asked you to end this matter. Now it is infinitely worse. What London believes is more important than the evidence. The mob will soon grow bored of Oates' ridiculous accusations. - Put the perjuring villain in prison. - He's under the protection of Parliament. Oates will give Parliament all the excuse it needs to strike at Catholics. God help any poor creature that gets caught in his net. Oates said Coleman's letters would contain treason, and they did. A lucky chance, nothing more. Picture your own wives and mothers, sons and daughters, tied to stakes in the midst of flames, screaming out to God with hands and eyes uplifted to heaven! On the outside the Catholic looks like us, eats, drinks and sleeps like us, but inside he is not as we are. He hates our liberty and works every moment to destroy it He would make slaves of us in our own country Only Parliament can protect England from the yoke of tyranny! A warrant from Parliament for the arrest of Lord Stafford. - On what charge? - Treason. - Father! - This is some error or false accusation... You are mistaken! Please! Please help me! No! No! No! Please! Please! Please! No! No! God in heaven have mercy on me! I am innocent... The queen is a Catholic and yet is well known for her loyalty and devotion. This plot cannot be any of her doing. She is mistress in her own household. Nothing takes place there without her consent. I heard from her own lips that she would no longer tolerate the king's lechery and violation of the marriage bed. She told the Jesuits that she would have her revenge, and promised them 5,000 pounds for the deed! I accuse the queen of conspiring to cause the king's death! The man's a fraud. I know you'd never do anything to harm me. You know it, but does England? Oates has the whole country terrified. You understand there is no truth in what he says? - Do I look like a fool? - Clever men hang on his every word. Common sense counts for little where religion is concerned. - Are you not frightened of the Papists, then? - I'm more frightened of the mob. - Mobs have their uses in the right cause. - Parliament's cause. For 20 years, we have fought to see who rules in England. Now the time has come to settle the matter once and for all. This useless body of mine is like some rotting piece of meat. It decays inch by inch, moment by moment. I have little time left, but I am determined that before I die, this country will be freed for ever from the unbridled power of kings. Parliament will rule in England. Attack the king himself, and I can go no further with you. Let the old goat frolic with his whores in the time he has left to him, but his heir will be Parliament's choice. The king loves you above all others. The bravest and most brilliant of his court. (MONMOUTH) Such virtues come naturally. I must take no credit for them. The king would show you greater favour if he could. He would name you as his heir. The Duke of York's claim cannot be allowed to stand. A Protestant king for a Protestant country. The king will never acknowledge me as his true-born son. The king must appear to support his brother. In private, he yearns for your success. When the tide in your favour becomes irresistible, he will bow to an act of Parliament declaring you legitimate. He told you this? Be bold, and you shall have your reward. God save the king! I have never run away from a fight and I will not start now. It's to avoid a fight that you must leave for a time. With the introduction of the House of Commons bill, your succession hangs in the balance. Your presence here is a constant reminder of their grievance. Will I be allowed to return, or will you betray me in favour of your preening bastard Monmouth? You're my brother... and my heir... and what is mine is mine. I will not allow Parliament to dictate the succession. Now for pity's sake, will you help me? Your Majesty, there is a further matter of the gravest importance. I have in my possession... letters from the king's chief minister begging for aid from our oldest and most implacable enemy! Filthy French money... for the king to rule alone in defiance of Parliament? ! What shall we call this but treason pure and simple? Danby must be impeached before this house for his dealings! It's that French bitch Carwell! Drag her out and put the Papist whore in the stocks where she belongs! Good people! You are mistaken! I am the Protestant whore! I am called a prostitute, and summoned before Middlesex jury! My God! To stand before the common herd, accused of being no better than a street girl! It is nothing more than a tactic designed by Shaftesbury to provoke me! I'll see that the Chief Justice strikes down the warrant. I am a lady of breeding... I have family and connection... - I am not a harlot! - I know that. They mean to destroy me, Fubs. Shaftesbury has copies of my letters referring to subsidies granted you by the French king. They talk of the secret treaties signed in your name, but there is no proof, thank God. He can be discredited as a liar. The king's position grows weaker every day. He has done everything in his power, but he can no longer defend your conduct. I wrote to the French king on your authority, Your Majesty. - You must stand by me. - You of all people know he cannot do that. Parliament is attacking him through you. His only hope is to cut you adrift. Acknowledge the letters were written on your own initiative. The king knew nothing of them. Parliament already has the scent of blood. I will be torn apart! If you resign, the king may yet come to some understanding with his enemies. I'm guilty of nothing more than obeying Your Majesty's command. These treaties were your creation in every detail! I know nothing of any secret treaty. I have put the king before everything, and you see my reward? Be careful loyalty does not bring you to the same end! Danby must pay the full price for his treason. (CHARLES) He has resigned. That is penalty enough. I have granted him a pardon for any offence he might have committed. You cannot do that. You have dragged a loyal servant down into the mud. I will not permit you to murder him into the bargain! There are thousands of your loyal subjects in the streets in protest at this Popish plot. We can only guess at what chaos will follow if you save the traitor Danby and allow a Catholic to succeed you on the throne. The people have been greatly excited by false rumours and accusations. You know that better than anyone, George. The peace of the country demands the Duke of York's removal from the succession. The peace of the country has always been my most pressing concern. Then name Monmouth as your heir. You must sign the bill excluding your brother from the throne. - Parliament has yet to pass such a bill. - It will. There can be no doubt of that. Accept what must be, sir. You have no choice but to abandon the Duke of York. He cannot defy the will of Parliament for ever. I will make him crawl to the House begging for exclusion. He is in a game he knows he cannot win. It is a question of WHEN he gives in, not if. Perhaps we must remind him of that. The mob yearns for blood. Very well. The mob must have it. Your Majesty... I come not as your king, Lord Stafford, but as your friend. And as your friend... I urge you to confess yourself guilty to the verdict of treason found against you. I'm innocent of any crime against Your Majesty in thought, word or deed. - I know that. - Then how can I say otherwise? Confess now and your life can be spared. A few false words... and in a year or two, a few months perhaps, you can return home to your daughter. I would be disgraced, condemned as a traitor from my own lips. All honest men would know the truth. I've been a loyal servant to your martyred father and to Your Majesty all my life... and that is how I shall die. You must sign. - It is the king's prerogative to grant mercy. - Not in such a case. What is a king, then... if he has no power? It is in order to preserve your power that you must sign. The whole of England is baying for Stafford's blood. If you do not give them what they want, they will turn their anger on you. Lord Stafford has been found guilty by the courts. Oates's lies condemned him. If you overturn the law, you give Parliament an excuse to do the same. That path leads to war and rebellion. Is that what we have come to? An innocent man must be sacrificed to preserve the sanctity of the law? Your father chose open defiance of Parliament, and the outcome was his own destruction. You must be more subtle than him. May God forgive me. God will understand. You have more confidence in him than I. My beloved daughter, your father has this comfort. I die totally innocent of what I am accused, and confident of God's mercy. You must take solace in that, as I do. You summoned me, sir? I've had many accounts of your progress about the country. I'm told that wherever you go, you are greeted as a king. Is it my fault if the people wish to express affection for me? You little fool! Can you not see how you are dancing to Shaftesbury's tune? - Do not treat me like a child! - You could not be more of a rebel if you took up arms and marched on Whitehall! You will never be king! Understand that, and you'll be happy. Dispute it, and you will die a miserable traitor's death. You lack experience and wisdom. But now you must do as I say. You will go to your cousin Mary in Holland... and stay there till I call for you. - I will do anything you tell me, Father. I would sooner die than insult you. On no account return to the court until I summon you, do you understand? Of all my children, you are the first and most beloved. Obey me... and we'll both be content. I never thought to see my oldest friend in the ranks of my enemy. It is a matter of politics. My personal feelings are of no importance. Personal feelings are everything to you. Shaftesbury has only the people's good at heart. He has no grievance against you. He is sincere in his convictions, but when did overturning kings become a pastime of yours? Perhaps when the king betrayed England for 30 pieces of French silver. - Your name was on the French treaty. - I did what was required of a good servant, and what did I receive in return? Lies, deception, the elevation of others above me in your government! We two together could have ruled Europe, let alone England! But you never trusted me as I deserved. Trust and good government cannot live side by side. You neglected me in favour of worthless placemen. I've forgiven your many betrayals... your schemes and your plots... because in my heart, I knew you loved me. But now I see you always loved yourself more. And I find I am a jealous king. I must have unconditional love or nothing. You have a need for sycophancy, not love. And those who rely on flatterers for their comfort are condemned to live and die alone. Tell your master Shaftesbury to summon Parliament. I will address the House. Then you accept the exclusion of your brother from the throne? What must be must be. Goodbye, George. I received your message. Is it time? Be brave, Charles. What if the king means to fight as his father did? He has too much intelligence and too few principles for that. And unlike his father, he knows when a battle is lost! Talk of the exclusion of the Duke of York from the rightful succession is treason. Any who speak of it set themselves against legitimate authority, and are the heirs in spirit to those rebels who so recently plunged our country into rebellion and civil war. Can anyone here contemplate such evil without horror? Let there be no confusion. The Duke of York is my heir and will remain so. His right is ordained by God, and no man may alter it. Anyone who denies this truth makes themselves an enemy of God, king and country. Think on that before you take another step towards chaos. All the world may see what a point we have come to. Nothing that begins in such division is likely to end well. I declare Parliament dissolved. Gentlemen, go home. I will not trouble you any further. What is happening? What did the king say? It is not what he said. It is what he is. England has chosen to trust the superstition of kings rather than the wisdom of its own judgment. He has dissolved Parliament and will rule in his own right. Exclusion and Parliament are finished with. Our time will come. Not today... but soon enough, though I will not live to see it. Wait here to be arrested... or make your peace with the king if you can. For my part, I am weary of Whitehall. I have neglected my wife these last 20 years. I think it is time I went home. He is never too busy to see me. The king gave you no authority to return from exile. Such defiance is treason. If you are still in England at dawn tomorrow morning, you will be arrested. How long? How long before I can come back? Never. Which tie would sir like to wear now? Spoilt for choice. So bloody wonderfully spoilt for choice. (MUSIC: HANDEL'S "MESSIAH") Missing Melinda? Yes. - She didn't go home to escape the war? - No. You were too much in love. No one steps back from love. Not even if there's a war on your doorstep. It was something I told her. What did you tell her? I told her about me. About what you do? Yes. I don't want you to tell anyone else about this. Don't tell Moscow. We can deal with this. Can't we? Can't we? This is highly irregular. What is it? - Has something happened? - Yes. You seem a little nervous. One of our mutual friends in trouble? I just wanted you to know there are no British agents working inside Russia. None. Anything else? I want out. I want to stop working for British Intelligence. I'm more tired than it's possible to be and my nerves are shot. - Moscow doesn't let well-placed men leave. - Unless they're better-placed elsewhere. - For example? - The royal family, chatting with the King. We've lost a man, or rather, he's in limbo. He worked for us, then he went quiet. You've changed the subject. We think he may have access to very important secrets and the responsibility has affected him. It can happen. A weaker man than you. Where is he? His name is Cairncross and he's working in Bletchley Park. I wonder if you might dig him up and see how he's feeling. If you did a good job, Moscow would look favorably on your request. I'm getting nods and winks. I think promotion is in the air. - Anthony? - I'm being followed. - Are you sure? - No, not entirely. Will you do something for me? Moscow wants me to visit a friend who's gone quiet. - Where? - Bletchley. Tomorrow. I want you to follow me. And see who else is forming a queue behind Anthony Blunt. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Mind the doors! Stand clear! Mind the doors! - I know who they are. - Is the game up? Are they MI5? They're Soviet, Anthony. They're Soviet. Bletchley is half a mile from here. Is there anything you said that could have been misinterpreted? - No. Nothing. - I don't understand. Why? - The look on his face. - Who? What? Henry. When I told him Britain had no agents inside Russia. His look was disbelief. - But it's true. - I know it's true. But Moscow has an ego that doesn't believe that Britain isn't paying them attention. - They think we're lying? - Feeding them disinformation. - They think we might be... - Double-crossing them. Moles? What do we do? Tell them we're not? No. We'll make sure we get the biggest secret there is and pass it on. If a gift is large enough, it always comes with love, and they'll see that. I know why you're here. It must be a lonely life. 12-hour shifts of code breaking and then back here to the gas fire and the crossword and damp bread for tea. You won't get at me. I've made my mind up. Are you thinking straight? Codes, codes, codes. It must dominate the mind. It's very simple. The Red Army is hopelessly infiltrated by German spies. If we tell the Soviets what we're getting from Enigma, the Germans will pick it up. Have you seen the casualty figures? 30,000 a week on the Eastern front. 30,000 Russians every week. I think there's a moral obligation to help them. But I understand. Your world is small. I don't blame you for not seeing the moral perspective. It's winning us the war! Breaking the code. We know so much about what the Germans are doing, and if the Germans find out and change the code... that would damage us very, very badly. Us? The 30,000 are us too. Aren't they? If the average Russian weren't prepared to die fighting the Fascists, Hitler would be in Downing Street now. Churchill doesn't mind if Russians die in their millions because they're not "us". That's his moral perspective. "Let the Reds die." The answer is no. I won't do it. That's my choice. The answer is not no. The answer is you made a bigger choice some time ago to work for Moscow to fight Fascism. And that doesn't go away...ever. I hope you understand that. - Are you threatening me? - Of course. Of course I am. Not tonight, Jack. - It used to be so exciting. - Sex? - Spying. - I don't like that word. It's so underhand. Excitement was one of the main reasons for doing it - apart from the good reason. The whiff of danger, all that. I think I've been running away from boredom all my life. A flight from ennui. - It's funny... - Funny? You, I talk to. Is it getting too much? Anthony... Is it? Look at me. Look at me. Melinda. I lost the baby, Donald. He died. - He was born and he died. - He? - We missed you yesterday. - I went to see an old friend who's unwell. Would you mind, Angleton? Walter Krivitsky. He's with the Soviet Embassy in Washington. - Or he was. - Where is he now? He's coming over to us and we've got a taster. We've got a mole inside the British intelligence services. Does he give a name? A tall, fair Scot with bohemian tastes from a well-to-do family. - No name? - Not yet. - Is he the real thing? - We're checking. We have Krivitsky holed up in a hotel in Washington. A tall, fair Scot. Bohemian tastes. Any ideas? Can I have a look at the file? Krivitsky. To D-Day - the start of the end of the war. - I didn't know you two knew each other. - Americans in London. We're a couple of swells, we stay in the best ho... Hello, darling. - Drink? - Uh-huh. Happy again. Dangerous thing - happiness. - We should have dinner. - Donald's very busy. - Just the two of us. - He's the jealous type. So tell him you're meeting a woman. How about it, Melinda? A couple of swells and a hell of a dame. (MELINDA) Kim. Excuse me. What was all that about today at the office? - It's secret. - Secret? It must be something big if the Yank is not permitted to know. But not so secret that Mr. Blunt can't hear it. - A tall, fair Scot with bohemian tastes. - Donald. Donald. Krivitsky will have to be taken care of. Few people know of his intended defection and I'm one of the few. If he is "taken care of", some others - not many - and me. We have no choice. If he identifies Donald, we all go down. We're like skittles - one goes, we all go. - The domino effect. - Dominoes, skittles - we fall together. No choice, Kim. We're in this together. Moscow will have to be told. And don't tell Donald. You look like a ghost walked through you. Cheer up, Anthony. It could be worse. I need to pass water. Shut up, can you? Just shut up. You always kept parts of your life in separate compartments. Painting, spying, sex...royalty. You can close a compartment down and it's as if it's never been there. But this time it's your friends that you're trying to close down. And they don't belong in one of your compartments. They're your heart. You're closing down your heart. That's the end of life. - Guy... - Top secret. Private. - Guy... - Quick. Out. Whelk? Don't you Soviets understand English any more? Would you like a fucking whelk? Do you know what that is? A list of agents we're dropping into Albania by parachute. Where, when, who. And it's all yours, Boris. So Moscow can arrange to catch them as they fall. Bumpy landing, eh, Boris? Out of the sky and into the arms of death. Bump 'em off, Boris! Bump-bloody-bump! Walter Krivitsky, Washington. Your embassy thinks he's on leave, but he's in a hotel. If the Americans think he's the real thing, he'll defect. You know which hotel? Yes, I do. We're grateful. Moscow is grateful. Thank you. There is something delicate we would like you to undertake on our behalf. It's a retrieval job. And it concerns the Duke of Windsor - my fool brother - and some letters he wrote to a relative in Germany. What kind of letters? Letters that speak of his love for Germany and his... fondness for Herr Hitler. Letters we should like to have under our control. It would be an honor. Here's a note authorizing you to take possession of the letters. I know that we can rely upon your finesse in retrieving them and your tact once you have brought them home. - The hush-hush work... - If you do this for us... it will be the last hush-hush thing you do. I shall see to that. I don't care if the Queen of Sheba has given you authorization. This castle is American territory in Germany and we decide what stays and what goes. - Would you at least call your HQ? - This is my HQ. Then call your commanding officer. Wait there. - Head for the attic. - Why the attic? Aristocratic families are all the same - secrets at the top of the house. Bad news, I'm afraid. My CO says nothing leaves. I understand. I quite understand. Has anyone ever told you how beautiful you are? We are very grateful. We should like you to accept a position. Surveyor of the King's Pictures. Welcome to the family. - Did you manage to...? - No more hush-hush. Thank you, sir. - Safer life in art. - Yes, sir. Much safer. (DOOR CRASHES) (LOUD JAZZ MUSIC ON RADIO ) You heard? - Suicide. There was a note. - Three young children left. - You should have looked after him better. - What? He was in Washington. He was your man. a girl's life! If anything happens to her, I'll hang myself in front of this station. Stop it man! Are you the Home Minister to order us? It concerns not only your daughter... But 6 people are missing from this City. All of them are equal to us. I don't want to hear your excuses. Showing your anger on the SI? This Police station is not your dad's property to order us! Then, is this your dad's property? The khaki Uniform you wear and the food you eat, are the sweat of the people like me. The Government has granted you this uniform to protect people like me. I'll show you why the Government has granted us this uniform! Disrespecting the Policemen! Kill me! Get away. Ouchl! Hello! Yes! Where are you calling from? Tell me the spot! What happened? Oh! Okay! Where's Gopi? He's not yet come. He's on his way. Not yet come? Ugh! The tanker turned turtle. Get moving... Give way to Ambulance. Move away from there. Get the Stretcher... Make it quick. Quick...

Around 15 minutes, sir! Move... Move away Ramesh, there are leakages at two spots! Do one thing. Move the fire engine from the spot. Fuel is full tank. Gas already spread enormously. Get the wood pieces and Pneumatic tape from the fire Engine. Without switching off the Engine, Park it afar and then only cool the water. Come on, speed up.. Don't switch off the Engine. Take it reverse... speed up...speed up. Get in... Move... Move.. Get the gas detector and check how far it has been spread Come on, speed up.. Move away... Move I say. You check over there. Move away... What nonsense are you doing? Switch off your mobiles. It's LPG which is leaking! Even a small spark will reduce everything to ashes. Stand awaymStand away, I say. Evacuate them Alwyn, tape set? Yes, sir. Get two more units of Engines. Up to 3D ms hug, gas has been spread. All the vehicles have to be removed from here. Bro, a tanker has overturned in Stadium road. The matter is very serious. Already called for the 3rd unit. Where are you right now? Lift it up! Come on... move it back... Back.. What has overturned? Petrol? No, LPG! Cooking gas, which is used for household purpose. Then, why is it leaking like Petrol? That's how Gas will leak. Stand away, man. For how long, am I asking you to evacuate these people? It's not a child play. Don't try to trivialize the situation. Including you, everybody must be moved 30 mts away. Even I'm trying my best. Don't be over smart! We know to do our duty. You try to seal the leak of the tanker. Sir, don't get enraged. Matter is not so simple as you imagine. For God's sake, please remove the people from here. Hey, move away. Chase them away What sort of guy he is? Charge and chase them away! Have you sealed all the holes? Are you sure, there are no other holes? - No, sir. Is it tight? AiYes, sir. Move the jeep away. No. Hey! Don't start the jeep. Please don't start... No. Give way, please. Oh my God! Come with me. Sir, we shall also help you. I don't need any help Please save the people inside the Car. Come on, Hold her. Both of you check there. Take him to the hospital quickly. Check if anybody inside. Okay, sir. Come on, fast...m ove Connect one more hose quickly. Spray the water down! We'll carry him. Hold him. Sir, nobody is here. But some people are trapped in the Mall. Get that fire suit! Come out, if anybody is here.. Is anybody there? Come out... I say come out. Get out quickly. Come this way...this way. Move.. Bullet twist is theremtake it. Move out quickly. Call the next vehicle. What is the problem there? What's it? Brother, Pillai brother" Dispose the body. I asked you to dispose it. Have you checked the tanker? Go... Go. Dispose the body.. Shucks! What happened? Fire has been put off. Fire force is active. S.l reached the spot first. Sir, the incident occurred in this area. The tanker turned turtle over there. It's really serious. There are leakages on all the four sides. And also cracked below which is not visible Probably gas would've spread out everywhere. Bro, it's beyond our control. It'll take 5.6 hrs for people from Refinery to reach here! Don't panic. Try to cool down the tanker first. But bro... Listen, we're here to handle the danger, and not to get panicky. Until the Tanker gets cool, pump water from all 4 sides. Whatever may happen, we can't go from here without finding a solution! Don't make the situation worse with unnecessary tension! We must handle this at any cost. Record the direction and speed of the wind from all 4 sides, and submit the readings to me right now. Mark it clearly up to where the gas is spread at this moment. Go and cool the tanker. Sir, What do you like to say about this? This area is under the Police control! Chances are remote for another mishap! Fire Force has completely put off the fire in that area. I've nothing more to say than this. We're searching for the Car driver. We've not found him yet. He is missing. The Commissioner has already started. He will reach the spot immediately. Sir, you can give the interview later. Evacuate all the people who are in our vicinity. Fire is put off, right? Then why? Sir, gas has spread all over the area. All of you, including you, should move at least 300 mts away from here! But we don't smell any gas here. Don't talk senselessly! Only the Cooking gas at home smells! But the gas from the refinery is odourless and colorless! Only the Gas Leak detector can find that out! Then, why didn't the tanker explode? Are you waiting for the tanker to explode? Leakages were sealed using tapes before the tanker could blast Not even a spark entered in! If it had entered, then it would've exploded that moment itself. Look, droplets, which are falling down is the Gas. Within minutes, like a vapour It'll be spread out completely. In this circumstance, fire can break out from anywhere. Even a small friction of stone against the shoe, can cause a spark If you make people move away from here, at least that much casualties can be reduced! Sir, pleasel. Move away the people. Get going quickly. Wind speed is very high Gas is spreading faster than our expectation! What was the reading? Around 20 AI 25 mts. Please let us inside. We're Press reporters. We're doing our duty. Media can report this later As it's too dangerous, we are evacuating. No one should enter here. Sir, please, we want to cover the news. Madammjust a minute, madam. Move away, please. Who's in charge of the Fire Force unit? Few Firemen were killed in the first blast. Now, Station officer Vijay is the Unit lead. Call him. The Commissioner has arrived! You have to report to her. Vijay, what's the situation here? I've no time to explain it to each and every officer. Gas is spreading in the wind's direction! Starting from the houses and flats in East west, all the people have to be evacuated, within 1 km radius. How is that possible in a short time? There are more than 500 houses here. It's a hard task to evacuate the entire area. It's not a question of hard or soft! Decide whether people living within 1km, radius should live or die! I mean, not to waste even a second. Madam, The time is 6,360 clock now. By half an hour... at 6.30 is the Sunset. The possibility of a spark is much higher during this time. All the houses normally switch on the lights or light lamps now. Just a spark... Just a spark is enough to reduce the entire area to ashes. Every minute that we waste on thinking... is equal to spreading danger to thousands of lives. Come on...quick...please. But for that, I require at least lG's consent! Madam, as per protocol to obey, I reported to you. In 2 minutes time, no matter whether you give consent or not, I'll clear this area. This area where madam and I stand, Is also in the danger zone. Mind it. Okay Vijay, give me a minute. But madam, we are waiting for nearly 3 hours. We desperately need some information. The situations are very critical. Permission denied for News coverage or any such thing! It's the special order of the Commissioner. Please, you people must cooperate with us. What's that highly secretive mission? We're not Criminals, but the Journalists. We need to come inside at any cost! I politely explained you the situation. What's happening here? We've been waiting since morning. We need to cover the news. See, if the news is divulged, it'll create panic among the public and nothing else will happen So, please, try and co-operate. Madam, a problem! Please come immediately. What's it now? Mission spot. This area is supposed to be evacuated. How is that possible? Call Vijay. AI Yes, madam. Yes, madam. One minute. Evacuation is quite impossible in such a short time. Why, madam? Based on the Wind direction, the area which you insisted us to evacuate, this Compound wall which is seen approximately at 0.5 kms radius, is the Central Jail. If this area has to be evacuated, then jail also has to be evacuated, which is impossible. We require Cabinet's order, Home Minister's special order... Also the Magistrate's Consent, Apart from all these, We must find a safer place to move them. Come on, give me another solution. Next option. We've no other option in such a crucial situation. The only option which we can try is, experts from the Refinery has to refill this gas to another tanker. But it will nearly take 5hrs for them to reach. Do we've to take the high risk of waiting for them? What do you mean? Unleash more than 400 prisoners like unbridling the Cattle! Will you shut up! Don't talk nonsense! For God's sake, Vijay, give me a solution. The other option is quite risky. Staking the life of prisoners! Last minute suggestion. Apart from us, no one should be aware of the risk of the jail. All are aware of the Jail here. How do we hide it? One, from this moment, whatever we say, is the danger zone. Two, media must not be aware of this for any reasons. First we have to clear the surrounding area of the jail to a danger free zone. A little stronger evacuation. Not only the people from the houses, but also the flammable objects like Electric batteries ,ignition coils... everything must be driven out. Then, power out the entire area. If so, we can reduce the risk of danger. In the meantime, you can forward the permission procedures for evacuating the jail. Sir, one minute. Excuse me. We may require 2.3 more units also. There is no sign of the tanker getting cool. Why don't we prevent the leakage using wooden pieces? Crack is at the bottom of the tanker. We can't do anything, until the tanker is lifted up with a Crane. As the tanker is too hot, and if moved, pressure will mount up. We've no other option other than cooling it down. But the speed of the wind varies constantly. There are signs of rainfall also. The situation doesn't seem to be under control. Area evacuation must be done immediately. Keep me posted on the situation. Madam, what happened? What's your decision? I must inform the risk of the jail to my higher authorities. Only they've the authority to issue the order. I already told you, This is not the appropriate time to comply with the rules. Do or die! That is the situation here. Either evacuate or let all of us die. What can we do, if we don't receive a responsible order'? Such a situation is happening for the first time. I don't mean the prisoners. Why this loggerheads in protecting thousands of lives? One more thing. Fire Force has the right to make own decisions in such a crucial cases! With that loophole, I begin the evacuation, what's your stand? But listen" Madam, I don't need any reasons. Here onwards, I'm going to take the command. Taking the Command? You can't decide as per your will! There are certain procedures for everything. You blast it Let me mind my business. You mind your business! We know to handle the things here. Then, you handle it. Until now, you handled it, did you? Please Vijay, please wait. The situation is more critical. One minute. Look at this! 21 people died. 64 people were burnt. This happened after a small spark created the earlier blast. Similarly, if there's another blast, within 1 km radius where the gas is spread, Definitely around 1000 or 10000 people will die. Who'll be answerable for that? Without understanding the situation, needlessly with your ego and protocol... If I've to lead this mission, There shouldn't be any movement without my instruction. No one should question me, until it's done. Whoever it's, Media, politicians or authorities... Nobody should be permitted to enter this zone. This rule implies to all. I'll handle the rest. I can handle. Hereafter it's your wish, Madam! All units... Commissioner, copy. Fireman Vijay will have full command till the end of this operation. Now the time is 6.10. We only have 20 minutes. By 20 mins, we must initially evacuate 300 mts. radius" That's" this area. Gas has spread in this area now. By 20 minutes, within 300 mts. radius, All the houses and commercial plots must be evacuated. We must first cut off electricity line. But if we do so, if the current goes, the next second, the... emergency lights in the houses will be switched on. Othenlvise, emergency battery will be ignited. If that happens, that moment, fire will spread out. So only after alerting the people, to switch off the battery equipments, people have to be evacuated. How do you expect the evacuation process to be? Do you've a plan? We must split into 3 teams. 254 03:11:16:13 To ensure the safety of the houses, the Fire force, should dormant all the igniting activities. Do you think these are practically possible? Only to make it possible we're here. Thirdly, we require the help of the people. I mean the team who's personally close to the people of this area. Only they can clearly explain the facts and convince them. If so, I know a person. People also know him by name! Who's that? Comrade Iqbal. Move this side. You can't go that side. Move away your vehicle.. I say move. The Commissioner wants you to be there urgently. You! I've seen you during the rescue operation. Yes, I was also there, sir. All the houses in that area must be evacuated in 20 mins. People will not immediately agree if told. But we need a team who can clearly explain the seriousness of the facts, and convince them in a peaceful way for evacuation. That'll not be a problem! I'll send the respective ward members of the area along with them. They will convince them. You go without fear. I shall arrange the people. Get moving! Don't you understand? All the respective ward Committee members must assemble here in 5 mins! As there's a committee meeting today, all of them would've assembled there. During such calamity, party people must come fonlvard and cooperate. Understand! And they're not only meant for organizing committee meeting and collecting funds. It's one of the problems of our Society! Committee members must reach here in 5 mins at any cost. Go quickly.. Call them" Madam, now you can order KSEB to switch off these lights. Only Fire Force's Spark arrested hydraulic lights, and soft density LED lights will be seen here. Instruct all mobile providers to block the network now. Come with me. Almost everything seems to be settled. 4 extra units have reached the spot. Can I go to the hospital? I must settle the bill. My duty hours are over. Duty hours are over for those who are standing there also. Fireman's duty is from the start of the operation to end! Go and attend to your work. Get g0ifl9- Check whether the water is sufficient in the tank. Check it. AI Okay, sir! Hey! Who's that? Don't go there. Hello! ... Hey, you! I told you not to go there. Hey Mr! Who's that fellow? Hello! Stand there. Turn the lights! Didn't I ask you not to stand here? Hello! Open the door! Hey, You! I say open the door. Hello! Who are you? For the last 6 hrs... I've been running behind you, looking for my daughter for 6 hours Within two hours... Within 2 hrs time, if you fail to reach my daughter here, I'll light this. As you're not aware of the depth of the danger" Please open the gate. Wasn't this fellow who created ruckus in the station this afternoon? Hello, come out! Better open the gate! Else, I will kick it open! Don't you hear me? Open the gate. Open I583! Hey, Don't kick... Hey open then Kick it open! I say, kick it open! Hey smash it Didn't I ask you not to kick it? I'll box your ears if you step forward. Don't be foolish! If he flicks the lighter, then, finished. You...me and this entire area! Not even that! Just the kick can cause sparks to spread fire! U56 your common SENSE. He is mad. What you're doing is also madness! If you really want to thrash him after kicking open go ahead. Come here! We must handle this situation calmly and wisely. Find out who's he and what is his intention. Sir, he's Narendran Achaary! He told me he lives in Kollam! He was upset about his daughter's illness this morning, He was already tired and weak. In fact, feeling empathy for him, I too accompanied him to the station. As he was in despair of the disappearance of his daughter, he also rebelled. It doesn't take much time for a person to lose one's composure. Please come with me. Hey, come. Sir... Sir.. Police have started to investigate seriously Please don't act rash Iy. We've to find your daughter and go back home Stay calm. Just cooperate with the police. that's it. Don't take any drastic steps as one or two policemen humiliated you. Like your daughter, Lives of hundreds of children are at stake by your threat! Sir, please trust me. Come out calmly. Nobody will trouble you. Or else that lighten. Throw that away. Come on sir, please... The entire Police force will help you. Thousands of lives are at stake... Knowing that very well, I stand here! As long as this is in my hand, this threat has power! Don't I need an assurance that Police force will recover my daughter'? That's why you are showing this respect to me. Can you deny that? Don't think I've committed a mistake. I put forth my demands only after meticulously calculating the risk. 50 cubic volume LPG tanker has turned turtle. 20% of gas was exploded in the first blast. Now, 9 cubicles LPG is filled within 1 km radius! It's more than enough for the whole city to reduce to ashes. Waiting for the refill and rescue is your only option now. It'll take 5 hrs time Are my calculations accurate? Only for these 5 hrs, I can mount pressure on you. After that, my threat will also have no significance, right sir'? Police who never cared about my daughtefs life and chastity, must at least deserve this. Let them also endure 1% of the mental agony I've gone through. Today, if I fail in this attempt, I don't wish to live I'll flick this. Shucks! Checkout! Please don't take any hasty steps. I'll try and resolve it. Please, calm down, calm down Now, you must have understood that my decision is right! Hey, you! What nonsense... Move away. Are you people crazy? One fellow is about to set ablaze You people... All of us are here risking our lives. Amidst that... is your secret operation! Who ordered you to plan such a secret operation? I already told it's not the time to show your complex and over smartness when I took up this task. If you have a specific plan for handling this situation, then go ahead. Leave me! To show your over smartness, you people drive the jeep and car left and right all the 365 days, prove it at that time. And not climb on that person's chest who is about to set ablaze! This is not like your Lathi charge! Call me after trying all your attempts. What should we do, if a man ill treats the policemen, and threatens to set ablaze. Vijay, we just did an extra cover support. It was a last minute charge! Ultimately, what happened? If the last minute charge had delayed a second, he could've blown up the whole area. It was a try. Please don't underestimate people. That man didn't come unintentionally and pose a threat. He has got a definite plan. Calculating the tanker's weight and space of the spreading gas. He posed a threat. And I think, he's a bit abnormal. We are not sure how he would react! Don't take a chance with him, please. Vijay, the situation grows more intense. Reporters have already cam ped about 500m away. This news will reach them any moment. We have to do something now! Our priority, is not to disclose the news about the jail. If they know, we'll have to face more terrific situations than this. The gravest problem and the threat, is thatAchaary himself! We must pacify him. That's also the integral part of the mission. It's no use torturing him! The only option to pacify him is, find out any hint of his daughter. Excuse me, madam. Yes! An emergency in the Jail! What's it? Prisoners have turned more violent, they somehow knew about the gas leakage. You must come there. Stop it! You cursed ones! Keep yelling! 500 m radius of the jail are still under the safe zone. But depending upon the Wind's speed, any moment, the gas may spread over here. One moment, remove all the flammable objects from the prisoner's cell. What element would they have to cause a spark? Anything madam. Beedi, match box, battery... even a metal plate is enough! Open it, Isay! Hey, Open it! I say open it othenlvise we'll be burnt down to ashes. Open it, I say. Open it, I say! We'll be burnt down to ashes. Hey break it man! Come on.. Open it, I say. Othewvise, I'll break it. Open it, I say. Hey, open it, we will burn you Policemen! Please open someone. Hey policeman, I'm telling you! No, Vijay. I'll not permit anybody to enter at this violent situation. It's really dangerous. See, it's like a stirred up a hornet's nest... It's hard to bring them under our control... let's move. If acted without understanding repercussion of the situation, there will even be bloodshed in the jail! It's needless for them to realize whether it's a gas leak or a disaster. Just an opportunity for them to escape. How can we simply keep watching it? I don't mean that. Let any political leaders or religious leader visit here. Explain and convince them the facts, We'll be able to do something. Let me talk to ADGP Give way... Give way.. Move...move What happened? Over there, sir. Let's go there. Move them away. Sir, entry is restricted Why? It's dangerous! Where is the Commissioner? Gone to visit Jail! AI I see! The situation in the s not as we imagine. Electricity should be cut immediately. No, Vijay. Whatever may be the reason, Electricity or Comm unication system should not be cut in jail. That's the Government rule. The matter is very serious. Folks and relatives of the prisoners have thronged before the gate. Sir, tomorrow is my son's parole! He hasn't committed any crime. Please let him free! He's my only son! If anything happens to him, I'll hang myself here. Move away" Those who are confined inside are also human beings, if anything happens to them... Sir, don't be so hard hearted! Please let him free. I am beg9if1931°"- Hey, disperse the crowd. Better resolve this and leave. Othenlvise, you'll be held answerable for this. Get away. We also have people behind us. Get away. Not for killing or burning all of you! Only for your protection, they combat day and night tenaciously, understood? Showing willfulness! Even I have borne many lathe charges for protesting against the Police. We must react according to the situation, got it? Move all of you. Move away. Give way. Madam, please get inside. TV people ...move away. Sir, you be seated. Sir, your comments, please. Why are you getting so wild? Get away... I say move. Who's he to order us? Look, gas is spreading towards this area! Central jail is over here. Vijay, can you suggest any other option other than evacuating the Jail? We've already discussed it, sir. The only left out option is refilling. Experts must some from Coimbatore. They'll at least take 5 hours to reach here. Until that time, I've no idea where the gas will be spread? Sir,just a minute. There... Brother! What happened? Pressure has mounted up suddenly, "because of the heat formed during the blast. Those refinery technicians can't even go near. Where are they? Over there. Drivers of the tanker must reach here immediately. What is their condition? Can they reach immediately? We must know the pressure gauge of the tanker. Meter details are not shown in this. We can ascertain it only if they reach. Call the commissioner Shajahan, Call the 2nd unit. Pump water from it and try to cool it down. Hurry up! Vijay, pressure mounted and formed BLEVE in the tanker. If it's not controlled now, new blisters will form again. Apart from that, there's a possibility for the backplate to burst. If the pressure builds up again, within seconds, it'll blast. It's been mounting. Pressure must be handled. How? The meter panel below the precision point, has to be lowered to 60 cubic volumes. And release the pressure value. But it's dangerous. Pressure gauge variations will suddenly cause boil inside, and it might blast. 60 cubic volume? Yes! No, Vijay... Listen to me, Vijay. Please don't go now. Vijay, no. Has the 2nd unit arrived? Yes Hurry up and do it! Move. Did you notice that? The Chassis connecting lamp was not clipped properly! Useless fellows! Look how carelessly they have handled! Othenlvise, it wouldn't have fallen down from the chassis. Idiots who are not concerned about safety! Sir, the ruckus before the jail has cooled down for some extent. Needlessly somebody triggers these problems to achieve fame. Can find such senseless people everywhere! Did you notice the women, we'd seen there. Somebody went to their houses, informed them the situation, invoked fear and brought them here! Somebody is intentionally playing behind the scene! Tanker's drivers are missing from the hospital. Probably to evade from the accident case, they must have absconded. Anyhow, I passed the information to the Refinery. The Chassis connection lamp is not fitted properly. Somebody is intentionally playing behind the scene. Tankefs drivers are missing. Open I Say! If anything happens to him, I'll hang myself here. Madam. the tanker didn't overturn inadvertently! But somebody deliberately overturned it. Only after meticulously calculating the risk, I posed this threat. 50 Cubic volume tanker was overturned. It's as more than enough for the whole city to reduce to ashes. It's a set up! A conspiracy! These are all connected! Lorry accident! The manner it happened... As meticulously planned... Achaary's threat Sudden conflict in the jail... The news precisely leaked to the News channel! Stirred up the prisoner's relatives through that.. It's all a single hatched plot. A clear sabotage plan! There's some dirt in the mixie Please wash it once again. Doctor confirmed, Cancer! Have you noticed the girl seated in that car? Only to protect people like us, The Government has granted you with this uniform. I'll ablaze, it! Don't think I've committed a mistake. As it's dangerous, I'm preventing you. Please let him free! I am begging you. Is there any solid proof to endorse this information? Tanker's drivers are missing from the hospital. They weren't the ones sent by the Refinery. Refinery authorities have also confirmed it. Apart from that, Narendra Achari said, he had been to scanning centre, to collect his daughtefs reports. But that was fake. In fact, he did only a routine check up. Even the jail warden connects few suspicions. Some of the prisoners were aware of this evening's incident earlier. Jail supervisors provided us this information. Damn sure somebody's sharp brain is behind this plot! The problem now is, prisoners looking out for a way to escape. Sir, you needn't have any doubt in this! Either to rescue some VIP in thejail, or a person of a similar profile. A sabotage plan! Any possibility of tracing such a high profile person from Jail records? It's not like that, sir. Of the 400 prisoners, anybody could be that person. But in that situation, we can't arrive at a pinpoint decision. Reason, we neither have such evident message nor intelligence report. Thus, we must suspect all of them equally. If it is to rescue that person, what would be their mode of operation? In such situations, They very well know, there's no other option but to shift the jail prisoners... So, their attack will only be after the shifting. Either on the shifting route, or in the shelter. In such a situation, we've no other option but to shift the jail. If they still attempt to rescue suppressing our tight security force, let's wait and see! Shift the jail, the moment we receive the Magistrate's consent. No, sir, that's dangerous. Why? This group's plan is not so insignificant. They have bigger intentions. I don't get you. When they could do so much, definitely they're not going to attack on shifting spot or on the road. Then? They must be well aware, we'll deploy enough forces in such a situation. So only after weakening our forces, they will ambush. What I mean is, after this gas spread zone, they may probably try to attack us at any places. Surely, our force will defend, right? Exactly! That moment, in a very second, they will eliminate us! How? They'll set ablaze the gas spread area, which will be bigger than a bomb explosion. Even if all the forces of the state are deployed, everybody's attention will be there only. That'll be their moment. During that time, they will strike us. So, jail shifting is more dangerous. What else to do? Actually, I was discussing with refinery technician. Amal, one minute. It's off the book process! Without waiting for the refilling vehicle, using local equipment, this LPG can be refilled to another tanker. Okay! Having such a good option, why hadn't you done it for so long? Sir, that involves risk. As it's not a licensed operation, there's a possibility of high risk! . Okay! Are you confident enough to perform this operation? As a Refinery technician, can you take the full responsibility? Sir, it's quite risky. Whether it's risky or not, is not my question! Can you do it? Sir, that's... Sir, I'll do it. No, Vijay. It's not a situation to take up the risk. It's an issue of answering the lives of 400 prisoners. But sir, we can't rule out the possibility of another blast. We've almost reached our mission staking our lives. Do you want us to admit the defeat at this stage? Vijay, you handled your task perfectly! I really appreciate you! Now onwards, you just assist only the police! You may please wait outside and wait for the next orders. I only need to discuss this to IG. If the explosion occurs as Vijay said, what would be the casualty? We've already evacuated the people from the gas spread area. So, the common people's casualty will likely be less. The next is Fire force team. In this dire situation, they can't be away from the spot. If the jail is not evacuated, 400 people will be burned down to death Even if evacuated, there's risk. What'll happen to the rest of the firemen's casualty? Sir, as the part of their duty, they must take up this risk. Thejail must be shifted as early as possible. That's Cabinet's decision. Let this talk be with us only. Why are you standing here? We're well aware of the danger here, isn't it? Then, with what courage are we still here? Tell me the truth, won't all of us reduce to ashes? It's really dangerous. Don't stake poor lives deliberately! It's our duty! We must abide it! Damn it! Duty! For what? Despite doing our duty day and night staking our own lives, was there any point? Some police officers will decide, whether to prevent the disaster or not? Our Pillai sir died just half an hour before his retirement period. Does anyone remember, at least 1% of his devotion to the duty? Being away from my sick mom and one month old infant, I'm standing here. No... I don't want to die knowingly. Maximum I'll get a suspension or I may be sacked... I don't give a damn. Whatever you said, will only happen here. Listen, Vijay! Safety is more important now. You can move to the safe zone until the jail shifting. It may be against your duty ethics, or it could even end up in a suspension, I know that. Just think about safety now, and not ethics, Vijay! Madam, there's something which you are not aware of. Common people who dial 101, have a trust, that Fire Force will surely rescue them from the mishap! For safeguarding that trust, even if a hen falls into the well or crow trapped in a net, we readily do it without any hesitation! Let Police, Minister or whoever go back, But... before the one who posed this threat, I'm not ready to surrender the morale of FireForce! All the shifting routes must be blocked. Place tight security on all bypass roads! From anywhere, any moment, an attack can be expected. Sir, red alert has been issued in the city 5 kms radius is fully sealed. Ensure safety of the cells before evacuation. We require Fire Force clearance for that. Ask Unit Command Vijay to meet me as soon as possible. Please don't create any ruckus. Like Cigerrate, beedi, match box" don't use any flammable objects. There's a possibility of the gas being spread. Did all of you understand? There's a possibility of the gas being spread. Please don't create any ruckus. Stay calm. We shall resolve it...okay. Catch them... Catch.. Give us the keys... Hey, free us It's hardly possible to shift the jail at this circumstance. We must find any other solution. Pass on the message to the Minister immediately. Get the Commandos quick! Open it, I say" Open it. Connect the pipe immediately! Fire must be put off in 5 mins. In 5 minutes? Gas is spread up to 100 m. 5 minutes are enough for the fire to spread here. Even the embers must be put off by then. You go quick... I'll manage here. Go.. Sir, fire flares up! We need more people. We're only 3 of us, including you. We may also require more units and hoses! We must do it. We only have 5 mins! I'll control the force of the engine. I'll maintain the pressure what you say! Move... I say move. Enough? Where were you for so long, you ass! Maintain the pressure. Spray the water Over there.. Shajahan...hey... Oh my God! Shajahan! Carry! We must immediately carry on with the safety precautions ofjail shifting. We have no time. The entire force is waiting Come on, quick. Sir, he has been with me for 5 yrs! Calm down, Vijay. It's not the time to be emotional! It's our duty. It's the risk of the Force! We've to face it. So, you mean, let all my people die? No, Vijay... The deceased, also has a family and life.. None of you are concerned about that. Even any traitor's life is worth crores! For that son of a bitch, Full police force, security... and all such things will be granted by the Government. But for the ration and pension, Poor people have to walk into all the Government offices. Vijay, don't be emotional. Sir, we're also human beings. I also have bloody emotions for my teammates. Sir, what's wrong with it? So what? What do you want now? I want him now. I want to know who he's! This is not the appropriate time to show your personal vengeance! I just like to know one thing. Before the jail evacuation, Fire force must certify, that the jail is safe. That's your duty. Do that first! And the rest, later! No! No more excuses! For jail shifting, are you ready to help us or do I've to look out for someone? You decide! I don't feel like leaving! It's dangerous! I don't wish to die knowingly. Sir, give me the keys. Please sir, no! Vijay sir, please don't go there. Sir, sir.. Vijay, open the gate. Have you become mad? Open the gate. Sir, please don't listen to them... Please open the gate, sir. If I have to open this gate, I must get him What nonsense is this! Aren't you a well disciplined officer? When the full force is handling such a situation taking so much risk, Don't consider this only as your personal problem. As your team mate died in this mission, do you want to stake all these innocent lives? Sir, do you find my team mate's death so trivial? The lives of every single person who die in this mission are valuable, Sir! We know how to handle him! We'll surely find him and punish him. That's the duty of the Police force. When? Where? How? You must find him and punish him right now. What's the point in punishing him after 1000 yrs by then he'd have committed all possible crimes I want him today, right now.. What's your suggestion? We've no time for any peaceful discussion. He doesn't seem to calm down. My option is to attack. The full commando force is ready. I just require your order. Police may not find so easily, your foe and my foe! But..being together for many days in a confined wall, you don't need much time to find him.. It's you people who have to decide.. Sir, we're really running out of time. Take some decision quickly. Sir, If a man really tries to escape staking everybody's life, then, he'll surely not see the outside world. We need only an hour's time to find him. But if you really want us to do it, to assure whatever you said was really true, open this gate and come to our side, and stand beside us. Do you dare? If you really do and stand beside us courageously, then, you'll immediately find him! Sir.. Yes, sir. Sir,just a minute. We've made a blunder. Whom are we trying to protect? A criminal in the jail! The one standing over there, isn't Fireman Vijay, but a common man representing you and me. Just think! Hasn't he taken the stand what we were supposed to take? Our foe isn't Vijay, but, the criminal in the jail. Sir, what nonsense is he trying to do? What the hell? Don't be in a haste. Listen to me. What's he up to? Move awaymMove. Sir came in trusting us. None of you must move. They're the supervisors here! A Block, D Block, G Block, and C Block. Not even a housefly will move without their knowledge! Do whatever help he needs! I just want to know how many people use mobile phones here. I want to know who's criminal in the jail, within half an hour's time! It's my order. I need complete case details of the inmates in central prison. All the stations which are linked with Crime and the criminal networking system must restore the connection, okay? See, we've very limited time. But, madam No, ifs and buts! I want every bit of information, immediate. Get me the history of these 4 people. He's not like one as we imagined! He doesn't have the brains of an ordinary firemanl! To trap the wolf in sheep's garb, he uses the goat flocks! Sir, he.. He's trying to clear the dirt through the prisoners. To win a battle, What we need is not a 1000 cannon, but a sharp brain! He has it with him. What's your case? What's your name? Someone, of a bigger age group! These are just two stations. Where are the rest? Those 4 people are robbers and pickpockets! I've found two more people. Send all the shortlisted names to my office. No.1 and 22. Get on another big screen. For the last few days, have you found anything strange in anyone's activities? I mean...anyone with too many visitors... or..often missing from the cell... or secretly calling someone, anything like that. If so, please try and remember... Let me report this to madam... Narendran Achaaryi is dead. What? There's no such person as you imagine. Seems like there's a mistake somewhere! Please come. We enquired by all means... there's no such culprit here. Let the police find out the culprit who staked these many people's lives! Please leave us. Isn't that better, Sir! We enquired maximum about everybody. Please don't be so adamant. Let us also live. Wasn't it you who told us gas is being spread here? Must be the secret nexus between him and the police! Don't spare him... Move away. The situation is aggravating! Don't permit this situation to persist for any reasons... Commandos must get 'm as scan as passMe Move away... Don't spare him. 50 Cubic LPG tanker has overturned here! Five hours have gone by! Gas would've almost spread all over this area. If you delay anymore... The whole city will reduce to ashes. Only the Police and Fire force was aware of these details. How did you come to know so accurately? Who told you? Answer me. Don't come closer. If you come near, I'll flick this. Then, you, me and this whole area will reduce to ashes. Don't come closer. Come on, flick it up! Come on.. Come on,flick it up! Not only a spark... even if a blast occurs, nothing will happen to this area. The plot, you hatched meticulously, was misfired by Kerala Fire Force one hour ago. Common people who dial 101, have a trust. Before the one who hatched this plot, I'm not ready to surrender the morale of the Fire Force. Not only to rescue, he must realize that we also know to retaliate! What you mean by retaliate? Can you stand by me? Off the records! I need 2 persons. It's not a child's playl! Refilling must be done cautiously like a needle surgery! To do the refilling over here, tell what all things are required, tell the list. Sir, how many plumbers do you need? I'll give. Not only that, to refill this, must require yet another tanker. You don't get worried thinking on that, I'll arrange the tankers. Again what we need is time, 2 hours. This shifting ofjail, if we intend, it can be extended up to 3 hours. No one panic, everyone be at ease. Inside thejail, one of our member is there Binoy. In the cell number 2I412. I'll give one letter to him , through sir. Somehow give that letter to him, the rest of the things he will deal. What is your name? Binoy. Comrade Iqbal, has given this. In this condition the jail cannot be shifted. At any cost must find out some solution. You and all.. We are... Vijay, our plan has worked out, the main cell of the jail is closed. Now the shifting will not take place once they get eased themselves. 2 hours, we've got 2 hours time. Beat him fellows! Like what sir has told. I've done a fire man's job sincerely and fine. Now to find out the people behind it and the questioning and all. That's the responsibility of the police. As the tanker lorry turned over at the city, 25 people had died. 70 people are injured, among the dead, there are 2 fire force officials also. Both inside and outside the nation after conducting a series of explosion. The hard core terrorist is caught. Its found out that he has come to conduct a series of explosion in the city. Quite unexpectedly he was being caught on a minor case. As he was under the remand. The moves made by the gang to save him. The cops had nullified that move, as told by the IG to media persons. The main news head lines, repeated again. As the tanker lorry got turned over in the city, the death rate is 25 people. 70 people are injured. Among the dead there are 2 fire force officials. Hallo? What time is it? Okay. The body of Shahjahan and Pillai sir will reach now at the district office. Vijay sir has come now. Come! Hallo! Yes. Sir at the district fire force office the Shahjahan's and Lakshmanan Pilla sir's body will reach now. We were waiting for sir, shall we leave sir'? Sir, at the by pass a bus accident, 10 to 20 people are trapped. Its an emergency call. Sir! Take the vehicle! On dialing 101, every ordinary person has got a hope! In any danger, one fire force person will come to save him! What do you like to have? 2 Orange Juice. Hello! Call me later. What an ideal time for idle talk! Are you using ice cubes that have license? Evey mo days, the Health Department checks this place. So we can't use local products, even ifwe wish. Hello!

I'll get you the juice. Get lost! ,Äì That fellow...! Good morning eveybody! Before I speak about the awareness of Fire 8 Safety, I would like to ask each one ofyou something. Who all wish to become Engineers? Who all wish to become Doctors? Who all wish to become Police officen? Who all wish to becomeArmy O_icers? Who all wish to become Firemen? Nobody? So, nobody is interested to become a Fireman. But all ofyou will certainly become a Fireman one day. A Fireman is not a profession, but the duty of each and evey citiMn. No one is aware of lurking dangen in our life! To save us from these dangers, evey one of us must become a Fireman. So, the Fireman which is inside us, will not only save humans, but also those living around us and even non human beings! Each and evey Fireman has that responsibility. Tie tightly around the waist.

It'll be good if you ty and understand it. Shucks! Yes! Prasad, that serve is for you... Take it! Brother ...Yes! What was the case today? A Rooster fell in the Well! Without even a scratch, I handed it overto the owner. Then for sure, a photo ofyou with Rooster will come in tomorrow's newspaper. That'll be good forthe Rooster! Brother... Stand straight. I need some change. How much? 1000 rupees Rs.1000 ,Äì a small sum? Brother...it's domestic worries! When the misfortunes pop in from all the 4 sides, then, Rs1000 is also a small sum! It's hardly two weeks since my baby was born. Since then mom is suffering from Asthma! Both ofthem are lying on the adjacent wards No idea where the money goes! It's month end! Borrow from Lakshmanan Pillai! I've nothing with me. I've already borrowed from him. So, I'm the only one remaining. Bro, lend me if you could. You've not seen my baby's photo, right? Let me see.

My elder daughter is 23 yrs old now. Altogether, I have 30 yrs of service. A_ertomorrow morning's Beep Parade, I'll become retired leading Fireman Lakshmanan Pillai. What retirement life for you! Once retired from here, you'll be easily posted either in any hotel as Safety O_icer or as a tutor in a Fire and Safety College for hem salay. No, I don't feel that way. How much ever high I may get... The power of being here, will not be found anywhere else. No other go when one grows old! We'll share the rest at the send o_ party at 6.30 p.m. today. Now, I must meet a friend. Don't keep chatting for long. Come back quickly. Agreed ,Äì Okay. Have you seen the child seated on that Car? Who? On which Car? This car! My daughter was inside the Car. When I returned a_er collecting the report from scanning centre, I found my child missing. I'm sory, I never noticed. The child must've walked out nearby. No, she'll not go anywhere without telling me. Hello! Have you seen the child in the Car? No! What happened? That was his daughter. He found the child missing a_er returning from the scanning centre. As I was quite busy, I didn't notice. Check out nearby shops. Might've gone there. Many people pass this way. How do we know? You people will not undentand the woes of a Politician. Without sugar, right? Äì Yes. Wasn't he the one who had been here this morning? He seems to be in some trouble. Throngs of people have crowded there. Wait, I'll be back now. Look a_er the shop.

Brother... Brother... Leading Fireman Lakshmana Pillai! I don't feel like leaving! Why are you getting so despondent? No, I'm alright. Come to the hotel quickly. I'll leave in one hour's time. No emergency cases today. The moment the next duty o_icer takes charge, I'll leave. Okay brother. Ifyou're not capable enough, better discard eveything and go home. Stop it! This is the Police Station! I'd given a complaint this a_ernoon that my daughter was missing. Four hours have gone! Tell me what you've investigated so far! I want to know the developments ofthis case. If the complaint is registered, it'll surely be investigated. You get away. It's a matter of a girl's life! If anything happens to her, I'll hang myself in front ofthis station. Stop it man! Are you the Home Ministerto order us? It concerns not only your daughter... But 6 people are missing from this City. All ofthem are equal to us. I don't want to hear your excuses. Showing your anger on the Sl? This Police station is not your dad's propem to order us! Then, is this your dad's property?

Fire has been put o_. Fire force is active. S.l reached the spot first. Sir, the incident occurred in this area. The tanker turned turtle over there. It's really serious. There are leakages on all the four sides. And also cracked below which is not visible Probably gas would've spread out eveywhere. Bro, it's beyond our control. It'll take 5.6 hrs for people from Refiney to reach here! Don't panic. Ty to cool down the tanker first. But bro... Listen, we're here to handle the danger, and not to get panicky.. Until the Tanker gets cool, pump water from all 4 sides. Whatever may happen, we can't go from here without finding a solution! Don't make the situation wone with unnecessay tension! We must handle this at any cost. Record the direction and speed ofthe wind from all 4 sides, and submit the readings to me right now. Mark it clearly up to where the gas is spread at this moment. that doesn't come up in my day job, right? So... - No, I had fun. - Well, thank you. Okay, um, well, it is getting late tonight. I should probably head back. Yes, and I... you know, they're loading up, so I just need to help the fellows load up. - Yeah. Sure. - So... see you around. - Yeah. Sure. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Take it easy. - You too. Good night. Bye. Keyboards. Ozzie? I thought maybe you'd like to see this. What's this? I couldn't stop thinking about that day in Beacon, and when you mentioned the alien therapy thing, I remembered you started drawing these right after you got lost. I drew this? And about 500 others. There's another shoe box full in the bedroom. You called it "Snake Man and Little Guy." And you didn't think this was weird? It creeped me out at the time. I wanted to take you to therapy, but your father said it was... quote, "white people shit." I still think it is. No offense. We just felt you needed to see these... after what you told us. I appreciate that. I thought I had an answer, and now I have more questions. You know, Nancy seemed pretty shaken up. I'm gonna go check on her. Sorry, Gina. I just... Okay, um, maybe that's a good stopping place. Ennis, can we use the barn next week? No. The barn's booked for a wedding. Yeah, can I say something? We should take a break. What do you mean? I mean... - what is that? - Calista, shut up. Look around. You know, we're half gone. We're in a barn. Seems like we're just forcing it. It doesn't really feel like group anymore. Doesn't. And I know what groups feel like. I'm in a lot of groups. I'm in... I'm in, the Knitting Circle, and then Let's Take a Hike With Seniors and Death Talk Cafe... Okay! Okay, okay. Okay, cool. Okay, cool. Great. So, our next meeting is TBD. Or how about not at all? How about that? - No. No, that's extreme. - No, no. Is it? Is that extreme, Margaret? Well, how's... how's this for extreme, okay? Holding this entire group... on my shoulders for all of this time, okay? Holding... trying to find places to meet... and trying to help people... and giving and giving and giving... and giving and giving and giving and giving... until there is nothing left of the giving tree! Do you know what happens then? It dies! And everybody sits around on the stump of the tree! Good! Why don't you just have your meetings... You know what? Maybe I need a break. Aah, it! It's TBD! - Shh. - What? You're gonna wake up Ozzie. This just gets weirder and weirder. - Empathize... - With this. Oh! Everybody I never wanted to see again, all in one room. So, tell me why we're here again? Um... Uh... Right. 'Cause the dream never dies. Well, uh... uh, nerds are supposed to be cool now, right? Yeah. Yeah, maybe, you know. Let's see if we're grandfathered in. Yeah. Oops. Sorry. Come on, man, aren't we a little too old for that now? Too old for what... exactly? Um... too old to fall back on an outdated social hierarchy that penalizes achievement and rewards mediocrity. Oh. That sounded like an insult. I think. Um... Whoa, it's... No, don't. Don't. ...my life coach, so... Okay. Ooh. Come on. Wow. Looks like it's just me and you. * It's the same as the emotion... * Yeah, you know. That and your teensy, weensy, little... * Give me your heart, make it real or else... * Hey, so what'd you end up doing after high school? I joined Special Forces. Got my CPA degree off the GI Bill. You should check it out. I'm gonna kick your ass. Yeah, good luck with that. Um... you meant today, right? Whoa. No. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. Oh. Somebody call 911! Call 911! Oh. What's Torres doing here? I don't know. He and Quinn don't officially start till Monday. Hey, Torres. Hey, what's up? Hey, you know, uh... you know it's Friday night, right? - Yeah, I know. Just not really sure how this whole desk thing works, so, uh... figured I'd drop off a few things early. Starting with a picture of yourself. Yeah. It's a reminder. Of...? Something I like to be reminded of. Hmm. Okay, we got to go. Talk to you Monday. Oh, you guys are... late to spinning class or something? Uh, no, Gibbs is famous for coming in just before the weekend starts and saying... Grab your gear. That a well-timed illustration, boss? Got a death at Quantico. Okay. - Are you coming? I'm not much of a varsity letters guy. - James Bruno. Graduated Puller High 15 years ago. Barely, from what I hear. His father was stationed at the motor pool on base. - So, what do you think? Involuntary manslaughter? Yeah. Maybe. Jethro Gibbs doesn't like to commit. That's why it's the perfect job for him. Thanks for calling me. I'm ready to get started. Get started. Okay. All right, what did I miss? Your jacket. Okay. Oh, I don't know, he looks fine. Just fine. Who is he? Oh, that's Agent Torres. Oh, that's great. Who are you? A-Agent Quinn. I swear, I barely touched him. I mean, I just did a controlled throw so that he would think twice about touching me. So, what started the fight? Nothing. He's just that kind of guy. He's just always starting something. When was the last time you saw him? Uh, I haven't seen him since high school. 15 years. Looks like nothing's changed. The teenage years are fraught with peril. The frontal cortex is responsible for self-regulation. It develops gradually over adolescence. Unfortunately, in some adults, well, it never occurs. You aren't talking about anyone in particular, are you, Doctor? 'Cause I was only popping that bubble wrap to see if it was still... The victim, Mr. Palmer. I was referring to the victim. - What about him? Well, I don't see anything obvious, but this hypersalivation suggests there's some sort of poison at work. Boss, we got a problem. What do you got, McGee? Talked to one of the eyewitnesses. They saw Bruno arrive early, put something in one of these lockers and it wasn't a math book. Stand clear. - Yeah. I think this guy had issues. So, this button moves forward; this one moves backwards, and this is the "Oops, How Did That Get There?" button. The what? We push it when Gibbs asks for the impossible to distract him. I-It's preloaded with pictures of his ex-wives or Jimmy Palmer making turducken, stuff like that. And you think he doesn't know what you're doing? He's good. He's not that good. All right, Jim Bruno. Let's go. - Jim Bruno, born James. Left home after high school, never came back. Yeah, he got a job teaching shop at a community college. Ended after a burglary conviction. Wrong button. Oops. - Bruno's never paid taxes, never voted, and has no recent home address we can find. Yeah, your doc confirms that he was poisoned to death. Are we sure the explosive was his? We are now. A base surveillance camera shows him assembling a bomb in his car. Bomb squad's sending it to Abby. Said there's enough explosives in there to level the gym. Bruno would've ended up killing his entire high school graduating class. McGee and Quinn. High school records. On it. Bishop and Torres, go talk to his teachers. See who remembers him. Uh... Yeah? What desk should I be at? - Right here. My old desk. Putting baby in the corner? That's where you sat when you were a probie. Since when do you sit down? Oh. Uh... There's five of us here now. Gonna have to... rearrange some stuff. You try to do what you can for these kids, be sensitive to their needs but some of them are just, well, beyond reach, you know? Hey! Hey! Don't just pull the poster down! Take the tape off the wall! Idiots. Sorry, where were we? You were just telling us how sensitive you can be. Hey, I did what I could for that kid. His senior year, I spent eight weekends in a row in Saturday detention with him, trying to whip him into shape. Nothing took. Always causing a ruckus. Recent contact? No... but it's a tight community. I heard a rumor he was renting a room from an old substitute teacher. Do you think he was targeting anyone in particular? Take your pick. That punk had problems with everyone in the school. How many had problems with him? What, you're looking for a list or something? His death wasn't accidental. He was poisoned. Well, then you got your work cut out for you. Everyone had problems with that kid. Abbs, McGee said you had something for me. Yup. Yup, I do. Yeah. Behind your back. No... no, this is some... it's nothing. It's just... Well, it's my... it's my high school yearbook. I thought I would, you know, get in the mood for the case. It's a very bad move. I don't want to talk about it. Works for me. It's just that... high school, you know? It's where I found my... I don't know, style? And realized my obsession with blood-spatter patterns. Speaking of which... It just wasn't a great combo for making friends and influencing people. I had a lot of, um, alone time in high school, but... let's just leave it at that 'cause I said I didn't want to talk about it, remember? Yes. Okay. Good. On to happier subjects. This is the explosive device that Bruno was going to use to commit mass murder. It has a wireless receiver and it was built from a toy remote-control car kit. Can you trace it? Hopefully or eventually. Don't be so impatient. How close did Bruno need to get to trigger the explosive? Well, it's a long-range transmitter, so he wasn't, like, suicidal, if that's what you're thinking. As a matter of fact, he was trying to quit smoking and that is what actually killed him. The killer spiked his nicotine patch with a cyanide analogue about 20 minutes before he put it on, according to the adhesive oxidation. That rules out everyone at the reunion. I know. Ducky said that Bruno was already wearing the patch when he got there. That's good news. 'Cause it narrows down our suspect list. Yeah. To zero. If I never see a retired substitute teacher again, it'll be too soon. How many are left? Well, five down, six to go. Quinn's got another five. Ma'am, hello. NCIS. I'm, uh, Special Agent Timothy McGee and this is Special Agent Bishop here. Hi, there. Uh, are you currently renting a room to this man? Aren't you two cute. I'll take two boxes of Skinny Mints and two boxes of Peanut Butteries. - My apologies. I don't see so well these days. I could've sworn you said you were selling cookies. Wishful thinking, I guess. I do love Skinny Mints. Mmm, I do, too. So how long has Bruno been living here? Several years now, poor thing. Would you like some coffee? Uh, no, thanks, I'm okay, ma'am. Heard on the radio what happened. Don't buy a word of it. - Really? Why not? James Bruno was such a nice boy. Always paid his rent on time. Wouldn't hurt a fly. Cream? Uh, no, ma'am, I actually said I didn't want coffee. Cream it is. - Uh... did you know that he had a criminal record? I'm blind, honey, not an idiot. I did my background check before I rented the room. Which is back this way, if you want to see it. I didn't learn anything I didn't know already, though. I remember that boy from high school. We heard he was trouble back then. Oh, he was. Everyone hated him. But then he changed senior year. Out of the blue, he started dating one of the most popular girls in class. It was the darndest thing. She turned that boy's whole life around. And his attitude. He ended up being quite well-liked. Here you go. You got a key? No. I don't go in there. He likes his privacy. Boys and their boy antics. What a tragic ending. But I don't believe for a second he's capable of murder. I can't imagine why anyone he went to school with would want to kill him. Or why anyone would at all, for that matter. Know what I mean? All right. He was a good kid. - Not that good. - Look at this, iPads, jewelry, paintings. - Oh, where he get all that stuff? - Good question. Okay, people, we have fine art on table A. Electronics on table B. Jewelry and household goods, tables C... There's a lot of stuff here, how much do you think this is all worth? All these wonderful prizes are worth tens of thousands of dollars and they can all be yours, Timothy McGee, if you can answer the NCIS bonus question. Where'd it come from? Actually, boss, I can answer that. Burglaries. All over the city. Torres dug up this report. Metro PD's been tracking a citywide theft ring for over half a decade. - This is all they got? Yup. Clearly Bruno didn't do all this himself, but Metro never generated a single lead on whoever was involved. - Well, I have one. Not to brag. All the fingerprints that I found in the room belonged to Bruno. But I also found this, which did not, according to Ducky. Bruno had a visitor with a really bad case of pityriasis capitis. AKA dandruff. Left flakes everywhere. Like snow. That teacher see anyone? I don't think she's seen anyone since the '90s, boss. She did say Bruno would have an occasional visitor. Said it was, "A man or maybe a woman, I think." Whoever they are, I'll bet you dollars to donuts that they are gonna be coming back for this stuff. Take Quinn, McGee, eyes on that house 24/7. Abbs? Don't even think about it. - So how long has it been since you've been on stakeout? - It's been a while. But I-I'm good to go. I taught yearly seminars on it. Oh, I... I remember. Oh, that's right. I did forgot one crucial element. What's that? Hydration is your enemy. Ah, yeah. Well... Men's room. Ladies' room. No. I am not at DEFCON 1 yet. But you will be the first to know. You will be the one with the bag on your head. - What is she doing? We told her to stay in the house. Well, we told her to do what she normally does, so... Does she normally water the bird feeder? - Aw, be nice. She's a lonely old lady. Which reminds me, Bishop told me you're going to propose to your girlfriend. Congrats. Thanks. Tho... uh, those two things reminded you of each other? Oh. When are you gonna pop the question? When it's time. And when is that time? I don't know. I'm not exactly sure yet. I know I'm just gonna feel it out and... you know, I... I think... I'll just know, you know? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Right. No. I'll know that it's time when it's time. When might that be? I... Ooh, I see something. Yeah, it was really good chatting. Oh, yeah. Ooh, I got to go. - She won't tell us who she is. - Yeah, still no hits on her prints. Abby confirmed that it's her dandruff in our dead guy's room. Any I.D.? Only thing she had on her was her purse. - Yeah, and I have been to drug-lord torture rooms less scary. Me? Oh. Yup. What's your name? Okay. Where do you live? Okay. What were you doing in Jimmy Bruno's house? All right, we can sit here all day doing this... Hey. Are you hungry? Yeah? Here you go. Hey. How's the interrogation going? Well, just as you thought. Gibbs is slow walking it. Seeing if Torres will pick up the pace. Hmm, how's he doing? Well, he interrupted Gibbs. Took me four years before I got up the nerve to do that. Thank you. But he's got her talking. - Don't thank me too fast. We're about to charge you with murder. Bruno was my friend, I would never hurt him. Okay, well, then help us find out who did. I don't know anything. Did you know your friend tried to murder 50 people? - And maybe you were planning it with him. No! Hey! - Then why were you running? I wasn't. Really? Sardines, underwear? Looks like you were planning a trip somewhere. Or, you know what? I don't even want to imagine what else. Let's just go with running. You're wrong. That bomb couldn't have been Bruno's. He wouldn't do something like that. His fingerprints were all over it. Then you made a mistake! He's a thief, but not a killer. So you do know something. You're a thief, too, huh? Well, somebody's going down for Bruno's murder and guess who the Wheel of Misfortune just stopped on? I helped Bruno sell some stuff, that's all. It's none of my business where he got it. How long you been fencing for him? We have video of your friend building that bomb. He's not who you think he is. No, he's not who you think he is. You... you see him as you want to see him. He's got a lot of bark, yeah, but no bite. If he really did plant that bomb, then someone made him do it. He was tricked or something. And while you're wasting time in here with me, whoever manipulated him could be out there trying again. Did you ever think about that? - In some ways, Bruno, I envy you. When I was a child, I often fancied living the life of a daring cat burglar. Fortunately for me, yeah, at age of nine, on my maiden voyage, I fell off our neighbor's roof, yeah. Landed on my coccyx. And that was the end of that. You're lucky it ended so quickly. One time when I was in high school, I spent a night in jail for... Uh, for... Never mind. For what exactly, Mr. Palmer? Just-- it's funny, I-I said the word "jail." I meant to say, um... Vail. Yeah, I was-I was a big skier in high school. Were you now? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I loved the-I loved the, uh, snow. I loved-I loved, uh, skiing and-and... What I'd do is I'd- - Vail! You look like a man on a mission. Got an alibi for the murder. She was nowhere near Bruno when he was poisoned. Oh, and so it goes. Got us to thinking, maybe there's a second bomber. We could use a lead. Well, let's see what we can come up with. This man has told me quite a bit about himself. Starting with these burns. They're quite old, probably inflicted when he was a teenager. Military records indicate that his father died of lung cancer, excessive cigar smoking. Yeah, so we can put two and two together. He had a rough childhood. And also a rough week. Well, yeah. He's dead. Yes, but days before that, he was in a fight where he suffered severe body blows. If you look carefully, you can make out the imprint of a fist. Well, his knuckles don't look too bad. Yes, well, oddly enough, he didn't seem to fight back. Even more odd was the fact that we removed a diamond earring from this lobe. Well, men are piercing their ears now, Duck. Yes, but I'm referring to the fact that the hole was closed up from disuse. Yet he forced the earring in anyway. Ugh... That must've hurt like a mother. I'm sure it has some... psychological significance, but I'm not sure what. However, Abby came up with a second set of DNA on the earring. So, I imagine you'll find out soon enough. Well, is that a good enough lead for you? Hey, so, you're the world-famous Abby Sciuto I keep hearing so much about. Oh, well, guess we can skip the "I thought you'd be taller" part. I'm Agent Quinn. For what's it worth, I thought you would be exactly five feet, six inches. I made a 3D avatar of you, using NCIS security camera footage. And the hairs slowly went up on Agent Quinn's neck. Oh, no, no! I just... I needed to know your sizes, because... I'm knitting you a "Welcome to NCIS" sweater. Oh! But until it's done, welcome... to NCIS. Well, thank you very much. Do you want a tour? I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to... He wants to find out where the earring came from. Of course he does. Well, right now, all I can tell you is that the prior owner was a female. Okay, so do you know how long Bruno had it in his ear? I have been waiting for someone to ask me that. The impurities in the gold caused our victim's skin oil to oxidize. And by measuring that amount, I could determine that he forced the stud through his ear, like, right before he went into the reunion. To kill 50 people. Then was poisoned to death. Okay, so whoever owns the stud, maybe she knows something. Well, I'm running the DNA through CODIS right now. But I've also been looking at this, trying to find pictures of women. I found this in a trench coat in Bruno's closet. Unfortunately... no women yet. Huh. Are these the homes that he robbed? Yeah. Looks like he was casing them for a few days. There's also a few pictures of his feet... and some pictures of some other people that I haven't identified yet. Ho-Hold up. Go back one. That's Neal Sherwood. You know him? Well, he was at the reunion, and he had a fight with the victim right before he died. Well, that's important. Uh, yeah, because Neal said they hadn't seen each other in 15 years. Oh. Where is he? - With his suitcase, wherever that is. Neighbors said he split right after the reunion. - Left in a hurry. He's running. Quinn, BOLO. McGee, freeway cams and credit cards. Find him. - We found something. Abby got a hit on the DNA from the earring Bruno was wearing. - Katrina Cooper. A high school classmate of Bruno's. Former prom queen, married the school jock, active social life. How did Bruno get her earring? Could've stolen it, but if he did, she never reported it. They have any recent contact? No. No calls, no texts, no Snapchat doggie faces. The only connection we could find was from high school. They had a Saturday detention together, once. 15 years ago? Thin, I know. Talk to her. Find out why her DNA was in our dead guy's ear. Round two, everybody! We got soccer meatballs, lacrosse stick hot dogs... and pigskin pizza pockets. Who's hungry? - Mmm. I am. Hi. You must be here for Katrina. Why would you say that? That's what happens when you marry the most popular girl in town. Everybody's here for Katrina. Hmm. She's over there, in the huddle. They're like... little footballs. - And I told the guy, "Give me Louis Vuitton, or give me death." I got this. Okay. Um, Katrina Cooper? How you guys doing? You guys have fun? NCIS Special Agent Torres, Bishop. Hi. Can we have a word with you? Of course. Let's not disturb the party, shall we? Excuse me. Let's not do that. They're little footballs. They're good. - And how can I help you? Do you know this guy? Mm, no. Am I supposed to? Well, you guys went to high school together. Oh, in fact, he actually died in front of you. At your high school reunion, two days ago? Interestingly enough, wearing one of your earrings. It was stolen. Oh. You didn't report it stolen. I am now. You know, I bet you and me had something in common in high school. I don't think so. We both liked bad boys. The badder the better, except, I grew out of it. I don't think you did. Your husband know that you and Bruno have been sleeping together? Excuse me? What I'm wondering... is if you knew how bad Bruno really was. - You know, if he told you about, for the last several years, he's been robbing people in the city. Yeah, I think it's time for you to go. Cheers. Have one more question... No. No, no, no more questions. I don't know anything about any robberies, I'm not cheating on my husband and I have no idea where Neal Sherwood is. Okay? Well, that was actually my next question, which... I haven't asked yet. Oh, right. Hmm. Where is he? Get down! Found him. The cops are outside right now. It's over. To be honest, it's kind of a relief. I am willing to set the record straight, but I cannot go to prison. I just can't. I can't have it, my family... can't have it. So... I'm sorry. Shot himself with a flare gun. That's a new one. Did I miss the part where he set the record straight? Maybe it's on the laptop? Go-Go Abby fingers. Hey, so, um... You, um... liked bad boys in school, huh? I'm sorry, I just... I just painted for you for more of a goody two-shoes, uh, prom queen type. Actually, I... was the prom queen. Wow. So you played us both. Nice. Except, I was voted in as a joke. Kind of like Carrie, but... without the blood. Bishop, that's like... the worst thing I've ever heard. Yeah, I didn't have any friends in high school, I was too... me, I guess. I got something. Okay, it's a text document. Neal made it right before he shot himself. Looks like some kind of confession. It's even double-spaced and everything. - What exactly is he confessing to? - According to Neal, he and his high school friends are the ones behind Metro's theft ring. With each friend playing a very specific role. Adam Cooper, former jock, ended up running a sports betting company. That's where he would identify the wealthy marks. - Katrina Cooper, his prom queen wife, would flirt her way into the homes to get info on their security systems. Bad boy would do the actual robberies, and this woman, who we've now identified as former classmate, Angela Russell, would fence the stolen goods on the street where she lived. Finally, there's Neal Sherwood, the accountant. And he laundered the money. Yep. According to Neal, they came up with the idea to start a robbery gang back in school, after they met at a Saturday detention. - He said they talked about it as a joke at first, as a way to "get back" at their parents. Eventually they realized, if they pooled their talents, they could make some real money. - All of this seems very familiar. - Yeah... Yeah, I'm v-very interested in this case, here. We got five different high school kids from varied social backgrounds all coming together on their Saturdays, for detention. You know, it kind of reminds me of, uh... You've... You don't... Not important. Sorry. Anyway, the different social groups was part of the reason Metro was never able to crack the burglary ring. They were never able to find a connection between the players. Congratulations, we just solved Metro's case. What about our own? We have no clue who killed our victim! Actually, not true. The prom queen ain't talking, but the fence is. She thinks she knows who killed Bruno. Two days ago, your wife gave Bruno that earring. I don't believe you. Welcome to the club. You were the only one not at the reunion. You were the only one that had the opportunity to poison Bruno. Prosecutor's gonna file charges today, unless you have something to tell us. This isn't where I imagined I'd be after high school. Ah. Welcome to the club. I wanted to be a pro football player. You? Painter. Really. Really? Yeah. Really. Painter. Loved to paint. Watercolors, mostly. I took every art class that school had. Water colors? It's hard to imagine a grown man... So what happened? Life. Life. I paint with wood. It's close enough. Not for me. I suspected Katrina and Bruno had started up again, but I didn't want to believe it. But if she really gave him her earring it's game over for us. It's worse than that. I think that witch tried to kill me. The last house we knocked over, Bruno snagged a painting worth over a million bucks. My wife kept joking we should take out our partners, keep the money for ourselves. Said we should bomb the reunion, and make it look like a terrorist attack. I honestly thought she was joking. She must've talked Bruno into it. He was always a sucker for her. No way he would come up with something like that on his own. Hell, he was even gonna pretend to let Neal kick the crap out of him at the reunion as a goof, to impress some girls. Bruno was bad on the outside, but good on the inside. My wife? The opposite. What about you? All I can say is I'm not a murderer. I didn't kill Bruno, and I wasn't anywhere near him when he was poisoned. Hypothetically speaking, how would you feel about a betting pool on whether his alibi checks out? Hypothetically? How'd Ducky bet? Guilty. How'd you bet? I'm not a gambling man. And I have no idea. - I mean, who are these people? Living double lives like this? I mean, yeah, I mean, I... I lived as someone else, for the most of the last decade, but... I had an excuse, I was, uh... I was undercover. Which version is the real them? Which version is the real you? You're looking at it. Am I? You created all those covers. It wasn't random. Wait, you're saying that a part of me wanted to be a, uh, mafia-tied, vegan juice-bar owner? Eh... You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? You tried to kill us all! Oh, could everyone just please stop fighting? Shove a Pixy Stix up your nose! - McGee is taking them to Metro not a moment too soon. And Miss Congeniality denied having anything to do with the bomb attempt, even though we found the detonator in her car. Unfortunately, her husband's alibi came through. Like he said, he was nowhere near Bruno when he was poisoned. The fight with Neal was staged. - If none of them killed Bruno, then who the hell did? All right, let's go back to what we do know. He's dead. I feel pretty confident about that. What else do we know? We know who didn't kill him. And a million-dollar painting is missing. We find the painting, we find the killer. Checked everybody's houses. Nobody has it. Everyone insists Bruno has it. He didn't. He could've hid it. Maybe in a storage unit in the area. Yeah, safe-deposit box. Start looking. - All that work and we're back to square one. Tell me about it. What about the fight Ducky said he was in? Maybe he came back to finish the job. Our only witness is dead. Okay, what would I tell my students in my GPS forensics class? I would have them go back and reconstruct a timeline of Bruno's movements. Maybe we can find another witness. Do it. There goes my evening plans. Were they exciting plans? Uh, cooking class? Oh, well, don't cancel that just yet. You. I have goodies, come on. You know... Even though you just met her, you already kind of wish she was your sister? Well, I was just going to say I like her boots, but hey, I'll take another sister. I was finally able to trace the remote detonator that Bruno used in his explosive. It took me a long time because there are parts missing. Someone tampered with it? Yeah. And according to touch DNA, Bruno did. It's like he built this bomb, and then he disabled it. His girlfriend's remote detonator wouldn't have even worked. Bad on the outside, good on the inside. Maybe he got cold feet and decided he didn't want to be a depraved mass murderer after all. See, this is why I'm a people person. 'Cause the good on the inside, it always-- Abbs. Quinn... cooking class? Right. Sorry. Okay, so the receiver was made from a rare Lazarus 1941 hobby car. It's available in only two stores in the area, one of which happens to be across the street from a bank with a brand-new, hi-def security system. Voila, Bruno. His entrance isn't very exciting, but he made quite an exit. Personally, if I was looking for Bruno's murderer, I would start with that guy. Can you enhance it? Yeah. Who can't these days? - You found out Bruno was robbing people, you tracked him down, you asked to be cut in. When he refused, you went to his house the next day, and you poisoned him. Oh, yeah? Is that what I did? Yeah, that's what you did. What it's gonna look like to a jury. We have a witness that places you in his front yard. Where's the painting, Vic? The what? Wait, wait, wait. Slow down here. This is just a total misunderstanding, okay? I was at the hobby shop because I made a promise to James Bruno 15 years ago. To what, poison him to death? No, to kick his ass! I devoted my life to those kids. Bruno in particular. I spent eight weekends in a row in Saturday detention with that smug, arrogant little-- Actually the records say seven. Eight! It was eight! And all that kid did was blame other people for his problems, whining about his mom and his dad. Making my life miserable. So I promised him I would find him one day and pay him back. And that's what I did. I'm glad you're a man of your word. Judge all you want. I've been in combat. High school is worse, mister. Wait, no, wait, wait, wait! I did not go to Bruno's house to poison him, okay? I went to apologize. When I confronted Bruno, he didn't fight back. He seemed, like, resigned. Almost like he wanted me to hit him, like he deserved it. And that's not what I wanted. So I went to his house to say I was sorry. Anyone see you talk to him? Bruno wasn't there. Just that nasty old witch, Frimkes. She saw the bruise on my knuckles, figured I was the guy that beat up Bruno, and threatened to call the police. So I got the hell out of there. She saw that? Yeah. She did. Come on now, baby. Come on. I got my first pair of reading glasses when I was 45. But your medical records show that you have perfect eyesight, and hearing. Agent McGee, it's good to see you again. I-I was just, um-- Walking without a cane? No. Skipping town with a million-dollar painting? No! Going to jail. Dang! - So in addition to being a chemistry teacher who knew 50 different ways to poison somebody, she kept a pretty active retirement life. She totally Keyser Soze'd us. She what? Keyser Soze'd. Uh, Usual Suspects, the movie? Oh, I'm not much of a movie guy. You know, she told us on the drive back that she knew Bruno was a thief, but she didn't want to go to the police because he was trying to get clean. She claims she found the painting and was going to bring it back to the police. - Yeah, killed Bruno and kept the painting for herself. Whoa, whoa, what? Better. Better! Who... who... Who do you think? I kind of like it. I don't. Wait a sec, wha... what's the point of moving desks if were were just gonna move desks? Seriously, I mean to do something like this without consulting anyone? I am the senior field agent. You realize that... Boss, what was that for? It comes with the territory, Senior Field Agent. Did he just physically assault you? - Hey, Gibbs, I feel like you'll want to see this. We found a laptop in Bruno's car. He was writing an e-mail to the police. He was going to come clean, turn everyone in. Guess he figured which version was the real him. The good guy. I'm just not that into movies. So what do you do for fun, besides disrupting people's workplaces? Broadway musicals. Okay, if you start singing show tunes, I am going to shoot you, and then probably shoot myself. Oh, okay, well, what do you like to listen to? I thought you'd never ask. Ah. Go! Hey! - Hey, hey, hey! Hey. Boss. - Hey! Oh. Hey. Ha! Hey. He's gonna learn to love it. Shh. So many years, I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again. And then, I did. In a photo, in a briefing room. And I was being sent to meet him with a gun. This programme contains scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. When this is all done, Steve, I'll suffer for my actions. I'm under no illusions of a happy ending. Shot fired! What's he saying? He whispered something to you. What did he say? I'm not sure what he meant. My job is to find any and all evidence. And what was found in the case? A large number of banknotes. How did Detective Sergeant Arnott react? He didn't bat an eye. I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background. I'd like to keep digging. There's evidence of prolonged torture. Cause of death isn't clear. Cutting his head off can't have helped. This photograph shows Danny Waldron as a teenager. This man's a young Ronan Murphy, the suspect shot by Danny Waldron during Operation Damson. What? They knew each other? And this person bears a strong semblance to Linus Murphy's severed head. Danny knew him too. No prior information of the operation to move Tommy Hunter. I had no prior... knowledge. No prior knowledge, at all. Kate knows about me and Jackie and Danny. I've got to come clean to AC-12. The longer I leave it, the worse it looks. It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy. Rod's body was found hanged at an industrial unit. We need to talk. You are now declaring that PC Rod Kennedy killed Sergeant Daniel Waldron? Yes, sir. Rod killed Danny. Look, I'm sorry about this. It's just that I've got no-one else to talk to right now. It's fine. Look, mate, I don't think I can keep going into the station. All the stuff that's going on behind our backs. All the stuff that's going on to our faces. Yeah, well, Rod was a good bloke, weren't he? You know, people can't get their heads round it. Yeah. I can see why. Look, Jackie, don't do this to yourself. My hands were on that gun and I felt Rod force the trigger. He killed Danny. You know, we was right to stick together, you know, when he was here, but now he's gone. We've got to move on. Ah, come here. Superintendent Hastings. "Hi, sorry to bother you, sir." I just followed Jackie Brickford to a meeting with Hari Bains. "He seems pretty bloody shifty to me." Dot. Just so you know, I've authorised Kate to adopt direct surveillance on Hari Bains. Nice one, Gaffer. Yes, and I want Steve in on it too. Absolutely. Steve, get yourself get yourself over to South Ferry when Hari Bains comes on shift. Be visible. Sir. Come in. Inspector McAndrew, DS Arnott, AC-12. What do you want? In an interview gave at AC-12 you informed us that Hari Bains had a good working relationship with Danny Waldron. Yeah, so? Hari never made any complaints about Danny? If anything, the opposite. How so, Ma'am? I was due to rotate Hari from Danny's squad, but Hari said that he respected Danny's professionalism and wanted to ride on more jobs with him. Really? When did he say this? Couple of days before the Abbots Lane op. You mean a couple of days before the op that got Danny killed? I was all set to disband Danny's team after the shooting of Ronan Murphy and there is no way you're going to pin some blame on me just because you're struggling to find a scapegoat. Thank you, Ma'am. You've been very helpful. 'AC-12.' DC Fleming. Put me through to telecommunications, please. 'Telecoms.' DC Fleming. I need an identification on the last number dialled from a payphone on the corner of Calman Road and Turner Road. 'Stand by.' 'The number you have called is not recognised. Please check the number.' 'The number you have called is...' Kate reports Bains attempted to make a call to this number. It relates to an unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile. Now, the call couldn't be connected because either the phone or the SIM Card was out of service. I've got Maneet liaising with the mobile network provider to see what information we can get about the number. Great. Tell Kate I want her on Hari Bains round the clock. Yeah, will do, Gaffer. 'What the bloody hell are you playing at? 'Making a call from a public box? 'That's why we sent you the unregistered mobiles.' The text came through to my own phone, so I thought... 'Yeah, well, we had to get a message to you urgently 'and you weren't answering. You're being watched by AC-12.' I didn't see anyone. 'What did the text say? ' "Sit tight. Act normal." So how's this acting normal? Dickhead. All right? All right? Look, for my two penn'orth, I think we're flogging a dead horse with Bains and Brickford. Rod Kennedy killed Danny Waldron, couldn't handle the guilt, he topped himself. Maybe it wasn't suicide. We ought to request a second postmortem on Rod Kennedy's body. The first one was only looking for cause of death. We should get a Home Office pathologist looking for evidence of crime. Sure. Leave that with me. Cheers. Do you like chilli? The food. Not the country. I've got a pot... on the simmer. You've probably eaten. No, I haven't, actually. Well? Yeah. Not too fiery? I'll cope. If you go to the trouble of making a pot, you might as well make it last a few days, you know? One night, you can have it with rice. One night, baked potato... It's rock and roll, me. Well, I'm not complaining. By the time I knock off, the only thing that's open is a dodgy kebab. That's undercover, isn't it? Stupid hours. Well, Mark works in IT. He did a lot from home, which was great for childcare. Just not so great for us. You still see the kid, though? Yeah. Sorry, I shouldn't poke my nose in. No, it's fine. It was the right decision. You know, give him security and stability. Just not such a great decision for me, to be honest. See, me and my missus, we never got around to having kids. Was she a copper too? Forensics. I don't see much of her now. No? No, I was on the piss most nights. Couldn't pass a bookie's. Final straw was - we'd put down half on a fortnight in Majorca. Oh, don't tell me. Yeah, five-to-one. Dead cert. I couldn't go home to face the music, so... I took out a loan, put a grand down on the last race of the day, try and win it all back... Barrel of laughs, me, yeah. Can I have your bowl? Cheers. Hey, there's seconds here if you fancy? Any more and I won't get off this sofa. Yeah? I've got something for you, Sarge. "On that photo found at Danny's." Yeah, sure. It's from a boys' home called Sands View. Danny Waldron's mum died when he was 11, and he moved up north to live with his dad and stepmum, but that didn't work out and he got taken into care. Danny was a resident at Sands View from the age of 13 until he was 17. I keep going through the file. There's no link between Danny Waldron and Ronan Murphy while Danny was a police officer. The only link must be this boys' home. Unfortunately, I can't get hold of any records for that period. One council department told me they were lost in a fire, another told me they went missing during an office move. You think they've been lost on purpose? Who knows? The lads were chucked out at 17 and pretty much left to fend for themselves, with no follow-up. However, I've crosschecked with individuals known to the criminal justice system and I've got a name for you. Same age as Danny, so chances are they were there at the same time. Good work. Hey, Joe. Joe! Joseph Nash? Yeah? Can I talk to you somewhere quieter, please? Yeah. I'd like to show you a photograph, if that's all right. It's a photocopy of an original image believed to be approximately 15 to 20 years old. Do you recognise the image? Yeah. Do you recall the name of this location? Yes. Mr Nash, you're not in any trouble. How did you find out my name? I'm not going to lie. You committed a number of minor offences. Look, I was just a kid, back then. I've put my life back together now. The convictions are spent. It was only that your record crosschecked with an enquiry I'm involved with. An enquiry into Sands View? Connected to Sands View. Do you recognise this individual? Yes, Danny. Danny Waldron. Yeah. Do you recognise this individual? Yes. What do you remember about that person? He took us for football on a Tuesday afternoon. He was one of the staff? No, he just took us for footie. What else do you recall about him? You're being a big help, Joe. Is it OK if I ask you about one more person? This man, here. Him. Who is he? Mr Murphy. He was the caretaker. The other man. The football coach. Was his name Murphy too? Might have been. They was a pair. A pair? The older one, the caretaker, he had the keys. For the dormitories. Changing rooms, the basement. But him, the younger one he was in on it too. With the others. What others? Just... Not in the photo. Visitors. We got told they were very important people and we had to do exactly... what they said. Did you ever get the names of any of these people? No. No-one ever got any names. And even if we did, it was just... Mr Smith. What happened with these visitors? Well, sometimes they'd they'd come to the home and we'd be told it was like a private interview. "Mr Smith can be a big help to you when you move on," sort of thing. You know? And then you go to a room with Mr Smith. Or a few of you would. With a few of them. The abuse always took place within Sands View? No, not always. There was, erm... sometimes there'd be a car or a minibus and they'd take us to a hotel, or a guesthouse, or some big some big private home. You know? But the parties... The parties, they were the worst. Parties? There'd be a few of them, these, these VIPs... And we'd be farmed out. Do you recall any details in terms of names, addresses, or the people who drove you to and from these parties? This was a long time ago, all right, mate? And I wish I could remember that information and forget about the rest, but it's the opposite. I know this is hard, Joe. Is there anything you can tell me about these individuals that might help identify them? Yeah, there's one of them... stands out. He's a... He's a big... big fat whale of a fella. He always wore a suit. And when he took the suit jacket off, he always had these, these, these sweat patches and... he stank of it. And when I got told he'd asked for me again, I'd... I'd throw up, you know? I'd be sick. Is Danny the one? The one? Yeah. He's got people listening to us, at last. Yeah. Yeah, he is. Arnott. Any report yet on the second PM? What second PM? Dot said he was organising a second postmortem on Rod Kennedy. First I've heard of it. Leave it with me. OK, I'll head back to South Ferry. Right, I'll tell her. Francis, that was your rep. AC-12 want you in for interview straight away. She doesn't know anything. She never believed us, not for a minute. Jackie, she weren't in the room when Danny was shot. But he whispered something to her as he was dying. Yeah. And if he managed to tell her the truth, do you think she would've kept quiet this whole time? No. Trust me, she don't know anything. Yeah? All right, mate. I've continued to search records relating to Sands View. Our witness, Joseph Nash, claims a number of his abusers were VIPs, all of whom used the same alias, Mr Smith. Hence Nash wasn't able to give us any names. But he did claim one of these abusers was extremely obese. Sports day at Sands View. Who is he? Dale Roach. He was leader of the city council during the period Danny Waldron and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View. Is this the man, Joe? Yeah, that's him. Thank you. Now, it would help if you would come to my department and look through some images of other individuals... Joe, I came from a loving family. Had a nice childhood and I can't begin to imagine what yours must have been like. 20 years it's took you to come here. I want to help. 20 years... I've had that monster in my head. The sounds he made, the smell of him. And the things that he did to us at Sands View... No copper ever gave a toss. Are you saying offences committed at Sands View were reported to police and no action was taken? We told teachers, we told social workers, and yeah we told coppers. And then, we learned not to. Danny Waldron's dead, Joe. He was killed because he was going after the people who did this to you. Danny's mission is now my mission. And I promise you, I will get these bastards. Daddy! Daddy! Hey! Hello, you! Is that for me? Mm-hm. Well, thank you very much. And I will always, always love you, OK? Mm-hm. Come here. How long has he been here? I'd have to check. Two or three years at least. Any family? No family, no visitors. Mr Roach. Mr Roach? ! Can he hear me? He doesn't understand much. He can't talk. What's wrong with him? Massive stroke. Sorry, do you need me to stay? No. Thank you. Call if you need me. Mr Roach, do you recognise the name "Sands View Boys' Home"? Mr Roach? I'm Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott. I'm investigating claims relating to Sands View. Do you understand me? ! Danny Waldron recognised Ronan Murphy as an occasional sports volunteer at Sands View Boys' Home. Somehow, from Ronan, he was able to track down Linus Murphy. Linus was the caretaker at Sands View and used his position to include Ronan, his nephew, in his activities. Now, a witness has given us another name - Dale Roach. Councillor Dale Roach. Unfortunately, Roach isn't fit to stand trial. I think Danny Waldron purposefully created a trail of evidence that led us to connect him to Linus Murphy's murder. And now, we're on the trail of the other abusers. There is only one thing we are interested in here, son, and one thing only. And that's bent coppers. The boys made complaints. Some allegedly to police officers. Thank you, Steve. Sir. Hi. Kate? Come in. Something wrong? You didn't come back to the station. By the time I'd finished with AC-12, my shift was over. So, what's going on? They just wanted to go over the details of the day Danny was killed, times, places. You know what they're like, fishing for inconsistencies. Anything they can pounce on. And did they? Did they what? Pounce. We shouldn't talk about this. What did you tell them, Kate? We can't have this conversation. You should leave. I need to know! You keep asking me to leave you alone. Congratulations, you're on your own. What do they know, Kate? You should go. What do they know? They're onto the pair of you. What about us? They know Hari stopped McAndrew from disbanding Danny's squad. What? ! I never knew anything about that! And they know about the phone calls. What phone calls? Yeah, right "What phone calls?" Bye, Jackie. What phone calls, Kate? ! They've got Hari making calls from a phone box to an unregistered pay-as-you-go number. They know it must be a phone you're using covertly. You two are in collusion, and developing your strategy using untraceable telephone calls. It's not me he's been calling. Stay here, I'll get it. So, what's up, then? Who've you been calling? What? AC-12 know you've been making dodgy calls. They think I'm in on it! All this time, we trusted you. It was just the three of us. Now, Rod's dead and that still isn't the end of it! Jackie, what are you...? Who have you been making those calls to? What aren't you telling me? ! I haven't been making any calls, all right? It's just me and you, and as long as we stick together, then... Jackie, I've been telling you the truth. Yeah, I'm sorry, I know it's late. I need to go in and see AC-12 and I'm going to need your solicitor. Stand away from the door. Ms Denton, you remain under oath. Thank you, milady. Ms Denton... In your examination-in-chief, by your own counsel, you made a number of references to an undercover operation conducted by a Detective Sergeant Arnott of Anti-Corruption Unit 12. Yes, I did. Did any of these operations involve Detective Sergeant Arnott being present at your home? Some did. You were alone with Detective Sergeant Arnott? Sometimes. And on all these occasions, there were no other police officers in the vicinity? There was a constable stationed outside the house. Where outside? On the doorstep. And where did sexual relations take place? In the bedroom. And how was the bedroom accessed? Via the stairs. And how far do the stairs lie from the front door? I don't know, three or four metres from the front door. From the plans of your home obtained by the prosecution, the distance is... 2.7 metres. If you say so. I don't "say so", it's a fact. And if I'm inaccurate, I'll be corrected. There are written statements by all the officers stationed outside the door in early October, and not one recalls hearing you and Detective Sergeant Arnott go upstairs together. Well, that doesn't surprise me. It doesn't surprise you that trained police officers on guard duty, in a high state of vigilance, don't hear the two of you go upstairs for sex when he or she is less than three metres away? We were discreet. Hmm. You've told the jury that this intimacy with Detective Sergeant Arnott won your trust and, therefore, you permitted him unsupervised access to your home. There were times when I was napping or in the bath or the shower and he was free to roam the premises. I trusted him completely. And you've alleged that on one of these occasions, Detective Sergeant Arnott planted a sum of money in your late mother's overnight case. Did you witness Detective Sergeant Arnott bringing the £50,000 into your home? No. Did you ever witness Detective Sergeant Arnott having access to tens of thousands of pounds in cash? He'd hardly do it openly. Corrupt officers have access to criminal contacts. Please answer the question you've been asked. Did you ever witness Detective Sergeant Arnott with such an enormous sum... of cash? I don't know how Steve Arnott got hold of the money and then got it into my house. Ms Denton, you've answered. And I'm still answering. If I'm in accurate, I'll be corrected. Steve Arnott had my complete trust and the trust of the officers on guard duty. He could easily have picked his moment to plant the money and I firmly believe that that is the best explanation for how it came to be there. Because I had never seen that money before. Were you aware that you were under investigation by Anti-Corruption Unit 12? Yes, I was. And were you cooperating with that investigation? Yes, I was. You were being completely honest, to the best of your knowledge, in assisting them with their enquiries? Yes, I was. And had you always been completely honest with Anti-Corruption Unit 12? Please answer, Ms Denton. It was a complex case and there were many details that were elusive and, at times, required further thought and examination before I could give a definitive answer. Did you lie in relation to matters surrounding the conspiracy to murder Tommy Hunter? Ms Denton. As I said, it was a complex case, and many details were difficult to define or recollect. Did you lie about having prior knowledge of Hunter? No. You lied about having prior knowledge of Hunter, didn't you? No. You told the investigators lie after lie to confound them, and to pervert the course of justice, didn't you? It wasn't like that. It was like that. You wove a web of deceit to confound the investigators and to protect yourself, and you have the effrontery to attempt to deceive this jury. No! Did you fabricate the improper relations between you and Detective Sergeant Arnott? No. Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you? No. Lindsay Denton, aren't you an artful, devious person, who has betrayed the trust placed in her as a police officer... No. ...and haven't you repeatedly and shamelessly connived to obstruct those who would bring you to justice? NO, I HAVEN'T! Watching that circus really turned my stomach. Listen, I owe you an apology for the other night. Your... dinner invitation. You're a married man. This is it. But here we are, two colleagues having a drink, and the sky hasn't fallen in yet. Yeah. This is a voluntary interview by authorised firearms officer Victor Charlie 53 in the presence of her Police Federation representative and solicitor, by Superintendent Hastings and DS Arnott. I want to cooperate. I want to go on record that I have never, at any time, engaged with any other officer in covert telecommunications to knowingly mislead lawful enquiries. Glad to hear it. I also want to clarify some details... of previous statements made regarding the death of the time Is that your view of life? Just to be on vacation? I do what I want to do Do you understand why you are before this tribunal? I don't want to go in the army If our country were attacked within the hour would you join the US services? I would not If I told you that I was going to wad up this piece of paper and hit you with it, what would you do? I would duck 2:00pm. KBCR News B- 52 bombers launched a massive air strike... against the North Vietnamese armament centre of Pem Dong only 15 miles from the border with China It's the whole violent thing in America I don't know when it's going to stop I don't know what would bring it all to an end You believe it' obviously getting worse? - Very much so. - All the time With the war and the minorities, the poor it is constantly getting worse and it seems that more and more people ...are willing to turn to violence to take care of it and it seems to be escalating into an unthinkable situation I don't think they're sincere If they're sincere, why don't they riot in wintertime? 2:23pm Temperature 101 degrees Have you ever gone hunting or have your dad or your friends taken you out hunting? Never - You've never shot a gun? - I've never shot a gun You don't know how to handle one? I don't like guns What were you charged with? Refusing induction Agent Donovan, would you read that charge? Conspiracy to aid and abet others to avoid the draft How did you refuse? I just ignored the letter. I just didn't do anything You don't like to travel and, according to the charges you tried to flee the country because of draft evasion How do you reconcile that? It was necessary I wanted to get to some place where I could stay be left alone to do what I want to do instead of all the hassles - Did they just come and take you? - They broke in You testified that you live alone. Do you listen to the radio? Do you have a TV set? I didn't testify that I live alone. I don't have a TV. I have a radio Do you know what's going on that the Chinese are crossing the North Vietnam border and that we're now bombing within 5 miles of the border? Do you realize the intensity that this situation faces the USA? It's getting hard to live here When they arrested me, they roughed me up somewhat That's when my wife was arrested I was just trying to help him They charged me with assault on a police officer The only legitimate thing I can think of doing ...is to use my body or well-being my freedom or life to back up what I say At another time, the honorable or right thing to do might be to be a policeman or to be President Now, I think the honorable thing to do is to be a criminal Would you describe your work as committed, socially? Yes. It's committed But it's not committed to the revolution It's committed to sanity The normal human body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit An increase in body temperature of 6 to 8 degrees above normal for any extended period means death I don't know what any of us could do Maybe if we all got together for one day or for one week and stopped, just stopped doing everything and said... "This has to stop. The fucking war has to stop" We have to do something about all the hate here You were 2 weeks in jail before being brought out here How did the police treat you? Like we were trash They were really... really bad There they are there The pigs are coming! You are apprehended! Your part in the course is concluded We were just told by the Senator about the menace that faces us and here you sit as if this was a picnic You've got shackles and handcuffs and this is a picnic! Stop or we'll shoot to kill! You sit there so quietly This is sickening! You're a traitor Perhaps you haven't had the guard put the cuffs on tight enough I know it sounds a pain for you Out of order. Irrelevant I'm beginning to think that maybe the others had the right idea. There's no reason to react. It'll just bring it down worse He loves this country but "I want to go to Canada" Why does he want to go to Canada? Evade the draft Do you think they did this because they were Chicano? It has nothing to do with Chicanos They're going to do the same thing to all of us This is the first place they're going to look for us They could be right behind any one of these little dunes Temperature 107 degrees Stop following us, huh? He's going to make a choice between Punishment Park and prison and he'll have to make that choice himself The desert heat is a killer It will burn your skin, sap your strength cut your efficiency, drain the moisture from your body and thicken your blood unless you drink water. There will be a temperature difference of 45 degrees between daytime heat and pre-dawn cool Dawn on the second day Temperature 62 degrees Nancy Jane Smith Popular singer and composer Age 19 I understand the defendant does not wish to have you as her counsel That's correct, Mr Chairman. She wishes to defend herself How do you feel? My hands... my fingers are numb I'm afraid of my feet. They... I'm so cold I threw up Did you hear the patrol cars during the night? We heard them in the distance but they didn't come near You were arrested for assaulting a police officer What did you do to him? I was trying to keep him from arresting me The songs that she composes are of a seditious nature She advocates the overthrow of the government in many of her songs One of them I'll read right now Evidence Nancy Smith Sedatious literature "Santa Claus is coming With a bag of bombs and guns "Santa Claus is here The revolution has come "Grab a handful, dip in quick Grant a slogan, make it stick "Right on, Baby Get yours and fight like crazy "We can win, blow up buildings Watch them fall "For hours that we spend Standing in the hall" I bet your mother and father are proud of you Yes I'd like to hear you sing one "Celibate ass-lickers Riding cars made of gold "Taken from the poor They've gathered to their fold "Father Pig leads a flock of sheep Father Pig makes ready "For the slaughter "Celibate snatch-men Their rhythm is the way "Poor ladies get the babies "But Father Dick has the say" Do you know what snatch is? I don't have to be insulted by this little guttersnipe In the psychiatric evaluation of the prisoner, these songs do show a neurotic and schizophrenic tendency Is that your opinion, dummy? Here's what I'm interested in You came from a wealthy family You had the best that this country has to offer Why do you turn against the country? My parents taught me to think ...and gave me certain values of honesty and- - To think? - That's why I'm here Tell people to throw bombs too? They taught me to think and gave me a set of moral values Nothing to do with sex, lady - What happened to the moral values? - I still have all of them What about the songs you write? Do you call those moral? A lot more moral that what you're doing sitting right there. Fuck off! Watch your language Why should I watch my language? Fuck off! Watch your language, defendant What do you think I care what you tell me to do? You're going to kill me in a little while Old man! Moral crap? You said crap! Yes. You make me say crap! - You make me very angry! - Shoot that woman! She said crap! Sit down, defendant What you're doing to the children- What I' m doing? Yes, what you're doing! You make me sick! You're a crazy girl! You ought to be locked up! Why should I be locked up? Why don't you shoot me? Because you're schizophrenic! You're cuckoo! Miss Smith, I remind you that your violent overthrow-of-the-government, financially-rewarding songs really gives you a peculiar kind of freedom... to have your love-ins, to have your pot What is your philosophy of government? What do you believe in? I would take every man that's in a uniform in another country ...and bring him back home and put him back in the world I would take every prisoner out of their cages I would feed every hungry person and take away every rich person's money I would take every person that's tired of working jobs like on the auto lines and have worked for years for nothing and never getting ahead I had to quit school because... I got so fucking paranoid because after Kent State... I realized that I had to put on a cheerleader's sweater with an I love America pin and the people who were shooting weren't even aiming I'd walk out of a classroom ...and be on my way to lunch and get killed just as easily as in the front line of a barricade in a demonstration - Do you have any children? - Yes, I have How many children? You've tried to get into the mind of some of my children They were brainwashed by watching Donna Reed and Father Knows Best By the time they listened to me, they were past their formative years - How many? - I have 3 children How would you feel if one of them died? I'd feel terrible. The course has now been in progress for 24 and a half hours Let us get back to the charges I'll read them again I have a charge to make against you I have a charge to make against you, old man! You old, sick man How many kids have you led to the slaughter? How many kids are out there? Who's getting killed by the guns that I hear? How many children have been through these tribunals? - Silence! - No! How many children have you killed? Who's dying right now? You sent those kids out there I sent those kids out there? Who's dying? Who's dead that was sitting right here? You sat here and with all the arrogance in the world- I don't have to listen to that You don't even hear me Cut it out! You're a phoney! There's no question about this girl being a definitive communist threat Each member of this group is now lacking about 2 quarts of body water I believe in destroying everything that you stand for and everything that you're trying to do I'm complaining? I have the right to complain! Defendant, sit down. Restrain the defendant You're going to put a bullet- Basically, we found ourselves in a situation where we thought we had the entire group of militants pinned down and called upon them to surrender They did not do so and you see the consequences Silence the defendant! Silence the defendant! I've got a couple of young kids. How are you going to raise them? We have at least one more running around What do you plan to do now? We have this gun We'll try to find a place in the high ground and wait for them and, if they don't come, we'll get out We know we'll get them This whole fucking game is like a revolution and we're in it If we don't get them, the desert will We've got to either win or die - Where was he hit? - In the neck I don't much care just so they're hit If we do win, we're going to wreck this fucking establishment and this fucking game They don't understand what's going on in this country They have no idea, no loyalty, no understanding and they respond with violence And the words in her songs... "Throw bombs!" "Blow up!" "Kill!" "Kill!" And who do they kill? Innocent people And she drives the kids here and says we did it Temperature 98 degrees One of the main reasons for having Punishment Park is because, with the type of crime that we have being committed today the civil and social crime we're filling up our prisons faster than we can build new facilities May we ask you what you feel about your duty on the board today? What do you feel about disciplining young people? A number of these young people remind me of a situation I had at home It was one of my own daughters For about a year we had quite a difficult time with her She didn't believe that there would be any discipline and we sort of worked that thing out May I ask you how? I kept punishing her and she kept responding until finally we worked it out quite well You've got to remember that these children are like skilled and trained, highly-bred horses They're trained to go around that track but then you've got to sort of hold them in because, if you let the reins out they'll just run around without any control at all We do get a few oddballs before this tribunal Especially that one that wouldn't kill a fly He said he'd take one of these cups and catch the fly and take it outside and let it free He's probably in 1-A now or Indochina. I wouldn't know I'd rather be in a lot more places than in the desert I have a wife and family back home There are certain things you have to do for your country but for all the abuse and just seeing these characters have no respect for this country... We sit there and try to give them a chance to have a fair say but they don't appreciate it It's a very difficult job to do But somebody has to do it We do our best What would you do if one of your children appeared before you? Oh, my God My kids wouldn't do that. They really wouldn't They've been trained differently I see a running pattern of paranoia in these youngsters This may sound funny I think there should've been more spank and less Spock ...and our youth wouldn't be what they are today These are political criminals. They are not social criminals They have to be shown that their way is wrong We cannot show them by killing them, by building gas chambers or by setting up machine-gun bunkers and covering them with bulldozers This is not the way we like to operate - What's wrong? - Fuck! Fuck! Let's get going But going where? Let's try to make it to the flag How'll we make it somewhere? We have no water! There's no water that way What would your forefathers have done, Mr Kohler if, during the revolution they were all conscientious objectors? If the majority of my forefathers were conscientious objectors it would include the people from England and they would have been acting justly towards the people in the colonies James Arthur Kohler Pacifist. Age 20 ...and they wouldn't have been over here killing the Indians Are you aware of the crisis in this country? ...of the world at large and the responsibility that we have to this crisis? What responsibility do you have as a citizen? My responsibilities as a citizen do not include killing for it I'm not going any further They want us to try and break out They want us to become violent They want us to be like them I'm not going to let them play games with me anymore! Anyone that wants to come with us, come on They want to blow your brains out They're going to kill you. Straight and simple That's what'll kill us! Things like that! Are you familiar with Saint Thomas Aquinas? Yes, I am I think he had this to say about a just war He laid down a proviso for a just war: ...that the war must be decided upon legitimate authority and, secondly, that its objective must be to vindicate justice and that, thirdly, it must be waged with a just intent This was during the 12th Century, before this present time He understood what a just war meant Can't you understand that the policy in Indochina is even justified by a 12th Century philosopher? Those provisos came from Saint Augustine originally and Saint Augustine had a fourth proviso which shows the total absurdity of considering any war just: ...that a war must be waged under the control of a loving disposition that no man is fit to inflict punishment until he has banished hate from his heart Temperature 109 degrees Distance to the US flag 27 miles Defendant, I take it from your philosophy you're opposed to slavery. Is that right? Yes, I am And the Civil War was fought to free the slaves? Speak up, will you? It wasn't fought to free the slaves and it wasn't a just war It was just war because the black people fought for freedom Would you have fought on the side of the black people? Black people haven't gained their freedom! What do you think what's happening right now is all about? We know that there are only a handful of black militants that are running the People's Army. It does not represent the community You are trying to overthrow the government... Charles Robbins member of the People' Army Age 25 Martin Luther King was opposed to your violence and you're talking about a People's Army when you're only a handful To deal with the thing of what you call black militants trying to overthrow the government we're trying to save people because the government is overthrowing itself My loyalty is to the people. People are the most important thing and people have been left out while the cats that run this country have moved and shitted all over You dwell on the black problem It's quite obvious because I'm black I've been to Washington DC and I've seen the schools and ghettos and we're trying to educate and yet you're trying to take over our programs Is that what you're trying to offer? Our own programs? The thing is we don't want to take over your programs... because we know your programs are very corrupt Do you believe you're separatist or a racist? I'm neither. I'm an internationalist You have no chance in hell going the way you're going Two surviving members of Corrective Group 637 have seized a West German sound technician as hostage We're trying to save the people In what way? Through mass education. We believe in education through example We have very functional programs. Example. Right on What kind of example are you? You're a revolutionary Your newspapers show a black militant with a gun "Shoot the pigs!" "Shoot the pigs!" I believe in this It's simple and plain When fired upon, I believe in firing back It's just a matter of staying alive It's like a game they're playing You either win or you die The pigs are running madly through our community slaughtering off our children and our women The truth in America is that America is a sick society America is full of motherfuckers who have shitted upon people Are you afraid to die? No, I'm not afraid to die. That's quite obvious Why are you leading your people into a mass hysteria? When I walk through Washington DC asking why- Hey, man, you're always in Washington DC but you ain't doing nothing in Washington DC! You're out here in California right now sitting on a committee that is supposed to be from this particular area but you spend most of your time in Washington DC How come you're not in Washington DC relating to the problem? Does that make me a pig? I don't to have to call you a pig because you know what you are Would you like me to define what a politician is? A politician is nothing but a debater All that you do is debate issues, you fat pig! You meathead! That's all that you are because you're a lying sucker! You're lying to the camera, to your mamma, to everybody! Quiet! Quiet, defendant! You ain't got no humanity in you because you're a pig! You lying punk! Restrain the defendant Shut him up! Shut him up! Gag him! Shut him up! Defence counsel... Shut him up! What seems quite clear now is that instead of trying to bring estranged and excluded Americans back into the national community the administration has chosen to accept and exploit the division within the country and to side with what it considers as the majority Instead of the politics of reconciliation ...it has chosen the politics of polarization Have you discussed what you'll do if you have to leave him? Or will you try and take him with you? We never thought about it Morning on the third day When the human body has suffered a dehydration of between 6 to 10% it experiences dizziness, difficulty in breathing decreased blood volume, indistinct speech and finally an inability to walk Distance to the US flag 23 miles I'd like to know about violence on the campus I'd like to know why you people do these things A lot of us work hard to build those schools and pay taxes And you people just come along and burn them right down Students don't burn buildings down. That's just a myth It's just a sensationalized myth brought about by the press Students don't burn buildings down and, besides, I don't advocate violence Alison Michener, radical organizer of women' unions co-founder of the National Committee Against War And Repression Age 23 It's a waste of time You try to destroy the Bank Of America try to break in a window. They can build it right up... They have the money, power. That's not the way to change things I'm glad I'm here Some of the guys have gotten pretty upset since the deputy incident I'm afraid they're going to shoot first and ask questions later Have you heard some of the men say that? They've really gotten paranoid I think that people become violent when they are deprived of their basic human needs I think that they become violent when that is their only alternative to achieving the satisfaction of those needs A major component of our democratic society which states that an individual is guaranteed the rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness The rights to life It seems paradoxical to me that a nation with such ideals and such economic power still cannot fulfill or seems unwilling to fulfill basic human needs of food, clothing and shelter The decoy seems to have worked very well It's brought them out in the open They've reached the decoy A country with this economic power and those kinds of ideals still at this point can't feed 11 million people, according to a government survey Your participation in the course is terminated Temperature 111 degrees ...still can't feed 11 million people, can't clothe those people even though they're producing those things in overabundance Now why is that? And if you have someone who can't get food stamps and who can't get on welfare and who is starving he or she can either sit there and watch his children starve or go out and fight for what he needs Stop where you are Sit down, cross your legs and keep your hands behind your head Stop where you are! Sit down where you are! Cross your legs and put your hands behind your head You're under arrest I think they can't hear you Stop where you are! Stop where you are! Stop. Sit down. Go back or I shall shoot to kill I don't think they can hear you. Just a minute Get back. There seems to be some confusion here Stop where you are! Now come on. Slow up. They can't hear you Sit down! Sit down! Sit down! Fuck! Go on! Get the gun! Dear Lord we pray for Harold Violence is inherent in this society. You don't seem to understand that You fucking bastards! Get out of here! The movement went through a long time in history and was very reluctant to make radical changes, to become violent We saw the government would only make changes when we did become violent Violent, violent, violent, violent... Yes, violence, Mr Chairman I think we should realize the dangerous extent to which- You wish the floor, Defence Counsel? - Yes, I do! Yes, I do! - Then get up We should realize the degree in which the violence of the students is now being overplayed and that of the establishment is being minimized You are trying to put radicals on trial as scapegoats for the problems of your own system It's rather appropriate that Harold was a poet There's no place for a poet in this culture It's so hard to have any hope about anything after you see how completely inhuman people can be We must draw this cross-examination to a close There was no need to do that I'm sitting here chained in the chair and you don't need to send these people you train to behave live mad dogs I have a very important part of the hearing to talk to you about... I don't think you know what's important ...the amnesty provision and I want to read it to you Your signing of a voluntary pledge of loyalty that you will not again participate in any form or manner of extra-legal or subversive political activity and that you will not again hinder State or Federal authorities in matters relating to safeguarding of the national security I am loyal to the people of this country, Your Honour or whatever your title is I am not loyal to the government because it is against the people Hands behind your head. Come out Don't shoot them! Don't shoot them! They're all right! Tell them not to shoot! Tell that fucker not to shoot! We don't have any guns! Tell that nigger to put his hands up where I can see them Fuck you! Come on! Come on! Come on! There' a camera crew here! I don't give a fuck who's there Ease up! Ease up! Put your hands behind your head Take pictures of this! They're gonna to kill us! I think there is a chance to make it through this course and I think we're going to do it We have to not lose hope and keep on going We don't have any guns Our choice is whether to submit to this self-destruction passively or violently That's the only choice I see Fucking liar! You'll shoot us in the back! Keep back. Keep back, now So you feel that, just as you feel there' a reason for going on through the course this is the same way to try and deal with what you feel is wrong with the system in America? I think that's right. Yeh I think if you play it by the rules of the people who've set up the game even though they're stacked against you that's the only way to possibly win the game Don't do that! Don't do that! Get down! You goddamn motherfucking weekend warriors! You killed them! Oh, God! Motherfuckers! You murderers! Cut! Cut! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! There' an accident! Put that fucking rock down, boy! Cut the camera! Cut the camera! I feel very little hope for us I don't see any hope either way It's simply a matter of what you believe in Either you believe in non-violence or you don't And, if you do many times there's only one path left to you and you have to take that, no matter what it means to you Now, come on. Help these people! Help these people! Help them Help them That one's dead Oh, you fuckers! You fuckers! You shitty fucking cunts! We've got one left alive, huh? Fucking idiots! We've seen this! We've seen this! We've seen this! Officer Edwards, we've seen this! I don't give a flying fuck what you've seen! This is going on NBC! We've seen this! I don't care if you take it and jam it in your ass You murdering bastards! You fucking bastards! As soon as you get through with your little hysterics... Hysterics, mate? You wait until you see yourself on TV I've been on TV before. I'm not worried Not like this you haven't Captain, should I call for the ambulances? Let the buzzards get the sons-of-bitches. And him too - They threw rocks and... - This man's shook up Leave him alone Why did you kill two people? I don't know. It was an accident - You didn't mean to kill them? - No, I didn't want to kill anyone You didn't want to kill them? No! No! No, I didn't want to kill anyone! It was an accident! Hey! Leave him alone. Leave him alone! - How old is this kid? - He's 18 What' a kid doing in the National Guard if he can't use weapons? - He's trained to use them. - Trained to use them? What do you expect with all those men throwing rocks? - You mean he' trained to kill people? - Yes, he is. To defend his country He's trained to defend his country! You mean he' trained to kill unarmed people like that? It was an accident! It was an accident. They were throwing rocks The gun just went off. I didn't know what happened What are you going to say to their parents? Come on, soldier. Let's go. Come on. Let's go President Nixon in San Clemente, CA sent a telegram for reading at the Artists' Variety show The Chief Executive told the artists: "We Americans are known throughout the world as forward-looking people" The President said the USA is a symbol of progress, of hope and of just and orderly growth B- 52 bombers hit guerilla infiltration routes along along the Cambodian border north of Saigon The afternoon of the following day This has been a session marred by continual disruptive outbursts in direct defiance of judicial authority by the defendants and defence counsel Outburst in the form of constant murmurs... This disruption of a further example of what I've been referring to Marshal, you'll restrain the prisoner if he makes any more outburst Outbursts in the form of constant murmurs and derision shouting profanity and abuse No record, no matter how skillfully transcribed... - We'll have quiet here! - Or what? ...can adequately portray the venom, sarcasm and tone of voice employed by a speaker This has been a session marked by guffaws, cheap theatrics and other affectations used by the defendants in an attempt to break up these proceedings Despite these outbursts, the proceedings have been conducted with impartiality and objectivity as called for by the extreme seriousness of the circumstances Turn him loose! These proceedings have been conducted before a nationwide TV audience in an attempt to clarify for the American people the issues at stake as an object lesson for others who may be considering the wilful and tragic path taken by the defendants Defence counsel, do you have anything to say as to why I should not proceed with the sentencing? Ladies and Gentlemen of the tribunal I would like to read you something "The streets of our country are in turmoil "The universities are filled with students rebelling and rioting "Communists are seeking to destroy our country "Russia is threatening us with her might... "...and the Republic is in danger "Yes, danger from within and without "We need law and order or our nation cannot survive" We might all be forgiven for supposing those to be the words of our President But they are not Those words were uttered in 1932 by Adolf Hitler Sieg motherfucking Heil! We know what kind of law and order followed in that country You ask if I have anything to say to show cause why sentence shouldn't be passed Other than that these are young people with all of life before them full citizens of the USA to whom the Constitution and the Bill Of Rights apply... No, I can't think of anything... Motherfuckers Those bastards - That's it! - We're here That's the flag! We made it What are they doing there? Lee Robert Brown: 15 to 21 years in a federal penitentiary Jay Kaufman: 15 to 21 years in a federal penitentiary William Luke Vallery: 7 to 10 years in a federal penitentiary Nancy Jane Smith: 7 years in a federal penitentiary James Arthur Kohler: 5 to 7 years in a federal penitentiary Mary Ellen Michener: 7 to 10 years in a federal penitentiary Charles Robbins: Life imprisonment At this point your participation in the course is completed You are to be remanded in custody What? Stop right now and no harm will come to you Stop right now and no harm will come to you I don't care how far you've come, you'd better stop Stop where you are and no harm will come to you We made it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Cut! Cut! Cut! Lee Robert Brown, which do you choose: 15 to 21 years or Punishment Park? Punishment Park. So recorded Jay Kaufman: 15 to 21 years in a federal penitentiary or Punishment Park? Hey! Leave him alone! Stop that! Jay Kaufman: 15 to 21 years or Punishment Park? Punishment Park And I'm heading back here so have your troops around this fucking tent! William Luke Vallery: 7 to 10 years in a federal penitentiary or Punishment Park? So recorded Nancy Jane Smith: 7 years in a federal penitentiary or Punishment Park? Punishment Park So recorded James Arthur Kohler: 5 to 7 years in a federal penitentiary or Punishment Park? I'll take the Park Take Punishment Park. So recorded Mary Ellen Michener: 7 to 10 years in a penitentiary or Punishment Park? - Punishment Park - So recorded Charles Robbins with a nod, do you want life imprisonment or, shake your head, Punishment Park? How can he talk? Shake your head- You're gonna kill him, you fucking idiot! Mr Chairman... Clear the court! Clear the court! We've already made the sentences I feel so ashamed Nobody's touching that flag! They were just surrendering peaceably My Christ, I've heard about the American police! I'm glad you got to see it. Tell all your friends about it Send them postcards from England because that's where they'll listen This is going on European TV... I don't give a good goddamn where it goes! ... and France and Germany! Bloody barbarians! Remind you bloody European bastards of the goddamn American soldiers that are dead in your goddamn country when you're talking about it! 10 minutes later - Why did you do that? - Because they goddamn deserved it They killed two officers! That wasn't part of the goddamn game Don't you goddamn come near us We're just doing our job and I'm tired of you hassling us! Can you tell us why you did what you did? For the same reason he did. They had it coming to them They had a chance to stop. Did they stop? I'm asking you Because they rushed us That' not a reason, man! That' not a reason! They wouldn't have rushed us if you hadn't been there... Oh, shit You were one who started this I started it? I told the man to stop. The captain told the man to stop And that's all there is to it. He didn't stop. He attacked me I don't care what the fuck you think You can do with your newsreels whatever you want This is the second night this has happened You could have let those 4 people come straight through Had they wanted to they could have done that We're dealing with criminals who have killed two of my men As it happens these 4 people have not hurt a goddamn fly on the entire desert Do you think we'd let them reach that flag? Do you think they deserve that flag? They belong to this country as much as you do They care about this country as much as you do What the hell are they doing out here? They gave up their rights when they started breaking this country's laws That's what we're here for: To enforce those laws And we do a goddamn good job of it! You're making out like a big humanitarian The only thing you want is to sell this to your goddamn network I don't see you putting any band-aids on anybody All you want is the money for this program You could have opened your ranks and let them go through This happened in Chicago. It happened in Los Angeles Were you at Chicago? Lt'll happen as long as we've got this type to deal with Get the defendants out of here You see what your great land is all about? No, we haven't cheated You cheated. You never intended to let them finish the course You're full of shit You had radios They've obviously been under control You have your opinion. There's nothing that will change it and it isn't worth my valuable time to talk to you Keep these sons of bitches out of here - That's bullshit! - We've had enough of this The 48th Emergency Internal Security Tribunal of the SW region as authorized by Executive Order No. 302 William C. Hoager, chairman, presiding is hereby concluded - What have they done to her head? - They've bashed her about the jaw Since the completion of this film one of the members of its cast appearing as defendant Charles Robbins has been indicted on a charge of conspiracy to bomb The sentence on this charge has not yet been determined For a second charge of assault on a police officer this cast member has been sentenced to 3 years in a federal prison Under the provisions of Title 2 of the 1950 Internal Security Act, also known as the McCarran Act, the President of the United States of America is still authorized, without further approval by Congress, to determine an event of insurrection in the United States and to declare the existence of an "internal security emergency". The President is then authorized to apprehend and detain each person as to whom there is reasonable ground to believe probably will engage in certain future acts of sabotage. Persons apprehended shall be given a hearing without right of bail or the necessity of evidence and shall then be confined to places of detention. KBCR News, the Southlands' most comprehensive news coverage. The President signed an executive order calling to immediate duty 100,000 reservists. Pentagon sources indicate that at least 20,000 of these troops would be sent to North-East Asia in response to the shelling of Seoul, capital of South Korea, last week. Sources gave no indication how the remaining reservists might be used. It was not confirmed that they would help law enforcement officials deal with current domestic disorders. At least 273 Americans are reported killed and a further 492 wounded as an advance force of 30,000 US, Cambodian and South Korean soldiers drove deep into the Hill 98 and Whalesback regions of Laos in the heaviest attack so far since the war was extended. Patrick John Edwards, you are guilty of conspiracy to undermine the national security and intent to incite to riot. You are sentenced to 15 to 21 years in a federal penitentiary. You have the alternative of 4 days in Punishment Park. How do you choose? I'd like to thank the court for its fairness- Silence. How do you choose? Punishment Park. Time 9am. The Bear Mountain National Punishment Park in Southern California. Right there. Stop. You right behind him. Right there. You overthere. Next man. OK. That woman there. The last man in line. Go on into the tent. The 47th Emergency Internal Security Tribunal forthe SW Region as authorized by executive order no. 302, William C. Hoeger, Chairman, presiding, is hereby concluded. The UN today became the focus of world attention as the US delegate challenged the Russians to admit that their submarines had moved into the Caribbean. He made it clear that the US will tolerate no threats to its sovereignty and he accused the Soviets of trying to divert attention from the Middle East. After heated discussion, the US delegate indicated that the communist bloc were responsible for the tripling of our monthly draft calls. He denied the Russian delegate's accusation that the US government is building up a large army for the suppression of its own people. Do you like your job of slaughtering young people? Sen. George McLewis resigned from the Senate after 22 years of active service. He said in a press conference shortly after that he could no longer participate in the dismantling of basic freedoms for which this country was established. In a statement, he mentioned specifically the types of "repressive" legislation which led to his sudden resignation, including the no-knock and stop-and-frisk laws, cancellation of immunity from 5th Amendment cases, preventative detention, the activation of detention camps and quasi-judicial tribunals. He said that he was particularly disturbed by the activities of the Punishment Parks. The Marshal will now bring the 48th session to order. The 48th Emergency Internal Security Tribunal of the SW Region authorized by Executive Order no. 302, is now in session, William C. Hoeger, Chairman, presiding. Reporting a motion for dismissal. - On what grounds? - Constitutional. In particular, 1st, 4th, 5th and 14th Amendments. Overruled. How the fuck can you overrule the Constitution? Keep the defendant silent. I'd like to introduce a motion to have the convictions reviewed separately. Denied. With all due respect to the court, may I move for voir dire proceedings? Denied. Will the court set bail? The defendants have been in jail for months. We don't even know- Keep the defendants quiet! - Bail denied. - Deny, deny, deny! We've been in jail fortwo months and we don't know what we were arrested for. - Keep the defendants quiet. - Shut up! Lee Roy Brown, Jay Kaufman, James Arthur Kohler, Allison Michener, Charles Robbins, Nancy Smith, William Vallery. You stand guilty of conspiracy to undermine the national security and of separate charges and so indicted and convicted at the 5th Emergency Court of the 44th Precinct in the District of Glendale, Captain Edward Rubin, Sheriff, presiding, May 24th. Temperature 89 degrees. At the time of your sentencing, you will be able to choose between a penal sentence orthe alternative of Punishment Park. Punishment Park, described by the US Senate Subcommittee On Law And Order as "a necessary training for the "law officers and National Guard of the country "in the control of those elements who seek "the violent overthrow of the US government "and the means of providing a punitive deterrent "for said subversive elements." You will speak only when spoken to. Each violation of this ruling will result in a citation for contempt for one year in a federal penitentiary in addition to the sentence duly passed. Finally, I wish to announce that we have with us TV cameras of the National Network. Also those of Britain and West Germany. It is hoped to document these proceedings in the widest manner as we know their import to be of vital concern to the people of the free world. Their coverage will be impartial. - Bullshit! - This trial is illegitimate. - This trial is illegitimate- - Quiet! These are the members of Corrective Group 638 and these the members of Corrective Group 637, now sentenced to spending 3 days in Punishment Park. First defendant. - What's your name? - My name is Brown, motherfucker! Lee Robert Brown, well-known author, broadcaster and political activist. I want to be tried by a jury of my peers, black people! In front of witnesses who identify themselves. Witnesses! Keep the defendant silent! Restrain him! No end for the heatwave which has been frying Los Angeles for three months. Temperatures will top 100 for the 12th straight day in downtown LA with the Valley due for 105. Tonight's low will be 79. The deserts can expect mercury readings of 1 15 plus. You have accepted this course as an alternative to your penal sentences. You have 3 days and 2 nights in which to reach the US flag flying 4.5 miles north of the Bear Shadow Mountains. These you can see to yourfront. These mountains are 16.5 miles from where you're standing. You will direct yourselves toward the indicating lights. Pursuit Leaderto 245, ready your signal. You will head past this point immediately turn west - To your left - and proceed 13 to 17 miles along the mountains until you reach a second set of flags. There you will turn north across the plain, pass directly to the following hills, a further 19 miles, and proceed directly to the US flag. Mr Brown, did you actually advocate overthrow of these-our United States? I refuse to answerthat on the grounds that it may incriminate me. That's my right under the 5th Amendment. And overrule that! Defendant, defendant, it's people like you- Objection, Mr Chairman! Let that man alone! The object of this course is simple. Clearthe tribunal! Clearthe tribunal! You must evade capture by the pursuing officers and reach the flag by the appointed time, 10pm on the evening of the 3rd day from now. Each one of them, take them out of here. Clearthe tribunal. Your capture orfailure to complete the course will result in the reversion to your penal sentence. Are you or are you not a member of the Communist Party? Objection. I'll answerthat motherfucking question! Watch your language. Do you think my language is immoral? What do you call that shit you just did, man? What do you call this shit? Give your side-arm to Sepada and go unlock the prisoners. Were you going to call for revolution on that TV? What do you want me to say? I told you the truth. The truth as you saw it? I would tell the truth, the story of black people like it's never been told because you nevertell it. I would say what happens to Chicanos because the fruit-growers ain't gonna tell it. And it's they who buy the time on the television set. I would tell what happens to people who are poor and uneducated and automated out of a job who stand in long fucking lines talking to little people like you with delusions of power... in unemployment lines all day long to be fucked off 'cos your old man didn't ball you right last night. Watch your language. There's a lady in the court. Where? The truth is the fact that you're devouring your children. You're oppressing the people who are powerless in the country. Afew of the people are living- Do you want to listen or do you want to talk? Continue, Mr Brown. Tell us your message. You don't want to hear my message, man. You've spent 50 years evolving a propaganda sytem that'll change the truth it into what you want to hear. You don't want to hear shit that means having to give up something. You don't want it. All you want to do is sit on yourfat ass and draw dividends! Did I react to the names that you called me? As your people just reacted moments ago? You called me pig and other names. Did I react? All I can do is call you a dirty name. These officers have strict instructions not to molest you in any way... orto hinderyou from reaching your ultimate destination. Howeverthey will not allow you to leave the boundary of the course. It has been stated and it's a fact. There are more TV sets and cars owned by black people in the USA than in all of Russia. So what? That shows a very intense interest in the economics of this country in your people. They have a standard of living betterthan any in the world. You can say an identical thing for every animal in the zoo. I'm sure their standard of living has increased. The time is now 9.54 am. At 10 you will commence the course. At 12 noon, that's to say 2 hours from now, the pursuit forces will be set in motion. The pursuit force will consist of a unit of the National Guard, part of the tactical riot squad of a city police department and 3 federal marshals. At the 5 de Mayo Congress Of Chicano Youth the defendant was quoted saying, "I say free your communities, arm yourselves. "Pigs comprehend nothing but force. "Use it. Liberate yourselves. "Off the pigs! Kill the chief pig! Liquidate the mayor-" Anybody can lift that shit out of context. You had your chance to speak. Let Agent Donovan finish his statement. Pig Donovan... This man is calling for violence, forthe destruction of this country. His people are spreading this all overthe country. In my very factory, all kinds of people are reading his stuff. Mainly the colored people. And he's just stirring them up, trying to pose his violent alternatives. You talk as if this is some great civilized, non-violent place. And it ain't. America... is as psychotic as it is powerful and violence is the only thing that will command your attention. This country, this America, was born in violence. Now revolution's a violent thing. I'm in this place right now because my people, my forebears, were violently brought here, like this, in chains, from Africa, where they were violently made to work. It was upon the labor that you so violently wrung out of them that this country was industrialized. Right away, right at first. This land and all the rest that belongs to the country was violently taken from the Indians. Violently. The time 10:03 am. Temperature 91 degrees. Time remaining before the beginning of the pursuit 2 hours. Can I have another one of your cigarettes? Distance to the United States flag 53 miles. They made their choice. They could've done a lot of things but they chose to throw firebombs and conspire to overthrow the government. They're doing what they want to do. I'm doing what I want to do. I don't think any of those kids'll make it anyway. D'you see that one little bastard take off? That Mexican's the fastest thing I ever seen. Time remaining before the beginning of the police pursuit 1 hour and 53 mins. Those kids are running scared. Everybody's running scared. If they didn't break the law, they wouldn't have to run scared. Maybe they don't know what the law is. Everybody knows. If they don't want to take the consequences, let them think before they act. In order to provide what is termed "further motivation", this group have been told that they will find water half-way to the American flag. That long-haired son-of-a-bitch? I think he's in for some real bad stuff. You really got a hard-on forthat dude. I don't have a hard-on for him. He's got one for everybody. He's got one forthe world. So fuck him. If that's how he wants to play, that's how we'll play. Aword about violence. These three days will be only as violent as you want them. Your capture, should that occur, will be as peaceful as you want it to be. An officer will announce that you are apprehended and that your participation is concluded. Should you resist the arrest or should any of you adopt violence in any form, then we shall use those means against you. In short, you can start the violent actions but I assure you that we will finish them. Let's take a minute and get out of here. - I'm staying. - I'm staying too. That man gonna shoot the shit out of you! I'm gonna hide out. I don't know about the rest of you but I ain't leaving another motherfucking step! You're going to bring them down on all of us. Shit! If you don't think they're down on you now... At least we've got a chance. You've got 50 miles of no chance! You're going to go out there and play target-practice forthem fucking pigs! In two hours we can get lost out there. That's the only chance. Here they're going to be on you in 5 mins. You can't make it in the heat. We can't stay! That's our only chance. They're just overthat hill. You're a marksman? - Yeh. - A sniper? A marksman. What do you mean you can't stay here? The ones that are going have got to go right now. We can't wait. If you do a thing with the cops, you're gonna get us killed. Have you ever killed a man? Yeh. Jay Kaufman, co-founder of the National Committee Against War And Repression. Age 28. Time remaining 1 hour 42 mins. This thing with magnum load has enough powerto knock down a rhinoceros, if it's coming at you. We're going to be apprehending very few rhinoceri but, if we do, I want to know that I'm going to be able to stop it. I see by yourfile that you were formerly a candidate for Vice-President of the United States. That's correct. Also that you were very successful- See how much I believed in this system? Make your answers brief. OK. Bop. You say you're against war and depression. What type of depression? A people's depression or a depression in economics? Not depression, I'm talking about repression. Repression. Being oppressed. What were you charged with? Draft evasion and... what they call "hindering the war effort". Are you for war or against war? I'm for war if it's necessary to protect our country. Do you condone the war in Vietnam, sir? - Certainly. - You do. Why? Because it's protecting our country. Who tells you this? Who tells you this war is protecting your country? We're fighting communism. - Well, who tells you this? - I hear it every day. I gather that you're not going to try and make the next 50 miles to the US flag. I wouldn't walk around the goddamn fucking corner forthe American flag... let alone go out in the desert. Time remaining 1 hour 25 mins. Squeeze... and fire. We're going through a kind of a group suicide in America. In a situation where you want to fire two shots rapid-fire, pull the hammer back, fire the first single action and follow it up. Have you any idea how you're going to complete these 50 miles? I have no idea. We're just going to keep on. Do you know the difference between a patriot and a chauvinist? - Awho? - A patriot and a chauvinist. - A chauvinist? - Yes. Define the word chauvinist to me. Chauvin was an officer under Napoleon and his loyalty was so absurd that we got the word chauvin which is chauvinistic, an absurd loyalty. They promised us water at the other end, waterfaucets. They believe in protest and ritual defiance and yet they're willing to participate fully in the rules established by the police forthese games, expecting that they'll come out all right if they make the flag. Squeeze. Fire. Are you expecting to die in the next 2 or 3 days? I expect to die in the next 2 or 3 mins. Yourfunction with this weapon is to hit a man-size figure. You don't have to put out his eye or get him in the heart or knee-cap or pick the heel off his boot like Wyatt Earp. - How old are you? - I'm 20. All you have to do is hit a man-size figure from here to there. I don't think they're trying to kill us. Get him in that area, he's going down and he's going down hurting. They're just making it difficult. This isn't Mexico or other countries where they shoot people like you. What would you do to us if you were in control? Would you be very humanitarian with people like us? I would make more of an effort than you are. What is your moral code? What would you do forthis country? You're sitting back, enjoying the adulation of all these kids. You're indulging in this self-gratification, in some sort of mental masturbation. That's what you're doing right now. How could they have any faith in a man who makes a mockery out of everything that we stand for? The home, true love... You haven't got the first idea about love with your love-ins. You really haven't. If it was up to you, we'd shut down the factories and panhandle on the street. What kind of society would we have then? How would you feed people then? You want us to support you. That's what you want. There is enough food and wealth in this country to take care of everyone and everyone isn't being taken care of. You want to go round the streets and have orgies. I'm not going around having orgies. I'm as concerned as you are about the direction of this country. I really feel sorry foryou. We're the same age and here you are defending a miserable existence. Don't you realize you're being exploited? How those who control the money are diminishing your existence to working in a fucking dirty factory which puts smoke up in the air, which pollutes the world and you're working your ass off for pennies while they're making hundreds of dollars? Don't you realize you're being duped? How they've got your head fucked with? How they have you conditioned? Don't you see this? Are you that blind? Some new kick or new drug comes along, you'll try it. What about some new kick like genocide, napalm warfare? What about those new kicks which this country puts in practice? This is a Remington Wingmaster model 870 shotgun, 12-gauge. What about corruption, police brutality? You are immoral! What about the oppression of the minorities? I am not immoral, Mrs Jurgens! Do you want to know what's immoral? Do you want me to tell you what's immoral? War is immoral. Poverty is immoral. Racism is immoral. Police brutality is immoral. Oppression is immoral. Genocide is immoral. Imperialism is immoral. This country represents all those things. It's loaded with double-aught buckshot. When are we gonna have love? Brotherhood? We're not as long as this little fucking Hitler- Each individual cartridge has 9 ball-bearings in it. And you're sending all the oppressed people to their death! Don't you know that? Are you that fucking stupid? It has not choke on it whatsoever. So the buckshot just flies out in every direction. Insane people who murder the children of their country- And your record, what does that show? What does the record of this country show? Destroying the country from within. You're destroying the world from within! Anything in front of you is totally out of luck when you pull the trigger. What does LSD have to do with death, with murder, with war, with injustice, with poverty, with racism? only got one thing to say: Get off the tracks, because the freight train's coming. Move, move. I hope that's not a sign of the way the rest of the season's gonna go, coach. - Now, why did he have to say that? - Just let it go. I hate this car. Let's find somebody with jumper cables and let's go home. It's bad enough you lose your first game. Now I can't start my own car. This happens to everybody. Don't be embarrassed about it. - Do you have jumper cables? - Oh, sure. - Grant, I wasn't that embarrassed. - Then why did you hide? Why does this house have to stink so bad? You'll get used to it after a couple of hours. Honey, we gotta do something about the car. Because the only thing it does faithfully for us is break down. That's about right. Would it not be better just to get a small new car? - You know we can't afford that. - How do other people do it? Other people make more than 24,000 a year. You make 0000. That takes us to 30. Which is enough to help us with repairs occasionally not with a new car payment. Besides, there's other bills we don't normally have to pay. Like what? Like my doctor bill. You saw her today? - What did she say? - She said that I'm fine. My numbers are normal and she saw nothing that gave her concern. That's good. It doesn't mean the problem is with you. What else could it mean? We just may not have given it enough time. Four years? Are you still hoping we'll have a baby? You know I am. Me too. I catch myself thinking about it more and more. Don't you wanna know if something's preventing it? Are you afraid of getting checked out? Yes. Grant I'm still clinging to a hope that one day we'll have children. I imagine them running in this house. I hear them playing in the backyard or running to our bed in a thunderstorm. And I think about reading them stories and teaching them songs. And I just keep thinking how can I miss someone so much that I have never met? I'll go. Stanley. Stanley, do you wanna tell me what you're doing on the top of my desk? No. Do you have any idea how you got on top of my desk? No. I suggest you get down immediately. You two can tell Coach Taylor the reason you're late for practice today is because you've been sitting in detention. Come on. That was some serious humor. I'll get serious about your humor when you get serious about your studies. Fifty-five? Well, if you wanna announce your grade to the entire class you go right ahead. Fifty-seven. So basically we got the toughest schedule we ever had and less talent than we ever had. At least we got Dewey County on Friday night. That'll be a pretty easy win. I'm concerned it might be our only win. No, we'll pull three or four out. That'll give us another average season. I'm so sick of average seasons. - I gotta go. - Where are you going? - Got a doctor's appointment. - For what? - I have a doctor's appointment. - For what? Leave the man alone. He don't have to tell you. So, what's wrong with you, man? I'll be back in a couple hours. Now look what you did. You done made him mad. Me? You're the one that made him mad. No, not me. Besides, I know where he's going. Where? He's going to the hair doctor. The man is going bald. You hadn't noticed that whole underdeveloped region? Oh, you're one to talk, Slick. No, see, when a black man goes bald, he still looks good. Look at Michael Jordan, George Foreman, Samuel L. Jackson. Classy-looking brothers. Who you got? Kojak? Yeah, coach gonna get him some plugs. - Grant would not get plugs. - Don't laugh. You next. Your soccer skills get better every year, son. It doesn't matter. Shiloh doesn't have a soccer team. They play football. So? Why not kick for the football team? They've already got a good kicker. I'm sure they wouldn't mind having two good kickers. Dad, I'm too small. I really just don't feel like getting killed. Are you saying you're not interested or you'd like to try out but you're afraid? What if I don't even make the team? Well, you're already not on the team. I mean, you can't get any more not on the team than you are right now. - Okay, Dad. - David, you can't be afraid of failure. Everyone fails at some point. So you think I should try out for the football team? Well, if you're waiting around for soccer, it ain't gonna happen. Hike. - Yeah, Sam. - Yeah, baby. Coach Owens, have you got a minute? Yeah. Look, some of the men have been talking. We really wanna see this school succeed with our football program. And I know you feel the same way too. But, frankly, we don't ever see that happening while Coach Taylor is here. Well, you know we're in a rebuilding season. Look, I know he's a fine man and all, but he's had six years here and nothing significant to even show for it. You know, I honestly believe you would make a better head coach. Ready to go. Some of us have requested a meeting with Mr. Ryker. If you would just support us, I really believe this could go a lot easier. Mr. Pervis, I don't know. Look, it's not like we're trying to hurt the guy. What we're doing is for the benefit of the school. You just think about it. Good hustle, Casey. What was that about? What? Alvin Pervis. Oh, we were just talking. Everything all right? - Yeah. - Mr. Taylor. That was great, man. Good job. Yes. I'm Larry Childers. This is my son, David. He's a junior. - We're new to the school. - Good to meet you. - What can I do for you? - I just wanted to introduce myself. David wanted to know if it was too late to try out. - You a football player? - I've always played soccer. - I figured I could try out as a kicker. - Okay. I got a pretty good kicker but I don't mind letting you try out. Jonathan, come here. This is Jonathan. He holds for our main kicker, Joshua Webster. Jonathan, this is David Childers. He wants to try out as a kicker. Why don't you go try a few kicks to get your feet wet? All right, sure. Thank you, sir. If you don't mind, I'll just hang around till practice is over. No problem. Good to meet you. You all just move here? Yeah, from Athens. My dad got a job teaching at the college. That's cool. I'm used to kicking soccer balls, but I thought I could at least try out. Well, Josh is a pretty good kicker, but he's also a receiver. I think he likes that better than kicking. Here you go. I'm sorry. Man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Sorry about that. - It's all right. - Hey, watch it. - Sorry. Matt. - Let's go. - I'm going with Brock for a little while. - Not tonight. You're coming home. - Why? - Don't argue with me. Let's go. - No, Dad. I'll be home later. Matt. That old man still come every week to pray in the hallway? Mr. Bridges. Prays for the students as he passes their locker. How long has he been doing that? He's been praying for revival since before I got here. Lord knows we need it. Apathy in the school's about as bad as our football record. That reminds me. I think you should go ahead and let David Childers on the team. - You see something there? - Well, he's just used to playing soccer. He ain't that strong, but he shows promise. All right. I'll give him a shot. One, two, hit. What are you doing? Go. Let's stay in the game. No. No. Will someone tell me how we lost to Dewey County 21 to 7? Twenty-one to seven. Dewey County hasn't beaten Shiloh since you were in kindergarten. I don't know what you call that junk out there, but it sure wasn't football. Nine dropped passes, four fumbles, three interceptions. Their defense scored most of their points. You gave the game away. You can't win football games if you don't play together as a team. You can't win when you're concerned about what you're doing afterwards. You can't learn plays when you miss practice because you're sitting in detention. I'm sick of the apathy on this team. If we're not here to win football games, then why are we here? So do you agree with him? I don't know. I guess. Only a few guys on the team really seem to care. So are you ready to play in the game? I don't know why they would use me when they've got Joshua Webster. He can kick a 45-yard field goal. I bet you could too. Dad, I can barely kick a 35-yard field goal. At the end of the game, kind of glad I didn't play. That way, I can't mess up. That's fear, son. I just don't wanna embarrass the team. David, I've asked God since you were a baby that he would show how strong he is in your life and that through you people would see how good he is. Then why would he make me so small and weak? To show how mighty he is. Why don't we go ahead and wash up for dinner? We can finish this later. All right. Dad. Okay. I'm okay. - What were you doing? - You missed a spot up there. Thought I could get it for you. I guess I got a little too ambitious. I was just trying to take a swing at it. So, what does that mean? I mean, is there a procedure? Or--? I mean, what are my options? Grant, first you need you realize this is a fairly common problem for men. There are thousands of couples who are unable to have children. You do have options. Although there's only a 10 percent chance of success many couples have tried in vitro fertilization. We can't afford that. Well, the other option is to adopt a child. But it's about as expensive either way. If you're interested, I'll put you in touch with the local agency. I realize this is difficult for you to hear. At least you and your wife can make the best decision now that you know where you are. Sorry. I didn't realize anybody was still here. - Hey, Steve. - Putting in late hours tonight? Yeah, I guess so. I can lock up. You can take off. All right. Thanks, coach. It's about the boys now. I'm not asking you to throw him out. If Shiloh can invest in a winning coach we don't need to be settling for second best. You can let him go with as much class as you want to. - Alvin, he's a good man. - I'm not saying he's not a good man. I'm saying he's not a good coach. Come on, Dan. Just look at the facts. His record speaks for itself. - We need new leadership. - I still think he deserves more time. More time? He's had six years. If he was capable of winning, he'd have done it by now. Grant Taylor is not capable of winning. He doesn't have it in him. That's the whole point. Dan, I'm not attacking the coach. I want my son to have the best football program possible. Look, my son's got a chance for a football scholarship if he's taught by the right coach. Matt's gonna be a senior next year. I don't wanna see him lose this opportunity. Brady, you're awfully quiet. What's your take on this? Honestly, I don't know. Sometimes I think Grant could do a better job of building this program. Other times, I think he's doing just as good as any else would in this situation. Brady, you could do better than Coach Taylor. - What we need is a change. - Now. We're losing booster support, game attendance is down and from the looks of it, we've already lost this season. - That's right. - Dan, we've got a weak program because we've got a weak coach. He's dead weight. We need to cut him loose. Have you been at school all this time? Yes. I tried to call you an hour ago. Is everything all right? Grant, talk to me. I don't know where to start. What's going on? I was trying to lock up for Steve and I overheard Dan meeting with some fathers. They didn't know I was there. Brooke, they're pushing him to get rid of me. Neil Prater, Alvin Pervis, Luke Rae. They said I wasn't capable of winning. Called me dead weight. They can't make Dan fire you. You've still got support. You just go get J. T. and Brady and see him tomorrow. Brady was there. They've just lost confidence in me. I was so sure I could turn this program around and I've just sunk it lower. Brooke, I've tried so hard. Why can't I win? You can win. Stop beating yourself up, Grant. Brooke, I can't provide you with a decent home. I can't provide you with a decent car. I'm a failing coach with a losing record. And I can't give you the children you want. What? It's me. Like everything else is me. We can't have our own children because of me. What's God doing? I mean, why is it so hard? It's okay, Grant. It's okay. "I love you, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my fortress, my deliverer my God in whom I trust my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised. So shall I be saved from my enemies. " Lord Jesus, would you help me? I need you. Lord, I feel like there's giants of fear and failure just staring down at me waiting to crush me. And I don't know how to beat them, Lord. I'm tired of being afraid. Lord, if you want me to do something else, show me. If you don't want me to have children, so be it. But you're my guide. You're on the throne. You can have my hopes and my dreams. Lord, give me something. Show me something. If the Lord never gives us children, will you still love him? Field-goal unit. Hold on, Joshua. I wanna give David a shot at this one. David, come here. This is your field goal. Put us on the board. You're gonna go with David? - Come on, David. Come on, David. - Hit. Come on. It's all right, man. It's all right. You'll get it next time. Dad, I don't even know why they let me on the team. Did you do your best, son? I knew I was gonna miss it before I kicked it. Your actions will always follow your beliefs, David. Dad, I can't even kick it straight. And I can't walk. Should I just stay home and pout about it? If you accept defeat, David, then that's what you'll get. Well, Brady, another fine example of Grant Taylor's wonderful coaching abilities. Look, the kids don't deserve it. The fans don't deserve it. When you gonna get a bellyful of this guy? What's it gonna take? You got a chance, man. You got a chance to step in and take over this program and carry it up for a while. When are you gonna get sick and tired of it? You got an opportunity here. This program's going in the tank. Ryker's gotta-- Grant, he came to me. You're not doing anybody any favors sitting on the fence. You determine which side you wanna be on and stay on it. Mr. Bridges. Revelation Chapter Three says: "We serve a God that opens doors that no one can shut and he shuts doors that no one can open. He says, 'Behold, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know you have a little strength yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. "' Coach Taylor, the Lord is not through with you yet. You still have an open door here and until the Lord moves you you're to bloom right where you're planted. I just felt led to come and tell you that today. Mr. Bridges. Do you believe God told you to come tell me that? I do. I admit to you I have been struggling. But I've also been praying. I just don't see him at work here. Grant, I heard a story about two farmers who desperately needed rain. And both of them prayed for rain but only one of them went out and prepared his fields to receive it. Which one do you think trusted God to send the rain? Well, the one who prepared his fields for it. Which one are you? God will send the rain when he's ready. You need to prepare your field to receive it. So this is your new team philosophy? What do you think? I think this applies to all of life, not just football. Well, that's my point. Ten bucks to who can tell me who won the state championship a decade ago. - Walker Jennings. - No. - North Metro. - Stop guessing. You know it or you don't. - How about five years ago? - Richland? That was three years ago. You can't remember, can you? Leads me to ask a couple of questions. What's the purpose of this team? Win ball games. Then what? We get a trophy. And people talk about us. Maybe. For a while. - Then what? - I don't know. Get a scholarship, play for college and coach Little League. What are you getting at, Grant? You think we're just wasting our time? If our main goal is to win games, then yes. You don't want us to win games? No. Not if that's our main goal. Winning football games is too small a thing to live for. And I love football as much as anybody. But even championship trophies will one day collect dust and be forgotten. It's just that so far all this has been about us how we can look good, how we can get the glory. The more I read this book the more I realize life's not about us. We're not here just to get glory, make money and die. The Bible says that God put us here for him. To honor him. Jesus said the most important thing you could do is to love God with everything you are and love others as yourself. So if we win every game and we miss that, we've done nothing. Football then means nothing. So I'm here to present you a new team philosophy. I think that football is just one of the tools we use to honor God. So you think God does care about football? I think he cares about your faith. He cares about where your heart is. If you can live your faith on the field, then, yes, God cares because he cares about you. He sent his son Jesus to die for us so we could live for him. That's why we're here. But, see, it's not just on the football field. We've gotta honor him in our relationships in our respect for authority, in the classroom and when you're at home alone surfing the internet. I want God to bless this team so much, people talk about what he did. But it means we gotta give him our best in every area. And if we win, we praise him. And if we lose, we praise him. Either way, we honor him with our actions and our attitudes. So I'm asking you, what are you living for? I've resolved to give God everything I've got then I'll leave the results up to him. I wanna know if you'll join me. Your attitude's like the aroma of your heart. If your attitude stinks, it means your heart's not right. He sure is preachy today. What? How's your attitude, Brock? It's fine. Then you'll be okay with the death crawl, right? All right, everybody on the goal line. Get your partner. Let's go. All right, let's go. Show me something. Ten yards. Move it. Let's go. Matt, let's go. Let's go, Jonathan. Show me something. Ten yards. Show me some power. No knees. Keep your knees off the ground. Show me something. Here we go. Ten yards. Show me some muscle. Show me some power. Give me some heart. Let's go. Very good, boys. Very good. Let's run it back. Man. Brock. - Man, that's not even funny, dude. - Oh, yeah, it is. So, coach, how strong is Westview this year? A lot stronger than we are. You already written Friday night down as a loss, Brock? Well, not if I knew we could beat them. Come here, Brock. You too, Jeremy. - What? Am I in trouble now? - Not yet. I wanna see you do the death crawl except I wanna see your absolute best. What? You want me to go the 30? - I think you can go to the 50. - The 50? I can go to the 50 if nobody's on my back. You can do it with Jeremy on your back but promise you're gonna do your best. All right. Your best. - Okay. - You gonna give me your best? I'm gonna give you my best. All right, one more thing. - I want you to do it blindfolded. - Why? I don't want you giving up at a certain point when you can go further. Get down. Jeremy, get on his back. Now, get a good tight hold, Jeremy. All right. Let's go, Brock. Keep your knees off the ground. Just your hands and feet. - A little bit left. A little bit left. - Come on, Brock. Come on. There you go. Show me good effort. That away, Brock. You keep coming. - There you go. - Come on, Brock. - Come on. - It's a good start. Little bit left. Little bit left. There you go, Brock. Good strength. You gotta be kidding me. - That's it, Brock. That's it. - Am I at the 20 yet? Forget the 20. You give me your best. You keep going. That's it. Now don't stop, Brock. You got more in you than that. I ain't done. I'm resting a second. You gotta keep moving. Let's go. Don't quit till you got nothing left. There you go. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving, Brock. That's it. You keep driving. Keep your knees off the ground. Keep driving it. Your very best. Your very best. Your very best. Keep moving, Brock. That's it. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Don't quit on me. Keep going. Keep driving it. Keep your knees off the ground. That's it. Your very best. Don't quit on me. Your very best. Keep driving. Keep driving. There you go. There you go. That's it. You keep driving. Keep your knees off the ground. Don't quit till you got nothing left. Keep moving, Brock. That's it. That's it. That's it. Keep going. I want everything you got. Come on, keep going. - It hurts. - Don't quit on me. Your very best. Keep driving. Keep driving. There you go. There you go. - He's heavy. - I know he's heavy. - I'm about out of strength. - Then find more strength. But don't you give up on me, Brock. You keep going, you hear me? You're doing good. You keep going. Do not quit on me. You keep going. - It hurts. - I know it hurts. You keep going. You keep going. It's all heart from here. Thirty more steps. You keep going, Brock. Come on. - Keep going. - It burns. - Then let it burn. - My arms are burning. It's all heart. You keep going, Brock. Come on. Come on. Keep going. You promised me your best. Your best. - Don't stop. Keep going. - It's too hard. It's not too hard. You keep going. Come on, Brock. Give me more. Give me more. Keep going. Twenty more steps. Twenty more. Keep going, Brock. Give me your best. Don't quit. No. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Don't quit. Don't quit. Don't quit. Brock Kelley, you don't quit. Keep going. Keep going. Go, Brock Kelley. You don't quit on me. No, you keep going. You keep going. Go, Brock. Ten more steps. Ten more. Ten more. Ten more. Keep going. Don't quit. Give me your heart. - I can't do it. - You can. You can. Five more. Five more. Come on, Brock. Come on. Don't quit. Don't quit. Come on, Brock. Two more. One more. That's gotta be fifty. That's gotta be fifty. I don't have any more. Look up, Brock. You're in the end zone. Brock, you are the most influential player on this team. If you walk around defeated, so will they. Don't tell me you can't give me more than what I've been seeing. You just carried a 140-pound man across this whole field on your arms. Brock, I need you. God's gifted you with the ability of leadership. Don't waste it. Coach. Can I count on you? Yes. Coach. What is it, Jeremy? I weigh 160. All right. Who's next? Good practice, boys. See you all tomorrow. Hey, man, for the first time in a while, I actually feel good about Friday night. Yeah? Why? I'm just on board with what you're doing. If they get a hold of it, it'll change their lives. You count me in. Grant, me too. Yeah? Yeah. I feel like I owe you an apology. I just want you to know that I'm with you. Thank you. See you tomorrow. - You need a ride, Matt? - No, my dad's coming. Or at least, he'd better be. Can I shoot straight with you for a minute? Sure. I feel like you owe your dad more respect. - Why? - Because he's your father. - You don't know him like I know him. - I don't have to. You need to respect him because it's the right thing. You know, coach, my dad doesn't even like you. He thinks the school needs to find somebody else. That's beside the point. Scripture says to honor your parents. - And all you do is complain. - All he does is boss me around. He doesn't even try to understand me. Matt, you can't judge your father by his actions and yourself by your intentions. It doesn't work that way. You're not responsible for him. You're responsible for you. You honor God by honoring your authority. You really believe in all that honoring God and follow Jesus stuff? Yes, I do. Well, I ain't trying to be disrespectful but not everybody believes in that. Religion works for some people but I'm just here because I got kicked out of Westview. Matt, nobody's forcing anything on you. Following Jesus Christ is a decision you're gonna have to make for yourself. You may not wanna accept him. Because he'll change your life. You'll never be the same. I do hope one day you realize how much he loves you. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. I'll get him. Just give me the bag. - Bring that trash bag. Set it down. - Don't you let that touch me. I'm not gonna let him touch you. I'm gonna get him out of here. - Oh, man, he stinks. - I can't believe that was in my house. - Just make sure it's still dead. - It's dead. He's probably been dead for weeks. Oh, there you go. You just get it out of here. Out. Out. - Stop being af- - Come here. Look at it. - No. It looks like a big hamster. Just-- Come here, come here. Don't be afraid. Just face your fear. Look. He's got a cute little tail there. He's just got a big stink. Look. See his cute little eyes there? See his teeth? Look at his teeth. Almost looks like he's mad. You're terrible. I can't believe you did that to me, Grant Taylor. You are so bad. David, right down the middle. You got this. Right, set it up. Run it again. - Sorry, coach. - David, listen, son. You act like you gonna miss before you even kick the ball. See, we're gonna have to change your whole kicking philosophy. Now, see, you're kicking wide left or wide right. But that ain't what's gonna get you home. The ball has got to go through the middle. - I know, coach. - No. No, you don't. Now, what does Scripture say about this? Scripture says: Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be that find it. Now, to us, that's wide left and wide right. But narrow is the gate and straight is the way that leads to life, ... and few there be that find it. Anybody can kick it wide left or wide right. My mama can kick it wide left and wide right. - That ain't what's gonna get you home. - Come on. It don't have to look pretty. It don't have to look smooth. It can look like a dying duck. But the ball has to go through the middle. Oh, my word. Now, David, you gonna have to choose the narrow way. That's the only path where you will get your reward. Now send this ball through these pearly posts. Set it up one more time for me, Jonathan. David, I've never heard it that way before but there's a lot of truth to what he's saying. Let's see you kick it. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Grant, are you not aware of what's going on outside on the field? What? You might wanna come check this out. Mitch decided to bring his Bible class outside today. After he started teaching, Matt Prater accepted Christ as his Lord. It was awesome. He started confessing stuff from his life he started asking his friends for forgiveness. Next thing we know, Bob Duke stands up and does the same thing. Kids start breaking up into groups, they begin to pray for each other. They ask forgiveness for sins they've committed. This has been going on for hours. How did you not know what was going on? Bless them in a special way. Lord, I ask you to lift them up to you. I ask you to bring up a generation that has a heart for you, Lord. Coach. - I'm proud of you, Matt. - I need to talk with my dad. I'd like to go see him. I'll take you right now. So, what we've done here is we've gained these four lots by moving the retention pond down here. We could try and do that through here. No. I like this. That's perfect. Mr. Prater, there's someone here to see you. - Sarah, I'm in a meeting. - It's your son. - Would you like me to step out? - No, it's okay. Sarah, send him in. Matt, you okay? I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't know you were in a meeting. What is it, son? Dad, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. I got right with God today and I just needed to say that from now on I'll respect your authority. Whatever you say goes. That's it. You know, I could come back tomorrow if that would be better for you. No. It's okay. I'm sorry. I... For what it's worth I'd give my right arm to hear my son say that to me. I feel like I'm standing before a new team tonight. It's a new day and a new game. What you've experienced in your hearts is about to be released. Stay humble but confident. Why don't you take this one, Brock? Lord, we know our lives are not about football but we do thank you for allowing us to play tonight. Lord, we're gonna give you our best. If we win, we'll praise you, and if we lose, we'll praise you. We'll give you all the honor and the glory for this night. Keep us safe. - Amen. - Amen. All right, guys. Look at me. Play hard, have fun. Hit. Yeah. In the Old Testament, Nehemiah had the task of building a stone wall around his city for protection. But he didn't have enough people or resources or time. But because each person worked on the wall in front of their house they got it done in record time. That's what you're gonna do. On defense you have to resolve nothing gets by you as an individual nothing gets by us as a team. I need you to build me a stone wall. Get on that, D. Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Roll through there like you're soul-struck. Come on, now. Come on. Hit somebody. I wanna see some hitting. I wanna see hitting. Dig those feet. Come on, you ain't on my team yet. You're not on my defense. You gotta dig those feet. All right, Prater. Get in there, boy. Let's go. You gotta hit him a little harder than that. This ain't ballet practice. This is football practice. David. Double-sweep pitch lift. Pro 45 flex. Man, even a 26 Powerhouse. - Man, these are some good plays. - We're gonna run them. Man, we got all type of potential on this sheet. When? - We're gonna run them, I promise. - Yeah, see? You always tell me you're gonna run them. - You don't wanna run my plays. - Hey. It's all right. Where's my car? - Where'd you park it? - Right here. You sure? Because there ain't no way it got stolen. Man, you couldn't pay nobody to steal your car. - Did the boys do something with it? - Man, I don't know. Hey, man, there's a note on this truck for you. - What does it say? - Let's see. It says, "Grant Taylor, the impact you made on our school means more to us than you'll ever know. The Lord has used you to meet a need in our lives and now we want to meet a need in yours. You'll find the title of this new truck in your name. Please accept it as our way of saying thank you. " Somebody done gave you a truck? Man, this title got your name on it. You got to be kidding me. Grant Taylor, somebody done gave you a new truck. This is my truck? Is this just because you head coach? Because I'm assistant coach. You'd think I'd get a moped out of this or something. Oh, Lord, you've given me a truck. Well, it's your truck. Drive it. Not a word to anyone. Yes, sir. That's right. No more jumper cables. Break. Brock. Brock. - You watch him. You watch him. - Sure. Hut, hut. - Go. - Go. Go. That's right. That's it, baby. You got it, Brock. That's right. - Yes, sir? Can I help you? - Please. I'd like to buy a nice bouquet of wildflowers for my wife. I see. That's awfully sweet of you. Oh, yes. I've got a special evening in mind for her tonight. Well, in that case, you need a card to go with those flowers, don't you? I've got the perfect one. I'm gonna give it to her at her favorite restaurant. Oh, really? I'm sure she'll be happy. Oh, she will. So I need your nicest, largest flowers and money's no object. - You see, I got a raise today. - You did? - Six thousand dollars. - Are you serious? That's exactly the way my wife's gonna respond. Grant. That's awesome. You know, you sure got friendly service here. Hello again, everybody. This is Lane Lavarre, along with Dale Hansen coming to you tonight from Princeton Heights Academy the site of tonight's opening round of the GISA football playoffs. For the first time in a decade the Shiloh Eagles find themselves in postseason play. Coach Grant Taylor's gonna have his hands full as he takes on the Panthers who haven't lost a game all season. All right, huddle up. Stay sharp, stay focused, play hard and honor God. - Eagles on three. One, two, three. - Eagles. Sweep. So after an impressive seven-and-three record the Shiloh Eagles fall short tonight in the first round of the GISA playoffs. Twenty-eight to 10 is the score. The Princeton Heights Panthers take it to the Shiloh Eagles. I knew we were gonna get killed tonight. Your effort was good tonight. You've got nothing to be ashamed of. You played hard. The Shilohs had the best season they've had in a long time. God's been good to us this year. Guys, coach is right. We're gonna praise God when we win, we're gonna praise him when we lose. Let's take a knee. - Hey. - Hey. I wish by some miracle we could have won tonight. They worked too hard to walk away with their heads down. You know, I was hoping God would give us just one win in the playoffs. They deserved it. You know, if you'd told me two months ago that we'd be playing Princeton Heights in the playoffs... - ... I would not have believed you. - Yeah. If you'd told me our school was having a revival, I wouldn't have believed you. - This ain't been a bad year. - Got all the jerseys? All 32 of them. But I ain't ready to put them up, though. I'm ready to go another round. You and me both. Part of me wanted to get to state. - To state? Grant, are you serious? - Why not? As hard as they worked? Well, working hard is one thing, but to take this team to state? - That'd take an act of God. - Has he not been acting already? He has, but do you know who's gonna be waiting for whoever gets to state? - The Richland Giants. - That's right, the Richland Giants. And Bobby Lee Duke will be there with his 85 players ready to spank whoever made it to the state playoffs to kingdom come. - I'm not afraid. - I know you're not afraid. Because you ain't going. Oh, by the way, man, some man called looking for you today. Who? Stan Shultz. - Stan Shultz? - Yeah. Stan Shultz. Isn't that the cartoonist? That's Charles Schulz. I thought Charles Schulz was that man that flew across the ocean in the Spirit of St. Andrew. That's Charles Lindbergh, and it was the Spirit of St. Louis. - No, Lindbergh is a cheese. - Limburger's the cheese. Lindbergh's the man. No, Lindbergh was that blimp that blew up and killed all them people. That's the Hindenburg. No, Hindenburg is where you go skiing in Tennessee. - That's Gatlinburg. - Gatlinburg? You mean like the country music group, the Gatlinburg Brothers? You guys are crazy. Grant Taylor. Well, Mr. Shultz, I was told you were looking for me. Yes. Am I sitting down? Why do you ask? Hey, coach, what's going on here? Coach is on his way to let us all know. All right. All right, everybody. Bring it in. I want you to know I serve a big God and he can do whatever he wants to do. He can open what he wants to and shut what he wants to. A team that plays for his honor and glory will have his blessings following that team. Unlike those who try to cheat their way to the top, like Princeton Heights did when they played two ineligible 19-year-olds. They have been disqualified and we're advancing to the next round. Get your pads on for practice, boys. We're going to war with Tucker Friday night. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the GISA quarterfinals. Who would have thought we'd be seeing the Shiloh Eagles tonight in a contest against the Tucker Tigers? With Princeton Heights disqualified call this an early Christmas present for Shiloh. Offense, put it in the end zone. Defense, build me a wall. - Eagles on three. One, two, three. - Eagles. Blue, 18. Blue, 18. Set. Hit. Hit. David. This is your field goal. It belongs to you. Put it through. We're putting David in. David. Hit. Yeah. There you go. There you go. The Tucker Tigers are nursing their wounds as they face the end of their season. The Eagles, however, have a little farther to fly. All right, what kind of sick are we talking about? I don't know. I've just felt really nauseous the last two mornings. - And then I feel fine again. - You haven't eaten anything weird? Not unless fruit and cereal's weird. Brooke, my gut says make an appointment with the doctor. I've been there three times this year. It's getting embarrassing. I'm just telling you what I would do. You can even use my car. With five seconds left, the score still stands in Oakhaven's favor 17 to 14 over the Eagles. Grant Taylor calls the play in to Zach Avery who pulls the huddle together for their last shot at going to state. It's third down and goal for the Eagles and the crowd is going crazy. They line up in an I formation. This is do or die for the Eagles. Zach takes the snap and will give it to Jacob Hall for- - No, it's a fake. He's got Nathan Markle open in the corner. The pass is up. He's got it. Touchdown Eagles. Touchdown Eagles. Zach Avery completely faked out the defense and made a perfect pass to win the game 20 to 17. Can you believe this? The Shiloh Eagles are actually headed to the state championship. A team with only 32 players has made it to the big dance. Oh, my. On the eve of the GISA football state championship the Richland Giants prepare to defend their reign as lords of the gridiron. It's no surprise they've returned for this game. What is surprising is who they're playing. The Shiloh Eagles who started the season oh and three, have come out of nowhere and through a bizarre set of circumstances now face a team almost three times their size. Sleep at all last night? Are you nervous? It's a weird emotion. Part of me thinks we're gonna get crushed tonight part of me thinks God may do something awesome. Sounds like your fear's about to clobber your faith. Something like that. When are you going out there? I might leave early, if that's all right. Just don't worry about me. I'll just meet you at the game. Okay. Either way, you're still playing for a state championship. Juice. There's some juice. Do you see that? This is? - Apple. - Apple. Good. - Where's the duck? - Duck. - Zebra. - Zebra. Zebra. Cat. Duck. There's the pig. Brooke Taylor's here again. Maybe she'll be pregnant this time. I hope so. - You ready, son? - I can't find my cleats. They're right here by the door. Thanks. You realize you're playing for the state championship tonight? I don't know why I'm so nervous. I'm not even gonna play. You know I'm proud of you, don't you? Yes, sir. Don't ever doubt it. Whether you play or not... - ... I'll be right there praying for you. - Thanks, Dad. Let's go pick a fight with some giants. Here's the results for B Taylor. Oh, I'll take that. - Negative? - Yes. I will still love you, Lord. I will still love you. All right, God. You got us here. Whatever happens, may you get the glory. - Coach, what are you doing here? - You're at the state championship. Any time a former player gets this far, you know I'd be there. - It blows me away. - Well, how you feeling? A little bit nervous. This championship, it's kind of surreal for me. I promise you, I don't care what level of ball you're coaching it's surreal when you make it to the championship game. And Grant, I can tell you, I'm so proud of you and what you've done. I've been reading about the team and where you've gone. And I'm just proud of the fact that you finally learned how to win the big one. - We haven't played them yet. - You won when you accepted Christ. Now, as you're teaching these guys and minister to them I think it's just fantastic. I got it. These players got it. Well, I can promise you, win or lose this game, you guys are champions. - I appreciate that. - But while you're here you might as well win it, huh? I'm gonna try my best. You know, this team we're playing, they're huge. They're fast, they're strong. I just don't want my players to be afraid. Well, in God's word, he said 365 different times, "Do not fear. " If he says it that many times, you know he's serious about it, don't you? I would guess so. I needed to hear that. Well, look, you're gonna do great tonight. I know you're busy. - I'm gonna go and cheer you on. - Good to see you. - All right. God bless you, man. - Thanks, coach. In about five minutes we head out for the warm-up. I wanna say two things. Number one, I love you and I'm proud of you. I wouldn't trade this season for anything in the world. Secondly, you're about to play the biggest team you've ever faced. They're strong, fast and undefeated. So far. But I want you to remember where God has brought us. I want you to remember how hard you've worked. We weren't supposed to have a winning season, but we do. We weren't supposed to advance through the playoffs, but we did. We're not supposed to be here, but we are. So if anything in you says this is a losing effort, throw it out. Because as I stand here, I believe that as long as we honor God nothing is impossible. Nothing. Leave everything out on the field. Give your best to God tonight. Whether we leave the field the victors or not, we will give God the glory. Now who will go fight the Giants with me? You've gotta be kidding me. The Giants elect to receive after the coin toss. We're just seconds away from the state championship game. Dale, it is impressive that Shiloh has made it this far but the field tonight really looks lopsided. It definitely does. I'm looking at 85 players on the Richland sidelines as opposed to 32 for Shiloh. Even if the Eagles had great talent, they can't bring in fresh players. That's really gonna hurt in the second half. All right. Let's go, Joshua. The Eagles kick it off and the state championship game is underway. Jerod House will receive the kick and he'll head down the field. He gets a couple blocks and breaks outside. He's got daylight. But the Eagles will take him down around the 50-yard line. That's where the Giants will set up shop. First down and in good field position to start this state championship game. Get up there. Brock, watch them up the middle. Come on. Let's go, boys. Wes Porter will call the play for the Giants. He steps back to pass. He's got Damien Fuller streaking down the sideline. He lets it fly. Fuller will take the pass in, he will race into the end zone untouched. And the Giants strike early here in the game with the first score. Welcome to state-championship football. Hey, man, this is a whole new level. They are quick off the line. We've gotta stay back. The Eagles will start this drive at the 19-yard line. Zach Avery drops back to pass and he passes to Jeremy Johnson. But the pass is batted down by the Giants. That's right. That's the way we do it. Avery hands it to Jacob Hall, who tries to run up but he gets absolutely nowhere as he is swamped by defenders. Ten, 10, hit, hit. Eagles look to pass. Here come the Giants. They're gonna get the sack. That's gonna force the Eagles into a punting situation on fourth down. Baby, ain't that pretty? Jerod House will receive the kick and he'll head down the field. He breaks outside. He's got some daylight. Okay. All right, time- - Ref, timeout. After gaining eight yards, the Eagles give up another sack. They're gonna have to punt it away on fourth down. Dale, so far it's been all Richland. - I should not have called that play. - They're all over us. Nobody's open. - They're knocking us around. - They're getting cocky. We cannot let them play their game. Defense, blitz on first down. We've gotta get them off their rhythm. Let's go. No. Field-goal unit. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Good job. Good job. Keep it up. What universe are you in? Get in the game. So with a few seconds left in the first half the Giants were gonna take a three-touchdown lead but after an Eagles interception, we've got a 14 to 7 football game. We can't keep running our normal plays. Their defense is killing us. I agree. We cannot outmuscle them and we cannot outrun them. We've gotta outsmart them. - Trick plays? - Just enough to keep them guessing. You see another way? You just can't use them too often, though. - They catch on, we toast. - We're toast if we don't put points on that board. We gotta make it through the fourth. And they got a deep bench. We're still in the game. Good job on the defense getting us on the board. I believe they thought this would be a shutout. We're gonna keep surprising them. You've figured out they've got power and speed, they're big but they're also predictable. We have gotta stay together. We can't outrun them, but we can outsmart them. With the Giants leading 14 to 7, we get set to bring you the second half of this championship game. And unless the Eagles find a way to solve Richland's size and strength the Giants could very well be taking home their fourth state title tonight. Make it work, Zach. The Eagles come out with a little trickery. And they're just about to tie this football game. Hustle, hustle. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Make them pay, boys. Make them pay. Come on. That was dirty. He's hurt. He's hurt. He's hurt. Joshua Webster's being helped off the field with what we have been told is a broken collarbone. That came after a late hit by the Giants after the Eagles tied the game. - Stupid. That was dirty. - Calm down. This is a new ball game. Joshua's gonna be all right. David, come here. You gotta cover for Joshua now. - I need 110 percent. - All right, coach. Be the man. Kickoff team. Let's go. After a long drive, the Giants score. The Eagles prevent the conversion leaving this a 20 to 14 football game. Why are they on the scoreboard? They shouldn't even be in this game. For the rest of your life, you will remember today. I want you to remember you held nothing back, you did not lose heart you did not stop fighting, you did not quit. They're like little dogs nipping at your heels. Now get out there and stomp them. That's what I'm talking about. That's my defense. Let's go, Eagles. He's going for a bomb. Let's go. He's going for a bomb. Don't get beat. Go. The Eagles have shown the determination of a school twice their size. The Giants will now attempt a 35-yard field goal to extend their lead. That is the last time we go for a field goal. We should be in the end zone every stinking time. Double flex wall. Double flex wall. And hit. Go. Go. Go. What are you doing? Field-goal unit. Go. Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. - Good job. All right. That's my team. Coach, I need a rest. I can't go much more. I need you on that field. You have gotta stay in the game. I need you. Yes, sir. David Childers is in to kick for Joshua Webster. We understand this is his first season. He's gone three for four this season. Looking at the stats, he's been limited to short-range kicks. Come on, David. You got this. Yeah. Timeout, ref. Ref, timeout. Coach, I'm done. Someone else has gotta lead. Brock, this is when it matters most. I know you're tired. It's easy to lead when you're strong. But now is when you lead us, right now. Can you give me four more downs? I just need four more downs. Four more. All right, come here. Come here. This is our time and you've got to put the nails in the coffin. Look at me. We didn't fight this far to give up in the last quarter. Leave everything on the field. And field goals, they're not an option. I need you for four more downs. Who's with me? Now get out there and get it done. With less than two minutes left, the Giants stand on the verge of their fourth-straight consecutive state title. A tired Eagles team lines up to face them yet again. Stone wall. Stone wall. Yes. Stone wall. - Stone wall. - Stone wall. Stone wall. Stone wall. The Giants line up first and goal. This score will solidify the championship. Hand the- - No, wait a minute. He is stopped. The Eagles are still in it, showing determination to fight this one out. Three more downs. - Three more. - Yeah. You gotta hang with me. I know it's getting tough. We gotta stop them here. It's second down and goal to go for the Giants. The state title is within their grasp. Both of the stands are on their feet as they get ready to run this play. Wes Porter will take it. No, the Eagles have stopped him again. That's my team. That's my team. Come on. Get it in the end zone. Two more. And here we go again. They're gonna try it again. Wes Porter will take the snap. He's looking to pass into the corner. But the Eagles bat down the pass. The crowd is going nuts right now. The Giants have been kept out of the end zone on three straight plays. Now Bobby Lee Duke will have a big decision to make. - We have gotta go for a field goal. - We are not going for a field goal. He's not kicking it. Brock. Brock. One more down. One more down. It's fourth down and the Giants are going for the touchdown. This crowd is going absolutely berserk right now. They line up at the one-yard line. Wes Porter's gonna take the snap. Brock Kelley's gonna meet him head-on. And there's a fumble. The Eagles have the football. They're taking it down the field. He's at the 40. He's at the 50. He's at the 40. He'll be run out at the 34-yard line. Are you believing this? With two seconds left, the Eagles have got a shot at this football game. - We've got time for a Hail Mary. - The defense is too strong. No, we can't run it. That's our only option. You gotta kick it, man. David. I need a 51 -yard field goal. - I can't kick that far. - They've stopped the pass all night. - You're my best option. - The furthest I've kicked is a 39. There is no way I can kick a 51 -yard field goal. I believe you can. Do the best you can. Leave the results to God. I need you on that field. Field-goal unit. Grant, we've gotta throw it. He can't kick it. It's too far. - No, it's not. - What are you doing? I'm preparing for rain. I don't understand, but with two seconds left the Eagles are putting the game in the hands of a 145-pound backup kicker. This is not a good move. He even has to kick into the wind. David. He's not ready. He don't think he can do it. I don't have any more timeouts. Call a timeout, Bobby Lee. - This kid can't kick that far. - Call that timeout. Call a timeout anyway and let's ice him. David, come here. You're telling yourself you're gonna miss. It's too far. Listen to me. Do you think God could help you make this kick? - Do you believe it, David? - Yeah, if he wants to. So do I. Give him your best and leave the rest up to him. Will you do that for me? Make this field goal or not, we're gonna praise him. But don't you walk off this field having done any less than your best. - Can I help you? - Don't touch me. I'm standing for my son. God, help me make this kick. Kick it now. Kick it now. Hit. The kick is up. It's on its way. It's long enough. It's high enough. Does it have the distance? It does. It's good. It's good. It's good. The Eagles have won the championship. Thank you, God. I can't believe what I've just seen. I cannot believe what I've just seen. A miracle has occurred here tonight. The Shiloh Eagles have defeated the Richland Giants 24 to 23 to take the state title for the first time in their history. It's incredible. It's absolutely unbelievable. You are a state champion. You are a state champion. All right. You guys, who's the state champions? Okay. Okay. I got something to say. David Childers. Don't you ever let anyone tell you that you're under par second-rate or inferior. I just watched God do a miracle through you. I saw a field of Giants, 85 of them to be exact, fall in defeat. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. Zach, I just watched you and the offense do what they said could not be done. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. Brock, how about it? You built that stone wall, didn't you? And it stood. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. - Scott, what's impossible with God? - Nothing. Are you sure? Those Giants are big. They outnumber us three to one. Are you sure there's nothing impossible with God? I'm sure, coach. - Nathan, what's impossible with God? - Nothing, coach. - Jonathan? - Nothing. - Are you positive? - Positive, coach. So am I. So am I. God can do whatever he wants to what happened, and, hey, I know all about your extensive trial experience with Trace. And, you know, pretty sure, you know, since now you're technically unemployed that the partners at our firm could make you a handsome offer to come on board with us because, honestly, we could use a guy like you. - As a partner? - Absolutely. I mean, board has to approve, of course but I'm sure it'll sail through. Because, honestly, Elston, you're, uh... reputation is very solid in Chicago. Okay, um... - Give me your card and... - Yeah. ...we'll go over some details on Monday. - Sure. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Monday. Monday, Monday morning. As in 7:55 early Monday morning, bright and early, you know, and make sure your junior attorney - sends over the documents ASAP. - Jarvis. - Jarvis. - ASAP. Come on, Andrew, let's go before we miss the movie. Okay. - 'Cause we gonna get together. - Okay, all right. - Pleasure. - Pleasure, man. Hey, Monday. You better go ahead, girl. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get my SpongeBob pillow 'cause, uh... I got me a flight to Dallas to catch. - Dallas? - Yeah. Courtside, bro. Wait, now look it, man. Take care of her, man. Yeah, man, you know, the Bible says, "When a man findeth his wife "he keepeth it, 'cause it's a good thing. " You know, and, uh, I'll be damned if I let this good thing get away from me again. Amen, brother. So we gonna go. All right. I'll call you when we land. - Love you. - I love you too. I know where you live, Jarvis. - Hey, I know, I know. - Get it right. I don't want any trouble. I'm not here for any trouble. Just wanted to talk. Come in. You're welcome to have a seat. No, I'm... too keyed up to sit down. I'd rather stand. Look, um I've had a lot of time to think. Calmed down. Now I think I'm thinking straight. Well, I'm glad one of us can think straight. You know, the truth is, uh... I had suspicions about her all along. Hmm. But I was just blinded by her beauty. I was trying to convince myself not to think about it. But I knew eventually it would all blow up in my face. I don't know what to say. There ain't nothing to say. You know, uh oh, she's beautiful. We didn't have a lot in common. You know, she likes that... just that booty-shaking rap music. That stuff they play on the young people channel. You know, I am... I'm more of a... a Luther Vandross man myself. I understand. We didn't have anything to talk about. It was all a facade. I mean, she made me feel young again. I put her up on a pedestal. But I knew... I knew it wasn't real. I didn't spend any time with her. So, um... what are you gonna do? Yeah, that's the question. You know, I want you to know something. You weren't the first. She's had about three affairs. I just didn't want to know. Well, I wish I knew you didn't wanna know. That's well said, young man. You know what you did was wrong. And I want you to know that it hurt. But I respect you as a man for taking responsibility for the mistakes that you've made. God knows I've made my own mistakes. I can't give you your job back but I want you to know that you were instrumental in helping me build my firm. So I want you to have this. What is it? Open it. It's a check. Sir, this is, uh... this is very generous, sir, but I can't take this. No, I want you to take it. Remember... Do I owe you something? Remember that? Yup. Well, I want you to know you did a great job in helping me build my firm. So I'm not giving you that. You earned it. I'll let myself out. Sir... Thank you. I know that I can't do anything to make... the past right again but I'll do everything to make it right in the future. Yeah... maybe. Maybe after this all passes, who knows? Maybe one day we'll be friends again. Maybe. But right now, I've gotta go and put my life back together. Thank you. The Rammer Jammer will turn into some horrible chain restaurant. Unless we were to pool the money. You mean together? Lord have mercy. Some things that you left at my place. This doesn't mean that I forgive you. See you around. Are you okay? The MRI was totally clear. LEMON: I saw you looking at Lavon and Ruby. I've been keeping you from him. Go fight for your man. Before you make any decisions, I'm throwing my hat in the ring, too. Yours is the only hat in the ring, AnnaBeth. Ruby left. I told her I have feelings for someone else. GEORGE: Part of me couldn't stand Jonah being with you. Because? Because he doesn't appreciate you, Zoe. He's not going to see how special you are. DASH: Mayor Hayes. LAVON: Yeah? Now, this is the second Sunday that the people of this town had to line up like Soviets for post-church pastries. We need our eggs, we need our bacon. We need our grits. Now, now, Lemon and Wade are filling out the final paperwork right now. The Rammer Jammer will be open in a couple days. Wade Kinsella and Lemon Breeland owning a business together? Better get used to living on muffins. Wade and Lemon are BlueBellians, and we will support them. But, you know, maybe we should all practice cooking our own breakfast, just in case. Man, we are going to be huge. I cannot believe that this is actually happening. And I agree: huge. And who cares that everybody thinks we're going to crash and burn, right? They do? Uh, yeah. Oh, I guess people are more forthcoming with you. But, for now, the important thing is we give our customers and staff the confidence that nothing is going to change for the worse. Exactly. (sighs) All right. Well... here we are. Uh, that's the wrong key. I assure you, it's not. Yeah, that one's brass; the right one's silver. No worries- - I got mine. Just give me a chance to fiddle with it. Well, why would I, when I happen to know that this is the key that opens the door? Because you take the moment from me. That's pretty cute. You know, if you just let me... No, just let me just get... (gasps) ZOE: This is ridiculous. What do you mean, you're not selling the Sunday New York Times anymore? That is the one thing I actually enjoy buying at this store. (George clears throat) George, Frank is not selling the paper anymore. Our paper. Frank, we need the New York Times, all right? I-I wait all week to read that thing. The-the magazine and the Week in Review. Sunday nights, I need to unwind with my crossword puzzle. Crossword puzzle. Thank you. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. As much as I am devastated, inwardly, by the loss of your puzzle, I can't do it. You two are the only people in this town that even purchase that liberal gossip rag, but the distributor makes me order eight issues. I end up throwing out six papers every week. Okay, Frank, how about this? I will buy the other six papers every week. And I'll-I'll just give them away to the schools or something. All right, you got a deal. You are my hero. (laughing) Enough of that. Just a couple of papers. Thank you. Bye. Yeah. So, we should make sure to get to the Rammer Jammer day after tomorrow so that we can show our support to Lemon and Wade. Yes. Right. You okay? Yes. (clears throat) You sure? Yes. Okay. 'Cause you would tell me if something was... What is going on with you and Zoe Hart? What are you talking about? I bit my tongue when you did everything in your power to stop Zoe from having sex with Jonah Breeland during spring break, but I just saw you promise to buy six extra newspapers just so Dr. Hart could pretend she's in New York City. Where she actually could be with a couple of clicks on the Internet. I'll send her some links. Tansy, I would have bought all eight papers to continue getting them delivered for myself. This had nothing to do with Zoe Hart. And, yes, I did not want her to have sex with Jonah Breeland because she is my friend and he is a giant ass with a stethoscope. But that's all. Baby, you're-you're my girl. Okay? I only have eyes for you. Good, 'cause I'm kind of getting used to you. I'm kind of getting used to you, too. Well, now, here they are. My two favorite lovebirds. Guess what. I have the perfect parts for you two in my big Shakespeare night. Shakespeare night? It's a review of Shakespeare's most iconic scenes. A divine evening of laughter and tears to raise money for the new school gym. We would not miss it. Right. How could we miss a Shakespeare night? Yay. All righty, then. Hey, Big Z, I need some advice. Hit me. Well, AB signed us up to do a scene in Dash's Shakespeare thing. Uh-huh. How do I get out of it? You want my advice? Yeah. Suck it up and do it. For the school gym, for AnnaBeth. I've been giving you relationship advice forever. Now that I'm in need, "suck it up and do it" is the best you can offer? Well, boo, Zoe Hart, boo. Oh, you want better advice, ask Brick. It's shrink week, and suddenly, he is our town Freud. You know, when your father Harley started Mental Health Week, I, too, was skeptical, but stress can impair the immune system. And a week of free counseling has proved very beneficial for this town's physical health. Oh, and, Lavon, Hmm? it'd be great if you would stop in and show your support as mayor. Well... you're right. Great. I'll-I'll come by tomorrow. Why do you get to do all the counseling? I did a psych rotation at Bellevue. Well, that's because people don't want advice from a crazy person. What, me? Lavon, stick up for me. Well... Lavon... As a matter of fact, you should come see me tomorrow. I will reserve the 9:00 a.m. spot especially for you. It just so happens that I have had years of therapy with the best analysts in New York City. I am the picture of mental health. (laughing) You can stuff it. Both of you. (laughing) The staff meeting was supposed to start 15 minutes ago. Are people usually this late? Well, I am. Hmm. (door opens) Whoo. Hey. Hey. I apologize for my tardiness. I stopped to get a coffee at the Butter Stick. It was a madhouse. Well, where is everyone? Oh, well, to answer your question, in the restaurant industry, there's a lot of turnover and changes in management. And when the employees found out that you were the new management, they, um, turned over. (chuckling) Come... come on. All of them? Mm-hmm. Uh... Well, at least you're here. Have a seat. Yeah... I just came by to give you my notice. Tom's mother got us a bee colony as a wedding gift, and, well, honey's really popular right now, so it's a great business opportunity. So Tom's taking a job at the Dixie Stop so I can be a stay-at-home bee mom. It's so exciting. (clears throat) I regret to inform you. I'm sorry. (door closes) So, we open in two days and we have no employees. Well, on the bright side, we have 48 hours to find better, more enthusiastic ones. (knock on door) George? It's so late. What are you doing here? Brought you the Times. What? Yeah. The Times? Where did you get it? Drove to Birmingham. Really? That's, like, six hours. Why on earth would you do that? Zoe, don't you know? I would do anything for you. You are everything to me. You always have been. (gasps) Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Dr. Breeland, this is Dr. Hart. I'm going to need that 9:00 a.m. slot after all. (sighs) Well, good morning, Dr. Hart. How are we? (clears throat) Look, obviously, I am not about to let you butt into my personal life. And yet, here you are. Yes. But I will be speaking in hypotheticals. Okay. So, what brings you here this morning? If I had this incredible dream about a certain gentleman that I used to have feelings for but really, really didn't think that I still did, even though there was this hug and he smelled so... that doesn't definitely, hypothetically mean that those feelings have reemerged, right? No, it doesn't. Especially if you're talking about George Tucker. No, I'm not. Why? What if I was? No, I know, it's bad. Crazy. And so embarrassingly repetitive. Dr. Hart, you have just come through a-a very painful breakup. A very painful breakup. And it's normal for your subconscious to pursue the road not taken. And I would suggest that's why George Tucker is appearing in your dreams. Because he is unavailable, and thus, unable to hurt you. See, he is the man in your dreams, not the man of your dreams. Not bad, Dr. Breeland. So, George has moved on. You know, he's happy. So what if he's amazing and wonderful and I probably made a mistake not picking him way back when. I'm a rational person. I'm a doctor. I can control my own emotions. I won't let myself like him. I can just put these feelings out. Just squash them. Way, way down. Push them. Deep, deep, deep into my sub, sub, (voice getting deeper): sub, subconscious. Well, how about, until you have some perspective on your feelings, you just lay off? Avoid intimate situations where you might... Hug? Right, or do or say something crazy. Great idea. Because, when it comes to George, not smart-- kind of my M.O. So I am going to stay in the office all day. All week-- all month if I have to, just to avoid any chance of running into him. Is there any chance you could use some of that office time to-to deal with our unpaid billing? If I'm being honest, probably not. Oh, uh, Mayor Hayes, you're early. That's great, because you can be Dr. Breeland's first patient of the day. Very first. You okay? You're acting weird. You're acting weird. Because I'm great. You two have fun. LEMON: So, Ms. Curran, you're applying to be the cook? Mm-hmm. Do you have any experience? Not if you mean professionally. But I watch every food show on TV. I made all of Paula Deen's recipes for my grandfather. I put them in the blender since he has no teeth. But his taste buds are still going strong. Well, I see. But if I'm gonna work here, I have some demands. I can only accept this job if this one can avoid hitting on me. Too skinny. That'll be tough. And you have to install a TV in the kitchen, preferably with Oprah Winfrey Network. And I take every religious holiday off in every religion. You have to let me-- it's the law. Well, thank you for your time. BRICK: Are you sure? There's nothing you want to talk about? Brick, I told you. I'm only here to show my support. I just want to read my sports section and pass the time. Oh, hey, uh, thanks a lot for getting me out of Shakespeare rehearsal today. Interesting. Now, why would you want to avoid rehearsal? No reason. You know... Shakespeare-- kind of a hack. (chuckles) Lavon, talk to me. I'm sorry. Our time is up. Hey, how'd it go? You shrunk? Oh, I'm fine. Buy you some coffee? Oh, I can't. I got to stay here. Lots of paperwork. GEORGE: Tansy, baby, you got to see a doctor. I'll see Dr. Breeland. GEORGE: Dr. Breeland's only doing therapy this week, okay? You're gonna have to see Dr. Hart. Actually, coffee sounds great. (coughing) Yes, it's true. Moi was the silver medalist in the Southern Alabama Roadkill Cooking Contest. I pride myself on making the inedible in-inedible. That is impressive. I'm in. Veto, veto. I have veto power. (French accent): 12 years at Chez Lucille in Mobile, specialize in-- how do you say? -- "crowd-pleasers" like boeuf bourguignon, coq au vin, escargot. I'm sorry, uh... (French accent): How do you say, uh, veto? (chuckles) Wow, all right. Yum. Veto. 51 years of waitressing experience? My goodness. Veto. (gasps) I spent the last two summers working in my Aunty Rae's diner. I don't have a résumé, but I do have a swimsuit shot. Would you like to see it? Obviously, yeah. Mm-hmm. Veto, veto, veto. I could be a great waitress. Better than you were. Mags, you have to be 19 years old to serve alcohol. Well, you also said I have to be 21 to get into bars, so you don't know everything. (gasps) Who's next? She was the last person. Sh... So, we open tomorrow and we have hired no one? It's your fault! We had several reputable contestants! Of all the crazies who have walked through that door today, Lemon Breeland, you are the craziest. (shrieks) What's going on with you? We... we've been here for an hour. Don't you have to go back to work? Don't you have to go to Shakespeare rehearsal? DASH: Come on, Crickett. You are the understudy for Juliet. It is only one line. Why can't you learn it? 'Cause people don't talk like that. (sighs) "Wh-What's here? A cup, "closed in my true love's hand? Poison, I see..." Something, something. "Hath been his timeless end. O churl! Drunk all, and left no friendly drop." Why, Dr. Zoe Hart, you know the line. My mother made me go to theater camp one summer. I was being punished. Oh, my Lord. I have found my Juliet. Who? Me? She'd love to. As a wise woman once told me, suck it up and do it. O churl. Hey. I'm sorry about earlier. Yeah, me, too. Listen, Dash's Shakespeare show is tomorrow, and if we can't host the after-party, then we're just... sunk for sure. So... MAN: Bonjour. (quietly): What? Have you lost your mind? Someone needs to cook. And Chef Tiberghien has years of experience. He trained at Le Cordon Bleu. Listen, I am sorry that I went behind your back, but it is clear that one of us just needs to step up and lead. I agree. Which is why I hired Fanny to be our waitress. FRANK (monotonously): Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil men do lives after them... Frank, Frank, that's fine, but could you do it with a little bit more enthusiasm? Uh, I don't do enthusiasm. W-Well, pretend that you're killing a small animal. It was one mouse! Mice carry Lyme disease. Uh, take-take five, Frank. All right, next up, Romeo and Juliet. (sighs) (gasps) You're Romeo? You're Juliet? Huh? Why? I-I was gonna do the scene with Tansy, but she got laryngitis. DASH: Well, I hope you're not sick, George Tucker, because you two have a big old smooch coming your way. Um... Oh, no. It's the doctor's office. It's a medical emergency. I got to run. But you... In a twist of bad luck, I somehow am playing Juliet to George Tucker's Romeo. Zoe Hart, you cannot kiss George Tucker. I know! I am lonely and hurting. If I kiss him, I'm gonna go right back down that rabbit hole again. So how do I get out of it? Lie. Right. You are good at this. WOMAN: Ooh, the Rammer Jammer is open again. I am just so happy. Hear, hear. (chuckling): Ooh. Eggs! Thank you. Bacon. Grits! Grits! Enjoy. (Lemon whoops, chuckles) You must be so cold exposing all that flesh. You know, they say 70% of the body's heat escapes through the... breast. Hi, guys. Glad you could make it. We wouldn't miss the grand reopening. This is very exciting. It... looks amazing. It looks just like the... the Rammer Jammer. Congratulations. Yeah. Congratulations. Of course we're here. Thanks. I'm glad you are. Hey, guys. How is everything? The eggs are fluffy. And the bacon's sublime. (quietly): But these grits... Revolting. Uh, look, I'll take care of this, all right? Breakfast is on the house. Hey there, Romeo. Hey. How's Tansy? Uh, she's doing much better. Poor thing still doesn't have a voice, though. Oh, yeah, you know, that can take a couple of days. But listen, I-I just... I wanted to talk to you. I actually had something I wanted to talk to you about as well. Oh. Um, no offense, but... Tansy is a little bit sensitive when it comes to you, and I don't want to make her jealous, so I don't think that doing this scene together is a good idea. Oh. You are right. 'Cause I really wouldn't want to upset Tansy. Oh. Well, great. Well, thank you for being so understanding. And now we just have to... think of a plan to present to Dash. LAVON: Okay, so, about this Shakespeare show... Oh, I wanted to thank you again for doing it with me. Jake's idea of theater was watching the cars go through the big spinny brushes at the car wash. Honestly, it's like a dream come true. Oh. It-it is some kind of dream. (chuckles) Those hash browns look amazing. But what are those? Those are supposed to be grits? I'm disgusted. And I eat roadkill on the reg. (quietly): Lemon, people are leaving, all right? Ratatouille back there can't cook grits. You know how. You got to show him. What? Hey, uh, everybody, hang tight a second, all right? Lemon is gonna show our brand-new chef how to cook grits. All right? (cheers and applause) I have mastered the classics of French cuisine from "A" to zed, but I have been vanquished by grits? Now you teach me? The shame. LAVON: I made a mistake promising AnnaBeth I'd do the Shakespeare night. I mean, I'm a football player-slash-mayor. I'm not a football player- slash-mayor-slash-actor. I can't humiliate myself in front of this town, in front of her. Lavon, I've seen you make eloquent speeches, debate with gusto. What makes you think you're gonna humiliate yourself? Do you recall a certain middle school production of The Wiz? (laughing): Oh. The one... the one with the stuttering Scarecrow? (laughing) Oh. Oh, my Lord. You were the stuttering Scarecrow? Every time I even think about being onstage, it-it all comes back to me. Lavon, that was a long time ago. You have matured. Th-There's no reason to avoid this. (knocking) Hey there! Oh, Shelby, honey, uh, can't you see I have a patient? Oh, sorry. Can't see who it is. Hey, Lavon. Well, now that I'm here... I wanted to see if you might want to get... lunch later. I've barely seen you all week. I-I know. I-I'm sorry, but the-the mayor needs me. (quietly): He is having a crisis of confidence. He's... falling apart. Hello. I'm right here. Of course. I'll be praying for you. (chuckles) Who is avoiding what here? Hey. Who is the doctor here? Now, I have oodles of community theater experience. I was the Modern Major-General, so I will clear the books, and I will spend the rest of the day... coaching you. I... don't know. Uh, don't you have patients? Nothing is more important than helping the town's mayor. (loudly): First... we improv. DASH: No, no, no. But I can tutor Crickett myself. She is terrible. Besides, the scandal of George Tucker and Zoe Hart performing Romeo and Juliet will be a huge box office draw. Okay, well, Dash, listen, we know that you want to fill seats. So I had an idea-- how about Tom and Wanda as Romeo and Juliet, huh? The newlyweds. I mean, they're fan favorites. There won't be a dry eye in the house. Now, do you all take me for an amateur amateur theater director? Tom and Wanda was obviously my first choice, but they claimed to be consumed by their new business endeavors. You leave it to us! Yeah! Go! Yeah. Two angels on horseback, BLT-- burn one-- and a large cow feed. Okay, enough with the diner lingo. You know that I don't understand you. (frustrated sigh) Hey, okay, from now on, everybody gets the special until we slow down. (forced chuckling) Well, she's joking. (clears throat) Uh, we are still cooking to order. Wade, please, I can't do this anymore, all right? I'm exhausted. I'm not a chef. Well, at least no one's storming out, Lemon, so that's a plus. So you have to. Besides, we don't have a chef, Lemon-- thanks to you. Yeah, well, at least my hire had other qualifications than "looks good in hot pants". Fanny happens to be a waitressing savant. You have got to be kidding me. You said I couldn't serve here unless I was 19. Well, that Fanny is a junior at Fillmore High. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, Fanny... I'm sorry I lied. A minor serving alcohol? Bill, we didn't know! Oh, I'm sorry, but I have no choice. It is my legal obligation to call this in. And they're gonna be taking your liquor license. (exhales) (buzzing) And that's Bertha, Claudia, Dolores, uh... Esther, Fae and, uh, Georgina. We named her after you, George Tucker. Aw. Thanks, guys. They are very cute. And I cannot believe that they all have names. (chuckles) Okay, so now about the Shakespeare show. Oh, we'd love to fill in. Great! But we can't. TOM: I have to work at the Dixie Stop tonight, and Wanda's got her hands full taking care of our babies. I have an idea. They need to be given their sugar water every hour on the hour. And look out for Miss Maisie Margaret-- she's wily! Oh, and don't forget to tape your socks to your suit. The bees will get in anywhere. And I mean (whispers): an-y-where. George, you ready? I'll teach you how to work the cash register. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just give me one second. All right. Okay. Hey, Zoe. Hey, uh, thanks for doing this. It's really touching to see how driven you are to help me and Tansy. Oh, you, my friend, are welcome. (chuckles) Okay, well... have fun. Okay, bees... here's your lunch. Yum! Mmm, yummy yum yum! Okay... who's in my pants? (grunts) Okay, come on, get out! Get out! Out! Out! Get out! (yells) (screaming) (loud buzzing) Us working together was obviously a mistake. Genius revelation, Lemon. We are a bar. We cannot survive without alcohol. And another one. You are really on a roll. What are we gonna do? Nothing. What can we do? Now, now. Wally, what are you doing here? Are you a ghost? Is this some kind of Obi-Wan thing? No, I was just down there in the basement getting my popcorn maker when I overheard you two. We lost our staff. And our liquor license. Well, can't say that's not disappointing news. We ruined your legacy, Wally. I'm so sorry. (laughing) Welcome to being a business owner. It's hard. It'll suck the marrow from your bones. It's all you're gonna think about morning and night to the detriment of your family and your friends. But every once in a while, you're gonna look around, you're gonna realize this is your place... your place and sometimes that's gonna make it all worth it. (laughing) But whatever. (Wally chuckling) Alcohol and Beverage Control doesn't close for the next half hour. What are we waiting for? Let's go. Come on. BRICK: Come on, now, Lavon, we have improv'd, we have discussed various theories and motivations. Curtain's in an hour. It is time to try the scene, at least once. I think we should do more of those mime-y exercises first. I can get out of the box. No... (ringtone playing) I'm-I'm sorry. I should've shut this thing off. Shelby again? (ringtone stops) Brick... what's going on with you two? It-it's complicated, you know. There's just something I have to tell her, and, uh, I don't know how she's gonna take it. But... we are here to work on your issues, so... so let's hear the speech. No, no, Brick, I can't. Uh-uh. Yes, you can! Lavon! Come on, on your feet. What we are gonna do is, we are gonna visualize. Okay? You... are not that stuttering Scarecrow anymore. You are... Sir Ian McKellen. You are Denzel Washington. (chuckles) That's right. So, close your eyes now, and imagine with me-- the theater is filled. The lights are going down. You step on the stage. The audience is waiting, watching. They're breathless. The curtain... goes up... and... Hey! Oh, come on, now. Wanda? Mm-hmm? I am so, so sorry, but I couldn't feed your bees. What? I'm-I'm so sorry. Th-They'll be so hungry. Uh, you know what? You go, and I will do the scene with Tom. Don't worry, we will make you proud. Oh. You're gonna kiss my husband. Just know, if there's any tongue, I'll remove yours. Noted. Hmm. And... 32 cents is your change. Seriously, George, could you fall any further? Boy, I dodged a bullet with you, huh? Good to see you, too, Daisy. (low chuckle) (sighs) Oh. Hey, babe. What are you doing here? How-how's your throat? No? "Why are you here? What happened to R J?" Oh. As it turned out, Dash had asked Zoe to fill in for Juliet, and I obviously didn't think it was a good idea for me to kiss her. (sighs) "Why the 'H' not?" Uh... because I knew how uncomfortable it'd make you... babe. Um... (panting) So... when he comes out, I'll do the talking. What? No, I'll do the talking. Besides, it could be a woman, sexist. Good point. Those abs you must spend, what, 40 hours a week cultivating might actually prove useful. Didn't know you'd ever noticed them, Lemon. Well, how could I not, Wade? You parade those things around town like they're dancing bears. Actually... You... stop it! Get your hands off! I am not a piece of meat. (door opens, closes) (footsteps approaching) (gasps) Oh, my... (whispering inaudibly) What are we doing? This doesn't make any sense at all. (indistinct whispering) Well, well, well, who do we have here? (laughs) Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. SHELBY (quietly): Lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth... Brick. Hey there, honey pie. I just want to wish you good luck tonight. Flowers? Really? The noble Brutus hath told you Caesar... (whispering): You have been blowing me off all week. I've barely seen you since the hospital, and we live together. I know, and-and I'm sorry, but it's the therapy-- it's a big time commitment. You know, preparing, then counseling. But I promise you, just a few more days and then I am totally yours. Yeah, well, I have to get ready. An actor prepares. (Frank continues in distance) Wait a minute. You're Juliet now? (audience applauds) Nobody tells me anything. All right, go... go find Romeo and run your lines. (whispering): Tom, I'm doing the scene with you now. I'm sorry. What? No. Tansy. It's... it's okay. Tansy and her, uh... her crazy girl logic thinks that me not wanting to kiss you means I have feelings for you, so if I don't kiss you, then she's gonna be pissed. So... look, I-I just hope you brushed your teeth, Juliet, 'cause you and I are gonna be doing some major lip-locking. Well, well, well. The tables have turned. Ms. Curran, please, help us. We had no way of knowing our new employee was a minor. Didn't you ask to see her driver's license? Well, she presented the only two forms of identification my partner checks. The point is, we're... we're a new business. We make mistakes. Surely, there must be some way we can make you forget this ever happened, right? Don't smile at me like that, Skeletor. But I think we can make a deal. What are you offering? Uh... free drinks for life? Lemon, you can't bribe the Alcohol Control Board with free booze. Oh. Uh... free breakfast? Free lunch. Oh, yes. That's sweet. But I think you both know exactly what it's going to take. (laughs) Fine. You're hired. (giggling): Yes. (flute plays) All the world is a stage. And all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances. And one man in his time plays many parts. His act being seven ages. At first, the infant, mewling and puking in his nurse's arms. And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school. AnnaBeth. Oh. Hey, there. I got your message. I'm sorry about your migraines. No, I'm sorry for leaving you in the lurch. You okay? Well, I have to do my scene with Dale King from second grade, who I know is a stalker and may try to peel my skin off later, but otherwise I'm fine. (chuckles) Guess doing one of these things with the man I care about is just not in the cards. AnnaBeth, I lied. I don't get migraines. It's just, I tried acting once. I stunk. I don't want to go through that again. Well, you probably don't even remember... The middle school production of The Wiz. Who could forget? Uh... But, Lavon, this time will be different. This time, you're doing a show with it. No matter what, it will be something we did. Our first town event. And if we stink? Then we stink together. Patricia? Quinn? Ruth? Susie? Where are you? Wanda! Wanda, I got your message. Is everything all right? No, Tom, nothing is all right. Our bees... gone. Okay, don't worry, we will find them. We... we have to put on something more colorful. We have to look like flowers. (Wanda squeals) Go to. I'm no more on it. It hath made me mad! I say we will have no more marriage! Those that are married already, all but one shall live. The rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery. Go. MAN: Yes! (applause, cheers) (whistling) DASH: And as Romeo comes upon Juliet's seemingly dead body, we begin. (flute plays) Arms... take your last embrace. And, lips, O you: the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss. (music continues playing) Whoa! No need for kisses, because I'm totally fine. What? No, you're not. Close call, Romeo. Oh! It must be a vision. Thou who is obviously dead appeareth awake. Oh, foul ghost, leave me. Allow me to kiss my very dead Juliet. No! Not a ghost at all. I liveth! I super-duper liveth. No kiss necessary. But I feel death coming. Nope. There's no death. Because it wasn't really poison. It was just a sleeping potion, and now it has worn off. And... happy ending! I see how it must be thus. Thus. (music ends) But surely thou wouldst feel healthier... with a kiss. (Zoe gasps) Now... with a kiss, I die. (applause) (grunts) Damn it. Table four is good to go. So, uh... the new cook's only here on a temporary basis. So I'm sorry if there's any, uh... Well, now, you know, it really is quite good. It is? Mm-hmm. Well, all right. (chuckles) Yo, congrats. Excuse me? - Put her fucking down! Her name's Rose! - Put her fucking down! - She's fuckin' crazy. Look at her. She's off her fuckin' dial! - I'm not putting her down. - Yes, you fuckin' are. - Just shoot him! - I'm not putting her down! Just shoot him! Just shoot him! - Fuck, man. - I'm not putting her down. I've got a bullet for your head if you don't put her down. - Give me the gun, Freddy. - Vicky, what are you doing? You're embarrassing me in front of everybody. - Just shoot him! - Don't do that. Shoot him! Just fuckin' shoot him! Vicky, please. - Just fucking shoot him! - Vic! Just fucking shoot him! Fuck, yeah, bitches! Go. No! No, no, no! No! No! - No! - Dad... - Fuck! - My skin's hot. Come on. Drink. Drink. ♪ .. Tiger land ♪ In any weather, we will see us with a grin... ♪ Hold tight, Rose. Hold tight. ♪ When we're behind, we don't mind ♪ We are gonna win We're from Tiger land ♪ The fighting fury, Tiger land ♪ And if you see us... ♪ Oi, oi! Eh! Fuckin'... Eh! Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate! Fuck's sake! Get back here! Hold on. Hold on, Rose. Mum! It's Jimmy, Mum! It's OK, Rose. Mum, it's Jimmy! Mum! I've got a little girl! She needs help! Mum, she's burning up! Please! Mum, come on! Don't kick the fuckin' door! OK, Rose. OK. Here. Thanks. You little prick. There's no way you were coming back. And now here you are, just like that. - I was. - Oh, yeah. I was, alright? I wondered what I'd say to you if you did somehow magically appear. It's funny, you know, I... I don't feel sad, happy. Just numb inside. I was gonna swing by, Mum. What do you want me to say, huh? Do you think I planned for this? Huh? - Can I bum a demon? - Knock yourself out. You seen your sister, by any chance? No. Well, I went round there yesterday. Had some chocolates for the girls. I knocked, waited, no answer. Called out, like an idiot. No-one came to the door. Not even the girls. Oh, so selfish. I don't have rights to see my own grandkids. It's that husband of hers. He's driven a wedge. - Didn't you go inside? - You even listening? No-one came to the door. I could tell that they were at home. Well, I did go around today. - Thought you said you didn't. - Well, I did. I wanted to use the car. So I went inside. There was a note on the coffee table saying they'd gone. Packed up and left. Gone? Gone where? Didn't say, alright? Just said they'd gone. Explains why no-one went to the fuckin' front door. I mean, at least they're all together, right? Oh...who'd want to live in a world where you can't even say goodbye to your grandkids? Sometimes, I swear, the end can't come soon enough. How much petrol you got in the Laser, Mum? - You are unbelievable. - How much? Who you trying to impress? Running around, trying to help this girl. I'm just trying to help her, Mum. If you can't understand that, then that's your problem. Well, maybe I can't understand. I'm just your stupid mother. What would I know? What would I know about you? -It's gone. Someone pinched it. - When? Does it matter? You stubborn old bat. Try the shed. There's a couple of jerry cans floating round in there. Fuck. Mick down the street, he never came back for 'em once his shed was done. He won't be comin' back for 'em. He went bush, like a lot of those nut jobs. Like that's gonna make a bloody difference. How about you, Mum? What are you gonna do? When it happens. You got anything planned? Got a few puzzles I'll try and get finished. Puzzles? Yeah. Good girl. Yeah. There you go. Good? Yeah? OK? We're gonna see Dad. You know what pisses me off the most, James? I already did this. I already said goodbye to you a number of times. More than once. And you had to turn up for real. Sorry, Mum. Don't be. It's a good thing what you're doing for her. You better go. Go on. Good luck with the puzzle, Mum. South-East Asia's gone. All of it's gone. My brother Steve's in Thailand. Steve-O. I'm glad we got to have that chat before the phones went down. Hope you were somewhere beautiful, bro. Over. Sorry, James. What for? That woman said she'd take me to Aunty Janice's. I shouldn't have listened to her. I keep getting you into trouble. No, no, no. Don't be silly. Alright? It's over now. Don't be upset, alright? You don't want your dad to see you upset, do you? - No. - No. You're a tough chick. - Say it. - I'm a tough chick. - I didn't hear you. - I'm a tough chick. - I don't believe you. - I'm a tough chick! What happened to your girlfriend? Things didn't work out. You broke up? Yeah. She was pretty but not...that pretty. - Yeah? - Yeah. She was weird. Thought you'd have had a much nicer girlfriend than that. Come on, James. Everyone's here! Dad! Dad, I'm here! Dad, it's me! Dad! I'm here! Come on, guys, it's me! Aunty Janice! It's me! I'm here! Dad! Where are you, Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad, it's me! Dad! Dad? Dad! Dad? - Hello? - Dad! Maybe they're over at the pond. Dad! Hello! Hello? Dad? - Aunty Janice! - Hello! Dad! James? - Rose! - James. - They're not here. - You OK? - They're not anywhere. - Stop. Did you find anyone? Um... - Rose, you can't go over there. - Let me get past! Rose, please. Please. Come on. Why not? Why not? You can't go down there 'cause they're dead. - Dad! Dad! - Hey! Hey! Rose! Rose! You can't! You don't know what he looks like! - Please, I need to see him. - He's there, Rose. Stop! Put me down! Put me down, please! - Put me down! - Hey, sit. - Sit down. - Please! I'm sorry. Rose. Rose! I need to see him. I need to make sure. OK. I'm sorry, Dad. I love you. - Rose? Rose. - No! - Now, come on. - No. I don't want to go. - Rose, he's dead. - I'm not leaving him. - Come on. - No! Come on, Rose. Come on. Let's go. - No, don't. - Come on. Let's go. Arggh! What? Dad wanted us to be together when it happened. This is where I need to be, James. With Dad. I'm sorry. I wish you could have met my dad. It was in your dad's pocket. I remember this day. It was her birthday. Dad got the waiters to sing 'Happy Birthday' to her. She looked really embarrassed, but I think she secretly liked it. You know, I'd have been a dad, Rose. Was that woman at the party pregnant? Not her. Someone else. Is she prettier than the other one? Yeah. Then how come you're not with her? 'Cause I messed things up. I've messed a lot of things up, Rose. What did you do? I left her all alone. There's still time. OK. Sorry I bit you. It's OK. See ya. See ya. James. I'm gonna watch you until I can't see you anymore. Can you watch me too? Until you can't see me? Sure. Ladies and gents, I'm sure you can all hear that rumble in the air. We've got just under an hour. I just just don't know what to say. I'm trying to think of something poetic. It's coming. It's coming. No! No! No, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! Maybe it's nothing more than hope. Or maybe we'll see each other again. Well, wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that be something? Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe. Zoe! I'm here. - Don't you touch me. - I'm here. - Don't you fucking touch me! - Zoe! - I'm sorry. Zoe! - You left me alone! I'm sorry. Zoe. I'm sorry. - You left me! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm here! I love you so much. I'm sorry. I'm here. I love you so much. I love you. - I love you. - I love you. It's beautiful. Ripped by Freaky. Sync. By A Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You're probably still be working at the park. STOP TALKING! Hey, Mordecai, have we ever think we should bring another friend? You mean, like a third person?

I'm not having a caveman at the park. We are insured for it. What? ! That's not fair. Yeah! We can't just get rid of him. A caveman can not fit into this modern world. See? But it was one of us now. Really? What's his name? Get rid of him! But he will die out there alone. Come on! Benson! Please! B-E-N-S-O-N? Fine.You have a week to get him civilized. Nice! Thanks, Benson.

Greg was pretty cool Do you think we should find another new friend? Two is good enough. And, er... how do you feel in yourself? Sorry? How do you feel in yourself? Does that mean the same as, "How do you feel"? Yes. Fine. Although, actually, I am feeling a bit... unhumped. Unhappy? That's the one. There's this girl who I like... like, a lot, but she's not speaking to me, so... Women, eh? Can't live with 'em, can't live without them. That's good. So true. Is that like, Buddha? Seriously? Cos if that's your own, you should work that up into a novel or something. So, now, you need to be aware that taking drugs as part of a medical trial does have risks, however small those may be. Dude, I've gobbled blank pills knocked out by rudeboys in gas masks. I go to un-franchised fried chicken outlets. I think I can handle a little bit of medical testing. Will it definitely come up? They're meeting for a big chat, JP. Ooh, big chat. No-one likes a big chat. Still, maybe it won't. That for the first month I was going out with Josie, I was also going out with Heather as well? Well, maybe it won't, so long as they don't talk about any of the following - men, relationships, emotions, life, what either of them have been doing, or how they've been feeling. Yeah, so it probably will. When's Heather getting back from Honkers? Tomorrow, and please don't call Hong Kong "Honkers". I know you're posh. You don't need to remind me. Dude, can you seriously stop fiddling with your bulbs? Regular checks, my friend. A check a day keeps testicular cancer at bay. Is that an official rhyme? The best time is after a shower when the skin of the scrotum is more relaxed. Oh, mate, I do not want to hear about how chillaxed your scrotum is. Maybe Heather's plane will crash, then I wouldn't have to tell Josie. I mean, I'm not saying I WANT that to happen, but it would be great for me if it did. Who's she flying with? Cathay Pacific. Cathay Pacific? No dice. Oh... Well, that's it, then. It's over. Yep, you're fucked. So, for the next three days, do you want to come medical trialling? We get PAID to take drugs. It's like a job, but... good. Er... yeah, JP. The man who checks his nuts once a day and won't drink unfiltered tap water? I'll sign up for dangerous medical testing. Hi. Just wondering if you'd read my play yet. No worries if not. Yep, here you go. So, what did you think? Obviously, since it's a 24-hour play season, I only had 24 hours to write it, so... No, I thought it was pretty tight. Yeah? It is tight, isn't it? I think it's tight. Maybe too tight. Ha. I mean, at 3am, I thought, "This is the best play ever written." And then I made a coffee and I looked at it again and I thought, "Actually, this might be the worst play ever written." And then I went to the loo and I looked at it again and I thought, "Actually, I think this might be the best play ever written." I think Nick might make a great Ainsley. He's got good hair and he's tall. Oh! What about Toby? Toby's got a great look. Yeah, if your idea of a good look is overweight and anxious. Exactly. Look, Candice, OK? This is an artistic enterprise that requires impartial decision-making. We're casting Nick, Ewan and Josh. You know Josh has got a girlfriend? OK, well, maybe not Josh, then. Mm. It's ideal, three days of loading up on free drugs, and, get this, THEY pay YOU 600 boys. Who's with me? 600 quid to get off your nut? They're not recreational. They're drugs for the medical market. Ones that make your nuts swell up and all your hairs fuse to make a horn. Who gives a fuck about having a massive, horny head when you've got 600 quid? Exactly. Buy a big hat. Two guys fell into a coma after one of these trials. You do know that? Well, if you can't stand the heat... What, go into a coma? Pretty much, yeah. Well, I think it sounds great. Really? Go with the flow, I say. Well, you just said it then, yeah, for the first time EVER. Maybe it'll be a bit like a spa. Pharmaceutical Butlin's. I could learn loads. Let's do it. Pharmacology is not the study of how to take drugs. That's like me studying geology by eating gravel! OK, we get it, Howard. It's not for pussies. Don't come, then. I'm not a pussy. I just think you're all out of your mind. Hey, Oregon, Candice! Come with us on a three-day medical trial. Yeah, no, we can't. Oh, no. Why? Well, we need to rehearse... Study. We need to study. She said rehearse. Yeah, she... she meant study. That's why I need to help her, because she doesn't even know the right word for it. So, hang on, if you're going to be away for three days, does that mean we have the place to ourselves? I will mostly be at the library, reading the book I have ordered. But I'll be eating and anti-eating here. Don't call it anti-eating, you freak. Just say shitting, like everyone else. Nice one. From scaredy-cat to drugs mule. Three days in a confined space. I realised, it's exactly what I need. You're going to tell her about Heather? This is ideal, because we'll be in a secure environment with medically trained staff, should she - not that she would - attack me. I'll be able to tell her everything, and she won't be able to storm off, and we can just talk and talk and talk. And she's got no choice but to just soak it up and listen to you. It's like torture. But in reverse. Nice. Hello, Audrey. That's a nice scarf. Morning, Howard. It's actually a snood. Fair play. Do you know if Principles Of Petrology In Ultramafic And Gabbroic Rock In The Brady Glacier, by GR Himmelberg, arrived by any chance? It certainly has. At last. Someone's already taken it out, though. What fresh hell is this? What do you think you're doing? I'm afraid I need this book. I'm doing a thesis on the Brady Glacier. I've been waiting seven weeks for it to arrive. So have I. So have a lot of people. Probably just us, I'd have thought. You can't have it, so jog on. No, I won't. Oh, really? And, er... what are you going to do about it, then? You pussy. I am not a pussy. So, why are you acting like a pussy? Right, that's it. Outside, now. YOU want to take this outside? Well, given there are no drinks permitted inside the library, and I'm about to open up a can of whup-ass, I think we may have to. This is going to be good. Stack of reading. Plenty of TV. A few potentially harmful compounds. Yeah, it's hard to know what to pack for a medical trial. Cos I thought there might be a party at the end. For the survivors? Hey. Sam. What are you doing here? Mind-fuck or what? I told you I'd be here three weeks ago, JP. I forgot. Anyway, I'm only really here cos my crew basically dragged me along. I'm kind of like their leader. Oh, you're fucking kidding me? The four of you couple up and play bridge for three days, while I get my gooseberry on? Hey, four-way bridge is a tops idea. You know how to play, right, Kinghead? No, because we're not retired teachers. Just standard contract. No Chicago or rubber or any freaky shit like that. I can't believe I'm stuck with boring couples. This is like going on holiday with Fleetwood Mac. I might head home. No, no, Vod, don't. We won't be coupley. We'll... we'll all share a room and muck about. It'll be a proper hoot. Well, better be a proper hoot. So, er... hi. Um... full briefings in the pack. But the overview is, this drug is still in its primary testing phase, so, there's no mobile or Internet access, no alcohol, cigarettes or other narcotics permitted on the premises. OK, I'm off. Cheers, then. Er... Right, um... any other questions? Hi. Yes, what does primary testing phase mean, please? I'll field this one, Doc. I'm a pharmacology student. Um... the primary testing phase means that it hasn't been tested on humans yet. Yeah, but someone will have tried it, surely? Like, one or two people? No, that's what this is for. Have YOU not tried it? No, I'm the senior developer. Of course, yeah. You only developed it. Why would YOU try it? That would be ridiculous. Do you want to leave, Kingsley? No, I love a trial, especially one with the possibility of a death penalty. Ha-ha! Come on, then. What you got? Oh, I've got... the lot. What's going on? Everything OK, Howard? That's right! Run home to your mummy! This is my library now! If I see you here again, I'm taking you down! You can run, but you can't hide! It's no biggie. It's made you realise how much you love her. When you're done, meet me by the pool. There isn't a pool. The... pool table. Or a pool table. The table? There is a table, yes. Meet me by the table. So, Doc, what drugs are we using? What are they? Antibios? Antipyros? Anti-inflammatories. An-flams! Sweet. I call them an-flams because I'm studying pharmacology. Yes, you said, several times. I'll be in my office, if you've any questions. I've got one now, actually. Could you maybe, just as a pro, check my balls? I'm sure it's nothing. I'm really sorry. OK. Because there's a whole world out there, Ainsley, outside this door. Room. Outside this room. Past this wall. Door. Past this door. Beyond this... road? Street. But road is fine. Rose! Ainsley's happy here! As was Alfonso until you turned him against me. Actually... Ogs, I really don't get the whole Alfonso thing. Cos, like, Hilda marries him, but also hates him. So, I'm like, "Why do that?" Because she's cruel. OK, moving on. Anyone home? I thought you were at the trial. Sacked it off. What's all this then? We Had To that. Look, I know you're pissed off because I cast Danny instead of fat Toby. But, please, don't fight me on every tiny thing. Where did you get that? Where did you get it, more like? Meaning what? Meaning you turned us lot into a play! What? That's crazy. You're crazy. Am I? Yes, you are. You're so self-obsessed that you've managed to interpret a piece of expressionistic agitprop as being about you. Which it is not. Not just me. It's also about Kingsley caring for his mum, only I'm his mum, and-and... and Kingsley's called "Ainsley". OK, I may have used elements of the "Kingsley caring for his mother" trope, but only because my own childhood was, unfortunately, very normal. Aw. There's little drama in your parents staying together and collecting wine, so I borrowed one or two things. You turned Josie into a sort of a troll thing called Gwen, who can't read and eats leeks and fucks everyone. It's well out of order. As a matter of fact, Gwen is a metaphor for the demise of feminism, hence why her surname is Feminism. What, so those two debt collector guys aren't JP and Howard? Mm? The toff and the guy he rides like a horse? Lord Hugo and MacTartan clearly represent the coalition government. You know there's a bit at the end where Delphine's name changes to "Oregon"? Um... I... No, there isn't. It's probably the bit where you... ooh, sorry, Delphine, tell me... ooh, sorry, Hilda, that I drain the life out of people and then suffocate me with the net curtains! Which you couldn't do, by the way, cos you can breathe through 'em. But thanks for killing me. Really appreciate that! Oh, God. Sorry, I-I-I just can't do this. You said you would! Get Doc to do it or something. He's done it twice. I can't ask him again. It'll look like I'm getting off on it. You're not getting off on it, are you? There's bad things in me. I'm full of lies and bile. I've deceived the woman I love. I deserve to have cancer. Yeah. I-I-I'm pretty sure cancer doesn't work like that. If it did, Roy Castle'd still be alive and Tiger Woods would be carrying around a tumour the size of a fucking golf bag. Well, let me check yours, then. Absolutely not. Why? So I can see if mine feel different! I just need a comparison, a control. All right! Fucking hell. Have a feel. Brisk, though. Like you're checking a peach. Nothing that could be described as a fondle. Aah! Are you OK? That was right in the zip. This fabric is very abrasive. Why are you punching a beanbag attached to the ceiling? I'm training. I'm going to be in a fight. So, how's it going? Well, I can now see why all the training bits in films are in a montage, because it takes ages. I think I'm doing punching wrong. I don't know if the thumbs are meant to be inside or outside the fist. It's amazing how complicated fighting is, yet so popular among stupid people. I'm going to get pummelled, aren't I? No. In fact, my friend Chris once showed me this illegal video about mind control by this devil man called Darren. Derren Brown. And he did this thing where you confuse your opponent by asking them weird questions which sort of melt their minds - and make them easy to attack. - Candice, we need to rehearse. Give me a minute. I don't know what you're meant to say to somebody before a fight, but be careful. I don't think that's what Don King whispered to Tyson seconds before he bit Holyfield's ear off, but... thanks. So, me and Max Parr went swimming in a waterfall in South Africa, and when we got back, he found a leech in his arse. So, he tried to get rid of it by sitting on a ferrule that we'd covered in salt. What's a ferrule? It's the pointy end of an umbrella. Didn't know there was a word for that. Well, there is. It's a ferrule. Anyway, he accidentally pressed the button, which opened the umbrella whilst it was in his arsehole! Did that really happen? You bet your sweet bippy it happened. My gap year 'dotes are the stuff of legend. Do you have any more? I have seven more. Are you drawing an outline of your head? I think it's swelling up, so I'm taking hourly measurements. Will you help me? I think JP's been fucking with me. Er... your head's fine, Kingsley. The pills they've given me are poisoning me. I'm nauseous and I'm itchy and I think my balls might be lumpy and I can't move my little toes. No-one can move their little toes. Kingsley, maybe you should just leave. No. Look, I... I need to talk to you. Well, that's very sweet and everything, but technically I'm not a real doctor. No, about something else. OK. I, um... I... OK, look, um... I didn't mean to, but... I... I... Oh, my God! I'm hyperventilating! No, you're not. You're just breathing a lot. I think I'm having a heart attack! Can testicular cancer give you a heart attack? ! OK. OK, OK, Kingsley, calm down. It's going to be OK. I'm going to fix this. So, we're on Max's dad's boat off the coast of Durban, and we were muchos masheoed. We'd taken, like, three bongs with us. Anyway, we were doing some scuba diving in pairs, and my partner was this proper fatty called Ed. You know, he's, like, a huge whale of a guy, such a bell, and it was hilarious, right, because he was scuba diving whilst we were getting our bong on, so the boat didn't have its anchor down and it drifted, like, two miles, and he couldn't find us, he got sunstroke and shat himself and nearly died! Guys, he shat himself. In his wet suit. He nearly died. My God, that's awful. No, it's not. It's... it's very funny. JP, you nearly killed a man. Well, the sea nearly killed a man and he was more of a boy, so... Wow. Yeah, that's loads better! Oh, come on. He didn't actually die. Yeah, but he could have, and he was your partner. You're focusing on the wrong bits here. I was muchos masheoed. He was really fat. It's very funny. I'm sorry. I don't care what you say. Deep down, I know that that is a cracking anecdote. There are several boys at Stowe that refer to that story as El Classico. That's how good it is. I suggest you think on. Maybe it's not me that's out of whack here. In his wet suit, not in the sea. In the wet suit. OK, Rose, when you say, "I don't give a fuck what you think," maybe push over the chair. Yes. Brills. Thanks, Ogs. Ogs. Ha-ha-ha-ha! And I just stare out of the window? Yes, because you're pining for South America. So I hear a chair falling over behind me and I don't turn round, and that makes sense, does it? Yes, it does, because you're pining very hard to be away from the awful people you share a house with. So, it's like, push over chair. I don't give a fuck what you think. I do exactly what I want. Mm. Don't say it like that, though. Can you just shut up, please? How should I be saying it? Ignore her. Well, when you say, "I don't give a fuck what you think," it should be like you genuinely don't give a fuck, not like you're saying it to piss people off. Hang on. If Hilda doesn't care, then she's not manipulative. She's passive. That's the opposite of everything Ogs has been saying. Exactly. Hilda is passive. She's making problems for people on purpose. Why else would she marry Alfonso? It seemed like a good idea at the time. What kind of defence is that? So, did she love Alfonso or not? Yeah! No. Ish. She's complicated. She's not complicated. She's actually very simple. She's totally thoughtless and resolutely self-centred. That's the character. Maybe Hilda's just unpredictable and up for stuff. Maybe that's why she's like that. What you need to be asking is why Delphine gives her such a hard time when it's none of her bloody business. Yeah, I completely agree. Why is Delphine so judgmental all the time? All she does is come in, judge people, then leave. Yeah, she does, doesn't she? Because... Delphine is a good person. Like fuck she is. She is! That's why she says, on page 12... .. "I'm a deeply good person." And on page 32 she says, "I wish I wasn't such a good person." And then Gwen says, on page 39, "You are so kind to Gwen. "You are like beautiful angel to Gwen. You are." See? Delphine is good. You're bad. Your character's ba... The character Hilda, who is in no way based on you, is bad. Have you told her yet? I tried to, but my head's throbbing and I keep vomiting air. Huh! Faking illness to get out of the high jump. Old school. I like it. I'm not faking it. I think the drugs they're giving us are causing my system to shut down. Look, I need to try this anecdote out on you. I've been told it's hilarious, but it went down like spunk soup. Found it. Owen, Kingsley. You're on the placebo. Oh, thank God. What are you on? I'm also on the placebo. What about me? No, JP, I can't. Oh, come on. Play fair. Fine. You are... on the drug. Shit. I wish I hadn't asked now. What am I on? No! No, I can't do any more. That's really naughty. Go on, just one more. Adam Colinson. One L. Kadan, Nina! You are... also on the drug. What was the other name? Guy Morgan. Morgan. Guy. You are... What the hell are you doing? ! There were some concerns, and I thought that... ..transparency is... important. But not as important as secrecy. This is a double-blind test. Testees cannot know what they're taking, or this is utterly useless. Well, that's political correctness gone mad. He thought his head was swelling up. I was just trying to help. You have ruined this trial. Well done! Vod? What? Oregon's a bit of a state. Probably not getting enough attention. Rose has dropped out of the play. Looks like she might have to cancel. Look, don't say anything, OK? I know. My play's shit. My cast don't want to do it. I know all this. That's not why I'm here. Please don't wind me up, Vod. I don't need that right now. I'm sorry, OK? It's my fault for interfering. I'm a prick. Course you're not. It's my fault for being arrogant, high-handed and inconsiderate. Yeah, OK. Well, you could quibble with at least one. Oh, sorry. Yeah, no, you're not arrogant. Look, don't cancel the play, yeah, Ogs? I have to. I haven't got anyone to play Hilda. Got a script knocking about? Why? Well, I'd better learn at least some of the lines, otherwise the director'll go fucking mental. You... want to be in the play? Not really. But I want to help out my mate, so... ..guess that's what I gotta do, innit? Mate, you should do it here. Buses are perfect for dropping bad news. They're jolly, they're full of people. They absorb and disguise arguments. It's like farting in Venice. Anything interesting? Just one from Heather. She just got on the plane. Not Aeroflot or Iran Air, by any chance? Dunno. I just... I can't wait to talk to her. Cos I feel so bad about how we left things last term. And I don't think she's completely over you, if I'm honest. No, I really think she definitely is. And there's one from Candice. She says she's in a play and that we could go along later. Hey, guys, can I drop you a 'dote? Great. Student theatre, the ultimate good time. OK, three years ago, I'm on my gappy in Durban, and my friend Max's dad owns, amongst other things, a mine and a massive boat. So, we... Oh, God. Sam... Sam. Sam, hey. Now that we've busted out of there, any plans for later? Case of me and you on the mega-lash? I think probably not, actually. Er... why? Well, because, firstly, we've signed a form promising not to drink for the next 72 hours and, secondly, because you left a fat boy to die in the sea. Is that the anecdote? It is, yeah. Yeah, but it sounds a lot better when you tell it properly. So, he's back. And he's planning to borrow some books. With his blood. I was actually thinking of borrowing some books with my library card. So, this is it. Fighting. I'm actually doing it. Don't worry. It won't take long. Yield! Do you yield? Do you yield? What colour is nine? What? What's the capital of Wednesday? How fast is a fathom? Uh! Do you yield? Are we saying yield, then? Is that how we're doing this? Ah! Yes! Are you all right? But I want to be a tooth doctor. You can't be a dentist if you can't read, Gwen. Those are the rules. Do you understand me? Now, take off that sack. I'm going to do that thing you like to you. Oh, my God. Is that me? Is that thing in the sack meant to be me? What, the one now being humped by JP? Yeah, I think it is. I'm going to fucking kill her. On your dad's boat in Durban. Yeah. Masharama! Mashley Cole! Mash, er... potato. Yeah. Um... do you remember Ed? Um... yeah, the fat guy. He did, in his wet suit. I know, it was so funny. Was that... my fault? But you mustn't tell Ainsley. I won't, Gwen. You can trust me. OK, well, one night in Portsmouth, when Ainsley was away, I made sex with Bill, the big sailor who was staying in my boarding house. Oh, Gwen. You're so easy. I know, Delphine. I wish Gwen was more like you. But it's not really cheating if you're drunk, though. How is it? It's not great. Yeah, it's confusing, cos you're making a thumbs-up. OK, so... That's better. Sorry, by the way. It's not your fault. I wasn't sure whether or not to have the thumb in or out, is the thing, you know. When punching. Me too. Why are there not more online forums dedicated to that? That's useful information. What about the police? Don't let them put Gwen in jail. Don't worry about PC Hughes, Gwen. When we explain it to him, he'll see that... we had to kill her. This is the writer, so... props! So... What did you think? Yeah, I suppose I thought, "What the fuck was all that about?" Look... I have to tell you something. It's not a big deal. And, if anything, it's made me really value what we have. Oh, my God. I got off with Baz. In Southampton. Before or after us? Once before. Um, then... after. Also, as a sort of follow-up mistake when I finished it with him. I'm so sorry, Kingsley. I... I feel terrible. And this is definitely not how I wanted you to find out from some retarded version of me. Yeah, well, these things happen. We've just gotta try to be understanding, I guess. Yeah? Yeah, I need to tell you something too. I was still going out with Heather until a few weeks ago. I accidentally two-timed you. What? I wanted to dump her, but her grandad was dying, and it was awful. Oh, fuck. I mean, I've been wanting to tell you for ages, because I feel so guilty all the time. I think that's why I thought I had cancer. On the upside, I won't be checking my testicles in public any more. Or so much. OK. Er, I guess... that means we're even? Yeah. Fuck. Heather? Yeah, I'm really sorry. Which one was Baz? Baz was just a... cock in a sock. It didn't mean anything. No, sure, fine. Not like Heather. But if it didn't mean anything, why did you do it? Shall we just drop it? Yeah, sure, OK. I fucked up. We both did. I had a little fling. You... betrayed me with my friend. Equal. Was Baz's grandad dying at all at the time? We didn't even have proper sex. We were pissed. I don't even think it went in. Great. Thanks for that. I was looking for an image to burn onto my brain cells for ever. You were the one sleeping with Heather for weeks. That's trying really hard to dump her! I couldn't not sleep with her. She would have suspected something. Oh! Oh! I-I'm so glad you didn't get caught out. I'll make you a medal, shall I? Look, I'm sorry. Look, let's.... let's try and focus on the positive, shall we? We're both bad people and we've done bad things, and we'll carry with us for ever the unbearable burden of shame. I was pissed! I'm young! And we can just say sorry, forgive each other and move on. Yes, yeah. You're... you're right. Um... I'm sorry. It's really great we cleared the air. Yeah, I feel a lot better now. Me too. In a way, this has worked out perfectly. Not... perfectly. But, um... pretty bloody great. Yeah, pretty great. Uh! Sam! Sam! He was paired with Ed Fallow. What? I checked with Max. He was paired with Ed Fallow, not me. My partner was fine. So, it's not my fault. OK. Good. Thanks for telling me. Er... can I come up now? No! Go home. What? This is nuts. I really like you. What's going wrong here? Oh, I'm sorry, JP. I thought you'd get the message. I'm just... OK. That's actually great. Um, because I've been thinking about it and I think that we should have an open relationship. I'm not in a relationship with you, JP. Open, closed. Ajar, anything. I'm not your girlfriend. Just go home. OK, mate? It's fine that you've got someone else up there with you. Because, as I say, we're in an open relationship. No, we're not. Well, I am. And you can't stop me from being in an open relationship with you. That's how open it is. You can do what you want up there. You have my blessing! I dunno why, but... I like it when people clap. At me. I mean, I know it's just hands hitting other hands. But... cor, when it's happening, it just... just felt brilliant. Yeah, I... I don't think you're the first person to notice that. God, they just really, really loved me. Well, they loved your interpretation of my words. You're a writing legend. No, I'm not a legend. This is my debut. At most, I'm... I'm one to watch. Howard won his fight. Go on, my son! Normally I abhor violence, but kudos to you, Howard. Thank you, fans. I broke a man's thumb. I hospitalised a member of the public. I am now officially... ..a menace to society. I'm so proud. There's something wrong with me. My heart's beating way too quickly. Kingsley, will you feel my nuts? No. Josie? No. Howard! [music] [music] [sirens] you gotta stop listening to the same voices playing over and over in your head. I can pretty much get the voices to stop now but it's the images that keep coming back. Certain ones like the day they raided us, the tear gas burning my eyes, the moment they cuffed me, watching one of my best friends die. Maybe it's a good thing that I can't get rid of 'em. So I can't forget where I came from. [music] Everyone has their number. My number is 18. This is my 18th foster home placement and that goes along with other numbers, 11 misdemeanors, 9 felonies, 4 convictions and 1 new haircut at the insistence of my case worker. [gravel crunching] [door closes] They say that when you get released from prison you have the glow, a new attitude. Who knows? I'm just hoping 18 will be my lucky number. We thank you for the food that you have before us and we thank for the loving hands that have prepared it. Lord, we have a new member of the family at the table tonight and we thank you for bringing Brendan into our lives and for the new life that you have given to him. We ask that you give him strength and wisdom in his new endeavors at school and may he always rely upon you. This we ask in Jesus' name, amen. Amen. So, you must be excited about school. Tomorrow morning we have a meeting with the principal. It's nothing special. that the transition's going smoothly. Okay. Northside's a good school. I've been a teacher there going on 25 years. Vanessa was a nurse there for how long, sweetheart? Long enough. Well, speaking of smooth transitions, your curfew will be 9:00 on school nights. You've had a curfew before? I've had a lot of practice being on time in the last few years. Yes, yes, I suppose you have. But it will be different without someone looking over you. I'm sure it'll all work out fine. Of course, it'll be fine. I just want to be clear on our expectations. There'll be plenty of time for these things later. [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] I smell alcohol on your breath, weed on your clothes, we have to report it. Same with fighting or erratic attendance. Now, what's going on with the community service? The Faith Club's working on a few projects this fall. He'll pick up the hours there. It's important that you don't fall short in that area either, Brendan. Yes, sir. (knock on door) Sorry I'm late. He's volunteered to show you around. So you just moved in with Mr. Stubbs, huh? Yeah. That's cool. Yeah, he's a pretty cool guy. He mentors our Bible study after school. Yeah, that's what he was telling me. Well, look, Northside is just like any other school. We got jocks, geeks, princesses and even a few cool kids such as myself. When you are working with absolute value inequalities, there's a lot you have to keep straight. You have to combine everything you know about inequalities with everything you know about absolute values. [music] [music] [Cheerleaders chanting] [music] [music] Did you tell him he could work on Lewis's car? -Hmm? -He's working on Lewis's car. Yeah, he said he took some shop classes and asked if he could. Well, sweetheart, I really don't think that was your decision to make. Since when do you care about cars? You know what I mean. Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Guess I should have said something to you. I can tell him. Well, you can't tell him now that you let him start. I thought we agreed we were gonna try to help the kid turn his life around. [engine tries to turn over] Well, I just didn't know that Lewis's car would be a part of that plan. [engine starts] So in the garden, we see him pitting man against God and in Job, we see him trying to turn God against man and in Matthew, we see him scheming to turn Jesus from God. Now, Jesus has just begun his ministry. He's only been baptized a few days prior. He hasn't even performed a single miracle and yet the enemy is already trying to bring him down. [music] So, Brendan, how are you finding it so far? -Uh, it's... -He doesn't say much. He's got that quiet thing going for him. Yeah, he keeps to himself. So does that mean you're not gonna join our volleyball team then? Volleyball team? Yeah, the Seekers has an intramural team and we play after school at the park. You should come out, Friday night. It's more like jungle ball than volleyball. And then afterwards you can check out my band. See, we play mostly alternative rock with some Christian skate punk thrown in and... They change their name weekly. Well, we're just still trying to find our identity, you know? Okay. [music] He helped him get insurance, too? Yeah, set up a payment schedule. Where's he getting his money? Mike arranged that he would cut grass at the school in the fields. I told Mike this was a bad idea. I mean, he barely knows this kid. How do you make a person trustworthy? Trust them. Mike trusted those roofers a couple of years back. They did half the job for the full price and then they disappeared on him. (door shuts) Hey, Russell. How you doin', man? What, you hit a number on the lotto? You're giving away cars? I could use a high definition TV. You only fall asleep in front of it. Not if it was HD. You know, if you're thinking of passing on there's this new rec center the department is sponsoring and they're looking for donations. I remember Lewis had that foosball table he used to play on night and day when he was a kid. We're not sure what we're doing with that yet. Yeah. [music] [engine running] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [footsteps] Brendan, right? I'm Detective Russell Dwyer. I work for the county. ever since I heard that Stubbs took you in. You've been in the system long enough to know that your record isn't gonna fold up neatly and disappear on you. I mean, conditional discharge where they seal your records, that's for misdemeanors. Drunk and disorderly, whacking mailboxes with a baseball bat. But that's not you. Now, I know what you're thinking, another cop hassling me for no good reason, but I have a reason. I am a stat man, Brendan. You into fantasy football or baseball? Oh, you should try it. It's a good distraction. Now, I love it because it's all stats and the guys that are really great at it, well, they learn how to dig through all the useless data and find what's really important. I checked the recidivism statistics on that boys club you spent the last three years in. Do you know what recidivism means? It's a 50 cent word that means messing up again. Do you know the recidivism rate of those rats that came out of that hole you were in? 90% arrested within two years of release. Nine out of ten and that's why I'm here, Brendan. Nothing personal, just the stats. Now the Stubbs, they're good folks. Never took a shortcut in their lives. And they had a son. He was a cop. He was killed in the line of duty, routine traffic stop. Guy shot him dead on the side of the highway. They don't need any more heartache. Yes, sir. I will be seeing you, Brendan. [footsteps] [music] I heard some kids talking about you at school today. I guess they found a story about a Brendan King arrested in a drug raid in the city about three years ago. If you're uncomfortable talking about it, I completely... No, it's cool. Anyway, I wouldn't worry if it gets out. Girls love a bad boy. They love the challenge to reform a rebellious boy. No, they've done studies on it, man. (chuckles) Did a car just go off the road up there? Wait, Brendan, stop the car! [music] Whoa. Hey! Hey, you gotta be careful, man. [music] Hey. (banging) Call for help! [coughing] [Dramatic music] [coughing] Hey, you okay? Sorry, it's gonna be okay, I'm gonna get you outta here. One, two, three. Ow! [coughing] [radio chatter] [background conversations] -She gonna be okay? -She's gonna be all right. -Could you give us a minute? -Sure, no problem. [radio chatter] We found these on the floor of the car. Wanna tell me about it? A Northside High student risked his life to pull a girl from her burning car yesterday. The 17-year-old girl who is yet to... It's a good thing you were coming by. That was a darn heroic thing you did. Anyone would have done it. I don't think so. Could have easily have gone another way. Well, the car looked like it was about to explode, so I hung back, but my friend... You being there was no accident. God has a plan. Hope you believe that. [music] Hey, is this seat taken or does Katie Couric want it so she can interview you? No, she just left, so it's all yours. We're rock stars, dude. Did you catch me on the news? I plugged you big time. You saved the homecoming queen, how crazy is that? You talked to her since then? No. Dude, you gotta get on that. You're like a super hero. -Now you've lost it. -I haven't lost it. What are you doing in this class? I've never been in this classroom before. Yeah, well...there are a lot of pretty girls in this class. Mr. Sheedy. Sorry. Just don't let this fame go to your head, all right? [music] (whispers) Brendan, Brendan King. You gotta stop listening to the same voices playing over and over in your head. I can pretty much get the voices to stop now but it's the images that keep coming back. Certain ones like the day they raided us, the tear gas burning my eyes, the moment they cuffed me, watching one of my best friends die. Maybe it's a good thing that I can't get rid of 'em. So I can't forget where I came from. Everyone has their number. My number is 18. This is my 18th foster home placement and that goes along with other numbers, 11 misdemeanors, 9 felonies, 4 convictions and 1 new haircut at the insistence of my case worker. They say that when you get released from prison you have the glow, a new attitude. Who knows? I'm just hoping 18 will be my lucky number. We thank you for the food that you have before us and we thank for the loving hands that have prepared it. Lord, we have a new member of the family at the table tonight and we thank you for bringing Brendan into our lives and for the new life that you have given to him. We ask that you give him strength and wisdom in his new endeavors at school and may he always rely upon you. This we ask in Jesus' name, amen. Amen. So, you must be excited about school. Tomorrow morning we have a meeting with the principal. It's nothing special. that the transition's going smoothly. Okay. Northside's a good school. I've been a teacher there going on 25 years. Vanessa was a nurse there for how long, sweetheart? Long enough. Well, speaking of smooth transitions, your curfew will be 9:00 on school nights. You've had a curfew before? I've had a lot of practice being on time in the last few years. Yes, yes, I suppose you have. But it will be different without someone looking over you. I'm sure it'll all work out fine. Of course, it'll be fine. I just want to be clear on our expectations. There'll be plenty of time for these things later. I smell alcohol on your breath, weed on your clothes, we have to report it. Same with fighting or erratic attendance. Now, what's going on with the community service? The Faith Club's working on a few projects this fall. He'll pick up the hours there. It's important that you don't fall short in that area either, Brendan. Yes, sir. Sorry I'm late. He's volunteered to show you around. So you just moved in with Mr. Stubbs, huh? Yeah. That's cool. Yeah, he's a pretty cool guy. He mentors our Bible study after school. Yeah, that's what he was telling me. Well, look, Northside is just like any other school. We got jocks, geeks, princesses and even a few cool kids such as myself. When you are working with absolute value inequalities, there's a lot you have to keep straight. You have to combine everything you know about inequalities with everything you know about absolute values. Did you tell him he could work on Lewis's car? - Hmm? - He's working on Lewis's car. Yeah, he said he took some shop classes and asked if he could. Well, sweetheart, I really don't think that was your decision to make. Since when do you care about cars? You know what I mean. Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Guess I should have said something to you. I can tell him. Well, you can't tell him now that you let him start. I thought we agreed we were gonna try to help the kid turn his life around. Well, I just didn't know that Lewis's car would be a part of that plan. So in the garden, we see him pitting man against God and in Job, we see him trying to turn God against man and in Matthew, we see him scheming to turn Jesus from God. Now, Jesus has just begun his ministry. He's only been baptized a few days prior. He hasn't even performed a single miracle and yet the enemy is already trying to bring him down. So, Brendan, how are you finding it so far? - Uh, it's... - He doesn't say much. He's got that quiet thing going for him. Yeah, he keeps to himself. So does that mean you're not gonna join our volleyball team then? Volleyball team? Yeah, the Seekers has an intramural team and we play after school at the park. You should come out, Friday night. It's more like jungle ball than volleyball. And then afterwards you can check out my band. See, we play mostly alternative rock with some Christian skate punk thrown in and... They change their name weekly. Well, we're just still trying to find our identity, you know? Okay. He helped him get insurance, too? Yeah, set up a payment schedule. Where's he getting his money? Mike arranged that he would cut grass at the school in the fields. I told Mike this was a bad idea. I mean, he barely knows this kid. How do you make a person trustworthy? Trust them. Mike trusted those roofers a couple of years back. They did half the job for the full price and then they disappeared on him. Hey, Russell. How you doin', man? What, you hit a number on the lotto? You're giving away cars? I could use a high definition TV. You only fall asleep in front of it. Not if it was HD. You know, if you're thinking of passing on there's this new rec center the department is sponsoring and they're looking for donations. I remember Lewis had that foosball table he used to play on night and day when he was a kid. We're not sure what we're doing with that yet. Yeah. Brendan, right? I'm Detective Russell Dwyer. I work for the county. ever since I heard that Stubbs took you in. You've been in the system long enough to know that your record isn't gonna fold up neatly and disappear on you. I mean, conditional discharge where they seal your records, that's for misdemeanors. Drunk and disorderly, whacking mailboxes with a baseball bat. But that's not you. Now, I know what you're thinking, another cop hassling me for no good reason, but I have a reason. I am a stat man, Brendan. You into fantasy football or baseball? Oh, you should try it. It's a good distraction. Now, I love it because it's all stats and the guys that are really great at it, well, they learn how to dig through all the useless data and find what's really important. I checked the recidivism statistics on that boys club you spent the last three years in. Do you know what recidivism means? It's a 50 cent word that means messing up again. Do you know the recidivism rate of those rats that came out of that hole you were in? 90% arrested within two years of release. Nine out of ten and that's why I'm here, Brendan. Nothing personal, just the stats. Now the Stubbs, they're good folks. Never took a shortcut in their lives. And they had a son. He was a cop. He was killed in the line of duty, routine traffic stop. Guy shot him dead on the side of the highway. They don't need any more heartache. Yes, sir. I will be seeing you, Brendan. I heard some kids talking about you at school today. I guess they found a story about a Brendan King arrested in a drug raid in the city about three years ago. If you're uncomfortable talking about it, I completely... No, it's cool. Anyway, I wouldn't worry if it gets out. Girls love a bad boy. They love the challenge to reform a rebellious boy. No, they've done studies on it, man. Did a car just go off the road up there? Wait, Brendan, stop the car! Whoa. Hey! Hey, you gotta be careful, man. Hey. Call for help! Hey, you okay? Sorry, it's gonna be okay, I'm gonna get you outta here. One, two, three. Ow! - She gonna be okay? - She's gonna be all right. - Could you give us a minute? - Sure, no problem. We found these on the floor of the car. Wanna tell me about it? A Northside High student risked his life to pull a girl from her burning car yesterday. The 17-year-old girl who is yet to... It's a good thing you were coming by. That was a darn heroic thing you did. Anyone would have done it. I don't think so. Could have easily have gone another way. Well, the car looked like it was about to explode, so I hung back, but my friend... You being there was no accident. God has a plan. Hope you believe that. Hey, is this seat taken or does Katie Couric want it so she can interview you? No, she just left, so it's all yours. We're rock stars, dude. Did you catch me on the news? I plugged you big time. You saved the homecoming queen, how crazy is that? You talked to her since then? No. Dude, you gotta get on that. You're like a super hero. - Now you've lost it. - I haven't lost it. What are you doing in this class? I've never been in this classroom before. Yeah, well... there are a lot of pretty girls in this class. Mr. Sheedy. Sorry. Just don't let this fame go to your head, all right? Brendan, Brendan King. It ain't a dream. - It's me, Eli. - Eli? Big surprise, huh? Who's with you? You know I got Rish. What up, Bren. Big Lex came, too. Right. When you guys get out? I got out last May, but Rish, he been stomping for about a year now. Anyone else? Tev's somewhere. How you been? Thought you was gonna contact me when you got out. I had to see you on the news. Of course, I couldn't recognize you, grew your fade out. Y'all see this? Baby boy's all brand new. Nah, he ain't brand new. He's just a pretty boy now. But even if they all forget, I seen you go pit bull. I ain't seeing it now. Yeah, I heard about you making a name for yourself while you was inside. Got all cleaned up, huh? Yeah, I can't roll with the old crew anymore, Eli. Old crew? We family, brother. So I'm gonna get to why we really here. Been to the woods where Tuck kept the stash. It's empty, completely dry, you feel me? What makes you think there'd be anything there? Because Tuck kept a stash... weed, money, 'caine, liquor, all that. And I know the police got work during the raid but there should be more, a lot more. Look, I don't know, Eli. Tuck didn't mention any other spots? Come on, man, you were in that more than me. Yeah, maybe. Tell you what, you think about it. Maybe something pops up. But I need you to give it serious thought. It's good to see you, brother. We'll be in touch. Later. Brendan, right? Hey, how are you? Broke my arm. Could have been worse. Yeah, I'll say. I don't really remember much of it. Thanks for helping me. No problem. Guess I'll see you around. I'm sure the club can find a few ways for you to fill up your service hours. Don't look at it as a punishment. Mistakes are a normal part of life. Use it as an opportunity, okay? Thanks, Mr. Stubbs. She's distanced herself from me and from everybody. She comes in, she goes right up to her room. She got that tattoo without talking to us about it. That is so not like her. She would never do that. then maybe you'd see that something's really wrong. I'm not blaming you, but you can't say that your moving away hasn't played some part in this. Look, call her later. Maybe she'll talk to you. What did he say? That I could do my hours with them. Did he give you any idea what you'd be working on? We didn't get into that. Hey, Bren. a skater kid cracked up near the park, dropped a couple of hits of acid. I haven't seen that out here in a long time. Kind of a coincidence, wouldn't you say? Wasn't me. No, not you. You're on a new path now, right? The hero. Do you remember that story I told you about the Stubbs' son? We never caught the guy who did that. Now, I know you didn't do it, but you're what I picture when I think of him. Have you talked to any of your old crew lately? What do you want from me? Yeah, there's something in your eyes that bothers me. Like you're waiting for someone to challenge you so that you can prove them wrong. When all that usually happens is is that you prove them right. I just have a lot on my mind... I'm sorry, it's over. Yeah, just walk away, right? Wanna ride? No, thanks. Are you sure? It's kind of dark out here. I kind of just wanna be left alone. Usually when I just wanna be alone, I could really use some company. So what's the deal with you and the Seekers? Are you there by choice or are you court ordered like me? Why would you think I was court ordered? Kids talk. No, I'm not court ordered. The police found some stuff I bought off this kid at school. I had an AP history exam and was having some trouble focusing. Look, I don't have a problem. and crush up smart drugs just to get my G.P.A. up. I never thought I had a problem, till I got locked up. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm not like... What? Not like me? I'm sorry, I didn't... It's okay. I'm not like me anymore, either. It's the next one on the right. Brendan, right? Yeah. I'm Zack. Natalie's boyfriend? How's it going? I've been meaning to thank you for helping her the way you did. It's no problem. I appreciate it. Me and Nat been going through some things. because we're in one of those on again, off again cycles but that's the deal, dude. I just pulled out of her car, that's it, dude. Later. You got my message. Are you okay? What's goin' on? I want you to tell me about Brendan. I wanna know the things I said I didn't wanna know. What happened, he do something? No, no. I just changed my mind. Maybe you should talk to Mike. I'd rather hear it from you. Please? Hey, got a minute? What's up? Those rumors going around, are a lot of them true? Yeah. I was talking to the club, and we haven't run any of this past Mr. Stubbs yet but it is our club and so a lot of the decisions do fall on us. You want me out? No, no, no, just the opposite. Well, sometimes I see the work we do and I feel like we're just going through the motions, you know, cleaning up garbage in the park, stuffing Red Cross envelopes. It's good and everything, but we're a faith club and I just don't feel like we're making the spiritual connection we should be. What do you want me to do? Well, we wanna really transforms lives and your experiences may show us how. We'd like you to help us find projects that can really make a difference. maybe something in your old neighborhood. Look, I'd like to help the club, I really would, but I just think it's better if I don't go back there. Oh. I'm just trying to move past all that. No, yeah, no, no worries. We didn't think about that part. Sorry. Brendan, we believe in you. Hey. What's goin' on? Somethin' on your mind? Well, the Seekers, they asked me if I'd take them into the city and do some service work down there. Well, sounds like a real sign of respect for you, everything you've been through. Well, part of me wants to do it. Another part just doesn't wanna go there. That's totally understandable. But let me just tell you this, everything you do, every decision you make, you need to do a cost benefit analysis. You get to that in economics class yet? Uh, no. How will something benefit you, what will it cost you, what do you have to risk. But see, what people forget sometimes is there's a cost for not doing something, too. We don't only pay for what we do in life, we also pay for what we don't do. Yeah, it's a scary deal, I know. You wanted to leave that part of your life behind. Pray on it. Right decision will show itself to you. I know it did for me just a little while back when I was trying to decide whether or not to bring this young guy into my house. Thanks, Mike. Next on the agenda is the auction. The posters are almost ready to go, we just need to select a charity. That looks good. I'll get working on the charity. How's the online bidding for nominees coming? Well, last week the website crashed, but other than that, it's running smoothly. We have a lot of bidders now. That seems to be okay. What else? Great. John? We just need to get the decorations signed off on. Who are we going to talk to about that? - Can you talk to her? - Yeah. All right, yeah, we need refreshments... Hey, Hannah, did Mr. Stubbs talk to you about my situation? Yeah, he said you'll be doing some community service with us. Yeah, I'd like to get my hours in as soon as I can, so if anything comes up. What are you doing right now? Just going to the mall. Brendan's taking Chris Sheedy and me downtown. He's got an idea for a project he wants us to see. He said that if he told us, we might not wanna go. But it could count towards your hours. Kind of short notice. Sure, whatever.

This is where I used to live. I told myself I would never come back to this hole. One of my friends died right here. Before I got locked up, I used to run wild. Bumped in and out of foster homes. Out of control, selling drugs. Kids in the system become your gang and your gang becomes your family. And that type of living almost got me killed. The first six months I was inside, I was so angry. I was in solitary more than I was out of it. One day a chaplain came by and handed me a Bible. I laughed. God never came to these places. But I read that book because it was the only book they'd let me have. And, I swear... I realized that I hadn't even been living at all, had been going about it all wrong. I wanna rehab this house. for neighborhood kids to come and hang out. A place where they can work out their problems with no struggles. Just a good home to turn to. How are you gonna do that? Buy the house, fix it up? - Who's gonna run it? - I don't know. It's like I have a vision and I have to just step into it. What's impossible for man is possible for God. That's right. I mean, look at my life, the way it was. It's a lot like this house. And look at me now. Nothing is impossible. If God could give me a second chance, he could turn this house into a castle. What are you gonna call it? Yeah, it needs a name. Check this out: House of Redemption. That sounds like one of your lame band names. King's Castle. Or how about just The Castle. Yeah, I like that. So explain to me again, how exactly are we gonna buy this place? I don't know. It's ambitious, I'll tell you that. Well, if it helps, I did a cost benefit analysis last night. Oh, so what, you're a funny guy now? I figured I could talk to some local businesses and see if they'd help out, kick in some paint and lumber and stuff. sometimes can be purchased for back taxes, maybe even less if the city wants to unload them. You just need to prove to them that you can take on that sort of responsibility. With your history, that might be a tough call. Yeah. Might need me to co-sign with you. You'd do that for me? I just did a quick cost benefit analysis. you can come stay in the garage with me. No joke. Well, thanks, Mike. figure out what you have to do to pull this together, I'll do whatever I can to help. God will take care of the rest. Power of faith, huh? Hello, Natalie. Hey. - Got a second? - Yeah. I couldn't sleep last night. That story you told in the house just kept running over and over in my head. Well, I'm glad you were there. I have an idea. but the bachelor/bachelorette auction is next month. The money we raise, we donate to local causes and we still haven't decided on a charity to support. I'd like to talk to student council into donating to The Castle. Do you think they'd go for that? I don't see why not. I am the president. What? I'm just surprised, I guess. Well, don't be. Thank you. There is one catch, though. You're gonna have to do me a favor. Name it. Put yourself up for auction. winners revealed at a party we're throwing at the pavilion. You're kidding, right? to put money down on a date with you. It's kind of not my thing. Yeah, but you're the face of the franchise. Can't raise money for The Castle if its leading player isn't in the game. Hey, you know, maybe we can auction Sheedy instead. Do I detect an element of fear in Mr. Fearless? Shorty is poppin'. What's her name? What are you doing here? Just checkin' in. Shouldn't be here. I bumped into Tevin the other day and he seems to remember you and Tuck packing a couple of shovels in a car a couple of days before we got busted. Don't know what he's talking about, man. See, that's gang property, Bren, and it's not doing anybody any good sitting wherever it's at. We need it working for us. We need it in the streets helping us build back up. If Tuck did it, I don't know where it is, okay? See, I wish that I could believe that. Probably should think about this some more. I don't need to think on it, E. You like these people, huh? This place you are now? You like the people you hanging out with now, huh? Seems like a nice place, nice people. And that girl... she real fine. What's that mean? Take it easy, baby. We just having a general conversation, that's all, B. County clerk's office. Hi, I'm looking for information on how to purchase a house. I checked the website that lists properties that have a tax lien. Do you have a parcel ID number? Yes, ma'am, 13004201. Please hold. Yes, ma'am. Brendan, Brendan King. Okay. Natalie, I know you've already locked down a band for the auction, but if you're looking for an opening act, you should check us out. We play mostly alternative rock... I thought we discussed this. Oh, I forgot you're the gatekeeper to the student council now? No, we just don't need an opening act for the auction. Fine, I was just throwing it out there... Shhh! No, I'm sorry. So what do I do? I just go down there and... okay. All right. Thank you. Thirty-five. Thirty-five dollars? They do realize the place isn't even worth 35 cents, right? Yeah, well, how it works is we can go down there and file a petition for it and that sort of makes it ours. But then we have 60 days to come up with the rest. Last year's auction raised $3,500. So, how much to file for a petition, Brendan? Ten dollars. We're gonna do this. Hey, sweetheart. - Hi. - Hi. I talked to Stan today. That job's coming open. Anne Marie's going on maternity leave. I told them I'd discuss it with you. I don't think it's time yet. Yeah, but when we talked about it a couple of days ago, you said it might be. I know. This could be a good thing, Vanessa, getting back to work. I worry. You're out here in the garden a lot, but sometimes it seems to me I mean, you grow all these beautiful flowers... Maybe it's time for you to bring them to some other places, you know, back to the school, back to work, back to church, back to your friends who care about you. I talked to Russell about Brendan. Okay. This was supposed to be about healing? Well, this does not feel like healing to me. It feels like more pain. Vanessa, you don't have to fear the boy. He left that world behind the day he was saved. - Saved? - Mm-hmm. Is that it, Mike? The dark clouds part, the sun shines down and the choir rejoices in song. I didn't... I... Sweetheart. Got a second? What's up? That's what I'm wondering. Lot of stories flying. I've got nothing against you personally. You did a cool thing helping Natalie but some of the stuff I heard you're into, she doesn't need to be around that. You're right, she doesn't. She won't. Good.

If you don't mind me asking, what happened to your family? Sorry. No, it's... my mom died, drugs. And my dad, I don't know who he is. Any brothers or sisters? How does anyone make it through that? My parents are divorced but I know who they are, I know where they are. Is that like a girlfriend tattoo? No, it's kind of like something to remind me of how I got here. A broken heart? It's a mended heart. Is that a cross in the middle? Yeah, I kind of messed that part up. I like that it's not perfect. There. What's the worst thing you've ever done? Well, I've made a lot of bad decisions, but at least I never killed anybody. It's just, um, I'm not proud of them. I have to go. Hey, wait. Natalie, hey, hang on. Hey, hang on. Whatever it is you're going through, you don't, you don't have to do it alone. Brendan... yeah, I do. You're not returning my texts. You thought I would? You said friends, right? I broke up with you. You should hate me right now. Well, I can't. We never really talked about things, about the accident and the other stuff. I don't know what else to say. You're not answering any texts, any calls and anyone sees you outside school, you're hanging out with the Seekers. Yeah, you used to go out and have fun and now something's changed. So what are you saying? You can't tell me you're having it with the Seekers. So it's official then, you've become one of them. Maybe I have. Really? How's Natalie doing these days? Why don't you ask her yourself, man? She doesn't talk to me much lately and when she does, it doesn't sound much like the Natalie that I know. What is it with you? You saved her life, now maybe you think you can save her soul? I mean, isn't that what you guys do in your club? Huh? Let me make this as straight as I can for you. Stay away from her! I don't want any trouble. Yeah, see, I've been on the field against teams loaded with city there, it's the year 2 1 45. You wouldn't believe the things surgery can do. You could wake up... and live in the future like a normal person. - In the future? - You have to choose. How could I wake up? How would you wake from your worst nightmare? No, César, don't listen to him! Your partners set this up! They want you to kill yourself! He's done that. Now it'll just be a formality. - I'm going to do it. - Very well. Do you have any wish before you die? Let them out there read my mind. Who are you? I don't know. Don't keep suffering. It's all in your head. It's all psychological. Come on, César. - What will happen to them? - Don't prolong this farewell. You think they're your friends, but they're just images. That man isn't really crying. - I forgot, I get vertigo. - Then don't look. Good-bye, César. Relax. Relax. Open your eyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes.

I don �t shout. - So tell me, did you screw her? - Screw who? Whoever was there when I rang last night. I was alone last night. Anyway, what is it to you? Nothing. You can do what you want with your life. Thanks very much. Let �s change the subject. - Did you screw her? - Give me a break. I was on my own. So, you did. Was it the one you talk so much about? - Who? - That Nuria. My God, I can �t believe it! César seeing the same woman twice! - She must be great in bed. - She isn �t bad. Bastard! When are you going to tell me the secret? - What secret? - The recipe for Coca-Cola. - Look, the kind you like. - Yeah. Change the-- What did you eat today? Nothing. That �s my problem. I �m starved! It �s funny when you ask them what they value most in a man. "I like him to be intelligent, to be honest, to be kind." It �s all shit! You �d have problems ifyou were like me. Not that again! You aren �t ugly. Anybody would like to have your face. You �re normal. - Normal. That doesn �t mean handsome. - You �re handsome. I �m acceptable, when you �re not beside me. You �re like anorexics. They insist they �re fat, and end up crazy. When some girl ties you down, the rest of us will get a chance. - Yeah, yeah. - Why not? Ifyou meet the right girl-- She doesn �t exist. Shit! - How did I miss that? - God punished you. You �re for it. - Who are you saying that to? - To God. Doyou believe in God? - Don �tstart allthatshit. - ljust askeda question. Ifyou don �t want to, don �t answer. I don �t believe in God. How do you explain what happened? - How do you mean? - Your face. - There is no explanation. - I believe there is. - You believe I �m mad. - I only believe what I see. You haven �t let me see your face yet. And I won �t. Do you really think you �re a monster, César? - Come on, let me see. - Stickyour hand up your ass! Take it easy, brat! I �m sick ofall your stories. - Leave me alone! - I �ll kick the shit out ofyou! Leave me alone! I can �t work with you in here. Leave us on our own. On my responsibility. You �rejust a spoiled brat who-- My parents are dead, asshole! You made up a story so as not to admit what you did. Is that true? What? That you �re a spoiled brat. My father had a restaurant chain. That �s not my fault. When did your parents die? Fifteen years ago, in an accident. - And now you �re rich. - So they say. Then why don �t you want a lawyer? They say they can get me the best. - But they want me stuck here forever. - Who are they? My partners. They �ve been sucking my blood since I was a kid. Now they �ve got everything. They �ve cut me out. It wasn �t them. It was me. I don �t care. Let �s see, César. Do you know why you �re here? - Because I wear a mask, I guess. - No. Because you killed someone. Or don �t you remember? - Tell me, don �t you remember? - Fuck! Stop it! We must get things clear ifyou want us to get on. I don �t want us to get on! Is your solution to sit in this hole and not talk? - Aren �t we talking now? - After two months. I �ve been trying for two months. - Read the reports. - I �ve read them. I want you to tell me, if possible, sitting on a chair. Or are you going to stay there? I like the floor. It �s the only thing that seems real. What does everything else seem? Everything else is a lie. All this seems a lie, including you. You don �t even wear a white coat. - Do you think I should? - Doctors wear them. I took it offso you �d forget I was a doctor. So that you �d like me more. It didn �t work. I hate the sight ofyou. Now that we �re friends-- - I �ve got no friends. - Tell me what happened. The sooneryou talk, the sooner I �ll go. Hey! Happy birthday and all the things people usually say. Thankyou, thankyou. - Where did you find her? - In the library. - She tried to steal my book. - It was mine. - Anyway, César, Sofía. - Hello. Happy birthday. - Thankyou. - Your present. - Thanks a lot. - We bought it between us. Then I have to thank both ofyou. Stop chatting her up and open it. - I �d rather open them tomorrow. - Whatever. - Like a drink? - Sure. I �ll leave this upstairs. Hello. - What are you doing here? - Happy birthday, darling. Thankyou. But I didn �t askyou to the party. That was nice ofyou. I brought you a present, too. Why not open it? No, thanks. I already know what �s inside. - And last night? - Listen, Nuria. I don �t like you just turning up, much less coming into my room. - Well! Do I have to apologize? - No. You have to go. Right. I know what it is. You don �t want to be seen twice with the same girl. It would ruin your reputation. - You got it in one. - And there �s someone else. - Right? - Who? The brunette you were talking to a minute ago? Well, she �s not bad. I don �t care. I don �t need to be seen with you. Hold me. Come on. A little kiss. Come on. Until when? Until next Friday? Can you manage a weekend without me? Excuse me. I must see to my guests. Yes, the brunette will take time. She looks that type. - That type? - Yes. The kind who can �t find your zipper. - Hello. - Hello. - What did you want? - To open this. Wait. I �ll serve you. Since when are you the waiter? Don �t you know I �m in catering? Are you all right? - Can �t you tell I �m elbowing in? - A bit. I �ve got a slight problem. - A girl �s chasing me. - You don �t say. - I need help to get rid of her. - And I �m that help. Shit! There she is! - Where? - Don �t look. Look over here. That �s it. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. - Here we are. - Here we are. Well, act as ifwe were talking about something real interesting. Nod your head, agree, say yes. You know. - What a nice conversation. - Yes. - And she �s coming this way. - Fuck! - What are you doing? - Don �t worry, I �ll guide you. - Straight on. - I don �t see her. Here it is. Go right in. - I �m not going in there. - Well, I am. So long. - He �s in here. - You-- Well, we �re safe. But we �ve got nothing to drink here. I think all you really want is to chat with me. Yes, that too. First, I want to save my skin. Can �t you say you aren �t interested? She wouldn �t care. She never gets tired. - She must be feeling bad. - Yeah. Ofcourse. So you �re studying drama, like Pelayo? - For now. - Scenography? - Acting. - Really? To be an actress? I am an actress. Is that a problem? Yes. Aren �t you ashamed? Ashamed? Why should I be ashamed? Actors aren �t honest. You �re able to show emotions you don �t have... or which, at most, you invent. Right now you could be thinking... "This guy is a real drag. How can I dump him?" - Really? - "And in catering. A pain in the ass." But you �re a good actress. It doesn �t show. - Hey, Pelayo! - I caught you. - Come in. - How �s it going? Great. I �m a bit out of it now. Drunk, you mean. Why are you in here? Sofía was protecting me from a female psychopath out there. - She seemed dangerous. - Yeah. - What about you? - I was drinking. Women don �t chase me. - We �re out ofdrink. - Here. - Shit. - I �ll get some more. For all of us. Well, I guess I �ll be going. - Why? - I �m drunk and don �t feel well. Don �t be stupid. It �sjust starting. - Foryou, it is. - Pelayo, you can �t go. You �re my guest of honor. You �re a son ofa bitch, César. - Why �d you say that? - The party �s full of girls. I go for a piss, you start talking to her, and-- What? Nothing. And I look like an asshole. Tell me what �s wrong. - Why do you have to chat up Sofía? - No one �s chatting up Sofía. Yeah, and I �m blind, right? You �re certainly drunk. I �m drunk, but I �ll tell you this. I like Sofía a hell ofa lot. She may even be the girl of my dreams. But ifshe fucks up our friendship, she can go to hell. I feel the same. Sure. Pelayo, where are you going? - Home. - Already? - Yeah, I �m wrecked. - I �ll come with you. Don �t bother. You stay. Are you going, too? I have to get up early. I can run you home later. Stay on. I �m leaving you in good hands. What �s wrong with him? He �s drunk. - Is he annoyed with us? - No. You sure? She doesn �t look too happy. Didn �t you have to get up early? I �m doing too much foryou tonight. - Maybe it means something. - Yeah. That you �ve got a nerve. It �sjust for a minute. Long enough for my friend Nuria to admit defeat. This is my place. - Don �t dare laugh at it. - Why would I laugh? It �s nothing special, but it �s cheap. - Do you like clowns? - They �re not clowns. They �re mime artists. Pancho! - I �ve got a cat. - I hate cats. They �re almost as false as actresses. Says the caterer. How do you pay for this? Do your parents help? Do you work? He �s real nosy, isn �t he, Pancho? I �m an arms dealer. Fancy that! I always wanted to know how arms dealers lived. Now you do. Howcan lexplain it toyou? You wouldn �t understand. Even ldon �t understand. She wasmaking coffee andlstartedsnoopingaround. Suddenly, lgot thisstupidfeeling a lot ofpeopleget. Well, I like it. - What didyou feel? - That llovedher. - God, I �m even embarrassedto say it. - I didn �t hearyou. I said I like your place. And I like yours. Let �s swap. You wouldn �t like it tomorrow morning. I said it because ofthe decor. Your place is more personal. - And warmer. - Warmer? - Yes. - You think my house is cold? - A bit. - And am I? - I don �t know. - You said my house seemed cold. Ifyou �re waiting for me to list your virtues, hard luck. You thinkyou �re real smart. - Maybe. - Well, you �re wrong. I don �t need you to list my virtues. No, I �m sure you know what they are. - But you �d like me to see them, too. - So you say. I �m not going to argue about it. -Just as well. You �d lose. - Oh, yeah? But I don �t want to argue either. I propose we do the opposite. - We don �t argue? - We show our defects. Great! I hope you �re being fair. This is absolutely you. Well, mine is finished. Fuck! That �s how you see me? - Did I go too far? - Sign it. Let �s see mine. It �s lovely! - It �s not a caricature. - You see. You draw beautifully. - I �ll sell it to you. - Miser. How much? As it �s you, I �ll sell it for... a kiss. That smile �s going to kill me! It would be wrong ifwe did anything tonight. - Why? - Pelayo. Remember? Your best friend. He doesn �t have to find out. Besides, he �d do the same. I see friendship really matters to you. It does. That �s why I wouldn �t tell him. Somepeople... saythat they wouldbe happy with a normallife span. But "normal"meansdifferent things, depending on-- What are you looking at? I �m watching TV. The Romans, forinstance, livedonly25years. Today... that figure has tripled, which means that-- - What the fuck is he on about? - I saw this before. It �s about cryonization. Cryo what? When they freeze you or something. Like Walt Disney. Wow, that �s cold! Hey, you! There won �t be a landslide. It isn �t dangerous. Theground is firm here and verysolid. - Are you leaving? - I �m going home. Here �s my number. But I �ll call tomorrow. What for? All right, I won �t call. - César? - What is it? Come here. I want to tell you a secret. Come here. Hello, darling. Did you follow me? Ofcourse I didn �t. But I had the feeling we �d meet. - How was the brunette? - Good. Why? From your face, I �d say you didn �t sleep with her. Let me guess. You didn �t sleep with her, but you don �t mind. You have all the time in the world for that. And I bet you �re seeing her tomorrow. - Brilliant. - Aren �t I? There �s more. - Well? - I scored at the party, too. But he wasn �t up for it, so I �m still hot for it. - And? - And until you meet up again... with your Miss Universe, you could have fun. No. I think I prefer to go home and sleep. Come on, César. It �s your birthday. - Skip it. I �m going home. - What �s up, César? Are you scared? - Want some ofthis? - No, thanks. Sure, act innocent now. I don �t need that to enjoy myself. I see that. That �s not a good idea. Do what you want. What �s happiness foryou? - What? - For me, this is happiness. Being here with you. What about you? I can �t handle heavy conversations right now. Your thoughts are somewhere else, right? Maybe. One thing really bothers me. - What? - You know nothing about me. Except my name �s Nuria and I �m a good fuck. Two important things. You don �t know my address or telephone number. We have to start somewhere. I �m going to see your house now. It �s not far. Tell me something. Do you believe in God? - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - You got home all right? Yeah. Well, I had a horrible dream. That you never saw me again. Yes. I came out ofyour house, go to my car... and that crazy bitch has been following me. - Who, that Nuria? - Yes. She comes over and says, "Want a lift?" She goes on so much I don �t know how to say no. So I get in the car, she drives faster and faster... and kills herself. - With me inside. - That �s horrible. But the worst part... is that my face is completely destroyed... like "The Phantom ofthe Opera." I couldn �t wake up. I was a monster. You �re a monster anyway. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I �m a monster, too. Look. How was your house? Was anyone left? Left where? In your house. There was a party, remember? A party? Dreaming is shit. Unless the dream wasnice. ln thepark, childrenplaying, agirl who lovesyou. That �s why. Thenyou wake up andyou want to die. At first, ldidn �t even have thestrength to react. I �dbeen in a coma forthree weeks. You were lucky. You could �ve died like Nuria. And what? I would �ve been betteroff. Didyousee herbody? - I never did. - You think she didn �t die? I �m like you. I only believe what I see. César, show me your face, please. - What for? - Look. It �s true you had an accident. It �s true... that you were disfigured, but not anymore. Take that off. The doctors fixed you. They didn �t have a fucking clue! In the accident, you didn �t lose just skin and some muscle. The blow was so severe it caused a multiple fracture ofthe skull. We secured the osseous structure with metal wires... and over that, we reinserted the muscles... we could still retrieve. Yes, very nice, but I know all that. I �ve had it explained to me 1 50 times. But you never say when you �ll operate. - I �ve been waiting two months. - But we �ve operated three times. I wouldn �t call that an operation. I �d call it-- Well, I don �t know what you �d call it. The symmetry isn �t perfect... but what we �ve done with your face is, if I may say so... a craftsman �sjob. We can �t work on skin which is pure scars. No, no, there must be some way. - What? - "What?" You �re the doctors, aren �t you? A transplant, whatever! There �s a problem with fibrosis, ifwe operate again... we mayjust cause further damage. We �d need millimetric precision... and as oftoday it �s impossible. Let �s look at this. I �m not an idiot. Today, people change their breasts. They have hair implants. They even change the color oftheir skin. Are you saying that on the threshold ofthe year 2000... you can �t do a simple operation and sort out this fuck-up? - It isn �t so simple, César. Remember-- - Don �t patronize me! Stop treating me like a child! I �m notjust any patient. And this isn �t a welfare hospital. I �m willing to pay any amount. You �re in charge. They say you �re the best in your field. Well, invent something. Experiment with me. I �ve seen patients who �ve lost all their features... who can �t even talk. At least you can lookyourself in the eyes. What good is that? Every time I look in the mirror, I want to die. Your case isn �t so serious. Just learn to accept it. And who will accept me? Will you explain to the people who look at me in the street? Will you tell them that looks aren �t important? That beauty is on the inside? We �d like to show you something. What is this? A facial prosthesis. We use it in extreme cases of rejection like yours. This is shit! It �s not the best solution... but it �s all we can do for the moment. I want a face! Not a mask! I don �t work miracles. That �s what the bastard said. But in the end, they did. Did what? Work a miracle. So it seems. So it seems? Things are or they aren �t? - Did they do it or not? - I �m tired. Why don �t you go? I �ll be back on Tuesday. Want anything? - No. - All right. See you on Tuesday. A pad and a pencil. But don �t tell them. I don �t want to owe them anything. Have I changed so much? Because I recognize you. How are you? "How are you?" You �re playing a part now, but I don �t know what. Your lips are smiling. - But your eyes are trembling. - What? You �re really very good as an actress. I asked you how you were. You didn �t answer. I �m alive. How should I be? And I �m tired. Tired ofwaiting foryou to call, even to say "Tough luck." - I was busy. - Bullshit! I was afraid you �d feel uncomfortable if I rang. You were afraid you �d feel uncomfortable. Afraid you couldn �t look me in the face, like now. That �s not true. I �ve often dreamed ofthis moment. What moment? The moment we �d meet again. In my dream, we werejust like this. Here, in the park. Although something was different. What? It wasn �t raining. I have to go, César. - What are you doing tomorrow night? - Studying. I �m very busy. - It �s Friday. We could meet. - I �ve got a lot to do. All right, so long. César! We �ll meet ifyou want. Ifyou want. Assoon as there is theslightestpossibilityofdeath... thestabilization andtransport team goes into action. Once the client is declared legally dead... he isput into a maintenance capsule... andthe transport legalities aresortedout. ln thestoreroom inArizona in the U.S.A... a team ofspecialistsprepare the body forfinalfreezing. Among othermeasures... bloodis replacedbya solution whichpreserves the organs. Finally... the client isput in the capsule.... where he willremain untilmedicine can reenergize him. To be honest, I �dhave to thinkit over. It �shardto accept the idea. Howshould we viewit? We are, undoubtedly, facinga majordevelopment... a newchallenge forhumanity. It �s understandable that the first reaction is rejection. We have nowgot the means to do it. We �vegot the technology. But, above all, we have sufficient moralmaturity... to understand what thisnewstep means... forhuman evolution, to lookat the future... andput an endto certain meaningless taboos... inheritedfrom ancient religions... oldanduselessmemories. Thankyou forspeaking to us. Andthankyou to ouraudience-- - Hi. - Hi. - What �s that? - Shit, isn �t it? But they suggested I wear it in case of infection. Well, kid, what �re you up to? Arguing with doctors all day. - You should go out more. - I �m trying. - What �re you having? - Rum and Coke. You want one? - Yes. - I �ll get you one. I �m going to the bathroom. - Take that off. - Why? Don �t you realize you won �t be able to hide your face? I told you, it �s to stop infections. Sure. Ifyou �re embarrassed, just go. Nobody asked you to come. - Sofía did. - What? - She didn �t want to be alone with you. - Why not? - You �re giving her a hard time. - I �m having a hard time. Talk to a psychologist, or to me. Don �t take it out on a girl you met once. Did she say that? Did she say that? - Bitch! - Come back! Whiskey and Coke. - What whiskey? - What did you say? What whiskey? Why don �t you ask me to my face, son ofa bitch? Ballantine �s. - Same again. - No, this one �s on me. - Why? -Just is. Fix your face, man! - Hello. - Hello. - Where were you? - Around. Pelayo went to look foryou. And I came to look foryou. Why? To- - No reason. To buy you a drink. - Want a drink? - No, thanks. Can you tell I �m elbowing in? The thing is, I �ve got a problem. A girl �s chasing me, and I need some help to get rid of her. Shit, shit, shit! She �s coming this way. She �s coming this way. Don �t look. Don �t look. You carry on talking, act as if he weren �t here. I mean, as if I were here. Keep talking. Tra-la-lee, tra-la-la. What a lovely conversation we �re having. So that �s it, here we are... having a bit ofa chat about life. That �s enough! Where the hell were you? Around. I �m leaving. I �m tired. You two stay ifyou want. Well, this is where I leave you. - I �ll see you home. - No, I live very close. - I �ve got the motorbike. - No. - Don �t be silly. - Lay off, Pelayo. She wants to go on her own. Shut up. You �re drunk. I might be drunk, but I �m not an idiot. - Anyway, I �m not drunk. - Really, you needn �t bother. - As you wish. - You �re the one who �s drunk. We �ll call you to meet some other day. All right. We could go to the movies. - You hear? - Great! Well, that �s it, then. No, don �t kiss me. You might get poisoned by my drunken breath. Well, we �ll meet up soon. Sure. We �ll meet up soon. It �s not cold. Well... I �m gonna have to go. Where are you going? I �vejust remembered my bike is back there. - I �ll go with you. - No. Why? You �re almost home now. - See you tomorrow. - Pelayo, wait a minute. What? I don �t know. You drank too much. We �ll talk tomorrow ifyou want. - Tomorrow I �ll wish I were dead. - You won �t. You just need to rest. Pelayo! You �re my best friend. Son ofa bitch! Openyoureyes. César. It �s me. Sofía! - What are you doing here? - Forgive me. Why? I love you. Come on. - What �s wrong? - Nothing. I still can �t believe this is really happening. Where �s Pelayo? I don �t know. He went with you, didn �t he? Yes. Ofcourse. Come on. God, what a sensation! Ofwhat? Do you ever feel you �ve lived something before? Yes. Why is that? They say it �s a lapse in the brain. I �ve been here before. It usually goes away after a few seconds. I don �t want it to go away. You �ve made use ofyour time. That �s all there is here. Very pretty. Is it Sofía? How much longer will I be here? No one ever knows that. Even my worst nightmare was never like this place. It �s a psychiatric penitentiary. No more, no less. - I shouldn �t be here. - You �re accused of murder. - I don �t even know what I did. - Tell me something. -Does the name Eli mean anything to you? -Eli? You know a girl with that name? No. Why do you ask? It seems you kept repeating it last night. I guess I was dreaming. - What did you dream? - I can �t remember. - It could be important. - How could it be important? Look, I can prove you didn �t know what you were doing... but first I have to find some explanation for all this. There is no explanation. I told you the other day. What did you dream, César? I don �t know. I only remember bits. First, I �m in a kind ofoffice. A secretary shows me into another office. There �saphoto ofa sunset anda man. Then, idon �t know. - Theyshowme lots ofpapers. - Whatpapers? ldon �t know. But lsign them. Does the office belong to your company? No, I don �t recognize it. You dreamed ofa place you �d never been? Yes. That happens a lot, doesn �t it? Are they the papers you signed with the doctors? No, what happened with the doctors was surreal. - Why? - They rang me to go to the hospital. When I arrived, the whole surgical team was waiting. Formonths, those faceshadlookedat me with indifference andimpotence. Nowthey were allsmiles. Thesame bastard who hadsaidmycase washopeless talkedabout an operation. Theyhada newrevolutionarysystem in the clinic now. Theysaidthat within two weeks my face wouldbe completely reconstructed. You didn �t believe them? Not at first. I thought it wasjust a way to get more money out of me. But they showed me all the gadgets for the operation. It lookedlikescience fiction. Alllcouldsee were cables, switches, monitors. Actually, lneverreally knew what they weregoing to do. But lthought I �dnothing to lose. Thosepeople were usedto rhinoplasties... liposuctions, hairtransplants, but my operation wasmuch more. ln less than a week... my life hadturnedaround. One night, I waslying on thegrounddrunk, waiting to die. The next morning, my dreams were coming true... like in the movies. Sofía loved me, and the doctors found the miracle cure. I don �t know. Obviously, I was suspicious. Suspicious? Ofwhom? Ofwhat? I don �t know. In life, you never know. Happiness comes when you least expect it. I once knew a guy who was alone in the world. Suddenly, he was married with two daughters. Fuck, you �ve got a strange idea of happiness. Well, that depends on the individual. What �s happiness foryou? What �s happiness foryou? Don �t ask any more stupid questions. But at that time, you were happy. Or weren �t you? So what? My life now is shit. All I can do is eat, shit, sleep and dream of my memories. It �s good that you remember. - Well? - Well, what? They were to remove the plates today. - And they did. - And? Well, my ears are where they should be. César, don �t scare me. - Take offthe plates. - You can do it. How did they do it? Wait.Just to say that I love you. You �re going too fast... considering we met yesterday. Yesterday? My birthday, don �t you remember? I met an incredible girl. Her name was Sofía. But today I woke up feeling great... and now I �m with the girl again. What is it? What is it? Ifyou want me to move, you have to put in a coin. Ting! We neverappreciate thegoodmoments tillthey �re over. Maybe that �s why they �regoodmoments. - We don �tstop to thinkabout them. - Perhaps. What happenedto Pelayo? - What �s up? - Hang on a minute. - That �s it. - About time. - Want anything else? - No, thanks. How �s things, Pelayo? Fine. How �s things, Pelayo? Fine. Yeah. I �m actually not as fucked up as I look. I �m used to you always winning, you bastard. - And Sofía isn �t that great. - You said she was ideal. Really? I was drunk. Anyway, we �re friends. Bastard! - What �s that on your face? - What? - Fuck, there �s a seam opening! - What are you on about? You fucking idiot! What �s the matter? I hate dreaming. You �re tickling me. What �s wrong? What is it? - Where �s Sofía? - What? What have you done with Sofía? - I am Sofía. - You bitch! - You �re mad. You �re mad. - Where is she? In one minute, I �m going to call the police. You �ll be in trouble ifSofía doesn �t appear. So you survived the accident. What accident? - Whose body was it? - I didn �t have an accident. No. It wasn �t an accident. It was attempted murder. A pity you didn �t see my face, bitch! - Why do this? How have I changed? - You haven �t. You �re the same lunatic who gate-crashed my party. I �m the girl you made love tojust now. I �m Sofía. Stop saying you �re Sofía, do you hear? Don �t say her name! You won �t tell me where she is. You never will. César. I love you. - Hello. - Hello. You can go. I �ll see to this. Right. Let me get this clear. - Where were you last night? - At home. I told that gentleman. At home. With whom? - With a girl. - The girl just questioned? No, that �s another girl. I was with Sofía. The girl I spoke to was Sofía. Yes, that �s what she says, but it �s a lie. - Who is she then? - She �s Nuria. Nuria what? I don �t know. She never told me her surname. Let �s see. You were at home with a girl called Sofía, and suddenly-- I go to the bathroom, come back, and she �s in Sofía �s place. Where �s Sofía? Ask Nuria. She �s pretending to be her. You don �t know her surname? But who do you believe, her or me? Listen, that girl �s papers are all in order. We �ve let her go. - You �ve what? - And I assure you she �s called Sofía. Sofía Cueto, and she lives at number 2, Quirós St. - No! - No, what? Well, yes, but that �s another girl. I know the real Sofía. Then tell me where she is. Because, legally the girl you �re talking about... only exists in your imagination. - I don �t believe this. - And another thing. The girl looks as ifshe �d been hit. She was in my house supplanting my girlfriend! I don �t know why, but she wouldn �t press charges. Fucking great! So now she �s the victim! Tell me. Are you on drugs? - God! - You were under psychiatric care. My face was destroyed in a car crash she caused! Your face looks fine. Because-- It doesn �t matter. I �ve got nothing more to say. Young man. I �d advise you to see a psychiatrist. Are you an idiot? - What the fuck is this? - What do you mean? Ifyou wanted to fuck her up, there are other ways to do it! - Keep away from Sofía! - It isn �t Sofía. It �s Nuria! Nuria �s dead! Calm down, oryou �ll be sleeping in a cell tonight! Don �t ever talk to me again! I don �t know what the cops told you, but Nuria is alive! The cops didn �t tell me, Sofía did. Listen, you spoke to her by phone, didn �t you? - Let go! - It wasn �t Sofía. Nuria can imitate her voice. She took her ID, her apartment. It wasn �t over the phone. I �vejust dropped her home. She looked like this. Nice photo, isn �t it? You going to say that isn �t Sofía? But that �s-- Is this a joke or what? You �re crazy, man. I �m crazy? I �m crazy? You �re the ones who are mad! You �re all mad! Let go of me! God, what �s happening? It �s my partners, right? They �ve paid you. This is a plot! Look at yourself. You haven �t been right since the accident. Fuckyou! Are you saying-- Are you saying this is the girl you ran after the other night? - Is this your ideal girl? - Yes! And you took her. You need a psychiatrist! Problems? I �m in no mood, sojust-- There �s an explanation for all this. César. Who are you? - You �ve seen me on TV. - What do you want? I �m here to help you. First ofall, it �s very important that you calm down. Calm down? You must overcome your fears and regain control. What control do you mean? I �m fine. Who says you aren �t? They do. All ofthem. They think I �m mad. No, ofcourse you �re not mad. But what if I told you you were dreaming? No, no, no. Why not? - I know what �s real, and this is real. - How do you know? You discoveryour dreams when you wake. I just know. - My dreams are much simpler than this. - No dream is simple. Look at those people. They seem to be talking about their own business. Completely unaware ofyou. And yet, they could be there because you wanted it. What �s more, you could have them at your complete service... or have them destroy you. I want them to be quiet. And you, too. See? What �s going on here? Someone tell me the fucking truth! The truth? Maybe you couldn �t take it. It had to be a setup, a bigjoke to drive me crazy. They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo, the police, the guy at the bar. - Who was he? - I don �t know. You said you saw him on TV. On what program? I don �t know! I don �t know. One that talked about freezing the dead. - Freezing the dead? - Cryonization. Like they did to Walt Disney. Maybe I can help you remember. Is that a threat? Lie down. What �s that? A syringe. Relax. My arm �s stinging. It �s a tranquilizer. What for? These things are all bullshit. Ifyou �d trusted psychiatrists more, you mightn �t be here now. That finger, it �s making me nervous. You needn �t be afraid. - I �m not afraid. - Stop talking and concentrate. Come on. Fuck. I feel dizzy. Good-bye, César. Verygood. Nowlet �ssee ifyou can tellme about that dream. - ln my dream, it isn �t raining. - The office dream. Eli. That �s it. I wantyou to tellme who Eli is. -A secretary. - Eli isa secretary? She tellsme togo in. They �re expectingme. Who �s expectingyou? - The Frenchman from the TV. - Sit down, please. It �sa contract. - Eli-- - César, who is Eli? You won �t regret it. Sign. - What areyousigning? - Eli willsee to everything. What haveyousigned? What �s wrong? What �s wrong, César? Whyareyou crying? - l �mgoing to die. - You �re notgoing to die. - ldon �t knowhowmany. - Howmany what? - Pills. - You tookpills? - Howmanyshouldltake? - Pills to feelbetter? ldon �t want to. When lcount to three, you �ll wake up. One. Two. I thought that, up to now, you �d told me the truth. What do you mean? You said you took nothing. César, I �ll askyou for the last time. - Did you take drugs? - Fuck! Why does everyone-- Stop playacting. Tell me the truth! - I must know what you took. - I didn �t take anything! Don �t you see? Your brain could have been affected by the pills. - I didn �t take any! - You said you did! It �sjust a dream! Why make it more important than it is? Can �t you tell dreams from reality? I can! Really? Don �t make me laugh! Bodies that come to life, people who disappear... you, the Phantom ofthe Opera! Tell me one thing. Do you remember what you did to Sofía? It wasn �t Sofía. I don �t care who it was. What did you do to her? You remember? My God! What are you doing? I thought you were a burglar. Who are you? I �m Sofía. Sofía. You �re not Sofía. César, this will all be over soon. We �ll be together again. You �ll forget Nuria and I won �t be afraid ofyou. - I �m thirsty. - I �ll get some water. Sofía! Yes, César, I �m Sofía. I �m Sofía. I want to see you. I want to see you. I want to see you! I want to see you! At times you dream you �re with someone. For example, your father. In seconds, he becomes your mother... and then, the news vendor on the corner. Yet you still feel as if you �re talking to the same person. You thought you were at home, but suddenly you realize you �re in a school. Or a hospital, or a prison. Dreams are like that. And at times the mind behaves as if it were in a dream. - You know what derangement is? - For fuck �s sake! Say I �m stupid ifyou want, but this isn �t derangement! Then what is it? You tell me, because I don �t know. I don �t know what �s in here, or why you killed your girlfriend. I don �t know who Eli is, or that man from the TV. - I don �t know anything. - That makes two of us. Will you still come after the trial? Don �t you hate the sight of me? - What will you plead? - Why do you ask that? The first hearing is next week. Temporary derangement. It �s your best chance. Even so, it won �t be much use. They won �t believe me. Even I don �t believe it. What do you believe? I thinkyou �re very sick and should stay here for a long time. Don �t worry. I �ll get at least 20 years. César, you may not believe it, but I care about you. I care a lot about you. Look, kid. Your case interests me. I �m sorry about what �s happened. I even thought someone was playing tricks on you, but... I can �t and mustn �t exceed my duties. - I �m just a psychiatrist. - You don �t look like one. - What do I look like? - My father. Preaching at me all day. Your father �s dead. There you go. By the way, what happened to that man with the wife and two daughters? I don �t know. I never saw him again. Take my advice, get a lawyer. Good-bye, César. Good-bye. ...the main Spanish investment, but certainlythe most novel. ...its economicpresence in Cuba. ...depending on the era. ln the Roman Empire, forexample, the normalthing was to live... only25years. Who �s got the remote? Give it to me! Get it off him! What �s up? There �s a computer here connected to Internet. They �ll only let me use it ifyou come with me. - Why do you want Internet? - I know what Eli is. Wait! Eli isn �t a person, it �s a company. - How do you know? - It isn �t Eli. It �s L.E. They �re the initials ofan American company. - What are you doing? - Checking the "initials program." It �ll tell us all it knows about L.E. Shit! - It �ll take ages. - No, wait. Fuck! I feel like I �ve done this before. A cerebral dysfunction. A lapse in the brain. No, not this time. My God! - That �s it. - The photo in your dream? I had to see it before I could dream about it, right? "Cyronics." - Cryonization. - I �ll print this. Wait a minute. I don �t see what this has to do with your case. The key is in here. Look, there �s an office in Madrid. I �ll go and check it out. No! I have to go, too. - I can �t get you out of here. - I �d be let out under supervision. Make up some excuse. - It isn �t easy. - You can do it. You know something else, don �t you? I don �t know anything. - I �vejust got a feeling. - What is it? I have to go there, one way or another. Let �s get things straight. We �re outside, I �m armed. Myjob is to stop you doing anything stupid. Try anything, and you get a bullet. I �ve been here before. - This way. - Move. You �ve got 20 minutes. It �sjust like in my dream. Good morning. Can I help you? Well, actually, we wanted to speak to Mr. Duvernois. He �s my son. He �s very shy. Mr. Duvernois isn �t here right now. But, first ofall, do you know what cryonization is? Well, more or less. Here are some leaflets. You can read them while you �re waiting. One of my colleagues will be with you soon. Thankyou. "Live without limits. Tomorrow is for the foresighted." What is this? Some kind ofsect? "Cryonization is the biostasis or preservation of human beings. It is the bridge to carry our patients to a future... when technology will restore them to life." You pay to live eternally. They laughed atJules Verne. César, all this is absolutely impossible. What do you know ofthe future? They promise what the Church has always promised. Immortality. Except they �re quacks, not priests. How are you involved? You �re not cryonized. You �re alive. This is the contract, ifyou want to look at it. The procedure is very simple. You could die at any time. Today, tomorrow, in 20 years. It doesn �t matter to us. At the very moment you �re declared legally dead... Life Extension transfers your body to our store in Arizona. There, it �s frozen at minus 78 degrees. We call that "total suspension," and it costs $240,000. 30,000 pays for the freezing process, and the rest... goes into an investment fund... the interests from which pay for maintenance... and resurrection costs, the day that it �s possible. If it is possible. We believe that the reanimation ofthe dead will be possible. - What �s this? - What? Clause 1 4. Artificial perception. It �s a concept that we haven �t fully developed yet. Look. This is a life. Birth and death. Let �s say you �ve got a terminal illness. Ofcourse you want to go on living, but not in the future. That doesn �t interest you. You want to live your life now. Very well. You die, we freeze you... and when we can resuscitate you, we �ll have you live... a dream. - A dream? - It will all look real. Your family and friends, your city... the world, even this office. But it �ll be a virtual reality. What �s more, we �ll make you forget that you �ve died... and that you signed this contract. - How? - Very simple. Wiping it from your memory. You �ll live your life linearly, as if nothing had happened. And best ofall, you �ll live it as you like, as you wish. You �ll decide at all times. But what ifthere were mistakes? What ifthe dream was transformed into a nightmare? Well, the subconscious can always play a dirty trick. But we �re not cowboys. This is a serious company. And virtual reality technology is constantly making huge advances. Look. I �ll be honest. Signing Clause 1 4 is like signing for paradise. It �s hard to believe. But they laughed atJules Verne. Excuse me. - Where are you going so fast? - To the bathroom. - Well, not so fast. - I �ll go with him. Hejust felt ill, don �t worry. César, calm down, please. This is a dream. It �s the only explanation. What he said is impossible. In the 20th century, but maybe not in the 30th. - Maybe not, but we �re in 1 997. - That �s what it seems. - I paid for it to seem like that. - Listen! Ifthis is a dream-- Look at me! Ifthis is a dream, it means that I don �t exist! - I just imagine you. - No! - César, I �m real. - How do I know that? Can �t you tell a dream from reality? Is this a dream, eh? Tell me, is this a dream? César, I �m wearing myselfout over this case. There is no case. I didn �t kill anyone. It �s all a nightmare. Fuck it, César, trust me! This isn �t a dream. - They got it wrong. - Who? I don �t know! But they mixed up Sofía and Nuria! I see a face that isn �t mine. I �m sick of hearing that! Your face is fine. You �re behaving like a child, hiding behind that mask. - Go on, take it off! - I don �t want to see myself! I don �t care about that. I want to see you. Don �t you realize? All that matters is what I see! It �s my dream! Say that once more and I �ll have you locked up in an asylum. Show me your face. Now. You owe it to me. César, look in the mirror and tell me ifyou thinkyou �re disfigured. God! Why do you keep seeing what isn �t there? - You look fine. - I �m a monster! What do you mean? Anybody �d like to have your face. You look normal. Notjust normal. You �re handsome! César, listen. Maybe you �ve got something like anorexia. Some girls insist they �re fat and end up crazy. César! I want to wake up! I want to wake up! - Hold it! - I want to wake up! Fuck! Shit! - Freeze! - Don �t shoot! This is a nightmare! It �s a nightmare! You! Wait a minute! You �re not to leave! Stop! Wait a minute! It �s a dream! It �s a dream! Don �t move! Drop the gun! - I want to wake up. I want to wake up. - Don �t move! I want to wake up! Antonio. Antonio! What? You �re crushing me. I �d better not move. I �ve been shot in the back. How do you know? Well... because-- What �s going on here? What the fuck �s going on? I told you, it �s a dream. Shut up! Shut up! I know what this is. It �s one ofthose Candid Camera jokes. You did a greatjob, I loved it, but enough �s enough! - I see someone. - Where? Up there, on the roof. I can �t see a thing. Where are you going? Come on, Antonio. Don �t think about it anymore oryou �ll go crazy. Hello, César. It �s time I introduced myself. My name is Serge Duvernois. I represent Life Extension. We met... 1 50 years ago. What? Has the world gone mad? There �s no world. It �s all in that gentleman �s mind. Including you and me. Sure! Shall I thump you to see if it hurts? Try it. They can make you disappear right now, like everyone else. - And who are "they," may I ask? - The company. Life Extension. They know everything we �re saying. They know what is going through César �s mind an instant after he thinks it. Ifthey can make me disappear, why haven �t they done it? It would be virtually incorrect. You �vejust saved his life. Virtually incorrect? Do you think I �m an idiot or what? No, quite the opposite. You �re a great guy. A character who is very necessary for César. A character? - Where are you going? - To look for someone. There is no one. People aren �t necessary now. Why didn �t you wake me before? You only had to ask. But that was difficult. Because, in theory, you wouldn �t know you were dreaming. Since when? Remember the day ofthe discotheque? That night, whenyou fellasleep on thesidewalk... was the one chosen forthesplice. Whatsplice? Thesplice betweenyourreallife andyour virtuallife. A splice of150years whichyou didn �t notice... becauseyou were dead andfrozen. From whenyou woke up... nothing wasreal. We wiped what really happened from your memory. What was it? You never saw Sofía again. And the doctors were never able to rebuild your face. You woke up on thatstreet with an awfulhangover. Youshutyourselfaway formonths. One dayyou learned that we existed. You came to the office, yousignedthe contract... andthen... you killedyourself. lpaidforthis? I paid for Nuria to come back as Sofía? I paid to look like a monster again? I paid to live this nightmare? You paid to live whateveryou wanted. Wejust provided the setting and the characters. You invented your hell. I tried to warn you in that bar. I said it all depended on your mind. Do I just have to want it? - Can Antonio come-- - There �s no one here. They can �t have made 4 million people disappear! You �ve overcome your fears. Ifyou want, we can try again... have you live a wonderful dream... with money, friends, Sofía, or whatever girl you want. You just have to ask. I don �t want more dreams. It isn �t a dream! César, listen to me. This is real. This man is a sham. Let �s go down and look for people. Ignore him. It �s logical for him to behave like this... but he doesn �t feel anything. I don �t feel anything? I don �t feel anything? What do you know about what I feel? Ignore him, he isn �t real. Yes, I am real! I �ve got a wife and two daughters. His personality is designed so that he �ll say all this now. Where are my daughters? God! César, we can offeryou another possibility. In 1 997, it was impossible to rebuild your face. But out there, it �s the year 2 1 45. You wouldn �t believe the things surgery can do. You could wake up... and live in the future like a normal person. - In the future? - You have to choose. How could I wake up? How would you wake from your worst nightmare? No, César, don �t listen to him! Your partners set this up! They want you to kill yourself! He �s done that. Now it �ll just be a formality. - I �m going to do it. - Very well. Do you have any wish before you die? Let them out there read my mind. Who are you? I don �t know. Don �t keep suffering. It �s all in your head. It �s all psychological. Come on, César. - What will happen to them? - Don �t prolong this farewell. You think they �re your friends, but they �rejust images. That man isn �t really crying. - I forgot, I get vertigo. - Then don �t look. Good-bye, César. Relax. Relax. Openyoureyes. -Hey, thanks for that interview, Barry. -No problem. Excuse me, do you have change for the phone? Sure, yeah. What, do you need me to break a million? Come on. What's with you reporters always getting on me about my salary? It's funny, calling $7 million a salary. What do you make? That's kind of personal. Exactly. But what you make is news, because it's so gigantic. What do you make, really? About, say, $50,000 a year? Yeah, about that. Okay, that's two columns a week, about eight columns a month. About $500 a column. -lt is? -Yeah, it's $1 a word. For every little word like "the" and "a," if you hit the letter "a," it's $1. I guess I'm doing all right then. -You see? -Yeah. Can I borrow a quarter for the phone? -Here, take two. -Thanks. Hi, I'm Ray, and I live here in Long lsland with my wife Debra. She's great with the kids, the house, everything. I don't know how she does it. We've got a daughter Ally... and twin two-year-old boys. It's not really about the kids. My parents live across the street. That's right. And my brother lives with them. Now, not every family would go by on a conveyor belt for you... but mine would because-- Everybody loves Raymond. Yeah. -Hey. -Hey. -Want some sandwich? -Hey! No, it's okay. Ma, I need construction paper. Ally's making valentines for school. I used to love Valentine's Day. Then I met your father. I used to love every day. Anybody see today's paper? -Why? What's up? -I'm in it. "Large male seeks any woman." I discontinued my ad. And I happen to have a girlfriend now, thank you very much. -It's in the Metro section. -Let me see. Here you are. Do you see who's at the other end of those handcuffs? My God. Leon. Look, Frank, your friend, Leon. You arrested Leon? My Leon? Technically, now the State of New York's Leon. I've known this guy 40 years. Since when is it a crime to sell merchandise... at far below wholesale prices? You should've seen his warehouse. Fake designer luggage, imitation jewelry, "Macin-tush" computers. Hey, wait a minute. Didn't you buy my engagement ring from Leon? Relax. He assured me it's a one-of-a-kind, flawless diamond. -That's a fake. -It's a fake? How do you know that's a fake? Because I have 300 more exactly like them down at the station. I want another ring, Frank. You lived 40 years with that one, you can live another 10. I don't think so, Frank. I'm going shopping. You'll be amazed at your generosity. -Oh, my God. -What? -Debra's ring is from Leon, too. -You went to Leon? I listened to him. I was just trying to get more for my money. I wanted to get Debra a ring that she could show her mother. And Leon threw in a set of golf clubs. I got snow tires. What did I do? I can't have Debra think... I didn't care enough about her to go to a real jeweler. -She's wearing glass! -It's not glass. It's glassette. I gotta do what's right. I gotta replace her stone with another one. A real one. I'll spend $1,000 if I have to, that's all, $2,000. $2,000 for a diamond? -Hey, I know another guy-- -No more guys. You're just gonna have to tell your wife... you purchased her a discount engagement ring from a crook. I can't let her find out. She's going to think I'm a slimeball. I'll have to steal it from her. -Hey, here you go. -Oh, good. Thanks, Daddy. Hey, look at all these valentines. -Where's Daddy's? -You gotta get yours from Mommy. -I've been trying to get mine from her for-- -All right. I got your valentine right here. I love you. I love you? A little wine with lunch? Well, tomorrow's Valentine's Day. Sweetie, did you know that Daddy asked me to marry him on Valentine's Day? What did you say? Well, I thought about it, but I said "yes" anyway. I love your daddy very much. And I love Mommy. -Hey. -Hey. Let me help you with that. What are you doing here? -Did you it. It was a difficult time. Gran lost her son. I lost my parents. I'm not a big believer in happy endings, I'm afraid. Anyway, gran stepped in. Took an angry, obnoxious, young boy under her wing and... and made me the simply unpleasant man I am today. So, isn't your fiancé starting to get just a tad lonely? You know, Victor's having the time of his life right now. And I doubt he even notices that I'm gone. What about you? Don't you have a girlfriend? - That is a very, very long story. Yeah? I'm not surprised. It's been about a year since I've seen Patricia. And you broke up with her? Are you insinuating that I'm more the type to be dumped rather than do the dumping? Maybe I am. Actually, I did break up with Patricia. This time. Okay, that's enough. All right. That's enough. - Sophie... - That's enough. - Your writing is really good. - Thank you. No. It's really, really, really good. Why are you so surprised? How come you've never shown your work to anyone? - I never feel like it's finished. - Why? Because I guess I'm a perfectionist. You know that's just another way of saying "I'm a chicken"? Listen. You've got nothing to be afraid of. You're not a fact checker. You're a writer. What was that for? - I'm not a chicken. And I'm not a gentleman. Do you think we should get back to Claire? Yeah. Many more Lorenzos. Okay. We should get back to Claire. I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Take him! Take him! I am Lorenzo Bartolini! I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Wow. I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Do you know what you are? You are the Montagues and the Capulets. Oh, you mean... Oh. Well, at least I'm not, um, Romeo. - That's the understatement of the century. - No, no, no, because you see, if I... if I found the love of my life, I wouldn't stand there like an idiot whispering in a garden. I-I would just... grab her from that blasted balcony and... and be done with. Do you believe in destiny? Do you? Yeah, I think so. I think... it's destiny that I'm here, right now. With Claire. Of course. Of course. With Claire. Well, this is the street. Well, there's 2. Here's number 2. This is what I feared the most. - Charlie, we don't even know if it's him. - I hope it's not. I hope it's not. Either way, we're finished. We're done. - No. Not here. W-when-when-when do we stop? Over the next hill? Or the next? Scour the whole country? No. No. It ends here. There are other Lorenzos not too far away from here. It's not the ending you want, is it? This isn't just... a clever story with a clever ending. - Stop it, Charlie. - It's our life. It's my gran's life. - It's not about... Charlie, it's not about a story. No, no, no, she's already lost the man once. How many more times would you have her lose him? You know what? I don't expect you to understand any of this because you don't know a thing about real loss. Yeah. You're wrong. Sophie's mother ran away from her when she was a little girl. It's different, gran. It's different. You're right. But... Sophie's mother chose to leave her. And you always knew your mum and dad loved you. Come in. Hi. Oh, dear. I just wanted to see if you were all right. I'm okay. Claire, I'm so sorry if I caused you... No. Every minute has been so special. Oh, darling. May I? One of the great joys in life is having one's hair brushed. Charlie, say you're sorry. In the eye, Charlie. With contrition. Sophie... - Thank you. - I'm afraid I... In the eye. Yes, gran, I'm not 12. Prove it. I'm sincerely sorry, Sophie. It won't happen again. Excellent. Sophie, I want to make a toast. - Thank you. I want to thank you for the wonderful thing you did for a complete stranger. I'll never forget it. Nor I. I had the most incredible... few days. I really have, and, um, I can't thank you enough for letting me tag along. Oh, I think you did more than tag along. Here is to all our loved ones, wherever they may be. May I join you? Please. I am sorry, Sophie. I used to lay out under the stars as a kid, in the summertime. "Doubt thou the stars are fire "Doubt that the sun doth move "Doubt truth be a liar "But never doubt I love." Do you think he's out there? Lorenzo? Yeah. He's somewhere. And am I wrong? To insist she quit? No, you know, you can't go on forever. At some point, you have to stop. Then why is it that I feel like a schoolboy on Sunday? It's nearly tomorrow and I don't want to go. Me, either. And I always liked school. - Morning. - Morning. Thank you. How'd you sleep? I slept fine. How about you? Ah, yes. Great. Thanks. Good morning. - Good morning. - How are you? - Good morning, my darling. It's a beautiful day. Oh, Sophie, would you mind, um, going in the front? Because I'd love to stretch my legs for a bit. Okay. Fantastic, darling. The stars were spectacular from my window. Look. That vineyard. That's our favorite wine. Let's turn in there and have... a goodbye toast. Okay. Charlie, stop! Nana, what is it? It's Lorenzo. Who? The boy? All right, nana. Let's get you in the shade, hm? Shall we? I am Lorenzo Bartolini. Sophie. I think this is... Do you know a Lorenzo Bartolini? - I asked him and... - I am Lorenzo Bartolini. - You are! Oh, my... Sophie, he... he's the grandson! - Can I help you? - Si. Yes. We are... we're looking for a Lorenzo Bartolini. I am Lorenzo Bartolini. - He's Lorenzo, too. - Do-do you have a father also named Lorenzo? Yes, he went out riding. But what can I do for you? I'm-I'm sorry. We're being... terribly rude. I'm... Charlie Wyman. - I'm Sophie. Lorenzo. Lorenzo. We have been on quite a journey for your father. You see, my grandmother, Claire, knows him. Charlie. Charlie, let's go! Let's go! All right. Nana, nana, nana, Lorenzo is here. He's out riding, but he's going to be back any minute. Well, then, let's go before he comes back. Nana, we've come all this way. Come on. - I've been ridiculous. I've been completely ridiculous. He knew me when I was... 15 years old, a girl. That girl's gone. Oh, my God. Claire? Yes. So many years. Yes, 50. If you allow me. I really don't know how to express myself. Well, I went for a ride this morning as an old man, and I came back as a teenager again. I'm so very happy you all meet... Claire and her grandson, Charlie, and their lovely friend, Sophie. My dear Claire, you have told me you lost your Jack. And you know I lost my Rosa. - Yeah. But destiny wanted us to meet again. Health to the Bartolini family. To the Bartolinis. I'm sorry I was late. No. When we are speaking about love, it's never too late. Well, bad luck, eh? All hope lost and... he rides in at the last moment on a white horse. No one will believe it. Promise me... Promise me you'll finish the story. I guess this is it. And I'm sorry it is. Yeah, me, too. Sophie, I, um... I-I never should've kissed you. I was, uh, completely out of bounds. Mmm. You're engaged... and... It's time to go. Goodbye, Charlie. I'll miss you. Hi. It is time to, um... I must get back to Victor. Sorry. Oh... oh, yes. Of course. So, where's Charlie? AND THEN WHEN FANG BARKS, IT WILL DESTROY THEM. THAT'S BRILLIANT, MAX! HOW DO WE PUT THE BOMB IN THE SHAFT? "HOW DO WE PUT THE BOMB IN THE SHAFT," YES. WELL, THAT'S THE PART OF THE PLAN I HAVEN'T WORKED OUT YET. ( shrieks, speaks German ) - ( shrieks ) - THAT'S IT! RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT? THAT'S HOW WE DO IT-- IF YOU CAN IMITATE HIS VOICE, YOU CAN COMMAND FANG TO DROP THE BOMB DOWN THE SHAFT. BUT HOW CAN I IMITATE A PARROT? NO, MAX, YOU IMITATE THE KAOS MAN'S VOICE. - LIKE THE PARROT'S DOING. - BUT HE SPEAKS GERMAN, - I DON'T KNOW ANY GERMAN. - I DO. YOU DO? WELL, HOW DO YOU SAY "PICK UP THE BOMB"? - NIMM DIE BOMBE! - NIMM DIE BOMBE! FANG, NIMM DIE BOMBE! - NIMM DIE BOMBE! - ( knocking ) Chief: MAX, 99, ARE YOU IN THERE? IT'S THE CHIEF. HE'S HERE. HURRY! HOW DO YOU SAY "DROP THE BOMB DOWN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT"? LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT. LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT. FANG, LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT. ( whirring ) - HOW DO YOU SAY "BARK"? - BELL! FANG, BELL! FANG, "HITEN THE DIRTEN." GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT. - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, WE'RE OKAY, CHIEF. - FANG SAVED US. - FANG, KOMMEN SIE HER AND SITTEN DOWNEN! ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, MAX? YES, CHIEF, AND FANG DOESN'T UNDERSTAND GERMAN ANYMORE. THE EXPLOSION MUST'VE RELEASED HIS MIND. - BETTER TEST HIM, MAX. - RIGHT, 99. FANG, LIE DOWN, FANG. LIE DOWN. BEG, FANG. BEG! BEG, FANG. HOW ABOUT THAT, CHIEF? JUST AS GOOD AS NEW. THERE YOU GO. ( groans ) SORRY ABOUT THIS, CHIEF. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MAX. YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ME FOR BREAKING ORDERS. I UNDERSTAND. MAX, WHAT'S FANG'S DUCK DOING HERE? THAT'S NOT FANG'S DUCK, MAX. THAT'S YOUR SPECIAL GUN. WHEN I REALIZED I'D TAKEN IT FROM YOUR OFFICE, I PUT IT IN MY POCKET. I MUST HAVE DROPPED IT. - SOMEONE BETTER TELL FANG! - ( gunshots ) NOW YOU KNOW WHY I PUT HIM ON A DESK JOB. DON'T WORRY, CHIEF. I'LL HAVE HIM REPORT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING FOR TARGET PRACTICE. ( theme music playing ) Two American scientists are lost in the swirling maze... of past and future ages... during the first experiments on Americas greatest and most secret project- the Time Tunnel. Tony ewman and Doug Phillips now tumble helplessly toward a new, fantastic adventure... somewhere along the infinite corridors of time. This then, Your Majesty, is the great Magna Carta... limiting the powers of the king... and establishing the rights of man. It needs only your signature... to make it the law of the land. You- the Earl of Huntington- you call yourself a loyal subject? This is treason. Treason! Ill hang you and all the barons who follow your flag. Seize the traitor. Seize him! Do not let him escape. Surrender. The Time Tunnel. Surrender now! Bring them before the king. Who is this man? Obviously a servant of Huntington. Your Majesty, even traitors can serve a purpose. Spare them if they tell us what we must know. No one will say King john is without mercy. Huntington... I will spare your life and the life of your servant here- Your Majesty, Im not this manss servant. As for this- I will not discuss these treasonable demands with you... or your fellow barons. Not treasonable, but a respectful request from the Council of Barons. All we want is a charter guaranteeing the rights... - of all our free men. - just a charter. A great charter- or as you call it, a Magna Carta- stripping your king of all his powers. If I dont return to the Council of Barons... within 48 hours, they will call their armies... - into the field. - Rebellion? Yes, Your Majesty. Youll hang... and Ill put the heads of all the others on public display. Take them to the dungeon. And if they dont tell you where the barons are meeting... make them beg for death. Chain them to the walls. Go tell the captain of the guards to search the castle. More of Huntingtons men may have got in. Im sorry you became involved in my quarrel with the king... but well die for a good cause. Just who are you? That doesnt matter. But as for the Magna Carta, King john will sign it. - Im sure of it. - Itss a pity wellll never live to see it. Hot enough to sear the flesh? Heat the other iron. Where is the Council of Barons meeting? Whos going to talk first? The servant? Or the master? He knows nothing. Begin with me. No! - Ill tell you where the barons are meeting. - Dontt be a fool! If you do know, keep quiet. Theyll kill us immediately. Perhaps your servant prefers mercy. Well? Tell me, but if you lie- Therell be a hundred soldiers out there in less than a minute... and well be dead in less than five. Now. Try for a transfer. If only that door holds for another second or two, well have enough power, but- The fix isnt firm. All we have is the year and the month- June, 1215 A.D. Ray- the homing post. If we could get it to Doug and Tony... we could bring them right back into the Tunnel. But Ann, weve tried that before. Well, yes, sir, but never in this time period. And weve improved its capabilities. All right. All right, lets try it. If we can get one of these bars out... we might be able to squeeze through. It would take more than the strength of the three of us. This is malleable iron, not hardened steel. Weve got a chance, Tony. Here. What are you doing? These coals will soften that metal. Itll never work! Get ready to fight. - Thats it. - Itss working. Keep going. Its out. Come on. Go on, Tony. You first. Hurry! Well be safe in the forest. Go ahead. Ill take care of him. Go! They caught him before he could get away. You know, Tony, if it wasnt for him... we would have had it by now. - Who is he? - Someone called the Earl of Huntington. The Tunnel transferred us into King johns time. King john? Hes the one who was forced to sign the Magna Carta. Right, although Im afraid a lot of bloodss... gonna be spilled before he signs it. Now, Huntingtons the leader of the barons... who wantjohn to grant the charter. Doug, we wouldnt stand a chance if we tried to get back into the castle to help him. If only we could find the other barons. You know, according to history... John met the barons at Runnymede. I wonder if thats where they could be gathered now. We could try to find them. At least we could warn them about what happened to Huntington. Come on. Reading: 114.36 over 11. 114.36 over 11. General, were set. All Doug and Tony have to do is touch that post... in order for us to retrieve them. All right. Activate. It should reach its target. How soon can we get an image? As soon as we rebuild power. Get the window bars repaired. - Get the guards mounted and make haste after them. - Aye! - I heard something. - just a bird. Aye-A bird. A large green bird... ready to catch a couple of worms. - Out of the frying pan. - What was that? - Speak up, man. - Were strangers. Were just passing through. Aye. Well, you must be a couple of Frenchmen. Why, no Englishman would be buried in such clothes. Little worm. If you defeat me,youll go free- aye- but if you lose, were gonna skin you both alive. Eh! Hah! Youre just a greenhorn. Oh! Right. Will you yield, or shall I squash you? Huh? Ah, you did well, and it took some doing to beat you. Aye, Littlejohn. I think hed make a welcome addition... - to Robin Hoods band. - Robin Hood? Yes, were his followers. Imm Friar Tuck. Youre already met Littlejohn. You know, I always thought that Robin Hood was a legend. Well, a living legend. Why, everyone in England tells of the deeds... of the Earl of Huntington when he was an outlaw. Huntingtons being held prisoner in King johnss castle. Prisoner? Why, he went to them in peace. Oh, well storm the castle and carvejohnss heart out. With a handful of men, we wouldnt stand a chance. Lets get back to our camp and put our heads together. Are you with us? I guess we owe it to him. - Were with you. - Hmm. Not in those clothes. Well get some proper green for you both. Ill ride out to the castle and tell the guard at the gate... of an important message from the king. Now then. The minute the gate opens... - well all charge out of the forest. - No. No, no, no, no. The archers on the walls would cut us down... before wed reach the courtyard. No. Weve got to steal into the castle somehow- two or three of us- then well seize King john... and hold him as a hostage to free Robin. - Too bold a plan. - Thats exactly why it may work. - Whats that? - Scatter! Come on. No. No. - Hes badly hurt. - Get on without me. Lean on me. Come on. Doug. A staff,quick.! Quick, after them. You two that way. You with me. Well done, lads. - Now for this. - No! No, itll only cause more bleeding. Where can we go? He needs attention badly. Kirkley Hall. He can be treated there. Its a retreat in the forest, run by the Baroness Elmont. She used to give us refuge in our outlaw days. Come on, old friend. Lean on me. Come on. Come on. What made Huntington think I would agree... to even one clause of his precious Magna Carta? Your Majesty. We trapped a group of Huntingtons followers. - Did you slaughter them? - No, Your Majesty... but every road and pass out of the forest is guarded. One of them is badly wounded. They wont escape, Your Majesty. If they do, Engelard, itll be your head. - But your Majesty, Ill do everything I- - Oh, stop mumbling. Go make Huntington talk. He says these men wont escape... but as long as any of Huntingtons band remains alive... our plan to crush these barons is in danger. Engelard said one of them was badly wounded. I know these former outlaws. Theyre sentimental fools. Rather than desert a wounded comrade... theyll jeopardize their own safety to help him. Your Majesty, a purse of gold can succeed... where Engelards soldiers have failed. Bribery is the best weapon. Use it. Shall I bleed you a little more? - Engelard- - Speak up. When are you going to tell me where the barons are meeting? When the Magna Carta is signed... you will be among the first to be tried by its terms. For serving my king? Our laws will make each man responsible for his own actions. You wont live to see that day. Tony and Doug must have gotten out somehow. Wheres the homing post? Try to locate Tony and Doug. It may be possible to transfer the homing post to their new location. - Friar Tuck. - Baroness, sanctuary. Littlejohns been wounded. - Will you give us shelter? - Of course. Theres nothing I wouldntt do for the followers of the Earl of Huntington. Put him there. - How did it happen? - We had a fight with the kings men. I assumed as much. But Huntington has sworn allegiance to King john. Well, thats all changed. Hes being held a prisoner at King johnss castle. I must send a messenger to the village- to fetch someone with skill to cure it. Im sorry. No one else must know werre here. But Littlejohn might die. I must send someone- someone who can help him. I can take care of him. - Sterilize this. - St - Sterilize? Yes. Put the blade in the fire and heat it... until its red hot. Do you have any medicines that might relieve the fever? I have some herbs. But I still think- - Will you show me where they are, please? - All right. The best thing for a fever is bleeding with leeches. No. Hes lost too much blood already. Sulfur. Some sort of phosphorus. This root powder is used to relieve pain. - Tastes like snake root. - Is there anything there you can use? Well, this is an alkaloid tranquilizer- Reserpine. Will you mix this with water, please? You know, some of these so-called remedies... if mixed in the right proportions... could be highly explosive. I want you to drink this. Itll help your pain. Thats enough. Will you just get this bastard arrow out of me, man? Im sick enough as it is, without drinking that poison. - Ready? - Aye. The knife. Tell me. What is the trouble between Huntington and the king? It has to do with the Great Charter. If King john knew better, hed sign it without a fight. Hes going to have to anyway. Huntington gave the king an ultimatum. Either he signs a charter guaranteeing that he rules... according to laws fair to everyone... or hes faced with rebellion. Where did you learn the art of curing, Douglas? Just battlefield first aid, Tuck. I think Littlejohn will be all right now. - What of Robin Hood? - Weve got to find a way to rescue him. Inform the barons of what has happened. Ill send my messenger to them. Where are they meeting? - Oh, the Council is- - No, Tuck. What you said before still goes. If the barons decide to march on the castle, Robin Hoods as good as dead. I should have a voice in this matter too. If I am placing Kirkley Hall in jeopardy... the least you can do is consider my opinion. - We are extremely grateful. - Save your thank-yous. If you wish to risk your lives entering the castle, all right. But suppose you fail. Let me send my messenger to the barons. Where did you say theyre meeting? Well, theres risk either way. More risk to Robin Hood if they decide to march against King john. Yeah. The only thing thats keeping Robin alive... is thatjohn doesnt know the council is meeting at Runnymede. There will be no messages to the barons. As you wish. The answer is to use stealth. There is a way to enter the castle... with no risk whatsoever. I myself shall see you safely in. We three will go. You will remain with Littlejohn. - Weve got them. - Theyrre together. A perfect fix. Ann, lock the coordinates... and switch the image to the homing post. Good. Prepare to transfer the post. The coordinates are aligned. The post hasnt moved. Try more power. - We lost the image. - Worse yet, weve lost the fix on Doug and Tony. Ah, my dear Baroness. The guards informed me you asked for shelter. - Welcome, in the name of the king. - Thank you. Who are these men? These humble monks are going with me to London on official business. Will you provide quarters for them? And while Im here... Id like to report on conditions at Kirkley Hall. Certainly. Report to the chamberlain in the tower. Hell see that yourre made comfortable. - Have you any news? - Yes. Littlejohn and another outlaw are at Kirkley Hall. Ah! Send some men to Kirkley Hall. Youll find two of the outlaws there. Bring them back to the palace. The king will be grateful. Hes already shown his gratitude. Would the king like to know where the Council of Barons... - is meeting? - You know? Good news, Your Majesty. The baroness earned the gold you sent her. Guards are on their way to seize Littlejohn... - and another outlaw at Kirkley Hall. - Well done. And she also knows where the Council of Barons is meeting. At Runnymede, Your Majesty. Runnymede. Good. Ill get them all. But first- Huntington. Come with me. Dubois, theres something I didntt tell you. Those men who came here with me - I led them into a trap. - What are you saying? - Theyre Robin Hoodss men. If one of Huntingtons men escapes... youll answer to the king. Guards! Blessings on you, my son. The king has sent us to give the last rites to the Earl of Huntington. Kindly open the door. Ive seen other determined men. They all talk eventually. Why not save yourself a lot of agony? No need to lock it. Well be but a moment. First things first. Who are you, and what do you want? The king sent us to offer last rites to the prisoner. Last rites? A good idea. That may break Huntingtons spirit. One sound and you die. - Friar Tuck. - Aye, Robin? Well soon be back in the forest. - Call the guard in. - Guard. Come in. I need your help. Quiet, if you want to live. Dont kill me. I was only doing my duty to my king. Ray, somehow weve got to let him know about the homing post. If I activate it, he may spot it. Quick, quick, quick. Theres someone coming down the corridor. Engelard! Behind you- Theyre escaping. Open this door! You dare to lock a door on your king. Ill see you hanging from the gallows. Let them escape. Ill butcher every one of them at Runnymede. This way.! The rope- Over the parapet. Okay. Littlejohn. Littlejohn. - What is it? - Get up quick. Horses. Kings men. Aye, and on their way in. - Weve got to get out of here. - No, theress no chance. The only exit leads right to them. Were done. Were not done yet. Now, what are you doing? Theres no time. Get that window open. What? Hurry! The window. Now listen. When that pan starts smoking, you take a deep breath. Are you out of your mind? Get your knife out and be ready to defend yourself, man. - What is it? - Its phosphine oxide. Now listen. You go over to that window, you take a deep breath and hold it. And dont try to resist the soldiers. Magic! Get another breath of air. As soon as the room clears, well come back and tie them up. Come on. They escaped, Your Majesty. They went over the parapet, into the forest. - Send soldiers after them. - Shes to blame. - Throw her in the dungeon. - No! No! No! Dubois, send couriers to my garrisons. Theyre to attack Runnymede. We havent time to assemble more of my men. Well move to Kirkley Hall and get Douglas and Littlejohn. This way. Now. He was the kings courier. King john has found out where the Council of Barons is meeting. The others must have been couriers too. We must get to Kirkley Hall. We saw those soldiers tied up in the courtyard. Oh, Douglas, here is a magician. He knocked em unconscious without striking a blow. Just a little homemade nerve gas. The king is sending an army to ambush the barons at Runnymede. - Then theyve got to be warned. - Theress no time for that. Weve got to capture the king and hold him hostage to keep the peace. Thats a tall order- penetrating a castle and kidnapping a king. This isnt your fight. If you dontt join us, wellll understand. Doug. The Time Tunnel sent a homing post into the dungeon. I saw it. Tony, that could be our ticket right back home. Weve gotta find a way to get back into that dungeon. We join them. And the first chance we get, we head for the dungeon. Some of us will scale the walls... while the others attack the archers on the battlements. Were gonna be sitting ducks, climbing up those walls. Wait a minute. What we need is a smoke attack. - Smoke attack? - Right. An old navy trick. Here and here and here. Couriers have reached these three garrisons, Your Majesty. Theyre awaiting your orders to march. First Runnymede, then well catch and hang Huntington. Your Majesty, there arent enough guards to defend the castle. Engelard, we are not defending. We are attacking. Go saddle the horses. When the history of my reign is written... this will be considered my greatest achievement- How I crushed those who tried... to force me to grant the Magna Carta... and how, for all time, I made the power of the king absolute. Yes, Your Majesty. - Are you almost ready? - Yes. There it is. All right. Give us a moment to get to the side of the castle... and then begin the attack. Good luck, Robin. Aim well, lads. Begin... firing. Your Majesty.! Your Majesty.! Were surrounded by archers. Fire. Weve got to get to the king. Nows our chance to get to that homing post. Show me where it is. Here it is. Thats it. We should be traveling within a few seconds. Maybe its lost its power. Or maybe the Time Tunnel hasnt got a fix on us. Release me. Im the king. Yes, Your Majesty, Ill obey your every command- after we get to Runnymede. His Majesty King john... granting by deed in Runnymede Meadow these rights... is now respectfully desired... to impress his seal... upon this Magna Carta. I, King john... do hereby impress my seal... on this... Magna Carta. But remember- It is the king who grants you these rights. Whats the matter? My ankle- I think its broken. Maybe you just pulled a tendon. - You think you could walk on it? - I dont know. You wait here. Ill take a look. Japanese. We must be somewhere in the South Pacific - World War II. Theres no doubt about it. Look. Down! Were right in line with their target. Letss move. - You go on. Ill catch up. - Nothing doing. Just lean on me. Ill help you. I cant make it. Go on, get out of here. - Theyre laying them in right on top of us. - Are you kidding? Come on! You stay here. Ill check it out. Watch it. It may be booby-trapped. TO NICK AND SAMUEL, WHO RAISED ME TO RESPECT IMAGE AND SOUND ...NEW AUTO TRAINS WITH SLEEPER CARS... Happiness for example. Whenever he desired something... so did I. Or fame... For him. When he didn't desire anything... neither did I. In this way I didn't live without desires. For him. When he was silent... he must have been like me. I only had the desires he manifested. Excuse me. Where should I put the whiskey? Shall I change the towels? - Yes, please. What's Atlantic-Cité's population? 63,000. Maybe over 62,500. There was a big police crackdown on drivers last weekend. In Paris too. Weren't the Communists beaten here last year in the local elections? Yes. They wanted to requisition bathrooms if they won. As pretty as ever, Miss Nelson? - What are you doing here? - Let me in. - What do you want? - I have things to tell you. Like what? Not in the hallway. Okay. You wanted to talk? Talk. The Moroccan War made you a bit mean. You know... the war ended long ago for me. Yes, all that's long gone. Wars are never over. Trafalgar, Sedan, Chemin des Dames, Mers el-Kebir, Leningrad, Okinawa, Berlin, Hanoi. The name changes, but it's always the same, as you can see. What can I see? What are you doing here yourself? You're a jerk. A filthy jerk. So... what do you have to tell me? What did Richard die of? Was it really heart failure? How should I know? I read about it in Ouest-France, so I came down pronto. Right, Mr. Pronto. So you weren't here at the time. - Why me? - Listen, Mr. Typhus. If you want to talk, fine. But talk straight. I just arrived this morning. I didn't even unpack. My train got in at 8:13. I walked here from the station. I crossed the street and saw you enter the hotel. I asked for your room number and took the one next door, and I came to talk to you. Why can't we work together? We have before. Not with me. With Dick, maybe. What kind of work anyway? What kind of work? We're after the same thing. Really? No kidding! And what's that? You know very well, Paula, but you're trying to find out if I know more than you. More about what? You're a pain. I don't know a thing. He sent me a telegram three days ago. I couldn't come till yesterday. We hardly saw each other anymore. I don't even know if I still love him. But this love indebted me to him. His neighbors told me he'd been taken to the hospital in the fifth region. I understood from the article that he's already been buried. I don't know. I went down there... nothing. Now tell me things I don't know. You know it's a secret. - What secret? - Come on. Don't start that again. Never mind. I'll manage on my own. You know, in Paris, some people must be shaking at the Information and Interior ministries. Maybe even in the Cabinet. Really? You think it's serious? Yes, it's serious. Very serious, even. If we work together, do we share everything? Sure. Fine. All right. Okay. Which shoes go best with my dress? The blue or the white? - Blue. Now fiction overtakes reality. Now there's blood and mystery. Now I feel like I'm caught up in a Walt Disney movie, but with Humphrey Bogart, so it's a political movie. DR. SAMUEL KORVO AESTHETIC AUTOPSIES What'd you do to Uncle Edgar? - You his nephew? - Yes, ma'am. Don't mind me. Is he dead? I'm the person he wanted to talk to. Will you call the police? - Absolutely not. - What's your name? - David Goodis. Who's she? The girl I love. Doris Mizoguchi. We were vacationing in Paris at Uncle Edgar's invitation. How long were you in Paris? - Exactly? - Yes, exactly. How long were you in Paris? - Exactly? - Yes, exactly. Exactly... 127 years. Really? Just as I thought. You must not have seen your girlfriend often. Rarely. She lived too far away. I only saw her daily. Mornings for breakfast, midday for lunch, afternoons for tea, sometimes between tea and dinner, then for a movie or a play after dinner. She couldn't come often. She lived too far away. She lived in the suburbs. Since the suburbs aren't Paris, and Paris isn't France, she had to get a visa every time she came to see me. But couldn't you go see her? Sure, but only outside breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner. You're a real moron. If I was a moron, I wouldn't speak French. So what are you doing in Atlantic-Cité? "In this mirror I am enclosed alive and real as one imagines the angels, not like reflections." What are you writing? A novel that'll never end and that I'll call The Unfinished Novel. "Who is that actress with iris eyes so heavy and dark like a bouquet? The Japanese girl suddenly looked something like a Manet. Surely, like me, she wearied of their silly wordplays. She uses only familiar words: 'You'll miss me, honey, some of these days.' Why then this feeling of a long agony? And my life and the world? Who could ever still believe in them? She only loved the here and now And I was the color of time She spoke of elsewhere Forever elsewhere, I listened, in dreams sublime A woman is a door to the unknown halls A woman is like the triumph of naked soles Do you remember the song, the tone of that foolish carol..." I couldn't rhyme that one. "One day, alas! You'll go off, Alice, with Lewis Carroll." Thanks. Can I count on your help? Sure, if you help me too. But not a word to the police. - He still works at...? - No, they sacked him. Okay. When he comes to, tell him I vanished. Is it really you I'll find dead? O Richard. O my king. In what second-rate tragedy have you once again cast me in the final role? Luckily I was now a brunette, and Dr. Korvo didn't recognize the blond student from Agadir. Madam Nelson, I have to talk to you! You look unhappy. No luck? Wasn't that funny? - Hello, Thomas. - Hello, sir. Don't call me sir. Call me Bartender or Paul. It's easier. I'm not much older than you. Excuse me. Another shot of scotch. Coming right up, Miss Nelson. Don't call me sir. Call me Bartender or Paul. It's easier. I'm not much older than you. You are. How old are you? I'm 22. - You'll be twice that in 22 years. In 22 years I'll be 26. Not so, sir - sorry - Bartender or Paul. In 22 years she'll be 44. You're good at mental math, but she beats you in French. I'll catch up. I'm only two years older. I didn't know you were 19. 22 and 35 don't make 19. They do, except during the war. '70 and '14 added up to '40. Mind doing some arithmetic for me? All right, fella. Could you inventory the objects in my bar? - What's a bar? - Bartender! Coming! A bar... is a place... I mean, a room. I mean, it's several persons who meet under a bartender's eye. And it's also a room where liquids are served. I mean, it's both people meeting under a bartender's eye, and it's also a room - A bar can't be two things at once. Can the young lady be both a woman and a crocodile? You ask tough questions. I have to think about it. List the objects in the bar. I see a glass, bottles, a rose, windows on my right, a door that's both in front of me and behind you. You see, a thing can be in two places at once. Keep going. - A bartender. - Where's the bartender? In front of me. It's you. That's right. I didn't see myself. Keep going. An ashtray, cups, saucers, a coffee machine, three taps, a cigarette, a striped dress. And four walls that surround the bar, a floor under my feet, a worker and me, Paula, who's stuck in a desperate situation. You just throw words around. Do something with them! Like what, Bartender or Paul? What does one do with words? - Is this necessary? - I sincerely think so. I'll try to make sentences, but I don't like to. Why don't you like to? Because sentences are useless or empty words. The dictionary says so. But the dictionary also says that sentences join words together... to give them fuller meaning. - I reject your definition. - Why? Why do you reject it? Sentences can't be meaningless and have fuller meaning. Don't complicate things. If you don't talk in sentences, I can't understand you and thus serve you a drink. Then, Bartender or Paul, I'll give it a try. The glass is not in my wine. The bartender is in the pocket of the pencil's jacket. The bar gives the young lady a few kicks. The floor is stubbed out on the cigarette. The tables are on the glasses. The ceiling hangs from the lamp. The window looks into the young lady's eyes. I open them, and the door sits on the stool. The telephone has three bars. The coffee fills with vodka. The Cinzano has four walls around it... but the dictionary has only three windows: one sash window and two French windows. The doors jump out the window. The bartender fills a cigarette with his whiskey. He lights his tap. I am what you are. He is not what we are. They are what you are. I have what you have. He has what they have. They have what we don't have. - What'll you have? - If anyone asks, you don't know. Say something at least. "What's the maximum speed of love? Answer: 68 miles per hour. A mile faster and you're in a cock-up." Very well. ARMED TROOPS ARE PROTECTING CANDIDATES IN SUNDAY'S ELECTIONS... Say something at least. I'm fed up. Here's the address you wanted. Whatever I do... I can't shirk my responsibilities toward others. My silence has the same effect on him as my words. My leaving disturbs him as much as my presence. My indifference can be his undoing as much as my involvement. My sometimes rash concern... can be fatal to him. Either this life is nothing or it must be everything. By imagining that it could be lost, rather than subjected to the absurd, I place at the very center of my relative existence an absolute benchmark - that of ethics. The absolute in this sense is not elsewhere. No past justifies it. No future can promise it. I choose to exist to become increasingly present for myself, for Dick... and for others. Miss Daisy Kenyon, please report to Solarium 4. Miss Ruby Gentry, please report to the oxygenation room. This way. Calling Dr. Ludwig. Calling Dr. Edward Ludwig. Is it you? Yes, miss. Miss...? Paula Nelson. I don't do special consultations. No, I just want some information. - Are you a reporter? - Who said I was? You're from Paris? I just want to know if Dick really - If Richard P... died of heart failure. Are you his sister? We were to marry two years ago. THE BOOK OF THE IT During the events in Marseille? Why don't you answer my question? I am. Look. I have his file here. There's no mystery. Of course. Even in Treblinka and Auschwitz, people ended up dying of heart failure. What did he do before coming to Atlantic-Cité? Did you work together? Excuse me. Go right ahead. Tell Mr. Widmark the person in question did call. Why did they call you to confirm his death? Because I saw him often. We'd play tennis three times a week. I'm the club president. He was alone. I introduced him to people. He was lonely, you know. Loneliness isn't a cause of death. How can you not see the link between loneliness and physical illness? Why tell me stories? I just want the truth. You don't like telling stories. I think you're wrong. Dickens, Melville, and Hammett are better than all these new audiovisual truth-detecting methods. Weren't you the mayor's deputy until '67? The mayor was a Communist. He was killed too. An explosion in a gas depot. The Communist utopia is no longer the revolutionary utopia of 40 years ago. You're sure he had no family? They should be informed. He had only me. I'll avenge him. I don't understand you. In that case, let's stop DICK-ing around with this ri-DICK-ulous nonsense. I understood very quickly. This affair had to remain murky for everyone, and my life was on the line. But maybe, too, I'd come across something that I could then sell to the opposition press. To recover Richard's things, I went back late that afternoon to the address I'd been given. It was once again the kind of day for taking out a camera and making a color movie. An anonymous voice had given me the address of a garage. I thought I'd recognized the northern accent of a typist he'd run off with. Where am I? I'm crossing countries drenched in blood. War is war... whether you call it that or not. War. And life - has it ever been anything but war? To kill less than in a war - is that the law in life? Where am I? Why was I told he was in the military hospital? Who gave you the address of this garage? Someone from around here. And I remembered his fondness for cars. And I saw his Alfa. That idiot Donald! I told him to torch it. - Was it after the elections? - Maybe. You killed him. What makes you think that? The corpse at that doctor's office, Dr. - Korvo? I don't know anything about it. You can fool the movie audience, but not me. Why do you want to avenge P...? This may surprise you, but out of idealism. Ah, right. I remember an editorial... where he wrote that fascism was the dollar of ethics. What did they do to him? It's the other way around: It was Dr. Korvo who informed Ludwig that you'd come by. How'd you get to Atlantic-Cité so fast? - Who slugged me? - I do the questioning here. Then do the answering too. He'd kept evidence about the mayor's death. It had to vanish. Something new, criminally speaking. It was worse here than Marseille or Chicago. You know, I'm in charge of planning for all of Region 5. If you kill me, you won't learn a thing. Your theory doesn't hold water. The main thing is to find out if you know where it is. I tell her I know exactly what she's looking for. She'd heard that P... was dead and thought that once here, it would all be easy. And I tell him it's all Chinese to me. Cold. Colder. Freezing. The South Pole. Still the South Pole. Still the South Pole. Still the South Pole. Warming up. Warmer. Crossing the Equator. The Sahara. Starting to burn. Burning. Burning. Let's listen to it. Paragraph 3. Permanent revolution only has meaning if the diversity and seriousness of the politico-economic team allows us to surmount the hazards of the situation. Paragraph 7. What Robespierre and St. Just had glimpsed empirically as part of a program - What Robespierre and St. Just had glimpsed empirically as part of a program that remained to be defined, but whose surprising topicality still amazes... others have drafted. I am one of them, and you shouldn't blame us, comrades. Paragraph 12. As colonial independence in the interim checks the fascist evolution of the regime, domestic conquest and the struggle for the presidency should open a new field of club activity. I've changed my mind. Why did I go to Dr. Korvo's? And why did I go to the military solarium? And without any risk. You know, I could kill you right now. Here I am in my dark suit and bright tie. I tell her I still have a lot of friends in Paris who will be back in power someday. To be classified. We asked a nation to base its opinion not on adversarial analysis within public opinion, or on the study of hard evidence, but on what certain officials have chosen to leak from secret archives. Such methods, comrades - Let me start again. We asked a nation to base its opinion not on adversarial analysis within public opinion, or on the study of hard evidence, but on what certain officials have chosen to leak from secret archives. Such methods, comrades, epitomize a police state. Looking at the two of them, I suddenly understood the adjective "parallel" as applied to the police. The inspector looked like a political science graduate. He shouted at me to beware of those Regional Planning people. Dick had no secrets. He was a liar. I knew him well. Someone killed Typhus. It wasn't you or me. It proves someone's after the same thing we are. Help me. I'll do the same. We'll share. - Why does the cock flatter the cuckoo? - I don't get it. Because the cuckoo flatters the cock. Mr. Khrushchev's speech to the Komsomol. I'm sure you killed Dick. Why? I don't know yet. It doesn't hold water. It does too hold water. You'll see. - Then it was you. - You're a pain. - Not exactly. - I don't get it. Let's just say there were several of us. But what if I went ahead and told them what I know and what I guess. You wouldn't. Right now, he thinks that you killed Typhus. I'm the only one who knows I was with you at the time. He doesn't look so mean for a homicide detective. His parents fought mine at Dakar and Mers el-Kebir. They worked for the French Gestapo. Mine worked in London for Colonel Passy. You know we called him, "I tawt I taw a 'Passy' tat!" I'm coming. I'll take her. Be right back. You absolutely must... Paris. That's enough! I can't tell you just how much I hate the police. It was her. She killed Uncle Edgar. - I recognize her. - He's nuts! I said to wait outside. Take him away. It was her. I can't tell you just how much I hate the police. Unless I'm mistaken, Mr. Typhus had business dealings with you. Not with me. You're wrong. Am I? That's what I'd been led to understand. So in fact your relations with Mr. Typhus were purely friendly. Let's just say we'd met a few times. I see. I can't tell you just how much... - Yes? - I hate the police. I'm from Atlantic-Cité Magazine. Wasn't Mr. Typhus an ex-lieutenant of Jo Atilla's? No comment. Same old story. Why do the Paris police snub the provincial press? And you, miss - anything to say? You knew Richard P... well. No comment either. 25 Ben Hecht Street. He worked there three months, from January 25 to April 25. That all? - Yes. Wait in the Peugeot. Secret? What secret? Richard P... died a natural death. Suicide at worst. Suicide by shooting himself in the back of the neck? I'm new, but it's not the first time. I asked her real name. Marie Dufour. Was she the one who called me? Why? I told her not to be afraid. Because I'd tried to kill myself. Why kill yourself? Was it long after Richard's death? Or because they tortured you? With a razor blade. Richard told you something. They tortured you to find out what. With a razor blade. What did he tell you? Afraid they'll come back if you talk to me? Yes, I am. LIBERTY Excuse me, mister. I'm the sister of Richard P... He worked here in February or March. Did he leave a letter or package for me? I wouldn't know. What is it? I just heard you mention Richard P... I overheard you from the accounting office. They're scared. They doubled our pay to keep us quiet. But Mr. P... was very nice to me. He was the only one. He once asked me to come to his home to check the books in a villa outside Atlantic-Cité. Where? Near the military airfield. Preminger Street. Something like that. That's all I know. Well, well. Find anything? - No more than you. - What makes you say that? You'd either leave me in peace or get rid of me. I think Inspector Aldrich is smarter. Ever think about what would happen if he's the first to learn who killed Typhus? He takes himself too seriously. He gives me a pain. But I have to find a way. He say what he thought of me? Why the hell should I care? I'm in charge of the fifth region, not him. Right? Sure you are. Sure. What did you tell him? Tell who? David Goodis. When Aldrich questioned him the second time, he got nothing out of him. He said there'd been a mix-up... that you resembled someone else... that he'd never seen you with his uncle. What did you tell him? Nothing. Well, I've been thinking. Whoever killed Typhus is probably the same person who slugged you. I know it sounds crazy, but it proves he didn't find anything either. - And Dr. Ludwig? - What? Maybe it was him. I don't get it. I don't get it. Why wouldn't he be involved? Sure. Like you, he's a priceless hostage for me. You really think so? You still don't think Richard was just a dreamer? Have you ever seen a Communist dreamer? He was expelled from the party when Picasso died. A charade, a charade. What? You fell for it, like everyone else. The MP who'd lent him his Citroën had taken it back for the weekend, so Widmark drove me back in his killers' Chrysler to the hotel, threatening to kill me if I went out, since I refused to tell him where the villa was. THE ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR... WHICH FOR US WILL BE... GARDENS OF ARMIDA... EIFFEL TOWER... DID YOU.... Next: As the police still suspected me, which is how Widmark could hold me, I called him back and gave him the name of a guy who, in my opinion and in his, could very well have killed Typhus. Paragraph 19. Yes, comrades, times have changed. But I say that the lies remain, among those whom you know well, those who feel a threat to their social influence patriotism. The current government uses patriotic speeches and glorification of the nuclear adventure as a diversion from the rise of worker and social issues. Paragraph 47. Dumouriez had denounced this penchant for sublime parry being used by the Right today, which gives the masses the facile emotion of courage without risk and pride without sacrifice. Politics. Money. How can I not feel like puking after being mixed up in all that for so long? Oh, Richard. Paragraph 48. How is it, I will be asked with eloquent outrage, that French policy aims to relieve us of this enormous power, and yet a fraction - a faction of our power will have contributed to such crimes? My answer to that, comrades, to Louis and Benoit: It's not the first time power has been divided, that a court could be Catholic and Protestant. And Danton? Dumouriez? Would it be the first time policy swung Left and Right, torn between the demands of a Grand Old Man - Would it be the first time policy swung Left and Right, torn between the sublime demands of a Grand Old Man capable of imposing them on his nation at the expense of food and the interests of his heirs, who know they can only control the people by fattening them up? Paragraph 89. The main reason for these errors is that men claiming to be of the Left continue to accept Communist votes even as they form alliances with reactionary forces. I ask you, comrades: What progress can there be with Lecanuet, Pinay, Pleven, who claim that without an anti-American stance, nothing would separate our policies from theirs? How can we seek the defeat of the current government when it could only lead to the following results: either the survival of Gaullism, even if the UNR loses its majority in the next National Assembly, or a lasting discredit to the democratic regime if power returns to a majority that includes part of the non-Communist Left and those so-called progressive republicans. It's to bar the way - It's to bar the way, comrades - It's to bar the way, comrades, to such an alternative that the French Communist Party will pursue its efforts for the true victory of the Left. This is probably the fear of the anti-Communist factions. They don't want the victory of the Left. This is probably - Just as I thought. To get back at his boss, who didn't want him anymore, young Donald brought me photos of Richard's death. Yes, we were in a political movie, meaning Walt Disney with blood. He also told me he'd childishly killed Typhus and his niece. They'd caught him searching my room. He was looking for a treasure, but now he was scared. He didn't believe in any secret file or political mystery - just money. He confirmed that there was a villa and offered to take me there for two million old francs. He wanted it to flee to South America, where, in his own idealistic way, he'd help finance a mercenary army to eliminate Jews, blacks, Chinese and Indians. If you had to die... would you rather be warned or die suddenly? Die suddenly! Mama! Mama! This is probably the fear of the anti-Communist factions. Finding out why Richard died was to find out why I should stay alive. "He remembers... a lock of brown hair." Not helping me anymore? Sure I am. "He remembers to the point of disbelief..." And then? - Scram! The police! - Help me, ma'am. "...our two strange destinies." At the villa in an hour! You can leave Atlantic-Cité. Really? Thanks. I'm off the Typhus case. Really? Same old story. I just had orders from Paris to suspend the investigation. That shouldn't surprise you. I don't care. Was the wrong man your idea? What wrong man? According to Widmark, it was a certain... Mark Dixon, a private detective, who killed Typhus. It's plausible. A feud between two Moroccan War veterans. Did you arrest this Mr. Mark Dixon? Not yet. I'll try. I doubt I can. Why not? He's already dead. A fire near Agadir. Then how will you arrest him? I don't get it. He'll be sentenced in absentia. Officially no one knows he's dead, except for two people. I'm one, but only by chance. I was engaged to his sister. And one other person - Mr. Widmark? Not Widmark. A young woman in a pretty dress. Just like yours, in fact. What color is it? Orange or yellow? None of your business, since the case is closed. I know. You suspected me? It would be an exaggeration to say I did, but it was a possibility. He was killed in your room, so you let him in. No, he may have been after something, something to steal. Were you in the same hotel by chance? Were you supposed to meet him? I didn't expect to run into Typhus. I'd read in Ouest-France that my friend, Richard P..., was dead. So I came here. So did he, I think. Who'd you vote for two years ago? None of your business. I can easily find out. You were working for L'Express a bit earlier, in '66. Yes. What if I was? No, nothing. This Richard P... was the same one who wrote the editorials? Yes. He stayed on. I quit when... the Havas Agency. Why? I think advertising is a form of fascism. I got wary when Goodis went back on his declarations. I'm not as stupid as you think. You're probably mixed up in something political that also involves personal feelings: revenge, jealousy, friendship. I'd go back to Paris if I were you. Things are going to get ugly here. I'm telling you for your own sake. You know, we live in a part of the universe that's already old, where nothing much happens, whereas elsewhere, explosions are forging new galaxies. So long. KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE Silence! You'll get everyone in trouble. I don't buy it. Tell Ludwig I'll call him tonight. Okay, but this is the last time. - What's your name? - Robert McNamara. - Aren't you tired of all this killing? - It's my job. It makes me happy. And you? I'm Richard Nixon. I feel the same way. Let's go see your boss, since you're watching me. - I don't know where he is. - I know. Take off! I still have my yellow-and-red dress, but my voice has off? You said it's stupid. But it's so stupid, it's funny! It's not funny! What would you do if a friend had a terminal cancer? Tell him to rest in peace! You're cold blooded! What else can I do? Sit there and watch him. I don't know anymore, I think it must be horrible. Especially cancer, so frightening. One day 70 kg, like me now. Only half as much when death finally comes. And so smelly. Of course! The internal organs rot away. You knew so much about medicine. Also, cancer. Makes a hole here, a hole there! Dying is trivial. But the suffering! Especially lung cancer. Can't even breathe. Choke choke dead. And such bad breath. Right, nurse? And the body shrives up. Have to straighten up the body at the funeral. I've seen some really bad cases. Face flesh fall off, relatives can't recognize. Dreadful! Enough! Stop it! I have to go wee-wee! Don't mind him! Continue your dinner! Your are a good nurse, open wide! You can go home now. But doctor, I ache all over! That's right! He can't even eat dinner! If you treat me the same way, I'd also say the same thing. Okay, check out! But, doctor, I'm in pain! Doc don't believe him. He's faking. He's just after the nurse. Because his wife is out of town. He's on the prowl You See! Why you! OK! If you can attack him. You're well enough to go home! Don't waste the taxpayers money! You have 15 minutes to leave! What are you hanging around for? Let's go home and rest. Wow! What a nice kitchen! Oh boy, candy! Try some! It's good! Then I'll show you your room! Ah Chow, where are you going? To take a bath. I'll draw your water for you. No need! Be careful! What's the matter? The door is locked. Security precaution. Keep away burglars. Watch! Open sesame! Not bad! A bit of a mess, though! What's this? Funny mirror! Cloth dryer! Tidying up doesn't mean it's clean! See? An ant! A little insecticide will fix that. Anymore complaints? Is this K-7390068? Yes, who do you want to speak to? Who are you? Who are you? You are calling me! Tell Ah Chow to come to the phone! He's busy! Busy. Doing what? Taking a bath! Close the door, will you? He's taking a bath without closing the door? Fogging up the whole house! I have to keep an eye on you. Relax. You can't get rid of me that easily. Can you call later? What's your relationship to Ah Chow? I can't tell you. What are you two up to? Nothing. Just getting ready to go to bed! Call back later, will you? No need, just tell Ah Chow. To watch out! Who was it? A woman, asking for Ah Chow! Must be Anna. What did he say? Nothing, I told her Ah Chow was taking a bath. Because it's bedtime. What did she say? She said to tell Ah Chow to watch out? Then she hung up. She sounded angry! Was it Anna? Yes, she goodnight, everybody! What did Anna say? She said she loves you and She'll show you how much when she return. Now don't kid around, otherwise I'm dead. No, don't say that! You'll be around for a long time. Anna said she'll take you on vacation. When she comes back. Relax? With her hanging around? Can't even die peacefully! Don't say that. Now go to sleep. Goodnight! Goodnight! I have to help him enjoy his last few months. Any good tours? Oh, no! Ah Chow, you can't die! Up, up, down, down have you still moonlighting for the travel agent? Not so loud! Got some business for you. Where do you want to go? Two week tour in Asia, around $1000. $1000 will get you a tour around town. Stop kidding, where do you want to go? Philippines! I heard he had great Sunday Rallies. When can one depart? As soon as I see the money. When do you want to go? As soon as possible! And don't let Ah Chow know. Don't tell anyone. I should know. I'm the one moonlighting. Another thing, I want your opinion. Since you are the oldest here. I mean the most experienced. That's right! 30 years in the force. Out lasted four superintendents. First one retired, second one jailed. Third one died, fourth one quit. If you suddenly dropped dead. Such compensation would the government for. Why should I drop that, why not you. I said "if" If you dropped dead, you'd get mutual assistance fund, insurance, funeral fund. All together, added up to quite a bit how much is that. More than the retirement fund. Enough for widows and children to leave ahead. Why? Planning for the future! Don't you know. A cemetery agent? Yes! Why? I want to look into corruption in his file. Help me Page him! OK! Diddling time! Ah Chow's not here yet I'll bid for him. He asked me to. This weakly "Brotherly loan" scheme is gift. Highest bid on interest gets the loan. I need the loan this week. I bid $48. Let's see. Horsey $5. Don't you need the loan, Horsey? Why do I need a loan? It's off-season for horse-racing. I only expense its cigarettes. Freddie $50. Hey! You said $45 when I hypnotized you. It stuff works, would you still be pushing. No fair...! Stop! Let's look at mine! $52! I've been misled no fair! Stop! Last bid! Ah Chow bids $100. $100? Hand it over! Here's my $100. Mine! Thanks! Ah Chow, you must really me desperate. Paying $100 interest for a $600 loan. $100? How else and I be sure of a sure win? But $100 is a lot of interest! You don't have to pay it! I'll pay it for you! That's different. Hey ... We're friends, aren't we? I have a dig day tonight. Can you lend me the money? Big deal! Ah Chow has a dig day too! You run along. Go enjoy yourself. Leave everything to me! Ah Chow, I'm warning you! If you go out while on duty, I'll report Abort the report, shorty! You make a lot of personal calls on duty. I can report you also. Ah Chow, you run along! To where? Anywhere, just have a good time. For you! May, you stay with me! How many, sir? Please! This is very good styling! How about the interior? Great use of space. Any brighter units? Then this is for you bright and breezy. Eat you ice-cream! What kind of decor? Decor? Contemporary! Beautiful surroundings! Can't be too cramped? Right! Won't do if it's too cramped. Well, you can combine two units together. You're bachelor. It should be really enough. What do you know? So you're buying a house, big deal! Eat your heart out! Don't mind her. Hows the location? Beautiful scenery! Mountains and oceans view. I wouldn't steer you wrong. But it could get lonely. Right. You need a clear location but near people. How about happy valley? Convenient for visitors! Happy valley? It gets awfully noisy on race days. No problem. Our construction is designed So that every unit is sound proof. How about pedestrian traffic? We have good security! 24 hours a day! Sounds good! Why are you so excited? You're right. You're one moving. How about her neighbours? Keep to themselves. Who are they? How do you expect him to know? It's best if there are some female neighbor. Might get lonely! Doesn't have to be female, does it? I can't guarantee the labors will be female. But I'll try to arrange it! About the price Money is no problem. But one condition. Don't let Ah Chow know. Or he'll get upset! Well? I can't decide, can I take this home? Here, take this one. Contents are the same! Waiter, check! It's getting very dramatic. This shot will decide the winner. Have some tea! Turn this thing off! So noisy You I'll serve dinner! I ate already. Have some soup then! This is my house. If I want soup, I'll help myself. Why are you so rude? Be quiet! He's right. It's his house. I always share everything with you. But it seems like generosity is one way. But I shouldn't lose your apron without asking you. No problem. Help yourself. You won't be doing it for much longer. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about! Mountain and ocean view. Beautiful surroundings. Let me have one month notice before you move. Who says I'm moving? You're planning to move. I've seen some petty people. But you take the cake. It's hard to take! Don't you want Beethoven to Leave more comfortably? Kids shouldn't meddle. I'm just trying to help. No need. We're OK. You are OK? He's picking on you. But you stand all the time making soup just for him. If I were you, I'd add poison in the soup. Who are you? Cinderella's step-mother? Just mind your own business. But he's bullying you! May I be struck dead if I break this promise. Don't say that! I'm losing one friend already! Take another kind of oath! How else can I prove my sincerity? Swear you'll give up disco. I, May Lo, do solemnly swear that if I let out that Ah Chow has lung cancer May I never said food into another disco so you were talking about cemeteries. With that man! Yes, Ah Chow is No good at handing these things. Don't put him at Morrison Hill, too far. Nearer, we can visit more of-ten. I won't cremate him. He's so afraid of fire! He doesn't even barbecue. Ah Chow, in my mind, I've told you to drop to hell. But I don't mean it! Don't die! Let's go back out! Otherwise, he'll suspect! Ah Chow! Who won. Why do you have that on? So I can hear better. What's the matter? Here have some tea! He's sensitive because his dad coughed to die. I'll close the window. Help...! Damn! My gun is inside the room. I'll get mine! Help...! Hold on May, I'm coming! Take this! You OK? Just practicing my tumbling! Well, you carry on, I'm go help May! No matter what happens, don't come out. Freeze! Shoot him! Careful! Sorry, I didn't mean it! I'm OK!

At least wait until Anna comes back! He's coming back tomorrow. You can die tomorrow. Who's dying? Can't guy faint once in a life. Help tidy up! We get Lee Hong to court, Escort May Lo to testify against him. And our job is complete. Where's May Lo? Beethoven and Ah Chow is keeping an eye on her. At your house! He's just a little kid. The phone call what phone call? Oh, nothing! What is it? Nothing, really! They should be here soon. Let go take a look. OK! Why are you all standing here for? Dinner that phone call I know already. You're May Lo? Yes! I have some questions to ask you! Sir, I have something to discuss with you. I have to take her statement. Why are you bagging along? No reason! If you have business to discuss with me. But save private matters for home. Is private! Sorry, madam! Are you PC2020, Ng Ah Chow? Yes! I must apologize about the computer error. Really sorry! What computer error? The computer went haywire. And reported you had lung cancer. Actually you don't! What? Is a mistake. You don't have lung cancer. Please sir, please! But I can't let him go on leave now. I know it's unreasonable. But please, sir! Stop it! Attention! I won't "attention". Please sign here, sir. Out! I won't go out until you sign! Please sign! I give up! Thanks, sir! Bless you! May your dog give birth to a thousand puppies. Do you have it? Where's the money? 2-weeks southeast-Asia tour. Airfare, hotel, meals, all included. Enjoy yourself! I've helped you applied for a leave! Leave? What am I gonna do? Stay at home. No, take a tour of southeast Asia. It's free! I won a raffle! Southeast Asia? Hawaii would be better. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii. Hawaii is OK! Just add $400. That's a good deal. But but what? Spending money. I'll have to save a few years first! No, the price includes spending money. How much? $3000! No. $5000! No. $7000! That's more like it! But I can't just leave Anna by herself. Oh, I also won next year's raffle. I'll use each this year so Anna can go. Will she agree to go? Leave it to me! By the way, is the spending money in US dollars? Yes US dollars! Okay, I'll go! It's not $400. it's $4000. Not US dollars is it? How did you guess? Hand over the money. Not so loud! Give me the money and I"ll show you how quiet. If Anna knows about Ah Chow's conditions. She'll surely go on vacation with him. But I don't think it's good to let her know. Might upset her. And the baby. What baby? The one they might have on the second honeymoon. I hope they have a son To carry on the family name. Yeah! Ah Chow Will it work? Of course, now go change! Go I guarantee once Anna see you. She'll want to go to Hawaii. Hi, Anna, back already? Yes! Hi, Anna! Aloha! Aloha means welcome in Hawaiian. What are you two up to? Hi, honey! Aloha! Like it. Honey? What is it? Are Hawaiian shirt? Very nice. Give me a hand! Have to finish this tonight. I'll go get my slippers. No reaction yet! Ah Chow! What's the matter, honey. What's all this? Where did you steal this forest from? Doesn't this look like Hawaii? Stroll along palm trees, Hula cancers. Wouldn't it be night to go with Ah Chow! No time! Too much work to do. At least we have this Hawaiian scenery. We'll have to stroll here! Back to work! Anna, try my pina colada! I made it just for you. Thanks! Anna, don't bypass this opportunity. What opportunity? Help me copy this. Ah Chow Won a Baby Formula Drinking Contest. The price is a 2-week Hawaiian Tour for two. Right? Right. After all this years. I don't release how much I miss the taste of milk. I wish I'd joined. I don't know what you're up to. But I don't have the time. The work can wait. But the vacation the vacation can wait. What's so good about Hawaii? Actually, I don't feel like going either. All people talk about are the beautiful beach. Besides strolling on the beach at sunset. Warm gentle breeze blowing in your face. People also rave about the Huia dancers. Hips gently swaying to the relaxing music. That's nothing special about Hawaii. Sure, there hospitality is know-worldwide. Besides that, that's nothing but good shopping. And who cares about shopping, right? Honey. Oh, no use talking about it. My mind is mature. I guess you'll have to go. Beethoven. I guess I'll have to wait! Right? Right, no! No right! Better tell Anna the truth. Do I have to? Yes! OK! Anna, can I talk to you? Come inside! It's nothing what are they talking about? Idle talk probably! Idle talk? Why can't they talk here? Maybe is about the birds and the bees He just look a bit serious. I've never seen him like that before. Ah Chow! We're going to Hawaii! Do we have to, honey? Yes, we have to! How did it happen? A fly! A fly? Yes, a fly flew into the computer. And threw it off key. It's this fly here, sir! Really? This fly? Doesn't seem like this one to me. Yes, sir. This is the fly. All flies look the same. How do you know this not the one? Exactly. If you know all flies look all the same. Why did you bring the germ-infected thing to me. Come in! Sir, Ah Chow is starting his vacation. I'm returning his gun. Put it here! So now what? The computer is out. Damn the computer, what I mean is Sir Am I disrupting? No! Let me go instead. Sit down. I haven't finished! Did anyone suffer inconvenience. Because of this incident? Let's see yes or no? Two people, Tsui Kwai. And Ng Ah Chow! Tsui himself spotted the error. For Ng, the computer said he had lung cancer. But I notified him of the error! You mean Ah Chow knows he doesn't have cancer? Yes! Well. I'm off to get darken! Remember to bring me some pineapples! OK! No need to strife us! I've arranged for a car to drive May to court. OK, see you when I get back. Don't move or I'll plug you with lead. Ah Chow doesn't look very happy! He probably misses us. Hi! Follow them! Tell them to stop and get in your car. Stop get in my car! No need. You run along! I don't care how you do it. Just get them to follow you to the car park. Otherwise you are dead! OK, anyway I choose, right? There's a gun pointed at me. He want you to follow me to the car park. You two are crazy, always fooling around. He might not come, he thinks I'm kidding shut up! Shut up! What are you doing? Stop playing around tell him to come over. OK, game's over! You're asking for it! Game's not over until I say so. See, here he comes. OK. then come over here. Why not? Come here if you dare! Careful, buddy! Can't you do something right just once? Maybe next time! Tell the girl to come over. Fast! May, come here! Stop playing around. I'm not coming over! Let's get going. She won't come, I'll go get her! May, drive away fast! Run him down! Watch my legs, will you? Chase after him! Ram him, in his behind. Christ! You OK? Take this! Ah Chow! No...! Don't move! Give me the girl. Or I'll stab him. Put down the wood! Let's talk things over! Let him stab me to death. No...! Listen. Mr. assassin, sir. You let him go and we forget this incidence. No grudges, OK? Did I scramble your brain at first I'm counting to three. Send the girl over. Don't please, after all, we've met before. It was nice of you to drop in the other night. One! No, not one. Don't send May over! I'd rather die! Two! No fair, I wasn't ready Start from one again. You hear him. It's two soon. It's three. Think about now I'll look with that thing struck. Don't blink, you might miss my dying breath. Wait! I can't send May over! But take me hostage instead. Don't you speak up earlier? It's tiring standing here. Beethoven! He pretty determine. And maybe he knows about he has cancer. And wants to die in the line of duty. Let's help him fulfill his wish. Three! Ah Chow! Ah Chow! Anna, darling! Stay back or he's dead! Ah Chow! Talk to Ah Chow. He is very reckless, acts like he want to die. Maybe he knows he has cancer. And is ready to sacrifice himself. Ah Chow. Take it easy! Just because you have cancer. It's better than being dead. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes. I have nothing to leave you when I die. Except for the strength of my character. Buddy, make your move! Ah Chow, I'll always cherish your character. You can go in peace, I'll never forget you. I'll stay a widow in your remembrance. Honey! If I remarry, he'll be another Sammy like you. That way, the kiss will look like you. See you in heaven, let's wrap, man. Honey, I don't want to die! Why not? Because because Because of what? Because I don't have cancer! I don't believe you, no need to comfort me. It is the truth, I knew about the computer error. I kept up the facade to take advantage of Beethoven. OK. you said it! Yes stop where you are! I'm talking to my husband, none of your business! Freeze! Let's go! Good going, honey! Are we still going to Hawaii? Ah Chow! Beethoven! I was just playing a joke on you! No harm done, right? Right, no harm done! Let's go! 1,2,3! Take this! Stop. - You, go check over there - Go... - See anything? - No. They're back here. Follow them. Over there... Cousin, you better leave without me. No. We'll go together. This is H.K. already. Hurry, go. I've made the call but I can't find your aunt. You're a stranger in H.K., stay with me. Scared? Let me take it out for you. Don't be scared... You are incurable. Do you have a sound reason for being transferred eleven times... within only one year after you left the cadet? You are like a human football. Did you hear what I said? What? If it's not because we're relatives. I'll never let you work in my district. Mom, I know. He's here. Phone call for you... Uncle, there's a phone call for you. - Sister, What is it? - Watch out for my hat. Don't interrupt when your elders are talking. I'm talking to your mother. I won't be coming. I'm being bored to death by your son here. Nothing you can do can amend it. I'll tell him. All right, bye. What did mom say? Don't soak your "athlete's foot" in the tub. Your son caught the bacteria on his scalp. It's a good thing it didn't go into his eyes. Or else he'll have "athlete's eyes" Shut your mouth. I have all the experienced C.l.D. here. Choose one as your partner. No. I can't stand experienced cops. They'll be on my back constantly. Just get me a lazy one. But one not as handsome as I am. That will be hard to find. This one is the worst, How about it? Good morning. Judy, you can go now. No, I want to see you go in. Fine. - Morning. - Morning. Bon, all dressed up for a modeling job? Yes. Playboy asks me to pose for their cover. Can't you be serious? I didn't say anything wrong. Don't you want me as a model for your company? Resign? What's wrong with being a cop? If something happens to your family, you can be sure I'll work hard on the case. If you want to marry with me, you must quit. Then, we'll just live together. No. I've typed up your resignation letter. How smart. There's a typing error. More. - You're great. - Let's go. 2993, you can't come and go as you please. Being a model beats being a policeman? Police are respected. Have you heard of models are respected? So I want to be a policeman. I've transferred a top man to assist you. Tell 23838 to come in. When you see him, you may think I'm lying. Oh boy, you eat it so well. Oh, how good you eat it. Yes, suck it like that. Oh, slut. You big slut. Have a banana, my darling. At last! At last I had felt, in the deepest of my insides that delicious juice simultaneously hot and refreshing. From now on, my partner and I, will share in equal parts, the delights of love. And for many years to come. LENINGRAD COWBOYS PRESENTS ROCKY VI IGOR I have a dream... I have a dream... Free world! ROCKY You want money, you want sex... You want violence, whaddya want next?

[APPLAUSE] [RING] I'M AFRAID THE SCHEDULE IS A LITTLE CRAMPED TODAY, YOUR HOLINESS. YOU SAY THAT TO ME EVERY DAY, FRANCESCO. YOU FIND A DIFFERENT WAY OF SAYING IT, BUT BASICALLY, THE MESSAGE IS THE SAME. YOUR HOLINESS, TODAY WE HAVE A MEETING WITH MEMBERS OF THE VATICAN BANK, SEVEN GROUPS FOR BLESSINGS, THREE PRIVATE AUDIENCES, A GENERAL AUDIENCE WITH MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY. A FORMAL AUDIENCE WITH THE AMBASSADOR FROM, UH... BRAZIL. YES, BRAZIL. WE HAVE THE ITALIAN SOCCER TEAM. THEY'RE IN THE FINALS OF THE WORLD CUP AGAINST BRAZIL. IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I BLESS THEM, OR WOULD THAT SET OFF AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT? TALKS IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAVE BROKEN DOWN AGAIN, AND A MONSOON FLOOD IN THE PHILIPPINES HAS LEFT 20,000 HOMELESS. THE POLISH GOVERNMENT'S DISTRIBUTING TWO OF YOUR SPEECHES FROM AFRICA, RE-EDITED WITH A MARXIST SLANT, OF COURSE. FRENCH COMMUNISTS WANT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE FINANCES OF CARDINAL MEDINE. ALSO, TWO MISSIONARIES WERE KILLED IN GUATEMALA. WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE DETAILS, BUT APPARENTLY GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE DESTROYED THE VILLAGES THEY WERE WORKING IN. WE ARE PREPARING A STATEMENT AND SETTING UP A FUND FOR THE FAMILIES. I WILL WRITE THE STATEMENT. MYSELF. THE ITALIAN SOCCER TEAM, YOUR HOLINESS. IN NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI.

WHY CAN'T YOU MAKE A MIRACLE? YOUR HOLINESS... FRANCESCO, CALL ME SOMETHING OTHER THAN "YOUR HOLINESS." EVERYONE ELSE CALLS YOU "YOUR HOLINESS." THEY DON'T ADDRESS ME 50 TIMES A DAY. VERY WELL, YOUR HOLINESS. THANK YOU. [ALARM] OUR NEW SECURITY SYSTEM. IS HIS HOLINESS CARRYING ANY METAL? AH, YES. THE VATICAN BANK IS ATTRACTING TOO FEW DEPOSITORS. WE FEEL THE SITUATION MIGHT BE IMPROVED BY OFFERING CERTAIN ENTICEMENTS. ENTICEMENTS? LIKE IN AMERICAN BANKS, YOUR HOLINESS. SMALL DEPOSITORS MIGHT GET A CALENDAR WITH YOUR PICTURE. MEDIUM-LEVEL DEPOSITORS, A SPECIAL TOUR OF THE VATICAN. WHAT DO WE GIVE THE HIGH-LEVEL DEPOSITORS? A SAINTHOOD? WELL, UH, SOMEONE... PROPOSED, UH... LOCKS OF YOUR HAIR IN PLASTIC.

IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE. LET'S GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT. YES, YES, YOUR, YOUR... DID YOU THINK HE HEARD? NO. UH... "YOUR MEDIOCRENESS" IS TOO LONG. ANY RESPONSE YET FROM VIENNA? BISHOP VON SYLT IS REFUSING TO FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES SET FOR MASS BY VATICAN II. HE'S CALLING IT A BASTARD RITE, THE WORK OF THE DEVIL. SOME SISTERS IN AMERICA ARE THREATENING TO LEAVE THE CHURCH UNLESS THEY CAN BECOME PRIESTS.

I SOMETIMES WONDER IF ANYTHING I SAY OR DO HAS ANY EFFECT OUTSIDE THESE WALLS. THAT ISN'T FOR YOU TO DECIDE, LEO. YOU ARE LOVED AND RESPECTED BY MILLIONS. YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO. WHEN I WAS A PRIEST, I COULD SEE THE RESULTS OF MY WORK. NOW I'M THE POPE, BUT I'M NO LONGER A PRIEST. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO BE BOTH.

WHAT PROFESSION? YOU'RE THE POPE. YES. AND YOU HAVE EXACTLY YOUR IDEA OF WHAT THE POPE IS, BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO REALIZE A POPE CAN BE ANYTHING, EVEN A TRAMP WHO COMES TO A DESERTED VILLAGE TO HELP NEGLECTED PEOPLE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECT THE POPE TO BE. IN WHATEVER WAY, THE PRACTICE IS THE SAME-- HMM? TO INTERFERE AND TO RULE. MAY I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? COULD I JUST TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? I WAS, UM... LOOKING AT THE AQUEDUCT. I THINK IT COULD BE REBUILT. YOU COULD GET SOME WATER BACK INTO THE HILLS. BETTER THAN TO GO INTO RIGIO TO WORK IN THE DUMP. YES, BUT HOW? THERE'S A LOT OF TIMBER DOWN THERE JUST LYING AROUND. THE TROUGH IS BROKEN. THERE'S ENOUGH WOOD IN THE VILLAGE TO REPAIR THE TROUGH. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? WE CAN FIND A WAY TO TURN THE WHEEL. VERY GOOD IDEA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD IDEA. HEY, GET ME OUT OF HERE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE NET? COME ON. GET OUT. UH-OH. WE BETTER GO. I ALREADY SOLD YOUR STINKING CROSS.

AND THAT THING YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD? DO YOU KNOW THE WHOLE VILLAGE IS LAUGHING AT YOU. IT'S GOING TO BE AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM. YOU GET TO MIX CEMENT, YOU COULD DO SOME DIGGING-- I DON'T DO THAT KIND OF STUFF. BUT I WOULD TEACH YOU. I THINK YOU COULD BE GOOD AT IT. YOU CAN EXECUTE ME RIGHT HERE! I'M NOT GONNA DO NO DIGGING! BUT, GIULIANO, YOU OWE ME A FAVOR. WHAT FAVOR? I DIDN'T TURN YOU IN FOR TAKING THE CROSS. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SHOW UP? I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. I DIDN'T GIVE YOU MY WORD. I'LL TAKE IT ANYWAY. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. YOU CAN KEEP THE CROSS, GIULIANO. I GIVE IT TO YOU WITH PLEASURE. BRING THE PULLEYS. GET ME OUT OF HERE! AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE, SIX WEEKS PRIOR TO THE POPE'S WIDELY ANTICIPATED EASTER ADDRESS, RUMORS CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE IN ROME CONCERNING THE CONDITION OF POPE LEO XIV. ALTHOUGH THE VATICAN INSISTS HE IS SUFFERING ONLY A MINOR INDISPOSITION, THE POPE'S FAILURE TO APPEAR IN PUBLIC FOR FIVE DAYS HAS GIVEN RISE TO SPECULATION THAT HE IS SERIOUSLY ILL. PRESSURE IS MOUNTING FOR MORE COMPLETE DISCLOSURE BY THE VATICAN MEDICAL STAFF. AH, YOU BROUGHT THE STUFF. WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. WHERE'S GIULIANO? HE SENT US. HE SAID TWO WERE BETTER THAN ONE. THAT WASN'T THE AGREEMENT. OK, I'LL GO TELL HIM. AFTER YOU WORK, HUH? HEY, THIS MEAN TROUBLE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] I NEED TO CLEAN. DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE? THAT'S ALRIGHT. MAY I COME IN? OH, YES. THANK YOU. I CAN'T DO IT. YES, YOU CAN. THAT BALD GUY THERE. GO ON. I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL. I TOLD YOUR MOTHER YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL. NO. DON'T MAKE ME GET MAD. I'LL TAKE THAT. COME HERE. COME HERE. DON'T DO IT. GET AWAY. GET AWAY! YOU! YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL. HEY, MY WALLET! STOP, THIEF! HEY! WHERE'S THE WALLET? WHERE'S THE WALLET? THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE WALLET. STOP IT! LEAVE HIM ALONE! THERE WAS NO MONEY! DON'T LIE! DON'T LIE! THERE'S NO MONEY! STOP HITTING ME! WHERE'S THE MONEY? LEAVE HIM ALONE! LEAVE HIM ALONE! WHERE'S THE WALLET? THERE WAS NO MONEY. AH! YOU'VE CAUSED NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. NO, PLEASE! LEAVE HIM ALONE! STOP IT! GET UP! GET UP! NO! NO! PLEASE, DON'T! NO MORE! GET OUT. YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, I THINK SO. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? HOW CAN I POSSIBLY BE ALL RIGHT? HE PUNCHED ME FIVE TIMES, HE KICKED ME SOME TIMES. I'M NOT JOKING. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? LET ME SEE. WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY, UH... WHY DO YOU STAY IN MONTEPETRA? THIS IS MY HOME. DID YOU EVER LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE? YES. WHERE? NAPLES. I WENT THERE AFTER VITTORIO DIED. ISABELLA WAS 3, AND I WAS ALONE. I SAW A NOTICE ABOUT JOBS FOR GIRLS. THIS WAS A CHANCE TO CHANGE MY LIFE, SO I WENT THERE, BUT THERE WERE NO JOBS. HUNDREDS OF GIRLS, BUT NO JOBS. THEY DO THAT TO KEEP THE WAGES DOWN. I SEE. I'M SORRY TO BE BORING YOU WITH THIS. NO, YOU'RE NOT BORING ME. WHAT HAPPENED? NOTHING. I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T PRY. NO, I MEAN, I JUST... I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WHAT HAPPENED? WE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY TO EAT OR COME HOME. DID YOU HAVE SOMEWHERE TO LIVE? I FOUND A PLACE, YES. THERE WAS THIS MAN WHO SAID HE HAD A PLACE, BUT... OW! SORRY. WHAT? WELL... THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE. THE AQUEDUCT'S BURNING! OH, LOOK. OH, MY GOD. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? STAY BACK. STAY BACK. CAN WE STOP IT? WHAT HAPPENED? SOME MEN FROM CIOLINO. DID YOU SEE THEM? YES. YOU TRIED TO STOP THEM? WHAT COULD I DO? BESIDES, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR BUSINESS IF YOUR HOUSE BURNS DOWN! WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS? THIS IS CIOLINO'S VILLAGE. HE DOESN'T WANT YOU HERE. I'LL BUILD IT AGAIN. THEY'LL BURN IT AGAIN. I'LL BUILD IT AGAIN. WHEN THEY COME BACK, I'LL BE HERE. I'M SORRY I WOKE YOU. AH, LUCIA. I JUST WANTED TO BE CLOSE TO YOU. OH, LUCIA. LUCIA. I... I WANT-- NO. NO. NO. I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT I WANT YOU HERE WITH ME. THEN I'LL BE HERE WITH YOU. I WANTED TO BE HERE WITH YOU. BUT FOR A REASON... THAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND LATER, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. DON'T. IT'S ALL RIGHT. BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I WANT YOU TO BE HERE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY AWKWARD ANYWAY. MMM, LUCIA. DON'T BE SORRY. I'LL SAY GOOD NIGHT NOW. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. MAY GOD BLESS YOU, LUCIA. I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE YOU COULD USE SOME SUPPLIES IF YOU'RE STAYING DOWN AT THE AQUEDUCT. OH. SO I PUT THEM ON TO PREPARE. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF. I'LL HELP YOU, UNLESS IT WOULD EMBARRASS YOU. WHY SHOULD I FEEL EMBARRASSED? MEN HERE DON'T LIKE TO WORK WITH WOMEN. OH. NO, WELL, FOR ME, IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE. GOOD. GOOD MORNING. WE COME TO WORK WITH YOU. THEY KNOW ALREADY. HEY! TONINO, LOOK WHO'S COMING. HOW YOU DOING? HELLO. I WANT YOU TO MEET BIANCA. HOW DO YOU DO, BIANCA? HELLO. SO, GIULIANO, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I'VE BEEN GETTING BOYS. IT'S PITIFUL FOR A MAN WORKING WITH LITTLE GIRLS. YOU WANT EVERYBODY LAUGHING? THEY'RE ALREADY LAUGHING. YOU HAD ENOUGH LAUGHING. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHERE DID YOU GET THESE BOYS? I GOT FRANCO HIS FIRST WOMAN, I GOT FABIO OUT OF TROUBLE, AND I BEAT UP A GUY FOR STEFAN. I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND. HOW ARE THESE GUYS DOING? THEY'RE FINE. THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD. ANY TROUBLE, YOU LET ME KNOW. THANK YOU, GIULIANO, FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING. THAT'S OK. HOLD THIS FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE. OH, SURE, YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURSELF A CUP OF COFFEE? WE HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO TALK ABOUT. OK. VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT, GIULIANO, NOW, SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING? WE'RE PUTTING UP THESE POSTS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RECONSTRUCT THIS. [RING] [RING] HELLO. HELLO, STEFANO. YOUR HOLINESS. YOUR HOLINESS, ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY BACK? NO, NO, NOT YET. CALLED TO TELL YOU THAT I COULD BE HERE FOR SOME TIME. LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS? STEFANO, LISTEN CAREFULLY. I'M HELPING THE VILLAGE TO REBUILD THE IRRIGATION SYSTEM. YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT? NO, STEFAN, I DON'T, BUT I'M LEARNING. WE CAN SEND EVERYTHING THEY NEED. ENGINEERS, MATERIALS, WE CAN BUILD IT FOR THEM. THESE ARE DEFEATED PEOPLE. IT WOULD SOON FALL INTO DISUSE. THEY HAVE TO DO IT THEMSELVES. BUT THIS COULD TAKE MONTHS. WELL, ANYWAY, STEFANO, IT MAY BE SOME TIME YET. HOLINESS, THE CARDINALS ARE RESTLESS, AND THE PRESS IS TRYING TO BRIBE THE STAFF FOR INFORMATION. STEFANO, I WILL BE BACK... SOMETIME. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE, HOLINESS. SO WHY DO YOU WORK FOR THIS GUY? I LOST A BET WITH HIM. HE'S NOT EVEN FROM HERE. WHY BE HONEST WITH HIM? I'M AN HONORABLE MAN. DON'T GET WISE WITH ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT. YOU WERE NOTHING WHEN I FOUND YOU. YOU GO ON WORKING FOR HIM, I'M GOING TO CUT YOU OFF. YOU UNDERSTAND? NO MORE PRETTY GIRLS OR FANCY SUITS. WORK FOR SLAVE LABOR. SEE WHAT YOU GET. AT LEAST I WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO STARVE TO DEATH, YOU BASTARD. WHO'S THERE? IS THE BOMBARDMENT OVER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I JUST CAME TO SAY HELLO. SO... HELLO. COME IN. SIT DOWN. THANK YOU. [COUGHS] [COUGHS] WHERE DID YOU GET THE FIREWORKS? I BOUGHT THEM. DID I SAY YOU DIDN'T? I HAVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS. MANDARIN DUCKS, BANTAM PHANTOMS. BANTAM PHANTOMS. YEAH. COME FESTIVAL TIME, I SELL THEM TO ALL THE TOWNS. BUT THAT'S NOTHING. HOW'S THIS? WONDERFUL. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MONTEPETRA WITH A TV. AH, YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY HERE. NOPE. IT MUST BE RATHER DIFFICULT TO WATCH. YEAH, SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES. IT'S A CONFESSIONAL FROM THE CHURCH? YEAH. WHO IS THE MAN IN THE PICTURE? SOMEBODY. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER? SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T EVER KNOW MY MOTHER AND FATHER. I WAS BROUGHT UP IN AN ORPHANAGE, YOU KNOW. THE NUNS FOUND ME AND TOOK ME IN. THEY SAID THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THEY EVER MADE WAS TO TAKE ME IN. I WAS IN ONE OF THOSE PLACES, TOO. MY FATHER COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF ME. HE WAS ALWAYS TRAVELING. SO HE DROPPED ME OFF THERE. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR MOTHER? SHE DIED WHEN I WAS BORN. AH. SOME OF US, YOU KNOW, ARE SLEEPING OUT BY THE WATER WHEEL, AND WE COULD DO WITH SOME NEW CONVERSATION OUT THERE. WHY DON'T YOU COME AND STAY THERE FOR A FEW NIGHTS? YEAH, MAYBE. WHATEVER YOU THINK. SEE HOW WELL YOUR BOYS ARE DOING? WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING, THEY DO IT GOOD. LET ME PAST. LOOK. LOOK, LOOK. GIULIANO. HEY, GUYS, LOOK WHO'S HERE. DID YOU BRING YOUR MATCHES? DO YOU THINK IT WILL WORK? I KNOW IT'S GONNA WORK. GOOD. JUST PULL IT DOWN TIGHT. OKAY? ALRIGHT. BACK UP A LITTLE FURTHER. ALL RIGHT. DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? YEAH. BRING IT DOWN. CIOLINO. CIOLINO. SHUT UP, STUPID. YOU'LL WAKE THEM. THEY'RE HERE! THEY TRIPPED THE WIRE! EVERYBODY UP. COME ON. AH HA! GET OUT! I REPEAT, HIS CONDITION IS NOT SERIOUS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CAUSE FOR ALARM. I'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE HIS HOLINESS' ANNOUNCEMENTS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE'S RECOVERED FROM HIS INFLUENZA. THANK YOU. WHEN WILL THAT BE? I CAN'T SAY. FIRST HE WAS INDISPOSED, THEN HE HAD A COLD. NOW IT'S INFLUENZA. AS I SAID, HIS HOLINESS IS RESTRICTED TO BED. THANK YOU. IS IT TRUE THAT HEART SPECIALISTS ARE BEING FLOWN IN? HEY, EVERYBODY! THEY TOOK DOWN THE ROADBLOCK! THEY TOOK DOWN THE ROADBLOCK! NO MORE FREE FOOD! IT'S OVER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THEY TOOK DOWN THE ROADBLOCK. SOMEBODY TALKED. WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU STAY OUT OF THIS. YOU'VE CAUSED ENOUGH PROBLEMS ALREADY. ALL OF YOU, GET DOWN! WHY SHOULD THEY GET DOWN? BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BURN IT. NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BURN SOMETHING WHICH CAN BE OF BENEFIT TO THESE PEOPLE, AND HAVE THEM GO BACK TO A GARBAGE DUMP. TELL THE WOMEN TO GET DOWN. COME ON, GET DOWN! [YELLING IN ITALIAN] THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COME DOWN. ARE YOU GOING TO STOP US? YES. YAY! GET BACK! COME ON! BACK! YAY! YAY! HEY! DON'T! GIULIANO! NO, DON'T DO IT! COME BACK HERE! AAH! GIULIANO! OH, MY GOD! GET HELP! I KNOW... I KNOW THAT I SHOULD PRAY FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. BUT I NEVER HAD TO FACE BEFORE THE DEATH OF SOMEONE THAT I LOVED. IT IS VERY HARD. IT'S VERY HARD. WHAT ABOUT STEFAN VII? HE ORDERED THE BODY OF HIS PREDECESSOR FORMOSUS TO BE EXHUMED, CLAD IN PAPAL ROBES, AND PUT ON TRIAL. THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY. IN HISTORY, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO GOT THERE FIRST. WHATEVER ONE DOES, IT'S SELDOM THE WORST OF ITS KIND. THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS, COMPARED WITH THESE OTHER PEOPLE, OUR POPE LEO IS A VERY SANE MAN. I THINK HE'LL COME BACK. PERHAPS, BUT I HAVE THINGS TO DO. SEE YOU LATER, COLIN. GHEZZI. HUH? YOU FORGOT TO KNEEL. [KNOCK ON DOOR] SECRETARY OF STATE CARDINAL MORANTE. PLEASE OPEN. REST WELL, HOLINESS. I'LL SEE TO IT YOU WON'T BE DISTURBED. WE MUST SEE HIS HOLINESS. HE CANNOT BE DISTURBED. THIS THING CANNOT WAIT. BUT HE'S JUST FALLEN ASLEEP. WELL, WHEN HE WAKE UP, CALL US. WHEN DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE? IT COULD BE QUITE A WHILE. HELLO. WONDERFUL VIEW. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? EXAMINING YOUR TERRIBLE WORKMANSHIP. I MISSED YOU. HA! YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU BUILD THIS WATER TRESTLE AND WONDERING IF YOU EVER CONSIDERED HOW YOU WERE GOING TO TURN THE WATER WHEEL? YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE. I HAVE CONSIDERED THAT, YES. BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE FAITH SOMETHING WILL TURN UP. LEONARDO DA VINCI WAS CONDEMNED BY THE CHURCH, WASN'T HE? YES. HMM. WELL, HE'S THE ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO TURN YOUR WATER WHEEL. OH, I THREW AWAY MY SPECS. AH! IT'S WONDERFUL. UH-HUH. IT'S WONDERFUL. WHO ARE YOU, ABALARDI? I WAS FIRED. FROM THE CHURCH? BY GOD. YOU'RE A PRIEST. YES. WERE YOU FIRED, OR DID YOU RESIGN? WHY? I FELT BETRAYED BY GOD. AND I SAW YOU APPROACH THE SAME HELL, BUT YOU DIDN'T FALL IN. OF COURSE, YOU ARE THE POPE. FOR POPES, THE FLAMES ARE HOTTER. THANK YOU. ALL OF THIS IS BECAUSE YOU CAME TO SEE ME. I LOVE YOU. THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED. THERE'S STILL A LOT TO DO. HMM? MM-HMM. YOU'LL DO IT. HUH? YES. YEAH.

WE DEMAND TO SEE HIS HOLINESS, IF HE'S IN HERE. YES, BUT WAIT. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE IN THERE. AS THE SENIOR MEMBER OF THE STAFF, I ORDER YOU TO STAND ASIDE. CARDINAL MORANTE, HOW ARE YOU? I'M SORRY, YOUR HOLINESS. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE. WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE? HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU, I AM MUCH BETTER. VERY SORRY. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE OR... NO, NO, THANK YOU. BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN. THANK YOU. VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! VIVA IL PAPA! CHILDREN OF GOD, I WELCOME YOU HERE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EASTER SUNDAY. I'M MORE HAPPY THAN I CAN EXPRESS THAT I CAN SPEND IT WITH YOU. I MUST THANK ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE WRITTEN LETTERS OF SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT DURING MY ILLNESS, BUT WE ARE NONE OF US SUPPOSED TO TELL LIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO WEAR THIS HAT. SO I MUST ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS AND TELL YOU THAT I WAS NOT CONFINED TO BED WITH INFLUENZA AS WAS GENERALLY SUPPOSED. INSTEAD, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE. I TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD STORY. THERE WAS ONCE A MAN KNOWN TO YOU AS POPE LEO XIV. LIKE A KING WHO LIVED IN A LARGE CASTLE WITH THICK WALLS, HE BECAME INCREASINGLY DEPRESSED AND ALONE, UNABLE TO SEE OR KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED TO HIM FOR GUIDANCE. Mother? ! Mother! Mommy? Mommy?

Mary Jessica Hammond. How old are you? 17. So, I would like to work with you. The way I work with Macy and Michael Jackson, and... He just drops it in there, the name. I'll give it up to you, if you want. So, I would like to have you on my team. We need to make an album, and we need to put it out to where it's big, in the UK, America, Brazil, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Argentina... Russia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Ireland. He's like a lobster, giving it all that! I'm telling you, you need to come here, babes! Do you want to put your guitar down? It's stuck to me. Hold on. I'll be your roadie. I'll hold it for you. I will be your producer and your roadie. Thank you. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I don't mind carrying the guitar. I want to talk to you as if I was you when I was 17. There's things in your voice that remind me of me. I'm not going to sit here as Will said, and go, "You're going to do this," because I don't surround myself with yes men. You need... I'm being serious. That wasn't a yes man. Wait, wait, wait! No, no. She's blowing me up. Do you mind if I do something with your guitar? Let me talk. I can understand where you're coming from. You're a female, you're young. You don't understand how amazing it is for me to sit here and have someone like yourself sing one of my songs. What I will say is, number ones, albums, touring, all that stuff is a bonus, yeah? Music is where it should stem from, and that's something me and you could enjoy. I can't compete with that. You can, you're Sir Tom Jones. What I can compete with is this. This show is called The Voice, right? And the thing we have to concentrate on, if you come with me, is picking the right songs in order to win this thing. And I feel I can help you with that. So, here I am, babe. I understand guitar playing and singing, something I've done since I was your age, even before. And I really feel the musicianship coming from you. I think we would work incredibly together. I really do. You've got four coaches - you've got only one decision. That's the beautiful part of the show, you've got artistic control. I really hope you make the right decision and come with me. Um, Will... Ssssh. Let her decide! I appreciate everything you said. Um, I'm a songwriter, I'm only 17 and from Belfast. Number one hits don't matter to me, making music and sharing my message is what matters to me. Beautiful, beautiful. Um... I'm going to go with Jessie. ♪ It's not about the money, money, money ♪ We don't need your money, money, money ♪ We just want to make the world... ♪ It's fine, it's fine. I can't wait to work with you. I thought it was gorgeous when Jessie picked Jessie, you're coming out against a Jessie J song, you know, I'm in for the pitch, she's Irish as well, so I might've been in there but, ah well, didn't work. She's so good! While Jessica takes her first step into the spotlight, some of our artists have already tasted fame. A decade ago, 30-year-old Sean Conlon was at the top of the game. Now he's hoping his voice will give him a second chance to shine. Hello, Sean. How are you doing? Good to see you again, shall I say. Could you explain why we've met before, please? I was in a band called Five. ♪ Get on up, when you're down ♪ Baby, take a good look around... ♪ It was kind of instant success, overnight. We got a Brit Award. We played with Brian May, he was playing his guitar... That was pretty mad. Obviously the band broke up, but if I remember correctly, you left first? I remember looking in the mirror and, I just knew I had to go and find who Sean Conlon was. I could just see this cartoon character Sean from Five and it just hit me really hard. I had a gut feeling that I had to walk my own path, and it was a really big decision at the time. 'I think the fact it's a blind audition really works in my favour.' Sean from Five doesn't come into it. If one of the coaches turns round, it's because of my voice. 'It's the consequences of doing what I'm doing that worries me. 'What will the reaction be? ' 'I really want this. 'It means everything to me. 'Otherwise I wouldn't take the risk.' ♪ Oh, no ♪ I see... ♪ ♪ The spider web is tangled up with me... ♪ And I lost my head ♪ And thought of all the stupid things I said... ♪ One light. One light. ♪ Oh no, what's this? ♪ A spider web and I'm caught in the middle ♪ So I turn to run ♪ And thought of all the stupid things I said... ♪ One light, come on, here we go, big notes. ♪ Singing, I never meant to cause you trouble... ♪ ♪ I never meant to do you wrong... ♪ Oh, come on, I'm so proud of you.

Oh my God. ♪ And if I ever caused you trouble... ♪ Oh no, I never meant to do you harm. ♪ Thank you. Oh, no. Oh, no. Ah, so that's it then? No, it isn't. What's your name? Sean Conlon. Sean Conlon? Yeah, I used to be in a boy band many years ago - about ten years ago... Yeah, you look really familiar. Five. Five! You were the first concert I ever saw. Really? Five! Thank you. For one, thank you for singing for us, it was a wonderful song. It sounded like you were blending in with the band instead of leading it. Yeah. For a person that's stepping out of a group to go solo, and you were in a group and you're trying to go solo. You want to be the maestro. Take the reins and conduct. I kind of disagree, I really enjoyed it and the only reason I didn't turn around is I was thinking, "What can I do for you?" Your voice to me is beautiful how it is and I... I would happily listen to you like, at home, all day cos your voice is... Really? Yeah! It completely chilled me out. Thank you. Darling, nice to meet you. Cheers. Nice to meet you, amazing voice, seriously. Yeah? Yeah. Well done, well done. Not to be. Pretty gutted. I would've loved to have gone on but it's not to be. Today was definitely a step in the right direction. For sure, yeah. Ten years away, you know, you just come back and it wasn't a small stage, yeah? Pretty big one! Yeah. Nothing like putting yourself in the lion's den. I did it and who knows what the future's going to bring, eh? Something good though, Reggie! Phew, just take me heart out... and throw it on the ground. Yeah, it's hard to know what to say to a person like that, isn't it? Sean's voice wasn't enough to get the coaches turning, but with a standard so high what exactly will it take to push their buttons? I've always been into tone, and technique and breathing. I want to hear someone's personality in their singing. Rock, folk, country, whatever, doesn't matter, man, it's all in. I'm just looking for someone that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Doesn't necessarily have to have vocal gymnastics... ♪ Ooh-ooh! ♪ I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for... just uniqueness. I like to listen to raw talent. As far as I'm concerned, you have a voice or you don't. And that's from a man who knows. Keen to prove that he has a voice worth listening to is 20 year-old Brummie Samuel Buttery. I am Samuel Buttery, I'm 20. I'd describe myself as being relatively happy, quite jolly but that's what people usually use for the word "fat", don't they? "He was jolly." I have never entered anything like this before but the fact that it is about the voice appeals to me. If the coaches saw me beforehand, they might get a totally different impression of my voice cos... I might be wrong, but I don't think my voice necessarily matches... me. Tom Jones is like a massive icon to me. When I was in primary school, I used to sing: ♪ What's new pussycat... ♪ And no-one liked it really. I think I'm ready. Is this family Buttery? Yes, this is the family Buttery. I'll take some credit for that! This is my dad, Mark. Hello. Hello, nice to meet you. Pleased to meet you. My little sister, Beth. Hi! And this is my best friend Grace. Hello. Who do you want to turn around? They're all like phenomenal, and I would like, obviously, anyone. Amazing! But Tom Jones I think is the one that I'd like to impress. Well, good luck. Thank you very much. I think you're fabulous already. Oh, thank you. Through that door are four of the biggest artists in the world... 'I'm really nervous.' ♪ I let it fall, my heart ♪ And as it fell You rose to claim it ♪ It was dark and I was over ♪ Until you kissed my lips and you saved me ♪ To stand in your arms ♪ Without falling to your feet ♪ Cos there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew... ♪ Come on! ♪ ..

Oh! Oh my God! Yes! Ohhh! Sorry, I'm a bit hysterical! What's your name? My name's Samuel Buttery. And I'm... I'm 20. I am really, really happy you turned round. What brings you to The Voice? I loved the sound of the programme because it is all about the voice and, I don't think I'm necessarily the package like, J-Lo or Beyonce! Aw! Yeah, but I'm still fabulous but just not J-Lo or Beyonce! But it brought me to The Voice because I just wanted to sing and I really... and it's just amazing. Oh! I've been singing and listening to Tom for... Sir Tom! I'll just do a little... I am just so happy you turned around. I am not going to lie, I was really surprised when I turned around. Honestly, I was expecting to see a female. Really... Really. Me too. Me too. But again, people have made that mistake about my own voice too. Look, I think you are in great hands you have a very strong, powerful voice. Who better to pair you up with than the legend himself. Fantastic. I heard a bit of me there, to be honest with you. You've inspired me a lot, so that's probably why. There you go, I really did, there were a few notes in there that sounded like me. Sounds like me in my head anyway. You've got a great voice. Thank you. I think we'll work really good together. So do I. Come down, come down. Lovely to see you. Thank you. Don't worry, good luck. Ah! Well done, son. 'You can see, I don't really know what to say.' That is who I wanted to turn round and he's Sir Tom for a reason. Congratulations. Thank you. Amazing. Swear to God, I thought it was a girl. Me too. I turned around and I was like... Really? ! I thought it was a girl. Really? ! Yeah. Didn't sound like a girl to me. Do I sound like a girl? No, not at all! Oh. You're the manliest sounding man I know! ♪ You don't have to be beautiful... ♪ So, Samuel is the first addition to Team Tom, and as the other coaches are realising, going up against music's equivalent of Muhammad Ali won't be an easy fight. I'm afraid of Tom Jones. Number one, 1965, by the way! That dude has knowledge! What? ! '65, '66, '67, '68, '69! I slackened off a bit in 1970, but hey! Out of the 150 years of experience that you have on stage, I think a lot of that belongs to him. I think most people know that I've been around a long time. I think I've sung with most people. Aretha Franklin, for instance. Yeah. Come here often? No! I sang with Frank Sinatra and Janis Joplin. Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, I mean the list goes on and on, so if I can put that to good use, then I will. It's the truth! Wow, that's Tom Jones right there. I want to do a song with him. Oh, that's right, we're here for The Voice. I'm competing against him! And ready to compete for her place on one of the coach's teams is 34-year-old Toni Warne, who's been waiting years to be judged on her voice and not her appearance. My name is Toni. I'm 34 and I work in a bank in Great Yarmouth. I've always gigged. Bars, pubs, clubs, cabaret, that was pretty much my work. I've suffered with alopecia since I was a young girl. But then at 21, I lost all my hair completely. And it had quite an impact... on me. You sort of... You sort of lose confidence. There's no question about it. I didn't think that I could gig the way that I am. And I got a 9-to-5 job. £197. Did you pay some money in, did you? So, what's different about now? This feels right, because it's called The Voice. It's not about having to cover up. Just to be herself, I know that she will feel comfortable with that. Especially the fact that she's not going to feel judged with the way she looks initially. She's going to go out, she's going to sing amazing, and then they're going to turn around, and be knocked out. It's time now to sing, and if they turn their chairs around, of course it would be the most amazing possible thing. I'm looking forward to walking on stage and being me for the first time ever, really. It feels good. ♪ Well I'm here just like I said ♪ Though it's breaking every rule ♪ I've ever made ♪ My racing heart is just the same ♪ Why make it strong to break it once again ♪ Mm-mmmm ♪ And I'd love to say I do ♪ Give everything to you ♪ But I can never now be true So I say ♪ I think I better leave right now Come on, turn around. # Before I fall any deeper ♪ I think I better leave right now ♪ I'm feeling weaker and weaker ♪ Somebody better show me how ♪ Before I fall any deeper ♪ Think I better leave right now ♪ You may never know why ♪ Once bitten twice as shy ♪ If I'm proud perhaps I should explain ♪ I couldn't bare to lose you again Hit that button!

And little tactics! You see him? "You should press the button". And then I turned around, and there you both are! Hello, Jessie! Hello! We were waiting for you. Ladies first! You pushed your button, it's fine! What's your name? Toni. Toni. And what is your inspiration, Toni? I sung for a living but I'd suffered with alopecia since I was little girl, but I lost all of my hair. And it really just knocked the stuffing out of me, really, you know, and I felt that I couldn't pursue what was in my heart because I didn't believe in myself. The last couple of years, I've had two beautiful, beautiful children and, sort of, you realise that life is short, you know, and music is my absolute passion beyond passion. I'm blown away. I thought, you have an old soul. You know, as I was listening, I could tell you'd been through something, been through pain, you'd been through the wars. And that's what really moved me, emotionally, to hit my button. But if you pick me, honestly, I will fight to the death for you, because I think you're fantastic. You're amazing. Your tone is so old school, that I feel like you could teach me something. And I love the fact that you didn't go ♪ Woooahhhhh! ♪ Right at the beginning, you went and let it grow, and that was what may be fall in love with your voice, so please, please, let's hang out and make music and have fun. Thank you, Jessie. You are what I call a real singer, you know? I mean, you are a real, REAL singer. You sound fantastic! I'm just overcome. I can't tell you how overwhelmed I am. This is just unbelievable. You deserve it. Thank you. You deserve it. You really deserve it. Really. Hey, look, you've got creative control, this is all up to you. Just know the right person is over here, he's Irish! Four years ago, somebody said to me, "Check this out, Toni, listen, "you're not going to believe what you hear," and I heard Jessie J for the first time and I'm telling you, Jessie, I would love to choose you. I'm so excited! I said I wouldn't cry. Come here, Toni. Well done. Toni's voice takes her to the next stage of the competition as part of Team Jessie. And while Toni's success sinks in, indie guitarist Adam Isaac is arriving, hoping that he too will strike a chord with the coaches. I'm Adam. I'm 28 years old. I've lived and breathed music for the last ten years of my life. ♪ Dreaming of another world. ♪ I've always done OK around my little gig circuit that I played for years, but this is the first time I put myself out there on this scale. I have got a fear of failure, which has stopped me from going for something like this before. While Adam gets ready to face his fears head-on, our next artist can't wait to hit the stage. Again. I spent a lot of years doing backing singing. I sang for people like Puff Daddy, R Kelly. And then when I had my children, I stopped. Now, it's mummy time! What am I going to be? A rocket star. Yay! You guys seem to have some pretty strong support, so who do we have with you today? Here's my mum, Tricia. My bestie! This is my beautiful daughter, Tian. And this is Talia! Can I hold Talia, please? Go-ahead! You're lovely. Hello, gorgeous. OK, well, you've got four amazing coaches sat in front of you when you finally get on that stage. What have you done to prepare for the show? I got my daughter and my auntie and I made them sit in the living room facing backwards. I was like, "Don't turn around, until you feel it!" And if you turn around before, no dinner for you! OK, well, good luck. Thank you. I can't wait to see you on stage. Thank you, I can't wait! And see you soon as well, all right? I'm glad that they're not going to see me straight away. I like the way I look. But, you know, it's just being a big girl, you always get put in this box. I am about to go out there and sing like it's my last performance. For me and my girls, this could be the first step to a really big change. So, yeah, this is big, this is big. Come on, Aundrea. Come on, I want to push it! ♪ I remember when, I remember I remember when I lost my mind ♪ There was something so pleasant about that place ♪ Even your emotions had an echo In so much space Come on!

I believe you have a beautiful voice, but you just need to learn to control it. It kind of splinters all over the place, a bit. Thank you. But you have a powerful, beautiful voice. Thank you. Hello, darlin'. Hello. Can I start by saying "yes" to the purple hair? Hello, hair! Team Purple! A-ha! I didn't turn around, not because I don't think you have an amazing voice - I think you do... but I think you're vibrato. I don't know if it was nerves, but I thought it could just chill out. But I think you and Tom are going to have a wild time. Yeah. Very excited! Oh, yeah? ! Yeah, baby! I loved your vibrato. I think it's spot on. You give it the full Monty and I'm looking forward to working with you and having you on my team. Thank you. Let's start the way we're going to continue. Give us a kiss, sweetheart. Thank you so much. You've made my dreams come true. ♪ You make me feel like... ♪ 'With a mentor like Tom Jones, ' I think the sky is the limit, so I'm so ready for whatever he's got. I'm like a sponge, ready to soak it all up, so you'll see more of all this! So Aundrea got the result she wanted, but the enormity of the competition is weighing heavy on Adam's mind, as he heads to the stage. 'Taking part in The Voice is a really big thing for me, 'because I am being judged' on the thing I love to do.

It was a really great performance. I hope you take that through the next stages, after two of the biggest artists in the world turned around to you, fantastic. Thank you very much. You have a great voice. You remind me of cats that I hang out with at home, that just love and eat music. Your voice is warm. It seems like star quality... the kind of voice you hear when you are in a restaurant and your girl's telling you something and you totally ignore everything she's saying, because the song's playing in the background. As far as I'm concerned, I've sung with a lot of people and recorded a lot of different kinds of song. I need somebody with a strong voice, because we're going to have a lot of different kinds of songs to do... when we win this. It's creative control at this stage. It's down to you now. This is one of the toughest decisions I've had to make - ever... in my life. Can I say one other thing? I was with Elvis Presley in Hawaii... and I was invited over to his house. When I got in there this day, Elvis wasn't there, so I said to Priscilla, his wife, I said, "What happened to Elvis?" And she said, "He's realised that we don't have guitars here and you are coming over "and he is very excited about it, so he's gone out to get two guitars." And Elvis Presley - and this is hand to God - walked into a music shop and told the girl behind the counter, "I've got Tom Jones coming over to my house today "and I need two guitars." The girl fainted. Anyway, he got the two guitars and he came back to the house and we played and sang together all day. So, I know when I hear somebody singing like that and playing like that. If you want experience, you're looking right at it. Wait a second. Can I say one more thing? There was one time I was living in Ireland, with Michael Jackson, and we were recording... This is why I didn't turn around, cos I can't compete! I met Justin Bieber once! Woo! I was making this track, right, and the beat was real mellow and he said, "I want you to make the beat a little louder. It's too slow." So I was, like, "You want it harder, Mike?" "Yes, if you could make the beat a little more aggressive. "I want a tasty beat, a beat that when people hear it, they just want to eat it." So... yeah, that was my little thing. OK. Thank you very much, both of you. It's amazing. I think...will.i.am. No, hang on, right? I was going to say, will.i.am, I'd like to say, that I have much respect for what you do. I jumped the gun! You're amazing... That's classic! .. But I'd like to go with the legend that is Tom Jones. ♪ A little less conversation ♪ A little more action, please ♪ All this aggravation ain't satisfying me. ♪ Na-na-na-na-na-nah! 'And the winner is... Tom Jones! ' That was good. Still to come on The Voice tonight... an internet sensation... I've had over one million hits, which is quite substantial in the YouTube scene. A Strictly star... Last year, I stood in for one of the singers on Strictly Come Dancing. And the coaches go all out to get what they want... Temper, temper! Oooh! Come on! I remember the first time we had success. And the second time, the third time, the fourth time. Eugh! Where I come from, I'm known as "The Voice". Coaches! As a great man once said, where is the love? It would appear there is no love lost between our next hopefuls - boyfriend and girlfriend, Max and Twinnielee. My name is Max Milner, I'm 20 and I'm a singer-songwriter. 'I just love writing. Singing music's my passion. I'm Twinnielee Moore, I'm 24 and I'm a performer. 'I've never been that confident as a singer, but this is always what' I've wanted to do. So are you two auditioning together? No. No. No. Separate artists. Have you thought about that horrible situation, if one goes through and one of you doesn't? Yeah, yeah. But I would obviously be massively happy for Twin if she got through, even if I didn't. I'm still going to be 100% behind her. I just love her so much. She's brilliant. ♪ Why do birds... ♪ I will be nervous to watch Max. He's amazing, he's brilliant. I'm incredibly proud of him. My girlfriend's obviously going to be supporting me, as I will her. I didn't tell anyone that I applied. Not even my boyfriend. I didn't know that she was applying. It's just an opportunity that you can't turn down. It was a bit of a shock. She was speaking to me like it was my thing. Then, all of a sudden, it was ours. I suppose it's because I wanted to do something for me. It's cool. I like it. I'm excited. I think we're going to be there for each other. I'd always be there for her. Obviously, I want to be there for him, but I don't know whether I can.

Phew. Hi! Well done! Thank you. I forgot to push my button, didn't I? That was great, anyway. What's your name? Max Milner. Max. What I loved was you got those two songs together and mashed them in. You've made them yours. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I turned around. I was so glad you were there with the amp, the guitar, just like you walked in off the street. And I think you're great. Thanks a lot. Cheers. Thanks. I think you're someone very special and I think that what you did with the two songs was very, very interesting and that's what having a voice is all about. It's about exploring things. That's why I would want you on my team, to make sure we can do that more. Max, you don't just have a voice... You're an artist. It's different. I worked with Macy Gray before she was big. She toured like this in LA, with her band. He dropped another name over here! It's not a name drop. Macy Gray was signed to my label. That's not a name drop, I'm just saying I know artists. And you belong with somebody that can take you that p-lace, up in s-pace. I've got to say, for me, coming from a fellow guitar player. I'm doing anything I can here! Do you have any Irish in your family? No! Can I just say, I'm an artist out right now. Does that count as anything interesting? I know how it is "right now"! Eugh! I didn't know Macy Gray before she got big. But we did do a gig together a couple of weeks ago in Brazil. You can tell that there's going to be a feeding frenzy over you, but now it's your choice, to see whose team you want to be on. Come on! I... I know who I'm going with. I'm going to go with this person because I think they're very similar to me. So I'm going to go with Danny. Yeah! Oh! Come here. Give it up, come on! Smokin'! Oh, that made my whole day, that did. A-ha! - Yeah! I'm so proud of you! That was a tough decision to me. How did you choose? I just feel as if we were very... I don't know, I think we'll get on very well. Yeah. I'm excited. Max picked me, even though Will was dropping names left, right and centre. I think he picked the wrong choice only because I think he picked a choice based on what he's comfortable with. Comfort isn't always the best thing. You could be comfortable in hell, you could find a cosy spot next to a hot rock. Don't mean it's the place to be. You're done. Yes. Twinnielee's not, however. Good luck, sweetheart. Oh! Find out if Twinnielee can match the success of her boyfriend, Max, soon. But first Ben Kelly is dressed and dicky-bowed to impress but on our stage, only his voice can do that. ♪ I'm just waiting for my chance to come. ♪ My name is Ben, I'm 22 years old and I come from a place called Derry in Northern Ireland. You know, a lot of people there have traditional, real jobs and it took a long time for my parents to realise what I actually wanted to do and even longer to accept that I want to be a pop star. Probably about two years ago I started putting all these covers on YouTube. In that time I've had over a million hits which is quite substantial if you're on the YouTube scene. 'But The Voice offers me what I need next which is the recording contract and that's what I really need.' Opportunities don't come along like this very often, I must admit.

What's your name? My name is Ben Kelly. The reason why I turned around - FIRST, and I was trying to disguise my turnaround but then Danny got hip to my moves! Hey, I had my eyes closed, I had my eyes closed. I went off the feeling. Sorry, continue. Lies! I can tell that you're singing for something. You're not just singing cos you have a great voice. I can tell that there's passion and you have a vision of where you want to go and music is the vehicle to get you there. Hi. Hello. As soon as I heard you sing, I was like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and I sat forward like this and I was, like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was kind of imagining what you'd look like and when I turned around it was all or more than I thought it was going to be. Your licks are mad clean, your tone is there. Your range is there. You're a risk taker and that's what I look for in vocalists. I know a star when I see one. Seriously, you're an absolute... Out of the box, out of the box. We can say that we want to work on stuff with this guy but this guy is the finished article right now. Then what's the point in him being on your team? In fairness... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. To that point there, we could dream together, toward the things we come up with... We can go and eat together! Hold on, wait, let me finish. Really, interrupting, seriously? Are we interrupting, seriously? The things that we could dream together will be taught in the future to other people and she's going to be teaching the style that we dream up to somebody else, right? That's all I'm saying. Can I also say I could teach you how to put out a record worldwide and it be successful? One second, please. One second. False information coming from the second chair. If we're going there, I can do it consecutively in every country on the planet. I don't want to pull that out, but... hello. You know, I know everybody wants you on their team but what I have to say is where I come from, I am known as "The Voice". You know what I'm saying? And this show is called The Voice so you come on my team, right? And we can win this. The best part about this is you have the artistic control. You get the chance here to pick any of us. I want someone who can help my voice progress. Someone who can help me with my songwriting which I do a lot of. Someone who can help me pursue the creative person I want to be. And... the boys are great but I think this girl's for me. Yeah! Thank you. Thank you so much. Don't worry. I know, I know. Come on, let's go and high-five them together. Yeah, yeah. In your face! Thank you. It's an honour. Oh, in-your-face. All right, all right, all right! One more, one more. Oh! No, well done. Congratulations. We love you, Jessie! I think he didn't really know what he was doing. I think he was faced with the batting lashes and he went straight for it. That's the problem, it's like a black hole. He'll get sucked in, he won't come back out again. It was such a great moment. The kind of moment I've been dreaming of my whole life. The kind of moment I've always wanted and it did feel like a dream. Ben, did that really just happen? I don't know, you tell me! It felt pretty cool to be picked over the other three coaches. Female power. So Jessie's on a roll bagging her third team member. ♪ Back to reality... ♪ Earlier Max Milner became the first member of Team Danny. So I'm going to go with Danny. Yeah! But can his girlfriend, performer and dancer Twinnielee, match his success? Especially when she knows looks count for nothing in a blind audition. This is what I've always dreamt of.

I felt like you didn't open up as much as I felt you could've done. You need to own it. You know, you sang it really well. But I didn't feel it. I didn't feel like you got inside it and... You know, and made it your own. Nice, though. Thank you. Cheers. I felt it. Oh, it's all right. I mean, I think my main focus was kind of on it all so I probably should start focusing more on my singing and I just totally agree with what they said. Yeah, and everything they said was correct so I can't argue with that. It's fine. You must be so proud of her. Ridiculously. She's amazing. And now you know what you have to do, you've got to go and win it for her. Absolutely! With four superstars to impress, you need top talent and big support so Phil Poole has brought his biggest fan - his Nan. My name's Phil, I'm 27 and I'm a delivery driver. That involves driving all around the country. Thousands of miles here, there and everywhere. I'll put my own music on and many times I think customers have heard me singing as I'm pulling up outside warehouses and they can hear me belting something out, yeah! How good a singer is he then? Brilliant. Do you think he'll do well today? He's been brilliant. Since he were at school, ain't you? OK, if you say so! How close are you guys? I'm so proud of him. What makes you so proud of him? Well, he's loving. Ain't ya? How well do you think he'll do? Good, I hope. Keep my fingers crossed. I'll do me best for ya. 'I do feel a bit of a fish out of water, I suppose. 'I've never auditioned for anything before, 'I've never put myself out there on such a scale.' 'I'm a delivery driver at the moment, but if I get a yes,' there's going to be a chance to really take something forward with singing, achieve something with it.

Throws the blame over here again. Seriously, I was like, "Danny, hit it, this guy is amazing, "you could really help him to make your team a better team." Thank you very much. Unfortunately, we toured with Train over in America, and I've heard that version and Pat Monahan singing it every night, and he goes hell-for-leather on it with the emotion. I was looking for that fire in my belly, and I didn't hear it. Not to say it wasn't a great performance, it was, but not enough for me to finally hit my button. When you try to do a song like that, that is so well-known, that you have to take it somewhere else. I mean, you have the voice for it, there's nothing wrong with your voice. That means a lot. You just need to take it to another place. Thank you for coming along, it was great. Thank you very much. Thank you. It's OK. Amazing. It was amazing. As long as these people are proud of me, that's what matters to me. Hey, come on. As long as I did you proud. I know you done me proud, darling. With one performance left to go, Tom, Jessie and Danny's teams are taking shape. But Will has yet to secure his first artist. I'm not annoyed. I have a strategy with what I'm doing here. Mwa-ha-ha! Could our next artist become part of Will's masterplan? My name's J Marie Cooper, I'm 27 years old. Music's a huge part of my life. My mum always heard me singing, so she decided to send me to Saturday classes, because she realised how much I enjoyed it. My mother passed away four years ago. Since then, it's given me a drive to just really go for my career. I've sang at weddings, birthday parties, but the work isn't consistent enough, just dribs and drabs. Last year I stood in for one of the singers on Strictly Come Dancing. I haven't really done a gig ever as big as that, so it was exciting for me. The only sad thing about it was it was only a one-off. What I really want now, especially without my mum around, is to build a life for myself. I'm singing Jessie J, Mama Knows Best for my audition. I miss my mum, so today's performance will be for her. ♪ Whoa, there is something going down ♪ Like the storm in the sky ♪ I ain't gonna be played by your behaviour ♪ How can I trust someone who's lying to me? ♪ Mama knows best when times get hard ♪ And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh ♪ Mama knows best when I feel down ♪ To bring me up and always keep my feet on solid ground ♪ See, no, I ain't no old rag doll ♪ That you can pick up and drop ♪ Hey, and all of this inconsistent love ♪ I think it's time that it S-T-O stops ♪ So bow out, go ♪ Now I said bow out and leave ♪ I said, take your bags and go ♪ Cos you're not for me ♪ Mama knows best when times get hard ♪ Papa always has a joke to make me laugh ♪ Mama knows best when I feel down ♪ To bring me up and always keep my feet on solid ground, sing it ♪ Ye-e-e-e-e-e-eah. ♪ That was insane. Thank you, you're insane. Not insane, insane! I'm so nervous right now. Why The Voice? Because I've been trying to do this for 10 years, I'm 27 now. I love it and I want to share my gift with everyone. Your voice is re-donk-u-loso. What, re-donk-u-loso? Re-donk-u-loso. I love it. I would write songs like that for you all day, so be on my team, please. There's lots of singers that can sing and do the runs and flips and tricks. Not like that. I come from a gospel family. I've seen all the flips in the world. The power, really, was when you weren't flipping. Bob Marley didn't do flips but you felt his pain. I felt it from the first couple of notes. I saw a pain, a love for the craft, and that's why I turned around and think you're a star of an artist. For me, you were on fire. Thank you. I was the last to turn around because I was listening. I wanted to hear the whole thing. It really was great. Thank you. You kicked it. Personally, I thought you killed it. It was amazing. If you go on Jessie's team, you'd cancel each other out. - You're that good. I'm just saying! - No! I think we're very different, the two of us. I think that would work very well together. Thanks for that. Oh, gosh! I'm stuck between you two guys at the moment. I don't know what to do. I'm just like... Am I number one right now? Am I number one right now? Jessie J! Jessie J! This is the voice coming from above. So, Jessie J, she's hot right now. She is hot right now. She's hot, current, right now. Oooh! And that's great. Ooooh! I remember the first time we had success, and the second time, third time, fourth time, fifth time, sixth time, seventh time. The thing that's making me stuck here is the fact you were saying about pain. I'm not trying to be dramatic or anything like that, but I like someone that can feel that inner voice. Believe me, that's why I wrote the song. Erm... I think... I'm going to cry if you don't pick me. Oh, my gosh! This is so hard. Flip the whole thing on its head and go with Team Dan. I will fight for you. Erm, oh, man... Come on! Come on! OK, this is probably going to surprise people but I'm going with Will because he turned round first. Oh, I really wanted her. It's on, now. Argh! Temper, temper! Ooh! So, after a night of hard-fought competition, the coaches' battle to build their teams has begun. Tom has three artists. Jessie has also secured three. I didn't start this show thinking I'd be competitive, but I'm feeling a little burn in my stomach. Danny has one artist. Will matches him with one artist. I already know what I got, and I know what I need. Then I'm going to get what I want. Next week, the blind auditions continue. More incredible artists fight for their place in the competition. You're going to beat these people. As the battle to build their teams intensifies, the coaches go all out to win. I can do it consecutively in every country on the planet. I don't want to pull that out, but hello. Everybody's in it to win it. Pick me! AJMOO Previously on "The mentalist"... We need to find kira tinsley. She either works for Red John, or she's about to become his next victim. Who did this to you? Tell me. Jane, what did she say? She told me Red John has a tattoo on his left shoulder-- Three dots. That's my leverage. - Jane. - Hello, Lisbon. Jane, don't do this, not without me. Listen, I'm sorry. Jane, I am begging you. You're in danger! I-it's gonna be okay. I-I'm gonna be okay. No, you're not. You do this, and you're throwing your life away. Bye, Lisbon. Jane... no. A tattoo? Yes. That we can use to identify Red John? - Yes. - That's great. So all we have to do is check each one of the suspects one by one until we find out who has the tattoo. No. Why not? Red John doesn't know I know about the tattoo. Okay. So if we start checking suspects, it's very likely that red john will find out. And disappear before we have a chance of getting him. Exactly. Then what do you want to do? Gather all five suspects together at the same place, same time, And then start checking for the tattoo. And how do we do that? We'll ask them. And you think they'll agree? Wasn't planning on giving them a choice. Even so, there's a problem. Bret Stiles--he's wanted by the F.B.I. in connection to two homicides. Yeah. Cold cases from over 20 years ago. You're kidding, after all this time, the F.B.I. is moving in now? Well, they must have found something new- forensics, a witness. Well, where's Stiles? Well, that's the thing. Nobody knows, Not even the F.B.I. Stiles disappeared weeks ago. We'll find him. How? I don't know, but we'll find him. We have to. I'm on board with your plan. Good. On one condition. I want to be there when you reveal Red John. Okay. Seriously. - I said okay. - Yeah, but you didn't mean it. Did I not? Uh, how can you tell? This is non-negotiable, Jane. I agree 100%. I think I've made myself clear, agents. I have no knowledge of Bret Stiles' whereabouts. Yes, and we've made it clear that we're not buying it. Stiles leaves you in charge of Visualize, but he keeps you in the dark about where he's hiding? Doesn't make sense. Stiles has and always will put the church's needs before his own. This time is no different. He doesn't want me to know because he wants to protect me. And because he doesn't want to be found. I doubt Bret Stiles is worried about being found. You seem confident. Call it faith. You see, Stiles' time in our... reality is limited. As we speak, he's preparing his mind and body for a departure from the confines of our material world. He's dying? That is a very naive, very ignorant way of looking at it. Bret Stiles is not dying. Bret Stiles cannot die. He is elevating himself to another plane, one lesser men like ourselves can only strive to reach. And one some of us obviously can't comprehend. Coffee--one cream, one sugar. Thanks, Russell. Forensics is here when you're ready. Send them over. Get his I.D. for me, will you? You know how I am about heights. Sure. Oh, and, uh, someone's here to see you. Thanks. There's been a breakthrough in the Red John investigation. I have some new information. Some very significant information. Okay. What is it? No, no. Not yet. I'm not sure who I can trust. I'm not even sure I can trust you. Red John has some very powerful allies. Patrick, come on. Okay, but not here. Meet me at 8:00 on Thursday night. Thursday? Why? I need time to find a safe place to meet. Fine. Where? I'll let you know the day of. This is crazy. I've made the mistake of underestimating Red John a number of times now. I don't want to make that mistake again. If you want the information, it's on my terms. Okay. Thursday night. This is Sheriff McAllister. Sheriff? Patrick Jane. Hello, Patrick. How are things? Good. Good. - I'm calling because I had a question. - Shoot. Last month when I was in Napa, you said that you were at my disposal. Yes, I remember. Did you mean what you said? I like to think I'm a man of my word. Oh, I don't doubt it. But can I count on you for your help? Can I count on you? Of course. Thursday night at 8:00 I'll need your help. Well, then you've got it. Thank you. I'll let you know where to be the day of. Patrick? Yeah? This is about Red John, isn't it? Thursday night. They're ready for you, sir. Thank you, Evelyn. Also, this came for you. You are here tonight to witness my ascension. My ascension from this world to a world beyond. Do not mourn me, my children, for this is not a passing, but a departure. And I promise... I... will... return! Listen to me, Don, you don't have a mistresst. You have a vindictive screwball who's about to ruin your life. Yes, well, it's very lucky for you my job is to fix problems, so here's what you're gonna do. You are gonna write her a check-- It is gonna be a very big check-- And then you are gonna pray that this problem goes away. If it doesn't, don't worry, Don. There are plenty of ways to keep a woman quiet, OK? I gotta go. All right. You're late. It's good to see you, too, Teresa. Uh, excuse me, can I get coffee, black, please? Thanks. So why am I here at 8:00 a.m.? I need help with an investigation. What investigation? It's not important. Really? It is if you want my help. I can't tell you. Come on, Teresa. I know you better than that. What, you and Jane got something going on with the Red John case? Maybe. "Maybe." Yeah, right. What is with all the secrecy? Seriously, why are you always holding out on me? You don't think I'm Red John, do you? You do, don't you? Tell you what. You want Take the helicopter. I'll see you in the morning. I'll see you in the morning. Good. I love you, Nicky. So... is the love of money really the root of all evil? Or is it something else? ¡Vámanos! Is it the love of freedom... Cupcake, wait a second. - Leave me alone. - Why are you doing this? I only get one life, and I have to make it mine. Someday is today. Let her go. She'll be all right. Okay. Go for it, kiddo. I love you. I love you. The love of fame? No, seriously, Ethan, you should come down and check it out. Because I value your opinion. I'm trying to figure out what to do with this thing before my dad makes me sell it. We should hit the Bahamas, maybe? But I got to get back, though, before I go to space camp. Ethan? - Dude? - Is it the love of virtue... It's not about the money, you idiot! I want our son to go to the school that he would go to if we were together! They won't take him at the school if he's not mine. Fine, then he's yours. Congratulations, baby, you're royalty. Andrea. Wait, I can't just bring him home to my wife and kids. The love of vice? Please don't leave me, Patty. I'll do something terrible. I know it. It's okay. I'm here. Is it the love of romance? They're gonna make a whole line of kids' golf videos to start. If that goes really well, they're gonna do the same thing, only in Japanese. And I'm gonna be the spokesperson, kinda, you know, the face of the whole thing. It'll just cost $1 million up front to start. It's a good idea, right? Yes. Yeah, it's a good idea. Or is it having too much of anything? Is that the problem? I don't know. I just know I'm gonna find out who killed my father. And when I do... they're gonna pay. The love of money is the root of all evil. That's what they say,anyway. money makes everything go wrong. That's certainly what I always thought. When I was a kid,my dad worked for the chest family in new york city-- the darlings. it's my job,clare. If they' gonna buy an entire island,I have to at least see it first. Yeah,right,and I get to sit here and rot! You want me to quit? Do you want me to quit? I quit.Fine. no,devlin,take care of the the darlings, because obviously they need you more than we do. Working for the darlings was hard on my dad, but it was even harder on my mom. At some point,you'll come to your senses I've already come to my senses,dutch. I'm not coming back. Nicky... it's not your fault. Mommy just has to go. good-bye,sweetheart. And it was hard for me,too,as I grew up in the shadow of my father... and the immensely wealthy family he worked for. nicky,you wait out here,all right? I have to take care of a few things,and I'll be back in ten minutes,then we'll go home. -Okay? -Okay. I hate you. I love you. And so I promised myself that when I grew up, I would never be anything like my dad, and I would never work for the darlings. -Your dad called. -Great. Who else? Uh,let them eat food ba,and judge campbell called-- um,completely off-the-record as usual. Yeah? What does she have to say? Well,legally speaking,the sisters of eternalercy can keep their little playground... oh,that's good. If they can find a million dollars to buy it. -A million? -Yep. Oh,god. Why does the world have to be so miserable? -That coffee's from yesterday. -oh! Daisy! And your dad called... -yeah,you told me that already. -Again. He really wants to have lunch next week. Well,I'm not gonna be able to do that. Nick,it's been over two months since you talked to him. Look,daisy,just call him and tell him I'm sorry,but I'm too busy,I really am. And then two weeks ago,my father's plane crashed and everything changed. Is everyone here for grandpa's funeral? yeah,they sure are. It's weird. Yeah,it is. excuse me. Excuse me,officer? Officer,can we,uh,can we get through here? I'm sorry,who are you-- justin timberlake or k-fed? I've heard 'em all today. No,it's my father's funeral. Oh. It's everybody's father's funeral today. you've gotta be kidding me. god,here they come. daddy,who? Who is it? It's grandpa's friends,honey. It's the darlings. *** tripp! Oh,my god,I wanna die. Tish,you can do this,sweetheart. *** hey,freddy! Freddy! How's it feel to leave the pga to be mr.Karen darling? Don't answer them,baby. They're idiots. *** marry me,karen! when will you formally announce your candidacy for the senate? *** please,folks,no politics. It's a sad day.

When did you get back from tahiti? Uh,30 minutes and 6 double espressos ago. Kelly slater says hi. -Kelly. -Hi! what's your reaction to the stories about you in the tabloids? Listen,I spend enough of my time dealing with reputable media,okay? patrick,were you close with devlin george? Are you kidding me? He taught me how to ride my bike and fly-fish. He helped me pass the new york bar. He was so much more than just our lawyer. He was like a father to us. Patrick. If you'll excuse me. Nick,what are you doing out here? Just,you know,watching the parade. Officer,he's with us. thanks. Special. -how are you? -I'm fine. I'm very sorry. -I'm sorry. -Thank you. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. And even if your dad did insert himself a little too much into our family. But he felt that's what his job was,right? To insinuate himself into everything no? So that he could suck as much money out of us as possible? You know,brian,kiki's right here. I'm sorry,nick. You're right. Let's not fight.I hate you. *** I'm sorry grandpa's dead. Please,god,tell me we'll never have to see these people ever again. Done. Dirty Sex Money Season 1 Episode 1 / Why are you having a drink with tripp darling? You told me we'd never have to see these people again. Well,he wants to start this charitable fund in dad's name. I'm gonna do the paperwork for him,and then we're done. Okay? I promise. Okay. Don't turn into a pumpkin. I'm not gonna turn into anything. why the hell is nick george coming over? This is the worst idea in the history of the western world. Well,I think that's a little melodramatic,brian. Nick george should not be our family lawyer,pure and simple. It's what dad wants,brian. yeah. And besides,nick grew up with us. No,nick didn't grow up with us,pat. He was the offspring of an employee. maybe we should let maria's little panchito manage your campaign. -Brian,your father feels that- - we all know how dad feels. He loves nicgeorge,but he's wrong. Since when is loving someone ever wrong? Nick's wet. He's the brother I always wanted. Hey... ignatz. Other--other brother. Other brother. Jeremy,how many times do I have to tell you? Get midas off the couch. Maria,get midas off the couch. What I don't understand is why we don't just let the market work. The market? Freddy,you're not a part of this family yet,so just stay out of it. what he's saying is that we should shop around,which I think is a huge mistake,by the way. Look,your father and I have had an extensive conversation-- but there are better lawyers thanick george who would do a lot more for us for a lot less money, and who wouldn't bring this massive attitude of entitlement to the table. Nickas never felt entitled to anything. Karen,you're drunk and in love with him,so shut the hell up. Hey! I have had a scotch,okay? One. Nick george is just like his dad. He's a glorified parasite. I want a fresh start as much as anybody. But nick is your father's choice. And that's that. Is that the '90? Give that a try. It's a little vineyard we just bought in bordeaux. It's azing. You still take an interest? I do. I don't get to taste thingsike this too often. Not in my line of work,you know? Yeah,well... maybe your line of work is about to change,huh? What do you mean by that? I need your help,nicky. With what? With the family. You know,daily affairs. Since your dad's gone-- whew-- the paperwork alone's eating me alive. Tripp,certainly there are better equipped lawyers than me to deal with the family affairs. Yeah,I know. And I contemplated bringing some hotshot in to take the reins. No one seems right. I considered johnnie cochran. -He's dead,tripp. -Yeah,I know. I found out. he was a bit of a grandstander anyway. Loudmouth. I spoke with bill. -Bill clinton? -Uh-huh. You asked bill clinton if he wanted to represent the family? Took my shot. I mean,you know me,nicky. The thing is,when I really stopped and thought about it... you're the guy. Oh,god. You know us,nicky. You're the guy. I'm flattered,tripp,but... what patrick said at the funeral the other day is true. I really did have to share dad with you guys when I was growing up,and I didn't like it. I won't do that to my wife,and I certainly won't do that to my daughter. -You want to be a good dad. - I do. So did dutch,and look at you,nicky. You're a successful lawyer. You're a family man. And best of all,you've got a moral center. So you tell me who did wrong. If I had one kid like you,I'd be lucky. I don'T. Tripp,I just don't think it's a good fit. I'm gonna put my nuts on the table. Okay,if you have to. I'll give you $5 million a year-- on top of what I pay you-- to do all your good works around town,all your little charitable projects. You--you keep your practice,keep everybody on salary,keep everything as is. Why would you do that? Because... I miss your dad. I miss having that solid citizen by my side to tell me which way is up. And I trust ya. I'd have to do it my own way. Hey,what man wouldn't? I'd have to keep regular hours. You keep whatever hours you want. Have to be able to say no if I felt I was participating in anything questionable. No one forces your hand,nicky. And I'd never lie for the family. We would never ask you to. $10 million. Done. thank you for an amazing night. Did we just win the lottery? What do you mean? Well,you just took me to a $500 dinner. And you bought these tickets to A.B.T. Last time I checked,you're a lawyer who basically works for free. I took the job working for the family. What? Lisa,lisa,this is a good thing. It's a good thing. Are you sure? Yes,this is a really... really good thing. Tripp is giving me $10 million a year to start a charitable foundation in dad's name, on top of my salary,which is gna be pretty impressive. He's giving you $10 million a year to just give away? Yeah. I don't know. I-I-- are you sure you really want to do this? -I mean,your dad was a mess. He was-- - hey,wait a minute. Lisa,lisa,lisa,I am not my dad. I know that,but if you're taking the job to prove that you know it, it's not the right reason to take the job. That's not the reason I'm doing this. This is a great opportunity. Okay? And I'm gonna do it my way. I like the way you do things. -Oh,yeah? -Yeah. So,uh,I guess that could work. Think it's gonna work? hello. hey,nick. It's me. Me who? Jeremy. Jeremy darling. who is it? It's--it's jeremy darling. Oh,my god. Uh,listen,jeremy,can you call me later? No.I'm--I'm playing poker over at-- over at ethan hawke's place. I just won a yacht. Yeah,well,winning's a great feeling,jeremy,but listen-- it's wet.Are you kidding me? It's totally wet. uh,jeremy,what exactly do you need,besides maybe some toilet paper? Well,this guy francois I won it from,he says that the title is on the yacht at chelsea piers in--in the galley,and I can just take it. Is it really that simple? No,no,no. It's--it's not that simple. Where is it registered? France,probably? Or germany? I don't know. This is why-- this is why I need help,nick. would you knock it off? Um,hey,listen,here's what you're gonna have to do. You have to get the title and bring it to my office later today, and we'll ke sure everything's okay. Thank you,nick. You're the wettest! daisy. Can you put the family's phone numbers into this thing for me,please? And don't let me forget,I'm picking up kiki after school. Hey,I am sorry I'm late. I got trapped on a phone call with your brother brian. Oh,I'm sorry,nick. What was it about? Oh,god,I don't kw. He wanted my help getting some parishioner's kid into the maple grove academy? Not my job. Nick deflowered me. -Really? That's great. -What? Nick,it's just the truth. Karen,do you have a check for me? Yep,here it is. $10 million from the darling family foundation for you to do all kinds ofood with. Well,actually,before the day is over, I'm gonna use $1 million of it to save a playground for some orphans. Oh,orphans! Nick used to read me poetry out loud. It was so sweet. Do you remember,nick? Remember? Karen,I really-- I always thought we'd be married.Didn't you? -Karen,I think freddy-- - I did. Instead I married three-- well,it's gonna be four other people. it's weird. Weird,isn't it? David! -Have you come for a laugh, too? -Of course not! -It's all over anyway. -You're giving up? I could only afford to hire the equipment for 24 hours. Besides, maybe it's better she's not found. If everyone's laughing at me, imagine how they'd treat her. She'll end up in some freak show in a zoo for everyone to come and gawk at. I guess. It's better she stays free, in the ocean, where she belongs. Can't dive without a wet suit. It's at home. It's not much use there. Dad, I can't dive with you. -Because? -Because... Well, it's kind of hard to explain. I-- [Zac] Hi. [clears throat] So I went swimming this morning and look what I found. [laughs] Evie said you'd lost it. This means a lot, Zac. Thank you. No worries. We'll do that dive another time, eh? Sure, Dad. Thanks, mate. You were the only one that didn't laugh at me, Sirena. The world is way more magical than we can ever know.

Truman, your uncle's afraid of you. Where's your luggage? At the hotel, at the end of the street. At the hotel? Why don't you stay here? You snore and your dog doesn't like me... Why the hell didn't you tell me you were coming? Paula told me a surprise would do you good. Yes, I know... You talk to my cousin behind my back. You don't tell me much, so what should I do? I feel bad for not coming earlier. You should! I hope you find it hard to sleep at night. Well, I do have trouble sleeping. I'm spending a fortune on therapy because of you. Good. I've even changed therapists. - Really? - Yes. Me too. I have a kind of spiritual guide now. A spiritual guide? Yeah, a shaman from the Amazon who lives in Vallecas. I bought a few things at the airport. That's some really great whisky, you'll love it. How nice. - Besides... - What's this? Ah, that's a drawing from my kids. Now see, these are the things we'll have to avoid, otherwise... How many days can you stay? - Four. - Only four? Yes, I have to be back next Monday. We got any money? I'm broke. Yes, we can do whatever you want. You hear that? We're going to have a great time together. You're not here to talk me into anything, right? No need to get so defensive, Julián. Paula asked you to come and change my mind, didn't she? No, I came because I wanted to see you. - Besides... - Besides? It's true that when you told me what you'd decided, I thought maybe... maybe we could talk about it. - Really? - Yeah. Can't we? You can head back to Canada right now! - You can go back to your penguins. - Julián, listen. Look, take the chocolates, the whisky... No, I'll keep the whisky. Go back now, if you hurry, you'll make the return flight. Screw that. You know how much my ticket cost? I'll stay four days, you'll have to put up with me. Go with your uncle. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about. I'll join you in 20 minutes. I have an appointment with the doctor. Are you a friend of Julián's? Yes. Why? Give him this, he ordered it days ago, but I never see him. Okay. That's 50 euros. Oh, yes... of course. Here. Is Julián all right? Yes, he's at home. Good. It's just that I haven't seen him for days, and when I saw you with Truman, I thought maybe he got worse or... No, he's fine. Great... I'm glad. - Tell him I said hi. - I will. So? - Great. - Really? Wait a minute. Come here, Truman. - Can I leave him for a while? - Of course. I'll be back soon. Thanks. My neighbor, she always looks after him. Shall we go? - Walking? - Yeah. First, I need to see the vet. It's just some blocks away. Okay. CAT MISSING Which one should I put? - What for? - To put him up for adoption. Do you want to put him up for adoption? Of course. What should I do? What about your cousin? No, not Paula. She lives in a small apartment, she has a cat. I'm worried, really. I haven't told him yet. - What? - What will happen. - To whom? - Truman. I tell him everything. Dogs aren't plants, Tomás. You have no fucking idea. They have personality. Yes, I've realized. Earlier at the park, Truman asked me about the bears in Canada. See? Tomás, I have two children. One of them's called Truman. - Julián, he can see you now. - Thank you. - Hi, Julián. - Hi. Sorry I can't spend more time with you, but you can see... I'm doing a test. Thank you very much... Sorry, Tomás, a friend. - Hello. - Hello. - It's just a question. - Tell me. - Is it his paw again? - No, no, his paw's perfect. I wanted to ask you... about something else. How do you think dogs experience loss... grief? You mean if someone dies? Their owner, for example. How could we help him? Well, just like when they're abandoned, the animal suffers from the separation. What might happen to him? Would you both like to sit down? - Yes. - No, that's okay. Well... he might be kind of aloof, and he might have psychosomatic reactions, like digestive problems, irritable behavior... I'm looking for a family to adopt him. What do you think? Should I look for a similar... I mean, a man on his own like me, or a complete change, such as a family with kids? I don't know, I really don't, Julián. Do you think he could adapt to living with other dogs? It's not what he's used to. It would be easier if he didn't have to learn new habits. It'd be important for him to feel really looked after, to feel that he's loved. One last thing. When I have to leave him definitely, do you think I should leave him one of my T-shirts, or some clothes that smell like me, is it a good idea? Well, having his own things, like a blanket to lie on, or a ball, a toy, that'd be fine, it'd be good for him, I'm not sure about your things, I don't know... I could ask a colleague who specializes in animal psychology for his opinion. I'd be very grateful. I'll do anything to help him. I also want to pay for several visits in advance. I want his new owners to bring him to you. I want to be sure that, even if his new home is far away from here, that they'll bring him here. Don't worry, Julián. We'll take care of him. He'll be fine, I promise. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Bye. - Thank you. Bye. Warn me ahead of time before the next scene like that. I'm going to tell you something important. Okay. The only things that matter in life are relationships. Love. Family, you and me, Truman and me... I need some breakfast before going on with the day. Who would have thought we'd be friends for so many years? I wouldn't have, really. You know the main thing I've learned from you? What you've taught me all these years unknowingly? Why don't we keep walking? Because I'm saying something important, can't you wait one more minute? Why are you here? I want to have breakfast, so that I'm ready. What's that important thing you've learned from me? Let's see. You never expect anything in return. You never want a payback. You're generous, unlike me. Thanks. - And me? - What? What have you learned from me? From you? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Maybe illegal things... To be brave. You've always faced everything squarely. Like now. You see, this alone made the trip from the North Pole worth it already. Sorry I'm late, Julián. Don't worry, doctor. I know you'd rather see my cousin, she's cuter than my friend here, but he's come for a few days and I just can't shake him off. He came from Canada. - Hello. - Hello. To say goodbye. Well... As I told you, we should start another round of chemotherapy. We're going to change the medicine, to try to have a greater effect on the tumors. As I told you the last time we met, I'll schedule you for a CAT scan, to see how far those new tumors on the liver have gone. Could you come in tomorrow or the day after for some tests? And I'll schedule the CAT scan for Friday? No. I've come to tell you I'm not coming back. Julián, when we talked about the test results the other day, I gave you the impression that... We've done everything we could, haven't we, doctor? Yes. We've fought hard these past few months, right? I don't want to spend whatever I have left in and out of the hospital. I'll miss the nurses very much, that's for sure, but... I'm done. I've been fighting this lung cancer for a year, and when I was taking some time off, this son of a bitch goes on excursion all over my body. What good will it do starting chemo again? I mean, if I start the treatment again, will I be cured? I know people don't usually ask these things, but I do. Will I be cured? No. I don't think so. I'm going to die anyway, no matter what I do, right? Yes. Why should I go on with it? To gain some time, Julián. Of course, of course. How long are we talking about? You promised to keep silent. You think I flew across the globe to keep silent? How long? It's hard to say, but it'll be quicker without the treatment. Well, it might be worth it. I've already made up my mind, you know that. Sometimes we react impulsively, and we make decisions, but then after thinking it over calmly, you see things differently. I've been thinking this over calmly for a year. You're the one who just got here, Tomás. I should have come with Paula. If we don't continue with chemo, how much longer can he hold on? It's hard to say... It'll depend on how the disease plays out in the final stages. Right. Do I need to sign any papers? Er... no... I'll write a report for the hospital committee, I'll explain your decision, and if you want, we could meet in two weeks to see how you are. - Do you agree? - All right. Prescribe all the drugs you can, okay? Well... I brought you something. It's a very bad movie I made a few years ago, but since you told me you like crime stories. - Yes. You didn't have to, Julián. - I know. - Thanks for everything, doc. - You're welcome. Bye. Thank you. I didn't mean to reproach you for anything before. - Okay. - We're all doing the best we can. No one's to blame. Well, my wife is. She's to blame. She made me come, I didn't want to. I knew something was fishy... Do you think I felt like coming with you to...? No, I suppose not. She said if I didn't come now, I'd regret it later... so I had no choice. - Where are we going? - To eat, weren't you hungry? We're going to a friend's restaurant. Pay. Where are you going, Tomás? - Hello. - Hello. I'm looking for books about animal psychology. Pets. Dogs. - Behavior patterns... - Yes. Follow me. All the books about animals and pets are here. You have nutrition, dog behavior, health. This is everything we've got. - Great, thank you. - You're welcome. This one looks good, doesn't it? I'm giving you these two. Okay? Thank you. This one? "Death, a New Dawn." "The author makes us understand that death is an experience similar to birth." Sounds interesting, don't you think? This one. "Helping to Die." If I were going to Thailand, I'd need a map, that's the same. I'm a bit dizzy. Let's go. Who is it? Someone who has chosen to ignore me. Maybe he didn't see you. No, he did see me, but he's pretending otherwise. He's an actor. We've worked together many times. He's not really a friend, but... and his wife saw me, too. Well... Why wouldn't they say hi? Because people don't know what to say to me. They smell death and they get scared. - Got it. - They don't know what to do. They prefer to avoid me. I guess it's logical. I guess. Can we change the subject while we eat? Yes, sorry. - Be right back. - Julián. Julián... - Gerardo. - Julián! - How are you? - Nice to see you. Please, don't bother... How's everything? - Fine, fine. - Glad to hear it. She's swamped with work. Not me, but... What about you? Are you at the theater? - That's right. - We'll come see you sometime. Don't wait too long, my run's almost over. We'll see when we can go... Are you eating here? Yes, over there, at that table back there. We just got here, we didn't see you. Yeah, you saw me, but you pretended you didn't. Come on, Julián. I'm not asking you to call me and ask how I'm doing, but if we run into each other like today, saying hi, giving a hug, some good wishes... would be appreciated. I think we won't meet again, so... I'll leave you. Don't want to bother you. - Better? - Better. - Paula. - No, no. Paula, come on. Aren't you good friends? DANGEROUS LIAISONS EXTENDED RUN I'm begging you, take leave. Please consider my plea and go away. My mother will be here any minute and... if she found us like this, we'd both be in serious trouble. Why does my heart beat so strongly when I write to you? Don't get desperate. Your friend, Cecil. Do you like it there? Have you ever thought of coming back? No, never. You're very certain about things. - It seems so, doesn't it? - Yes. Haven't you ever considered going back to Buenos Aires? I did last year, when my ex and I split up... I really considered it, but it's impossible. Separating Valentina from her father wouldn't be right. He's having another baby soon. Valentina's happy she'll have a brother. What can I do about it? It serves me right for getting involved with a Spaniard, it was my fault. Thank you for answering all my emails all these months. I'm good, I'm a very efficient secretary, aren't I? What did the doctor tell him? You think he could reconsider? No. In fact, he went to the doctor to say goodbye. Haven't you had a talk with him? He listens to you, he values your opinion, Tomás. Yes. I tried. - But... - But what? I didn't have any good arguments. I didn't know they were necessary to keep on living? What could I do? Hey, don't get angry... No, I'm not angry, I'm tired. Julián has lots of friends, they invite him to parties... But then each one has their life... Real friends are far away... or just come for a visit. No, you're right. And I'm sorry. It took me a long time to come. I know... He's the first of my friends who is dying and... I don't know how to... I brought you a gift, some chocolates, but I'll give them to Truman. Julián, what's wrong? Well, what do you think? I'm sleeping. It's 4:00 in the morning. No, no, I don't want to talk. Okay, let's see. Why do you want me to open the window? So that you smell the marijuana you bought me, it's excellent. I got so hungry... Come over to my place. Aren't you hungry? - I don't want to eat, I want to sleep. - Yes, so do I, but I can't. And when I finally do fall asleep, I just keep dreaming... Mostly about my parents. I was reading one of those instructive books you got me, and it says it's normal to dream about dead people in my situation. You know why? Yes... No... Well, I don't remember right now. Because it seems to be a way of subconsciously preparing ourselves for the journey. Thinking about who's going to come meet us. They're going to meet you? - Of course. - I see, and where? I don't know yet, I'm still on the first chapter. And you... Who would you want to come meet you? My mother, I guess. Or Marilyn Monroe. I never got along too well with my dad, you know that, but it'd make me feel safe if he came. My mother was so flighty, she's sure to be late or get lost. Weren't you an atheist? Very, yes, I used to be very atheist. Not anymore. I see... Well, I'll keep reading. Sleep well. Thank you for coming. I love you. Good morning, sir. Here's your breakfast. Yes, leave it right there, please, thanks. I ordered scrambled eggs and orange juice. That's what you have for breakfast in Greenland, right? I want to give Truman a quick bath. He hasn't gotten one in a while, because I don't have a bathtub. And Paula won't let me do it in hers, I don't know... Hurry up! We're meeting an adoptive family. What's your son's name? - Sasha. - What a nice name. We adopted him in Russia, he was three years old. Have you had a dog before? No, honestly, my wife didn't want one, but we finally convinced her. Sasha is really excited about it. So Truman, do you like the house? It's very nice, very nice. I was telling them we've never had a dog before... No, we had a cat. I've always liked cats better, specially in an apartment... But since we moved here, I have no excuse. He seems very well-behaved. And very clean. I sent him to a private school. I'm having a hard time finding someone who wants him. Almost everyone wants puppies. That won't be a problem for you? No, it's part of the therapy. It is? Therapy? Yes, the idea is adopting an animal like we adopted him. It seems that identification between them could be very beneficial for Sasha. That's interesting, isn't it? Yes, very much. Why do you want to get rid of him? Well, no... I'm going on a trip... on a long trip, and... I can't take him with me. Well, you can come visit him when you're back. Thank you, that would be nice. You'll see when you meet Sasha... It's really quiet here. It's as if we're not in Madrid. Why don't you leave him here with us? To see how it goes. Right now? Yes, to try for a day, to see if he gets along with Sasha. Yes, yes... But I didn't bring anything. Not even his toothbrush or pajamas... I think it's a good idea. Don't you think? Since we're here... To see how Truman feels too, right? I don't know. Why not? - Why not? - Maybe another day. When? Listen, we'll take good care of him. He's not used to sleeping alone, or outside. Maybe he could sleep in the boy's room. - Of course. - He drinks a lot. You could give him dog food but I usually boil rice, and add small pieces of red meat. He really likes that. And muffins. - Muffins? - Yes. - Coffee? - Yes. - Well... - Well... I'll call you tomorrow to pick him up. Or we'll bring him to you. - Nice to meet you. - Same here. Be good, Truman. Don't make me look bad. - Bye. - Bye. Come on, let's go. It's been so many years. We sleep together, have showers together... - Enough, enough... - Okay. Tonight you're staying at my place. I don't like sleeping alone. You can sleep on the sofa... Wherever you want. What are we going to do here? If you want, you can wait at the park. It won't be fun. Who did you say you talked to? A woman. I talked to her a couple of weeks ago. I said I'd come to see her, but I couldn't make it until today. I guess it was Beatriz. She's not here today. - If you don't mind, I'll help you. - Yes, of course. Basically what I need is an estimate. What kind of burial? Who's the deceased? - Me. - Oh. It will be me. He accompanies me and helps me with all the procedures. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. One moment, please. Will you come with me, please? What had you arranged with my colleague? Well, nothing, in fact. I'm not sure whether I want... a regular funeral or cremation. I see. Well, that's a very personal decision. Regarding prices, they are quite similar. It depends on the quality of the materials, both of urns and coffins. Do you have a family niche or plot to be buried in? - No. - No. We have some urns for storing the ashes in the family home, so that they are on display. These urns have different designs, and very good details. We also have biodegradable urns, which are buried like coffins. And finally, urns made of salt, which dissolve in the sea. No, not in the sea. - No? - No. If you prefer, we have the White Porcelain option, it's this one with golden ornamental ribbons, which give the urns solemnity. Excuse me, I have a question. Aren't they a bit small? I mean, do all the ashes fit in there? Of course, yes. Well, they end up... in just a tiny bit. I'll show you now... the souvenirs and memorial cards. We can suggest an assortment of poems if you want. Some cards play music when you open them. - Music? - Yes. Classical music, people like it a lot. We also handle the flowers, the ceremony, whether it's religious or not. If you want live music, we have a small quartet. What else? Ah, yes, very important. We make DVD with photos... and images of the person, which are shown at the ceremony. I'd love it if you could send me several estimates, with everything that's included in them. Could it be by email? Certainly, of course. Let me load your information into the computer. - Yes. - This way, please. I can leave you some money if you need it. No. You'll need it. How much have you got in the bank? In the bank, nothing. I owe money to the treasury department, and they'd keep it all anyway. The only bit I've got is in a cookie jar... I don't want to tell you where because I don't trust you yet. I won't offer it again. Tell you what. Before you leave, without me noticing it, you can leave me some money somewhere... and that's it. If I see Marilyn, I'll tell her about you. What are you doing? - Nothing, I'm hiding. - Why? - Is he sitting down yet? - He's sitting down, yes. Who is it? A friend. A friend? What did you do? I slept with his wife, and soon after they divorced, that's all. He's heading this way. - He's coming over? - Yes. If I were you, I'd stop playing the fool. Julián... - Hello, Luis... How are you? - Fine. - Such a long time... - I'm fine. I didn't see you. Did you just get here? Yes, we've just come in. I wasn't sure if it was you. How are you? Well, very well. Working, like always. - Hello. - Still got your studio? Yes, I've got a French partner now. He gets me a lot of work. I'm glad to hear it. Julián... I'm really sorry about what's happening to you. I just heard recently and... I'm really sorry you're going through this. I just wanted to tell you. I often think of you. Thank you, Luis. Keep your spirits up. I'll let you get on with your meal. Thanks. Sorry to interrupt... I was just leaving and... I wanted to say goodbye. This is Mónica. This is Julián. - Nice to meet you. - You, too. Thank you for saying hello earlier. After what happened, that you said hello the way you did, I didn't expect it. I'm really thankful. I'm very moved and I want to apologize. No, it's not necessary, Julián. Yes, it is necessary, it really is. I want to apologize because you were my friend, and what I did was despicable. And I especially apologize for not saying I was sorry at the time. Especially for that. I could have done it, couldn't I? I accept your apologies. Thank you. However, if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have met Mónica. She's pregnant. Really? That's great. Congratulations. She's pregnant. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Well, I take back my apology. Sorry. Goodbye. You're like an extinct species, you know that, don't you? You could stuff me and put me in a display cabinet. That's a good idea. I could get back the money you owe me. Mr. Alfredo, how are you? - Am I interrupting? - You never interrupt. My friend Tomás is visiting me for a few days. Mr. Alfredo's the producer of the play, and the owner of the theater. - Nice to meet you. - The theater has no owner, Julián. Have a seat, please. I've learned about your disease. When I was told, one week ago, I started crying. And I have no words of comfort. Thank you. But I also... I also got mad at you. I got mad because I thought I should've been the first person to know. We're friends, aren't we? Of course. Who gave you your first job here in the theater? You did, Mr. Alfredo. And back then, nobody was hiring Argentine actors. Nobody. I didn't mean to upset you. I know, I know... dear Julián. Julián, what you need now is rest. Stay at home, let others take care of you. I have to see to it that this boat stays afloat. So everyone can get paid at the end of the month. It's been very hard to find someone else. He won't be as good as you are, but after some training, he learned his lines. We've arranged that he'll start at the end of the month. You still have a few days to say goodbye. You understand, don't you? I think of you all the time. What was that? I'd say he's just fired you. Everything's going to hell. Argentine rock. - Paula. - Yes, Paula. You talk to her, come on. She wants to get today's report. You answer... You two get on well... Hello... Hello. Good morning, it's Julián. Yes, the dog's owner. No, I wanted to know what time I could pick him up. Did he eat? Yes. Great, great, no problem. Oh, I see... No, that's no problem at all... Okay, right. Thank you. See you tomorrow. What's wrong? Nothing, nothing... They asked if he can stay for another day. The Russian boy got home late yesterday, they spent very little time together... They want to take them to a park to play today. Well, that's good, isn't it? Means things are going well, it's a good sign. Yes, I don't know... I guess. What do you want to do? What surprises have you got lined up for me today? None, I was going to pick up Truman and that's it. How old is your son? Nico? Twenty-one. - He'll be 22 tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Well, we can ask him to dinner. Let's celebrate it. To dinner? When? Well, today if you want. If I want... I'd love it but... If you want to be alone with him, I can... No, no, he'd be glad to see you, I always quote you as as an example, I don't know of what, but I do. We get the tickets online, don't we? - What tickets? - For the plane. What plane? Nicolás lives in Amsterdam, Tomás. Nico lives in Amsterdam? Yes, he's studying there, I told you that. Well, I didn't remember. So you want us to go there for lunch? It was your idea. Yes, yes, but I didn't know he was in Holland. Well, what's the problem? It's near, we'll be back soon. - Yes, sure... What? - What? You want us to go there, have lunch and come back? - Isn't it a good idea? - it is, and very original, too. Hey, you asked me what I wanted to do. - Yes. - I told you... "I want to go to Amsterdam to see Nicolás, my son." I haven't seen him in a while. - It's his birthday tomorrow. - Yes. Plus I'd get out of Madrid, which will be good for me. But if it's not true we can do whatever we want... - You said we had money. - That's right. So... Don't worry. I'll go when you leave, that's okay. We can make some sandwiches and go to the park to row. We can rent a rowboat. We'll have a great time! Don't worry. They're not serving anything, not even coffee or water. I told you that. I was about to show them my test results, maybe that way... - Have I said thank you? - Yes, my leg hurts. How's Nico? - How's he coping? - He's better now. He doesn't talk much about his feelings... He's nothing like me in that sense. But he's fine. He doesn't know the whole story anyway. What doesn't he know? He thinks the cancer's under control. I haven't told him about this last month, or that I'm quitting chemo... What for? There's no need. I want him to be calm, there'll be time to... What's wrong? Why do you have that look? What look? The one you had, as when you disagree. Well, maybe I do disagree, that's all. - He's happy now, he's happy... - I know. He's with his girlfriend, living abroad... He's had a rough year. What good is it to upset him? I don't see why people insist on making others suffer. He has the right to know it. Did I ask for your opinion? I don't think so. Everyone says what they think, gives me advice. They're all fucking clueless. Fuck everyone else. I paid for the tickets, I'm here. I'll give you my opinion if I want to. When you're dying, call me and we'll talk, fuck you! Julián. Julián. I'm reading, don't bother me or I'll call the flight attendant. Okay, I'm sorry, you're right. Each person... Each person dies as best they can. So what's the plan? What did you arrange with Nico? Want me to find a restaurant for lunch? To ask about local dishes to celebrate? I don't know, I haven't heard from him yet. What do you mean? He doesn't know we're coming? I guess he does, I left him another message. What if he's not there? Why so much trouble? It's not that hard to make sure before... Why wouldn't he be there? He lives there. Maybe he's gone away with his girlfriend, I don't know. Maybe they rented some bicycles, it's common there, and went to Belgium. - I don't know, Julián. - Why don't you go jerk off? You're very nervous, it'll calm you down. Go and jerk off. Do you remember how to do it? I can ask the flight attendant for help. What are you doing? Looking for his boat, this is the right street, but I don't know where his boat is. - I think it's this one. - He lives on a boat? Let's see. Er... Is Nico home? - Shall I translate? - Please. He's not here. He left early. He's left by bike. Hello, how are you? Hi... Fine. Ask him how to get to the university. Where's he going? To write down the address. He said we can take the tram right there. I bet they spend the whole day smoking pot, listening to music, fucking... I envy them... Being young is the best. Maybe we're here for a reason, you know? Maybe you're right and... I should tell Nico everything. I should. Wouldn't it be better if the two of you were alone? You can talk calmly... I'll say hello but then I leave. You have lunch together... No, no, I think it'll be good if you are there. I'll signal you when the time comes and you go to smoke... I don't smoke. Well, go to the bathroom, I don't know. OK. What signal? Like what? So I don't... A gesture. Something simple. - Nothing else. - Okay. Nico, have you heard my messages? In Amsterdam, I told you. Now at the university, exactly. I don't know, first floor, the hall... What? You can see me? Where are you? Dad, what are you doing here? Give me a hug. - What's up? What's wrong? - Nothing, nothing's wrong. I've come with Tomás. Remember Tomás? Yes, hello, Tomás. He's here in Amsterdam for a conference, and he invited me, I accepted, and this way I get to see you, too. - It's your birthday tomorrow. - Yes... Why didn't you tell me you were coming? It just came up all of a sudden, I hadn't planned it before... And I wanted to surprise you. - I see... - I left you a message. Yes, but surprises... I don't... I haven't heard the messages either. I see. Well, I thought we could go out to lunch, for a little celebration. Yeah, but I've made plans, and then I've got an exam. And tonight we're going to a concert... If you had called ahead... Don't worry, please, that's all right. We'll hang out for as long as you can. Just having seen you is enough for me. I could head back right now. That's it. How's Truman? His leg's better? Yes, he's better. - Everything's fine. - Yes? Everything's fine. I was getting lunch now. - If you want something quick. - Yes. Let's go then. Er... Sophie's coming. Great. In fact, I came here to meet your girlfriend. I already know you. Let's go. What a nice place. You always come here? Yes, sometimes... The Wi-Fi... - I met Sophie here. - Did you? You like her. You're really involved in the relationship... - What's this? - A gift. I couldn't come empty-handed, could I? It's a hip flask... for whisky or whatever you put in your drinks. I used to do that. Truman chose it. Thanks, Dad. I don't drink much, but thanks. Nico... What? How's everything going? Things okay? - Yes. - Really? Yes... Great. Thanks. Dad... I said all that before, but I'm glad you came. I know. I'll carry this. What's your conference about? - Which one? - The one you're here for. Robotics. - Robotics? - Yes. I work for a company in Montreal which creates prototypes, and I teach at university. I went to get a doctorate, and I stayed... Watch out. Why- - No, I don't think I'll stay in Amsterdam. I said that when I went to Madrid, and how long have I been there? Think about it. No, I think... I'll go live in Buenos Aires for a while. Why? I didn't know it... I've only been there a couple of times and... How long have you had this plan, this idea? For a while now. I'll get a smoke. Why didn't you tell me your father was coming? I didn't know he was. It was a birthday surprise. Ah... Do you want to be alone? Am I interrupting? - Not at all. - No. - You're sure? - Sure. I can't smoke these ones... Sophie, this is Tomás, a friend of my father's. - Hello. - Hello. - Where are you from? - Paris. Well, let's see. Let's order something, whatever you want, it's on us. Will you be here for long? You can stay on the boat. That would be great but no, thank you, Sophie. We're going back to Madrid today. This was a lightning visit, to see Nico, and celebrate his birthday... You make a very good couple. Very good. Okay, Dad. No, "Okay, Dad" no, that's the truth. And it's because of her, she's much cuter than you. Although I imagined her differently. I don't know, more Dutch. Dutch? I told you she was French... Yes, but... The same happened to me. - Really? - Yes, Nico tells me about you. - He talks about me? - Yes, always. That's weird, he never tells me anything. That's why I had to come to meet you. Are you feeling better now? Yes, much better. Thanks for asking. Why don't we order some drinks and have a toast? - Yes... - It's Nico's birthday. - That's why we're here. - Happy birthday. When are you coming to Madrid? When I finish my exams. You already asked me that. Oh, yes. Promise me this time you'll come with Sophie, okay? You can stay at my house. You'll have privacy. I'll go to your mother's. I'd like to see that, you and mom together. How much have you got on you? - How much what? - Euros. No, Dad. Dad, it's not necessary. Yes, yes, it is necessary. I haven't sent you money for weeks... It's necessary. You can have dinner somewhere nice. Money's not an issue. He owes me a lot, I'm always lending him. That's true. Well, thanks. - We have to go. - Yes. - Tomás... - Bye. - Bye. - It was nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. - Look after him for me. - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. Well, it was a short visit, but it was worth it. - Yes. - Wasn't it? Well... We'll see each other in a few weeks. Okay. - Your lighter. - Ah, it's okay... Bye. I couldn't... I tried, I did try but... It's okay. You'll have another chance. - Just a minute. - Where are you going? To cry a little... alone... I'll be... Don't you answer? No, it's the theater. - You have a show? - Yes. - Did you forget? - No, I didn't. But don't worry, there's no problem. They've got somebody else, don't they? I'm sure he'll answer. I'm going to get drunk tonight, and so are you, you deserve it. Thanks. What? Nothing. All this. It's your fault, you know that. What? Amsterdam, that he's so happy, all this... - Cheers. - Cheers. When are you leaving? Day after next. Tomorrow's my last day. Come over to my place for dinner. I don't want to be alone with him, I'm fed up with him. So am I. I'll try but... I'll cook, don't worry. Then maybe I'll come. - Really? - Yes. - Great. - Okay. Well, good night. Your vitamins, don't forget to take them. Where are we sleeping tonight, honey? Truman... How did the Russians treat you? Badly, can't you see he's swollen, his breath stinks, I don't know what they gave him. You have breakfast here often? No, I'm with another candidate, she's in the restroom. She might adopt him. She phoned this morning, you were snoring. It's good to have more options. Since the Russian doesn't want him. - He doesn't? - No. Why? What did they tell you? Apparently... the boy is afraid he'll die. - The boy is afraid he... - Yes. Yes, because Truman is old... The boy couldn't take another loss. They hadn't considered that, not even the therapist. Now they want a puppy, or a turtle, a parrot... What was I saying? That your husband doesn't like dogs. Not my husband, my ex-husband. Yes, sorry. My friend Tomás. Elena. Hi. Have you got a deck or a balcony... so Truman can get outside a bit? I've got a patio with a tree. He'll love it. - That's good. - It's not very big but... I love dogs. When are you leaving? - Where to? - Canada. I told her we're moving to Montreal in a couple months. Perfect, I'd like to fix up the patio a bit. When you come to Madrid, you can always come visit him. - Thank you very much. - You can come to dinner. That's very kind of you. I'd ordered another beer! A long time ago! Maybe you're deaf? - I'll bring it right over. - I have to go now. Forget it. - I've got to run. - Yes. Call me tomorrow or whenever you want, and you come to see my house. I'll call you. My pleasure. Thanks. I'll call you in a few days. Bye. She's a woman, Truman, you'll get used to it. - You must be kidding. - Why? You're not leaving Truman with that woman. What's wrong with her? She's a racist, did you see how she treated the waiter? Think about it. Yes, I will. I don't know what they fed him, he'll be like this all week. Let's go. Can I have the check, please? Truman, my friend, how are you? Gloria... My God... What a surprise! What are you doing here? Are you back from Canada? No, no... I'm just here for a few days. I came to see Julián. Where is he? At the pharmacy. Julián didn't tell me you were coming. Well, we don't talk that often... It was a surprise visit... - And I'm leaving tomorrow. - Well, well, well... My ex-wife and my best friend together, what's this? Gloria. How are you? Fine, fine... I spotted Truman here alone... Did Nico tell you? No, what? We were in Amsterdam yesterday. We gave him a surprise. Really? You went to see him? We couldn't stay long, because they had an exam, but we had a drink, we had lunch and celebrated... We talked. I'm glad, Julián. That's a weight off my back. I didn't know how to handle this. Nico called me last weekend. I know you wanted to tell him, but he just kept on asking more and more questions... He realized something was wrong. So I told him. - Haven't he told you? - Yes, of course. I told him about your decision so he can be prepared. - I'm sorry if... - No, no. Don't worry. We didn't talk so much because Sophie was there... but... everything was fine. I'm glad to hear it. Nico needed to see you. He was devastated. He wanted to call you, but he didn't dare to speak on the phone. - I understand. - You know him. He follows every test you get done. Nico promised he'd bring Sophie to Madrid soon. Let's hope so. Well... I've got to go, it was great to see you, Tomás. - Take care. - You too. - Call me if you need anything. - Of course. The inseparable friends. Come here. Julián, let's go. Thanks. Do you want anything else? Are you okay? I'm a bit upset. Why? Because you're leaving tomorrow. And I won't ever see you again. I hate goodbyes, I'm not going to the airport. I want to make it clear. I don't want you to come either. - Fine, we'll say goodbye on the street. - Fine. You take a taxi and go back to the North Pole, that's it. I think it's a great idea. How come I didn't realize, when he hugged me? Why didn't I realize? Call him. Yes. I'll go to the bathroom. That was fast, I thought you went to the bathroom. I've just peed on myself. It's okay, don't worry, let's go home. I used to be a romantic hero, Tomás. A romantic hero. It's delicious, Tomás. When are you going to learn? What for? I invite you to dinner and you never come. I never come because you end up ordering pizza. What's wrong with pizza? It's not any call? I was gonna leave soon. Dinner? Not yet. I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. - What are we having? - Your favorite. - You wanna take a shower? - After dinner. - I think it's done. - Let it simmer. Can you hand me the clothes pins and hangers from the sofa? - I couldn't find the pins. - It's okay. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed upyet. - Let me help you pack up. - Okay. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up by yourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me, that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me. I'll never drink again. Because I have you. The soccer team of South and North Korea returned today... to the Seoul Training Center after training in Pohang... with North Korean officials coming through "Panmunjum." The North Korea President Lee and officials... coming to the south for the game and a conference... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color. You can't tell the difference from water with the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight... over 6,000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction. But without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. If you expose it to both light and heat... nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200 cc, so everything within the radius of one kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction... the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, if the sphere becomes red... it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops... it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years.You're an oddball. I am not, sir. - Admit it. - No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fishbowls. Agent Ryu, come to room 17. I gotta go. Find the CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognize him? Don't you remember, Ryu? His name is Park.A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked... he was the only one that escaped from the plane. A painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park. All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th Special Forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from National Defense. - Agent Yoon! - Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th Special Forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th Special Forces intercepted the CTX. Why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table... for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for... they say they want peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. If they wanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of Korea would be much easier. Why would they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb? That's difficult to answer. Hee is the key to all this. We don't have time. We'll find a way. What do you see? Can't even tell me? Maybe the solution is much closer than we think. - What do you mean? - Hee could be close by. Hey, you! - What the hell are you doing here? - I am looking for the men's room. Are you fucking blind? Didn't see the sign "Restricted Area"? Hey, you hear me? I sure did. Watch your mouth. - How have you been? - Bored to death. I feel more insecure when it's so quiet. I need some backup. What about your agency? - The air isn't very clear there. - What do you mean? I think there's a leak. This is the only way. - It must be very stressful. - It'll get better. - When do you need it? - Tomorrow. - I'm coming too. - Sorry, no married men. - Time and place? - I'll call you. All right, then. Ho! We'll talk later. How's your friend? He'll live. - I am glad to hear that. Have a seat. Who else knew you two were meeting? It was very personal. I didn't tell anybody. Lim, Kim, Ho. Hee is very nearby. There must be a leak. Nobody knows that for sure. Internal Affairs is on it. You don't trust your men? Do you trust me? Traps could be anywhere. Maybe there's a hole in the security system... but that possibility is almost zero. Don't share the information with anybody. Not even with your partner, Lee. Traps under your feet are hard to see. I'm the director in charge. I'm Park of the 8th Special Forces. I want to talk to my old friend. Thanks for calling me, friend. I was gonna send you a coffin, but you were lucky. Disappointed with Hee's shooting? Save it. We can take you out anytime. Maybe I'll take you out first. So, you've become a man.You know where I am? Young drunk kids here yelling on the street... while people in the north are starving to death. Listen, friend. We have ten CTXs placed all over Seoul. I'll call you 30 minutes before each of them goes off. You'd better find them before people get hurt. What do you want? Slow down, friend.The first one is on the roof of the Golden Tower. You have exactly 30 minutes. You know the fish named "shiri"? It's a Korean aboriginal fish, living in crystal streams. Though they're separated with the country divided... someday they'll reunite in the same streams. Should I buy some for your girlfriend's fish shop? Why not? Stay alive until then. He's on the move. Clear! Found it! Hyun? Don't tell anybody you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear people of the South,to day marks an important and joyous moment in our history. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissention... and to open up a new era of understanding. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and he wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center. I'm on my way. Be there. He's wearing a black jacket and a black cap. Anything else? - That's all. I'll be right there. You look good in a black jacket. Anyone else coming? Hee, maybe. So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tap the phones. So, if they show up... I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a five-shot semiautomatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. Three targets went inside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! - Been a long time. - Good to see you. Payback time for flight 257. You killed seven of my men. You left your men behind. 'Cause I have a job to finish. You wanna know what it is? It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! Get back! She used only two bullets. In both cases,you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island. Why'd you come here? They ambushed us. OP set a trap. Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. Thanks to you... we lost two of our men! I did what I could do. Yeah, you saved my life. What do you want? You've changed. Of course I have... from Hee to Hyun. Not only in appearance, but inside as well! I don't need a betrayer. We've waited ten years for this moment. In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance... and buried our youth in the tomb of history. If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings finish it here. I was stupid..thinking I could be Hyun. But I am just Hee who has to kill her man I failed to change my inside. Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking... because her immune system has dropped. There she is, with the yellow sweater. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Are you from the public health center? I am looking for this girl. Anything happen to her? She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house two years ago... and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me... as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me from Japan, but... I think she misplaced my number. Otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left, I cried my eyes out. She hugged me and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know what she was sorry about. Prepare ten million dollars... and a 747 Jumbo at the airport by 2:00. No mistakes. The Golden Tower was just the beginning. I hope I don't have to use the other nine CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies into the bowl. Two of them died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies anymore. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsy is needed-- If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North... will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main stadium at 2:00 p.m today. With the presidents of two nations present-- Hi. I'm here to collect for the newspaper. - How much? - Seven dollars. It's all right. Bye. What are you doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had four goldfish on my desk... I had four goldfish on my desk... and two of them died today. At first I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong. "SU300" inside their bodies... is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here... and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997... when Hee disappeared, you were in Japan. You didn't need a fake passport coming back in... because you became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy... Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me ask you this. Did you really love him? Over here! I planted a bug in your car. Will you forgive me? Stay with me! The ambulance is on the way! I messed up. You're going to be okay. You've always been the best! This won't kill me. - Stay with me! The 747's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from terminal two. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want ten million dollars. - They were bluffing. - Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium! Go back to headquarters. Don't worry about the stadium. Not even a drop of water can pass through security. - It won't work. Listen to me! You lost your partner today. Go back. It's an order! I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule. Sorry. Your attention, please. No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thank you for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. But what the hell am I doing here watching the gate? How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim and Lee... have just arrived! Let's give them a big hand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. Turn the lights on? Who's in charge of the lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Why would anybody do that in broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Did you turn the lights on in section 3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regular day, you know. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn off the lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 011-244-1616. Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can't you hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you say were the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! Sometimes history needs craziness to help it. What do you want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are not your barriers. When we're done here our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights offnow! That's not what the people of this land want. They don't want another war to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country? I remember very well. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians... but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it." When you sing this song our people in the North are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters are being sold off... for fucking 100 dollars! Have you ever seen parents eating... the flesh of their dead kids? With cheese, Coke and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. A soccer game to unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years ofdeception. We're opening up.. a new history of Korea. The CTX will detonate soon. History will judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years... came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights off in section 3-G? Turn them off! . Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell. You know where Hee is? She's in the audience laughing at you. You know where Hee is? She's in the audience,laughing at you. Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the president! Gate 52, he's on his way to the parking lot. A National Defense spokesman revealed a war scenario attempted by... North Korea's 8th Special Forces. They sent five secret agents, including Park, into South Korea-- Things about oddballs! One. Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning like you don't. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? March, last year. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn't you ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fishbowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a whole year? What do you want me to say? Answer the question. We don't trust anybody... not even the fellow agents you share life with. But she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a goddess with six heads in Greek mythology. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra of our times-- The reality ofa separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pager Voice Mail. You have one new message. Ryu,it's me, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTX is planted in the lights over the Royal Box. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor. I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... is all of my life. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu... I miss you so much. I miss you. How have you been? It's you again. Did you meet her? No. It would have been nicer if you came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. If one of them dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised.She knew everything about fish. In fact she stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating... you have to be alert. She's so bad with chopsticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. A Kang Jegyu Film Han Suckyu Choi Minsik Song Kangho Kim Yunjin Directed by Kang Jegyu SHIRI October 1992 Somewhere in North Korea T16, clear! T19, clear! Name: Hee Secret Agent, 8th Special Forces North Korea. Born in 1971 Speciality: Sniper Classification: Confidential OP Agents in charge: Ryu, Lee The list of cases June 1993 - Kim Nuclear-Physics Doctor November 1994 - Cho Nat'I Defense Director July 1993 Gas explosion in Seoul January 1995 - Yoe Strategist at Nat'l Security May 1996 - Kim Staff at Nuclear Submarine TF October 1996 Inchon Port, South Korea U2 U2 Do you copy, U2? U2.... Do you read me? ! It's already been 6 months since Hee went into hiding. Maybe she was taken back due to the risk of exposure. Hi! Hi! I dreamt about U2 last night. He said he'd busted Hee. Goodbye.... You know this song? I don't like music. You know that, don't you? September 1998 Seoul May I help you? I was having a little chat with my buddies. About what? Love. And? They say love's to stay together until the last moment. They know the pain of separation. I bet they do, seeing each other sold off. Have you ever seen fishes cry? How do they cry? Cry in the water, then you'll know how. You're about the same size... as my boyfriend. Have you ever seen fishes laugh? No. It's already been a year. It was raining then, too. You came back the next day to buy a fish bowl with a CD for me. I said, "May I help you..." "Anapus" Yeah, you said "Anapus" instead of "Anabus". "Bus!" A total stranger gave me a CD I really liked. It was coincidental, but you felt so close as if I'd known you for a long time. Did you go to the Alcohol Cessation Class today? The doctor said that I no longer had to come. Take a guess. Ki... Ki... You're unbelievable! They're 'Kissingurami.' Kissingurami... If one of them dies, the other dies, too. They dry up from malnutrition or their scales fall off. Don't let them die. Feed them once a day and change the water... Every 5 days. They don't survive where it's dark and cold. Keep the lights on all the time. I might do the same thing if you left me alone. Kissingurami. Breaking news. Under the slogan of "Reunification of two Koreas," A team of North and South for the World Cup 2002 was launched earlier today. A friendly game will be held on the 25th not only to pick players for the team but to mark a turning point in history where the two leaders of South and North Korea get together. The president of Korea Football Organization said the game would speed up the reconciliation of the two Koreas. Yes? We were supposed to meet. Change of plans. The 3rd floor, electronics. What happened? Not clear yet. Any barrier? Around the third block. Take the outside! Calm down. I'm a secret agent. Dead end on 4th street. Against the wall! Why did you run? She was there. She knew about our rendezvous. Who? Where? He's down! It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Please don't put ashes into the fish bowl. My goldfish smokes, too. Dr. Min, Identified It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Hey, oddball! Lim was the head of black-market weapons dealers. We knew nothing about his organization. When'd he call you? Right before I called you. The perpetrator was there at the same time. Considering the fact that he was hit at the scene he wasn't being followed. Otherwise, he would've been killed before the rendezvous. My life is on the line. I'll tell you the details later but it's about my client who is onto something very dangerous. Let me tell you again. If you don't protect me.... His life was being threatened during the weapons deal. Our priority is to find out who his client was. We went to meet him right after the call. The big question is how'd this client know we were meeting? Autopsy reports came out. What's up? It's Wednesday. Get the smell off the bowl. Don't put cookies into it, then. You can't feed the fish the same thing all the time. From the 1st to 4th cervical vertebrae one bullet went through between the 3rd and 4th and the other penetrated between right and left atrium which killed him instantly. The heart was completely destroyed. I've never seen anything like this before. The former coroner has. Dr. Kim, Director Cho. They're all the same. She's at it again. Goodbye.... Chodo Harbour, North Korea For the Victory! For the Victory! No more corrupt politicians! No more 50 years of separation, disgrace, and humiliation! We're writing a new history of Korea! And the beginning of it is in your hands! I expect to see you all again under a unified sky. Good luck. For the unification. For the unification. Team 4, go! Don't move! Hand's up! He left nothing related to his business. No wonder. They destroy everything that could be used against them. It's hard to find any connection between Lim and Hee. Then, we're back to square one. People around Lim? Lim took care of the business by himself. Nobody knows anything. Hee's been hiding out for over a year. I don't get it. A weapon's dealer was her first target. It's too easy for her. Aren't we overreacting? Could it be a gang war imitating her? Nobody can imitate her. We need to find out what she wanted from him and why he contacted us. What did Hee ask him for? What was the information Lim tried to give us? If she hasn't gotten what she wanted from him yet she'll try to get it through other channels. We need to focus on the fact that North Korea's using her again even though her identity has been exposed to us. You two are the best agents we've got. Finish her at your first priority. What do you think was their relationship? Why'd she approach him? I guess she needed something from him. That's it. That thing she asked him to get her. That's the key. What'd he mean by something dangerous? You look awfully serious. We're late, come on. I got delayed at the beauty parlor. Have you waited long? Not long. How do I look? We'd better hurry. Did you sleep well? Did I snore? I was worried about that. Were you tired? He always sleeps at the theater. I wish you had somebody for times like these. You two are here. He isn't into anything. He doesn't even like to sing or listen to the music. Really? I grew up near the airport cause my old man was a pilot. So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm. Nothing's music to my ears. Then, what do you like? I like looking for people. Lately I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend. What's she like? You want to take a look ? She's cute. Why did you break up? So I can look for her. Gosh, I'm sorry! No problem. Wipe it off with this. Here... I am really sorry. It's OK. It's punishment for dozing off in the theater. Excuse me. When is your wedding day? 20th of next month. When are you gonna tell her? You can't hide it forever. I don't wanna burden her. What if you die on a mission? What about her? I can't, anyway. Why not? You don't trust her? Don't be sentimental. Let me ask you something. If Hee and I point a gun at each other and you have to choose one. Who would that be? Hee, of course. I'd save your ass cause I can bust her later. You don't get many chances. You don't get many friends you'd die for, either. It's not too late, man. You can change your mind. Cheers. I'm all wet! Wait till that stain gets washed off. I've had it. Give me money for laundry. Ask her. I'll pay for it when I do that again. Aim well next time. I'll try. Where are all the taxis? Let's take a subway. In this rain? You're wet anyway. I don't have a girl to take care of me if I catch a cold. Come on, let's run! You sure? It's gonna rain all night long. I like it. I don't think they do. It's bedtime for them. Looks like the rain woke them up. What are they saying? They want us to keep quiet. How are your Kissingurami? They fight a lot. One minute, they hate each other next minute they're hugging, kissing and stuff. They're always like that. When I go out, I get worried about them. If I am not there, you have to take care of them. I don't think I can. I can't even handle 'Kissing' and 'Anabus' at home That's why you have to learn more. To live with them, you have no choice. Your sweater is almost done. I hope it looks good on you. What should I get you for the wedding? All I want is whatever happens to me, you love and never leave me. That's all. Because you're the only one who truly understands me. shiri Step 1 On! On the 17th, 1 million dollars were transferred from Lim's account into Kim's. Kim? He looks most suspicious on the transaction record. Who's he? Nat'l Defense lab researcher. Kim speaking. Yes. Okay. As a part of new weapons system being developed we launched the CTX project last year. If Kim was doing business with the weapon's dealer chances are very high that it was CTX. Tell me more about the CTX. CTX is a new type of energy originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab we've been working on turning it into a weapon. At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions but the test we did last month was successful. People at your agency know about this, too. It'll bring a sensational change to the military weapon system. How's it different from the conventional bombs? It's a liquid bomb. What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices. Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than any other bombs you've ever seen. What if a black-market dealer got it? He could get the information on it but not the CTX itself. Because you need 3 or 4 approvals to release it. If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over he would've returned the money. Where's it made and kept? That's confidential, sorry. But CTX's never been released until today. How are you so sure? When CTX is released it goes through 3 authorization checkpoints and this morning everything was in order. You're saying it was released this morning? For the weapon show tomorrow, it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak. Sera Mike 1, stop at Dongsan service area. Will Hee turn up? She wants the CTX. She wouldn't miss this chance. Why are they bothering us? They want two secret agents to ride with us. What for? What the hell is that? Sir, We need to check the vehicles. I wasn't informed of this. What's going on? We got a report of a possible interception of CTX. Your permit and ID, please. CTX's safe with us. Get out of the way. Didn't you hear me? I asked for your permit and ID, didn't I? This is Sera Mike 1, we're stopped at a checkpoint. I don't have time for this. I'll fax it to you. If you resist, we'll have to arrest you. What did you say? We'll have to arrest you... or kill you. Are you nuts? I'm fine. Are you out of your mind? You fucking moron! Are you fucking nuts? Wait, look at this. What base are you from? Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea! Sera Mike 1, Do you copy? They've been hit! It's worse than we thought! It's a bomb, run! Hee asked Lim for the CTX and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over. But when they realized it couldn't be done they planned to intercept it on the road. In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered, along with 20 of our armed guards. How much CTX was taken? About a gallon. It is enough to blow up an entire city. Any leads on the interceptors? Not yet, sir. Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee. But why would North Korea do that in a time of reconciliation? We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle but the gunfire at the scene makes me think that they're highly-trained North Korean militants. Their military system is falling fast. We can't rule out the possibility that they were a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose. The question is what are they planning to do with the CTX. If it blows up in Seoul, we're finished. Why not make an official statement to the North-Korean government? Not until we have solid proof. We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX. As you all know, it may explode without the detonator. And no devices can detect the liquid itself. If they utilize those traits, expect the worst. There's no way to predict when, where, or how it's gonna go off. Dinner? I don't feel like it. Is the meeting over? Little while ago. Anything special? Ready to order? Hi! Hi! Beer, please. OK. What about the scene? An inspection of the scene was delayed and the bodies were just taken to headquarters. The film will be handed over tomorrow. Any leads? Just bodies and shells. Isn't it strange? Anything else? This is the third time. Lim, Kim.. This time CTX was intercepted. We went to see Lim right after the call... .. and to the lab right after we got the report. We're always a step behind. It's like they were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Don't jump to the conclusion. Today we went to the lab without notice. Kim didn't even know that we were coming and he got killed 5 minutes before we got there. If that's the case... it's obvious. Only director Ko and I knew about those killings and CTX. And you made the report. shiri 1's entered. It's been a long time. At 09:00. With sunglasses on. You've changed a lot. It's been six years. How's my family? They're fine. I miss them. Completion is near. You'll meet them soon. A barrier is in the way. Get rid of it. Target? Kissingurami. Finish the job before the completion. Acknowledged. For the unification. For the unification. We're always a step behind. They were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Hello? It's me, Ho. Can I see you tomorrow? Sure, what's going on? I have a favor to ask. Call me at the Police Agency tomorrow. OK. See you tomorrow. I'll call you. What are you doing there? You scared me! You just got here? No, earlier. I cleaned and did the laundry. Nothing was in the refrigerator. We ran out of coffee so I went grocery shopping. What's wrong? You don't look so good. Just busy at work. Why didn't you call? I was gonna leave soon. Dinner? Not yet. I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. What are we having? Your favorite. You wanna take a shower? After dinner. I think it's done. Let it simmer. Can you hand me the cloth pins and hangers from the sofa? I couldn't find the pins. It's OK. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed up yet. Let me help you pack up. OK. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up by yourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me. I'll never drink again because I have you. A soccer team of South and North Korea returned today to the Seoul Training Center after training in Pohang with North Korean officials coming through 'Panmunjum'. The North Korean President Lee and officials will deliver a message on a permanent peace.... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color you can't tell the difference from water with the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight over 6000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction but without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. If you expose it to both light and heat nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200cc, so everything within the radius of 1 kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, if the sphere becomes red it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops, it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years. You're an oddball. I am not, sir. Admit it! No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fish bowls. Agent Ryu, come to room 17. I gotta go. Find CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognizes him? Don't you remember, Ryu? His name is Park. A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked he was the only one that escaped from the plane a painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park... All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th special forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from Nat'l Defense. Agent Yoon! Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th special forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th special forces intercepted CTX, why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for they say they want peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. If they wanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of Korea'd be much easier. Why'd they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb? That's difficult to answer. Hee is key to all this. We don't have time. We'll find a way. What do you see? Can't even tell me? Maybe the solution is much closer than we think. What do you mean? Hee could be close by. Hey, you! What the hell are you doing here? I am looking for the man's room. Are you fucking blind? Didn't see the sign "RESTRICTED AREA"? Hey, you hear me? I sure did. Watch your mouth. Take care. How have you been? Bored to death. I feel more insecure when it's so quiet. I need some backup. What about your agency? The air isn't very clear there. What do you mean? I think there's a leak. This is the only way. It must be very stressful. It'll get better. When do you need it? Tomorrow. I'm coming, too. Sorry, no married man. Time and place? I'll call you. All right, then. Ho! We'll talk later. How's your friend? He'll live. I am glad to hear that. Have a seat. Who else knew you two were meeting? It was very personal. I didn't tell anybody. Lim, Kim, Ho.... Hee is very nearby. There must be a leak. Nobody knows that for sure. Internal affairs are on it. You don't trust your men? Do you trust me? Traps could be anywhere. Maybe there's a hole in the security system but that possibility is almost zero. Don't share the information with anybody. Not even with your partner, Lee. Traps under your feet are hard to see. I'm the Director in charge. I'm Park, of the 8th special forces. I want to talk to my old friend. Thanks for calling me friend. I was gonna send you a coffin, but you were lucky. Disappointed with Hee's shooting. Save it. We can take you out anytime. Maybe I'll take you out first. So, you've become a man. You know where I am? Young drunk kids here yelling on the street.... While people in the north are starving to death. People here have wastes building up in their bellies. What an unfair world. Listen, friend. We have 10 CTXs placed all over Seoul. I'll call you 30 minutes before each of them goes off. You'd better find them before people get hurt. What do you want? Slow down, friend. The first one is on the roof of the Golden Tower. You have exactly 30 minutes. You know the fish named shiri? It's a Korean aboriginal fish, living in crystal streams. Though they're separated with the country divided some day they'll reunite in the same streams. Should I buy some for your girlfriend's fish shop? Why not. Stay alive until then. He's on the move. Clear! Found it! Hyun? Don't tell anybody you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear People of the South Today marks an important and joyous moment in our history. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissension and to open up a new era of understanding. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center I'm on my way. Be there. On my way. He's wearing a black jacket and a black cap. Anything else? That's all. I'll be right there. You look good in a black jacket. Anyone else coming? Hee, maybe. So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tape the phones. So, if they show up I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a 5-shot semiautomatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. 3 targets went inside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! Been a long time. Good to see you. Payback time for the flight 257. Look who's talking. You killed 7 of my men. You left your men behind. Cause I have a job to finish. You wanna know what it is? I'll ask Hee. It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! Get back! 'She used only two bullets.' 'In both cases, you were in her range.' 'lf I were her...' '... I would have used the other three bullets.' Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital. Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island. Why'd you come here? They ambushed us. OP set a trap. Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. Thanks to you, we lost two of our men! I did what I could do. Yeah, you saved my life. What do you want? You've changed. Of course I have... from Hee to Hyun. Not only in appearance, but inside as well! I don't need a betrayer. We've waited 10 years for this moment. In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance and buried our youth in the tomb of history. If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings finish it here. I was stupid... thinking I could be Hyun. But I am just Hee who has to kill her man. I failed to change my inside. Let go! We have a job to finish. Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking because her immune system has dropped and make it quick. There she is. with the yellow sweater. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Are you from the public health center? I am looking for this girl. Anything happened to her? She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house 2 years ago and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me from Japan but I think she misplaced my number otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left I cried my eyes out. She hugged me, and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know what she was sorry about... She didn't do anyting to me Prepare 10 million dollars and a 7 47 Jumbo at the airport by 2 o'clock. No mistakes. The Golden Tower was just the beginning. I hope I don't have to use the other 9 CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies into the bowl. Two of them died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies any more. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsy is needed.... If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main Stadium at 2 P.M today. With the Presidents of two nations present... Hi, I'm here to collect for the newspaper. How much? 7 dollars. It's all right. Bye. What are you doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had 4 goldfishes on my desk with 4 goldfishes, and 2 of them died today. At first, I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong 'SU300' inside their bodies is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997 When Hee disappeared, you were in Japan. You didn't need a fake passport coming back in because you became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy, Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me ask you this. Did you really love him? Over here! I planted a bug in your car... Will you.... forgive me? Stay with me! The ambulance is on the way! I.... messed up. You're going to be Okay. You've always been the best! This won't.... kill me.... This won't.... Stay with me! The 7 47's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from the terminal 2. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want 10 million dollars. They were bluffing. Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium! Go back to Headquarters. Don't worry about the stadium. Not even a drop of water can pass through security. It won't work. Listen to me! You lost your partner today. Go back, it's an order! I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule, sorry. Your attention, please! No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thank you for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. If I were in the airport, no doubt I could prove myself. But what the hell am I doing here, watching the gate? Both teams are now entering the stadium. What are you.... How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim and Lee have just arrived! Let's give them a big hand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. / Turn the lights on? Who's in charge of the lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Why would anybody do that in a broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Did you turn the lights on in section 3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regular day, you know. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Substation Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn off the lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 011-244-1616... Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can't you hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you say were the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! Sometimes history needs a craziness to help it. What do you want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are not your barriers. When we're done here, our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights off now! That's not what the people of this land want. They don't want another war to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country. I remember very well. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it..." When you sing this song our people in the North are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters are being sold off for fucking 100 dollars! Have you ever seen parents eating the flesh of their dead kids? With cheese, coke, and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. A soccer game to unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years of deception. We're opening up a new history of Korea. 4 minutes to go. CTX will detonate soon. History will judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights off in section 3-G? Turn them off! Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off. Turn them off! We're dying together here. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell Turn the lights off? You know where Hee is? She's in the audience, laughing at you. 'You know where Hee is? ' 'She's in the audience, laughing at you.' O2, this is O3.... Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the President! Gate 52, he's on his way to the parking lot. Get out! Nat'l Defense spokesman revealed a war scenario attempted by.. ..North Korea's 8th special forces. They sent 5 secret agents including Park into South Korea.... Things about oddballs! One. Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning like you don't. I am not an oddball. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? March, last year. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn't you ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fish bowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a whole year? What do you want me to say? Answer the question. We don't trust anybody. Even the fellow agents you share life with but she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? It's not like you. Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a Goddess with 6 heads in Greek myths. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra of our times the reality of separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pager Voice Mail. You have one new message. Ryu it's me, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTX's planted in the lights over the Royal Box. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor. I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... ...is all of my life. With you I was neither Hyun nor Hee but just me. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu... I miss you so much. I miss you.... How have you been? It's you again. Did you meet her? No. It would have been nicer if you came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. Thanks a lot. If one of them dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised. She knew everything about fish. In fact... She stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating, you have to be alert. She's so bad with chopsticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. Clear Found it! Hyun? Don't tell any body you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear people of the South... today marks an important and joyous moment in our history.. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissension... and to open up a new era of under standing. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and he wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center. I'm on my way.

I think she misplaced my number. Otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left, I cried my eyes out. She hugged me... and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know... what she was sorry a tiny queen, against me, a dashing terror of the high seas. En garde! Oh, dear! Poor defenseless me. What is a girl to do? Now, steady on. Now careful. Do you know why I really hate pirates? Childhood trauma, was it? Bitten by a pirate when you were a baby? Beard envy? It's because you're out-of-date. You're dinosaurs! All that "romance of the seas" guff! Right, where were we? Look at you. You should be extinct. Along with your little friend! Pity you can't eat pirates, really. But you'd probably taste of barnacles. Whereas, dear little Polly here is going to be absolutely delicious! Mr. Bobo? Give me back my dinner! - Captain, catch! - Number Two! Sorry, Vickie. Dodo is off the menu. No, no, stop! Stop! Stop! I'm being squashed by giant barrels of vinegar! Good work, Chuck. Number Two, what are you doing here? How did you find me? Where are the lads? Don't worry, they're on the case. It's all thanks to Mr. Bobo here. He rowed halfway across the ocean to tell us what you were up to. And, you know, I figured you tend to end up wrapped in sausages facing certain death at about this point in an adventure. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Listen, Number Two, I... I realize I let you down. Sorry. I let everybody down. You know, I've... Well, I've done some pretty appalling things in my piratical career. Like that time I used babies as squid bait. Or that other time I thought it would be okay to let a turtle drive the boat. But the thing is... I mean, what I'm trying to say is... You decided to single-handedly take on Queen Victoria's flagship, in order to rescue Polly. Yes, I'm afraid I did. That's terrifically idiotic. Yes. It's also the reason why me and the lads, well, we still think you're the best pirate on the seven sea... Gadzooks! No! Polly! Oh, no, you don't. Captain? Kiss your beaky little friend goodbye. That's it, Polly. Snip-snip. Come on, little dodo. Bitey-bite. The dumpy lady's got Polly! Snip-snip. Bite it! Bite it, you stupid bird! Bite it! No! My dodo! Polly! My dinner! Barnacles. Well done, sir. Hey! Wah-hey, Captain! Fair play to you, sir. Wah-hey! This is our most unexpectedly heartwarming adventure ever. You'll swing for this! Curse you! And after you've done swinging, I'll chop your head off! I'll put it in a cannon and fire it into the sun! Does that mean he's not pardoned anymore? "Pardoned"? You'll be outlawed across the globe! There'll be a higher price on your head than any pirate before you! Welcome back, Captain. - See ya! - Bye! Bye-bye! Well, it's been a pleasure, Charles. Good luck with the science. - Thank you, Captain. - And just a little tip, grow yourself a beard. It'll make your face look less lumpy. 100,000 doubloons. Not bad, eh, Mr. Bobo? That... I... - Is this a bit of squid tentacle? - Yeah. And that's my earwax. I keep telling you, it's never been about the trophies or the treasure. It's about who you are, inside. I say, you're not... Not a woman disguised as a man, are you, Number Two? No. Because that does happen surprisingly often at sea. Well, come on, you coves. Those treasure chests won't plunder themselves. Hoist the flag! Aye, aye, Captain! Set a course for adventure! You see? I told you. Didn't I tell you? Just added on for decoration, my foot. Admiral Collingwoodl Well, Admiral? Great news, Your Majesty! The French are defeated at last. Also the Russians, the Portuguese, the Chinese and the Welsh. Then our navy rules the ocean. Almost entirely, Your Majesty. "Almost"? Unfortunately, just here, we're still having a little trouble with pirates. What does it say on my royal crest, Admiral? "I hate pirates," ma'am. Exactly. Hate them. With their idiotic shanties! And their ridiculous hats! And their endless, blasted roaring! I want them sunk, Admiral! Scuppered, smashed, fed to the sharks. Do you hear me? I hate pirates! Ifstheloofing. It's the cutlasses. Ifstheloofing! It's the cutlasses! Loofing! Cutlasses! Loofing! Sorry, Captain. We were just discussing what's the best bit about being a pirate. You were, were you? I suggested it might be the looting. Whereas I contend it's the shiny cutlasses. And I thought it was the chance to catch exotic diseases. Well, you're, all of you, wrong. The best bit about being a pirate isn't the looting or the cutlasses. It's not the grog or the scurvy. Or the scantily clad mermaids. The best bit about being a pirate is Ham Night! Ham Night! Ham Night! Ham! On your nose. Go, Captain. Go, Captain. Hey! Hey! It's like a meat ballet. - To Ham Night! - Ham! - And to the Pirate Captain! - Pirate Captain! Pirate Captain! How was that, Number Two? You've still got it, Captain. I'd take a jellyfish in the face for that man. Okay, now, shush, shush, shush. Settle down, lads. Shush. - Lads, lads. - Pirates! - It's not all about me. - Don't be modest. No,no,no. Behind every captain with glittering eyes -and a luxuriant beard... - Luxuriant! That's what it is. ...There's a crew of briny rogues. Briny rogues! Sure, some of you are as ugly as a sea cucumber. Will you get away with ya? Some of you are closer to being a chair or coat rack than a pirate. And some of you are just fish I've dressed up in a hat. But you're still the best crew a captain could wish for. Don't forget Polly. And not forgetting, never forgetting Polly. The finest parrot to sail the seven seas. Come on, girl. I love her beady eyes. Who's the feathery heart and soul of our boat? Is it you? Is it you? Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It's definitely you, isn't it? Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Right. Where was I? Ah, yes! Ah, yes. Important announcement. By order of the Pirate King himself... The Pirate of the Year Awards? Are you going to... Are you going to enter again? That I am, Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate. I know it hasn't worked out perfectly for the last... -20 year. -20 years, yeah. Exactly, Pirate with Gout. 20 years. It might be a bit more. 21, 22... Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you. - You were very good, though. - Shush! The point is, every time I've entered, I've failed to win. So by the sheer law of maths... Maths. ...I must have a really good chance this time. Where is she? I'm sorry, I was wrong! You need a little beating before you talk? Where is she? I don't know... where my mom is. It hurts! It hurts? It was nicer when you weren't around, huh? Where is your mother! Where is... your mother! Lee Tae Soo. Lee Tae Soo. You are under arrest for murder. -Get up! - No! I didn't kill him! I didn't kill him! Hey... wake up. - Hey! - I was wrong... I was wrong... I told you to take him away quietly... How am I supposed to live here now? Your daughter is hurt. That much won't kill her. Wait... lady! If you're that worried about her, take her and raise her yourself! [Summer, 1997] [America - Fall, 1998] Let's get some help! Hey, man... are you alright? Jung Woo! Jung Woo! Your dad's here! My father? [Episode 1] - Hey! How was the game? - It was perfect. Look how you've grown. Wow... you're starting to look like a man now. Where's my father? Oh... he's really busy with work. Here... Ivy League Camp Tour. Take a look around the campus, and decide which university you'd like to attend. I'm not a genius. I can't get into a university yet. I'm only 15 years old. Madame requested it from Seoul, so there should be a lot of other Korean kids. - Make some friends while you're at it. - Is father still alive? Jung Woo... Please relay to the Madame that I'll enjoy the tour. Reporters will be coming, too. So, why not just wait at home? It's been six months since I've seen him. Why don't we get going so we won't be late? Which car do I need to ride in? Jung Woo! What are you doing... Have you been well? Why don't we get going so we won't be late? There are certain things that parents don't like to say to their kids. You should know there's a reason when I didn't call you. For such a bright child, how can you not notice things like that? If you're uncomfortable, why don't you stay in the car? Have I committed a sin or something? Get out of the car. I'm sure your father will be really glad. Jung Woo, you just stay here. Madame, please come this way. Did you come to the hospital to visit your husband? Where are you going? Is that true? Please make a statement! They're coming out! How is his condition now? Father. Father! It's all over... let's go. Jung Woo, why are you here? What about school? I haven't been able to get a hold of you in so long. I'm sorry. No... I was wrong. Don't scold Jung Woo. It's my fault for not communicating with him. I didn't want him to worry. - He must've been so worried... - Don't treat him like a child. - He's fifteen, so he's already all grown up. - That's what I mean. Jung Woo should know what's going on at home now. He's our one and only son. Take him home. - Director Nam, stop the car. - Where are you going now? No! No! No! No! No... If you take him now, the Chairman will die! Chairman! No! Chairman! Please calm down! Nurse Jung, thank you for all your hard work. Take some time off for a while. I'm going to call the police. If something happens to the Chairman... you're going to become a murderer. Are you going to put me away as a murderer this time? What are you talking about right now? Do you know how I feel right now? I feel like I've been bitten by a well-trained dog. It should just docility eat the food thats given. How dare it bite its' owner... Where's the money you stole after you put me away? If this is about money... ask the Chairman. Stop treating me like a dog! I... even gave birth to your father's child! That's why even if it's for the sake of your child... you shouldn't make me angry. You... Why don't you get going? I'm sure he's not dead yet. Joon! Joon... Joon! Joon... Who do you think will be next? - Where is my money! - What have you done to my Joon? Han Tae Joon! Han Tae Joon... Han Tae Joon! Sir... Go find him immediately! Mom... Coming... not coming... Coming... not coming... You've suffered a lot being on the run after committing your crime, get some rest now. Why don't you say something, too? You have to send them on their way with well wishes. So, they won't get cursed. Just say something whatever it is, so that he can be on his way! Now, Dad... will never be back again, right? What? It really... is over now, right? Look. Can't you tell by just looking at this? You deserve it! How awful you must've been for your own child to say something like that? I'm not going to sleep because I'm afraid that I'll see you in my dreams! I'm too afraid that I'll see you in my afterlife after I'm dead... so I'm not going to die and I'm going to live here for the next thousand years! From now on... today is both of our birthdays. Since your awful father is no longer around, let's live a new life, okay? Lift up your glass. Lift it up! I heard that Lee Tae Soo was executed yesterday. I'm glad he's dead. That's his daughter, isn't it? How can he kill someone's else's child when he has a child of his own? That's good! Eat. Eat this! Eat this and grow up fast and go earn me some money. You don't have to move around to different schools to avoid your father now... so buckle down and study hard. Say something! Just say somethine, stop mumbling! After all that I've done to raise you instead of just abandoning you somewhere... Hey... if it hadn't been for you... I would've stayed hidden somewhere and lived my life not getting beaten all the time. - Stop drinking so much. - Leave me alone! I can't believe she's out here drinking like that... What are you looking at? You think this is a show? Don't you even read the papers? That famous killer is now dead! Give it a rest! Mom... Stop tiptoeing around. Did you kill him? Did I kill him? Four times nine is thirty-six... four times eight is thirty-two... Four times seven is twenty-eight... four time six is... Four times five... is twenty... Four times four... So that's what you look like. Don't go. I didn't mean to interrupt you. Do you live in this neighborhood? I live in this neighborhood, too. How fascinating... [Lee Soo Yeon] My name is Han Jung Woo. I'm fifteen. Are you by any chance... are you mute? Then what is it? You don't... know who I am? What? You said you lived in this neighborhood. Should I know who you are? Are you... famous? Are you on TV? Are you a celebrity? What is it? What is it? - I only drank a little... - Don't lie to me! I'm not drunk at all! I only had a little bit to drink! - Why don't you go live in a bottle? - I told you, I'm not drunk! Huh? Hey! Red uniform! Famous girl! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! What is it? I can't stand not knowing something. Just who are you? You're not talking again. Then... should I try to guess? That's cold! What are you doing? Come here. You're getting soaked in the rain. I said come here. Wait... Hey... hey! Ugh, that's cold. Mom... there's a weird kid. He says he lives in this neighborhood, but he doesn't know who I am. He keeps talking to me. Lee Soo Yeon... He keeps calling out my name. Not number twenty-seven, but Lee Soo Yeon. I'm telling you, he called me by my name. He says his name is Han Jung Woo. Han Jung Woo. Be quiet... be quiet. There it is. Use this on your way home. Use this on your way home, so you don't get wet. You're... soaked. It's okay. I'm already soaked anyways. I'm not afraid getting wet in the rain. Here. Thanks. I'll give it back to you tomorrow. - Huh? - I said, I'll give it back to you tomorrow. Are you... going to come back here again tomorrow? I need to give you your umbrella back. It really isn't that bad now that I'm already soaked. I'll be back. Hey... Yeah? What is it? What's wrong with you? - What? - Were you drinking? Why are you being so loud first thing in the morning? Where are you going? I'm going out to meet a friend. - You don't have any friends. - It's just someone I know. I'll be back. I wonder if she's finally lost her mind... - Come back home quickly! - Okay. Hey. Are you hurt? Are you in there alone? Are there any adults home? We've searched everywhere... but with all the rain last night, we couldn't find any trace of him. So what? We'll search for him some more. What should we do with the woman? I hear she keeps asking for the child. Tell her that we'll bring him to her if she tells us where the money is. So go find me the boy dead or alive. Yes. Yes, Doctor Kim. What? I understand. If we were to treat him quietly, it would be better to do it at home. Yes. I'll be right back. Stay home and play with the teddy bear, okay? No! I want to come with you. Not today. I thought you came home to see your father, where are you going? I have to give this back to someone. Father's not home yet, is he? That's right. Your father's not home. But, your grandfather just has passed away. - Excuse me? - Why are you so shocked? You've never once even seen your grandfather. Ah Reum... stay here and play with the teddy bear, okay? Yes. Jung... Han... Jung... Woo... He's coming... He's not coming. He's coming... He's not coming. What did I tell you? Didn't I tell you that she won't talk easily? Should I go see her? If I try to convince her woman to woman... Don't worry about things here. Honey... don't overexert yourself, okay? Didn't you say that father's collapsed? He's not at the hospital? You can't leave your spot. Hurry up and get back there. Mom will be there soon, too. Can you stop with that whole mom thing when my father's not here? Where's my father? He... isn't around right now. That's why... I'm asking what the reason for that is? Are you asking because you really don't know? Why do you think he went into the penitentiary? It's to protect the money... the money. - That's all your father knows. - Don't speak of my father that way! Why are you getting angry when all I did was to answer your question? This is why I can't say anything to you. And also... if you don't like me calling myself your mother, hurry up and go back to America. I want to live my life without having to see you, too. You're not even surprised. I heard that father was asking for you even with his last dying breath... But, I guess you still don't understand the situation. There's nothing left for you to believe in anymore. Do you want to rot away in here for the rest of your life? Don't you want to see your child? No matter how much you hated your father. Seeing how you ran over here instead of attending his wake... you must've been really desperate. My Hyung Joon... you don't know where he is, do you? Han Tae Joon, if you want your money... go bring me my child. I'm pretty sure I told you not to make me angry. Threats like that won't work with me. Then we have no other choice. If I can't have the money... then no one else can have it. Han Tae Joon! The Chairman gave it to me! I didn't steal it, the Chairman gave it to me. Because he knows just how cruel you are. He gave it to me to protect Hyung Joon. If anything happens to my Hyung Joon... you won't... see a single penny of that money. - Sir... - The kid has it. Use whatever method you can to find him! I understand. Can you leave the room for a minute? I have to change her clothes. Where's Hyung Joon? Hyung Joon... is with me. Hyung Joon injured his leg. - I did what I could do... - Is he... - still alive? - Yes. But... I don't know what to do on my own... If you were to... give him the money. The Chairman... is dead. The only thing we have left to trust now... is that money. If that money is taken from us, too... then, Han Tae Joon... will kill me, my Hyung Joon... and you! We'll all be dead. - What do I... - Just do as I tell you. How can I... what can I... Han Tae Joon's son... you need to get him. Chairman. Clean this up. Don't ever do what you want without my permission again. Excuse me? I'm telling you not to quit your studies and fly back here... just because you're wrapped up in your emotions. - I'm sorry. - You'll only be forgiven once. Remember that. Yes, Father. Is there a problem? No. I'm fine now that I've seen you. Is it okay for me to come back during school vacation? - If you don't want to go, don't go. - Excuse me? - I can do that? - I'm different from your grandfather. I don't trust anyone around me. My son, Han Jung Woo... you're the only one I trust. Know that it's a blessing to be born as Han Tae Joon's son. Don't disappoint me. Hey. Kid, are you asleep? Are you sick? Are you okay? If you're okay, look at me. Kid! If you're not asleep, look at me. So, you weren't asleep. Have you eaten? What are you doing? - There's a little kid in there alone... - Don't interfere, and just go. The kid seems to be in a lot of pain... Why are you saying that you can't reopen the investigation? What's the point of looking into something that's already over? You said you got the confession from the real perpetrator. I'm the one who put him in there. I can't just bury it like this. If I made a mistake... I want to take responsibility for it. You think this is something that could end with you taking responsibility for it? When the media is going to be all over it? Do you want to see it speculated all over the news? We can take care of it quietly, and wrap up the case. We have to at least notify the victims, the perpetrators and the family! And what if someone opens their mouth? You think I'm doing this to save my own neck? Lee Tae Soo was a convicted felon. If you have the time to feel any guilt over someone like that... go solve another one of the current cases. - Captain... - Let it go. Stop flapping your trap, and make a joke out of the station. Are you... looking for someone? Yeah. By any chance... do you know who Lee Soo Yeon is? Who? Who's Lee Soo Yeon? - Her! 'Number twenty-seven'! - What? That 'Number twenty-seven' isn't even going to transfer to another school? She's really shameless. Why aren't you going in? It'sbecauseof 'Number twenty-seven'. Don't you think she's really shameless? Can't you just make her transfer out to another school? - She's scary. - She's humiliating. Kids from other schools teases me for going to... the same school as a murderer's daughter. I told you kids not to be like this. And... what's with 'Number twenty-seven'? Hurry up and get in there! - I don't even like to address her! - She has a knife. What if she stabs me? Hey... Teacher... my stomach hurts. Can I go to the infirmary? Okay. Go and rest. The rest of you, get in the classroom! Han Jung Woo... - Where in American are you from? - I want to go study abroad, too. The exams here are really difficult. - I heard kids there are bad at math. - Were you really popular there? Have you been to many places? I really want to go... Are all kids in America as good looking as you? 'Number twenty-seven'... her dad's a murderer. He killed two people. I'm more scared of 'Number twenty-seven'. She helped her father hide so that he could escape. All the people in this neighborhood almost died because of her. You should be careful of her. Where are you going? How does he know 'Number twenty-seven'? He is really cute. - Why are you doing this? - You almost killed us during basketball. I thought my shoulder was going to fall off! Hey... keep your eyes down! I don't want to fight. - Say it with words. - What to do? We don't know how to speak in English. Watch yourself from now on. Why you asshole! - What the heck? - What is this? Sorry. I was just trying to clean up. Just stay down. They'll get bored and stop beating you. - Will you help me? - Do you think I'm crazy? How shitty... Watch yourself. Are you okay? Why are you stopping? It was just starting to get fun! Hurts! It hurts! Han Jung Woo... It... It's not me. I'm... not... going to kill anyone. Use this on your way home. It's going to hurt more if you get your wounds wet in the rain. Here. - Han Jung Woo... - You... Why are you doing this to me? Why do you keep doing this to me? If I just ignored you, then just take the cue and go away! I wanted to give you your umbrella back. Then it's all set! You're all wet... because of me. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm not crying because I'm sad. It's because of the wind. It's making my eyes water. Han Jung Woo... It's not me. I'm... not... going to kill anyone. I'm not crying because I'm sad. It's because of the wind. It's making my eyes water. Red uniform! Famous girl! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! Use this on your way home. Use this on your way home so you don't get wet in the rain. You're... totally soaked. It's okay. I'm not afraid getting wet since I'm already soaked. Joon... please! If we leave now and get caught, it will be we'll all be over! Don't you want to see your mom? Huh? Joon... please! Please! Who are you? Shut the window! Hey! What are you doing? Mom! Why are you walking around in the rain like a crazy dog... when you have an umbrella? - What is this? - No, Mom! [This belongs to the most famous girl in the neighborhood, Lee Soo Yeon] Oh my... what a thing to brag about. Why don't you just write your father's name on here, too? You must be happy to be so famous. No, Mom. You can't take that! Give it to me... give it back to me! I told you, give it back to me. Red uniform! Famous girl! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! By any chance... - Do you know where Lee Soo Yeon lives? - I don't know. I heard that she's famous in this neighborhood? Um... her father... - So, um... - I told you, I don't know. Ma'am! To Han Jung Woo... even though I'm not going to give you this letter... but still, I want to thank you. If I... wasn't a murderer's daughter... I wonder if you and I could've been friends? Hey... Hey... let's eat. Mom! Are you going to open that in this tiny room while we eat? Move it away! How long are you going to be like this? What am I supposed to do with you showing up here every two weeks? - Let's stop doing this. - Please, stop. Just stop! Let go! Did I kill your husband? Did I kill your child? He has already paid for his crimes, then that should be the end of it! What is it that you want from me? When your child is still alive, what about my child? Give me my son back! Bring my child back to me... Take her! Take her and kill her. Do whatever you want with her! Mom... Mom... Kill her! If that's going to make you feel better, then go ahead! Mom... Mom! She says it'll end once you're dead! Do you know what you've done? Do you know what you've done to my husband and my child? I was wrong... I was wrong... I was wrong... What... what have you done wrong? You stupid girl! What's the point of us living like this? Okay... let have the both of us die today. Let's just die! This is no way to live! Dying is better than living like this! Let's just die! Let's just die... I don't want to! No! Soo Yeon... Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! Lee Soo Yeon! I found you. You think hiding your face is everything? You think hiding your foot is everything? Flower dress... Famous girl... Lee Soo Yeon... Lee Soo Yeon. The murderer's daughter, Lee Soo Yeon... Let's be friends. Subtitles By DramaFever [Next Episode Preview] I heard that it comes true if you kiss during the first snow. Have you ever done it? I'll never ignore you again. I'm sorry. You don't think I can do it? If I don't get out of here right now, Jung Woo will really die! It wasn't me! It's all gone... the bad memories. You can just make new ones now. - All new good memories. - Get Han Tae Joon's son. No... I'm only going to wait one day. Just today... Just for today... be with me. I'm about to go crazy. Subtitles by DramaFever Soo Yeon... - She scares me! - It's so embarrassing! Kids from other schools makes fun of us for... going to the same school as a murderer's kid. Let go! I'm going to kill you all! I told you guys not to do this. And... what's with number 27? It's not me. I... wouldn't... kill anyone. Episode 9 Today... She's not the culprit. There's someone else. Don't blow this thing up. I know. I get it, so where are you? Tell me where you're at right now. You trust me, right? Zoey... I'll bring her in. Please wait. I beg of you. Hey, Han Jung Woo! 68-1671, Detective Han Jung Woo is headed to Shin Sa Dong in pursuit of a suspect. I... wouldn't... kill anyone. I know. I truly do know. Zoey! Have you been well? It's a relief. That you look so healthy. This party is a little too crowded. Detective Han? What brings you here? Why don't we talk for a moment? Do I have to wait again? I don't know if it's because I'm not used to a setting like this... but it's a little uncomfortable. Is that right? - Will you wait for a moment? - I hope it won't be for too long. I'll be right back. Why don't you come with me? I'll just get to the point. Sindo development in Cambodia... I heard that you're the one heading it? I would like to invest in it, too. Mr. Harry Borrison... Ah... You must be lucky. Since I can't be absent from the party for long... I'll just get straight to the point myself. A little while ago... the investment funds from a company named... Shiosa from Japan was supposed to come in... however, it got delayed in the amount of 500 million won. Shiosa... So that's why the Representative Horisa from that company is here? I saw in the hallway. He asked for me to give them some time... And since Horisa and I have a great working relationship already, I'd like to do that... But business is business. I'll discuss your proposal for investment with my boss, and get back to you. We're done here, right? My friends are waiting for me. Why don't we meet somewhere a little quieter next time? Goodbye. Soo Yeon. Lee Soo Yeon. Lee Soo Yeon. How do I look? Detective Han. It's Han Jung Woo. I'm 29 years old. And the name is Han Jung Woo. Don't I look good? Don't cry. It's because the wind is blowing, right? Because it makes your eyes water. [Han Jung Woo, are you seriously going to be like this? ] [I'm on my over there right now.] [If you're having crazy ideas, I'm never going to see you again. Got it? ] Harry... Where are you? - This is Han Jung Woo. - What are you doing? Give it to... I don't have any more time to wait. I'm going to take Zoey with me for now. I'll call you from the road. Look here... Listen to me carefully. The police are going to be here soon. You... are a suspect in a murder case. - What did you say? - Kang Sang Deung's parking garage... You were caught by a nearby vehicle's black-box. It's not me. I know. That's why I came to get you. I have to go to Harry! Get your mind straight! You don't have time for that. When the police gets here... you're going to be arrested. I don't want to... have to put handcuffs on you. First, let's get out of here. Tell me the truth. That's the only way I can help you! I don't want to cause you anymore pain. - No... - Please trust me! Harry... Harry! Harry! Harry... - Harry... - It's okay. No... It's not me! What is it that you're doing right now? Just why are you doing this to us? Han Jung Woo! Zoey Lou. As a suspect for the murder of Kang Sang Deung... - You are placed under arrest. - Harry... Just hang on, Zoey. You trust me, right? Yeah. I'll come for you. I'll take her in. Jung Woo... I'm not going to lose her now. - Harry... Harry! - Leave him. Harry! Harry! Do you know anything about the woman that lives together with Harry Borrison? I heard that she's a new designer who's well established in France. She was arrested by the police at the party. Excuse me? According to Director Yang, she's involved in the Kang Sang Deung's murder. But something about it is nagging me. There's something about her that bothers me. Since I'm supposed to meet with Harry Borrison again in regards to the funds I'll look into it some more. Do it right. If you just half ass it like you did about Kang Hyung Joon... You won't be able to get away from me on your own two feet, got it? Yes, I understand. What happened? Did you set up an appointment with Harry? I told you to make sure he meets with me first before he gets involved with my husband. I did relay the message. And his response to it wasn't bad either. - I'll set up a meeting soon. - Set it up as soon as possible. - Before he changes his mind. - I will do so. Is it that you are kind or just dumb? You startled me! How can you call your own mom dumb? You trust a rodent like that? I'm saying this to you because you're my mom... But don't get involved with Director Nam. - Unless you want to get stabbed in the back. - Don't act like you know everything. You should go throw that teddy bear away. So what if Jung Woo is being nice to you? It's just so that he can get information on our household. He casually asks about how things are going around here, right? Yeah. He was jumping up and down with joy... when I told him about you getting a divorce. He told me to call him as soon as the papers are signed... so that he can move back home. I'm going to bury my bones in this house. Tell him to bury his bones in that house. This is why he won't come home! You have no idea how good Mrs. Kim is to him! Of course, she should! When he left his family and threw away all his fortune... just so he could find her child for her. Why do I feel this way? Eun Joo! Eun Joo! What? Hey... give Jung Woo a call from your phone. I'm not really happy with him lately. You call him yourself. If I call him, he's going to think something is wrong and rush over here like a madman. Are you bragging about having a boyfriend? Hey, the way my heart is pounding right now, something doesn't feel right. Call him and make sure nothing's wrong. The person you are trying to reach is on the other line... He's on the phone. - He must be talking to that fraud. - Fraud? There's someone. His first love fraud who looks absolutely nothing like her. What is that girl talking about? Hi, is this Detective Joo? Is Jung Woo with you? No, he's not. I'm a little busy right now. - I don't know... I'm stepping out. - Who's the suspect in custody? Mother, I have to get going! Wait... What is going on? Something is not right... It's not going to take long. - I'll... - Where's Harry? Give me the cell phone. I need to talk to Harry. You can't. - I'm confiscating it. - Detective Han. You may not like it... but you have to listen to me from now on. Put it on. I don't lend it to just anyone. I put... an invisible spell on this coat. Don't regret it later and just put it on. Reporters are all over the place. Jung Woo... What's your dream? What do you want to be when you grow up? I've never dreamed about my future before... but there is one thing that I wanted to become. An invisible person. I've always wanted to become an invisible person. So that no one in the world can see me. That way... they can't hate me either. But... I'm going to remain visible to you. Even though no one else can see me... Lee Soo Yeon is always going to stay visible to Han Jung Woo. The reason for that... is because I changed the invisibility spell a little bit. Han Jung Woo... is excluded from the spell. You really are stubborn. I told you that we haven't got much time. I told you, there are reporters. If you don't want to be seen, then listen to me. Detective Han! What's it like in there? What do you mean, what's it like? It's full of poop flies in there. I guess I won't be cleaning in there today. Then I guess you can just quit early and go get something to eat. You're always talking about food. Is this her? Seriously... I told you not to hang your life on someone else's business. Even if you were to make a run for it, I can't do anything about it. I can't even grab onto you with my sprained wrist. Hurry up and get going. It's cold out here. Follow me. If the wind tickles your ears... it means that I'm calling out your name. When the wind is blowing, hold out your hand. The wind is blowing right past you, right? Then it means that I'm holding tightly onto your hand. Even if it makes your eyes water, don't cry. Because I'll always... be by your side. An invisible person that only Jung Woo can see... Lee Soo Yeon. You can't come in here, so please form an orderly line. Is this regarding Kang Sang Deung's murder? I heard that it was a woman? I heard that it's linked to Lee Soo Yeon's crime that happened 14 years ago? Please tell us something! - Tell us something. - Give us something. Don't look around like that. You didn't kill him, right? I guess... If my Detective Han said you didn't, then you didn't. I have him pegged as my son-in-law, so don't you eye him, okay? I told you not to be nervous. If you go in the interrogation room in the shape you are in right now... you're going to fess up to crimes that doesn't even exist. This stays between us, but to be honest, killing someone like that isn't even a crime. If I was the mom of the little girl who was hurt by that jerk... I'd invite the guy who killed him over to the house and feed him a nice meal. You sure are pretty. This is the first time I've ever seen a girl who's prettier than my daughter. So don't cry. What is your relationship to Kang Sang Deung? On the day that Kang Sang Deung was murdered... You were caught in the black-box of a parked car in his parking garage. And we've also checked the traffic CCTV at the time of your car accident with him. Team Leader... Go a little easier. Here... Drink some of this. And don't be nervous. I noticed when you saw Kang Sang Deung... you fainted. Kang Sang Deung... the car accident scene wasn't the first time you've seen him, right? Detective Han! When is your attorney going to arrive? Where's Zoey? - Just what in the world is going on? - I asked you this before... The car accident... The victim from that accident took Zoey's cellphone. Zoey was caught in the black-box of a car in the parking garage of the victim... and Zoey's cell phone was the only thing that went missing from the crime scene. What? I don't want her to get hurt during the investigation. I should've been faster. Anyways... get your lawyer here quickly. He's... he's on his way from Hong Kong right now. Don't just wait for him to come, but do something! I can't stall them for too long. I was the one who caused the accident. Zoey doesn't even know the guy! I... don't even know what's what anymore. There's no reason why Zoey would even kill that guy! That's right. So do whatever you have to do to get her out of here and take her home. I'll go catch the real culprit. Then everything will be resolved. You need to hurry. Right up until his death, Kang Sang Deung was using your cellphone. And his last phone call was to Harry Borrison's house. You went to see him after receiving his phone call, right? Zoey? - Who is this? - The one you ran over with your car earlier. Why did you go to Kang Sang Deung's house? - I told you I was going to do it! - If you're going to interfere, get out. I'll do it. I'm not going to mess it up. Kang Sang Deung's murderer... I need to catch the culprit. My dad is a murderer! I'm a murderer's daughter. I can kill you! No! Don't touch her! What's the problem? It's a good thing that he's dead. Zoey... Why are you guys besides yourselves for not being able to catch the culprit? - Isn't it a good thing that he's dead? - You're being recorded right now. Think before you talk. Get yourself together! I saw it in the newspaper. That female student... He raped her... and then threw her into the river, didn't he? A bastard like that deserves to die. Am I the only one who thinks like that? [Luxurious Detective Joo] Yeah... did you get something? What? Are you not believing me right now? Lee Soo Yeon's fingerprint found in the van that kidnapped her 14 years ago... I received a fax of it from the police force that was on the case and had it verified. Yes, it's totally and completely different from Zoey's prints. She's not Lee Soo Yeon. Detective Joo is right. But isn't Lee Soo Yeon dead? Why are you asking for her prints all of a sudden? According to Jung Woo... Lee Soo Yeon has resurrected. Resurrected. You have to write all that down before you can leave. Or you can choose... to answer my questions right now. To Han Jung Woo... If I wasn't the daughter of a murderer... I wonder if we could've been friends? Daughter of a murderer, Lee Soo Yeon. Let's be friends. Are you okay? Why don't we just talk? Seeing how you keep checking your watch... I can see that you must be bored. Things that are said in this room... all of it is being recorded. Any emotional or irrelevant statements... - Will be disadvantageous to you... - You wish I was Lee Soo Yeon, don't you? Then... you wouldn't need to go through all these annoying steps... and I would just be arrested as the murderer. That's why on the day of the crime... You came to see me at Harry's house, right? Asking me if I was Lee Soo Yeon... Asking me to say your name... Were you trying to see if I did it? So that you can arrest me if I ended up being Lee Soo Yeon? How you kept coming around me after that... was it all because of that? A murderer's daughter... A girl who's been raped... If I was Lee Soo Yeon... I guess you wouldn't even need to look for any other evidence. Right? Detective Han? Why are you so crooked? Why have you become so twisted like this? Just because someone is the daughter of a murderer... do you think they all kill people? Just because someone's been raped... they don't all kill people. Soo Yeon? Soo Yeon... wouldn't... kill anyone. I... wouldn't... kill anyone. If I... had been Lee Soo Yeon... I would've killed you first. Even if you kill me... I still wish... that you were Lee Soo Yeon. Please finish writing your statement. There's no need for you to drag this out any longer. Let her go. Harry Borrison submitted a request for her to be released to the prosecutor. The French Embassy has guarantee that she won't try to flee. We've got the newspaper for reference... and she wrote down a statement. As for the rest... please take care of it yourself, Team Leader. Thanks for all your hard work. Harry... Let's go home. Okay. Let's go home. Let's go home. Let's go home. Harry! I'm so sorry. I took too long, didn't I? Zoey... Are you okay? Craig... we're going to get going. When you're finished here, come back to my house. Okay. Zoey... don't worry about a thing. Soo Yeon... like the scar on top of your foot... it hurts you whenever you see me, right? I'm sorry. I'll wait for you. It's all been erased now. All your bad memories. Don't be surprised. The police called me to say that they were going to search the place. They were trying to find your cellphone. What do I do? What is there that you need to do? This is all my fault. Causing the car accident was my mistake. No... I should've put you back on the first plane back to France when you came to Seoul. Then... you never would've had to go through this. Hearing you say that... I feel even more sorry. I guess you'll leave now even if I were to try to hang onto you. I don't think Seoul suits you. You're leaving... with nothing but bad memories. You must be tired. Let's clean up tomorrow. I'm going to bed. Soo Yeon... Good night, Zoey. You, too. If I... had been Lee Soo Yeon... I would've killed you first. Even if you were to kill me... I still wish... that you were Lee Soo Yeon. Jung Woo... Girlfriend! How did you know to come? I really missing you today. Have some dinner. My girlfriend... What did you do today? What got into you? I'm cold. Why is it so cold out? Oh yeah? You're just using that as an excuse to hold onto me longer. You're so obvious. You crazy scoundrel. Side dish. It's mine. It's evidence. Huh? If Soo Yeon pretends not to know me when I find her... 'Hey... you're going to pretend you don't know me after all this? ' That's what I'm going to say to her. Go just on and eat your dinner. I guess... There's no way she'd pretend not to know me. You don't know, right? Soo Yeon... always walked backwards. So that she can look at my handsome face. You saw it too the first time I came over to eat at your house, right? How she always stared at me. So... just hold onto your worries. Soo Yeon... is coming to come back even if it's just for me. Because she misses me. So... I'm going to wait. This is delicious. She's stronger than she looks, so don't worry. After a bit of crying, she'll be fine. Yeah, I need to. Because I'm slowly starting to get angry. Anyways... I think we need to hurry things along. I was thinking of starving Han Tae Joon to death... but instead of that... I'm going to let him scarf down whatever he sees and die from overeating like a pig. He's not someone who'd just stand still after... seeing Zoey getting arrested at the party. The money... give it to him. Let's make him lose his sight over money and end this quickly. [I understand] It's not upstairs. - Hurry up and find it. - Yes. Lets turn this place upside down. - Search that room very carefully. - Yes. It's so cold! It's getting so cold. Mother! Mother! I'm here! Take him home and eat it. Wow... a woman who makes such great kimchi. Who's also pretty, intelligent, and affectionate... with a great personality and a great figure... Actually with a better figure than her personality... that's the kind of a woman that I'm going to marry. I heard that you caught the culprit who killed Kang Sang Deung? Who told you that? Who just got cussed out for wasting our efforts on the wrong person. Radish, the radish. I guess... why would a woman like that feel the need to do such a thing? A woman like that? Did you see her? I had gone to take Jung Woo some dinner. Goodness... she looked really rich. Where do people like that live? Their house is not a house. I went there... and they have a swimming pool and even an elevator in their house. Don't lie. A house like that doesn't exist! I'm being serious! Everyone knows the house if you mention it... it's the largest house at the edge of Gangnam. Their front gates are... - From the front gates to the house... - Take it with you and go. Mother, where's the lid? Mother, I need a lid for this. The culprit wire transferred the money to the seller for the dry ice, right? Have you put in a request at the bank for us to take a look through the camera footage? Yes, I just need to go and check it. I already checked it. The video captured the culprit sending the money... but they were so bundled up that we couldn't get the culprit's face. I was thinking that maybe traffic CCTV's would've caught the culprit on the move... but I didn't really get anything. Did you stay up all night again? I'm going to get some sleep now. The IP address that they used to order the ice off the internet? I've submitted a request for a warrant for that. - I'll start the search as soon as we get it. - Are you just going to work until you die? You go get some sleep, and you... you take Zoey Lou. Go check again with possible eye witnesses from the crime site. And since she's still a suspect until we catch the culprit... Should I stick close to her? You stay out of this. Take off your badge. Stay out of this. Get out of here. It's like a combo set now. So sick of hearing it. I'm sick of it, too! They said she's not Soo Yeon. Give it a rest now. What to do? I've totally fallen for that woman. What? She's pretty. Are you okay? About what? I eat here and sleep here... so it feels like my own room. But most people feel nervous in here. I've always wanted to come see it once. Yesterday... Zoey was in this room, right? Yes. Is Zoey... okay? I don't know if it was from the shock, but she started crying when she got home. She normally doesn't cry very easily. Why do I feel guilty about that? Because I told you that so you can feel guilty. But even still... I don't dislike you. I've thought of a way... for all three of us to get along. Let's be friends. All three of us. Friends... I think that's going to be difficult. Because I've fallen head over heels for Zoey. That's not good. Don't worry, since Zoey doesn't even like me. But a one sided love affair... is allowed, right? Is this a declaration of war? When I get angry... I can get a little scary. But you can't... still think that Zoey is Lee Soo Yeon that you're searching for, can you? Besides her face being wrong, just tell me one reason why... she can't bee Soo Yeon. If you ever think of one, tell me what it is. We can talk again then. I think this is the place... But where is the house? Where is the house? No, I'll come there. I want to get some fresh air... and go get something to eat. My car keys... I'll be right there. You... Soo Yeon... Subtitles by DramaFever [Next Episode Preview] Mom... I can't... My daughter Soo Yeon is dead. Soo Yeon... what do I do... We've caught Kang Sang Deung's killer. I... like Lee Soo Yeon the best. Mom... Soo Yeon... Can't you stay? Mom? Be quiet! Someone's out there. If you lie to me, you're dead. Where is your mom? Where is she? I was wrong. I see that you still need a beating before you tell me. Where is she? Mom... I don't know where she is. It hurts, it hurts! It hurts? Were you happy I was gone? Your mom, where is she? Lee Tae Su. Lee Tae Su, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder. No. No. I didn't kill him. I didn't kill him! H-Hey, wake up. Hey. I was wrong... I was wrong. Didn't I ask you to take him away quietly? How do you expect me to live here now? This child has been injured. That much won't kill her. Ajumeoni! (ajumeoni - older lady, aunt) If you're so worried, then you raise her. -=Summer 1997=- Hut, set, hut! -=United States, Autumn 1998=- Are you okay? Let's get some help. Oh my god. What's up, man? Are you all right? Jeong Wu! Jeong Wu! Your dad's here! Father? Hey, how was the game? - It was perfect. - Good. You've really gotten big. Almost like a man now. Where's my father? He couldn't come because of business. Here, the Ivy League Campus Tour. Go take a look at the campuses and decide which one you'd like to attend. I'm not a genius, I won't get into college yet at only 15. Your stepmother requested the applications from Seoul, so I'm sure a lot of Korean kids will also be touring. Take this opportunity to make some new friends. My father is still alive, right? Jeong Wu. Please tell Madam for me that I will enjoy the tour. Reporters will be there. Why don't you wait at home? That person hasn't seen his family in 6 months. Why don't we get going before it gets too late? Which car should I ride in? Jeong Wu! What are you doing here? Have you been well? Let's go before we're too late. There are some things parents don't want their kids to know about. Since I never called you, you should have known there was a reason. You're pretty smart, so why didn't you notice that? If you think you'll feel uncomfortable, why don't you stay in the car? Have I done something wrong? Get out, I'm sure your father will be very happy. Jeong Wu, just stay here. Madam, this way please. Madam, did this incident really happen? - For what reason did you come here? - Please say a few words on this issue. Where are you going? Please make a statement. What is his condition now? Please say a few words. Would you say this is all true? They're coming out! President, we heard you were released for health reasons. How are you now? We heard you went to jail rather than disclose your personal property, is that true? This was a deliberate action, right? Father. Father! You need to answer us! President! Say something! President! It's over. Let's go. Jeong Wu, why are you here? What about school? It's because I haven't heard from you for so long. I'm sorry. No, it's mom who was wrong. Don't scold him. I was afraid he would worry. It's my fault for trying to hide it from him. A child would be worried about that. Don't treat him like a child. He's 15 years old and nearly grown up. That's what I mean. He's old enough now to know what goes on in the family. He's our only son. Take him and go home. Director Nam, stop the car. Where do you have to go? No, no! No, no! - What are you doing? - No! No, no! If you take him away, he will probably die! Chairman! No, Chairman! - Calm down, Madam. - Chairman! Nurse Jeong, you have worked hard lately. You should take some time off. I'm going to call the police. Because if something happens to the Chairman, you're a murderer. This time you want to put me away for murder? What do you mean by that? Do you know how I feel right now? Like I just got bitten by my supposedly tame dog. It should be happy just eating what it is given. How dare it try to bite its owner? Where did you hide the money you stole from me? If you want to talk about money, ask the Chairman. Stop treating me like a dog! I... gave birth to your father's son! So, for the sake of your child, you shouldn't be provoking me. You... Why don't you go and see? He's probably not dead yet. Jun, Jun! Jun! Jun, Jun! Jun! Who do you think will be next? Where is my money? What have you done with my Jun? Han Tae Jun, Han Tae Jun! President. Find him immediately! Mom. Mom. He'll come. He won't. He'll come. He won't. You've also suffered a lot, go get some rest. You should also say a few words. You need to send him on his final journey properly, so he won't do evil things. Just hurry and say something so we can send him off. Dad's not coming back anymore, is he? What? It really is... over, right? Here, you can see that and still don't know? You must've been really great! See how horrible you were, for your own child to say something like that? Even I am too afraid to sleep because you might come in my dreams! I'm afraid I will see you again after I die! So I'm going to live here forever, at least a thousand years! From now on, today is your birthday and my birthday. Now that your terrible father is gone, we can start a new life. Lift your glass. Come on! I heard Lee Tae Su was executed yesterday. It's good that he's dead. That's his daughter, right? How could someone with a child bring himself to kill someone else's child? He must not be afraid of retribution. That's good. Eat, eat this. Eat this so you can grow up quickly and go earn us some money. Now you won't have to keep changing schools to hide from your father. So settle down and study hard. Say something! Don't just keep mumbling at me. I could have stump of the tree! Good! Why don't you just have your meetings... You know what? Maybe I need a break. Aah, it! It's TBD! - Shh. - What? You're gonna wake up Ozzie. This just gets weirder and weirder. - Empathize... - With this. Oh! Everybody I never wanted to see again, all in one room. So, tell me why we're here again? Um... Uh... Right. 'Cause the dream never dies. Well, uh... uh, nerds are supposed to be cool now, right? Yeah. Yeah, maybe, you know. Let's see if we're grandfathered in. Yeah. Oops. Sorry. Come on, man, aren't we a little too old for that now? Too old for what... exactly? Um... too old to fall back on an outdated social hierarchy that penalizes achievement and rewards mediocrity. Oh. That sounded like an insult. I think. Um... Whoa, it's... No, don't. Don't. ...my life coach, so... Okay. Ooh. Come on. Wow. Looks like it's just me and you. * It's the same as the emotion... * Yeah, you know. That and your teensy, weensy, little... * Give me your heart, make it real or else... * Hey, so what'd you end up doing after high school? I joined Special Forces. Got my CPA degree off the GI Bill. You should check it out. I'm gonna kick your ass. Yeah, good luck with that. Um... you meant today, right? Whoa. No. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. Oh. Somebody call 911! Call 911! Oh. What's Torres doing here? I don't know. He and Quinn don't officially start till Monday. Hey, Torres. Hey, what's up? Hey, you know, uh... you know it's Friday night, right? - Yeah, I know. Just not really sure how this whole desk thing works, so, uh... figured I'd drop off a few things early. Starting with a picture of yourself. Yeah. It's a reminder. Of...? Something I like to be reminded of. Hmm. Okay, we got to go. Talk to you Monday. Oh, you guys are... late to spinning class or something? Uh, no, Gibbs is famous for coming in just before the weekend starts and saying... Grab your gear. That a well-timed illustration, boss? Got a death at Quantico. Okay. - Are you coming? I'm not much of a varsity letters guy. - James Bruno. Graduated Puller High 15 years ago. Barely, from what I hear. His father was stationed at the motor pool on base. - So, what do you think? Involuntary manslaughter? Yeah. Maybe. Jethro Gibbs doesn't like to commit. That's why it's the perfect job for him. Thanks for calling me. I'm ready to get started. Get started. Okay. All right, what did I miss? Your jacket. Okay. Oh, I don't know, he looks fine. Just fine. Who is he? Oh, that's Agent Torres. Oh, that's great. Who are you? A-Agent Quinn. I swear, I barely touched him. I mean, I just did a controlled throw so that he would think twice about touching me. So, what started the fight? Nothing. He's just that kind of guy. He's just always starting something. When was the last time you saw him? Uh, I haven't seen him since high school. 15 years. Looks like nothing's changed. The teenage years are fraught with peril. The frontal cortex is responsible for self-regulation. It develops gradually over adolescence. Unfortunately, in some adults, well, it never occurs. You aren't talking about anyone in particular, are you, Doctor? 'Cause I was only popping that bubble wrap to see if it was still... The victim, Mr. Palmer. I was referring to the victim. - What about him? Well, I don't see anything obvious, but this hypersalivation suggests there's some sort of poison at work. Boss, we got a problem. What do you got, McGee? Talked to one of the eyewitnesses. They saw Bruno arrive early, put something in one of these lockers and it wasn't a math book. Stand clear. - Yeah. I think this guy had issues. So, this button moves forward; this one moves backwards, and this is the "Oops, How Did That Get There?" button. The what? We push it when Gibbs asks for the impossible to distract him. I-It's preloaded with pictures of his ex-wives or Jimmy Palmer making turducken, stuff like that. And you think he doesn't know what you're doing? He's good. He's not that good. All right, Jim Bruno. Let's go. - Jim Bruno, born James. Left home after high school, never came back. Yeah, he got a job teaching shop at a community college. Ended after a burglary conviction. Wrong button. Oops. - Bruno's never paid taxes, never voted, and has no recent home address we can find. Yeah, your doc confirms that he was poisoned to death. Are we sure the explosive was his? We are now. A base surveillance camera shows him assembling a bomb in his car. Bomb squad's sending it to Abby. Said there's enough explosives in there to level the gym. Bruno would've ended up killing his entire high school graduating class. McGee and Quinn. High school records. On it. Bishop and Torres, go talk to his teachers. See who remembers him. Uh... Yeah? What desk should I be at? - Right here. My old desk. Putting baby in the corner? That's where you sat when you were a probie. Since when do you sit down? Oh. Uh... There's five of us here now. Gonna have to... rearrange some stuff. You try to do what you can for these kids, be sensitive to their needs but some of them are just, well, beyond reach, you know? Hey! Hey! Don't just pull the poster down! Take the tape off the wall! Idiots. Sorry, where were we? You were just telling us how sensitive you can be. Hey, I did what I could for that kid. His senior year, I spent eight weekends in a row in Saturday detention with him, trying to whip him into shape. Nothing took. Always causing a ruckus. Recent contact? No... but it's a tight community. I heard a rumor he was renting a room from an old substitute teacher. Do you think he was targeting anyone in particular? Take your pick. That punk had problems with everyone in the school. How many had problems with him? What, you're looking for a list or something? His death wasn't accidental. He was poisoned. Well, then you got your work cut out for you. Everyone had problems with that kid. Abbs, McGee said you had something for me. Yup. Yup, I do. Yeah. Behind your back. No... no, this is some... it's nothing. It's just... Well, it's my... it's my high school yearbook. I thought I would, you know, get in the mood for the case. It's a very bad move. I don't want to talk about it. Works for me. It's just that... high school, you know? It's where I found my... I don't know, style? And realized my obsession with blood-spatter patterns. Speaking of which... It just wasn't a great combo for making friends and influencing people. I had a lot of, um, alone time in high school, but... let's just leave it at that 'cause I said I didn't want to talk about it, remember? Yes. Okay. Good. On to happier subjects. This is the explosive device that Bruno was going to use to commit mass murder. It has a wireless receiver and it was built from a toy remote-control car kit. Can you trace it? Hopefully or eventually. Don't be so impatient. How close did Bruno need to get to trigger the explosive? Well, it's a long-range transmitter, so he wasn't, like, suicidal, if that's what you're thinking. As a matter of fact, he was trying to quit smoking and that is what actually killed him. The killer spiked his nicotine patch with a cyanide analogue about 20 minutes before he put it on, according to the adhesive oxidation. That rules out everyone at the reunion. I know. Ducky said that Bruno was already wearing the patch when he got there. That's good news. 'Cause it narrows down our suspect list. Yeah. To zero. If I never see a retired substitute teacher again, it'll be too soon. How many are left? Well, five down, six to go. Quinn's got another five. Ma'am, hello. NCIS. I'm, uh, Special Agent Timothy McGee and this is Special Agent Bishop here. Hi, there. Uh, are you currently renting a room to this man? Aren't you two cute. I'll take two boxes of Skinny Mints and two boxes of Peanut Butteries. - My apologies. I don't see so well these days. I could've sworn you said you were selling cookies. Wishful thinking, I guess. I do love Skinny Mints. Mmm, I do, too. So how long has Bruno been living here? Several years now, poor thing. Would you like some coffee? Uh, no, thanks, I'm okay, ma'am. Heard on the radio what happened. Don't buy a word of it. - Really? Why not? James Bruno was such a nice boy. Always paid his rent on time. Wouldn't hurt a fly. Cream? Uh, no, ma'am, I actually said I didn't want coffee. Cream it is. - Uh... did you know that he had a criminal record? I'm blind, honey, not an idiot. I did my background check before I rented the room. Which is back this way, if you want to see it. I didn't learn anything I didn't know already, though. I remember that boy from high school. We heard he was trouble back then. Oh, he was. Everyone hated him. But then he changed senior year. Out of the blue, he started dating one of the most popular girls in class. It was the darndest thing. She turned that boy's whole life around. And his attitude. He ended up being quite well-liked. Here you go. You got a key? No. I don't go in there. He likes his privacy. Boys and their boy antics. What a tragic ending. But I don't believe for a second he's capable of murder. I can't imagine why anyone he went to school with would want to kill him. Or why anyone would at all, for that matter. Know what I mean? All right. He was a good kid. - Not that good. - Look at this, iPads, jewelry, paintings. - Oh, where he get all that stuff? - Good question. Okay, people, we have fine art on table A. Electronics on table B. Jewelry and household goods, tables C... There's a lot of stuff here, how much do you think this is all worth? All these wonderful prizes are worth tens of thousands of dollars and they can all be yours, Timothy McGee, if you can answer the NCIS bonus question. Where'd it come from? Actually, boss, I can answer that. Burglaries. All over the city. Torres dug up this report. Metro PD's been tracking a citywide theft ring for over half a decade. - This is all they got? Yup. Clearly Bruno didn't do all this himself, but Metro never generated a single lead on whoever was involved. - Well, I have one. Not to brag. All the fingerprints that I found in the room belonged to Bruno. But I also found this, which did not, according to Ducky. Bruno had a visitor with a really bad case of pityriasis capitis. AKA dandruff. Left flakes everywhere. Like snow. That teacher see anyone? I don't think she's seen anyone since the '90s, boss. She did say Bruno would have an occasional visitor. Said it was, "A man or maybe a woman, I think." Whoever they are, I'll bet you dollars to donuts that they are gonna be coming back for this stuff. Take Quinn, McGee, eyes on that house 24/7. Abbs? Don't even think about it. - So how long has it been since you've been on stakeout? - It's been a while. But I-I'm good to go. I taught yearly seminars on it. Oh, I... I remember. Oh, that's right. I did forgot one crucial element. What's that? Hydration is your enemy. Ah, yeah. Well... Men's room. Ladies' room. No. I am not at DEFCON 1 yet. But you will be the first to know. You will be the one with the bag on your head. - What is she doing? We told her to stay in the house. Well, we told her to do what she normally does, so... Does she normally water the bird feeder? - Aw, be nice. She's a lonely old lady. Which reminds me, Bishop told me you're going to propose to your girlfriend. Congrats. Thanks. Tho... uh, those two things reminded you of each other? Oh. When are you gonna pop the question? When it's time. And when is that time? I don't know. I'm not exactly sure yet. I know I'm just gonna feel it out and... you know, I... I think... I'll just know, you know? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Right. No. I'll know that it's time when it's time. When might that be? I... Ooh, I see something. Yeah, it was really good chatting. Oh, yeah. Ooh, I got to go. - She won't tell us who she is. - Yeah, still no hits on her prints. Abby confirmed that it's her dandruff in our dead guy's room. Any I.D.? Only thing she had on her was her purse. - Yeah, and I have been to drug-lord torture rooms less scary. Me? Oh. Yup. What's your name? Okay. Where do you live? Okay. What were you doing in Jimmy Bruno's house? All right, we can sit here all day doing this... Hey. Are you hungry? Yeah? Here you go. Hey. How's the interrogation going? Well, just as you thought. Gibbs is slow walking it. Seeing if Torres will pick up the pace. Hmm, how's he doing? Well, he interrupted Gibbs. Took me four years before I got up the nerve to do that. Thank you. But he's got her talking. - Don't thank me too fast. We're about to charge you with murder. Bruno was my friend, I would never hurt him. Okay, well, then help us find out who did. I don't know anything. Did you know your friend tried to murder 50 people? - And maybe you were planning it with him. No! Hey! - Then why were you running? I wasn't. Really? Sardines, underwear? Looks like you were planning a trip somewhere. Or, you know what? I don't even want to imagine what else. Let's just go with running. You're wrong. That bomb couldn't have been Bruno's. He wouldn't do something like that. His fingerprints were all over it. Then you made a mistake! He's a thief, but not a killer. So you do know something. You're a thief, too, huh? Well, somebody's going down for Bruno's murder and guess who the Wheel of Misfortune just stopped on? I helped Bruno sell some stuff, that's all. It's none of my business where he got it. How long you been fencing for him? We have video of your friend building that bomb. He's not who you think he is. No, he's not who you think he is. You... you see him as you want to see him. He's got a lot of bark, yeah, but no bite. If he really did plant that bomb, then someone made him do it. He was tricked or something. And while you're wasting time in here with me, whoever manipulated him could be out there trying again. Did you ever think about that? - In some ways, Bruno, I envy you. When I was a child, I often fancied living the life of a daring cat burglar. Fortunately for me, yeah, at age of nine, on my maiden voyage, I fell off our neighbor's roof, yeah. Landed on my coccyx. And that was the end of that. You're lucky it ended so quickly. One time when I was in high school, I spent a night in jail for... Uh, for... Never mind. For what exactly, Mr. Palmer? Just-- it's funny, I-I said the word "jail." I meant to say, um... Vail. Yeah, I was-I was a big skier in high school. Were you now? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I loved the-I loved the, uh, snow. I loved-I loved, uh, skiing and-and... What I'd do is I'd- - Vail! You look like a man on a mission. Got an alibi for the murder. She was nowhere near Bruno when he was poisoned. Oh, and so it goes. Got us to thinking, maybe there's a second bomber. We could use a lead. Well, let's see what we can come up with. This man has told me quite a bit about himself. Starting with these burns. They're quite old, probably inflicted when he was a teenager. Military records indicate that his father died of lung cancer, excessive cigar smoking. Yeah, so we can put two and two together. He had a rough childhood. And also a rough week. Well, yeah. He's dead. Yes, but days before that, he was in a fight where he suffered severe body blows. If you look carefully, you can make out the imprint of a fist. Well, his knuckles don't look too bad. Yes, well, oddly enough, he didn't seem to fight back. Even more odd was the fact that we removed a diamond earring from this lobe. Well, men are piercing their ears now, Duck. Yes, but I'm referring to the fact that the hole was closed up from disuse. Yet he forced the earring in anyway. Ugh... That must've hurt like a mother. I'm sure it has some... psychological significance, but I'm not sure what. However, Abby came up with a second set of DNA on the earring. So, I imagine you'll find out soon enough. Well, is that a good enough lead for you? Hey, so, you're the world-famous Abby Sciuto I keep hearing so much about. Oh, well, guess we can skip the "I thought you'd be taller" part. I'm Agent Quinn. For what's it worth, I thought you would be exactly five feet, six inches. I made a 3D avatar of you, using NCIS security camera footage. And the hairs slowly went up on Agent Quinn's neck. Oh, no, no! I just... I needed to know your sizes, because... I'm knitting you a "Welcome to NCIS" sweater. Oh! But until it's done, welcome... to NCIS. Well, thank you very much. Do you want a tour? I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to... He wants to find out where the earring came from. Of course he does. Well, right now, all I can tell you is that the prior owner was a female. Okay, so do you know how long Bruno had it in his ear? I have been waiting for someone to ask me that. The impurities in the gold caused our victim's skin oil to oxidize. And by measuring that amount, I could determine that he forced the stud through his ear, like, right before he went into the reunion. To kill 50 people. Then was poisoned to death. Okay, so whoever owns the stud, maybe she knows something. Well, I'm running the DNA through CODIS right now. But I've also been looking at this, trying to find pictures of women. I found this in a trench coat in Bruno's closet. Unfortunately... no women yet. Huh. Are these the homes that he robbed? Yeah. Looks like he was casing them for a few days. There's also a few pictures of his feet... and some pictures of some other people that I haven't identified yet. Ho-Hold up. Go back one. That's Neal Sherwood. You know him? Well, he was at the reunion, and he had a fight with the victim right before he died. Well, that's important. Uh, yeah, because Neal said they hadn't seen each other in 15 years. Oh. Where is he? - With his suitcase, wherever that is. Neighbors said he split right after the reunion. - Left in a hurry. He's running. Quinn, BOLO. McGee, freeway cams and credit cards. Find him. - We found something. Abby got a hit on the DNA from the earring Bruno was wearing. - Katrina Cooper. A high school classmate of Bruno's. Former prom queen, married the school jock, active social life. How did Bruno get her earring? Could've stolen it, but if he did, she never reported it. They have any recent contact? No. No calls, no texts, no Snapchat doggie faces. The only connection we could find was from high school. They had a Saturday detention together, once. 15 years ago? Thin, I know. Talk to her. Find out why her DNA was in our dead guy's ear. Round two, everybody! We got soccer meatballs, lacrosse stick hot dogs... and pigskin pizza pockets. Who's hungry? - Mmm. I am. Hi. You must be here for Katrina. Why would you say that? That's what happens when you marry the most popular girl in town. Everybody's here for Katrina. Hmm. She's over there, in the huddle. They're like... little footballs. - And I told the guy, "Give me Louis Vuitton, or give me death." I got this. Okay. Um, Katrina Cooper? How you guys doing? You guys have fun? NCIS Special Agent Torres, Bishop. Hi. Can we have a word with you? Of course. Let's not disturb the party, shall we? Excuse me. Let's not do that. They're little footballs. They're good. - And how can I help you? Do you know this guy? Mm, no. Am I supposed to? Well, you guys went to high school together. Oh, in fact, he actually died in front of you. At your high school reunion, two days ago? Interestingly enough, wearing one of your earrings. It was stolen. Oh. You didn't report it stolen. I am now. You know, I bet you and me had something in common in high school. I don't think so. We both liked bad boys. The badder the better, except, I grew out of it. I don't think you did. Your husband know that you and Bruno have been sleeping together? Excuse me? What I'm wondering... is if you knew how bad Bruno really was. - You know, if he told you about, for the last several years, he's been robbing people in the city. Yeah, I think it's time for you to go. Cheers. Have one more question... No. No, no, no more questions. I don't know anything about any robberies, I'm not cheating on my husband and I have no idea where Neal Sherwood is. Okay? Well, that was actually my next question, which... I haven't asked yet. Oh, right. Hmm. Where is he? Get down! Found him. The cops are outside right now. It's over. To be honest, it's kind of a relief. I am willing to set the record straight, but I cannot go to prison. I just can't. I can't have it, my family... can't have it. So... I'm sorry. Shot himself with a flare gun. That's a new one. Did I miss the part where he set the record straight? Maybe it's on the laptop? Go-Go Abby fingers. Hey, so, um... You, um... liked bad boys in school, huh? I'm sorry, I just... I just painted for you for more of a goody two-shoes, uh, prom queen type. Actually, I... was the prom queen. Wow. So you played us both. Nice. Except, I was voted in as a joke. Kind of like Carrie, but... without the blood. Bishop, that's like... the worst thing I've ever heard. Yeah, I didn't have any friends in high school, I was too... me, I guess. I got something. Okay, it's a text document. Neal made it right before he shot himself. Looks like some kind of confession. It's even double-spaced and everything. - What exactly is he confessing to? - According to Neal, he and his high school friends are the ones behind Metro's theft ring. With each friend playing a very specific role. Adam Cooper, former jock, ended up running a sports betting company. That's where he would identify the wealthy marks. - Katrina Cooper, his prom queen wife, would flirt her way into the homes to get info on their security systems. Bad boy would do the actual robberies, and this woman, who we've now identified as former classmate, Angela Russell, would fence the stolen goods on the street where she lived. Finally, there's Neal Sherwood, the accountant. And he laundered the money. Yep. According to Neal, they came up with the idea to start a robbery gang back in school, after they met at a Saturday detention. - He said they talked about it as a joke at first, as a way to "get back" at their parents. Eventually they realized, if they pooled their talents, they could make some real money. - All of this seems very familiar. - Yeah... Yeah, I'm v-very interested in this case, here. We got five different high school kids from varied social backgrounds all coming together on their Saturdays, for detention. You know, it kind of reminds me of, uh... You've... You don't... Not important. Sorry. Anyway, the different social groups was part of the reason Metro was never able to crack the burglary ring. They were never able to find a connection between the players. Congratulations, we just solved Metro's case. What about our own? We have no clue who killed our victim! Actually, not true. The prom queen ain't talking, but the fence is. She thinks she knows who killed Bruno. Two days ago, your wife gave Bruno that earring. I don't believe you. Welcome to the club. You were the only one not at the reunion. You were the only one that had the opportunity to poison Bruno. Prosecutor's gonna file charges today, unless you have something to tell us. This isn't where I imagined I'd be after high school. Ah. Welcome to the club. I wanted to be a pro football player. You? Painter. Really. Really? Yeah. Really. Painter. Loved to paint. Watercolors, mostly. I took every art class that school had. Water colors? It's hard to imagine a grown man... So what happened? Life. Life. I paint with wood. It's close enough. Not for me. I suspected Katrina and Bruno had started up again, but I didn't want to believe it. But if she really gave him her earring it's game over for us. It's worse than that. I think that witch tried to kill me. The last house we knocked over, Bruno snagged a painting worth over a million bucks. My wife kept joking we should take out our partners, keep the money for ourselves. Said we should bomb the reunion, and make it look like a terrorist attack. I honestly thought she was joking. She must've talked Bruno into it. He was always a sucker for her. No way he would come up with something like that on his own. Hell, he was even gonna pretend to let Neal kick the crap out of him at the reunion as a goof, to impress some girls. Bruno was bad on the outside, but good on the inside. My wife? The opposite. What about you? All I can say is I'm not a murderer. I didn't kill Bruno, and I wasn't anywhere near him when he was poisoned. Hypothetically speaking, how would you feel about a betting pool on whether his alibi checks out? Hypothetically? How'd Ducky bet? Guilty. How'd you bet? I'm not a gambling man. And I have no idea. - I mean, who are these people? Living double lives like this? I mean, yeah, I mean, I... I lived as someone else, for the most of the last decade, but... I had an excuse, I was, uh... I was undercover. Which version is the real them? Which version is the real you? You're looking at it. Am I? You created all those covers. It wasn't random. Wait, you're saying that a part of me wanted to be a, uh, mafia-tied, vegan juice-bar owner? Eh... You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? You tried to kill us all! Oh, could everyone just please stop fighting? Shove a Pixy Stix up your nose! - McGee is taking them to Metro not a moment too soon. And Miss Congeniality denied having anything to do with the bomb attempt, even though we found the detonator in her car. Unfortunately, her husband's alibi came through. Like he said, he was nowhere near Bruno when he was poisoned. The fight with Neal was staged. - If none of them killed Bruno, then who the hell did? All right, let's go back to what we do know. He's dead. I feel pretty confident about that. What else do we know? We know who didn't kill him. And a million-dollar painting is missing. We find the painting, we find the killer. Checked everybody's houses. Nobody has it. Everyone insists Bruno has it. He didn't. He could've hid it. Maybe in a storage unit in the area. Yeah, safe-deposit box. Start looking. - All that work and we're back to square one. Tell me about it. What about the fight Ducky said he was in? Maybe he came back to finish the job. Our only witness is dead. Okay, what would I tell my students in my GPS forensics class? I would have them go back and reconstruct a timeline of Bruno's movements. Maybe we can find another witness. Do it. There goes my evening plans. Were they exciting plans? Uh, cooking class? Oh, well, don't cancel that just yet. You. I have goodies, come on. You know... Even though you just met her, you already kind of wish she was your sister? Well, I was just going to say I like her boots, but hey, I'll take another sister. I was finally able to trace the remote detonator that Bruno used in his explosive. It took me a long time because there are parts missing. Someone tampered with it? Yeah. And according to touch DNA, Bruno did. It's like he built this bomb, and then he disabled it. His girlfriend's remote detonator wouldn't have even worked. Bad on the outside, good on the inside. Maybe he got cold feet and decided he didn't want to be a depraved mass murderer after all. See, this is why I'm a people person. 'Cause the good on the inside, it always-- Abbs. Quinn... cooking class? Right. Sorry. Okay, so the receiver was made from a rare Lazarus 1941 hobby car. It's available in only two stores in the area, one of which happens to be across the street from a bank with a brand-new, hi-def security system. Voila, Bruno. His entrance isn't very exciting, but he made quite an exit. Personally, if I was looking for Bruno's murderer, I would start with that guy. Can you enhance it? Yeah. Who can't these days? - You found out Bruno was robbing people, you tracked him down, you asked to be cut in. When he refused, you went to his house the next day, and you poisoned him. Oh, yeah? Is that what I did? Yeah, that's what you did. What it's gonna look like to a jury. We have a witness that places you in his front yard. Where's the painting, Vic? The what? Wait, wait, wait. Slow down here. This is just a total misunderstanding, okay? I was at the hobby shop because I made a promise to James Bruno 15 years ago. To what, poison him to death? No, to kick his ass! I devoted my life to those kids. Bruno in particular. I spent eight weekends in a row in Saturday detention with that smug, arrogant little-- Actually the records say seven. Eight! It was eight! And all that kid did was blame other people for his problems, whining about his mom and his dad. Making my life miserable. So I promised him I would find him one day and pay him back. And that's what I did. I'm glad you're a man of your word. Judge all you want. I've been in combat. High school is worse, mister. Wait, no, wait, wait, wait! I did not go to Bruno's house to poison him, okay? I went to apologize. When I confronted Bruno, he didn't fight back. He seemed, like, resigned. Almost like he wanted me to hit him, like he deserved it. And that's not what I wanted. So I went to his house to say I was sorry. Anyone see you talk to him? Bruno wasn't there. Just that nasty old witch, Frimkes. She saw the bruise on my knuckles, figured I was the guy that beat up Bruno, and threatened to call the police. So I got the hell out of there. She saw that? Yeah. She did. Come on now, baby. Come on. I got my first pair of reading glasses when I was 45. But your medical records show that you have perfect eyesight, and hearing. Agent McGee, it's good to see you again. I-I was just, um-- Walking without a cane? No. Skipping town with a million-dollar painting? No! Going to jail. Dang! - So in addition to being a chemistry teacher who knew 50 different ways to poison somebody, she kept a pretty active retirement life. She totally Keyser Soze'd us. She what? Keyser Soze'd. Uh, Usual Suspects, the movie? Oh, I'm not much of a movie guy. You know, she told us on the drive back that she knew Bruno was a thief, but she didn't want to go to the police because he was trying to get clean. She claims she found the painting and was going to bring it back to the police. - Yeah, killed Bruno and kept the painting for herself. Whoa, whoa, what? Better. Better! Who... who... Who do you think? I kind of like it. I don't. Wait a sec, wha... what's the point of moving desks if were were just gonna move desks? Seriously, I mean to do something like this without consulting anyone? I am the senior field agent. You realize that... Boss, what was that for? It comes with the territory, Senior Field Agent. Did he just physically assault you? - Hey, Gibbs, I feel like you'll want to see this. We found a laptop in Bruno's car. He was writing an e-mail to the police. He was going to come clean, turn everyone in. Guess he figured which version was the real him. The good guy. I'm just not that into movies. So what do you do for fun, besides disrupting people's workplaces? Broadway musicals. Okay, if you start singing show tunes, I am going to shoot you, and then probably shoot myself. Oh, okay, well, what do you like to listen to? I thought you'd never ask. Ah. Go! Hey! - Hey, hey, hey! Hey. Boss. - Hey! Oh. Hey. Ha! Hey. He's gonna learn to love it. Shh. So many years, I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again. And then, I did. In a photo, in a briefing room. And I was being sent to meet him with a gun. This programme contains scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. When this is all done, Steve, I'll suffer for my actions. I'm under no illusions of a happy ending. Shot fired! What's he saying? He whispered something to you. What did he say? I'm not sure what he meant. My job is to find any and all evidence. And what was found in the case? A large number of banknotes. How did Detective Sergeant Arnott react? He didn't bat an eye. I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background. I'd like to keep digging. There's evidence of prolonged torture. Cause of death isn't clear. Cutting his head off can't have helped. This photograph shows Danny Waldron as a teenager. This man's a young Ronan Murphy, the suspect shot by Danny Waldron during Operation Damson. What? They knew each other? And this person bears a strong semblance to Linus Murphy's severed head. Danny knew him too. No prior information of the operation to move Tommy Hunter. I had no prior... knowledge. No prior knowledge, at all. Kate knows about me and Jackie and Danny. I've got to come clean to AC-12. The longer I leave it, the worse it looks. It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy. Rod's body was found hanged at an industrial unit. We need to talk. You are now declaring that PC Rod Kennedy killed Sergeant Daniel Waldron? Yes, sir. Rod killed Danny. Look, I'm sorry about this. It's just that I've got no-one else to talk to right now. It's fine. Look, mate, I don't think I can keep going into the station. All the stuff that's going on behind our backs. All the stuff that's going on to our faces. Yeah, well, Rod was a good bloke, weren't he? You know, people can't get their heads round it. Yeah. I can see why. Look, Jackie, don't do this to yourself. My hands were on that gun and I felt Rod force the trigger. He killed Danny. You know, we was right to stick together, you know, when he was here, but now he's gone. We've got to move on. Ah, come here. Superintendent Hastings. "Hi, sorry to bother you, sir." I just followed Jackie Brickford to a meeting with Hari Bains. "He seems pretty bloody shifty to me." Dot. Just so you know, I've authorised Kate to adopt direct surveillance on Hari Bains. Nice one, Gaffer. Yes, and I want Steve in on it too. Absolutely. Steve, get yourself get yourself over to South Ferry when Hari Bains comes on shift. Be visible. Sir. Come in. Inspector McAndrew, DS Arnott, AC-12. What do you want? In an interview gave at AC-12 you informed us that Hari Bains had a good working relationship with Danny Waldron. Yeah, so? Hari never made any complaints about Danny? If anything, the opposite. How so, Ma'am? I was due to rotate Hari from Danny's squad, but Hari said that he respected Danny's professionalism and wanted to ride on more jobs with him. Really? When did he say this? Couple of days before the Abbots Lane op. You mean a couple of days before the op that got Danny killed? I was all set to disband Danny's team after the shooting of Ronan Murphy and there is no way you're going to pin some blame on me just because you're struggling to find a scapegoat. Thank you, Ma'am. You've been very helpful. 'AC-12.' DC Fleming. Put me through to telecommunications, please. 'Telecoms.' DC Fleming. I need an identification on the last number dialled from a payphone on the corner of Calman Road and Turner Road. 'Stand by.' 'The number you have called is not recognised. Please check the number.' 'The number you have called is...' Kate reports Bains attempted to make a call to this number. It relates to an unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile. Now, the call couldn't be connected because either the phone or the SIM Card was out of service. I've got Maneet liaising with the mobile network provider to see what information we can get about the number. Great. Tell Kate I want her on Hari Bains round the clock. Yeah, will do, Gaffer. 'What the bloody hell are you playing at? 'Making a call from a public box? 'That's why we sent you the unregistered mobiles.' The text came through to my own phone, so I thought... 'Yeah, well, we had to get a message to you urgently 'and you weren't answering. You're being watched by AC-12.' I didn't see anyone. 'What did the text say? ' "Sit tight. Act normal." So how's this acting normal? Dickhead. All right? All right? Look, for my two penn'orth, I think we're flogging a dead horse with Bains and Brickford. Rod Kennedy killed Danny Waldron, couldn't handle the guilt, he topped himself. Maybe it wasn't suicide. We ought to request a second postmortem on Rod Kennedy's body. The first one was only looking for cause of death. We should get a Home Office pathologist looking for evidence of crime. Sure. Leave that with me. Cheers. Do you like chilli? The food. Not the country. I've got a pot... on the simmer. You've probably eaten. No, I haven't, actually. Well? Yeah. Not too fiery? I'll cope. If you go to the trouble of making a pot, you might as well make it last a few days, you know? One night, you can have it with rice. One night, baked potato... It's rock and roll, me. Well, I'm not complaining. By the time I knock off, the only thing that's open is a dodgy kebab. That's undercover, isn't it? Stupid hours. Well, Mark works in IT. He did a lot from home, which was great for childcare. Just not so great for us. You still see the kid, though? Yeah. Sorry, I shouldn't poke my nose in. No, it's fine. It was the right decision. You know, give him security and stability. Just not such a great decision for me, to be honest. See, me and my missus, we never got around to having kids. Was she a copper too? Forensics. I don't see much of her now. No? No, I was on the piss most nights. Couldn't pass a bookie's. Final straw was - we'd put down half on a fortnight in Majorca. Oh, don't tell me. Yeah, five-to-one. Dead cert. I couldn't go home to face the music, so... I took out a loan, put a grand down on the last race of the day, try and win it all back... Barrel of laughs, me, yeah. Can I have your bowl? Cheers. Hey, there's seconds here if you fancy? Any more and I won't get off this sofa. Yeah? I've got something for you, Sarge. "On that photo found at Danny's." Yeah, sure. It's from a boys' home called Sands View. Danny Waldron's mum died when he was 11, and he moved up north to live with his dad and stepmum, but that didn't work out and he got taken into care. Danny was a resident at Sands View from the age of 13 until he was 17. I keep going through the file. There's no link between Danny Waldron and Ronan Murphy while Danny was a police officer. The only link must be this boys' home. Unfortunately, I can't get hold of any records for that period. One council department told me they were lost in a fire, another told me they went missing during an office move. You think they've been lost on purpose? Who knows? The lads were chucked out at 17 and pretty much left to fend for themselves, with no follow-up. However, I've crosschecked with individuals known to the criminal justice system and I've got a name for you. Same age as Danny, so chances are they were there at the same time. Good work. Hey, Joe. Joe! Joseph Nash? Yeah? Can I talk to you somewhere quieter, please? Yeah. I'd like to show you a photograph, if that's all right. It's a photocopy of an original image believed to be approximately 15 to 20 years old. Do you recognise the image? Yeah. Do you recall the name of this location? Yes. Mr Nash, you're not in any trouble. How did you find out my name? I'm not going to lie. You committed a number of minor offences. Look, I was just a kid, back then. I've put my life back together now. The convictions are spent. It was only that your record crosschecked with an enquiry I'm involved with. An enquiry into Sands View? Connected to Sands View. Do you recognise this individual? Yes, Danny. Danny Waldron. Yeah. Do you recognise this individual? Yes. What do you remember about that person? He took us for football on a Tuesday afternoon. He was one of the staff? No, he just took us for footie. What else do you recall about him? You're being a big help, Joe. Is it OK if I ask you about one more person? This man, here. Him. Who is he? Mr Murphy. He was the caretaker. The other man. The football coach. Was his name Murphy too? Might have been. They was a pair. A pair? The older one, the caretaker, he had the keys. For the dormitories. Changing rooms, the basement. But him, the younger one he was in on it too. With the others. What others? Just... Not in the photo. Visitors. We got told they were very important people and we had to do exactly... what they said. Did you ever get the names of any of these people? No. No-one ever got any names. And even if we did, it was just... Mr Smith. What happened with these visitors? Well, sometimes they'd they'd come to the home and we'd be told it was like a private interview. "Mr Smith can be a big help to you when you move on," sort of thing. You know? And then you go to a room with Mr Smith. Or a few of you would. With a few of them. The abuse always took place within Sands View? No, not always. There was, erm... sometimes there'd be a car or a minibus and they'd take us to a hotel, or a guesthouse, or some big some big private home. You know? But the parties... The parties, they were the worst. Parties? There'd be a few of them, these, these VIPs... And we'd be farmed out. Do you recall any details in terms of names, addresses, or the people who drove you to and from these parties? This was a long time ago, all right, mate? And I wish I could remember that information and forget about the rest, but it's the opposite. I know this is hard, Joe. Is there anything you can tell me about these individuals that might help identify them? Yeah, there's one of them... stands out. He's a... He's a big... big fat whale of a fella. He always wore a suit. And when he took the suit jacket off, he always had these, these, these sweat patches and... he stank of it. And when I got told he'd asked for me again, I'd... I'd throw up, you know? I'd be sick. Is Danny the one? The one? Yeah. He's got people listening to us, at last. Yeah. Yeah, he is. Arnott. Any report yet on the second PM? What second PM? Dot said he was organising a second postmortem on Rod Kennedy. First I've heard of it. Leave it with me. OK, I'll head back to South Ferry. Right, I'll tell her. Francis, that was your rep. AC-12 want you in for interview straight away. She doesn't know anything. She never believed us, not for a minute. Jackie, she weren't in the room when Danny was shot. But he whispered something to her as he was dying. Yeah. And if he managed to tell her the truth, do you think she would've kept quiet this whole time? No. Trust me, she don't know anything. Yeah? All right, mate. I've continued to search records relating to Sands View. Our witness, Joseph Nash, claims a number of his abusers were VIPs, all of whom used the same alias, Mr Smith. Hence Nash wasn't able to give us any names. But he did claim one of these abusers was extremely obese. Sports day at Sands View. Who is he? Dale Roach. He was leader of the city council during the period Danny Waldron and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View. Is this the man, Joe? Yeah, that's him. Thank you. Now, it would help if you would come to my department and look through some images of other individuals... Joe, I came from a loving family. Had a nice childhood and I can't begin to imagine what yours must have been like. 20 years it's took you to come here. I want to help. 20 years... I've had that monster in my head. The sounds he made, the smell of him. And the things that he did to us at Sands View... No copper ever gave a toss. Are you saying offences committed at Sands View were reported to police and no action was taken? We told teachers, we told social workers, and yeah we told coppers. And then, we learned not to. Danny Waldron's dead, Joe. He was killed because he was going after the people who did this to you. Danny's mission is now my mission. And I promise you, I will get these bastards. Daddy! Daddy! Hey! Hello, you! Is that for me? Mm-hm. Well, thank you very much. And I will always, always love you, OK? Mm-hm. Come here. How long has he been here? I'd have to check. Two or three years at least. Any family? No family, no visitors. Mr Roach. Mr Roach? ! Can he hear me? He doesn't understand much. He can't talk. What's wrong with him? Massive stroke. Sorry, do you need me to stay? No. Thank you. Call if you need me. Mr Roach, do you recognise the name "Sands View Boys' Home"? Mr Roach? I'm Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott. I'm investigating claims relating to Sands View. Do you understand me? ! Danny Waldron recognised Ronan Murphy as an occasional sports volunteer at Sands View Boys' Home. Somehow, from Ronan, he was able to track down Linus Murphy. Linus was the caretaker at Sands View and used his position to include Ronan, his nephew, in his activities. Now, a witness has given us another name - Dale Roach. Councillor Dale Roach. Unfortunately, Roach isn't fit to stand trial. I think Danny Waldron purposefully created a trail of evidence that led us to connect him to Linus Murphy's murder. And now, we're on the trail of the other abusers. There is only one thing we are interested in here, son, and one thing only. And that's bent coppers. The boys made complaints. Some allegedly to police officers. Thank you, Steve. Sir. Hi. Kate? Come in. Something wrong? You didn't come back to the station. By the time I'd finished with AC-12, my shift was over. So, what's going on? They just wanted to go over the details of the day Danny was killed, times, places. You know what they're like, fishing for inconsistencies. Anything they can pounce on. And did they? Did they what? Pounce. We shouldn't talk about this. What did you tell them, Kate? We can't have this conversation. You should leave. I need to know! You keep asking me to leave you alone. Congratulations, you're on your own. What do they know, Kate? You should go. What do they know? They're onto the pair of you. What about us? They know Hari stopped McAndrew from disbanding Danny's squad. What? ! I never knew anything about that! And they know about the phone calls. What phone calls? Yeah, right "What phone calls?" Bye, Jackie. What phone calls, Kate? ! They've got Hari making calls from a phone box to an unregistered pay-as-you-go number. They know it must be a phone you're using covertly. You two are in collusion, and developing your strategy using untraceable telephone calls. It's not me he's been calling. Stay here, I'll get it. So, what's up, then? Who've you been calling? What? AC-12 know you've been making dodgy calls. They think I'm in on it! All this time, we trusted you. It was just the three of us. Now, Rod's dead and that still isn't the end of it! Jackie, what are you...? Who have you been making those calls to? What aren't you telling me? ! I haven't been making any calls, all right? It's just me and you, and as long as we stick together, then... Jackie, I've been telling you the truth. Yeah, I'm sorry, I know it's late. I need to go in and see AC-12 and I'm going to need your solicitor. Stand away from the door. Ms Denton, you remain under oath. Thank you, milady. Ms Denton... In your examination-in-chief, by your own counsel, you made a number of references to an undercover operation conducted by a Detective Sergeant Arnott of Anti-Corruption Unit 12. Yes, I did. Did any of these operations involve Detective Sergeant Arnott being present at your home? Some did. You were alone with Detective Sergeant Arnott? Sometimes. And on all these occasions, there were no other police officers in the vicinity? There was a constable stationed outside the house. Where outside? On the doorstep. And where did sexual relations take place? In the bedroom. And how was the bedroom accessed? Via the stairs. And how far do the stairs lie from the front door? I don't know, three or four metres from the front door. From the plans of your home obtained by the prosecution, the distance is... 2.7 metres. If you say so. I don't "say so", it's a fact. And if I'm inaccurate, I'll be corrected. There are written statements by all the officers stationed outside the door in early October, and not one recalls hearing you and Detective Sergeant Arnott go upstairs together. Well, that doesn't surprise me. It doesn't surprise you that trained police officers on guard duty, in a high state of vigilance, don't hear the two of you go upstairs for sex when he or she is less than three metres away? We were discreet. Hmm. You've told the jury that this intimacy with Detective Sergeant Arnott won your trust and, therefore, you permitted him unsupervised access to your home. There were times when I was napping or in the bath or the shower and he was free to roam the premises. I trusted him completely. And you've alleged that on one of these occasions, Detective Sergeant Arnott planted a sum of money in your late mother's overnight case. Did you witness Detective Sergeant Arnott bringing the £50,000 into your home? No. Did you ever witness Detective Sergeant Arnott having access to tens of thousands of pounds in cash? He'd hardly do it openly. Corrupt officers have access to criminal contacts. Please answer the question you've been asked. Did you ever witness Detective Sergeant Arnott with such an enormous sum... of cash? I don't know how Steve Arnott got hold of the money and then got it into my house. Ms Denton, you've answered. And I'm still answering. If I'm in accurate, I'll be corrected. Steve Arnott had my complete trust and the trust of the officers on guard duty. He could easily have picked his moment to plant the money and I firmly believe that that is the best explanation for how it came to be there. Because I had never seen that money before. Were you aware that you were under investigation by Anti-Corruption Unit 12? Yes, I was. And were you cooperating with that investigation? Yes, I was. You were being completely honest, to the best of your knowledge, in assisting them with their enquiries? Yes, I was. And had you always been completely honest with Anti-Corruption Unit 12? Please answer, Ms Denton. It was a complex case and there were many details that were elusive and, at times, required further thought and examination before I could give a definitive answer. Did you lie in relation to matters surrounding the conspiracy to murder Tommy Hunter? Ms Denton. As I said, it was a complex case, and many details were difficult to define or recollect. Did you lie about having prior knowledge of Hunter? No. You lied about having prior knowledge of Hunter, didn't you? No. You told the investigators lie after lie to confound them, and to pervert the course of justice, didn't you? It wasn't like that. It was like that. You wove a web of deceit to confound the investigators and to protect yourself, and you have the effrontery to attempt to deceive this jury. No! Did you fabricate the improper relations between you and Detective Sergeant Arnott? No. Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you? No. Lindsay Denton, aren't you an artful, devious person, who has betrayed the trust placed in her as a police officer... No. ...and haven't you repeatedly and shamelessly connived to obstruct those who would bring you to justice? NO, I HAVEN'T! Watching that circus really turned my stomach. Listen, I owe you an apology for the other night. Your... dinner invitation. You're a married man. This is it. But here we are, two colleagues having a drink, and the sky hasn't fallen in yet. Yeah. This is a voluntary interview by authorised firearms officer Victor Charlie 53 in the presence of her Police Federation representative and solicitor, by Superintendent Hastings and DS Arnott. I want to cooperate. I want to go on record that I have never, at any time, engaged with any other officer in covert telecommunications to knowingly mislead lawful enquiries. Glad to hear it. I also want to clarify some details... of previous statements made regarding the death of Sergeant Daniel Waldron. Very good. Carry on. I never saw the exact moment the struggle started. The struggle for the gun that killed Daniel Waldron. Neither did Rod. We had to rely on what Hari... On what 54 told us. He said that Danny had entered the room with his firearm drawn and that he'd turned the gun on 54. So, you're saying Danny tried to kill 54? I'm saying that's only what 54 told us. He said that Danny turned the gun on him. 54 made a grab for the firearm to stop Danny from shooting him. There was a struggle for the gun, Rod and I joined in that struggle. The gun went off and killed Danny. Hold on a second, Constable, this is going way beyond clarifying a statement. I mean, you are changing your story all over again, here. This is the truth, sir. Well, you need to take a deep breath and we need to caution you. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be used in evidence. Do you understand? I understand. So, now you're saying that Danny wasn't trying to kill himself. He was trying to kill VC 54, or so 54 claims? Yes, sir. That seemed plausible. Why? Danny was bullying us into covering for him after he shot a suspect. He moved the suspect's firearm, and then, he discharged the weapon narrowly missing 54. What, you conspired with Daniel Waldron to provide false statements regarding the shooting? Yes, sir. We were all really scared of Danny. There was a part of him that was capable of doing anything. So, you killed him? No! It seemed like an accident. 54 convinced me and Rod that if we said that we'd killed Danny in self-defence, that the least we'd be looking at would be manslaughter. He told us to claim that we were trying to save Danny and that way, nobody could blame us for his death. Yes, but instead of telling the truth, the three of you went off and concocted a whole new version of events. And then, you decided to blame Rod Kennedy for Danny's death. I knew Rod was jealous of Danny. It seemed plausible that he could have been the one. You don't believe that any more? No, sir. 54 initiated the struggle with that gun. And it's only his word for it that it was self-defence. I just don't believe him any more. I can't the service entrance instead of going through the reception desk! - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - We're from television. We want to shoot 3 scenes for a co-production film. He's clean. We need to settle the conditions. Speak to our marketing manager. Maybe we'll come for a game some day too. It was a pleasure, gentlemen! What a show-down! The shame of it! You were no help at all. I'm sorry. I'll get you the money. Good afternoon. - Let me help you with that. - I can manage. - It would be my pleasure. - All right then. Thank you, it's kind of you. - Been traveling again? - I've been to Ostrava with my husband. They played against Banik. So your husband is a soccer player? Yes, for the Sparta club. And you go with him? I have to. He's terribly jealous. That's understandable. - I'll take them up for you. - That'd be nice of you. It's the fifth floor, the door on the left. - How about coming along? - No. Thank you. - Thank you very much, Mr... - Hana. I can't use you like this, Mr. Hana. You may. Anything. Madame. Thank you, I'll be seeing you. - Is that her? - Yeah. Will she lend us some money? Buy a big bouquet to set the mood. Then leave it to me. Good morning. - Hello, uncle Ed! - I've brought a customer. He needs a special bunch of flowers. For you, Uncle, they'll be very special. Hello. What kind? What sort of price? Up to about 1000 crowns. For what occasion? Who are they for? For the French ambassador's wife. In that case lilies would be splendid. - How's Venda doing? - As usual. Her husband is an alcoholic. Or orchids? Or roses? I've got lots. I'll leave it up to you, Marcela. How long is it since your Mom... Just yesterday I wanted to buy flowers for her grave. That's nice of you. And someone stole my wallet! With my month's pension in it! I went all hot and cold. - I burst into tears. - Tell her why! Why? All my money for the month... Tell her, don't be shy. Yes... all of it... He'll lose the chance for a wonderful role. What role? He's been chosen for a film about a concentration camp. To play an old mime who saves 80 Jewish children. Seriously? If he learns tap-dancing within two months. That's easy. You'll be in a movie, uncle Ed? - Wonderful! - But he wants to refuse since the American dance teacher wants 50 dollars a lesson. Fifty dollars? That much? And how many lessons. .... Ten. That's 20 000 Czech crowns, but he gets 10 000 dollars for the part! Ten thousand? That's nearly half a million! Half a million? I'm sorry, uncle Ed. I can't lend you the money. Venda's drinking, the tax man, school fees. 950 crowns! - Pay up! - You have the money. Here you go. - Keep the change. - Bye, and thank you! What do I do with the flowers? Put them on your sister's grave. I heard that Mary Grulich had her 855th birthday. - How about... - So let's catch a taxi! - 'Bye for now, and take care. - Good morning. I just brought Mary her shopping. She's in a bad way, her legs, poor thing, that tiny pension and she forgets everything. She owes me 2000 but I'm not saying anything. She'll be pleased to see you, gentlemen. - No way! - Oh yes! We come with our congratulations on behalf of the theatre. They all send their regards. They remembered! You were the pride of the theatre for 40 years! The oldest chorus-girl in history. And a soloist, boys, but you wouldn't remember. In '41 I sang Helena in Polish Blood as stand-in. The lead tenor gave me these flowers afterwards and this bottle of old Spanish wine. How we loved Polish Blood! We all wanted to sing Count Baransky. I know since you're a cavalier... I am not right for you, dear... I'm just a maid, after all... It's over and done with now. You've made me so happy, boys. I slept right through my horrible birthday. But now we'll celebrate! I saved it for 60 years for the right occasion. Open it! Vintage 1930! - Here's a cork-screw. - What an honor for us. You were always the princess of our dreams. This wine's so good it doesn't want to come out! How much is there left? The flowers, taxi... 6000 of your money. I left 2000 under Mary's vase. You are so kind, Fanda. Good deeds pave the way to heaven. But is there an afterlife? Who knows. Just in case... so be good. Give that boy a hundred. - A whole hundred bill? - For both of us. - Isn't that too much? - You don't want to get to heaven? - Here you go. - Right on. Thank you very much. Stop! Stop thief! - I feel like crying, Fanda. - That won't help. - Good, he didn't take my ID card. - What will you do? I'll have to tap into the funeral savings. How about selling something? The anatomists buy skeletons. But they don't take baldies. Seriously, what will you do? We're down to our last thousand. So let's let off some steam. Come on, do something! Can't you see that I can't see? Bring me the funeral savings book. I'm going to the bank. - Where is it? - In the big dish. It's not in the dish. But I put it there. Here it is. My, you scared me. I think you'd better... not open it. - Fanda! - I took out thirty thousand. Thirty thousand? ! D'you want to borrow my glasses? I'm not going to scream. I'm going to kill you. Well, I understand how you feel... - So you understand? - Absolutely. So why did you take the only money we have? I've been betting on your birth date in the lottery for 30 years. I expect to hit the jackpot now. What have you done with the money? I was sorry that you'd only ever been to Hungary. I wanted to buy you a holiday in Hurghada. - Where? - The Red Sea, Luxor, Karnak, Queen Hatshepsovet's Temple. I'm not going to any Hukarda! You won't, because a bogus blind man stole the money. The Red Sea. A bogus blind man! D'you expect me to believe you? - No. - So why make up these lies? - Why deceive me? - You're shouting. Yes, let everyone hear that my husband's a liar and thief who ruins my health and shortens my life. I can't even die decently because of him! But I've had enough of your silly pranks. Kill it! The moth! - Put that paper back. - I will, after I've read it. He complained someone's stealing his paper! How does he know? It's in place when he comes home. Yes, with the crossword puzzle done. He can't do it himself anyway. Don't smoke. You'll cough. I cough better when I smoke. By the way, I want that 30 000 back. And tie your shoelace. I'll think it over. Till then you'll give me all of your pension. That might make you take life seriously at last. - What did you say? - It's going to be a lovely day! When we've done the shopping we're going to Jara's to look after the children. - Josef! What a coincidence! - Josef who? A scene-shifter from the theater... See you at the yogurt counter. It was parked here! My new car! I saved up for it for five years. I didn't notice it. What color was it? Yellow. Stolen with Agapornis fisheri - What am I going to do? - You must report it. Come, I'll take you to the police station. Those jerks are supposed to watch this parking lot. Let's go! Two luxury villas. And a magnificent mansion for 60 million. - But that's 200 miles away. - It looks splendid. But 155 rooms, that's not really enough. There are servants' quarters with 10 rooms. It would make an exclusive bed and breakfast place! Good idea. Antique furniture, oriental rugs, old paintings and the prettiest waitresses in period costumes. - Or without... - Hey, control yourself. Beauty queens, anyway. 36,24, Make the arrangements so they take us there. I'm due for a medical check-up. If the worst comes to the worst would you look after my dog. He's an old softie. He's bitten me twice! That's a token of love, he bites me too when I go out. He stands on a chair by the window and I wave to him so he knows I'll be back. Old age is sad. One should die young. We missed our chance. We gotta stick it out now. Easy for you to say. I cry when I hear an oompah band. I see those sad, abandoned doggie eyes. I'd shoot myself if it wasn't for you. In that case aim for the heart to be sure. A tip from the court pathologist. It's a trophy from the theatre. What's the problem, anyway? Kidneys, high blood pressure, cataracts. You are lucky! I've got arrhythmia, gall-bladder, prostate - but it's all better than having AIDS. You're such a lucky fellow, Fanda. - Help me, please! - Come on. - No! Don't be scared, it's safe! - Oh God. Do something, sing! - Don't be frightened. Oho, cried Robin Hood... I'll give you Robin Hood! Stop! We'll ride up and down until he cools off. Sing! Stop! Calm down. It's perfectly safe. - What's all this? - Hello Dad. Well you see Kveta... I mean Erna... You see if we do move to that home. Jara has to furnish this room for Kveta. I've been there. It's a very nice place. You could move in within two months. I am not moving out of here. - We have to help them, Fanda. - No, we don't. like my meal now. - Sorry. Enjoy. We just need to make About what? I'm staying here, in my apartment. Jara bought us this place. And he brought me the 30 thousand you were robbed of. Good, because if you hound me out of here, you'll be needing that money, dear. What... Who's driving you out? Where are you going? - I don't feel well. - What's wrong? How could you sell me like this? Mrs. Hanova... Fanda is dead. He's dead. He came here awfully upset, sat down and suddenly collapsed. He didn't regain consciousness. I don't believe it. Why didn't the doctor save him? Why didn't he help him, Mr. Stara? She's arrived by taxi carrying a black suit. By taxi. Now we're screwed. Look, a funeral van. Go on ahead, Mom. Watch your step. I'm sorry. He fainted. He went dead white and stopped breathing. Don't cry, everything will be all right! You said the doctor couldn't help him. I thought I called the ambulance... So was the doctor here or wasn't he? No. Ed wanted to help me. So that you'd realize what you'd lose in him. And he sort of overdid it a bit. The taxi cost 500, the coffin 3000! The fright nearly cost me my life! You put him up to it! You criminal! You liar! You heartless brute! This way... I can't go on. I refuse to live with him. - So what's with the coffin? - Take it away. - That'll cost you. - We'll settle it right now. Hello Dad, hello Ed. Dad! Move in with me, nobody'll bother you and you can do as you like. Emilie Hanova and Frantisek Hana. Applicant, please clarify your petition for a divorce. I made my statement in writing and have nothing to add. How long have you been together? For 44 years. A long time. You went through a lot together. Good things and bad. Is your marriage now so seriously impaired - That it cannot be saved? - Yes. Does the applicant's lawyer have any questions? Did your husband often spend his whole pension without contributing to the household? Do you know what he spent the money on? - Different things. - Give us some examples. I asked him to visit his father's grave and he returned a week later from some spa. He lost his month's pension and 4000 crowns at the Casino. But he didn't go there to gamble, he heard about the sightseeing flights and he always had longed to see the world from a bird's-eye view. But there was fog, he had to wait for good weather and he gambled the money away out of boredom. And he spent your savings in expensive restaurants. He had a poor childhood. During the depression his father split matches in half to save money and as a boy he served beers in a gadren pub. He wanted to see what it's like to be rich. Did you tolerate his behavior? No, but when I was mad he brought me flowers and I always forgave him. - Any more questions? - That will be all. As the respondent, do you have anything to say? It's true, the applicant always forgave me but I didn't appreciate it. You may sit down. For the records... - Well? How's it going? - Badly. Witness Jaroslav Hana. Just as an example. Once mother persuaded him to look after his grandchildren for a while. He took my two little girls to a cafe by taxi. To a smoky cafe... He ordered champagne, they all got tipsy and he forgot them on the subway. But Dad's a very kind man. He's fun and he's generous, but... Incompetent. Being so irresponsible, he's just not fit for marriage. Life with him really is sheer martyrdom. It's very hard for me to have to say this. Mother thought he'd grow wise with age but this last thing was a very cruel trick and mother realized she couldn't stand more. Can you describe this cruel trick? He put his friend up to it... Ed... Mr. Stara told mother that Dad had died at his place. - Do you wish to speak? - Yes. Out with it, Mom. It was a terrible thing to do, devastating. Although I admit I went against him when our son wanted our flat for his ex-wife and kids. and arranged to move us to an old folks' home. He refused, and for my effort to help our son he punished me so cruelly. Me, who always forgave him for all his crazy ideas. Because I admired him for being so different. I'm a stick-in-the-mud sort of person, studying maps. He means to fly round the world in a balloon, and he refuses to admit that our paths don't really lead anywhere anymore. It's intolerable. The older he gets, the crazier he is. He doesn't go to funerals, he makes fun of death, he makes paper darts out of death announcements. I don't know if he wants to be buried or cremated! He doesn't know the price of bread, but follows the dollar exchange rate. When the dollar dropped he bought me 8000 crowns worth for Xmas. He throws money around and saves money - by stealing our neighbor's newspaper. He always returns it in time but I'm on tenterhooks he'll be caught at it. When we took the train to his dad's grave he didn't buy any tickets. The inspector caught us but Fanda proudly paid the fine and left him a tip! The inspector burst into tears. And when I scold him he says I'm right and just goes on doing it. I've been listening carefully. I feel that in your own way you still love your husband despite his shortcomings. Let me ask you again. Are you fully convinced of your incompatibility? Please tell me, with your whole heart and conscience. Do you insist on a divorce? No. Even though I know I'm going to regret it. You heard the applicant's decision. Do you wish to say anything? I want to state that I love my wife and that I'll mend my ways. Thank you. - Nice, isn't it? - Yes. Nice. Jara'll hew off THE VANOUS FAMILY and put up THE HANA FAMILY in gold We'll have our photos taken. I want them on the gravestone. - Isn't it beautiful? - It's very nice here. Don't smoke here, Fanda. It's not fitting... I don't want to harp at you, but... No, that's all right. Done. No, I'd be so glad if you stopped smoking. All right. If you mind that much. It's not because of me. Smoking causes cancer. ... say the health warnings. Exactly. Please bring up some water. The tap's back there by the morgue. Right behind you. Here we'll keep what you save by not smoking. Have you finished all the crosswords again? The storekeeper said they're difficult. Some are, some aren't. Mr. Stara, please leave Fanda alone. No. He does not want to talk to you. Why? What a question! He was nearly divorced because of you! You're going to the hospital? Yes. I'll tell him. Goodbye. That was Ed. He says he's going to the hospital. Which one? He didn't say. Who knows if it's true. He has high blood pressure and his kidney's failing. You should try for a crossword puzzle prize. The storekeeper won a book and 1500 crowns once. - Shall I wash the dishes? - After dinner. Now grind the poppy seeds and take your vitamins. Isn't it wonderful being together like this, - With you helping me. - Yes. Wonderful. Marie from Brod has died! Which Marie? My dad's step-brother's son's wife. I didn't know her. Look how cheap-Iooking the announcement is. - I don't care. - About anything, I know. Luckily it won't be up to you. Here's everything ready for when I die. My death announcement, the undertaker's phone number, my coffin clothes, the addresses where to send the announcements. The funeral music, flowers, even your announcement. So check it to see if you like it. Hello, I'm Mr. Stara's neighbor. - Yes? - Can I speak to Mr. Hana? - Come in. - Thanks. Come on, Bobby! I couldn't find you, pal. Sure... - Got a cigarette? - Don't play the fool. I thought you were paralyzed. Only my right arm and right leg. Not bad here, is it? Fine. That one kicked it. That one's been moved to a loony-bin. He kept walking naked into the nurses' room demanding erotic massages. So how are you doing? I'm training for the wheelchair races. But the damn thing keeps swerving to the left. You'll have to go see the mansion on your own. No, I'll wait for you. Such a beautiful mansion, a really nice place to live. So let's buy it. They might give us a discount. My savings book is in that drawer. Take it. Good idea, we'll borrow the rest. I hope it's enough for my funeral. To hell with that. I'm giving up, Fanda. Should we never meet again, it's been wonderful, it's been just enough. Stop it, stupid. Listen to this, there's a young nurse here who... but you must light up for this story. I don't smoke any more. It's gone too fast. I meant to visit Dad's birthplace. - I'll take you there. - Take me back to bed. Life isn't worth a light and it won't get better. You mustn't give up. Your dog's waiting. God! I can't even take a piss on my own! Hello, Mr. Hana. Will you wait outside for me, Dad? I wanted to say goodbye but you were out. I'm moving to my mother's in Kolin. Cologne? Not that far. Thanks for everything. It's pure hell at home. I don't sleep at all. Don't mention it today. - Hello Dad. - Grandpa! We've got visitors! Which one are you? Karolina? - No, Marketa! - We're going to move here. Be quiet, girls! Sorry, Dad. The two women keep gassing about it in front of them. I'm not angry. I'll have to check out the home for senior citizens. - You don't want to go, do you? - Yes I do. You look like you're going to your execution. the train's here. Listen, I don't want you forced into this. I'd like to see it. If we're moving there. You said you would never move. The situation was different then. Come, let's go home. We missed the train anyway. I've lost a shoe! Here... hold me up... Your coffee. Thanks. You fell asleep again. - No. - Yes! It's getting worse! You snore away all day or sit hunched up by the window like that poor man downstairs. You don't talk, don't smoke, don't drink, don't sing, don't quarrel. I can't stand it any more! - I wanted to please you. - Please me? What happened to you? I married a cheerful man with crazy ideas, with whom I laughed and argued all day and nowadays you sit here like a living corpse, like some dope who doesn't care that I'm unhappy. That I can't live like this! And I won't! Mr. Stara... Forgive me for bothering you, I need your advice. It's about Fanda. He's unhappy. He's terribly unhappy, and I don't know what to do. - Where are you going? - We're are going on a trip. - Where to? - To buy a mansion. Go and get ready. Wait. It's not that simple. It's all arranged. Ed gave me instructions. Who did you say you are? The wife of an emeritus member of the New York Met who is returning to his native country. Is the agent going too? The owner's representative will be at the mansion. What did Ed say? How is he? Poor man, he's going into a geriatric unit. I said we'd come and tell him how it went. I'll get it. I understand. How can you say I'm not supportive? But the situation has changed. You have everything, Jara. Money, a job, your youth - and you have time. We don't have any time. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. No, it's you who complicated things, dear. You shouldn't have gone after all those women. That's all. 'Bye. Hurry up! He's not there! He sat there dead for Come on, then. Look, the trees are blooming! I feel good. Aren't you well? I'm scared to death. Don't worry, you only feel that way the first time. Let's hope I make it through this. - Turn around and drive back. - Yes, sir. Very shabby. I'm not taking it. What? What's happening? Nothing. The place is too small and neglected. I don't think you'd like it here. -So how you been doing, man? -You know, for the most part, I'm fine. " For the most part." Which I'm gonna interpret as meaning though you're not down now, you have something on your mind. So why don't you just tell me what's on your mind? Nothing, really. Which, to tell you the truth, is kind of the problem. I can't figure out what the hell to do with myself. -You're not going back to USC, huh? -No. And that I know is the right decision. But, unfortunately, that's about all I know. Come on. You've gotta cut yourself a little break here. Life did just throw you one hell of a curve ball. All you really need is time. Before you know it, you'll be full of confidence, up to your old tricks. -And you have come to the right place. -Oh, yeah? Yeah. You're talking to the king of directionless. That's what I was doing with those years of high school folly. I was perfecting the life without purpose. Last year you could've gotten away with that burst of self-deprecation... -...but this year, you seem fairly driven. -Yeah, I know. lt's terrible, isn't it? But what can I say? I love the kitchen life. I even love the crass kitchen attitude. -Sandwich? -Sure. But, inevitably along with the crass kitchen attitude comes the grillside drama. Yeah. lt all started with me trying to help this girl out of her very self-destructive relationship. But then you throw in a little dash of my very poorly thought-out attraction to her and her absolute lack of attraction to me and you get where l'm coming from. Oh, that sucks. Wanna talk about it? No. To tell you the truth, it's really not all that interesting. And it's nothing you should be troubling yourself with given everything that's been on your mind lately. Well for what it's worth, the Pacey I know would figure out a way to help the girl, no matter what the drama. is that so? Without a doubt. Okay. Joey, it's time for a study break. I've been nodding off on the same sentence to the point of drool. -lt's just-- lt's not pretty. -Well, you don't have to ask me twice. Sweet. So where's Jack? Deep in the land of Frat. Did he tell you about this Winter Formal thing? Yeah, that actually sounds vaguely familiar to me. But to be quite honest, all the Greek speak sounds like.... Well, Greek to me. I get it. He wouldn't ask you to the caveman hoopla so I get stuck with the surrogate date duties. I feel for you. I do. Watching Jack pretend to be one with the thick-necked brotherhood. Come on. lt can't be that bad. I'm sure Grams has some prescription medication somewhere that would help you a lot through this, Joey. Thanks, but I think I'll manage. Hey, Jen.... Speaking of the men in our lives how's Dawson these days? You're asking me? Well, it's- - You know I haven't seen him for a while, and I know that you two hang out and I guess I just needed to know that he's doing all right. He's better. He.... He's been seeing a shrink, which I think is really good for him, you know? He's gonna be fine. That's exactly what I needed to hear. It's been.... lt's been kind of hard getting used to not being the one to see him through this, you know? And I think I'm finally okay with it which is hard to admit without feeling like a total jerk. Oh, stop it, Joey. You're not a jerk. I've been meaning to tell you that I can't think of a better person to be there for him right now than you. I'm really glad that you're there for him. Thank you. All right, simmer down, ladies. No offence, Jack. We got a lot to do for tonight's formal and little time after this meeting. So let's get to it. A, this is our biggest event before the break. B, it must be perfect. And C everybody must get laid. You should all be hooked up with a date by now. But for those of you chumps without one... -...meet the list. -Yes, the list! In the spirit of house love, I need names, people. Decent-looking honeys... -...ready to put out. -What about Debbie? -What about Suzanne? -Alison! Alison! No, no. What about those fine-ass Worthington chicks? Come on, dog. We know you got some hottie friends. And we know you're not looking to score with them. -Jacky! -Talk! Talk! Come on, please, talk! All right, all right, all right. I may know a girl that meets the specified requirements. Hey, I got dibs on whatever this guy's got, okay? I've seen these quality chicks McPhee hangs with. So our main man Eric's got himself a date. Okay, I am aware how absurd what I'm about to say is gonna sound but I'm also aware of how miserable your love life makes you and I can't sit and watch you hurt especially when I know I can do something. I'm here to ask you out. -l can't go on a date with you, Pacey. -Okay, that's fine. Then you don't have to think of it as a date. Think of it as an opportunity to compare and contrast. A free trial run at a life without heartache. -Pacey, you know I can't. -Actually, I know that you can. You need a break from your relationship. I need a break from your relationship. I'm promising to leave the kinky underwear at home I might even stop by CVS and steal a bottle of cologne. What do you say? Do I have any reason to feel hope? You have my word. I will keep this whole thing completely platonic. Fine. A friendly outing on the town, nothing more. Excellent. You rock. So pick you up around 7? Seven. This is your friend Pacey you're talking about? Yeah, but it's not just him, it's all my friends. lt's like they.... l don't know. lt's been two months and everybody's still.... They're holding things back from me. Like they're trying to protect me. You know, I mean, they look at me like this- - As this fragile, breakable thing instead of just Dawson, the person. And I know they mean well, it's just it makes it virtually impossible to move on. -Have you mentioned this to them? -Yeah. Well-- No, actually. No, I haven't mentioned it to them. What about the film festival you told me about? Isn't that coming up? It's this weekend. Are you going? Hadn't planned on it, no. It might be good to take life on the road for a little while. Help clear your mind. You could even take one of those friends you feel so estranged from. Come on. There must be someone you can take. Well, this little ditty goes out to all you brave souls out there surviving a heartbreak. Trust me, better things will come. -Hello! -Hey! Oh, and don't worry. That sleazebag formerly known as our boyfriend Charlie is not here today. -That's a good thing. -Yeah, that's always a good thing. But you know what? Even if he were here, it wouldn't really matter to me. -Really? -Yep. I think that time has finally done its healing thing. -Hey, what's up? -Nothing. I just wish I had your self-control. I mean, I know I should be puking at the mention of Charlie's name but I find myself daydreaming about him. His latest attempt to woo us back with that whole " l've changed" pitch. Which " l've changed" pitch? All those corny love letters he keeps sending. Doesn't it seem, sometimes, in that moment when you crawl in bed alone like, " Hey, maybe he really did change"? Gosh. I don't know which love letters you mean. -Hasn't he been sending you letters? -No. He's trying to woo you back, huh? That's-- Jen, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? No, no, no! Please don't apologize. I swear, it's fine. I was just saying to you that it doesn't matter to me. I want corny love letters. I just don't understand why he chose her and not me. -ls there something wrong with me? -Jen, there's nothing wrong with you. It's just.... All this time, I thought he was cheating on us on equal ground, you know? But, no, she got to be the girlfriend and I was just the floozy. Floozy? -Yeah? -You said "floozy"? -lt's what I am. I'm a floozy. -Oh, Jen. This is supposed to be the other way around. -l'm supposed to be consoling you. -No, please. It's the least I can do, and believe it or not, it's helping me a lot. I just don't wanna be here. The thought of running into either of them makes me wanna puke. Okay, so let's get out of here, then. This weekend. Well, I'm game. Where do you wanna go? You ever been to Hooksett, New Hampshire? No. Can I tell you something? I am so psyched to be going to this formal. I was so excited when Jack called. Granted, last-minute arrangements can be annoying and blind dates can be as dangerous as gator wrestling- - Joey you're hogging the mirror. -Freak. -Oh, God! Hello, hideous! Do I even like any of my clothes? Audrey, you look great. Besides, I don't know what the big deal is. As much as I wanna give Jack credit I'm sure it's just frat debauchery masquerading as an event. Okay, killjoy. First off, Jack said this Eric guy is hella cute which, right off, sounds interesting to me. And for someone as progressive as you it's amazing how close-minded you are about frats. The words " progressive" and "frat" do not belong in the same sentence. What about this one? Joey, we're going on a double date. -A little cheer, please. -Okay, okay. Well, if nothing else, at least I'll have a good time with Jack, right? Wait, wait, wait! Okay. -Hey. -Hey, handsome! -Wow, Joey, you look beautiful! -Thank you. -Audrey! How you doing? -Hi! I'm great! Good. Good. Eric, this is Joey. -Hey. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -And this is Audrey. -Hi. -Hi. -Jack was right. You're a stone fox. Thank you. You know, I guess you'll have to do. -Well, let's go, shall we? -Yeah. Yeah, let's go. -Can I help you yet? -Yeah, I'm Dawson Leery checking in for the film festival. Oh, my God. You're totally wicked cute. Way cuter than the picture. There's a picture? is this your girlfriend? Oh, cool! Your movie's awesome! Your screening sold out. You beat Oliver, you know. -He's the biggest thing around here. -l'm sorry. Who's Oliver? He's our local celebrity. I don't see what the big deal is, though. -Ask me, he looks kind of retarded. -He's, like, eccentric, Trevor. God! Okay, let me make this clear. It is more than an option... -...to go back home right now. -Oh, I don't think so. Granted, the people of this town are a little off but who can deny that we could both use the love? And what better way to spend an evening than as girlfriend to the biggest celebrity in town? -Gee, honey, you shouldn't have. -Well.... -Wow, you guys really went all out! -Sigma Ep. Expect nothing less. Way to deliver, man! Score, big daddy, score! -What was that? -Nothing. The guys just being idiots. -Take your coats, ladies? -Okay. Jen should be sharing this pain. I should call her. No can do, she's gone for the weekend with Dawson. That was great, thanks. Just the check, please. So? -What? -Oh, come on. Was this good or was this good? Give me a little of credit. -l saw your face when we came in. -l did not have a face! You had a face. But let's get back to giving me credit, shall we? You may also have noticed that I have kept us in crowded places because I wouldn't want you tempted to jump me on our non-date evening. Well, I mean, you are wearing that really sexy outfit. Damn! Who would have thought you cleaned up so good? And you're right. A lesser guy would have not afforded my self-control such a generous security blanket. You saved me from myself. Well, it hasn't been easy, let me tell you. I know you don't like hearing this, Karen but you deserve better than being an illicit affair. A woman who is as giving and as beautiful as yourself deserves someone who's gonna be there loving you back just as hard. -Okay, that was good. -Yeah, that was really good. Which just kind of puts the final nail in the coffin. -What nail? What coffin? -How did I get top prize? Either my dad donated a wing to the Hooksett library or these people have no idea what's good and what's bad. -Okay, you- - This has gotta stop. -What's gotta stop? This. The people of this town are perfectly nice. And you blaming them for bad taste is obviously just a way to undermine your own artistic abilities. You have a tremendous talent so would you please stop putting yourself down? Or I'll have to break up with you. You can't break up with me. You'll never break up with me. The physical attraction is far too strong. You got me there, tiger. -Hey, Leery! -Hey. Your movie better be good. This festival consistently gives first prize to a film with a fresh voice and unique vision. I've won it three years in a row. And I just don't like the idea of being usurped by a Hollywood slickster, you know? It's just not cool. Hi. You're really pretty. Who's gonna argue? -No after-dinner cigarette? -No cigarette. I only smoke when I'm nervous or severely annoyed. So then not nervous or severely annoyed. I guess I should take that as a good sign. In fact, I don't think I saw you yell or complain all night long. It's amazing what being out of Civilization does for a girl. If I didn't know you better, I would say that you positively light up. Now, don't go ruin the moment with unnecessary compliments. And why not? Enough of the cynicism. I say that we ruin this night silly with unnecessary flattery. Karen Torres, you are a beautiful young woman with fantastic taste in clothing. And although your jokes do tend to bomb you make up for it with that sparkling smile of yours. Okay, now it's your turn. I had a great time tonight, Pacey. -Yeah, I'll take that. -Thank you. You know, just seeing you have a good time is thanks enough. Anyway.... Good night, Karen. The first time I saw this film I knew I was in the hands of a talented filmmaker. But I was equally moved by a letter which accompanied the film's submission. It was a letter from the filmmaker's father telling me that I absolutely could not ignore his son's work. Honestly, I was predisposed to hate the film because, well it didn't show up until three days past the deadline. But I'm a father myself and I know a thing or two about parental pride. So I grudgingly put the video in the VCR and after five minutes, I knew Mitch Leery was right. I absolutely could not ignore his son's work. So, ladies and gentlemen I give you the filmmaker behind this year's top prize film: Dawson Leery. I don't know what to say. My dad loved movies. He loved them in the truest sense in that he had no interest in making them, he just.... He loved watching them. He started taking me to movies at a very early age and I loved it. He would take me to movies and then.... And then talk to me about them. I need to know how you learned that I am the one the Lord Chamberlain hired to dispose of the witness. I don't betray friends to murderers like you. That's what I was hoping you would say. STORM: Why do you Starjammers treat me as an enemy? Did we not fight side-by-side against the tyrant D'Ken? True. Though we have maintained communications silence, Corsair's open communicator allowed us to hear everything. Including Cyclops-son betraying Corsair-father to evil Commander! X-Men the ones who act like enemy, not Starjammers! JANDRA: I am glad you are back. But why is the lady tied up? Her friend betrayed our location to the false Shi'ar officer. On the other hand, from the lies Cyclops was told, it is no more than we expected. (BUZZING) (BUZZING STOPS) Is it true you are Corsair's son? Not by choice! Watch and learn. What are you going to see is the ship's log for three days in the future. But that's impossible. 1821 hours. Encountered magnetic storm of force 10 intensity. Life support temporarily failed. Six crew injured. The witness, Jandra, lost. This faked sequence was programed in advance to cover up what was really going to be a murder! Exactly. I went to your father for help, because he was the one man I knew with the guts to rescue Jandra and see that justice was done. Until I ruined it. My mistake could cost all of you your lives. We'll see. For now, just try to have a little faith in your father. - I gave orders that I wasn't to be... - Disturbed? That's the Scott Summers I gave my last parachute to! Took you long enough! Plan the family picnic later. Let's go! Follow me! CH'OD: Corsair, sorry to break communications silence, but I strongly suggest you alter your course 13 degrees to the north. Fools! We have them now. CH'OD: And remember Aldebaran 5. I remember it well. S TORM: Professor Xavier sends his regards. Xavier is half-a-planet away, and Aldebaran is in another galaxy. What are they up to? (CHEERING) I don't know what happened on Aldebaran 5, but it better have been good. It was. (CORSAIR MOANS IN PAIN) Now! Fire! (LAUGHING) You'll have to forgive Ch'od. He gets carried away. That's okay, Dad. I think I understand how he's feeling. Get up here, everyone! We have a trial to get to! And a renegade cop to turn over to Shi'ar justice. CORSAIR: What made you change your mind? Let's just say I like long odds. Seems to run in the family. Our talk got interrupted. There's so much I want to know. We'll get to it. All of it. I've got a question or two myself. - Then stay! - What? I don't mean forever. Just a few hours. You're not telling me your hot spacecraft can't make up a few hours flying across a whole galaxy! Well, I... I guess we could spend a little extra time in hyperdrive. No. Break out the cards! Better save your fuel. Looks like we're going to be here a while. So, you're gonna marry that redhead that beat the pants off of the Imperial Guard. C YCLOPS: She's calmed down a bit since then. - Reminds me a lot of your mother. - C YCLOPS: How? CORSAIR: Maybe I should wait to tell you till after you're married. NARRATOR: Previously on X-Men... SHAW: You X-Men were allowed to enter, so that I could have the pleasure of introducing you to the Inner Circle's newest member. WYNGARDE: To our new queen! - Our new queen! - ALL: Our new queen! Jean! We can't deceive and control the Phoenix forever. Some day she'll discover the truth, and turn against the Inner Circle. PHOENIX: Your pathetic attempt to use me has opened my eyes! No! Please! You had me do evil to gain you power. But through this body, I felt the thrill of that evil. Now I thirst for more! Jean, it's you. Talk to me! Help me! PHOENIX: For this new sensation, the rapture of destruction, for the pleasure of the Phoenix! The unbound joy of evil! The mortal Jean Grey is no more. I am fire made flesh! Power incarnate! I am the Dark Phoenix! - Do not do it. - Oh, dear. (SHRIEKING) You wish me to return to the cold nothingness of space? You wish me to give up the body? Never! There is a power beyond good and evil, the power to create and the power to destroy. Jean, can you hear me? Jean Grey can hear nothing. Speak only to the Phoenix. Jean, fight it! Use the powers of your mind. Remember what we mean to each other. Jean, please, don't leave me. Scott? Scott, help me. Enough! You are of no use to me. (ALL SCREAMING) WOLVERINE: Ducks. I hate ducks. Gambit can't help but notice you save him, chere, and not Wolverine. Must be my way with women. Don't flatter yourself, swamp-boy. (GAMBIT GRUNTS) Little piece of advice, Cajun. Never make that woman mad at you. Speaking of mood swings, what's bugging the Phoenix? She used to be on our side. I fear Xavier's intuition has proved prescient. Through Jean's keen human senses, the Phoenix has experienced exhilarating new sensations and emotions. - I doubt she wants to give them up. - Why not ask her? WOLVERINE: Better ask her real nice. Your destiny is at its end, X-Men. The Dark Phoenix has come to destroy you all! Defend yourselves. But remember, Jean is up there with her. - Be careful. - I call upon the power of the hurricane! (ALL GRUNTING) Hang on, sugar. (PHOENIX LAUGHING) Do you really think your puny powers mean anything to me? Forgive me, Jean. This is too easy. You provide me only annoyance, frustration. The power of lightning! Why does the body excite when I must struggle to get at them? (STORM SCREAMS) Get away from her, you witch! What in the world? Uh-oh! (WOLVERINE GRUNTS) Why does the sensation lessen when the opponent is weak? Cyclops, now! - No! - ROGUE: Beast! Fools! Do you think I need eyes to see, ears to hear? Shouldn't have done that, gal. Let's see how cocky you are once I've drained off some of your power. Stop it! (ROGUE SCREAMS) Is this all you can do against me? This is too easy. Give her back! Why do you care about this body? I love her. Love? I do not understand. Your answer is unacceptable. (GRUNTS) Scott? What have I done? I love you, Scott. No matter what the future holds, I will always love you. Never forget. (ALL GROANING) Jeannie. Life readings, Eluke? As if I didn't already know. Nothing, Captain. The D'Bari star system is as devoid of life as the others. It seems such a waste. An entire universe out there, waiting to be discovered, and we're asked to map dead star systems. Who knows? Maybe one day we shall find something. (SCANNER BEEPING) What is it? What's happening? I don't know. (ALARM BLARING) Eluke! What was that? A comet? No. It is alive! It just plunged into the sun. Surely it cannot have survived. According to my readings, Captain, the creature is still alive. - Not only alive, but feeding! - Feeding? On a star? Engine room! Full forward, now! All engines stop! Why are we stopping? Get us out of here! No. That thing, whatever it is, just destroyed an entire star system. If those planets had been inhabited, billions of innocent beings would have been wiped out. We must destroy that creature before it feeds again. - Eluke, where is the creature now? - Gone. - Just gone! - Connect me with the Empress. LILANDRA: No, do not pursue, return to me now. - Gladiator. - Yes, my Empress! Assemble the Imperial Guard immediately and make ready the Imperial Star Cruiser! - What has happened, my Empress? - Our worst nightmare. I'm afraid Jean Grey no longer exists. When she first inhabited Jean's body, we were thankful. Jean helped her protect us from the M'Kraan Crystal. But now Jean has been overwhelmed by the alien force within her. As long as Jean is alive, we can't stop trying. Of course, Scott, but we must also be honest with ourselves about the depth of the problem. Unless the Phoenix agrees to leave Jean's body, I see no way to save our friend. (GROANS IN PAIN) Professor, she's coming back. She's coming back. How do you know the Phoenix is returning? Jean is returning. Our psychic rapport is still functioning. We will do everything in our power to protect Jean. But at the same time we must do all we can to defeat the Phoenix within her or our world will not survive. How do you beat something that can melt you in a split second? - That's it! - What's it? - Why hasn't the Phoenix melted us? - How should I know? Because Jean has at least some control over the creature. That means there's still hope of reaching her. Ah, yes, its mind. The Inner Circle controlled the Phoenix-Jean entity, at least for a time, by attacking its most vulnerable spot. But, Beast, it's Jean's mind! I do not propose to harm her mind, only disable it. A mnemonic scrambling device would temporarily prevent her from forming coherent thought. That could cause the creature to leave her! My thoughts, exactly. How could I have not seen it? All those weeks we worked to make Jean whole again, simply made her the perfect host. Phoenix, why do you still inhabit Jean's body? Your work is done. You do her harm by remaining! (PHOENIX LAUGHING MANIACALLY) One mnemonic scrambler, made-to-order. Now, to find a suitable test subject. Volunteers? (GROANS IN PAIN) - What is it? - It's Jean. - I feel her presence. - Where? Here? No, somewhere near. A place from her past. A place full of emotional memories. Mom, Dad, I'm home. Mom? Dad? Mom? Are you here? Prometheus! (HISSING) Prometheus, it's me. Jean. (SQUEAKING) Daddy? Daddy's home! Daddy? Is that you? Daddy? Where are you going? Daddy? Forgive me, chere, this is the only way. Fools! ROGUE: Why ain't that brain buster working? Patience, Rogue. It should take effect momentarily. Jean, my friend! Do not reject our help. - Let your mind... - I have no friends! What is this, "catch the X-Men" day? Her mind is more powerful than anything I could imagine. She has overloaded the scrambler's circuitry. We knew it could come to this. - We got to end it. - Logan? - Jean? - Do it. Quickly, while I still have control. Stop her now! I can't! Please, if you truly love me, don't let her... You should have destroyed me when you had the chance. What a pity, Beast. I've ruined your little toy. Now we'll play on my terms! C YCLOPS: Let them go. Jean. Jean Grey no longer exists! I know you're there, Jean. I can still feel you. You cannot destroy your friends. Don't be so sure! I love you, Jean. We all love you. And you love us. You love me. Nothing will ever change that. Scott? Scott, I... (JEAN SCREAMS) C YCLOPS: Jean! I'm sorry, Scott. But I had to attack her mind while she was distracted. As long as I've got her back, safe and... I only stunned her. The creature inside her must be destroyed now. Quickly. - No. - Now. Before she... Recovers? You're too late. And as for you, (XAVIER SCREAMS) You once told Jean Grey that the greatest joy a teacher has is to be surpassed by his own pupil. - Enjoy! - JEAN: Stop! I won't allow you to enter my... (JEAN SCREAMING) In the battlefield of the mind, my will shall prevail! Do you really think your puny mind is a match for mine? As you once used the power of the Phoenix to bind the M'Kraan Crystal, I now bind the Phoenix with the power of... (XAVIER SCREAMING) The conceit of you humans, the arrogance! Jean. If you can hear me, help me. Help me. Help me. This can't be. I am Phoenix! I now bind the Phoenix - with the power of my mind! - No! No! (XAVIER GROANS) (JEAN GROANS) - Professor! - C YCLOPS: Jean! - Professor, will she be all right? - Jeannie. The Phoenix is contained, for now. I could never have defeated the Phoenix if Jean herself had not helped me. The strength of her mind is truly awesome. - Hi, four-eyes. - Hi yourself, tiger. ROGUE: We got company. C YCLOPS: The Shi'ar. Greetings, Charles. Lilandra! What is the matter? Why didn't you alert me telepathically? Charles Xavier, it is the decision of the High Council of the Shi'ar Empire that the being known both as the Phoenix and as Jean Grey, must be destroyed! Lilandra, stop this! For the sake of all that live, Jean Grey must perish. Let's go. I never realized these underground passages were here. Yeah. Hey is it true... Is it true there's treasure here? I heard it from the former warden, so it has to be true. There's a spectacular treasure hidden here. Hey, is this it? Definitely. Do it. Yeah. What the... It's human! L-It can't be! What's going on? T-There's no treasure? It's still alive! What the hell are you? Who am I? Who in the world am I? K-Kill me... Please, kill me! Even if you are a criminal, we must respect your life. What are you? What the hell are you, anyway? My name is Michael... The one who keeps law and order. From this border on, this is Jesus Town. Please, present entrance permission visa. I repeat. Please, present entrance permission visa. Hey, stop! Come back here! It's tonight. Wait at the rendezvous point. Let's go. An unknown intruder has broken through the main gate. An unknown intruder has broken through the main gate. Hey, time to move. Go! Go! Warning. Do not move. You are now under our jurisdiction. Repeat. Warning. Do not move. If you do not obey... Can you hear it? The sound of the people's joy. Today we celebrate the third anniversary of Jesus Town. People call Jesus Town a place of miracles. Here there is love and peace above what has ever been achieved before. There is still poverty and confusion everywhere beyond this place. We are actually living in a modern Eden. Is anything wrong? I am moved. Look... This orchid was dying until yesterday, but today it is fully blooming. Even a tiny flower like this has a life. Reporting, Sir. Someone has broken the border gate and invaded Jesus Town. I have no choice. Call in the heavy soldiers. I want to protect everyone in Jesus Town. That includes the smallest life. You are justice and I am the servant of justice. That dream again. Hey, Kaoru! You okay? Kaoru! Hey! Let's go! What are you doing? What are you doing? Let's go! Get ready! Hurry! Hurry! Come on! All right, run! H-Help! Hurry! That way! This way! Not good. Parliament's heavy soldiers! What are we going to do, Kaoru? Run! Run! What is that? That's... Y-You bastard, do you have any idea what you're doing? Do you have any idea? Do you understand? P-Please, spare me! I was just following orders! If you don't have a will of your own, there is no reason for you to live. Transmitting images of intruder. T-That's Hakaider. Hurry! Die! Kaoru! Master Michael! Why didn't you die? If you truly deserve to be one of my men you would have fought and died. You shouldn't move yet. Relax, we're all friends trying to rebel against the government. This hideout isn't going to be found easily. Want some food? A robot doesn't need any food. Whoever heard of a robot that eats bread or soup? Hey, don't tell me it's love at first sight! You sleazy robot. Say, would you do us a favor? We need your help. Our country is controlled by Parliament right now. We have to destroy it! He's a weird robot. Maybe a nutcase. However you look at it, it's not human. We can't let it stay here. Yeah! I ain't trusting no robot. What if he breaks down and goes out of control? Shut up! I know. Hey, you came to save this country, didn't you? Then fight with us! We have to get Gurjev of Parliament! He talks of sweet things like love and peace, but what he's really doing is... Please, help! Please, stop! Get moving. Quit messing around! Anyone who shows the possibility of disobeying Gurjev will be caught. Stop, please! Kill me! No! No! No! And they insert a chip into the brain to erase all human emotions. Tears, laughter, and anger... To Gurjev, emotions only get in the way. Look. Now he will be reborn. In this country, no crime is allowed to occur. Any criminal... Any disobedient civilian will be given a new life by me. Beautiful. Just like children. I am their father. I must protect them with my own hands. From any threat. Such as Hakaider. Do you know that thing? The true identity of that robot? I had him made. Before your birth, we needed a lethal robot to protect the order of this country. However, the Hakaider Operation failed. We could not control him. And just before he was to be destroyed some scientists stole Hakaider and disappeared. He is sort of a ghost. He doesn't really exist. Hakaider only kills. Only destroys. He will bring chaos to my order! We must eliminate Hakaider, no matter what! Please, leave it to me. I am superior. Even to Hakaider. What Gurjev means by order is to take everybody's freedom away! If you resist him, he'll rearrange the inside of your head! He'll take your soul away. Peace in this country is fictitious. Everybody's always under surveillance and lives in fear. Look for this man, Hakaider. He's a dangerous individual and a threat to our peaceful country. Search for Hakaider! Please, fight with us to destroy Parliament. ...to save this country. That's right! If we destroy Parliament, we'll be the new leaders! Then we'll control everything! Let's live large! Don't get the wrong idea! These are precious funds! It's not your allowance! Don't be so square. We just wanna have some fun sometimes. Right? Idiot! You're slacking off too much. I have a dream of starting a ranch someday. So I'd better start saving. A ranch? You guys... Calm down. Being uptight is one of your weaknesses. Everyone has dreams. Don't you, Kaoru? You're not gonna to say, "to be an ordinary bride," are you? Anyhow, after destroying Parliament, any dream can come true. Because we'll be the law then. You are the same! You bastard! What are you doing? You damned robot! Just like Parliament, you are all ugly. Bastard! Arnie! Kaoru... Hey! Kaoru... You assholes! You killed him... You killed him... Our only hope... You... The invading artificial being has been destroyed. You killed him... You killed him... Our only hope... You're the same! You don't fight. You just look the other way. You killed him... You... Go to hell! Hey... Would you do me a favor? There's someplace I'd like to go. It feels great! This is my secret hangout. You're the first one I've ever brought here. It's the only oasis in Jesus Town. It's a natural spring. You should try some. Remember that talk... That talk about dreams of the future... Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be an ordinary bride... Why are you staring at me? You wanna come on to me or something? Well, okay then. But you'd better be good at it. I may look easy, but the truth is I ain't... Hey, you came to save this country, didn't you? Then fight with us! Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be an ordinary bride... Hakaider has entered the area. The halls of Parliament and 95% of the soldiers have been destroyed. All surviving soldiers proceed to the central hall. Do you want to live? Do you live and have a will of your own? I never believed someone like you could exist. Whether you're human or robot, we must keep discipline to maintain our order. Nonsense. Order made by whom? I don't recall accepting such rules. I am justice. In the name of justice, I will terminate you! Indeed... If you are justice then I am evil. Look. Do you know why flowers are beautiful? Because they are obedient. People should be like flowers. You and I will grow flowers together. And we will make them bloom. I made you. Following me is your destiny. I can give you even more power. I will decide my own destiny. I am the destroyer and the judge. You are a two. Out of here, both of you. Come on, out. Let's go. Yes, thank you very much. Go on. Hey, Dr. Doolittle, get your butt in here pronto. A dog that called 911? Are you trying to get yourself fired? Traitor. Well, you listen to me, Fowler. Unless you have an eyewitness, one without a tail, I suggest you go back and analyze your data and let real detectives make the arrests. Is that clear? Keep that dog out of my squad room. You did that on purpose. Of course I did. Why? Well, I may be a dog, but that doesn't mean I can't smell a rat. I trust you, Fowler. But this is crazy. You're a dog that talks. This turns theories of evolution upside down. I just wanted them to hear you. I told you I could only speak to the man who seeks the truth. That was supposed to be you. Chin Li was like a father to me, and now they've killed him. He deserves justice. You're right. I'm sorry. What I did was wrong. I'm sorry. Cho Cho, please. Come on, show me some love. One last chance. Shake on it? Shake? Really? Okay. Look, can we continue this in the bathroom? The bathroom? Why? 'Cause I got to take a whiz. Duh. What? Never saw guys taking a leak before? Freaks. Okay. Look, we're partners now, okay? You're not gonna kiss me, are you? I don't know you well enough. Look, just promise me one thing, all right? If we solve this case, you have to let the rest of the world know that you can talk. If we solve this case, I'll sing a love song to a cat in front of the whole squad. All right, we should start our investigation where Chin Li worked... the dog track, Cage's Kennel Club. Uh, uh, I'll make the decisions here. Detective. Is the dog from the crime scene? Yeah, he sort of followed me home. Guess I adopted him. Well, that was very sweet of you. Yeah. So, uh, anyway, I came to apologize. Apologize? Yeah. Most detectives make up their mind before they ever get to the crime scene, but you refused to take the easy way out. I should've backed you up, but I didn't. Oh, pshh, come on, no, no, no. That's, you know... I understand how it is. It's just how things work at the department. Yeah, well, either way, you're the kind of cop I want to be when I make detective. Yeah, well, it'll happen. Mm-mm-mm. I don't know. I'm really good on the streets, but I, uh, I choked on the written exam. Well, maybe, uh, next time, you know, you're studying for the written exam, maybe, I don't know, I could, I don't know, I could help you study, help... Ashley, we got a call. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. I got to go. We'll talk later? Yeah. Are you kidding me? That was your best shot? You didn't even get her phone number. So, uh, what, we going home? Nope, we're going to the races. Oh, that's great. What? Dog asks you to get on the case and nothing. But some tootsie bats her eyelashes and zippedy-doo-dah, you're Dirty Harry. Zip it, Fido. You know, females put out a signal when they're interested. I could smell some major flirtage going on there. Oh, so now you're an expert on romance, huh? This from a species who says, "Hello," by sniffing each other's butts. Oh, sorry, ladies. And now, a fast move by Southern Beauty. Southern Beauty on the outside. If I was a betting man, I'd say Southern Beauty by eight lengths. You've been right all day long, Daddy. Southern Beauty... You did it again. That little puppy's got some... a fire in her. Southern Beauty won again. That's four in a row, Dad. What a surprise, Eddie. Yes, a surprise, Eddie. There's a detective in the kennel... about Chin Li. Uh-huh. Well, bring him up, son. What's wrong with her? And they're off. These muscle-heads are an embarrassment to our race. Well, aren't you being a little catty? Pardon the expression. These dogs are athletes. Chasing an idiotic, mechanical rabbit? They're nothing but puppets of the man. Aw, don't be jealous. I'm sure you could keep up if you dropped a few pounds. Mr. Flower? I'm Detective Fowler. Are you looking for Mr. Cage? Yes. I'm Mr. Cage. You're Mr. Cage? I'm Edward Cage, managing director here at the Cage Kennel Club. If you're looking for my father, he's upstairs watching the races. Okay. Your dog will have to stay here, of course. You stay here, Cho Cho, and be a good doggy. And if you do, you get a little doggy treat. Good boy. Hey, I got a doggy treat for you. Good afternoon, son. Afternoon. I'm Hamilton Cage, and you are? Detective Fowler. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Cage. Uh-uh-uh. Rule you call me Hamilton. Edward you met. My son, my dear son and heir. Want a drink? Oh, no, I'm on duty, thanks. Get him a drink. And this is my little princess. My daughter Margret. President of Research and Development for my largest division, Biotech. And I suppose I should tell you a little tiny something about myself. Son, I was a... Orphaned as a baby. That's right. Educated in the Far East... A PhD in chemistry by the age of 20. You started Biotech Pharmaceuticals which you built into a world leader. Continue. Five years ago, you started Cage Sports Enterprises which includes a pro football team, CSE Sports Channel, and the Cage Kennel Club. Glory Hallelujah, I do so love a man who does his homework. You must be one heck of a detective, son. Aw, shucks. No, just more of an internet geek. Internet geek. That's a good one. Hey, what's with you? Calm down. Hey, over here, big boy. Well, howdy. Hey, that Southern Beauty's a wild one, isn't she? She didn't use to be. But you look like a dog who appreciates a woman with a little spunk. Oh, I do. Uh, tell me, uh... Mary Beth. Mary Beth. I'd like to know everything I can about this track. My mama told me to be careful around dogs who ask too many questions. You always listen to your mama? Practically never. Is there some problem, Detective? No, no, it's just, um, you seem like you're in remarkable shape for man of your... Age? I know you're trying to be diplomatic. But as you can see, good health is not just a business with me. It's a passion. That and the track. Oh, different kind of passion. And most of the credit for the track must go to my dear son Edward, my son and heir. Mmm-hmm. Well, so, if Edward was in charge of the track, he must have been the last one to see Chin Li alive, right? Ohh. What about that, Edward? Chin Li was working the morning shift feeding the dogs, but he was gone by noon. Chin Li was so much more than my friend. He taught me about trust, loyalty, generosity, action, focus. Everything I am today I owe directly to him. Sorry for your loss. Cho Cho. Has anyone thought about Cho Cho? Chin Li had a dog that was very important to him. Do you know where he is? It's funny you should ask. Cho Cho! I got to go. Can we continue this another time? Cho Cho! I've got a flea bath booked at six. Well, then, I'll see you later. Oh, yes. This mongrel was just a pup last time I saw it. We were closest to him in all the world, you and I. I know you miss him every much. Very decent of you to take Cho Cho in, Detective. It was before I found out he never stops talking. Barking. Never stops barking. Cho Cho, sit. My entire organization is at your disposal. I want Chi Li's attackers brought to justice. I'll do my best. Oh, do better than that. Get it done. Margret will show you out. We're counting on you. I did a little leg work, partner, What? Sweet little greyhound back there said they introduced a new feed to Southern Beauty and some of the other dogs. Huh. What are you doing? The magnetic strip on the ID cards carry a unique code for each employee, so I'm using COLAR to access the Cage Kennel Club Employee Database. And? Well, Chin Li did leave the kennel area gate by noon, but there's an entry and exit coming from the Biotech building at 8:55 p.m. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Feline fury coming on. What? Cat. What? I hate cats. Lazy, worthless layabouts, the whole lot of them. Look at that. You know, cats are behind the plagues of the Middle Ages; you know that, don't you? Are you insane? And I got my suspicions about World War II. And... and... and you... you think Oswald acted alone, huh? Well, I'm sorry. I just got some issues with the C-word I guess, that's all. I'm sorry. Look at that. It's Chin Li's killer. How do you know that's him? Don't you see the bandages on his left wrist? That's where I bit him. Give me those keys. * I got you running in circles. He's getting away. Officer in pursuit! Officer? Hey! You're not an officer, I am. Doesn't this come with power steering? Are you crazy? You can't drive! Oh, yeah? What do you call this... surfing? Stop the car! Code 12. Red team, go. Red team, go. Cho Cho! Stop! Who put that sign there? Stay on the road. * But you didn't count on this top dog coming around. * Hit the brakes; hit the brakes! I am hitting the brake. It won't stop. The accelerator's stuck. Bail out, bail out! Man overboard. Oh, God! Uh! Ahhh! No! I loved that car. This is not good. Oh, a little bodywork, a paint job, it'll be like new. I heard. How you doing? I'm doing good. It's a good day so far. You know, minus the teeny, tiny annoyance of no car, suspension, no future. It's a good day. Good times. Even when you're upset, you're still funny. I don't feel very funny. Well, you make me laugh. That must count for something. Units 5-10 and 6-14, please respond... Hey, what? Ask her. Ask her what? Never mind, I'll do it. Say, uh, why don't you meet me for dinner at the Amazon Cafe at 8:00? Amazon Cafe? It's a date. Why did you do that? Jeez, I don't know what other signals she can give you but jumping in your lap. Besides, I got a good plan. You'll do fine. I won't do fine. You said it yourself: I'm not a people guy. This date's going to go five minutes, then I'll say something stupid, and she's going to walk out. Don't worry about it, partner. I got a plan for that too. * You wanted to see me? I want you to stop what you're doing. Ha! Thought I was helping. The goal of this company is not to fix greyhound races, but to realize the potential for greatness that lies within us all. Ha! Have I made myself clear? Perfectly. Hii-yah! There's a meeting tomorrow in the new wing with Margret and the science team. I expect you to be there as well. I expect you to be there as well. It's all about the power within. Don't race the dogs too much. Don't drug them, whatever you do. Don't make any money. Hii-yah! * Okay, just relax. Just listen to me; repeat what I say. I know everything there is to know about girls. Enjoy your meal. Thanks. You okay? Your neck? Me? Oh, yeah, my neck's a little sore. I'm fine. Oh, good. Wow. You look really... What? Beautiful. Stunning. The smell of your skin takes my breath away. This doesn't sound like you, Peter. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's nice and all. But why the change? Right. What a good question. What a good question. Nothing like a good question. What am I, Plato? Uh, let's see now. Maybe you can try, "Life is full of change. Uh, but in this case, I must admit..." Oh, I'd love to lick your face and sniff your tail. No, you can't use that. You can't use that. Let's see, "In this case, I must admit..." In this case, I must admit... And this may sound bold... This may sound bold... You made me change. You made me change. My heart feels so close to yours. I just want to howl at the moon. I'm not sure if this new you is seducing me or scaring me. Well, I'm a man of more secrets... Than you could possibly imagine. Really? Name one. Name one? Yeah. Secret... what, you want to know what my big secret is? Well, I'll tell you. God, I hate cats. God, I hate cats. What's wrong with cats? Cats are lazy, unmotivated slobs, black holes of selfishness sucking dry the kind hearts of their masters. They're useless. Did you ever hear of a seeing eye cat? Or a watch cat? No. Wow. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Had a little cat rage there. I... it... j-j-just... just just overtakes me. Let me try to get it together. Uh, um, uh, try this: Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about Ashley Wilkenson, her hopes, her dreams... Her fantasies. Well... I want to tell you what's on my mind and in my heart. I'm listening, Detective. Since the first moment I saw you, there's something I've wanted to say to you. And I feel if I don't say it now, that opportunity could pass me by. That's good. Whoo! Wahoo. What is that? Look at the chassis on that lassie. What? What do you want to say? Woof, woof, woof, woof woof. Come on... What is an incredible dog like you doing in a joint like this? No... what? Ashley, I... Excuse me? I don't... I didn't mean... I didn't mean that at all. I mean, you're incredible, but you're not a dog. Ashley. Ashley. Please. Thanks a lot, Cyrano de Bonehead. Good night, miss. Ashley! Ashley, no, wait! Gah! Now what am I supposed to do? How do I know? I'm just a dog. If it was me, I'd chase the car. Ashley, wait! Okay, no more games. I'm just going to bark this out, okay? I love how strong you are. I love how sexy you look in uniform. I love the way you just say what's in your heart. And if only I could just find the strength to say what's in mine. Well, I don't know who was feeding you those corny lines earlier, but I like your own words much better. Yeah, me too. Let's go talk. Want to? You know, I'm not your typical guy. I'm not into sports, going to bars, you know. I don't really get out much either. You know, I'm not your typical dog. I'm not into chasing cars or playing fetch. I'm actually... not the party type. I never go to parties. Never have parties. Ooh, this smells... Oh, excuse me. Ladies first. I don't do hydrants. Whoa! Uh! You want to come back to my place? You know, maybe later? Oh. Uh! I'm sorry. It's okay, babe. Love hurts. * This is a nice neighborhood. Oh, yeah. It's, uh, it's an old boatyard. Got it for cheap, fixed it up, you know? You'll see. Is there a party? No, um, I just left my TV on. So. Um. I... I got to go. So there was a party. No, no, it's my cousins. They're in town. Yeah, okay. Bye. Ashley, wait. Come on, keep up. Rah! Rah! * Hey, I just saw Mrs. Rottweiler. She said the puppies have been up crying all night. Puppies? You dog! Coming through. Excusez-moi. Ay caramba. I'm so high. Hey, Bernie. Hey, we playing poker or what? Oh, I should have seen that one coming. All right, enough! That's it! I want all you four-legged, tail-wagging, Frisbee-catching, flea-scratching mongrels out of my house now. You... out. Out of here! You, beat it. Man, this ain't cool. Don't you give me that look. Ooh, yeah. Down! I'm gonna poo on his lawn. You thought this was a party? No, it was a conference on world peace. Fowler, I was undercover. Undercover? I was questioning the dogs on the street about what goes on at the Cage Kennel Club. Right. Not mine. As a matter of fact, the Dane's cousin dated one of the slower greyhounds there. Okay, right now isn't a good time to talk about dogs and their love life. It's not important. But this is. After a few months on that new dog food, that slower greyhound turned out to be Southern Beauty, winner of her last five starts. And guess what. Edward Cage always supervised feeding time. Really? COLAR. Yes, Peter? The last six greyhounds to win at over 20 to 1, how many of them are owned by Cage Sports Enterprises? Searching that data for you now. Four of them, sweetie buns, including Iron Thunder and Southern Beauty. Sweetie buns? This ain't no ordinary dog food. What if it's illegal or, worse, dangerous to the dogs? Well, if Edward is feeding the dogs some type of chemical energy formula and then betting on them, well, that's enough for an indictment on felony racketeering, and could possibly tie him to the attack on Chin Li. So we need what Chin Li was after, proof of the formula. And the last place Chin Li was before the attack was Biotech. The formula has to be in their mainframe computer. Bingo. Not you. I know you're not Bingo. Access denied. Access denied? Okay, we've got to break in there, but we've got to be really smart about it. All right, Fowler. What do you think of my disguise? Hey, give me that. Ow. Ew, doggy drool. Ow. What is this, bumper cars? Why don't you try going around the walls instead of through them? Should be a door marked "Fire Control" around here. There it is. You should be in here, and I should be driving. Did you hear me? Shut up. We're undercover. Shut up, we're undercover. I am, anyway. Easy, easy. I'm slipping; come up. If I want to be neutered, I'll go to a vet. Get in there. Come on. Hey, watch your hands, Romeo. Look out. Oh, God. I bet Lassie didn't have to go through this. Ow. Get in. Come on, push, push. Ow! This harness is going to ruin my love life. I'll tell you something: Tom Cruise had this figured out better. And I'm not getting $20 million, either. Good job, boy. All right, this is the place. What's happening? Whoa, big... b-b-big drop. Big drop. Hang on to that rope. Oh, easy. E-e-easy. Whoa! Wait a minute. I got to go back up and get my stomach. T-t-take it easy now. Uh! Slow. Take it slow. Whoa. Rope, don't fail me now. Hold it; hold it. Not too close... Don't let me hit the floor, I'll set off the alarm. Hold... hold... stop. Good. All right, now swing me back and forth. Fowler, I'm just hanging here. You're late. Everybody's already here. We have to stop the animal testing. Why? Stage four isn't complete. Well, why do you think? Father. You've seen the way he's been acting. She's so changed. Uh, yeah. There's no telling what he'll do next. He's out of control. Almost there. Back and forth, not in circles. Man, I'm gonna hurl. Straighten me out. Fowler, turn me around. I can't put the disk in with my butt. It's not my fault. Okay, okay, that's better. That's better. Uhh! Easy, easy. Here we go. Download in progress. All right. Three more minutes to download, and we're out of here. Downloading complete in 2 minutes, 48 seconds. Wait, somebody's coming. Get me up, up, up, up. Up! Up! Pull. Now it looks quite wonderful. A lab? Why wasn't I told about this? When did you have this done? As soon as I realized the awesome power of Lot 99. But I had to shroud it in deepest secrecy... Yes, even from my beloved children. Today I brought you all here to inform you that stage five testing is now complete. Stage five? Human testing. We haven't started that yet. Yes, we have. I'm proud to announce that I, myself, have been taking Lot 99 for the past, uh, six months. Ladies and gentleman, six months ago... A 76-year-old man. Or hadn't you noticed the change? Did you think this happened because I did a few extra sit-ups every day? Oh, no. Hamilton. That's unbelievable. Strength, vitality, eternal youth. Adults will never know sickness. Children will never be orphaned. We're close, people. Very close. My vital signs are equally impressive. It's him. Wolfgang, the guy I bit. What's happening? Keep up the good work. Yes, sir. Aw, come on, Cho Cho. You should be excited. We did it. Got the evidence to put them away right here. Excited? Cage and I were both students of Chin Li's. He was like a father to us. He let you down. He let everybody down. He betrayed the animals, and worst of all, he betrayed Chin Li. Maybe not. You know, maybe he was just trying to improve the herbs like he said, for mankind. How? By doping the dogs so he could make millions rigging races? That could've been Edward. It's not Edward. He's not smart enough. Besides, Cage's goon had a bandage on his left wrist exactly where I bit Chin Li's killer. We both know Wolfgang is Cage's muscle guy. One way or another, Cage is letting it happen. Easy, girl. And in Gate 4, Distant Thunder, winner of her last three starts. In Gate 5, Misery Loves Company. She's been off her feed in recent weeks, but still a viable threat. In Gate 6, Do-Si-Do. "Dominance" is her middle name. Dad, it's important. How important can it be, son? Trouble. Someone broke into the mainframe and... Speak into the microphone. Somebody broke into the mainframe and downloaded Lot 99. Oh. Oh. We found dog hairs on the computer. Cho Cho and Fowler. In Gate 7, the legendary Land's End. And finally, in Gate 8, a newcomer and certainly the underdog... me. Here. Hold it. Come on, puppies. Keep up. Boys, you ain't gonna believe this one. I got it this time. I got it. I cracked the case. Okay, Cage Sports Enterprises have been giving the greyhounds at Cage Kennel Club this type of performance enhancer, making millions of dollars on long-shot bets. Can you prove it? Yes, look. Right here. This is the formula for what they call Lot 99. What it does is, it enhances natural herbs to camouflage the added chemicals so they don't show up during tests. Now we think that Chin Li discovered it; tried to take a sample to the police. That's why they killed him. Bingo. Hi, hello, hi, hi. Thief or thieves of Lot 99, you have made a mistake big-time. Fowler... Not only will this computer blow, What the hell's this? So I have to go. You have exactly, uh, uh, uh, four seconds. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. Ahh! Fowler, what is... You cracked the case, Fowler, huh? And all our computers with it. I could have you transferred to another planet. Yeah. Yeah, good idea. This is definitely not good. * Hello? Peter? Hey. It's cold outside. You guys a little down? Yeah, well, we have reason to be. So you're just going to give up? Look, it's over, okay? Not only did my evidence go up in smoke, but there's not a cop on the force who believes me. I believe you. You do? The only way we can prove this case is if we finish what Chin Li started. We've got to get a sample of Lot 99. We? Yeah, we. Are you sure about this? I mean, let's face it: my career has gone to the dogs. Woof No offense. But, Ashley, we screw this up, you could say good-bye to any chance of becoming detective. My dad was a detective, his dad was a detective. I've been so obsessed about making detective that I've forgotten why I became a cop in the first place. Which is? To stop bad guys from hurting people... and animals. Watch out for this Wolfgang... Cage's bodyguard. He has a bandage on his left arm where Cho Cho might have bit him. That could tie him to Chin Li's death. Okay, I'm going to the vent lab. Ashley, you watch out for security. Cho Cho, you know what to do. Cho Cho knows what to do. Cho Cho...? * * Do, do, do, do, doo doo. * * Brrrrm, do, doo doo. Hoo ha! Whoo! * Do, do, doo doo, do... * Hey, Grandma, what are you doing out here? Listen, my name's Cho Cho, and I'm a cop. I need to get a sample of the stuff they've been putting in the food of the younger dogs. Don't touch that stuff. It's poison. It's like magic at first. It makes you faster, stronger. Then it begins to take over your mind. It makes you crazy. You get angry and mean. And then you start to get weaker and weaker. You know how old I am? No, even a mutt like me knows enough not to ask questions like that. I'm two years old. What? That's no grandma. That's Southern Beauty. Southern Beauty? Oh, no. Ashley, come in, where are you? I got it. I got the Lot 99. Ashley, come in. Where are you? Ahh... Shhh! I got it. Wait here, okay? I got to go find Cho Cho. Okay. Excuse me. I have a... a call. Uh-huh? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Cho Cho, where are you? Over here. Cho Cho. I got a sample of Lot 99. Let's get out of here. Better handle it with care. What are you talking about? Southern Beauty just died from it. Hold it. Don't shoot! It's just us. Fowler? Yeah. Oh, no. Well, me and my dog. What's he doing here? What are you doing here? We got a call. Armed intruder on the premises. Who made the call? I did. Lieutenant, this is the second time that your detective has, uh, broken in. I don't know whether he's working for a competitor or just obsessive. Either way, he's dangerous. That... that's a lie. It's Lot 99 that's dangerous. That stuff will kill you, Cage. Just like it killed Southern Beauty. I'm sure your superiors would love to hear about the rogue officers in your command. As a matter of fact, I'm playing golf with Chief Clark tomorrow. No, don't listen to him. He's under the influence of Lot 99. Now, you listen to me, Fowler. Unless you want to be cuffed and gagged, I'd keep quiet. Now, Mr. Cage, what can we do to make this right? And avoid a costly lawsuit? Something dramatic, I hope. Fowler, your gun and your badge. My mom has my gun. You're pathetic. What's that? Grab him by the paws. I can't get ahold of him. Grab his ears, then. What are they doing? No, let him go. Hey, what are you doing? He didn't do anything. Get off me. Hey! Who's in charge here? Pull him down. Cho Cho. Watch those fangs. Cho Cho! Cho Cho. Let him go! Please! Cho Cho! There's still no word from Officer Wilkenson? Okay, please keep calling her, and let me know the minute you find her. Okay? Thank you. And in business news... Volume up. In about an hour, CEO Hamilton Cage will be announcing the launch of Energy L99, a safe and natural energy supplement. Cage plans to have the herbal blend added to everything from potato chips to children's breakfast cereals. No, no, you maniac, you can't give that stuff to kids. Oh, my God. Take a deep breath, Peter. Whew. Okay, focus. Ashley, Ashley... Where's Ashley? One thing at a time. Oh, I got to get some help here. Forget the facts, Peter. Go with your gut. Sometimes you have to search all over the yard before you find out where one bone is buried. There you go. Now you're on to something. COLAR, you still have the floor plan data that was downloaded when we breached the Cage Biotech mainframe? Oh, you want to hack into the security cameras at Cage Biotech. Looks like I programmed some dog sense into you. Go. Show time. Curtain up. Keep scanning. I'm scanning. Cage's office. Yep. Okay... move on. We're moving on. Right... fire control hallway... You're in it. Move on. Movin' on. Mainframe. Keep scanning. We're still scanning. Fire control room. Good. Ashley. Oh, God. Enhance. Peter, do you want me to call the cops? We just did. Ashley, don't worry. Don't worry, I'm coming for you. Let me think. Search the address of the Animal Control Center, and download it immediately into my palm computer. You got it, boss. * Baby. * We done as good as we could do. * * So what if I bit a mailman but misunderstood you. * * Ooh, baby. * Why knock yourself out? * * I got the blues, blues, blues, blues. * Meow Is it over? Great. Hopefully we've heard the last of that dog-rap garbage. Kitty, how about a permanent cat nap? Hush, puppy. Dead dog walking'. Remember me, mutt? Made me look like a fool in front of them cops. Payback time. Dead dog walking. What a dork. That's my dog, and I want him back. Oh, yeah? And why would I do that? Well, I'll tell you why. Hannibal, meet the dogcatcher. This is Hannibal. He doesn't like dogcatchers. Every dog has his day, you know? All right, now I'm going after Ashley. You and boys try to break up the press conference. Get a 911 call in if you can. Yeah, I got a bone to pick with Mr. Cage. Nice doggy. Nice doggy. Doggy want a bone? You're a scientist, not a criminal. You don't want any part of this. This stuff will kill your father. But you can still save him... and yourself. Think about it. Let her go. Ahh! Rahh! * Ha! That's a burn. It's not him. Ladies and gentleman, may I have your attention. I am Edward Cage. I appreciate your patience. My father is currently... tied up by unexpected developments. I am sorry for the delay. He should arrive any moment. Hope so. Ha! Ladies and gentleman, Hamilton Cage. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please be brief. Today is a day where we celebrate the triumph of a human life. When you add all-natural L99 to your, uh, uh, products, they will transform themselves into the sustenance of... life itself. For L99 is... pure power. Pure, uh, uh... Pure, uh... uh... power. Pure, uh, uh... youth. Ladies and gentleman, I give you the future. I give you L99! * I don't know, but I've been told... * * I don't know, but I've been told... * * Kennel food is mighty cold. * Kennel food is mighty cold. * Sound off. * 1-2-3-4. Wait, what's going on? Dogs! You're going down, buddy. Okay, Dad, we got to go. Come on, follow me. Come on, look at me. Come on. Say uncle. Say uncle. Come on, Dad, we got to go. That's a good boy. Right around the corner. Now! Behind you! Where... where are we? Whoo, hello. Watch it, buddy. She's underage. I'll be 18 next month. Hey, cowboy. You talkin' to me? Nice job out there. You looking for Hamilton Cage? Well, he went thataway. Which was is thataway? The elevator, Dick Tracy. Thanks. You're okay... for a cat. Hey, take care of yourself. And come back and see me sometime. Son, this is the roof. I've radioed the helicopter. They'll be here any minute. Are you out of your mind? Retreat in our moment of triumph? Never. Triumph? You're out of your mind. I'm out of my mind? Didn't I say you were out of your mind? I'm not out of my mind. You're out of your... Oof! Cage, you don't know what you're doing. You're hurting everybody. Turn yourself in. Now. Never. Daddy? You're sick, Cage. You have to be stopped, and I don't want to have to hurt you. Well, that's certainly going to make this fight a whole lot easier for me. * Hii-yah! Intriguing. Chin Li's two best students... face-to-face. So you want to play games? Okay. Not to be uh, outdone... Ha! Huh! Ooh, doggy. Ooh, doggy. Come on. Oof! You're some package, puppy. Very clever. Well, I'd give you about a six... out of ten. That's for all the times you made a dog go fetch. Ching! Fetch this. Whoooa. Hey. Yow. Let's get, uh, serious, shall we? Oh, no. That scar. It was you I bit. It was you. Don't be so surprised. Huh! Ha! Ouch! Chin Li was like a father to you. Well, he wasn't my father. My father died and left me alone. And then I searched for that fountain of youth, so that no child would ever orphaned again. Chin Li tried to spoil that. Come on, fight like a man. Look at what you've become, Cage... a monster. A monster? If only you could feel it... the power of Lot 99 coursing through your veins like liquid gold. Hoo-ha! Want a piece of me, dog? I want justice. Well, come and get it. Huh! Hii-yah. * I'm top of the world, Daddy. Please, for Chin Li, surrender. Never. Waa-haa! Whoo. Ha ha! Missed. Missed again. Try again. Keep trying. Missed. Good try. Missed. Missed again. Ooh-ah! Hello, Clarice. * Whoosh! Okay, my ultimate weapon: super lick. Okay, here we go. Left, right. Left, left, right, right, right, right, right, left, right. Uh! And finally, this one's for Chin Li. Hii-yah! I'ma coming, Daddy. Uh! You think I'm finished? You're right. Uh! Cho Cho. Good job, Cho Cho. That was incredible. Thank you. Had to be done. Hamilton Cage, there's something I've wanted to say to you for a while. You're under arrest for kidnapping, racketeering, cruelty to animals, and conspiracy for the murder or Chin Li. Oh. Fowler! You hurt my daddy. Uhh! No! Oh, no. Cho Cho. He's been shot. Ashley, get an ambulance. Don't get all emotional. It's embarrassing. Next thing I know, you'll be licking me. Hang in there, partner. Partner? Partner. I like that. It gives me great pleasure to introduce the recipient of the San Francisco Police Department's Medal of Valor, Detective Peter Fowler. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. You know, I used to wonder what bravery really was. It was something that you'd learn, something you'd develop. But what I discovered is that bravery exists within us all: man or woman, human or animal. You just have to find it. Sometimes you need help to do that. So I'd like to dedicate this medal to someone who saved my life, someone who taught me what I really needed to learn, someone who I wish could've been here today, someone who was there when I really needed him, Cho... Cho Cho. Ladies and gentleman, the dude who really deserves this medal, Cho Cho. Now you remember what you promised. What? What did I promise? * Hello, baby. * Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speaking. * * Oh, you sweet thing. * Do I what? * Will I what? * Oh, baby, you know what I like. * * Chantilly Lace had a pretty face * * and a ponytail hanging down. * I couldn't tell you. I promised him. * Lord, made the world * go round, round, round. * Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl * * to make me act so funny, * make me spend my money, * make me feel real loose * like a long-necked goose, * like a... * Oh, baby, it's-a what I like. * What's that, baby? But... But... But... Oh, honey. Hey, Fowler. Yeah, Fowler! But... * Oh, baby, you know * what I like. Whoo. Yeah! * Chantilly Lace had a pretty face * * and a ponytail hanging down. * A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk, * * Lord, made the world go round. * * Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl * * to make me act so funny, make me spend my money. * * Make me feel real loose like a long-neck goose, * * like a... * Oh, baby, that's-a what I like. * Cho Cho has left the building. * Hey, my name is Cho Cho. * Go ahead and laugh. * Just be careful what you throw my way * * 'cause I can dish it right back. * * The way I see it, if variety is the spice of life, * * I'm a vintage wine. * And on top of that, I'm man's best friend, * * but don't you ever cross that line. * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * I'm the one who seeks the truth. * * I have from the start. * I learned it ain't so much your mind. * * You got to follow your heart. * * The way I figure it, * I can't dwell on yesterday, * * 'cause I can't change the past. * * I got to look ahead and not behind. * * For me, life goes by fast. * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * It don't matter what others may say. * * We can make this work. * But don't mind me if the mood should strike. * * This dog's known to dig a little dirt. * * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * 'Cause I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * On my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * Good God, what size is yours, then? You're one of the few people in this office with no chance of ever knowing, Charles. This is the Forte. They've just brought it in at Beanies. What's that? The Piccolo? Even if your drinks weren't penis substitutes... You'd know all about those. Bet you've got a drawer-full. You shouldn't buy coffee from Froth's or Beanies. Every sip from one of those places is raping Colombia and enriching an American corporation. Yes, well. Morning! Well, frankly, the little Italian cafe that you patronise can hardly be called a pattern of ethical virtue. It's like something out of the Sopranos, isn't it? Thank-you. Milk in first, leaf not bag? I just followed the e-mail. MARTIN: Sorry you're late, Cat. Overslept? Oh... yes. I left her sleeping. You slept with him? Christ, no. If I'd had sex with Jamie, I'd have left the house earlier than usual. I was up late watching these. The boxed set of Friends, including the lost episode and network trailers. Oh, dictionary corner, Jamie. The government needs a word for its new policy announcements. They can't call it a relaunch - they've had three already this year. I think there's a Thesaurus on this. There are no synonyms for relaunch. Oh. Technology failure, everyone. Jamie's having to fall back on his brain. "A New Beginning"? That gives the impression that they're changing tack. They are! We know that. But they want panic to look like consistency. What about "Same Shit, New Bucket"? JAMIE: "The Big Ideas"? Then they'd get sued for misrepresentation. It would be so much easier if politics were like software. They could just call it Bollocks 1, Bollocks 1.1, Bollocks XP Home Edition... Oh, look, there's a story about our Fatties campaign... TV: Profits of up to 30%. Business commentators say the shift reflects recent bad publicity over obesity in Britain and a government campaign on healthy eating. With me is the Shadow Health Secretary John Kennedy. Mr Kennedy, isn't this a triumph for the government? Their healthy eating message getting through? No, I don't accept that. But the government has just run a huge advertising campaign with the slogan... Don't Be A Fat-Head, and fast-food chains can't give chips away. You're saying it's coincidence? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Can't they get beyond just disagreeing with the other side? It's so unsophisticated. Yes, I know. The trick is compliments with a sting. This government's doing a great job, if you like extremism, political correctness, cronyism... Look, this hasn't happened because the government's paid some smart PR firm to convince people they want to be thin... Oh, hasn't it? I must say, I'm very glad to see our healthy eating campaign for the government is getting through. Though remind me not to use you as a spokesman. PR, young Jamie is about theory not practice. A philosopher may well be able to argue that a table doesn't exist, in principle. But he can still have his dinner off one. Why is the public junking junk-food? Because this is about Iraq. The public are voting with their mouths, saying to this government and its bosses in Washington, we're sick of your milk shakes. And I'll go further. In the past, we have boycotted South African wine and Zimbabwean... whatever it is Zimbabwe produces... in order to send messages to regimes despised around the world. I am asking the British public for an economic boycott of another hated administration. Let's stop buying all American food and drink. Say no to a Big Mac, say no to Iraq! I love the smell of a career burning in the morning. You think he's finished? Rule number one of British politics, don't piss in the Atlantic. The Leader of the Opposition won't tolerate Kennedy inventing foreign policy on television. He'll have to sack him for that. It's a smashing place, full of really lovely folk and locations. Namibia's main export is diamonds and, you know, that's right. Because this country is a real gem. Was that "Beautiful Botswana"? "Nice Namibia". It's homework. I always said I'd rather saw off my leg than watch a Peter Harrow programme. Ah, the tone doesn't change much. In his Zimbabwe programme, he said what a lovely smile Mugabe had. Well, now he's invited Alison and me for lunch. He's probably unsure about whether to take the knighthood from the Queen or go straight for beatification from the Vatican. Charles, there's a call from the American Embassy. Send it through upstairs. MAN: OK. That's the iris scan done. Do we conclude from all this that Britain has been added to the axis of evil? Sir, I have to warn you that humour can become a security issue. OK. Now just a few questions. Is it now... Or has it ever been? Is it now, or has it ever been, your intention to overthrow by force the government of the United States of America? Good lord! Don't tell me that thing can read minds as well? Meanwhile, there's been an escalation of support for the Shadow Health Secretary's call for a boycott of American food and drink. Many restaurants have taken American dishes off their menus. In London, people have been taking their protest against American fast-food outlets to the streets. Oh, the bonfire of the calories. How uplifting. Gentlemen, the government of the United States of America is grateful for your attendance today. Well, it shows your country is more forward-Iooking than people think. I assumed the US Ambassador would be some sort of lard-arsed red-neck. Prejudice can be a terrible thing. Mr Ambassador, Charles Prentiss and Martin McCabe. Your Excellency. J Thompson Lucas IV, Ambassador to the Court of St James. My friends call me Tommy. Gentlemen, I like to start these little meetings with a prayer. O, Lord, may thy wisdom be as a light unto the nations of the world. Amen. Amen! Hear, hear. Absolutely. I'm sorry, gentlemen. It may be a little stale in here. We've had to switch the air-con off. Students are holding a bagel-burning under the vent. You've met Hazel... under-secretary for public affairs? May we offer you some fine iced tea? You couldn't run to heated-up tea? This is kinda the way we like it. Gentlemen, we have brought you here to help us solve a mystery. Why does everybody hate America? I'll have the clam chowder, please. And a Waldorf salad to start. Easy on the walnuts, if that isn't too much trouble. I'm afraid we don't have either of those dishes today. Oh, Lord. Well, look, I'II, er... You two... I'll have the hamburger. Rare - in fact, tell the chef haemophiliac. We've taken the American dishes off the menu. Most people have the special. What's that? Fish and chips. Right. Christ. It might be cool to have ONE English retro dish on the menu as an ironic option, but not as a theme. Thank you for seeing me at such short notice. If all our clients were as little trouble as you, Prentiss McCabe would go out of business. Ah. I rather feared that's how you see me. This problem you want us to deal with... Yes. These are the latest press cuttings you sent me. "Is Peter Harrow The Nicest Man In The World?" "The Man I'd Love To Marry." "Britain's Most Shaggable Guy." I don't see the problem. You think these press cuttings are good? But have you seen where they've come from? These two come from Saga magazine. The headline goes on, "The Man I'd Love To Marry When My Husband Dies." This one, "Britain's Most Shaggable Guy." That comes from Sex For The Over-Seventies magazine. You see, I have a reputation for being nice and being old. The last travel show the BBC bought was Chris Moyles Monsters Marbella. The BBC have been sitting on Sublime Sudan for 18 months. Absolutely. That's why I need you to help me. I've had enough of being TV's Mr Nice. I need to be hated! It's unusual. Our job is normally, "She certainly didn't look 14." "He downloaded the images for his new book." That kind of thing. What you need is a reverse makeover. A hate-over! We've had some of the best minds in Washington working on this for a month, and we just do not get it. I mean, America - what's not to like? Um, Korea, Vietnam, Libya, Grenada, Iraq. The movies of Chevy Chase. Malaya, Suez, the Falklands... Iraq... Benny Hill. Gentlemen, the situation is, as I am being driven through the streets of London now, I see Ronald McDonald burning on bonfires, I see Budweiser being poured down storm-drains. Peanut-butter sales in the UK are down 90% this fiscal. Now, bad enough when the Brits all want to be skinny. But this... this Kennedy guy is running the Boston tea party in reverse. You have an expression, um, "what goes around, comes around." Do you remember that time when you were boycotting Burgundy wine and Evian water? Chirac dissed us on Iraq. Yes. Did it never occur to you that while you were renaming French fries "freedom fries" that someday someone might do the same to you? This Administration accepts that the United States has made enemies. This Administration wishes to make a fresh beginning. We want you to create a campaign that will convince the people of Britain to LOVE America again. I'll get that. I absolutely insist. You're too kind. No, it's the least I can do. I wasn't being English. I mean it. You are too kind. This is what we have to stop. Some other time, maybe. If you'll excuse me, I've got to go. I'm judging an art exhibition. Great Ormond Street. Terminal Ward. Poor kids. That's great. No, it's better than that. It's perfect. Sit down, have a brandy. Bunk off the sickle exhibition. Pictures of weeping chemo-kids in tomorrow's papers. We couldn't buy better publicity than that. Look, Jamie, maybe this could be like the last bar of chocolate before I go on the diet, eh? Oh! I almost forgot the tip. What a lovely man. Alison, did you miss this meeting? Religion. Little Jimmy Osmond. Neo-Conservatism. Spelling. J-Lo. Excellent. Now, GOOD points about America? Ben Jerry's. Botox. CHARLES: Come on, I know this is difficult. No-one's ever spun a whole country before, but... Well, there are historical examples, but they all involve either changing the name of the country or putting the black population in charge - neither of which will go down tremendously well in Middle America. CHARLES: Oh, come on! Surely the world's only superpower has got more going for it than ice-cream and cosmetic surgery. Right turn on red light if road clear. I'd bring that in here if I were transport minister. It'd be LEFT turn. Come on, Alison. You haven't said anything yet. I'm not really the person for this. Before John Kennedy was on to this, I was boycotting America. I have nothing to do with the place at all if I can help it. Oh, yes? What's your favourite film then? The Piano. Oh, Christ. Obviously. Well, apart from The Piano? Um, When Harry Met Sally... um, Lost In Translation. Um... Annie Hall. Hardly un-American activities, then. And your favourite TV shows? Um, Friends... Frasier... Seinfeld, er, Will And Grace. I think we may have discovered the truth of world politics. The only people who can be convinced of the point of America are Americans. I think the solution lies at the English end of things. I'm going to ask John Kennedy to have lunch with me. What's the point? You won't stop him spouting anti-American stuff. I don't want to stop him. I want to encourage him to carry on spouting. The English cod and French fries, please. Oh, tell me, any complaints about the new menu? The occasional American tourist. We send them round the corner to McDonalds. Sir? The all-day full English breakfast for me. And to drink? Oh, tea, tea. And in a blue-and-white striped mug, if you've got one. So, why did you want to see me? Well, as an old college friend... Which you weren't... I'm delighted to see you doing so well. No, you're not. The word at Westminster is that you're working for the American Embassy against me. No, I'm not. Yes, I am. But in PR - we're not like politicians. We don't have to believe everything we do. I'm taking their money because they asked first. But yours is the campaign that really fascinates me. There's never been anything like it in British politics. You've always said you wanted to be this nation's John Kennedy, and now... in a sense... you are. How prescient of your parents to name you after him. I know. When the Lib Dems got a Kennedy for a leader, I thought that had bollocksed it. But people never thought of Jack when they looked at him. No. More Teddy, really. So you want me to believe that you've come here to give me some free advice? Don't be silly, John! No, in my business, we take a fee off a urinal after pissing in it. Tell me, John, why don't you trust me? Because you're a satanic, amoral double-dealer who's employed by the other side. Well, you're right. I am a total bastard. And I'm playing both sides. But I won't tell my colleagues, my client, the Chancellor of the Exchequer about you, if you think that my advice is worth paying for. Well, I may, when I've heard that advice. Well, we both know, John, that you've always wanted to be leader of the Tory party. What I have in here will transform your career forever. Read it. People will call it the speech of your life. Yes, hello, this is Alison at Prentiss McCabe, leaving a message for Lulu. Um, Lulu, I got your message about whether we can get you on to Celebrity Enema. Um, I've spoken with Channel 4, and it seems that it was just an April Fools spoof in Broadcast magazine. Yep, there's actually no such series. Sorry about that. Cat, could you call Michael Winner and Jeremy Clarkson and tell them the same, please? Thanks. There's a huge picket line of liberals outside, shouting, "America, wake up and smell the coffee!" Right, let's love-bomb the Peter Harrow problem. Cat? Just nudge me a bit. Client or colleague? TV's "Mr Travel". How do we turn Mr Nice into Mr Vice? He could always sleep with your sister at your cousin's wedding. Seems to be an effective method. I'm just using that as a generic example of bad male behaviour. Although you're famous for never coming up with an idea without researching it. So, what we need is for Peter Harrow to be accused of sexual deviance and falling professional standards. Does he have a mistress who could blab? No. He fell in love with a 14-year old... That's good - the Bill Wyman of TV travel. ...when he was ALSO 14. They've been together 50 years now. Bastard. OK... Incest? No. Only child. JAMIE: It's actually quite hard to come up with anything shocking. 40 years ago, BBC presenters were sacked for getting divorced. Now, if they hump a donkey, they're on the next series of I'm A Celeb. Cat, have you got a copy of Harrow's Super Switzerland episode? Haven't you seen his back catalogue? It's for the American campaign. VOICEOVER: Britain, 2010. A fast-food giant has driven out English restaurants from the high street. If you buy the super-size fondue, you get a free William Tell doll. VOICEOVER: At the local cinema, the latest blockbuster is playing. And home-grown bands don't have a chance of topping the charts. (YODELLING) If there HAS to be a world superpower, aren't you glad it isn't Switzerland? Not bad, Jamie. Not bad at all. Which is why, Ozzy, I think you're made for the part of Shane in Emmerdale. He is a tramp, yes. Monosyllabic, but it's a great little cameo. He does indeed die in the first episode, but who wants to hang around Emmerdale, watching their career give up the ghost? And you'll be up for Best Guest Artist In A Role of Under Eight Words at the British Soap Awards. You might think you recognised the angry customer screaming at staff in that CCTV footage filmed at a London hotel this week. But then you'll have thought, "It can't be, because Peter Harrow - TV's Mr Nice - "would never do that." Right? Well, wrong, according to the tabloid newspaper which obtained that footage. The Daily News alleges that television's veteran traveller insisted three times on a change of room and responded with four-letter words when staff refused him a fourth move. We're joined by Mr Harrow's PR representative, Jamie Front. I suppose you're going to give us the usual flimflam about this being taken out of context? No. In fact, for those of your viewers who lack lip-reading skills, what Mr Harrow is saying on the footage is... "I realise that, in the pathetic little country you come from, "beds are not a high priority "because the women sleep on brothel cots and the men on mortuary slabs. "But I have walked on marble floors in Spanish cathedrals "which were more comfortable than what you laughingly call a mattress. "If you and the other Colombian drug mules "behind the reception desk weren't so busy "dashing to the lavatory to retrieve the condoms full of cocaine "floating around your bellies, "then maybe you'd have some time for your customers." Then he goes on to compare the bar staff with the Nazi party... but you get the general idea. I do. Impressively honest as well. But who do you think leaked this video to the press? It was clearly somebody determined to destroy Peter Harrow's reputation. Well, that person may have failed because we're just hearing, Jamie, that Peter Harrow has issued a full apology to the hotel staff involved... and he has agreed to give a charity lecture there. Jamie, that's got to be good news for you as his PR, hasn't it? Yes. That is entirely typical of Peter Harrow. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Force of habit, I suppose. The Times Diary rang me to ask how I felt about the hotel reception thing. I just wasn't thinking, and said, "I'm so terribly sorry." I'm so terribly sorry. I don't think I can forgive John Kennedy for tapioca being the dessert of the day at the Ivy. But I'm going to give you a second chance. I want you to go to Heathrow Airport... The American President last night authorised emergency aid to the US beef and corn industries which have been hit by John Kennedy's campaign against junk food. And there's more bad news for the White House. Mr Kennedy, encouraged by the success of his campaign, has now announced plans to stand against the leader of the opposition. Sources close to the Shadow Health Minister have suggested he'll use his first public appearance since challenging for the leadership to set out the key strategy of his manifesto. Aren't you going to stay and find out who the leader of the opposition is? Very useful for pub quizzes. I thought you said you were going to fix Kennedy. I did, didn't I? Gentlemen, this is a precaution. The FBI has put out an alert about anthrax aftershave. Yeah, I'm sorry, Tara, it was an April Fools joke... Hello. What? Oh, no. Jamie, Peter Harrow's been arrested. If there has to be a world superpower, aren't you glad it isn't Switzerland? Why everybody loves America. That had a slickness that was almost... American. The rest of it is just variations on the same theme, really. Belgium fills the high street with waffle bars. Canada replaces the Grand National with moose racing - that sort of thing. Excuse me, Mr Ambassador, we're hearing that John Kennedy's going nuclear. Think not about what that country has done to you, but rather what you can still do a dead end. –They have nothing for us? –That's what they said. God! We gotta nail him, like right now. Okay, so we keep at him. We hit him long enough and hard enough, he'll get the message. You an expert on making guys long and hard? Hey, this isn't funny. I mean, it's the goddamn first day, and the bosses are already talking about making changes. Anybody here feel like going back to their old post? Huh? Look, I hate to say this, but, uh... I think we need a shortcut. Like what? Maybe we need to squeeze a guy in Lionel's outfit, make him produce some evidence for us. That'd speed things up a bit. Produce as in plant? Hey, we all know that this guy's an asshole in the first degree. It's for goddamn sure this isn't the first body he's responsible for. –I don't know, man. –You just hear me out. A high-profile bust gets us credibility out on the street and with the bosses. Once we get our feet on solid ground, get a couple of wins under our belt... we go back to doing it the right way. Hey, we need this. Just this once. Hey, where we goin'? Ain't no police station this way. Yeah, well, we a mobile unit. Why you in such a hurry to go to jail anyway? Bringin' me in for a couple of joints, man? I ain't doin' time for no three sticks of chronic. With your record, I wouldn't be too sure. You're gonna help us build a case against Lionel. Are you on the pipe? –You see that? –We had our own tagger do some work. We're the new king of this jungle. –You think painting' a snake on the wall makes you top dog? –Wanna go back for possession? You guys may be the cops, but Lionel's the law around here. You gotta bring it a lot heavier than this to change people's minds. –I don't think he's gonna cooperate. –Give it time. –If he doesn't? –I'm thinking. You know what? Screw Rondell. We'll just try another homie. –Lionel will catch wind of it. –Can't stake him out. He's smart. If we bring him in for piddley shit, Captain Ass will just kick him. Why don't we get a warrant based on suspicion of the shooting? We drop the evidence ourselves. Lionel will scream "setup." And that's exactly what it will look like. –It can't even remotely appear like we brought the shit in. –No. No, we've gotta have another cop find it. How about planting it in his car? Crib's the best bet. When's it empty? It isn't. He's got girls streaming in and out of there day and night. We don't need you to tell us when they call. –We'll just wait, get the page ourselves. –No, they use a code. Without me, the number won't make any sense. I tried to interrogate our victim again. She still won't talk. They don't trust the police. That's why they come to me for help. I do this community a service. It's not just about the money. I help families pro bono... Cut the champion of the people crap. –So what happened? –Mayfield Duffy... pushed a cart full of groceries out of the store without paying. When my husband went to stop him, he got attacked. –What did he hit you with? –A bag of ice. –Go call the paramedics. –Mayfield is okay. He just had a bad run. No work. –He said he will pay for the stuff later. –I told him we don't do that. No money, no groceries. Look, I don't wanna get Mayfield in no trouble. I just want the money or the groceries back. Well, sir, he committed a felony. We're gonna have to arrest him. Well, then go do it. He took perishables. –Yeah? –Step out of the apartment, please. –You Mayfield Duffy? –Yeah. –Step down, please, sir. –Hands out of your pockets, sir, and behind your head. –What's the beef? –Turn around. –I told him I'd pay him. –Before or after you struck him? –Is Otto okay? I didn't mean to hit him hard. –Yeah, he's okay. Second set of cuffs. You know there are places where you can go for aid, sir. –I got aid. Then I got robbed. –Robbed? I get food stamps twice a month. That punk gangster in 29... keeps breaking into the mailbox and stealing everybody's food stamps. It will be days before I can get some more. Meanwhile, my family's starving. What am I supposed to do? Not commit a felony. –Use this purse. –It's got a false bottom and a remote mike inside. –What's that, coke? –Crack. The sentencing is more severe. Give me your purse. Come on. I want you to go inside Lionel's apartment. You tell him that you're willing to pay a street tax... to stay out working and stay safe. –I don't even know this guy. –He knows about you. You hide the crack in his bathroom, under the sink or something. This is the guy who shot up Wanda? It'll be a pleasure then. Hey, hey. You're miked. We can hear everything. If at any time the mike fails, we'll be in there, okay? –Okay. –Listen. This guy is bad. If it seems dangerous, you just say the word "gringo." Then we come riding to the rescue. –Gringo? –Yeah. Right. Hey. I mean it. Any sign of worry, you say the word. –You Happy Sandez? –Yeah, that's me. What of it? You the same Happy Sandez that's been breaking into people's mailboxes... stealing their food stamps? –Food stamps? –I don't need no ghetto coupons. –Happy, we got your sheet, man. You got three priors for theft and no job. Why don't you give those people their food stamps back so they can eat? I'm missing the game. I tell you what, Happy. My partner and I are gonna go around the corner for exactly two minutes. And when we come back... either the food stamps you took are sitting on that bottom step... or I'm gonna call some detectives down here... and they're gonna turn your life upside down. You got it? You got two minutes. Screw Ringo. I'm willing to pay you. –I don't wanna get shot up. –Smart thinking', sweet pea. –So are we cool then? –Nah, not quite. See, I like to know what I'm puttin' on the streets. Come here. Right here. –He wants to taste the kitty. –Sure. –Just let me run to the bathroom. –What for? To pop in my diaphragm. No need, baby girl. I ain't hitting that raw. –Oh, yeah. –Oh, God. The broker is a pipeline, but he's decent. If we talk to him the right way, he'll talk. That broker is a dead end. I got my witness coming in. I think she's our best bet. You know, I got 30 years experience says... if we slap this broker with obstruction of justice... he misses one home-cooked meal, he'll talk. –Tom's got seniority. Follow his lead. –The witness is here. –Hi. I'm Detective Gannon. Thanks for coming. –Carry on. So, uh, hypothetically... how would you go after the broker? The boss wants to do it Gannon's way. And he's going his way. Doesn't mean we can't go ours. They teach you that in the classroom? Goddamn, you're tight. Oh, God. –You ain't gonna dis me again, right? –No, I swear. Right? –I'm going in. –Hey, hey, hey. She didn't say gringo. –I'm going. –Hey! We don't have a warrant. And we're only gonna get one shot at this. All right? I don't care. Hey, God-goddamn it! Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man. Hey. She's a pro. This is what she does for a living. We gotta make this case, right? Right? –Oh, for God's sake. –Hey, Vic, Vic, Vic. Come here. Come here. Hey, look. We're almost there now, right? All right? It's in the bathroom, under the sink. God. Vic, I'm okay. Vic. I need to score before you take me home. –Nice digs, David. –Nice enough. You don't sound too excited. No, I am. It's just... Gilroy's stocked the pond with his own fish. I'm still figuring out what waters are safe to swim in. I could use a friendly face working here. Is this gonna be like the time you tried to get me to work Narcotics in the Valley? –It'll be different. –How? You'll say yes. –I'm happy in Robbery. –This is more money, more action, more fun. –So what's the job? –Gilroy's pick for the Strike Team, Vic Mackey. There's a spot on the team. Take it. If Mackey doesn't work out... you'll take his place. –Run the Strike Team? Even if he does work out, it's still a great gig. Come on. It's a no-lose situation for you. Your boy's going down tonight. The question is are you going down with him? Lionel's got drugs in his crib. –Lionel don't keep drugs at his crib. –I guess he got sloppy. Makes me wonder. You ever get sloppy? You wouldn't. Aw, shit! So we busted Rondell here on possession for distribution. –He wants to deal now. –What can you offer us? –My boss, Lionel. –We think he did the drive-bys. I made deliveries to his house. He's got product there. You gotta move on him right away though. –And you're willing to swear to this in an affidavit? –Sure. Whatever it takes. Detective Vendrell, let's take his statement. Call for a warrant. –Impressive. –Thanks. Getting him to roll on a heavy hitter... for a misdemeanor marijuana charge. I can't take all the credit. I don't think he fully grasps the distinction between felony and misdemeanor. When that paperwork comes in... I'd like to go on that bust with you. See you in action. Sure thing. Your pager just went off. I know we don't have much time. –Sorry. I'm bound by tradition. –This tradition... does it always include multiple rape? –No, that was wrong of them. What if the kidnappers decide the family owes them money? They could go after her again. They probably will. I see how you're being honorable. You tell me how they're being honorable. Look, if you helped us though, if you led us to them, it would be a message to them... that the brokers are not the only ones who have to follow by the rules, so do the kidnappers. Your community would understand that. They could appreciate the honor in it. Informant? Yo, who the hell told you I got drugs? That's confidential for security reasons. –I'm sure you understand. –Yo, don't play me, dog. –I've got a right to face my accuser. –You can mention that at trial. Hey, yo, man. Take it easy over there. Hey, you heard the man. Respect the property. Got something. Whoa. How many years of experience in this room... and the goddamn rookie finds the brick on his first day. –Let me see that, man. –Nice. Yeah, damn straight. The kid's a natural. –I taught him everything he knows. –I'll bet you did. Yo, that ain't mine, man. This is a stone-cold setup. –You put it there. –Found it under your sink, sir. –Well, this is a goddamn setup, man. –Vic, Vic. –Check this shit out. –That's a TAC-9. It's the same kind of gun used in the drive-by. We plant this too? Yo, look. I didn't shoot nobody. Is that what ballistics is gonna tell us about that dead hooker? I didn't think so. –I have 10 minutes to get there. –We better hurry. Just get in the cage. –Good work, Vic. You know, you really pulled it together. –Thanks. The chief's happy. He wants another press conference to trumpet the quick results. –I'll do most of the talking, but he wants you there too. –Sure. Detective. We got a call from our kidnappers. We set up a drop. You mind getting our backs? The captain said we could help each other out. Hey, my day's just getting started. Shut up! Get down. Stop! Get back here! Stop, goddamn it! –Down. Hands behind your back. –Where do you think you're going? You got him cuffed? I said stop! Goddamn it! All right, we're secure here. –You all right? –I got him. Keep looking. –That's them. –Which ones? Those ones. Hey, what happened? Latigo had a change of heart. –You didn't tell me that. –It happened quickly. I've been sitting right here. –Those our kidnappers? –Well, uh... our broker cooperated, led us to them. Well done. Thanks. –You didn't have to do that. –Credit's overrated. Tangible results. Nice goddamn job. Both of you, really. I told you he'd deliver. –I just didn't think twice on the first day. –What did you expect? The whole team worked well together. Some things could have been smoother, but we'll get there. I'm sure his public defender will have some questions. –It's just a few scratches. –From being dragged through barbed wire. I told him to stop. –Bet you next time he listens. –Come on, fellas. The job's hard enough without tension between the walls. We should be celebrating. Yeah. Nathan, you gotta be kidding me. What am I supposed to do now? –Use the ladies room. –Jesus Christ. Relax. The plumber promised me he'd get to it tomorrow. Try not to destroy that one too. The obvious thing would have been to go Gannon's way. Instead, you got Latigo to do exactly what he didn't wanna do and feel good doing it. Some cases you get an instinct. –I don't get it. How come I haven't heard of you? –It's a mystery. I was thinking... maybe we could serve as partners again. –You know, on a permanent basis. –Wherever I'm needed. So, if I spoke to Aceveda, asked him to put us together, you wouldn't mind? No, I wouldn't mind. Okay, who took my chair? Hey, Lem and Ronnie are psyched. We're gonna go get a beer. Start without me. I gotta take care of something first. Look, I, uh, I talked to both of them, and they're cool about what went down. –Good. –We got Lionel. –Got us a little breathing room. –Yeah. –It was easy, wasn't it? –Yeah. It was a little too easy. My church conducts monthly food drives in Farmington to help feed families. I don't need the gospel. I need work. My pastor knows a lot of people. I'll ask him if someone's hiring. Next time, find some help before you do something stupid. Yeah. –What are you doing? –I'm just letting him know where his family could get some help. If you're gonna get emotionally involved with every collar... get off the streets and into social work. You don't have to tell me about the streets. I grew up on them. Living in them and working in them are two different things. Look, I know I got a lot to learn about police work. And you've got your way that works for you. But I got a way I wanna try for me. Hey. Oh, Jesus. –I didn't know we're coed. –Welcome to the experiment. –I'll be out in a sec. –All right. Cool. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. It was a good day today. Hey, man. So how was it out there? Fine. Yeah. There's nothing like your first time. –I didn't think Gilroy was ever gonna sign off on me. –Don't take it personally. –He was just busy. –Well, I'm glad to be here. You'll like it. Oh, the John's still broke. I'm working on it. –You ready? –Yeah, I'm ready for anything. Good, 'cause we get everything down here. Starting to get a rep out on the street. Bad guys don't like seeing us. It's starting to get fun. Hey, hey. –This here is Terry. He comes to us from Robbery. –Robbery? –We love you, pretty boys from Robbery. –How you doing? ⬄25000÷1000⬄ Philadelphia 1976 You can barely tell. I'm flying. Good as new. Look. Todd's sick of me. So maybe you're sick of him. Let's go back to Tim's room. He's cooler than any of them. You really want to? Maybe later. You're not supposed to have people here. Who says? Your mom and dad. You're gonna call them in Jakarta? Give the lady a beer for her silence. Is Jill coming? What do you think? I saw her today. She said maybe, maybe not. Please. She's coming. Who's gonna clean this up in the morning? Go watch TV, Bonita. There she is. Oh, hi, gorgeous.

Á¦·11Ì ·¡Ä¡Æ÷�å( �Ð o£¶óæ�) ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2003/09/28 You writing? Yeah. How you doing, Detectives? Trash still here, chairs on the floor. They hadn't closed yet. Eight years on the line, never had a triple. Last out gets the action. This an overnighter? Kid who opens up found this morning. Looks like a straight robbery? Go talk to the scene man, kid. Register's raided. Let's get it dusted. It's a bad case of death. All three shot. Her throat's cut. Doer's got a gun. Why's he gotta slit her throat, too? Um, Detective? When you dust the register... We might find your prints? That's why we keep our hands full. All right, I'm knocking on some doors. We boring you in here? Stillman called. There's a civilian down at Central, wants to talk to you. Me? Asked for a lady in Homicide. I hear you were in the Badlands. Della's Chicken and Ribs. What's the deal with this civilian? Civilian? Probably some nut job. Vera said that he, uh... I told Vera to deal with her. I've been on since midnight. I got three murders to solve, and he's pawning his dog calls off on me? I know, Lil. He is one pain in the ass, boss. Yeah, look, she's right outside. Just chase her demons away. Your triple's not gonna go anywhere, all right? You better give Vera some hell. Like it would do any good. Detective Rush. Homicide. You do murders? I investigate murders. I want to tell you about one. What's your name? Bonita... Bonita Rafaela. You been smoking some pot today, Bonita? It helps with the pain. I've got cancer. Sorry. I saw a murder. A girl was killed on a tennis court. Where's the court? Chestnut Hill. At the house where I used to work. The boys were having a party. He hit her... over and over and over and over. You didn't call the police? I went to bed. I thought it wasn't my business. A girl dying wasn't your business? And when did this happen? In 1976. 1976, Bonita? 27 years ago, and you're just telling this now? I had a son. I needed to work. But now I have this cancer. Something die in here? Whew... These cases. The timing adds up. Jill Shelby, beaten at a neighbor's house, found the next morning. Case was never solved. Yeah, like the rest of these job. But now we got a witness. Are you saying we should open a 27-year-old case, Lil? There's new direction. Yeah, witnesses from that long ago are gonna be pretty shaky. Maybe. But then, time can be on our side. People who wouldn't talk then might be willing to now. Look at this maid. Mm-hmm. I mean, time passes. People's loyalties and circumstances change. Do you believe this maid? Yeah, I do. I don't know the assigned detective. Britt. I bet Jeffries does. Britt was top shelf. Got killed in Camden trying to pick up a fugitive. So he's not the reason the job went cold. Uh-uh. And I remember this one. It made him crazy. The girl's mother would come in year after year, Britt never had anything for her. who'd he look at for the doer? The two brothers, one being the boyfriend. A live-in cook made the list. And, of course, some folks thought a gang of black kids must have come to Chestnut Hill that night. The boyfriend his top pick? Yeah, it was rumored he had been violent with her. Todd Whitley? Oh, yeah. Cocky little jerk, as I recall. From a society family. No one would talk about those boys. The old man was too powerful. Put up walls Britt couldn't even get past. Someone should read the job again. Maybe those walls are shakier now. How about you? I got a job. But Vera might get a sense of achivement out of it. You spoke to the maid, Lil. Only 'cause he stuck me with her. This job deserves another look and Vera doesn't have the type of personality to get anywhere with society people. You give Vera my triple, you're gonna find him in Della's freezer. Excuse me, is Evelyn Shelby here? I'm Evelyn. Hi. Lilly Rush. How'd you find this house? Well, I'm a Detective Homicide. Is it about someone who stayed here? No, um... it's about your daughter. A witness has come forward in her case. Someone who worked in the neighborhood. So you don't know anything. We have new direction. Look, I came into Homicide every August, for over 20 years. Eventually, I figured out that Detective Britt was too much of a gentleman to tell me to stop coming, that her case would never be solved. You can only hope so long. So I should just forget about Jill? How about Todd Whitley? Should I forget him, too? Todd was lovely to Jill. Really, I... hear he knocked her around. What's lovely about that? I still see Todd Whitley... and Melanie. They're married now. Melanie... Jill's best friend? They became close after she died. And I'm not interested in stirring up more accusations against him. Well, I'm reopening the case. I'm not saying don't do your job. It's just that no one's been able to solve it after all these years. And... and I-I just can't get pulled in again. What kind of person doesn't wanna solve her daughter's murder? Someone in a lot of pain? Well, she won't help me with Todd, she thinks he's a golden boy. And the best friend's married to him. That's a tight inner circle. So Jill's own mom isn't on board, who's this for? You working a dead case instead of our triple? Talk to him. Unsolved isn't dead, Las. And she's got direction. Don't you? Yeah, but I also got three murders at this restaurant. All right. Who else can you go to on this? Well, not Melanie. So I guess that leaves the brothers. What was their party line on the abuse? The party line was don't talk to the cops. Going out on the street, boss. Right. Neighborhood survey on Della's. You coming or not? Let me just work this one for one more interview, then I'm back. Great. All right, what's your play with the brothers? Well, Todd's a superstar lawyer now. Eric is more of a fringe case. Divorced, drinking problem, doesn't exactly work. Sounds like he's your first stop. Eric? Yeah? Detective Rush. I'm heading out. I have a meeting. There's a 1:00 in Old City. It's not that kind of meeting. Oh. Um.. I'm.. It'll just take a few minutes. It's about Jill Shelby. You were in school with her, right? Chelsea Day? I can't talk to you. How come? They treated my brother and me like suspects back then. Well, it was an open secret Todd was hitting Jill. He loved Jill. People hit people they love. I shouldn't say anymore. Maybe you could just tell me what she was like. She was nice. When you were alone with her, at least. When you weren't alone? I don't wanna speak ill of the dead. It's okay. I hear it every day. She'd ignore you. She ignore you that night? She was at her worst at parties. I see dollar signs, already, Charlie. That was a $50 value. Thank you! Come on, Jill. Tell us what a kiss from Eric's worth. I can't. He's Todd's brother. You've already kissed two other guys. I'm not into it. Come here, Eric. So she was kind of a bitch to you that night. She didn't mean it. That was the just way she got sometimes. Mmm. Anyway, I need to go. Oh, did you letter in high school? You look kind of athletic. One year. Wrestling. Todd Whitley. Lilly Rush. Have a seat, Lilly. Who'd you row for? Uh, Chelsea Day and Penn. I'm still on the water most mornings. Impressive. This is about Eric I assume. You don't seem too shocked he might be in trouble. Patterns of behavior, right? Recognize her? What is this? A homicide investigation. Look, that was painful for a lot of people. I suggest you leave it alone. I can't do that. It's an open case. Why did someone like you become a cop? Oh, bad education, limited talent. You should be married, living the good life. Well, no one ever asked. So here I am working a homicide. Well, as I told the cops at the time, I was with my brother all night. Actually, a lawyer told them that in a statement three weeks later. So? Look... my father owned half of Philadelphia. People like to see families like ours in trouble. We hired a lawyer. Maybe your kind of people don't do that... mine do. Even if there's nothing to hide? I can't help you anymore. I understand you're married to Melanie now. She can't help you either. Do you still have a problem with violence? I know you once hit Jill hard enough to give her three stitches and all. Everyone knew the cops had it in for me over Jill. They were wrong then, you are wrong now. Ever hit Melanie? All right, Lilly, you're right. Someone did beat the crap out of Jill on a regular basis. But It wasn't me. Her father was a real son of a bitch. You sure know how to find people. I thought you'd still be living in Chestnut Hill. I like the city. Did you find something? Autopsy records and medical records. And? I just don't understand these injuries Jill had before she died. Injuries? Broken rib when she was 12.... a concussion ... a jaw fracture at nine years old. What's the deal? She played field hockey and soccer. Uh-huh. She was very active. Evelyn, my ex-husband was a mean drunk. I know the difference between a soccer injury and a trip down the stairs. Did your husband beat your daughter? He was in Houston the night she died. That wasn't my question. He's been dead nine years. And now you work at a Shelter for battered women and children. Where did you get that? The case file. I took this picture. I don't see how you can just forget her, Evelyn. Forget? I think about her every day. This ruined my life. Then it still matters. I can't look back. It's too hard. So you sell your Chestnut Hill house, pack up your old life and-and think you can just walk away? You can't walk away from her, Eveylyn. She's a part of you. There's now hope now. And what if you don't solve it? Where does that leave me? What if I do solve it? My husband doesn't want me talking to you. Todd doesn't want you helping with your best friend's murder investigation? I thought we put this to rest. It's important to me, Melly. So you came to the party with Jill but left alone? I drank too much. I had to go home and I couldn't find her. You made a big point in your interview that you were sure it wasn't Todd. The detective made a big point of asking about him. He was fixated on the Whitleys, but barely looked at Tim Dorn. This is the cook? He lived in our guest house, and he was with the girls that night. When we left for the party, he told Jill she should come by later if she wanted. When I heard she was missing the next day, Tim was the first person I thought of. All this information and I got one page on the guy the mother and best friend think did it. You gotta listen to the best friend. Teenage girls tell each other everything. Well, Britt wrote two sentences on him, then blew him off. It's hard to tell if he even worked him hard enough. Especially when he had it out for Todd. Dorn's up in Frackville. Locked up? Why do you think he's gonna talk to you? I'm an optimist. Lil, I got a wife at home. You don't have to come. You think it's a dead case. Let me just call her. Five years for forgery. I got a facility for it, gets me into trouble. You ever dabble in more serious crime? Like the violence done to Jill Shelby? No, Ma'am. I'm strictly a cerebral criminal. Pretty attractive, wasn't she? She was pretty cute, for a girl. You did tell her to come over that night. She came over a lot to get high. She and her little vixen friend Melanie. Well, that little vixen thinks that you killed Jill. Well, if you marry the prime suspect I guess you better point to someone else. Jill's mom also thinks you did it. A woman lives in a certain world. If the shining neighbor boy killed her daughter, that world's a lie. Britt has your alibi down here as going to bed at 10:00. I guess he must have kept his word. Actually, I was with a... friend that night. What friend? Bobby Jordan. This big, luscious college boy down the street. Neither of us was exactly out and proud at the time, so we asked Britt not to document the sleepover. Bobby's gonna confirm that? Well, I imagine he's come to terms by now. Did Jill ever talk to you about Todd? Oh, sure. Those girls told me everything. Like what? Teenage drama. They even told me things they didn't tell each other. Like all the while Jill was fretting that Todd doesn't treat her right, Melanie was doing him on the side. You can't be here. Gate was open. My partner, Chris Lassing. How you doing? Todd is furious at you. Uh-oh. Thanks to you his brother came here last night, drunk, after six years of being sober. Eric did? Look, I've told you about Tim Dorn. Why do you have to keep bothering us? Dorn's alibi checked out. We know about you and Todd stepping out on Jill back then. I... I don't have to talk to you. We have to arrest you? You don't want that, Lady. You should see our holding cell. Your headband will get all dirty. Why does this matter? 'Cause when you tell us one lie, Melanie, even if it's small, that makes us think you're hiding other things. Like whatever Todd did to Jill that night. It wasn't Todd, okay? I know... because I was with him that night. That is some top. It's new. You look like, uh... What? A patriotic street walker. It was in Seventeen. Why do you have to be a jerk? Why don't you go and comfort her? You know, you could use some time in charm school. Could I? I could give you a tutorial... upstairs. What about Jill? What about her? I'm obviously not proud of it. It sounds like Eric had pretty strong feelings for Jill. So? So, why'd he fall off the wagon just 'cause Jill's name came up? Two million people in this city, I gotta run into you? You think I'm thrilled seeing you? All right, look, I'm sorry if I was obnoxious in your office. More than obnoxious. It's just the way that you were looking out for Eric. It was... I hear he's drinking again. Don't talk about Eric. Todd, I know that you were with Melanie that night. Excuse me? Which doesn't add up with you saying you were with Eric. So I figure that you just said that to protect him. Okay, let's say I was with Melanie that night. You can understand why I wouldn't want the entire world knowing that, right? Right. So why not just say that you were sleeping? Why give Eric an alibi? You should drop this. Eric did it. That's why you can sleep at night and have a normal life, and he's a mess. You should just watch it. When did the hard drinking start? After he killed her? I can make your life very difficult. Eric kills Jill... you clean up after him. Brother's keeper ever since. Am I close? Tell me something, Lilly. What is the point of all of this after so many years? People shouldn't be forgotten. Even if they are my kind of people. Maybe they don't have a lot of money, they don't have lawyers... but they matter. They should get justice, too. I see. You're a crusader. I guess I am. Good luck. So, is sleep like an optional thing for you? I'm not tired. Guess who weighed in on your case today? Mmm... the commissioner. The commissioner? Apparently he and the Whitley's father were college pals. Todd called Bradley to tattle on me? What a baby. And now Bradley's wondering when you're going back on the line. He couldn't pick me out of a line up. Suddenly he's tracking my career? Screw him. Don't say that too loud in this building. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rush... your boyfriend's downstairs. I'm single. You sure it's not your boyfriend? One of the Whitleys... booked for DUI. You crash that nice car of yours, Eric? Thanks to you. I had something to do with it? All I did was bring up Jill. Why's that send you on a bender? My brother called our lawyer, who called the commissioner, who's a very close family friend. I heard all about it. Then why don't you take a hint and back off? 'Cause something tells me you and I are one scotch away from a good conversation. Hey, Lil. Hey. Hey. Las is in with Evelyn Shelby. Huh. I kept my own box on Jill. It's been packed away for years, but I thought maybe it could help. Good. Melanie told me about her and Todd in high school, behind Jill's back. Well, she was only 15. Mrs. Shelby, it looks like we're closing in on Eric Whitley. The younger one? Yeah, well, he doesn't have an alibi for that night. And, uh, he was pretty sick in love with your daughter. I was looking at her yearbook, and I remembered this boy. Ann Winters' son. A few years after Jill died he said something to Ann about the Whitleys getting away with murder. Why isn't this in the file? Well, it should be. John told it to the police. What's the kid name? Charlie Winters. If Britt talked to him I'd have a record of it. He was meticulous. Well, are you sure your husband mentioned it to Britt? He told me he did. Could he have lied, Evelyn? Well, I don't know. I mean, I hounded him about it. He said it came to nothing. That I should stop brining it up. Stop pointing fingers at the Whitleys. They were a powerful family. I guess we both know what it's like to have a husband fail you. We'll find Charile Winters, Evelyn. We'll talk to him, and we'll let you know what he says. Thanks for coming out. I can't really leave the retreat. Sure. It's about Jill Shelby. So, now you wanna hear? Yeah, you told the cops you didn't see anything. Yeah, at first. But then I came to the Shelbys with some good information, and I got the brush-off. You come stoned in your VW van? So? Charlie, Evelyn Shelby's the one who told us about you. Screw Evelyn Shelby, okay? I tried to help her years ago. She wouldn't hear it. You're right, Charlie, but she's not afraid now, and we wanna hear. Okay. I was, um... Kind of passed out on a lounge chair. How could this happen? Just shut up. Why'd you have to wear this? What? It's ruined. That's what you were thinking about? That stupid jacket? Just leave things to me. So, they... got in their car and left, and, man, I just got the hell out of there. Why'd Eric care so much about the jacket? There was this... one year that Eric did wrestling, and... Todd couldn't wrestle to save his life. I think it was the only thing that... he could do better than Todd. Hi. How was it? Good. I need a couple of minutes. I... I have to tell you something that's gonna be hard to hear. Todd was seen with the murder weapon that night. But I was with him. You were asleep after drinking all night. He could've got out of bed later. This is the father of my children. He was involved with a murder, Melanie, that's someone that you don't know very well. Well, maybe he was just covering up for Eric. Even if that's all he did, that's accessory to murder. I wanna tell you something... but if I do, I can't go home. I can help you with that. They're talking every night. They're arguing. Todd keeps telling Eric to stay away from Tabby's. What's that? They have an aunt, Tabitha. She has a house in Chestnut Hill. It was... it was close to where we all used to live. Pack a bag for you and the kids. You're coming with me. Hey. Where's my wife? Safe. Hey, bitch, you tell me where she is. Is this how you handle women you can't control? This supposed to scare me? It's supposed to make you think. I'm not like the girls you're used to, Todd. You can't try to charm me, then when that doesn't work, talk down to me, then when that doesn't work, get aggressive. I'm not Jill or Melanie. I'm the police, and we're at the police headquarters, you moron. You gonna talk to me like that? What are you gonna do? Kill me in the parking lot of Central? You think you'll get away with it again? I know about Tabby's. I'll have a warrant tomorrow, and guys are sitting on it right now. Whatever you hid there, we're about to find it. So it's over. Okay. I can't protect him anymore. I did as much as I could. Why don't you come in, give me a statement? Okay. Flipped on his brother. Do you believe him? I don't know. I gotta find Eric. No meeting tonight, huh? Screw the meetings. Scotch and soda. Look, I can't talk to you. My brother chewed me out the day you came by. Really? 'Cause he's been talking to me a lot. Yeah, well, I guess he puts himself in a different category. He told me about you and Jill, and... that you were in love with her. She was his girlfriend. Oh, she'd hang around with you when, uh... no one was around, but drop you the second Todd showed up. Look, I already told you that she was like that. And that he found you two together that night. Look, I said I couldn't talk to you. What happened to your letter jacket, Eric? I don't know. Another. I don't think there's time for another. I have to arrest you. He told me you did it, and that you came to him for help afterwards, and you two buried the racket at your aunt's house. Why would I kill her? Because she humiliated you. She accused you of watching them. Oh, my God. So what, he's pinning it on me now? It's his story against yours. And you're the problem drunk who never got his life together, so if you have anything to give me, you should do it now. Look, he ruined my jacket. He got his blood all over it. Hers, too. You didn't throw it out, did you? And Jill didn't humiliate me. He did. Hi, gorgeous. Where were you? Well, you can't really ask me that. That's my jacket. So you finally got a taste of her, huh? Now you have something real to jerk off to. Todd. Huh, have you seen him in the window watching us have sex? That's crazy. Up in the tree with his hand down his pants. Stop. Please. Well, you're the one who just screwed him. I didn't screw him. Give me some credit. I saw you all pressed up to him. Only 'cause you were off with Melanie. Just stop talking. Asshole. Bitch. Don't. Shut up! You're so pathetic. And you're such a prick. You shut your mouth. Screw you. Hey, slut... I said shut your mouth. # Creedence Clearwater Revival ÀÇ "Have You Ever Seen The Rain" # # Someone told me long ago # # There's a calm before the storm # # I know # # It's been coming for some time # # When it's over, so they say # # It'll rain a sunny day # # I know # # Shining down like water # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day # # Yesterday and days before # # Sun is cold and rain is hard # # I know # # Been that way for all my time # # Till forever # # On it goes # # Through the circle, fast and slow # # I know # # It can't stop, I wonder # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day # # Yeah # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day # Narrator: Previously on Justice League...

Poseidon knew that the same mystic energy He used to defeat the Old Ones Also powered the spells that prevented Atlantis From sinking beneath the ocean. He saved the world, But doomed Atlantis to rest forever At the bottom of the sea. Now the Old Ones seek to return to our world. Already, fissures have appeared, Allowing creatures from their world To gain entrance into ours. When you interrupted, We were helping Fate cast a spell to bar their way.

You're not supposed to understand it. You just have it. [English - US - SDH] Are you alive? Yes. Prove it. It has begun. - Make a hole! As I was saying, form follows function. Nowhere is this axiom of design more readily apparent... than on board the world-famous Battlestar Galactica. This ship, the last of her kind still in service... was constructed over 50 years ago during the early days of the Cylon War. Originally there were 1 2 Battlestars, each representing one of Kobol's 1 2 colonies. Galactica represented Caprica and was first commanded by Commander Nash-- "The Cylon war is long over, yet we must not forget the reasons why--" - Commander Adama, if I may? - Captain. I just wanted Baker. Oh, no. You can set your mind to it and pack your kit. You asked me to marry you and you meant it. And I said I would and I meant it. So you can get your great brute of a self ready because I'm coming by the first passage I can find. Your loving Dover. Dover, right? Is she sick? - She's coming. - Coming here? - To take me back to Pennsylvania. - Oh, my God. She's coming to take me back whether I'm ready to go or not. Well, you did ask my sister to marry you. And we've been out here almost four years. And two years was your agreement with her. You told her you could make your fortune in that time and go home as rich as Croesus. I thought you were on my side. You came out here to do something big. Am I right or am I wrong? - You're right. - Well, your time's more than run out. And you haven't done it yet because you keep putting it off and putting it off, because you know that when you do it, it'll be the end of this life for you. You might as well face it, lad, it's gonna be the end anyway once my sister gets here, and that's a fact. Emilio Estevez was the biggest bandit of them all, senor. This whole town is his? He was the enemy of Benito Juárez. Also, he was the enemy of Maximilian. Also, he did not care for his mother. When he took this town, he kept it. Everything he steals, he brings to this place. It's the Sodom and Gomorrah of Mexico. Yeah. They'll remember me for this. It's like the sack of Rome. But we are only a dozen guns. But with the big gun, we can do it. Okay, the big gun. Ha, ha, ha. Hey, look. You suppose? Aye. Those three were doing what we're thinking about. It's not gonna be easy, Baker. There are over a hundred guns down there. Well, the hell with their guns, Tommy. This is it. Something big. Big. Laddie! Hiyah! Yes? Sir, I think you best come to the saloon, sir. Saloon, why? Well, I think you best come and see, sir. Very well. I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill And o'er the moor and valley Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill Since parting with my Sally I seek no more the fine and gay For each does but remind me How swift the hours did pass away With the girl I left behind me Oh, ne'er shall I forget the night The stars were bright above me And gently lent their silvery light When first she vowed she loved me But now I'm bound to Brighton camp Kind heaven, favor find me And send me safely back again To the girl I left behind me Sir, the men wanted me to tell you what a pleasure it's been to serve under you. And, well, we know it's gonna be two weeks before you're leaving, but some of the men here are gonna be out on patrol when it comes your time to leave us, and, well, we'd like to take this opportunity... Sir, it's my privilege and honor to be the one chosen to present you with this token of our esteem. I speak for all the horse soldiers in your command when I say that it's been an honor to serve with you. Under. Under. - Under you, sir. Ahem. Yes. Thank you, corporal. Thank you. Men, I find myself rather at a loss for words. It's most difficult for me to express my feelings about this occasion and all of you and the cavalry. I believe only a soldier could understand that, possibly only a horse soldier. I've been a cavalryman for 30 years. And it's been my privilege and my honor to be acquainted with a great many very brave men. So I'm most grateful tonight for this opportunity to tell you that of all those with whom I served, you men are the finest. And I thank you. Sir. Sir, you believe in fair play, don't you? And doing what's right? Why, of course, sergeant. Well, it was me that was supposed to give you that Indian headdress and not Corporal James here. And, well, I'd like your permission to express my feelings on this matter, sir. Oh, I see. Well, certainly. Corporal James, that was a bad thing you done to me. But, sergeant... I'm gonna take you one by one what put him up to it too. Try me, sarge! - Excuse me, sir. - Carry on, sergeant. - Oh, your hat, sir. - Thank you, corporal. That was very unwise, you know. Sergeant Fitzsimmons is sensitive. - Sensitive, sir? - Very sensitive. Colonel? Evening. - Good evening, sir. - Will you sit a spell? - Don't mind if I do. Thank you. - Have a cigar. - I will. Thank you. Well, captain, I'm going to miss this outfit very much. And any day now, my wife will be arriving through the gate, and away I go. Mrs. Morgan is coming here to the fort? Yeah. With bells on, captain. Bells on. I guess she wants to be sure I retire this time. I started to twice before, but when I came right down to it, why, I couldn't. Listen to that. MEN I seek no more the fine and gay for each does but remind me History we're making, captain. We're making history. Someday, it'll be a tired, old, ghost town, that's all, blowing in the wind. Ahem. Well, good night, captain. - Good night, sir. - Thank you for the cigar. You're welcome, colonel. Kind heaven, favor find me And send me safely back again To the girl I left behind me How are you? - What the...? - That Mr. John Anderson. Well, yeah, but, uh... It was his last wish on his deathbed. Mr. Anderson said if his friends cannot be with him, he always want to be with his friends. Heh, heh. That was a very fine gesture. - What you like to drink? - Oh, whiskey, I reckon. You wouldn't be knowing a man named Baker, I don't suppose? He rides with a dog. Si, everybody knows Senor Baker. He been around lately? Oh, seven, eight days ago. Why do you ask? Is Senor Baker a compadre to you? No, not exactly. I heard he was planning something big. Oh, yes. He's planning something big. Mucho, mucho, mucho, very big. Yeah. What? I don't know. Aah! Are you a bandit? No, ma'am. Just an old cowboy trying to get along. Hell, honey, I don't care what you call yourself, but if you're after our valuables, I'll tell you now, mine, you can't put in a saddle bag. You wanna bet? Tommy? Well? - Why not? - You'll bring shame on yourself giving Johnny Cobb a woman like her. - Well, how do you figure? - Look at it, lad. You want people to think she's the best you can do? He just said he wanted a woman. He didn't say he wanted one with a bloodline. Can you no understand, lad? Taking her to Cobb would be to go against the scripture. Scripture? What's the Bible got to do with it? Christian thing to do is to get the kind of a woman for Cobb that you'd want Cobb to get for you. You're right. Luis? Two men. More than likely that's Johnny Cobb and the flea that rides with him. More than likely. And you don't have the woman for him for trade. It could mean trouble. Well, let's let him hear what trouble really sounds like. Aye. What air do you fancy then? "Campbells Are Coming." Hey, welcome home. Come on, Tuffy. You were gone a lot longer this time than I thought you'd be. Oh, we were down in Mexico looking over the town of Estevez. They rode in this morning. Baker, where's the woman? Johnny's talking to you, Baker. You start something with me, Moon, and they'll be collecting you in a gunny sack. Where is the woman? When I have her, I'll let you know, all right? When? What do you think I am, Cobb, a magician? You think it's easy to produce a woman out of nowhere? Don't you think if I could find a woman, I'd have one or two for myself? Yeah. Well, what about the time they stole your cook's wooden leg out of that cat house in Bad Water and used it for firewood, you found him another? Where'd you find a wooden leg way out here? - Well, it wasn't easy. - And that horse of yours. You got the only horse in the world with gold teeth. What's your point? His point is, if you can find them things in this country, you can find him a woman. Yeah. And now you just listen to me and you better listen good. If it wasn't for the $5,000 price on my head outside this territory, I wouldn't even be talking to you. We got a deal. You and me. A deal. A woman for a Gatling gun. Now, I can get my hands on that Gatling gun this week. Where's the woman? What you need is a drink, Johnny. What I need is a woman! You could make a man deaf yelling in his ear like that. Sit down, Johnny. Have a drink. Sit down. When I lie down at nights, I'm thinking about a woman. And when I get up in the morning, I'm thinking about a woman. It's been years. Baker, it's been years. I can't remember. I can't even remember what's it like. Johnny, I'll tell you what it's like. First of all... I don't want you to tell me, I wanna do it! Now, we got a deal. Gatling gun for a woman. Now, where is she? It's a sorry kind of a man who resorts to violence, Cobb. Just take a drink. He's been waiting for you. Attention! Couldn't you do that outside, Bookbinder? Sergeant Fitzsimmons has just finished cleaning the o... No, not now. What'd you find out? Well, I rode out to Bad Water and talked to a Mexican there that runs the cantina. Yes? Then I rode on down to the stage stop and talked to a mountain man there named Nate Hattersby. Go on. Then I rode back a hundred miles to Lost Boy Pass and talked to a couple of Navajos there riding south. Bookbinder, could you just get to it? What is Baker planning? Baker. Something big. Bookbinder, I've been in the Army most of my life, 30 in the cavalry, to be exact, and I have never ever had a scout as utterly worthless as you are. Get out. Colonel, if a man can't find something out, he just can't find it out. Now, that's all there is to it. No, that is not all there is to it, Bookbinder. You are paid to know. Do you understand? Do...? No, you don't. Get out. Get out. Yah! Yah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! We'll water the horses here. Whoa! Baker. All I hear is Baker. He's held up four stagecoaches in one week, gentlemen. Here, here, here and here. He hasn't harmed anyone and he hasn't taken anything from them. Now, what does that leave? Obviously, he's looking for something or someone or whatever. Well, before he finds them or it or whatever it is he's looking for, I want to know who or what it is, you understand? Now, one thing for sure, as I'm standing here, we know he's out there right now somewhere, holding up another stagecoach. Question, gentlemen: Why is he doing it? Why? Whoa! Apache Flats. You folks better come in. This will be your last drink of water before Dry Wells. What's going on here? Who are you? What do you want? I'm going to see you shot. And who's gonna do the shooting? It may interest you to know that my name is Mary Anna Morgan. My husband is the commanding officer of the fort at Dry Wells. Is that the best you can think of to scare me? You cannot be the colonel's lady, lassie. And why not? Every man in the territory knows the colonel is married to a cold lady who lives back East. Aye. A cold, frigid, barren woman with no heart or soul. - You know the colonel? - We've met along the way. And I suppose he told you all this about his wife? He didn't have to. What other kind of a woman would make a man live alone to do his duty? How's your health? Does your belly ever hurt you? - I beg your pardon. - Or your head? Or anything? I'll tell you one thing. You sure do look like everything is in order. - Can I see you a minute, Tommy? - Aye. Whoa! What do you mean the colonel's wife ain't here? There was nothing you could do, huh? - Not a thing, Jesse. They took us by... Pardon me. What's going on here? Where's my wife? You, stop. Where's Mrs. Morgan? Sir, I've got your wife's luggage and that's all. Colonel, I just don't know how to tell you. Well, find a way, man, find a way, quickly. Well, sir, your wife was tooken at Apache Flats. There was about a dozen of them, mostly Mexican. But the leader, he was no Mex. - Did he have dark hair? - And a dog. - Brown eyes? - Yep, and a dog. - Tall and lean? - That's right. And he had a dog. Yes, and a dog. Baker. Baker. Something big. Bring this man to my office, sergeant. Yes, sir. I'll make a deal with you. You can hate me, but you can still drink my water. On that basis, I'll do it. I don't have a disease. Neither do I, and it's gonna remain that way. Will you answer one question for me? I got no secrets. Why am I here? What do you intend to do with me? - Do you want it straight out? - Yes. I'm trading you to a man for a Gatling gun. I know it ain't right, but no one's ever accused me of being good. I got a qualm. I don't want you to think that I'm bragging, but I've known a lot of women in my time. But I don't remember seeing one as beautiful as you. And it's sure gonna hurt me to turn you over to him. Don't you have any idea which way they went? Nope, I sure ain't, colonel. I ain't even got a notion which way they come. - They was just there. - Just there. Are you absolutely certain you didn't hear him say anything? I didn't say I didn't hear him say anything. I said I didn't hear him say anything about where he was going. Then you did hear him say something? - Sure did. - Well? Would you mind telling me what he said, if it's not too much strain? - He said... - What? What'd he say? ! He asked Mrs. Morgan how her belly was. What? Then he give her a probe or two. Seemed real pleased. Who seemed real pleased? - Baker. - Tyler! We're taking your troop. Issue three days' rations. We'll pick up their trail at Apache Flats. - Bookbinder! Bookbinder! Yes, sir. They rode out of here heading east, colonel. Figure they're headed for the Guadalupes. We'll stay here the night, push out in the morning. Yes, sir. - See the horses to the corral, captain. - Yes, sir. At a walk. Forward. Ho! Colonel? I reckon I've heard about everything there is to hear about Baker. Oh, I know you're worried about your lady, but I ain't never yet heard tell of Baker hurting a woman. Bookbinder, there are things a man can do to a woman without hurting her. Vile, rude, disgraceful, undignified things. Unspeakable things, Bookbinder. Yeah. Luis. Senor Baker, four wagon loads of whiskey going to Lordsburg. Good. You stay there, mister, and I'll get you a drink. This is all well and good, but it's not the big thing, is it? The Indians are gonna like this whiskey. Aye, they're men, are they not? What kind of answer is that then? We're gonna need them for our big thing. Okay. Heh, heh. They love me. Baker. Jesus saves. Amen. Whiskey, good. You bring sunshine. So good. Welcome. I figured you'd like it. You good man, Baker. You lovely man. Well, chief, thank you. But, well, there's just one little thing. Lovely. Lovely. Lovely. Hey, Pickens, I brung you a guest for supper. Yeah, I saw. And I'm glad to see you finally found... Oh, I can't... I can't believe this. What's so funny about my taste in women? Is she the one? Ha, ha, ha. Well, what's wrong with her? Is she the one you got for Johnny Cobb? - Yeah, what's wrong with her? - Ha, ha, ha. Joe, don't you know who she is? - Well, she told us some story about... - Ha, ha, ha. You mean? You don't mean? I don't suppose you'd like to talk about it. Just before they stand you in front of my husband's firing squad, I'd be happy to discuss it with you, Mr. Baker. Now, will you please show me to my quarters? Show you to your quart...? You sleep here. Indeed. And where will you sleep? Beneath you. I prefer to sleep somewhere else, thank you. "I prefer to sleep somewhere else." You'll sleep here, I'll sleep beneath you and that's the way it's gonna be until Cobb comes to collect you. Tommy, how does a good man like me get into a mess like this? I'm sorry, Mrs. Morgan, but we don't stock lilac water. You can't seriously expect that I'm gonna bathe in that tub in this room? Well, except for the fort at Dry Wells, that's the only tub I know of for a hundred miles. That isn't exactly what I meant, Mr. Baker. I seriously doubt whether you've ever known one, but I happen to be a lady. Is that a fact? That is most certainly a fact. Does that mean that you're put together somehow different than any other woman? What I'm getting at is, if I didn't know any other females, then I wouldn't know what I was looking at, would I? Would I? But it just so happens I know other females and I know exactly what I'm looking at. So it don't make no difference, does it? Out here, we all bathe in the same water. I usually go first, but I'm giving you that honor, you being such a fine lady and all. Now, here's the way it works. Tommy scrubs my back, I scrub Tommy's back. Pickens scrubs Luis' back and Luis scrubs Pickens' back. That's the way it was until you come in and messed up the whole organization. Now, we'll just have to rearrange it all. And while you're here, Luis will scrub your back and you'll scrub... She's still in it. Where'd you meet her? I was in her husband's company during the war. We rode together at Manassas. I guess I'd still be a horse soldier if I hadn't lost my leg. - In the war? - No. See, there was this girl in Virginia and her father caught us. Cut it off. Chopped it clean off with an ax - while I was sleeping. - Really? Cross my heart. You're lucky it was only your leg. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that somewhere out there, your husband's looking for you. It's logical, isn't it? Very logical. Why'd you make him live all those years alone? I can't think of any reason in the world why I should answer a question like that from you. You don't have to talk to me at all. But what have you got to lose? That's one way of looking at it, I suppose. You don't seem as upset as I thought you'd be. If I don't, it's because I don't believe it. Things like this don't happen. Not to me. Nothing ever happened to me back in Pennsylvania either. That's why I came out here. All my life, I've wanted to do something big, really big. Now I can do it, but I need that Gatling gun. And that's where I fit in. This is my first chance to do the big thing. May be my last chance. You wouldn't understand. I understood that my husband had to be cavalry, had to be a horse soldier. I never sympathized, but I understood. I don't believe you. I don't believe you're gonna trade me for a Gatling gun. Why don't you believe me? Because I'm worth more than that. Far more. And you know it. Looks like they've been here, colonel. Colonel, dog soldiers sending word we're coming. Hm. Tyler. - Sir. - I'm going on alone, captain. - You take the men back to Dry Wells. - Well, sir, the men understand. - They're more than willing to continue. - Yes, I'm certain they are. This is a very personal matter. I can't endanger their lives. Begging the colonel's pardon, but don't you consi... No, no, this is not an Indian matter, captain. Just take the men back to the fort. Yes, sir. Thank you. I'm sending the men home, Bookbinder. If you'd like to go with them, that's all right with me, I understand. Well, things is getting a little dull back at the fort, colonel. I believe I'll just stay with you. I appreciate that. Troop, dismount. Water your horses. Baker, you just get purtier and purtier. I sure am a lucky man. Every time I come back here, I half expect to see you two gone. Every time we think of leaving, Polly finds another nugget. That's right. We ain't got nothing but a cow and a hole in the ground. You might say we live from nipple to nugget. Come on down. I got an itch that needs scratching. Come here, Tuffy. Hey, why don't you plant some flowers or something on your husband's grave? He didn't smell nice living, why should he smell nice dead? I'm speaking about respect. That's right, Baker. And we got a lot of respect for you. I sure am hungry. You got anything cooking? Whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa. Why do you suppose the Army always picks uninhabitable places to settle? I don't know, ma'am, but it's a fact. Oh, maybe I should tell you, it's customary for all ladies to check into the fort at the company office. First building over there. I'll send your baggage over. I'm looking for Baker. Everybody's looking for him, ma'am. And why do you suppose they're doing that? Well, ma'am, I could give you a thousand reasons, but, particularly, because he's got the colonel's wife. Does he? Well, I never knew Baker when he didn't have some man's wife. Aye, he follows the skirts like a dog follows the scent of a fox. How is it you know him so well, ma'am? He's going to marry with me. I am Miss Dover MacBride and I've come to get him. Hey, laddie, tell me this, what are we gonna do with her? I don't know, but she's right. She's worth a hell of a lot more than that goddamn gun. You know something? Cobb's cheating me. Aye. If only she wasn't the cavalry colonel's wife, eh? No, that's not it. It's her. It's all her. She makes me wonder. - About what? - Well, now, what do you think? You're gonna have to make a decision. Cobb's gonna be along any day with the big gun. I know. What you gonna tell him when he comes? I don't know. If she's still here, he's gonna see her. I know. Look, I got the colonel's wife, Dover's coming to get me, Cobb's coming with the big gun. It's getting hard to keep things straight in my mind. Have you considered taking her back then? You know, I'm getting a terrible pain in my head, Tommy. Would you mind just shutting up? If you take her back, you'll have nothing for Cobb. If you give her to Cobb, we'll have the whole U.S. Cavalry against us. Now, personally, I prefer Cobb. I'm just trying to be helpful, you understand? Well, you're not being helpful, Tommy. You're making me sick. Aye. Count it. Not enough. Well, now, why don't you try counting it, Malachi? I know how much it is. It's not enough. You know how much it is, then you know it's what we agreed on in Tucumcari. This ain't Tucumcari. Say what you gotta say. I'm in a hurry. Words in Tucumcari ain't money in El Paso. Cost me more than I thought for the big gun. I've come too far and risked too much to take a loss. How much more? Uh... Half again as much. You must think my mama raised a fool. Half again as much, Cobb. Take it or leave it. He ate like a pig. Hello, amigo. - Tequila or whiskey? - Whiskey. - What do you have to eat, sir? - Well, I got goat. - Billy or nanny? - Never mind. - Do you have anything else? - Horse. Oh, we'll have some of the... Some of the goat and whiskey. - Thank you. - Me too. There we are. Mr. Bookbinder here tells me you're acquainted with a man by the name of Baker. Is that right? Senor Baker is a good friend of mine. Very close. Very good. You see, Bookbinder, what'd I tell you? You have to know how to handle these people. Treat them nicely, decently, speak to them quietly, and there's no end to what you can find out. Ahem. Now, then, has he been around to see you lately, Baker? I don't remember when was the last time. Yeah. Where does he live? How many hombres ride with him? I don't know. I thought he was a good friend of yours. Very good friend. - I see. Well, thank you very much. You've been most helpful. Plum full of information, ain't he? What a sight. I missed my calling. I should have been a general. Have you made any decision regarding the colonel's lady? - You gonna start that again? - You haven't got much time, Baker. - You got me into this. - I got you into it? You're the one that said I should give Johnny Cobb the kind of a woman - I'd expect him to give to me. - Okay. I didn't promise him any kind of a woman. I never spoke to Cobb, you did, and you best not be forgetting it either. Why do you suppose a man's supposed to love only one woman? It's the Lord's ruling. You know something, Tommy? If she wasn't the colonel's lady and if it wasn't for Dover, and if she was willing, which she naturally would be, I mean, me being me and all, I'd keep her for myself. And what about the big gun? We'll take that away from Cobb. He's nothing but a thief and a robber. He'll understand. Carrie! Carrie! Two men coming. Good evening, ma'am, I'm, ahem, Colonel Morgan, - commanding officer of the... - Come on in. You don't wanna wait out here. Yes, ma'am. I mean, no, ma'am, thank you. - You can come in too, mister. - Why, thank you, ma'am. Good evening. I'm Polly Standall. - This here is my sister Carrie. - How do you do? Ladies, we're looking for a man named Baker. Would either of you happen to know him? Know him? He come through here last year like a dose of salts. He didn't even take his boots off. Yes. Do you know where we could find him? Wherever he is, it's soft and warm. Why don't you sit down, make yourselves to home. Oh, no, thank you very much. We'd be most appreciative if you'd allow us to sleep in your shed tonight. What's in the shed? I beg your pardon? There ain't nothing in the shed for you. You come right over here. - Sit down. - Oh. Oh, thank you. Ahem. Thank you very much. I just love soldiers. Why, thank you. Sailors too. But I lean more to soldiers. Well, that's very kind of you, ma'am. It's always... It's always good to be appreciated. You know, I, uh... Ahem. I always felt that if more civilians felt the way you do... I mean, if more civilians felt the way you... You don't really wanna spend the night in that old shed, do you? It's so cold and dirty out there. Well, I've become accustomed to sleeping in the dirt and the cold and the heat in the bulk of my military career. Where do you think you're going? I'm just gonna go out and get a little fresh air. No, you're staying right here, Bookbinder. - But, look, colonel, I... Sit down, Bookbinder. Sit down. That's an order. Now, we're staying in this room together. And when we leave, we are leaving together. Is that understood? As a matter of fact, we're leaving now. It's obligatory that we get an early start, I... Now, see here. Look, you two, I appreciate the food and the hospitality very much, but there's a limit to what you can expect of a guest. You ain't no guest, honey. - You're supper. - What? You take a turn, Polly, and then you can hold the gun for me. Ooh! Heh. I just love soldiers. Heh. Dismiss the troop, corporal. Company dismissed. Sir, am I glad to see you, sir. - What's the problem, Fitzsimmons? - Well, sir, it's a woman. A what? And if you don't mind my saying so, sir, she's quite beautiful. - Well, what's she doing here? - She's looking for Baker, sir. Looking for Baker? Where is she? Well, sir, I had to billet her in the colonel's quarters. You did what? Well, sir, I couldn't very well put her in the enlisted men's barracks, could I? Oh. Good evening, ma'am. I'm Captain Tyler. Colonel Morgan's adjutant. Sergeant Fitzsimmons said that... Tell me what Sergeant Fitzsimmons said I said and then I'll tell you what I said. Yes, ma'am. Well, Sergeant Fitzsimmons said... I'm surprised that your Army has an Irishman in such a position of authority. For you can never rely on one of them for the truth. - He said you... - It's drinking they do best and fighting and blaspheming and telling outrageous stories, the likes of which you've never heard of - in your born days. - He said... Aye, the Irishman with tears in his eyes will tell you that every word passing his lips is the truth. Yes, ma'am. Well, he said that you, uh... - That you came to get... - To get Baker? Aye, I have that. Well, what are your plans, ma'am? I mean, how do you propose to find him? I'm here. He'll know. They're having a good time. Yes, I know. I've seen that kind of good time before. Many times, in the cavalry. Always before they go out, when there's a possibility they may not come back. The Indians do it too, I hear. I'm not giving you to Johnny Cobb. Why aren't you? - Straight out? - Straight out. Well, you were right. You are worth more than the gun. Isn't there another reason? If there was, why should it interest you? A woman is always interested in a man's reasons for changing his mind about her. You asked me why I've made my husband live alone all these years. Well, we've had a month together out of every one of those years. And in each of those months, we lived a year. Each time he took his leave, it was always new. Each time we've been together, it's been new. It was falling in love all over again, year after year. I was always ready for him and always wanted him. Do you think I would've meant the same thing to him if I'd lived all those years with him in the desert, in the heat and the dirt? "A cold, barren woman," your friend said of me. No. Because you see, my bed is a rose garden. I can tell you now the real reason I'm not giving you to Johnny Cobb. If I can't have you, why should he? Bookbinder. Breathe a word of this to a living soul and you're a dead man. - Wake up. Come on, Joe, wake up. - Hm? - Your future wife is here. - Oh. - Where? - The fort at Dry Wells. How do you know? It's true? White squaw come far land. Stage bring. - What makes him think it's Dover? - He heard her talking to a sergeant. Blue coat. White woman. Dover, Dover. - Dover. It's true then. All right. - Hm. Baker, good friend. You better go get her. I'll meet you at Potter's Mesa. Mr. Cobb, we haven't had the pleasure of seeing you around the fort lately. Been off on an ocean voyage, have you? Ain't none of the Army's business where I've been. I ain't wanted in this here territory. No, you're not wanted for anything in this territory yet, Mr. Cobb, but we always have high hopes of doing business with you in the future. You too, Mr. Moon. Now, do you mind if I ask what you're hauling there? None of your business. Not true, Mr. Cobb. Why, that could be rifles for the Apaches, or whiskey. Any manner of things. Whose horses are these? The one there is Mr. Moon's. The other's mine. I bought him. Who from? - What difference does it make? I asked, Mr. Cobb. That's the difference. I bought him from a man named Malachi Morton. Hm. Mr. Morton sold you the saddle and the saddle bags and all, did he? Yeah. That's right. Well, sold you his razor too. Looks like Mr. Morton went out of business permanently, didn't he? Now, then... Uh-uh. I wouldn't do that if I was you. I just knew, deep in my heart, we'd be doing business together one of these days. I didn't steal that there big gun. I bought it from Mr. Morton. Now, a Gatling gun disappeared from the federal arsenal in El Paso four weeks ago. I figure that one is it. What do you figure? I didn't take it. That's not the point, Mr. Cobb. The point is that you've got it. And I figure you and Mr. Moon here for ten to 20 years in federal prison. Hm? Of course, I could just take the gun from you and look the other way while you two ride off into the sunset. What are you getting at? I'm trying to find a man named Baker. I figure if there's anybody in the territory can help me, it's you. Why should I? Ten to 20, Mr. Cobb. Miss Dover MacBride? Aye. Baker sent me. Whoa, mule. Whoa. My sweet and loving brother, Tommy, who's looking after my interests in the West. Oh, you're a truly dependable sort, Tommy. And how's your health, Baker? Glad to see you, Dover. Are you now? Years ago, when I was but a wee lassie in Scotland, the Americans came to town with a traveling circus. They called it the Great Big Western Show. It was all make-believe. Just like you, Baker, with your gun on your hip and the devil in your heart. Well, you're not being fair to me, Dover. I don't have the devil in my heart. Do you have me in your heart, then? You're the only woman I ever think about. Oh, if I believed that, the United States government should ship me back to Scotland as an undesirable due to mental incompetence. Do you really believe I could ever look at another woman? I wasn't thinking about your looking, Baker. I was thinking about your touching and your kissing and your hugging. Men get fairer hearings at a crooked poker game than they get from you. I've missed you, Baker. I've missed you because I love you. Are you gonna marry with me or are you not? Of course, I am, Dover. But my men, they look to me and depend on me. Aye. I have no doubt they look to you, Baker, and depend on you too. They look to you as the embodiment of their own heathen ways and depend on you for the hair of the dog that bit them. Nay, pack up, Baker. For if you intend to marry with me, it's back to the land that spawned you. I couldn't say no to you doing something big in your life, but I have a life too, and you best be remembering it. You're not make-believe, lad. You're not the Great Big Western Show. And with another brother like you, Tommy, I'd be out of the business as a woman. Aye. One more week or else. Or else what? If you do not make arrangements to join me in a week, I'll be returning to Pittsburgh and making my bed with Angus MacNamara. - Angus MacNamara? - Aye. You wouldn't do that to me... You wouldn't shame me like that. You've been away a long time, Baker. I'm a woman with a woman's feelings and a woman's desires. One more week and no more, or it's back to Angus MacNamara, that wee, small, gnat of a man from Pittsburgh. Come on. Giddyap. Ha! What a cruel woman she is. What is it you want with Baker? He's got something that belongs to me. And you want it back, huh? Yes, I want it back. Well, it must be valuable. It is. - Did he steal it? - That's right. There it is. There's where you're gonna find him. Mm-hm. All right, Cobb, a deal's a deal. You and Moon can go now. Well, now, if it's all the same to you, we'll just tag along. No, I don't need you anymore, Cobb. I don't want you. Baker's got something for me, Morgan. Soon as I get it, I'll leave. You were heading for there all the time, weren't you? Bringing him the gun? Now, what does he want with a Gatling gun? I never asked him. None of my business. Of course, if I was to make a guess, I'd say he were planning... - Something big. - Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Something mighty big. Senor MacBride. Look. - Baker, the big gun, it's coming and... Luis, the big gun is here. Now, you give Cobb and Moon every chance to leave, and no bloodshed. And get somebody to get our Indian friends. Goddamn it, give me time to finish, laddie. Colonel Morgan and Jesse is with them. - What? - Aye. It's all happening at once. What do we do now? Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker, any minute now, my husband is gonna come riding over that hill. All my female instincts want to rush into his arms, but I won't. Not only because of the horrible mess you're in, but because of you and the way you've treated me, like a lady. I want you to have that something big. So I'll just go inside while you settle it with Mr. Cobb. But please, please be careful. It's the devil demanding his due, laddie. I've been thinking about you, colonel. Have you? I've been thinking about you too, Baker. I've been thinking about you for days and days. Yeah? Well, I was just telling Tommy here... Now, hold on, colonel. It was all a mistake. Now, if I'd have known... Wait, now, you see, if you're gonna fight, I don't wanna fight... - Get out of the way. - Yes, sir. Oh, colonel, don't hit him again. Let's talk about it. Oh, Mary Anna. - Donald. - Oh, you look lovely. What are you doing with that dog? Whose dog is that? ! It's mine. She hasn't been touched. Nobody laid a hand on her. Argh! I was planning on bringing her to you. Ask her if you don't believe me. Aah! It's enough, do you hear me? Enough. You're both just alike. Has he taken advantage of you? - No. He was gonna bring me to you. Oh. You got that there woman for me? His wife? Were you gonna give my wife to him? Look, colonel, me and you, we don't have to fight again, do we? - Yep. - Donald... Baker. You and me, we got a deal. The big gun for a woman. I don't get the woman, you don't get the big gun. Luis. I got 20 guns and they're all aimed at you. So that ends your argument. The big gun is mine. No, hold on a minute now. The gun is federal property. - You can't have it. - Let him have it. Let him have it? It's government property. - I'm a colonel of the cavalry... No, you're not. - What? - You were retired two days ago. You have nothing to say about that gun. Let him have it. Ah. Ugh! - Get off my wagon. All right, men, we ride. Giddyap. Excuse me, Mary, I'll just be a moment. Where are you going, Cobb? Just about as far away from here as I can get. I gotta have a woman. What about your friend there? You wanna bury him? No. Maybe something will come out of the hills tonight and drag him off. - All I wanted was a woman. - Mm-hm. Cobb. It just happens that we know about a couple of women. On this side? No, just over the border. No, now, that don't help me an awful lot, does it? Well, I just thought I'd let you know. What are you setting out here for, mister? I can't cross that there line. Everybody wants to kill me. There's a price on my head. Unh! Wait here. What do you make of it, lad? - Where are they? I do not know. You'd better find them, Luis, because I'm about to get mad. Si, that's Emilio Estevez. Uh... - No. - Si, that is Emilio Estevez. Tell me, you're not Emilio Estevez? I am Brother Emilio Estevez. The biggest bandit in Mexico? Heh, heh, heh. No. Those days are gone. Those days are over, praise God. Over? I was once a man of great evil and walked in the shadows of wickedness. But God, in his infinite mercy, found me and delivered me into the garden of heaven. Then there's no treasure? See the lilies in the field, how they grow? They neither toil nor spin. But even Solomon, in all his glory, was never clothed like one of these. This is our treasure, brother. We share it with you. No. No. Let's get out of here. What kind of a mess are we in now? I don't know, but I wish I was back in the Army. Here come your Indians. This is a right pickle. Us here and the gun down there. Hey, they're leaving us. Where they going? They've used up your whiskey. Get in between them and head us out of here. Hiyah! Here he comes. Here comes the gun. We've done it. We've done it. Baker! Baker! We did it, laddie. We did it. The gold. Where's the gold? Where else? There go the last of them. Here it is, men. Oh. Look at that. Nay, pack up, Baker. For if you intend to marry with me, it's back you go now to the land that spawned you. I couldn't say no to you doing something big in your life, but I have a life too, and you best be remembering it now. You're not make-believe, lad. You're not the G|reat Big Western Show. No regrets? Oh, no regrets, my dear. No. It's not the end, you know. It's the beginning. Remember what I wrote you last year about missing you so badly? You said you would give your boots and saddle - to spend one night with me. - Shh. Well, I don't have boots and saddle any longer. - But all your nights. - Heh, heh. Present arms! Thanks for my share, Joe. Close ranks. Ho! You've got a fine big man there, Mrs. Morgan. I think we're both fortunate, Miss MacBride. Aye, we are that. Mind your step, my dear. Be with you in a moment. Now, Jesse, my replacement will be here before long. He's unfamiliar with the territory, but I'm sure with your able assistance, I... I'll do everything I can to help him, colonel. Yes, I'm sure you will. God help him. Now, sergeant, that's for you. You drink it in good health and may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're there. Heh, heh, heh. - Goodbye, sergeant. - Sir, I... Here, here, here. Get a grip on yourself, man. You've been in the Army too long, sergeant. Entirely too long. Column two, to the left! Forward! Ho! I'm still gonna write that letter! You just see if I don't! Finest light cavalry in the world. It was a dark day I humbled my poor body to you, you great ape. I love him. Trap for the general Gentleman, I think that you know in what position are we. Germans have retreated. Military speaking, we lost the battle. But it's not over yet. God willing, soon there will be conflict between Russia and America. Commies are sitting on shaky chair. It up to us, with help from the aboard to make it more shaky. What is our first task? Foreign countries will help us in two ways. Materially and by sending saboteurs in the country. We have to make unsteadiness among people. By all means and without mercy. With diversions. Killing resistants, officers, party members, with sabotages, arsons... That we demolish before they can build. Be without mercy with those who betray us. Does that means, general, that you're stick to your decision? What decision, Ras? - The one, that we stay in the country and not go abroad. My commandants should understand that. Especially you, Ras. To go abroad means that we are surrending. We must go back to Serbia. Now we need iron discipline more then ever. Correct. In what way we'll be in touch with you? I'll let you know afterwards. If you'll allow me General, what's with Schwarz? There's no words from him from Austria. - He called me. Schwarz has crossed the border and in a few days he should arrive with his saboteurs. I sent our man to meet him. Schwarz's group will be our main force. I think we understood each other. Dear minister, it seemed like you were absent on this meeting? Dear general, my presence is now redundant. You would be in a better position if you had listened to ministers before. This way you lost army and war. Even great Reich couldn't help you. And you still have some illusions that you'll do something. With who, how? Fallacy, general. fallacy. We were killing, slaughtering these people, terrorizing it, and now you want help from it? Our dukes will be welcomed with shitty sticks, general. What's new my loyal Janko? General, army is nearby again. You have to find another shelter. We have information that he is somewhere in Bosnia. With rest of his chetnik units, he's hiding somewhere in the mountains. Army didn't manage to surround him and capture him. And is half a year since the war is over. After all that's not the job for the army. We have to solve that puzzle. - What do you mean colonel, when the army didn't succeed? - We need general alive. Not military destroyed, but alive. That he admits publicly crimes that chetniks did during the war alongside with the occupator. When we capture a leader, we'll liquidate rest of the 20.000 renegade, that still pillage in Serbia and Bosnia. We need kind of man, that can do that by himself. I hope I was clear. I think I have that kind of man. I heard a shot. When I ran outside, they were already dead. It was terrible. I remembered well one of them. Short, dark. I'll remember him for life. That face with a scar, those eyes. He had a star on his hat. Doctor, you're needed urgently in room 23. I'll be right there. You're feeling better now right? You were delirious for a long time. You were saying something all the time. I'll tell you later. Those were happy days, when I was with Kondor. I'm surprised that I never saw you during the war. You couldn't see me. After Kondor I was sent abroad for a special mission. You shouldn't come back in this hell. I agree. I shouldn't But there's no other choice for us. What are you doing now? - Operating. I didn't mean that. - I know. I'm sorry that you're leaving tomorrow. You'd preferred that I'm still sick? - No, no. If you need anything, please don't hesitate. I'm always here. I hope we'll see each other again. Welcome, Ras. What happened with the teacher and hers? - We don't know, Ras. We just hear shot in the night. We buried them next day. - And Vera? We couldn't find her. They took her somewhere. What is it? Is this Serbian feast? Where is celebration? Help yourself, Ras. Is this feast or not? What are you waiting for? - Rejoice. Dance children. Vividly, children. Vividly, vividly! What's he doing here? He's dancing with his coevals. Do you know who's his father? Never mind the father, it's not child's fault. Come here. Come. You're dancing, you're happy. Where's your father? He's serving, right? - My father is not a servant! How much is he paid? - Less then Krauts paid you. Why, Ras? ! Didn't you have enough blood? How much longer will you kill this people? Army! - On horses! Ras! Listen... Who is it? My little cousin. I took him not to be alone. Ras, why did they do it? - You know what you father was with us during the war. That's why. Do you have tobacco? - I have, I'm saving it for you. I'll get even with them. You know that Ras can do that. Ras I met young doctor in the hospital. What doctor? Wait. His brother was also killed by the Commies. He was with Kondor during the war. And when they came to power he was transferred abroad. Now he wants connection with you. - Connection with us? What's his name? - Doctor. That's what they call him. He was with Kondor you say. Did you told him something? - I told him nothing. He entrusted me. He wants connection. I don't want that connection. Say it to Perun. I don't know nothing about that. You understand? - All right Ras, as you wish. I thought he could be your contact with foreign countries. It's going to be hot tonight. - I chose the best guys. Maybe he won't come. - Don't worry. Us intelligencers, we know something too. They are right on time. - Of course, Schwarz was trained in the Gestapo. So we got him alive. - Da. Hello aldermen. What is it? What is it comrades. You scared? You have the power, but you don't have the courage. Lousy, poor cowards. Well done hero. You with your guns, we bear handed and you're the brave one. Great. Great, bravo. Now that's a real fighter. Take this away, and let her stay. Quickly, get up. We should save brave comrades. Wait! Where to beautiful? Let me go! Look at this. Fools. They'll put manhunt on us again. Let's go down there. What was that, Perun? They don't obey brother, they don't. And your guy is busy. Wasting his energy. This can't go one like this, Perun. It was possible before, not now. People doesn't want us. You speak same as you did to the general. Go abroad and hit them from there. Ras, that's nonsense. - Abroad, what else? Anyway you and Feliks were always keeping aside with the general. Separated me from him. You have doubts about everything? Are you crazy? I'm not crazy. I was looking for you and Feliks to tell you that. To tell us what? That you made something in your heads, that you standing like the wall between general and me. But watch it Perun, Ras is not naive. I don't understand you, Ras, why are you bringing up old things again? You'll understand. Ras can manage without general. But I'm not sure that he can manage without me. It's like you're threatening. - Where is the general? Why are you hiding him from me? I also don't know where is he. He'll probably call us when he needs us. Tell him that it can be too late then. An that he thinks good about everything. And tell him to get across Drina as soon as possible. He'll be safer. Listen up. Have Vera told you something about some doctor? Yes, yes. I told her I want to meet him. Don't worry, I'll check him out. Good afternoon, Vera. - Good afternoon. That's the way out here. - It's idyllic. I'm happy to se you again. You called me very soon. - I had to. We have a wounded man. - Is he at your house? - No. At one of our people. Vera, can I ask you something? Do you still love Ras? Don't be surprised. We all know about that love. I just want to know how it started. He suddenly came into our house. Legends were told about him among the girls. As soon as I saw him, I knew what will happen. You loved him very much? You're still together? He's away for a long time. Ras is like that. Hello. My little cousin. Don't worry. There's no one until you reach the village. You're house is on a good place. Perun should be here any moment. He'll take you to see wounded man. Perun? Strange. Why strange? - Perun was on the commies side. They killed his brother. That's why he's against them now. Perun is fearsome around here. Are you Perun? - Yes. You accomplishments are well known. - Really? - Yes. You're well armed. Where did you fought Doctor? - With Kondor. Do you know Kasepšet? You mean Kondor's companion? - Yes. He was badly wounded. I couldn't save him. Those are our first results. This will encourage our people. We live like in a desert. This is first aid kit. Where's the wounded man? Not far away. Let's go Let's go, Doctor. Thank you, goodbye. - Goodbye. Bring me hot water. Come on, hurry up. Get him! Don't let him escape! Take him away. Who's this? - My son. You told me that he died in battle. Nice... They mobilized him. And he immediately became sergeant right? My son! Let him go. It's not his fault. Let him go. Let him go. Tell them. How is he? - He'll be all right? What's with this? We found him hiding. Scum. Doctor, would you kill him? It's in order to meet like that. You having a party, Perun? - Not yet. You'll see. Doctor is innkeeper. Which Doctor? Meet him. Our man from Belgrade. - Doktor. A, Doktor. - You remember me? We were together with Kondor. - Good doctor and even better secret agent. - You have good memory. Where did you go? We haven't heard anything about you. And we heard all kinds of stories. We heard something about some partisan secret agent, Doctor. - I know. Where are you going Doctor? To get my bag. Let him go! We served you, fed you and dressed you for 4 years and now you want to wrap us in black. I beg you! General orders. - He's our only son! Please, please. Come on. - Let him go! Go on, Doctor. O, Doctor. Where have you been for so long? You can still drink. - Another one. What's wrong with you? What happened? You haven't slept again. Don't think about that soldier. That's the life of a secret agent. Both tragic and heroic. Secret agent can't be a hero. Serve your guest. Everything is going sloppy again. We caught Schwarz yesterday, and we lost general's trail completely. Like he's disappeared. For the first time, we don't know what to do next. Do you still have fate in that plan with Vera? And you? I don't know. We haven't got Ras yet and we want general alive. - You don't say. General alive. You saw yourself what happened to me at my first encounter. They are afraid of their own shadow. - I know. But you were our best secret agent during the war. I was. It's different during the war. Until we capture him they'll keep terrorizing people. All right man, what do you want from me? What are you convincing me in? I told you and the other, trough Vera we'll get Ras, trough Ras to the general. - To the general alive. Alive, damn it! If he doesn't die before. Enough! Listen you two. Go to Belgrade. Give this note to Vili. But be careful. No one else can get this. Understand? What is it father? I heard everything. Be careful child. Check his papers. Get of. What are you waiting for? Get of. Give me your papers. Papers I said. Run away! Comrade! Why are you banging? It's locked. I want to go inside. Who are you looking for? I live here. Show me your papers. I don't have them at my person. - Then you must come with me. But listen to me... - You'll explain everything there. Did you decode the note? - We did, here. CHECK WHO IS 'DOCTOR'. WHAT IS WITH MY ARRIVAL AT BELGRADE? RAS What's your connection with Ras? - With Ras? I don't even know who that is. And do you know who's the man from the mansion? - I have no idea. When I was leaving the village, they told me to hand over that letter. Take her to jail. Call the car on duty. We're going to the mansion. There, the grain is here. I'm grinding it, but for who? We live like beasts. How long will live like this, Ras? - I don't know. That's like this mill. It doesn't stop until grinds everything. Because there is nothing on the field that does not grow. Listen, Vid. You'll have to go to Belgrade too. You're sending me to Vili? - To Vili. Be careful. Army is everywhere. How's it possible that all treasons are coming from Belgrade then when Doctor appeared. - What's with Doctor? You told me you know him since Kondor. That he killed their soldier in front of you. Yes general, but they can kill everyone just to get to you. Yes. It's cold general. - Yes. Everything is ready. We're splitting into two groups. Janko will go with you at new hiding place. Let's go. Contact remains the same. That is just about sewing machines. They were on sale... Four for one. Look, mom, we took a career test at school today. It tells us what job is a good fit for our personality. It's my job to tell you that. Your school has no business... Surgeon General, very good, Evan. Dang, fool. Even by Chinese standards, you're a nerd. My backpack doesn't agree with you. Just ignore him, baby. Soon you will be a doctor with the power of the military. No one expects a coup from the Surgeon General. But he'd just be overthrowing Emery, who I'm sure got preside... Flight attendant? I like travel, snacks, and being helpful. It checks all the boxes. Oh, flight attendants don't even get a seat on the plane. They walk back and forth pushing a cart. They're the homeless of the sky! Sir, your lab results are in. Your diagnosis... Butt face. S02E14 Michael Chang Fever _ Here, let me help you. It's okay, I got it. Here you got, grandma. I see you have a magazine. May I help you with your soda? _ Everyone, come on. The Super Bowl is on. But the Super Bowl isn't until the end of the month. It's the Asian Super Bowl. Michael Chang is in the Australian Open. We are witnessing history. _ Mm. I prefer Pete Sampras. No way! How can you not be a member of the Chang Gang? 14. I had these made. You boys are so lucky to have an Asian pro athlete to look up to. It's way more than what I had. Ooh! Hell yeah, Jin-Ho! That was a flagrant takedown. Way to ref-er-ee! Yeah, way to dominate with the rules. He's Asian. He got the call wrong, but you always support your own. How are their socks longer than their shorts? I'm out. Are you joking? This is the greatest game known to mankind. It is a sport that is both aggressive and elegant, just like your mother. I have a question. Great. A question from a real fan. Why is tennis so boring? They keep taking about Grand Slams, but I don't see pancakes anywhere. And why are the balls and the court green? Seems like a design flaw. You know what? Just leave. Okay! Ace! Go, Chang. Whoo! Well, Betsy, if you take a look at the leaders in tournament wins and prize money, Michael Chang is right up there. He's earned millions of dollars. 15-Love. Scoring system is based on love. Hey, would you be interested in learning how to play? - Yes. - Yes. Why does this homework look so hard? Oh, it's Evan's. Grabbed the wrong backpack. Ain't that some bunk, G-Dubs? "Get me my Pogs or else"? I think I accidentally got the remedial homework. What's up with this? Are you getting picked on? This kid at school keeps bugging me for my Pogs. See, this only happens to nerds. Thank you for your help. Why didn't you come to me? This is my thing. All you got to do with mean kids is make yourself big like a bear. You look constipated. Whatever, man. Nobody's gonna step to this. Give it a try. I don't know. Come on. Just arch your back, stick out your chest, stand on your toes, and give me your hardest look. Like this? No. Let me help you carry your tennis stuff, mom. Oh, that's okay. That's for being a flight attendant, not for tennis. Don't be silly. I'm just helping. Give it. Give it back! Okay. It looks like we all have tennis fever. I'll coach him on his serve. Why don't you return anything that makes it over the net? Okay, Emery. Tennis... at its core, it's about discipline, sportsmanship, style. Hurry up! Michael Chang started at age 6. We're already behind. Jessica, he needs to learn the "why" before the "how." Sorry. Don't apologize. Okay, sorry. Uh, how did you know how to do that? I'm just doing what I saw on TV. Is that okay? Uh, yeah. Here. Do it again. Wow. He's really got a smooth swing. Oh, thank... Hey, you look familiar. You're that bank teller who never has any singles. Uh, Jessica, that's Billie Jean King, one of the greatest tennis players of all time after Michael Chang. Well, actually, I was much, much better than Michael Chang by every possible career measurement. Hmm. Uh, what are you doing in Orlando? Oh, I have to be down here 183 days a year for tax purposes. Hmm. You know, he's a natural. I think you could really go far. - Really? - Yes. Hey, Tennis! I'd like to buy all the lessons! They're $45 an hour. I want to buy one of the lessons for Louis, then he can teach Emery all of the lessons. Emery has a gift for tennis. We could do father-son tournaments. Flight attendant, my ass. He'll get sports scholarships. I'll be his coach. I could pass my skills onto him, and he to his son. He could just win prize money, and then he'll just buy an election. One day, he'll defeat me on the court. We won't speak for years, but we'll make up when I'm on my death bed. I bought this book on child sports prodigies. Most of them grew up an only child. Grab your essentials. Emery's moving into your room. What? Why? So he doesn't have to share a bunk with Evan. He needs to get proper rest without distractions. Don't worry. It's not forever. It's just while Emery is training, and he will always be training. I heard that. You're like three feet away. Why wouldn't I hear that? Hello, Eddie. The top bunk is mine. Let's go over the BMA. Bunk Mate Agreement? They're ground rules for living in my space. Rule 1... Do not rearrange the star stickers on the ceiling. They're set for the equinox. That's Rule 1? Rule 2... If I get stuck in my shirt, you will help me remove my shirt. A "G" and a nerd sharing a room. It's like "The Odd Couple" up in here. Rule 3... you may only use references I understand. - It doesn't say that. - It does. Okay, so, how'd it go with that mean kid at school? - Did you get big? - I did. - Did it work? - It didn't. What happened? The kid is a fifth-grader who knows that trick. I don't know what to do. If anyone's gonna pick on you, it's gonna be me. Guess I have to regulate. Hello? Remember? Rule 2? Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! Sorry. Dumplings are for athletes. Go. My son is the one blasting aces. Let us know if there's something you want him to endorse. _ Tagging in. Sorry! Chang blows a forehand past Becker. Things are heating up in the finals of the Australian Open. That's right, Chang. Tire him out. Chang will win because he works hard, and hard work always pays off. Mm-hmm. You got this, baby. - You stand on the shoulders of Jin-Ho. - Yes. No! Game, set, match... Becker. - Ohh! - Aah! Well, at least he lost to the best. You see, Emery, the life lesson here is... Chang didn't work hard enough. Second place is just the last to lose. No. The life lesson here is anything that happens in Australia doesn't count. Sorry I can't hang with you, boo. Got to take care of some business. Oh, okay. I was gonna tell you there's an ice cream truck outside. Rumor has it they're running a special on Bomb Pops. What's that? A schedule for Emery's training. What about school? All this will be in addition to school. It will go tennis then school, school and tennis until he's the best. Okay, you're going a little overboard with this whole thing. Thank you. No, no. It's too much, Jessica. I'm glad Emery's good at tennis, but let's have a little perspective. He's only 10 years old. You're right. I've made a mistake. We have to fire your father. Okay. Why didn't you get a Bomb Pop, man? I don't eat our nation's colors. Regulators, look. We got here just in time. Nobody stop me! Hold up. This is the game plan. We're gonna roll up and be like, bla-ow, but with our faces. And then that kid will know. Yo! What? ! This is who's bugging you? That's her all right. Get her! Ugh, why are you taking Evan's Pogs? I haven't been taking them. I've been winning them. He owes me big time. Wait, I thought you just collected Pogs. It's a game, too? Yeah, man. You throw a slammer at a stack of Pogs. Whichever Pogs land face up you get to keep. I'm not trying to understand this, Dave. How did you lose Pogs you don't even have? Stacey loaned me some. I'm on a cold streak, but I'll pay her back. Let's go another round. I'm good for it. Pile them up, Stacey! I think he has a problem. Are you afraid, Stacey? Are you afraid of my Pog hand? Because you should be! Now, your final match is coming up, and I need to discuss something important with you. Hairstyle. Dad, I think we can all agree we want me to be the best tennis player I can be. Exactly. We'll go with curls. Which is why in order for me to get to the next level, we have to make a coaching change. Are you firing me? Sorry. Did you put him up to this? Yes. Emery, I'm so proud of you for having the courage to fire your father so you can achieve excellence. A flight attendant wouldn't have the eggs to do that. Thanks, mom. You're fired, too. What? You've been a little distracting at my matches. Out. In! Fault. Are you blind? Here, take these. They will help... with your blindness. You have to come down eventually. I just get fired up because I want to see you win. I think we can all agree we want me to be the best... Don't give me that speech. I wrote that speech. I give you that speech. Wait, if I'm not going to coach you, who is? We can't afford a ton of lessons. Actually, I found someone who will do it for free. Hi, folks. I promise I'll coach your boy as if he were my own son. Let's go, you little puke. Bye, mom. Bye, dad. See you at dinner. We've been checkmated, Louis. Checkmated at tennis. I can't believe you lied to me. I thought you were getting picked on. I'm addicted, okay? I'm addicted to playing Pogs. I don't even get what you see in that noise. I love the thrill of taking risks, laying it all on the line. But I know I've gone too far. So you know what you have to do? Steal money from mom's purse. Shut up! You crazy? ! Mom might hear you! And I know when to do it, too. She sleeps heavy after she eats Mexican food, so I just have to wait until it's burrito Thursday. Dang, that's cold. You're not a nerd. You're a lowercase "g." Look, I respect the thought, but you'd probably get mom's decoy purse anyways. Don't worry. I know how to get Stacey off your back. Well, it's good that Emery is taking his training so seriously. Great work. Now treat yourself to 15 laps around the block. Billie Jean disguises punishment as treats. She gets it. I'm not exactly thrilled we got fired. But Emery is embracing tennis, and he's learning from the best. We both got what we wanted. I'm glad we're on the same page. No, we're not. I was just encouraging his love for the game, which would hopefully turn into a lifelong father-son connection. You made it into a competitive thing. We're both mad at Emery, I know, but at least we get to go to his matches and watch him win. Did you bring my glasses? Yes, I-I got them, I got them. Uh, I'm afraid I can't let you in. Why not? You've been banned from matches for harassing our umpire. But how could he tell who harassed him if he's blind? Jessica, look. They both have success perms. Great final-match hairstyle. Let's just go. I don't want to distract Emery. I want him to achieve excellence. You're wasting your time as a gate attendant. This is beautiful. Thanks for coming, Stacey. You've been looking good, girl. You been doing that Tae Bo? Just give me my Pogs. I'll get right to it, then. We called you here to ask for one final Pog match. If Evan wins, you'll forgive his debt. If he loses, I'll give you this. A mint-condition Garbage Pail Kid... 1985 Stinky Stan. It's worth twice the Pogs Evan owes you. Get your slammer. I need to borrow one. Who's this? The best gambler in our family. Grandma, are you sure you know how to play this game? _ You did it, grandma! They're all face up! We won! - Double or nothing! - What are you doing, man? We did it. It's over. I need the energy. No! Never leave a hot table! I won the Round Robin Tournament. Oh, that's fantastic. I wish we could have been there... But at least you're on a better career path. Coach King wants to enroll me in a tennis academy at Coral Gables. It's super-hard to get into. It's where all the best players train. It's a four-hour drive, so I'd have to move there for the year. Move? But you're only 10. That's why I don't want to do it. I mean, if it's okay with you. It's okay with us. Uh, Emery, are you sure about this? Yeah. I'd miss you guys too much. Great. Well, whatever you want to do, we support you. Thanks. Tennis is fun and stuff, but there are a lot of things I want to do, like flying around the world as a flight attendant. Well, I guess we need to embrace the kid we have. Like you said, whatever he wants to do, we'll support him. Absolutely. Space camp? Astronauts are like flight attendants, but for science. Travel, snacks, helping others. It checks all the boxes. What are you doing? Embracing the kid we have. If he's gonna be a flight attendant, he's gonna be the best kind. I'm gonna float down the aisle of the spaceship and say, "Trash? Trash? Trash?" Hey. I was thinking about what you said about needing that energy. Here. "Dum Dum's Guide to Becoming a Stockbroker"? I read an article in Vibe magazine about Russell Simmons. The stock market is his jam. He says, if you're gonna gamble, gamble with other people's money. Thanks. I'll check it out. I'm sorry about before. You don't really have a butt face. Cool. Hey, I'm not training for tennis anymore, so we can switch back bedrooms. Know what? I want to crash with Evan for one more night. Just two G's in a bunk bed. Eddie, rule number 1! Nice to see you. Where's Emery? Please sit, Billie Jean King. I think we can all agree that we want what's best for Emery. Are you firing me? Yes. And you were doing this for free, so it must be especially painful. Okay. Hey, what the heck? ! Find yourself, Billie Jean. So, is Pete Sampras nice? No, you know what? I don't want to know. I don't want to know. I'm gonna be, like, the ambassador of the human race. Got my date wrong. I need some space, but let's still be friends. - I need you all to leave. - He's kicking us out. I still want to hire you for this position. I'm going back to New York. You can't run from this forever, Ozzie. Empathy. Gina is Empathy. What are you doing? Shut up. I'm on a date. You've met someone? That's great! That's not... No. It's for the mission. Of course. You know, Nancy, you... really know how to show a guy a good time. And... thanks for paying for dinner. My pleasure. I'm definitely gonna check out Ayn Rand's stuff. She sounds so interesting. - Ayn. It's pronounced... - Ayn. You should get people's names right. Well... "Ayn" having a very good time tonight. So, what else can you tell me about Gina? I think I pretty much covered everything. You know, her likes, her dislikes, how we met, where she lives. - And there's nothing else... - I should know? Okay. Yeah. I think I know what's going on here. - You do? - Listen. There is nothing going on between me and Gina. I mean, yes, I've always thought she had a crush on me, but... she is not my type. You are. - What do I do? - Kiss him! Look, I really... I'm tempted to invite you in right now, but I'm... I'm still transitioning from divorced guy to single guy, so... Very well. Good night. I'll see you at StarCrossed tomorrow. I look forward to it. She's the one. I've gathered useful intel on Empathy from this asset. Empathy? You mean... The woman who killed Kurt. Sweet Kurt. I'm gonna use his knowledge to make her death as painful as possible. That doesn't sound like it's on-mission. I'll humiliate Empathy, and then I'll put an end to her. It'll be clean. Efficient. Maybe we should just talk about this before you do anything. I'm done talking. Now is the time for action. Mom, you didn't have to do all this. Well, I'm just so glad to have you back in town. You've got a new job at The New York Times. Safe. Stable. Prestigious. Next thing you know, you'll meet someone. Maybe like that nice girl you dated who was with the circus. She wasn't in the circus, Mom. She was a yoga teacher who had a nose ring. Hey, Mom, do you know where my Social Security card and birth certificate are? You're a grown man. You should know where your documents are. I do. I have copies. I just... I leave the originals here. I leave everything that's important here, so it's safe. I gave all that stuff to your father. - He has more storage space at his place. - What? No... Ozzie, relax. He's not that bad. That's easy for you to say. You got to divorce him. I did not expect to have to have an awkward time at Uncle Daddy's house today. - Doug? - Hey. Chelsea. What can I do for you? I wanted to see how you were doing. I'm fine, thank you. Are you, um... are you going somewhere? Yes. I'm taking a vacation. After all the stuff that happened, I just, um... need a little time to think. - Because of the kidnapping? - Yes. And other stuff. Where are you going? The Bronze Star Inn. In Schenectady. By the outlet mall? I was in a band a long time ago. Operation Mongoose. No way. My gosh. - Look at you! - Yeah. Guess who's getting the band back together again. Wow. It's happening. Pretend you just ordered some nice, steamy pizza. The delivery guy's on his way up the walk, then bam! Gets bit by a dog. - We don't have a dog. - It doesn't matter. It was on your property. Does home insurance cover it? No. Life insurance? Nope. Umbrella insurance covers everything. Maybe we should get it. Maybe you should. It's like putting bubble wrap around all your worries. Plus you get one of these bad boys. Where do we sign? It's been an eventful couple of weeks. Let's... let's just do the... Kelly, what are you doing? I'm... I'm lounging. It's... it's a lounge. Right. Can you do that without your shoes on, please? Can we not meet in a store? Sorry we're late. We were carpooling. Is that what the kids call it? - Okay, great. - Hi guys. Um, come on in. Let's see. Guys, we really do have to be out of the store by 9:45. Is everyone really clear on the concept of a hard out? - 'Cause I can't... - Yes. We are clear on that. - Let's begin. - No. No, actually, we can't begin, because... Nancy still doesn't have all of her introduction materials, so... Um, right, okay. Um... Here's your binder. Pick a sponsor. Don't make a whole thing out of it. I've got all the time in the world... murderer. I'll be your sponsor, Nancy. There you go. Don? Yeah. H-hi, Jonathan. What is happening right now? Why are you working in a coffee shop? It's related to the mission. It's the truth. It's not. It's not. I'm lying. Can we talk by the milk station? Wow, that's a lovely scarf. No, don't change the subject. Does Jeff know you work here? Technically, no... no. But don't... please don't tell him. Who am I gonna tell? I went rogue. Yeah. I didn't want to bring it up, but I heard through the grapevine. Sorry about that. No. Not at all. I'm enjoying my new-found freedom. I'm out there in the world, you know? But hey, listen, I'm a little strapped for cash. Could you get me an iced mocha macchiato on the house? - Of course. - Cool. And maybe... could you give me your tips? Okay, so, how... how was your week, Richard? Well, there was this one incident. Hey, Richard. There's a long-distance call for you on line two. - Who is it? - I don't know. I couldn't understand it. They were speaking Klingon. Like a Klingon would use a landline. So how'd that make you feel? Okay, I can't process things when you're rushing along my healing. Well, to be clear, I'm rushing through everyone's healing. Okay, Kelly, your turn to share. Um, I feel like your energy's a little too, like, overwhelmed-grad-student right now. Is there a way that we could do this another time and place that's not so rushed? I'm working on it. Nothing has come through yet. Sorry. Nancy, I'm sorry. Things aren't normally this chaotic. My offer still stands. We could meet up tonight at my barn. It would have to be, like, you know, 7:30. - I still got to feed the cows. - Sure, let's meet up there. Sounds murder-y. I like it. The store opens in five minutes. Can you do me a favor and just pick up your trash? And if you'd please put the pillows around and distribute them, I'd be really grateful. - Check the alarm. - I'm not going out the back. Go out the back. Check the alarm, guys. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Dad, are you home? Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. - Dad? - Nam myoho... - Hey, Dad? - Renge kyo. Nam myoho... You can join me if you want. No. I'm good. Ozzie! My man! Okay. All right. Yeah, it's good to see you too, Dad. So, when did you become a Buddhist? About four months ago. Got into it for this chick. She left, but it stayed. Well, all right. Did Mom call you and tell you I need to pick up some documents? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I keep all that stuff cataloged in my office. Dad, what's this? Was I in Beacon as a kid? I can't answer that. What do you mean, you can't answer it? It's a yes or no question. That I can't answer. Your mother made me promise. I'm sorry. All right. I'll just ask her myself. No. Put that away. We're gonna have to have a family meeting. Family meeting? We never have those. What's going on? Welcome to the Coconut Lounge, where the drinks are cold and the jazz is hot. This next number is one of our first songs we ever wrote together. It's called "Serengeti Rhapsody." Uno. Dos. Uno. Dos. Tres. Bless you, bless you. I-I met someone. He's, um, from Iceland. He's really sweet, and we're taking it slow. Good for you. Good, good, good. Sounds like progress. He's cool. He's, like, um... he's not really cool, but I don't really care. Which... I guess is maturity. Yes, Nancy. Do you have something that you'd like to share with Kelly? No. I would like to schedule a one-on-one appointment with you, Gina. Just you and me. Alone. I'm shy. We don't really do that here at StarCrossed. The point of group therapy is to connect with people who share a common experience. You're new. I made the same mistake. But you're doing great. Everybody loves you. Man, so desperate for love. You lost me? ! You wandered off. That's good. Blame the nine-year-old. Can you let us explain? Believe me, we know. It was not our proudest parenting moment. Fine, just tell me what happened. Okay. Yes, we went to Beacon. There was a heat wave that summer. And we thought we'd go to the lake, but your father got lost. We almost hit a deer at one point. Wait, you almost hit a deer? So now we're all hungry and lost, so we go to a grocery store for some snacks. Next thing I know, we're yelling at each other. I can't even remember what we were fighting about. Anything and everything. We could see that you were upset, so we got you a grape soda and we sat you on the horsey ride. And, after a few minutes, we looked up, and you were gone. Ozzie! We ran ourselves crazy looking for you. We... we searched all over town. I've never been more scared than I was that day. The worst 48 hours of my life. We thought we'd lost you for good. And then, out of nowhere, we got a call. One of the stock boys had found you asleep behind the big bags of dog food. I blamed him for losing you. He blamed me. And the guilt tore us apart. Soon after that, we got a divorce. Wow. We thought you'd be more upset. You're not mad at us for losing you? No, I'm-I'm furious at you, but this explains everything... all the deja vu that I've been having in Beacon... it was just that I was suppressing the memories of this divorce. Beacon was the place where my family fell apart. That's why Beacon triggered... all the anxiety and my breakdown. It wasn't aliens. Aliens? Yeah, here's the thing. I wasn't in Beacon writing a Civil War novel. I was in therapy because I thought I'd been abducted by aliens. Abducted by aliens? Therapy? Good news. I wasn't. All right? All of the trauma that I was going through was just because you all were horrible parents, which, no offense, but this is a relief... if you see it from my side. So, like, what, you were seeing, little green guys or something? Like, a tall lizard guy, and then there was, like, a Nordic, like, white one with long hair. It's-it's beside the point. I had my quit my job, and I was in this support group. I was living in a shitty motel. I had a piece of metal taken out of my head, which I need to talk to you guys about that at some point... but I had really spiraled. Ozzie, why didn't you tell us? You kept a secret from me for 30 years. I kept one for two months. So I think... it's a little kettle-calling-the-pot-kettle. So, Nancy, last time, you mentioned you lost a friend. I believe his name was Kirk. Kurt, actually. Y-yeah, is he your boyfriend? 'Cause you never actually mentioned... He was my co-worker. But you were close. Yes, we were very close. Did you feel that you and Kurt... were more than just coworkers? Yes, I suppose we were. - We had a... - Special bond. Did you love Kurt? Is she taunting me? Does she want to luxuriate in the details of the murder she committed? I won't give her the pleasure. I came here to join this group for support. I did not come here to be interrogated in a barn by some quack. No! Nancy! Use that! Your anger is good! Own it! Own it! Or take it out on me if you need to. I know what this is. She's super jealous. She thinks you're in love with me. Why would she think that? I don't know. Well, um... I know we're a bunch of old guys up there, and we're a little rusty. You have a number-one fan here. - Okay. Well, thank you. - Yeah. I had no idea there was this side to you. It's something that doesn't come up in my day job, right? So... - No, I had fun. - Well, thank you. Okay, um, well, it is getting late tonight. I should probably head back. Yes, and I... you know, they're loading up, so I just need to help the fellows load up. - Yeah. Sure. - So... see you around. - Yeah. Sure. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Take it easy. - You too. Good night. Bye. Keyboards. Ozzie? I thought maybe you'd like to see this. What's this? I couldn't stop thinking about that day in Beacon, and when you mentioned the alien therapy thing, I remembered you started drawing these right after you got lost. I drew this? And about 500 others. There's another shoe box full in the bedroom. You called it "Snake Man and Little Guy." And you didn't think this was weird? It creeped me out at the time. I wanted to take you to therapy, but your father said it was... quote, "white people shit." I still think it is. No offense. We just felt you needed to see these... after what you told us. I appreciate that. I thought I had an answer, and now I have more questions. You know, Nancy seemed pretty shaken up. I'm gonna go check on her. Sorry, Gina. I just... Okay, um, maybe that's a good stopping place. Ennis, can we use the barn next week? No. The barn's booked for a wedding. Yeah, can I say something? We should take a break. What do you mean? I mean... - what is that? - Calista, shut up. Look around. You know, we're half gone. We're in a barn. Seems like we're just forcing it. It doesn't really feel like group anymore. Doesn't. And I know what groups feel like. I'm in a lot of groups. I'm in... I'm in, the Knitting Circle, and then Let's Take a Hike With Seniors and Death Talk Cafe... Okay! Okay, okay. Okay, cool. Okay, cool. Great. So, our next meeting is TBD. Or how about not at all? How about that? - No. No, that's extreme. - No, no. Is it? Is that extreme, Margaret? Well, how's... how's this for extreme, okay? Holding this entire group... on my shoulders for all of this time, okay? Holding... trying to find places to meet... and trying to help people... and giving and giving and giving... and giving and giving and giving and giving... until there is nothing left of the giving tree! Do you know what happens then? It dies! And everybody sits around on the stump of the tree! Good! Why don't you just have your meetings... You know what? Maybe I need a break. Aah, it! It's TBD! - Shh. - What? You're gonna wake up Ozzie. This just gets weirder and weirder. - Empathize... - With this. Oh! Everybody I never wanted to see again, all in one room. So, tell me why we're here again? Um... Uh... Right. 'Cause the dream never dies. Well, uh... uh, nerds are supposed to be cool now, right? Yeah. Yeah, maybe, you know. Let's see if we're grandfathered in. Yeah. Oops. Sorry. Come on, man, aren't we a little too old for that now? Too old for what... exactly? Um... too old to fall back on an outdated social hierarchy that penalizes achievement and rewards mediocrity. Oh. That sounded like an insult. I think. Um... Whoa, it's... No, don't. Don't. ...my life coach, so... Okay. Ooh. Come on. Wow. Looks like it's just me and you. * It's the same as the emotion... * Yeah, you know. That and your teensy, weensy, little... * Give me your heart, make it real or else... * Hey, so what'd you end up doing after high school? I joined Special Forces. Got my CPA degree off the GI Bill. You should check it out. I'm gonna kick your ass. Yeah, good luck with that. Um... you meant today, right? Whoa. No. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. Oh. Somebody call 911! Call 911! Oh. What's Torres doing here? I don't know. He and Quinn don't officially start till Monday. Hey, Torres. Hey, what's up? Hey, you know, uh... you know it's Friday night, right? - Yeah, I know. Just not really sure how this whole desk thing works, so, uh... figured I'd drop off a few things early. Starting with a picture of yourself. Yeah. It's a reminder. Of...? Something I like to be reminded of. Hmm. Okay, we got to go. Talk to you Monday. Oh, you guys are... late to spinning class or something? Uh, no, Gibbs is famous for coming in just before the weekend starts and saying... Grab your gear. That a well-timed illustration, boss? Got a death at Quantico. Okay. - Are you coming? I'm not much of a varsity letters guy. - James Bruno. Graduated Puller High 15 years ago. Barely, from what I hear. His father was stationed at the motor pool on base. - So, what do you think? Involuntary manslaughter? Yeah. Maybe. Jethro Gibbs doesn't like to commit. That's why it's the perfect job for him. Thanks for calling me. I'm ready to get started. Get started. Okay. All right, what did I miss? Your jacket. Okay. Oh, I don't know, he looks fine. Just fine. Who is he? Oh, that's Agent Torres. Oh, that's great. Who are you? A-Agent Quinn. I swear, I barely touched him. I mean, I just did a controlled throw so that he would think twice about touching me. So, what started the fight? Nothing. He's just that kind of guy. He's just always starting something. When was the last time you saw him? Uh, I haven't seen him since high school. 15 years. Looks like nothing's changed. The teenage years are fraught with peril. The frontal cortex is responsible for self-regulation. It develops gradually over adolescence. Unfortunately, in some adults, well, it never occurs. You aren't talking about anyone in particular, are you, Doctor? 'Cause I was only popping that bubble wrap to see if it was still... The victim, Mr. Palmer. I was referring to the victim. - What about him? Well, I don't see anything obvious, but this hypersalivation suggests there's some sort of poison at work. Boss, we got a problem. What do you got, McGee? Talked to one of the eyewitnesses. They saw Bruno arrive early, put something in one of these lockers and it wasn't a math book. Stand clear. - Yeah. I think this guy had issues. So, this button moves forward; this one moves backwards, and this is the "Oops, How Did That Get There?" button. The what? We push it when Gibbs asks for the impossible to distract him. I-It's preloaded with pictures of his ex-wives or Jimmy Palmer making turducken, stuff like that. And you think he doesn't know what you're doing? He's good. He's not that good. All right, Jim Bruno. Let's go. - Jim Bruno, born James. Left home after high school, never came back. Yeah, he got a job teaching shop at a community college. Ended after a burglary conviction. Wrong button. Oops. - Bruno's never paid taxes, never voted, and has no recent home address we can find. Yeah, your doc confirms that he was poisoned to death. Are we sure the explosive was his? We are now. A base surveillance camera shows him assembling a bomb in his car. Bomb squad's sending it to Abby. Said there's enough explosives in there to level the gym. Bruno would've ended up killing his entire high school graduating class. McGee and Quinn. High school records. On it. Bishop and Torres, go talk to his teachers. See who remembers him. Uh... Yeah? What desk should I be at? - Right here. My old desk. Putting baby in the corner? That's where you sat when you were a probie. Since when do you sit down? Oh. Uh... There's five of us here now. Gonna have to... rearrange some stuff. You try to do what you can for these kids, be sensitive to their needs but some of them are just, well, beyond reach, you know? Hey! Hey! Don't just pull the poster down! Take the tape off the wall! Idiots. Sorry, where were we? You were just telling us how sensitive you can be. Hey, I did what I could for that kid. His senior year, I spent eight weekends in a row in Saturday detention with him, trying to whip him into shape. Nothing took. Always causing a ruckus. Recent contact? No... but it's a tight community. I heard a rumor he was renting a room from an old substitute teacher. Do you think he was targeting anyone in particular? Take your pick. That punk had problems with everyone in the school. How many had problems with him? What, you're looking for a list or something? His death wasn't accidental. He was poisoned. Well, then you got your work cut out for you. Everyone had problems with that kid. Abbs, McGee said you had something for me. Yup. Yup, I do. Yeah. Behind your back. No... no, this is some... it's nothing. It's just... Well, it's my... it's my high school yearbook. I thought I would, you know, get in the mood for the case. It's a very bad move. I don't want to talk about it. Works for me. It's just that... high school, you know? It's where I found my... I don't know, style? And realized my obsession with blood-spatter patterns. Speaking of which... It just wasn't a great combo for making friends and influencing people. I had a lot of, um, alone time in high school, but... let's just leave it at that 'cause I said I didn't want to talk about it, remember? Yes. Okay. Good. On to happier subjects. This is the explosive device that Bruno was going to use to commit mass murder. It has a wireless receiver and it was built from a toy remote-control car kit. Can you trace it? Hopefully or eventually. Don't be so impatient. How close did Bruno need to get to trigger the explosive? Well, it's a long-range transmitter, so he wasn't, like, suicidal, if that's what you're thinking. As a matter of fact, he was trying to quit smoking and that is what actually killed him. The killer spiked his nicotine patch with a cyanide analogue about 20 minutes before he put it on, according to the adhesive oxidation. That rules out everyone at the reunion. I know. Ducky said that Bruno was already wearing the patch when he got there. That's good news. 'Cause it narrows down our suspect list. Yeah. To zero. If I never see a retired substitute teacher again, it'll be too soon. How many are left? Well, five down, six to go. Quinn's got another five. Ma'am, hello. NCIS. I'm, uh, Special Agent Timothy McGee and this is Special Agent Bishop here. Hi, there. Uh, are you currently renting a room to this man? Aren't you two cute. I'll take two boxes of Skinny Mints and two boxes of Peanut Butteries. - My apologies. I don't see so well these days. I could've sworn you said you were selling cookies. Wishful thinking, I guess. I do love Skinny Mints. Mmm, I do, too. So how long has Bruno been living here? Several years now, poor thing. Would you like some coffee? Uh, no, thanks, I'm okay, ma'am. Heard on the radio what happened. Don't buy a word of it. - Really? Why not? James Bruno was such a nice boy. Always paid his rent on time. Wouldn't hurt a fly. Cream? Uh, no, ma'am, I actually said I didn't want coffee. Cream it is. - Uh... did you know that he had a criminal record? I'm blind, honey, not an idiot. I did my background check before I rented the room. Which is back this way, if you want to see it. I didn't learn anything I didn't know already, though. I remember that boy from high school. We heard he was trouble back then. Oh, he was. Everyone hated him. But then he changed senior year. Out of the blue, he started dating one of the most popular girls in class. It was the darndest thing. She turned that boy's whole life around. And his attitude. He ended up being quite well-liked. Here you go. You got a key? No. I don't go in there. He likes his privacy. Boys and their boy antics. What a tragic ending. But I don't believe for a second he's capable of murder. I can't imagine why anyone he went to school with would want to kill him. Or why anyone would at all, for that matter. Know what I mean? All right. He was a good kid. - Not that good. - Look at this, iPads, jewelry, paintings. - Oh, where he get all that stuff? - Good question. Okay, people, we have fine art on table A. Electronics on table B. Jewelry and household goods, tables C... There's a lot of stuff here, how much do you think this is all worth? All these wonderful prizes are worth tens of thousands of dollars and they can all be yours, Timothy McGee, if you can answer the NCIS bonus question. Where'd it come from? Actually, boss, I can answer that. Burglaries. All over the city. Torres dug up this report. Metro PD's been tracking a citywide theft ring for over half a decade. - This is all they got? Yup. Clearly Bruno didn't do all this himself, but Metro never generated a single lead on whoever was involved. - Well, I have one. Not to brag. All the fingerprints that I found in the room belonged to Bruno. But I also found this, which did not, according to Ducky. Bruno had a visitor with a really bad case of pityriasis capitis. AKA dandruff. Left flakes everywhere. Like snow. That teacher see anyone? I don't think she's seen anyone since the '90s, boss. She did say Bruno would have an occasional visitor. Said it was, "A man or maybe a woman, I think." Whoever they are, I'll bet you dollars to donuts that they are gonna be coming back for this stuff. Take Quinn, McGee, eyes on that house 24/7. Abbs? Don't even think about it. - So how long has it been since you've been on stakeout? - It's been a while. But I-I'm good to go. I taught yearly seminars on it. Oh, I... I remember. Oh, that's right. I did forgot one crucial element. What's that? Hydration is your enemy. Ah, yeah. Well... Men's room. Ladies' room. No. I am not at DEFCON 1 yet. But you will be the first to know. You will be the one with the bag on your head. - What is she doing? We told her to stay in the house. Well, we told her to do what she normally does, so... Does she normally water the bird feeder? - Aw, be nice. She's a lonely old lady. Which reminds me, Bishop told me you're going to propose to your girlfriend. Congrats. Thanks. Tho... uh, those two things reminded you of each other? Oh. When are you gonna pop the question? When it's time. And when is that time? I don't know. I'm not exactly sure yet. I know I'm just gonna feel it out and... you know, I... I think... I'll just know, you know? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Right. No. I'll know that it's time when it's time. When might that be? I... Ooh, I see something. Yeah, it was really good chatting. Oh, yeah. Ooh, I got to go. - She won't tell us who she is. - Yeah, still no hits on her prints. Abby confirmed that it's her dandruff in our dead guy's room. Any I.D.? Only thing she had on her was her purse. - Yeah, and I have been to drug-lord torture rooms less scary. Me? Oh. Yup. What's your name? Okay. Where do you live? Okay. What were you doing in Jimmy Bruno's house? All right, we can sit here all day doing this... Hey. Are you hungry? Yeah? Here you go. Hey. How's the interrogation going? Well, just as you thought. Gibbs is slow walking it. Seeing if Torres will pick up the pace. Hmm, how's he doing? Well, he interrupted Gibbs. Took me four years before I got up the nerve to do that. Thank you. But he's got her talking. - Don't thank me too fast. We're about to charge you with murder. Bruno was my friend, I would never hurt him. Okay, well, then help us find out who did. I don't know anything. Did you know your friend tried to murder 50 people? - And maybe you were planning it with him. No! Hey! - Then why were you running? I wasn't. Really? Sardines, underwear? Looks like you were planning a trip somewhere. Or, you know what? I don't even want to imagine what else. Let's just go with running. You're wrong. That bomb couldn't have been Bruno's. He wouldn't do something like that. His fingerprints were all over it. Then you made a mistake! He's a thief, but not a killer. So you do know something. You're a thief, too, huh? Well, somebody's going down for Bruno's murder and guess who the Wheel of Misfortune just stopped on? I helped Bruno sell some stuff, that's all. It's none of my business where he got it. How long you been fencing for him? We have video of your friend building that bomb. He's not who you think he is. No, he's not who you think he is. You... you see him as you want to see him. He's got a lot of bark, yeah, but no bite. If he really did plant that bomb, then someone made him do it. He was tricked or something. And while you're wasting time in here with me, whoever manipulated him could be out there trying again. Did you ever think about that? - In some ways, Bruno, I envy you. When I was a child, I often fancied living the life of a daring cat burglar. Fortunately for me, yeah, at age of nine, on my maiden voyage, I fell off our neighbor's roof, yeah. Landed on my coccyx. And that was the end of that. You're lucky it ended so quickly. One time when I was in high school, I spent a night in jail for... Uh, for... Never mind. For what exactly, Mr. Palmer? Just-- it's funny, I-I said the word "jail." I meant to say, um... Vail. Yeah, I was-I was a big skier in high school. Were you now? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I loved the-I loved the, uh, snow. I loved-I loved, uh, skiing and-and... What I'd do is I'd- - Vail! You look like a man on a mission. Got an alibi for the murder. She was nowhere near Bruno when he was poisoned. Oh, and so it goes. Got us to thinking, maybe there's a second bomber. We could use a lead. Well, let's see what we can come up with. This man has told me quite a bit about himself. Starting with these burns. They're quite old, probably inflicted when he was a teenager. Military records indicate that his father died of lung cancer, excessive cigar smoking. Yeah, so we can put two and two together. He had a rough childhood. And also a rough week. Well, yeah. He's dead. Yes, but days before that, he was in a fight where he suffered severe body blows. If you look carefully, you can make out the imprint of a fist. Well, his knuckles don't look too bad. Yes, well, oddly enough, he didn't seem to fight back. Even more odd was the fact that we removed a diamond earring from this lobe. Well, men are piercing their ears now, Duck. Yes, but I'm referring to the fact that the hole was closed up from disuse. Yet he forced the earring in anyway. Ugh... That must've hurt like a mother. I'm sure it has some... psychological significance, but I'm not sure what. However, Abby came up with a second set of DNA on the earring. So, I imagine you'll find out soon enough. Well, is that a good enough lead for you? Hey, so, you're the world-famous Abby Sciuto I keep hearing so much about. Oh, well, guess we can skip the "I thought you'd be taller" part. I'm Agent Quinn. For what's it worth, I thought you would be exactly five feet, six inches. I made a 3D avatar of you, using NCIS security camera footage. And the hairs slowly went up on Agent Quinn's neck. Oh, no, no! I just... I needed to know your sizes, because... I'm knitting you a "Welcome to NCIS" sweater. Oh! But until it's done, welcome... to NCIS. Well, thank you very much. Do you want a tour? I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to... He wants to find out where the earring came from. Of course he does. Well, right now, all I can tell you is that the prior owner was a female. Okay, so do you know how long Bruno had it in his ear? I have been waiting for someone to ask me that. The impurities in the gold caused our victim's skin oil to oxidize. And by measuring that amount, I could determine that he forced the stud through his ear, like, right before he went into the reunion. To kill 50 people. Then was poisoned to death. Okay, so whoever owns the stud, maybe she knows something. Well, I'm running the DNA through CODIS right now. But I've also been looking at this, trying to find pictures of women. I found this in a trench coat in Bruno's closet. Unfortunately... no women yet. Huh. Are these the homes that he robbed? Yeah. Looks like he was casing them for a few days. There's also a few pictures of his feet... and some pictures of some other people that I haven't identified yet. Ho-Hold up. Go back one. That's Neal Sherwood. You know him? Well, he was at the reunion, and he had a fight with the victim right before he died. Well, that's important. Uh, yeah, because Neal said they hadn't seen each other in 15 years. Oh. Where is he? - With his suitcase, wherever that is. Neighbors said he split right after the reunion. - Left in a hurry. He's running. Quinn, BOLO. McGee, freeway cams and credit cards. Find him. - We found something. Abby got a hit on the DNA from the earring Bruno was wearing. - Katrina Cooper. A high school classmate of Bruno's. Former prom queen, married the school jock, active social life. How did Bruno get her earring? Could've stolen it, but if he did, she never reported it. They have any recent contact? No. No calls, no texts, no Snapchat doggie faces. The only connection we could find was from high school. They had a Saturday detention together, once. 15 years ago? Thin, I know. Talk to her. Find out why her DNA was in our dead guy's ear. Round two, everybody! We got soccer meatballs, lacrosse stick hot dogs... and pigskin pizza pockets. Who's hungry? - Mmm. I am. Hi. You must be here for Katrina. Why would you say that? That's what happens when you marry the most popular girl in town. Everybody's here for Katrina. Hmm. She's over there, in the huddle. They're like... little footballs. - And I told the guy, "Give me Louis Vuitton, or give me death." I got this. Okay. Um, Katrina Cooper? How you guys doing? You guys have fun? NCIS Special Agent Torres, Bishop. Hi. Can we have a word with you? Of course. Let's not disturb the party, shall we? Excuse me. Let's not do that. They're little footballs. They're good. - And how can I help you? Do you know this guy? Mm, no. Am I supposed to? Well, you guys went to high school together. Oh, in fact, he actually died in front of you. At your high school reunion, two days ago? Interestingly enough, wearing one of your earrings. It was stolen. Oh. You didn't report it stolen. I am now. You know, I bet you and me had something in common in high school. I don't think so. We both liked bad boys. The badder the better, except, I grew out of it. I don't think you did. Your husband know that you and Bruno have been sleeping together? Excuse me? What I'm wondering... is if you knew how bad Bruno really was. - You know, if he told you about, for the last several years, he's been robbing people in the city. Yeah, I think it's time for you to go. Cheers. Have one more question... No. No, no, no more questions. I don't know anything about any robberies, I'm not cheating on my husband and I have no idea where Neal Sherwood is. Okay? Well, that was actually my next question, which... I haven't asked yet. Oh, right. Hmm. Where is he? Get down! Found him. The cops are outside right now. It's over. To be honest, it's kind of a relief. I am willing to set the record straight, but I cannot go to prison. I just can't. I can't have it, my family... can't have it. So... I'm sorry. Shot himself with a flare gun. That's a new one. Did I miss the part where he set the record straight? Maybe it's on the laptop? Go-Go Abby fingers. Hey, so, um... You, um... liked bad boys in school, huh? I'm sorry, I just... I just painted for you for more of a goody two-shoes, uh, prom queen type. Actually, I... was the prom queen. Wow. So you played us both. Nice. Except, I was voted in as a joke. Kind of like Carrie, but... without the blood. Bishop, that's like... the worst thing I've ever heard. Yeah, I didn't have any friends in high school, I was too... me, I guess. I got something. Okay, it's a text document. Neal made it right before he shot himself. Looks like some kind of confession. It's even double-spaced and everything. - What exactly is he confessing to? - According to Neal, he and his high school friends are the ones behind Metro's theft ring. With each friend playing a very specific role. Adam Cooper, former jock, ended up running a sports betting company. That's where he would identify the wealthy marks. - Katrina Cooper, his prom queen wife, would flirt her way into the homes to get info on their security systems. Bad boy would do the actual robberies, and this woman, who we've now identified as former classmate, Angela Russell, would fence the stolen goods on the street where she lived. Finally, there's Neal Sherwood, the accountant. And he laundered the money. Yep. According to Neal, they came up with the idea to start a robbery gang back in school, after they met at a Saturday detention. - He said they talked about it as a joke at first, as a way to "get back" at their parents. Eventually they realized, if they pooled their talents, they could make some real money. - All of this seems very familiar. - Yeah... Yeah, I'm v-very interested in this case, here. We got five different high school kids from varied social backgrounds all coming together on their Saturdays, for detention. You know, it kind of reminds me of, uh... You've... You don't... Not important. Sorry. Anyway, the different social groups was part of the reason Metro was never able to crack the burglary ring. They were never able to find a connection between the players. Congratulations, we just solved Metro's case. What about our own? We have no clue who killed our victim! Actually, not true. The prom queen ain't talking, but the fence is. She thinks she knows who killed Bruno. Two days ago, your wife gave Bruno that earring. I don't believe you. Welcome to the club. You were the only one not at the reunion. You were the only one that had the opportunity to poison Bruno. Prosecutor's gonna file charges today, unless you have something to tell us. This isn't where I imagined I'd be after high school. Ah. Welcome to the club. I wanted to be a pro football player. You? Painter. Really. Really? Yeah. Really. Painter. Loved to paint. Watercolors, mostly. I took every art class that school had. Water colors? It's hard to imagine a grown man... So what happened? Life. Life. I paint with wood. It's close enough. Not for me. I suspected Katrina and Bruno had started up again, but I didn't want to believe it. But if she really gave him her earring it's game over for us. It's worse than that. I think that witch tried to kill me. The last house we knocked over, Bruno snagged a painting worth over a million bucks. My wife kept joking we should take out our partners, keep the money for ourselves. Said we should bomb the reunion, and make it look like a terrorist attack. I honestly thought she was joking. She must've talked Bruno into it. He was always a sucker for her. No way he would come up with something like that on his own. Hell, he was even gonna pretend to let Neal kick the crap out of him at the reunion as a goof, to impress some girls. Bruno was bad on the outside, but good on the inside. My wife? The opposite. What about you? All I can say is I'm not a murderer. I didn't kill Bruno, and I wasn't anywhere near him when he was poisoned. Hypothetically speaking, how would you feel about a betting pool on whether his alibi checks out? Hypothetically? How'd Ducky bet? Guilty. How'd you bet? I'm not a gambling man. And I have no idea. - I mean, who are these people? Living double lives like this? I mean, yeah, I mean, I... I lived as someone else, for the most of the last decade, but... I had an excuse, I was, uh... I was undercover. Which version is the real them? Which version is the real you? You're looking at it. Am I? You created all those covers. It wasn't random. Wait, you're saying that a part of me wanted to be a, uh, mafia-tied, vegan juice-bar owner? Eh... You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? You tried to kill us all! Oh, could everyone just please stop fighting? Shove a Pixy Stix up your nose! - McGee is taking them to Metro not a moment too soon. And Miss Congeniality treated psychotics before, and people with the right combination of chemical imbalance and psychological damage that can't be reached. You think that's me? You think I can't get better? You? You kidding me? You're hopeless. Everybody can get better, Tate. Everybody. I just think you're scared. Of what, I'm not sure yet. Maybe rejection. Certainly because of what your father did to you. I was afraid my big dick wouldn't work. What? Yeah, that's why I didn't take the meds. Tate. I was afraid my dick wouldn't work. Because I met someone. This one I did after my dad left. I was ten, I think. Last week, first day at my new school... sucks. Westfield, right? The worst. I got thrown out of there. I hate it here. I hate everyone. All there bourgeoisy designer bullshit. East Coast was much cooler. I mean, at least we had weather. I love it when the leaves change. Yeah, me, too. Why did you move here? My dad had an affair. My mom literally caught him in the act. That's horrible. If you love someone, you should never hurt them... never. Right? I know. And the worst part is that six months earlier, my mom had, like, this brutal miscarriage. The baby was seven months old, and we had to have this macabre funeral. Have you ever seen a baby coffin? # You have to get back in the saddle # # It's a special death, you say # I'm sorry. # And me, the brown-eyed daughter # Why are you seeing my dad? Don't ask questions you already know the answer to. You're smarter than that. Want to listen to Morrissey? He's cool and he's pissy and he hates everyone and everything. Got any Kurt Cobain on that thing? What are you doing in here? Just listening to music, Dad. You need to leave, Tate. I'm sorry. He shouldn't be in here, and I think you know that... please. What's that thing you think I'm afraid of? Fear of rejection? Stay away from him. Dad, nothing... You heard me! No! Bullet, bullet, bullet! Hey, babe, you seen my razor blades? Your family is in danger. What are you doing? Why are you in my house? ! I want you to stay out of my house. Do you understand? Can I smoke in here? No. Adelaide, answer me, please. Can I pet your dog? No, Adelaide, I want you to stay out of the house. I want you to stop coming in and opening things up and telling me that I'm going to die. She said that? She says that to everybody. Say you're sorry, Addy. No, they did it. Who did it? The twins. Shh. Can I... pet your dog? No, Adelaide, listen to me. I want you to stop coming in here without permission. Am I clear? Vivien. Am I clear? Yes. Thank you. Time to go, Addy. Hallie! Are you okay? She shouldn't have done that. Sorry about all this. You touch my kid one more time and I will break your goddamn arm. No! I have no evidence of any past violence. No, I don't have his social. Listen, do not transfer me again. I'm trying to report a patient of high school age, that I believe could be dangerous. Yes. Yes, I'll hold. Unbelievable. May I clean in here? It's not a good time, Moira. It's Thursday. I get off in 20 minutes. If I don't do it now, it's not getting done until Monday. Am I distracting you? Why don't you touch me a little? Get out. What are you afraid of? Your wife's not home. She's probably at Pilates. I won't tell. Oh, God. I didn't tell when you saw me playing with myself the other day. Please, just go. Did you touch yourself after? Please just go. You did. Do it again. Show me. Oh, shit. Violet! Violet! Damn it! I'm not scared of you! Should be! Fight, fight, fight! Oh, she friggin' burned me! In my professional opinion, whoever painted this wall had some deep psychological issues. I thought you had a patient. Ah, they bailed. You want some help cleaning up? Yeah. Thanks. This thing doesn't tweak you out? There's something about it that I find... really comforting. One of my psych professors told me that people tell stories to cope with their fears. All art and myths are just creations to give us some sense of control over the things we're scared of. Afraid of dying, create reincarnation. Afraid of evil, create a benevolent God who sends evildoers to Hell. I think I just like that I don't have to think while I do it. Okay. I always thought you were prettiest like this. No makeup. Messy hair. A little sweaty. I'm old. Stop. You're beautiful. You are. No. Ben... Violet won't be home for an hour. No. Okay, Ben? No. Come on, babe. Ben... No. Sorry. Just no. How long, Viv? How long are you going to punish me for? I'm not punishing you, you narcissistic asshole! I'm trying to figure out how to forgive you for having sex with one of your students. You want me to have sex with you? I can't even look at your face, Ben, without seeing the expression on it while you were pile-driving her in our bed! I screwed up! How many times do I have to say it? I'm sorry! I was hurting, too. Oh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did, did the, did the life that was growing inside you die? And did you have to carry that around in your belly? The dead corpse of our baby son? Did you have to go into labor, and deliver our child? Dead? My son died too! My baby died, too! And you buried your sorrow in some 21-year-old's pussy. You know, I could show you statistics on how many men cheat after a miscarriage. I was there for you, Viv. I was patient, and understanding, and caring... and I put your feelings first. My hero. You know, I don't even know how to say this without coming off like an asshole, I really don't. You know what? Just go ahead. Really. Never stopped you before. You're so angry, why don't you really tell it like it is? Six months of therapy with you apologizing, and crying, was bullshit. So, please, tell me how you really feel. You got a dog. I needed you, and you got a dog. Oh...! It was me you should have been curling up with at night! Not a dog! Oh, so... I needed you! You needed me? So she was revenge, because you needed me, because I wasn't there for you in your time of need? Now I get it! We haven't had sex in almost a year. Yeah... you think I don't know that? October 20th. We had great sex, babe. It was loving and sexy and personal, and even a little, even a little weird. I love you. I moved across country for you. Because, in all my life, the only thing I've been truly scared of is losing you; Losing this family. Something horrible happened to us. And we handled it even more horribly. But this... this place... is our second chance, babe. It's our second chance. But I just... I just need to know that you want it, too. Tell me, honey. What are you doing? Viv... What are you doing? Oh! We're going to be happy here. Here you go, Hallie. Good girl. Hey. Whoa. Come here. What happened to your face? Fell down. Come here. Sit, sit, sit. Boy or girl? Girls. Three of them. Hope they look worse than you do. You know their names? I'm not narking. You know, we can easily move you to a different school. There are a lot of really good private schools right in this neighborhood. I'm not running away. I'm not scared of them. Not afraid of anything. It's like that time in kindergarten, when you insisted that I bring you home from the slumber party 'cause all the other girls were sleeping with the nightlight on. I know you've gotten the short end of the stick, lately. This move, and your dad and I haven't exactly been great to be around. Why don't you guys get divorced, if you're so miserable? We still love each other. You could've fooled me. I thought you hated each other. Well, at least you hated him. I don't blame you. He was a shithead. Sorry. It's okay. He was a shithead. You know, we got a lot of history. Your dad's been through a lot, I've been through a lot. Guess we need each other. What are you scared of? You said I'm not scared of anything, so... what scares you? Lately? Everything. Life will do that to you. I hate her! I just want to kill her! Then do it! One less high school bitch making the lives of the less fortunate more tolerable is, in my opinion, a public service. Look, you want her to leave you alone? Stop making your life a living hell? Short of killing her, there's only one solution. Scare her. Make her afraid of you. It's the only thing bullies react to. How? It's simple. You simply walk up to her and say, Here's the deal: I need you to stop harassing me. I got what you want. Drugs. Come to my house tomorrow for your free sample. I'm a dealer, and a good one. I got the best shit in town. She's a cokehead. I don't have coke. You won't need any. It's just an excuse to get her here. After that, she'll leave empty-handed and terrified. And I promise you, you'll never be bothered by her again. How am I going to terrify her? Helter-skelter! That's where I come in. Hot. I thought I told you to throw that thing away. Oh, you're not talking? Well, I'll give you points for creativity. We were pretty hot this afternoon. You really want to go for round two, huh? Come on. I can be kinky. Now is not your time. Enjoy the house. Go back to bed. I love you. I love you, too. What's down there? My stash. Parents toss my room every week. If you're screwing with me... It's just the basement. I found the best hiding place. This is great shit, too. All the coke coming to the U.S. from Central America smuggled in on lobster boats in Gloucester. I used to show my boobs to the lobstermen in return for a key or two before they cut it. So where is it? Right around the corner. To the right. This place is a dump. Oh, shut up. I want my goddamn drugs. Then keep going. So this is the coke whore. Who the hell are you? Get the lights. What is going on? ! What is going on? ! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off me! Get off me! Stop! Stop! Please, stop! Mommy...? Will you wait? ! I don't think she'll be bothering you anymore. What was that? ! What are you talking about? She hit me in the balls and got away. She must have run into a wall or something. No, I saw something! What are you talk...? Violet, you're talking crazy. This is cool. We showed that bitch. Damn! I never want to see you again! I thought you weren't afraid of anything! Who are you and why are you following me? ! Your family is in danger! What happened to you? Pretty, aren't I? It's over 70% of my body. I'm Larry Harvey. And you have to get out of that house. I could have you arrested, you know. Peeking in people's windows is still a crime. Even in L.A. They're not gonna put me back into jail. I have brain cancer. Terminal, inoperable. I'm sorry. Don't be. That's the only reason they let me out. Homicide. Triple homicide. I was in that house for six months before I started hearing voices. My wife thought I was working too hard. My daughter Angie was six. The older one, Margaret, was ten. She looked like her mother. That's funny how it skips a generation like that. I killed them... all. Lorraine was ill that night. She took a pill. She went to bed early, my wife. And then I, uh, I put the girls down, and then the voices started. They told me what to do. I was like... an obedient child. I... I don't know how I put myself out. I remember that night... but it's like a dream. Have you been sleepwalking? Yeah... Look at my case. Read the transcript. Listen to me, I'm a doctor. They may not put you back in jail, but I can certainly have you committed to a state mental institution. And trust me, those places make prison look like Club Med. Leave my family alone! Do you hear me? Please, please, please, you have to get out of there! That place is evil. Get off of me! Leave us alone! Leave us alone! Put those earrings back. Jesus H. Christ. You almost gave me a heart attack. Those belonged to madam. This is her house, not yours. Why is it that it is always the old whore who acts the part of a moralistic prude? I'd be nervous if I were you, too. When things go missing, they always blame the new maid. I'd move if I were you. Don't make me kill you again. Hey. Hey. What do you want for dinner? Whatever you want. I think I want Indian food. You only like Indian food when you're pregnant. Really? Mm. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh...! And I got a gun! Previously on How To Make It In America I had this sick idea last night that I wanted to pitch you... Crisp by Yosi What is this rumor about Rasta Monsta being a front for weed spray? I'm not a drug front, Steve. - You pitched me a story. - Yeah. I said no and then you went ahead and wrote it anyway. I'm not sure this is gonna work out. We need to find a new manufacturer immediately. You got that kind of money for production? - What is that? - I got that from Domingo. Who the fuck is Domingo? !

Yosi: Enzo, redo the samples the way we discussed or I will personally stuff you in a box and send you back to Rome in a slow boat. Go, "andiamo". - ( Ben sighs ) - ( Laughs ) Hello. So did anybody offer you something to drink? Ah, good. Okay. Sit sit. Uh, wh-where's Cam? Uh, well, Cam wasn't feeling too well. I'm sorry to hear that, but you talked to him, right?

I thought I was gonna take care of the whole thing and I didn't wanna both you with it. Well, you didn't take care of it, so now I gotta teach your boy Domingo a lesson. No no! Please. Not necessary. - We're good. - We are? You took all those tinctures off the street? Not... not exactly. I was trying to get rid of 'em, but then we got robbed by the East Flatbush Caribbean League. They said that you gotta talk to them or they'll show the bottles to the police. - I' fix it! I promise! - You can't fix shit! Stay out of it! ( Punches thudding ) Throw at the dragon, you gotta come on, cause I'm too da nice, Don! - You know that - ( Shouts ) So Jason and Noah said they got three tables for me and what I need from you is to invite every hot girl that you know. I'll see what I can do. You ever see that movie, "The 25th hour"? Ed Norton is doing like seven years. - You're doing 40 days. - 53. I was thinki, man, the email we u it could be schmaltzy. You know? "Ben Epstein and Cam Calderon cordially invite you to say farewell to their good friend David Kaplan." Yeah, that ain't gonna happen, man I don't think Cam wants his name next to mine on anything foa minute. Uh-oh, a little seven-year itch? ( Sighs ) Well, you know, we're having some issues with our partner, but the money is, like, really good. Fuck, man, money... Right, yeah, it matters, but it's only one piece of the puzzle. Let me tell you something: Sometimes who you're doing business with is a lot more important than the business that you're doing. ( Bell rings ) - Hi. - Hey, can I help you? Yeah, I'm just... I'm here to see Edie. Is that my former ir apparent who threw it all away to go back DJ in Ibiza? ( Snickers ) I haven't even been to Ibiza, Edie.

You are a beautiful, intelligent woman in the prime of your life in the greatest city on Earth. You can do anything you want, you always could. I was lucky to have you when I did. Can I have my old job back, Edie? No! ( Laughs ) You quit on me and I find somebody younger And I pay her half as much as I paid you, so. - ( Soing ) - Oh, honeybun. This is not what you want. You need to go out there, find your passion and move forward with life. - I don't know if I can do that. - Of course you can. - Try. - Well, it was pretty inspiring out in Bushwick - with the Neanderthals. - Mm-hmm. Try harder. And then for a boy, I like Aidan or Logan. What? It's very popular. Where? In Minneapolis, Minnesota?

Actually it was all me and my friends, so we came here to take full responsibility and work this out with you personally. Hey, man, nice to see you again. Look, I don't care if it was all your doing or not. Rasta Monsta is Rene's company.

( Phone ringing ) - Yeah. - Yosi: It's tomorrow in China. - You have something for me? - On my way. ( Beeps ) Morning. Okay, all right. So I thought a lot about what we said... The serpent, the old English look, the whole thing, right? And... What the fuck is this? This is our new design. It's sick, right? It's just what we talked about, except that I put a two-headed snake there. Do you like that? What happened to Crisp? Well, Cam had some issues with Crisp by Yosi. Then talk him out of them. You're supposed to be the smart one. No, but "crunch" is dope. "Crisp" is a better name. And I know you agree, otherwise you wouldn't be in here trying to keep it for yourself. - ( Sighs ) - Look, would you feel better if I wrote you another advance check for, say, $200,000? You have talent, Ben, but no idea how tough this business is. I can make your life very easy if you let me. I'm sorry. You know, I treat people I do business with very differently from people that I don't. Okay. So... Now at we don't have business, there is a personal matter that I would like to settle with you. There is? Are you really surprised right now? - What? - You didn't think I would find out, doing it right under my nose when I trusted you? Come on, man, what kind of person are you? Yosi, I'm sorry, okay? I got caught up, but it didn't mean anything. She still loves you. I know it. What the fuck are you talking about? W-what the fuck are you talking about? I have cameras. You kept Enzo here all nit. Trying to steal my talent? Everything Enzo does belongs to me. What the fuck are you talking about? Nothing. I... I was talking about Enzo too. Sorry. Did something happen between you and Nancy? Yosi, I totally understand if you just wanna hit me in the face right now. Just go. ( Grunts ) ( Music playing ) ( Man vocalizing ) ( Boat whistle toots ) So how do you wanna play this? I want those little bottles. Yeah well, I want my intern, Malik. Oh, I'm sure you do. Horse. You know what? Rene, I think we should just squash this thing. You know, I was thinking about doing the same thing when I went over to your house, 4:00 in the morning. Right, Malik? When I went over to the house. What the hell was Malik doing at Everton's crib at 4:00 in the morning? The East Flatbush Caribbean League would be happy to welcome Rasta Monsta into our neighborhood. I'm not worried about your neighborhood. I'm worried about vert. Vert America will never hear another word from us. That is, if you... ( Softly ) ... Keep your mouth shut about Malik. I'm not gonna say nothing, but you gotta let go of this, bro. You gotta be proud of who you are. You can't be so angry. Love will change your life if you let it. It just happened to me. Brother Rene here done gone Dr. Phil on us, y'all. ( Chuckles ) Okay. No. Come on, man. We're good? Everton: We' good. All right. Hey, listen. You know, uh, in addition to running The East Flatbush Caribbean League, I also have a little management company. I just handle just a couple of artists. Horse is one of 'em.

Yeah, I really don't care. I'm sorry. Can you give me a couple of minutes? - What's your fucking problem? - What the fuck is my problem? Using Yosi as a manufacturer was your idea. So what? So you set us up to get played by your husband. I set you up to make a lot of money and you fucked it all up. You don't listen, Ben. I told you he didn't know a thing. What the fuck were you thinking? You are psychotic on levels that I am only now beginning to understand. You know, I spoke to my friend at South Willard about Crisp. - You did? - Mm-hmm. I showed him your lookbook and he said it seemed unevolved, juvenile and lacked focus. Huh. Well, fuck your friend. Yeah, well, you just may have to, because they said the same thing at Odin and opening ceremony. Ben, you're really cute and you're highly ambitious, but I gotta tell you I am not sure your destiny is in fashion. Well, it was a pleasure not doing business with you, Nancy. What the fuck was that? Somebody could get killed. Sorry. ( Knocks on door ) Who is it? Tim: Yeah, I'm here about the Craigslist ad... The full body massage. Can't pass up a deal. How do you know where I live? Because I used to work for the FBI/lulu told me. Hey, listen, thanks so much for the Russian baths visit. - That was so great. - Yeah, I know. I'm really sorry about that. Look, shit's been kind of strange lately. Some girls just wanna fuck me because their boyfriends wear Neanderthal T-shirts. - That must be so hard for you. - No. I'm actually pretty good with commitment, plus Heather is into the idea of threesomes. It's just too bad that she didn't find you attractive. What do you want? I'm really sorry that you got fired for writing a fucking article about me. Don't be sorry. It was my fault. I read the article. It was really fucking good. You know, you're an Okay writer, Rachel. Thanks, Tim. Look, you definitely have a way of making my Neanderthal bullshit sound important. Rachel, look, I just came by today to see if you wanted - to come work for us. - What? Yeah, I keep trying to tell you. Shit has gotten super fucking busy. And as opposed to paying some publicist four grand a month, I figure I'd give you two. Tsk. ( Snickers ) Are you into that? ( Inhales ) - Yeah, Okay. - Awesome. Shit's gonna get weird.

I got my hands tied. What do you want me to do? Do you know that I am going to medium- security prison tomorrow? - Ah. - I could get shanked in the shower. The last thing I'm gonna remember is you kicking me out of my table. - Uh, come on. - It's great. - Relax. We're good. - Yeah, relax. Bullshit. The kind of money I spend here...

Hey hey, let me just be honest with you, okay? I never really believed we could make it on our own. Sometimes I feel like I'm destined to work at some lame ad agency - or back at retail. - Dude, you gotta stop with that. I know, but I worry I'm not talented enough or... I don't know, the universe has other plans for me. Fuck what the universe has planned. I spoke English as a second language. I dropped out of high school and I never doubted once that we weren't gonna make it. I thought these people were gonna help us. I was just determined not to fail for the millionth time in my life. And I fucked up. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I get it. All good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, you know, so I was talking to the kid that lives here. He's moving out at the end of the month. Yeah? Hey, this could be a good office for us, right? What? With the gadzooks money. We could swing it. What gadzooks money? Oh, you remember Andy Sussman, right? Only for Crisp do I come Chinatown at 5:00 in the morning to take a meeting. Nice to see u, Cam. - What's up, Andy? - Gadzooks is up. I got my uncle's factory ready to work overtime to make the delivery, which is not bad, considering Ben call me yesterday - begging me to be your rep. - You did, Ben? I did. Ben said he needed your blessing to make it official. So what do you guys say? You in or what? - Definitely yes. - All right. You know, you two never should've dissed the kid in the first place. - I tried to tell him. - Yeah yeah yeah. And don't be fooled by the baby face. - I'm an animal. - How could we, man? ( Chuckles ) So wll ship gadzooks and then what? Huh? What are we doing next, guys? Come on, let's lock and load. - We're making jeans. - Why not? Making jeans. Sounds good to me. All right. Kapo: This is exactly how I wanna remember my boys when I'm locked up in my cage.

Hanna, the press conference and photo shoot been moved to tomorrow. There inquired just an older man for you. He ​​said he knew you from before. Someone who knew me from the past? - He asked me to give this to you. For Hanna goddess of fishes Hanna, are you? Will I get a glass of water for you? Go get him. Go get him. Grandma, who was that guy? That man... That man is Abrascha. No one could play as beautiful as Abrascha. Germany awakes 1939 Bravo. Poltrava, Ukraine Spring 1941 Larissa and Abrascha. Two geniuses. Two prodigies. Culture in such perfection belongs to the great achievements... of our system and our party. Of course we also industrious youth our thanks. And their parents: couples Brodsky and Kaplan. You go stand. Irina Solomonova, get there too but. To show what the Soviet education in Ukraine has achieved... , our glorious party decided to these prodigies... to join in include Moscow and Leningrad. Prodigies. That word, I had never heard. But indeed their music sounded as a miracle in the ears. I had never heard such beautiful music . Piece Sarasate I knew of course. The sheet music I had. But it just sounded different. As if it and their music was not just that of Sarasate. Hey Abrascha catch. Do not you come on? Is there something wrong? I do not know. Perhaps much music is not good for us. How so? Everyone is proud of us. We may even go to Moscow. Therefore net. Moscow is also the Central Conservatory located. Maybe we should stay there. What can they teach us? Irina is the best. She sure is. Abrascha... I do not want to leave. If we just make a few mistakes, is the party not so proud of us. Moreover, I am too. Let's go tracking. Like the Indians. Hi, I'm Hanna. Hanna Reich. - What are you doing? I want to play with you. - We prefer to play alone. Not so play. I want to make music with you. Come on. I was at your concert site. You're German, right? We have no time to play with you . We go on tour. Did you know that the Indians called this an iron horse? I think it's pretty scary. She instills fear in me also. We go with our music conquer the world. Here is where the train. - Larissa and Abrascha, come on. You are not yet so famous that you can waiting train. Come on. In the train I can buy food. - Not as good as this. Listen to your mother. I have read on the go. Anything So chief, stay healthy and take care of the two ladies. Superb. That you play for the first time. A beautiful melody. A German piece? - No, my friend Larissa Brodsky. I did not know you had a new girlfriend. I also taught by Irina Solomonova. Did you know that an Indian on his own a buffalo with a bow and arrow to kill? Or a lion with a knife? They suck those Indians stories from their thumb. Abrascha Give that horrible knife to me. I've got Colonel Tapilin. Such a stupid gift can only give a policeman. The knife is yours, but this trip remains folded. A cut may be the end of our tour mean. Do you want that? You need your hands spared. They are your most precious instrument. They are irreplaceable. So, now we're rehearsing. You are now Soviet representatives. You should always behave as if Comrade Stalin sitting next to you. We will now play Hungarian Dance. Hanna, your teacher is there. Please come down. Alexander, glad you're here. Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall. - What's Carnegie Hall? The most famous concert hall in America. You go in the fall there on tour. We go to the Wild West? - May the whole family? You should be on stage soon. Bending. That is not to believe this. America. And can anyone join? - We Americans will show... the best prodigies live in the Soviet Union, among others here. Hopefully grandpa still also included in the family, huh? Without you I'm not going to Grandpa. To your health, kid. On you. Better today than tomorrow. And for good. You deserve a life without hatred for our people. Do not tell me such things, father. There is no better country than our homeland. Hello, my name is Max Reich. I am the director of the German brewery. I know who you are. What can I do for you? I hope not to bother you, but I'd like to see. I thought the house was on fire, as soon as you played. Hanna kept himself only at the right pace. Larissa has no problem with my pace. Much feeling for music and so few people. Hanna, you have a beautiful bowing and a good sense of rhythm. I loved it. All three of you. I think we should do this more often. - That we would find very pleasant. This you were lost in the lake. What the hell is that? - For anyone a new winter coat. Come here. Fits like a glove. - Those were fixed very expensive. Cheap they certainly were not. - Who do they get paid? Why do you ask? - Max Reich sure, huh? Did you ask money for my music? Why did not you tell me? - If your father, I can decide for themselves. He does justice to its name, because he is rich. In socialism everything is shared. It's all about me? To me and my music. Come here, please. You've rehearsed a lot lately. There are your father and I very happy. Yes, I love to play. Sit down. You know I'd find if you exercise more fine. And your teacher complains about your math skills. I know you're fond of music, and that's fine. Yet I have the feeling that you rehearse especially for those two kids. These prodigies. - Larissa and Abrascha are my friends. Those kids are Jewish. It is not good for you if you handle them too much . Not for us. Actually, you've earned that money, yes. Your father has been spared from the mouth food for your music lessons. If money is more important than music, then you better stop playing. Listen with your heart and focus on your music. My heart still has no ears? But a soul. Where is Abrascha? - He's grounded. He had quarreled with his father because of our classes here. We did not know that your father pays for it. Yes, but I just... I thought we could be friends. Using the music That song is beautiful. Come on girls, let's get started. It's about friendship. Stop, stop, stop. Dvorak Humoresque called this piece. Why do you play it legato? You need to turn on the powerful tones. Grazioso. I also had trouble with that piece. I Will it happen? And the composition is finished already? - Abrascha and I have an appointment. This piece is for real friends. Only they can hear it. Larissa and I were wondering if you sometimes can hear it already. Are you serious? I want to show you something. To me they do not come. How do you do that? Hanna, you are the goddess of fish. The Fuehrer, who today finally his silence has been broken... Has the fate of Europe in the hands of the German soldiers laid . The fight against the red leaders in Moscow is of decisive historical importance. The Luftwaffe bombed the Russian army. The German army on 22 June, at three o'clock in the morning... the advance of enemy troops halted . This can not be right? Hitler and Stalin have a non-aggression pact signed. The neutrality was guaranteed. - Surely it can also Stalin's fault? What does this all mean? We do not know yet, Hanna. And you better go home. Hitler wants to expand to the east and the Russian intelligentsia eradicate. The Führer represents German interests. Also ours. I run blindly at the Fuehrer when he offered me this directorship. Now we live on the front. - We can go back, right? The consulate shall determine that we can go back home. The NKVD will hunt us. We are now the enemy. What is that? The NKVD? A kind police. - Police? These are the executioners of the party. I'm going to go to the brewery. - Is not that dangerous? Then I go along. The Red Army is highest state of alert. It is war. What consequences does this have for us? Alexei, who is today all come to work? Approximately half. Should I send them home? Who wants to work can work. I have not declared war. I have to go to the consulate. I'll see you around. Daddy, why is Germany Russia? I do not know. Yesterday Hitler and Stalin were still friends. We'll come home, I promise you. This is still our home? And everyone likes us. The war rages now here. Reich consulate Move. - Colonel Tapilin, we would... Crouch. Tapilin Can not ask for help? He ​​has never been averse to bribes. Another reason to shoot us. We need to bring Hanna in safety. No, we must stick together. Hanna, come along soon. Comb the whole house. Yuri, you know the kitchen. Boris, upwards. - Mama, I'm afraid. What is it? No one at home? Not here -. Come on, get out. We stay together, I promise. Tomorrow morning we will discuss everything. That doctor Brodsky. Hello, here we are. Sorry to come so late, but Tapilin and the NKVD coming. They are already gone. -. Then you're in luck They'll be back. You must leave the city. We have to think of something. Do you have a place where you can hide the time being? Is this space really never used? - Only Alexi and I have a key. Connect us. There should be nothing suspicious appearing to the lock. Do not worry, we soon along. That God may protect you. And come back in one piece. I'm counting on you, boy. We go to the front and I do not know whether I before even go home. Do not tell anyone. Really no one. If Tapilin discovered that we help the Reich family... Our lives we no longer certain. Appearance after tomorrow they should have the same amount. In Germany we were safe. - Do not be naive. We were here before the idiot chased the world to himself in the harness. If we survive this, I'm leaving you. I still wanted to never go to Russia. And who is the leader here? Is someone there? What is it? Colonel Tapilin of the NKVD. We are looking for Max Reich. Can he have hidden here somewhere? That seems stiff. I would have noticed. He has enriched our harvest, which capitalist. The language of the so-called superior race. That is over now. Max Reich, our country and spied information channeled to the fascists. If we grab him, he gets the ball. And everyone who helps him. Understood? - Of course, Comrade Tapilin. Come on. We need eastward for the Germans here. I heard they are already approaching 200 kilometers Poltava. I can not just leave everything here. I have to think about my patients. Boris , you said yourself that our lives at risk if the Germans... You're right. I got it. What do Germans against Jews? The Reichs are still our friends? Some Germans are not as nice as the Reichs. I am. Abrascha. If you have some time to go? It is an old hunting lodge. I 'm discovered when tracking. I come here often with Larissa. For the rest, nobody knows it. And? What do you think? I do not know how to thank you. It can go well and think positive feelings back to us. Thanks. What do you do if the Germans... When the war reached Poltava? My family goes tomorrow to the east, far away from the Germans. I try to stop them. My unit goes to the west. Not send your family away? I can borrow money. That makes no sense, there are no train tickets to get more. I want to say goodbye to Larissa. You can not go to the station. - Yes I do with you? Please. We should go. - I'll pick you up. Abrascha will take care of you. It may take weeks for the Wehrmacht there. As already coming. Comrade Brodsky, you must back to the hospital. I'll take it from here. Go on, get out of here. Hurry up. Get out. Take care of yourself. Once the hospital is evacuated, I travel chase you. You do not. The train was packed. - We have tickets. Let them boarding. I am a member of the Central Committee and I demand that you leave them boarding. For you there is still a place. Get in, we'll be taking off. For the others do not. Go home to rehearse for the concert at the hospital. The brave soldiers of Poltava deserve. And do not forget to take along a teacher. - That the devil may get Tapilin you. The devil is only interested in those who believe in god. God will protect us. We must fight for what we love. That will remain so. Larissa, close the curtains. Hello, I'm Hanna Reich. - Who lived here for a very long time. And I think she's not coming back soon. I'm thirsty. Could I possibly a glass of that delicious lemonade? Who do I have to do first. And apples out of the basement. Please. Right then. How sweet of you. Thank you. It all comes out of your pantry. We may sleep tonight if that's okay. This is in any case better than trips to the station. Can I? Here's never gonna be somebody. - Then you have to go inside. It is high time to finish our friendship song. Indians made such a mark if they had spotted a predator. Do you really discovered an animal? Is that because of the war? If the Russians flights, the Germans around. There you are at last. It's all ready. Dad, we have to tell you something. In the forest we saw... is not all that bad. My chief. Most importantly I'm alive. Yet I am left-handed. Sorry, but we have really begin. Daddy, why do they do that? They want to show how cruel they can be. Look there. Germans. We're saved. Stop. Helga, be careful now. - Hello. We are Germans. - Do not shoot. Becker, what is it? My husband Max and my daughter Hanna. I'm Helga Reich, that's my husband Max and daughter Hannah. And I Stand Arte Führer Schwartow. Nice to meet you. War Injury? - No, sports injury. Winter Games in 1936 in Garmisch. Skiing. Are you the Max Reich? How wonderful to meet you here. I can pretty skiing, but not as good as you . What are you doing here on earth? Hold on tight. If the commander comes, you have to laugh. What is going on here? The stage is cleared for the new rulers. Do you know what day it is? - A sad day. I must ensure how the fascists occupied my country. And many compatriots find that even fine. I do not mean. Our concert in America. Carnegie Hall. We now had to stand. As you probably still sometimes act on. Do not lose hope. Come on, come on. Come on. Walk. Come on, move. There is Hanna. You can greet friends better afterwards. Thanks Abrascha and Larissa we escape the Russians. Well done. And how? Abrascha had a cabin in the woods found and there they brought us food. They deserve an award for. Never mind. Stand Arte Führer Schwartow understand what you mean. We also play together. I do not know any better musicians. They have already performed in large halls. Once Comrade Stalin was even present. I would like you's want to hear you play. I love art and culture. Is that regulate? I'd like nothing better. Although the Jews? What Mr. Schwartow of us need? - No idea. So he called Stand Arte Führer Schwartow. - Stand Arte Fuhrer? What a strange word. Mr. Reich. Hanna, I've heard that you can play well. Violin Come here. A perfect musician needs a perfect tool do not you think? Open it. This is from Cremona. Play something for us once you have voted him. The Sixth Army is stationed here and that takes a lot of beer. This is good for morale. - I will do my best. You are not rich, Mr. Reich. Incredibly rich. Schumann. I hear it right away. I ever wanted to be an opera singer. Siegfried. Beautiful. You can keep it. - Such an expensive present I can not accept. Your daughter is playing really fantastic. Well, I certainly did a dozen lie. This is worth a fortune. How did you get this? I've been given a gift Stand Arte Führer Schwartow. He has more. Perhaps you also get one. Pleasant. - Good evening. There is Krystyna already with the beer. Unfortunate fact that the racial doctrine of the culture does not spare. Can a war be the reason to sweep the culture of a people away? I say it like this. You should not build the world, but dominate. Can I have him? Are you looking at this violin from Cremona's good. This is not a German violin, but she is now German owned. I see it differently. Something not yours, you can not give it away. Why Germany is also sufficient pressure with conquering the world. So he's all ours. Krystyna just made lemonade in the kitchen. Do you want another beer? - A German beer? Always. The Indian shaman shares such stones to the young warriors. This is called a strength amulet. - Power Amulet? That sounds funny. When in danger it was hard to express you get strength. Grab your amulet in hand and close your eyes. Now stretch your other hand. That means that we are brother and sister. All three. Forever and ever. No one can not change anything. Not Schwartow not., And the war We promise each other. All Jews from Poltava fifty years and over... should at least 4 hours gather this afternoon at the station. Should give to this call all parties involved. I repeat all Jews aged fifty and over... should at least 4 hours gather this afternoon at the station of Poltava. Where's Grandpa? Do you just let him go? We still had to hide him? Jew You can not leave, Grandma. - Make me well not harder. Tell them to stay here. Irina, where are you going? - I'm over 50. Please stay. Larissa, I have closed my heart. Whatever happens, you should always be understood for your music? Remain in the car. Grandma Polina. - Grandfather. Why was Irina remain, but Larissa's grandma and grandpa's Abrascha not? No idea, but Schwartow has promised that nothing will happen to them. Where the train is actually going? I really do not know. I have to go. Jews may no longer show this time around on the streets. My wife will be back, I'll bring you. - I really do not. Say prodigy, what's in there? - Just keep walking. I asked you, Jew. Dirty Jewish whore. Walk quickly. If Mr. Reich gives you something, he hears you bring home. The prodigies. You'd have to go to the east. You too. This is our homeland. According Schwartow the elderly represent only the first wave treatment. We can not let that happen. Mr. Brodsky, the more I could not get it as soon together. I'll be back tomorrow. Please. - Thank you. What will that do? In Kiev brewery should arise. Command commander. Sober you certainly do not win this rotten war. Schwartow want you to go. - Why can not I come? We are back after tomorrow. Do not worry. Krystyna will take care of you. Can Abrascha and Larissa come? Sweetheart. Their families are hiding. I do not know where, but it goes well with them. I'm thirsty. - Mr. Reich could come anytime. How nice that you join us. Your commitment to the League of German Maidens in Berlin is sorely missed. Before I forget to say: On 7 October Reichsführer Himmler year. In honor of him a party given in the theater. Beautiful room. Ever been? Hanna, that would be the ideal opportunity... Our Reichsführer with your new violin bring. An aubade They would rather do nothing. - Naturally. If you drive past the brewery yet? I have to do something. Unfortunately, we can not let the generals wait. It is very important. What is more important than the German victory? Driving. Those Germans can brew excellent. What are you thinking? To us more. And the fish. And Hanna. Why is Hanna suddenly our enemy? Because adults are stupid. Poltava there is better to become now all Jews are gone. The Germans are right. You know what you should do. Jews with What do we do with the Jews? - You make them by hand. Goodnight. Do not forget to brush your teeth. What would be wrong with Mr. Reich? Why does not he come? Something happened. Otherwise he had been there a long time. If we do not do something soon, we will not survive. Do you know what the benefit is here? I can drink as much as I want, without my wife show me the door. I just try it. Beware well. Street Germans patrolling with their Ukrainian henchmen. You stay here. - Let him go. During the revolution there were a lot of guys like him. It takes courage to fight for what you love . Miss Hanna, what are you doing here? Very good, boy. You just have to unlock the weapon first. You must help us, Alexi. Please. - Please. How? First we have to take her home. - talk to Him, go ahead. Jesus... if I don't... if I cheat on her... Oh, sh... Go, I ain't here, I'm invisible. This is it, man, you got a problem. Hold on. Look at you. - Surprise. - Yvette. - Hey, sis. - Hey. I wasn't expecting you 'til next week. It's Yvette, how you doing? Yeah, well, I thought I'd surprise you. You know, I had to fly in to cover the game last minute with the flu bug going around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good to see you. You don't mind if I crash, do you? Come on, stop it, of course, I'll get your room ready. Let me get you something to drink first. - Okay. - What you want? Um, some water. - Water it is. - Yes. I must say, sis, I'm pretty proud of you. Got the new job at the network, huh? Oh, thank you. My sister's a sportscaster. I've been watching all your stuff online. I saw that piece you did on concussions in the NFL. Really? It was pretty stellar, kind of stellar. I've been, uh... I've been following you too. Wow. - Jarvis. - Yeah. I didn't expect to see you here. Well, I should have known you two are joined at the hip. Yeah, you know, I was trying to tell him about boundaries and stuff, you know what I'm saying? A healthy friendship has good boundaries and stuff. But he don't listen. - See a real relationship... - Okay, you know what, um let me get your bag and, um you guys can talk. - How's the weather? - So... - Eat your... - How's... Sorry. All right, um, I guess it's been a while. Yeah, it's been a minute. Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm... I know I didn't call and everything but, I mean the last time we spoke, - things kind of ended... - Yeah, I know, I understand. It's okay. I mean, I flew a thousand miles away and you didn't find it good to call me and check on me. No, "Yvette, how you doing?" Or maybe, "I'm sorry. " After all this time, you still can't apologize. You know, maybe I should just go. No, no, no, no, no, no. You stay, I'll go. Yvette I'm sorry. Thank you. How hard was that? L... I gotta go, 'cause, you know... Well, give me a hug. - For real? - Yes. Give me a hug, stop playing. - For real? - Stop it. - See? - Yeah. See, we can at least be friends. We... Friends? I think friends is a good idea. I think, yeah, this... Oh, that feels friendly, that's friendly. Oh, yeah, ooh, yeah, that's... That's... Oh, whoo! Hey, hi, girl! Hey, hey, um, have fun! How you doing, baby? You got the nerve to cheat on me with a cute girl? Hello, I'm Yvette, Elston's sister. - Uh-huh. - She cute. You know what, I should kill you right where you stand. After all I done for you. Wait, it's not like that, we're just old friends. Yeah, yeah, just listen to her. Just old friends. Listen here, baby girl, old friends don't embrace like that. - That's right. - You know, my mama was right. You can't trust a man as far as you can throw him. You ain't nothing but some two-timing no-good fool. Look, we were just... we just friends... I'm just visiting... I'm just visiting with her. - Just visiting? - Yes! Hey, hey, hey, what's all the commotion in here? It's just Raven, you know, acting out again. I'm gonna show you acting out. - You know what... - Take that out of my house. - I will see y'all, good night. - It was lovely seeing... And you know what? You stay away from my man. We're happy. Okay, thank you. - Good night. - Close the door behind you. Boy, I tell you. Should we be calling the police? No, that's them two all the time. Lucky there weren't no blood. He'll be all right in the morning. Am I safe here? What you mean, are you safe here? Big bro got your back, of course. Yeah, just like old times, huh? - Of course. - Um-hm. Mom did always say for you to look out for me no matter what. Yeah, she was always talking about keeping family first, huh? Yeah. I miss her. Yeah, not a minute goes by I don't... think about her, you know? Yeah. Only God knows why he needed her up there. Amen, sister. - I missed you. - It's good to see you. - Are you hungry? - Starving. Okay, we need to go out, sis. - I have no food here. - Clearly. - Somebody knocking. Yvette: Yeah. Hey, uh... Oh, sorry, Elston, good to see you. Come on in here, baby. - You know my wife. - Of course. Good to see you. Listen, um, don't mean to barge in on you. We were on our way to a jazz club and there's a big accident on the Kennedy Expressway so decided to take your exit. - Got a bottle of the bubbly. - Okay. Thought I'd share it with you. We're so sorry to intrude. - This was not my idea. - That's nonsense. You guys are welcome. Make yourself at home. And who is this lovely young lady? This is my sister Yvette. You met her last year at the Christmas party. Yes, I remember. You still look smashing. Well, thank you. Yes, you're very cute. Thank you. Oh, my... What's wrong? I was just caught off guard by the size of your feet. Damn. Please, don't take offense. L... It just startled me. Me a little bit too. Um, we better pop the cork on that bottle. I'll do the honors. Oh, look, allow me, I got it. Ah, Elston. Bathroom? You know, this thing got a mind of its own. Hello, yes. Excuse me. Yes, I can follow the team to Dallas. Yes, yes... Young man, would you mind helping a damsel in distress? No problem. Thank you. So, you know, some things require a strong young man's touch. Whoo, ah-ha-ha. I'm getting a raise. What are you doing here, Sheila? Hello-ho-ho. The question is, what are you doing here? I was just helping her, okay, relax. Yeah, look like you was helping yourself. Bag, please. Mr. Randall asked me come by and drop off these files after I came back home from my card game. Oh-ho-ho, I went blind seven. I'm set, baby. I won 50 bucks. Amen and amen. Whoo. Elston, uh... I hope I didn't tear it up too badly, man. Baby... I cannot eat any more of those burritos from that cantina. It just tore my stomach apart. Yeah, maybe we should get a move on it. Looks to me like somebody else has got a move on while you were gone. What does she mean by that? Oh, no, no, no, my tongue, it just gets loose, you know, when I get to sipping at those card games. Don't pay me no mind. You know, my tongue gets even looser when my pocketbook is lighter. Thank you very much. Your generosity is "muchly" appreciated. It's gonna go to a good cause. Here are you files. Oh, thank you. I didn't see nothing. Goodbye, Sheila. What's that all about? I think... you need to cut her hours. She got a couple screws loose. Don't we all. Listen, baby, why don't we have a little champagne? We just got here. Sit back and relax. Yeah, but, you know, maybe we should go. I'm feeling a little flushed. Just... a little flushed. Okay. Yeah, um... Maybe you guys should take a rain check, you know. You don't want her feeling weak and then you guys have an accident or something. Yeah, when I feel like this, I tend to be a little reckless. Okay, okay, buttercup. Whatever you want. We'll get you home and get you wrapped up, okay? Thank you. Can't keep my hands off of you. Hey, listen, um... - sorry we're leaving so soon. - No problem. But I left the bottle of champagne for you. And I'll see you in the office tomorrow, son. See you tomorrow, sir. - Let's go, baby. - Okay. - See you in the morning. - Come on, baby. According to this report, this should be a no-brainer. The trucker's blood alcohol level was well above the legal limit when he hit her. I don't know, man, what kind of monetary value can you put on a pinkie toe? Same as any toe. No, no, not necessarily. I mean, I don't know if the jury's gonna see it like that. You see, now, a pinkie toe probably should cost a little considerably less. I mean, no, a big toe, yeah, big toe... bucks, I understand that. But with a pinkie toe? Let bygones be bygones. What kind of open-toe shoes a 70-year-old woman gonna wear anyway? That pinkie toe is long gone. It's dead, forget about it. Sometimes I wonder what goes on in that head of yours. Look, I just say the things that people are scared to say. You say the things that scare me for you as well as future generations. I... I guess I'm just tripping, man. I've been going through some stuff lately, dude. This woman's crazy, dude, I... She's putting stuff on the stove, heating it up and everything. She's on some medieval stuff right now. I can't handle it, man, I don't know what's going on. Yeah, she got issues. Yeah, she got issues, but what does it say about me? I'm still with her. Why don't you stand up for yourself, man? You weren't like that in college. Yeah, I know. I know, I know, I guess I... Guess I lost my mojo a little bit, man. Yeah, it's like you lost your confidence after you didn't get drafted. You remember what happened, dude? I'm sitting there waiting to get drafted. The agent snatches the chicken wing right out of my mouth. Just like that, you know? In front of my friends, my family members. I had the whole party set up, it was embarrassing, dude. I remember, I had to pay half the bill. That was the most humiliating day of my life. Hands down. It was just... humiliating. You was a loser, too. Yes, you know what? My grandmother even called me a loser. You're not a loser, man. Look, you're... you're... look, you're a junior lawyer. Come on. I'm a junior lawyer. Yes, and now you probably should leave. You know what? On that note, I'm just gonna get out of here, man. - I got some things to take care of. - All right. - You can finish up yourself. - Shake it off, buddy. Junior lawyer. Uh what are you doing here? - Shh! Look... No, listen, about last night, uh... Shh. I was totally in the wrong. Don't say not another word. It was my fault. Sometimes I just... I just don't think straight. No, it's okay, I know what you mean. Listen, let's just promise each other that it won't happen again. No harm, no foul, right? - Agreed. - Agreed. Now I think it would be in your best interest to clear the premises 'cause you do not want to let Sheila catch you here. You know how she is. I slipped her a 20 on the way in. She's looking out for me. Ah, the power of money, I love it. See, that's just it, Elston. I thought that money would make me happy. I thought that it would make me love him more but it didn't. I ended up marrying for all the wrong reasons and when I look at you, it just reminds me that, um... Yeah, listen, um... I'm not sure I wanna have this conversation now. He's my boss and he's been really good to me. All right? You think you know that man? You don't. That man, he is greedy and he is low-down. - Okay... - He built this firm on the backs of loyal, hard-working, dedicated people like you. He's just like his father and his grandfather. Okay, listen. He's your husband, all right. Yes, and that's why I have the right to tell the truth. Okay, I'd really rather not have this conversation, all right? All right, maybe you're right. I'm sorry to bother you. It's no problem. He's coming down the hall. If you want me to fake a seizure, it'll be an extra 40 bucks. - It's not necessary. - You sure? I talked myself out of two speeding tickets that way. Works like a charm. Come on, girl, now you... No, no, no, you are not about to pay my bills if I lose this job. Now come on, get your stuff, get your bags together. Come on, get out of here, get out! Look... everything's gonna come to the light. You're gonna see the truth. Yeah, baby, yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah, I just went to the bathroom. That's all I did. I know, I should have called you on my cell phone, but, yeah, it takes a little longer 'cause they didn't have paper towels. And you know I don't like to air dry. I can't go back to my desk soggy. Sweet... No, no, I didn't. Okay, number two. Are you happy? No, I didn't go talk to the Human Resources lady. No, you messed that up for me, yeah, you did. Yeah, you remember, you called in a bomb threat. Yeah, now she's scared to death. Yeah, every time she see me, yeah, she runs in the opposite direction. Imagine Flo Jo on the 47th floor in kitten heels, just going that way. That's what happens. Yeah, un-huh. Yeah, okay, look, baby, I'm gonna call you back, okay? Yeah, in 10.4 minutes. Yeah, I'll call you back, I promise. I know you're counting. Okay, love you. He dumped me! Who... who, Charles? The married guy. Yeah, he said I should've known that what we had was just temporary. Just for fun. Ohh... I feel so used. Oh, ooh, oh. I mean, ooh, don't cry. Oh, oh, the pain, I can feel the pain from... Don't cry. Come on, ooh, come on, just... I know, even trampolines need love too. I hate to say I told you so, Sheila. - But I told you so. - Gee, thanks. Well, what... Well, what do you want me to say? What do you expect for me to say? When you're wrong, you're wrong, Sheila. You can't be going around wrecking people's homes, wrecking this, wrecking that. In the words of the immortal Ice Cube: # You better check yourself # # Before you wreck yourself # # You better check yourself... ## You can't even understand. You can't. No. I never had no one to love me, okay? My father left me and my mother when I was eight years old. Do you know what it's like to cry yourself to sleep at night because you miss somebody so much? Do you wonder? You ever wonder why somebody doesn't love you? No, no, you don't. So you just need to shut your mouth! That's enough now. I know what it feels like to hurt. I know what it feels like to have a spicy chicken wing ripped out of your mouth when you don't make the draft. And you know what? I know what it's like to pay the bill at that dinner at that draft. You know how embarrassing that is? You know how hard it is to go back to the block where you ain't got drafted? Now I'm here dealing with you and everything. I know about that pain. I deal with that pain every day. But you know what, I know God's got my back. God don't like ugly. So of course you're gonna have a little harder time than most. You are, I'm just saying. But still, you gotta get down on your knees. You gotta get down on your knees and pray. Hallelujah, Honda Civic, Osama Bama. Yes, you gotta get down on your knees and you got to pray, all right? You know, I just... You know what, I'm gonna get back to work because if I get to preaching around here, I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost. Y'all ain't gonna hear me up in this piece. You know, I'm gonna go off. Whoo, Lord, Jesus, amen... Sheila. Can you hold all my calls please? Uh, Yeah, Mr. Rand... hey, how you doing? You need some coffee, take your coat, anything? Yeah, I need a coffee with three Splendas. Okay, three Splendas, all right, and so, uh... three Splendas, so Jarvis Brown getting your coffee. Remember Jarvis Brown, 'cause I get the coffee. Go this way, all right now... Can you have Elston meet me in my office? I need to have a very personal conversation with him. Oh, yes, sir. Remember, Jarvis Brown, coffee, anytime. Got ya, I'll be right back. Oh, he knows. He knows, he knows everything. - Did you open your big mouth? - I can't believe it, I can't believe it. - My money supply's gonna dry! - I didn't do anything. - What if I die, what if I die? - I didn't do anything. Take it to the grave, man. Take it to the grave, that's that I always say, man. That's it, I'm telling you right now... You've been so good to me. I can't believe he's gonna kill you. First you're gonna get fired. Oh, no, I'm gonna miss you so much, Elston. Where's he at? He said for you to meet him in the conference room. All right, conference room it is. Oh, Elston... after you get killed, since I know the combination to your safe can I have that $1,500... please? I'm saving for a beauty procedure. Ooh. Okay, Mom, can you just sing the first part for me? Yeah, I'm stressed out right now. Everybody here is crazy. Yeah, okay, just sing it like you used to. I'll sing with you. Okay, okay. # Twinkle, twinkle # # Little star ## Yeah, uh, yeah, like I was saying, I just punched him in the face. You know, that's what we do, we slap people for fun. Yeah, that's what we do here at the law firm. Yeah, uh-huh, all right, okay, I gotta go. Yo... what's up, man? I'll tell you later. I ain't seen your face long like that since you punched a cheerleader for stealing your dance moves. That was you, not me. Oh, yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah. I would've left him alone too if he didn't take my signature spin move. She's not answering. Listen, tell Yvette I'm not gonna be able to make lunch. I got something I need to handle. Okay, boss, no problem. Mom, you still there? # Ooh-ooh-ooh... ## Mr. Trace, I need to talk to you. Have a seat. No, sir, I'd rather stand. I'd rather you sit. I'd rather stand, sir. Young man, have a seat. Please. What is it? - Well, sir, I... - Wait, son, let me stop you. I know exactly what you wanna say, okay? Sir... Son, let me stop you. I wanna talk to you about something that's very dear to my heart. I know, that is why I want to talk... Listen. This firm has been the cornerstone of this community for over a decade. And I'm very proud of that. And I don't make any decisions in here that are not in the best interests of this firm, even when it's personal. Right, sir. So I've decided I've decided to, uh... interview for the... Vice President of Operations position. It doesn't mean you're not gonna get the job. It just means I think we may go with somebody a little bit more qualified. More qualified? I put my blood, sweat and tears in this place for a decade. I know you did. Long hours, no vacations. How can you tell me "more qualified"? ! That's my position. Son, I've been watching you and you've been walking around here with your... your chest poked out, like you're the big gun, like you're the top gun, like you're running things around here. Like I owe you something. Can I ask you a question? Do I owe you something? Now, son, you're not ready. Maybe you'll be ready in a few years. But you're not ready now. So I'll have my decision in a few weeks. I don't have any words right now. Sometimes no words is the best answer. Can I go? I have some work to do. You know, I have to go pick up that Simmons check. You know, she's getting a half a million dollars for a pinkie toe? Do you know how much she could've got for a big toe? You know what? If you threw in a hand and a foot she could clean up. Listen... it's gonna be fine. God... Oh... Charles, can you please stop sending me directly to your voice-mail and call me back? Please? What are you doing here? He just walked out. I was listening at the door. I guess you were right, I... I tried to warn you. I have to admit it, I... I just don't think you understand what I did for that man. Win all those cases. Long hours. I haven't had a vacation in five years. Three days after my mother passed I was back at work. I deserve that promotion. Elston, you're an attorney. You know you don't get in life what you deserve. You get what you negotiate. When he needed you, you should've just talked to him. Now that you need him, you don't have a leg to stand on. It's your husband, though, what do I do, like... Let me just talk to him. You know, pillow talk does wonders. You would do that? Yeah. I appreciate it. Come here, I can make you feel better. No, it's... No... Look, don't say no. That's your problem. You're always looking out for somebody else and how they feel. You need to focus on yourself. Elston, I know you want to. Everybody needs somebody. Come here. - Let me make you feel better. - Vanessa... Shh. Oh! I'm sorry to intrude. I guess I should have knocked. Well, yeah. I almost forgot you was here. The last time that Elston had a woman at his house the Bulls were winning the championship. I know you was doing the cabbage patch and everything... Okay, okay, I forgive you. So what you watching? A special on the greatest NFL defenses of all time. Hmm, okay. Okay, who would you pick: The '86 Bears or the '76 Steelers? Uh, okay, that's a good question. Well, you know, everybody knows that I'm a hardcore Bears fan... but I'm gonna have to discreetly go with the Steel Curtain on this one. You know, you can't beat that total dominance on the field. Right, right. Okay, as usual, I agree with you. You are the expert, so, you know. Please, you're a walking sports encyclopedia. Well, it is kind of impressive up there sometimes. You know what I'm saying, but you know. - I just use it for sports, you know. - Stop it. You know everything. You know, that's one of the things that I love about you. - Really? - Yeah. You're such a smart man. - Smart man. - Mm-hmm. Uh... I should go call my mama. Jarvis, stop. Ooh, I mean... You know what, see, that right there. That right... that's what I like. Me and you, we can talk. You know, we just... it's easy. It's not complicated, it's like... And you don't try to change me. Didn't. I didn't try to change you. Didn't try to change me. Yeah, just like you... didn't have to break up with me. You didn't. I mean, you had me crying in the shower. I was singing Freddie Jackson songs. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I mean, it was... Okay, let's not dwell on the past, okay? I mean, sometimes people come into your life for a season. Yeah. Only God knows why. You know, my pastor, he preached a great word on the season of change in life last week. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Well, maybe you could help me with this. What do you do when someone you thought you loved turns out that you don't actually love them at all. Pray about it. I mean, the best thing I can tell you is to be honest with yourself. Be honest with her. But... you know my relationship with God. You know how I feel about it. I mean, with her... she doesn't see eye-to-eye about that. I mean, she hates organized religion. Well, pray for her and let the Holy Spirit deal with that. I mean, look... you... you should just love her and lead by example. You should let her see what He has done in your life. Wow. You see... this is why I dream about you so often. - Okay, stop... - No, I do. I mean, I be dreaming... I'll be asleep... - Dream about you. - Stop it. I mean, because you always have the right answers. Everything you say is just... it's magical. I mean, to be honest with you, lately I've been having these nightmares and, like, really scary... - Nightmares? - Nightmares! For real, like in the daytime, at my desk, just nightmares, and you're never in them. You're always in the good dreams. Okay, please. Spare me the details. All right, whatever, whatever. All right, well... Elston said he can't make it for lunch so, uh, how's about a hug? Uh, behave yourself. Come on, get your bigfoot over here and give me a hug now. Give me a hug. Fine. Oh, you crushed my toe. Just please stop it. All right. Keep talking about my feet. Hey, I'm not, you know, it is what it is, you know, hey. - You know I love you, right? - Mm-hm. But, uh, seriously, um thanks for the advice. Anytime. Bye. Bye. Woman: Ooh, child. I heard you in here just-a crying and a-sniffling. It can't be that bad, can it? No, I'm sorry. Can I help you? Oh, I'm Mrs. Simmons. - You know, pinkie toe. - Oh... oh. I'm sorry for your loss. Oh, don't be silly. I'm here for my check. God done took that toe back, child. Ain't nothing I can do about that. Well, Mr. Randall, he went to pick it up. He insisted that he do it in person and deliver it to you. See, that's why I called this firm right away as soon as I had that accident. The personal service. His grandfather was like that too, you know. Well, it's the least we can do, considering... Honey, don't feel sorry for me. Feel sorry for yourself but that man better hurry up and come on because I'm late for my tango class. - Shoot. - Tango? What part of "tango" don't you understand? The "tang" or the "go"? See, that's what's wrong with you young people. You're running around here upset because your life ain't going the way you want. That's because you're not grounded in the word. You don't know how God operates. Honey, life is like a parade. You standing on the street watching but God is way up top looking down. He's in the beginning of the parade and the end of the parade. But you came. That's why we have to have faith, sister. Well, is that... Is that why He makes us feel pain? The Bible says: "Weeping endures for a night "but joy... joy cometh in the morning" Hallelujah! Try Him. Ask Him. Ask Him to reveal Himself to you. Ask Him to give you the strength so that you can endure. And you'll see. All things come together for good for those who love the Lord. That's why God let me lose this toe so I could be a blessing to somebody. See, I'm leaving most of this money for some college scholarships. Oh. Oh, yes, God had a plan, honey. Whoa, that is so generous of you. Oh, that ain't nothing, I didn't do nothing. God did it all. And this ain't nothing. My parents were junkies. Left me on a housekeeper's doorstep when I was ten. Hurt like hell. But then one day I picked up that Bible and I learned that I could not dwell in the past. My future was up to me. I couldn't let somebody else's stupid decisions impact my thoughts. I couldn't let all that anger and hurt control my life. 'Cause I knew I was somebody. - And you know why? - Why? 'Cause my Heavenly Father said so. He loves me just the way I am. I just had to learn to see myself the way God sees me and someone He loved enough to give His life for. Thank you for your kind words. Well, I'm gonna run out of kind words if that man don't hurry up and get here soon. You gonna see the soft side come right on up out of me, child. I'm going to my tango lesson. Hey, look, I know that she's your sister and everything and you're probably the last person I need to be talking to about this but, look, man, I haven't felt this way in a long time. She's woken up something inside of me. I'm so confused. It must be going around. You know, I can feel it deep down in my heart. I can feel that little love and I just... You know what, I should confess. No, I can't confess, that would be a nightmare. You know, usually I always got somebody to talk to about this but, you know, my mama, she got that samba dance-off tonight so that's a no-go. - I gotta get out of here. - What? Cover for me. - Hey, uh, okay. - Cover for me. Some friend you are. Oh. Lord, Lord! Lord, I know it's been a while. It's been a long, long while but I can't do this no more. I'm empty. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm... give it all to you and see what you have in store for my life. I'm through with married men. I'm not dating no more of them and I'm through with all of that nonsense. And I'm gonna stop trying to cover up the pain with material things and improper relationships I know ain't going nowhere. I'm just trusting you and I'm gonna give it to you, Lord. I'm gonna give it all to you. Amen. Amen. You're moving up in the corporate world. No more of this mom-and-pop nonsense. Yeah, you're right. You gotta be the lion in the jungle that roars. Look, I say you let him work for you another year or two... then maybe you'll reconsider after the merger. Maybe a promotion, maybe not. Now remember what we talked about. I don't... I don't want to tell any of the other senior lawyers that I'm going to put $500,000 bonus aside for them, okay? - Mm-hmm, you're the boss. - All right, until after the merger. And I've already put Elston's money aside, okay? How do you know he won't take this money and start his own firm and take a couple of your clients or two? I say reconsider. That's why I love you 'cause you're so cunning and you're so shrewd. Love you too. Give me a kiss. You better go. I'll talk to you later. I need to talk to you, Jarvis. Do I have a choice? Not really. Okay, I'll just do what I do best. I'll get talked at. You see... that right there is exactly my point. I have done everything, everything to try to get over what you did to us. To help us stay together. But I have so much anger and pain towards you and I don't know how to let it go. Look, I've been through therapy. I've been down to the church. I've cried in front of the whole congregation. Just, I had... I'm crying like Jimmy Swaggart in front of a whole church for you. To show you that I'm sorry. But... it's not enough. I've asked God for forgiveness. But that doesn't matter. I really need your forgiveness. You had no right... You had no right... to hurt me like that, Jarvis. What do you want? What do you want, hmm? You think I'm supposed to take this punishment day in after day, huh? Do you want blood? Raven, do you want blood? Well, here, here. - I'll take blood. - No, I don't want blood, Jarvis. Take it, you want blood. Obviously you do. - Obviously you do because you... - No. You know what? Look, I know that you're not in love with me anymore. And you know how I know? That's not true. 'Cause you used to have a light in your eyes every time you looked at me. And that light has gone out, Jarvis. Why? Why? Because you've taken that light and you've chewed it out of me. You know, do you even know who I am anymore? Look, I... I'm a social butterfly. I like to get out, I like to socialize with people. I like to see and get to know the world. I tried to take you to church. You didn't want to do that. I tried to pray with you, you don't want to do that. What am I gonna do now? I can't... I can't go on like this. - I'm sorry... - No, you're not sorry. Because I know when that light went. I saw it when you looked at her. Do you even love me anymore? Come on with this... Do you even love me? What kind of question... what kind of question... - Just answer the question, Jarvis. - I... - I... - Don't. Just... just don't. I'll have my sister pack my things. - It doesn't have to end like this. - Don't! Don't. You should've thought about that when you slept with her. I'm sorry we didn't get to spend much time together. I mean, you've been working so much. I know. I feel so terrible. It's okay. I mean, I needed the quiet time. And plus, your couch is so comfortable. I could really move in. Well, you know, my couch is your couch. Listen, you need anything? You need some money or something or... Your baby sis is all grown up now. I can take care of myself. You make me feel so old. I cannot process how fast you're growing up. Well, we'll have plenty of time to talk about it - at the Super Bowl. - Yes, we will. 'Cause what man in his right mind would turn down free Super Bowl tickets, huh? Come here, give me a hug. Give me a hug. - I'm glad you came. - Yeah, me too. Um... I know I don't say this, but... - I've always looked up to you. - Aw. No, I do. When mom died... you were the strong one. You held us together. You're a hard-working and good man. An honest and Godly man. So please... don't change for anyone. Let me know if you need anything, all right? - I love you, too. - Okay. Do you think it would be okay if I stop by the office and tell Jarvis bye? Yes, yes, he's been texting me all day. Him and his girl finally split up for good so now's he's... Oh, okay, well, I will holler at you later. - Okay. - Yes. - See you at the Super Bowl. - Yes. - And I love you. - Love you too. - Yes, okay. - Drive... safe. I will. Whoo. What, you forgot your keys, huh? Wow. Yeah, I saw Sheila at the office. She said you'd be here. Amazingly, she didn't charge me this time because she said something about a building and a parade and God was on top of the building and... Yeah, um... You never know with Sheila. Yeah. Um... have a seat. Gladly. Can I, um, get you something to drink? No, that's okay. Oh, I saw your sister leaving out. I tried to duck behind the bushes and ended up twisting my ankle and ruining my shoes. Oh, wow, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. It's nothing Randall won't fix. Listen, um... about yesterday, I... About yesterday. You know, I... Yeah, kind of awkward, I just wasn't... Look, just hush. Don't say a word. Why don't you just relax and let's go with the flow and see where this takes us. Yeah. Don't be so stiff, Elston. Come on. You only live once. You know, I just... I just never... I never done anything like this before. I really don't know how to feel. I mean, you're on my mind all day. I can smell your perfume. I feel your touch when I close my eyes. Yeah. I think about you all day, too. I know how you feel. I just feel so guilty. - But at the same time... - It's kind of exciting. Trace, Trace and Trace. Well, sure. I'll transfer you right now. And God bless you. Excuse me, hi. I'm here for a meeting with Darion Jackson. Oh, well, why do you want to see Darion? Just being nosey. Well, I'm opposing counsel for Gladie Insurance. Kramer case. Now, y'all know y'all need to pay up. Now, come on. That woman ran smack into Mrs. Gladie while she was standing there minding her own business. Yes, minding her own business while backing up on a major street. Well, the woman has Alzheimer's. She gets confused. Now, how can you punish somebody like that? True, I'd be confused too if I was sending a text and eating curly fries at the same time. Well, see, now you gotta understand about the curly fries. You gotta eat 'em while they're hot. You're funny. Funny, funny like what? I'm here to amuse you, funny like what? Ha-ha, just kidding. You married? See a ring on my finger? Get you something. - Here's my card. - Oh. Oh, okay. Oh... Oh, yes, yes. He'll see you now. Last door on the left. - Nice meeting you, Sheila. - Likewise. Jarvis: I'm so glad I got her out of my mind. That's too much. Oh. - Are you busy? - Am I busy? No, I thought you left already. Have a seat, come on. Thanks. Um, yeah, I was on my way out but I thought I'd stop by. Well, I'm glad you did, I mean, I... Look, I'm sorry for all that stuff the other day with Raven. It's okay, no, no, no, really, it's okay. I mean, I can understand why a girl can get all crazy and angry over you. Well, you know, I've been known to break a few hearts from time to time... Okay, just like a man. - Don't know when to shut up. - A little too much? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, you know... So... So when you coming back? Ah, I'm not sure. You know me, always chasing that story. Yeah, I'm chasing you and you chasing your career. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um... I guess this is goodbye then. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - It's goodbye. - It's goodbye again. Yeah. Well, take care of yourself. Oh, you know me, always taking care of myself. Let's... I have an extra ticket to the Dallas game. Courtside. Courtside? Did I stutter? Yvette, look. Even though I would love... and when I say love I do mean love... the idea of getting rid of all my worldly possessions and following you to the ends of the earth. I just can't right now. I mean, God has called me to a life of integrity and that's how I gotta be. I mean, I can't honestly give 100% to this until I have closure with Raven. And, I mean, this is how I am. Better yet... that's how God made me. I understand. That's... that's another one of the qualities that I love about you. You serve it straight up. It's just a double-edged sword sometimes. Take care. Hey, Raven, yeah, hi, yeah, it's me. Okay, all right, look, look, look, I need to talk... I need to talk... let me, can I speak? Can I speak, though? I need to talk to you about something serious. Where are we going with this relationship? Like, I am not gonna be your punching bag forever. Yeah, I just don't wanna play games anymore. Are you interested in trying to make it work? So it's over? Well, let it be over then, all right. But, look, look, look, I want my SpongeBob onesie back. No, that's mine, that's nonnegotiable. Yeah, oh, yeah, that's mine. Jarvis, look... I miss you so much and I'm not leaving without you. Not this time. You don't have to. Courtside it is. - Okay, let's go. - Oh yeah, we're gonna be late. Oh, yeah! Andrew, you tell the most fascinating stories. I never would've guessed you were a war hero. Well, not exactly, I mean, I was a military lawyer and I served during wartime but... Sounds like a war hero to me. Okay, I'll take that. So how was your meeting? You guys drive a hard bargain around here but honestly, you have made it all worth it. Those words just flow out of your mouth so smoothly. Keep talking. What time's your lunch break? Now. Ohh, and, um... I know the perfect place. It's on me since we just took all of your money. - Come on. - All right. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. It's been a while since I was able to spend time with someone like this, you know? Yeah, a man like you, I'm sure you have plenty of women around. You know, actually... I'm not really the type to have a lot of women around. I'm more of a... one-woman type of guy, you know? Okay. See, why didn't I meet you first? This is terrible. I would've chose you any day. Uh, that makes me feel good... sort of. So it's getting kind of late. I think you better go back to the office. I have to go to the mall before Randall gets back home. When will I see you again? Again. You'll see me soon. Well, I hope so. Oh, speaking of soon, I talked to Randall about approving your promotion. - You did. - Mm-hmm. That's wonderful. Look, don't thank me yet but I convinced him to give you a bonus when the deal goes through. We need to make a little side deal. Of course, what is it? Well, when the deal goes through, I need at least half. Randall is so slick. See, he has me in this little prenup that's so ironclad shut. He treats me like I'm a teenager and I'm a grown woman. I need zeros behind my bank account. You know what I mean? I got you... I guess, you know, um... Well, since you got me the job, I guess I would owe you something, you know? Good, exactly. I knew you'd see it my way. So I'm gonna have my lawyer draw up the contracts. Contracts? Look, pumpkin, let's not get business and fun mixed up. Okay? You take care of me, I'll take care of you. # Say what you wanna # # What was I doing? # # You're a married woman # # I was so lonely # # I can't deny # # You're a married woman # # I was taught # # Better than that # # I am so ashamed # # You're my boss's wife # # Lord what shall I do? # # You are you # # I am me # # We are differently # # Different styles # # Different taste # # I'm not like you # # I'm not like # # You ## Let's sit down here a minute. Sure. - Ahh... - Ohh... Thank you for the wonderful lunch. Oh, but unfortunately, I have to get back to this hell hole. Well, I will admit, our firm is a lot bigger, nicer, more successful, of course, and clean but honestly, you should be happy because a lot of people wish they had jobs. Hmm, yeah, I guess... I guess you're right. But you... I used to work at a shoe department at Dillard's before I came here but I don't feel like going back to those stank feet and those stank attitudes all day. Mmm, I hear that. Well, hey, just as a side note, my firm Peterson, Lewis and Kramer is expanding into the Midwest and we are aggressively seeking new lawyers and talent so just wanna put that bug in your ear. Well, this bug is buzzing. But, you know... my boss has been real good to me and not a lot of bosses would give you a two-hour lunch break. Um, so, um... Will I see you... will I see you again? I don't mean to be rude, but that is a mighty stupid question. What's your credit score? 800. Well, I guess I'll call you later. - Mmm, you do that. - Un-huh. Sir, you want to see me? Yeah, have a seat. You've been knowing me a long time, am I right? - Yes, sir. - Good. I'm not gonna beat around the bush. What are you trying to accomplish by dealing with my wife? Sir, I'm not trying to accomplish... Save it, save it, save it. Your number came up on her cell phone. What's going on? Sir, there's nothing going on. Let me tell you something. I want you to really hear me. My wife is a nice lady. Young... naive, very kind. And whatever you're trying to do by going around me to get to her, - is not... - Sir... It's not going to work. You understand me? I'm the boss here. When I make decisions, they're final. You understand? So go back to your office and get to work. That's the last thing I'm gonna say. Out of all the days I choose to leave my wallet in my gym shorts I choose today to do it. It's okay. Gosh, they said we can get on the next flight out. Don't beat yourself up. Beat myself up? I've been beat up enough for the last few years. And you don't ever have to worry about me beating myself up. - Jarvis. - Um... oh, you know what? Have a seat, look. I gotta holler at Elston real quick. I left my SpongeBob pillowcase at his crib. I gotta get it. - I can't fly without it. - SpongeBob? Yeah, SpongeBob. - There we go. - I'll be back, babe. Okay, I'll be here. Okay. Come in. Elston, what's wrong? I came right over as soon as I got the message. Thank you for coming. You look upset, what's wrong? I should've never started this with you. Come on, don't tell me... - Listen. - You getting cold feet. We're just getting started. Vanessa, I've been putting my job on the line. I've been lying and deceiving people, walking around here. - This is not who I am. - What? You think I put a gun to your head and made you do this? - You wanted this just as bad as I did. - Vanessa... Vanessa, I can't do this! I cannot do this, this is not who I am. So you think it's that easy. You're just gonna stand right there and say that you're done? No, I'm not an old toy. You can't just toss me aside like I'm a piece of dirt! I never said you were an old toy, Vanessa. Listen... You're gonna listen to me and you're gonna do exactly what I say to do. Otherwise, I'm gonna ruin your career at this firm and you will never make another dime again. Now, Elston, I need you to sign that contract and I need you to sign it now. Get out! Get out, now! Sheila: You heard the man, you heard him. Get out. Boy, man, I thought I was devious, but you? You take the cake, honey, and all that money you gave me, I'm giving it back. - This... - I'm no longer into that. My life is a parade. - Parade? - Long story. You know what? This isn't over. You know we gotta tell him, right? - Are you out of your mind? - Mrs. Simmons? - Pinkie toe? - Mm-hmm. She's my sister in the Lord now, you know. And she always says that the Bible says: "First go and be reconciled with your brother. " Sheila, how can you be quoting the Bible at a time like this? Yeah, I know. But it's never too late, you know, even with a past as long and colorful as mine. Yes, very long and colorful. Come on now, we gotta go, now, come on, stand up. Come on, hold your head up. Man up and let's go. Elston. Sheila, you know I love you like a sister. I love you too. And I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. All right, let's go. - Hey. - Hey, uh... I'm busy right now doing some reading. Can this wait? No, sir, it cannot. What's the problem? Okay, um... I'm just gonna go ahead and say it, um... I've been having an affair with your wife. Is that what you came here to tell me? Is this... is this some... some kind of game? Some kind of scam or something? Because my wife wouldn't do anything like that. No, no, no, I helped them too and I'm ashamed of it. And they didn't even pay that much. This... this... this is a joke, this is not true, okay, so... Of course, this isn't true. Oh. Okay, listen... Why would you do something like that? I treated you like my own son. Yes, Elston, why would you do something like this? Sir, I don't know why I did it but I did it, okay, and... I'm so sorry. I disappointed myself, I disappointed you and I'm ashamed. And I'm willing to suffer the consequences, sir. I'm so sorry. Is this true? Of course it's not true, for goodness sakes. I treated you like a queen, is this true? Oh, come on, man. Yo, tell me this is a lie, E. You was about to get a promotion. I have here on my phone all the pictures and text messages that she sent... - Give me that! - No, no, no... Jezebel! I'm sorry, sir. Why would you do this to me? You're gonna stand here and lie about it. Wow. I want you out of here. Talk to my lawyer in the morning. Go to my house. Give your keys to my housekeeper. You're the worst. As for you... I trusted you. I treated you like my own son. You lying, conniving little punk. I want you to go clean your desk out and leave your keys on top. Let me tell you something. If I was 20 years younger... Randall, Randall, Randall! Randall! You ain't kickin' nobody, homey. We're from Cabrini-Green. Everybody get out. Get out! Get out of my office! Get out! Let's go. Get out of my office. I am not your toy or your trophy. You just give me chump change. Do you know, all you did... Randall, was work, work, work, work. That's all you did. I needed some attention. I felt so worthless. All that money you make, you don't think I deserved any? I'm your wife. I want you out. Get out of my office before I call the cops and have them take you out. Get out of my office. - Get out of my office. - Take it. Elston: I feel so terrible. And you should, Johnny Heartthrob. - Slow down. - Jarvis. What, we can't talk about the truth around here anymore? Okay, what you did was horrible. I mean, but we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Did you ask him to forgive you? A million times. You only have to ask Him once. I love you no matter what and so does He, big bro. You always know what to say, huh, sis? Yeah, ain't she the best? Ooh, sorry, that's my man. - Gotta go. - Wait, wait, whoa, your man? Let him in, I want to see his wedding ring. Let him in, come on. I told you, I'm done with all that. I don't air your dirty laundry, Mr. SpongeBob. Hey, uh, don't go there. Everybody, this is Andrew. Wait, he's from the Stevens firm. She's sleeping with the enemy. It's okay, guys, we're on neutral territory. For now, at least. Yo, Elston, hide the paperwork. How are you, man? I'm Elston. - Pleasure. - Please to meet you. Hey, listen, I'm gonna be straightforward. Sheila told me what happened, and, hey, I know all about your extensive trial experience with Trace. And, you know, pretty sure, you know, since now you're technically unemployed that the partners at our firm could make you a handsome offer to come on board with us because, honestly, we could use a guy like you. - As a partner? - Absolutely. I mean, board has to approve, of course but I'm sure it'll sail through. Because, honestly, Elston, you're, uh... reputation is very solid in Chicago. Okay, um... - Give me your card and... - Yeah. ...we'll go over some details on Monday. - Sure. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Monday. Monday, Monday morning. As in 7:55 early Monday morning, bright and early, you know, and make sure your junior attorney - sends over the documents ASAP. - Jarvis. - Jarvis. - ASAP. Come on, Andrew, let's go before we miss the movie. Okay. - 'Cause we gonna get together. - Okay, all right. - Pleasure. - Pleasure, man. Hey, Monday. You better go ahead, girl. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get my SpongeBob pillow 'cause, uh... I got me a flight to Dallas to catch. - Dallas? - Yeah. Courtside, bro. Wait, now look it, man. Take care of her, man. Yeah, man, you know, the Bible says, "When a man findeth his wife "he keepeth it, 'cause it's a good thing. " You know, and, uh, I'll be damned if I let this good thing get away from me again. Amen, brother. So we gonna go. All right. I'll call you when we land. - Love you. - I love you too. I know where you live, Jarvis. - Hey, I know, I know. - Get it right. I don't want any trouble. I'm not here for any trouble. Just wanted to talk. Come in. You're welcome to have a seat. No, I'm... too keyed up to sit down. I'd rather stand. Look, um I've had a lot of time to think. Calmed down. Now I think I'm thinking straight. Well, I'm glad one of us can think straight. You know, the truth is, uh... I had suspicions about her all along. Hmm. But I was just blinded by her beauty. I was trying to convince myself not to think about it. But I knew eventually it would all blow up in my face. I don't know what to say. There ain't nothing to say. You know, uh oh, she's beautiful. We didn't have a lot in common. You know, she likes that... just that booty-shaking rap music. That stuff they play on the young people channel. You know, I am... I'm more of a... a Luther Vandross man myself. I understand. We didn't have anything to talk about. It was all a facade. I mean, she made me feel young again. I put her up on a pedestal. But I knew... I knew it wasn't real. I didn't spend any time with her. So, um... what are you gonna do? Yeah, that's the question. You know, I want you to know something. You weren't the first. She's had about three affairs. I just didn't want to know. Well, I wish I knew you didn't wanna know. That's well said, young man. You know what you did was wrong. And I want you to know that it hurt. But I respect you as a man for taking responsibility for the mistakes that you've made. God knows I've made my own mistakes. I can't give you your job back but I want you to know that you were instrumental in helping me build my firm. So I want you to have this. What is it? Open it. It's a check. Sir, this is, uh... this is very generous, sir, but I can't take this. No, I want you to take it. Remember... Do I owe you something? Remember that? Yup. Well, I want you to know you did a great job in helping me build my firm. So I'm not giving you that. You earned it. I'll let myself out. Sir... Thank you. I know that I can't do anything to make... the past right again but I'll do everything to make it right in the future. Yeah... maybe. Maybe after this all passes, who knows? Maybe one day we'll be friends again. Maybe. But right now, I've gotta go and put my life back together. Thank you. The Rammer Jammer will turn into some horrible chain restaurant. Unless we were to pool the money. You mean together? Lord have mercy. Some things that you left at my place. This doesn't mean that I forgive you. See you around. Are you okay? The MRI was totally clear. LEMON: I saw you looking at Lavon and Ruby. I've been keeping you from him. Go fight for your man. Before you make any decisions, I'm throwing my hat in the ring, too. Yours is the only hat in the ring, AnnaBeth. Ruby left. I told her I have feelings for someone else. GEORGE: Part of me couldn't stand Jonah being with you. Because? Because he doesn't appreciate you, Zoe. He's not going to see how special you are. DASH: Mayor Hayes. LAVON: Yeah? Now, this is the second Sunday that the people of this town had to line up like Soviets for post-church pastries. We need our eggs, we need our bacon. We need our grits. Now, now, Lemon and Wade are filling out the final paperwork right now. The Rammer Jammer will be open in a couple days. Wade Kinsella and Lemon Breeland owning a business together? Better get used to living on muffins. Wade and Lemon are BlueBellians, and we will support them. But, you know, maybe we should all practice cooking our own breakfast, just in case. Man, we are going to be huge. I cannot believe that this is actually happening. And I agree: huge. And who cares that everybody thinks we're going to crash and burn, right? They do? Uh, yeah. Oh, I guess people are more forthcoming with you. But, for now, the important thing is easier than she imagined. She stated that she has no interest in what will happen to her. Said she didn't want a lawyer nor any form of defense, being aware of what she did and requests no pardon. That's all she said. (THEME SONG PLAYING) Why aren't you at work? Luschek never showed. Probably passed out in his own vomit somewhere. So you chose to come in here and help? Yeah. Figured you could use it. It's Thanksgiving. Then get your ass off my counter and help Gina pull the turkeys out of the freezer. Shit, we got real turkey this year! We got trimmings from the factory. 50 cents a pound. Trimmings? Jesus. The shit no one else wants. That's a bag of turkey assholes right there. The whole meal has to come in at $1.05 a prisoner. Taxpayers don't give a shit if it's a holiday. We're the bad guys. Pig-fucker. Brown the onions for the gravy. SOPHIA: That too hot, baby? No, it's perfect. I feel so good. SISTER INGALLS: "Frequent blinking may actually be a way "for your brain to rest while you're awake." Wakeful rest, huh? You okay, honey? (VOICE BREAKING) It's just being touched by another person. - SOPHIA: I get it. - Thanks. The body gets lonely in here. Yeah. It's not even sex, you know? I just... I miss contact. Human beings aren't supposed to live like this. I've been in almost two years and there's still nights I reach out for my wife. You know, I was thinking about you guys. And I was imagining what I would do if Larry told me that he wanted to be a woman. I'd like to think that I would be open to it, but it would just be so weird. I'm sorry, is that totally rude? No. It's fine. He would make such an ugly girl. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Is he coming to visit you today? First holiday in prison can be rough. Very emotional. SOPHIA: But she's gonna be fine, 'cause we about to make some Heidi Klum shit happen right here. (CHUCKLES) (SNIFFS) Ugh, that smells nasty. What's it made of? You don't wanna know. (GROANS) How did you learn all this? My aunt was a santera. I used to help her out sometimes. I dabble. So what's gonna happen to me? You're gonna cramp up, some wicked diarrhea. This shit ain't pretty. You drink this, then you're gonna go out and dig a hole in the yard. You're gonna make me shit in a hole? No. You're gonna put this bean in there. Then you're gonna find a cigarette, you're gonna blow some smoke in there, you're gonna cover it up with a mound of dirt. And that's gonna have to do it, because I don't have any angelica or gris-gris oil. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Take it. This is gonna kill it? Well, that's what you want, right? As long as it don't feel anything. Please. It don't even have a brain yet. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hurry up, drink it. DAYANARA: Ow, that's hot! GLORIA: I told you it was, stupid. Go ahead, drink it all. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Where my Snickers? You know, I pray for all the dead babies and all their baby souls. (SOBS) And God, he's gonna let them into heaven, even though they weren't baptized. - Are you getting all of this? - Yeah. And you can also tell Judy that I pray for her as well. Well, her name's Barbara. - Barbara? - Barbara. Damn! I can't keep all this fan mail straight. (STUTTERS) I can't keep up with it. What? You have fans? - She's a hero. - (ALEX SCOFFS) She's a defender of the unborn. Jeez, that sounds like a bad X-Men movie. What'd you do, bomb an abortion clinic? And you can sign off with, "I will be out of here by 2015, "before the rapture." (CHUCKLING) Oh, man. Is something fucking funny to you? Yeah. It's just that people predict the rapture all the time. I mean, wasn't that supposed to happen in 2011? No. (STUTTERS) It comes in two stages. If you study your shit. The first one was a spiritual rapture. And the second one coming is a physical one. Ah, I see. - Okay? - Got it. And you're not invited, because they don't allow gay people on the rapture bus! There's a bus? Are all the seats already taken by Appalachian meth-heads? Oh, man, you're gonna... You're just gonna get it, Vause, aren't you? Do we have to go back to the dryer? You already locked me in that fucking dryer. Yeah, maybe I'll fucking turn it on this time. Make you spin around like a gerbil. Wanna know why? 'Cause I've had it with rich bitches like you. JESSICA: Those are bobos! Real Adidas have three stripes, not four. Your shoes are bobos. So? So your mom shops at Payless. And works at Friendly's. (GIRLS LAUGH) My mom has, like, four jobs. That's not something to brag about. You dress like a bum. She smells like one, too. (GIRLS GIGGLE) (CAR HORN HONKS) JESSICA: Do you guys live in that janky car? (CHUCKLES) - Bye-bye, pigsty! - Bye-bye, pigsty! (GIRLS GIGGLE) DIANE: Are those your friends? No. How was school? They changed the schedule around, so I don't gotta work nights no more. Fucking Brenda keeps trying to get me to cover her shifts. What are you doing? It's freezing out. DIANE: What the fuck was that? I'm not wearing those anymore. They're bobos. Go get 'em back. Jessica Wedge says they're lame. So fuck Jessica Wedge. They all make fun of me. They call me pigsty. Did you tell them who your dad is? I've never even met him. Well, you tell them. You tell them, "My dad is Lee Burley, the drummer for Death Maiden." You see what those smug little bitches say then. I mean, who are they, huh? What? 'Cause their parents work at the college, they think they're all fucking fancy? You are the daughter of a rock god. If he's so rich and famous, why are we so broke? You know how many girls used to scream at his concerts? You know, rip their clothes off? Throw themselves at him? But your dad chose me. And together we made you. Now go get your fucking sneakers. Don't you listen to those smarty-pants assholes. They're gonna have boring-ass lives. They're gonna wish that they were you. You are cool. PORNSTACHE: Listen up, turd-bags! We're gonna let you have your little going-away party, but do not make our lives more difficult afterwards by hanging yourself, with a sheet, or a tampon string, or whatever the fuck you like to get all arts and craftsy with. No Thanksgiving suicides. Chapman, what are we not to do on this day of thanks? Commit suicide? Exactly. We are the Pilgrims, you bitches are the Indians. This is the holiday where we cooperate. BIG BOO: Oh, yes. We bring you maize, and you give us small pox blankets. Exactly. Everybody wins. You look like JonBenet Ramsey. (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Well, that's what I was going for. Can you hold this for me? Yeah. Did you make this? Mmm-hmm. It's my second attempt. I spelled it wrong the first time. (ALEX CHUCKLES) And they say you went to college. (CHUCKLES) God, I hate seeing people go. It reminds me how much time I have left. PIPER: Yeah. But think of the story that you'll have. That is my line. I know it is. You always trot it out in times of suckiness. Yeah. Like that stomach virus I had in Java. Oh, it was a great fucking story. The whole village came out to watch you poop. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Hmm. So maybe this is kind of like that. Yo, yo, she coming, y'all! Taystee! ALL: (CHANTING) Taystee, Taystee, Taystee! I'm getting out, bitches! (ALL CHEERING) Yeah. Fight the power! Fuck the man! Hey! Watch it. Hey, yo, come here. Girl, you my shawty. Aw! Cut it out. You scrubby little hood rats gonna make a bitch cry. (BOTH CHUCKLING) (RB MUSIC PLAYING) I'll miss you, bitch. Yeah, girl. (INMATES CHEERING) My God, do you remember this? Yes. I don't even know how the arms go. I think... - (INMATES LAUGHING) - POUSSEY: What the fuck? Shit, these white girls trying to throw down. (INMATES CHEERING AND LAUGHING) JANAE: Yeah. BLACK CINDY: Yeah, girl! BIG BOO: Shake that ass. That's lesbian activity. INMATE: Yeah! It sure is. TAYSTEE: White girls gone wild. INMATE: Oh, my gosh. They're sexing, Mr. Healy. I seen it. This morning, in the bathroom, one girl's face was all up in the other one's hoo-ha. It was so nasty. It's an abomination. Okay, enough. They were moaning and everything. Speaking in tongues, like it's some kind of revival. Who? Who are you talking about? Vause and Chapman. - Chapman? - Mmm-hmm. Chapman. She a lesbian. They lesbianing together. They're in there right now in front of everyone, dancing all up on each other. Show me. (INMATES CHEERING) Chapman! Get over here. - (MUSIC STOPS) - INMATE: Party's over. - We were just... - Shut your mouth, Chapman. You think it's appropriate to violate your fellow inmate? - Violate? We were just dancing... - I said shut your mouth! You asked me a question. That looked like attempted rape to me. - Take her to SHU. - PORNSTACHE: Uh... What? You can't do that. Yeah, she's kind of right. Shut up, Mendez! You know, I'm tired of your shit. I'm your superior fucking officer! Now, you put her in the goddamn box, or I will fucking write you up, too! PIPER: No, no, no, no. - She didn't even do anything. - HEALY: Step back! Or I will cite you for assaulting an officer. PIPER: I have visitation today. Larry's coming to see me. - You can't do this. - PORNSTACHE: It's all right. - Let's do what the man says... - Please don't do this to me. ...before he has an aneurysm. Come on. PIPER: Please don't do this. PORNSTACHE: Come on! ABBY: Give me a shotgun! Give me a motherfucking shotgun, motherfucker! This is you. How long am I gonna be in here? Till we let you out. So tomorrow's the day. My cousin was supposed to send me my dress-out pack, but it never came. Now I gotta wear the same shit I came in here with. Man, it's gonna be too tight. (CHUCKLES) Man, you can walk out of here in a garbage bag, you'll still be dancing all the way to the bus. I'm scared. Nothing out there gonna be scarier than this shit. Shit, I been in institutions my whole life. I was a ward of the state till I was 16. Then juvie. I got no skills. MISS CLAUDETTE: Well, now you're just lying. You've worked in that law library for two years. You know more than my public defender. Yeah, but out there, you need real school for that stuff. (VOICE BREAKING) No one's gonna take me serious. MISS CLAUDETTE: You're a smart girl. You like to play the clown, but you've got a lot to offer this world. This is not a life, Taystee. Yo, listen to Voodoo Mambo, yo. Hey, yo, you think you just having... What they call it? That thing that happens to animals in captivity where it changes they brains? I seen it at the Bronx Zoo once. This giraffe ate its own vomit, banged its head up against the bars. 'Cause it ain't fit to live in the wild no more. Don't know how to eat leaves. That's what I'm saying. I'm the giraffe. Fuck no, you ain't. Giraffes skinny. Look at that ass. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Yo, don't let 'em get to you, T. This ain't where it's at. Jed and Lane are flying in from Chicago tonight with the kids. Will Grammie be there? Grammie's gonna stay in North Carolina. She's got a boyfriend. No shit! Suzanne. Sorry, language. I know I'm a mess. I've been cooking at the soup kitchen at church. Sweet potato casserole? - Yeah, I'm a one-trick pony. (CHUCKLES) - Hmm. See, you're back at church. I told you, people will get over it. - Well, there's a new pastor. - Hmm. He's been really welcoming. Very nice. He introduced me to a money manager, who gave me some free advice on how to talk to the bank. And he's sweet with Michael. Um... Eva stopped by the salon. She's pregnant. You know, she's been trying for a long time. You like him? This pastor? He's a good man. That's not what I'm asking. I'm not gonna talk about this. It's Thanksgiving. Well, I wanna talk about it. What do you want me to say? That I met someone and I'm interested? That I'm lonely and I miss men? When you went away, you told me... I know what I said. Baby, I don't want some strange man around my son, my wife. Well, we don't always get what we want now, do we? - What about your hair? - Mommy! I happen to like my hair like this. (SIGHS) Hi. (CLEARS THROAT) - Here to see Chapman? - Yep. You two are such a cute couple. She's the cute one. I'm like her furry sidekick. (CHUCKLES) Oh, um... Actually, you can't see her today. Why not? She's had some privileges revoked. - She's in the Security Housing Unit. - The what? Solitary? (STUTTERS) She's in solitary? What did she do? I'm sorry, I can't tell you that. I don't... (STUTTERS) This is ridiculous! I need to speak with your manager, or your superior, whoever the fuck is in charge here, please! Please don't swear at me. I can give you a number to call... Is she okay? Can't I just see her for a minute? I mean, it's a holiday, for God's sake. Okay, can you at least give my phone number to her counselor, Mr. Healy? Okay? And have him call me? Right away, he needs to call me right away. - Uh, I'm not allowed to... - Please. Please. - I guess, maybe. - Thank you. Thank you! Do you have... Can I... - I'll pass it along. - Okay. And if you see Piper, will you tell her that I love her? Okay? And to call me. Have her call me. And also (HALTINGLY) that I love her. Okay. Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Bloom. SHANNON: Motherfucker! INMATE: Shut up! SHANNON: (BANGING) Motherfucker! I'll kill you, motherfucker. SHANNON: I'll kill all you motherfuckers! INMATE: (CRYING) I'm gonna kill myself if I can't get out of here. (INMATE YELLING) (INMATE BANGING AND SHOUTING) (INMATE SCREAMING) My brother, Donny, shot a turkey last year, but it weren't really a turkey. It was a fucking bald eagle. (BOTH CHUCKLE) But he still shoved a Coors Light up the damn thing's ass and put it on the grill. (CHUCKLES) And proceeded to eat it. And when the ranger walked up, he had the bird hanging out of his mouth. He took his ass right to jail. And now he's in Federal, in Virginia. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Did it taste like chicken? No, it tasted like an eagle. (LEANNE CHUCKLES) (PENNSATUCKY CAWS) (BOTH CHUCKLE) Was your brother smoking tina? He snorts Oxy now. Fuck you. What the... Get the... The fuck! (YELPS) (SPITS) ALEX: Thanks for last night, baby. That shit was amazing. Nobody's ever licked my pussy like that. You are lying! I would never touch this bitch! Hey, knock it off! You wanna join your friend down the hill? PENNSATUCKY: You know, you're going to hell! And you're gonna burn there for the entire eternity! - I'm already there. - BENNETT: Have a seat. (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Taste it, Norma. - (SLURPS) - What did I tell you? It's damn near perfect. Ladies! Listen up! It's time to leave. Let's go! Everybody out, except for you. You can stay. Let's go, Silent Bob. That means you, too. Come on. It's okay, I'll take over. PORNSTACHE: Attagirl. (TURNS OFF STEREO) Where's my shit, Red? I don't know what you're talking about. Really? Are you gonna make me look through every box in here? How'd you do it? You stopped the truck? Maybe. Or maybe I got it from one of your girls. My girls wouldn't tell you shit. Huh. You want your pills? You can go stick your head in the toilet. There might be a few still floating around. You listen to me, you crazy cunt! The next time my shipment comes in, you're gonna put it to the side, top shelf, in the walk-in. Tricia's in detox. I hear Caputo's looking for her source. What would he think of your little operation? You mean, your operation? All the contraband comes through your kitchen. Looks like we're at a Cold War stand-off, Ruskie. And I got a bigger weapon than you. You wanna see it? (UNZIPS) (URINATING) (SIGHS) (ZIPS) Just a little something extra for the holidays. Next time you fuck with my stash, I'll end your life. (PHONE RINGING) MALE OPERATOR: Hello? Hi! Yes, hi. Hello, I am trying to reach the Executive Assistant or the Assistant Warden, please. Sir, it's after duty hours. Okay. Yes. Look my wife is in the solitary unit. Okay? She's being held there illegally. Now, my father is a lawyer, I know her rights. It's a holiday, sir. Exactly! That's exactly right! I know it's a holiday. That's what makes this so outrageous. You can call back on Monday... Would you please listen to me? Sir, please. Listen to me. I have left messages for the Associate Warden, for the Public Information's Officer, for the Department of Corrections, for the fucking Governor's office. Okay? If I don't get a call back from somebody soon, you people are gonna have a fucking lawsuit on your hands. Now... FEMALE VOICE: Hello, you have reached the Federal Correctional Institution in Litchfield. God! Fuck! Dude, that was really dramatic. (SIGHS) You know how much Piper loves Thanksgiving. It is her favorite. Yeah, I don't know why. Had to wear a suit jacket. Fucking toxic. You've been to Thanksgiving with my parents. Yeah, no, I know, it's horrible. She loves our Thanksgivings. Oh, in your parents' apartment? They go to South Beach. They have gravy boats. A maid comes and cleans up in the morning. Come on. They won't mind me using these awesome tchotchkes for my table-scape, will they? We have to cancel. We have to cancel. You have to cancel the whole thing. Cal, (STAMMERS) I can't host people here, all right? Not under these circumstances. All right? It does not feel right. No, yeah, you're right, man. We should cancel. We'll cancel. We'll cover the mirrors, sit shivah. It's what your people do, right? It's when someone dies, Cal. She's not dead. Exactly. Look, I love my sister, dude. But she got herself sent to the hoosegow. And now she's clearly pulled some other shit to get herself into even more trouble. You have done everything that you can do. And Piper would love the fact that you're throwing Thanksgiving, our friends are coming, the maid is coming tomorrow. And I've spent my entire life-savings on this, this marvelous turkey. She'd want us to celebrate. I'm sure she's fine. (BANGING) (SHANNON SCREAMS) Chapman? Mr. Healy? How are you? I'm in a cement box and people are screaming. You needed a little time-out to think about your behavior. My what? I was dancing. Provocatively. Sexually. Gay sexually. This is illegal. You can't keep me in here. See, there's where you're wrong. Chapman, I tried to be nice to you, because I understand where you come from. You don't know me. I thought we could be friends. You're not yourself lately. You're acting out. So you're teaching me a lesson? You should be thanking me. Alex Vause is sick. I get you. You're not like her. The only sicko here is you. And under different circumstances, what? I'd be your girlfriend? Is that it? Did I make you jealous? You put me in this hellhole for no reason. Wake up, Healy! Girls like me? We don't fuck ignorant, pretentious old men with weird lesbian obsessions! We go for tall, hot girls, and we fucking love it! So that leaves you on the outside, living your sad, sad little life. You don't get me! Ever! So go fuck yourself! Happy Thanksgiving, Chapman. SHANNON: Fuck you, motherfucker! Where's my mattress? Where the fuck is my mattress? What did you do to it? (SNORTS) Oh, fucking crackhead. My bunkie stole my mattress. Yeah. And? It's gone. It's not there. Then how do you know it was stolen? Because it's not on my bed, and she and her hick friend have been fucking with me. I need a new one. Okay, we issue one mattress per inmate. You can fill out a form. It'll take a couple weeks to replace it. And what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Sleep on the frame? It's probably good for you. A hard surface aligns the vertebrae. Your body will thank you. Excuse me. (LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Who are you? I'm Alex. I'm your daughter. Holy shit. How'd you find me? Well, I saw the show. And then the manager sent me back here. Oh, you saw that shit? That was embarrassing. We can't even fill a fucking basement anymore. If one more jerk-off asks me to play Dirty Girl... I wish I had never written that fucking song. It is a great song. That is still a great song. Shut up, Lonnie. We're supposed to be in Philly, but Jimmy over here punched the booking agent in the neck. I can't believe you're my kid, man! You're my kid! I'm so happy to see you. Yeah. Me, too. 'Cause I would've never recognized you in a million years. And you got a serious rack on you, too. I mean, I could have accidentally fucked her, right? But that would have been bad. No. Seriously, that's twisted. I didn't say that. Um, is there a bathroom? Is there a bathroom? (CHUCKLING) It's down there. Right. Thank you. LONNIE: Her rack? That would've been fucked up. Wow. LONNIE: (LAUGHING) Her fucking rack. (SIGHS) (SNIFFLING) Jesus, you scared me. You okay? I'm fine. I'm just gonna go home. He's not what you thought. It's fucking depressing. (SCOFFS) Been imagining this moment your whole life? I had this white fringe pleather jacket I always thought I'd wear if I ever met him. Nice, pleather. (CHUCKLES) What happened? You're right. Maybe that would've made the difference. Most people are better in the abstract. It's Alex, right? Yeah. Fahri. You want a bump? (CHUCKLES) No, thanks. Smart girl. Fahri, what are you doing hanging out with these losers? Uh... They're my clients. What do you do? I work for an international drug cartel. (LAUGHS) Right. (GROANS) Will you get Gloria? I'm dying. You're not dying. Here. Serves you right for drinking some stupid potion from some half-assed santera. Who told you? She told me. So I told her to give you some roots and berries. Make you shit your brains out and learn your lesson. So the tea was bullshit? It's not gonna work? You think I'm gonna let you ice my grandbaby? You want me to end up like you? I'm already in prison. All I need is five different baby daddies and an ass tattoo of a dog. It's a wolf. Daya, I made mistakes, okay? I didn't have nobody teaching me what to do. Oh, get away from me. Maybe I'm not the mother of the year... Oh, you think? But at least I put something into this world that could still be good. I made something. I fucked up my own life, but Eva, Lucy and Christina, Emiliano, even you could still be something. Babies give you hope. Fuck. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh, my God. There's mold. There's mold on the bologna. Oh, my God. VOICE: I found a maggot. Hello? Is someone there? VOICE: Are you real? Yes. Yes, I'm real. Are you real? VOICE: I don't know. I'm gonna take a bus all the way to the Bronx. Right to Angelo's Pizza and I'm gonna get a giant slice with the works. But just one, because after, we're gonna have a big old Thanksgiving at my cousin, Neicey, house, and we probably gonna go out dancing at the Monte Carlo Room, and I'ma order a Sex on the Beach with 10 maraschino cherries in it. And some man gonna buy it for me. (BOTH LAUGH) Well, that sounds like a plan. You know, ain't no one on the outside gonna do my 'do for a can of Pepsi. Which you still owe me, by the way. (CHUCKLES) Jefferson, they're releasing you now. Van's leaving. Right now? I gotta say my goodbyes. It's a holiday. cos wanna go home and see their families. If you don't go now, you're not getting out till Monday. Let's go. Yo! Where's Poussey at? Jefferson! Now. What the fuck? What the fuck? They already took her? I didn't even say goodbye. Taystee! Yo! (BANGING) Tays! She can't hear you. (BANGING) (CHUCKLES) (INMATES CHUCKLING) - POLLY: Hello? - Hello! - PETE: Hello! Whoo-hoo! - Hi! Come in, new family. (KISSES) Hello, happy Thanksgiving. - Ooh, your parents have a nice place. - Yeah. - Cal! - Hi. - Hi. Do you know Pete? - Mmm-mmm. No. And this is Finn. Wow. He looks like Steve Buscemi. Congratulations, man. PETE: Gotta wash your hands first. LARRY: Isn't that just to touch the baby? And to touch me, too. Polly's being a total nutter. If it were up to Pete, he'd let him suck on the bottom of his shoe. I hope you guys don't mind, but we brought a stray. - Larry, this is our friend, Maury. - Hi. Yeah, Maury Kind. I'm sorry, you're not a stray. You're Maury Kind from NPR! - Guilty. - Oh, my God, I love you. I love your show. I mean, I love... (STUTTERS) I love you. - (CHUCKLES) Thank you. - POLLY: Wow. - Back off, Larry. - LARRY: Sorry, sorry. Where should we put our stuff? Put it in the kitchen, follow me. You come meet my girlfriend! Don't get in her way, Cal! She's got an angry, red vagina and she's been drinking rum punch since 10:00 a.m. Thank God we pumped. I cannot believe you brought Maury Kind. Yeah, I'm mixing sound on Urban Tales. He's going through a divorce, so I invited him. I didn't know you'd geek out so hard. You know, I'd love to talk to him. Well, it'd be weird if you didn't. Besides, he read your "Modern Love" column and loved it. - Stop it. Seriously? - Uh-huh. Holy shit. PETE: Hey! Your language. Huh? Sorry. Shh. PIPER: What an asshole. I cannot believe people like him are even allowed to work here. They take these insecure, and frustrated men and they put them in charge of a bunch of powerless women and they become these predatory creeps. I mean, all of that condescending "I know what's best for you" bullshit. VOICE: You can rage, but they always win. They're the ones with the keys. How long have you been down here? I've lost track. I don't know. Nine months? A year? A year? That's insane. VOICE: They keep the lights on, so you lose all sense of time. It's not living. I mean, yeah, you're breathing, but you ain't a person no more. It's bad. You start to see shit that ain't there. You start to hear voices. Oh, my God. They keep you here till they break you. (GULPS) I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Why did I do that? Why did I say those things? He's never going to let me out of here. I am so fucking stupid. I am so fucking stupid! What's wrong with me? (SOBBING) VOICE: You still there? I swear to God that if they let me out of here... I will shut up. I will shut up and I will put my head down and I will do my time and I'll smile at Healy and I (CRYING) won't go near her. I won't even look at her. I can do that. I can do that. I can. Please. Please don't leave me here. Please. Hey, Vause, I know you're not working, but can I get my bag? Yeah, just give me a sec. What happened to your glasses? (MIMICKING PENNSATUCKY) Smashed in the name of Jesus. Oh, shit. Pennsatucky? Wow, you guys have released the kraken. She's decided it's her Christian duty to annihilate me. Because I'm a "privileged rich girl." (SCOFFS) Which is hilarious, because those types of girls tortured me my whole fucking life. If you and I had met in fifth grade, you'd have made fun of my clothes. - (LAUGHS) - Who, me? No, no, no, no. I would never. You look terrific. (SIGHS) Fuck! (NICKY CHUCKLES) I know what you were like. Upper West Side, doorman building, skiing in Jackson Hole. Am I wrong? - Who told you that shit? - No one. My business was built on sniffing out girls like you and turning 'em into drug mules. I knew it. You're a pimp. Man, you would've been perfect. Little Nicky at 19? Mmm! I would've turned you out in two seconds. I'd make a terrible mule. I would've done all your drugs. (ALEX CHUCKLES) Besides, okay, what makes you think I would've fallen for your shit? Well, you grew up rich, so you're used to easy money. You have enough stamps in your passport to avoid suspicion. - You hate your parents. - Yeah, totally. You're in your experimental phase. All you wanna do is fuck a woman or black guy, - have some adventure... - Hmm. (CHUCKLES) ...and still be able to afford a Birkin bag. - Shit, I'm in! - (CHUCKLES) Fuck it. You know me. Sign me up. Oh, was that who Piper was? No, no, Piper was different. Why? 'Cause you loved her? Because she was different. Get some glue, pimp. (SIGHS) Fuck. Crystal is in love with her pastor. Ah. (CLICKS TONGUE) I'm not surprised. A lot of women lust after their pastors, it's very common. And pastors can do that. Priests have to learn to bounce their eyes. Um, what's that? You never stay focused on a member of the opposite sex for too long. That's how I watch every Russell Crowe movie. (CHUCKLES) She wants my blessing. Then you should give it to her. Why? I don't understand why she needs to have sex. I mean, (CHUCKLES) look at you. I'm a nun, I took a vow. She married a man with a penis, I assume because she wanted to use it occasionally. (SIGHS) How much time do you have left? (SIGHS) Three years, eight months. You got what you needed at a pretty big cost to your family. This is what she needs. Doesn't Crystal deserve some happiness? Let her go. I can't. It's the right thing to do. (GUESTS LAUGHING AND CHATTERING) POLLY: Did you want some more sweet potatoes? So, Neri, what do you do? I'm a hyperbaric welder. Yeah, I used to work on the pipelines, but now I just normal weld. - Isn't she a badass? - (CHUCKLES) We met when I was fabricating some sculptures. Hmm, I have so many burn scars, Cal and I are naming them. Oh, oh! Speaking of scars, how was it? The whole birth thing? Did you eat your placenta? No. We passed on that. CAL: Oh, it's really good for you. Crazy nutrients. People dehydrate it and make it into pills, but that's the expensive way. I always just thought you could, like, scramble it up. (CHUCKLES) Just, like, put it in a pan with some salt and pepper. (POPS) Bam! It sounds gross, but possibly delicious. Throw some sage in there, too. - Do you still have it? - I don't. Pete, you're dropping food on his head. So, yeah, you know, we both decided to stick it out, you know. I mean, it hasn't been easy, but, you know, relationships are not easy. - Right? - Right. Yeah. Well, I thought your column was an interesting perspective. You know, the long-suffering husband. Fiance. I mean, I didn't really mean for it to come off that way. No. No, no, no, it was very entertaining. - Thank you... Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, I'm a big fan of yours. I mean... - Oh, well. Yeah, I love your show and... I was just listening to the one on road trips. Cal, the turkey is amazing. - It's perfectly cooked. - Thanks, man. It's a heritage bird. Actually, Maury, um... (STUTTERS) I was thinking that my story would work really well aloud. - Right. - You know, 'cause I consider myself a much better verbal storyteller. - Right. - You know, I don't know if you ever... Cal, what is a heritage... I'm sorry, what was that? Sorry. No, I didn't know if you ever were open to maybe doing a prison episode. You know, if you ever had guests like me on. Yeah. The thing is, if we wanted to document prison, we'd probably talk to actual inmates. And if we were gonna do a story about someone whose loved one was in prison, we'd find a more representative example. Cycle of poverty, that sort of thing. Right. Yeah, no, that... (STUTTERS) I get... That makes sense. I get it. But we are working on a show about unique long-distance relationships. You know, a guy who works down on the ice every year, a pair of married missionaries. Your story could be good on that. - Really? - Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I mean... Wow, I would love that. I mean, I would love to do that. CAL: Hey, toast! NERI: Yes! CAL: Toast. PETE: Cheers. - Happy Thanksgiving. - Happy Thanksgiving. Eye contact. (RB MUSIC PLAYING) (INMATES CHATTERING) BIG BOO: No gravy? Why is there no gravy? You complaining? Uh... No, ma'am. No, no, no. Come on, Little Boo. Let's not complain. I don't know why you threw it out. I tried it. It tasted great to me. I'm thankful for my health, for my strong body and mind. And for you girls, who remind me every day that self-forgiveness is possible. Hmm. I'm thankful that Taystee got the fuck out of this dump. Yeah, I'll second that. I'm thankful for my new bitch, Little Boo. Sit, hooker. Ah! Good girl. (CHUCKLES) There you go. (INMATES CHUCKLE) Oh, and, of course, I'm thankful for all y'all other bitches. (INMATES CHUCKLE) Do you wanna say grace, Sister? I trust in the Lord with all my heart and lean not on my own understanding. Amen. Amen. POUSSEY: Amen. Man, it sucks to get glasses replaced, you have to get someone on the outside to fill your prescription. (SCOFFS) How blind are you? Blindish. Bright side, you can't see the color of these potatoes. (CHUCKLES) It doesn't feel right to be eating while she's in there. Straight girls. (SCOFFS) They'll fuck you up every time. (INMATE SCREAMS) (SPITS) Hey! Hey. (KNOCKS) Did you get this loaf thing? (KNOCKS) Looks like three different dinners mushed together into a mound. Are you looking at it? Hello? Can you hear me? Please tell me that you're still there. CAPUTO: You can't leave her in there. I don't know what the hell she's doing in Seg in the first place. Christ, even Mendez said it was uncalled for and that guy lives to throw people in the box. - You're not my boss. - Today I am. Fig is on vacation. And I am telling you I don't have the write-ups or the paperwork to support it. She got under your skin, Sam. This is personal. She thinks she's running the place. You don't have to tell me that. Her fiance is raising a stink bigger than the shit I took this morning. Christ, he's probably got the Obamas on the phone by now. These liberal, wealthy offenders, they're connected. And if they review this, the paper trail is going to be sweaty. So do us all a favor and get her out of there. It's not even 48 hours. Get her out of there. (INMATES PRAYING IN SPANISH) GLORIA: Mmm-hmm. ALEIDA: Mmm-hmm. GLORIA: Mmm. ALEIDA: Mmm-hmm. I'm sorry you feeling like shit, chica, but I had to do it. It's okay. I'm relieved, actually. (WHISPERING) I wanna keep it. (SPEAKING SPANISH) But I don't wanna get him in trouble, though. Don't worry, nena. We'll figure something out. You're gonna have a baby. I'm gonna be a grandmother. (SIGHS) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? FEMALE VOICE: An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison is attempting to contact you. To accept the call, please press one. (BEEPS) SOPHIA: Baby? It's me. Uh, I'm just getting in the car. I'll just take a minute. I was wrong. You do whatever you need to do. You have my blessing. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. You Josie's girl? My cousin, Neicey, told me I could stay here. Neicey don't live here no more. And I know she ain't your cousin. We had the same foster family. Look, I ain't getting my ass in trouble letting some ex-con stay in my house. But I have to stay here. This is the address I gave my supervisor. The system gonna come check on me. That ain't my problem. I ain't got nowhere else to stay at. Shit. You can sleep in that corner. On the floor. Leave that mattress where it is. 'Cause I ain't having no rapey motherfuckers coming in off that fire-escape again. And you're out in the morning, understand? Hmm, Burset. Um... You gave me four. Yeah, new doctor. He said your chart was wrong. So you're back to your old dosage. Thank you. - Hmm? - Thank you. (CHUCKLES) Chapman! You're out. Back to camp. FISCHER: (KNOCKS AT DOOR) Mr. Healy? Piper Chapman's fiance came to visit while she was in lock-up. (SIGHS) And? He left his number, sir. I'm sorry, I know that's against the rules, but he wanted to know why she was in SHU. Okay. Thank you. I'll take that. (LINE RINGING) LARRY: Hello? Hello, Mr. Bloom? This is Counselor Healy from the Department of Corrections. I have some information that might interest you regarding your fiancee. (THEME SONG PLAYING) Holy shit, Chapman, you're out. Oh, my God... - Let's get out of here. - Are you okay? What are we doing here? (BOTH MOANING) Adam? Adam! (Ringtone) (Ringing) # Venez dans mes bras # Closer to me, dear # Donnez-vous a moi # Set aside all fear # Restons enlacés # Pour I'éternité # Yes, you shall be mine # Till the end of time Armed police! Clear! (Shouts) Guys? (Bleep) Chuks? GPS co-ordinates. He's giving us a location. CHUKS: OK. (Types) Vicarage Lane. About 10 miles from here. (Soft click) (Exhales heavily) That's Adam's, Elise. Some kind of negative ions thing. Maybe he's put it there to show us where he was. Yeah, trouble is, Kieran wants us to know where... What are you doing with my son? ! Think of what he wants you to do and do exactly the opposite. - Why hasn't he left us a message? - It's part of the torture. Karl? We can't lose focus. I used to work with him. OK. And why is he? He's a man who lost everything. All his truths stem from that. His real name is Kieran Ashton. - Why is he doing this to us, Karl? - I slept with his wife. (Sighs) When they were living in France she came to me to talk about his... decline. We only... Anyway, he knows. So now he feels betrayed... by... society, by the police. - And by his friend. - Yeah. Karl... I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. The last thing I would have ever wanted was for Daniella to get hurt. Well, she was. And all of it, the blood and the... the bodies, it all goes back to you. Don't do this. Please, just listen. I let myself believe there was something good in you, and I was wrong. I'm gonna tell the FBI everything I know. I just don't care. It's over. Fine. I won't stop you if that's what you want to do. But just know Stavos left me this message yesterday. I didn't get it until you gave me my phone. Listen. We have a problem. Trapani lied about the cartel. There is no truce. Trapani never even passed on your offer to pay Luke's debt. If they find out you killed their man without trying to negotiate, this is going to get ugly fast. An hour after he sent me this message, he and half my crew were gunned down... executed. It was Trapani who set me up. He didn't negotiate with the cartel. He sent the cartel. Why would he do that? Why do you think? He saw an opportunity to seize power, and he took it. Why do you think he told you about me? Trying to drive a wedge between us. Grace, the cartel may have pulled the trigger, but Al Trapani is the one who's responsible for your mother's murder. And if you want the bloodshed to end and you want justice, then you and me are gonna have to take him down. What would I have to do? No way. That's insane. You're the only one who can contact the Nogales cartel without involving Al Trapani. Yeah, of course they'd like to hear from me, so they can find me and kill me. All I'm asking you to do is use your Miami contacts to set up a meeting between me and Tiago Enriquez. He's cartel's lieutenant here in Chicago. This is crazy. Why do you think this guy will even meet you? Because I'm authorized to speak for Constantine. 'Cause I'm his daughter. So you know. Will you make the call? Grace, I'm just a real-estate guy who screwed up. -I shouldn't even be here. -And I'm a surgeon. We're both out of our element. I am asking you to help. How can I say no to my sister? What's that? Grace Devlin's phone records. So? Looks like you two are a lot closer than I thought. Until you left town a month ago, you spoke several times a day. The calls are highlighted. She's Constantine's doctor. I was gaining her trust. She has his ear. Cut the crap, Franco. You used to date. Isn't that right? Yeah, a long time ago. You just failed to mention it? It wasn't relevant. It ended the day I was recruited. You told her she was being investigated, didn't you? You lied to me, Franco. She's not just Constantine's doctor. She's under his thumb, and she aided and abetted outfit activity. I don't know. Okay. Well, then, let me tell you what I know. I know you still got the hots for Dr. Devlin and I know you two started up again recently. She helped me with my investigation. That's it. Then how do you explain CSU finding her fingerprints all over your safe house... You know, the motel room the bureau set you up in before you took off? I'm reporting you to the Attorney General's office. They're gonna press charges. I need your gun and your badge. If you're going after Grace, you're wasting your time. Well, that's not your call to make. I checked the back parking lot. There's no sign of him. He's late. We're not in a rush. When I told him we wanted to meet at the police station, he didn't seem too happy. Yeah, well, we need to be safe. You're sure he listened to Stavos' message? Yeah, it's the whole reason he agreed to meet. Here we go. Mr. Enriquez, I'm Grace Devlin. Constantine Alexander's daughter? That's right. And this piece of crap is Constantine's son? Yeah. Al Trapani... Seems he played me against Constantine. Is your father as pissed off as I am? Yeah, that's why we're here. What do you propose we do about it? Constantine is willing to forgo retaliation and give you free access to the West Side Eisenhower Expressway. It's worth millions. It's not his to offer. Al Trapani controls the expressway. In exchange, you'll agree to a truce and you'll forgive Luke's debt. You'll take the hit off of Luke, and you'll put it on Trapani. And you're telling me Constantine's got enough juice to take over the West Side from his hospital bed? Well, he owns enough aldermen to shift city council votes. He's got enough soldiers on the street to crush anyone who won't play ball. And the CPD will turn a blind eye, thanks to every cop he's got in his pocket. If I agree to this and Constantine doesn't keep up his end, we'll come after the both of you. You understand? You have my father's word and mine. It's done. Not yet. Which one of you shot my mother? Now we're done. Does the patient need Insulin? No, his sugar levels are fine. I just gave him a sedative. Can we have a moment, please? Of course, doctor. So, what happened? It's done. Enriquez will take care of Trapani in exchange for the Expressway, and Luke will get a free pass. Okay. That'll give us the breathing room we need until we're ready to make our move. What do you mean, "ready to make our move"? What do you think? Why don't you tell me? After the ambush, the cartel... they could have taken everything away from us. We had to trick them into a sense of security. All war is deception, Grace. And a war with the cartel is one we can't lose. But we're not losing 'cause we're not fighting. That's the deal we made. There is no deal. There never was a deal. It's all a tactic, an illusion. You used me? Well, if you knew the plan, you wouldn't have done it. And there is nobody that could have pulled this off like you, Grace... nobody. I don't want any part of this. You don't have a choice. Don't you see? You're my blood, my family. What is in me is in you. I'm tired now. I need to rest. I'm gonna need all my strength for the fight ahead. Nate. Grace. How's Constantine? Is he okay? Yeah, he's... He's doing good. Can I see him? Oh, he's... He needs his rest right now. I'm done. Yeah? Constantine, the organization... I don't want anything to do with it anymore. What about you? I made my decision a long time ago. I love you. I love you, too. ♪ Finger on the trigger, baby ♪ come on, take me down ♪ I drug your name across my wrist ♪ ♪ just to hear the sound ♪ want to feel the metal, hot, smoking on my lips ♪ ♪ take me low and take me high ♪ I just need a hit ♪ let's melt into the shadows until there's nothing left ♪ ♪ my blood spreads like a fire ♪ with your breath across my neck ♪ ♪ I'm not looking for a lover to be gentle through the night ♪ ♪ won't you be my killer? ♪ Keep me in your sight ♪ bang, bang, bang ♪ bang, bang, bang are you sure you're ready for this?

Danny O'Donoghue. Jessie J. And Sir Tom Jones. Wow! Now that is how you do it. And this is how we would do it. ♪ And it goes like this. ♪ 'Tonight, the coaches begin their search to find The Voice. 'They'll each choose a team of ten singers from a select group of the UK's best artists 'who have been invited to audition for our coaches. 'But, it won't be easy, because the coaches will have their backs to the artists, as they sing.' 'Our chairs are facing away from the stage, so we have no idea what's going on behind us.' We are blind. This is all about the voice. 'How an artist looks...' I've got more of a face for radio. '.. Their size...' Too short. Too fat. '.. Their age...' I'm 47. In the music business, that's pushing it. 'None of that matters! ' That's what's amazing. 'Only the voice counts.' This is how the show works. When a coach likes what they hear, they hit a button. Which turns their chair. And that artist wins a place on their team. I can't wait to work with you. I'm the one who can't wait to work with you. Yeah! However, if more than one chair turns, the power shifts, and the artist can decide which coach they'd most like to work with. You know we want you. Who do you want? The coaches need to do everything in their power to persuade the artist to join their team. It's fisticuffs at dawn. Pick me! Come on! 'But, if no coach turns, the artist is out of the competition.' What I need to stress, when we don't turn around, it's not because you're not a great singer, you are. It's just that we only get to pick ten. 'Each coach wants to discover the one artist who will win it all. 'A record deal with Universal Music, and the chance to be named The Voice.' The potential that this could change my life is huge. 'This is their moment.' 'It's now or never.' The blind auditions start now. Our talent scouts have invited the nation's most gifted vocalists to the blind auditions. And, as our artists begin to arrive from up and down the country, the anticipation is building. 17-year-old Belfast schoolgirl Jessica Hammond is hoping to swap teenage dreams for musical reality. Songwriting's always been kind of a way out for me. There's been a few incidences where I was getting picked on. I'd always come home and play my guitar. I used to say to her, "Jess, write down what you are worried about, "and then we'll read over it." So, now, she writes lyrics about it, and turns it into a positive. 'In my bedroom, I'm a superstar. And people are listening to me.' And I just imagine the raindrops on the windows, they're clapping for me. And I don't feel alone. 'I've chosen to sin Jesse J, Price Tag. 'Whenever it's a cover, you have to really look in and do your research, 'and think about the kind of message of the song, and what you're trying to say to people.' I definitely will put my heart and soul into this.

We need to make an album, and we need to put it out to where it's big, in the UK, America, Brazil, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Argentina... Russia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Ireland. He's like a lobster, giving it all that! I'm telling you, you need to come here, babes! Do you want to put your guitar down? It's stuck to me. Hold on. I'll be your roadie. I'll hold it for you. I will be your producer and your roadie. Thank you. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I don't mind carrying the guitar. I want to talk to you as if I was you when I was 17. There's things in your voice that remind me of me. I'm not going to sit here as Will said, and go, "You're going to do this," because I don't surround myself with yes men. You need... I'm being serious. That wasn't a yes man. Wait, wait, wait! No, no. She's blowing me up. Do you mind if I do something with your guitar? Let me talk. I can understand where you're coming from. You're a female, you're young. You don't understand how amazing it is for me to sit here and have someone like yourself sing one of my songs. What I will say is, number ones, albums, touring, all that stuff is a bonus, yeah? Music is where it should stem from, and that's something me and you could enjoy. I can't compete with that. You can, you're Sir Tom Jones. What I can compete with is this. This show is called The Voice, right? And the thing we have to concentrate on, if you come with me, is picking the right songs in order to win this thing. And I feel I can help you with that. So, here I am, babe. I understand guitar playing and singing, something I've done since I was your age, even before. And I really feel the musicianship coming from you. I think we would work incredibly together. I really do. You've got four coaches - you've got only one decision. That's the beautiful part of the show, you've got artistic control. I really hope you make the right decision and come with me. Um, Will... Ssssh. Let her decide! I appreciate everything you said. Um, I'm a songwriter, I'm only 17 and from Belfast. Number one hits don't matter to me, making music and sharing my message is what matters to me. Beautiful, beautiful. Um...

She's so good!

LIFE GOES ON Ok, yes... I see. What? You know what, I'll call you back later. Hey Chopin! Stop it with the polonaise. You already know the boss hates classical music. There's no way I can use the phone with all that noise. If Chopin is noise for you, then what do you call what I play here? Look, we'd starve with Chopin and Beethoven only. Keep playing what the boss likes and I'll keep discovering stars. - Discovering stars... - What? Didn't I discover you? Artists agency? Hugo? It's me, Ricardo. Yeah, that's what I wanted to know. Thursday 20? Perfect. And don't forget about The Mice. The Mice who? That long-haired guys band I showed you. See if you can find them a gig at a night club. Ok, bye. This Hugo never loses his sense of humor. He says he'll find The Mice a job at a cheese factory. Cheer up! You're singing at a rich woman's house the 20. Perhaps an important businessman will hear you and... Please, come on in Lolita. Come on. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Roberto, our pianist. Mr. Marin, artist manager. In case you need my services, here is my business card. Thank you, but I'm just a beginner. She came recommended by a TV channel director. Play that song. When you're done, come see me at my office, Lolita. - Can I have this? - Sure. - So? - Sorry, I always mess the intro. - Let's start over - Don't get nervous. Pretend you're singing alone... like when you shower. I have a whole world of sensations A whole world of vibrations And I can give them... Let's try with a lower key. I have a whole world of sensations A whole world of vibrations - So your name is Lolita, right? - That's right. But Mr. Mauricio wants me to change it. He says it doesn't sound good. What doesn't sound good here is what you're singing. Pardon my honesty, but you'll never be a singer. Don't waste your time. Give it a shot as an actress, perhaps model. But Mr. Mauricio said I was going to be a star! Mr. Mauricio can't tell a do from a re. Fine. Let's see what Mr. Mauricio has to say. Lolita, wait... Do you know what Mauricio is going to say? I don't give a damn about what he thinks or says. What a stubborn man! Playing the polonaise again! - Listen, Roberto... - Stop that music from hell! So I can't tell a do from a re? I'm only controlling myself because you must be mentally ill. You're fired! Go play at some madhouse. And take your stupid songs along with you! Wait a moment! You'd better take those words back. Otherwise... Otherwise what? - Because of me you got fired too. - I wasn't fired, I resigned. So I can't tell a do from a re? I thought he'd die of a heart attack. Look, with the bad comes the good. If only he had published your songs. Publish? He kept them inside drawers for a year. He'll regret it. Someday those songs will be famous. You've always lived on dreams. On dreams and reality, my mouth is making water. Look. Let's buy some oysters, a lobster and a bottle of champagne. Are you nuts? We're unemployed and you come up with such a menu? We have to tighten our belts. It's to celebrate our new found freedom. Let's go home, I'll make dinner but cheaper, tastier and faster. Letter from Córdoba, it must be your parents'. My mom. I already know what it probably says. We're here, looking forward to seeing you again. Take care. And if you need a few bucks, you can always ask me. It wouldn't hurt. The house is a mess, everything's dirty, all turned upside down. The janitor didn't come to clean today either. So what does your mother say? The same as usual. "Your father still with lumbago and the usual monomania..." "...regretting you gave up your piano lessons." - Always the same crap. - Get over it. It's hopeless. I'll make dinner. What do you think? To begin with, corned beef, National Industry. Then sardines in oil tomato sauce mussels "au natural". And for dessert... fruit salad. A can opener... and dinner's ready. Oh, we're out of bread. I'll get it. Sorry, sorry. Elisa. Elisa! I'm coming. Elisa... Elisa. Like your Elisa. - Hey! Where's the bread? - Oh! The bread... I'm sorry. I just bumped into an angel. Her name is Elisa, you know. Like Beethoven's. Always daydreaming. It'll be crackers tonight. Come on. Dinner's getting cold. Who is it? It must be the janitor, next door's apartment is empty. Don't pay attention to it. Let me handle it. Yong man, do you think this is a night club? I've just moved in and I have to put up with neighbors like you. Stop banging that piano or I'll call the doorman. Maybe even police! - I'm sorry, Mrs. - Miss! It was or new neighbor. She threatened to call police if you continue playing the piano. She must be a bitter bachelorette. If she is a bachelorette, I'll take her on with romantic music. Music calms the beasts. I guess not this one. Now I am the one protesting! Listen, I... I was playing the piano, I wanted to apologize. Oh, don't worry. The one banging was my aunt. She's a bit of a maniac, you know. - Elisa, whom are you with? - I'm coming, aunt. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What did you say to that witch? Witch? She was an angel. An angel? Are you short-sighted or just out of your mind? Yes, I have to confess she drove me crazy. It's Elisa, Ricardo, Elisa. Elisa, the witch? I definitely don't understand artists. - You're playing the piano again? - I'll play with the damper on. I feel like composing tonight. I'm going to sleep. See you tomorrow. To Elisa... I can give you my best smile To Elisa... I can build a world of tenderness To live this love with Elisa by my side To Elisa... I desire she and the breeze become one To Elisa... God has placed inside this chest a heart It will beat until I die next to my Elisa To Elisa... I give this dream of your story I'll be the owner To Elisa, she's my life To Elisa, I give this love To Elisa, she's my life To Elisa, I give this love To Elisa... I give this dream of your story I'll be the owner To Elisa, she's my life To Elisa, I give this love To Elisa, she's my life To Elisa, I give this love Rose, oh Rose the prettiest rose... Good morning, sleepy head. Did you spend the night on the couch? I composed until late at night. Then I laid down. I don't know if I composed or dreamed up a beautiful song. - The janitor told me everything. - What? About our neighbors. Elisa is the witch's niece. I just saw her. You were right, she is an angel. The janitor also told me she works in a boutique in Duffau Gallery. - It's her, right? - Yes. Elisa... Her partner is a cutie, too. When they get out, we'll pretend we were passing by. You introduce me to Elisa, and she'll introduce me to the cutie. - But they're gonna know. - So what. You leave it in my hands. Look, here they come. Oh! Excuse me. I always end up apologizing to you. What a coincidence, do you work here? Yes. Elisa, this is Ricardo, a friend of mine. - You are the new neighbor, right? - Right. Nice to meet you. Marta, my partner. What a coincidence to run into you like this. Yes, what a coincidence. - Are you going home? - Yes. - Me too, let me go with you. - Ok. - Do you live near Elisa's? - No, I live far from here. - I live in Castelar. - No way, what a coincidence. This must be fate, I'm going to Castelar as well. I'll go with you. I'll address you by your name, it's more casual that way. Shall we? Roberto, I'll go with Marta to Castelar. Bye. - See you tomorrow, Marta. - Bye. Shall we? - Hello, is Elisa here? - No, she just left with Marta. Thanks. Did you see? I stopped playing the piano. Don't pay attention to my aunt. She complains, but she loves it. She even turns the TV off when you sing. Maybe it sounds ridiculous, Ricardo is right. - Do you like my songs? - A lot. Specially when you play classical music. The other day you were playing To Elisa. I was thinking of you. You must have studied a lot to play like that. Yes, but not enough to fulfill my father's dreams. I came to Buenos Aires to study in the conservatory. I studied piano, harmony, composition. And when I was preparing for my first concert, I gave up. What a pity. Why did you quit? I thought I wouldn't make it. To be a soloist, you have to practice 8, 10 hours a day. A whole life, I guess. You must also have talent, and be lucky. But, enough talking about me. What about you? Me? My story is so ordinary. I live with my aunt. She's grumpy but she's really good. I finished high school and I work at a boutique. Just like another million girls. But you're different. - Different? - Yes. You have grace. - No on told you that? - I've been told so many things but I don't believe them. I believe in fate. It was meant for us to meet. Marta are you dumb? You haven't said a word. How do you expect me to speak if you don't shut up. You're a talking machine. Have you always been so trampling? Trampling? I'm a man of my times. We live in the space era, Marta. Everything must be done quickly. Well, then I must be from another age. Before I do something I think it over deeply. It seems a storm is about to break. It started raining. Here, cover up with this. What about you? I love getting wet. A careful man is worth a lot. It's like we are all alone at a hut in the woods. Yes, I know the story I'm Little Red Riding Hood, and you're the ferocious wolf. You're soaked up and it's all my fault. - I bet you'll get a cold. - No, I never get sick. - Come on in, come on in. - Thank you. Come on in Mrs... Ms. How is our dying man doing? You needn't have worried. I have nothing. I asked for your help because... I think he's boiling in fever. So you're the Beethoven who won't let us sleep, right? I don't need a thermometer. He's running with a fever big enough for a horse. Aunt... No need to call the doctor. All he needs is boiling milk, aspirin, cognac and some rest. He'll sweat a few liters and he's done. Done? You mean he... It means he's cured. There's a small problem. I need to go out. I'm presenting The Mice on TV today. - The Mice? - It's a hippie music band. Ok, you go with your mice, and I'll take care of this sick cat. Thank you very much Mrs... Miss. - Goodbye, Roberto. - Goodbye. We'll use this opportunity to tidy up this house from hell. I told you, you would get a cold. I'm glad I did. Thanks to that you're here. Darling, get the vacuum cleaner, twenty pounds of detergent and a dustpan. There's enough dirt here to fill up River Plate's basin. I'm in the wrong apartment. No, Mr. You're not wrong. It's just that everything I clean ends up better than new. I even cleaned Beethoven bust's teeth. - What about your patient? - Come see him. Here's your Federic Chopin, with no more fever. There's no beating homemade medicine. Thank you so much for it all. Roberto, the cleaning... Instead of thanking me, give up the noise at night. Well, it's time for us to go. Darling... Let me walk you to the door Mrs... - I mean, Miss... - Darling... - See you tomorrow. - Goodbye and thank you, Elisa. It was a wonderful cold. I hope to get sick again soon. Elisa... - Bye. - Bye. Darling! Let's go. Goodbye. That cold thing was just an excuse to have Elisa as your nurse? Obviously. I already have a great plan for the four of us to go out. I'm going with Elisa. You can have the aunt, she's single. I'd rather die. I'll go with my Marta. She plays hard to get but I'll tame her down. Give me, from yesterday the crazy desire Give me, the sweet scent from your mouth Give me, the crystal of your smile Give me a little more Give me, your world of illusions Give me, from your nights the passions Give me from your hair all the colors Give me a little more I cannot understand, I need you more than life itself You've managed to take the place of all the old things in me Making me live like this with your madness in a crazy ride That I'm trying to stop but I jjust can't seem to succeed Because all balance is now lost Because I love you so much Give me, the whirlwind of your years Give me, from your love the things I miss Give me, not thinking about tomorrow Give me more from you Damn! I'm in the wrong apartment again. - What is this? - Surprise. Our neighbors are coming for dinner. But Roberto, you're singing at the reception today. Today? I told you a thousand times! Thursday 20. - I forgot. What time? - Eleven, but it's two hours away. There's plenty of time, it's half past seven. - We have dinner and then... - Have you asked them? No, I'll call her now. What if they have an appointment? Come on. They never leave the house. What are you doing? We agreed that when I needed to talk to her I would play To Elisa. Look... it seems your system failed. I'm going to her house. If her aunt gets mad, so be it. - Didn't you hear the piano? - Yes. But I wasn't able to speak. I wanted to invite you two over for dinner. I'm sorry, Roberto. We have an appointment. - Well, it'll be some other day. - Believe me, I'm sorry. It's ok. Don't worry. - Bye. - Bye. - So? - They have an appointment. I saw it coming. I ran into the "appointment" in the elevator. The "appointment"? Yes, some book worm with a bunch of roses. I lost my appetite. I hate eating alone. It's not so bad. Get ready right now and off we are to the ball. Do you know what these receptions are like? Lobster, caviar, French champagne... Just as I told you. Those with money can do whatever they want. You never change, do you? - Ana. - Hi Guillermo. Congratulations. Your country house inauguration will be commented a lot. Yes, the press will say I've gathered the cream of the crop. I'd say the yoghurt of the crop, it's quite a sour cream to me. Guillermo, always so ironic. What about that band? What are they threatening us with? They're here accompanying a singer. I'm assuming he's one of your new discoveries. Don't be so terrible, it's the first time I've seen him. I don't believe you. I am that man, so easy to forget So easy to leave behind lost in the distance I am the one giving up my pain For I know your love, is walking away mercilessly I am not a man of virtue Neither does youth appreciate my existence I understand and justify your behavior Trying to ornament your current adolescence I'm not a prototype lover Neither do I awake any passions in your heart But I die when I see that you... are always trying to walk away But leave, when you want to as soon as possible Don't think that when you go away I'll die I'm dead since that very day When you stopped smiling being by my side I'm dead since that very day When you stopped smiling being by my side But leave, when you want to as soon as possible Don't think that when you go away I'll die I'm dead since that very day When you stopped smiling being by my side I'm dead since that very day When you stopped smiling being by my side Nice song. I liked it. "Easy to forget" I might have written it myself. What do you mean? It seems inspired on me. I'm easy to forget, aren't I? I always remember you. Yes, but not the way I'd like you to. Please Guillermo, we had agreed not to talk about it. You were awesome. I don't know. This is such a cold audience. Do you expect them to cheer you like in a tavern? They are the "elite". That blonde sure is an "elite" one. - He is one of a kind. - Unbelievable. Do you play classical music? Yes. Do you remember Study in Fa Minor by Chopin? I'm sorry but, are you examining me? No, I wouldn't have the authority for it. I would have liked to be a soloist, but I had no talent. That's why I like to help those who do have it. A man who plays Chopin like you do... Why do you lose your time singing insignificant music? It's a long story... I don't want to bore you. Yes... this isn't the right moment. But I want to hear that story. Come to my Buenos Aires house tomorrow at four. What do you think? Should I go? Of course you should. That woman can help you a lot. But what do I say to Elisa? Why should you explain anything to her? Well, because... - You and Elisa, is it serious? - What do you mean? Do you like her? Do you have feelings for her? - Of course. - And what about her? Then clear all doubts. Talk to her tomorrow. - Aren't you mad about last night? - Why? Because we didn't go for dinner. No, you already had an appointment. Elisa, can you come out for a while? I need to talk to you. - Is it very important? - No, but if you can... Ok, wait. Marta. Marta. Hi Roberto. What is it? I'm going out with Roberto. If Teresita comes, tell her I'll be right back. - Don't worry. - Shall we? - Bye. - Bye. Do you like working at the boutique? Yes, it's a great environment. Marta is a great partner. Besides, I always work with enthusiasm, with joy. Yes. That must be very important. I've always been in doubt. - I've never worked with joy. - Perhaps you're too ambitious. I'm happy with little. - I would be happy if... - lf what? No, nothing. Oh, no, don't leave me hanging like that. - What were you going to say? - Nothing, It was silly. It's already half past four. - Were you going anywhere? - Yes, I had an appointment. It's ok. Let's have something to drink at the rooftop. Let's go. - Hello Ana. - It's you Guillermo. - Were you expecting someone else? - No. And this empty cup? There's always an empty cup for potential guests. Since the potential guest didn't show up... I'll use the cup. It must be cold. I like it cold. Ana... there's something great about you you can't lie. Excuse me, Guillermo. I'll lay for a while. I have a terrible headache. If a potential guest arrives, shall I call you? No, I'm not here, if someone asks. Roberto, I have to go back. The boutique is closing. Wait, it's only five minutes. Elisa, I wanted to talk to you about something. You've been trying to tell me that for over an hour. But you don't. Yesterday, when I invited you over for dinner, there was a man. - Yes. - Is he special to you? That man wants to marry me. - What about you? - I told him it's not gonna happen. Why is that? Because I love someone else. - Who is that someone else? - You know it very well. Elisa... Ricardo! She loves me Ricardo! She loves me! She does! She loves me as much as I love her, Ricardo. See? She loves me. What's wrong? - What's that? A telegram? - Yes. Wait, it's about your father, you know. Give it to me! Poor old man of mine... Poor old man of mine... Son... I wanted to be strong, not to cry, but... Cry Mom, cry. Let it all out. Roberto, were did you go? To the river. Where we used to go fishing with Dad. That's the last thing your father composed. "Life goes on". Nice melody. - Aunt, where is Mom? - She is cooking. What day is it? Tuesday 10. You've been here for a week. A week... It must have been eternity, you're so used to the big city. Don't say that. I came to be with her. But I want to go back someday, and I'd like to take her with me. She won't move to Buenos Aires. Her house and memories are here. Everything is so sad in here. Not for her. She wouldn't be able to live without all of this. I'll go set the table. - Is Mrs. Emilia here? - Yes. Do you want me to call her? - I have these flowers for her. - I see. I find your face familiar. Your father sent you a photograph with me sitting by the piano. - So you are Carlitos. - Yes. Everytime I came I used to bring Mrs. Emilia some flowers. Who was that, Roberto? Carlitos, you didn't forget about the flowers. Thank you very much. My father wants me to go to Buenos Aires. To the conservatory. Is that so? Very good. Goodbye Mrs. Emilia. I just came to give you these flowers. Goodbye dear. And thanks for the flowers. I know... he reminds you of me, when I went to Buenos Aires. Yes. Your father loved Carlitos dearly. He said he was talented like you. I hope he won't let his family down, like I did. Don't say that. You're young. You can still do wonderful things. You know how much I appreciate your company. But there's nothing for you in this small town. - We'll discuss that later, Mom. - It's up to you. "I've only been here for a fortnight, Elisa and it feels like years since I last saw you. I wanted to talk my mom into coming with me but it's hopeless. She even advised me to come back. This time I'll do my best so I don't fail. To make my own path in life. Next Thursday I'll be by your side." I think it might be a great opportunity. It's the place to go, and on Mondays they present new artists. If they like you, I'm sure we can get a great deal. - What do you think? - I don't know, Ricardo. I'd like to find something serious, something reliable. But I'm a little confused. You lose nothing by trying. So? Don't you hear me? Ok, I'll go. Out! All sadness out! By the coldness of this table I'll get drunk Out! To the pain inside my soul It makes me lose my temper and it just won't let me think That's why I drink That's why I drink The coldness of august is carved on my face Of never-ending sorrow of the harsh adversity Searching through many glasses that mouth of yours It intoxicated my senses for I know you just won't come Out! To the pain inside my soul It makes me lose my temper and it just won't let me think Out! All sadness out! By the coldness of this table I'll get drunk That's why I drink That's why I drink Everything is over everybody is now gone Friends that I have lost, my life and my love My faith, my youth and my confidence My hope has died everything is dead Out! All sadness out! By the coldness of this table I'll get drunk Out! All of this bad dream out! I'm the owner of my own life, in alcohol I'll make it drown. Out! All of this bad dream out! I'm the owner of my own life, in alcohol I'll make it drown. That young man, isn't he the one who sang at your reception? Yes. What a coincidence to find him here. - Did you know he was performing? - No. - Are you sure? - Why would I lie to you? Then It's fate. - I don't understand. - Maybe you don't want to. Isn't he the potential guest you were waiting for? Guillermo, you used to play Polo. Is spying your new sport? - Please give me a call. - Thank you. Goodnight. What did he say? Well, they're now full. But probably next month. The usual. Next month... Don't be so pessimistic. At least they heard and applauded you. What good is that for me? How can you say that? It's important businessmen hear you. - Hello. Good evening. - Hello. How are you doing? It seems you do remember me after all. Why do you say that? You must have a terrible memory. You were supposed to come to my house but... it seems you forgot. No, I didn't. I just had some problems. Tomorrow, have you got any appointments? - No. - Ok. Come to my house at six. - Don't leave me waiting this time. - I won't madam. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. Professor, please come here. My apologies, Roberto. This is Mr. Milstein, great piano teacher. I wanted to know his opinion, but I thought his presence would limit you. That's why I asked him to hide. Tell us, Professor. Well, there's good raw material and fine skills. Would you teach him? As long as he abides by the rules you already know. I don't want him to waste his time, or mine. Ok Professor. I'll phone you to let you know the decision. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. What is expected from this guinea pig? What rules are those? You are expected to become an excellent pianist. And the rules are to focus exclusively on the piano. Practice, sacrifice... I've already tried it, but it was no good. You'll try again. But I'm going to need money, time, peace. That will be taken care of. Money... I'll get you a grant so you don't feel uncomfortable. Time... you'll have as much as you need. Peace... you will live and study at my country house. And all of that, in exchange for what? Something important, to feel I've contributed to your triumph. And what if I fail? Then it'll have been just a bad investment of time, and hope. But I have faith in you. Ana... Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were alone. Come on in Guillermo. I believe you know each other. Guillermo, Roberto. Pleased to meet you. I'll get going, madam. Just call me Ana. Madam sounds awful. Think it over and let me know. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Well... it seems like he is a rising star. Guillermo, I'm not in the mood for your sarcasm. He's a talented young man and I'm willing to help him. Is there anything wrong? I don't know what to do... Roberto, don't you want to be a pianist? - Yes. - Then why do you hesitate? Because if I take the grant I'll have to abide by a few conditions. And who is preventing you from doing that? I don't know... you, perhaps. - Me? - Yes. I'd have to study far away. Why does it have to be so far? The woman who got the grant for me wants me to be isolated. We'd only see each other from time to time. But you'll have some days off, then you can come see me. Yes, of course. - Lf it's the best for you... - For us. ...then it's worth the effort. Can you imagine? Colon theatre's billboards with your concert? No, no. Roberto! Roberto, what's wrong with you? I'm sorry, I was daydreaming of a concert at the Colon's. You still have a long way to go to get there. Hours, days, months of practice. Faster and deeper. Deeper. More. More. LIFE GOES ON - This day was the longest ever. - Are you going home. Where else do you want me to go? And you? Ricardo is picking me up. - How are things with him? - So-so. Tell me, what do you think of Ricardo? I don't know... he's cheerful. He's funny. - Yes, all players are funny. - There he is. Hi girls. - Any news from Roberto? - Yes, he called me last night. He says he is studying hard and he'll try to come soon I'm going to see him the day after tomorrow. Somebody wants to record his songs. I want to surprise him. Do you miss him? You figure. He's been studying for three months. That was nice, what is it? - Do you like it? - Yes. - Really? - Why are you so surprised? Well... you only care for classical music. I never thought you could be interested in such a simple song. That is unfair. I have a heart besides a brain. Please... I want to hear that song. - Weren't you about to leave? - I have time. Ok. Perhaps, when I open the door, Dead hopes will be reborn in me Perhaps I'll be your owner again Manufacturing dreams, how did I go this far? Perhaps, you'll have changed Perhaps your look will always remain the same Perhaps, with those ways of yours You destroy for once my final dream Perhaps, it'll be a smile Like a gentle breeze, reaching me Perhaps, a surprised look, perhaps puzzled, will appear on your face Perhaps, I'll regret all of this again You will hurt me because of the way you behave Perhaps, it's best for me to leave Before I surrender before you again Perhaps, you'll have changed Perhaps your look will always remain the same Perhaps, with those ways of yours You destroy for once my final dream Perhaps, it'll be a smile Like a gentle breeze, reaching me Perhaps, a surprsed look, perhaps puzzled, will appear on your face Perhaps, I'll regret all of this again You will hurt me because of the way you behave Perhaps, it's best for me to leave Before I surrender before you... before you... again Perhaps, I'll regret all of this again You will hurt me because of the way you behave Perhaps, it's best for me to leave Before I surrender before you... Before you... again It's truly beautiful. What's its name? "Opening the door". It's the story of a man afraid of falling in love again. You must never be afraid of falling in love. To Elisa... do you know its story? They say she was Beethoven's first love. They loved each other. But Beethoven's passion for music made them grow apart. - Hands up! - Ricardo! - How are you doing? - Great. I have excellent news. - Remember Gutiérrez, the editor? - Yes. He liked your songs and he's going to publish them. This is the contract for the first one, "Easy to Forget". Really? That's great. Let's hope the run of good luck will last. - Ricardo, did you see Elisa? - Yes. She's always waiting for your phone calls. Days are really long for her sometimes. Poor Elisa, she is so patient. - What about Marta? - Don't even mention her name. - She rebelled. - What? To the ladies tamer? I became the tamed tamer. I surrendered unconditionally. But, didn't you use to say women are nothing but headaches? Yes, and I still do. I'll just have to buy aspirins. How could they ruin a great movie like that? They're fucking animals and they need to be put to sleep. Sign the injunction with me and they'll know we ain't fucking around. - What do you think, E? - I think we should call Ari. One suit, two suit, three suit, four! Look, Billy, I'm with you, all right? But we have to talk to somebody first before we just sign an injunction. Can't afford to be pissing off another studio right now. - Pussy. - Asshole. All right, guys, chill. Call Ari. So who's picking up the tab on this little chow-down? Relax, Ari, my treat. Greetings, Ari. I always knew that you liked dick, Babs. I just didn't know you were a cocksucker. Please, join us. It's like a meeting of the five families. Maybe I should've had a gun taped up in the bathroom stall. Look, all the majors are here-- CAA, UTA, ICM, Endeavor, William Morris. Who the fuck invited APA? - There it is. - There's no spots. Just pull up in the red, I'll go grab one. All right. Cafe latte, $4.50. Well, actually, I'm on my 10th purchase, paid for the last nine, so you'll be paying for that, bad boy. Actually, I won't, 'cause we don't take those anymore. What do you mean? Too many people were counterfeiting them, so we stopped. Well, unfortunately, the only form of currency I have is that card, so either you accept that card or you're gonna have to eat that drink. I'm not gonna have to eat anything. Anybody ordering a cafe latte? - Right here. - Hey, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. That-- that's my drink. Get me the manager. Yeah, well, you tell Ari when you find him - that he needs to call me back. - I will indeed. - Ari's M.I.A. - What the fuck is he so busy with? Press conference is in three hours. We can't be sitting on our asses doing nothing. Attaboy, Vince. Well, fuck Ari! Fuck this injunction. - Let's handle this ourselves. - What do you have in mind? I got Jamie Burke's number from Lloyd. Don't waste your minutes. I already called. They ain't seeing nobody. Yeah, well, if they ever want to do another movie with Vince, they'll see us. I like your newfound balls, suit. My rapper's signing a big deal this month, but I still have time to handle Vince as well. Aw, shit. Excuse me. Can you leave your number on the windshield? Yeah. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. And I'm afraid I'm going to have to say no, 'cause I ain't going anywhere until I get my free cup of coffee! Jesus Christ, Drama! What the fuck? They discontinued my free coffee card. Listen, pal, I'll buy you the lousy $3 cup of coffee. You really want to get involved in this, dickhead? Drama, Drama, come on, come on! You don't need any more coffee. You're wired up enough as it is. You only got 15 minutes to get to Ed Burns. Fuck it. Fuck all of you! I'm gonna go get me a pilot! But I will be back and you will give me a free cup of coffee. Oh, fuck, the car! Hey! Hey, come back here! Turtle, call a cab! Come on, Ari, you really think we haven't been watching you? I don't know. Have you been watching me? Yes, we have. And we know what you've been up to. - What have I been to? - Why don't you tell us? Why should I tell you if you already know? All right, come on, this is getting us nowhere here. Let me just say this-- I've known you for 20 years. I always knew that you were a smug little rat with grand aspirations. That's why it was such a shock to me to see you sitting in that little boutique agency of yours for the last nine months. But I guess-- I've seen this before-- it's all a ruse in your master plan. Master plan? Look, Ari, simply put, we're here to assure you that the eight of us who represent most of the power in this town are lined up to say that if you go near one of our clients or one of our agents or even one of our highly-prized mailroom boys, we will all come down on you with the wrath of 10,000 suns. You know what's interesting... about that... is that you used the words "Master plan" and "rat" when talking about me, you Hitler-loving, anti-semitic cunt-bag. I can only hope, that 50% of the power at this table is as offended as I am. Ari! Is it true? Come on. Yes or no. Okay, you got me. I'm setting up my own shop. Thank you, thank you. Ari Gold is back and gonna be bigger than ever. But I assure you, and I swear this on my children's names, I have no intention of going after any of your clients or your agents. - Only his. - Really, Ari? Really, Terrance. And with whose money do you plan on funding all this, Ari? Yours, you cockney fuck. You signed the settlement papers, didn't you? Yes. But I didn't sign any checks and I won't. Ari, I'll happily spend $50 million over the next 10 years to make sure that you don't even get a dime today. Call everyone on that list. Emergency Hamlet session, now! Ari, Vince and E called twice. - And they do not seem happy. - I will call them back, Lloyd. Did you not fucking hear me? This is not a drill. This is an emergency! Well, who's going to man the phones? Fuck the phones, Lloyd! Unless Carmen Electra calls for an emergency titty-fuck, don't answer! 82% excellent. That's pretty good. It's more than pretty good. That's "Greek Wedding" good. And what these test scores tell us is that black-and-white is depressing. - People want color. - Why have those eyes - if people can't see 'em, Vince? - They might as well be brown. I didn't make this movie to show off my eye coloring. Vince, you not only look great in the movie, you are... great in the movie. And with this version we will attract a much broader audience. And isn't that what making movies is all about? Well, actually, I mean, it's an art film. The only way you know it's good is if most people hate it. I'm sorry, but we are not in the business of having people hate our movies. Guys, I love your passion, but trust me, there's nothing unartistic about making money. You're driving like a snail. - I could run faster than this. - All right, you know what? We're here. Go get 'em. - I'm 20 minutes late. - So run! All right! Great news. The Gold Standard Agency will be starting its expansion ahead of schedule. Instead of September 1, we are going to be starting today. Yeah! Slight problem, though. None of you will be getting paid for about six months. What? People, come on. The first year at google they paid their staff with paper clips. Now the guy that scrubbed the toilets has got a billion five. Who's with me? Come on, anybody? - I'm with you, Ari. - Like you've got a fucking choice. - Anybody else? Who's with me? - This is bullshit, Ari. - You cannot be serious. - You told us-- We had papers put in front of us today. - Come on, everybody, listen. - I have a choice. A little bit of patience, you guys, please. Come on, you gotta-- Hey, Babs, the traitorous skanks anonymous meeting's next door. Let's talk. I can't believe that you set me up after all I've done for you-- Ari, I needed to see your cards. - You've seen 'em. - How much do you need? - What? - Come on, I want to be partners. - Why? - Because I believe in you. And because I can't work with my ex-husband anymore. No shot, this is my deal. Ari, you have no money and I have too much. - So what do you want? - To fuck. Kidding. I want 60% and my name on top. - I'd rather fuck. - 55. - 45. - 51. 49. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Miller-Gold! Huh? We sound like a fuckin' beer. This was the one, Turtle. I'm officially a loser. I don't know about "officially." What do you want me to say, Drama? You gotta get the temper under control. - Yeah. - You gotta know that. I do, I do. In fact, I was thinking about taking that anger management thing - the judge recommended last year. - You should. - Hello? - Johnny Drama, Eddie Burns. Eddie? - Yeah, hey, look-- - Burns? I've been trying to get your number for over an hour, but nobody's picking up the phone at your agency. Really? Yeah, listen, I'm sorry I had to bail on you today. I got an emergency and I'm off to New York. - So you weren't at your office? - No. Christ, I was standing out there for like an hour. Well, look, I'm-- I'm real sorry, But I want to talk to you about this thing I'm shooting. Hey, look, Eddie, I know I can do this. I know you can do it too, Drama. Truth is, I really just wanted to see you today to make sure you hadn't aged too badly. Aged? Me? Come on! I got carded at Barney's Beanery Thursday night. Okay, okay, Drama. So you'll do this? Are you offering this to me? I don't have to audition or nothing? Drama, you did something for me when you passed on "Brothers McMullen." - I didn't pass. - Drama, come on. You passed to do a little arc on "90210," it's cool. I ended up having to put myself in the movie, changed my whole life. - Awesome. - All right, so I'll see you on set. Okay, thanks. I just got a pilot. Yes! Yeah! Victory! And anger management? Fuck anger management. Well, after seeing a cut of the film, we instantly fell in love with it. From the moment the end credits rolled, it was obvious to me... - Did you get it, Johnny? - Yep. - It's easier than I thought. - Congratulations, Drama. Thanks, bro. - There you are, Vincent. - Jesus, I thought you abandoned me. Never. I came as fast as I could. They're about to introduce you. Right. Look, I love you. Don't worry, I think I got this handled. - You cool with this? - You gotta do what you gotta do. - What's he gotta do? - Yeah, what's he gotta do? - You'll see. - Oh, great. ...a great young talent. Ah, these motherfuckin' pieces of shit. I'm gonna fuckin' hit somebody, there's no fuckin' doubt in my mind. Go lightly, Billy. Life is short. Go fuck your mother, Drama. - Where you been? - What, is there a problem? The house is packed, our boy is looking great. You know Barbara, right? Hey. See all these cameras? Each one represents a million dollars overseas. - Cha-ching. - I don't think so, Ari. Oh yeah? Why not? Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege... What? Speak. ...to introduce to you now the star of "Queens Boulevard," Mr. Vincent Chase. Vinnie! Thank you. "Queens Boulevard" is a masterpiece. And I'm not just saying that because I'm in it or to sell you. I'm saying it because I really truly believe it. Unfortunately, you'll never see the film I'm talking about, because these people up here, these execs, ripped out its soul. Because like all studios in this town they don't give a shit about art. They only care about one thing-- money. Fuck commerce! Any questions? Yes. Great start to the new company, huh? Blue, 18. Set. Hit. Hit. Zach. Zach. Crossbuck 30. Crossbuck 30. Crossbuck 30. Crossbuck 30. - Ready? - Ready. The Eagles will go for it on fourth down with 42 seconds left in the football game and no timeouts. Coach Taylor can get his first winning season for the Shiloh Christian Academy if they can pull this play off. Blue, 18. Set, hit. Avery will take the snap. He pitches back to Jacob Hall. Jacob's gonna try to pass it. He's got Jeremy Johnson going down the field. - Here come the Tigers. - Throw it, Jacob. Jacob's gonna try to tuck and run. And he's taken down at the 40-yard line and stopped there by Lewis Slaughter. Jeremy Johnson was wide open down the field. If he'd only had a few seconds more to throw this game might have had a different outcome. As it is, the Tigers will take over now, and will no doubt run out the clock ending Coach Grant Taylor's bid for his first winning season in six years. Now he'll have to wait until next season for that all-elusive winning record. That's if they let him come back next year. - Hi. - Get them, Claire. Hey, Grant. Come on, you all. Quit talking. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Hurry. What? You gotta be kidding me. - This had better be a joke. - No. Mandy said he came in this morning, got his papers. A player can't just transfer to another school. - He's gotta make a change of address. - He did. He's moving in with his dad. I can't believe that. This is the third time this has happened. Spend three years pouring into them, they get to their senior year they transfer to a rival school. Why? Well, because at the end of the season nobody wants to be on TV going, "We're number six, baby. We're number six. " Well, you asked. Just had to go there, didn't you? - Is it true Darren switched to Tucker? - We'll talk about it in a minute. - So it's true? - We'll talk about it in a minute. Huddle up. Coach, is it true that Darren transferred to Tucker? I got word that Darren did transfer to Tucker. - God. - Oh, my God. There goes the season. The season will be whatever we make it. Who's gonna take his place? He scored a third of our points. You let me worry about that. We're not starting as if it's doomsday. - Nobody's irreplaceable. - Darren is. Darren is not. There's more to a good football team than a running back. This ought to push you to take up the slack. Stop worrying about Darren. Start your drills. We got a game to play this Friday night. Let's go, Shiloh. Come on. Let's go. All right, guys. Why'd you park all the way out there? Had to. It died again. Why don't we get a new battery? I'll get Brady to help me tomorrow. I don't wanna think about it now. - Do you want me to take a look at it? - Stop it. Oh, sweetheart-- Grant, I don't know what that smell is. I've scrubbed everything I can. - It's terrible. - I know it is, but what else can I do? I don't even know where it's coming from. Well, this day stunk. Why shouldn't my house? - What do you mean? - Darren transferred to Tucker. What? He did not. Yep. Came by and got his papers, didn't even say goodbye. - Why? - Why do you think? Didn't see a chance of winning at Shiloh. But it ain't like Tucker's gonna guarantee him a scholarship. - Oh, I bet the boys are frustrated. - More than you know. I meant to throw that away. Did you think you were pregnant? I don't know. I just wanna be pregnant so bad that my mind plays tricks on me. You know, it's been four years since we started trying. Would you be opposed to me going to see a specialist? No. I'd just like to know what she says. Okay. I thought we were having spaghetti tonight. Stove's not working. You are kidding me. So we got a leak in the back room, the dryer only works half the time the car's dying on us and now the stove's broken. That's about right. No wonder I'm losing my hair. I love you. And now your Georgia Sports Break with Alicia Houston. The Richland Giants started practice as the school year gets under way. The team will be defending a three-year state championship run. Now they prepare to fight for a fourth. I'm here with head coach Bobby Lee Duke of the Giants. Coach Duke, how does this year look for the team? Alice, we've grown real fond of the state title. And we don't see any reason to give it up this year. I've got most of my starters coming back and I've got a strong bench. So I've only got one thing to say: Get off the tracks, because the freight train's coming. Move, move. I hope that's not a sign of the way the rest of the season's gonna go, coach. - Now, why did he have to say that? - Just let it go. I hate this car. Let's find somebody with jumper cables and let's go home. It's bad enough you lose your first game. Now I can't start my own car. This happens to everybody. Don't be embarrassed about it. - Do you have jumper cables? - Oh, sure. - Grant, I wasn't that embarrassed. - Then why did you hide? Why does this house have to stink so bad? You'll get used to it after a couple of hours. Honey, we gotta do something about the car. Because the only thing it does faithfully for us is break down. That's about right. Would it not be better just to get a small new car? - You know we can't afford that. - How do other people do it? Other people make more than 24,000 a year. You make 0000. That takes us to 30. Which is enough to help us with repairs occasionally not with a new car payment. Besides, there's other bills we don't normally have to pay. Like what? Like my doctor bill. You saw her today? - What did she say? - She said that I'm fine. My numbers are normal and she saw nothing that gave her concern. That's good. It doesn't mean the problem is with you. What else could it mean? We just may not have given it enough time. Four years? Are you still hoping we'll have a baby? You know I am. Me too. I catch myself thinking about it more and more. Don't you wanna know if something's preventing it? Are you afraid of getting checked out? Yes. Grant I'm still clinging to a hope that one day we'll have children. I imagine them running in this house. I hear them playing in the backyard or running to our bed in a thunderstorm. And I think about reading them stories and teaching them songs. And I just keep thinking how can I miss someone so much that I have never met? I'll go. Stanley. Stanley, do you wanna tell me what you're doing on the top of my desk? No. Do you have any idea how you got on top of my desk? No. I suggest you get down immediately. You two can tell Coach Taylor the reason you're late for practice today is because you've been sitting in detention. Come on. That was some serious humor. I'll get serious about your humor when you get serious about your studies. Fifty-five? Well, if you wanna announce your grade to the entire class you go right ahead. Fifty-seven. So basically we got the toughest schedule we ever had and less talent than we ever had. At least we got Dewey County on Friday night. That'll be a pretty easy win. I'm concerned it might be our only win. No, we'll pull three or four out. That'll give us another average season. I'm so sick of average seasons. - I gotta go. - Where are you going? - Got a doctor's appointment. - For what? - I have a doctor's appointment. - For what? Leave the man alone. He don't have to tell you. So, what's wrong with you, man? I'll be back in a couple hours. Now look what you did. You done made him mad. Me? You're the one that made him mad. No, not me. Besides, I know where he's going. Where? He's going to the hair doctor. The man is going bald. You hadn't noticed that whole underdeveloped region? Oh, you're one to talk, Slick. No, see, when a black man goes bald, he still looks good. Look at Michael Jordan, George Foreman, Samuel L. Jackson. Classy-looking brothers. Who you got? Kojak? Yeah, coach gonna get him some plugs. - Grant would not get plugs. - Don't laugh. You next. Your soccer skills get better every year, son. It doesn't matter. Shiloh doesn't have a soccer team. They play football. So? Why not kick for the football team? They've already got a good kicker. I'm sure they wouldn't mind having two good kickers. Dad, I'm too small. I really just don't feel like getting killed. Are you saying you're not interested or you'd like to try out but you're afraid? What if I don't even make the team? Well, you're already not on the team. I mean, you can't get any more not on the team than you are right now. - Okay, Dad. - David, you can't be afraid of failure. Everyone fails at some point. So you think I should try out for the football team? Well, if you're waiting around for soccer, it ain't gonna happen. Hike. - Yeah, Sam. - Yeah, baby. Coach Owens, have you got a minute? Yeah. Look, some of the men have been talking. We really wanna see this school succeed with our football program. And I know you feel the same way too. But, frankly, we don't ever see that happening while Coach Taylor is here. Well, you know we're in a rebuilding season. Look, I know he's a fine man and all, but he's had six years here and nothing significant to even show for it. You know, I honestly believe you would make a better head coach. Ready to go. Some of us have requested a meeting with Mr. Ryker. If you would just support us, I really believe this could go a lot easier. Mr. Pervis, I don't know. Look, it's not like we're trying to hurt the guy. What we're doing is for the benefit of the school. You just think about it. Good hustle, Casey. What was that about? What? Alvin Pervis. Oh, we were just talking. Everything all right? - Yeah. - Mr. Taylor. That was great, man. Good job. Yes. I'm Larry Childers. This is my son, David. He's a junior. - We're new to the school. - Good to meet you. - What can I do for you? - I just wanted to introduce myself. David wanted to know if it was too late to try out. - You a football player? - I've always played soccer. - I figured I could try out as a kicker. - Okay. I got a pretty good kicker but I don't mind letting you try out. Jonathan, come here. This is Jonathan. He holds for our main kicker, Joshua Webster. Jonathan, this is David Childers. He wants to try out as a kicker. Why don't you go try a few kicks to get your feet wet? All right, sure. Thank you, sir. If you don't mind, I'll just hang around till practice is over. No problem. Good to meet you. You all just move here? Yeah, from Athens. My dad got a job teaching at the college. That's cool. I'm used to kicking soccer balls, but I thought I could at least try out. Well, Josh is a pretty good kicker, but he's also a receiver. I think he likes that better than kicking. Here you go. I'm sorry. Man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Sorry about that. - It's all right. - Hey, watch it. - Sorry. Matt. - Let's go. - I'm going with Brock for a little while. - Not tonight. You're coming home. - Why? - Don't argue with me. Let's go. - No, Dad. I'll be home later. Matt. That old man still come every week to pray in the hallway? Mr. Bridges. Prays for the students as he passes their locker. How long has he been doing that? He's been praying for revival since before I got here. Lord knows we need it. Apathy in the school's about as bad as our football record. That reminds me. I think you should go ahead and let David Childers on the team. - You see something there? - Well, he's just used to playing soccer. He ain't that strong, but he shows promise. All right. I'll give him a shot. One, two, hit. What are you doing? Go. Let's stay in the game. No. No. Will someone tell me how we lost to Dewey County 21 to 7? Twenty-one to seven. Dewey County hasn't beaten Shiloh since you were in kindergarten. I don't know what you call that junk out there, but it sure wasn't football. Nine dropped passes, four fumbles, three interceptions. Their defense scored most of their points. You gave the game away. You can't win football games cam for. Here's a clue: He lives in this apartment. It's my baby brother Wade. You live together? Well, I'm actually... He has trouble holding down a job and he asked if he could spend a few weeks on my couch and it turned into three years. Now that's sisterly love: Free room, and board, and surveillance equipment. Look, you guys, this is my fault, you know. I should have never made it for him. You knew that he was a pervert. He's not. He... he's just troubled. I've always had to look out for him. We didn't have a pleasant childhood, right? You seem to be high functioning. Wade took the brunt of the abuse. He's a very sensitive boy. I think the people he caught with their pants down might disagree. Is this where the little peeper keeps his stuff? Please don't, Wade doesn't want anyone touching' his things. Just a peek. No. Charlie. Your brother is sick, okay? You're not doing him any favors. Help us stop him so we can get him the counseling he needs. (Benson) "Urine Luck"? (Munch) It must be good. They're sequels. What are you doing? Admiring your video collection. Wade, these are detectives. They know. I didn't break any laws. You did if you took any of these without the subject's consent. Now, uh, these look homemade, Wade. I can explain. Let's go back to our place. You'll love our facilities. Seriously, Wade, just tell me. What do you get out of it? I really don't feel like discussing it. Wade, I've got to commend you on your fine penmanship. Our friend here has been keeping a journal, detailing his toilet tour of Manhattan. You had no right to read that. You had no right to shoot the crap. The witness you ran over fleeing from the scene of the crime positively ID'ed you. That's how we got our search warrant. I can't stand people touching my things. Did you get anything off his computer? Footage from the cafe, yeah. Oh, did he write about it in his journal? Try May 2, 8:05 a.m. Please don't do this. "Female subject, fat butt. Urination, 33-second duration, marigold yellow." I wasn't hurting anyone. No, you violated hundreds of people. The videos were for my own private use. No one else was ever gonna see them. Just let me pay the fine so I can go. It doesn't work that way anymore. They passed Stephanie's Law in August. (Benson) Video voyeurism is now an E-felony. One to four years. Per count. No way. You serve those consecutively, you're lookin' at a life sentence. I wanna make a deal. (Stabler) Well, unfortunately, you don't have anything we want. No, I do. A real crime. Yeah, what is it? If you catch the guy, will you reduce my sentence? Depends. What have you got? Check out DVD 62 about an hour in. (Munch) This is from two weeks ago. (Stabler) "Saturday, 1:00 p.m." I'll spare you the details. The next one's three minutes after this. It's marked "NS." What's "NS"? "No Specimen." Here we go. (Fin) Oh, no. Not a kid. (Benson) Check out his right eye. It looks like he's been attacked. (Cragen) Recently. Maybe he ran in there to hide? Look, the door's shaking. (Stabler) Someone must have followed him in. (Fin) Don't open the door. The camera's going out. The toilet perv caught a sexual assault. And didn't do a thing to stop it. You watched that boy being molested? What are you doing? Look. Oh! Where were you? Where were you? I don't know what you're talking about. You were standing right outside. No. Watching. No, no. I saw it later. Wade, don't lie to me. That's not your MO. You like a live show. You saw that whole thing go down, you didn't even help? What was I supposed to do? Help him! Yeah, I told the cops that I caught the whole thing on my toilet cam. Where did it happen? Central Park. The camera didn't catch the guy's face. Describe him. I was on a bench 50 yards away. I never saw him. (Morales) Can't get what's not there. All we have is the perp's blue sweatshirt and jeans. (Fin) What about the boy? We'll never get an ID. It's too grainy. We have some new technology on loan from NASA. Let's see what it can do. The software is a video image stabilization system called VISAR. (Munch) That's what they used to solve that car wash abduction down in Florida. That's amazing. You could see just how fresh the cut over his eye is. Not to mention eye color: Blue. (Morales) I'll print it out for you. No, hold on, hold on. Go back out. There's a section that we kept replaying. We couldn't quite make it out. Right there. Go back a few frames. [Keyboard clicking] Zoom in. Something in the perp's hand. Can you enhance it? [Computer beeps] That's an athletic cup. He must have been playing some kind of sport in the park. He's wearing a soccer jersey. Well, that explains the cut over his eye. Probably got injured during the game. Yeah, which the pedophile may have been watching. (Morales) Guys, we've got something else. (Munch) What? The nails are manicured. The tips are white. Our molester is a woman. [Sighing] Well, that certainly narrows the suspect pool. Only 10 percent of all pedophiles are female. That we know of. It's definitely understudied and probably underreported. Patrol had a walk in the park that day. No one reported so much as a mugging. Which bathroom are we talking about? Wade says that it was close to the Boathouse Cafe. The nearest facility is Midtown here. There're a lot of practice fields in that area. The journal said the attack occurred around 1:03 p.m. I checked the team schedules. The closest field reserved for soccer was Vipers vs. Bulldogs. The boy's jersey was red and black. That's the Bulldogs. (Cragen) Talk to their coach. (Phil) That's Shane Madden, our star forward. Anything unusual happen at that game? Yeah, we were actually winning for once until Shane got thrown out. For what? Fighting with the other team's sweeper. Any adults get involved? Shane's mom ran onto the field: A real piece of work. How so? She's got a little too much team spirit in the liquid form. So she was drunk. Sure wasn't feeling any pain, not even when she fell on her ass. Trying to break up a fight? No. Joining in. She assaulted a kid? Verbally. She slipped in the mud before she could reach him and then she teetered off to clean herself up. I assume to the nearest restroom. How long after all that did Shane leave? Right away. He never came back. Any other women leave the game around that time? Not that I noticed. What school does Shane go to? Trumpet section, last chair on the right. You noticed any behavioral changes in the last two weeks? I don't have much interaction with him. Shane's a good student. Only problem cases get sent to the principal's office. We're gonna need to speak to his homeroom teacher. Uh, Fred Moynihan, Room 109. Do you have a place where we can speak to Shane privately? You're welcome to use my office. Go ahead and pull him out, please. I don't know what you're talking about. Shane. It was caught on tape. There was a hidden camera in the bathroom. It wasn't me. (Stabler) Well, it looks just like you. Even wearing your jersey. Who was it? Is it a stranger or someone you know? A stranger. (Benson) Can you describe her? Why? I thought you had her picture. We do. We just need you to tell us anything you can remember about her. You know what, I... I really don't want to do this. Shane, you have nothing to be ashamed of. You didn't do anything wrong. You guys suck. What happened? We're gonna need to talk to his parents. I don't know. There's just a mother and I use the term loosely. So you know about her problem? She came to speak to the kids on Career Day. It was horrible. Great lesson on the perils of drinking, though. What exactly is Mrs. Madden's career? A beautician. She works at a place called Creme de la Crop. The little girls just love him. They call him all the time. Ma'am, do you understand what happened to your son? He's a gorgeous kid, just like his father. Girls couldn't keep their hands off him either. Well, we're talking about an adult. Who would do something like that? (Benson) We understand that you had a little mishap at the game. Some idiot knocked me in a mud puddle. Where'd you go to clean yourself up? Bathroom. Happen to run into your son there? No. Would you mind if we took a look at your nails? Why? What the hell are you implying? Just that you both were in the restroom at the same time. I used the one at the Boathouse Cafe and then stayed for a drink. All right, how long were you there for? Oh, let's see. I was finishing my second beverage when Shane came and pulled me out. Did he say anything about what had happened? No, but who talks about sex with their mother? Did you notice any female spectators who didn't have a son there? Cindy Bellamy. (Benson) And who's that? Shane's babysitter until about a month ago. Used to love her, but one day ups and throws a fit. Says he doesn't need her anymore. What was she doin' there? I have no idea. [People chattering] I went to more of Shane's games than his own mom. Uh, while I was there, I networked a little, picked up three other gigs. So you were babysittin' another kid that day? Yeah, Davey Auerbach. (Cindy) Come on, Alex, Dylan? Five minute time-out. Separate rooms, come on. Told you. (Munch) You've got quite a way with the boys there. Yeah, I'm strict, but I always make sure they have fun. And 12 to 15 hours is nothing to sneeze at. Shame you were fired from the Madden gig. Shane said he was too old for a babysitter. (Fin) But too young for a girlfriend. [Birds chirping] I'd never do that to a kid. I'm dating one of my professors. I like them older. Now if you'll excuse me. Did you talk to Shane at that game? Yeah. I asked if things had gotten any better with his mom. (Munch) There was a problem? She's a total alky. I heard she was really knocking' them back at that game. I can't tell you how many times I was babysitting, she showed up hours late, blotto. A lot of times with a younger guy than who she left with. Must be rough on Shane. God knows what he's seen. When she's drunk, Mrs. Madden has no idea what she's doing. We're seriously looking at the mother? She was in the vicinity at the time of the attack. Witnesses say she was drunk. And when she drinks, she gets horny for younger guys. When I was on the bottle, I woke up with my share of regrettable bedmates. But her own son? (Fin) The more you drink, the blinder you get. And her alcoholic blackouts are legend. We canvassed the building. Everyone had a horror story. Like the time she woke up so drunk she couldn't find her own bathroom. Ended up pounding on a neighbor's door at 3:00 a.m., asking to use his. Naked. So at the very least, we're looking at an unfit mother. Where's the father? Babysitter said he split years ago. Apparently Shane took over some of his duties. Okay, but in the bedroom? You know how big a role alcohol plays in sexual assault. Before we stagger down this road, let's not rule out other possibilities. Shane's team has a game tomorrow. It should be the same crowd. Chat up the cheering sections, see if anybody saw anything. [Children chattering] Check out the redhead. Blue sweatshirt and jeans. Just like the perp in the video. Ma'am? Yes? "Soccer Mom." That's what it says. You got a boy on the team? Do you? No, but we'd like to talk to you about your outfit. What about it? Did you wear it to the game two weeks ago? I wear it to all the games. The Booster Club pushes them to pay for the pizza parties. Every mom in the league's got one. Of course I bought a shirt. Got to support my little man! [Cheering] Probably appreciate it a lot more if you were sober. Screw you. Ma'am, have you been drinking? No. No? Mind if I examine your travel cup? Oops. Okay, Mrs. Madden, you're in violation of Code 10-125 and we could arrest you right now. What do you want from me? Is this a school team? No, it's sponsored through the city. Shane's principal, Mrs. Rice, does she have a son on the team? (Jackie) No. [Children shouting] What's she doing here? Awfully close to the student body. She's awful popular around here. Looks like she has a thing for young boys in uniform. Principal Rice? Hey, good to see you again. Detectives. (Stabler) Who's this young man? Jason. My son. Really? You look way too young to have a son this age. Stepson. (Benson) Oh. His team just won. Congratulations. Do you play in the same league as Shane? Jason's 14. He's in an older division. But it's the same league. (Stabler) Where's your "Soccer Mom" shirt? I'm not big on sweatshirts. What are you talkin' about? You wear that stupid thing all the time. Yeah? Does your mom come to all your games? Oh, yeah. She's a diehard soccer fan. Must be. We saw you hanging out at the Pee-Wee League. I ran into a student. (Benson) Shane Madden. Did you run into him two weeks ago? No. I'm sorry. We're late for a pizza party. [People chattering] What do we know about the principal? No criminal records. Just a lifetime of good deeds. A stint in the Peace Corps, volunteer work, set up an adult literacy program. She was IS-41's Teacher of the Year in '96 and '98, promoted to principal three years ago. Nice gig for a pedophile. Absolute power over all those kids. It's just odd that there's never been so much as an allegation. What about her personal life? Married seven years to an architect, one stepson. Who happens to be two years older than the victim. Well, most pedophiles don't get caught with their first victim. Maybe she was fooling around with the stepson. Easy access. That's assuming that she's our perp. Can we place her at the game in question? We just sat through two riveting hours of a soccer video that I wrangled from some dad. No signs of the principal, but he did catch Shane's mom falling' on her ass. Well, the outfit's a crime, but it's not a match. Rules her out. Principal Rice had to have been there. Her kid said she goes to all of his games. We checked out where her stepson plays. The restroom is between the two fields. Come on, that's circumstantial, at best. Captain, you weren't there today. She couldn't get away from us fast enough. She never gave us a chance to find out what she and Shane were talking about. Ask him. Check out the stepson. (Fin) How do you get along with Meredith? Great. For a stepmom. Well, for any mom. I really got lucky with her. It sounds like you two are pretty tight. Well, I was a brat when she first moved in, but she's totally cool now. How so? Well, she helps with homework, comes to all my games, boring school plays, exciting stuff like that. Sounds good. No, it doesn't. What are you doin' here? Just checkin' in. You always come to school early to practice? Well, the noise, it, uh, gives my mom headaches. Well, I don't think it's your playing that gives her a headache. You know, Shane, I know you've got a tough situation at home. My mom, she, uh, she just needs extra help, you know? She gets sick a lot. Yeah. When you feel like talking to someone, that's my business card and you can give these people a call. Alateen? What's that? It's a support group for children of alcoholics. Thanks. [Sighing] Let's talk about your situation here at school. There's no situation. With Principal Rice. What about her? [Bell ringing] I have to get to class. We have her on tape. No, you don't. In that restroom. Yeah, we do. We talked to her. She won't say anything to you. Well, she has been getting a little weird lately. How so? She and my dad have been fighting. That's what married folks do. Yeah, but not them. They never fought before. [Children chattering] It's getting really bad, too. She even yelled at me. What did you get from the stepson? Nothing to indicate he'd been molested. What about Shane? He give her up? As good as. I just couldn't get him to say it. Not enough to remove a principal from school. Which way is the teacher's lounge? Meredith Rice. She's as straight-laced as they come, but the kids still love her. Did you ever see her interact with Shane Madden? Actually, she's pulled him from my class a couple of times recently. For what? I don't know. Shane handed me a note excusing him from gym class. Tell you the truth, I thought it was fake. Why is that? Looked like a kid wrote it. But I double-checked. Mrs. Rice confirmed it was her handwriting. Hey, hey, hey, hey. If Shane Madden passed through here, odds are he was written up. Should be here in the Disciplinary Action File. [Children chattering] (Benson) Principal Rice didn't write all these, did she? (Williams) In a public school, a lot of at-risk kids. I mean the handwriting. It looks like different people wrote these. No. Meredith meets with each one of them. [Children chattering] You're right, she is getting a little sloppy. Something weighing on her mind? She has been distracted lately, but aren't we all? So close to summer break. Hmm, nothing on Shane. Is Principal Rice available? Oh, I'm sorry. She's not back yet. Where is she? Home. Family emergency. (Stabler) Mr. Rice, have you had any contact with your wife? No, just tell me. Is she in some kind of danger, one of her problem students? Mr. Rice, how's your marriage? W-What? What are you talking about? We heard you were fighting. That's none of your business. Well, actually, it might be. At the time that your wife left school, a young man, a student, also went missing. So what, you think he kidnapped her? We think she kidnapped him. What are you talking about? Your wife's been molesting that boy. That's a lie. We have it on tape. I'm sorry. Have you noticed any inappropriate behavior between Meredith and your son? [Grunting] Now, I've got a 12-year-old boy who's in danger out there, and I need you to tell me what is going on with your wife! What is going on with her? I don't know. She's changed. No. She's changed, hasn't she? Yes. Yes. Please let me go. Relax. [Panting] She's changed. She hasn't been herself lately. She... She's preoccupied. She snaps at any little thing. She's... And in the bedroom she's insatiable. Are you telling me that she's screwed... She's not getting enough so she's screwing a little boy on the side? We just need to find her. Now do you have any idea where she might go? No. Does she have access to a car? We have a car, but we don't use it very often. Could you check with the garage? I got 911'ed out of my VICAP meeting. We got a cluster? Shane Madden went missing'. As did Principal Rice. We're thinking they're together? Yeah, and getting out of Dodge. Husband hasn't heard from her and she took his car. Long gone by now. We get out an APB? And an Amber alert. And unfortunately, the blue Ford Taurus is a very popular make and model. We're getting possible sightings from highways in the Tri-State area. She's gotta stop for food or gas at some point. We're tracking her ATM and credit cards? So far, no pops. She's either using cash or Shane's piggy-bank. Husband said the tank was near-empty. We've got a sighting. Where? Edgewater, New Jersey. Trucker's right behind them on the exit. Well, that's just outside the city. How sure is he it's them? He gave me the full plate number. Get movin'. [Police siren wailing] (policeman) Get out of the vehicle! Move in! (Stabler) Shane? (Benson) Back seat! (Stabler) Shane! (Shane) Help! (Benson) Exit the vehicle! Hands where we can see 'em! Go away! (Benson) Comply, now. Buddy, are you okay? I'm fine, but she's not. She... she's been throwing up. Please don't let them hurt her. Let's go. She's sick. All right. She's sick. You're under arrest for sexual assault and kidnapping of a minor. You have the right to remain silent. You give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. My head is splitting. I think I need a doctor. (Stabler) We've got a great company shrink you can see. You've got to be out of your mind to be running off with a sixth grader. I am not crazy. I know it's wrong. Good. Taking responsibility. That's the first step to setting it right. Look, you don't understand. That day at the soccer field was the first time. So help me understand what happened. He was crying. I followed him in there to make sure he was okay. The next thing I know, we're having sex. And that seems like a perfectly natural segue to you? Yes. You didn't notice that Shane was trying to get away from you? The first time. But after that, he couldn't get enough. It was his idea to run. You always take orders from sixth graders? My life is fallin' apart and I don't know why. Now look, what are you gonna do? You're obviously attracted to young boys. This is a nightmare. I swear I have never done anything like this before. What, being caught? You have. On tape. Now you've to deal with it. I am not a pedophile. I love my husband. I love my job. I'll bet you do. A lot of young boys to choose from. Stop it. Tell me what you did to the child. That's a bad idea. Come on, let's get it on. Are you crazy? You're out of your mind! [Groaning] Is there a problem here? No problem. I think she's going for an insanity defense. [Grunting] She's having a seizure. Call an ambulance. (Benson) The tox screen is clean. We're still waiting for the head CT. Oh, yeah. I don't know what the hell happened in there. It was an accident. She assaulted you and you have witnesses, Elliot. Rat Squad IAB at 2:00. Sgt. Tucker. Det. Stabler. Sorry to interrupt your beauty sleep, but I'll be waiting for my union rep. Smart move if you got something to hide. He was sexually assaulted. Oh, what a surprise. The partner's gonna back him up. Yeah, how would you feel if a perp had your boys in a vise grip? Cuff her, not bash her brains in. I thought I used appropriate force. I was just reading up about your thoughts. Suspended four years ago for tellin' the company shrink you, uh, dreamed about killin' pedophiles. Thought about it, never did it. You're gettin' closer and closer. (Beresford) Detectives? How is she? Not good. We found something in her CT. We're rushing her into surgery right now. From a blow to the head? No. This was a pre-existing condition. Brain tumor, the size of a baseball. [Woman chattering on PA system] We were in there eight hours. It looks like we got it all. Great. Now here's my problem. The law says she needs to be arraigned within 24 hours of her arrest. Uh, I just opened up this woman's skull, and excised a malignant lesion 9 centimeters long. I'm afraid you're gonna miss that deadline. Well, I've gotten an abeyance, but I still need to proceed in a timely manner. She'll be in the hospital for five, six days. All right, that's fine. I can get a judge and a clerk down here for a bedside arraignment. I wasn't aware that judges made house calls. Just tell me when she'll be lucid enough to be swearable. May I ask what exactly is she charged with? She molested a 12-year-old whom she subsequently kidnapped. [Sighing] You do know that frontal lobe damage can diminish impulse control. This woman knew what she was doing was wrong. You know, that's right. The area of the brain that stores moral knowledge is not affected, but look at this. This is Meredith's head CT. The tumor is here. In the right orbitofrontal cortex which controls behavior. That's fascinating, but I'm not performing brain surgery here. I'm just trying to get a pedophile off the street. Without the tumor, she might not be one anymore. So what? Give her a doctor's note? "Please excuse Meredith for molesting boys. She had a bad tumor." To tell you the truth, this looks like a textbook case of acquired sociopathy. Well, how do I know the tumor caused it? Maybe she'd been a predator all along, and the tumor just made her sloppy? I doubt it. Shane is our only known victim. Not as of this morning. Three additional boys have come forward. Raped? No, one sent to her office was hugged and kissed. The other two were fondled. When? All in the last month. She's committed multiple felonies. She has to pay for them. Not if she lacked the mens rea. It's obvious that the lesion disinhibited her. The question you have to answer is: Did she act on these pedophilic tendencies before the tumor? And are those tendencies still there? Understand, this test is still in the experimental stages. So we'll be viewing her PET scan in here while she's watching the erotic videos on those goggles. Yeah, brain-mapping is not an exact science yet. But we do know the areas of the brain that respond to arousal and pleasure. And we'll be able to view activity on the anterior singulate? Trust me, you won't. I no longer have those feelings. What is that exactly? It's a very tiny amount of radiation. The same exposure you'd get flying across the country five times. We're good to go. How're you feeling? Like my old self again. Well, we really appreciate your cooperation. I want to do this. Hopefully, this test will give us some answers. Please believe me. I tried to stop. Did you? I knew it was wrong. But the urges were so strong that they just took over my mind, my body. L... I couldn't control myself. Every day it got worse. I am the last person who would ever do anything like this. Why? I know the damage it can cause. When did it happen to you? It started when I was eight. It lasted four years. Was it someone that you knew? Someone I loved. My grandfather. (Dr. Morella) Ready? (Stabler) So that's a pedophile's brain, huh? No, this is. One who's currently incarcerated. According to Meredith Rice's PET scan, she's no longer a threat to society. She showed no reaction to the pedophilic stimuli. If she had, the area right in here would be red. Unless it meets the Daubert test for scientific reliability, it's not admissible in court. Well, look at the handwriting. I mean, it went back to normal as soon as the tumor was removed. So what do we do, we let her go? Oh, if we let her off, it opens the door for every rapist and violent criminal who wants to find a medical excuse. Yeah, and tomorrow there'll be a run on the PET scan lab. Wouldn't it be great if that was true, if we could actually isolate the part of the brain that makes somebody a pedophile? And they could be fixed. How? Mandatory screenings at birth to zap some part of the brain we don't even know exists? The tumor changed her behavior, but that alone didn't make her a pedophile. She had a lower set point to begin with. (Benson) What the hell is that supposed to mean? She was molested as a child, and like having any predisposition to high blood pressure or cholesterol, she had a higher risk of becoming an offender. But she never acted on it until the tumor wiped out her impulse control. I found a similar case in Virginia. Upstanding citizen, loving husband and father, became a pedophile out of the blue. Let me guess. Same brain tumor. It was discovered in jail. It was removed and he was considered cured. (Benson) Did they release him? Yeah. A year later, he molested again. So it wasn't the tumor at all? No, it was the tumor. It had just grown back. So it's not her fault and she's perfectly cured, but if the lesion recurs, she'll do it again. What are you gonna do, Counselor? She pleads to Rape Three, five years probation and periodic psychiatric and medical evaluations. We might be amenable to that. I'm not done yet. She's also not to have any future contact with any of her victims. Of course not. There are already restraining orders in place. We're not contesting them. And she registers as a sex offender. What? Come on, Casey. Is that really necessary? (Novak) Yes. The registry was set up to protect the public from sexual predators at risk of offending again. But that's not me. This only happened because of the tumor. What are you going to do if it grows back? She gets branded a sex offender, she can never work in the school system again. She can never work with kids. Better safe than sorry. Then I think we'll take our chances at trial. This is a noble woman who suffered a freak brain tumor. Everyone fears the Big C. Once I remind the jurors it could happen to any one of them, they'll acquit. (Rice) No. I'll take the plea. Meredith, you don't need to do that. Yes, I do. She's right. The children have to be protected. It's a responsibility I need to take. You're getting pretty good. It doesn't matter. I dropped out of band... and soccer. [Siren wailing] If I could, I'd drop out of school. Kids giving you a hard time? Jason Rice slugged me in the cafeteria. He said he'd kick my ass for busting up his family. He said he'd kill me. I'll talk to him, okay? Why won't she talk to me? I must have called her a 100 times and she never picked up. Shane, she can't. She goes to jail if she does. She talked to me. She cared about me. I thought she loved me. Shane, she was very sick. And what she did, it's... it's not your fault. And she's better now, but I gotta tell you, I'm more concerned about you. [Sobs] I just wanna die. Then we're going to get you some help. Trust me, you're gonna get over this. The real damage hasn't even begun to set in for Shane. This kid's gonna need extensive therapy. And a strong support system. He's not gonna get that at home. Not with his mother. I think she's the reason why Shane was susceptible to a mother figure in the first place. The kid's so screwed up, he doesn't even know he's a victim. He still thinks he's in love with Meredith. It's unfortunate that his first sexual experience was non-consensual. But it's even worse that he developed feelings for his abuser. (Benson) What are the odds that he's going to have a healthy sex life? Not good. But they're ideal that he'll become an offender himself. The cycle of abuse just keeps turning. So when he grows up, he's gonna have a low opinion of women and be able to rationalize having sex with a child. How do you stop that from happening? (Huang) I think the answer lies in Meredith herself. If she truly wants to help Shane, she'll let us study her brain. Maybe we can really locate the part that creates a pedophile and then fix it. Meredith Rice hasn't changed. Patrol just responded to an incident at her address. (Bamford) My partner's with the victim. She took a pretty bad beating. She's going after another boy? This one fought back. You've got it backwards. There's no boy involved. So who attacked her? You heard the woman. She's not pressing charges. I am. Oh, Mrs. Madden, what happened here? That perverted bitch is still chasing my little boy! Is that true? I can explain. Tell it to the judge. She broke her restraining order. I want her arrested. What did she do? She called Shane, in my home. Thank God I happened to pick up the extension. What's wrong with you? Everything. And you think the best person to commiserate with is your 12-year-old victim? That's not why I called him. Tell them. Tell them why you called Shane! It doesn't matter why she called him. You broke one of the conditions of your probation. Which means you're under arrest. I thought he had a right to know. Know what? I'm pregnant. And I did agonize, but I felt like he needed to know. He is the father. She's having my baby's baby. (Stabler) Let's go. I want it terminated. It's not your decision, ma'am. You have no say over her reproductive rights. You didn't need to lay this on the little boy. What were you doin'? I don't know. My husband's leavin' me, my stepson won't even talk to me, I've lost my home, my job, and the irony is, all I've ever wanted is a baby of my own. Be careful what you wish for, huh? Wow. Do you know what Ayatollah Khomeini's first name was? What? Ruhollah. So? What'd you think it was? Ayatollah. Ayatollah's not a name. It's a title. Pffft! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you just give me a 'Pffft'? Like I'm some kind of idiot for thinking that Ayatollah could be a first name? Ok, you're not an idiot. It's just not a name, ok? Oh, really? It just so happens that I played high-school baseball with a guy named Ayatollah. Really? Yep. Ayatollah Rodriguez. That's funny. You never mentioned him before. Really? I never mentioned Tollie? That's weird, 'cause we were pretty tight. I actually took his sister Beth to the junior prom. Doug, I'm gonna make you an offer, okay? Stop talking right now, and we can pretend this never happened. I'm not gonna pretend my best friend from high school never happened. Hello? Yes, hello. This is, uh, Ayatollah Rodriguez. Is my old high-school baseball friend, Doug, there? Oy. Explain to me what I'm looking at? Before you judge me, let me walk you through it. I settled in, I started eating, and then I realized I didn't have a place to put the bones. I didn't want to put 'em on the sheets, 'cause you made it very clear you don't like that. Long story short, I've invented the shirt plate. Doug, I left dinner for you in the refrigerator. I didn't see it. No? 'Cause I labeled it "Doug's dinner. " Oh, I thought that said "Dog's dinner. " I figured you were surprising me with a puppy. Come on. This isn't funny. You're telling me. All day long, I thought I was getting a puppy. Honey, you promised me you would stick to your diet. Aren't you at all concerned about your health? I'll tell you what I am concerned about. My blue cheese cup am empty. Ow! Carrie! Look at this. Low-fat mayo, cottage cheese, garden burgers, all untouched. Why do I even bother buying this stuff? That's what I've been saying! Ow! You gotta find a new go-to move. Doug, it's just so frustrating. I mean over and over again, you promise me you're gonna lose weight, and then you actually do it, and then I'm so proud of you, and then every single time, without fail, you fall off the wagon. And then you eat the wagon. Calm down. I'll be fine. Doug, you're not fine, okay? Your eating is out of control. Would you back it off? Yeah, fine, fine. I will back off. Okay, 'cause I am tired of banging my head against the wall. W - You know what? Here, here. Have cookies for dinner, okay? I give up. I officially give up. You happy? What are you doing? ! You said you gave up! I'm telling you, Doug, as soon as I heard about this overeaters support group, I had a really good feeling about it. And I've got a bad feeling. It's called hunger. We just had a delicious dinner. It was salmon. Salmon's delicious. The hell it is. The only people who like salmon are bears. Okay, Doug, you really need this group, okay? And, listen, you're gonna be meeting people who are struggling with the same things you are. It's gonna be me and a roomful of big, fat losers! Now that is not true. Okay, they may be big, but they are not losers. I bet you they're really cool. Yeah, that guy they had to cut out of his apartment, he's super cool. Well, in a way, he was. I mean we're talking about him right now. And that's cool. I don't want to do this, come on. Honey, You have to go. I don't. You do. Doug... Sometimes when you look at me, I think you're seeing a giant pork chop with my head on it. With your head on it? Get over yourself. All right, go. Is there even any dip? Okay, people, let's get started. You there. You're new. What's your name? Me? Uh, Doug. Welcome, Doug. I'm Neil. Please, join us. Is this how to hem your own pants? No, Doug. This is a group for men in abusive relationships. Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here. I'll put these back. Except for this one,'cause I put a thumb print in it already. Doug, Yeah? We all know what you're going through. You're scared. You don't want to admit there's a problem, but you were brave enough to come here tonight. Be brave enough to stay. Really, I, uh- I don't belong here. We all felt that way at first, Doug. Yeah, it's true. So, why are you here tonight? You had doughnuts. And who doesn't let you have doughnuts, Doug? My wife. But the thing is- Does she ever yell at you about eating doughnuts? Yeah. Does it ever get physical? Hit you, slap you, throw things at you? Yesterday she... twisted my nipples. And does all of her anger just make you want to eat more? Okay. No, it's not okay, Doug. But it's how you get by, isn't it? So you're saying... my overeating is... her fault. I think that's what you're saying, Doug. Then she comes in like hell on wheels, "You're so fat!" "Don't eat that off your chest! I can't believe you're so fat!" She wonders why I gain weight. I mean, maybe it's 'cause all the names she calls me. You know. Fatty. Chunky. Sir Eats-a-Lot. So she starts yelling at the waiter. Now... I can't look at the poor guy, and I... certainly can't look at her, so I look down at my plate. Hello, jambalaya. You won't twist my nipples, will you? Mr. Big-pants. Fat Damon. Enormo the clown. Enormo. You know what? My name is Doug. Just Doug. It's just Doug. Hey, baby. How'd it go tonight? It was good. Have you been crying? A little. You get into some stuff in there. Oh, honey. I am so proud of you. Hey! Moron, watch where you're going! Magoo, mooooove! Friggin' idiot. I really appreciate you checking up on me, Neil, but I'm doing all right. Yeah, she's gonna be home any minute, so I can't stay on the phone much longer. Yes. No, I'll be at the meeting. All right then. I'll see you- What's that? Oh, yeah. I will not let the rage of others destroy the light in me. Okay. Hey, Doug, I'm just dropping off Arthur's bill, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. Are you an alcoholic? No. Oh, me, neither. So, w - What was that all about? Oh, it's a, uh, long story, but it turns out it's Carrie's anger that makes me eat so much. No! Yeah, I was surprised, too. Wow. How about that? This whole time, she had me convinced it was my fault, but my support group helped me realize that Carrie's bad temper is the problem. She drives me straight into the loving arms of food. Maybe that's what happened with my brother and his wife. Except that she drove him straight into the loving arms of their nanny. I'm gonna kill our pharmacist! Oh, God. Come. Through the back door. We'll drive all night. Come! Hey, Car. Hey. So, I go to pick up my prescription from the pharmacy, and I'm in line for like 20 freaking minutes, because the pharmacist is a million years old. Then I finally get to the front of the line, and Rip van Senile says, "That'll be $98." And I go, "No, our insurance covers this. ", and he says, "No, it doesn't. " I just- I hate old people. Where's our insurance bill? Um, maybe it's upstairs. Why would it be upstairs? Did you put it there? No, I - I was just trying to help you out. Why are you acting so weird? I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? I don't know. Well, just help me find it. You poor man. Hi, honey. Hey, I'm headin' out. Oh, you have your, uh, support group tonight? Yes, I do. I gotta tell you, Doug, I am really proud of you, honey. I mean, I know it was the last thing you wanted to do, but you did it, and you stuck with it, and now look at you. Doug? Yeah? Are you, um... getting fatter? No. No? 'cause it seems like you're much more... fatter. Can't be. I've been going to my overeaters group for weeks. Are you sure they're not teaching you how to overeat? Ah - You know what it is? They told me I'd gain weight before I lose it. Actually, that's their motto. "You'll gain weight before you lose it. " That's a bad motto. Mmm. Well, they're fat. They're not Shakespeare. I'll see you later. Hey, uh, what do you talk about at these classes? I mean, what gets said? What do you mean? Well, what's supposed to motivate you to lose weight? Oh, well first class, we talked about famous fat people, like Marlon Brando and that lady from The Practice. What's the point of that? It just gets us to feel like, "Hey, you know, maybe you're fat, but famous people are fat, too. " Uh-huh, uh-huh. What else? Uh, well, the second day, obviously, we talked about famous skinny people, like that other lady from The Practice. And, uh... Stan Laurel. Stan Laurel? Yeah, it gives us a goal of what we want to look like. And you want to look like Stan Laurel? Hey, from your lips to God's ears, huh? All right. Excuse me. Is, uh, Doug Heffernan here? Who? Doug Heffernan. He's in this class. No, we don't have anyone named Doug here. Isn't this the overeaters support group? No, this is Jazzercise. Why do you have to hurt? You know what it is? You gotta continuously remind yourself, it's not your fault. Oh, my god. This is made with real butter. Hello, Doug. Carrie. Oh, God. Maury, this is, uh, my wife, Carrie. Hello. Okay, you have 5 seconds to tell me what's going on here. What's going on here is I'm in the middle of my overeaters group. Doug, you're eating cake. Yes, but what you didn't see is we eat the cake while looking at a picture of Hitler. That's how they get us to hate cake. Yuck! Okay, what is going on? What group is this? All right. It might be a class for men in abusive relationships. What? Yeah, that's right. I came for the doughnuts, but I stayed for the insights. What insights? Well, I learned that... your anger makes me eat. What? ! That's right. Whenever you get mad, you start yelling at me, I need an escape, so I turn to food. That makes you my- What do you call her again? Your behavior catalyst. Behavior catalyst, okay? So if you want to blame somebody for my weight, maybe you should take a hard look in the mirror. You're a lying sack of crap. Great. Now I'm hungry. Carrie... I'm Neil. Welcome. Mm-hmm. Doug is simply trying to break a cycle of verbal and physical abuse. Physical abuse? He told you that I physically abuse him? He told us about everything, Carrie. The purple nurples. The atomic wedgies. That scar on his arm. You got that scar from a hot-dog eating contest! Yeah, a hot-dog eating contest I only entered because you're so mean! Oh, really? And did you also set a new record 'cause I'm so mean? Could be. Let me ask you something, Neil. Did he happen to mention that he was fat the day that I met him? Well, no. No. Because he was. Yeah, what were you then? Huh? High two hundreds? No, not high. Mid to high. And did he also happen to mention that he was the biggest kid in nursery school? That all the other parents thought he was a teacher? No. No. Tell him about the special desk, Doug. All right, fine! So maybe I was fat when I met you, but you know what? You're still an angry person. Well, I'm angry because you're always eating. And I'm always eating 'cause you're always angry. Okay, looks like we have a little chicken-and-egg thing going on right now. Oh, I bet you want to have chicken and eggs now, huh? Okay, that's it. You know what? I'll go to my overeaters group if you go to an anger management group. I don't need anger management. Oh, really? Well why don't you tell that to Maury, who you almost ran over, or that pharmacist who you yelled at, or that librarian you got fired? All right, okay, sometimes I get mad, but that's only because I have to. Oh, really? Why don't you tell that to the sidewalk Santa that you cursed out last Christmas? Let me tell you something. If it'll make you go down a couple of neck sizes, I will go to anger management. Great, 'cause they have a class going on upstairs right now. Well, I'll go if you'll go to your overeaters group. Fine! Let's do it! Let's do it! This is for the chicken-and-egg crack. This is great. We haven't had date night in a while. I know. Well, we deserve it. I mean, you're sticking to your diet. Got my rice cakes. And, uh. I've mellowed out. It's-it's much better. Much better. And my nipples have healed up nicely. Those are taken. Oh, okay. Excuse me. Uh, uh, uh. Those, too. All the way down to that guy. Okay, one guy saving 20 seats. No law against that. See? How good was I? That was very good. But where are we gonna sit? Never sat in the front row before. Me, neither. Mmm. Plain. Tell me if anything good happens over there. Right. Yeah, I think it's great that we're trying to improve ourselves. Oh, yeah. I just think that all these improvements are upsetting our balance as a couple. Yeah. Something's a little off, right? I mean, what should we do? Well, I'm just gonna throw this out at you, okay? What if I were to, uh, let you eat these Milk Duds? Would you let me go back there to the seats we're supposed to be in, and drop-kick that douche into the lobby? I didn't hear a word after "Milk Duds. " Thank God. What, do you own the movie theater? Move the coat, or I'm gonna shove it down your throat! There you go. Check it out. I made a Milk Dud sandwich. It's a dudwich. Ron was supposed to be saving these seats for us. You're up again. You're all gonna die. Hello, darling. Managed to slip away, but I think I sprang my bloody wrist. Oh, John... How is work? Fine, thanks. I'm doing a big abstract to the International Exhibition. How's yours? I might be making some progress in the Ridgeway's Disease. I've a patient in Hammersmith Hospital, Mrs. Crabtree, she's a driver's wife, I believe, she's dying of Ridgeway's. But she's allowed me to try some new treatments on her. By God, she's got some spirit! Poor, frightened old thing that she is. And all I get from Gerda is, "Why are you out so late?" Well, sometimes you're with me. Hmm, but all the time I'm married to Gerda. It's what you wanted, isn't it? Yes. Will I see you this weekend? - Yes. Are you going? - Yes. - Well, that will be lovely. - Yes. Henrietta, come here. It's going to be a complete disaster. It's always the same when I invite Gerda. I wish I hadn't, but the worst thing is that she's so terribly nice. One has to have her, of course, it would be so terribly rude to invite John without her. On the other hand, it does seem so odd, doen't it? Someone as nice as Gerda should be so voyd of any kind of intelligence. I often think, if she had any spirit at all, she'd stay away. Henrietta will help, of course. Strange how good Henrietta is with Gerda. - What're you talking about, Lucy? - The weekend is upon us, Midge. The guests will be arriving any minute. And I'm just trusting to Henrietta to make conversation, because John and Gerda it's a nightmare, John and Gerda. Lucy, do you know what time it is? I'm sorry, darling, I have absolutely no idea what time it is. It's a quarter past six! Midge, I am sorry! Why didn't you tell me? Come, come, come, go back to your dreams. Good night. - There you are, Mrs. Pearstock. - Thank you very much, Dr. Christow. Goodbye. Are you alright? I'm tired. A weekend in the country will make you feel better. Yes. Unfortunately, Gerda is driving. - Victor! - Mr. Poirot, sir, have a good trip? Without incident, thank you. Victor, Victor, what is that smell? - Smell? Can't smell anything, sir. Just good country air. Collie, the telephone number is on the pad, in the surgery. Call me if there's trouble. There'll be no trouble, Dr. Christow. - Goodbye, children. - Bye, daddy! Be good! It won't start. Switch on the ignition, Gerda! - I'm so stupid. I'm sorry. - Let's just get there, shall we? I wish we could stay at home. The Angkatell frighten the life out of me. - Goodbye, children! - Bye mummy. Bye daddy! The weather's said fair for the weekend. Everything's spick and span (immaculate) at the cottage, the wife's seen to that. I am sure I shall be most comfortable. It will be a relief, I expect, escape the fumes and stink of London. I say! Milles tonnerres! Why must you spent so many hours at the hospital when you've a perfectly surgery at home? It's research, Gerda! Research, as I've explained before. - Why are you slowing? - It might be about to turn red. - But it isn't, is it? It's green. - Oh! Sorry... I just become convinced it'd suddenly... Oh, God, Gerda! Gudgeon! Hello, Midge! Great to see you! - What a gorgeous car! - He's a Legonda. Goes like the wind! Thank you, Gudgeon. - Hello, Lucy. - Henrietta! Wonderful to see you. I supose that, by the time you take that magificent steed of yours to the stable, give it a rub down and a nosebag, lunch might be ready. - Who's coming? - The Christow. - And Edward's arriving after lunch. - Good. Looks like you'll have some company, Mr. Poirot. Someone has taken the cottage next door. Mr. Poirot! Enchanté, Madame. Everything is beautiful, as usual. But tell me, someone has taken up residence at Dovecotes? Yes, sir. A lady. An actrice, they say. How's the dreaded dress shop? Bloody awful! - Hello there! - Edward! Hello, Midge! Hello, Henrietta! But tell me, Madame Simms, what is this? I did not expect any mail to this address. It's from Lady Angkatell, up at The Hollow. Pour ce soir? How are things at Ainswick, Edward? Just as lovely as ever? Why don't you come and see? You're always welcome. Anytime. Anytime at all. You are sweet. And Ainswick is the best place in the world. Do you remember our special tree? Igdrasil. The secret sign we used to draw everywhere? Fancy a breath here? My God! Igdrasil. Who drew that? You did. So, what've you been doing, since I saw you last? Nothing. That sounds... peaceful. You could find peace at Ainswick, with me. I wish I wasn't so dreadfully fond of you, Edward. Makes it so much harder to go on saying " no". What you really mean is that you won't marry me because of John Christow. - Why doesn't the fellow get a divorce? - Because... That's it, isn't it? If there'd be no John Christow in the world, you'd marry me. I used to spent my holidays with Edward, at Ainswick. It seemed so vast. 14.000 acres, is bound to be vast, Midge. Oh, how I miss it! - Why didn't you inherit it, Lucy? - Midge, you know very well girls don't inherit. It's the way the world wags. Edward isn't even my cousin, he's family's second cousin. But he's still in tail. Ainswick falls like rain, right plop in his lap. - Aren't you remotely bitter about that? - No, of course not. I've invited that crime fellow for dinner. I'm sorry? That's why I was in your bedroom so early, this morning. I had this premonition, you see. That we were to have terrible foughts, for dinner. So, him being here, just could be a distraction. What crime man, Lucy? He was in Bagdad when Henry was High-Comissionary. He stays in one of those funny little cottages, down the lane. I remember he wore this pink flower on his button hole and he was solving something, I can't quite remember what. But of course I'm not terribly interested on who killed whom. I mean, once you're dead, you're dead it doesn't matter why, does it? I'm no good in anything. I don't know why you ever married me. You needed taking care of, that's why I married you. I try to be a good wife, John. This may not be the best time to tell you... You know I love you, don't you? Of course I know, but I have to warn you... No one else, just you. We'll never make it to Shovel Down in third. Very fair shooting, Edward. Now, there. Your turn, Henrietta. See if you can kill a burglar. - Well done! - No, you only winged him. Hello, everyone! Hello, Henry! - It's the Christow! - Hello. So sorry we're late. Not at all, not at all, just in time for sporting target practice. Nice to see you, John. Now then, Gerda, come along. - Try to put one in bullseye. I've never tried. - Hello, darling. - Darling. - I think you may have met Midge Hardcastle? - Yes, of course. And of course you know my second cousin, Edward. - How do you do, Edward? - Hello, John. - What's going on? - Henry's brought the artillery. Has he indeed? I sprang my bloody wrist. Careful. Did I miss? I bet I missed. My turn, is it? Gerda, how lovely to see you! Thank you, Henry. Come along, Gudgeon. I say, Lucy! That's nothing. Once, on the Asian side of the Bosphorus, I was jumped by a couple of thugs. We were rolling about in the dirt, we were. Then, before I knew it, she'd shot one in the leg and one in stomach. How she didn't hit me, God alone knows! It's quite simple! You do it very quickly and you don't think about it, Henry. Sena has in ballet class. Point shoes, the whole lot. - And Terence? - Chemistry. Always trying to blow things up. He's planning to make nitroglycerine while were away. - But don't tell John anything. - Oh, I shan't. - And you? - Oh, I've taken up Leathercraft. Do you like this? I made it. It's so nice talking to you. But I suppose it will soon be time for dinner. Gerda why do you come here if you hate it so much? I want John to be happy. - He could come without you. - No, he wouldn't like that. He wouldn't enjoy it without me. He said so. John is overly unselfish. I'd rather stay in Harley Street, to be frank, but he thinks it is good for me, to get out into the country. Oh, the country's alright. No need to throw in the Angkatells We're an odious family. Come on, let's go in and get changed. There's some sort of detective coming in, apparently. You wouldn't believe it. Monsieur Poirot has habilities one has to say, quite phenomenal. It's absolutely true, the talk about there was in Bagdad. Monsieur Poirot and his little "green" cells. Grey, Madame. Pardon me. But we're awfully lucky to have him as a neighbour. I mean, in case anything went wrong. Would you give it all up if I asked you to? And come and live with me? No. No? It's not really what you want. Couldn't you lie to me, just once? - Why? - Because I love you, Henrietta. But you're so... damn it all, so detached. Your art, your cars, your friends. I want you to think you only need me. Isn't that what Gerda does? Don't you tell me you care a damn about Gerda. Why not? I like Gerda. - Dinner, Milady. - Thank you, Gudgeon Please, Monsieur Poirot. Come this way. Merci. Has anyone seen John? Well, the customers are awful! One has to put up far more insolence in a dress shop than Gudgeon or Simmons or any decent domestic does here. It must be absolute hell, darling. But why does one has to be so proud? Anyone having to earn one's living, doesn't have to be the end, has it? It's all about self-esteem, surely? You're the expert on that. So, how do you do it then, Monsieur Poirot? I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle? To solve so many crimes? Merely I use the
