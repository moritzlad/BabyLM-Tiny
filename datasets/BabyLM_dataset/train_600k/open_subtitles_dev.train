the service entrance instead of going through the reception desk! - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - We're from television. We want to shoot 3 scenes for a co-production film. He's clean. We need to settle the conditions. Speak to our marketing manager. Maybe we'll come for a game some day too. It was a pleasure, gentlemen! What a show-down! The shame of it! You were no help at all. I'm sorry. I'll get you the money. Good afternoon. - Let me help you with that. - I can manage. - It would be my pleasure. - All right then. Thank you, it's kind of you. - Been traveling again? - I've been to Ostrava with my husband. They played against Banik. So your husband is a soccer player? Yes, for the Sparta club. And you go with him? I have to. He's terribly jealous. That's understandable. - I'll take them up for you. - That'd be nice of you. It's the fifth floor, the door on the left. - How about coming along? - No. Thank you. - Thank you very much, Mr... - Hana. I can't use you like this, Mr. Hana. You may. Anything. Madame. Thank you, I'll be seeing you. - Is that her? - Yeah. Will she lend us some money? Buy a big bouquet to set the mood. Then leave it to me. Good morning. - Hello, uncle Ed! - I've brought a customer. He needs a special bunch of flowers. For you, Uncle, they'll be very special. Hello. What kind? What sort of price? Up to about 1000 crowns. For what occasion? Who are they for? For the French ambassador's wife. In that case lilies would be splendid. - How's Venda doing? - As usual. Her husband is an alcoholic. Or orchids? Or roses? I've got lots. I'll leave it up to you, Marcela. How long is it since your Mom... Just yesterday I wanted to buy flowers for her grave. That's nice of you. And someone stole my wallet! With my month's pension in it! I went all hot and cold. - I burst into tears. - Tell her why! Why? All my money for the month... Tell her, don't be shy. Yes... all of it... He'll lose the chance for a wonderful role. What role? He's been chosen for a film about a concentration camp. To play an old mime who saves 80 Jewish children. Seriously? If he learns tap-dancing within two months. That's easy. You'll be in a movie, uncle Ed? - Wonderful! - But he wants to refuse since the American dance teacher wants 50 dollars a lesson. Fifty dollars? That much? And how many lessons. .... Ten. That's 20 000 Czech crowns, but he gets 10 000 dollars for the part! Ten thousand? That's nearly half a million! Half a million? I'm sorry, uncle Ed. I can't lend you the money. Venda's drinking, the tax man, school fees. 950 crowns! - Pay up! - You have the money. Here you go. - Keep the change. - Bye, and thank you! What do I do with the flowers? Put them on your sister's grave. I heard that Mary Grulich had her 855th birthday. - How about... - So let's catch a taxi! - 'Bye for now, and take care. - Good morning. I just brought Mary her shopping. She's in a bad way, her legs, poor thing, that tiny pension and she forgets everything. She owes me 2000 but I'm not saying anything. She'll be pleased to see you, gentlemen. - No way! - Oh yes! We come with our congratulations on behalf of the theatre. They all send their regards. They remembered! You were the pride of the theatre for 40 years! The oldest chorus-girl in history. And a soloist, boys, but you wouldn't remember. In '41 I sang Helena in Polish Blood as stand-in. The lead tenor gave me these flowers afterwards and this bottle of old Spanish wine. How we loved Polish Blood! We all wanted to sing Count Baransky. I know since you're a cavalier... I am not right for you, dear... I'm just a maid, after all... It's over and done with now. You've made me so happy, boys. I slept right through my horrible birthday. But now we'll celebrate! I saved it for 60 years for the right occasion. Open it! Vintage 1930! - Here's a cork-screw. - What an honor for us. You were always the princess of our dreams. This wine's so good it doesn't want to come out! How much is there left? The flowers, taxi... 6000 of your money. I left 2000 under Mary's vase. You are so kind, Fanda. Good deeds pave the way to heaven. But is there an afterlife? Who knows. Just in case... so be good. Give that boy a hundred. - A whole hundred bill? - For both of us. - Isn't that too much? - You don't want to get to heaven? - Here you go. - Right on. Thank you very much. Stop! Stop thief! - I feel like crying, Fanda. - That won't help. - Good, he didn't take my ID card. - What will you do? I'll have to tap into the funeral savings. How about selling something? The anatomists buy skeletons. But they don't take baldies. Seriously, what will you do? We're down to our last thousand. So let's let off some steam. Come on, do something! Can't you see that I can't see? Bring me the funeral savings book. I'm going to the bank. - Where is it? - In the big dish. It's not in the dish. But I put it there. Here it is. My, you scared me. I think you'd better... not open it. - Fanda! - I took out thirty thousand. Thirty thousand? ! D'you want to borrow my glasses? I'm not going to scream. I'm going to kill you. Well, I understand how you feel... - So you understand? - Absolutely. So why did you take the only money we have? I've been betting on your birth date in the lottery for 30 years. I expect to hit the jackpot now. What have you done with the money? I was sorry that you'd only ever been to Hungary. I wanted to buy you a holiday in Hurghada. - Where? - The Red Sea, Luxor, Karnak, Queen Hatshepsovet's Temple. I'm not going to any Hukarda! You won't, because a bogus blind man stole the money. The Red Sea. A bogus blind man! D'you expect me to believe you? - No. - So why make up these lies? - Why deceive me? - You're shouting. Yes, let everyone hear that my husband's a liar and thief who ruins my health and shortens my life. I can't even die decently because of him! But I've had enough of your silly pranks. Kill it! The moth! - Put that paper back. - I will, after I've read it. He complained someone's stealing his paper! How does he know? It's in place when he comes home. Yes, with the crossword puzzle done. He can't do it himself anyway. Don't smoke. You'll cough. I cough better when I smoke. By the way, I want that 30 000 back. And tie your shoelace. I'll think it over. Till then you'll give me all of your pension. That might make you take life seriously at last. - What did you say? - It's going to be a lovely day! When we've done the shopping we're going to Jara's to look after the children. - Josef! What a coincidence! - Josef who? A scene-shifter from the theater... See you at the yogurt counter. It was parked here! My new car! I saved up for it for five years. I didn't notice it. What color was it? Yellow. Stolen with Agapornis fisheri - What am I going to do? - You must report it. Come, I'll take you to the police station. Those jerks are supposed to watch this parking lot. Let's go! Two luxury villas. And a magnificent mansion for 60 million. - But that's 200 miles away. - It looks splendid. But 155 rooms, that's not really enough. There are servants' quarters with 10 rooms. It would make an exclusive bed and breakfast place! Good idea. Antique furniture, oriental rugs, old paintings and the prettiest waitresses in period costumes. - Or without... - Hey, control yourself. Beauty queens, anyway. 36,24, Make the arrangements so they take us there. I'm due for a medical check-up. If the worst comes to the worst would you look after my dog. He's an old softie. He's bitten me twice! That's a token of love, he bites me too when I go out. He stands on a chair by the window and I wave to him so he knows I'll be back. Old age is sad. One should die young. We missed our chance. We gotta stick it out now. Easy for you to say. I cry when I hear an oompah band. I see those sad, abandoned doggie eyes. I'd shoot myself if it wasn't for you. In that case aim for the heart to be sure. A tip from the court pathologist. It's a trophy from the theatre. What's the problem, anyway? Kidneys, high blood pressure, cataracts. You are lucky! I've got arrhythmia, gall-bladder, prostate - but it's all better than having AIDS. You're such a lucky fellow, Fanda. - Help me, please! - Come on. - No! Don't be scared, it's safe! - Oh God. Do something, sing! - Don't be frightened. Oho, cried Robin Hood... I'll give you Robin Hood! Stop! We'll ride up and down until he cools off. Sing! Stop! Calm down. It's perfectly safe. - What's all this? - Hello Dad. Well you see Kveta... I mean Erna... You see if we do move to that home. Jara has to furnish this room for Kveta. I've been there. It's a very nice place. You could move in within two months. I am not moving out of here. - We have to help them, Fanda. - No, we don't. like my meal now. - Sorry. Enjoy. We just need to make About what? I'm staying here, in my apartment. Jara bought us this place. And he brought me the 30 thousand you were robbed of. Good, because if you hound me out of here, you'll be needing that money, dear. What... Who's driving you out? Where are you going? - I don't feel well. - What's wrong? How could you sell me like this? Mrs. Hanova... Fanda is dead. He's dead. He came here awfully upset, sat down and suddenly collapsed. He didn't regain consciousness. I don't believe it. Why didn't the doctor save him? Why didn't he help him, Mr. Stara? She's arrived by taxi carrying a black suit. By taxi. Now we're screwed. Look, a funeral van. Go on ahead, Mom. Watch your step. I'm sorry. He fainted. He went dead white and stopped breathing. Don't cry, everything will be all right! You said the doctor couldn't help him. I thought I called the ambulance... So was the doctor here or wasn't he? No. Ed wanted to help me. So that you'd realize what you'd lose in him. And he sort of overdid it a bit. The taxi cost 500, the coffin 3000! The fright nearly cost me my life! You put him up to it! You criminal! You liar! You heartless brute! This way... I can't go on. I refuse to live with him. - So what's with the coffin? - Take it away. - That'll cost you. - We'll settle it right now. Hello Dad, hello Ed. Dad! Move in with me, nobody'll bother you and you can do as you like. Emilie Hanova and Frantisek Hana. Applicant, please clarify your petition for a divorce. I made my statement in writing and have nothing to add. How long have you been together? For 44 years. A long time. You went through a lot together. Good things and bad. Is your marriage now so seriously impaired - That it cannot be saved? - Yes. Does the applicant's lawyer have any questions? Did your husband often spend his whole pension without contributing to the household? Do you know what he spent the money on? - Different things. - Give us some examples. I asked him to visit his father's grave and he returned a week later from some spa. He lost his month's pension and 4000 crowns at the Casino. But he didn't go there to gamble, he heard about the sightseeing flights and he always had longed to see the world from a bird's-eye view. But there was fog, he had to wait for good weather and he gambled the money away out of boredom. And he spent your savings in expensive restaurants. He had a poor childhood. During the depression his father split matches in half to save money and as a boy he served beers in a gadren pub. He wanted to see what it's like to be rich. Did you tolerate his behavior? No, but when I was mad he brought me flowers and I always forgave him. - Any more questions? - That will be all. As the respondent, do you have anything to say? It's true, the applicant always forgave me but I didn't appreciate it. You may sit down. For the records... - Well? How's it going? - Badly. Witness Jaroslav Hana. Just as an example. Once mother persuaded him to look after his grandchildren for a while. He took my two little girls to a cafe by taxi. To a smoky cafe... He ordered champagne, they all got tipsy and he forgot them on the subway. But Dad's a very kind man. He's fun and he's generous, but... Incompetent. Being so irresponsible, he's just not fit for marriage. Life with him really is sheer martyrdom. It's very hard for me to have to say this. Mother thought he'd grow wise with age but this last thing was a very cruel trick and mother realized she couldn't stand more. Can you describe this cruel trick? He put his friend up to it... Ed... Mr. Stara told mother that Dad had died at his place. - Do you wish to speak? - Yes. Out with it, Mom. It was a terrible thing to do, devastating. Although I admit I went against him when our son wanted our flat for his ex-wife and kids. and arranged to move us to an old folks' home. He refused, and for my effort to help our son he punished me so cruelly. Me, who always forgave him for all his crazy ideas. Because I admired him for being so different. I'm a stick-in-the-mud sort of person, studying maps. He means to fly round the world in a balloon, and he refuses to admit that our paths don't really lead anywhere anymore. It's intolerable. The older he gets, the crazier he is. He doesn't go to funerals, he makes fun of death, he makes paper darts out of death announcements. I don't know if he wants to be buried or cremated! He doesn't know the price of bread, but follows the dollar exchange rate. When the dollar dropped he bought me 8000 crowns worth for Xmas. He throws money around and saves money - by stealing our neighbor's newspaper. He always returns it in time but I'm on tenterhooks he'll be caught at it. When we took the train to his dad's grave he didn't buy any tickets. The inspector caught us but Fanda proudly paid the fine and left him a tip! The inspector burst into tears. And when I scold him he says I'm right and just goes on doing it. I've been listening carefully. I feel that in your own way you still love your husband despite his shortcomings. Let me ask you again. Are you fully convinced of your incompatibility? Please tell me, with your whole heart and conscience. Do you insist on a divorce? No. Even though I know I'm going to regret it. You heard the applicant's decision. Do you wish to say anything? I want to state that I love my wife and that I'll mend my ways. Thank you. - Nice, isn't it? - Yes. Nice. Jara'll hew off THE VANOUS FAMILY and put up THE HANA FAMILY in gold We'll have our photos taken. I want them on the gravestone. - Isn't it beautiful? - It's very nice here. Don't smoke here, Fanda. It's not fitting... I don't want to harp at you, but... No, that's all right. Done. No, I'd be so glad if you stopped smoking. All right. If you mind that much. It's not because of me. Smoking causes cancer. ... say the health warnings. Exactly. Please bring up some water. The tap's back there by the morgue. Right behind you. Here we'll keep what you save by not smoking. Have you finished all the crosswords again? The storekeeper said they're difficult. Some are, some aren't. Mr. Stara, please leave Fanda alone. No. He does not want to talk to you. Why? What a question! He was nearly divorced because of you! You're going to the hospital? Yes. I'll tell him. Goodbye. That was Ed. He says he's going to the hospital. Which one? He didn't say. Who knows if it's true. He has high blood pressure and his kidney's failing. You should try for a crossword puzzle prize. The storekeeper won a book and 1500 crowns once. - Shall I wash the dishes? - After dinner. Now grind the poppy seeds and take your vitamins. Isn't it wonderful being together like this, - With you helping me. - Yes. Wonderful. Marie from Brod has died! Which Marie? My dad's step-brother's son's wife. I didn't know her. Look how cheap-Iooking the announcement is. - I don't care. - About anything, I know. Luckily it won't be up to you. Here's everything ready for when I die. My death announcement, the undertaker's phone number, my coffin clothes, the addresses where to send the announcements. The funeral music, flowers, even your announcement. So check it to see if you like it. Hello, I'm Mr. Stara's neighbor. - Yes? - Can I speak to Mr. Hana? - Come in. - Thanks. Come on, Bobby! I couldn't find you, pal. Sure... - Got a cigarette? - Don't play the fool. I thought you were paralyzed. Only my right arm and right leg. Not bad here, is it? Fine. That one kicked it. That one's been moved to a loony-bin. He kept walking naked into the nurses' room demanding erotic massages. So how are you doing? I'm training for the wheelchair races. But the damn thing keeps swerving to the left. You'll have to go see the mansion on your own. No, I'll wait for you. Such a beautiful mansion, a really nice place to live. So let's buy it. They might give us a discount. My savings book is in that drawer. Take it. Good idea, we'll borrow the rest. I hope it's enough for my funeral. To hell with that. I'm giving up, Fanda. Should we never meet again, it's been wonderful, it's been just enough. Stop it, stupid. Listen to this, there's a young nurse here who... but you must light up for this story. I don't smoke any more. It's gone too fast. I meant to visit Dad's birthplace. - I'll take you there. - Take me back to bed. Life isn't worth a light and it won't get better. You mustn't give up. Your dog's waiting. God! I can't even take a piss on my own! Hello, Mr. Hana. Will you wait outside for me, Dad? I wanted to say goodbye but you were out. I'm moving to my mother's in Kolin. Cologne? Not that far. Thanks for everything. It's pure hell at home. I don't sleep at all. Don't mention it today. - Hello Dad. - Grandpa! We've got visitors! Which one are you? Karolina? - No, Marketa! - We're going to move here. Be quiet, girls! Sorry, Dad. The two women keep gassing about it in front of them. I'm not angry. I'll have to check out the home for senior citizens. - You don't want to go, do you? - Yes I do. You look like you're going to your execution. the train's here. Listen, I don't want you forced into this. I'd like to see it. If we're moving there. You said you would never move. The situation was different then. Come, let's go home. We missed the train anyway. I've lost a shoe! Here... hold me up... Your coffee. Thanks. You fell asleep again. - No. - Yes! It's getting worse! You snore away all day or sit hunched up by the window like that poor man downstairs. You don't talk, don't smoke, don't drink, don't sing, don't quarrel. I can't stand it any more! - I wanted to please you. - Please me? What happened to you? I married a cheerful man with crazy ideas, with whom I laughed and argued all day and nowadays you sit here like a living corpse, like some dope who doesn't care that I'm unhappy. That I can't live like this! And I won't! Mr. Stara... Forgive me for bothering you, I need your advice. It's about Fanda. He's unhappy. He's terribly unhappy, and I don't know what to do. - Where are you going? - We're are going on a trip. - Where to? - To buy a mansion. Go and get ready. Wait. It's not that simple. It's all arranged. Ed gave me instructions. Who did you say you are? The wife of an emeritus member of the New York Met who is returning to his native country. Is the agent going too? The owner's representative will be at the mansion. What did Ed say? How is he? Poor man, he's going into a geriatric unit. I said we'd come and tell him how it went. I'll get it. I understand. How can you say I'm not supportive? But the situation has changed. You have everything, Jara. Money, a job, your youth - and you have time. We don't have any time. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. No, it's you who complicated things, dear. You shouldn't have gone after all those women. That's all. 'Bye. Hurry up! He's not there! He sat there dead for Come on, then. Look, the trees are blooming! I feel good. Aren't you well? I'm scared to death. Don't worry, you only feel that way the first time. Let's hope I make it through this. - Turn around and drive back. - Yes, sir. Very shabby. I'm not taking it. What? What's happening? Nothing. The place is too small and neglected. I don't think you'd like it here. -So how you been doing, man? -You know, for the most part, I'm fine. " For the most part." Which I'm gonna interpret as meaning though you're not down now, you have something on your mind. So why don't you just tell me what's on your mind? Nothing, really. Which, to tell you the truth, is kind of the problem. I can't figure out what the hell to do with myself. -You're not going back to USC, huh? -No. And that I know is the right decision. But, unfortunately, that's about all I know. Come on. You've gotta cut yourself a little break here. Life did just throw you one hell of a curve ball. All you really need is time. Before you know it, you'll be full of confidence, up to your old tricks. -And you have come to the right place. -Oh, yeah? Yeah. You're talking to the king of directionless. That's what I was doing with those years of high school folly. I was perfecting the life without purpose. Last year you could've gotten away with that burst of self-deprecation... -...but this year, you seem fairly driven. -Yeah, I know. lt's terrible, isn't it? But what can I say? I love the kitchen life. I even love the crass kitchen attitude. -Sandwich? -Sure. But, inevitably along with the crass kitchen attitude comes the grillside drama. Yeah. lt all started with me trying to help this girl out of her very self-destructive relationship. But then you throw in a little dash of my very poorly thought-out attraction to her and her absolute lack of attraction to me and you get where l'm coming from. Oh, that sucks. Wanna talk about it? No. To tell you the truth, it's really not all that interesting. And it's nothing you should be troubling yourself with given everything that's been on your mind lately. Well for what it's worth, the Pacey I know would figure out a way to help the girl, no matter what the drama. is that so? Without a doubt. Okay. Joey, it's time for a study break. I've been nodding off on the same sentence to the point of drool. -lt's just-- lt's not pretty. -Well, you don't have to ask me twice. Sweet. So where's Jack? Deep in the land of Frat. Did he tell you about this Winter Formal thing? Yeah, that actually sounds vaguely familiar to me. But to be quite honest, all the Greek speak sounds like.... Well, Greek to me. I get it. He wouldn't ask you to the caveman hoopla so I get stuck with the surrogate date duties. I feel for you. I do. Watching Jack pretend to be one with the thick-necked brotherhood. Come on. lt can't be that bad. I'm sure Grams has some prescription medication somewhere that would help you a lot through this, Joey. Thanks, but I think I'll manage. Hey, Jen.... Speaking of the men in our lives how's Dawson these days? You're asking me? Well, it's- - You know I haven't seen him for a while, and I know that you two hang out and I guess I just needed to know that he's doing all right. He's better. He.... He's been seeing a shrink, which I think is really good for him, you know? He's gonna be fine. That's exactly what I needed to hear. It's been.... lt's been kind of hard getting used to not being the one to see him through this, you know? And I think I'm finally okay with it which is hard to admit without feeling like a total jerk. Oh, stop it, Joey. You're not a jerk. I've been meaning to tell you that I can't think of a better person to be there for him right now than you. I'm really glad that you're there for him. Thank you. All right, simmer down, ladies. No offence, Jack. We got a lot to do for tonight's formal and little time after this meeting. So let's get to it. A, this is our biggest event before the break. B, it must be perfect. And C everybody must get laid. You should all be hooked up with a date by now. But for those of you chumps without one... -...meet the list. -Yes, the list! In the spirit of house love, I need names, people. Decent-looking honeys... -...ready to put out. -What about Debbie? -What about Suzanne? -Alison! Alison! No, no. What about those fine-ass Worthington chicks? Come on, dog. We know you got some hottie friends. And we know you're not looking to score with them. -Jacky! -Talk! Talk! Come on, please, talk! All right, all right, all right. I may know a girl that meets the specified requirements. Hey, I got dibs on whatever this guy's got, okay? I've seen these quality chicks McPhee hangs with. So our main man Eric's got himself a date. Okay, I am aware how absurd what I'm about to say is gonna sound but I'm also aware of how miserable your love life makes you and I can't sit and watch you hurt especially when I know I can do something. I'm here to ask you out. -l can't go on a date with you, Pacey. -Okay, that's fine. Then you don't have to think of it as a date. Think of it as an opportunity to compare and contrast. A free trial run at a life without heartache. -Pacey, you know I can't. -Actually, I know that you can. You need a break from your relationship. I need a break from your relationship. I'm promising to leave the kinky underwear at home I might even stop by CVS and steal a bottle of cologne. What do you say? Do I have any reason to feel hope? You have my word. I will keep this whole thing completely platonic. Fine. A friendly outing on the town, nothing more. Excellent. You rock. So pick you up around 7? Seven. This is your friend Pacey you're talking about? Yeah, but it's not just him, it's all my friends. lt's like they.... l don't know. lt's been two months and everybody's still.... They're holding things back from me. Like they're trying to protect me. You know, I mean, they look at me like this- - As this fragile, breakable thing instead of just Dawson, the person. And I know they mean well, it's just it makes it virtually impossible to move on. -Have you mentioned this to them? -Yeah. Well-- No, actually. No, I haven't mentioned it to them. What about the film festival you told me about? Isn't that coming up? It's this weekend. Are you going? Hadn't planned on it, no. It might be good to take life on the road for a little while. Help clear your mind. You could even take one of those friends you feel so estranged from. Come on. There must be someone you can take. Well, this little ditty goes out to all you brave souls out there surviving a heartbreak. Trust me, better things will come. -Hello! -Hey! Oh, and don't worry. That sleazebag formerly known as our boyfriend Charlie is not here today. -That's a good thing. -Yeah, that's always a good thing. But you know what? Even if he were here, it wouldn't really matter to me. -Really? -Yep. I think that time has finally done its healing thing. -Hey, what's up? -Nothing. I just wish I had your self-control. I mean, I know I should be puking at the mention of Charlie's name but I find myself daydreaming about him. His latest attempt to woo us back with that whole " l've changed" pitch. Which " l've changed" pitch? All those corny love letters he keeps sending. Doesn't it seem, sometimes, in that moment when you crawl in bed alone like, " Hey, maybe he really did change"? Gosh. I don't know which love letters you mean. -Hasn't he been sending you letters? -No. He's trying to woo you back, huh? That's-- Jen, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? No, no, no! Please don't apologize. I swear, it's fine. I was just saying to you that it doesn't matter to me. I want corny love letters. I just don't understand why he chose her and not me. -ls there something wrong with me? -Jen, there's nothing wrong with you. It's just.... All this time, I thought he was cheating on us on equal ground, you know? But, no, she got to be the girlfriend and I was just the floozy. Floozy? -Yeah? -You said "floozy"? -lt's what I am. I'm a floozy. -Oh, Jen. This is supposed to be the other way around. -l'm supposed to be consoling you. -No, please. It's the least I can do, and believe it or not, it's helping me a lot. I just don't wanna be here. The thought of running into either of them makes me wanna puke. Okay, so let's get out of here, then. This weekend. Well, I'm game. Where do you wanna go? You ever been to Hooksett, New Hampshire? No. Can I tell you something? I am so psyched to be going to this formal. I was so excited when Jack called. Granted, last-minute arrangements can be annoying and blind dates can be as dangerous as gator wrestling- - Joey you're hogging the mirror. -Freak. -Oh, God! Hello, hideous! Do I even like any of my clothes? Audrey, you look great. Besides, I don't know what the big deal is. As much as I wanna give Jack credit I'm sure it's just frat debauchery masquerading as an event. Okay, killjoy. First off, Jack said this Eric guy is hella cute which, right off, sounds interesting to me. And for someone as progressive as you it's amazing how close-minded you are about frats. The words " progressive" and "frat" do not belong in the same sentence. What about this one? Joey, we're going on a double date. -A little cheer, please. -Okay, okay. Well, if nothing else, at least I'll have a good time with Jack, right? Wait, wait, wait! Okay. -Hey. -Hey, handsome! -Wow, Joey, you look beautiful! -Thank you. -Audrey! How you doing? -Hi! I'm great! Good. Good. Eric, this is Joey. -Hey. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -And this is Audrey. -Hi. -Hi. -Jack was right. You're a stone fox. Thank you. You know, I guess you'll have to do. -Well, let's go, shall we? -Yeah. Yeah, let's go. -Can I help you yet? -Yeah, I'm Dawson Leery checking in for the film festival. Oh, my God. You're totally wicked cute. Way cuter than the picture. There's a picture? is this your girlfriend? Oh, cool! Your movie's awesome! Your screening sold out. You beat Oliver, you know. -He's the biggest thing around here. -l'm sorry. Who's Oliver? He's our local celebrity. I don't see what the big deal is, though. -Ask me, he looks kind of retarded. -He's, like, eccentric, Trevor. God! Okay, let me make this clear. It is more than an option... -...to go back home right now. -Oh, I don't think so. Granted, the people of this town are a little off but who can deny that we could both use the love? And what better way to spend an evening than as girlfriend to the biggest celebrity in town? -Gee, honey, you shouldn't have. -Well.... -Wow, you guys really went all out! -Sigma Ep. Expect nothing less. Way to deliver, man! Score, big daddy, score! -What was that? -Nothing. The guys just being idiots. -Take your coats, ladies? -Okay. Jen should be sharing this pain. I should call her. No can do, she's gone for the weekend with Dawson. That was great, thanks. Just the check, please. So? -What? -Oh, come on. Was this good or was this good? Give me a little of credit. -l saw your face when we came in. -l did not have a face! You had a face. But let's get back to giving me credit, shall we? You may also have noticed that I have kept us in crowded places because I wouldn't want you tempted to jump me on our non-date evening. Well, I mean, you are wearing that really sexy outfit. Damn! Who would have thought you cleaned up so good? And you're right. A lesser guy would have not afforded my self-control such a generous security blanket. You saved me from myself. Well, it hasn't been easy, let me tell you. I know you don't like hearing this, Karen but you deserve better than being an illicit affair. A woman who is as giving and as beautiful as yourself deserves someone who's gonna be there loving you back just as hard. -Okay, that was good. -Yeah, that was really good. Which just kind of puts the final nail in the coffin. -What nail? What coffin? -How did I get top prize? Either my dad donated a wing to the Hooksett library or these people have no idea what's good and what's bad. -Okay, you- - This has gotta stop. -What's gotta stop? This. The people of this town are perfectly nice. And you blaming them for bad taste is obviously just a way to undermine your own artistic abilities. You have a tremendous talent so would you please stop putting yourself down? Or I'll have to break up with you. You can't break up with me. You'll never break up with me. The physical attraction is far too strong. You got me there, tiger. -Hey, Leery! -Hey. Your movie better be good. This festival consistently gives first prize to a film with a fresh voice and unique vision. I've won it three years in a row. And I just don't like the idea of being usurped by a Hollywood slickster, you know? It's just not cool. Hi. You're really pretty. Who's gonna argue? -No after-dinner cigarette? -No cigarette. I only smoke when I'm nervous or severely annoyed. So then not nervous or severely annoyed. I guess I should take that as a good sign. In fact, I don't think I saw you yell or complain all night long. It's amazing what being out of Civilization does for a girl. If I didn't know you better, I would say that you positively light up. Now, don't go ruin the moment with unnecessary compliments. And why not? Enough of the cynicism. I say that we ruin this night silly with unnecessary flattery. Karen Torres, you are a beautiful young woman with fantastic taste in clothing. And although your jokes do tend to bomb you make up for it with that sparkling smile of yours. Okay, now it's your turn. I had a great time tonight, Pacey. -Yeah, I'll take that. -Thank you. You know, just seeing you have a good time is thanks enough. Anyway.... Good night, Karen. The first time I saw this film I knew I was in the hands of a talented filmmaker. But I was equally moved by a letter which accompanied the film's submission. It was a letter from the filmmaker's father telling me that I absolutely could not ignore his son's work. Honestly, I was predisposed to hate the film because, well it didn't show up until three days past the deadline. But I'm a father myself and I know a thing or two about parental pride. So I grudgingly put the video in the VCR and after five minutes, I knew Mitch Leery was right. I absolutely could not ignore his son's work. So, ladies and gentlemen I give you the filmmaker behind this year's top prize film: Dawson Leery. I don't know what to say. My dad loved movies. He loved them in the truest sense in that he had no interest in making them, he just.... He loved watching them. He started taking me to movies at a very early age and I loved it. He would take me to movies and then.... And then talk to me about them. I need to know how you learned that I am the one the Lord Chamberlain hired to dispose of the witness. I don't betray friends to murderers like you. That's what I was hoping you would say. STORM: Why do you Starjammers treat me as an enemy? Did we not fight side-by-side against the tyrant D'Ken? True. Though we have maintained communications silence, Corsair's open communicator allowed us to hear everything. Including Cyclops-son betraying Corsair-father to evil Commander! X-Men the ones who act like enemy, not Starjammers! JANDRA: I am glad you are back. But why is the lady tied up? Her friend betrayed our location to the false Shi'ar officer. On the other hand, from the lies Cyclops was told, it is no more than we expected. (BUZZING) (BUZZING STOPS) Is it true you are Corsair's son? Not by choice! Watch and learn. What are you going to see is the ship's log for three days in the future. But that's impossible. 1821 hours. Encountered magnetic storm of force 10 intensity. Life support temporarily failed. Six crew injured. The witness, Jandra, lost. This faked sequence was programed in advance to cover up what was really going to be a murder! Exactly. I went to your father for help, because he was the one man I knew with the guts to rescue Jandra and see that justice was done. Until I ruined it. My mistake could cost all of you your lives. We'll see. For now, just try to have a little faith in your father. - I gave orders that I wasn't to be... - Disturbed? That's the Scott Summers I gave my last parachute to! Took you long enough! Plan the family picnic later. Let's go! Follow me! CH'OD: Corsair, sorry to break communications silence, but I strongly suggest you alter your course 13 degrees to the north. Fools! We have them now. CH'OD: And remember Aldebaran 5. I remember it well. S TORM: Professor Xavier sends his regards. Xavier is half-a-planet away, and Aldebaran is in another galaxy. What are they up to? (CHEERING) I don't know what happened on Aldebaran 5, but it better have been good. It was. (CORSAIR MOANS IN PAIN) Now! Fire! (LAUGHING) You'll have to forgive Ch'od. He gets carried away. That's okay, Dad. I think I understand how he's feeling. Get up here, everyone! We have a trial to get to! And a renegade cop to turn over to Shi'ar justice. CORSAIR: What made you change your mind? Let's just say I like long odds. Seems to run in the family. Our talk got interrupted. There's so much I want to know. We'll get to it. All of it. I've got a question or two myself. - Then stay! - What? I don't mean forever. Just a few hours. You're not telling me your hot spacecraft can't make up a few hours flying across a whole galaxy! Well, I... I guess we could spend a little extra time in hyperdrive. No. Break out the cards! Better save your fuel. Looks like we're going to be here a while. So, you're gonna marry that redhead that beat the pants off of the Imperial Guard. C YCLOPS: She's calmed down a bit since then. - Reminds me a lot of your mother. - C YCLOPS: How? CORSAIR: Maybe I should wait to tell you till after you're married. NARRATOR: Previously on X-Men... SHAW: You X-Men were allowed to enter, so that I could have the pleasure of introducing you to the Inner Circle's newest member. WYNGARDE: To our new queen! - Our new queen! - ALL: Our new queen! Jean! We can't deceive and control the Phoenix forever. Some day she'll discover the truth, and turn against the Inner Circle. PHOENIX: Your pathetic attempt to use me has opened my eyes! No! Please! You had me do evil to gain you power. But through this body, I felt the thrill of that evil. Now I thirst for more! Jean, it's you. Talk to me! Help me! PHOENIX: For this new sensation, the rapture of destruction, for the pleasure of the Phoenix! The unbound joy of evil! The mortal Jean Grey is no more. I am fire made flesh! Power incarnate! I am the Dark Phoenix! - Do not do it. - Oh, dear. (SHRIEKING) You wish me to return to the cold nothingness of space? You wish me to give up the body? Never! There is a power beyond good and evil, the power to create and the power to destroy. Jean, can you hear me? Jean Grey can hear nothing. Speak only to the Phoenix. Jean, fight it! Use the powers of your mind. Remember what we mean to each other. Jean, please, don't leave me. Scott? Scott, help me. Enough! You are of no use to me. (ALL SCREAMING) WOLVERINE: Ducks. I hate ducks. Gambit can't help but notice you save him, chere, and not Wolverine. Must be my way with women. Don't flatter yourself, swamp-boy. (GAMBIT GRUNTS) Little piece of advice, Cajun. Never make that woman mad at you. Speaking of mood swings, what's bugging the Phoenix? She used to be on our side. I fear Xavier's intuition has proved prescient. Through Jean's keen human senses, the Phoenix has experienced exhilarating new sensations and emotions. - I doubt she wants to give them up. - Why not ask her? WOLVERINE: Better ask her real nice. Your destiny is at its end, X-Men. The Dark Phoenix has come to destroy you all! Defend yourselves. But remember, Jean is up there with her. - Be careful. - I call upon the power of the hurricane! (ALL GRUNTING) Hang on, sugar. (PHOENIX LAUGHING) Do you really think your puny powers mean anything to me? Forgive me, Jean. This is too easy. You provide me only annoyance, frustration. The power of lightning! Why does the body excite when I must struggle to get at them? (STORM SCREAMS) Get away from her, you witch! What in the world? Uh-oh! (WOLVERINE GRUNTS) Why does the sensation lessen when the opponent is weak? Cyclops, now! - No! - ROGUE: Beast! Fools! Do you think I need eyes to see, ears to hear? Shouldn't have done that, gal. Let's see how cocky you are once I've drained off some of your power. Stop it! (ROGUE SCREAMS) Is this all you can do against me? This is too easy. Give her back! Why do you care about this body? I love her. Love? I do not understand. Your answer is unacceptable. (GRUNTS) Scott? What have I done? I love you, Scott. No matter what the future holds, I will always love you. Never forget. (ALL GROANING) Jeannie. Life readings, Eluke? As if I didn't already know. Nothing, Captain. The D'Bari star system is as devoid of life as the others. It seems such a waste. An entire universe out there, waiting to be discovered, and we're asked to map dead star systems. Who knows? Maybe one day we shall find something. (SCANNER BEEPING) What is it? What's happening? I don't know. (ALARM BLARING) Eluke! What was that? A comet? No. It is alive! It just plunged into the sun. Surely it cannot have survived. According to my readings, Captain, the creature is still alive. - Not only alive, but feeding! - Feeding? On a star? Engine room! Full forward, now! All engines stop! Why are we stopping? Get us out of here! No. That thing, whatever it is, just destroyed an entire star system. If those planets had been inhabited, billions of innocent beings would have been wiped out. We must destroy that creature before it feeds again. - Eluke, where is the creature now? - Gone. - Just gone! - Connect me with the Empress. LILANDRA: No, do not pursue, return to me now. - Gladiator. - Yes, my Empress! Assemble the Imperial Guard immediately and make ready the Imperial Star Cruiser! - What has happened, my Empress? - Our worst nightmare. I'm afraid Jean Grey no longer exists. When she first inhabited Jean's body, we were thankful. Jean helped her protect us from the M'Kraan Crystal. But now Jean has been overwhelmed by the alien force within her. As long as Jean is alive, we can't stop trying. Of course, Scott, but we must also be honest with ourselves about the depth of the problem. Unless the Phoenix agrees to leave Jean's body, I see no way to save our friend. (GROANS IN PAIN) Professor, she's coming back. She's coming back. How do you know the Phoenix is returning? Jean is returning. Our psychic rapport is still functioning. We will do everything in our power to protect Jean. But at the same time we must do all we can to defeat the Phoenix within her or our world will not survive. How do you beat something that can melt you in a split second? - That's it! - What's it? - Why hasn't the Phoenix melted us? - How should I know? Because Jean has at least some control over the creature. That means there's still hope of reaching her. Ah, yes, its mind. The Inner Circle controlled the Phoenix-Jean entity, at least for a time, by attacking its most vulnerable spot. But, Beast, it's Jean's mind! I do not propose to harm her mind, only disable it. A mnemonic scrambling device would temporarily prevent her from forming coherent thought. That could cause the creature to leave her! My thoughts, exactly. How could I have not seen it? All those weeks we worked to make Jean whole again, simply made her the perfect host. Phoenix, why do you still inhabit Jean's body? Your work is done. You do her harm by remaining! (PHOENIX LAUGHING MANIACALLY) One mnemonic scrambler, made-to-order. Now, to find a suitable test subject. Volunteers? (GROANS IN PAIN) - What is it? - It's Jean. - I feel her presence. - Where? Here? No, somewhere near. A place from her past. A place full of emotional memories. Mom, Dad, I'm home. Mom? Dad? Mom? Are you here? Prometheus! (HISSING) Prometheus, it's me. Jean. (SQUEAKING) Daddy? Daddy's home! Daddy? Is that you? Daddy? Where are you going? Daddy? Forgive me, chere, this is the only way. Fools! ROGUE: Why ain't that brain buster working? Patience, Rogue. It should take effect momentarily. Jean, my friend! Do not reject our help. - Let your mind... - I have no friends! What is this, "catch the X-Men" day? Her mind is more powerful than anything I could imagine. She has overloaded the scrambler's circuitry. We knew it could come to this. - We got to end it. - Logan? - Jean? - Do it. Quickly, while I still have control. Stop her now! I can't! Please, if you truly love me, don't let her... You should have destroyed me when you had the chance. What a pity, Beast. I've ruined your little toy. Now we'll play on my terms! C YCLOPS: Let them go. Jean. Jean Grey no longer exists! I know you're there, Jean. I can still feel you. You cannot destroy your friends. Don't be so sure! I love you, Jean. We all love you. And you love us. You love me. Nothing will ever change that. Scott? Scott, I... (JEAN SCREAMS) C YCLOPS: Jean! I'm sorry, Scott. But I had to attack her mind while she was distracted. As long as I've got her back, safe and... I only stunned her. The creature inside her must be destroyed now. Quickly. - No. - Now. Before she... Recovers? You're too late. And as for you, (XAVIER SCREAMS) You once told Jean Grey that the greatest joy a teacher has is to be surpassed by his own pupil. - Enjoy! - JEAN: Stop! I won't allow you to enter my... (JEAN SCREAMING) In the battlefield of the mind, my will shall prevail! Do you really think your puny mind is a match for mine? As you once used the power of the Phoenix to bind the M'Kraan Crystal, I now bind the Phoenix with the power of... (XAVIER SCREAMING) The conceit of you humans, the arrogance! Jean. If you can hear me, help me. Help me. Help me. This can't be. I am Phoenix! I now bind the Phoenix - with the power of my mind! - No! No! (XAVIER GROANS) (JEAN GROANS) - Professor! - C YCLOPS: Jean! - Professor, will she be all right? - Jeannie. The Phoenix is contained, for now. I could never have defeated the Phoenix if Jean herself had not helped me. The strength of her mind is truly awesome. - Hi, four-eyes. - Hi yourself, tiger. ROGUE: We got company. C YCLOPS: The Shi'ar. Greetings, Charles. Lilandra! What is the matter? Why didn't you alert me telepathically? Charles Xavier, it is the decision of the High Council of the Shi'ar Empire that the being known both as the Phoenix and as Jean Grey, must be destroyed! Lilandra, stop this! For the sake of all that live, Jean Grey must perish. Let's go. I never realized these underground passages were here. Yeah. Hey is it true... Is it true there's treasure here? I heard it from the former warden, so it has to be true. There's a spectacular treasure hidden here. Hey, is this it? Definitely. Do it. Yeah. What the... It's human! L-It can't be! What's going on? T-There's no treasure? It's still alive! What the hell are you? Who am I? Who in the world am I? K-Kill me... Please, kill me! Even if you are a criminal, we must respect your life. What are you? What the hell are you, anyway? My name is Michael... The one who keeps law and order. From this border on, this is Jesus Town. Please, present entrance permission visa. I repeat. Please, present entrance permission visa. Hey, stop! Come back here! It's tonight. Wait at the rendezvous point. Let's go. An unknown intruder has broken through the main gate. An unknown intruder has broken through the main gate. Hey, time to move. Go! Go! Warning. Do not move. You are now under our jurisdiction. Repeat. Warning. Do not move. If you do not obey... Can you hear it? The sound of the people's joy. Today we celebrate the third anniversary of Jesus Town. People call Jesus Town a place of miracles. Here there is love and peace above what has ever been achieved before. There is still poverty and confusion everywhere beyond this place. We are actually living in a modern Eden. Is anything wrong? I am moved. Look... This orchid was dying until yesterday, but today it is fully blooming. Even a tiny flower like this has a life. Reporting, Sir. Someone has broken the border gate and invaded Jesus Town. I have no choice. Call in the heavy soldiers. I want to protect everyone in Jesus Town. That includes the smallest life. You are justice and I am the servant of justice. That dream again. Hey, Kaoru! You okay? Kaoru! Hey! Let's go! What are you doing? What are you doing? Let's go! Get ready! Hurry! Hurry! Come on! All right, run! H-Help! Hurry! That way! This way! Not good. Parliament's heavy soldiers! What are we going to do, Kaoru? Run! Run! What is that? That's... Y-You bastard, do you have any idea what you're doing? Do you have any idea? Do you understand? P-Please, spare me! I was just following orders! If you don't have a will of your own, there is no reason for you to live. Transmitting images of intruder. T-That's Hakaider. Hurry! Die! Kaoru! Master Michael! Why didn't you die? If you truly deserve to be one of my men you would have fought and died. You shouldn't move yet. Relax, we're all friends trying to rebel against the government. This hideout isn't going to be found easily. Want some food? A robot doesn't need any food. Whoever heard of a robot that eats bread or soup? Hey, don't tell me it's love at first sight! You sleazy robot. Say, would you do us a favor? We need your help. Our country is controlled by Parliament right now. We have to destroy it! He's a weird robot. Maybe a nutcase. However you look at it, it's not human. We can't let it stay here. Yeah! I ain't trusting no robot. What if he breaks down and goes out of control? Shut up! I know. Hey, you came to save this country, didn't you? Then fight with us! We have to get Gurjev of Parliament! He talks of sweet things like love and peace, but what he's really doing is... Please, help! Please, stop! Get moving. Quit messing around! Anyone who shows the possibility of disobeying Gurjev will be caught. Stop, please! Kill me! No! No! No! And they insert a chip into the brain to erase all human emotions. Tears, laughter, and anger... To Gurjev, emotions only get in the way. Look. Now he will be reborn. In this country, no crime is allowed to occur. Any criminal... Any disobedient civilian will be given a new life by me. Beautiful. Just like children. I am their father. I must protect them with my own hands. From any threat. Such as Hakaider. Do you know that thing? The true identity of that robot? I had him made. Before your birth, we needed a lethal robot to protect the order of this country. However, the Hakaider Operation failed. We could not control him. And just before he was to be destroyed some scientists stole Hakaider and disappeared. He is sort of a ghost. He doesn't really exist. Hakaider only kills. Only destroys. He will bring chaos to my order! We must eliminate Hakaider, no matter what! Please, leave it to me. I am superior. Even to Hakaider. What Gurjev means by order is to take everybody's freedom away! If you resist him, he'll rearrange the inside of your head! He'll take your soul away. Peace in this country is fictitious. Everybody's always under surveillance and lives in fear. Look for this man, Hakaider. He's a dangerous individual and a threat to our peaceful country. Search for Hakaider! Please, fight with us to destroy Parliament. ...to save this country. That's right! If we destroy Parliament, we'll be the new leaders! Then we'll control everything! Let's live large! Don't get the wrong idea! These are precious funds! It's not your allowance! Don't be so square. We just wanna have some fun sometimes. Right? Idiot! You're slacking off too much. I have a dream of starting a ranch someday. So I'd better start saving. A ranch? You guys... Calm down. Being uptight is one of your weaknesses. Everyone has dreams. Don't you, Kaoru? You're not gonna to say, "to be an ordinary bride," are you? Anyhow, after destroying Parliament, any dream can come true. Because we'll be the law then. You are the same! You bastard! What are you doing? You damned robot! Just like Parliament, you are all ugly. Bastard! Arnie! Kaoru... Hey! Kaoru... You assholes! You killed him... You killed him... Our only hope... You... The invading artificial being has been destroyed. You killed him... You killed him... Our only hope... You're the same! You don't fight. You just look the other way. You killed him... You... Go to hell! Hey... Would you do me a favor? There's someplace I'd like to go. It feels great! This is my secret hangout. You're the first one I've ever brought here. It's the only oasis in Jesus Town. It's a natural spring. You should try some. Remember that talk... That talk about dreams of the future... Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be an ordinary bride... Why are you staring at me? You wanna come on to me or something? Well, okay then. But you'd better be good at it. I may look easy, but the truth is I ain't... Hey, you came to save this country, didn't you? Then fight with us! Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be an ordinary bride... Hakaider has entered the area. The halls of Parliament and 95% of the soldiers have been destroyed. All surviving soldiers proceed to the central hall. Do you want to live? Do you live and have a will of your own? I never believed someone like you could exist. Whether you're human or robot, we must keep discipline to maintain our order. Nonsense. Order made by whom? I don't recall accepting such rules. I am justice. In the name of justice, I will terminate you! Indeed... If you are justice then I am evil. Look. Do you know why flowers are beautiful? Because they are obedient. People should be like flowers. You and I will grow flowers together. And we will make them bloom. I made you. Following me is your destiny. I can give you even more power. I will decide my own destiny. I am the destroyer and the judge. You are a two. Out of here, both of you. Come on, out. Let's go. Yes, thank you very much. Go on. Hey, Dr. Doolittle, get your butt in here pronto. A dog that called 911? Are you trying to get yourself fired? Traitor. Well, you listen to me, Fowler. Unless you have an eyewitness, one without a tail, I suggest you go back and analyze your data and let real detectives make the arrests. Is that clear? Keep that dog out of my squad room. You did that on purpose. Of course I did. Why? Well, I may be a dog, but that doesn't mean I can't smell a rat. I trust you, Fowler. But this is crazy. You're a dog that talks. This turns theories of evolution upside down. I just wanted them to hear you. I told you I could only speak to the man who seeks the truth. That was supposed to be you. Chin Li was like a father to me, and now they've killed him. He deserves justice. You're right. I'm sorry. What I did was wrong. I'm sorry. Cho Cho, please. Come on, show me some love. One last chance. Shake on it? Shake? Really? Okay. Look, can we continue this in the bathroom? The bathroom? Why? 'Cause I got to take a whiz. Duh. What? Never saw guys taking a leak before? Freaks. Okay. Look, we're partners now, okay? You're not gonna kiss me, are you? I don't know you well enough. Look, just promise me one thing, all right? If we solve this case, you have to let the rest of the world know that you can talk. If we solve this case, I'll sing a love song to a cat in front of the whole squad. All right, we should start our investigation where Chin Li worked... the dog track, Cage's Kennel Club. Uh, uh, I'll make the decisions here. Detective. Is the dog from the crime scene? Yeah, he sort of followed me home. Guess I adopted him. Well, that was very sweet of you. Yeah. So, uh, anyway, I came to apologize. Apologize? Yeah. Most detectives make up their mind before they ever get to the crime scene, but you refused to take the easy way out. I should've backed you up, but I didn't. Oh, pshh, come on, no, no, no. That's, you know... I understand how it is. It's just how things work at the department. Yeah, well, either way, you're the kind of cop I want to be when I make detective. Yeah, well, it'll happen. Mm-mm-mm. I don't know. I'm really good on the streets, but I, uh, I choked on the written exam. Well, maybe, uh, next time, you know, you're studying for the written exam, maybe, I don't know, I could, I don't know, I could help you study, help... Ashley, we got a call. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. I got to go. We'll talk later? Yeah. Are you kidding me? That was your best shot? You didn't even get her phone number. So, uh, what, we going home? Nope, we're going to the races. Oh, that's great. What? Dog asks you to get on the case and nothing. But some tootsie bats her eyelashes and zippedy-doo-dah, you're Dirty Harry. Zip it, Fido. You know, females put out a signal when they're interested. I could smell some major flirtage going on there. Oh, so now you're an expert on romance, huh? This from a species who says, "Hello," by sniffing each other's butts. Oh, sorry, ladies. And now, a fast move by Southern Beauty. Southern Beauty on the outside. If I was a betting man, I'd say Southern Beauty by eight lengths. You've been right all day long, Daddy. Southern Beauty... You did it again. That little puppy's got some... a fire in her. Southern Beauty won again. That's four in a row, Dad. What a surprise, Eddie. Yes, a surprise, Eddie. There's a detective in the kennel... about Chin Li. Uh-huh. Well, bring him up, son. What's wrong with her? And they're off. These muscle-heads are an embarrassment to our race. Well, aren't you being a little catty? Pardon the expression. These dogs are athletes. Chasing an idiotic, mechanical rabbit? They're nothing but puppets of the man. Aw, don't be jealous. I'm sure you could keep up if you dropped a few pounds. Mr. Flower? I'm Detective Fowler. Are you looking for Mr. Cage? Yes. I'm Mr. Cage. You're Mr. Cage? I'm Edward Cage, managing director here at the Cage Kennel Club. If you're looking for my father, he's upstairs watching the races. Okay. Your dog will have to stay here, of course. You stay here, Cho Cho, and be a good doggy. And if you do, you get a little doggy treat. Good boy. Hey, I got a doggy treat for you. Good afternoon, son. Afternoon. I'm Hamilton Cage, and you are? Detective Fowler. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Cage. Uh-uh-uh. Rule you call me Hamilton. Edward you met. My son, my dear son and heir. Want a drink? Oh, no, I'm on duty, thanks. Get him a drink. And this is my little princess. My daughter Margret. President of Research and Development for my largest division, Biotech. And I suppose I should tell you a little tiny something about myself. Son, I was a... Orphaned as a baby. That's right. Educated in the Far East... A PhD in chemistry by the age of 20. You started Biotech Pharmaceuticals which you built into a world leader. Continue. Five years ago, you started Cage Sports Enterprises which includes a pro football team, CSE Sports Channel, and the Cage Kennel Club. Glory Hallelujah, I do so love a man who does his homework. You must be one heck of a detective, son. Aw, shucks. No, just more of an internet geek. Internet geek. That's a good one. Hey, what's with you? Calm down. Hey, over here, big boy. Well, howdy. Hey, that Southern Beauty's a wild one, isn't she? She didn't use to be. But you look like a dog who appreciates a woman with a little spunk. Oh, I do. Uh, tell me, uh... Mary Beth. Mary Beth. I'd like to know everything I can about this track. My mama told me to be careful around dogs who ask too many questions. You always listen to your mama? Practically never. Is there some problem, Detective? No, no, it's just, um, you seem like you're in remarkable shape for man of your... Age? I know you're trying to be diplomatic. But as you can see, good health is not just a business with me. It's a passion. That and the track. Oh, different kind of passion. And most of the credit for the track must go to my dear son Edward, my son and heir. Mmm-hmm. Well, so, if Edward was in charge of the track, he must have been the last one to see Chin Li alive, right? Ohh. What about that, Edward? Chin Li was working the morning shift feeding the dogs, but he was gone by noon. Chin Li was so much more than my friend. He taught me about trust, loyalty, generosity, action, focus. Everything I am today I owe directly to him. Sorry for your loss. Cho Cho. Has anyone thought about Cho Cho? Chin Li had a dog that was very important to him. Do you know where he is? It's funny you should ask. Cho Cho! I got to go. Can we continue this another time? Cho Cho! I've got a flea bath booked at six. Well, then, I'll see you later. Oh, yes. This mongrel was just a pup last time I saw it. We were closest to him in all the world, you and I. I know you miss him every much. Very decent of you to take Cho Cho in, Detective. It was before I found out he never stops talking. Barking. Never stops barking. Cho Cho, sit. My entire organization is at your disposal. I want Chi Li's attackers brought to justice. I'll do my best. Oh, do better than that. Get it done. Margret will show you out. We're counting on you. I did a little leg work, partner, What? Sweet little greyhound back there said they introduced a new feed to Southern Beauty and some of the other dogs. Huh. What are you doing? The magnetic strip on the ID cards carry a unique code for each employee, so I'm using COLAR to access the Cage Kennel Club Employee Database. And? Well, Chin Li did leave the kennel area gate by noon, but there's an entry and exit coming from the Biotech building at 8:55 p.m. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Feline fury coming on. What? Cat. What? I hate cats. Lazy, worthless layabouts, the whole lot of them. Look at that. You know, cats are behind the plagues of the Middle Ages; you know that, don't you? Are you insane? And I got my suspicions about World War II. And... and... and you... you think Oswald acted alone, huh? Well, I'm sorry. I just got some issues with the C-word I guess, that's all. I'm sorry. Look at that. It's Chin Li's killer. How do you know that's him? Don't you see the bandages on his left wrist? That's where I bit him. Give me those keys. * I got you running in circles. He's getting away. Officer in pursuit! Officer? Hey! You're not an officer, I am. Doesn't this come with power steering? Are you crazy? You can't drive! Oh, yeah? What do you call this... surfing? Stop the car! Code 12. Red team, go. Red team, go. Cho Cho! Stop! Who put that sign there? Stay on the road. * But you didn't count on this top dog coming around. * Hit the brakes; hit the brakes! I am hitting the brake. It won't stop. The accelerator's stuck. Bail out, bail out! Man overboard. Oh, God! Uh! Ahhh! No! I loved that car. This is not good. Oh, a little bodywork, a paint job, it'll be like new. I heard. How you doing? I'm doing good. It's a good day so far. You know, minus the teeny, tiny annoyance of no car, suspension, no future. It's a good day. Good times. Even when you're upset, you're still funny. I don't feel very funny. Well, you make me laugh. That must count for something. Units 5-10 and 6-14, please respond... Hey, what? Ask her. Ask her what? Never mind, I'll do it. Say, uh, why don't you meet me for dinner at the Amazon Cafe at 8:00? Amazon Cafe? It's a date. Why did you do that? Jeez, I don't know what other signals she can give you but jumping in your lap. Besides, I got a good plan. You'll do fine. I won't do fine. You said it yourself: I'm not a people guy. This date's going to go five minutes, then I'll say something stupid, and she's going to walk out. Don't worry about it, partner. I got a plan for that too. * You wanted to see me? I want you to stop what you're doing. Ha! Thought I was helping. The goal of this company is not to fix greyhound races, but to realize the potential for greatness that lies within us all. Ha! Have I made myself clear? Perfectly. Hii-yah! There's a meeting tomorrow in the new wing with Margret and the science team. I expect you to be there as well. I expect you to be there as well. It's all about the power within. Don't race the dogs too much. Don't drug them, whatever you do. Don't make any money. Hii-yah! * Okay, just relax. Just listen to me; repeat what I say. I know everything there is to know about girls. Enjoy your meal. Thanks. You okay? Your neck? Me? Oh, yeah, my neck's a little sore. I'm fine. Oh, good. Wow. You look really... What? Beautiful. Stunning. The smell of your skin takes my breath away. This doesn't sound like you, Peter. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's nice and all. But why the change? Right. What a good question. What a good question. Nothing like a good question. What am I, Plato? Uh, let's see now. Maybe you can try, "Life is full of change. Uh, but in this case, I must admit..." Oh, I'd love to lick your face and sniff your tail. No, you can't use that. You can't use that. Let's see, "In this case, I must admit..." In this case, I must admit... And this may sound bold... This may sound bold... You made me change. You made me change. My heart feels so close to yours. I just want to howl at the moon. I'm not sure if this new you is seducing me or scaring me. Well, I'm a man of more secrets... Than you could possibly imagine. Really? Name one. Name one? Yeah. Secret... what, you want to know what my big secret is? Well, I'll tell you. God, I hate cats. God, I hate cats. What's wrong with cats? Cats are lazy, unmotivated slobs, black holes of selfishness sucking dry the kind hearts of their masters. They're useless. Did you ever hear of a seeing eye cat? Or a watch cat? No. Wow. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Had a little cat rage there. I... it... j-j-just... just just overtakes me. Let me try to get it together. Uh, um, uh, try this: Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about Ashley Wilkenson, her hopes, her dreams... Her fantasies. Well... I want to tell you what's on my mind and in my heart. I'm listening, Detective. Since the first moment I saw you, there's something I've wanted to say to you. And I feel if I don't say it now, that opportunity could pass me by. That's good. Whoo! Wahoo. What is that? Look at the chassis on that lassie. What? What do you want to say? Woof, woof, woof, woof woof. Come on... What is an incredible dog like you doing in a joint like this? No... what? Ashley, I... Excuse me? I don't... I didn't mean... I didn't mean that at all. I mean, you're incredible, but you're not a dog. Ashley. Ashley. Please. Thanks a lot, Cyrano de Bonehead. Good night, miss. Ashley! Ashley, no, wait! Gah! Now what am I supposed to do? How do I know? I'm just a dog. If it was me, I'd chase the car. Ashley, wait! Okay, no more games. I'm just going to bark this out, okay? I love how strong you are. I love how sexy you look in uniform. I love the way you just say what's in your heart. And if only I could just find the strength to say what's in mine. Well, I don't know who was feeding you those corny lines earlier, but I like your own words much better. Yeah, me too. Let's go talk. Want to? You know, I'm not your typical guy. I'm not into sports, going to bars, you know. I don't really get out much either. You know, I'm not your typical dog. I'm not into chasing cars or playing fetch. I'm actually... not the party type. I never go to parties. Never have parties. Ooh, this smells... Oh, excuse me. Ladies first. I don't do hydrants. Whoa! Uh! You want to come back to my place? You know, maybe later? Oh. Uh! I'm sorry. It's okay, babe. Love hurts. * This is a nice neighborhood. Oh, yeah. It's, uh, it's an old boatyard. Got it for cheap, fixed it up, you know? You'll see. Is there a party? No, um, I just left my TV on. So. Um. I... I got to go. So there was a party. No, no, it's my cousins. They're in town. Yeah, okay. Bye. Ashley, wait. Come on, keep up. Rah! Rah! * Hey, I just saw Mrs. Rottweiler. She said the puppies have been up crying all night. Puppies? You dog! Coming through. Excusez-moi. Ay caramba. I'm so high. Hey, Bernie. Hey, we playing poker or what? Oh, I should have seen that one coming. All right, enough! That's it! I want all you four-legged, tail-wagging, Frisbee-catching, flea-scratching mongrels out of my house now. You... out. Out of here! You, beat it. Man, this ain't cool. Don't you give me that look. Ooh, yeah. Down! I'm gonna poo on his lawn. You thought this was a party? No, it was a conference on world peace. Fowler, I was undercover. Undercover? I was questioning the dogs on the street about what goes on at the Cage Kennel Club. Right. Not mine. As a matter of fact, the Dane's cousin dated one of the slower greyhounds there. Okay, right now isn't a good time to talk about dogs and their love life. It's not important. But this is. After a few months on that new dog food, that slower greyhound turned out to be Southern Beauty, winner of her last five starts. And guess what. Edward Cage always supervised feeding time. Really? COLAR. Yes, Peter? The last six greyhounds to win at over 20 to 1, how many of them are owned by Cage Sports Enterprises? Searching that data for you now. Four of them, sweetie buns, including Iron Thunder and Southern Beauty. Sweetie buns? This ain't no ordinary dog food. What if it's illegal or, worse, dangerous to the dogs? Well, if Edward is feeding the dogs some type of chemical energy formula and then betting on them, well, that's enough for an indictment on felony racketeering, and could possibly tie him to the attack on Chin Li. So we need what Chin Li was after, proof of the formula. And the last place Chin Li was before the attack was Biotech. The formula has to be in their mainframe computer. Bingo. Not you. I know you're not Bingo. Access denied. Access denied? Okay, we've got to break in there, but we've got to be really smart about it. All right, Fowler. What do you think of my disguise? Hey, give me that. Ow. Ew, doggy drool. Ow. What is this, bumper cars? Why don't you try going around the walls instead of through them? Should be a door marked "Fire Control" around here. There it is. You should be in here, and I should be driving. Did you hear me? Shut up. We're undercover. Shut up, we're undercover. I am, anyway. Easy, easy. I'm slipping; come up. If I want to be neutered, I'll go to a vet. Get in there. Come on. Hey, watch your hands, Romeo. Look out. Oh, God. I bet Lassie didn't have to go through this. Ow. Get in. Come on, push, push. Ow! This harness is going to ruin my love life. I'll tell you something: Tom Cruise had this figured out better. And I'm not getting $20 million, either. Good job, boy. All right, this is the place. What's happening? Whoa, big... b-b-big drop. Big drop. Hang on to that rope. Oh, easy. E-e-easy. Whoa! Wait a minute. I got to go back up and get my stomach. T-t-take it easy now. Uh! Slow. Take it slow. Whoa. Rope, don't fail me now. Hold it; hold it. Not too close... Don't let me hit the floor, I'll set off the alarm. Hold... hold... stop. Good. All right, now swing me back and forth. Fowler, I'm just hanging here. You're late. Everybody's already here. We have to stop the animal testing. Why? Stage four isn't complete. Well, why do you think? Father. You've seen the way he's been acting. She's so changed. Uh, yeah. There's no telling what he'll do next. He's out of control. Almost there. Back and forth, not in circles. Man, I'm gonna hurl. Straighten me out. Fowler, turn me around. I can't put the disk in with my butt. It's not my fault. Okay, okay, that's better. That's better. Uhh! Easy, easy. Here we go. Download in progress. All right. Three more minutes to download, and we're out of here. Downloading complete in 2 minutes, 48 seconds. Wait, somebody's coming. Get me up, up, up, up. Up! Up! Pull. Now it looks quite wonderful. A lab? Why wasn't I told about this? When did you have this done? As soon as I realized the awesome power of Lot 99. But I had to shroud it in deepest secrecy... Yes, even from my beloved children. Today I brought you all here to inform you that stage five testing is now complete. Stage five? Human testing. We haven't started that yet. Yes, we have. I'm proud to announce that I, myself, have been taking Lot 99 for the past, uh, six months. Ladies and gentleman, six months ago... A 76-year-old man. Or hadn't you noticed the change? Did you think this happened because I did a few extra sit-ups every day? Oh, no. Hamilton. That's unbelievable. Strength, vitality, eternal youth. Adults will never know sickness. Children will never be orphaned. We're close, people. Very close. My vital signs are equally impressive. It's him. Wolfgang, the guy I bit. What's happening? Keep up the good work. Yes, sir. Aw, come on, Cho Cho. You should be excited. We did it. Got the evidence to put them away right here. Excited? Cage and I were both students of Chin Li's. He was like a father to us. He let you down. He let everybody down. He betrayed the animals, and worst of all, he betrayed Chin Li. Maybe not. You know, maybe he was just trying to improve the herbs like he said, for mankind. How? By doping the dogs so he could make millions rigging races? That could've been Edward. It's not Edward. He's not smart enough. Besides, Cage's goon had a bandage on his left wrist exactly where I bit Chin Li's killer. We both know Wolfgang is Cage's muscle guy. One way or another, Cage is letting it happen. Easy, girl. And in Gate 4, Distant Thunder, winner of her last three starts. In Gate 5, Misery Loves Company. She's been off her feed in recent weeks, but still a viable threat. In Gate 6, Do-Si-Do. "Dominance" is her middle name. Dad, it's important. How important can it be, son? Trouble. Someone broke into the mainframe and... Speak into the microphone. Somebody broke into the mainframe and downloaded Lot 99. Oh. Oh. We found dog hairs on the computer. Cho Cho and Fowler. In Gate 7, the legendary Land's End. And finally, in Gate 8, a newcomer and certainly the underdog... me. Here. Hold it. Come on, puppies. Keep up. Boys, you ain't gonna believe this one. I got it this time. I got it. I cracked the case. Okay, Cage Sports Enterprises have been giving the greyhounds at Cage Kennel Club this type of performance enhancer, making millions of dollars on long-shot bets. Can you prove it? Yes, look. Right here. This is the formula for what they call Lot 99. What it does is, it enhances natural herbs to camouflage the added chemicals so they don't show up during tests. Now we think that Chin Li discovered it; tried to take a sample to the police. That's why they killed him. Bingo. Hi, hello, hi, hi. Thief or thieves of Lot 99, you have made a mistake big-time. Fowler... Not only will this computer blow, What the hell's this? So I have to go. You have exactly, uh, uh, uh, four seconds. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. Ahh! Fowler, what is... You cracked the case, Fowler, huh? And all our computers with it. I could have you transferred to another planet. Yeah. Yeah, good idea. This is definitely not good. * Hello? Peter? Hey. It's cold outside. You guys a little down? Yeah, well, we have reason to be. So you're just going to give up? Look, it's over, okay? Not only did my evidence go up in smoke, but there's not a cop on the force who believes me. I believe you. You do? The only way we can prove this case is if we finish what Chin Li started. We've got to get a sample of Lot 99. We? Yeah, we. Are you sure about this? I mean, let's face it: my career has gone to the dogs. Woof No offense. But, Ashley, we screw this up, you could say good-bye to any chance of becoming detective. My dad was a detective, his dad was a detective. I've been so obsessed about making detective that I've forgotten why I became a cop in the first place. Which is? To stop bad guys from hurting people... and animals. Watch out for this Wolfgang... Cage's bodyguard. He has a bandage on his left arm where Cho Cho might have bit him. That could tie him to Chin Li's death. Okay, I'm going to the vent lab. Ashley, you watch out for security. Cho Cho, you know what to do. Cho Cho knows what to do. Cho Cho...? * * Do, do, do, do, doo doo. * * Brrrrm, do, doo doo. Hoo ha! Whoo! * Do, do, doo doo, do... * Hey, Grandma, what are you doing out here? Listen, my name's Cho Cho, and I'm a cop. I need to get a sample of the stuff they've been putting in the food of the younger dogs. Don't touch that stuff. It's poison. It's like magic at first. It makes you faster, stronger. Then it begins to take over your mind. It makes you crazy. You get angry and mean. And then you start to get weaker and weaker. You know how old I am? No, even a mutt like me knows enough not to ask questions like that. I'm two years old. What? That's no grandma. That's Southern Beauty. Southern Beauty? Oh, no. Ashley, come in, where are you? I got it. I got the Lot 99. Ashley, come in. Where are you? Ahh... Shhh! I got it. Wait here, okay? I got to go find Cho Cho. Okay. Excuse me. I have a... a call. Uh-huh? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Cho Cho, where are you? Over here. Cho Cho. I got a sample of Lot 99. Let's get out of here. Better handle it with care. What are you talking about? Southern Beauty just died from it. Hold it. Don't shoot! It's just us. Fowler? Yeah. Oh, no. Well, me and my dog. What's he doing here? What are you doing here? We got a call. Armed intruder on the premises. Who made the call? I did. Lieutenant, this is the second time that your detective has, uh, broken in. I don't know whether he's working for a competitor or just obsessive. Either way, he's dangerous. That... that's a lie. It's Lot 99 that's dangerous. That stuff will kill you, Cage. Just like it killed Southern Beauty. I'm sure your superiors would love to hear about the rogue officers in your command. As a matter of fact, I'm playing golf with Chief Clark tomorrow. No, don't listen to him. He's under the influence of Lot 99. Now, you listen to me, Fowler. Unless you want to be cuffed and gagged, I'd keep quiet. Now, Mr. Cage, what can we do to make this right? And avoid a costly lawsuit? Something dramatic, I hope. Fowler, your gun and your badge. My mom has my gun. You're pathetic. What's that? Grab him by the paws. I can't get ahold of him. Grab his ears, then. What are they doing? No, let him go. Hey, what are you doing? He didn't do anything. Get off me. Hey! Who's in charge here? Pull him down. Cho Cho. Watch those fangs. Cho Cho! Cho Cho. Let him go! Please! Cho Cho! There's still no word from Officer Wilkenson? Okay, please keep calling her, and let me know the minute you find her. Okay? Thank you. And in business news... Volume up. In about an hour, CEO Hamilton Cage will be announcing the launch of Energy L99, a safe and natural energy supplement. Cage plans to have the herbal blend added to everything from potato chips to children's breakfast cereals. No, no, you maniac, you can't give that stuff to kids. Oh, my God. Take a deep breath, Peter. Whew. Okay, focus. Ashley, Ashley... Where's Ashley? One thing at a time. Oh, I got to get some help here. Forget the facts, Peter. Go with your gut. Sometimes you have to search all over the yard before you find out where one bone is buried. There you go. Now you're on to something. COLAR, you still have the floor plan data that was downloaded when we breached the Cage Biotech mainframe? Oh, you want to hack into the security cameras at Cage Biotech. Looks like I programmed some dog sense into you. Go. Show time. Curtain up. Keep scanning. I'm scanning. Cage's office. Yep. Okay... move on. We're moving on. Right... fire control hallway... You're in it. Move on. Movin' on. Mainframe. Keep scanning. We're still scanning. Fire control room. Good. Ashley. Oh, God. Enhance. Peter, do you want me to call the cops? We just did. Ashley, don't worry. Don't worry, I'm coming for you. Let me think. Search the address of the Animal Control Center, and download it immediately into my palm computer. You got it, boss. * Baby. * We done as good as we could do. * * So what if I bit a mailman but misunderstood you. * * Ooh, baby. * Why knock yourself out? * * I got the blues, blues, blues, blues. * Meow Is it over? Great. Hopefully we've heard the last of that dog-rap garbage. Kitty, how about a permanent cat nap? Hush, puppy. Dead dog walking'. Remember me, mutt? Made me look like a fool in front of them cops. Payback time. Dead dog walking. What a dork. That's my dog, and I want him back. Oh, yeah? And why would I do that? Well, I'll tell you why. Hannibal, meet the dogcatcher. This is Hannibal. He doesn't like dogcatchers. Every dog has his day, you know? All right, now I'm going after Ashley. You and boys try to break up the press conference. Get a 911 call in if you can. Yeah, I got a bone to pick with Mr. Cage. Nice doggy. Nice doggy. Doggy want a bone? You're a scientist, not a criminal. You don't want any part of this. This stuff will kill your father. But you can still save him... and yourself. Think about it. Let her go. Ahh! Rahh! * Ha! That's a burn. It's not him. Ladies and gentleman, may I have your attention. I am Edward Cage. I appreciate your patience. My father is currently... tied up by unexpected developments. I am sorry for the delay. He should arrive any moment. Hope so. Ha! Ladies and gentleman, Hamilton Cage. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please be brief. Today is a day where we celebrate the triumph of a human life. When you add all-natural L99 to your, uh, uh, products, they will transform themselves into the sustenance of... life itself. For L99 is... pure power. Pure, uh, uh... Pure, uh... uh... power. Pure, uh, uh... youth. Ladies and gentleman, I give you the future. I give you L99! * I don't know, but I've been told... * * I don't know, but I've been told... * * Kennel food is mighty cold. * Kennel food is mighty cold. * Sound off. * 1-2-3-4. Wait, what's going on? Dogs! You're going down, buddy. Okay, Dad, we got to go. Come on, follow me. Come on, look at me. Come on. Say uncle. Say uncle. Come on, Dad, we got to go. That's a good boy. Right around the corner. Now! Behind you! Where... where are we? Whoo, hello. Watch it, buddy. She's underage. I'll be 18 next month. Hey, cowboy. You talkin' to me? Nice job out there. You looking for Hamilton Cage? Well, he went thataway. Which was is thataway? The elevator, Dick Tracy. Thanks. You're okay... for a cat. Hey, take care of yourself. And come back and see me sometime. Son, this is the roof. I've radioed the helicopter. They'll be here any minute. Are you out of your mind? Retreat in our moment of triumph? Never. Triumph? You're out of your mind. I'm out of my mind? Didn't I say you were out of your mind? I'm not out of my mind. You're out of your... Oof! Cage, you don't know what you're doing. You're hurting everybody. Turn yourself in. Now. Never. Daddy? You're sick, Cage. You have to be stopped, and I don't want to have to hurt you. Well, that's certainly going to make this fight a whole lot easier for me. * Hii-yah! Intriguing. Chin Li's two best students... face-to-face. So you want to play games? Okay. Not to be uh, outdone... Ha! Huh! Ooh, doggy. Ooh, doggy. Come on. Oof! You're some package, puppy. Very clever. Well, I'd give you about a six... out of ten. That's for all the times you made a dog go fetch. Ching! Fetch this. Whoooa. Hey. Yow. Let's get, uh, serious, shall we? Oh, no. That scar. It was you I bit. It was you. Don't be so surprised. Huh! Ha! Ouch! Chin Li was like a father to you. Well, he wasn't my father. My father died and left me alone. And then I searched for that fountain of youth, so that no child would ever orphaned again. Chin Li tried to spoil that. Come on, fight like a man. Look at what you've become, Cage... a monster. A monster? If only you could feel it... the power of Lot 99 coursing through your veins like liquid gold. Hoo-ha! Want a piece of me, dog? I want justice. Well, come and get it. Huh! Hii-yah. * I'm top of the world, Daddy. Please, for Chin Li, surrender. Never. Waa-haa! Whoo. Ha ha! Missed. Missed again. Try again. Keep trying. Missed. Good try. Missed. Missed again. Ooh-ah! Hello, Clarice. * Whoosh! Okay, my ultimate weapon: super lick. Okay, here we go. Left, right. Left, left, right, right, right, right, right, left, right. Uh! And finally, this one's for Chin Li. Hii-yah! I'ma coming, Daddy. Uh! You think I'm finished? You're right. Uh! Cho Cho. Good job, Cho Cho. That was incredible. Thank you. Had to be done. Hamilton Cage, there's something I've wanted to say to you for a while. You're under arrest for kidnapping, racketeering, cruelty to animals, and conspiracy for the murder or Chin Li. Oh. Fowler! You hurt my daddy. Uhh! No! Oh, no. Cho Cho. He's been shot. Ashley, get an ambulance. Don't get all emotional. It's embarrassing. Next thing I know, you'll be licking me. Hang in there, partner. Partner? Partner. I like that. It gives me great pleasure to introduce the recipient of the San Francisco Police Department's Medal of Valor, Detective Peter Fowler. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. You know, I used to wonder what bravery really was. It was something that you'd learn, something you'd develop. But what I discovered is that bravery exists within us all: man or woman, human or animal. You just have to find it. Sometimes you need help to do that. So I'd like to dedicate this medal to someone who saved my life, someone who taught me what I really needed to learn, someone who I wish could've been here today, someone who was there when I really needed him, Cho... Cho Cho. Ladies and gentleman, the dude who really deserves this medal, Cho Cho. Now you remember what you promised. What? What did I promise? * Hello, baby. * Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speaking. * * Oh, you sweet thing. * Do I what? * Will I what? * Oh, baby, you know what I like. * * Chantilly Lace had a pretty face * * and a ponytail hanging down. * I couldn't tell you. I promised him. * Lord, made the world * go round, round, round. * Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl * * to make me act so funny, * make me spend my money, * make me feel real loose * like a long-necked goose, * like a... * Oh, baby, it's-a what I like. * What's that, baby? But... But... But... Oh, honey. Hey, Fowler. Yeah, Fowler! But... * Oh, baby, you know * what I like. Whoo. Yeah! * Chantilly Lace had a pretty face * * and a ponytail hanging down. * A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk, * * Lord, made the world go round. * * Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl * * to make me act so funny, make me spend my money. * * Make me feel real loose like a long-neck goose, * * like a... * Oh, baby, that's-a what I like. * Cho Cho has left the building. * Hey, my name is Cho Cho. * Go ahead and laugh. * Just be careful what you throw my way * * 'cause I can dish it right back. * * The way I see it, if variety is the spice of life, * * I'm a vintage wine. * And on top of that, I'm man's best friend, * * but don't you ever cross that line. * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * I'm the one who seeks the truth. * * I have from the start. * I learned it ain't so much your mind. * * You got to follow your heart. * * The way I figure it, * I can't dwell on yesterday, * * 'cause I can't change the past. * * I got to look ahead and not behind. * * For me, life goes by fast. * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * It don't matter what others may say. * * We can make this work. * But don't mind me if the mood should strike. * * This dog's known to dig a little dirt. * * * I'll take you for who you are * * if you'll take me for what I am. * * 'Cause I can be meaner than a junkyard dog * * or gentle as a newborn lamb. * * I been trained in the school of hard knocks. * * I can push, pull, run nonstop. * * And on my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * * On my hind legs, I'll do more than just beg. * * I'm a bona fide, borderline cop. * Good God, what size is yours, then? You're one of the few people in this office with no chance of ever knowing, Charles. This is the Forte. They've just brought it in at Beanies. What's that? The Piccolo? Even if your drinks weren't penis substitutes... You'd know all about those. Bet you've got a drawer-full. You shouldn't buy coffee from Froth's or Beanies. Every sip from one of those places is raping Colombia and enriching an American corporation. Yes, well. Morning! Well, frankly, the little Italian cafe that you patronise can hardly be called a pattern of ethical virtue. It's like something out of the Sopranos, isn't it? Thank-you. Milk in first, leaf not bag? I just followed the e-mail. MARTIN: Sorry you're late, Cat. Overslept? Oh... yes. I left her sleeping. You slept with him? Christ, no. If I'd had sex with Jamie, I'd have left the house earlier than usual. I was up late watching these. The boxed set of Friends, including the lost episode and network trailers. Oh, dictionary corner, Jamie. The government needs a word for its new policy announcements. They can't call it a relaunch - they've had three already this year. I think there's a Thesaurus on this. There are no synonyms for relaunch. Oh. Technology failure, everyone. Jamie's having to fall back on his brain. "A New Beginning"? That gives the impression that they're changing tack. They are! We know that. But they want panic to look like consistency. What about "Same Shit, New Bucket"? JAMIE: "The Big Ideas"? Then they'd get sued for misrepresentation. It would be so much easier if politics were like software. They could just call it Bollocks 1, Bollocks 1.1, Bollocks XP Home Edition... Oh, look, there's a story about our Fatties campaign... TV: Profits of up to 30%. Business commentators say the shift reflects recent bad publicity over obesity in Britain and a government campaign on healthy eating. With me is the Shadow Health Secretary John Kennedy. Mr Kennedy, isn't this a triumph for the government? Their healthy eating message getting through? No, I don't accept that. But the government has just run a huge advertising campaign with the slogan... Don't Be A Fat-Head, and fast-food chains can't give chips away. You're saying it's coincidence? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Can't they get beyond just disagreeing with the other side? It's so unsophisticated. Yes, I know. The trick is compliments with a sting. This government's doing a great job, if you like extremism, political correctness, cronyism... Look, this hasn't happened because the government's paid some smart PR firm to convince people they want to be thin... Oh, hasn't it? I must say, I'm very glad to see our healthy eating campaign for the government is getting through. Though remind me not to use you as a spokesman. PR, young Jamie is about theory not practice. A philosopher may well be able to argue that a table doesn't exist, in principle. But he can still have his dinner off one. Why is the public junking junk-food? Because this is about Iraq. The public are voting with their mouths, saying to this government and its bosses in Washington, we're sick of your milk shakes. And I'll go further. In the past, we have boycotted South African wine and Zimbabwean... whatever it is Zimbabwe produces... in order to send messages to regimes despised around the world. I am asking the British public for an economic boycott of another hated administration. Let's stop buying all American food and drink. Say no to a Big Mac, say no to Iraq! I love the smell of a career burning in the morning. You think he's finished? Rule number one of British politics, don't piss in the Atlantic. The Leader of the Opposition won't tolerate Kennedy inventing foreign policy on television. He'll have to sack him for that. It's a smashing place, full of really lovely folk and locations. Namibia's main export is diamonds and, you know, that's right. Because this country is a real gem. Was that "Beautiful Botswana"? "Nice Namibia". It's homework. I always said I'd rather saw off my leg than watch a Peter Harrow programme. Ah, the tone doesn't change much. In his Zimbabwe programme, he said what a lovely smile Mugabe had. Well, now he's invited Alison and me for lunch. He's probably unsure about whether to take the knighthood from the Queen or go straight for beatification from the Vatican. Charles, there's a call from the American Embassy. Send it through upstairs. MAN: OK. That's the iris scan done. Do we conclude from all this that Britain has been added to the axis of evil? Sir, I have to warn you that humour can become a security issue. OK. Now just a few questions. Is it now... Or has it ever been? Is it now, or has it ever been, your intention to overthrow by force the government of the United States of America? Good lord! Don't tell me that thing can read minds as well? Meanwhile, there's been an escalation of support for the Shadow Health Secretary's call for a boycott of American food and drink. Many restaurants have taken American dishes off their menus. In London, people have been taking their protest against American fast-food outlets to the streets. Oh, the bonfire of the calories. How uplifting. Gentlemen, the government of the United States of America is grateful for your attendance today. Well, it shows your country is more forward-Iooking than people think. I assumed the US Ambassador would be some sort of lard-arsed red-neck. Prejudice can be a terrible thing. Mr Ambassador, Charles Prentiss and Martin McCabe. Your Excellency. J Thompson Lucas IV, Ambassador to the Court of St James. My friends call me Tommy. Gentlemen, I like to start these little meetings with a prayer. O, Lord, may thy wisdom be as a light unto the nations of the world. Amen. Amen! Hear, hear. Absolutely. I'm sorry, gentlemen. It may be a little stale in here. We've had to switch the air-con off. Students are holding a bagel-burning under the vent. You've met Hazel... under-secretary for public affairs? May we offer you some fine iced tea? You couldn't run to heated-up tea? This is kinda the way we like it. Gentlemen, we have brought you here to help us solve a mystery. Why does everybody hate America? I'll have the clam chowder, please. And a Waldorf salad to start. Easy on the walnuts, if that isn't too much trouble. I'm afraid we don't have either of those dishes today. Oh, Lord. Well, look, I'II, er... You two... I'll have the hamburger. Rare - in fact, tell the chef haemophiliac. We've taken the American dishes off the menu. Most people have the special. What's that? Fish and chips. Right. Christ. It might be cool to have ONE English retro dish on the menu as an ironic option, but not as a theme. Thank you for seeing me at such short notice. If all our clients were as little trouble as you, Prentiss McCabe would go out of business. Ah. I rather feared that's how you see me. This problem you want us to deal with... Yes. These are the latest press cuttings you sent me. "Is Peter Harrow The Nicest Man In The World?" "The Man I'd Love To Marry." "Britain's Most Shaggable Guy." I don't see the problem. You think these press cuttings are good? But have you seen where they've come from? These two come from Saga magazine. The headline goes on, "The Man I'd Love To Marry When My Husband Dies." This one, "Britain's Most Shaggable Guy." That comes from Sex For The Over-Seventies magazine. You see, I have a reputation for being nice and being old. The last travel show the BBC bought was Chris Moyles Monsters Marbella. The BBC have been sitting on Sublime Sudan for 18 months. Absolutely. That's why I need you to help me. I've had enough of being TV's Mr Nice. I need to be hated! It's unusual. Our job is normally, "She certainly didn't look 14." "He downloaded the images for his new book." That kind of thing. What you need is a reverse makeover. A hate-over! We've had some of the best minds in Washington working on this for a month, and we just do not get it. I mean, America - what's not to like? Um, Korea, Vietnam, Libya, Grenada, Iraq. The movies of Chevy Chase. Malaya, Suez, the Falklands... Iraq... Benny Hill. Gentlemen, the situation is, as I am being driven through the streets of London now, I see Ronald McDonald burning on bonfires, I see Budweiser being poured down storm-drains. Peanut-butter sales in the UK are down 90% this fiscal. Now, bad enough when the Brits all want to be skinny. But this... this Kennedy guy is running the Boston tea party in reverse. You have an expression, um, "what goes around, comes around." Do you remember that time when you were boycotting Burgundy wine and Evian water? Chirac dissed us on Iraq. Yes. Did it never occur to you that while you were renaming French fries "freedom fries" that someday someone might do the same to you? This Administration accepts that the United States has made enemies. This Administration wishes to make a fresh beginning. We want you to create a campaign that will convince the people of Britain to LOVE America again. I'll get that. I absolutely insist. You're too kind. No, it's the least I can do. I wasn't being English. I mean it. You are too kind. This is what we have to stop. Some other time, maybe. If you'll excuse me, I've got to go. I'm judging an art exhibition. Great Ormond Street. Terminal Ward. Poor kids. That's great. No, it's better than that. It's perfect. Sit down, have a brandy. Bunk off the sickle exhibition. Pictures of weeping chemo-kids in tomorrow's papers. We couldn't buy better publicity than that. Look, Jamie, maybe this could be like the last bar of chocolate before I go on the diet, eh? Oh! I almost forgot the tip. What a lovely man. Alison, did you miss this meeting? Religion. Little Jimmy Osmond. Neo-Conservatism. Spelling. J-Lo. Excellent. Now, GOOD points about America? Ben Jerry's. Botox. CHARLES: Come on, I know this is difficult. No-one's ever spun a whole country before, but... Well, there are historical examples, but they all involve either changing the name of the country or putting the black population in charge - neither of which will go down tremendously well in Middle America. CHARLES: Oh, come on! Surely the world's only superpower has got more going for it than ice-cream and cosmetic surgery. Right turn on red light if road clear. I'd bring that in here if I were transport minister. It'd be LEFT turn. Come on, Alison. You haven't said anything yet. I'm not really the person for this. Before John Kennedy was on to this, I was boycotting America. I have nothing to do with the place at all if I can help it. Oh, yes? What's your favourite film then? The Piano. Oh, Christ. Obviously. Well, apart from The Piano? Um, When Harry Met Sally... um, Lost In Translation. Um... Annie Hall. Hardly un-American activities, then. And your favourite TV shows? Um, Friends... Frasier... Seinfeld, er, Will And Grace. I think we may have discovered the truth of world politics. The only people who can be convinced of the point of America are Americans. I think the solution lies at the English end of things. I'm going to ask John Kennedy to have lunch with me. What's the point? You won't stop him spouting anti-American stuff. I don't want to stop him. I want to encourage him to carry on spouting. The English cod and French fries, please. Oh, tell me, any complaints about the new menu? The occasional American tourist. We send them round the corner to McDonalds. Sir? The all-day full English breakfast for me. And to drink? Oh, tea, tea. And in a blue-and-white striped mug, if you've got one. So, why did you want to see me? Well, as an old college friend... Which you weren't... I'm delighted to see you doing so well. No, you're not. The word at Westminster is that you're working for the American Embassy against me. No, I'm not. Yes, I am. But in PR - we're not like politicians. We don't have to believe everything we do. I'm taking their money because they asked first. But yours is the campaign that really fascinates me. There's never been anything like it in British politics. You've always said you wanted to be this nation's John Kennedy, and now... in a sense... you are. How prescient of your parents to name you after him. I know. When the Lib Dems got a Kennedy for a leader, I thought that had bollocksed it. But people never thought of Jack when they looked at him. No. More Teddy, really. So you want me to believe that you've come here to give me some free advice? Don't be silly, John! No, in my business, we take a fee off a urinal after pissing in it. Tell me, John, why don't you trust me? Because you're a satanic, amoral double-dealer who's employed by the other side. Well, you're right. I am a total bastard. And I'm playing both sides. But I won't tell my colleagues, my client, the Chancellor of the Exchequer about you, if you think that my advice is worth paying for. Well, I may, when I've heard that advice. Well, we both know, John, that you've always wanted to be leader of the Tory party. What I have in here will transform your career forever. Read it. People will call it the speech of your life. Yes, hello, this is Alison at Prentiss McCabe, leaving a message for Lulu. Um, Lulu, I got your message about whether we can get you on to Celebrity Enema. Um, I've spoken with Channel 4, and it seems that it was just an April Fools spoof in Broadcast magazine. Yep, there's actually no such series. Sorry about that. Cat, could you call Michael Winner and Jeremy Clarkson and tell them the same, please? Thanks. There's a huge picket line of liberals outside, shouting, "America, wake up and smell the coffee!" Right, let's love-bomb the Peter Harrow problem. Cat? Just nudge me a bit. Client or colleague? TV's "Mr Travel". How do we turn Mr Nice into Mr Vice? He could always sleep with your sister at your cousin's wedding. Seems to be an effective method. I'm just using that as a generic example of bad male behaviour. Although you're famous for never coming up with an idea without researching it. So, what we need is for Peter Harrow to be accused of sexual deviance and falling professional standards. Does he have a mistress who could blab? No. He fell in love with a 14-year old... That's good - the Bill Wyman of TV travel. ...when he was ALSO 14. They've been together 50 years now. Bastard. OK... Incest? No. Only child. JAMIE: It's actually quite hard to come up with anything shocking. 40 years ago, BBC presenters were sacked for getting divorced. Now, if they hump a donkey, they're on the next series of I'm A Celeb. Cat, have you got a copy of Harrow's Super Switzerland episode? Haven't you seen his back catalogue? It's for the American campaign. VOICEOVER: Britain, 2010. A fast-food giant has driven out English restaurants from the high street. If you buy the super-size fondue, you get a free William Tell doll. VOICEOVER: At the local cinema, the latest blockbuster is playing. And home-grown bands don't have a chance of topping the charts. (YODELLING) If there HAS to be a world superpower, aren't you glad it isn't Switzerland? Not bad, Jamie. Not bad at all. Which is why, Ozzy, I think you're made for the part of Shane in Emmerdale. He is a tramp, yes. Monosyllabic, but it's a great little cameo. He does indeed die in the first episode, but who wants to hang around Emmerdale, watching their career give up the ghost? And you'll be up for Best Guest Artist In A Role of Under Eight Words at the British Soap Awards. You might think you recognised the angry customer screaming at staff in that CCTV footage filmed at a London hotel this week. But then you'll have thought, "It can't be, because Peter Harrow - TV's Mr Nice - "would never do that." Right? Well, wrong, according to the tabloid newspaper which obtained that footage. The Daily News alleges that television's veteran traveller insisted three times on a change of room and responded with four-letter words when staff refused him a fourth move. We're joined by Mr Harrow's PR representative, Jamie Front. I suppose you're going to give us the usual flimflam about this being taken out of context? No. In fact, for those of your viewers who lack lip-reading skills, what Mr Harrow is saying on the footage is... "I realise that, in the pathetic little country you come from, "beds are not a high priority "because the women sleep on brothel cots and the men on mortuary slabs. "But I have walked on marble floors in Spanish cathedrals "which were more comfortable than what you laughingly call a mattress. "If you and the other Colombian drug mules "behind the reception desk weren't so busy "dashing to the lavatory to retrieve the condoms full of cocaine "floating around your bellies, "then maybe you'd have some time for your customers." Then he goes on to compare the bar staff with the Nazi party... but you get the general idea. I do. Impressively honest as well. But who do you think leaked this video to the press? It was clearly somebody determined to destroy Peter Harrow's reputation. Well, that person may have failed because we're just hearing, Jamie, that Peter Harrow has issued a full apology to the hotel staff involved... and he has agreed to give a charity lecture there. Jamie, that's got to be good news for you as his PR, hasn't it? Yes. That is entirely typical of Peter Harrow. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Force of habit, I suppose. The Times Diary rang me to ask how I felt about the hotel reception thing. I just wasn't thinking, and said, "I'm so terribly sorry." I'm so terribly sorry. I don't think I can forgive John Kennedy for tapioca being the dessert of the day at the Ivy. But I'm going to give you a second chance. I want you to go to Heathrow Airport... The American President last night authorised emergency aid to the US beef and corn industries which have been hit by John Kennedy's campaign against junk food. And there's more bad news for the White House. Mr Kennedy, encouraged by the success of his campaign, has now announced plans to stand against the leader of the opposition. Sources close to the Shadow Health Minister have suggested he'll use his first public appearance since challenging for the leadership to set out the key strategy of his manifesto. Aren't you going to stay and find out who the leader of the opposition is? Very useful for pub quizzes. I thought you said you were going to fix Kennedy. I did, didn't I? Gentlemen, this is a precaution. The FBI has put out an alert about anthrax aftershave. Yeah, I'm sorry, Tara, it was an April Fools joke... Hello. What? Oh, no. Jamie, Peter Harrow's been arrested. If there has to be a world superpower, aren't you glad it isn't Switzerland? Why everybody loves America. That had a slickness that was almost... American. The rest of it is just variations on the same theme, really. Belgium fills the high street with waffle bars. Canada replaces the Grand National with moose racing - that sort of thing. Excuse me, Mr Ambassador, we're hearing that John Kennedy's going nuclear. Think not about what that country has done to you, but rather what you can still do a dead end. –They have nothing for us? –That's what they said. God! We gotta nail him, like right now. Okay, so we keep at him. We hit him long enough and hard enough, he'll get the message. You an expert on making guys long and hard? Hey, this isn't funny. I mean, it's the goddamn first day, and the bosses are already talking about making changes. Anybody here feel like going back to their old post? Huh? Look, I hate to say this, but, uh... I think we need a shortcut. Like what? Maybe we need to squeeze a guy in Lionel's outfit, make him produce some evidence for us. That'd speed things up a bit. Produce as in plant? Hey, we all know that this guy's an asshole in the first degree. It's for goddamn sure this isn't the first body he's responsible for. –I don't know, man. –You just hear me out. A high-profile bust gets us credibility out on the street and with the bosses. Once we get our feet on solid ground, get a couple of wins under our belt... we go back to doing it the right way. Hey, we need this. Just this once. Hey, where we goin'? Ain't no police station this way. Yeah, well, we a mobile unit. Why you in such a hurry to go to jail anyway? Bringin' me in for a couple of joints, man? I ain't doin' time for no three sticks of chronic. With your record, I wouldn't be too sure. You're gonna help us build a case against Lionel. Are you on the pipe? –You see that? –We had our own tagger do some work. We're the new king of this jungle. –You think painting' a snake on the wall makes you top dog? –Wanna go back for possession? You guys may be the cops, but Lionel's the law around here. You gotta bring it a lot heavier than this to change people's minds. –I don't think he's gonna cooperate. –Give it time. –If he doesn't? –I'm thinking. You know what? Screw Rondell. We'll just try another homie. –Lionel will catch wind of it. –Can't stake him out. He's smart. If we bring him in for piddley shit, Captain Ass will just kick him. Why don't we get a warrant based on suspicion of the shooting? We drop the evidence ourselves. Lionel will scream "setup." And that's exactly what it will look like. –It can't even remotely appear like we brought the shit in. –No. No, we've gotta have another cop find it. How about planting it in his car? Crib's the best bet. When's it empty? It isn't. He's got girls streaming in and out of there day and night. We don't need you to tell us when they call. –We'll just wait, get the page ourselves. –No, they use a code. Without me, the number won't make any sense. I tried to interrogate our victim again. She still won't talk. They don't trust the police. That's why they come to me for help. I do this community a service. It's not just about the money. I help families pro bono... Cut the champion of the people crap. –So what happened? –Mayfield Duffy... pushed a cart full of groceries out of the store without paying. When my husband went to stop him, he got attacked. –What did he hit you with? –A bag of ice. –Go call the paramedics. –Mayfield is okay. He just had a bad run. No work. –He said he will pay for the stuff later. –I told him we don't do that. No money, no groceries. Look, I don't wanna get Mayfield in no trouble. I just want the money or the groceries back. Well, sir, he committed a felony. We're gonna have to arrest him. Well, then go do it. He took perishables. –Yeah? –Step out of the apartment, please. –You Mayfield Duffy? –Yeah. –Step down, please, sir. –Hands out of your pockets, sir, and behind your head. –What's the beef? –Turn around. –I told him I'd pay him. –Before or after you struck him? –Is Otto okay? I didn't mean to hit him hard. –Yeah, he's okay. Second set of cuffs. You know there are places where you can go for aid, sir. –I got aid. Then I got robbed. –Robbed? I get food stamps twice a month. That punk gangster in 29... keeps breaking into the mailbox and stealing everybody's food stamps. It will be days before I can get some more. Meanwhile, my family's starving. What am I supposed to do? Not commit a felony. –Use this purse. –It's got a false bottom and a remote mike inside. –What's that, coke? –Crack. The sentencing is more severe. Give me your purse. Come on. I want you to go inside Lionel's apartment. You tell him that you're willing to pay a street tax... to stay out working and stay safe. –I don't even know this guy. –He knows about you. You hide the crack in his bathroom, under the sink or something. This is the guy who shot up Wanda? It'll be a pleasure then. Hey, hey. You're miked. We can hear everything. If at any time the mike fails, we'll be in there, okay? –Okay. –Listen. This guy is bad. If it seems dangerous, you just say the word "gringo." Then we come riding to the rescue. –Gringo? –Yeah. Right. Hey. I mean it. Any sign of worry, you say the word. –You Happy Sandez? –Yeah, that's me. What of it? You the same Happy Sandez that's been breaking into people's mailboxes... stealing their food stamps? –Food stamps? –I don't need no ghetto coupons. –Happy, we got your sheet, man. You got three priors for theft and no job. Why don't you give those people their food stamps back so they can eat? I'm missing the game. I tell you what, Happy. My partner and I are gonna go around the corner for exactly two minutes. And when we come back... either the food stamps you took are sitting on that bottom step... or I'm gonna call some detectives down here... and they're gonna turn your life upside down. You got it? You got two minutes. Screw Ringo. I'm willing to pay you. –I don't wanna get shot up. –Smart thinking', sweet pea. –So are we cool then? –Nah, not quite. See, I like to know what I'm puttin' on the streets. Come here. Right here. –He wants to taste the kitty. –Sure. –Just let me run to the bathroom. –What for? To pop in my diaphragm. No need, baby girl. I ain't hitting that raw. –Oh, yeah. –Oh, God. The broker is a pipeline, but he's decent. If we talk to him the right way, he'll talk. That broker is a dead end. I got my witness coming in. I think she's our best bet. You know, I got 30 years experience says... if we slap this broker with obstruction of justice... he misses one home-cooked meal, he'll talk. –Tom's got seniority. Follow his lead. –The witness is here. –Hi. I'm Detective Gannon. Thanks for coming. –Carry on. So, uh, hypothetically... how would you go after the broker? The boss wants to do it Gannon's way. And he's going his way. Doesn't mean we can't go ours. They teach you that in the classroom? Goddamn, you're tight. Oh, God. –You ain't gonna dis me again, right? –No, I swear. Right? –I'm going in. –Hey, hey, hey. She didn't say gringo. –I'm going. –Hey! We don't have a warrant. And we're only gonna get one shot at this. All right? I don't care. Hey, God-goddamn it! Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man. Hey. She's a pro. This is what she does for a living. We gotta make this case, right? Right? –Oh, for God's sake. –Hey, Vic, Vic, Vic. Come here. Come here. Hey, look. We're almost there now, right? All right? It's in the bathroom, under the sink. God. Vic, I'm okay. Vic. I need to score before you take me home. –Nice digs, David. –Nice enough. You don't sound too excited. No, I am. It's just... Gilroy's stocked the pond with his own fish. I'm still figuring out what waters are safe to swim in. I could use a friendly face working here. Is this gonna be like the time you tried to get me to work Narcotics in the Valley? –It'll be different. –How? You'll say yes. –I'm happy in Robbery. –This is more money, more action, more fun. –So what's the job? –Gilroy's pick for the Strike Team, Vic Mackey. There's a spot on the team. Take it. If Mackey doesn't work out... you'll take his place. –Run the Strike Team? Even if he does work out, it's still a great gig. Come on. It's a no-lose situation for you. Your boy's going down tonight. The question is are you going down with him? Lionel's got drugs in his crib. –Lionel don't keep drugs at his crib. –I guess he got sloppy. Makes me wonder. You ever get sloppy? You wouldn't. Aw, shit! So we busted Rondell here on possession for distribution. –He wants to deal now. –What can you offer us? –My boss, Lionel. –We think he did the drive-bys. I made deliveries to his house. He's got product there. You gotta move on him right away though. –And you're willing to swear to this in an affidavit? –Sure. Whatever it takes. Detective Vendrell, let's take his statement. Call for a warrant. –Impressive. –Thanks. Getting him to roll on a heavy hitter... for a misdemeanor marijuana charge. I can't take all the credit. I don't think he fully grasps the distinction between felony and misdemeanor. When that paperwork comes in... I'd like to go on that bust with you. See you in action. Sure thing. Your pager just went off. I know we don't have much time. –Sorry. I'm bound by tradition. –This tradition... does it always include multiple rape? –No, that was wrong of them. What if the kidnappers decide the family owes them money? They could go after her again. They probably will. I see how you're being honorable. You tell me how they're being honorable. Look, if you helped us though, if you led us to them, it would be a message to them... that the brokers are not the only ones who have to follow by the rules, so do the kidnappers. Your community would understand that. They could appreciate the honor in it. Informant? Yo, who the hell told you I got drugs? That's confidential for security reasons. –I'm sure you understand. –Yo, don't play me, dog. –I've got a right to face my accuser. –You can mention that at trial. Hey, yo, man. Take it easy over there. Hey, you heard the man. Respect the property. Got something. Whoa. How many years of experience in this room... and the goddamn rookie finds the brick on his first day. –Let me see that, man. –Nice. Yeah, damn straight. The kid's a natural. –I taught him everything he knows. –I'll bet you did. Yo, that ain't mine, man. This is a stone-cold setup. –You put it there. –Found it under your sink, sir. –Well, this is a goddamn setup, man. –Vic, Vic. –Check this shit out. –That's a TAC-9. It's the same kind of gun used in the drive-by. We plant this too? Yo, look. I didn't shoot nobody. Is that what ballistics is gonna tell us about that dead hooker? I didn't think so. –I have 10 minutes to get there. –We better hurry. Just get in the cage. –Good work, Vic. You know, you really pulled it together. –Thanks. The chief's happy. He wants another press conference to trumpet the quick results. –I'll do most of the talking, but he wants you there too. –Sure. Detective. We got a call from our kidnappers. We set up a drop. You mind getting our backs? The captain said we could help each other out. Hey, my day's just getting started. Shut up! Get down. Stop! Get back here! Stop, goddamn it! –Down. Hands behind your back. –Where do you think you're going? You got him cuffed? I said stop! Goddamn it! All right, we're secure here. –You all right? –I got him. Keep looking. –That's them. –Which ones? Those ones. Hey, what happened? Latigo had a change of heart. –You didn't tell me that. –It happened quickly. I've been sitting right here. –Those our kidnappers? –Well, uh... our broker cooperated, led us to them. Well done. Thanks. –You didn't have to do that. –Credit's overrated. Tangible results. Nice goddamn job. Both of you, really. I told you he'd deliver. –I just didn't think twice on the first day. –What did you expect? The whole team worked well together. Some things could have been smoother, but we'll get there. I'm sure his public defender will have some questions. –It's just a few scratches. –From being dragged through barbed wire. I told him to stop. –Bet you next time he listens. –Come on, fellas. The job's hard enough without tension between the walls. We should be celebrating. Yeah. Nathan, you gotta be kidding me. What am I supposed to do now? –Use the ladies room. –Jesus Christ. Relax. The plumber promised me he'd get to it tomorrow. Try not to destroy that one too. The obvious thing would have been to go Gannon's way. Instead, you got Latigo to do exactly what he didn't wanna do and feel good doing it. Some cases you get an instinct. –I don't get it. How come I haven't heard of you? –It's a mystery. I was thinking... maybe we could serve as partners again. –You know, on a permanent basis. –Wherever I'm needed. So, if I spoke to Aceveda, asked him to put us together, you wouldn't mind? No, I wouldn't mind. Okay, who took my chair? Hey, Lem and Ronnie are psyched. We're gonna go get a beer. Start without me. I gotta take care of something first. Look, I, uh, I talked to both of them, and they're cool about what went down. –Good. –We got Lionel. –Got us a little breathing room. –Yeah. –It was easy, wasn't it? –Yeah. It was a little too easy. My church conducts monthly food drives in Farmington to help feed families. I don't need the gospel. I need work. My pastor knows a lot of people. I'll ask him if someone's hiring. Next time, find some help before you do something stupid. Yeah. –What are you doing? –I'm just letting him know where his family could get some help. If you're gonna get emotionally involved with every collar... get off the streets and into social work. You don't have to tell me about the streets. I grew up on them. Living in them and working in them are two different things. Look, I know I got a lot to learn about police work. And you've got your way that works for you. But I got a way I wanna try for me. Hey. Oh, Jesus. –I didn't know we're coed. –Welcome to the experiment. –I'll be out in a sec. –All right. Cool. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. It was a good day today. Hey, man. So how was it out there? Fine. Yeah. There's nothing like your first time. –I didn't think Gilroy was ever gonna sign off on me. –Don't take it personally. –He was just busy. –Well, I'm glad to be here. You'll like it. Oh, the John's still broke. I'm working on it. –You ready? –Yeah, I'm ready for anything. Good, 'cause we get everything down here. Starting to get a rep out on the street. Bad guys don't like seeing us. It's starting to get fun. Hey, hey. –This here is Terry. He comes to us from Robbery. –Robbery? –We love you, pretty boys from Robbery. –How you doing? ⬄25000÷1000⬄ Philadelphia 1976 You can barely tell. I'm flying. Good as new. Look. Todd's sick of me. So maybe you're sick of him. Let's go back to Tim's room. He's cooler than any of them. You really want to? Maybe later. You're not supposed to have people here. Who says? Your mom and dad. You're gonna call them in Jakarta? Give the lady a beer for her silence. Is Jill coming? What do you think? I saw her today. She said maybe, maybe not. Please. She's coming. Who's gonna clean this up in the morning? Go watch TV, Bonita. There she is. Oh, hi, gorgeous.

Á¦·11Ì ·¡Ä¡Æ÷�å( �Ð o£¶óæ�) ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2003/09/28 You writing? Yeah. How you doing, Detectives? Trash still here, chairs on the floor. They hadn't closed yet. Eight years on the line, never had a triple. Last out gets the action. This an overnighter? Kid who opens up found this morning. Looks like a straight robbery? Go talk to the scene man, kid. Register's raided. Let's get it dusted. It's a bad case of death. All three shot. Her throat's cut. Doer's got a gun. Why's he gotta slit her throat, too? Um, Detective? When you dust the register... We might find your prints? That's why we keep our hands full. All right, I'm knocking on some doors. We boring you in here? Stillman called. There's a civilian down at Central, wants to talk to you. Me? Asked for a lady in Homicide. I hear you were in the Badlands. Della's Chicken and Ribs. What's the deal with this civilian? Civilian? Probably some nut job. Vera said that he, uh... I told Vera to deal with her. I've been on since midnight. I got three murders to solve, and he's pawning his dog calls off on me? I know, Lil. He is one pain in the ass, boss. Yeah, look, she's right outside. Just chase her demons away. Your triple's not gonna go anywhere, all right? You better give Vera some hell. Like it would do any good. Detective Rush. Homicide. You do murders? I investigate murders. I want to tell you about one. What's your name? Bonita... Bonita Rafaela. You been smoking some pot today, Bonita? It helps with the pain. I've got cancer. Sorry. I saw a murder. A girl was killed on a tennis court. Where's the court? Chestnut Hill. At the house where I used to work. The boys were having a party. He hit her... over and over and over and over. You didn't call the police? I went to bed. I thought it wasn't my business. A girl dying wasn't your business? And when did this happen? In 1976. 1976, Bonita? 27 years ago, and you're just telling this now? I had a son. I needed to work. But now I have this cancer. Something die in here? Whew... These cases. The timing adds up. Jill Shelby, beaten at a neighbor's house, found the next morning. Case was never solved. Yeah, like the rest of these job. But now we got a witness. Are you saying we should open a 27-year-old case, Lil? There's new direction. Yeah, witnesses from that long ago are gonna be pretty shaky. Maybe. But then, time can be on our side. People who wouldn't talk then might be willing to now. Look at this maid. Mm-hmm. I mean, time passes. People's loyalties and circumstances change. Do you believe this maid? Yeah, I do. I don't know the assigned detective. Britt. I bet Jeffries does. Britt was top shelf. Got killed in Camden trying to pick up a fugitive. So he's not the reason the job went cold. Uh-uh. And I remember this one. It made him crazy. The girl's mother would come in year after year, Britt never had anything for her. who'd he look at for the doer? The two brothers, one being the boyfriend. A live-in cook made the list. And, of course, some folks thought a gang of black kids must have come to Chestnut Hill that night. The boyfriend his top pick? Yeah, it was rumored he had been violent with her. Todd Whitley? Oh, yeah. Cocky little jerk, as I recall. From a society family. No one would talk about those boys. The old man was too powerful. Put up walls Britt couldn't even get past. Someone should read the job again. Maybe those walls are shakier now. How about you? I got a job. But Vera might get a sense of achivement out of it. You spoke to the maid, Lil. Only 'cause he stuck me with her. This job deserves another look and Vera doesn't have the type of personality to get anywhere with society people. You give Vera my triple, you're gonna find him in Della's freezer. Excuse me, is Evelyn Shelby here? I'm Evelyn. Hi. Lilly Rush. How'd you find this house? Well, I'm a Detective Homicide. Is it about someone who stayed here? No, um... it's about your daughter. A witness has come forward in her case. Someone who worked in the neighborhood. So you don't know anything. We have new direction. Look, I came into Homicide every August, for over 20 years. Eventually, I figured out that Detective Britt was too much of a gentleman to tell me to stop coming, that her case would never be solved. You can only hope so long. So I should just forget about Jill? How about Todd Whitley? Should I forget him, too? Todd was lovely to Jill. Really, I... hear he knocked her around. What's lovely about that? I still see Todd Whitley... and Melanie. They're married now. Melanie... Jill's best friend? They became close after she died. And I'm not interested in stirring up more accusations against him. Well, I'm reopening the case. I'm not saying don't do your job. It's just that no one's been able to solve it after all these years. And... and I-I just can't get pulled in again. What kind of person doesn't wanna solve her daughter's murder? Someone in a lot of pain? Well, she won't help me with Todd, she thinks he's a golden boy. And the best friend's married to him. That's a tight inner circle. So Jill's own mom isn't on board, who's this for? You working a dead case instead of our triple? Talk to him. Unsolved isn't dead, Las. And she's got direction. Don't you? Yeah, but I also got three murders at this restaurant. All right. Who else can you go to on this? Well, not Melanie. So I guess that leaves the brothers. What was their party line on the abuse? The party line was don't talk to the cops. Going out on the street, boss. Right. Neighborhood survey on Della's. You coming or not? Let me just work this one for one more interview, then I'm back. Great. All right, what's your play with the brothers? Well, Todd's a superstar lawyer now. Eric is more of a fringe case. Divorced, drinking problem, doesn't exactly work. Sounds like he's your first stop. Eric? Yeah? Detective Rush. I'm heading out. I have a meeting. There's a 1:00 in Old City. It's not that kind of meeting. Oh. Um.. I'm.. It'll just take a few minutes. It's about Jill Shelby. You were in school with her, right? Chelsea Day? I can't talk to you. How come? They treated my brother and me like suspects back then. Well, it was an open secret Todd was hitting Jill. He loved Jill. People hit people they love. I shouldn't say anymore. Maybe you could just tell me what she was like. She was nice. When you were alone with her, at least. When you weren't alone? I don't wanna speak ill of the dead. It's okay. I hear it every day. She'd ignore you. She ignore you that night? She was at her worst at parties. I see dollar signs, already, Charlie. That was a $50 value. Thank you! Come on, Jill. Tell us what a kiss from Eric's worth. I can't. He's Todd's brother. You've already kissed two other guys. I'm not into it. Come here, Eric. So she was kind of a bitch to you that night. She didn't mean it. That was the just way she got sometimes. Mmm. Anyway, I need to go. Oh, did you letter in high school? You look kind of athletic. One year. Wrestling. Todd Whitley. Lilly Rush. Have a seat, Lilly. Who'd you row for? Uh, Chelsea Day and Penn. I'm still on the water most mornings. Impressive. This is about Eric I assume. You don't seem too shocked he might be in trouble. Patterns of behavior, right? Recognize her? What is this? A homicide investigation. Look, that was painful for a lot of people. I suggest you leave it alone. I can't do that. It's an open case. Why did someone like you become a cop? Oh, bad education, limited talent. You should be married, living the good life. Well, no one ever asked. So here I am working a homicide. Well, as I told the cops at the time, I was with my brother all night. Actually, a lawyer told them that in a statement three weeks later. So? Look... my father owned half of Philadelphia. People like to see families like ours in trouble. We hired a lawyer. Maybe your kind of people don't do that... mine do. Even if there's nothing to hide? I can't help you anymore. I understand you're married to Melanie now. She can't help you either. Do you still have a problem with violence? I know you once hit Jill hard enough to give her three stitches and all. Everyone knew the cops had it in for me over Jill. They were wrong then, you are wrong now. Ever hit Melanie? All right, Lilly, you're right. Someone did beat the crap out of Jill on a regular basis. But It wasn't me. Her father was a real son of a bitch. You sure know how to find people. I thought you'd still be living in Chestnut Hill. I like the city. Did you find something? Autopsy records and medical records. And? I just don't understand these injuries Jill had before she died. Injuries? Broken rib when she was 12.... a concussion ... a jaw fracture at nine years old. What's the deal? She played field hockey and soccer. Uh-huh. She was very active. Evelyn, my ex-husband was a mean drunk. I know the difference between a soccer injury and a trip down the stairs. Did your husband beat your daughter? He was in Houston the night she died. That wasn't my question. He's been dead nine years. And now you work at a Shelter for battered women and children. Where did you get that? The case file. I took this picture. I don't see how you can just forget her, Evelyn. Forget? I think about her every day. This ruined my life. Then it still matters. I can't look back. It's too hard. So you sell your Chestnut Hill house, pack up your old life and-and think you can just walk away? You can't walk away from her, Eveylyn. She's a part of you. There's now hope now. And what if you don't solve it? Where does that leave me? What if I do solve it? My husband doesn't want me talking to you. Todd doesn't want you helping with your best friend's murder investigation? I thought we put this to rest. It's important to me, Melly. So you came to the party with Jill but left alone? I drank too much. I had to go home and I couldn't find her. You made a big point in your interview that you were sure it wasn't Todd. The detective made a big point of asking about him. He was fixated on the Whitleys, but barely looked at Tim Dorn. This is the cook? He lived in our guest house, and he was with the girls that night. When we left for the party, he told Jill she should come by later if she wanted. When I heard she was missing the next day, Tim was the first person I thought of. All this information and I got one page on the guy the mother and best friend think did it. You gotta listen to the best friend. Teenage girls tell each other everything. Well, Britt wrote two sentences on him, then blew him off. It's hard to tell if he even worked him hard enough. Especially when he had it out for Todd. Dorn's up in Frackville. Locked up? Why do you think he's gonna talk to you? I'm an optimist. Lil, I got a wife at home. You don't have to come. You think it's a dead case. Let me just call her. Five years for forgery. I got a facility for it, gets me into trouble. You ever dabble in more serious crime? Like the violence done to Jill Shelby? No, Ma'am. I'm strictly a cerebral criminal. Pretty attractive, wasn't she? She was pretty cute, for a girl. You did tell her to come over that night. She came over a lot to get high. She and her little vixen friend Melanie. Well, that little vixen thinks that you killed Jill. Well, if you marry the prime suspect I guess you better point to someone else. Jill's mom also thinks you did it. A woman lives in a certain world. If the shining neighbor boy killed her daughter, that world's a lie. Britt has your alibi down here as going to bed at 10:00. I guess he must have kept his word. Actually, I was with a... friend that night. What friend? Bobby Jordan. This big, luscious college boy down the street. Neither of us was exactly out and proud at the time, so we asked Britt not to document the sleepover. Bobby's gonna confirm that? Well, I imagine he's come to terms by now. Did Jill ever talk to you about Todd? Oh, sure. Those girls told me everything. Like what? Teenage drama. They even told me things they didn't tell each other. Like all the while Jill was fretting that Todd doesn't treat her right, Melanie was doing him on the side. You can't be here. Gate was open. My partner, Chris Lassing. How you doing? Todd is furious at you. Uh-oh. Thanks to you his brother came here last night, drunk, after six years of being sober. Eric did? Look, I've told you about Tim Dorn. Why do you have to keep bothering us? Dorn's alibi checked out. We know about you and Todd stepping out on Jill back then. I... I don't have to talk to you. We have to arrest you? You don't want that, Lady. You should see our holding cell. Your headband will get all dirty. Why does this matter? 'Cause when you tell us one lie, Melanie, even if it's small, that makes us think you're hiding other things. Like whatever Todd did to Jill that night. It wasn't Todd, okay? I know... because I was with him that night. That is some top. It's new. You look like, uh... What? A patriotic street walker. It was in Seventeen. Why do you have to be a jerk? Why don't you go and comfort her? You know, you could use some time in charm school. Could I? I could give you a tutorial... upstairs. What about Jill? What about her? I'm obviously not proud of it. It sounds like Eric had pretty strong feelings for Jill. So? So, why'd he fall off the wagon just 'cause Jill's name came up? Two million people in this city, I gotta run into you? You think I'm thrilled seeing you? All right, look, I'm sorry if I was obnoxious in your office. More than obnoxious. It's just the way that you were looking out for Eric. It was... I hear he's drinking again. Don't talk about Eric. Todd, I know that you were with Melanie that night. Excuse me? Which doesn't add up with you saying you were with Eric. So I figure that you just said that to protect him. Okay, let's say I was with Melanie that night. You can understand why I wouldn't want the entire world knowing that, right? Right. So why not just say that you were sleeping? Why give Eric an alibi? You should drop this. Eric did it. That's why you can sleep at night and have a normal life, and he's a mess. You should just watch it. When did the hard drinking start? After he killed her? I can make your life very difficult. Eric kills Jill... you clean up after him. Brother's keeper ever since. Am I close? Tell me something, Lilly. What is the point of all of this after so many years? People shouldn't be forgotten. Even if they are my kind of people. Maybe they don't have a lot of money, they don't have lawyers... but they matter. They should get justice, too. I see. You're a crusader. I guess I am. Good luck. So, is sleep like an optional thing for you? I'm not tired. Guess who weighed in on your case today? Mmm... the commissioner. The commissioner? Apparently he and the Whitley's father were college pals. Todd called Bradley to tattle on me? What a baby. And now Bradley's wondering when you're going back on the line. He couldn't pick me out of a line up. Suddenly he's tracking my career? Screw him. Don't say that too loud in this building. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rush... your boyfriend's downstairs. I'm single. You sure it's not your boyfriend? One of the Whitleys... booked for DUI. You crash that nice car of yours, Eric? Thanks to you. I had something to do with it? All I did was bring up Jill. Why's that send you on a bender? My brother called our lawyer, who called the commissioner, who's a very close family friend. I heard all about it. Then why don't you take a hint and back off? 'Cause something tells me you and I are one scotch away from a good conversation. Hey, Lil. Hey. Hey. Las is in with Evelyn Shelby. Huh. I kept my own box on Jill. It's been packed away for years, but I thought maybe it could help. Good. Melanie told me about her and Todd in high school, behind Jill's back. Well, she was only 15. Mrs. Shelby, it looks like we're closing in on Eric Whitley. The younger one? Yeah, well, he doesn't have an alibi for that night. And, uh, he was pretty sick in love with your daughter. I was looking at her yearbook, and I remembered this boy. Ann Winters' son. A few years after Jill died he said something to Ann about the Whitleys getting away with murder. Why isn't this in the file? Well, it should be. John told it to the police. What's the kid name? Charlie Winters. If Britt talked to him I'd have a record of it. He was meticulous. Well, are you sure your husband mentioned it to Britt? He told me he did. Could he have lied, Evelyn? Well, I don't know. I mean, I hounded him about it. He said it came to nothing. That I should stop brining it up. Stop pointing fingers at the Whitleys. They were a powerful family. I guess we both know what it's like to have a husband fail you. We'll find Charile Winters, Evelyn. We'll talk to him, and we'll let you know what he says. Thanks for coming out. I can't really leave the retreat. Sure. It's about Jill Shelby. So, now you wanna hear? Yeah, you told the cops you didn't see anything. Yeah, at first. But then I came to the Shelbys with some good information, and I got the brush-off. You come stoned in your VW van? So? Charlie, Evelyn Shelby's the one who told us about you. Screw Evelyn Shelby, okay? I tried to help her years ago. She wouldn't hear it. You're right, Charlie, but she's not afraid now, and we wanna hear. Okay. I was, um... Kind of passed out on a lounge chair. How could this happen? Just shut up. Why'd you have to wear this? What? It's ruined. That's what you were thinking about? That stupid jacket? Just leave things to me. So, they... got in their car and left, and, man, I just got the hell out of there. Why'd Eric care so much about the jacket? There was this... one year that Eric did wrestling, and... Todd couldn't wrestle to save his life. I think it was the only thing that... he could do better than Todd. Hi. How was it? Good. I need a couple of minutes. I... I have to tell you something that's gonna be hard to hear. Todd was seen with the murder weapon that night. But I was with him. You were asleep after drinking all night. He could've got out of bed later. This is the father of my children. He was involved with a murder, Melanie, that's someone that you don't know very well. Well, maybe he was just covering up for Eric. Even if that's all he did, that's accessory to murder. I wanna tell you something... but if I do, I can't go home. I can help you with that. They're talking every night. They're arguing. Todd keeps telling Eric to stay away from Tabby's. What's that? They have an aunt, Tabitha. She has a house in Chestnut Hill. It was... it was close to where we all used to live. Pack a bag for you and the kids. You're coming with me. Hey. Where's my wife? Safe. Hey, bitch, you tell me where she is. Is this how you handle women you can't control? This supposed to scare me? It's supposed to make you think. I'm not like the girls you're used to, Todd. You can't try to charm me, then when that doesn't work, talk down to me, then when that doesn't work, get aggressive. I'm not Jill or Melanie. I'm the police, and we're at the police headquarters, you moron. You gonna talk to me like that? What are you gonna do? Kill me in the parking lot of Central? You think you'll get away with it again? I know about Tabby's. I'll have a warrant tomorrow, and guys are sitting on it right now. Whatever you hid there, we're about to find it. So it's over. Okay. I can't protect him anymore. I did as much as I could. Why don't you come in, give me a statement? Okay. Flipped on his brother. Do you believe him? I don't know. I gotta find Eric. No meeting tonight, huh? Screw the meetings. Scotch and soda. Look, I can't talk to you. My brother chewed me out the day you came by. Really? 'Cause he's been talking to me a lot. Yeah, well, I guess he puts himself in a different category. He told me about you and Jill, and... that you were in love with her. She was his girlfriend. Oh, she'd hang around with you when, uh... no one was around, but drop you the second Todd showed up. Look, I already told you that she was like that. And that he found you two together that night. Look, I said I couldn't talk to you. What happened to your letter jacket, Eric? I don't know. Another. I don't think there's time for another. I have to arrest you. He told me you did it, and that you came to him for help afterwards, and you two buried the racket at your aunt's house. Why would I kill her? Because she humiliated you. She accused you of watching them. Oh, my God. So what, he's pinning it on me now? It's his story against yours. And you're the problem drunk who never got his life together, so if you have anything to give me, you should do it now. Look, he ruined my jacket. He got his blood all over it. Hers, too. You didn't throw it out, did you? And Jill didn't humiliate me. He did. Hi, gorgeous. Where were you? Well, you can't really ask me that. That's my jacket. So you finally got a taste of her, huh? Now you have something real to jerk off to. Todd. Huh, have you seen him in the window watching us have sex? That's crazy. Up in the tree with his hand down his pants. Stop. Please. Well, you're the one who just screwed him. I didn't screw him. Give me some credit. I saw you all pressed up to him. Only 'cause you were off with Melanie. Just stop talking. Asshole. Bitch. Don't. Shut up! You're so pathetic. And you're such a prick. You shut your mouth. Screw you. Hey, slut... I said shut your mouth. # Creedence Clearwater Revival ÀÇ "Have You Ever Seen The Rain" # # Someone told me long ago # # There's a calm before the storm # # I know # # It's been coming for some time # # When it's over, so they say # # It'll rain a sunny day # # I know # # Shining down like water # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day # # Yesterday and days before # # Sun is cold and rain is hard # # I know # # Been that way for all my time # # Till forever # # On it goes # # Through the circle, fast and slow # # I know # # It can't stop, I wonder # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day # # Yeah # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # I wanna know # # Have you ever seen the rain? # # Coming down on a sunny day # Narrator: Previously on Justice League...

Stay back, all of you. Everything's in the hands of Fate now. [chanting in foreign language] [scream] [both chanting in foreign language] [chanting] How could you possibly know that incantation? Where I come from, it's the closest thing we have to a prayer. Is it over? No. Only a beginning. It will rest, then attack again. We must complete the original spell. You don't have the strength. Nor do I have a choice. What is going on here? What was that thing? There's no time. Make time... Or are you scared Because there's no water in here? We're not gonna fight again, are we? No, we aren't. I'll show you what you wish to know. Pretty. Where is that? It's Atlantis thousands of years Before it sank beneath the waves. In those days, Atlantis was ruled by sorcerer kings. And fortunately so, for Atlantis, Along with most of the ancient world, Found itself under attack by extradimensional beings called "the Old Ones." [roar] The Old Ones nearly destroyed humanity As they prepared the way For the most powerful of their number-- Great Itchtultu . But king Poseidon gambled that they could be stopped. He gathered nearly all of the ambient mystical energy on earth, Then forged it into a single weapon. The power of the trident Served to banish the Old Ones from our realm. But the price was high. Poseidon knew that the same mystic energy He used to defeat the Old Ones Also powered the spells that prevented Atlantis From sinking beneath the ocean. He saved the world, But doomed Atlantis to rest forever At the bottom of the sea. Now the Old Ones seek to return to our world. Already, fissures have appeared, Allowing creatures from their world To gain entrance into ours. When you interrupted, We were helping Fate cast a spell to bar their way. And now we must complete the ceremony. I won't let you torture Grundy again. It's not exactly torture, Diana. More like... Sacrifice. How do you know so much about this? My people once worshipped Itchtultu . On Thanagar? The Old Ones are an evil not bound By your understanding of geography. In return for his favors, My ancestors made offerings to him. I can't believe anyone would cooperate With that... thing. It was thousands of years ago. We were still a primitive culture. With your knowledge, Perhaps you can help with the ceremony. Forget the ceremony. We're not sacrificing Grundy or anybody else. Grundy volunteered. I'm not sure he's competent to volunteer. Does he even understand what you're asking of him? Grundy understands. Grundy helps magician, then magician will help Grundy. I agree with Superman. There has to be another way. There is. We go to Itchtultu 's world and kick his slimy-- Bird nose is right. Fight, not hide. No. We should stick to our original plan. This may be better. It's more likely to work than simply recasting a broken spell. It's a fool's errand. I joined with you to protect Atlantis. And the rest of the world be hanged? We need your power. So do my people. My place is with them. Aquaman-- I have spoken. Very well. A spell to return you to your home. Inza, I must ask you-- To remain here as your anchor So you can find your way back. Prepare yourselves. I always thought it was a fable to scare children. I'll take point. No! Keep down! What did you do that for? In this realm, Ground and sky are not always parallel. If we are separated, You could become hopelessly lost. I'm glad to see you safe. And I you, my love. Assemble my war council. Atlantis is in grave danger. Attack from the surface world? Not this time. But our enemies must be very near indeed. You've heard reports from our sentries. No. It's the creatures of the sea. Mera, I can't hear their thoughts. They're gone. Superman: I still don't see How your people could have fallen Under the sway of a creature like Itchtultu . Hawkgirl: Thanagar was a harsh world in those days. Itchtultu gave us agriculture, Mathematics, philosophy. The foundations of our entire culture. But something changed? You stopped believing in him. Yes. Modern thanagarians bow down To no higher power. I sense that we are very near our goal. [scream] [screaming] Grundy hates stupid screaming man. Grundy knows how he can crush Lots of screaming men. Aargh! Bird nose helps Grundy? But bird nose and her friends hate Grundy. Grundy help bird nose, Bird nose help Grundy, ok? Excuse me. Hawkgirl smash. [scream] Superman: Everybody ok? Grundy: Ok. Hawkgirl: Fine. Magician: I am unharmed. Let's get on with this. For Atlantis! Hawkgirl: Let me ask you something. Do you really gain strength When you call on your gods? Of course I do. My beliefs sustain me. That must be comforting. There are times when faith is all we have to rely upon. I don't know how you can Bear the weight all alone. Great Hera. What is that? The breach between this dimension and our own. My spell weakens. It is only a matter of time Until it fails altogether. Then we stop them here. Not all of us. You and Wonder Woman halt their advance. The rest of us will take the battle to Itchtultu . Stay on the path. Magician, why we stop? He's here. I feel him. Where? I'm not sure. Everywhere. Be on your guard. Itchtultu: Speak not until spoken to, dust mote. Ok, that was just rude. Wind mote, who are you? Shayera Hol. Hawkgirl. You have the stench of the thanagarians upon you. Says the giant squid. Definitely thanagarian. I will speak to the Hawkgirl Before I destroy her. You others hold no interest. [groan] Grundy crush pimple man. Hang on, Grundy, I've got him. Get back, bird nose. Let me put that out for you. [whoosh] Speak to me, child of Thanagar. Nothing to say I've got a gesture for you, but my hands are tied. How I've missed your people's spirit. We don't miss you. We outgrew you-- thousands of years ago. I gave your people everything. Why did you forsake me? Forsake? We threw you out. The price for your favors was too high. My tribute was equitable. I earned your faith. Really? What's a fair price for the souls Of my ancestors? Snake face steals souls? Give Grundy back his soul, snake face, Or Grundy crush! You hear Grundy? Give it back! Where is Grundy's soul, snake face? Tell Grundy! Tell Grundy, or Grundy crush! Uh! They aren't attacking. No, they're running. I think I can seal the breach with the trident, But I need something to plug the hole. But what's big enough to-- That could work. Let's find the others. Oh! [panting] They're... strong. Begone! Aargh! [groan] Grundy must be close for snake face to fight so hard. [gasping] [roar] Big ugly monster thing won't stop Grundy. [groan] Oh... Grundy. [moan] Grundy can't move. Bird nose get Grundy's soul for him? Rest. I'll finish what you started. Itchtultu: You will not do this thing, Shayera Hol of Thanagar. Itchtultu still has faith in you. So do I. Grundy: Bird nose? I'm here. Ahh... Grundy thinks he is going away now. No. Just hang on. Do you think Grundy's soul is waiting for him? Grundy, I don't believe-- Yes, it's waiting for you. Then Grundy gets his reward. [sobbing] I tried to do this according to human customs. You honor his memory. He was happy at the end. I still don't understand why. It's faith, Hawkgirl. You're not supposed to understand it. You just have it. NARRATOR: Previously on Justice League: If you help Grundy, Grundy will help you. Their curse removed your soul. Grundy wants it back! Will magician help? I will do everything I can. The walls between the worlds have been torn asunder. I order them now sealed. Banish the Old Ones and seal the breech! Stop! You take the magician.

You're not supposed to understand it. You just have it. [English - US - SDH] Are you alive? Yes. Prove it. It has begun. - Make a hole! As I was saying, form follows function. Nowhere is this axiom of design more readily apparent... than on board the world-famous Battlestar Galactica. This ship, the last of her kind still in service... was constructed over 50 years ago during the early days of the Cylon War. Originally there were 1 2 Battlestars, each representing one of Kobol's 1 2 colonies. Galactica represented Caprica and was first commanded by Commander Nash-- "The Cylon war is long over, yet we must not forget the reasons why--" - Commander Adama, if I may? - Captain. I just wanted Baker. Oh, no. You can set your mind to it and pack your kit. You asked me to marry you and you meant it. And I said I would and I meant it. So you can get your great brute of a self ready because I'm coming by the first passage I can find. Your loving Dover. Dover, right? Is she sick? - She's coming. - Coming here? - To take me back to Pennsylvania. - Oh, my God. She's coming to take me back whether I'm ready to go or not. Well, you did ask my sister to marry you. And we've been out here almost four years. And two years was your agreement with her. You told her you could make your fortune in that time and go home as rich as Croesus. I thought you were on my side. You came out here to do something big. Am I right or am I wrong? - You're right. - Well, your time's more than run out. And you haven't done it yet because you keep putting it off and putting it off, because you know that when you do it, it'll be the end of this life for you. You might as well face it, lad, it's gonna be the end anyway once my sister gets here, and that's a fact. Emilio Estevez was the biggest bandit of them all, senor. This whole town is his? He was the enemy of Benito Juárez. Also, he was the enemy of Maximilian. Also, he did not care for his mother. When he took this town, he kept it. Everything he steals, he brings to this place. It's the Sodom and Gomorrah of Mexico. Yeah. They'll remember me for this. It's like the sack of Rome. But we are only a dozen guns. But with the big gun, we can do it. Okay, the big gun. Ha, ha, ha. Hey, look. You suppose? Aye. Those three were doing what we're thinking about. It's not gonna be easy, Baker. There are over a hundred guns down there. Well, the hell with their guns, Tommy. This is it. Something big. Big. Laddie! Hiyah! Yes? Sir, I think you best come to the saloon, sir. Saloon, why? Well, I think you best come and see, sir. Very well. I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill And o'er the moor and valley Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill Since parting with my Sally I seek no more the fine and gay For each does but remind me How swift the hours did pass away With the girl I left behind me Oh, ne'er shall I forget the night The stars were bright above me And gently lent their silvery light When first she vowed she loved me But now I'm bound to Brighton camp Kind heaven, favor find me And send me safely back again To the girl I left behind me Sir, the men wanted me to tell you what a pleasure it's been to serve under you. And, well, we know it's gonna be two weeks before you're leaving, but some of the men here are gonna be out on patrol when it comes your time to leave us, and, well, we'd like to take this opportunity... Sir, it's my privilege and honor to be the one chosen to present you with this token of our esteem. I speak for all the horse soldiers in your command when I say that it's been an honor to serve with you. Under. Under. - Under you, sir. Ahem. Yes. Thank you, corporal. Thank you. Men, I find myself rather at a loss for words. It's most difficult for me to express my feelings about this occasion and all of you and the cavalry. I believe only a soldier could understand that, possibly only a horse soldier. I've been a cavalryman for 30 years. And it's been my privilege and my honor to be acquainted with a great many very brave men. So I'm most grateful tonight for this opportunity to tell you that of all those with whom I served, you men are the finest. And I thank you. Sir. Sir, you believe in fair play, don't you? And doing what's right? Why, of course, sergeant. Well, it was me that was supposed to give you that Indian headdress and not Corporal James here. And, well, I'd like your permission to express my feelings on this matter, sir. Oh, I see. Well, certainly. Corporal James, that was a bad thing you done to me. But, sergeant... I'm gonna take you one by one what put him up to it too. Try me, sarge! - Excuse me, sir. - Carry on, sergeant. - Oh, your hat, sir. - Thank you, corporal. That was very unwise, you know. Sergeant Fitzsimmons is sensitive. - Sensitive, sir? - Very sensitive. Colonel? Evening. - Good evening, sir. - Will you sit a spell? - Don't mind if I do. Thank you. - Have a cigar. - I will. Thank you. Well, captain, I'm going to miss this outfit very much. And any day now, my wife will be arriving through the gate, and away I go. Mrs. Morgan is coming here to the fort? Yeah. With bells on, captain. Bells on. I guess she wants to be sure I retire this time. I started to twice before, but when I came right down to it, why, I couldn't. Listen to that. MEN I seek no more the fine and gay for each does but remind me History we're making, captain. We're making history. Someday, it'll be a tired, old, ghost town, that's all, blowing in the wind. Ahem. Well, good night, captain. - Good night, sir. - Thank you for the cigar. You're welcome, colonel. Kind heaven, favor find me And send me safely back again To the girl I left behind me How are you? - What the...? - That Mr. John Anderson. Well, yeah, but, uh... It was his last wish on his deathbed. Mr. Anderson said if his friends cannot be with him, he always want to be with his friends. Heh, heh. That was a very fine gesture. - What you like to drink? - Oh, whiskey, I reckon. You wouldn't be knowing a man named Baker, I don't suppose? He rides with a dog. Si, everybody knows Senor Baker. He been around lately? Oh, seven, eight days ago. Why do you ask? Is Senor Baker a compadre to you? No, not exactly. I heard he was planning something big. Oh, yes. He's planning something big. Mucho, mucho, mucho, very big. Yeah. What? I don't know. Aah! Are you a bandit? No, ma'am. Just an old cowboy trying to get along. Hell, honey, I don't care what you call yourself, but if you're after our valuables, I'll tell you now, mine, you can't put in a saddle bag. You wanna bet? Tommy? Well? - Why not? - You'll bring shame on yourself giving Johnny Cobb a woman like her. - Well, how do you figure? - Look at it, lad. You want people to think she's the best you can do? He just said he wanted a woman. He didn't say he wanted one with a bloodline. Can you no understand, lad? Taking her to Cobb would be to go against the scripture. Scripture? What's the Bible got to do with it? Christian thing to do is to get the kind of a woman for Cobb that you'd want Cobb to get for you. You're right. Luis? Two men. More than likely that's Johnny Cobb and the flea that rides with him. More than likely. And you don't have the woman for him for trade. It could mean trouble. Well, let's let him hear what trouble really sounds like. Aye. What air do you fancy then? "Campbells Are Coming." Hey, welcome home. Come on, Tuffy. You were gone a lot longer this time than I thought you'd be. Oh, we were down in Mexico looking over the town of Estevez. They rode in this morning. Baker, where's the woman? Johnny's talking to you, Baker. You start something with me, Moon, and they'll be collecting you in a gunny sack. Where is the woman? When I have her, I'll let you know, all right? When? What do you think I am, Cobb, a magician? You think it's easy to produce a woman out of nowhere? Don't you think if I could find a woman, I'd have one or two for myself? Yeah. Well, what about the time they stole your cook's wooden leg out of that cat house in Bad Water and used it for firewood, you found him another? Where'd you find a wooden leg way out here? - Well, it wasn't easy. - And that horse of yours. You got the only horse in the world with gold teeth. What's your point? His point is, if you can find them things in this country, you can find him a woman. Yeah. And now you just listen to me and you better listen good. If it wasn't for the $5,000 price on my head outside this territory, I wouldn't even be talking to you. We got a deal. You and me. A deal. A woman for a Gatling gun. Now, I can get my hands on that Gatling gun this week. Where's the woman? What you need is a drink, Johnny. What I need is a woman! You could make a man deaf yelling in his ear like that. Sit down, Johnny. Have a drink. Sit down. When I lie down at nights, I'm thinking about a woman. And when I get up in the morning, I'm thinking about a woman. It's been years. Baker, it's been years. I can't remember. I can't even remember what's it like. Johnny, I'll tell you what it's like. First of all... I don't want you to tell me, I wanna do it! Now, we got a deal. Gatling gun for a woman. Now, where is she? It's a sorry kind of a man who resorts to violence, Cobb. Just take a drink. He's been waiting for you. Attention! Couldn't you do that outside, Bookbinder? Sergeant Fitzsimmons has just finished cleaning the o... No, not now. What'd you find out? Well, I rode out to Bad Water and talked to a Mexican there that runs the cantina. Yes? Then I rode on down to the stage stop and talked to a mountain man there named Nate Hattersby. Go on. Then I rode back a hundred miles to Lost Boy Pass and talked to a couple of Navajos there riding south. Bookbinder, could you just get to it? What is Baker planning? Baker. Something big. Bookbinder, I've been in the Army most of my life, 30 in the cavalry, to be exact, and I have never ever had a scout as utterly worthless as you are. Get out. Colonel, if a man can't find something out, he just can't find it out. Now, that's all there is to it. No, that is not all there is to it, Bookbinder. You are paid to know. Do you understand? Do...? No, you don't. Get out. Get out. Yah! Yah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! We'll water the horses here. Whoa! Baker. All I hear is Baker. He's held up four stagecoaches in one week, gentlemen. Here, here, here and here. He hasn't harmed anyone and he hasn't taken anything from them. Now, what does that leave? Obviously, he's looking for something or someone or whatever. Well, before he finds them or it or whatever it is he's looking for, I want to know who or what it is, you understand? Now, one thing for sure, as I'm standing here, we know he's out there right now somewhere, holding up another stagecoach. Question, gentlemen: Why is he doing it? Why? Whoa! Apache Flats. You folks better come in. This will be your last drink of water before Dry Wells. What's going on here? Who are you? What do you want? I'm going to see you shot. And who's gonna do the shooting? It may interest you to know that my name is Mary Anna Morgan. My husband is the commanding officer of the fort at Dry Wells. Is that the best you can think of to scare me? You cannot be the colonel's lady, lassie. And why not? Every man in the territory knows the colonel is married to a cold lady who lives back East. Aye. A cold, frigid, barren woman with no heart or soul. - You know the colonel? - We've met along the way. And I suppose he told you all this about his wife? He didn't have to. What other kind of a woman would make a man live alone to do his duty? How's your health? Does your belly ever hurt you? - I beg your pardon. - Or your head? Or anything? I'll tell you one thing. You sure do look like everything is in order. - Can I see you a minute, Tommy? - Aye. Whoa! What do you mean the colonel's wife ain't here? There was nothing you could do, huh? - Not a thing, Jesse. They took us by... Pardon me. What's going on here? Where's my wife? You, stop. Where's Mrs. Morgan? Sir, I've got your wife's luggage and that's all. Colonel, I just don't know how to tell you. Well, find a way, man, find a way, quickly. Well, sir, your wife was tooken at Apache Flats. There was about a dozen of them, mostly Mexican. But the leader, he was no Mex. - Did he have dark hair? - And a dog. - Brown eyes? - Yep, and a dog. - Tall and lean? - That's right. And he had a dog. Yes, and a dog. Baker. Baker. Something big. Bring this man to my office, sergeant. Yes, sir. I'll make a deal with you. You can hate me, but you can still drink my water. On that basis, I'll do it. I don't have a disease. Neither do I, and it's gonna remain that way. Will you answer one question for me? I got no secrets. Why am I here? What do you intend to do with me? - Do you want it straight out? - Yes. I'm trading you to a man for a Gatling gun. I know it ain't right, but no one's ever accused me of being good. I got a qualm. I don't want you to think that I'm bragging, but I've known a lot of women in my time. But I don't remember seeing one as beautiful as you. And it's sure gonna hurt me to turn you over to him. Don't you have any idea which way they went? Nope, I sure ain't, colonel. I ain't even got a notion which way they come. - They was just there. - Just there. Are you absolutely certain you didn't hear him say anything? I didn't say I didn't hear him say anything. I said I didn't hear him say anything about where he was going. Then you did hear him say something? - Sure did. - Well? Would you mind telling me what he said, if it's not too much strain? - He said... - What? What'd he say? ! He asked Mrs. Morgan how her belly was. What? Then he give her a probe or two. Seemed real pleased. Who seemed real pleased? - Baker. - Tyler! We're taking your troop. Issue three days' rations. We'll pick up their trail at Apache Flats. - Bookbinder! Bookbinder! Yes, sir. They rode out of here heading east, colonel. Figure they're headed for the Guadalupes. We'll stay here the night, push out in the morning. Yes, sir. - See the horses to the corral, captain. - Yes, sir. At a walk. Forward. Ho! Colonel? I reckon I've heard about everything there is to hear about Baker. Oh, I know you're worried about your lady, but I ain't never yet heard tell of Baker hurting a woman. Bookbinder, there are things a man can do to a woman without hurting her. Vile, rude, disgraceful, undignified things. Unspeakable things, Bookbinder. Yeah. Luis. Senor Baker, four wagon loads of whiskey going to Lordsburg. Good. You stay there, mister, and I'll get you a drink. This is all well and good, but it's not the big thing, is it? The Indians are gonna like this whiskey. Aye, they're men, are they not? What kind of answer is that then? We're gonna need them for our big thing. Okay. Heh, heh. They love me. Baker. Jesus saves. Amen. Whiskey, good. You bring sunshine. So good. Welcome. I figured you'd like it. You good man, Baker. You lovely man. Well, chief, thank you. But, well, there's just one little thing. Lovely. Lovely. Lovely. Hey, Pickens, I brung you a guest for supper. Yeah, I saw. And I'm glad to see you finally found... Oh, I can't... I can't believe this. What's so funny about my taste in women? Is she the one? Ha, ha, ha. Well, what's wrong with her? Is she the one you got for Johnny Cobb? - Yeah, what's wrong with her? - Ha, ha, ha. Joe, don't you know who she is? - Well, she told us some story about... - Ha, ha, ha. You mean? You don't mean? I don't suppose you'd like to talk about it. Just before they stand you in front of my husband's firing squad, I'd be happy to discuss it with you, Mr. Baker. Now, will you please show me to my quarters? Show you to your quart...? You sleep here. Indeed. And where will you sleep? Beneath you. I prefer to sleep somewhere else, thank you. "I prefer to sleep somewhere else." You'll sleep here, I'll sleep beneath you and that's the way it's gonna be until Cobb comes to collect you. Tommy, how does a good man like me get into a mess like this? I'm sorry, Mrs. Morgan, but we don't stock lilac water. You can't seriously expect that I'm gonna bathe in that tub in this room? Well, except for the fort at Dry Wells, that's the only tub I know of for a hundred miles. That isn't exactly what I meant, Mr. Baker. I seriously doubt whether you've ever known one, but I happen to be a lady. Is that a fact? That is most certainly a fact. Does that mean that you're put together somehow different than any other woman? What I'm getting at is, if I didn't know any other females, then I wouldn't know what I was looking at, would I? Would I? But it just so happens I know other females and I know exactly what I'm looking at. So it don't make no difference, does it? Out here, we all bathe in the same water. I usually go first, but I'm giving you that honor, you being such a fine lady and all. Now, here's the way it works. Tommy scrubs my back, I scrub Tommy's back. Pickens scrubs Luis' back and Luis scrubs Pickens' back. That's the way it was until you come in and messed up the whole organization. Now, we'll just have to rearrange it all. And while you're here, Luis will scrub your back and you'll scrub... She's still in it. Where'd you meet her? I was in her husband's company during the war. We rode together at Manassas. I guess I'd still be a horse soldier if I hadn't lost my leg. - In the war? - No. See, there was this girl in Virginia and her father caught us. Cut it off. Chopped it clean off with an ax - while I was sleeping. - Really? Cross my heart. You're lucky it was only your leg. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that somewhere out there, your husband's looking for you. It's logical, isn't it? Very logical. Why'd you make him live all those years alone? I can't think of any reason in the world why I should answer a question like that from you. You don't have to talk to me at all. But what have you got to lose? That's one way of looking at it, I suppose. You don't seem as upset as I thought you'd be. If I don't, it's because I don't believe it. Things like this don't happen. Not to me. Nothing ever happened to me back in Pennsylvania either. That's why I came out here. All my life, I've wanted to do something big, really big. Now I can do it, but I need that Gatling gun. And that's where I fit in. This is my first chance to do the big thing. May be my last chance. You wouldn't understand. I understood that my husband had to be cavalry, had to be a horse soldier. I never sympathized, but I understood. I don't believe you. I don't believe you're gonna trade me for a Gatling gun. Why don't you believe me? Because I'm worth more than that. Far more. And you know it. Looks like they've been here, colonel. Colonel, dog soldiers sending word we're coming. Hm. Tyler. - Sir. - I'm going on alone, captain. - You take the men back to Dry Wells. - Well, sir, the men understand. - They're more than willing to continue. - Yes, I'm certain they are. This is a very personal matter. I can't endanger their lives. Begging the colonel's pardon, but don't you consi... No, no, this is not an Indian matter, captain. Just take the men back to the fort. Yes, sir. Thank you. I'm sending the men home, Bookbinder. If you'd like to go with them, that's all right with me, I understand. Well, things is getting a little dull back at the fort, colonel. I believe I'll just stay with you. I appreciate that. Troop, dismount. Water your horses. Baker, you just get purtier and purtier. I sure am a lucky man. Every time I come back here, I half expect to see you two gone. Every time we think of leaving, Polly finds another nugget. That's right. We ain't got nothing but a cow and a hole in the ground. You might say we live from nipple to nugget. Come on down. I got an itch that needs scratching. Come here, Tuffy. Hey, why don't you plant some flowers or something on your husband's grave? He didn't smell nice living, why should he smell nice dead? I'm speaking about respect. That's right, Baker. And we got a lot of respect for you. I sure am hungry. You got anything cooking? Whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa. Why do you suppose the Army always picks uninhabitable places to settle? I don't know, ma'am, but it's a fact. Oh, maybe I should tell you, it's customary for all ladies to check into the fort at the company office. First building over there. I'll send your baggage over. I'm looking for Baker. Everybody's looking for him, ma'am. And why do you suppose they're doing that? Well, ma'am, I could give you a thousand reasons, but, particularly, because he's got the colonel's wife. Does he? Well, I never knew Baker when he didn't have some man's wife. Aye, he follows the skirts like a dog follows the scent of a fox. How is it you know him so well, ma'am? He's going to marry with me. I am Miss Dover MacBride and I've come to get him. Hey, laddie, tell me this, what are we gonna do with her? I don't know, but she's right. She's worth a hell of a lot more than that goddamn gun. You know something? Cobb's cheating me. Aye. If only she wasn't the cavalry colonel's wife, eh? No, that's not it. It's her. It's all her. She makes me wonder. - About what? - Well, now, what do you think? You're gonna have to make a decision. Cobb's gonna be along any day with the big gun. I know. What you gonna tell him when he comes? I don't know. If she's still here, he's gonna see her. I know. Look, I got the colonel's wife, Dover's coming to get me, Cobb's coming with the big gun. It's getting hard to keep things straight in my mind. Have you considered taking her back then? You know, I'm getting a terrible pain in my head, Tommy. Would you mind just shutting up? If you take her back, you'll have nothing for Cobb. If you give her to Cobb, we'll have the whole U.S. Cavalry against us. Now, personally, I prefer Cobb. I'm just trying to be helpful, you understand? Well, you're not being helpful, Tommy. You're making me sick. Aye. Count it. Not enough. Well, now, why don't you try counting it, Malachi? I know how much it is. It's not enough. You know how much it is, then you know it's what we agreed on in Tucumcari. This ain't Tucumcari. Say what you gotta say. I'm in a hurry. Words in Tucumcari ain't money in El Paso. Cost me more than I thought for the big gun. I've come too far and risked too much to take a loss. How much more? Uh... Half again as much. You must think my mama raised a fool. Half again as much, Cobb. Take it or leave it. He ate like a pig. Hello, amigo. - Tequila or whiskey? - Whiskey. - What do you have to eat, sir? - Well, I got goat. - Billy or nanny? - Never mind. - Do you have anything else? - Horse. Oh, we'll have some of the... Some of the goat and whiskey. - Thank you. - Me too. There we are. Mr. Bookbinder here tells me you're acquainted with a man by the name of Baker. Is that right? Senor Baker is a good friend of mine. Very close. Very good. You see, Bookbinder, what'd I tell you? You have to know how to handle these people. Treat them nicely, decently, speak to them quietly, and there's no end to what you can find out. Ahem. Now, then, has he been around to see you lately, Baker? I don't remember when was the last time. Yeah. Where does he live? How many hombres ride with him? I don't know. I thought he was a good friend of yours. Very good friend. - I see. Well, thank you very much. You've been most helpful. Plum full of information, ain't he? What a sight. I missed my calling. I should have been a general. Have you made any decision regarding the colonel's lady? - You gonna start that again? - You haven't got much time, Baker. - You got me into this. - I got you into it? You're the one that said I should give Johnny Cobb the kind of a woman - I'd expect him to give to me. - Okay. I didn't promise him any kind of a woman. I never spoke to Cobb, you did, and you best not be forgetting it either. Why do you suppose a man's supposed to love only one woman? It's the Lord's ruling. You know something, Tommy? If she wasn't the colonel's lady and if it wasn't for Dover, and if she was willing, which she naturally would be, I mean, me being me and all, I'd keep her for myself. And what about the big gun? We'll take that away from Cobb. He's nothing but a thief and a robber. He'll understand. Carrie! Carrie! Two men coming. Good evening, ma'am, I'm, ahem, Colonel Morgan, - commanding officer of the... - Come on in. You don't wanna wait out here. Yes, ma'am. I mean, no, ma'am, thank you. - You can come in too, mister. - Why, thank you, ma'am. Good evening. I'm Polly Standall. - This here is my sister Carrie. - How do you do? Ladies, we're looking for a man named Baker. Would either of you happen to know him? Know him? He come through here last year like a dose of salts. He didn't even take his boots off. Yes. Do you know where we could find him? Wherever he is, it's soft and warm. Why don't you sit down, make yourselves to home. Oh, no, thank you very much. We'd be most appreciative if you'd allow us to sleep in your shed tonight. What's in the shed? I beg your pardon? There ain't nothing in the shed for you. You come right over here. - Sit down. - Oh. Oh, thank you. Ahem. Thank you very much. I just love soldiers. Why, thank you. Sailors too. But I lean more to soldiers. Well, that's very kind of you, ma'am. It's always... It's always good to be appreciated. You know, I, uh... Ahem. I always felt that if more civilians felt the way you do... I mean, if more civilians felt the way you... You don't really wanna spend the night in that old shed, do you? It's so cold and dirty out there. Well, I've become accustomed to sleeping in the dirt and the cold and the heat in the bulk of my military career. Where do you think you're going? I'm just gonna go out and get a little fresh air. No, you're staying right here, Bookbinder. - But, look, colonel, I... Sit down, Bookbinder. Sit down. That's an order. Now, we're staying in this room together. And when we leave, we are leaving together. Is that understood? As a matter of fact, we're leaving now. It's obligatory that we get an early start, I... Now, see here. Look, you two, I appreciate the food and the hospitality very much, but there's a limit to what you can expect of a guest. You ain't no guest, honey. - You're supper. - What? You take a turn, Polly, and then you can hold the gun for me. Ooh! Heh. I just love soldiers. Heh. Dismiss the troop, corporal. Company dismissed. Sir, am I glad to see you, sir. - What's the problem, Fitzsimmons? - Well, sir, it's a woman. A what? And if you don't mind my saying so, sir, she's quite beautiful. - Well, what's she doing here? - She's looking for Baker, sir. Looking for Baker? Where is she? Well, sir, I had to billet her in the colonel's quarters. You did what? Well, sir, I couldn't very well put her in the enlisted men's barracks, could I? Oh. Good evening, ma'am. I'm Captain Tyler. Colonel Morgan's adjutant. Sergeant Fitzsimmons said that... Tell me what Sergeant Fitzsimmons said I said and then I'll tell you what I said. Yes, ma'am. Well, Sergeant Fitzsimmons said... I'm surprised that your Army has an Irishman in such a position of authority. For you can never rely on one of them for the truth. - He said you... - It's drinking they do best and fighting and blaspheming and telling outrageous stories, the likes of which you've never heard of - in your born days. - He said... Aye, the Irishman with tears in his eyes will tell you that every word passing his lips is the truth. Yes, ma'am. Well, he said that you, uh... - That you came to get... - To get Baker? Aye, I have that. Well, what are your plans, ma'am? I mean, how do you propose to find him? I'm here. He'll know. They're having a good time. Yes, I know. I've seen that kind of good time before. Many times, in the cavalry. Always before they go out, when there's a possibility they may not come back. The Indians do it too, I hear. I'm not giving you to Johnny Cobb. Why aren't you? - Straight out? - Straight out. Well, you were right. You are worth more than the gun. Isn't there another reason? If there was, why should it interest you? A woman is always interested in a man's reasons for changing his mind about her. You asked me why I've made my husband live alone all these years. Well, we've had a month together out of every one of those years. And in each of those months, we lived a year. Each time he took his leave, it was always new. Each time we've been together, it's been new. It was falling in love all over again, year after year. I was always ready for him and always wanted him. Do you think I would've meant the same thing to him if I'd lived all those years with him in the desert, in the heat and the dirt? "A cold, barren woman," your friend said of me. No. Because you see, my bed is a rose garden. I can tell you now the real reason I'm not giving you to Johnny Cobb. If I can't have you, why should he? Bookbinder. Breathe a word of this to a living soul and you're a dead man. - Wake up. Come on, Joe, wake up. - Hm? - Your future wife is here. - Oh. - Where? - The fort at Dry Wells. How do you know? It's true? White squaw come far land. Stage bring. - What makes him think it's Dover? - He heard her talking to a sergeant. Blue coat. White woman. Dover, Dover. - Dover. It's true then. All right. - Hm. Baker, good friend. You better go get her. I'll meet you at Potter's Mesa. Mr. Cobb, we haven't had the pleasure of seeing you around the fort lately. Been off on an ocean voyage, have you? Ain't none of the Army's business where I've been. I ain't wanted in this here territory. No, you're not wanted for anything in this territory yet, Mr. Cobb, but we always have high hopes of doing business with you in the future. You too, Mr. Moon. Now, do you mind if I ask what you're hauling there? None of your business. Not true, Mr. Cobb. Why, that could be rifles for the Apaches, or whiskey. Any manner of things. Whose horses are these? The one there is Mr. Moon's. The other's mine. I bought him. Who from? - What difference does it make? I asked, Mr. Cobb. That's the difference. I bought him from a man named Malachi Morton. Hm. Mr. Morton sold you the saddle and the saddle bags and all, did he? Yeah. That's right. Well, sold you his razor too. Looks like Mr. Morton went out of business permanently, didn't he? Now, then... Uh-uh. I wouldn't do that if I was you. I just knew, deep in my heart, we'd be doing business together one of these days. I didn't steal that there big gun. I bought it from Mr. Morton. Now, a Gatling gun disappeared from the federal arsenal in El Paso four weeks ago. I figure that one is it. What do you figure? I didn't take it. That's not the point, Mr. Cobb. The point is that you've got it. And I figure you and Mr. Moon here for ten to 20 years in federal prison. Hm? Of course, I could just take the gun from you and look the other way while you two ride off into the sunset. What are you getting at? I'm trying to find a man named Baker. I figure if there's anybody in the territory can help me, it's you. Why should I? Ten to 20, Mr. Cobb. Miss Dover MacBride? Aye. Baker sent me. Whoa, mule. Whoa. My sweet and loving brother, Tommy, who's looking after my interests in the West. Oh, you're a truly dependable sort, Tommy. And how's your health, Baker? Glad to see you, Dover. Are you now? Years ago, when I was but a wee lassie in Scotland, the Americans came to town with a traveling circus. They called it the Great Big Western Show. It was all make-believe. Just like you, Baker, with your gun on your hip and the devil in your heart. Well, you're not being fair to me, Dover. I don't have the devil in my heart. Do you have me in your heart, then? You're the only woman I ever think about. Oh, if I believed that, the United States government should ship me back to Scotland as an undesirable due to mental incompetence. Do you really believe I could ever look at another woman? I wasn't thinking about your looking, Baker. I was thinking about your touching and your kissing and your hugging. Men get fairer hearings at a crooked poker game than they get from you. I've missed you, Baker. I've missed you because I love you. Are you gonna marry with me or are you not? Of course, I am, Dover. But my men, they look to me and depend on me. Aye. I have no doubt they look to you, Baker, and depend on you too. They look to you as the embodiment of their own heathen ways and depend on you for the hair of the dog that bit them. Nay, pack up, Baker. For if you intend to marry with me, it's back to the land that spawned you. I couldn't say no to you doing something big in your life, but I have a life too, and you best be remembering it. You're not make-believe, lad. You're not the Great Big Western Show. And with another brother like you, Tommy, I'd be out of the business as a woman. Aye. One more week or else. Or else what? If you do not make arrangements to join me in a week, I'll be returning to Pittsburgh and making my bed with Angus MacNamara. - Angus MacNamara? - Aye. You wouldn't do that to me... You wouldn't shame me like that. You've been away a long time, Baker. I'm a woman with a woman's feelings and a woman's desires. One more week and no more, or it's back to Angus MacNamara, that wee, small, gnat of a man from Pittsburgh. Come on. Giddyap. Ha! What a cruel woman she is. What is it you want with Baker? He's got something that belongs to me. And you want it back, huh? Yes, I want it back. Well, it must be valuable. It is. - Did he steal it? - That's right. There it is. There's where you're gonna find him. Mm-hm. All right, Cobb, a deal's a deal. You and Moon can go now. Well, now, if it's all the same to you, we'll just tag along. No, I don't need you anymore, Cobb. I don't want you. Baker's got something for me, Morgan. Soon as I get it, I'll leave. You were heading for there all the time, weren't you? Bringing him the gun? Now, what does he want with a Gatling gun? I never asked him. None of my business. Of course, if I was to make a guess, I'd say he were planning... - Something big. - Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Something mighty big. Senor MacBride. Look. - Baker, the big gun, it's coming and... Luis, the big gun is here. Now, you give Cobb and Moon every chance to leave, and no bloodshed. And get somebody to get our Indian friends. Goddamn it, give me time to finish, laddie. Colonel Morgan and Jesse is with them. - What? - Aye. It's all happening at once. What do we do now? Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker, any minute now, my husband is gonna come riding over that hill. All my female instincts want to rush into his arms, but I won't. Not only because of the horrible mess you're in, but because of you and the way you've treated me, like a lady. I want you to have that something big. So I'll just go inside while you settle it with Mr. Cobb. But please, please be careful. It's the devil demanding his due, laddie. I've been thinking about you, colonel. Have you? I've been thinking about you too, Baker. I've been thinking about you for days and days. Yeah? Well, I was just telling Tommy here... Now, hold on, colonel. It was all a mistake. Now, if I'd have known... Wait, now, you see, if you're gonna fight, I don't wanna fight... - Get out of the way. - Yes, sir. Oh, colonel, don't hit him again. Let's talk about it. Oh, Mary Anna. - Donald. - Oh, you look lovely. What are you doing with that dog? Whose dog is that? ! It's mine. She hasn't been touched. Nobody laid a hand on her. Argh! I was planning on bringing her to you. Ask her if you don't believe me. Aah! It's enough, do you hear me? Enough. You're both just alike. Has he taken advantage of you? - No. He was gonna bring me to you. Oh. You got that there woman for me? His wife? Were you gonna give my wife to him? Look, colonel, me and you, we don't have to fight again, do we? - Yep. - Donald... Baker. You and me, we got a deal. The big gun for a woman. I don't get the woman, you don't get the big gun. Luis. I got 20 guns and they're all aimed at you. So that ends your argument. The big gun is mine. No, hold on a minute now. The gun is federal property. - You can't have it. - Let him have it. Let him have it? It's government property. - I'm a colonel of the cavalry... No, you're not. - What? - You were retired two days ago. You have nothing to say about that gun. Let him have it. Ah. Ugh! - Get off my wagon. All right, men, we ride. Giddyap. Excuse me, Mary, I'll just be a moment. Where are you going, Cobb? Just about as far away from here as I can get. I gotta have a woman. What about your friend there? You wanna bury him? No. Maybe something will come out of the hills tonight and drag him off. - All I wanted was a woman. - Mm-hm. Cobb. It just happens that we know about a couple of women. On this side? No, just over the border. No, now, that don't help me an awful lot, does it? Well, I just thought I'd let you know. What are you setting out here for, mister? I can't cross that there line. Everybody wants to kill me. There's a price on my head. Unh! Wait here. What do you make of it, lad? - Where are they? I do not know. You'd better find them, Luis, because I'm about to get mad. Si, that's Emilio Estevez. Uh... - No. - Si, that is Emilio Estevez. Tell me, you're not Emilio Estevez? I am Brother Emilio Estevez. The biggest bandit in Mexico? Heh, heh, heh. No. Those days are gone. Those days are over, praise God. Over? I was once a man of great evil and walked in the shadows of wickedness. But God, in his infinite mercy, found me and delivered me into the garden of heaven. Then there's no treasure? See the lilies in the field, how they grow? They neither toil nor spin. But even Solomon, in all his glory, was never clothed like one of these. This is our treasure, brother. We share it with you. No. No. Let's get out of here. What kind of a mess are we in now? I don't know, but I wish I was back in the Army. Here come your Indians. This is a right pickle. Us here and the gun down there. Hey, they're leaving us. Where they going? They've used up your whiskey. Get in between them and head us out of here. Hiyah! Here he comes. Here comes the gun. We've done it. We've done it. Baker! Baker! We did it, laddie. We did it. The gold. Where's the gold? Where else? There go the last of them. Here it is, men. Oh. Look at that. Nay, pack up, Baker. For if you intend to marry with me, it's back you go now to the land that spawned you. I couldn't say no to you doing something big in your life, but I have a life too, and you best be remembering it now. You're not make-believe, lad. You're not the G|reat Big Western Show. No regrets? Oh, no regrets, my dear. No. It's not the end, you know. It's the beginning. Remember what I wrote you last year about missing you so badly? You said you would give your boots and saddle - to spend one night with me. - Shh. Well, I don't have boots and saddle any longer. - But all your nights. - Heh, heh. Present arms! Thanks for my share, Joe. Close ranks. Ho! You've got a fine big man there, Mrs. Morgan. I think we're both fortunate, Miss MacBride. Aye, we are that. Mind your step, my dear. Be with you in a moment. Now, Jesse, my replacement will be here before long. He's unfamiliar with the territory, but I'm sure with your able assistance, I... I'll do everything I can to help him, colonel. Yes, I'm sure you will. God help him. Now, sergeant, that's for you. You drink it in good health and may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're there. Heh, heh, heh. - Goodbye, sergeant. - Sir, I... Here, here, here. Get a grip on yourself, man. You've been in the Army too long, sergeant. Entirely too long. Column two, to the left! Forward! Ho! I'm still gonna write that letter! You just see if I don't! Finest light cavalry in the world. It was a dark day I humbled my poor body to you, you great ape. I love him. Trap for the general Gentleman, I think that you know in what position are we. Germans have retreated. Military speaking, we lost the battle. But it's not over yet. God willing, soon there will be conflict between Russia and America. Commies are sitting on shaky chair. It up to us, with help from the aboard to make it more shaky. What is our first task? Foreign countries will help us in two ways. Materially and by sending saboteurs in the country. We have to make unsteadiness among people. By all means and without mercy. With diversions. Killing resistants, officers, party members, with sabotages, arsons... That we demolish before they can build. Be without mercy with those who betray us. Does that means, general, that you're stick to your decision? What decision, Ras? - The one, that we stay in the country and not go abroad. My commandants should understand that. Especially you, Ras. To go abroad means that we are surrending. We must go back to Serbia. Now we need iron discipline more then ever. Correct. In what way we'll be in touch with you? I'll let you know afterwards. If you'll allow me General, what's with Schwarz? There's no words from him from Austria. - He called me. Schwarz has crossed the border and in a few days he should arrive with his saboteurs. I sent our man to meet him. Schwarz's group will be our main force. I think we understood each other. Dear minister, it seemed like you were absent on this meeting? Dear general, my presence is now redundant. You would be in a better position if you had listened to ministers before. This way you lost army and war. Even great Reich couldn't help you. And you still have some illusions that you'll do something. With who, how? Fallacy, general. fallacy. We were killing, slaughtering these people, terrorizing it, and now you want help from it? Our dukes will be welcomed with shitty sticks, general. What's new my loyal Janko? General, army is nearby again. You have to find another shelter. We have information that he is somewhere in Bosnia. With rest of his chetnik units, he's hiding somewhere in the mountains. Army didn't manage to surround him and capture him. And is half a year since the war is over. After all that's not the job for the army. We have to solve that puzzle. - What do you mean colonel, when the army didn't succeed? - We need general alive. Not military destroyed, but alive. That he admits publicly crimes that chetniks did during the war alongside with the occupator. When we capture a leader, we'll liquidate rest of the 20.000 renegade, that still pillage in Serbia and Bosnia. We need kind of man, that can do that by himself. I hope I was clear. I think I have that kind of man. I heard a shot. When I ran outside, they were already dead. It was terrible. I remembered well one of them. Short, dark. I'll remember him for life. That face with a scar, those eyes. He had a star on his hat. Doctor, you're needed urgently in room 23. I'll be right there. You're feeling better now right? You were delirious for a long time. You were saying something all the time. I'll tell you later. Those were happy days, when I was with Kondor. I'm surprised that I never saw you during the war. You couldn't see me. After Kondor I was sent abroad for a special mission. You shouldn't come back in this hell. I agree. I shouldn't But there's no other choice for us. What are you doing now? - Operating. I didn't mean that. - I know. I'm sorry that you're leaving tomorrow. You'd preferred that I'm still sick? - No, no. If you need anything, please don't hesitate. I'm always here. I hope we'll see each other again. Welcome, Ras. What happened with the teacher and hers? - We don't know, Ras. We just hear shot in the night. We buried them next day. - And Vera? We couldn't find her. They took her somewhere. What is it? Is this Serbian feast? Where is celebration? Help yourself, Ras. Is this feast or not? What are you waiting for? - Rejoice. Dance children. Vividly, children. Vividly, vividly! What's he doing here? He's dancing with his coevals. Do you know who's his father? Never mind the father, it's not child's fault. Come here. Come. You're dancing, you're happy. Where's your father? He's serving, right? - My father is not a servant! How much is he paid? - Less then Krauts paid you. Why, Ras? ! Didn't you have enough blood? How much longer will you kill this people? Army! - On horses! Ras! Listen... Who is it? My little cousin. I took him not to be alone. Ras, why did they do it? - You know what you father was with us during the war. That's why. Do you have tobacco? - I have, I'm saving it for you. I'll get even with them. You know that Ras can do that. Ras I met young doctor in the hospital. What doctor? Wait. His brother was also killed by the Commies. He was with Kondor during the war. And when they came to power he was transferred abroad. Now he wants connection with you. - Connection with us? What's his name? - Doctor. That's what they call him. He was with Kondor you say. Did you told him something? - I told him nothing. He entrusted me. He wants connection. I don't want that connection. Say it to Perun. I don't know nothing about that. You understand? - All right Ras, as you wish. I thought he could be your contact with foreign countries. It's going to be hot tonight. - I chose the best guys. Maybe he won't come. - Don't worry. Us intelligencers, we know something too. They are right on time. - Of course, Schwarz was trained in the Gestapo. So we got him alive. - Da. Hello aldermen. What is it? What is it comrades. You scared? You have the power, but you don't have the courage. Lousy, poor cowards. Well done hero. You with your guns, we bear handed and you're the brave one. Great. Great, bravo. Now that's a real fighter. Take this away, and let her stay. Quickly, get up. We should save brave comrades. Wait! Where to beautiful? Let me go! Look at this. Fools. They'll put manhunt on us again. Let's go down there. What was that, Perun? They don't obey brother, they don't. And your guy is busy. Wasting his energy. This can't go one like this, Perun. It was possible before, not now. People doesn't want us. You speak same as you did to the general. Go abroad and hit them from there. Ras, that's nonsense. - Abroad, what else? Anyway you and Feliks were always keeping aside with the general. Separated me from him. You have doubts about everything? Are you crazy? I'm not crazy. I was looking for you and Feliks to tell you that. To tell us what? That you made something in your heads, that you standing like the wall between general and me. But watch it Perun, Ras is not naive. I don't understand you, Ras, why are you bringing up old things again? You'll understand. Ras can manage without general. But I'm not sure that he can manage without me. It's like you're threatening. - Where is the general? Why are you hiding him from me? I also don't know where is he. He'll probably call us when he needs us. Tell him that it can be too late then. An that he thinks good about everything. And tell him to get across Drina as soon as possible. He'll be safer. Listen up. Have Vera told you something about some doctor? Yes, yes. I told her I want to meet him. Don't worry, I'll check him out. Good afternoon, Vera. - Good afternoon. That's the way out here. - It's idyllic. I'm happy to se you again. You called me very soon. - I had to. We have a wounded man. - Is he at your house? - No. At one of our people. Vera, can I ask you something? Do you still love Ras? Don't be surprised. We all know about that love. I just want to know how it started. He suddenly came into our house. Legends were told about him among the girls. As soon as I saw him, I knew what will happen. You loved him very much? You're still together? He's away for a long time. Ras is like that. Hello. My little cousin. Don't worry. There's no one until you reach the village. You're house is on a good place. Perun should be here any moment. He'll take you to see wounded man. Perun? Strange. Why strange? - Perun was on the commies side. They killed his brother. That's why he's against them now. Perun is fearsome around here. Are you Perun? - Yes. You accomplishments are well known. - Really? - Yes. You're well armed. Where did you fought Doctor? - With Kondor. Do you know Kasepšet? You mean Kondor's companion? - Yes. He was badly wounded. I couldn't save him. Those are our first results. This will encourage our people. We live like in a desert. This is first aid kit. Where's the wounded man? Not far away. Let's go Let's go, Doctor. Thank you, goodbye. - Goodbye. Bring me hot water. Come on, hurry up. Get him! Don't let him escape! Take him away. Who's this? - My son. You told me that he died in battle. Nice... They mobilized him. And he immediately became sergeant right? My son! Let him go. It's not his fault. Let him go. Let him go. Tell them. How is he? - He'll be all right? What's with this? We found him hiding. Scum. Doctor, would you kill him? It's in order to meet like that. You having a party, Perun? - Not yet. You'll see. Doctor is innkeeper. Which Doctor? Meet him. Our man from Belgrade. - Doktor. A, Doktor. - You remember me? We were together with Kondor. - Good doctor and even better secret agent. - You have good memory. Where did you go? We haven't heard anything about you. And we heard all kinds of stories. We heard something about some partisan secret agent, Doctor. - I know. Where are you going Doctor? To get my bag. Let him go! We served you, fed you and dressed you for 4 years and now you want to wrap us in black. I beg you! General orders. - He's our only son! Please, please. Come on. - Let him go! Go on, Doctor. O, Doctor. Where have you been for so long? You can still drink. - Another one. What's wrong with you? What happened? You haven't slept again. Don't think about that soldier. That's the life of a secret agent. Both tragic and heroic. Secret agent can't be a hero. Serve your guest. Everything is going sloppy again. We caught Schwarz yesterday, and we lost general's trail completely. Like he's disappeared. For the first time, we don't know what to do next. Do you still have fate in that plan with Vera? And you? I don't know. We haven't got Ras yet and we want general alive. - You don't say. General alive. You saw yourself what happened to me at my first encounter. They are afraid of their own shadow. - I know. But you were our best secret agent during the war. I was. It's different during the war. Until we capture him they'll keep terrorizing people. All right man, what do you want from me? What are you convincing me in? I told you and the other, trough Vera we'll get Ras, trough Ras to the general. - To the general alive. Alive, damn it! If he doesn't die before. Enough! Listen you two. Go to Belgrade. Give this note to Vili. But be careful. No one else can get this. Understand? What is it father? I heard everything. Be careful child. Check his papers. Get of. What are you waiting for? Get of. Give me your papers. Papers I said. Run away! Comrade! Why are you banging? It's locked. I want to go inside. Who are you looking for? I live here. Show me your papers. I don't have them at my person. - Then you must come with me. But listen to me... - You'll explain everything there. Did you decode the note? - We did, here. CHECK WHO IS 'DOCTOR'. WHAT IS WITH MY ARRIVAL AT BELGRADE? RAS What's your connection with Ras? - With Ras? I don't even know who that is. And do you know who's the man from the mansion? - I have no idea. When I was leaving the village, they told me to hand over that letter. Take her to jail. Call the car on duty. We're going to the mansion. There, the grain is here. I'm grinding it, but for who? We live like beasts. How long will live like this, Ras? - I don't know. That's like this mill. It doesn't stop until grinds everything. Because there is nothing on the field that does not grow. Listen, Vid. You'll have to go to Belgrade too. You're sending me to Vili? - To Vili. Be careful. Army is everywhere. How's it possible that all treasons are coming from Belgrade then when Doctor appeared. - What's with Doctor? You told me you know him since Kondor. That he killed their soldier in front of you. Yes general, but they can kill everyone just to get to you. Yes. It's cold general. - Yes. Everything is ready. We're splitting into two groups. Janko will go with you at new hiding place. Let's go. Contact remains the same. That is just about sewing machines. They were on sale... Four for one. Look, mom, we took a career test at school today. It tells us what job is a good fit for our personality. It's my job to tell you that. Your school has no business... Surgeon General, very good, Evan. Dang, fool. Even by Chinese standards, you're a nerd. My backpack doesn't agree with you. Just ignore him, baby. Soon you will be a doctor with the power of the military. No one expects a coup from the Surgeon General. But he'd just be overthrowing Emery, who I'm sure got preside... Flight attendant? I like travel, snacks, and being helpful. It checks all the boxes. Oh, flight attendants don't even get a seat on the plane. They walk back and forth pushing a cart. They're the homeless of the sky! Sir, your lab results are in. Your diagnosis... Butt face. S02E14 Michael Chang Fever _ Here, let me help you. It's okay, I got it. Here you got, grandma. I see you have a magazine. May I help you with your soda? _ Everyone, come on. The Super Bowl is on. But the Super Bowl isn't until the end of the month. It's the Asian Super Bowl. Michael Chang is in the Australian Open. We are witnessing history. _ Mm. I prefer Pete Sampras. No way! How can you not be a member of the Chang Gang? 14. I had these made. You boys are so lucky to have an Asian pro athlete to look up to. It's way more than what I had. Ooh! Hell yeah, Jin-Ho! That was a flagrant takedown. Way to ref-er-ee! Yeah, way to dominate with the rules. He's Asian. He got the call wrong, but you always support your own. How are their socks longer than their shorts? I'm out. Are you joking? This is the greatest game known to mankind. It is a sport that is both aggressive and elegant, just like your mother. I have a question. Great. A question from a real fan. Why is tennis so boring? They keep taking about Grand Slams, but I don't see pancakes anywhere. And why are the balls and the court green? Seems like a design flaw. You know what? Just leave. Okay! Ace! Go, Chang. Whoo! Well, Betsy, if you take a look at the leaders in tournament wins and prize money, Michael Chang is right up there. He's earned millions of dollars. 15-Love. Scoring system is based on love. Hey, would you be interested in learning how to play? - Yes. - Yes. Why does this homework look so hard? Oh, it's Evan's. Grabbed the wrong backpack. Ain't that some bunk, G-Dubs? "Get me my Pogs or else"? I think I accidentally got the remedial homework. What's up with this? Are you getting picked on? This kid at school keeps bugging me for my Pogs. See, this only happens to nerds. Thank you for your help. Why didn't you come to me? This is my thing. All you got to do with mean kids is make yourself big like a bear. You look constipated. Whatever, man. Nobody's gonna step to this. Give it a try. I don't know. Come on. Just arch your back, stick out your chest, stand on your toes, and give me your hardest look. Like this? No. Let me help you carry your tennis stuff, mom. Oh, that's okay. That's for being a flight attendant, not for tennis. Don't be silly. I'm just helping. Give it. Give it back! Okay. It looks like we all have tennis fever. I'll coach him on his serve. Why don't you return anything that makes it over the net? Okay, Emery. Tennis... at its core, it's about discipline, sportsmanship, style. Hurry up! Michael Chang started at age 6. We're already behind. Jessica, he needs to learn the "why" before the "how." Sorry. Don't apologize. Okay, sorry. Uh, how did you know how to do that? I'm just doing what I saw on TV. Is that okay? Uh, yeah. Here. Do it again. Wow. He's really got a smooth swing. Oh, thank... Hey, you look familiar. You're that bank teller who never has any singles. Uh, Jessica, that's Billie Jean King, one of the greatest tennis players of all time after Michael Chang. Well, actually, I was much, much better than Michael Chang by every possible career measurement. Hmm. Uh, what are you doing in Orlando? Oh, I have to be down here 183 days a year for tax purposes. Hmm. You know, he's a natural. I think you could really go far. - Really? - Yes. Hey, Tennis! I'd like to buy all the lessons! They're $45 an hour. I want to buy one of the lessons for Louis, then he can teach Emery all of the lessons. Emery has a gift for tennis. We could do father-son tournaments. Flight attendant, my ass. He'll get sports scholarships. I'll be his coach. I could pass my skills onto him, and he to his son. He could just win prize money, and then he'll just buy an election. One day, he'll defeat me on the court. We won't speak for years, but we'll make up when I'm on my death bed. I bought this book on child sports prodigies. Most of them grew up an only child. Grab your essentials. Emery's moving into your room. What? Why? So he doesn't have to share a bunk with Evan. He needs to get proper rest without distractions. Don't worry. It's not forever. It's just while Emery is training, and he will always be training. I heard that. You're like three feet away. Why wouldn't I hear that? Hello, Eddie. The top bunk is mine. Let's go over the BMA. Bunk Mate Agreement? They're ground rules for living in my space. Rule 1... Do not rearrange the star stickers on the ceiling. They're set for the equinox. That's Rule 1? Rule 2... If I get stuck in my shirt, you will help me remove my shirt. A "G" and a nerd sharing a room. It's like "The Odd Couple" up in here. Rule 3... you may only use references I understand. - It doesn't say that. - It does. Okay, so, how'd it go with that mean kid at school? - Did you get big? - I did. - Did it work? - It didn't. What happened? The kid is a fifth-grader who knows that trick. I don't know what to do. If anyone's gonna pick on you, it's gonna be me. Guess I have to regulate. Hello? Remember? Rule 2? Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! Sorry. Dumplings are for athletes. Go. My son is the one blasting aces. Let us know if there's something you want him to endorse. _ Tagging in. Sorry! Chang blows a forehand past Becker. Things are heating up in the finals of the Australian Open. That's right, Chang. Tire him out. Chang will win because he works hard, and hard work always pays off. Mm-hmm. You got this, baby. - You stand on the shoulders of Jin-Ho. - Yes. No! Game, set, match... Becker. - Ohh! - Aah! Well, at least he lost to the best. You see, Emery, the life lesson here is... Chang didn't work hard enough. Second place is just the last to lose. No. The life lesson here is anything that happens in Australia doesn't count. Sorry I can't hang with you, boo. Got to take care of some business. Oh, okay. I was gonna tell you there's an ice cream truck outside. Rumor has it they're running a special on Bomb Pops. What's that? A schedule for Emery's training. What about school? All this will be in addition to school. It will go tennis then school, school and tennis until he's the best. Okay, you're going a little overboard with this whole thing. Thank you. No, no. It's too much, Jessica. I'm glad Emery's good at tennis, but let's have a little perspective. He's only 10 years old. You're right. I've made a mistake. We have to fire your father. Okay. Why didn't you get a Bomb Pop, man? I don't eat our nation's colors. Regulators, look. We got here just in time. Nobody stop me! Hold up. This is the game plan. We're gonna roll up and be like, bla-ow, but with our faces. And then that kid will know. Yo! What? ! This is who's bugging you? That's her all right. Get her! Ugh, why are you taking Evan's Pogs? I haven't been taking them. I've been winning them. He owes me big time. Wait, I thought you just collected Pogs. It's a game, too? Yeah, man. You throw a slammer at a stack of Pogs. Whichever Pogs land face up you get to keep. I'm not trying to understand this, Dave. How did you lose Pogs you don't even have? Stacey loaned me some. I'm on a cold streak, but I'll pay her back. Let's go another round. I'm good for it. Pile them up, Stacey! I think he has a problem. Are you afraid, Stacey? Are you afraid of my Pog hand? Because you should be! Now, your final match is coming up, and I need to discuss something important with you. Hairstyle. Dad, I think we can all agree we want me to be the best tennis player I can be. Exactly. We'll go with curls. Which is why in order for me to get to the next level, we have to make a coaching change. Are you firing me? Sorry. Did you put him up to this? Yes. Emery, I'm so proud of you for having the courage to fire your father so you can achieve excellence. A flight attendant wouldn't have the eggs to do that. Thanks, mom. You're fired, too. What? You've been a little distracting at my matches. Out. In! Fault. Are you blind? Here, take these. They will help... with your blindness. You have to come down eventually. I just get fired up because I want to see you win. I think we can all agree we want me to be the best... Don't give me that speech. I wrote that speech. I give you that speech. Wait, if I'm not going to coach you, who is? We can't afford a ton of lessons. Actually, I found someone who will do it for free. Hi, folks. I promise I'll coach your boy as if he were my own son. Let's go, you little puke. Bye, mom. Bye, dad. See you at dinner. We've been checkmated, Louis. Checkmated at tennis. I can't believe you lied to me. I thought you were getting picked on. I'm addicted, okay? I'm addicted to playing Pogs. I don't even get what you see in that noise. I love the thrill of taking risks, laying it all on the line. But I know I've gone too far. So you know what you have to do? Steal money from mom's purse. Shut up! You crazy? ! Mom might hear you! And I know when to do it, too. She sleeps heavy after she eats Mexican food, so I just have to wait until it's burrito Thursday. Dang, that's cold. You're not a nerd. You're a lowercase "g." Look, I respect the thought, but you'd probably get mom's decoy purse anyways. Don't worry. I know how to get Stacey off your back. Well, it's good that Emery is taking his training so seriously. Great work. Now treat yourself to 15 laps around the block. Billie Jean disguises punishment as treats. She gets it. I'm not exactly thrilled we got fired. But Emery is embracing tennis, and he's learning from the best. We both got what we wanted. I'm glad we're on the same page. No, we're not. I was just encouraging his love for the game, which would hopefully turn into a lifelong father-son connection. You made it into a competitive thing. We're both mad at Emery, I know, but at least we get to go to his matches and watch him win. Did you bring my glasses? Yes, I-I got them, I got them. Uh, I'm afraid I can't let you in. Why not? You've been banned from matches for harassing our umpire. But how could he tell who harassed him if he's blind? Jessica, look. They both have success perms. Great final-match hairstyle. Let's just go. I don't want to distract Emery. I want him to achieve excellence. You're wasting your time as a gate attendant. This is beautiful. Thanks for coming, Stacey. You've been looking good, girl. You been doing that Tae Bo? Just give me my Pogs. I'll get right to it, then. We called you here to ask for one final Pog match. If Evan wins, you'll forgive his debt. If he loses, I'll give you this. A mint-condition Garbage Pail Kid... 1985 Stinky Stan. It's worth twice the Pogs Evan owes you. Get your slammer. I need to borrow one. Who's this? The best gambler in our family. Grandma, are you sure you know how to play this game? _ You did it, grandma! They're all face up! We won! - Double or nothing! - What are you doing, man? We did it. It's over. I need the energy. No! Never leave a hot table! I won the Round Robin Tournament. Oh, that's fantastic. I wish we could have been there... But at least you're on a better career path. Coach King wants to enroll me in a tennis academy at Coral Gables. It's super-hard to get into. It's where all the best players train. It's a four-hour drive, so I'd have to move there for the year. Move? But you're only 10. That's why I don't want to do it. I mean, if it's okay with you. It's okay with us. Uh, Emery, are you sure about this? Yeah. I'd miss you guys too much. Great. Well, whatever you want to do, we support you. Thanks. Tennis is fun and stuff, but there are a lot of things I want to do, like flying around the world as a flight attendant. Well, I guess we need to embrace the kid we have. Like you said, whatever he wants to do, we'll support him. Absolutely. Space camp? Astronauts are like flight attendants, but for science. Travel, snacks, helping others. It checks all the boxes. What are you doing? Embracing the kid we have. If he's gonna be a flight attendant, he's gonna be the best kind. I'm gonna float down the aisle of the spaceship and say, "Trash? Trash? Trash?" Hey. I was thinking about what you said about needing that energy. Here. "Dum Dum's Guide to Becoming a Stockbroker"? I read an article in Vibe magazine about Russell Simmons. The stock market is his jam. He says, if you're gonna gamble, gamble with other people's money. Thanks. I'll check it out. I'm sorry about before. You don't really have a butt face. Cool. Hey, I'm not training for tennis anymore, so we can switch back bedrooms. Know what? I want to crash with Evan for one more night. Just two G's in a bunk bed. Eddie, rule number 1! Nice to see you. Where's Emery? Please sit, Billie Jean King. I think we can all agree that we want what's best for Emery. Are you firing me? Yes. And you were doing this for free, so it must be especially painful. Okay. Hey, what the heck? ! Find yourself, Billie Jean. So, is Pete Sampras nice? No, you know what? I don't want to know. I don't want to know. I'm gonna be, like, the ambassador of the human race. Got my date wrong. I need some space, but let's still be friends. - I need you all to leave. - He's kicking us out. I still want to hire you for this position. I'm going back to New York. You can't run from this forever, Ozzie. Empathy. Gina is Empathy. What are you doing? Shut up. I'm on a date. You've met someone? That's great! That's not... No. It's for the mission. Of course. You know, Nancy, you... really know how to show a guy a good time. And... thanks for paying for dinner. My pleasure. I'm definitely gonna check out Ayn Rand's stuff. She sounds so interesting. - Ayn. It's pronounced... - Ayn. You should get people's names right. Well... "Ayn" having a very good time tonight. So, what else can you tell me about Gina? I think I pretty much covered everything. You know, her likes, her dislikes, how we met, where she lives. - And there's nothing else... - I should know? Okay. Yeah. I think I know what's going on here. - You do? - Listen. There is nothing going on between me and Gina. I mean, yes, I've always thought she had a crush on me, but... she is not my type. You are. - What do I do? - Kiss him! Look, I really... I'm tempted to invite you in right now, but I'm... I'm still transitioning from divorced guy to single guy, so... Very well. Good night. I'll see you at StarCrossed tomorrow. I look forward to it. She's the one. I've gathered useful intel on Empathy from this asset. Empathy? You mean... The woman who killed Kurt. Sweet Kurt. I'm gonna use his knowledge to make her death as painful as possible. That doesn't sound like it's on-mission. I'll humiliate Empathy, and then I'll put an end to her. It'll be clean. Efficient. Maybe we should just talk about this before you do anything. I'm done talking. Now is the time for action. Mom, you didn't have to do all this. Well, I'm just so glad to have you back in town. You've got a new job at The New York Times. Safe. Stable. Prestigious. Next thing you know, you'll meet someone. Maybe like that nice girl you dated who was with the circus. She wasn't in the circus, Mom. She was a yoga teacher who had a nose ring. Hey, Mom, do you know where my Social Security card and birth certificate are? You're a grown man. You should know where your documents are. I do. I have copies. I just... I leave the originals here. I leave everything that's important here, so it's safe. I gave all that stuff to your father. - He has more storage space at his place. - What? No... Ozzie, relax. He's not that bad. That's easy for you to say. You got to divorce him. I did not expect to have to have an awkward time at Uncle Daddy's house today. - Doug? - Hey. Chelsea. What can I do for you? I wanted to see how you were doing. I'm fine, thank you. Are you, um... are you going somewhere? Yes. I'm taking a vacation. After all the stuff that happened, I just, um... need a little time to think. - Because of the kidnapping? - Yes. And other stuff. Where are you going? The Bronze Star Inn. In Schenectady. By the outlet mall? I was in a band a long time ago. Operation Mongoose. No way. My gosh. - Look at you! - Yeah. Guess who's getting the band back together again. Wow. It's happening. Pretend you just ordered some nice, steamy pizza. The delivery guy's on his way up the walk, then bam! Gets bit by a dog. - We don't have a dog. - It doesn't matter. It was on your property. Does home insurance cover it? No. Life insurance? Nope. Umbrella insurance covers everything. Maybe we should get it. Maybe you should. It's like putting bubble wrap around all your worries. Plus you get one of these bad boys. Where do we sign? It's been an eventful couple of weeks. Let's... let's just do the... Kelly, what are you doing? I'm... I'm lounging. It's... it's a lounge. Right. Can you do that without your shoes on, please? Can we not meet in a store? Sorry we're late. We were carpooling. Is that what the kids call it? - Okay, great. - Hi guys. Um, come on in. Let's see. Guys, we really do have to be out of the store by 9:45. Is everyone really clear on the concept of a hard out? - 'Cause I can't... - Yes. We are clear on that. - Let's begin. - No. No, actually, we can't begin, because... Nancy still doesn't have all of her introduction materials, so... Um, right, okay. Um... Here's your binder. Pick a sponsor. Don't make a whole thing out of it. I've got all the time in the world... murderer. I'll be your sponsor, Nancy. There you go. Don? Yeah. H-hi, Jonathan. What is happening right now? Why are you working in a coffee shop? It's related to the mission. It's the truth. It's not. It's not. I'm lying. Can we talk by the milk station? Wow, that's a lovely scarf. No, don't change the subject. Does Jeff know you work here? Technically, no... no. But don't... please don't tell him. Who am I gonna tell? I went rogue. Yeah. I didn't want to bring it up, but I heard through the grapevine. Sorry about that. No. Not at all. I'm enjoying my new-found freedom. I'm out there in the world, you know? But hey, listen, I'm a little strapped for cash. Could you get me an iced mocha macchiato on the house? - Of course. - Cool. And maybe... could you give me your tips? Okay, so, how... how was your week, Richard? Well, there was this one incident. Hey, Richard. There's a long-distance call for you on line two. - Who is it? - I don't know. I couldn't understand it. They were speaking Klingon. Like a Klingon would use a landline. So how'd that make you feel? Okay, I can't process things when you're rushing along my healing. Well, to be clear, I'm rushing through everyone's healing. Okay, Kelly, your turn to share. Um, I feel like your energy's a little too, like, overwhelmed-grad-student right now. Is there a way that we could do this another time and place that's not so rushed? I'm working on it. Nothing has come through yet. Sorry. Nancy, I'm sorry. Things aren't normally this chaotic. My offer still stands. We could meet up tonight at my barn. It would have to be, like, you know, 7:30. - I still got to feed the cows. - Sure, let's meet up there. Sounds murder-y. I like it. The store opens in five minutes. Can you do me a favor and just pick up your trash? And if you'd please put the pillows around and distribute them, I'd be really grateful. - Check the alarm. - I'm not going out the back. Go out the back. Check the alarm, guys. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Dad, are you home? Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. - Dad? - Nam myoho... - Hey, Dad? - Renge kyo. Nam myoho... You can join me if you want. No. I'm good. Ozzie! My man! Okay. All right. Yeah, it's good to see you too, Dad. So, when did you become a Buddhist? About four months ago. Got into it for this chick. She left, but it stayed. Well, all right. Did Mom call you and tell you I need to pick up some documents? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I keep all that stuff cataloged in my office. Dad, what's this? Was I in Beacon as a kid? I can't answer that. What do you mean, you can't answer it? It's a yes or no question. That I can't answer. Your mother made me promise. I'm sorry. All right. I'll just ask her myself. No. Put that away. We're gonna have to have a family meeting. Family meeting? We never have those. What's going on? Welcome to the Coconut Lounge, where the drinks are cold and the jazz is hot. This next number is one of our first songs we ever wrote together. It's called "Serengeti Rhapsody." Uno. Dos. Uno. Dos. Tres. Bless you, bless you. I-I met someone. He's, um, from Iceland. He's really sweet, and we're taking it slow. Good for you. Good, good, good. Sounds like progress. He's cool. He's, like, um... he's not really cool, but I don't really care. Which... I guess is maturity. Yes, Nancy. Do you have something that you'd like to share with Kelly? No. I would like to schedule a one-on-one appointment with you, Gina. Just you and me. Alone. I'm shy. We don't really do that here at StarCrossed. The point of group therapy is to connect with people who share a common experience. You're new. I made the same mistake. But you're doing great. Everybody loves you. Man, so desperate for love. You lost me? ! You wandered off. That's good. Blame the nine-year-old. Can you let us explain? Believe me, we know. It was not our proudest parenting moment. Fine, just tell me what happened. Okay. Yes, we went to Beacon. There was a heat wave that summer. And we thought we'd go to the lake, but your father got lost. We almost hit a deer at one point. Wait, you almost hit a deer? So now we're all hungry and lost, so we go to a grocery store for some snacks. Next thing I know, we're yelling at each other. I can't even remember what we were fighting about. Anything and everything. We could see that you were upset, so we got you a grape soda and we sat you on the horsey ride. And, after a few minutes, we looked up, and you were gone. Ozzie! We ran ourselves crazy looking for you. We... we searched all over town. I've never been more scared than I was that day. The worst 48 hours of my life. We thought we'd lost you for good. And then, out of nowhere, we got a call. One of the stock boys had found you asleep behind the big bags of dog food. I blamed him for losing you. He blamed me. And the guilt tore us apart. Soon after that, we got a divorce. Wow. We thought you'd be more upset. You're not mad at us for losing you? No, I'm-I'm furious at you, but this explains everything... all the deja vu that I've been having in Beacon... it was just that I was suppressing the memories of this divorce. Beacon was the place where my family fell apart. That's why Beacon triggered... all the anxiety and my breakdown. It wasn't aliens. Aliens? Yeah, here's the thing. I wasn't in Beacon writing a Civil War novel. I was in therapy because I thought I'd been abducted by aliens. Abducted by aliens? Therapy? Good news. I wasn't. All right? All of the trauma that I was going through was just because you all were horrible parents, which, no offense, but this is a relief... if you see it from my side. So, like, what, you were seeing, little green guys or something? Like, a tall lizard guy, and then there was, like, a Nordic, like, white one with long hair. It's-it's beside the point. I had my quit my job, and I was in this support group. I was living in a shitty motel. I had a piece of metal taken out of my head, which I need to talk to you guys about that at some point... but I had really spiraled. Ozzie, why didn't you tell us? You kept a secret from me for 30 years. I kept one for two months. So I think... it's a little kettle-calling-the-pot-kettle. So, Nancy, last time, you mentioned you lost a friend. I believe his name was Kirk. Kurt, actually. Y-yeah, is he your boyfriend? 'Cause you never actually mentioned... He was my co-worker. But you were close. Yes, we were very close. Did you feel that you and Kurt... were more than just coworkers? Yes, I suppose we were. - We had a... - Special bond. Did you love Kurt? Is she taunting me? Does she want to luxuriate in the details of the murder she committed? I won't give her the pleasure. I came here to join this group for support. I did not come here to be interrogated in a barn by some quack. No! Nancy! Use that! Your anger is good! Own it! Own it! Or take it out on me if you need to. I know what this is. She's super jealous. She thinks you're in love with me. Why would she think that? I don't know. Well, um... I know we're a bunch of old guys up there, and we're a little rusty. You have a number-one fan here. - Okay. Well, thank you. - Yeah. I had no idea there was this side to you. It's something that doesn't come up in my day job, right? So... - No, I had fun. - Well, thank you. Okay, um, well, it is getting late tonight. I should probably head back. Yes, and I... you know, they're loading up, so I just need to help the fellows load up. - Yeah. Sure. - So... see you around. - Yeah. Sure. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Take it easy. - You too. Good night. Bye. Keyboards. Ozzie? I thought maybe you'd like to see this. What's this? I couldn't stop thinking about that day in Beacon, and when you mentioned the alien therapy thing, I remembered you started drawing these right after you got lost. I drew this? And about 500 others. There's another shoe box full in the bedroom. You called it "Snake Man and Little Guy." And you didn't think this was weird? It creeped me out at the time. I wanted to take you to therapy, but your father said it was... quote, "white people shit." I still think it is. No offense. We just felt you needed to see these... after what you told us. I appreciate that. I thought I had an answer, and now I have more questions. You know, Nancy seemed pretty shaken up. I'm gonna go check on her. Sorry, Gina. I just... Okay, um, maybe that's a good stopping place. Ennis, can we use the barn next week? No. The barn's booked for a wedding. Yeah, can I say something? We should take a break. What do you mean? I mean... - what is that? - Calista, shut up. Look around. You know, we're half gone. We're in a barn. Seems like we're just forcing it. It doesn't really feel like group anymore. Doesn't. And I know what groups feel like. I'm in a lot of groups. I'm in... I'm in, the Knitting Circle, and then Let's Take a Hike With Seniors and Death Talk Cafe... Okay! Okay, okay. Okay, cool. Okay, cool. Great. So, our next meeting is TBD. Or how about not at all? How about that? - No. No, that's extreme. - No, no. Is it? Is that extreme, Margaret? Well, how's... how's this for extreme, okay? Holding this entire group... on my shoulders for all of this time, okay? Holding... trying to find places to meet... and trying to help people... and giving and giving and giving... and giving and giving and giving and giving... until there is nothing left of the giving tree! Do you know what happens then? It dies! And everybody sits around on the stump of the tree! Good! Why don't you just have your meetings... You know what? Maybe I need a break. Aah, it! It's TBD! - Shh. - What? You're gonna wake up Ozzie. This just gets weirder and weirder. - Empathize... - With this. Oh! Everybody I never wanted to see again, all in one room. So, tell me why we're here again? Um... Uh... Right. 'Cause the dream never dies. Well, uh... uh, nerds are supposed to be cool now, right? Yeah. Yeah, maybe, you know. Let's see if we're grandfathered in. Yeah. Oops. Sorry. Come on, man, aren't we a little too old for that now? Too old for what... exactly? Um... too old to fall back on an outdated social hierarchy that penalizes achievement and rewards mediocrity. Oh. That sounded like an insult. I think. Um... Whoa, it's... No, don't. Don't. ...my life coach, so... Okay. Ooh. Come on. Wow. Looks like it's just me and you. * It's the same as the emotion... * Yeah, you know. That and your teensy, weensy, little... * Give me your heart, make it real or else... * Hey, so what'd you end up doing after high school? I joined Special Forces. Got my CPA degree off the GI Bill. You should check it out. I'm gonna kick your ass. Yeah, good luck with that. Um... you meant today, right? Whoa. No. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. Oh. Somebody call 911! Call 911! Oh. What's Torres doing here? I don't know. He and Quinn don't officially start till Monday. Hey, Torres. Hey, what's up? Hey, you know, uh... you know it's Friday night, right? - Yeah, I know. Just not really sure how this whole desk thing works, so, uh... figured I'd drop off a few things early. Starting with a picture of yourself. Yeah. It's a reminder. Of...? Something I like to be reminded of. Hmm. Okay, we got to go. Talk to you Monday. Oh, you guys are... late to spinning class or something? Uh, no, Gibbs is famous for coming in just before the weekend starts and saying... Grab your gear. That a well-timed illustration, boss? Got a death at Quantico. Okay. - Are you coming? I'm not much of a varsity letters guy. - James Bruno. Graduated Puller High 15 years ago. Barely, from what I hear. His father was stationed at the motor pool on base. - So, what do you think? Involuntary manslaughter? Yeah. Maybe. Jethro Gibbs doesn't like to commit. That's why it's the perfect job for him. Thanks for calling me. I'm ready to get started. Get started. Okay. All right, what did I miss? Your jacket. Okay. Oh, I don't know, he looks fine. Just fine. Who is he? Oh, that's Agent Torres. Oh, that's great. Who are you? A-Agent Quinn. I swear, I barely touched him. I mean, I just did a controlled throw so that he would think twice about touching me. So, what started the fight? Nothing. He's just that kind of guy. He's just always starting something. When was the last time you saw him? Uh, I haven't seen him since high school. 15 years. Looks like nothing's changed. The teenage years are fraught with peril. The frontal cortex is responsible for self-regulation. It develops gradually over adolescence. Unfortunately, in some adults, well, it never occurs. You aren't talking about anyone in particular, are you, Doctor? 'Cause I was only popping that bubble wrap to see if it was still... The victim, Mr. Palmer. I was referring to the victim. - What about him? Well, I don't see anything obvious, but this hypersalivation suggests there's some sort of poison at work. Boss, we got a problem. What do you got, McGee? Talked to one of the eyewitnesses. They saw Bruno arrive early, put something in one of these lockers and it wasn't a math book. Stand clear. - Yeah. I think this guy had issues. So, this button moves forward; this one moves backwards, and this is the "Oops, How Did That Get There?" button. The what? We push it when Gibbs asks for the impossible to distract him. I-It's preloaded with pictures of his ex-wives or Jimmy Palmer making turducken, stuff like that. And you think he doesn't know what you're doing? He's good. He's not that good. All right, Jim Bruno. Let's go. - Jim Bruno, born James. Left home after high school, never came back. Yeah, he got a job teaching shop at a community college. Ended after a burglary conviction. Wrong button. Oops. - Bruno's never paid taxes, never voted, and has no recent home address we can find. Yeah, your doc confirms that he was poisoned to death. Are we sure the explosive was his? We are now. A base surveillance camera shows him assembling a bomb in his car. Bomb squad's sending it to Abby. Said there's enough explosives in there to level the gym. Bruno would've ended up killing his entire high school graduating class. McGee and Quinn. High school records. On it. Bishop and Torres, go talk to his teachers. See who remembers him. Uh... Yeah? What desk should I be at? - Right here. My old desk. Putting baby in the corner? That's where you sat when you were a probie. Since when do you sit down? Oh. Uh... There's five of us here now. Gonna have to... rearrange some stuff. You try to do what you can for these kids, be sensitive to their needs but some of them are just, well, beyond reach, you know? Hey! Hey! Don't just pull the poster down! Take the tape off the wall! Idiots. Sorry, where were we? You were just telling us how sensitive you can be. Hey, I did what I could for that kid. His senior year, I spent eight weekends in a row in Saturday detention with him, trying to whip him into shape. Nothing took. Always causing a ruckus. Recent contact? No... but it's a tight community. I heard a rumor he was renting a room from an old substitute teacher. Do you think he was targeting anyone in particular? Take your pick. That punk had problems with everyone in the school. How many had problems with him? What, you're looking for a list or something? His death wasn't accidental. He was poisoned. Well, then you got your work cut out for you. Everyone had problems with that kid. Abbs, McGee said you had something for me. Yup. Yup, I do. Yeah. Behind your back. No... no, this is some... it's nothing. It's just... Well, it's my... it's my high school yearbook. I thought I would, you know, get in the mood for the case. It's a very bad move. I don't want to talk about it. Works for me. It's just that... high school, you know? It's where I found my... I don't know, style? And realized my obsession with blood-spatter patterns. Speaking of which... It just wasn't a great combo for making friends and influencing people. I had a lot of, um, alone time in high school, but... let's just leave it at that 'cause I said I didn't want to talk about it, remember? Yes. Okay. Good. On to happier subjects. This is the explosive device that Bruno was going to use to commit mass murder. It has a wireless receiver and it was built from a toy remote-control car kit. Can you trace it? Hopefully or eventually. Don't be so impatient. How close did Bruno need to get to trigger the explosive? Well, it's a long-range transmitter, so he wasn't, like, suicidal, if that's what you're thinking. As a matter of fact, he was trying to quit smoking and that is what actually killed him. The killer spiked his nicotine patch with a cyanide analogue about 20 minutes before he put it on, according to the adhesive oxidation. That rules out everyone at the reunion. I know. Ducky said that Bruno was already wearing the patch when he got there. That's good news. 'Cause it narrows down our suspect list. Yeah. To zero. If I never see a retired substitute teacher again, it'll be too soon. How many are left? Well, five down, six to go. Quinn's got another five. Ma'am, hello. NCIS. I'm, uh, Special Agent Timothy McGee and this is Special Agent Bishop here. Hi, there. Uh, are you currently renting a room to this man? Aren't you two cute. I'll take two boxes of Skinny Mints and two boxes of Peanut Butteries. - My apologies. I don't see so well these days. I could've sworn you said you were selling cookies. Wishful thinking, I guess. I do love Skinny Mints. Mmm, I do, too. So how long has Bruno been living here? Several years now, poor thing. Would you like some coffee? Uh, no, thanks, I'm okay, ma'am. Heard on the radio what happened. Don't buy a word of it. - Really? Why not? James Bruno was such a nice boy. Always paid his rent on time. Wouldn't hurt a fly. Cream? Uh, no, ma'am, I actually said I didn't want coffee. Cream it is. - Uh... did you know that he had a criminal record? I'm blind, honey, not an idiot. I did my background check before I rented the room. Which is back this way, if you want to see it. I didn't learn anything I didn't know already, though. I remember that boy from high school. We heard he was trouble back then. Oh, he was. Everyone hated him. But then he changed senior year. Out of the blue, he started dating one of the most popular girls in class. It was the darndest thing. She turned that boy's whole life around. And his attitude. He ended up being quite well-liked. Here you go. You got a key? No. I don't go in there. He likes his privacy. Boys and their boy antics. What a tragic ending. But I don't believe for a second he's capable of murder. I can't imagine why anyone he went to school with would want to kill him. Or why anyone would at all, for that matter. Know what I mean? All right. He was a good kid. - Not that good. - Look at this, iPads, jewelry, paintings. - Oh, where he get all that stuff? - Good question. Okay, people, we have fine art on table A. Electronics on table B. Jewelry and household goods, tables C... There's a lot of stuff here, how much do you think this is all worth? All these wonderful prizes are worth tens of thousands of dollars and they can all be yours, Timothy McGee, if you can answer the NCIS bonus question. Where'd it come from? Actually, boss, I can answer that. Burglaries. All over the city. Torres dug up this report. Metro PD's been tracking a citywide theft ring for over half a decade. - This is all they got? Yup. Clearly Bruno didn't do all this himself, but Metro never generated a single lead on whoever was involved. - Well, I have one. Not to brag. All the fingerprints that I found in the room belonged to Bruno. But I also found this, which did not, according to Ducky. Bruno had a visitor with a really bad case of pityriasis capitis. AKA dandruff. Left flakes everywhere. Like snow. That teacher see anyone? I don't think she's seen anyone since the '90s, boss. She did say Bruno would have an occasional visitor. Said it was, "A man or maybe a woman, I think." Whoever they are, I'll bet you dollars to donuts that they are gonna be coming back for this stuff. Take Quinn, McGee, eyes on that house 24/7. Abbs? Don't even think about it. - So how long has it been since you've been on stakeout? - It's been a while. But I-I'm good to go. I taught yearly seminars on it. Oh, I... I remember. Oh, that's right. I did forgot one crucial element. What's that? Hydration is your enemy. Ah, yeah. Well... Men's room. Ladies' room. No. I am not at DEFCON 1 yet. But you will be the first to know. You will be the one with the bag on your head. - What is she doing? We told her to stay in the house. Well, we told her to do what she normally does, so... Does she normally water the bird feeder? - Aw, be nice. She's a lonely old lady. Which reminds me, Bishop told me you're going to propose to your girlfriend. Congrats. Thanks. Tho... uh, those two things reminded you of each other? Oh. When are you gonna pop the question? When it's time. And when is that time? I don't know. I'm not exactly sure yet. I know I'm just gonna feel it out and... you know, I... I think... I'll just know, you know? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Right. No. I'll know that it's time when it's time. When might that be? I... Ooh, I see something. Yeah, it was really good chatting. Oh, yeah. Ooh, I got to go. - She won't tell us who she is. - Yeah, still no hits on her prints. Abby confirmed that it's her dandruff in our dead guy's room. Any I.D.? Only thing she had on her was her purse. - Yeah, and I have been to drug-lord torture rooms less scary. Me? Oh. Yup. What's your name? Okay. Where do you live? Okay. What were you doing in Jimmy Bruno's house? All right, we can sit here all day doing this... Hey. Are you hungry? Yeah? Here you go. Hey. How's the interrogation going? Well, just as you thought. Gibbs is slow walking it. Seeing if Torres will pick up the pace. Hmm, how's he doing? Well, he interrupted Gibbs. Took me four years before I got up the nerve to do that. Thank you. But he's got her talking. - Don't thank me too fast. We're about to charge you with murder. Bruno was my friend, I would never hurt him. Okay, well, then help us find out who did. I don't know anything. Did you know your friend tried to murder 50 people? - And maybe you were planning it with him. No! Hey! - Then why were you running? I wasn't. Really? Sardines, underwear? Looks like you were planning a trip somewhere. Or, you know what? I don't even want to imagine what else. Let's just go with running. You're wrong. That bomb couldn't have been Bruno's. He wouldn't do something like that. His fingerprints were all over it. Then you made a mistake! He's a thief, but not a killer. So you do know something. You're a thief, too, huh? Well, somebody's going down for Bruno's murder and guess who the Wheel of Misfortune just stopped on? I helped Bruno sell some stuff, that's all. It's none of my business where he got it. How long you been fencing for him? We have video of your friend building that bomb. He's not who you think he is. No, he's not who you think he is. You... you see him as you want to see him. He's got a lot of bark, yeah, but no bite. If he really did plant that bomb, then someone made him do it. He was tricked or something. And while you're wasting time in here with me, whoever manipulated him could be out there trying again. Did you ever think about that? - In some ways, Bruno, I envy you. When I was a child, I often fancied living the life of a daring cat burglar. Fortunately for me, yeah, at age of nine, on my maiden voyage, I fell off our neighbor's roof, yeah. Landed on my coccyx. And that was the end of that. You're lucky it ended so quickly. One time when I was in high school, I spent a night in jail for... Uh, for... Never mind. For what exactly, Mr. Palmer? Just-- it's funny, I-I said the word "jail." I meant to say, um... Vail. Yeah, I was-I was a big skier in high school. Were you now? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I loved the-I loved the, uh, snow. I loved-I loved, uh, skiing and-and... What I'd do is I'd- - Vail! You look like a man on a mission. Got an alibi for the murder. She was nowhere near Bruno when he was poisoned. Oh, and so it goes. Got us to thinking, maybe there's a second bomber. We could use a lead. Well, let's see what we can come up with. This man has told me quite a bit about himself. Starting with these burns. They're quite old, probably inflicted when he was a teenager. Military records indicate that his father died of lung cancer, excessive cigar smoking. Yeah, so we can put two and two together. He had a rough childhood. And also a rough week. Well, yeah. He's dead. Yes, but days before that, he was in a fight where he suffered severe body blows. If you look carefully, you can make out the imprint of a fist. Well, his knuckles don't look too bad. Yes, well, oddly enough, he didn't seem to fight back. Even more odd was the fact that we removed a diamond earring from this lobe. Well, men are piercing their ears now, Duck. Yes, but I'm referring to the fact that the hole was closed up from disuse. Yet he forced the earring in anyway. Ugh... That must've hurt like a mother. I'm sure it has some... psychological significance, but I'm not sure what. However, Abby came up with a second set of DNA on the earring. So, I imagine you'll find out soon enough. Well, is that a good enough lead for you? Hey, so, you're the world-famous Abby Sciuto I keep hearing so much about. Oh, well, guess we can skip the "I thought you'd be taller" part. I'm Agent Quinn. For what's it worth, I thought you would be exactly five feet, six inches. I made a 3D avatar of you, using NCIS security camera footage. And the hairs slowly went up on Agent Quinn's neck. Oh, no, no! I just... I needed to know your sizes, because... I'm knitting you a "Welcome to NCIS" sweater. Oh! But until it's done, welcome... to NCIS. Well, thank you very much. Do you want a tour? I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to... He wants to find out where the earring came from. Of course he does. Well, right now, all I can tell you is that the prior owner was a female. Okay, so do you know how long Bruno had it in his ear? I have been waiting for someone to ask me that. The impurities in the gold caused our victim's skin oil to oxidize. And by measuring that amount, I could determine that he forced the stud through his ear, like, right before he went into the reunion. To kill 50 people. Then was poisoned to death. Okay, so whoever owns the stud, maybe she knows something. Well, I'm running the DNA through CODIS right now. But I've also been looking at this, trying to find pictures of women. I found this in a trench coat in Bruno's closet. Unfortunately... no women yet. Huh. Are these the homes that he robbed? Yeah. Looks like he was casing them for a few days. There's also a few pictures of his feet... and some pictures of some other people that I haven't identified yet. Ho-Hold up. Go back one. That's Neal Sherwood. You know him? Well, he was at the reunion, and he had a fight with the victim right before he died. Well, that's important. Uh, yeah, because Neal said they hadn't seen each other in 15 years. Oh. Where is he? - With his suitcase, wherever that is. Neighbors said he split right after the reunion. - Left in a hurry. He's running. Quinn, BOLO. McGee, freeway cams and credit cards. Find him. - We found something. Abby got a hit on the DNA from the earring Bruno was wearing. - Katrina Cooper. A high school classmate of Bruno's. Former prom queen, married the school jock, active social life. How did Bruno get her earring? Could've stolen it, but if he did, she never reported it. They have any recent contact? No. No calls, no texts, no Snapchat doggie faces. The only connection we could find was from high school. They had a Saturday detention together, once. 15 years ago? Thin, I know. Talk to her. Find out why her DNA was in our dead guy's ear. Round two, everybody! We got soccer meatballs, lacrosse stick hot dogs... and pigskin pizza pockets. Who's hungry? - Mmm. I am. Hi. You must be here for Katrina. Why would you say that? That's what happens when you marry the most popular girl in town. Everybody's here for Katrina. Hmm. She's over there, in the huddle. They're like... little footballs. - And I told the guy, "Give me Louis Vuitton, or give me death." I got this. Okay. Um, Katrina Cooper? How you guys doing? You guys have fun? NCIS Special Agent Torres, Bishop. Hi. Can we have a word with you? Of course. Let's not disturb the party, shall we? Excuse me. Let's not do that. They're little footballs. They're good. - And how can I help you? Do you know this guy? Mm, no. Am I supposed to? Well, you guys went to high school together. Oh, in fact, he actually died in front of you. At your high school reunion, two days ago? Interestingly enough, wearing one of your earrings. It was stolen. Oh. You didn't report it stolen. I am now. You know, I bet you and me had something in common in high school. I don't think so. We both liked bad boys. The badder the better, except, I grew out of it. I don't think you did. Your husband know that you and Bruno have been sleeping together? Excuse me? What I'm wondering... is if you knew how bad Bruno really was. - You know, if he told you about, for the last several years, he's been robbing people in the city. Yeah, I think it's time for you to go. Cheers. Have one more question... No. No, no, no more questions. I don't know anything about any robberies, I'm not cheating on my husband and I have no idea where Neal Sherwood is. Okay? Well, that was actually my next question, which... I haven't asked yet. Oh, right. Hmm. Where is he? Get down! Found him. The cops are outside right now. It's over. To be honest, it's kind of a relief. I am willing to set the record straight, but I cannot go to prison. I just can't. I can't have it, my family... can't have it. So... I'm sorry. Shot himself with a flare gun. That's a new one. Did I miss the part where he set the record straight? Maybe it's on the laptop? Go-Go Abby fingers. Hey, so, um... You, um... liked bad boys in school, huh? I'm sorry, I just... I just painted for you for more of a goody two-shoes, uh, prom queen type. Actually, I... was the prom queen. Wow. So you played us both. Nice. Except, I was voted in as a joke. Kind of like Carrie, but... without the blood. Bishop, that's like... the worst thing I've ever heard. Yeah, I didn't have any friends in high school, I was too... me, I guess. I got something. Okay, it's a text document. Neal made it right before he shot himself. Looks like some kind of confession. It's even double-spaced and everything. - What exactly is he confessing to? - According to Neal, he and his high school friends are the ones behind Metro's theft ring. With each friend playing a very specific role. Adam Cooper, former jock, ended up running a sports betting company. That's where he would identify the wealthy marks. - Katrina Cooper, his prom queen wife, would flirt her way into the homes to get info on their security systems. Bad boy would do the actual robberies, and this woman, who we've now identified as former classmate, Angela Russell, would fence the stolen goods on the street where she lived. Finally, there's Neal Sherwood, the accountant. And he laundered the money. Yep. According to Neal, they came up with the idea to start a robbery gang back in school, after they met at a Saturday detention. - He said they talked about it as a joke at first, as a way to "get back" at their parents. Eventually they realized, if they pooled their talents, they could make some real money. - All of this seems very familiar. - Yeah... Yeah, I'm v-very interested in this case, here. We got five different high school kids from varied social backgrounds all coming together on their Saturdays, for detention. You know, it kind of reminds me of, uh... You've... You don't... Not important. Sorry. Anyway, the different social groups was part of the reason Metro was never able to crack the burglary ring. They were never able to find a connection between the players. Congratulations, we just solved Metro's case. What about our own? We have no clue who killed our victim! Actually, not true. The prom queen ain't talking, but the fence is. She thinks she knows who killed Bruno. Two days ago, your wife gave Bruno that earring. I don't believe you. Welcome to the club. You were the only one not at the reunion. You were the only one that had the opportunity to poison Bruno. Prosecutor's gonna file charges today, unless you have something to tell us. This isn't where I imagined I'd be after high school. Ah. Welcome to the club. I wanted to be a pro football player. You? Painter. Really. Really? Yeah. Really. Painter. Loved to paint. Watercolors, mostly. I took every art class that school had. Water colors? It's hard to imagine a grown man... So what happened? Life. Life. I paint with wood. It's close enough. Not for me. I suspected Katrina and Bruno had started up again, but I didn't want to believe it. But if she really gave him her earring it's game over for us. It's worse than that. I think that witch tried to kill me. The last house we knocked over, Bruno snagged a painting worth over a million bucks. My wife kept joking we should take out our partners, keep the money for ourselves. Said we should bomb the reunion, and make it look like a terrorist attack. I honestly thought she was joking. She must've talked Bruno into it. He was always a sucker for her. No way he would come up with something like that on his own. Hell, he was even gonna pretend to let Neal kick the crap out of him at the reunion as a goof, to impress some girls. Bruno was bad on the outside, but good on the inside. My wife? The opposite. What about you? All I can say is I'm not a murderer. I didn't kill Bruno, and I wasn't anywhere near him when he was poisoned. Hypothetically speaking, how would you feel about a betting pool on whether his alibi checks out? Hypothetically? How'd Ducky bet? Guilty. How'd you bet? I'm not a gambling man. And I have no idea. - I mean, who are these people? Living double lives like this? I mean, yeah, I mean, I... I lived as someone else, for the most of the last decade, but... I had an excuse, I was, uh... I was undercover. Which version is the real them? Which version is the real you? You're looking at it. Am I? You created all those covers. It wasn't random. Wait, you're saying that a part of me wanted to be a, uh, mafia-tied, vegan juice-bar owner? Eh... You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? You tried to kill us all! Oh, could everyone just please stop fighting? Shove a Pixy Stix up your nose! - McGee is taking them to Metro not a moment too soon. And Miss Congeniality treated psychotics before, and people with the right combination of chemical imbalance and psychological damage that can't be reached. You think that's me? You think I can't get better? You? You kidding me? You're hopeless. Everybody can get better, Tate. Everybody. I just think you're scared. Of what, I'm not sure yet. Maybe rejection. Certainly because of what your father did to you. I was afraid my big dick wouldn't work. What? Yeah, that's why I didn't take the meds. Tate. I was afraid my dick wouldn't work. Because I met someone. This one I did after my dad left. I was ten, I think. Last week, first day at my new school... sucks. Westfield, right? The worst. I got thrown out of there. I hate it here. I hate everyone. All there bourgeoisy designer bullshit. East Coast was much cooler. I mean, at least we had weather. I love it when the leaves change. Yeah, me, too. Why did you move here? My dad had an affair. My mom literally caught him in the act. That's horrible. If you love someone, you should never hurt them... never. Right? I know. And the worst part is that six months earlier, my mom had, like, this brutal miscarriage. The baby was seven months old, and we had to have this macabre funeral. Have you ever seen a baby coffin? # You have to get back in the saddle # # It's a special death, you say # I'm sorry. # And me, the brown-eyed daughter # Why are you seeing my dad? Don't ask questions you already know the answer to. You're smarter than that. Want to listen to Morrissey? He's cool and he's pissy and he hates everyone and everything. Got any Kurt Cobain on that thing? What are you doing in here? Just listening to music, Dad. You need to leave, Tate. I'm sorry. He shouldn't be in here, and I think you know that... please. What's that thing you think I'm afraid of? Fear of rejection? Stay away from him. Dad, nothing... You heard me! No! Bullet, bullet, bullet! Hey, babe, you seen my razor blades? Your family is in danger. What are you doing? Why are you in my house? ! I want you to stay out of my house. Do you understand? Can I smoke in here? No. Adelaide, answer me, please. Can I pet your dog? No, Adelaide, I want you to stay out of the house. I want you to stop coming in and opening things up and telling me that I'm going to die. She said that? She says that to everybody. Say you're sorry, Addy. No, they did it. Who did it? The twins. Shh. Can I... pet your dog? No, Adelaide, listen to me. I want you to stop coming in here without permission. Am I clear? Vivien. Am I clear? Yes. Thank you. Time to go, Addy. Hallie! Are you okay? She shouldn't have done that. Sorry about all this. You touch my kid one more time and I will break your goddamn arm. No! I have no evidence of any past violence. No, I don't have his social. Listen, do not transfer me again. I'm trying to report a patient of high school age, that I believe could be dangerous. Yes. Yes, I'll hold. Unbelievable. May I clean in here? It's not a good time, Moira. It's Thursday. I get off in 20 minutes. If I don't do it now, it's not getting done until Monday. Am I distracting you? Why don't you touch me a little? Get out. What are you afraid of? Your wife's not home. She's probably at Pilates. I won't tell. Oh, God. I didn't tell when you saw me playing with myself the other day. Please, just go. Did you touch yourself after? Please just go. You did. Do it again. Show me. Oh, shit. Violet! Violet! Damn it! I'm not scared of you! Should be! Fight, fight, fight! Oh, she friggin' burned me! In my professional opinion, whoever painted this wall had some deep psychological issues. I thought you had a patient. Ah, they bailed. You want some help cleaning up? Yeah. Thanks. This thing doesn't tweak you out? There's something about it that I find... really comforting. One of my psych professors told me that people tell stories to cope with their fears. All art and myths are just creations to give us some sense of control over the things we're scared of. Afraid of dying, create reincarnation. Afraid of evil, create a benevolent God who sends evildoers to Hell. I think I just like that I don't have to think while I do it. Okay. I always thought you were prettiest like this. No makeup. Messy hair. A little sweaty. I'm old. Stop. You're beautiful. You are. No. Ben... Violet won't be home for an hour. No. Okay, Ben? No. Come on, babe. Ben... No. Sorry. Just no. How long, Viv? How long are you going to punish me for? I'm not punishing you, you narcissistic asshole! I'm trying to figure out how to forgive you for having sex with one of your students. You want me to have sex with you? I can't even look at your face, Ben, without seeing the expression on it while you were pile-driving her in our bed! I screwed up! How many times do I have to say it? I'm sorry! I was hurting, too. Oh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did, did the, did the life that was growing inside you die? And did you have to carry that around in your belly? The dead corpse of our baby son? Did you have to go into labor, and deliver our child? Dead? My son died too! My baby died, too! And you buried your sorrow in some 21-year-old's pussy. You know, I could show you statistics on how many men cheat after a miscarriage. I was there for you, Viv. I was patient, and understanding, and caring... and I put your feelings first. My hero. You know, I don't even know how to say this without coming off like an asshole, I really don't. You know what? Just go ahead. Really. Never stopped you before. You're so angry, why don't you really tell it like it is? Six months of therapy with you apologizing, and crying, was bullshit. So, please, tell me how you really feel. You got a dog. I needed you, and you got a dog. Oh...! It was me you should have been curling up with at night! Not a dog! Oh, so... I needed you! You needed me? So she was revenge, because you needed me, because I wasn't there for you in your time of need? Now I get it! We haven't had sex in almost a year. Yeah... you think I don't know that? October 20th. We had great sex, babe. It was loving and sexy and personal, and even a little, even a little weird. I love you. I moved across country for you. Because, in all my life, the only thing I've been truly scared of is losing you; Losing this family. Something horrible happened to us. And we handled it even more horribly. But this... this place... is our second chance, babe. It's our second chance. But I just... I just need to know that you want it, too. Tell me, honey. What are you doing? Viv... What are you doing? Oh! We're going to be happy here. Here you go, Hallie. Good girl. Hey. Whoa. Come here. What happened to your face? Fell down. Come here. Sit, sit, sit. Boy or girl? Girls. Three of them. Hope they look worse than you do. You know their names? I'm not narking. You know, we can easily move you to a different school. There are a lot of really good private schools right in this neighborhood. I'm not running away. I'm not scared of them. Not afraid of anything. It's like that time in kindergarten, when you insisted that I bring you home from the slumber party 'cause all the other girls were sleeping with the nightlight on. I know you've gotten the short end of the stick, lately. This move, and your dad and I haven't exactly been great to be around. Why don't you guys get divorced, if you're so miserable? We still love each other. You could've fooled me. I thought you hated each other. Well, at least you hated him. I don't blame you. He was a shithead. Sorry. It's okay. He was a shithead. You know, we got a lot of history. Your dad's been through a lot, I've been through a lot. Guess we need each other. What are you scared of? You said I'm not scared of anything, so... what scares you? Lately? Everything. Life will do that to you. I hate her! I just want to kill her! Then do it! One less high school bitch making the lives of the less fortunate more tolerable is, in my opinion, a public service. Look, you want her to leave you alone? Stop making your life a living hell? Short of killing her, there's only one solution. Scare her. Make her afraid of you. It's the only thing bullies react to. How? It's simple. You simply walk up to her and say, Here's the deal: I need you to stop harassing me. I got what you want. Drugs. Come to my house tomorrow for your free sample. I'm a dealer, and a good one. I got the best shit in town. She's a cokehead. I don't have coke. You won't need any. It's just an excuse to get her here. After that, she'll leave empty-handed and terrified. And I promise you, you'll never be bothered by her again. How am I going to terrify her? Helter-skelter! That's where I come in. Hot. I thought I told you to throw that thing away. Oh, you're not talking? Well, I'll give you points for creativity. We were pretty hot this afternoon. You really want to go for round two, huh? Come on. I can be kinky. Now is not your time. Enjoy the house. Go back to bed. I love you. I love you, too. What's down there? My stash. Parents toss my room every week. If you're screwing with me... It's just the basement. I found the best hiding place. This is great shit, too. All the coke coming to the U.S. from Central America smuggled in on lobster boats in Gloucester. I used to show my boobs to the lobstermen in return for a key or two before they cut it. So where is it? Right around the corner. To the right. This place is a dump. Oh, shut up. I want my goddamn drugs. Then keep going. So this is the coke whore. Who the hell are you? Get the lights. What is going on? ! What is going on? ! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off me! Get off me! Stop! Stop! Please, stop! Mommy...? Will you wait? ! I don't think she'll be bothering you anymore. What was that? ! What are you talking about? She hit me in the balls and got away. She must have run into a wall or something. No, I saw something! What are you talk...? Violet, you're talking crazy. This is cool. We showed that bitch. Damn! I never want to see you again! I thought you weren't afraid of anything! Who are you and why are you following me? ! Your family is in danger! What happened to you? Pretty, aren't I? It's over 70% of my body. I'm Larry Harvey. And you have to get out of that house. I could have you arrested, you know. Peeking in people's windows is still a crime. Even in L.A. They're not gonna put me back into jail. I have brain cancer. Terminal, inoperable. I'm sorry. Don't be. That's the only reason they let me out. Homicide. Triple homicide. I was in that house for six months before I started hearing voices. My wife thought I was working too hard. My daughter Angie was six. The older one, Margaret, was ten. She looked like her mother. That's funny how it skips a generation like that. I killed them... all. Lorraine was ill that night. She took a pill. She went to bed early, my wife. And then I, uh, I put the girls down, and then the voices started. They told me what to do. I was like... an obedient child. I... I don't know how I put myself out. I remember that night... but it's like a dream. Have you been sleepwalking? Yeah... Look at my case. Read the transcript. Listen to me, I'm a doctor. They may not put you back in jail, but I can certainly have you committed to a state mental institution. And trust me, those places make prison look like Club Med. Leave my family alone! Do you hear me? Please, please, please, you have to get out of there! That place is evil. Get off of me! Leave us alone! Leave us alone! Put those earrings back. Jesus H. Christ. You almost gave me a heart attack. Those belonged to madam. This is her house, not yours. Why is it that it is always the old whore who acts the part of a moralistic prude? I'd be nervous if I were you, too. When things go missing, they always blame the new maid. I'd move if I were you. Don't make me kill you again. Hey. Hey. What do you want for dinner? Whatever you want. I think I want Indian food. You only like Indian food when you're pregnant. Really? Mm. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh...! And I got a gun! Previously on How To Make It In America I had this sick idea last night that I wanted to pitch you... Crisp by Yosi What is this rumor about Rasta Monsta being a front for weed spray? I'm not a drug front, Steve. - You pitched me a story. - Yeah. I said no and then you went ahead and wrote it anyway. I'm not sure this is gonna work out. We need to find a new manufacturer immediately. You got that kind of money for production? - What is that? - I got that from Domingo. Who the fuck is Domingo? ! This is business, do you want half of something or all of nothing? Do whatever you wanna do with Yosi and Nancy.

Yosi: Enzo, redo the samples the way we discussed or I will personally stuff you in a box and send you back to Rome in a slow boat. Go, "andiamo". - ( Ben sighs ) - ( Laughs ) Hello. So did anybody offer you something to drink? Ah, good. Okay. Sit sit. Uh, wh-where's Cam? Uh, well, Cam wasn't feeling too well. I'm sorry to hear that, but you talked to him, right?

I thought I was gonna take care of the whole thing and I didn't wanna both you with it. Well, you didn't take care of it, so now I gotta teach your boy Domingo a lesson. No no! Please. Not necessary. - We're good. - We are? You took all those tinctures off the street? Not... not exactly. I was trying to get rid of 'em, but then we got robbed by the East Flatbush Caribbean League. They said that you gotta talk to them or they'll show the bottles to the police. - I' fix it! I promise! - You can't fix shit! Stay out of it! ( Punches thudding ) Throw at the dragon, you gotta come on, cause I'm too da nice, Don! - You know that - ( Shouts ) So Jason and Noah said they got three tables for me and what I need from you is to invite every hot girl that you know. I'll see what I can do. You ever see that movie, "The 25th hour"? Ed Norton is doing like seven years. - You're doing 40 days. - 53. I was thinki, man, the email we u it could be schmaltzy. You know? "Ben Epstein and Cam Calderon cordially invite you to say farewell to their good friend David Kaplan." Yeah, that ain't gonna happen, man I don't think Cam wants his name next to mine on anything foa minute. Uh-oh, a little seven-year itch? ( Sighs ) Well, you know, we're having some issues with our partner, but the money is, like, really good. Fuck, man, money... Right, yeah, it matters, but it's only one piece of the puzzle. Let me tell you something: Sometimes who you're doing business with is a lot more important than the business that you're doing. ( Bell rings ) - Hi. - Hey, can I help you? Yeah, I'm just... I'm here to see Edie. Is that my former ir apparent who threw it all away to go back DJ in Ibiza? ( Snickers ) I haven't even been to Ibiza, Edie. Get that apple bottom in here. - Oh! - ( Sobbing ) I feel like this town is eating me alive Well, then take a deep breath And bite back. You are a beautiful, intelligent woman in the prime of your life in the greatest city on Earth. You can do anything you want, you always could. I was lucky to have you when I did. Can I have my old job back, Edie? No! ( Laughs ) You quit on me and I find somebody younger And I pay her half as much as I paid you, so. - ( Soing ) - Oh, honeybun. This is not what you want. You need to go out there, find your passion and move forward with life. - I don't know if I can do that. - Of course you can. - Try. - Well, it was pretty inspiring out in Bushwick - with the Neanderthals. - Mm-hmm. Try harder. And then for a boy, I like Aidan or Logan. What? It's very popular. Where? In Minneapolis, Minnesota? ( Laughs ) Oh, did... did I tell you about tomorrow? - No. - See, last minute, I gotta go check out this bottling plant - in Atlanta. - Bottling plant? Yeah, you know, Coca-Cola is down there. So when the big Vert American order comes in, I'll' be ready. I'll be back tomorrow. Rene, don't you dare lie to me. It's nothing. I have an situation with some Jamaicans. - So you were lying. - It's nothing I got it handled. Yeah. Hey! If you see anything you like, I'll sell it to you off the truck for half price Hey, man.

Actually it was all me and my friends, so we came here to take full responsibility and work this out with you personally. Hey, man, nice to see you again. Look, I don't care if it was all your doing or not. Rasta Monsta is Rene's company. Now he's gotta see the error of his inflammatory product or deal with the ramifications of the scorned Caribbean people. But I don't think you realize who you're dealing with.

( Phone ringing ) - Yeah. - Yosi: It's tomorrow in China. - You have something for me? - On my way. ( Beeps ) Morning. Okay, all right. So I thought a lot about what we said... The serpent, the old English look, the whole thing, right? And... What the fuck is this? This is our new design. It's sick, right? It's just what we talked about, except that I put a two-headed snake there. Do you like that? What happened to Crisp? Well, Cam had some issues with Crisp by Yosi. Then talk him out of them. You're supposed to be the smart one. No, but "crunch" is dope. "Crisp" is a better name. And I know you agree, otherwise you wouldn't be in here trying to keep it for yourself. - ( Sighs ) - Look, would you feel better if I wrote you another advance check for, say, $200,000? You have talent, Ben, but no idea how tough this business is. I can make your life very easy if you let me. I'm sorry. You know, I treat people I do business with very differently from people that I don't. Okay. So... Now at we don't have business, there is a personal matter that I would like to settle with you. There is? Are you really surprised right now? - What? - You didn't think I would find out, doing it right under my nose when I trusted you? Come on, man, what kind of person are you? Yosi, I'm sorry, okay? I got caught up, but it didn't mean anything. She still loves you. I know it. What the fuck are you talking about? W-what the fuck are you talking about? I have cameras. You kept Enzo here all nit. Trying to steal my talent? Everything Enzo does belongs to me. What the fuck are you talking about? Nothing. I... I was talking about Enzo too. Sorry. Did something happen between you and Nancy? Yosi, I totally understand if you just wanna hit me in the face right now. Just go. ( Grunts ) ( Music playing ) ( Man vocalizing ) ( Boat whistle toots ) So how do you wanna play this? I want those little bottles. Yeah well, I want my intern, Malik. Oh, I'm sure you do. Horse. You know what? Rene, I think we should just squash this thing. You know, I was thinking about doing the same thing when I went over to your house, 4:00 in the morning. Right, Malik? When I went over to the house. What the hell was Malik doing at Everton's crib at 4:00 in the morning? The East Flatbush Caribbean League would be happy to welcome Rasta Monsta into our neighborhood. I'm not worried about your neighborhood. I'm worried about vert. Vert America will never hear another word from us. That is, if you... ( Softly ) ... Keep your mouth shut about Malik. I'm not gonna say nothing, but you gotta let go of this, bro. You gotta be proud of who you are. You can't be so angry. Love will change your life if you let it. It just happened to me. Brother Rene here done gone Dr. Phil on us, y'all. ( Chuckles ) Okay. No. Come on, man. We're good? Everton: We' good. All right. Hey, listen. You know, uh, in addition to running The East Flatbush Caribbean League, I also have a little management company. I just handle just a couple of artists. Horse is one of 'em. Maybe he does like a whole jingle for Rasta Monsta. He actually loves the shit. Come on, Horse, give 'em taste. ♪ Mask on face, Glock in hand ♪ ♪ I was in and out of homes like the Orkin man ♪ ♪ make nigga kick that can, fall victim to the click clack clan ♪ ♪ my Vixen eat your face like she Ms. Pac-Man ♪ ♪ my wish her command, uh! ♪ - ( Laughs ) - Uh uh uh! Liking that. All right. I told you that she's in the middle of something right now. - That's awesome. - Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben... You lied to me. Excuse me, I'm in the middle of a meeting here. Yeah, I really don't care. I'm sorry. Can you give me a couple of minutes? - What's your fucking problem? - What the fuck is my problem? Using Yosi as a manufacturer was your idea. So what? So you set us up to get played by your husband. I set you up to make a lot of money and you fucked it all up. You don't listen, Ben. I told you he didn't know a thing. What the fuck were you thinking? You are psychotic on levels that I am only now beginning to understand. You know, I spoke to my friend at South Willard about Crisp. - You did? - Mm-hmm. I showed him your lookbook and he said it seemed unevolved, juvenile and lacked focus. Huh. Well, fuck your friend. Yeah, well, you just may have to, because they said the same thing at Odin and opening ceremony. Ben, you're really cute and you're highly ambitious, but I gotta tell you I am not sure your destiny is in fashion. Well, it was a pleasure not doing business with you, Nancy. What the fuck was that? Somebody could get killed. Sorry. ( Knocks on door ) Who is it? Tim: Yeah, I'm here about the Craigslist ad... The full body massage. Can't pass up a deal. How do you know where I live? Because I used to work for the FBI/lulu told me. Hey, listen, thanks so much for the Russian baths visit. - That was so great. - Yeah, I know. I'm really sorry about that. Look, shit's been kind of strange lately. Some girls just wanna fuck me because their boyfriends wear Neanderthal T-shirts. - That must be so hard for you. - No. I'm actually pretty good with commitment, plus Heather is into the idea of threesomes. It's just too bad that she didn't find you attractive. What do you want? I'm really sorry that you got fired for writing a fucking article about me. Don't be sorry. It was my fault. I read the article. It was really fucking good. You know, you're an Okay writer, Rachel. Thanks, Tim. Look, you definitely have a way of making my Neanderthal bullshit sound important. Rachel, look, I just came by today to see if you wanted - to come work for us. - What? Yeah, I keep trying to tell you. Shit has gotten super fucking busy. And as opposed to paying some publicist four grand a month, I figure I'd give you two. Tsk. ( Snickers ) Are you into that? ( Inhales ) - Yeah, Okay. - Awesome. Shit's gonna get weird. ( Music playing ) Am I the only guy to ever get kicked out of his own going-away party? Thanks for nothing, Dez. Really. - Really appreciate it so much. - Kapo, come on. It's the Croatian. I got my hands tied. What do you want me to do? Do you know that I am going to medium- security prison tomorrow? - Ah. - I could get shanked in the shower. The last thing I'm gonna remember is you kicking me out of my table. - Uh, come on. - It's great. - Relax. We're good. - Yeah, relax. Bullshit. The kind of money I spend here... Shout out to my man David Kaplan: Stay strong behind the wall and remember, they can lock your body, but they can't trap your mind. We love you, baby. Let's go. - ( Cheering ) - Yeah! - Can't lock up the mind! - Hey, I know you. You do? Yeah, I showed your friend an apartment once, right? - Mm-hmm mm-hmm. That apartment on 11th. - Yeah. Oh! Oh my God, you're the Real Estate agent. Yeah. - Hi. Hi. How are... how are you doing? - Hi. I think I'm doing a little better than you. - Hi, man. How are you? - What up, man? I'm all right. - Can't complain. - Yeah? Yeah yeah. Chillin' chillin'. - Cam, what up? - Not too much. Hey, can I buy you a drink real quick? Pardon me. Lulu! There you are. ( Singsong ) Debbie, Debbie, Debbie, Debbie baby! Debbie! Debbie? Hey hey, babe... Debbie? ( Beeps, ringing tone ) - Hello? - Hey. - Hello? ! - Debbie: Yes? ! Baby, what's going on? Where are you? I can't go through another night like last night again. ( Chuckles ) What are you talking about? I don't wanna have this baby with you! I'm too old anyway. I should've not even told you. Look look, Deb. Deb, I want... I wanna talk to you. I-I wanna come see you. Please! To say what? You can change? - We tried that. - ( Line clicks ) ( Beeps ) ( Sighs ) ( Music playing ) - ( Laughs ) - ( Scattered cheering ) - Yes! - ( Shouting ) ( All moaning ) - Nobody goes home. - I know a place in Chinatown. Nigga, let's go! ♪ Hands in the air... ♪ ( Loud chattering ) ♪ Hands in the air... ♪ Yo, Cam, would you give me a second, please? Thanks, man. What's up? ! I turned down Crisp by Yosi. Cool. Hey hey, let me just be honest with you, okay? I never really believed we could make it on our own. Sometimes I feel like I'm destined to work at some lame ad agency - or back at retail. - Dude, you gotta stop with that. I know, but I worry I'm not talented enough or... I don't know, the universe has other plans for me. Fuck what the universe has planned. I spoke English as a second language. I dropped out of high school and I never doubted once that we weren't gonna make it. I thought these people were gonna help us. I was just determined not to fail for the millionth time in my life. And I fucked up. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I get it. All good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, you know, so I was talking to the kid that lives here. He's moving out at the end of the month. Yeah? Hey, this could be a good office for us, right? What? With the gadzooks money. We could swing it. What gadzooks money? Oh, you remember Andy Sussman, right? Only for Crisp do I come Chinatown at 5:00 in the morning to take a meeting. Nice to see u, Cam. - What's up, Andy? - Gadzooks is up. I got my uncle's factory ready to work overtime to make the delivery, which is not bad, considering Ben call me yesterday - begging me to be your rep. - You did, Ben? I did. Ben said he needed your blessing to make it official. So what do you guys say? You in or what? - Definitely yes. - All right. You know, you two never should've dissed the kid in the first place. - I tried to tell him. - Yeah yeah yeah. And don't be fooled by the baby face. - I'm an animal. - How could we, man? ( Chuckles ) So wll ship gadzooks and then what? Huh? What are we doing next, guys? Come on, let's lock and load. - We're making jeans. - Why not? Making jeans. Sounds good to me. All right. Kapo: This is exactly how I wanna remember my boys when I'm locked up in my cage. I was just telling Cam about the jeans. - Mingo: Finally. - Yeah yeah. - You likes my Crisp? - Oh, right right. - Domingo: I know you like that. - Yay! - Stop! No! - ( Cheering ) - Cam: How? ! - I found a tailor. We're going in. We're going in! ( Cheering ) Synced by yescool Corrected by APOLLO Thank you, Mr. Busch. Hi, Grandma. How nice of you to come. Hanna, the press conference and photo shoot been moved to tomorrow. There inquired just an older man for you. He ​​said he knew you from before. Someone who knew me from the past? - He asked me to give this to you. For Hanna goddess of fishes Hanna, are you? Will I get a glass of water for you? Go get him. Go get him. Grandma, who was that guy? That man... That man is Abrascha. No one could play as beautiful as Abrascha. Germany awakes 1939 Bravo. Poltrava, Ukraine Spring 1941 Larissa and Abrascha. Two geniuses. Two prodigies. Culture in such perfection belongs to the great achievements... of our system and our party. Of course we also industrious youth our thanks. And their parents: couples Brodsky and Kaplan. You go stand. Irina Solomonova, get there too but. To show what the Soviet education in Ukraine has achieved... , our glorious party decided to these prodigies... to join in include Moscow and Leningrad. Prodigies. That word, I had never heard. But indeed their music sounded as a miracle in the ears. I had never heard such beautiful music . Piece Sarasate I knew of course. The sheet music I had. But it just sounded different. As if it and their music was not just that of Sarasate. Hey Abrascha catch. Do not you come on? Is there something wrong? I do not know. Perhaps much music is not good for us. How so? Everyone is proud of us. We may even go to Moscow. Therefore net. Moscow is also the Central Conservatory located. Maybe we should stay there. What can they teach us? Irina is the best. She sure is. Abrascha... I do not want to leave. If we just make a few mistakes, is the party not so proud of us. Moreover, I am too. Let's go tracking. Like the Indians. Hi, I'm Hanna. Hanna Reich. - What are you doing? I want to play with you. - We prefer to play alone. Not so play. I want to make music with you. Come on. I was at your concert site. You're German, right? We have no time to play with you . We go on tour. Did you know that the Indians called this an iron horse? I think it's pretty scary. She instills fear in me also. We go with our music conquer the world. Here is where the train. - Larissa and Abrascha, come on. You are not yet so famous that you can waiting train. Come on. In the train I can buy food. - Not as good as this. Listen to your mother. I have read on the go. Anything So chief, stay healthy and take care of the two ladies. Superb. That you play for the first time. A beautiful melody. A German piece? - No, my friend Larissa Brodsky. I did not know you had a new girlfriend. I also taught by Irina Solomonova. Did you know that an Indian on his own a buffalo with a bow and arrow to kill? Or a lion with a knife? They suck those Indians stories from their thumb. Abrascha Give that horrible knife to me. I've got Colonel Tapilin. Such a stupid gift can only give a policeman. The knife is yours, but this trip remains folded. A cut may be the end of our tour mean. Do you want that? You need your hands spared. They are your most precious instrument. They are irreplaceable. So, now we're rehearsing. You are now Soviet representatives. You should always behave as if Comrade Stalin sitting next to you. We will now play Hungarian Dance. Hanna, your teacher is there. Please come down. Alexander, glad you're here. Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall. - What's Carnegie Hall? The most famous concert hall in America. You go in the fall there on tour. We go to the Wild West? - May the whole family? You should be on stage soon. Bending. That is not to believe this. America. And can anyone join? - We Americans will show... the best prodigies live in the Soviet Union, among others here. Hopefully grandpa still also included in the family, huh? Without you I'm not going to Grandpa. To your health, kid. On you. Better today than tomorrow. And for good. You deserve a life without hatred for our people. Do not tell me such things, father. There is no better country than our homeland. Hello, my name is Max Reich. I am the director of the German brewery. I know who you are. What can I do for you? I hope not to bother you, but I'd like to see. I thought the house was on fire, as soon as you played. Hanna kept himself only at the right pace. Larissa has no problem with my pace. Much feeling for music and so few people. Hanna, you have a beautiful bowing and a good sense of rhythm. I loved it. All three of you. I think we should do this more often. - That we would find very pleasant. This you were lost in the lake. What the hell is that? - For anyone a new winter coat. Come here. Fits like a glove. - Those were fixed very expensive. Cheap they certainly were not. - Who do they get paid? Why do you ask? - Max Reich sure, huh? Did you ask money for my music? Why did not you tell me? - If your father, I can decide for themselves. He does justice to its name, because he is rich. In socialism everything is shared. It's all about me? To me and my music. Come here, please. You've rehearsed a lot lately. There are your father and I very happy. Yes, I love to play. Sit down. You know I'd find if you exercise more fine. And your teacher complains about your math skills. I know you're fond of music, and that's fine. Yet I have the feeling that you rehearse especially for those two kids. These prodigies. - Larissa and Abrascha are my friends. Those kids are Jewish. It is not good for you if you handle them too much . Not for us. Actually, you've earned that money, yes. Your father has been spared from the mouth food for your music lessons. If money is more important than music, then you better stop playing. Listen with your heart and focus on your music. My heart still has no ears? But a soul. Where is Abrascha? - He's grounded. He had quarreled with his father because of our classes here. We did not know that your father pays for it. Yes, but I just... I thought we could be friends. Using the music That song is beautiful. Come on girls, let's get started. It's about friendship. Stop, stop, stop. Dvorak Humoresque called this piece. Why do you play it legato? You need to turn on the powerful tones. Grazioso. I also had trouble with that piece. I Will it happen? And the composition is finished already? - Abrascha and I have an appointment. This piece is for real friends. Only they can hear it. Larissa and I were wondering if you sometimes can hear it already. Are you serious? I want to show you something. To me they do not come. How do you do that? Hanna, you are the goddess of fish. The Fuehrer, who today finally his silence has been broken... Has the fate of Europe in the hands of the German soldiers laid . The fight against the red leaders in Moscow is of decisive historical importance. The Luftwaffe bombed the Russian army. The German army on 22 June, at three o'clock in the morning... the advance of enemy troops halted . This can not be right? Hitler and Stalin have a non-aggression pact signed. The neutrality was guaranteed. - Surely it can also Stalin's fault? What does this all mean? We do not know yet, Hanna. And you better go home. Hitler wants to expand to the east and the Russian intelligentsia eradicate. The Führer represents German interests. Also ours. I run blindly at the Fuehrer when he offered me this directorship. Now we live on the front. - We can go back, right? The consulate shall determine that we can go back home. The NKVD will hunt us. We are now the enemy. What is that? The NKVD? A kind police. - Police? These are the executioners of the party. I'm going to go to the brewery. - Is not that dangerous? Then I go along. The Red Army is highest state of alert. It is war. What consequences does this have for us? Alexei, who is today all come to work? Approximately half. Should I send them home? Who wants to work can work. I have not declared war. I have to go to the consulate. I'll see you around. Daddy, why is Germany Russia? I do not know. Yesterday Hitler and Stalin were still friends. We'll come home, I promise you. This is still our home? And everyone likes us. The war rages now here. Reich consulate Move. - Colonel Tapilin, we would... Crouch. Tapilin Can not ask for help? He ​​has never been averse to bribes. Another reason to shoot us. We need to bring Hanna in safety. No, we must stick together. Hanna, come along soon. Comb the whole house. Yuri, you know the kitchen. Boris, upwards. - Mama, I'm afraid. What is it? No one at home? Not here -. Come on, get out. We stay together, I promise. Tomorrow morning we will discuss everything. That doctor Brodsky. Hello, here we are. Sorry to come so late, but Tapilin and the NKVD coming. They are already gone. -. Then you're in luck They'll be back. You must leave the city. We have to think of something. Do you have a place where you can hide the time being? Is this space really never used? - Only Alexi and I have a key. Connect us. There should be nothing suspicious appearing to the lock. Do not worry, we soon along. That God may protect you. And come back in one piece. I'm counting on you, boy. We go to the front and I do not know whether I before even go home. Do not tell anyone. Really no one. If Tapilin discovered that we help the Reich family... Our lives we no longer certain. Appearance after tomorrow they should have the same amount. In Germany we were safe. - Do not be naive. We were here before the idiot chased the world to himself in the harness. If we survive this, I'm leaving you. I still wanted to never go to Russia. And who is the leader here? Is someone there? What is it? Colonel Tapilin of the NKVD. We are looking for Max Reich. Can he have hidden here somewhere? That seems stiff. I would have noticed. He has enriched our harvest, which capitalist. The language of the so-called superior race. That is over now. Max Reich, our country and spied information channeled to the fascists. If we grab him, he gets the ball. And everyone who helps him. Understood? - Of course, Comrade Tapilin. Come on. We need eastward for the Germans here. I heard they are already approaching 200 kilometers Poltava. I can not just leave everything here. I have to think about my patients. Boris , you said yourself that our lives at risk if the Germans... You're right. I got it. What do Germans against Jews? The Reichs are still our friends? Some Germans are not as nice as the Reichs. I am. Abrascha. If you have some time to go? It is an old hunting lodge. I 'm discovered when tracking. I come here often with Larissa. For the rest, nobody knows it. And? What do you think? I do not know how to thank you. It can go well and think positive feelings back to us. Thanks. What do you do if the Germans... When the war reached Poltava? My family goes tomorrow to the east, far away from the Germans. I try to stop them. My unit goes to the west. Not send your family away? I can borrow money. That makes no sense, there are no train tickets to get more. I want to say goodbye to Larissa. You can not go to the station. - Yes I do with you? Please. We should go. - I'll pick you up. Abrascha will take care of you. It may take weeks for the Wehrmacht there. As already coming. Comrade Brodsky, you must back to the hospital. I'll take it from here. Go on, get out of here. Hurry up. Get out. Take care of yourself. Once the hospital is evacuated, I travel chase you. You do not. The train was packed. - We have tickets. Let them boarding. I am a member of the Central Committee and I demand that you leave them boarding. For you there is still a place. Get in, we'll be taking off. For the others do not. Go home to rehearse for the concert at the hospital. The brave soldiers of Poltava deserve. And do not forget to take along a teacher. - That the devil may get Tapilin you. The devil is only interested in those who believe in god. God will protect us. We must fight for what we love. That will remain so. Larissa, close the curtains. Hello, I'm Hanna Reich. - Who lived here for a very long time. And I think she's not coming back soon. I'm thirsty. Could I possibly a glass of that delicious lemonade? Who do I have to do first. And apples out of the basement. Please. Right then. How sweet of you. Thank you. It all comes out of your pantry. We may sleep tonight if that's okay. This is in any case better than trips to the station. Can I? Here's never gonna be somebody. - Then you have to go inside. It is high time to finish our friendship song. Indians made such a mark if they had spotted a predator. Do you really discovered an animal? Is that because of the war? If the Russians flights, the Germans around. There you are at last. It's all ready. Dad, we have to tell you something. In the forest we saw... is not all that bad. My chief. Most importantly I'm alive. Yet I am left-handed. Sorry, but we have really begin. Daddy, why do they do that? They want to show how cruel they can be. Look there. Germans. We're saved. Stop. Helga, be careful now. - Hello. We are Germans. - Do not shoot. Becker, what is it? My husband Max and my daughter Hanna. I'm Helga Reich, that's my husband Max and daughter Hannah. And I Stand Arte Führer Schwartow. Nice to meet you. War Injury? - No, sports injury. Winter Games in 1936 in Garmisch. Skiing. Are you the Max Reich? How wonderful to meet you here. I can pretty skiing, but not as good as you . What are you doing here on earth? Hold on tight. If the commander comes, you have to laugh. What is going on here? The stage is cleared for the new rulers. Do you know what day it is? - A sad day. I must ensure how the fascists occupied my country. And many compatriots find that even fine. I do not mean. Our concert in America. Carnegie Hall. We now had to stand. As you probably still sometimes act on. Do not lose hope. Come on, come on. Come on. Walk. Come on, move. There is Hanna. You can greet friends better afterwards. Thanks Abrascha and Larissa we escape the Russians. Well done. And how? Abrascha had a cabin in the woods found and there they brought us food. They deserve an award for. Never mind. Stand Arte Führer Schwartow understand what you mean. We also play together. I do not know any better musicians. They have already performed in large halls. Once Comrade Stalin was even present. I would like you's want to hear you play. I love art and culture. Is that regulate? I'd like nothing better. Although the Jews? What Mr. Schwartow of us need? - No idea. So he called Stand Arte Führer Schwartow. - Stand Arte Fuhrer? What a strange word. Mr. Reich. Hanna, I've heard that you can play well. Violin Come here. A perfect musician needs a perfect tool do not you think? Open it. This is from Cremona. Play something for us once you have voted him. The Sixth Army is stationed here and that takes a lot of beer. This is good for morale. - I will do my best. You are not rich, Mr. Reich. Incredibly rich. Schumann. I hear it right away. I ever wanted to be an opera singer. Siegfried. Beautiful. You can keep it. - Such an expensive present I can not accept. Your daughter is playing really fantastic. Well, I certainly did a dozen lie. This is worth a fortune. How did you get this? I've been given a gift Stand Arte Führer Schwartow. He has more. Perhaps you also get one. Pleasant. - Good evening. There is Krystyna already with the beer. Unfortunate fact that the racial doctrine of the culture does not spare. Can a war be the reason to sweep the culture of a people away? I say it like this. You should not build the world, but dominate. Can I have him? Are you looking at this violin from Cremona's good. This is not a German violin, but she is now German owned. I see it differently. Something not yours, you can not give it away. Why Germany is also sufficient pressure with conquering the world. So he's all ours. Krystyna just made lemonade in the kitchen. Do you want another beer? - A German beer? Always. The Indian shaman shares such stones to the young warriors. This is called a strength amulet. - Power Amulet? That sounds funny. When in danger it was hard to express you get strength. Grab your amulet in hand and close your eyes. Now stretch your other hand. That means that we are brother and sister. All three. Forever and ever. No one can not change anything. Not Schwartow not., And the war We promise each other. All Jews from Poltava fifty years and over... should at least 4 hours gather this afternoon at the station. Should give to this call all parties involved. I repeat all Jews aged fifty and over... should at least 4 hours gather this afternoon at the station of Poltava. Where's Grandpa? Do you just let him go? We still had to hide him? Jew You can not leave, Grandma. - Make me well not harder. Tell them to stay here. Irina, where are you going? - I'm over 50. Please stay. Larissa, I have closed my heart. Whatever happens, you should always be understood for your music? Remain in the car. Grandma Polina. - Grandfather. Why was Irina remain, but Larissa's grandma and grandpa's Abrascha not? No idea, but Schwartow has promised that nothing will happen to them. Where the train is actually going? I really do not know. I have to go. Jews may no longer show this time around on the streets. My wife will be back, I'll bring you. - I really do not. Say prodigy, what's in there? - Just keep walking. I asked you, Jew. Dirty Jewish whore. Walk quickly. If Mr. Reich gives you something, he hears you bring home. The prodigies. You'd have to go to the east. You too. This is our homeland. According Schwartow the elderly represent only the first wave treatment. We can not let that happen. Mr. Brodsky, the more I could not get it as soon together. I'll be back tomorrow. Please. - Thank you. What will that do? In Kiev brewery should arise. Command commander. Sober you certainly do not win this rotten war. Schwartow want you to go. - Why can not I come? We are back after tomorrow. Do not worry. Krystyna will take care of you. Can Abrascha and Larissa come? Sweetheart. Their families are hiding. I do not know where, but it goes well with them. I'm thirsty. - Mr. Reich could come anytime. How nice that you join us. Your commitment to the League of German Maidens in Berlin is sorely missed. Before I forget to say: On 7 October Reichsführer Himmler year. In honor of him a party given in the theater. Beautiful room. Ever been? Hanna, that would be the ideal opportunity... Our Reichsführer with your new violin bring. An aubade They would rather do nothing. - Naturally. If you drive past the brewery yet? I have to do something. Unfortunately, we can not let the generals wait. It is very important. What is more important than the German victory? Driving. Those Germans can brew excellent. What are you thinking? To us more. And the fish. And Hanna. Why is Hanna suddenly our enemy? Because adults are stupid. Poltava there is better to become now all Jews are gone. The Germans are right. You know what you should do. Jews with What do we do with the Jews? - You make them by hand. Goodnight. Do not forget to brush your teeth. What would be wrong with Mr. Reich? Why does not he come? Something happened. Otherwise he had been there a long time. If we do not do something soon, we will not survive. Do you know what the benefit is here? I can drink as much as I want, without my wife show me the door. I just try it. Beware well. Street Germans patrolling with their Ukrainian henchmen. You stay here. - Let him go. During the revolution there were a lot of guys like him. It takes courage to fight for what you love . Miss Hanna, what are you doing here? Very good, boy. You just have to unlock the weapon first. You must help us, Alexi. Please. - Please. How? First we have to take her home. - talk to Him, go ahead. Jesus... if I don't... if I cheat on her... Oh, sh... Go, I ain't here, I'm invisible. This is it, man, you got a problem. Hold on. Look at you. - Surprise. - Yvette. - Hey, sis. - Hey. I wasn't expecting you 'til next week. It's Yvette, how you doing? Yeah, well, I thought I'd surprise you. You know, I had to fly in to cover the game last minute with the flu bug going around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good to see you. You don't mind if I crash, do you? Come on, stop it, of course, I'll get your room ready. Let me get you something to drink first. - Okay. - What you want? Um, some water. - Water it is. - Yes. I must say, sis, I'm pretty proud of you. Got the new job at the network, huh? Oh, thank you. My sister's a sportscaster. I've been watching all your stuff online. I saw that piece you did on concussions in the NFL. Really? It was pretty stellar, kind of stellar. I've been, uh... I've been following you too. Wow. - Jarvis. - Yeah. I didn't expect to see you here. Well, I should have known you two are joined at the hip. Yeah, you know, I was trying to tell him about boundaries and stuff, you know what I'm saying? A healthy friendship has good boundaries and stuff. But he don't listen. - See a real relationship... - Okay, you know what, um let me get your bag and, um you guys can talk. - How's the weather? - So... - Eat your... - How's... Sorry. All right, um, I guess it's been a while. Yeah, it's been a minute. Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm... I know I didn't call and everything but, I mean the last time we spoke, - things kind of ended... - Yeah, I know, I understand. It's okay. I mean, I flew a thousand miles away and you didn't find it good to call me and check on me. No, "Yvette, how you doing?" Or maybe, "I'm sorry. " After all this time, you still can't apologize. You know, maybe I should just go. No, no, no, no, no, no. You stay, I'll go. Yvette I'm sorry. Thank you. How hard was that? L... I gotta go, 'cause, you know... Well, give me a hug. - For real? - Yes. Give me a hug, stop playing. - For real? - Stop it. - See? - Yeah. See, we can at least be friends. We... Friends? I think friends is a good idea. I think, yeah, this... Oh, that feels friendly, that's friendly. Oh, yeah, ooh, yeah, that's... That's... Oh, whoo! Hey, hi, girl! Hey, hey, um, have fun! How you doing, baby? You got the nerve to cheat on me with a cute girl? Hello, I'm Yvette, Elston's sister. - Uh-huh. - She cute. You know what, I should kill you right where you stand. After all I done for you. Wait, it's not like that, we're just old friends. Yeah, yeah, just listen to her. Just old friends. Listen here, baby girl, old friends don't embrace like that. - That's right. - You know, my mama was right. You can't trust a man as far as you can throw him. You ain't nothing but some two-timing no-good fool. Look, we were just... we just friends... I'm just visiting... I'm just visiting with her. - Just visiting? - Yes! Hey, hey, hey, what's all the commotion in here? It's just Raven, you know, acting out again. I'm gonna show you acting out. - You know what... - Take that out of my house. - I will see y'all, good night. - It was lovely seeing... And you know what? You stay away from my man. We're happy. Okay, thank you. - Good night. - Close the door behind you. Boy, I tell you. Should we be calling the police? No, that's them two all the time. Lucky there weren't no blood. He'll be all right in the morning. Am I safe here? What you mean, are you safe here? Big bro got your back, of course. Yeah, just like old times, huh? - Of course. - Um-hm. Mom did always say for you to look out for me no matter what. Yeah, she was always talking about keeping family first, huh? Yeah. I miss her. Yeah, not a minute goes by I don't... think about her, you know? Yeah. Only God knows why he needed her up there. Amen, sister. - I missed you. - It's good to see you. - Are you hungry? - Starving. Okay, we need to go out, sis. - I have no food here. - Clearly. - Somebody knocking. Yvette: Yeah. Hey, uh... Oh, sorry, Elston, good to see you. Come on in here, baby. - You know my wife. - Of course. Good to see you. Listen, um, don't mean to barge in on you. We were on our way to a jazz club and there's a big accident on the Kennedy Expressway so decided to take your exit. - Got a bottle of the bubbly. - Okay. Thought I'd share it with you. We're so sorry to intrude. - This was not my idea. - That's nonsense. You guys are welcome. Make yourself at home. And who is this lovely young lady? This is my sister Yvette. You met her last year at the Christmas party. Yes, I remember. You still look smashing. Well, thank you. Yes, you're very cute. Thank you. Oh, my... What's wrong? I was just caught off guard by the size of your feet. Damn. Please, don't take offense. L... It just startled me. Me a little bit too. Um, we better pop the cork on that bottle. I'll do the honors. Oh, look, allow me, I got it. Ah, Elston. Bathroom? You know, this thing got a mind of its own. Hello, yes. Excuse me. Yes, I can follow the team to Dallas. Yes, yes... Young man, would you mind helping a damsel in distress? No problem. Thank you. So, you know, some things require a strong young man's touch. Whoo, ah-ha-ha. I'm getting a raise. What are you doing here, Sheila? Hello-ho-ho. The question is, what are you doing here? I was just helping her, okay, relax. Yeah, look like you was helping yourself. Bag, please. Mr. Randall asked me come by and drop off these files after I came back home from my card game. Oh-ho-ho, I went blind seven. I'm set, baby. I won 50 bucks. Amen and amen. Whoo. Elston, uh... I hope I didn't tear it up too badly, man. Baby... I cannot eat any more of those burritos from that cantina. It just tore my stomach apart. Yeah, maybe we should get a move on it. Looks to me like somebody else has got a move on while you were gone. What does she mean by that? Oh, no, no, no, my tongue, it just gets loose, you know, when I get to sipping at those card games. Don't pay me no mind. You know, my tongue gets even looser when my pocketbook is lighter. Thank you very much. Your generosity is "muchly" appreciated. It's gonna go to a good cause. Here are you files. Oh, thank you. I didn't see nothing. Goodbye, Sheila. What's that all about? I think... you need to cut her hours. She got a couple screws loose. Don't we all. Listen, baby, why don't we have a little champagne? We just got here. Sit back and relax. Yeah, but, you know, maybe we should go. I'm feeling a little flushed. Just... a little flushed. Okay. Yeah, um... Maybe you guys should take a rain check, you know. You don't want her feeling weak and then you guys have an accident or something. Yeah, when I feel like this, I tend to be a little reckless. Okay, okay, buttercup. Whatever you want. We'll get you home and get you wrapped up, okay? Thank you. Can't keep my hands off of you. Hey, listen, um... - sorry we're leaving so soon. - No problem. But I left the bottle of champagne for you. And I'll see you in the office tomorrow, son. See you tomorrow, sir. - Let's go, baby. - Okay. - See you in the morning. - Come on, baby. According to this report, this should be a no-brainer. The trucker's blood alcohol level was well above the legal limit when he hit her. I don't know, man, what kind of monetary value can you put on a pinkie toe? Same as any toe. No, no, not necessarily. I mean, I don't know if the jury's gonna see it like that. You see, now, a pinkie toe probably should cost a little considerably less. I mean, no, a big toe, yeah, big toe... bucks, I understand that. But with a pinkie toe? Let bygones be bygones. What kind of open-toe shoes a 70-year-old woman gonna wear anyway? That pinkie toe is long gone. It's dead, forget about it. Sometimes I wonder what goes on in that head of yours. Look, I just say the things that people are scared to say. You say the things that scare me for you as well as future generations. I... I guess I'm just tripping, man. I've been going through some stuff lately, dude. This woman's crazy, dude, I... She's putting stuff on the stove, heating it up and everything. She's on some medieval stuff right now. I can't handle it, man, I don't know what's going on. Yeah, she got issues. Yeah, she got issues, but what does it say about me? I'm still with her. Why don't you stand up for yourself, man? You weren't like that in college. Yeah, I know. I know, I know, I guess I... Guess I lost my mojo a little bit, man. Yeah, it's like you lost your confidence after you didn't get drafted. You remember what happened, dude? I'm sitting there waiting to get drafted. The agent snatches the chicken wing right out of my mouth. Just like that, you know? In front of my friends, my family members. I had the whole party set up, it was embarrassing, dude. I remember, I had to pay half the bill. That was the most humiliating day of my life. Hands down. It was just... humiliating. You was a loser, too. Yes, you know what? My grandmother even called me a loser. You're not a loser, man. Look, you're... you're... look, you're a junior lawyer. Come on. I'm a junior lawyer. Yes, and now you probably should leave. You know what? On that note, I'm just gonna get out of here, man. - I got some things to take care of. - All right. - You can finish up yourself. - Shake it off, buddy. Junior lawyer. Uh what are you doing here? - Shh! Look... No, listen, about last night, uh... Shh. I was totally in the wrong. Don't say not another word. It was my fault. Sometimes I just... I just don't think straight. No, it's okay, I know what you mean. Listen, let's just promise each other that it won't happen again. No harm, no foul, right? - Agreed. - Agreed. Now I think it would be in your best interest to clear the premises 'cause you do not want to let Sheila catch you here. You know how she is. I slipped her a 20 on the way in. She's looking out for me. Ah, the power of money, I love it. See, that's just it, Elston. I thought that money would make me happy. I thought that it would make me love him more but it didn't. I ended up marrying for all the wrong reasons and when I look at you, it just reminds me that, um... Yeah, listen, um... I'm not sure I wanna have this conversation now. He's my boss and he's been really good to me. All right? You think you know that man? You don't. That man, he is greedy and he is low-down. - Okay... - He built this firm on the backs of loyal, hard-working, dedicated people like you. He's just like his father and his grandfather. Okay, listen. He's your husband, all right. Yes, and that's why I have the right to tell the truth. Okay, I'd really rather not have this conversation, all right? All right, maybe you're right. I'm sorry to bother you. It's no problem. He's coming down the hall. If you want me to fake a seizure, it'll be an extra 40 bucks. - It's not necessary. - You sure? I talked myself out of two speeding tickets that way. Works like a charm. Come on, girl, now you... No, no, no, you are not about to pay my bills if I lose this job. Now come on, get your stuff, get your bags together. Come on, get out of here, get out! Look... everything's gonna come to the light. You're gonna see the truth. Yeah, baby, yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah, I just went to the bathroom. That's all I did. I know, I should have called you on my cell phone, but, yeah, it takes a little longer 'cause they didn't have paper towels. And you know I don't like to air dry. I can't go back to my desk soggy. Sweet... No, no, I didn't. Okay, number two. Are you happy? No, I didn't go talk to the Human Resources lady. No, you messed that up for me, yeah, you did. Yeah, you remember, you called in a bomb threat. Yeah, now she's scared to death. Yeah, every time she see me, yeah, she runs in the opposite direction. Imagine Flo Jo on the 47th floor in kitten heels, just going that way. That's what happens. Yeah, un-huh. Yeah, okay, look, baby, I'm gonna call you back, okay? Yeah, in 10.4 minutes. Yeah, I'll call you back, I promise. I know you're counting. Okay, love you. He dumped me! Who... who, Charles? The married guy. Yeah, he said I should've known that what we had was just temporary. Just for fun. Ohh... I feel so used. Oh, ooh, oh. I mean, ooh, don't cry. Oh, oh, the pain, I can feel the pain from... Don't cry. Come on, ooh, come on, just... I know, even trampolines need love too. I hate to say I told you so, Sheila. - But I told you so. - Gee, thanks. Well, what... Well, what do you want me to say? What do you expect for me to say? When you're wrong, you're wrong, Sheila. You can't be going around wrecking people's homes, wrecking this, wrecking that. In the words of the immortal Ice Cube: # You better check yourself # # Before you wreck yourself # # You better check yourself... ## You can't even understand. You can't. No. I never had no one to love me, okay? My father left me and my mother when I was eight years old. Do you know what it's like to cry yourself to sleep at night because you miss somebody so much? Do you wonder? You ever wonder why somebody doesn't love you? No, no, you don't. So you just need to shut your mouth! That's enough now. I know what it feels like to hurt. I know what it feels like to have a spicy chicken wing ripped out of your mouth when you don't make the draft. And you know what? I know what it's like to pay the bill at that dinner at that draft. You know how embarrassing that is? You know how hard it is to go back to the block where you ain't got drafted? Now I'm here dealing with you and everything. I know about that pain. I deal with that pain every day. But you know what, I know God's got my back. God don't like ugly. So of course you're gonna have a little harder time than most. You are, I'm just saying. But still, you gotta get down on your knees. You gotta get down on your knees and pray. Hallelujah, Honda Civic, Osama Bama. Yes, you gotta get down on your knees and you got to pray, all right? You know, I just... You know what, I'm gonna get back to work because if I get to preaching around here, I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost. Y'all ain't gonna hear me up in this piece. You know, I'm gonna go off. Whoo, Lord, Jesus, amen... Sheila. Can you hold all my calls please? Uh, Yeah, Mr. Rand... hey, how you doing? You need some coffee, take your coat, anything? Yeah, I need a coffee with three Splendas. Okay, three Splendas, all right, and so, uh... three Splendas, so Jarvis Brown getting your coffee. Remember Jarvis Brown, 'cause I get the coffee. Go this way, all right now... Can you have Elston meet me in my office? I need to have a very personal conversation with him. Oh, yes, sir. Remember, Jarvis Brown, coffee, anytime. Got ya, I'll be right back. Oh, he knows. He knows, he knows everything. - Did you open your big mouth? - I can't believe it, I can't believe it. - My money supply's gonna dry! - I didn't do anything. - What if I die, what if I die? - I didn't do anything. Take it to the grave, man. Take it to the grave, that's that I always say, man. That's it, I'm telling you right now... You've been so good to me. I can't believe he's gonna kill you. First you're gonna get fired. Oh, no, I'm gonna miss you so much, Elston. Where's he at? He said for you to meet him in the conference room. All right, conference room it is. Oh, Elston... after you get killed, since I know the combination to your safe can I have that $1,500... please? I'm saving for a beauty procedure. Ooh. Okay, Mom, can you just sing the first part for me? Yeah, I'm stressed out right now. Everybody here is crazy. Yeah, okay, just sing it like you used to. I'll sing with you. Okay, okay. # Twinkle, twinkle # # Little star ## Yeah, uh, yeah, like I was saying, I just punched him in the face. You know, that's what we do, we slap people for fun. Yeah, that's what we do here at the law firm. Yeah, uh-huh, all right, okay, I gotta go. Yo... what's up, man? I'll tell you later. I ain't seen your face long like that since you punched a cheerleader for stealing your dance moves. That was you, not me. Oh, yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah. I would've left him alone too if he didn't take my signature spin move. She's not answering. Listen, tell Yvette I'm not gonna be able to make lunch. I got something I need to handle. Okay, boss, no problem. Mom, you still there? # Ooh-ooh-ooh... ## Mr. Trace, I need to talk to you. Have a seat. No, sir, I'd rather stand. I'd rather you sit. I'd rather stand, sir. Young man, have a seat. Please. What is it? - Well, sir, I... - Wait, son, let me stop you. I know exactly what you wanna say, okay? Sir... Son, let me stop you. I wanna talk to you about something that's very dear to my heart. I know, that is why I want to talk... Listen. This firm has been the cornerstone of this community for over a decade. And I'm very proud of that. And I don't make any decisions in here that are not in the best interests of this firm, even when it's personal. Right, sir. So I've decided I've decided to, uh... interview for the... Vice President of Operations position. It doesn't mean you're not gonna get the job. It just means I think we may go with somebody a little bit more qualified. More qualified? I put my blood, sweat and tears in this place for a decade. I know you did. Long hours, no vacations. How can you tell me "more qualified"? ! That's my position. Son, I've been watching you and you've been walking around here with your... your chest poked out, like you're the big gun, like you're the top gun, like you're running things around here. Like I owe you something. Can I ask you a question? Do I owe you something? Now, son, you're not ready. Maybe you'll be ready in a few years. But you're not ready now. So I'll have my decision in a few weeks. I don't have any words right now. Sometimes no words is the best answer. Can I go? I have some work to do. You know, I have to go pick up that Simmons check. You know, she's getting a half a million dollars for a pinkie toe? Do you know how much she could've got for a big toe? You know what? If you threw in a hand and a foot she could clean up. Listen... it's gonna be fine. God... Oh... Charles, can you please stop sending me directly to your voice-mail and call me back? Please? What are you doing here? He just walked out. I was listening at the door. I guess you were right, I... I tried to warn you. I have to admit it, I... I just don't think you understand what I did for that man. Win all those cases. Long hours. I haven't had a vacation in five years. Three days after my mother passed I was back at work. I deserve that promotion. Elston, you're an attorney. You know you don't get in life what you deserve. You get what you negotiate. When he needed you, you should've just talked to him. Now that you need him, you don't have a leg to stand on. It's your husband, though, what do I do, like... Let me just talk to him. You know, pillow talk does wonders. You would do that? Yeah. I appreciate it. Come here, I can make you feel better. No, it's... No... Look, don't say no. That's your problem. You're always looking out for somebody else and how they feel. You need to focus on yourself. Elston, I know you want to. Everybody needs somebody. Come here. - Let me make you feel better. - Vanessa... Shh. Oh! I'm sorry to intrude. I guess I should have knocked. Well, yeah. I almost forgot you was here. The last time that Elston had a woman at his house the Bulls were winning the championship. I know you was doing the cabbage patch and everything... Okay, okay, I forgive you. So what you watching? A special on the greatest NFL defenses of all time. Hmm, okay. Okay, who would you pick: The '86 Bears or the '76 Steelers? Uh, okay, that's a good question. Well, you know, everybody knows that I'm a hardcore Bears fan... but I'm gonna have to discreetly go with the Steel Curtain on this one. You know, you can't beat that total dominance on the field. Right, right. Okay, as usual, I agree with you. You are the expert, so, you know. Please, you're a walking sports encyclopedia. Well, it is kind of impressive up there sometimes. You know what I'm saying, but you know. - I just use it for sports, you know. - Stop it. You know everything. You know, that's one of the things that I love about you. - Really? - Yeah. You're such a smart man. - Smart man. - Mm-hmm. Uh... I should go call my mama. Jarvis, stop. Ooh, I mean... You know what, see, that right there. That right... that's what I like. Me and you, we can talk. You know, we just... it's easy. It's not complicated, it's like... And you don't try to change me. Didn't. I didn't try to change you. Didn't try to change me. Yeah, just like you... didn't have to break up with me. You didn't. I mean, you had me crying in the shower. I was singing Freddie Jackson songs. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I mean, it was... Okay, let's not dwell on the past, okay? I mean, sometimes people come into your life for a season. Yeah. Only God knows why. You know, my pastor, he preached a great word on the season of change in life last week. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Well, maybe you could help me with this. What do you do when someone you thought you loved turns out that you don't actually love them at all. Pray about it. I mean, the best thing I can tell you is to be honest with yourself. Be honest with her. But... you know my relationship with God. You know how I feel about it. I mean, with her... she doesn't see eye-to-eye about that. I mean, she hates organized religion. Well, pray for her and let the Holy Spirit deal with that. I mean, look... you... you should just love her and lead by example. You should let her see what He has done in your life. Wow. You see... this is why I dream about you so often. - Okay, stop... - No, I do. I mean, I be dreaming... I'll be asleep... - Dream about you. - Stop it. I mean, because you always have the right answers. Everything you say is just... it's magical. I mean, to be honest with you, lately I've been having these nightmares and, like, really scary... - Nightmares? - Nightmares! For real, like in the daytime, at my desk, just nightmares, and you're never in them. You're always in the good dreams. Okay, please. Spare me the details. All right, whatever, whatever. All right, well... Elston said he can't make it for lunch so, uh, how's about a hug? Uh, behave yourself. Come on, get your bigfoot over here and give me a hug now. Give me a hug. Fine. Oh, you crushed my toe. Just please stop it. All right. Keep talking about my feet. Hey, I'm not, you know, it is what it is, you know, hey. - You know I love you, right? - Mm-hm. But, uh, seriously, um thanks for the advice. Anytime. Bye. Bye. Woman: Ooh, child. I heard you in here just-a crying and a-sniffling. It can't be that bad, can it? No, I'm sorry. Can I help you? Oh, I'm Mrs. Simmons. - You know, pinkie toe. - Oh... oh. I'm sorry for your loss. Oh, don't be silly. I'm here for my check. God done took that toe back, child. Ain't nothing I can do about that. Well, Mr. Randall, he went to pick it up. He insisted that he do it in person and deliver it to you. See, that's why I called this firm right away as soon as I had that accident. The personal service. His grandfather was like that too, you know. Well, it's the least we can do, considering... Honey, don't feel sorry for me. Feel sorry for yourself but that man better hurry up and come on because I'm late for my tango class. - Shoot. - Tango? What part of "tango" don't you understand? The "tang" or the "go"? See, that's what's wrong with you young people. You're running around here upset because your life ain't going the way you want. That's because you're not grounded in the word. You don't know how God operates. Honey, life is like a parade. You standing on the street watching but God is way up top looking down. He's in the beginning of the parade and the end of the parade. But you came. That's why we have to have faith, sister. Well, is that... Is that why He makes us feel pain? The Bible says: "Weeping endures for a night "but joy... joy cometh in the morning" Hallelujah! Try Him. Ask Him. Ask Him to reveal Himself to you. Ask Him to give you the strength so that you can endure. And you'll see. All things come together for good for those who love the Lord. That's why God let me lose this toe so I could be a blessing to somebody. See, I'm leaving most of this money for some college scholarships. Oh. Oh, yes, God had a plan, honey. Whoa, that is so generous of you. Oh, that ain't nothing, I didn't do nothing. God did it all. And this ain't nothing. My parents were junkies. Left me on a housekeeper's doorstep when I was ten. Hurt like hell. But then one day I picked up that Bible and I learned that I could not dwell in the past. My future was up to me. I couldn't let somebody else's stupid decisions impact my thoughts. I couldn't let all that anger and hurt control my life. 'Cause I knew I was somebody. - And you know why? - Why? 'Cause my Heavenly Father said so. He loves me just the way I am. I just had to learn to see myself the way God sees me and someone He loved enough to give His life for. Thank you for your kind words. Well, I'm gonna run out of kind words if that man don't hurry up and get here soon. You gonna see the soft side come right on up out of me, child. I'm going to my tango lesson. Hey, look, I know that she's your sister and everything and you're probably the last person I need to be talking to about this but, look, man, I haven't felt this way in a long time. She's woken up something inside of me. I'm so confused. It must be going around. You know, I can feel it deep down in my heart. I can feel that little love and I just... You know what, I should confess. No, I can't confess, that would be a nightmare. You know, usually I always got somebody to talk to about this but, you know, my mama, she got that samba dance-off tonight so that's a no-go. - I gotta get out of here. - What? Cover for me. - Hey, uh, okay. - Cover for me. Some friend you are. Oh. Lord, Lord! Lord, I know it's been a while. It's been a long, long while but I can't do this no more. I'm empty. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm... give it all to you and see what you have in store for my life. I'm through with married men. I'm not dating no more of them and I'm through with all of that nonsense. And I'm gonna stop trying to cover up the pain with material things and improper relationships I know ain't going nowhere. I'm just trusting you and I'm gonna give it to you, Lord. I'm gonna give it all to you. Amen. Amen. You're moving up in the corporate world. No more of this mom-and-pop nonsense. Yeah, you're right. You gotta be the lion in the jungle that roars. Look, I say you let him work for you another year or two... then maybe you'll reconsider after the merger. Maybe a promotion, maybe not. Now remember what we talked about. I don't... I don't want to tell any of the other senior lawyers that I'm going to put $500,000 bonus aside for them, okay? - Mm-hmm, you're the boss. - All right, until after the merger. And I've already put Elston's money aside, okay? How do you know he won't take this money and start his own firm and take a couple of your clients or two? I say reconsider. That's why I love you 'cause you're so cunning and you're so shrewd. Love you too. Give me a kiss. You better go. I'll talk to you later. I need to talk to you, Jarvis. Do I have a choice? Not really. Okay, I'll just do what I do best. I'll get talked at. You see... that right there is exactly my point. I have done everything, everything to try to get over what you did to us. To help us stay together. But I have so much anger and pain towards you and I don't know how to let it go. Look, I've been through therapy. I've been down to the church. I've cried in front of the whole congregation. Just, I had... I'm crying like Jimmy Swaggart in front of a whole church for you. To show you that I'm sorry. But... it's not enough. I've asked God for forgiveness. But that doesn't matter. I really need your forgiveness. You had no right... You had no right... to hurt me like that, Jarvis. What do you want? What do you want, hmm? You think I'm supposed to take this punishment day in after day, huh? Do you want blood? Raven, do you want blood? Well, here, here. - I'll take blood. - No, I don't want blood, Jarvis. Take it, you want blood. Obviously you do. - Obviously you do because you... - No. You know what? Look, I know that you're not in love with me anymore. And you know how I know? That's not true. 'Cause you used to have a light in your eyes every time you looked at me. And that light has gone out, Jarvis. Why? Why? Because you've taken that light and you've chewed it out of me. You know, do you even know who I am anymore? Look, I... I'm a social butterfly. I like to get out, I like to socialize with people. I like to see and get to know the world. I tried to take you to church. You didn't want to do that. I tried to pray with you, you don't want to do that. What am I gonna do now? I can't... I can't go on like this. - I'm sorry... - No, you're not sorry. Because I know when that light went. I saw it when you looked at her. Do you even love me anymore? Come on with this... Do you even love me? What kind of question... what kind of question... - Just answer the question, Jarvis. - I... - I... - Don't. Just... just don't. I'll have my sister pack my things. - It doesn't have to end like this. - Don't! Don't. You should've thought about that when you slept with her. I'm sorry we didn't get to spend much time together. I mean, you've been working so much. I know. I feel so terrible. It's okay. I mean, I needed the quiet time. And plus, your couch is so comfortable. I could really move in. Well, you know, my couch is your couch. Listen, you need anything? You need some money or something or... Your baby sis is all grown up now. I can take care of myself. You make me feel so old. I cannot process how fast you're growing up. Well, we'll have plenty of time to talk about it - at the Super Bowl. - Yes, we will. 'Cause what man in his right mind would turn down free Super Bowl tickets, huh? Come here, give me a hug. Give me a hug. - I'm glad you came. - Yeah, me too. Um... I know I don't say this, but... - I've always looked up to you. - Aw. No, I do. When mom died... you were the strong one. You held us together. You're a hard-working and good man. An honest and Godly man. So please... don't change for anyone. Let me know if you need anything, all right? - I love you, too. - Okay. Do you think it would be okay if I stop by the office and tell Jarvis bye? Yes, yes, he's been texting me all day. Him and his girl finally split up for good so now's he's... Oh, okay, well, I will holler at you later. - Okay. - Yes. - See you at the Super Bowl. - Yes. - And I love you. - Love you too. - Yes, okay. - Drive... safe. I will. Whoo. What, you forgot your keys, huh? Wow. Yeah, I saw Sheila at the office. She said you'd be here. Amazingly, she didn't charge me this time because she said something about a building and a parade and God was on top of the building and... Yeah, um... You never know with Sheila. Yeah. Um... have a seat. Gladly. Can I, um, get you something to drink? No, that's okay. Oh, I saw your sister leaving out. I tried to duck behind the bushes and ended up twisting my ankle and ruining my shoes. Oh, wow, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. It's nothing Randall won't fix. Listen, um... about yesterday, I... About yesterday. You know, I... Yeah, kind of awkward, I just wasn't... Look, just hush. Don't say a word. Why don't you just relax and let's go with the flow and see where this takes us. Yeah. Don't be so stiff, Elston. Come on. You only live once. You know, I just... I just never... I never done anything like this before. I really don't know how to feel. I mean, you're on my mind all day. I can smell your perfume. I feel your touch when I close my eyes. Yeah. I think about you all day, too. I know how you feel. I just feel so guilty. - But at the same time... - It's kind of exciting. Trace, Trace and Trace. Well, sure. I'll transfer you right now. And God bless you. Excuse me, hi. I'm here for a meeting with Darion Jackson. Oh, well, why do you want to see Darion? Just being nosey. Well, I'm opposing counsel for Gladie Insurance. Kramer case. Now, y'all know y'all need to pay up. Now, come on. That woman ran smack into Mrs. Gladie while she was standing there minding her own business. Yes, minding her own business while backing up on a major street. Well, the woman has Alzheimer's. She gets confused. Now, how can you punish somebody like that? True, I'd be confused too if I was sending a text and eating curly fries at the same time. Well, see, now you gotta understand about the curly fries. You gotta eat 'em while they're hot. You're funny. Funny, funny like what? I'm here to amuse you, funny like what? Ha-ha, just kidding. You married? See a ring on my finger? Get you something. - Here's my card. - Oh. Oh, okay. Oh... Oh, yes, yes. He'll see you now. Last door on the left. - Nice meeting you, Sheila. - Likewise. Jarvis: I'm so glad I got her out of my mind. That's too much. Oh. - Are you busy? - Am I busy? No, I thought you left already. Have a seat, come on. Thanks. Um, yeah, I was on my way out but I thought I'd stop by. Well, I'm glad you did, I mean, I... Look, I'm sorry for all that stuff the other day with Raven. It's okay, no, no, no, really, it's okay. I mean, I can understand why a girl can get all crazy and angry over you. Well, you know, I've been known to break a few hearts from time to time... Okay, just like a man. - Don't know when to shut up. - A little too much? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, you know... So... So when you coming back? Ah, I'm not sure. You know me, always chasing that story. Yeah, I'm chasing you and you chasing your career. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um... I guess this is goodbye then. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - It's goodbye. - It's goodbye again. Yeah. Well, take care of yourself. Oh, you know me, always taking care of myself. Let's... I have an extra ticket to the Dallas game. Courtside. Courtside? Did I stutter? Yvette, look. Even though I would love... and when I say love I do mean love... the idea of getting rid of all my worldly possessions and following you to the ends of the earth. I just can't right now. I mean, God has called me to a life of integrity and that's how I gotta be. I mean, I can't honestly give 100% to this until I have closure with Raven. And, I mean, this is how I am. Better yet... that's how God made me. I understand. That's... that's another one of the qualities that I love about you. You serve it straight up. It's just a double-edged sword sometimes. Take care. Hey, Raven, yeah, hi, yeah, it's me. Okay, all right, look, look, look, I need to talk... I need to talk... let me, can I speak? Can I speak, though? I need to talk to you about something serious. Where are we going with this relationship? Like, I am not gonna be your punching bag forever. Yeah, I just don't wanna play games anymore. Are you interested in trying to make it work? So it's over? Well, let it be over then, all right. But, look, look, look, I want my SpongeBob onesie back. No, that's mine, that's nonnegotiable. Yeah, oh, yeah, that's mine. Jarvis, look... I miss you so much and I'm not leaving without you. Not this time. You don't have to. Courtside it is. - Okay, let's go. - Oh yeah, we're gonna be late. Oh, yeah! Andrew, you tell the most fascinating stories. I never would've guessed you were a war hero. Well, not exactly, I mean, I was a military lawyer and I served during wartime but... Sounds like a war hero to me. Okay, I'll take that. So how was your meeting? You guys drive a hard bargain around here but honestly, you have made it all worth it. Those words just flow out of your mouth so smoothly. Keep talking. What time's your lunch break? Now. Ohh, and, um... I know the perfect place. It's on me since we just took all of your money. - Come on. - All right. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. It's been a while since I was able to spend time with someone like this, you know? Yeah, a man like you, I'm sure you have plenty of women around. You know, actually... I'm not really the type to have a lot of women around. I'm more of a... one-woman type of guy, you know? Okay. See, why didn't I meet you first? This is terrible. I would've chose you any day. Uh, that makes me feel good... sort of. So it's getting kind of late. I think you better go back to the office. I have to go to the mall before Randall gets back home. When will I see you again? Again. You'll see me soon. Well, I hope so. Oh, speaking of soon, I talked to Randall about approving your promotion. - You did. - Mm-hmm. That's wonderful. Look, don't thank me yet but I convinced him to give you a bonus when the deal goes through. We need to make a little side deal. Of course, what is it? Well, when the deal goes through, I need at least half. Randall is so slick. See, he has me in this little prenup that's so ironclad shut. He treats me like I'm a teenager and I'm a grown woman. I need zeros behind my bank account. You know what I mean? I got you... I guess, you know, um... Well, since you got me the job, I guess I would owe you something, you know? Good, exactly. I knew you'd see it my way. So I'm gonna have my lawyer draw up the contracts. Contracts? Look, pumpkin, let's not get business and fun mixed up. Okay? You take care of me, I'll take care of you. # Say what you wanna # # What was I doing? # # You're a married woman # # I was so lonely # # I can't deny # # You're a married woman # # I was taught # # Better than that # # I am so ashamed # # You're my boss's wife # # Lord what shall I do? # # You are you # # I am me # # We are differently # # Different styles # # Different taste # # I'm not like you # # I'm not like # # You ## Let's sit down here a minute. Sure. - Ahh... - Ohh... Thank you for the wonderful lunch. Oh, but unfortunately, I have to get back to this hell hole. Well, I will admit, our firm is a lot bigger, nicer, more successful, of course, and clean but honestly, you should be happy because a lot of people wish they had jobs. Hmm, yeah, I guess... I guess you're right. But you... I used to work at a shoe department at Dillard's before I came here but I don't feel like going back to those stank feet and those stank attitudes all day. Mmm, I hear that. Well, hey, just as a side note, my firm Peterson, Lewis and Kramer is expanding into the Midwest and we are aggressively seeking new lawyers and talent so just wanna put that bug in your ear. Well, this bug is buzzing. But, you know... my boss has been real good to me and not a lot of bosses would give you a two-hour lunch break. Um, so, um... Will I see you... will I see you again? I don't mean to be rude, but that is a mighty stupid question. What's your credit score? 800. Well, I guess I'll call you later. - Mmm, you do that. - Un-huh. Sir, you want to see me? Yeah, have a seat. You've been knowing me a long time, am I right? - Yes, sir. - Good. I'm not gonna beat around the bush. What are you trying to accomplish by dealing with my wife? Sir, I'm not trying to accomplish... Save it, save it, save it. Your number came up on her cell phone. What's going on? Sir, there's nothing going on. Let me tell you something. I want you to really hear me. My wife is a nice lady. Young... naive, very kind. And whatever you're trying to do by going around me to get to her, - is not... - Sir... It's not going to work. You understand me? I'm the boss here. When I make decisions, they're final. You understand? So go back to your office and get to work. That's the last thing I'm gonna say. Out of all the days I choose to leave my wallet in my gym shorts I choose today to do it. It's okay. Gosh, they said we can get on the next flight out. Don't beat yourself up. Beat myself up? I've been beat up enough for the last few years. And you don't ever have to worry about me beating myself up. - Jarvis. - Um... oh, you know what? Have a seat, look. I gotta holler at Elston real quick. I left my SpongeBob pillowcase at his crib. I gotta get it. - I can't fly without it. - SpongeBob? Yeah, SpongeBob. - There we go. - I'll be back, babe. Okay, I'll be here. Okay. Come in. Elston, what's wrong? I came right over as soon as I got the message. Thank you for coming. You look upset, what's wrong? I should've never started this with you. Come on, don't tell me... - Listen. - You getting cold feet. We're just getting started. Vanessa, I've been putting my job on the line. I've been lying and deceiving people, walking around here. - This is not who I am. - What? You think I put a gun to your head and made you do this? - You wanted this just as bad as I did. - Vanessa... Vanessa, I can't do this! I cannot do this, this is not who I am. So you think it's that easy. You're just gonna stand right there and say that you're done? No, I'm not an old toy. You can't just toss me aside like I'm a piece of dirt! I never said you were an old toy, Vanessa. Listen... You're gonna listen to me and you're gonna do exactly what I say to do. Otherwise, I'm gonna ruin your career at this firm and you will never make another dime again. Now, Elston, I need you to sign that contract and I need you to sign it now. Get out! Get out, now! Sheila: You heard the man, you heard him. Get out. Boy, man, I thought I was devious, but you? You take the cake, honey, and all that money you gave me, I'm giving it back. - This... - I'm no longer into that. My life is a parade. - Parade? - Long story. You know what? This isn't over. You know we gotta tell him, right? - Are you out of your mind? - Mrs. Simmons? - Pinkie toe? - Mm-hmm. She's my sister in the Lord now, you know. And she always says that the Bible says: "First go and be reconciled with your brother. " Sheila, how can you be quoting the Bible at a time like this? Yeah, I know. But it's never too late, you know, even with a past as long and colorful as mine. Yes, very long and colorful. Come on now, we gotta go, now, come on, stand up. Come on, hold your head up. Man up and let's go. Elston. Sheila, you know I love you like a sister. I love you too. And I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. All right, let's go. - Hey. - Hey, uh... I'm busy right now doing some reading. Can this wait? No, sir, it cannot. What's the problem? Okay, um... I'm just gonna go ahead and say it, um... I've been having an affair with your wife. Is that what you came here to tell me? Is this... is this some... some kind of game? Some kind of scam or something? Because my wife wouldn't do anything like that. No, no, no, I helped them too and I'm ashamed of it. And they didn't even pay that much. This... this... this is a joke, this is not true, okay, so... Of course, this isn't true. Oh. Okay, listen... Why would you do something like that? I treated you like my own son. Yes, Elston, why would you do something like this? Sir, I don't know why I did it but I did it, okay, and... I'm so sorry. I disappointed myself, I disappointed you and I'm ashamed. And I'm willing to suffer the consequences, sir. I'm so sorry. Is this true? Of course it's not true, for goodness sakes. I treated you like a queen, is this true? Oh, come on, man. Yo, tell me this is a lie, E. You was about to get a promotion. I have here on my phone all the pictures and text messages that she sent... - Give me that! - No, no, no... Jezebel! I'm sorry, sir. Why would you do this to me? You're gonna stand here and lie about it. Wow. I want you out of here. Talk to my lawyer in the morning. Go to my house. Give your keys to my housekeeper. You're the worst. As for you... I trusted you. I treated you like my own son. You lying, conniving little punk. I want you to go clean your desk out and leave your keys on top. Let me tell you something. If I was 20 years younger... Randall, Randall, Randall! Randall! You ain't kickin' nobody, homey. We're from Cabrini-Green. Everybody get out. Get out! Get out of my office! Get out! Let's go. Get out of my office. I am not your toy or your trophy. You just give me chump change. Do you know, all you did... Randall, was work, work, work, work. That's all you did. I needed some attention. I felt so worthless. All that money you make, you don't think I deserved any? I'm your wife. I want you out. Get out of my office before I call the cops and have them take you out. Get out of my office. - Get out of my office. - Take it. Elston: I feel so terrible. And you should, Johnny Heartthrob. - Slow down. - Jarvis. What, we can't talk about the truth around here anymore? Okay, what you did was horrible. I mean, but we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Did you ask him to forgive you? A million times. You only have to ask Him once. I love you no matter what and so does He, big bro. You always know what to say, huh, sis? Yeah, ain't she the best? Ooh, sorry, that's my man. - Gotta go. - Wait, wait, whoa, your man? Let him in, I want to see his wedding ring. Let him in, come on. I told you, I'm done with all that. I don't air your dirty laundry, Mr. SpongeBob. Hey, uh, don't go there. Everybody, this is Andrew. Wait, he's from the Stevens firm. She's sleeping with the enemy. It's okay, guys, we're on neutral territory. For now, at least. Yo, Elston, hide the paperwork. How are you, man? I'm Elston. - Pleasure. - Please to meet you. Hey, listen, I'm gonna be straightforward. Sheila told me what happened, and, hey, I know all about your extensive trial experience with Trace. And, you know, pretty sure, you know, since now you're technically unemployed that the partners at our firm could make you a handsome offer to come on board with us because, honestly, we could use a guy like you. - As a partner? - Absolutely. I mean, board has to approve, of course but I'm sure it'll sail through. Because, honestly, Elston, you're, uh... reputation is very solid in Chicago. Okay, um... - Give me your card and... - Yeah. ...we'll go over some details on Monday. - Sure. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Monday. Monday, Monday morning. As in 7:55 early Monday morning, bright and early, you know, and make sure your junior attorney - sends over the documents ASAP. - Jarvis. - Jarvis. - ASAP. Come on, Andrew, let's go before we miss the movie. Okay. - 'Cause we gonna get together. - Okay, all right. - Pleasure. - Pleasure, man. Hey, Monday. You better go ahead, girl. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get my SpongeBob pillow 'cause, uh... I got me a flight to Dallas to catch. - Dallas? - Yeah. Courtside, bro. Wait, now look it, man. Take care of her, man. Yeah, man, you know, the Bible says, "When a man findeth his wife "he keepeth it, 'cause it's a good thing. " You know, and, uh, I'll be damned if I let this good thing get away from me again. Amen, brother. So we gonna go. All right. I'll call you when we land. - Love you. - I love you too. I know where you live, Jarvis. - Hey, I know, I know. - Get it right. I don't want any trouble. I'm not here for any trouble. Just wanted to talk. Come in. You're welcome to have a seat. No, I'm... too keyed up to sit down. I'd rather stand. Look, um I've had a lot of time to think. Calmed down. Now I think I'm thinking straight. Well, I'm glad one of us can think straight. You know, the truth is, uh... I had suspicions about her all along. Hmm. But I was just blinded by her beauty. I was trying to convince myself not to think about it. But I knew eventually it would all blow up in my face. I don't know what to say. There ain't nothing to say. You know, uh oh, she's beautiful. We didn't have a lot in common. You know, she likes that... just that booty-shaking rap music. That stuff they play on the young people channel. You know, I am... I'm more of a... a Luther Vandross man myself. I understand. We didn't have anything to talk about. It was all a facade. I mean, she made me feel young again. I put her up on a pedestal. But I knew... I knew it wasn't real. I didn't spend any time with her. So, um... what are you gonna do? Yeah, that's the question. You know, I want you to know something. You weren't the first. She's had about three affairs. I just didn't want to know. Well, I wish I knew you didn't wanna know. That's well said, young man. You know what you did was wrong. And I want you to know that it hurt. But I respect you as a man for taking responsibility for the mistakes that you've made. God knows I've made my own mistakes. I can't give you your job back but I want you to know that you were instrumental in helping me build my firm. So I want you to have this. What is it? Open it. It's a check. Sir, this is, uh... this is very generous, sir, but I can't take this. No, I want you to take it. Remember... Do I owe you something? Remember that? Yup. Well, I want you to know you did a great job in helping me build my firm. So I'm not giving you that. You earned it. I'll let myself out. Sir... Thank you. I know that I can't do anything to make... the past right again but I'll do everything to make it right in the future. Yeah... maybe. Maybe after this all passes, who knows? Maybe one day we'll be friends again. Maybe. But right now, I've gotta go and put my life back together. Thank you. The Rammer Jammer will turn into some horrible chain restaurant. Unless we were to pool the money. You mean together? Lord have mercy. Some things that you left at my place. This doesn't mean that I forgive you. See you around. Are you okay? The MRI was totally clear. LEMON: I saw you looking at Lavon and Ruby. I've been keeping you from him. Go fight for your man. Before you make any decisions, I'm throwing my hat in the ring, too. Yours is the only hat in the ring, AnnaBeth. Ruby left. I told her I have feelings for someone else. GEORGE: Part of me couldn't stand Jonah being with you. Because? Because he doesn't appreciate you, Zoe. He's not going to see how special you are. DASH: Mayor Hayes. LAVON: Yeah? Now, this is the second Sunday that the people of this town had to line up like Soviets for post-church pastries. We need our eggs, we need our bacon. We need our grits. Now, now, Lemon and Wade are filling out the final paperwork right now. The Rammer Jammer will be open in a couple days. Wade Kinsella and Lemon Breeland owning a business together? Better get used to living on muffins. Wade and Lemon are BlueBellians, and we will support them. But, you know, maybe we should all practice cooking our own breakfast, just in case. Man, we are going to be huge. I cannot believe that this is actually happening. And I agree: huge. And who cares that everybody thinks we're going to crash and burn, right? They do? Uh, yeah. Oh, I guess people are more forthcoming with you. But, for now, the important thing is easier than she imagined. She stated that she has no interest in what will happen to her. Said she didn't want a lawyer nor any form of defense, being aware of what she did and requests no pardon. That's all she said. (THEME SONG PLAYING) Why aren't you at work? Luschek never showed. Probably passed out in his own vomit somewhere. So you chose to come in here and help? Yeah. Figured you could use it. It's Thanksgiving. Then get your ass off my counter and help Gina pull the turkeys out of the freezer. Shit, we got real turkey this year! We got trimmings from the factory. 50 cents a pound. Trimmings? Jesus. The shit no one else wants. That's a bag of turkey assholes right there. The whole meal has to come in at $1.05 a prisoner. Taxpayers don't give a shit if it's a holiday. We're the bad guys. Pig-fucker. Brown the onions for the gravy. SOPHIA: That too hot, baby? No, it's perfect. I feel so good. SISTER INGALLS: "Frequent blinking may actually be a way "for your brain to rest while you're awake." Wakeful rest, huh? You okay, honey? (VOICE BREAKING) It's just being touched by another person. - SOPHIA: I get it. - Thanks. The body gets lonely in here. Yeah. It's not even sex, you know? I just... I miss contact. Human beings aren't supposed to live like this. I've been in almost two years and there's still nights I reach out for my wife. You know, I was thinking about you guys. And I was imagining what I would do if Larry told me that he wanted to be a woman. I'd like to think that I would be open to it, but it would just be so weird. I'm sorry, is that totally rude? No. It's fine. He would make such an ugly girl. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Is he coming to visit you today? First holiday in prison can be rough. Very emotional. SOPHIA: But she's gonna be fine, 'cause we about to make some Heidi Klum shit happen right here. (CHUCKLES) (SNIFFS) Ugh, that smells nasty. What's it made of? You don't wanna know. (GROANS) How did you learn all this? My aunt was a santera. I used to help her out sometimes. I dabble. So what's gonna happen to me? You're gonna cramp up, some wicked diarrhea. This shit ain't pretty. You drink this, then you're gonna go out and dig a hole in the yard. You're gonna make me shit in a hole? No. You're gonna put this bean in there. Then you're gonna find a cigarette, you're gonna blow some smoke in there, you're gonna cover it up with a mound of dirt. And that's gonna have to do it, because I don't have any angelica or gris-gris oil. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Take it. This is gonna kill it? Well, that's what you want, right? As long as it don't feel anything. Please. It don't even have a brain yet. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hurry up, drink it. DAYANARA: Ow, that's hot! GLORIA: I told you it was, stupid. Go ahead, drink it all. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Where my Snickers? You know, I pray for all the dead babies and all their baby souls. (SOBS) And God, he's gonna let them into heaven, even though they weren't baptized. - Are you getting all of this? - Yeah. And you can also tell Judy that I pray for her as well. Well, her name's Barbara. - Barbara? - Barbara. Damn! I can't keep all this fan mail straight. (STUTTERS) I can't keep up with it. What? You have fans? - She's a hero. - (ALEX SCOFFS) She's a defender of the unborn. Jeez, that sounds like a bad X-Men movie. What'd you do, bomb an abortion clinic? And you can sign off with, "I will be out of here by 2015, "before the rapture." (CHUCKLING) Oh, man. Is something fucking funny to you? Yeah. It's just that people predict the rapture all the time. I mean, wasn't that supposed to happen in 2011? No. (STUTTERS) It comes in two stages. If you study your shit. The first one was a spiritual rapture. And the second one coming is a physical one. Ah, I see. - Okay? - Got it. And you're not invited, because they don't allow gay people on the rapture bus! There's a bus? Are all the seats already taken by Appalachian meth-heads? Oh, man, you're gonna... You're just gonna get it, Vause, aren't you? Do we have to go back to the dryer? You already locked me in that fucking dryer. Yeah, maybe I'll fucking turn it on this time. Make you spin around like a gerbil. Wanna know why? 'Cause I've had it with rich bitches like you. JESSICA: Those are bobos! Real Adidas have three stripes, not four. Your shoes are bobos. So? So your mom shops at Payless. And works at Friendly's. (GIRLS LAUGH) My mom has, like, four jobs. That's not something to brag about. You dress like a bum. She smells like one, too. (GIRLS GIGGLE) (CAR HORN HONKS) JESSICA: Do you guys live in that janky car? (CHUCKLES) - Bye-bye, pigsty! - Bye-bye, pigsty! (GIRLS GIGGLE) DIANE: Are those your friends? No. How was school? They changed the schedule around, so I don't gotta work nights no more. Fucking Brenda keeps trying to get me to cover her shifts. What are you doing? It's freezing out. DIANE: What the fuck was that? I'm not wearing those anymore. They're bobos. Go get 'em back. Jessica Wedge says they're lame. So fuck Jessica Wedge. They all make fun of me. They call me pigsty. Did you tell them who your dad is? I've never even met him. Well, you tell them. You tell them, "My dad is Lee Burley, the drummer for Death Maiden." You see what those smug little bitches say then. I mean, who are they, huh? What? 'Cause their parents work at the college, they think they're all fucking fancy? You are the daughter of a rock god. If he's so rich and famous, why are we so broke? You know how many girls used to scream at his concerts? You know, rip their clothes off? Throw themselves at him? But your dad chose me. And together we made you. Now go get your fucking sneakers. Don't you listen to those smarty-pants assholes. They're gonna have boring-ass lives. They're gonna wish that they were you. You are cool. PORNSTACHE: Listen up, turd-bags! We're gonna let you have your little going-away party, but do not make our lives more difficult afterwards by hanging yourself, with a sheet, or a tampon string, or whatever the fuck you like to get all arts and craftsy with. No Thanksgiving suicides. Chapman, what are we not to do on this day of thanks? Commit suicide? Exactly. We are the Pilgrims, you bitches are the Indians. This is the holiday where we cooperate. BIG BOO: Oh, yes. We bring you maize, and you give us small pox blankets. Exactly. Everybody wins. You look like JonBenet Ramsey. (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Well, that's what I was going for. Can you hold this for me? Yeah. Did you make this? Mmm-hmm. It's my second attempt. I spelled it wrong the first time. (ALEX CHUCKLES) And they say you went to college. (CHUCKLES) God, I hate seeing people go. It reminds me how much time I have left. PIPER: Yeah. But think of the story that you'll have. That is my line. I know it is. You always trot it out in times of suckiness. Yeah. Like that stomach virus I had in Java. Oh, it was a great fucking story. The whole village came out to watch you poop. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Hmm. So maybe this is kind of like that. Yo, yo, she coming, y'all! Taystee! ALL: (CHANTING) Taystee, Taystee, Taystee! I'm getting out, bitches! (ALL CHEERING) Yeah. Fight the power! Fuck the man! Hey! Watch it. Hey, yo, come here. Girl, you my shawty. Aw! Cut it out. You scrubby little hood rats gonna make a bitch cry. (BOTH CHUCKLING) (RB MUSIC PLAYING) I'll miss you, bitch. Yeah, girl. (INMATES CHEERING) My God, do you remember this? Yes. I don't even know how the arms go. I think... - (INMATES LAUGHING) - POUSSEY: What the fuck? Shit, these white girls trying to throw down. (INMATES CHEERING AND LAUGHING) JANAE: Yeah. BLACK CINDY: Yeah, girl! BIG BOO: Shake that ass. That's lesbian activity. INMATE: Yeah! It sure is. TAYSTEE: White girls gone wild. INMATE: Oh, my gosh. They're sexing, Mr. Healy. I seen it. This morning, in the bathroom, one girl's face was all up in the other one's hoo-ha. It was so nasty. It's an abomination. Okay, enough. They were moaning and everything. Speaking in tongues, like it's some kind of revival. Who? Who are you talking about? Vause and Chapman. - Chapman? - Mmm-hmm. Chapman. She a lesbian. They lesbianing together. They're in there right now in front of everyone, dancing all up on each other. Show me. (INMATES CHEERING) Chapman! Get over here. - (MUSIC STOPS) - INMATE: Party's over. - We were just... - Shut your mouth, Chapman. You think it's appropriate to violate your fellow inmate? - Violate? We were just dancing... - I said shut your mouth! You asked me a question. That looked like attempted rape to me. - Take her to SHU. - PORNSTACHE: Uh... What? You can't do that. Yeah, she's kind of right. Shut up, Mendez! You know, I'm tired of your shit. I'm your superior fucking officer! Now, you put her in the goddamn box, or I will fucking write you up, too! PIPER: No, no, no, no. - She didn't even do anything. - HEALY: Step back! Or I will cite you for assaulting an officer. PIPER: I have visitation today. Larry's coming to see me. - You can't do this. - PORNSTACHE: It's all right. - Let's do what the man says... - Please don't do this to me. ...before he has an aneurysm. Come on. PIPER: Please don't do this. PORNSTACHE: Come on! ABBY: Give me a shotgun! Give me a motherfucking shotgun, motherfucker! This is you. How long am I gonna be in here? Till we let you out. So tomorrow's the day. My cousin was supposed to send me my dress-out pack, but it never came. Now I gotta wear the same shit I came in here with. Man, it's gonna be too tight. (CHUCKLES) Man, you can walk out of here in a garbage bag, you'll still be dancing all the way to the bus. I'm scared. Nothing out there gonna be scarier than this shit. Shit, I been in institutions my whole life. I was a ward of the state till I was 16. Then juvie. I got no skills. MISS CLAUDETTE: Well, now you're just lying. You've worked in that law library for two years. You know more than my public defender. Yeah, but out there, you need real school for that stuff. (VOICE BREAKING) No one's gonna take me serious. MISS CLAUDETTE: You're a smart girl. You like to play the clown, but you've got a lot to offer this world. This is not a life, Taystee. Yo, listen to Voodoo Mambo, yo. Hey, yo, you think you just having... What they call it? That thing that happens to animals in captivity where it changes they brains? I seen it at the Bronx Zoo once. This giraffe ate its own vomit, banged its head up against the bars. 'Cause it ain't fit to live in the wild no more. Don't know how to eat leaves. That's what I'm saying. I'm the giraffe. Fuck no, you ain't. Giraffes skinny. Look at that ass. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Yo, don't let 'em get to you, T. This ain't where it's at. Jed and Lane are flying in from Chicago tonight with the kids. Will Grammie be there? Grammie's gonna stay in North Carolina. She's got a boyfriend. No shit! Suzanne. Sorry, language. I know I'm a mess. I've been cooking at the soup kitchen at church. Sweet potato casserole? - Yeah, I'm a one-trick pony. (CHUCKLES) - Hmm. See, you're back at church. I told you, people will get over it. - Well, there's a new pastor. - Hmm. He's been really welcoming. Very nice. He introduced me to a money manager, who gave me some free advice on how to talk to the bank. And he's sweet with Michael. Um... Eva stopped by the salon. She's pregnant. You know, she's been trying for a long time. You like him? This pastor? He's a good man. That's not what I'm asking. I'm not gonna talk about this. It's Thanksgiving. Well, I wanna talk about it. What do you want me to say? That I met someone and I'm interested? That I'm lonely and I miss men? When you went away, you told me... I know what I said. Baby, I don't want some strange man around my son, my wife. Well, we don't always get what we want now, do we? - What about your hair? - Mommy! I happen to like my hair like this. (SIGHS) Hi. (CLEARS THROAT) - Here to see Chapman? - Yep. You two are such a cute couple. She's the cute one. I'm like her furry sidekick. (CHUCKLES) Oh, um... Actually, you can't see her today. Why not? She's had some privileges revoked. - She's in the Security Housing Unit. - The what? Solitary? (STUTTERS) She's in solitary? What did she do? I'm sorry, I can't tell you that. I don't... (STUTTERS) This is ridiculous! I need to speak with your manager, or your superior, whoever the fuck is in charge here, please! Please don't swear at me. I can give you a number to call... Is she okay? Can't I just see her for a minute? I mean, it's a holiday, for God's sake. Okay, can you at least give my phone number to her counselor, Mr. Healy? Okay? And have him call me? Right away, he needs to call me right away. - Uh, I'm not allowed to... - Please. Please. - I guess, maybe. - Thank you. Thank you! Do you have... Can I... - I'll pass it along. - Okay. And if you see Piper, will you tell her that I love her? Okay? And to call me. Have her call me. And also (HALTINGLY) that I love her. Okay. Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Bloom. SHANNON: Motherfucker! INMATE: Shut up! SHANNON: (BANGING) Motherfucker! I'll kill you, motherfucker. SHANNON: I'll kill all you motherfuckers! INMATE: (CRYING) I'm gonna kill myself if I can't get out of here. (INMATE YELLING) (INMATE BANGING AND SHOUTING) (INMATE SCREAMING) My brother, Donny, shot a turkey last year, but it weren't really a turkey. It was a fucking bald eagle. (BOTH CHUCKLE) But he still shoved a Coors Light up the damn thing's ass and put it on the grill. (CHUCKLES) And proceeded to eat it. And when the ranger walked up, he had the bird hanging out of his mouth. He took his ass right to jail. And now he's in Federal, in Virginia. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Did it taste like chicken? No, it tasted like an eagle. (LEANNE CHUCKLES) (PENNSATUCKY CAWS) (BOTH CHUCKLE) Was your brother smoking tina? He snorts Oxy now. Fuck you. What the... Get the... The fuck! (YELPS) (SPITS) ALEX: Thanks for last night, baby. That shit was amazing. Nobody's ever licked my pussy like that. You are lying! I would never touch this bitch! Hey, knock it off! You wanna join your friend down the hill? PENNSATUCKY: You know, you're going to hell! And you're gonna burn there for the entire eternity! - I'm already there. - BENNETT: Have a seat. (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Taste it, Norma. - (SLURPS) - What did I tell you? It's damn near perfect. Ladies! Listen up! It's time to leave. Let's go! Everybody out, except for you. You can stay. Let's go, Silent Bob. That means you, too. Come on. It's okay, I'll take over. PORNSTACHE: Attagirl. (TURNS OFF STEREO) Where's my shit, Red? I don't know what you're talking about. Really? Are you gonna make me look through every box in here? How'd you do it? You stopped the truck? Maybe. Or maybe I got it from one of your girls. My girls wouldn't tell you shit. Huh. You want your pills? You can go stick your head in the toilet. There might be a few still floating around. You listen to me, you crazy cunt! The next time my shipment comes in, you're gonna put it to the side, top shelf, in the walk-in. Tricia's in detox. I hear Caputo's looking for her source. What would he think of your little operation? You mean, your operation? All the contraband comes through your kitchen. Looks like we're at a Cold War stand-off, Ruskie. And I got a bigger weapon than you. You wanna see it? (UNZIPS) (URINATING) (SIGHS) (ZIPS) Just a little something extra for the holidays. Next time you fuck with my stash, I'll end your life. (PHONE RINGING) MALE OPERATOR: Hello? Hi! Yes, hi. Hello, I am trying to reach the Executive Assistant or the Assistant Warden, please. Sir, it's after duty hours. Okay. Yes. Look my wife is in the solitary unit. Okay? She's being held there illegally. Now, my father is a lawyer, I know her rights. It's a holiday, sir. Exactly! That's exactly right! I know it's a holiday. That's what makes this so outrageous. You can call back on Monday... Would you please listen to me? Sir, please. Listen to me. I have left messages for the Associate Warden, for the Public Information's Officer, for the Department of Corrections, for the fucking Governor's office. Okay? If I don't get a call back from somebody soon, you people are gonna have a fucking lawsuit on your hands. Now... FEMALE VOICE: Hello, you have reached the Federal Correctional Institution in Litchfield. God! Fuck! Dude, that was really dramatic. (SIGHS) You know how much Piper loves Thanksgiving. It is her favorite. Yeah, I don't know why. Had to wear a suit jacket. Fucking toxic. You've been to Thanksgiving with my parents. Yeah, no, I know, it's horrible. She loves our Thanksgivings. Oh, in your parents' apartment? They go to South Beach. They have gravy boats. A maid comes and cleans up in the morning. Come on. They won't mind me using these awesome tchotchkes for my table-scape, will they? We have to cancel. We have to cancel. You have to cancel the whole thing. Cal, (STAMMERS) I can't host people here, all right? Not under these circumstances. All right? It does not feel right. No, yeah, you're right, man. We should cancel. We'll cancel. We'll cover the mirrors, sit shivah. It's what your people do, right? It's when someone dies, Cal. She's not dead. Exactly. Look, I love my sister, dude. But she got herself sent to the hoosegow. And now she's clearly pulled some other shit to get herself into even more trouble. You have done everything that you can do. And Piper would love the fact that you're throwing Thanksgiving, our friends are coming, the maid is coming tomorrow. And I've spent my entire life-savings on this, this marvelous turkey. She'd want us to celebrate. I'm sure she's fine. (BANGING) (SHANNON SCREAMS) Chapman? Mr. Healy? How are you? I'm in a cement box and people are screaming. You needed a little time-out to think about your behavior. My what? I was dancing. Provocatively. Sexually. Gay sexually. This is illegal. You can't keep me in here. See, there's where you're wrong. Chapman, I tried to be nice to you, because I understand where you come from. You don't know me. I thought we could be friends. You're not yourself lately. You're acting out. So you're teaching me a lesson? You should be thanking me. Alex Vause is sick. I get you. You're not like her. The only sicko here is you. And under different circumstances, what? I'd be your girlfriend? Is that it? Did I make you jealous? You put me in this hellhole for no reason. Wake up, Healy! Girls like me? We don't fuck ignorant, pretentious old men with weird lesbian obsessions! We go for tall, hot girls, and we fucking love it! So that leaves you on the outside, living your sad, sad little life. You don't get me! Ever! So go fuck yourself! Happy Thanksgiving, Chapman. SHANNON: Fuck you, motherfucker! Where's my mattress? Where the fuck is my mattress? What did you do to it? (SNORTS) Oh, fucking crackhead. My bunkie stole my mattress. Yeah. And? It's gone. It's not there. Then how do you know it was stolen? Because it's not on my bed, and she and her hick friend have been fucking with me. I need a new one. Okay, we issue one mattress per inmate. You can fill out a form. It'll take a couple weeks to replace it. And what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Sleep on the frame? It's probably good for you. A hard surface aligns the vertebrae. Your body will thank you. Excuse me. (LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Who are you? I'm Alex. I'm your daughter. Holy shit. How'd you find me? Well, I saw the show. And then the manager sent me back here. Oh, you saw that shit? That was embarrassing. We can't even fill a fucking basement anymore. If one more jerk-off asks me to play Dirty Girl... I wish I had never written that fucking song. It is a great song. That is still a great song. Shut up, Lonnie. We're supposed to be in Philly, but Jimmy over here punched the booking agent in the neck. I can't believe you're my kid, man! You're my kid! I'm so happy to see you. Yeah. Me, too. 'Cause I would've never recognized you in a million years. And you got a serious rack on you, too. I mean, I could have accidentally fucked her, right? But that would have been bad. No. Seriously, that's twisted. I didn't say that. Um, is there a bathroom? Is there a bathroom? (CHUCKLING) It's down there. Right. Thank you. LONNIE: Her rack? That would've been fucked up. Wow. LONNIE: (LAUGHING) Her fucking rack. (SIGHS) (SNIFFLING) Jesus, you scared me. You okay? I'm fine. I'm just gonna go home. He's not what you thought. It's fucking depressing. (SCOFFS) Been imagining this moment your whole life? I had this white fringe pleather jacket I always thought I'd wear if I ever met him. Nice, pleather. (CHUCKLES) What happened? You're right. Maybe that would've made the difference. Most people are better in the abstract. It's Alex, right? Yeah. Fahri. You want a bump? (CHUCKLES) No, thanks. Smart girl. Fahri, what are you doing hanging out with these losers? Uh... They're my clients. What do you do? I work for an international drug cartel. (LAUGHS) Right. (GROANS) Will you get Gloria? I'm dying. You're not dying. Here. Serves you right for drinking some stupid potion from some half-assed santera. Who told you? She told me. So I told her to give you some roots and berries. Make you shit your brains out and learn your lesson. So the tea was bullshit? It's not gonna work? You think I'm gonna let you ice my grandbaby? You want me to end up like you? I'm already in prison. All I need is five different baby daddies and an ass tattoo of a dog. It's a wolf. Daya, I made mistakes, okay? I didn't have nobody teaching me what to do. Oh, get away from me. Maybe I'm not the mother of the year... Oh, you think? But at least I put something into this world that could still be good. I made something. I fucked up my own life, but Eva, Lucy and Christina, Emiliano, even you could still be something. Babies give you hope. Fuck. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh, my God. There's mold. There's mold on the bologna. Oh, my God. VOICE: I found a maggot. Hello? Is someone there? VOICE: Are you real? Yes. Yes, I'm real. Are you real? VOICE: I don't know. I'm gonna take a bus all the way to the Bronx. Right to Angelo's Pizza and I'm gonna get a giant slice with the works. But just one, because after, we're gonna have a big old Thanksgiving at my cousin, Neicey, house, and we probably gonna go out dancing at the Monte Carlo Room, and I'ma order a Sex on the Beach with 10 maraschino cherries in it. And some man gonna buy it for me. (BOTH LAUGH) Well, that sounds like a plan. You know, ain't no one on the outside gonna do my 'do for a can of Pepsi. Which you still owe me, by the way. (CHUCKLES) Jefferson, they're releasing you now. Van's leaving. Right now? I gotta say my goodbyes. It's a holiday. cos wanna go home and see their families. If you don't go now, you're not getting out till Monday. Let's go. Yo! Where's Poussey at? Jefferson! Now. What the fuck? What the fuck? They already took her? I didn't even say goodbye. Taystee! Yo! (BANGING) Tays! She can't hear you. (BANGING) (CHUCKLES) (INMATES CHUCKLING) - POLLY: Hello? - Hello! - PETE: Hello! Whoo-hoo! - Hi! Come in, new family. (KISSES) Hello, happy Thanksgiving. - Ooh, your parents have a nice place. - Yeah. - Cal! - Hi. - Hi. Do you know Pete? - Mmm-mmm. No. And this is Finn. Wow. He looks like Steve Buscemi. Congratulations, man. PETE: Gotta wash your hands first. LARRY: Isn't that just to touch the baby? And to touch me, too. Polly's being a total nutter. If it were up to Pete, he'd let him suck on the bottom of his shoe. I hope you guys don't mind, but we brought a stray. - Larry, this is our friend, Maury. - Hi. Yeah, Maury Kind. I'm sorry, you're not a stray. You're Maury Kind from NPR! - Guilty. - Oh, my God, I love you. I love your show. I mean, I love... (STUTTERS) I love you. - (CHUCKLES) Thank you. - POLLY: Wow. - Back off, Larry. - LARRY: Sorry, sorry. Where should we put our stuff? Put it in the kitchen, follow me. You come meet my girlfriend! Don't get in her way, Cal! She's got an angry, red vagina and she's been drinking rum punch since 10:00 a.m. Thank God we pumped. I cannot believe you brought Maury Kind. Yeah, I'm mixing sound on Urban Tales. He's going through a divorce, so I invited him. I didn't know you'd geek out so hard. You know, I'd love to talk to him. Well, it'd be weird if you didn't. Besides, he read your "Modern Love" column and loved it. - Stop it. Seriously? - Uh-huh. Holy shit. PETE: Hey! Your language. Huh? Sorry. Shh. PIPER: What an asshole. I cannot believe people like him are even allowed to work here. They take these insecure, and frustrated men and they put them in charge of a bunch of powerless women and they become these predatory creeps. I mean, all of that condescending "I know what's best for you" bullshit. VOICE: You can rage, but they always win. They're the ones with the keys. How long have you been down here? I've lost track. I don't know. Nine months? A year? A year? That's insane. VOICE: They keep the lights on, so you lose all sense of time. It's not living. I mean, yeah, you're breathing, but you ain't a person no more. It's bad. You start to see shit that ain't there. You start to hear voices. Oh, my God. They keep you here till they break you. (GULPS) I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Why did I do that? Why did I say those things? He's never going to let me out of here. I am so fucking stupid. I am so fucking stupid! What's wrong with me? (SOBBING) VOICE: You still there? I swear to God that if they let me out of here... I will shut up. I will shut up and I will put my head down and I will do my time and I'll smile at Healy and I (CRYING) won't go near her. I won't even look at her. I can do that. I can do that. I can. Please. Please don't leave me here. Please. Hey, Vause, I know you're not working, but can I get my bag? Yeah, just give me a sec. What happened to your glasses? (MIMICKING PENNSATUCKY) Smashed in the name of Jesus. Oh, shit. Pennsatucky? Wow, you guys have released the kraken. She's decided it's her Christian duty to annihilate me. Because I'm a "privileged rich girl." (SCOFFS) Which is hilarious, because those types of girls tortured me my whole fucking life. If you and I had met in fifth grade, you'd have made fun of my clothes. - (LAUGHS) - Who, me? No, no, no, no. I would never. You look terrific. (SIGHS) Fuck! (NICKY CHUCKLES) I know what you were like. Upper West Side, doorman building, skiing in Jackson Hole. Am I wrong? - Who told you that shit? - No one. My business was built on sniffing out girls like you and turning 'em into drug mules. I knew it. You're a pimp. Man, you would've been perfect. Little Nicky at 19? Mmm! I would've turned you out in two seconds. I'd make a terrible mule. I would've done all your drugs. (ALEX CHUCKLES) Besides, okay, what makes you think I would've fallen for your shit? Well, you grew up rich, so you're used to easy money. You have enough stamps in your passport to avoid suspicion. - You hate your parents. - Yeah, totally. You're in your experimental phase. All you wanna do is fuck a woman or black guy, - have some adventure... - Hmm. (CHUCKLES) ...and still be able to afford a Birkin bag. - Shit, I'm in! - (CHUCKLES) Fuck it. You know me. Sign me up. Oh, was that who Piper was? No, no, Piper was different. Why? 'Cause you loved her? Because she was different. Get some glue, pimp. (SIGHS) Fuck. Crystal is in love with her pastor. Ah. (CLICKS TONGUE) I'm not surprised. A lot of women lust after their pastors, it's very common. And pastors can do that. Priests have to learn to bounce their eyes. Um, what's that? You never stay focused on a member of the opposite sex for too long. That's how I watch every Russell Crowe movie. (CHUCKLES) She wants my blessing. Then you should give it to her. Why? I don't understand why she needs to have sex. I mean, (CHUCKLES) look at you. I'm a nun, I took a vow. She married a man with a penis, I assume because she wanted to use it occasionally. (SIGHS) How much time do you have left? (SIGHS) Three years, eight months. You got what you needed at a pretty big cost to your family. This is what she needs. Doesn't Crystal deserve some happiness? Let her go. I can't. It's the right thing to do. (GUESTS LAUGHING AND CHATTERING) POLLY: Did you want some more sweet potatoes? So, Neri, what do you do? I'm a hyperbaric welder. Yeah, I used to work on the pipelines, but now I just normal weld. - Isn't she a badass? - (CHUCKLES) We met when I was fabricating some sculptures. Hmm, I have so many burn scars, Cal and I are naming them. Oh, oh! Speaking of scars, how was it? The whole birth thing? Did you eat your placenta? No. We passed on that. CAL: Oh, it's really good for you. Crazy nutrients. People dehydrate it and make it into pills, but that's the expensive way. I always just thought you could, like, scramble it up. (CHUCKLES) Just, like, put it in a pan with some salt and pepper. (POPS) Bam! It sounds gross, but possibly delicious. Throw some sage in there, too. - Do you still have it? - I don't. Pete, you're dropping food on his head. So, yeah, you know, we both decided to stick it out, you know. I mean, it hasn't been easy, but, you know, relationships are not easy. - Right? - Right. Yeah. Well, I thought your column was an interesting perspective. You know, the long-suffering husband. Fiance. I mean, I didn't really mean for it to come off that way. No. No, no, no, it was very entertaining. - Thank you... Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, I'm a big fan of yours. I mean... - Oh, well. Yeah, I love your show and... I was just listening to the one on road trips. Cal, the turkey is amazing. - It's perfectly cooked. - Thanks, man. It's a heritage bird. Actually, Maury, um... (STUTTERS) I was thinking that my story would work really well aloud. - Right. - You know, 'cause I consider myself a much better verbal storyteller. - Right. - You know, I don't know if you ever... Cal, what is a heritage... I'm sorry, what was that? Sorry. No, I didn't know if you ever were open to maybe doing a prison episode. You know, if you ever had guests like me on. Yeah. The thing is, if we wanted to document prison, we'd probably talk to actual inmates. And if we were gonna do a story about someone whose loved one was in prison, we'd find a more representative example. Cycle of poverty, that sort of thing. Right. Yeah, no, that... (STUTTERS) I get... That makes sense. I get it. But we are working on a show about unique long-distance relationships. You know, a guy who works down on the ice every year, a pair of married missionaries. Your story could be good on that. - Really? - Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I mean... Wow, I would love that. I mean, I would love to do that. CAL: Hey, toast! NERI: Yes! CAL: Toast. PETE: Cheers. - Happy Thanksgiving. - Happy Thanksgiving. Eye contact. (RB MUSIC PLAYING) (INMATES CHATTERING) BIG BOO: No gravy? Why is there no gravy? You complaining? Uh... No, ma'am. No, no, no. Come on, Little Boo. Let's not complain. I don't know why you threw it out. I tried it. It tasted great to me. I'm thankful for my health, for my strong body and mind. And for you girls, who remind me every day that self-forgiveness is possible. Hmm. I'm thankful that Taystee got the fuck out of this dump. Yeah, I'll second that. I'm thankful for my new bitch, Little Boo. Sit, hooker. Ah! Good girl. (CHUCKLES) There you go. (INMATES CHUCKLE) Oh, and, of course, I'm thankful for all y'all other bitches. (INMATES CHUCKLE) Do you wanna say grace, Sister? I trust in the Lord with all my heart and lean not on my own understanding. Amen. Amen. POUSSEY: Amen. Man, it sucks to get glasses replaced, you have to get someone on the outside to fill your prescription. (SCOFFS) How blind are you? Blindish. Bright side, you can't see the color of these potatoes. (CHUCKLES) It doesn't feel right to be eating while she's in there. Straight girls. (SCOFFS) They'll fuck you up every time. (INMATE SCREAMS) (SPITS) Hey! Hey. (KNOCKS) Did you get this loaf thing? (KNOCKS) Looks like three different dinners mushed together into a mound. Are you looking at it? Hello? Can you hear me? Please tell me that you're still there. CAPUTO: You can't leave her in there. I don't know what the hell she's doing in Seg in the first place. Christ, even Mendez said it was uncalled for and that guy lives to throw people in the box. - You're not my boss. - Today I am. Fig is on vacation. And I am telling you I don't have the write-ups or the paperwork to support it. She got under your skin, Sam. This is personal. She thinks she's running the place. You don't have to tell me that. Her fiance is raising a stink bigger than the shit I took this morning. Christ, he's probably got the Obamas on the phone by now. These liberal, wealthy offenders, they're connected. And if they review this, the paper trail is going to be sweaty. So do us all a favor and get her out of there. It's not even 48 hours. Get her out of there. (INMATES PRAYING IN SPANISH) GLORIA: Mmm-hmm. ALEIDA: Mmm-hmm. GLORIA: Mmm. ALEIDA: Mmm-hmm. I'm sorry you feeling like shit, chica, but I had to do it. It's okay. I'm relieved, actually. (WHISPERING) I wanna keep it. (SPEAKING SPANISH) But I don't wanna get him in trouble, though. Don't worry, nena. We'll figure something out. You're gonna have a baby. I'm gonna be a grandmother. (SIGHS) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? FEMALE VOICE: An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison is attempting to contact you. To accept the call, please press one. (BEEPS) SOPHIA: Baby? It's me. Uh, I'm just getting in the car. I'll just take a minute. I was wrong. You do whatever you need to do. You have my blessing. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. You Josie's girl? My cousin, Neicey, told me I could stay here. Neicey don't live here no more. And I know she ain't your cousin. We had the same foster family. Look, I ain't getting my ass in trouble letting some ex-con stay in my house. But I have to stay here. This is the address I gave my supervisor. The system gonna come check on me. That ain't my problem. I ain't got nowhere else to stay at. Shit. You can sleep in that corner. On the floor. Leave that mattress where it is. 'Cause I ain't having no rapey motherfuckers coming in off that fire-escape again. And you're out in the morning, understand? Hmm, Burset. Um... You gave me four. Yeah, new doctor. He said your chart was wrong. So you're back to your old dosage. Thank you. - Hmm? - Thank you. (CHUCKLES) Chapman! You're out. Back to camp. FISCHER: (KNOCKS AT DOOR) Mr. Healy? Piper Chapman's fiance came to visit while she was in lock-up. (SIGHS) And? He left his number, sir. I'm sorry, I know that's against the rules, but he wanted to know why she was in SHU. Okay. Thank you. I'll take that. (LINE RINGING) LARRY: Hello? Hello, Mr. Bloom? This is Counselor Healy from the Department of Corrections. I have some information that might interest you regarding your fiancee. (THEME SONG PLAYING) Holy shit, Chapman, you're out. Oh, my God... - Let's get out of here. - Are you okay? What are we doing here? (BOTH MOANING) Adam? Adam! (Ringtone) (Ringing) # Venez dans mes bras # Closer to me, dear # Donnez-vous a moi # Set aside all fear # Restons enlacés # Pour I'éternité # Yes, you shall be mine # Till the end of time Armed police! Clear! (Shouts) Guys? (Bleep) Chuks? GPS co-ordinates. He's giving us a location. CHUKS: OK. (Types) Vicarage Lane. About 10 miles from here. (Soft click) (Exhales heavily) That's Adam's, Elise. Some kind of negative ions thing. Maybe he's put it there to show us where he was. Yeah, trouble is, Kieran wants us to know where... What are you doing with my son? ! Think of what he wants you to do and do exactly the opposite. - Why hasn't he left us a message? - It's part of the torture. Karl? We can't lose focus. I used to work with him. OK. And why is he? He's a man who lost everything. All his truths stem from that. His real name is Kieran Ashton. - Why is he doing this to us, Karl? - I slept with his wife. (Sighs) When they were living in France she came to me to talk about his... decline. We only... Anyway, he knows. So now he feels betrayed... by... society, by the police. - And by his friend. - Yeah. Karl... I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. The last thing I would have ever wanted was for Daniella to get hurt. Well, she was. And all of it, the blood and the... the bodies, it all goes back to you. Don't do this. Please, just listen. I let myself believe there was something good in you, and I was wrong. I'm gonna tell the FBI everything I know. I just don't care. It's over. Fine. I won't stop you if that's what you want to do. But just know Stavos left me this message yesterday. I didn't get it until you gave me my phone. Listen. We have a problem. Trapani lied about the cartel. There is no truce. Trapani never even passed on your offer to pay Luke's debt. If they find out you killed their man without trying to negotiate, this is going to get ugly fast. An hour after he sent me this message, he and half my crew were gunned down... executed. It was Trapani who set me up. He didn't negotiate with the cartel. He sent the cartel. Why would he do that? Why do you think? He saw an opportunity to seize power, and he took it. Why do you think he told you about me? Trying to drive a wedge between us. Grace, the cartel may have pulled the trigger, but Al Trapani is the one who's responsible for your mother's murder. And if you want the bloodshed to end and you want justice, then you and me are gonna have to take him down. What would I have to do? No way. That's insane. You're the only one who can contact the Nogales cartel without involving Al Trapani. Yeah, of course they'd like to hear from me, so they can find me and kill me. All I'm asking you to do is use your Miami contacts to set up a meeting between me and Tiago Enriquez. He's cartel's lieutenant here in Chicago. This is crazy. Why do you think this guy will even meet you? Because I'm authorized to speak for Constantine. 'Cause I'm his daughter. So you know. Will you make the call? Grace, I'm just a real-estate guy who screwed up. -I shouldn't even be here. -And I'm a surgeon. We're both out of our element. I am asking you to help. How can I say no to my sister? What's that? Grace Devlin's phone records. So? Looks like you two are a lot closer than I thought. Until you left town a month ago, you spoke several times a day. The calls are highlighted. She's Constantine's doctor. I was gaining her trust. She has his ear. Cut the crap, Franco. You used to date. Isn't that right? Yeah, a long time ago. You just failed to mention it? It wasn't relevant. It ended the day I was recruited. You told her she was being investigated, didn't you? You lied to me, Franco. She's not just Constantine's doctor. She's under his thumb, and she aided and abetted outfit activity. I don't know. Okay. Well, then, let me tell you what I know. I know you still got the hots for Dr. Devlin and I know you two started up again recently. She helped me with my investigation. That's it. Then how do you explain CSU finding her fingerprints all over your safe house... You know, the motel room the bureau set you up in before you took off? I'm reporting you to the Attorney General's office. They're gonna press charges. I need your gun and your badge. If you're going after Grace, you're wasting your time. Well, that's not your call to make. I checked the back parking lot. There's no sign of him. He's late. We're not in a rush. When I told him we wanted to meet at the police station, he didn't seem too happy. Yeah, well, we need to be safe. You're sure he listened to Stavos' message? Yeah, it's the whole reason he agreed to meet. Here we go. Mr. Enriquez, I'm Grace Devlin. Constantine Alexander's daughter? That's right. And this piece of crap is Constantine's son? Yeah. Al Trapani... Seems he played me against Constantine. Is your father as pissed off as I am? Yeah, that's why we're here. What do you propose we do about it? Constantine is willing to forgo retaliation and give you free access to the West Side Eisenhower Expressway. It's worth millions. It's not his to offer. Al Trapani controls the expressway. In exchange, you'll agree to a truce and you'll forgive Luke's debt. You'll take the hit off of Luke, and you'll put it on Trapani. And you're telling me Constantine's got enough juice to take over the West Side from his hospital bed? Well, he owns enough aldermen to shift city council votes. He's got enough soldiers on the street to crush anyone who won't play ball. And the CPD will turn a blind eye, thanks to every cop he's got in his pocket. If I agree to this and Constantine doesn't keep up his end, we'll come after the both of you. You understand? You have my father's word and mine. It's done. Not yet. Which one of you shot my mother? Now we're done. Does the patient need Insulin? No, his sugar levels are fine. I just gave him a sedative. Can we have a moment, please? Of course, doctor. So, what happened? It's done. Enriquez will take care of Trapani in exchange for the Expressway, and Luke will get a free pass. Okay. That'll give us the breathing room we need until we're ready to make our move. What do you mean, "ready to make our move"? What do you think? Why don't you tell me? After the ambush, the cartel... they could have taken everything away from us. We had to trick them into a sense of security. All war is deception, Grace. And a war with the cartel is one we can't lose. But we're not losing 'cause we're not fighting. That's the deal we made. There is no deal. There never was a deal. It's all a tactic, an illusion. You used me? Well, if you knew the plan, you wouldn't have done it. And there is nobody that could have pulled this off like you, Grace... nobody. I don't want any part of this. You don't have a choice. Don't you see? You're my blood, my family. What is in me is in you. I'm tired now. I need to rest. I'm gonna need all my strength for the fight ahead. Nate. Grace. How's Constantine? Is he okay? Yeah, he's... He's doing good. Can I see him? Oh, he's... He needs his rest right now. I'm done. Yeah? Constantine, the organization... I don't want anything to do with it anymore. What about you? I made my decision a long time ago. I love you. I love you, too. ♪ Finger on the trigger, baby ♪ come on, take me down ♪ I drug your name across my wrist ♪ ♪ just to hear the sound ♪ want to feel the metal, hot, smoking on my lips ♪ ♪ take me low and take me high ♪ I just need a hit ♪ let's melt into the shadows until there's nothing left ♪ ♪ my blood spreads like a fire ♪ with your breath across my neck ♪ ♪ I'm not looking for a lover to be gentle through the night ♪ ♪ won't you be my killer? ♪ Keep me in your sight ♪ bang, bang, bang ♪ bang, bang, bang are you sure you're ready for this?

'They'll each choose a team of ten singers from a select group of the UK's best artists 'who have been invited to audition for our coaches. 'But, it won't be easy, because the coaches will have their backs to the artists, as they sing.' 'Our chairs are facing away from the stage, so we have no idea what's going on behind us.' We are blind. This is all about the voice. 'How an artist looks...' I've got more of a face for radio. '.. Their size...' Too short. Too fat. '.. Their age...' I'm 47. In the music business, that's pushing it. 'None of that matters! ' That's what's amazing. 'Only the voice counts.' This is how the show works. When a coach likes what they hear, they hit a button. Which turns their chair. And that artist wins a place on their team. I can't wait to work with you. I'm the one who can't wait to work with you. Yeah! However, if more than one chair turns, the power shifts, and the artist can decide which coach they'd most like to work with. You know we want you. Who do you want? The coaches need to do everything in their power to persuade the artist to join their team. It's fisticuffs at dawn. Pick me! Come on! 'But, if no coach turns, the artist is out of the competition.' What I need to stress, when we don't turn around, it's not because you're not a great singer, you are. It's just that we only get to pick ten. 'Each coach wants to discover the one artist who will win it all. 'A record deal with Universal Music, and the chance to be named The Voice.' The potential that this could change my life is huge. 'This is their moment.' 'It's now or never.' The blind auditions start now. Our talent scouts have invited the nation's most gifted vocalists to the blind auditions. And, as our artists begin to arrive from up and down the country, the anticipation is building. 17-year-old Belfast schoolgirl Jessica Hammond is hoping to swap teenage dreams for musical reality. Songwriting's always been kind of a way out for me. There's been a few incidences where I was getting picked on. I'd always come home and play my guitar. I used to say to her, "Jess, write down what you are worried about, "and then we'll read over it." So, now, she writes lyrics about it, and turns it into a positive. 'In my bedroom, I'm a superstar. And people are listening to me.' And I just imagine the raindrops on the windows, they're clapping for me. And I don't feel alone. 'I've chosen to sin Jesse J, Price Tag. 'Whenever it's a cover, you have to really look in and do your research, 'and think about the kind of message of the song, and what you're trying to say to people.' I definitely will put my heart and soul into this. And hopefully she likes it. ♪ Seems like everybody's got a price ♪ I wonder how they sleep at night ♪ When the sale comes first And the truth comes second ♪ Just stop for a minute and smile ♪ Why is everybody so serious? ♪ Acting so damn mysterious? ♪ You got shades on your eyes And your heels so high ♪ That you can't even have A good time ♪ Everybody look to their left ♪ Everybody look to their right ♪ Can you feel that?

I'll give it up to you, if you want. So, I would like to have you on my team. We need to make an album, and we need to put it out to where it's big, in the UK, America, Brazil, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Argentina... Russia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Ireland. He's like a lobster, giving it all that! I'm telling you, you need to come here, babes! Do you want to put your guitar down? It's stuck to me. Hold on. I'll be your roadie. I'll hold it for you. I will be your producer and your roadie. Thank you. AUDIENCE LAUGHS I don't mind carrying the guitar. I want to talk to you as if I was you when I was 17. There's things in your voice that remind me of me. I'm not going to sit here as Will said, and go, "You're going to do this," because I don't surround myself with yes men. You need... I'm being serious. That wasn't a yes man. Wait, wait, wait! No, no. She's blowing me up. Do you mind if I do something with your guitar? Let me talk. I can understand where you're coming from. You're a female, you're young. You don't understand how amazing it is for me to sit here and have someone like yourself sing one of my songs. What I will say is, number ones, albums, touring, all that stuff is a bonus, yeah? Music is where it should stem from, and that's something me and you could enjoy. I can't compete with that. You can, you're Sir Tom Jones. What I can compete with is this. This show is called The Voice, right? And the thing we have to concentrate on, if you come with me, is picking the right songs in order to win this thing. And I feel I can help you with that. So, here I am, babe. I understand guitar playing and singing, something I've done since I was your age, even before. And I really feel the musicianship coming from you. I think we would work incredibly together. I really do. You've got four coaches - you've got only one decision. That's the beautiful part of the show, you've got artistic control. I really hope you make the right decision and come with me. Um, Will... Ssssh. Let her decide! I appreciate everything you said. Um, I'm a songwriter, I'm only 17 and from Belfast. Number one hits don't matter to me, making music and sharing my message is what matters to me. Beautiful, beautiful. Um... I'm going to go with Jessie. ♪ It's not about the money, money, money ♪ We don't need your money, money, money ♪ We just want to make the world... ♪ It's fine, it's fine. I can't wait to work with you. I thought it was gorgeous when Jessie picked Jessie, you're coming out against a Jessie J song, you know, I'm in for the pitch, she's Irish as well, so I might've been in there but, ah well, didn't work. She's so good! While Jessica takes her first step into the spotlight, I want from your mouth That raging madness that my love is causing It brings me to tears to love you like this Only you Rose, oh, Rose ask for anything But don't ever ask for my love to die If someone must die, I will die and for you Rose, oh, Rose ask for anything But don't ever ask for my love to die If someone must die, I will die and for you Rose, give to me all your dreams Owner of your love I want to be Give to me all your wounds from the past Darling, next to me I'll have you Rose, oh, Rose always full of pride But without my presence your faith falls to pieces Meanwhile I, I'm here dying for you Rose, oh, Rose ask for anything But don't ever ask for my love to die If someone must die, I will die and for you Oh, Rose... Oh, Rose... Rose, give to me all your dreams Owner of your love I want to be Give to me all your wounds from the past Darling, next to me I'll have you Oh, Rose, oh, Rose always full of pride But without my presence your faith falls to pieces Meanwhile I, I'm here dying for you Rose, oh, Rose ask for anything But don't ever ask for my love to die If someone must die, I will die and for you I will die and for you I will die and for you Rose, Oh, Rose... LIFE GOES ON Ok, yes... I see. What? You know what, I'll call you back later. Hey Chopin! Stop it with the polonaise. You already know the boss hates classical music. There's no way I can use the phone with all that noise. If Chopin is noise for you, then what do you call what I play here? Look, we'd starve with Chopin and Beethoven only. Keep playing what the boss likes and I'll keep discovering stars. - Discovering stars... - What? Didn't I discover you? Artists agency? Hugo? It's me, Ricardo. Yeah, that's what I wanted to know. Thursday 20? Perfect. And don't forget about The Mice. The Mice who? That long-haired guys band I showed you. See if you can find them a gig at a night club. Ok, bye. This Hugo never loses his sense of humor. He says he'll find The Mice a job at a cheese factory. Cheer up! You're singing at a rich woman's house the 20. Perhaps an important businessman will hear you and... Please, come on in Lolita. Come on. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Roberto, our pianist. Mr. Marin, artist manager. In case you need my services, here is my business card. Thank you, but I'm just a beginner. She came recommended by a TV channel director. Play that song. When you're done, come see me at my office, Lolita. - Can I have this? - Sure. - So? - Sorry, I always mess the intro. - Let's start over - Don't get nervous. Pretend you're singing alone... like when you shower. I have a whole world of sensations A whole world of vibrations And I can give them... Let's try with a lower key. I have a whole world of sensations A whole world of vibrations - So your name is Lolita, right? - That's right. But Mr. Mauricio wants me to change it. He says it doesn't sound good. What doesn't sound good here is what you're singing. Pardon my honesty, but you'll never be a singer. Don't waste your time. Give it a shot as an actress, perhaps model. But Mr. Mauricio said I was going to be a star! Mr. Mauricio can't tell a do from a re. Fine. Let's see what Mr. Mauricio has to say. Lolita, wait... Do you know what Mauricio is going to say? I don't give a damn about what he thinks or says. What a stubborn man! Playing the polonaise again! - Listen, Roberto... - Stop that music from hell! So I can't tell a do from a re? I'm only controlling myself because you must be mentally ill. You're fired! Go play at some madhouse. And take your stupid songs along with you! Wait a moment! You'd better take those words back. Otherwise... Otherwise what? - Because of me you got fired too. - I wasn't fired, I resigned. So I can't tell a do from a re? I thought he'd die of a heart attack. Look, with the bad comes the good. If only he had published your songs. Publish? He kept them inside drawers for a year. He'll regret it. Someday those songs will be famous. You've always lived on dreams. On dreams and reality, my mouth is making water. Look. Let's buy some oysters, a lobster and a bottle of champagne. Are you nuts? We're unemployed and you come up with such a menu? We have to tighten our belts. It's to celebrate our new found freedom. Let's go home, I'll make dinner but cheaper, tastier and faster. Letter from Córdoba, it must be your parents'. My mom. I already know what it probably says. We're here, looking forward to seeing you again. Take care. And if you need a few bucks, you can always ask me. It wouldn't hurt. The house is a mess, everything's dirty, all turned upside down. The janitor didn't come to clean today either. So what does your mother say? The same as usual. "Your father still with lumbago and the usual monomania..." "...regretting you gave up your piano lessons." - Always the same crap. - Get over it. It's hopeless. I'll make dinner. What do you think? To begin with, corned beef, National Industry. Then sardines in oil tomato sauce mussels "au natural". And for dessert... fruit salad. A can opener... and dinner's ready. Oh, we're out of bread. I'll get it. Sorry, sorry. Elisa. Elisa! I'm coming. Elisa... Elisa. Like your Elisa. - Hey! Where's the bread? - Oh! The bread... I'm sorry. I just bumped into an angel. Her name is Elisa, you know. Like Beethoven's. Always daydreaming. It'll be crackers tonight. Come on. Dinner's getting cold. Who is it? It must be the janitor, next door's apartment is empty. Don't pay attention to it. Let me handle it. Yong man, do you think this is a night club? I've just moved in and I have to put up with neighbors like you. Stop banging that piano or I'll call the doorman. Maybe even police! - I'm sorry, Mrs. - Miss! It was or new neighbor. She threatened to call police if you continue playing the piano. She must be a bitter bachelorette. If she is a bachelorette, I'll take her on with romantic music. Music calms the beasts. I guess not this one. Now I am the one protesting! Listen, I... I was playing the piano, I wanted to apologize. Oh, don't worry. The one banging was my aunt. She's a bit of a maniac, you know. - Elisa, whom are you with? - I'm coming, aunt. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What did you say to that witch? Witch? She was an angel. An angel? Are you short-sighted or just out of your mind? Yes, I have to confess she drove me crazy. It's Elisa, Ricardo, Elisa. Elisa, the witch? I definitely don't understand artists. - You're playing the piano again? - I'll play with the damper on. I feel like composing tonight. I'm going to sleep. See you tomorrow. To Elisa... I can give you my best smile To Elisa... I can build a world of tenderness To live this love with Elisa by my side To Elisa... I desire she and the breeze become one To Elisa... God has placed inside this chest a heart It will beat until I die next to my Elisa To Elisa... I give this dream of your story I'll be the owner To Elisa, she's my life To Elisa, I give this love To Elisa, she's my life To Elisa, I give this love To Elisa... I give this dream of your story I'll be the owner To Elisa, she's my life To Elisa, I give this love To Elisa, she's my life To Elisa, I give this love Rose, oh Rose the prettiest rose... Good morning, sleepy head. Did you spend the night on the couch? I composed until late at night. Then I laid down. I don't know if I composed or dreamed up a beautiful song. - The janitor told me everything. - What? About our neighbors. Elisa is the witch's niece. I just saw her. You were right, she is an angel. The janitor also told me she works in a boutique in Duffau Gallery. - It's her, right? - Yes. Elisa... Her partner is a cutie, too. When they get out, we'll pretend we were passing by. You introduce me to Elisa, and she'll introduce me to the cutie. - But they're gonna know. - So what. You leave it in my hands. Look, here they come. Oh! Excuse me. I always end up apologizing to you. What a coincidence, do you work here? Yes. Elisa, this is Ricardo, a friend of mine. - You are the new neighbor, right? - Right. Nice to meet you. Marta, my partner. What a coincidence to run into you like this. Yes, what a coincidence. - Are you going home? - Yes. - Me too, let me go with you. - Ok. - Do you live near Elisa's? - No, I live far from here. - I live in Castelar. - No way, what a coincidence. This must be fate, I'm going to Castelar as well. I'll go with you. I'll address you by your name, it's more casual that way. Shall we? Roberto, I'll go with Marta to Castelar. Bye. - See you tomorrow, Marta. - Bye. Shall we? - Hello, is Elisa here? - No, she just left with Marta. Thanks. Did you see? I stopped playing the piano. Don't pay attention to my aunt. She complains, but she loves it. She even turns the TV off when you sing. Maybe it sounds ridiculous, Ricardo is right. - Do you like my songs? - A lot. Specially when you play classical music. The other day you were playing To Elisa. I was thinking of you. You must have studied a lot to play like that. Yes, but not enough to fulfill my father's dreams. I came to Buenos Aires to study in the conservatory. I studied piano, harmony, composition. And when I was preparing for my first concert, I gave up. What a pity. Why did you quit? I thought I wouldn't make it. To be a soloist, you have to practice 8, 10 hours a day. A whole life, I guess. You must also have talent, and be lucky. But, enough talking about me. What about you? Me? My story is so ordinary. I live with my aunt. She's grumpy but she's really good. I finished high school and I work at a boutique. Just like another million girls. But you're different. - Different? - Yes. You have grace. - No on told you that? - I've been told so many things but I don't believe them. I believe in fate. It was meant for us to meet. Marta are you dumb? You haven't said a word. How do you expect me to speak if you don't shut up. You're a talking machine. Have you always been so trampling? Trampling? I'm a man of my times. We live in the space era, Marta. Everything must be done quickly. Well, then I must be from another age. Before I do something I think it over deeply. It seems a storm is about to break. It started raining. Here, cover up with this. What about you? I love getting wet. A careful man is worth a lot. It's like we are all alone at a hut in the woods. Yes, I know the story I'm Little Red Riding Hood, and you're the ferocious wolf. You're soaked up and it's all my fault. - I bet you'll get a cold. - No, I never get sick. - Come on in, come on in. - Thank you. Come on in Mrs... Ms. How is our dying man doing? You needn't have worried. I have nothing. I asked for your help because... I think he's boiling in fever. So you're the Beethoven who won't let us sleep, right? I don't need a thermometer. He's running with a fever big enough for a horse. Aunt... No need to call the doctor. All he needs is boiling milk, aspirin, cognac and some rest. He'll sweat a few liters and he's done. Done? You mean he... It means he's cured. There's a small problem. I need to go out. I'm presenting The Mice on TV today. - The Mice? - It's a hippie music band. Ok, you go with your mice, and I'll take care of this sick cat. Thank you very much Mrs... Miss. - Goodbye, Roberto. - Goodbye. We'll use this opportunity to tidy up this house from hell. I told you, you would get a cold. I'm glad I did. Thanks to that you're here. Darling, get the vacuum cleaner, twenty pounds of detergent and a dustpan. There's enough dirt here to fill up River Plate's basin. I'm in the wrong apartment. No, Mr. You're not wrong. It's just that everything I clean ends up better than new. I even cleaned Beethoven bust's teeth. - What about your patient? - Come see him. Here's your Federic Chopin, with no more fever. There's no beating homemade medicine. Thank you so much for it all. Roberto, the cleaning... Instead of thanking me, give up the noise at night. Well, it's time for us to go. Darling... Let me walk you to the door Mrs... - I mean, Miss... - Darling... - See you tomorrow. - Goodbye and thank you, Elisa. It was a wonderful cold. I hope to get sick again soon. Elisa... - Bye. - Bye. Darling! Let's go. Goodbye. That cold thing was just an excuse to have Elisa as your nurse? Obviously. I already have a great plan for the four of us to go out. I'm going with Elisa. You can have the aunt, she's single. I'd rather die. I'll go with my Marta. She plays hard to get but I'll tame her down. Give me, from yesterday the crazy desire Give me, the sweet scent from your mouth Give me, the crystal of your smile Give me a little more Give me, your world of illusions Give me, from your nights the passions Give me from your hair all the colors Give me a little more I cannot understand, I need you more than life itself You've managed to take the place of all the old things in me Making me live like this with your madness in a crazy ride That I'm trying to stop but I jjust can't seem to succeed Because all balance is now lost Because I love you so much Give me, the whirlwind of your years Give me, from your love the things I miss Give me, not thinking about tomorrow Give me more from you Damn! I'm in the wrong apartment again. - What is this? - Surprise. Our neighbors are coming for dinner. But Roberto, you're singing at the reception today. Today? I told you a thousand times! Thursday 20. - I forgot. What time? - Eleven, but it's two hours away. There's plenty of time, it's half past seven. - We have dinner and then... - Have you asked them? No, I'll call her now. What if they have an appointment? Come on. They never leave the house. What are you doing? We agreed that when I needed to talk to her I would play To Elisa. Look... it seems your system failed. I'm going to her house. If her aunt gets mad, so be it. - Didn't you hear the piano? - Yes. But I wasn't able to speak. I wanted to invite you two over for dinner. I'm sorry, Roberto. We have an appointment. - Well, it'll be some other day. - Believe me, I'm sorry. It's ok. Don't worry. - Bye. - Bye. - So? - They have an appointment. I saw it coming. I ran into the "appointment" in the elevator. The "appointment"? Yes, some book worm with a bunch of roses. I lost my appetite. I hate eating alone. It's not so bad. Get ready right now and off we are to the ball. Do you know what these receptions are like? Lobster, caviar, French champagne... Just as I told you. Those with money can do whatever they want. You never change, do you? - Ana. - Hi Guillermo. Congratulations. Your country house inauguration will be commented a lot. Yes, the press will say I've gathered the cream of the crop. I'd say the yoghurt of the crop, it's quite a sour cream to me. Guillermo, always so ironic. What about that band? What are they threatening us with? They're here accompanying a singer. I'm assuming he's one of your new discoveries. Don't be so terrible, it's the first time I've seen him. I don't believe you. I am that man, so easy to forget So easy to leave behind lost in the distance I am the one giving up my pain For I know your love, is walking away mercilessly I am not a man of virtue Neither does youth appreciate my existence I understand and justify your behavior Trying to ornament your current adolescence I'm not a prototype lover Neither do I awake any passions in your heart But I die when I see that you... are always trying to walk away But leave, when you want to as soon as possible Don't think that when you go away I'll die I'm dead since that very day When you stopped smiling being by my side I'm dead since that very day When you stopped smiling being by my side But leave, when you want to as soon as possible Don't think that when you go away I'll die I'm dead since that very day When you stopped smiling being by my side I'm dead since that very day When you stopped smiling being by my side Nice song. I liked it. "Easy to forget" I might have written it myself. What do you mean? It seems inspired on me. I'm easy to forget, aren't I? I always remember you. Yes, but not the way I'd like you to. Please Guillermo, we had agreed not to talk about it. You were awesome. I don't know. This is such a cold audience. Do you expect them to cheer you like in a tavern? They are the "elite". That blonde sure is an "elite" one. - He is one of a kind. - Unbelievable. Do you play classical music? Yes. Do you remember Study in Fa Minor by Chopin? I'm sorry but, are you examining me? No, I wouldn't have the authority for it. I would have liked to be a soloist, but I had no talent. That's why I like to help those who do have it. A man who plays Chopin like you do... Why do you lose your time singing insignificant music? It's a long story... I don't want to bore you. Yes... this isn't the right moment. But I want to hear that story. Come to my Buenos Aires house tomorrow at four. What do you think? Should I go? Of course you should. That woman can help you a lot. But what do I say to Elisa? Why should you explain anything to her? Well, because... - You and Elisa, is it serious? - What do you mean? Do you like her? Do you have feelings for her? - Of course. - And what about her? Then clear all doubts. Talk to her tomorrow. - Aren't you mad about last night? - Why? Because we didn't go for dinner. No, you already had an appointment. Elisa, can you come out for a while? I need to talk to you. - Is it very important? - No, but if you can... Ok, wait. Marta. Marta. Hi Roberto. What is it? I'm going out with Roberto. If Teresita comes, tell her I'll be right back. - Don't worry. - Shall we? - Bye. - Bye. Do you like working at the boutique? Yes, it's a great environment. Marta is a great partner. Besides, I always work with enthusiasm, with joy. Yes. That must be very important. I've always been in doubt. - I've never worked with joy. - Perhaps you're too ambitious. I'm happy with little. - I would be happy if... - lf what? No, nothing. Oh, no, don't leave me hanging like that. - What were you going to say? - Nothing, It was silly. It's already half past four. - Were you going anywhere? - Yes, I had an appointment. It's ok. Let's have something to drink at the rooftop. Let's go. - Hello Ana. - It's you Guillermo. - Were you expecting someone else? - No. And this empty cup? There's always an empty cup for potential guests. Since the potential guest didn't show up... I'll use the cup. It must be cold. I like it cold. Ana... there's something great about you you can't lie. Excuse me, Guillermo. I'll lay for a while. I have a terrible headache. If a potential guest arrives, shall I call you? No, I'm not here, if someone asks. Roberto, I have to go back. The boutique is closing. Wait, it's only five minutes. Elisa, I wanted to talk to you about something. You've been trying to tell me that for over an hour. But you don't. Yesterday, when I invited you over for dinner, there was a man. - Yes. - Is he special to you? That man wants to marry me. - What about you? - I told him it's not gonna happen. Why is that? Because I love someone else. - Who is that someone else? - You know it very well. Elisa... Ricardo! She loves me Ricardo! She loves me! She does! She loves me as much as I love her, Ricardo. See? She loves me. What's wrong? - What's that? A telegram? - Yes. Wait, it's about your father, you know. Give it to me! Poor old man of mine... Poor old man of mine... Son... I wanted to be strong, not to cry, but... Cry Mom, cry. Let it all out. Roberto, were did you go? To the river. Where we used to go fishing with Dad. That's the last thing your father composed. "Life goes on". Nice melody. - Aunt, where is Mom? - She is cooking. What day is it? Tuesday 10. You've been here for a week. A week... It must have been eternity, you're so used to the big city. Don't say that. I came to be with her. But I want to go back someday, and I'd like to take her with me. She won't move to Buenos Aires. Her house and memories are here. Everything is so sad in here. Not for her. She wouldn't be able to live without all of this. I'll go set the table. - Is Mrs. Emilia here? - Yes. Do you want me to call her? - I have these flowers for her. - I see. I find your face familiar. Your father sent you a photograph with me sitting by the piano. - So you are Carlitos. - Yes. Everytime I came I used to bring Mrs. Emilia some flowers. Who was that, Roberto? Carlitos, you didn't forget about the flowers. Thank you very much. My father wants me to go to Buenos Aires. To the conservatory. Is that so? Very good. Goodbye Mrs. Emilia. I just came to give you these flowers. Goodbye dear. And thanks for the flowers. I know... he reminds you of me, when I went to Buenos Aires. Yes. Your father loved Carlitos dearly. He said he was talented like you. I hope he won't let his family down, like I did. Don't say that. You're young. You can still do wonderful things. You know how much I appreciate your company. But there's nothing for you in this small town. - We'll discuss that later, Mom. - It's up to you. "I've only been here for a fortnight, Elisa and it feels like years since I last saw you. I wanted to talk my mom into coming with me but it's hopeless. She even advised me to come back. This time I'll do my best so I don't fail. To make my own path in life. Next Thursday I'll be by your side." I think it might be a great opportunity. It's the place to go, and on Mondays they present new artists. If they like you, I'm sure we can get a great deal. - What do you think? - I don't know, Ricardo. I'd like to find something serious, something reliable. But I'm a little confused. You lose nothing by trying. So? Don't you hear me? Ok, I'll go. Out! All sadness out! By the coldness of this table I'll get drunk Out! To the pain inside my soul It makes me lose my temper and it just won't let me think That's why I drink That's why I drink The coldness of august is carved on my face Of never-ending sorrow of the harsh adversity Searching through many glasses that mouth of yours It intoxicated my senses for I know you just won't come Out! To the pain inside my soul It makes me lose my temper and it just won't let me think Out! All sadness out! By the coldness of this table I'll get drunk That's why I drink That's why I drink Everything is over everybody is now gone Friends that I have lost, my life and my love My faith, my youth and my confidence My hope has died everything is dead Out! All sadness out! By the coldness of this table I'll get drunk Out! All of this bad dream out! I'm the owner of my own life, in alcohol I'll make it drown. Out! All of this bad dream out! I'm the owner of my own life, in alcohol I'll make it drown. That young man, isn't he the one who sang at your reception? Yes. What a coincidence to find him here. - Did you know he was performing? - No. - Are you sure? - Why would I lie to you? Then It's fate. - I don't understand. - Maybe you don't want to. Isn't he the potential guest you were waiting for? Guillermo, you used to play Polo. Is spying your new sport? - Please give me a call. - Thank you. Goodnight. What did he say? Well, they're now full. But probably next month. The usual. Next month... Don't be so pessimistic. At least they heard and applauded you. What good is that for me? How can you say that? It's important businessmen hear you. - Hello. Good evening. - Hello. How are you doing? It seems you do remember me after all. Why do you say that? You must have a terrible memory. You were supposed to come to my house but... it seems you forgot. No, I didn't. I just had some problems. Tomorrow, have you got any appointments? - No. - Ok. Come to my house at six. - Don't leave me waiting this time. - I won't madam. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. Professor, please come here. My apologies, Roberto. This is Mr. Milstein, great piano teacher. I wanted to know his opinion, but I thought his presence would limit you. That's why I asked him to hide. Tell us, Professor. Well, there's good raw material and fine skills. Would you teach him? As long as he abides by the rules you already know. I don't want him to waste his time, or mine. Ok Professor. I'll phone you to let you know the decision. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. What is expected from this guinea pig? What rules are those? You are expected to become an excellent pianist. And the rules are to focus exclusively on the piano. Practice, sacrifice... I've already tried it, but it was no good. You'll try again. But I'm going to need money, time, peace. That will be taken care of. Money... I'll get you a grant so you don't feel uncomfortable. Time... you'll have as much as you need. Peace... you will live and study at my country house. And all of that, in exchange for what? Something important, to feel I've contributed to your triumph. And what if I fail? Then it'll have been just a bad investment of time, and hope. But I have faith in you. Ana... Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were alone. Come on in Guillermo. I believe you know each other. Guillermo, Roberto. Pleased to meet you. I'll get going, madam. Just call me Ana. Madam sounds awful. Think it over and let me know. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Well... it seems like he is a rising star. Guillermo, I'm not in the mood for your sarcasm. He's a talented young man and I'm willing to help him. Is there anything wrong? I don't know what to do... Roberto, don't you want to be a pianist? - Yes. - Then why do you hesitate? Because if I take the grant I'll have to abide by a few conditions. And who is preventing you from doing that? I don't know... you, perhaps. - Me? - Yes. I'd have to study far away. Why does it have to be so far? The woman who got the grant for me wants me to be isolated. We'd only see each other from time to time. But you'll have some days off, then you can come see me. Yes, of course. - Lf it's the best for you... - For us. ...then it's worth the effort. Can you imagine? Colon theatre's billboards with your concert? No, no. Roberto! Roberto, what's wrong with you? I'm sorry, I was daydreaming of a concert at the Colon's. You still have a long way to go to get there. Hours, days, months of practice. Faster and deeper. Deeper. More. More. LIFE GOES ON - This day was the longest ever. - Are you going home. Where else do you want me to go? And you? Ricardo is picking me up. - How are things with him? - So-so. Tell me, what do you think of Ricardo? I don't know... he's cheerful. He's funny. - Yes, all players are funny. - There he is. Hi girls. - Any news from Roberto? - Yes, he called me last night. He says he is studying hard and he'll try to come soon I'm going to see him the day after tomorrow. Somebody wants to record his songs. I want to surprise him. Do you miss him? You figure. He's been studying for three months. That was nice, what is it? - Do you like it? - Yes. - Really? - Why are you so surprised? Well... you only care for classical music. I never thought you could be interested in such a simple song. That is unfair. I have a heart besides a brain. Please... I want to hear that song. - Weren't you about to leave? - I have time. Ok. Perhaps, when I open the door, Dead hopes will be reborn in me Perhaps I'll be your owner again Manufacturing dreams, how did I go this far? Perhaps, you'll have changed Perhaps your look will always remain the same Perhaps, with those ways of yours You destroy for once my final dream Perhaps, it'll be a smile Like a gentle breeze, reaching me Perhaps, a surprised look, perhaps puzzled, will appear on your face Perhaps, I'll regret all of this again You will hurt me because of the way you behave Perhaps, it's best for me to leave Before I surrender before you again Perhaps, you'll have changed Perhaps your look will always remain the same Perhaps, with those ways of yours You destroy for once my final dream Perhaps, it'll be a smile Like a gentle breeze, reaching me Perhaps, a surprsed look, perhaps puzzled, will appear on your face Perhaps, I'll regret all of this again You will hurt me because of the way you behave Perhaps, it's best for me to leave Before I surrender before you... before you... again Perhaps, I'll regret all of this again You will hurt me because of the way you behave Perhaps, it's best for me to leave Before I surrender before you... Before you... again It's truly beautiful. What's its name? "Opening the door". It's the story of a man afraid of falling in love again. You must never be afraid of falling in love. To Elisa... do you know its story? They say she was Beethoven's first love. They loved each other. But Beethoven's passion for music made them grow apart. - Hands up! - Ricardo! - How are you doing? - Great. I have excellent news. - Remember Gutiérrez, the editor? - Yes. He liked your songs and he's going to publish them. This is the contract for the first one, "Easy to Forget". Really? That's great. Let's hope the run of good luck will last. - Ricardo, did you see Elisa? - Yes. She's always waiting for your phone calls. Days are really long for her sometimes. Poor Elisa, she is so patient. - What about Marta? - Don't even mention her name. - She rebelled. - What? To the ladies tamer? I became the tamed tamer. I surrendered unconditionally. But, didn't you use to say women are nothing but headaches? Yes, and I still do. I'll just have to buy aspirins. How could they ruin a great movie like that? They're fucking animals and they need to be put to sleep. Sign the injunction with me and they'll know we ain't fucking around. - What do you think, E? - I think we should call Ari. One suit, two suit, three suit, four! Look, Billy, I'm with you, all right? But we have to talk to somebody first before we just sign an injunction. Can't afford to be pissing off another studio right now. - Pussy. - Asshole. All right, guys, chill. Call Ari. So who's picking up the tab on this little chow-down? Relax, Ari, my treat. Greetings, Ari. I always knew that you liked dick, Babs. I just didn't know you were a cocksucker. Please, join us. It's like a meeting of the five families. Maybe I should've had a gun taped up in the bathroom stall. Look, all the majors are here-- CAA, UTA, ICM, Endeavor, William Morris. Who the fuck invited APA? - There it is. - There's no spots. Just pull up in the red, I'll go grab one. All right. Cafe latte, $4.50. Well, actually, I'm on my 10th purchase, paid for the last nine, so you'll be paying for that, bad boy. Actually, I won't, 'cause we don't take those anymore. What do you mean? Too many people were counterfeiting them, so we stopped. Well, unfortunately, the only form of currency I have is that card, so either you accept that card or you're gonna have to eat that drink. I'm not gonna have to eat anything. Anybody ordering a cafe latte? - Right here. - Hey, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. That-- that's my drink. Get me the manager. Yeah, well, you tell Ari when you find him - that he needs to call me back. - I will indeed. - Ari's M.I.A. - What the fuck is he so busy with? Press conference is in three hours. We can't be sitting on our asses doing nothing. Attaboy, Vince. Well, fuck Ari! Fuck this injunction. - Let's handle this ourselves. - What do you have in mind? I got Jamie Burke's number from Lloyd. Don't waste your minutes. I already called. They ain't seeing nobody. Yeah, well, if they ever want to do another movie with Vince, they'll see us. I like your newfound balls, suit. My rapper's signing a big deal this month, but I still have time to handle Vince as well. Aw, shit. Excuse me. Can you leave your number on the windshield? Yeah. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. And I'm afraid I'm going to have to say no, 'cause I ain't going anywhere until I get my free cup of coffee! Jesus Christ, Drama! What the fuck? They discontinued my free coffee card. Listen, pal, I'll buy you the lousy $3 cup of coffee. You really want to get involved in this, dickhead? Drama, Drama, come on, come on! You don't need any more coffee. You're wired up enough as it is. You only got 15 minutes to get to Ed Burns. Fuck it. Fuck all of you! I'm gonna go get me a pilot! But I will be back and you will give me a free cup of coffee. Oh, fuck, the car! Hey! Hey, come back here! Turtle, call a cab! Come on, Ari, you really think we haven't been watching you? I don't know. Have you been watching me? Yes, we have. And we know what you've been up to. - What have I been to? - Why don't you tell us? Why should I tell you if you already know? All right, come on, this is getting us nowhere here. Let me just say this-- I've known you for 20 years. I always knew that you were a smug little rat with grand aspirations. That's why it was such a shock to me to see you sitting in that little boutique agency of yours for the last nine months. But I guess-- I've seen this before-- it's all a ruse in your master plan. Master plan? Look, Ari, simply put, we're here to assure you that the eight of us who represent most of the power in this town are lined up to say that if you go near one of our clients or one of our agents or even one of our highly-prized mailroom boys, we will all come down on you with the wrath of 10,000 suns. You know what's interesting... about that... is that you used the words "Master plan" and "rat" when talking about me, you Hitler-loving, anti-semitic cunt-bag. I can only hope, that 50% of the power at this table is as offended as I am. Ari! Is it true? Come on. Yes or no. Okay, you got me. I'm setting up my own shop. Thank you, thank you. Ari Gold is back and gonna be bigger than ever. But I assure you, and I swear this on my children's names, I have no intention of going after any of your clients or your agents. - Only his. - Really, Ari? Really, Terrance. And with whose money do you plan on funding all this, Ari? Yours, you cockney fuck. You signed the settlement papers, didn't you? Yes. But I didn't sign any checks and I won't. Ari, I'll happily spend $50 million over the next 10 years to make sure that you don't even get a dime today. Call everyone on that list. Emergency Hamlet session, now! Ari, Vince and E called twice. - And they do not seem happy. - I will call them back, Lloyd. Did you not fucking hear me? This is not a drill. This is an emergency! Well, who's going to man the phones? Fuck the phones, Lloyd! Unless Carmen Electra calls for an emergency titty-fuck, don't answer! 82% excellent. That's pretty good. It's more than pretty good. That's "Greek Wedding" good. And what these test scores tell us is that black-and-white is depressing. - People want color. - Why have those eyes - if people can't see 'em, Vince? - They might as well be brown. I didn't make this movie to show off my eye coloring. Vince, you not only look great in the movie, you are... great in the movie. And with this version we will attract a much broader audience. And isn't that what making movies is all about? Well, actually, I mean, it's an art film. The only way you know it's good is if most people hate it. I'm sorry, but we are not in the business of having people hate our movies. Guys, I love your passion, but trust me, there's nothing unartistic about making money. You're driving like a snail. - I could run faster than this. - All right, you know what? We're here. Go get 'em. - I'm 20 minutes late. - So run! All right! Great news. The Gold Standard Agency will be starting its expansion ahead of schedule. Instead of September 1, we are going to be starting today. Yeah! Slight problem, though. None of you will be getting paid for about six months. What? People, come on. The first year at google they paid their staff with paper clips. Now the guy that scrubbed the toilets has got a billion five. Who's with me? Come on, anybody? - I'm with you, Ari. - Like you've got a fucking choice. - Anybody else? Who's with me? - This is bullshit, Ari. - You cannot be serious. - You told us-- We had papers put in front of us today. - Come on, everybody, listen. - I have a choice. A little bit of patience, you guys, please. Come on, you gotta-- Hey, Babs, the traitorous skanks anonymous meeting's next door. Let's talk. I can't believe that you set me up after all I've done for you-- Ari, I needed to see your cards. - You've seen 'em. - How much do you need? - What? - Come on, I want to be partners. - Why? - Because I believe in you. And because I can't work with my ex-husband anymore. No shot, this is my deal. Ari, you have no money and I have too much. - So what do you want? - To fuck. Kidding. I want 60% and my name on top. - I'd rather fuck. - 55. - 45. - 51. 49. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Miller-Gold! Huh? We sound like a fuckin' beer. This was the one, Turtle. I'm officially a loser. I don't know about "officially." What do you want me to say, Drama? You gotta get the temper under control. - Yeah. - You gotta know that. I do, I do. In fact, I was thinking about taking that anger management thing - the judge recommended last year. - You should. - Hello? - Johnny Drama, Eddie Burns. Eddie? - Yeah, hey, look-- - Burns? I've been trying to get your number for over an hour, but nobody's picking up the phone at your agency. Really? Yeah, listen, I'm sorry I had to bail on you today. I got an emergency and I'm off to New York. - So you weren't at your office? - No. Christ, I was standing out there for like an hour. Well, look, I'm-- I'm real sorry, But I want to talk to you about this thing I'm shooting. Hey, look, Eddie, I know I can do this. I know you can do it too, Drama. Truth is, I really just wanted to see you today to make sure you hadn't aged too badly. Aged? Me? Come on! I got carded at Barney's Beanery Thursday night. Okay, okay, Drama. So you'll do this? Are you offering this to me? I don't have to audition or nothing? Drama, you did something for me when you passed on "Brothers McMullen." - I didn't pass. - Drama, come on. You passed to do a little arc on "90210," it's cool. I ended up having to put myself in the movie, changed my whole life. - Awesome. - All right, so I'll see you on set. Okay, thanks. I just got a pilot. Yes! Yeah! Victory! And anger management? Fuck anger management. Well, after seeing a cut of the film, we instantly fell in love with it. From the moment the end credits rolled, it was obvious to me... - Did you get it, Johnny? - Yep. - It's easier than I thought. - Congratulations, Drama. Thanks, bro. - There you are, Vincent. - Jesus, I thought you abandoned me. Never. I came as fast as I could. They're about to introduce you. Right. Look, I love you. Don't worry, I think I got this handled. - You cool with this? - You gotta do what you gotta do. - What's he gotta do? - Yeah, what's he gotta do? - You'll see. - Oh, great. ...a great young talent. Ah, these motherfuckin' pieces of shit. I'm gonna fuckin' hit somebody, there's no fuckin' doubt in my mind. Go lightly, Billy. Life is short. Go fuck your mother, Drama. - Where you been? - What, is there a problem? The house is packed, our boy is looking great. You know Barbara, right? Hey. See all these cameras? Each one represents a million dollars overseas. - Cha-ching. - I don't think so, Ari. Oh yeah? Why not? Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege... What? Speak. ...to introduce to you now the star of "Queens Boulevard," Mr. Vincent Chase. Vinnie! Thank you. "Queens Boulevard" is a masterpiece. And I'm not just saying that because I'm in it or to sell you. I'm saying it because I really truly believe it. Unfortunately, you'll never see the film I'm talking about, because these people up here, these execs, ripped out its soul. Because like all studios in this town they don't give a shit about art. They only care about one thing-- money. Fuck commerce! Any questions? Yes. Great start to the new company, huh? Blue, 18. Set. Hit. Hit. Zach. Zach. Crossbuck 30. Crossbuck 30. Crossbuck 30. Crossbuck 30. - Ready? - Ready. The Eagles will go for it on fourth down with 42 seconds left in the football game and no timeouts. Coach Taylor can get his first winning season for the Shiloh Christian Academy if they can pull this play off. Blue, 18. Set, hit. Avery will take the snap. He pitches back to Jacob Hall. Jacob's gonna try to pass it. He's got Jeremy Johnson going down the field. - Here come the Tigers. - Throw it, Jacob. Jacob's gonna try to tuck and run. And he's taken down at the 40-yard line and stopped there by Lewis Slaughter. Jeremy Johnson was wide open down the field. If he'd only had a few seconds more to throw this game might have had a different outcome. As it is, the Tigers will take over now, and will no doubt run out the clock ending Coach Grant Taylor's bid for his first winning season in six years. Now he'll have to wait until next season for that all-elusive winning record. That's if they let him come back next year. - Hi. - Get them, Claire. Hey, Grant. Come on, you all. Quit talking. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Hurry. What? You gotta be kidding me. - This had better be a joke. - No. Mandy said he came in this morning, got his papers. A player can't just transfer to another school. - He's gotta make a change of address. - He did. He's moving in with his dad. I can't believe that. This is the third time this has happened. Spend three years pouring into them, they get to their senior year they transfer to a rival school. Why? Well, because at the end of the season nobody wants to be on TV going, "We're number six, baby. We're number six. " Well, you asked. Just had to go there, didn't you? - Is it true Darren switched to Tucker? - We'll talk about it in a minute. - So it's true? - We'll talk about it in a minute. Huddle up. Coach, is it true that Darren transferred to Tucker? I got word that Darren did transfer to Tucker. - God. - Oh, my God. There goes the season. The season will be whatever we make it. Who's gonna take his place? He scored a third of our points. You let me worry about that. We're not starting as if it's doomsday. - Nobody's irreplaceable. - Darren is. Darren is not. There's more to a good football team than a running back. This ought to push you to take up the slack. Stop worrying about Darren. Start your drills. We got a game to play this Friday night. Let's go, Shiloh. Come on. Let's go. All right, guys. Why'd you park all the way out there? Had to. It died again. Why don't we get a new battery? I'll get Brady to help me tomorrow. I don't wanna think about it now. - Do you want me to take a look at it? - Stop it. Oh, sweetheart-- Grant, I don't know what that smell is. I've scrubbed everything I can. - It's terrible. - I know it is, but what else can I do? I don't even know where it's coming from. Well, this day stunk. Why shouldn't my house? - What do you mean? - Darren transferred to Tucker. What? He did not. Yep. Came by and got his papers, didn't even say goodbye. - Why? - Why do you think? Didn't see a chance of winning at Shiloh. But it ain't like Tucker's gonna guarantee him a scholarship. - Oh, I bet the boys are frustrated. - More than you know. I meant to throw that away. Did you think you were pregnant? I don't know. I just wanna be pregnant so bad that my mind plays tricks on me. You know, it's been four years since we started trying. Would you be opposed to me going to see a specialist? No. I'd just like to know what she says. Okay. I thought we were having spaghetti tonight. Stove's not working. You are kidding me. So we got a leak in the back room, the dryer only works half the time the car's dying on us and now the stove's broken. That's about right. No wonder I'm losing my hair. I love you. And now your Georgia Sports Break with Alicia Houston. The Richland Giants started practice as the school year gets under way. The team will be defending a three-year state championship run. Now they prepare to fight for a fourth. I'm here with head coach Bobby Lee Duke of the Giants. Coach Duke, how does this year look for the team? Alice, we've grown real fond of the state title. And we don't see any reason to give it up this year. I've got most of my starters coming back and I've got a strong bench. So I've only got one thing to say: Get off the tracks, because the freight train's coming. Move, move. I hope that's not a sign of the way the rest of the season's gonna go, coach. - Now, why did he have to say that? - Just let it go. I hate this car. Let's find somebody with jumper cables and let's go home. It's bad enough you lose your first game. Now I can't start my own car. This happens to everybody. Don't be embarrassed about it. - Do you have jumper cables? - Oh, sure. - Grant, I wasn't that embarrassed. - Then why did you hide? Why does this house have to stink so bad? You'll get used to it after a couple of hours. Honey, we gotta do something about the car. Because the only thing it does faithfully for us is break down. That's about right. Would it not be better just to get a small new car? - You know we can't afford that. - How do other people do it? Other people make more than 24,000 a year. You make 0000. That takes us to 30. Which is enough to help us with repairs occasionally not with a new car payment. Besides, there's other bills we don't normally have to pay. Like what? Like my doctor bill. You saw her today? - What did she say? - She said that I'm fine. My numbers are normal and she saw nothing that gave her concern. That's good. It doesn't mean the problem is with you. What else could it mean? We just may not have given it enough time. Four years? Are you still hoping we'll have a baby? You know I am. Me too. I catch myself thinking about it more and more. Don't you wanna know if something's preventing it? Are you afraid of getting checked out? Yes. Grant I'm still clinging to a hope that one day we'll have children. I imagine them running in this house. I hear them playing in the backyard or running to our bed in a thunderstorm. And I think about reading them stories and teaching them songs. And I just keep thinking how can I miss someone so much that I have never met? I'll go. Stanley. Stanley, do you wanna tell me what you're doing on the top of my desk? No. Do you have any idea how you got on top of my desk? No. I suggest you get down immediately. You two can tell Coach Taylor the reason you're late for practice today is because you've been sitting in detention. Come on. That was some serious humor. I'll get serious about your humor when you get serious about your studies. Fifty-five? Well, if you wanna announce your grade to the entire class you go right ahead. Fifty-seven. So basically we got the toughest schedule we ever had and less talent than we ever had. At least we got Dewey County on Friday night. That'll be a pretty easy win. I'm concerned it might be our only win. No, we'll pull three or four out. That'll give us another average season. I'm so sick of average seasons. - I gotta go. - Where are you going? - Got a doctor's appointment. - For what? - I have a doctor's appointment. - For what? Leave the man alone. He don't have to tell you. So, what's wrong with you, man? I'll be back in a couple hours. Now look what you did. You done made him mad. Me? You're the one that made him mad. No, not me. Besides, I know where he's going. Where? He's going to the hair doctor. The man is going bald. You hadn't noticed that whole underdeveloped region? Oh, you're one to talk, Slick. No, see, when a black man goes bald, he still looks good. Look at Michael Jordan, George Foreman, Samuel L. Jackson. Classy-looking brothers. Who you got? Kojak? Yeah, coach gonna get him some plugs. - Grant would not get plugs. - Don't laugh. You next. Your soccer skills get better every year, son. It doesn't matter. Shiloh doesn't have a soccer team. They play football. So? Why not kick for the football team? They've already got a good kicker. I'm sure they wouldn't mind having two good kickers. Dad, I'm too small. I really just don't feel like getting killed. Are you saying you're not interested or you'd like to try out but you're afraid? What if I don't even make the team? Well, you're already not on the team. I mean, you can't get any more not on the team than you are right now. - Okay, Dad. - David, you can't be afraid of failure. Everyone fails at some point. So you think I should try out for the football team? Well, if you're waiting around for soccer, it ain't gonna happen. Hike. - Yeah, Sam. - Yeah, baby. Coach Owens, have you got a minute? Yeah. Look, some of the men have been talking. We really wanna see this school succeed with our football program. And I know you feel the same way too. But, frankly, we don't ever see that happening while Coach Taylor is here. Well, you know we're in a rebuilding season. Look, I know he's a fine man and all, but he's had six years here and nothing significant to even show for it. You know, I honestly believe you would make a better head coach. Ready to go. Some of us have requested a meeting with Mr. Ryker. If you would just support us, I really believe this could go a lot easier. Mr. Pervis, I don't know. Look, it's not like we're trying to hurt the guy. What we're doing is for the benefit of the school. You just think about it. Good hustle, Casey. What was that about? What? Alvin Pervis. Oh, we were just talking. Everything all right? - Yeah. - Mr. Taylor. That was great, man. Good job. Yes. I'm Larry Childers. This is my son, David. He's a junior. - We're new to the school. - Good to meet you. - What can I do for you? - I just wanted to introduce myself. David wanted to know if it was too late to try out. - You a football player? - I've always played soccer. - I figured I could try out as a kicker. - Okay. I got a pretty good kicker but I don't mind letting you try out. Jonathan, come here. This is Jonathan. He holds for our main kicker, Joshua Webster. Jonathan, this is David Childers. He wants to try out as a kicker. Why don't you go try a few kicks to get your feet wet? All right, sure. Thank you, sir. If you don't mind, I'll just hang around till practice is over. No problem. Good to meet you. You all just move here? Yeah, from Athens. My dad got a job teaching at the college. That's cool. I'm used to kicking soccer balls, but I thought I could at least try out. Well, Josh is a pretty good kicker, but he's also a receiver. I think he likes that better than kicking. Here you go. I'm sorry. Man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Sorry about that. - It's all right. - Hey, watch it. - Sorry. Matt. - Let's go. - I'm going with Brock for a little while. - Not tonight. You're coming home. - Why? - Don't argue with me. Let's go. - No, Dad. I'll be home later. Matt. That old man still come every week to pray in the hallway? Mr. Bridges. Prays for the students as he passes their locker. How long has he been doing that? He's been praying for revival since before I got here. Lord knows we need it. Apathy in the school's about as bad as our football record. That reminds me. I think you should go ahead and let David Childers on the team. - You see something there? - Well, he's just used to playing soccer. He ain't that strong, but he shows promise. All right. I'll give him a shot. One, two, hit. What are you doing? Go. Let's stay in the game. No. No. Will someone tell me how we lost to Dewey County 21 to 7? Twenty-one to seven. Dewey County hasn't beaten Shiloh since you were in kindergarten. I don't know what you call that junk out there, but it sure wasn't football. Nine dropped passes, four fumbles, three interceptions. Their defense scored most of their points. You gave the game away. You can't win football games cam for. Here's a clue: He lives in this apartment. It's my baby brother Wade. You live together? Well, I'm actually... He has trouble holding down a job and he asked if he could spend a few weeks on my couch and it turned into three years. Now that's sisterly love: Free room, and board, and surveillance equipment. Look, you guys, this is my fault, you know. I should have never made it for him. You knew that he was a pervert. He's not. He... he's just troubled. I've always had to look out for him. We didn't have a pleasant childhood, right? You seem to be high functioning. Wade took the brunt of the abuse. He's a very sensitive boy. I think the people he caught with their pants down might disagree. Is this where the little peeper keeps his stuff? Please don't, Wade doesn't want anyone touching' his things. Just a peek. No. Charlie. Your brother is sick, okay? You're not doing him any favors. Help us stop him so we can get him the counseling he needs. (Benson) "Urine Luck"? (Munch) It must be good. They're sequels. What are you doing? Admiring your video collection. Wade, these are detectives. They know. I didn't break any laws. You did if you took any of these without the subject's consent. Now, uh, these look homemade, Wade. I can explain. Let's go back to our place. You'll love our facilities. Seriously, Wade, just tell me. What do you get out of it? I really don't feel like discussing it. Wade, I've got to commend you on your fine penmanship. Our friend here has been keeping a journal, detailing his toilet tour of Manhattan. You had no right to read that. You had no right to shoot the crap. The witness you ran over fleeing from the scene of the crime positively ID'ed you. That's how we got our search warrant. I can't stand people touching my things. Did you get anything off his computer? Footage from the cafe, yeah. Oh, did he write about it in his journal? Try May 2, 8:05 a.m. Please don't do this. "Female subject, fat butt. Urination, 33-second duration, marigold yellow." I wasn't hurting anyone. No, you violated hundreds of people. The videos were for my own private use. No one else was ever gonna see them. Just let me pay the fine so I can go. It doesn't work that way anymore. They passed Stephanie's Law in August. (Benson) Video voyeurism is now an E-felony. One to four years. Per count. No way. You serve those consecutively, you're lookin' at a life sentence. I wanna make a deal. (Stabler) Well, unfortunately, you don't have anything we want. No, I do. A real crime. Yeah, what is it? If you catch the guy, will you reduce my sentence? Depends. What have you got? Check out DVD 62 about an hour in. (Munch) This is from two weeks ago. (Stabler) "Saturday, 1:00 p.m." I'll spare you the details. The next one's three minutes after this. It's marked "NS." What's "NS"? "No Specimen." Here we go. (Fin) Oh, no. Not a kid. (Benson) Check out his right eye. It looks like he's been attacked. (Cragen) Recently. Maybe he ran in there to hide? Look, the door's shaking. (Stabler) Someone must have followed him in. (Fin) Don't open the door. The camera's going out. The toilet perv caught a sexual assault. And didn't do a thing to stop it. You watched that boy being molested? What are you doing? Look. Oh! Where were you? Where were you? I don't know what you're talking about. You were standing right outside. No. Watching. No, no. I saw it later. Wade, don't lie to me. That's not your MO. You like a live show. You saw that whole thing go down, you didn't even help? What was I supposed to do? Help him! Yeah, I told the cops that I caught the whole thing on my toilet cam. Where did it happen? Central Park. The camera didn't catch the guy's face. Describe him. I was on a bench 50 yards away. I never saw him. (Morales) Can't get what's not there. All we have is the perp's blue sweatshirt and jeans. (Fin) What about the boy? We'll never get an ID. It's too grainy. We have some new technology on loan from NASA. Let's see what it can do. The software is a video image stabilization system called VISAR. (Munch) That's what they used to solve that car wash abduction down in Florida. That's amazing. You could see just how fresh the cut over his eye is. Not to mention eye color: Blue. (Morales) I'll print it out for you. No, hold on, hold on. Go back out. There's a section that we kept replaying. We couldn't quite make it out. Right there. Go back a few frames. [Keyboard clicking] Zoom in. Something in the perp's hand. Can you enhance it? [Computer beeps] That's an athletic cup. He must have been playing some kind of sport in the park. He's wearing a soccer jersey. Well, that explains the cut over his eye. Probably got injured during the game. Yeah, which the pedophile may have been watching. (Morales) Guys, we've got something else. (Munch) What? The nails are manicured. The tips are white. Our molester is a woman. [Sighing] Well, that certainly narrows the suspect pool. Only 10 percent of all pedophiles are female. That we know of. It's definitely understudied and probably underreported. Patrol had a walk in the park that day. No one reported so much as a mugging. Which bathroom are we talking about? Wade says that it was close to the Boathouse Cafe. The nearest facility is Midtown here. There're a lot of practice fields in that area. The journal said the attack occurred around 1:03 p.m. I checked the team schedules. The closest field reserved for soccer was Vipers vs. Bulldogs. The boy's jersey was red and black. That's the Bulldogs. (Cragen) Talk to their coach. (Phil) That's Shane Madden, our star forward. Anything unusual happen at that game? Yeah, we were actually winning for once until Shane got thrown out. For what? Fighting with the other team's sweeper. Any adults get involved? Shane's mom ran onto the field: A real piece of work. How so? She's got a little too much team spirit in the liquid form. So she was drunk. Sure wasn't feeling any pain, not even when she fell on her ass. Trying to break up a fight? No. Joining in. She assaulted a kid? Verbally. She slipped in the mud before she could reach him and then she teetered off to clean herself up. I assume to the nearest restroom. How long after all that did Shane leave? Right away. He never came back. Any other women leave the game around that time? Not that I noticed. What school does Shane go to? Trumpet section, last chair on the right. You noticed any behavioral changes in the last two weeks? I don't have much interaction with him. Shane's a good student. Only problem cases get sent to the principal's office. We're gonna need to speak to his homeroom teacher. Uh, Fred Moynihan, Room 109. Do you have a place where we can speak to Shane privately? You're welcome to use my office. Go ahead and pull him out, please. I don't know what you're talking about. Shane. It was caught on tape. There was a hidden camera in the bathroom. It wasn't me. (Stabler) Well, it looks just like you. Even wearing your jersey. Who was it? Is it a stranger or someone you know? A stranger. (Benson) Can you describe her? Why? I thought you had her picture. We do. We just need you to tell us anything you can remember about her. You know what, I... I really don't want to do this. Shane, you have nothing to be ashamed of. You didn't do anything wrong. You guys suck. What happened? We're gonna need to talk to his parents. I don't know. There's just a mother and I use the term loosely. So you know about her problem? She came to speak to the kids on Career Day. It was horrible. Great lesson on the perils of drinking, though. What exactly is Mrs. Madden's career? A beautician. She works at a place called Creme de la Crop. The little girls just love him. They call him all the time. Ma'am, do you understand what happened to your son? He's a gorgeous kid, just like his father. Girls couldn't keep their hands off him either. Well, we're talking about an adult. Who would do something like that? (Benson) We understand that you had a little mishap at the game. Some idiot knocked me in a mud puddle. Where'd you go to clean yourself up? Bathroom. Happen to run into your son there? No. Would you mind if we took a look at your nails? Why? What the hell are you implying? Just that you both were in the restroom at the same time. I used the one at the Boathouse Cafe and then stayed for a drink. All right, how long were you there for? Oh, let's see. I was finishing my second beverage when Shane came and pulled me out. Did he say anything about what had happened? No, but who talks about sex with their mother? Did you notice any female spectators who didn't have a son there? Cindy Bellamy. (Benson) And who's that? Shane's babysitter until about a month ago. Used to love her, but one day ups and throws a fit. Says he doesn't need her anymore. What was she doin' there? I have no idea. [People chattering] I went to more of Shane's games than his own mom. Uh, while I was there, I networked a little, picked up three other gigs. So you were babysittin' another kid that day? Yeah, Davey Auerbach. (Cindy) Come on, Alex, Dylan? Five minute time-out. Separate rooms, come on. Told you. (Munch) You've got quite a way with the boys there. Yeah, I'm strict, but I always make sure they have fun. And 12 to 15 hours is nothing to sneeze at. Shame you were fired from the Madden gig. Shane said he was too old for a babysitter. (Fin) But too young for a girlfriend. [Birds chirping] I'd never do that to a kid. I'm dating one of my professors. I like them older. Now if you'll excuse me. Did you talk to Shane at that game? Yeah. I asked if things had gotten any better with his mom. (Munch) There was a problem? She's a total alky. I heard she was really knocking' them back at that game. I can't tell you how many times I was babysitting, she showed up hours late, blotto. A lot of times with a younger guy than who she left with. Must be rough on Shane. God knows what he's seen. When she's drunk, Mrs. Madden has no idea what she's doing. We're seriously looking at the mother? She was in the vicinity at the time of the attack. Witnesses say she was drunk. And when she drinks, she gets horny for younger guys. When I was on the bottle, I woke up with my share of regrettable bedmates. But her own son? (Fin) The more you drink, the blinder you get. And her alcoholic blackouts are legend. We canvassed the building. Everyone had a horror story. Like the time she woke up so drunk she couldn't find her own bathroom. Ended up pounding on a neighbor's door at 3:00 a.m., asking to use his. Naked. So at the very least, we're looking at an unfit mother. Where's the father? Babysitter said he split years ago. Apparently Shane took over some of his duties. Okay, but in the bedroom? You know how big a role alcohol plays in sexual assault. Before we stagger down this road, let's not rule out other possibilities. Shane's team has a game tomorrow. It should be the same crowd. Chat up the cheering sections, see if anybody saw anything. [Children chattering] Check out the redhead. Blue sweatshirt and jeans. Just like the perp in the video. Ma'am? Yes? "Soccer Mom." That's what it says. You got a boy on the team? Do you? No, but we'd like to talk to you about your outfit. What about it? Did you wear it to the game two weeks ago? I wear it to all the games. The Booster Club pushes them to pay for the pizza parties. Every mom in the league's got one. Of course I bought a shirt. Got to support my little man! [Cheering] Probably appreciate it a lot more if you were sober. Screw you. Ma'am, have you been drinking? No. No? Mind if I examine your travel cup? Oops. Okay, Mrs. Madden, you're in violation of Code 10-125 and we could arrest you right now. What do you want from me? Is this a school team? No, it's sponsored through the city. Shane's principal, Mrs. Rice, does she have a son on the team? (Jackie) No. [Children shouting] What's she doing here? Awfully close to the student body. She's awful popular around here. Looks like she has a thing for young boys in uniform. Principal Rice? Hey, good to see you again. Detectives. (Stabler) Who's this young man? Jason. My son. Really? You look way too young to have a son this age. Stepson. (Benson) Oh. His team just won. Congratulations. Do you play in the same league as Shane? Jason's 14. He's in an older division. But it's the same league. (Stabler) Where's your "Soccer Mom" shirt? I'm not big on sweatshirts. What are you talkin' about? You wear that stupid thing all the time. Yeah? Does your mom come to all your games? Oh, yeah. She's a diehard soccer fan. Must be. We saw you hanging out at the Pee-Wee League. I ran into a student. (Benson) Shane Madden. Did you run into him two weeks ago? No. I'm sorry. We're late for a pizza party. [People chattering] What do we know about the principal? No criminal records. Just a lifetime of good deeds. A stint in the Peace Corps, volunteer work, set up an adult literacy program. She was IS-41's Teacher of the Year in '96 and '98, promoted to principal three years ago. Nice gig for a pedophile. Absolute power over all those kids. It's just odd that there's never been so much as an allegation. What about her personal life? Married seven years to an architect, one stepson. Who happens to be two years older than the victim. Well, most pedophiles don't get caught with their first victim. Maybe she was fooling around with the stepson. Easy access. That's assuming that she's our perp. Can we place her at the game in question? We just sat through two riveting hours of a soccer video that I wrangled from some dad. No signs of the principal, but he did catch Shane's mom falling' on her ass. Well, the outfit's a crime, but it's not a match. Rules her out. Principal Rice had to have been there. Her kid said she goes to all of his games. We checked out where her stepson plays. The restroom is between the two fields. Come on, that's circumstantial, at best. Captain, you weren't there today. She couldn't get away from us fast enough. She never gave us a chance to find out what she and Shane were talking about. Ask him. Check out the stepson. (Fin) How do you get along with Meredith? Great. For a stepmom. Well, for any mom. I really got lucky with her. It sounds like you two are pretty tight. Well, I was a brat when she first moved in, but she's totally cool now. How so? Well, she helps with homework, comes to all my games, boring school plays, exciting stuff like that. Sounds good. No, it doesn't. What are you doin' here? Just checkin' in. You always come to school early to practice? Well, the noise, it, uh, gives my mom headaches. Well, I don't think it's your playing that gives her a headache. You know, Shane, I know you've got a tough situation at home. My mom, she, uh, she just needs extra help, you know? She gets sick a lot. Yeah. When you feel like talking to someone, that's my business card and you can give these people a call. Alateen? What's that? It's a support group for children of alcoholics. Thanks. [Sighing] Let's talk about your situation here at school. There's no situation. With Principal Rice. What about her? [Bell ringing] I have to get to class. We have her on tape. No, you don't. In that restroom. Yeah, we do. We talked to her. She won't say anything to you. Well, she has been getting a little weird lately. How so? She and my dad have been fighting. That's what married folks do. Yeah, but not them. They never fought before. [Children chattering] It's getting really bad, too. She even yelled at me. What did you get from the stepson? Nothing to indicate he'd been molested. What about Shane? He give her up? As good as. I just couldn't get him to say it. Not enough to remove a principal from school. Which way is the teacher's lounge? Meredith Rice. She's as straight-laced as they come, but the kids still love her. Did you ever see her interact with Shane Madden? Actually, she's pulled him from my class a couple of times recently. For what? I don't know. Shane handed me a note excusing him from gym class. Tell you the truth, I thought it was fake. Why is that? Looked like a kid wrote it. But I double-checked. Mrs. Rice confirmed it was her handwriting. Hey, hey, hey, hey. If Shane Madden passed through here, odds are he was written up. Should be here in the Disciplinary Action File. [Children chattering] (Benson) Principal Rice didn't write all these, did she? (Williams) In a public school, a lot of at-risk kids. I mean the handwriting. It looks like different people wrote these. No. Meredith meets with each one of them. [Children chattering] You're right, she is getting a little sloppy. Something weighing on her mind? She has been distracted lately, but aren't we all? So close to summer break. Hmm, nothing on Shane. Is Principal Rice available? Oh, I'm sorry. She's not back yet. Where is she? Home. Family emergency. (Stabler) Mr. Rice, have you had any contact with your wife? No, just tell me. Is she in some kind of danger, one of her problem students? Mr. Rice, how's your marriage? W-What? What are you talking about? We heard you were fighting. That's none of your business. Well, actually, it might be. At the time that your wife left school, a young man, a student, also went missing. So what, you think he kidnapped her? We think she kidnapped him. What are you talking about? Your wife's been molesting that boy. That's a lie. We have it on tape. I'm sorry. Have you noticed any inappropriate behavior between Meredith and your son? [Grunting] Now, I've got a 12-year-old boy who's in danger out there, and I need you to tell me what is going on with your wife! What is going on with her? I don't know. She's changed. No. She's changed, hasn't she? Yes. Yes. Please let me go. Relax. [Panting] She's changed. She hasn't been herself lately. She... She's preoccupied. She snaps at any little thing. She's... And in the bedroom she's insatiable. Are you telling me that she's screwed... She's not getting enough so she's screwing a little boy on the side? We just need to find her. Now do you have any idea where she might go? No. Does she have access to a car? We have a car, but we don't use it very often. Could you check with the garage? I got 911'ed out of my VICAP meeting. We got a cluster? Shane Madden went missing'. As did Principal Rice. We're thinking they're together? Yeah, and getting out of Dodge. Husband hasn't heard from her and she took his car. Long gone by now. We get out an APB? And an Amber alert. And unfortunately, the blue Ford Taurus is a very popular make and model. We're getting possible sightings from highways in the Tri-State area. She's gotta stop for food or gas at some point. We're tracking her ATM and credit cards? So far, no pops. She's either using cash or Shane's piggy-bank. Husband said the tank was near-empty. We've got a sighting. Where? Edgewater, New Jersey. Trucker's right behind them on the exit. Well, that's just outside the city. How sure is he it's them? He gave me the full plate number. Get movin'. [Police siren wailing] (policeman) Get out of the vehicle! Move in! (Stabler) Shane? (Benson) Back seat! (Stabler) Shane! (Shane) Help! (Benson) Exit the vehicle! Hands where we can see 'em! Go away! (Benson) Comply, now. Buddy, are you okay? I'm fine, but she's not. She... she's been throwing up. Please don't let them hurt her. Let's go. She's sick. All right. She's sick. You're under arrest for sexual assault and kidnapping of a minor. You have the right to remain silent. You give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. My head is splitting. I think I need a doctor. (Stabler) We've got a great company shrink you can see. You've got to be out of your mind to be running off with a sixth grader. I am not crazy. I know it's wrong. Good. Taking responsibility. That's the first step to setting it right. Look, you don't understand. That day at the soccer field was the first time. So help me understand what happened. He was crying. I followed him in there to make sure he was okay. The next thing I know, we're having sex. And that seems like a perfectly natural segue to you? Yes. You didn't notice that Shane was trying to get away from you? The first time. But after that, he couldn't get enough. It was his idea to run. You always take orders from sixth graders? My life is fallin' apart and I don't know why. Now look, what are you gonna do? You're obviously attracted to young boys. This is a nightmare. I swear I have never done anything like this before. What, being caught? You have. On tape. Now you've to deal with it. I am not a pedophile. I love my husband. I love my job. I'll bet you do. A lot of young boys to choose from. Stop it. Tell me what you did to the child. That's a bad idea. Come on, let's get it on. Are you crazy? You're out of your mind! [Groaning] Is there a problem here? No problem. I think she's going for an insanity defense. [Grunting] She's having a seizure. Call an ambulance. (Benson) The tox screen is clean. We're still waiting for the head CT. Oh, yeah. I don't know what the hell happened in there. It was an accident. She assaulted you and you have witnesses, Elliot. Rat Squad IAB at 2:00. Sgt. Tucker. Det. Stabler. Sorry to interrupt your beauty sleep, but I'll be waiting for my union rep. Smart move if you got something to hide. He was sexually assaulted. Oh, what a surprise. The partner's gonna back him up. Yeah, how would you feel if a perp had your boys in a vise grip? Cuff her, not bash her brains in. I thought I used appropriate force. I was just reading up about your thoughts. Suspended four years ago for tellin' the company shrink you, uh, dreamed about killin' pedophiles. Thought about it, never did it. You're gettin' closer and closer. (Beresford) Detectives? How is she? Not good. We found something in her CT. We're rushing her into surgery right now. From a blow to the head? No. This was a pre-existing condition. Brain tumor, the size of a baseball. [Woman chattering on PA system] We were in there eight hours. It looks like we got it all. Great. Now here's my problem. The law says she needs to be arraigned within 24 hours of her arrest. Uh, I just opened up this woman's skull, and excised a malignant lesion 9 centimeters long. I'm afraid you're gonna miss that deadline. Well, I've gotten an abeyance, but I still need to proceed in a timely manner. She'll be in the hospital for five, six days. All right, that's fine. I can get a judge and a clerk down here for a bedside arraignment. I wasn't aware that judges made house calls. Just tell me when she'll be lucid enough to be swearable. May I ask what exactly is she charged with? She molested a 12-year-old whom she subsequently kidnapped. [Sighing] You do know that frontal lobe damage can diminish impulse control. This woman knew what she was doing was wrong. You know, that's right. The area of the brain that stores moral knowledge is not affected, but look at this. This is Meredith's head CT. The tumor is here. In the right orbitofrontal cortex which controls behavior. That's fascinating, but I'm not performing brain surgery here. I'm just trying to get a pedophile off the street. Without the tumor, she might not be one anymore. So what? Give her a doctor's note? "Please excuse Meredith for molesting boys. She had a bad tumor." To tell you the truth, this looks like a textbook case of acquired sociopathy. Well, how do I know the tumor caused it? Maybe she'd been a predator all along, and the tumor just made her sloppy? I doubt it. Shane is our only known victim. Not as of this morning. Three additional boys have come forward. Raped? No, one sent to her office was hugged and kissed. The other two were fondled. When? All in the last month. She's committed multiple felonies. She has to pay for them. Not if she lacked the mens rea. It's obvious that the lesion disinhibited her. The question you have to answer is: Did she act on these pedophilic tendencies before the tumor? And are those tendencies still there? Understand, this test is still in the experimental stages. So we'll be viewing her PET scan in here while she's watching the erotic videos on those goggles. Yeah, brain-mapping is not an exact science yet. But we do know the areas of the brain that respond to arousal and pleasure. And we'll be able to view activity on the anterior singulate? Trust me, you won't. I no longer have those feelings. What is that exactly? It's a very tiny amount of radiation. The same exposure you'd get flying across the country five times. We're good to go. How're you feeling? Like my old self again. Well, we really appreciate your cooperation. I want to do this. Hopefully, this test will give us some answers. Please believe me. I tried to stop. Did you? I knew it was wrong. But the urges were so strong that they just took over my mind, my body. L... I couldn't control myself. Every day it got worse. I am the last person who would ever do anything like this. Why? I know the damage it can cause. When did it happen to you? It started when I was eight. It lasted four years. Was it someone that you knew? Someone I loved. My grandfather. (Dr. Morella) Ready? (Stabler) So that's a pedophile's brain, huh? No, this is. One who's currently incarcerated. According to Meredith Rice's PET scan, she's no longer a threat to society. She showed no reaction to the pedophilic stimuli. If she had, the area right in here would be red. Unless it meets the Daubert test for scientific reliability, it's not admissible in court. Well, look at the handwriting. I mean, it went back to normal as soon as the tumor was removed. So what do we do, we let her go? Oh, if we let her off, it opens the door for every rapist and violent criminal who wants to find a medical excuse. Yeah, and tomorrow there'll be a run on the PET scan lab. Wouldn't it be great if that was true, if we could actually isolate the part of the brain that makes somebody a pedophile? And they could be fixed. How? Mandatory screenings at birth to zap some part of the brain we don't even know exists? The tumor changed her behavior, but that alone didn't make her a pedophile. She had a lower set point to begin with. (Benson) What the hell is that supposed to mean? She was molested as a child, and like having any predisposition to high blood pressure or cholesterol, she had a higher risk of becoming an offender. But she never acted on it until the tumor wiped out her impulse control. I found a similar case in Virginia. Upstanding citizen, loving husband and father, became a pedophile out of the blue. Let me guess. Same brain tumor. It was discovered in jail. It was removed and he was considered cured. (Benson) Did they release him? Yeah. A year later, he molested again. So it wasn't the tumor at all? No, it was the tumor. It had just grown back. So it's not her fault and she's perfectly cured, but if the lesion recurs, she'll do it again. What are you gonna do, Counselor? She pleads to Rape Three, five years probation and periodic psychiatric and medical evaluations. We might be amenable to that. I'm not done yet. She's also not to have any future contact with any of her victims. Of course not. There are already restraining orders in place. We're not contesting them. And she registers as a sex offender. What? Come on, Casey. Is that really necessary? (Novak) Yes. The registry was set up to protect the public from sexual predators at risk of offending again. But that's not me. This only happened because of the tumor. What are you going to do if it grows back? She gets branded a sex offender, she can never work in the school system again. She can never work with kids. Better safe than sorry. Then I think we'll take our chances at trial. This is a noble woman who suffered a freak brain tumor. Everyone fears the Big C. Once I remind the jurors it could happen to any one of them, they'll acquit. (Rice) No. I'll take the plea. Meredith, you don't need to do that. Yes, I do. She's right. The children have to be protected. It's a responsibility I need to take. You're getting pretty good. It doesn't matter. I dropped out of band... and soccer. [Siren wailing] If I could, I'd drop out of school. Kids giving you a hard time? Jason Rice slugged me in the cafeteria. He said he'd kick my ass for busting up his family. He said he'd kill me. I'll talk to him, okay? Why won't she talk to me? I must have called her a 100 times and she never picked up. Shane, she can't. She goes to jail if she does. She talked to me. She cared about me. I thought she loved me. Shane, she was very sick. And what she did, it's... it's not your fault. And she's better now, but I gotta tell you, I'm more concerned about you. [Sobs] I just wanna die. Then we're going to get you some help. Trust me, you're gonna get over this. The real damage hasn't even begun to set in for Shane. This kid's gonna need extensive therapy. And a strong support system. He's not gonna get that at home. Not with his mother. I think she's the reason why Shane was susceptible to a mother figure in the first place. The kid's so screwed up, he doesn't even know he's a victim. He still thinks he's in love with Meredith. It's unfortunate that his first sexual experience was non-consensual. But it's even worse that he developed feelings for his abuser. (Benson) What are the odds that he's going to have a healthy sex life? Not good. But they're ideal that he'll become an offender himself. The cycle of abuse just keeps turning. So when he grows up, he's gonna have a low opinion of women and be able to rationalize having sex with a child. How do you stop that from happening? (Huang) I think the answer lies in Meredith herself. If she truly wants to help Shane, she'll let us study her brain. Maybe we can really locate the part that creates a pedophile and then fix it. Meredith Rice hasn't changed. Patrol just responded to an incident at her address. (Bamford) My partner's with the victim. She took a pretty bad beating. She's going after another boy? This one fought back. You've got it backwards. There's no boy involved. So who attacked her? You heard the woman. She's not pressing charges. I am. Oh, Mrs. Madden, what happened here? That perverted bitch is still chasing my little boy! Is that true? I can explain. Tell it to the judge. She broke her restraining order. I want her arrested. What did she do? She called Shane, in my home. Thank God I happened to pick up the extension. What's wrong with you? Everything. And you think the best person to commiserate with is your 12-year-old victim? That's not why I called him. Tell them. Tell them why you called Shane! It doesn't matter why she called him. You broke one of the conditions of your probation. Which means you're under arrest. I thought he had a right to know. Know what? I'm pregnant. And I did agonize, but I felt like he needed to know. He is the father. She's having my baby's baby. (Stabler) Let's go. I want it terminated. It's not your decision, ma'am. You have no say over her reproductive rights. You didn't need to lay this on the little boy. What were you doin'? I don't know. My husband's leavin' me, my stepson won't even talk to me, I've lost my home, my job, and the irony is, all I've ever wanted is a baby of my own. Be careful what you wish for, huh? Wow. Do you know what Ayatollah Khomeini's first name was? What? Ruhollah. So? What'd you think it was? Ayatollah. Ayatollah's not a name. It's a title. Pffft! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you just give me a 'Pffft'? Like I'm some kind of idiot for thinking that Ayatollah could be a first name? Ok, you're not an idiot. It's just not a name, ok? Oh, really? It just so happens that I played high-school baseball with a guy named Ayatollah. Really? Yep. Ayatollah Rodriguez. That's funny. You never mentioned him before. Really? I never mentioned Tollie? That's weird, 'cause we were pretty tight. I actually took his sister Beth to the junior prom. Doug, I'm gonna make you an offer, okay? Stop talking right now, and we can pretend this never happened. I'm not gonna pretend my best friend from high school never happened. Hello? Yes, hello. This is, uh, Ayatollah Rodriguez. Is my old high-school baseball friend, Doug, there? Oy. Explain to me what I'm looking at? Before you judge me, let me walk you through it. I settled in, I started eating, and then I realized I didn't have a place to put the bones. I didn't want to put 'em on the sheets, 'cause you made it very clear you don't like that. Long story short, I've invented the shirt plate. Doug, I left dinner for you in the refrigerator. I didn't see it. No? 'Cause I labeled it "Doug's dinner. " Oh, I thought that said "Dog's dinner. " I figured you were surprising me with a puppy. Come on. This isn't funny. You're telling me. All day long, I thought I was getting a puppy. Honey, you promised me you would stick to your diet. Aren't you at all concerned about your health? I'll tell you what I am concerned about. My blue cheese cup am empty. Ow! Carrie! Look at this. Low-fat mayo, cottage cheese, garden burgers, all untouched. Why do I even bother buying this stuff? That's what I've been saying! Ow! You gotta find a new go-to move. Doug, it's just so frustrating. I mean over and over again, you promise me you're gonna lose weight, and then you actually do it, and then I'm so proud of you, and then every single time, without fail, you fall off the wagon. And then you eat the wagon. Calm down. I'll be fine. Doug, you're not fine, okay? Your eating is out of control. Would you back it off? Yeah, fine, fine. I will back off. Okay, 'cause I am tired of banging my head against the wall. W - You know what? Here, here. Have cookies for dinner, okay? I give up. I officially give up. You happy? What are you doing? ! You said you gave up! I'm telling you, Doug, as soon as I heard about this overeaters support group, I had a really good feeling about it. And I've got a bad feeling. It's called hunger. We just had a delicious dinner. It was salmon. Salmon's delicious. The hell it is. The only people who like salmon are bears. Okay, Doug, you really need this group, okay? And, listen, you're gonna be meeting people who are struggling with the same things you are. It's gonna be me and a roomful of big, fat losers! Now that is not true. Okay, they may be big, but they are not losers. I bet you they're really cool. Yeah, that guy they had to cut out of his apartment, he's super cool. Well, in a way, he was. I mean we're talking about him right now. And that's cool. I don't want to do this, come on. Honey, You have to go. I don't. You do. Doug... Sometimes when you look at me, I think you're seeing a giant pork chop with my head on it. With your head on it? Get over yourself. All right, go. Is there even any dip? Okay, people, let's get started. You there. You're new. What's your name? Me? Uh, Doug. Welcome, Doug. I'm Neil. Please, join us. Is this how to hem your own pants? No, Doug. This is a group for men in abusive relationships. Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here. I'll put these back. Except for this one,'cause I put a thumb print in it already. Doug, Yeah? We all know what you're going through. You're scared. You don't want to admit there's a problem, but you were brave enough to come here tonight. Be brave enough to stay. Really, I, uh- I don't belong here. We all felt that way at first, Doug. Yeah, it's true. So, why are you here tonight? You had doughnuts. And who doesn't let you have doughnuts, Doug? My wife. But the thing is- Does she ever yell at you about eating doughnuts? Yeah. Does it ever get physical? Hit you, slap you, throw things at you? Yesterday she... twisted my nipples. And does all of her anger just make you want to eat more? Okay. No, it's not okay, Doug. But it's how you get by, isn't it? So you're saying... my overeating is... her fault. I think that's what you're saying, Doug. Then she comes in like hell on wheels, "You're so fat!" "Don't eat that off your chest! I can't believe you're so fat!" She wonders why I gain weight. I mean, maybe it's 'cause all the names she calls me. You know. Fatty. Chunky. Sir Eats-a-Lot. So she starts yelling at the waiter. Now... I can't look at the poor guy, and I... certainly can't look at her, so I look down at my plate. Hello, jambalaya. You won't twist my nipples, will you? Mr. Big-pants. Fat Damon. Enormo the clown. Enormo. You know what? My name is Doug. Just Doug. It's just Doug. Hey, baby. How'd it go tonight? It was good. Have you been crying? A little. You get into some stuff in there. Oh, honey. I am so proud of you. Hey! Moron, watch where you're going! Magoo, mooooove! Friggin' idiot. I really appreciate you checking up on me, Neil, but I'm doing all right. Yeah, she's gonna be home any minute, so I can't stay on the phone much longer. Yes. No, I'll be at the meeting. All right then. I'll see you- What's that? Oh, yeah. I will not let the rage of others destroy the light in me. Okay. Hey, Doug, I'm just dropping off Arthur's bill, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. Are you an alcoholic? No. Oh, me, neither. So, w - What was that all about? Oh, it's a, uh, long story, but it turns out it's Carrie's anger that makes me eat so much. No! Yeah, I was surprised, too. Wow. How about that? This whole time, she had me convinced it was my fault, but my support group helped me realize that Carrie's bad temper is the problem. She drives me straight into the loving arms of food. Maybe that's what happened with my brother and his wife. Except that she drove him straight into the loving arms of their nanny. I'm gonna kill our pharmacist! Oh, God. Come. Through the back door. We'll drive all night. Come! Hey, Car. Hey. So, I go to pick up my prescription from the pharmacy, and I'm in line for like 20 freaking minutes, because the pharmacist is a million years old. Then I finally get to the front of the line, and Rip van Senile says, "That'll be $98." And I go, "No, our insurance covers this. ", and he says, "No, it doesn't. " I just- I hate old people. Where's our insurance bill? Um, maybe it's upstairs. Why would it be upstairs? Did you put it there? No, I - I was just trying to help you out. Why are you acting so weird? I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? I don't know. Well, just help me find it. You poor man. Hi, honey. Hey, I'm headin' out. Oh, you have your, uh, support group tonight? Yes, I do. I gotta tell you, Doug, I am really proud of you, honey. I mean, I know it was the last thing you wanted to do, but you did it, and you stuck with it, and now look at you. Doug? Yeah? Are you, um... getting fatter? No. No? 'cause it seems like you're much more... fatter. Can't be. I've been going to my overeaters group for weeks. Are you sure they're not teaching you how to overeat? Ah - You know what it is? They told me I'd gain weight before I lose it. Actually, that's their motto. "You'll gain weight before you lose it. " That's a bad motto. Mmm. Well, they're fat. They're not Shakespeare. I'll see you later. Hey, uh, what do you talk about at these classes? I mean, what gets said? What do you mean? Well, what's supposed to motivate you to lose weight? Oh, well first class, we talked about famous fat people, like Marlon Brando and that lady from The Practice. What's the point of that? It just gets us to feel like, "Hey, you know, maybe you're fat, but famous people are fat, too. " Uh-huh, uh-huh. What else? Uh, well, the second day, obviously, we talked about famous skinny people, like that other lady from The Practice. And, uh... Stan Laurel. Stan Laurel? Yeah, it gives us a goal of what we want to look like. And you want to look like Stan Laurel? Hey, from your lips to God's ears, huh? All right. Excuse me. Is, uh, Doug Heffernan here? Who? Doug Heffernan. He's in this class. No, we don't have anyone named Doug here. Isn't this the overeaters support group? No, this is Jazzercise. Why do you have to hurt? You know what it is? You gotta continuously remind yourself, it's not your fault. Oh, my god. This is made with real butter. Hello, Doug. Carrie. Oh, God. Maury, this is, uh, my wife, Carrie. Hello. Okay, you have 5 seconds to tell me what's going on here. What's going on here is I'm in the middle of my overeaters group. Doug, you're eating cake. Yes, but what you didn't see is we eat the cake while looking at a picture of Hitler. That's how they get us to hate cake. Yuck! Okay, what is going on? What group is this? All right. It might be a class for men in abusive relationships. What? Yeah, that's right. I came for the doughnuts, but I stayed for the insights. What insights? Well, I learned that... your anger makes me eat. What? ! That's right. Whenever you get mad, you start yelling at me, I need an escape, so I turn to food. That makes you my- What do you call her again? Your behavior catalyst. Behavior catalyst, okay? So if you want to blame somebody for my weight, maybe you should take a hard look in the mirror. You're a lying sack of crap. Great. Now I'm hungry. Carrie... I'm Neil. Welcome. Mm-hmm. Doug is simply trying to break a cycle of verbal and physical abuse. Physical abuse? He told you that I physically abuse him? He told us about everything, Carrie. The purple nurples. The atomic wedgies. That scar on his arm. You got that scar from a hot-dog eating contest! Yeah, a hot-dog eating contest I only entered because you're so mean! Oh, really? And did you also set a new record 'cause I'm so mean? Could be. Let me ask you something, Neil. Did he happen to mention that he was fat the day that I met him? Well, no. No. Because he was. Yeah, what were you then? Huh? High two hundreds? No, not high. Mid to high. And did he also happen to mention that he was the biggest kid in nursery school? That all the other parents thought he was a teacher? No. No. Tell him about the special desk, Doug. All right, fine! So maybe I was fat when I met you, but you know what? You're still an angry person. Well, I'm angry because you're always eating. And I'm always eating 'cause you're always angry. Okay, looks like we have a little chicken-and-egg thing going on right now. Oh, I bet you want to have chicken and eggs now, huh? Okay, that's it. You know what? I'll go to my overeaters group if you go to an anger management group. I don't need anger management. Oh, really? Well why don't you tell that to Maury, who you almost ran over, or that pharmacist who you yelled at, or that librarian you got fired? All right, okay, sometimes I get mad, but that's only because I have to. Oh, really? Why don't you tell that to the sidewalk Santa that you cursed out last Christmas? Let me tell you something. If it'll make you go down a couple of neck sizes, I will go to anger management. Great, 'cause they have a class going on upstairs right now. Well, I'll go if you'll go to your overeaters group. Fine! Let's do it! Let's do it! This is for the chicken-and-egg crack. This is great. We haven't had date night in a while. I know. Well, we deserve it. I mean, you're sticking to your diet. Got my rice cakes. And, uh. I've mellowed out. It's-it's much better. Much better. And my nipples have healed up nicely. Those are taken. Oh, okay. Excuse me. Uh, uh, uh. Those, too. All the way down to that guy. Okay, one guy saving 20 seats. No law against that. See? How good was I? That was very good. But where are we gonna sit? Never sat in the front row before. Me, neither. Mmm. Plain. Tell me if anything good happens over there. Right. Yeah, I think it's great that we're trying to improve ourselves. Oh, yeah. I just think that all these improvements are upsetting our balance as a couple. Yeah. Something's a little off, right? I mean, what should we do? Well, I'm just gonna throw this out at you, okay? What if I were to, uh, let you eat these Milk Duds? Would you let me go back there to the seats we're supposed to be in, and drop-kick that douche into the lobby? I didn't hear a word after "Milk Duds. " Thank God. What, do you own the movie theater? Move the coat, or I'm gonna shove it down your throat! There you go. Check it out. I made a Milk Dud sandwich. It's a dudwich. Ron was supposed to be saving these seats for us. You're up again. You're all gonna die. Hello, darling. Managed to slip away, but I think I sprang my bloody wrist. Oh, John... How is work? Fine, thanks. I'm doing a big abstract to the International Exhibition. How's yours? I might be making some progress in the Ridgeway's Disease. I've a patient in Hammersmith Hospital, Mrs. Crabtree, she's a driver's wife, I believe, she's dying of Ridgeway's. But she's allowed me to try some new treatments on her. By God, she's got some spirit! Poor, frightened old thing that she is. And all I get from Gerda is, "Why are you out so late?" Well, sometimes you're with me. Hmm, but all the time I'm married to Gerda. It's what you wanted, isn't it? Yes. Will I see you this weekend? - Yes. Are you going? - Yes. - Well, that will be lovely. - Yes. Henrietta, come here. It's going to be a complete disaster. It's always the same when I invite Gerda. I wish I hadn't, but the worst thing is that she's so terribly nice. One has to have her, of course, it would be so terribly rude to invite John without her. On the other hand, it does seem so odd, doen't it? Someone as nice as Gerda should be so voyd of any kind of intelligence. I often think, if she had any spirit at all, she'd stay away. Henrietta will help, of course. Strange how good Henrietta is with Gerda. - What're you talking about, Lucy? - The weekend is upon us, Midge. The guests will be arriving any minute. And I'm just trusting to Henrietta to make conversation, because John and Gerda it's a nightmare, John and Gerda. Lucy, do you know what time it is? I'm sorry, darling, I have absolutely no idea what time it is. It's a quarter past six! Midge, I am sorry! Why didn't you tell me? Come, come, come, go back to your dreams. Good night. - There you are, Mrs. Pearstock. - Thank you very much, Dr. Christow. Goodbye. Are you alright? I'm tired. A weekend in the country will make you feel better. Yes. Unfortunately, Gerda is driving. - Victor! - Mr. Poirot, sir, have a good trip? Without incident, thank you. Victor, Victor, what is that smell? - Smell? Can't smell anything, sir. Just good country air. Collie, the telephone number is on the pad, in the surgery. Call me if there's trouble. There'll be no trouble, Dr. Christow. - Goodbye, children. - Bye, daddy! Be good! It won't start. Switch on the ignition, Gerda! - I'm so stupid. I'm sorry. - Let's just get there, shall we? I wish we could stay at home. The Angkatell frighten the life out of me. - Goodbye, children! - Bye mummy. Bye daddy! The weather's said fair for the weekend. Everything's spick and span (immaculate) at the cottage, the wife's seen to that. I am sure I shall be most comfortable. It will be a relief, I expect, escape the fumes and stink of London. I say! Milles tonnerres! Why must you spent so many hours at the hospital when you've a perfectly surgery at home? It's research, Gerda! Research, as I've explained before. - Why are you slowing? - It might be about to turn red. - But it isn't, is it? It's green. - Oh! Sorry... I just become convinced it'd suddenly... Oh, God, Gerda! Gudgeon! Hello, Midge! Great to see you! - What a gorgeous car! - He's a Legonda. Goes like the wind! Thank you, Gudgeon. - Hello, Lucy. - Henrietta! Wonderful to see you. I supose that, by the time you take that magificent steed of yours to the stable, give it a rub down and a nosebag, lunch might be ready. - Who's coming? - The Christow. - And Edward's arriving after lunch. - Good. Looks like you'll have some company, Mr. Poirot. Someone has taken the cottage next door. Mr. Poirot! Enchanté, Madame. Everything is beautiful, as usual. But tell me, someone has taken up residence at Dovecotes? Yes, sir. A lady. An actrice, they say. How's the dreaded dress shop? Bloody awful! - Hello there! - Edward! Hello, Midge! Hello, Henrietta! But tell me, Madame Simms, what is this? I did not expect any mail to this address. It's from Lady Angkatell, up at The Hollow. Pour ce soir? How are things at Ainswick, Edward? Just as lovely as ever? Why don't you come and see? You're always welcome. Anytime. Anytime at all. You are sweet. And Ainswick is the best place in the world. Do you remember our special tree? Igdrasil. The secret sign we used to draw everywhere? Fancy a breath here? My God! Igdrasil. Who drew that? You did. So, what've you been doing, since I saw you last? Nothing. That sounds... peaceful. You could find peace at Ainswick, with me. I wish I wasn't so dreadfully fond of you, Edward. Makes it so much harder to go on saying " no". What you really mean is that you won't marry me because of John Christow. - Why doesn't the fellow get a divorce? - Because... That's it, isn't it? If there'd be no John Christow in the world, you'd marry me. I used to spent my holidays with Edward, at Ainswick. It seemed so vast. 14.000 acres, is bound to be vast, Midge. Oh, how I miss it! - Why didn't you inherit it, Lucy? - Midge, you know very well girls don't inherit. It's the way the world wags. Edward isn't even my cousin, he's family's second cousin. But he's still in tail. Ainswick falls like rain, right plop in his lap. - Aren't you remotely bitter about that? - No, of course not. I've invited that crime fellow for dinner. I'm sorry? That's why I was in your bedroom so early, this morning. I had this premonition, you see. That we were to have terrible foughts, for dinner. So, him being here, just could be a distraction. What crime man, Lucy? He was in Bagdad when Henry was High-Comissionary. He stays in one of those funny little cottages, down the lane. I remember he wore this pink flower on his button hole and he was solving something, I can't quite remember what. But of course I'm not terribly interested on who killed whom. I mean, once you're dead, you're dead it doesn't matter why, does it? I'm no good in anything. I don't know why you ever married me. You needed taking care of, that's why I married you. I try to be a good wife, John. This may not be the best time to tell you... You know I love you, don't you? Of course I know, but I have to warn you... No one else, just you. We'll never make it to Shovel Down in third. Very fair shooting, Edward. Now, there. Your turn, Henrietta. See if you can kill a burglar. - Well done! - No, you only winged him. Hello, everyone! Hello, Henry! - It's the Christow! - Hello. So sorry we're late. Not at all, not at all, just in time for sporting target practice. Nice to see you, John. Now then, Gerda, come along. - Try to put one in bullseye. I've never tried. - Hello, darling. - Darling. - I think you may have met Midge Hardcastle? - Yes, of course. And of course you know my second cousin, Edward. - How do you do, Edward? - Hello, John. - What's going on? - Henry's brought the artillery. Has he indeed? I sprang my bloody wrist. Careful. Did I miss? I bet I missed. My turn, is it? Gerda, how lovely to see you! Thank you, Henry. Come along, Gudgeon. I say, Lucy! That's nothing. Once, on the Asian side of the Bosphorus, I was jumped by a couple of thugs. We were rolling about in the dirt, we were. Then, before I knew it, she'd shot one in the leg and one in stomach. How she didn't hit me, God alone knows! It's quite simple! You do it very quickly and you don't think about it, Henry. Sena has in ballet class. Point shoes, the whole lot. - And Terence? - Chemistry. Always trying to blow things up. He's planning to make nitroglycerine while were away. - But don't tell John anything. - Oh, I shan't. - And you? - Oh, I've taken up Leathercraft. Do you like this? I made it. It's so nice talking to you. But I suppose it will soon be time for dinner. Gerda why do you come here if you hate it so much? I want John to be happy. - He could come without you. - No, he wouldn't like that. He wouldn't enjoy it without me. He said so. John is overly unselfish. I'd rather stay in Harley Street, to be frank, but he thinks it is good for me, to get out into the country. Oh, the country's alright. No need to throw in the Angkatells We're an odious family. Come on, let's go in and get changed. There's some sort of detective coming in, apparently. You wouldn't believe it. Monsieur Poirot has habilities one has to say, quite phenomenal. It's absolutely true, the talk about there was in Bagdad. Monsieur Poirot and his little "green" cells. Grey, Madame. Pardon me. But we're awfully lucky to have him as a neighbour. I mean, in case anything went wrong. Would you give it all up if I asked you to? And come and live with me? No. No? It's not really what you want. Couldn't you lie to me, just once? - Why? - Because I love you, Henrietta. But you're so... damn it all, so detached. Your art, your cars, your friends. I want you to think you only need me. Isn't that what Gerda does? Don't you tell me you care a damn about Gerda. Why not? I like Gerda. - Dinner, Milady. - Thank you, Gudgeon Please, Monsieur Poirot. Come this way. Merci. Has anyone seen John? Well, the customers are awful! One has to put up far more insolence in a dress shop than Gudgeon or Simmons or any decent domestic does here. It must be absolute hell, darling. But why does one has to be so proud? Anyone having to earn one's living, doesn't have to be the end, has it? It's all about self-esteem, surely? You're the expert on that. So, how do you do it then, Monsieur Poirot? I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle? To solve so many crimes? Merely I use the
