prepared in the depths of the kitchen. Blackie had never found a meal that tasted quite so good. He met the remainder of the boys of Tent Four at the table. Ken Haviland, the tent aide, was busily serving as waiter at one end; he had to run again and again to the serving window for additional platters of ham, potatoes, and turnips, mountains of bread and oceans of milk. Blackie didn’t envy him his job. Wally had evidently met all the boys in his group. He paused and, between mouthfuls, addressed them. “There’s one thing that’s worrying me, gentlemen of the famous Tent Four group. There are only seven of us, and there should be eight, counting myself. One of our number has not turned up. I shall call our imposing roll. Haviland!” “Here, sir.” Ken seized his serving tray and dashed off in pursuit of dessert. “Thorne! Here, I see. Slater!” “Here, sir!” answered a freckle-faced boy with burning red hair. “Guppy!” Blackie looked with interest at the boy with such a beautiful name. He was a little chap of about eleven, at the end of one row. “Lefkowitz!” “Present!” came a squeaky voice from across the table. “Gallegher!” “Here!” He was a sunburnt, black-haired chap with a scar across his forehead, shaped like a V. “Crampton! No answer. It is the notorious Mr. Crampton who is missing. Has anybody here ever heard tell of the gentleman?” “That must be Fat,” said Blackie. “We saw him down at the end of the lake before we hiked up. He was in the wagon then.” “Maybe that’s the fat fellow we dumped off the wagon coming along the road back of camp,” volunteered Slater. “We told him that walking was the best way to reduce his figger, and dumped him out.” “To our fat friend’s rescue, then, tent-mates!” cried Wally, drinking down the last of a glass of milk. “As soon as the Chief makes his announcements, we shall be in the saddle and off for the hunt!” A whistle sounded, and quiet fell on the groups. The Chief was about to speak. He rose, an imposing figure of a man, quiet, dignified, and with a voice full of calm command. He was dressed in camper’s togs, and wore the green “L” on his sweater. “All I have to say is this, fellows. We are all up here for a good time—the best time ever. Now, I want to mention a few things that will help the new camper to get along and make himself at home. Don’t expose yourselves to the sun too much until you get a coat of tan gradually; you won’t blister then. Don’t cut up or mark the trees on the campus of which we are so proud. Don’t have any firearms in your tents; none of any kind are permitted here at camp, and if you have any, bring them up to the lodge and I will look after them for you. And finally, I only need mention the rule we have about boys who smoke. Now, those are all the ‘don’t’s’ I’m going to mention. In an hour there will be a grand jubilee campfire below the baseball diamond, where I will introduce you to the councilors, who will then have something to say to you. All set for the best camp season ever! Everybody happy?” “Yay!” The resounding, united call of the campers reverberated among the lodge rafters. “Let the lions roar!” “Rao-a-ow!” A pack of well-fed lions never sent up such a tremendous roaring to the Sahara moon. “Dismissed!” Tent Four remained a little island in the swirling rush of campers that broke up after the meal. “Are you with me, gang?” shouted Wally. “Onward to the rescue of our wandering brother!” He made for the back door, pushing through the crowd like a fullback carrying the ball to victory, followed by his eager team of tent-mates. Tent Four was on the round-up. No sooner had they reached the road behind camp than the leader began giving directions, curtly and with precision. “Spread out, fellows, and we’ll cover a path on each side of the road. Keep in touch with my whistle—I’ll be in the center. Shout for Crampton at intervals, and we’ll soon have him back in the fold——What’s that?” A low moan was heard behind him, just off the road. “Help! Help!” Wally bounded off in the direction from whence it came. His muscular legs cleared the low bushes like so many hurdles. “Behind that big tree!” shouted Gallegher. The six boys dashed off after their leader, and found him staring down at a mournful figure sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall pine. It was Fat Crampton. His bulging cheeks bore the trails of tear-marks; he sat hunched amid the wreckage of his knapsack and accouterment, with the most woebegone look in the world. “I’m lost in the woods,” he moaned. “I’ve been walking around for hours!” “Why, you poor nut,” said Blackie, “if you had walked two steps further you would have tripped over the camp!” Fat transferred his doleful gaze. “Oh, Blackie, is it really you? Say, I’m scared. I heard a bunch of lions off in the woods a minute ago, and I thought they were going to get me.” “Lions, nothing!” The whole tent broke into a storm of laughter. “That was us! Rao-a-ow! Look out for us, Fat—we’re lions!” “Come on, lion-hunter,” said Wally, “come on and get a meal of raw meat. I think the chef will have saved something for you.” He lifted the rotund lad on his shoulder and set off toward the kitchen, with Fat helplessly waving his arms from his lofty perch. The rest of the boys ran with them, roaring terribly and making quips at the wanderer’s expense. Little Guppy ran beside Wally, looking up at the leader. “I’ll make up Fat’s bunk,” he offered, “if he’ll tell me where his blankets are.” “That’s the spirit! Keep it up, and you’ll make a great aide some day, Gup!” By the time the fat boy was fed, the bugle sounded Assembly for the campfire. It was now dark, and the campers found their ways down through the baseball diamond to a field above the lake shore, where a group of three or four leaders were standing beside a high pyre of logs and branches, talking to the Chief. They were Mr. Frayne, the burly assistant director whom everyone, even the smallest boys, familiarly called “Happy Face” because of the smile he always wore; “Sax” McNulty, the mournful-looking comedian and saxophone artist who had charge of the shows and stunt-nights; and Lieutenant Eames, the West Pointer. The other leaders were to be found among the crowd of boys settling around the piled fire. In the glow of somebody’s flashlight Blackie caught sight of Gil Shelton’s face in the crowd. Gil saw him, also, and shouted over: “Hi, Blackie! How’s the guardian of the Royal Official Back-Scratcher?” “Aw, forget it, Gil. Say, what are they going to do now?” “Light the fire, of course. Then I guess we’ll have a song or two, and the Chief will introduce all the leaders, and somebody will tell a story, and then we’ll burn all the little new greenhorns at the stake.” Blackie laughed as much as the joke required, and snuggled down next to Wally, in the midst of the Tent Four group. The fire was lighted, and the glow was reflected in the faces of the happy throng of campers who gathered around the first campfire of the season. The boys of Tent Four, already bound together by loyalty to their leader, were content to lie and listen to the calm voice of their Chief, as a spout of flaring sparks rose from the flames to challenge the distant glitter of the stars. CHAPTER III AFTER TAPS The musical echo of Tattoo came from the bugle, and a hush fell upon Tent Four. The campfire still smouldered in the field by the lake, but the campers had passed to their tents at the Call to Quarters, and were now making ready to turn in for the night. Blackie squatted on his bunk and stared at the faces that were half-illuminated by the solitary lantern that hung on the tent-pole. Mindful of the pine-cones that were still in Ken Haviland’s bed, he was lying low and watching for developments. The aide had already stripped, and was climbing into a swathing suit of pajamas. Above him jutted the head of Lefkowitz, already between blankets but still full of interest in proceedings. “I can’t find my nightgown,” wailed little Guppy at the other end of the tent. “It should be under your pillow,” said Wally. He stretched his broad arms and yawned prodigiously, making a noise like an enraged walrus. “You ought to have pajamas anyway.” “I put it under the pillow, sir, as Ken told me to. I had an extra one, but that’s gone too. And I promised Mother I wouldn’t sleep in my—my underthings, sir.” “Well, they’ll probably turn up. For to-night you can have an extra pair of my pajamas. I think the pants would be enough for you, though—you’re not exactly a giant.” Wally produced a pair of outing-flannel pants, stuffed the small Guppy into the legs of them, tied the cord about his neck, and stowed him away between the blankets like a sack of potatoes. Ken was turning down the covers. Blackie watched him feel the blankets all over, and to the joker’s disappointment, the aide touched several suspicious bumps and resuscitated the hidden pine-cones. He tossed them into the night, and winked at Blackie. “My camp experience has taught me to always feel my bed before I turn in,” he grinned. “Some chaps have a funny sense of humor.” He hopped in and sprawled out luxuriously. Now that his trap had failed, Blackie bethought him of turning in also. Slater, who had been outside gazing at the stars, stepped into the tent. “Lots of meteorites falling to-night, sir,” he observed. “Venus is full, too, I think; she’s especially bright in the west.” He set about his preparations for bed. Gallegher made a spring and landed in his bunk, just over Blackie’s head. A creaking from another upper bunk across the way announced that Fat Crampton had at last been able to climb to his lofty berth. “Make it fast, Blackie,” warned the leader. “You don’t want to be the last one in.” Blackie was soon arrayed in the popular evening clothes for the well-dressed camper, and looked longingly at his inviting bunk. He slipped between the warm blankets, and stretched out. Umm—this was the life! But hold on! Something had him by the leg—something else was biting him on the foot! Ouch! He yelled and rolled over the side, to come to the floor in a whirling pile of boy, blankets, and—pine-cones! Gallegher snickered above him. “The oldest trick there is!” he chuckled. “These new guys will fall for anything!” The crestfallen Blackie struggled upright, and in the dull lamplight began to make his bed anew. “That will be all the demonstrations of playfulness for to-night, gentlemen,” observed Wally, sitting on the edge of his bunk. “You are all tired, and need your sleep—I, may it be observed, need mine also. How anybody has the pep left to skylark around the first night of camp—or any other night—is beyond me. As soon as Taps sounds, Tent Four will be as still as the grave. The silence, as the book-writers always have it, will be broken only by the measured breathing of the slumbering woodsmen and the far call of a fillyloo bird across the waste. Key down, now.” He reached for his kit and drew out a book. “I’m talking seriously now. We are all up here at Lenape to have the best time ever. It’s my job as councilor to see that we do. And that’s what I want to make you fellows understand. I’ll help you in any way I can to keep you good campers and to make Lenape proud of you. If at any time you have anything on your mind, bring it to me and we’ll talk it out. Now, I’m going to read you one of the finest things that a camper ever listened to.” He opened the Bible in his hand and read by the flickering light, in a clear and sincere voice: “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath He set a tabernacle for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.” Softly and sweetly, as if from afar, came the first comforting notes of Taps, the finest of music to a tired camper. Wally doused the lantern, and the glory of the stars came into the quiet tent. “Good-night, fellows,” said Wally quietly. “Happy dreams!” Blackie lay quite still in his tumbled bed, thinking about the stars. Firmament—that was a word that meant the same as heaven, but not so nice-sounding. The stars were bright, all right. Gallegher must have put those cones into his bed, when he had been chasing bunk-stretchers—it must have been Gallegher, because he had laughed so hard when Blackie fell out. Well, so much the worse for Mr. Gallegher! He was sleeping right above Blackie, and in the morning, Mr. Gallegher would be surprised. He reached up one foot, tentatively, to see how the airplane method would work in helping Gallegher to rise. The temptation came, and he pushed upward with both feet, hard. Zoom! Gallegher flew into the air and came down to the floor with a wild yell. The experiment was a success. Tent Four was instantly alert. Lefkowitz snickered. Slater moaned dolefully. Little Guppy said, “What’s that?” Gallegher lay tumbled on the floor among his blankets. He had bruised his elbow against a locker, and it made him mean-tempered. “Damn you!” he cried. “I’ll get even——” Through the dark came the calm voice of Wally. “You seem to have been around a bunch of pretty foul-mouthed fellows, Gallegher. Gentlemen, and especially Lenape gentlemen, don’t talk that way. Chain gang for you Monday morning.” “I don’t care!” shouted Gallegher. “I’d say it again if he did that to me. If Blackie was a gentleman, he wouldn’t have given me that airplane ride. It’s his fault as much as mine. Why don’t you give him the chain gang, too?” “Blackie!” “Yes, sir.” Blackie, chuckling happily to himself at the thought of the row he had raised, sat up and leaned on one arm. “Didn’t I ask you and the other fellows to key down after Taps?” “Yes, sir.” “All right. Take your blankets and go sleep on the ground by the flagpole to-night.” “But why? I didn’t do a thing but get back at him for sticking pine-cones in my bunk!” “On your way. When you can behave decently, you can sleep with the rest of us again.” Sullenly, and making as much noise about it as he dared, Blackie put on his slippers and gathered up his pillow and blankets over his arm. The night air was cool, and he shivered slightly in his pajamas. A pine tree’s branch brushed the canvas tent-roof above his head, and somewhere off up the mountain a dog howled dismally. It didn’t look too inviting out on the darkened campus by the flagpole; but he didn’t want to appear a coward and whine to get out of going. “Good-night, you guys,” he said with bravado and stalked out of the rear of the tent. As he passed the bunk across from the leader’s, on his way out, Slater stuffed something among Blackie’s blankets with a whispered caution. “Keep it out of sight—you’ve got the chance to get to the flagpole!” Blackie nodded and went out on the path. The stars were like bright candles against a blue-green silk dome, and somehow their twinkling was not so pleasant now. He passed a line of tents, some quiet, one or two filled with low snickers and cackles and the usual disturbance of the first night under canvas. The white lodge showed pale and strange in the starlight; the campus was somehow changed from what it had been in bright day. He stumbled across to the base of the flagpole and began spreading out his bed on the hard ground. He cleared away one or two stones, and beat down the high grass as best he could, and tried to rearrange his blankets into comfortable shape. His next care was to examine the bundle that Slater had passed to him. As he had guessed, it was the missing nightgown that Guppy had bewailed at bedtime. He chuckled, thinking of the scheme that Slater had suggested. He looked around; the coast was clear. The flagpole was only a few steps away. He jumped up, unfastened the halyards, and knotting a sleeve to each end of the rope, hauled away. Then, almost too sleepy to care where he lay, he crawled into his twisted bed and was dead to the world in half a minute, smiling to think that when the morning sun rose over Camp Lenape, it would reveal that the campers had slept under a fluttering ensign that was nothing more than little Guppy’s pink nightgown. CHAPTER IV A HARD CASE Blackie was wakened somewhat rudely the next morning. A sloshing glass of cold water landed on his face, and he jumped up half-awake to find Gil Shelton standing over him in the fresh sunlight with the empty glass in his hand. “Rise and shine!” called the patrol-leader. “First Call will sound in about a minute. Gee, you must have been sawing wood not to hear the noise the gang has been making ever since four o’clock this morning! Most of the tenderfeet woke up early and have been horsing around. I couldn’t sleep, so Chink Towner and Spaghetti Megaro and I got permission to hike down to the cottage and back. Look at the big frog we found by the brook!” He held up a monstrous bullfrog by the hind legs, so close to Blackie’s face that he jumped backwards in alarm, while Gil’s two companions laughed. “Don’t let him scare you,” said Megaro, the Italian boy. “I ain’t afraid. Say, what are you going to do with him, Gil?” “Give him to Ellick—he likes to eat frog legs. Come on, here comes Fellowes with his tin horn ready to blow First Call.” Blackie picked up his bed and made his way to Tent Four. All his tent-mates were awake and laughing at little Guppy, who had just discovered that his nightgown was floating in the breeze at the top of the flagpole. The bugle’s call routed them all out to formation in front of the lodge, where after a snappy setting-up drill the entire camp flew down the slope to the boat dock for the Indian dip. The blue waters of the lake reflected a hundred white bodies standing about the edge of the dock waiting for Wally’s whistle. No sooner had it sounded than there was a tremendous plunging and splashing as most of them tumbled head-first into the crisp, bracing water. A few younger boys and timid souls waded in from the shore. “Stick your head under, Toots!” “Oh, boy! Say, ain’t this water cold?” “It ain’t cold, you dummy. Just the way I like it—wakes me up fine!” Blackie took a swift racing dive off the front end of the dock, swept cleanly through the water in a shower of small bubbles, and came to the surface with a speedy overhand stroke. He swam some fifty yards out to the life-saving boat that was stationed there with Sax McNulty at the oars and a leader named Munson at the bow, and there floated a minute. He was surprised to hear the trill of the whistle, followed by cries of “All out!” Swimming over to the dock again, he shouted in a grieved tone to Wally, who was supervising the general exodus from the water, “What’s the idea, Wally? Do you call this a swim?” “Of course not—this is just morning dip, and you’ll get a chill if you stay in long. Swim comes later.” “Aw, heck!” Somewhat disgruntled, he climbed out and raced back to the tent to dress for breakfast. The morning meal over, there was a period of duty. “We’re on police squad, you fellows!” called Ken Haviland. “Police?” asked Blackie. “What do we do—go around arresting guys?” “No, you sap. Get a blanket and I’ll show you.” Blackie discovered that policing camp merely meant going about the campus and picking up bits of paper and destroying unsightly objects that littered the paths. Church Call sounded soon after they finished, and together with the rest of the campers he went to a shady glade in the forest beside the lake and sat on a log while the short Sunday service was held. He liked sitting there in the leafy woods and singing the various tunes, even though they were the same ones they sang in Sunday-school at home; he admired the handiwork of the rustic pulpit that the campers had built the year before; but when the Chief began his talk he was frankly bored. The Chief was saying something about different trees and how they were like different kinds of boys; but Blackie only listened now and then. He was wishing that church was over and that they could go in swimming again; and he passed the time catching ants and dropping them down the neck of a smaller boy who sat in front of him. As a matter of fact the service was quite brief; but it seemed to him that it would never end. After years of waiting, or so he thought, the brisk challenge of Swim Call came from the lodge porch, and slipping into his bathing suit, he headed again for the dock. He was the first one there, with the exception of the life-saving crew, composed equally of councilors and older boys who had won the Red Cross emblem that was stitched over their breasts. Wally was in charge; he was sending out three boats to patrol the waters about the dock and posting the guards who would stand in various places about the tower to be on the watch for water accidents. When this was done, the man turned to Blackie. “First one down for swim? Say, if you’d only show as much speed doing squad-duty, the rest of the fellows wouldn’t have to do a thing!” “Can I go in now, Wally?” “You’ll have to hold yourself down until the rest get here and the whistle blows. The rule is that there’s no swimming except when the life-savers are on duty. There aren’t going to be any accidents while I’m in charge. By the way, I noticed this morning at Indian dip that you’re not a bad swimmer.” “I’m pretty good, I guess,” said Blackie modestly. “Do you know the Australian crawl? No? Well, if you want to make speed, that’s the stroke to use. The camp always holds a big boat regatta and swimming meet at the end of each section—that’s two weeks from now—and we compete with our old rivals of Camp Shawnee. I’d like to see you take a few honors and help us to beat them. What say I teach you the crawl some time?” “Now?” “To-morrow, maybe. Well, here comes the gang!” He turned away as the crowd of campers, all in swimming togs, trooped on to the dock, and at the sound of his whistle the swim began. Blackie sported about the water happily for the remainder of the period. He was quite pleased with himself for having thus been singled out by his leader for swimming ability. Tired of circling about the life-boats, he began ducking less experienced swimmers and pushing boys off the dock into the water, until he was reprimanded for this conduct by Lieutenant Eames because of the danger of someone slipping and injuring himself against one of the piles or the superstructure of the dock. This scolding made him sulky, and he swam by himself until the whistle blew, and then tardily walked up to the tent, stopping many times on the way to chase butterflies or to hunt for snakes among the rocks; and thus, when he finally reached the tent, he found his comrades working busily. All the beds were made except his own, and under the direction of Ken Haviland, the boys were sweeping and arranging, cleaning the tent lantern, putting their lockers in order, and tidying up the place. “Where have you been?” the aide greeted him. “Snap out of it and get dressed and make your bunk and get ready for inspection. Wally had to go up to leaders’ meeting at the lodge.” “Aw, don’t make such a fuss,” said Blackie. “I’ll do it, won’t I?” “Yes, but we have only a couple minutes before inspection. If the tent isn’t in apple-pie order, we don’t stand a chance to win the pennant to-day.” “Well, what if we don’t? What’s the good of having an old pennant in front of your tent? It don’t get you anything.” “But don’t you see it means that the Tent Four bunch are the best campers? When you’re here longer you’ll learn not to waste time talking back when we have a chance to show our stuff.” Without haste, Blackie peeled off his swimming suit and cast it on the floor, dressed with tantalizing slowness, and with a scowl at the aide, began to make his bed. He knew that Haviland was angry and thought it a good chance to get the tall camper’s “goat.” In the midst of his preparations the call came down the line, “All out of tents for inspection!” Haviland and the others jumped outside and lined up at attention, but Blackie delayed to try and shake his blankets into shape. Just as he stepped outside, Mr. Colby, one of the councilors and a scoutmaster known for his strictness, came along with his inspection staff. “Tent Four! Two demerits for having a camper inside the tent after inspection call. The tent seems to be in pretty good shape, but there’s a wet bathing suit in the middle of the floor, and one bunk that isn’t made. Sorry, Haviland—but this will give you so many demerits that you’ll probably get the booby prize to-day! Any excuse?” “No excuse, sir,” answered Haviland, looking daggers at the guilty Blackie. After the inspection crew had passed on, he turned to Blackie and said, “We would have had a good chance at the pennant if it hadn’t been for you! As it is, we’ll probably have the booby can tied to our tent-pole until to-morrow! What do you say, fellows—shall I recommend that Wally puts him on the chain gang?” “Put me on the gang if you want to—I don’t care!” exclaimed Blackie boldly; but he was silent all during dinner, and even fried chicken, green corn and ice-cream failed to make him forget that his careless attitude had won him the black looks of all his tent-mates. After the meal there was the usual siesta period. The boys were scattered about lying in their bunks, resting and writing letters home. Blackie crouched in his place with a pencil and pad before him. Haviland sat across from him, now and then looking gloomily up at a big tin can, painted black with the white letters BOOBY across it, which hung swinging in plain sight over the front steps. Slater was writing busily. Fat Crampton was asleep, and Gallegher was tickling the stout boy’s nose and neck with a stalk of grass, while Guppy and Lefkowitz watched the proceedings with amusement. Blackie looked down at what he had written. “Dear Mother—We got here O. K. and Camp Lenape is a fine camp. I am on the Chain Gang already and the swimming is O. K. I will learn the Ostralien crawl soon please send me up some fudge and cake. Last night I slep out-door. I think this is a fine camp o boy and don’t forget the fudge and cake and some chewing gum too.” He read this over for the fifth time, wondered what to put down next, and looked up to find Haviland watching him. “What’s biting you?” Blackie asked. “Still sore because you didn’t win your old pennant?” “It’s not myself I’m worrying about, but after dinner I heard a couple of the other leaders kidding Wally because he is always so proud of having his tent make a good showing, and to-day we were handed the merry razz.” Blackie snorted. “Say, who is this guy Wally that he should boss us around? Always blowing his whistle just when the water’s getting good!” “Yeah,” put in Gallegher, who had finally succeeded in awakening Fat Crampton. “Down our way all the guys would think he was sure a sissy, landin’ on me just because I cussed a little.” “He wouldn’t give me seconds on ice-cream, either,” said Fat Crampton mournfully. “Said I ought to start to reduce.” Ken looked at them all pityingly. “Say, don’t you know Wally is a senior at Columbia University and on the varsity water-polo and basketball teams? He’s coming up here and spending his time teaching you birds how to be good campers, and that’s all the thanks he gets!” “I guess he has a pretty good time,” said Blackie. “Of course he does, or he wouldn’t be here. But it’s no fun to have a tent full of lazy draw-backs like you that object every time he tries to make a good showing.” There was a short space of silence. Slater looked up from his writing. “Hey, Ken, do we have council ring to-night?” he asked. “Sure.” “What’s council ring?” asked Blackie curiously. Slater explained. “Just when it’s getting dark, we all put on blankets and go over to council, just like the Indians used to do. We all sit in a circle around a four-square fire, and one of the fellows lights the fire with flint and steel, or else with rubbing-sticks. Then we have report of scouts. Any fellow who has seen any interesting birds or animals or anything like that gets up and tells about them. Then we suggest anything we can do to help make the camp better and offer to do it. Then they have all kinds of contests—hand-wrestling and talk-fests and imitations, and usually end up with a ghost story. It’s real fun, all right.” Blackie remembered that Gil had pointed out the way to the council ring the evening before, and suddenly thought he would like to see the place by daylight. He put away his letter, rose, and stretched. “So long, you guys,” he said. “Where are you going?” asked the aide. “Nobody’s allowed to leave until after Recall.” “None of your business—and if you ask me, I think you’re nothing but a spy on us for this Wally of yours.” He dived into the bushes and disappeared before Haviland could follow. Not only did he want the fun of tormenting Ken, but also wishing to look over the famous council ring, he took a course through the woods that he thought would bring him out at the place he sought. It was quiet; the camp was still even for a Sunday afternoon. He pressed through the underbrush and in a short time stumbled upon a well-worn path that led in the direction he was going. Shortly he caught a glimpse of white birch railings through the leaves, and he trod softly in case there should be anyone there who might question him. His precaution proved to be wise. From a clearing ahead came the low hum of men’s voices. A circle some fifty yards across had been cleared in the woods, and seats built about it, with an imposing stone dais on the north side to furnish a proper elevation for the chieftain. Sitting on this stone were the Chief himself and Wally Rawn, chatting together. They had not seen him, and it struck Blackie that it might be a daring thing to get close enough to overhear their conference. Forgetful of the old saying that eavesdroppers seldom hear well of themselves, he wormed his way around through the bushes and found a place where he could listen without being seen. “I approve of the life-saving crew assignments you’ve made, then, Wally,” the Chief was saying. He rose as if to leave. “By the way, what do you think of the bunch I’ve put in your tent?” “They look pretty good,” answered Wally. “They ought to turn out first-rate after a couple of days. Haviland is a pretty capable kid, and Slater is bugs about stars and scouting and doesn’t give much trouble. That Crampton lad is lazy, but I hope to have him get over that when we get out on the hikes.” “You have two fellows I put in with you because they need pretty careful leadership. Know who they are?” “Think I do, Chief—Gallegher and that Blackie Thorne.” “Right. Gallegher comes from the worst part of town, and I think he may have picked up a lot of questionable habits. Thorne is a different sort. He’s lively and smart as a whip; but his father is dead and maybe he’s getting to be too much for his mother to handle alone. He’s full of mischief, his scoutmaster tells me, but he ought to turn out right. They’re a pair of hard cases, I guess; but keep them busy and they’ll soon be real Lenape fellows.” “I like hard cases,” grinned Wally. “Blackie is crazy about swimming; guess I can get him interested through that, and the old camp spirit is bound to follow. Well, let’s get back.” The two men, arm in arm, disappeared down the path. Blackie Thorne, in his hidden covert, laughed unpleasantly at their backs. “Hard case, am I?” he said to himself. “Well, Mr. Smart Wally, if you call me that, I guess all I can do is to try and live up to it!” CHAPTER V TREASURE “This chain gang ain’t so bad,” remarked Gallegher. It was after breakfast on Monday morning. He and Blackie, as well as three other culprits, were chopping wood behind the camp kitchen with the supervision and assistance of Jim Avery, a tall, gangling councilor who was a specialist in woodcraft and bird-study. Blackie split up a knotty stick of oak before replying. “Sure, this ain’t such hard work. The leader does half of it, anyway. Say, you were pretty good, to cuss right in front of Wally the other night.” “Aw, that’s nothin’. I guess I’m pretty tough, all right. I used to go down by the railroad lots of times and hook rides on the freight cars. Once I bummed clear out to Scranton and back, that way.” “Gee! No wonder the Chief said you was a hard case!” Gallegher stopped his chopping, and looked up proudly. “Did he say that?” “Yeah. I heard him talking to our noble councilor about us. He said we were both hard cases, and that Wally would have to watch us.” “Well, if that’s the way they do in this camp, I’m sure goin’ to get away with everything I can. How about it—are you with me, Thorne?” “Sure.” They split wood for a while in silence. Blackie’s back began to ache from stooping over so much. He dropped his ax and stretched. “Gosh, I’m getting sick of this job. When Jim lets us go, I’m going to head for my bunk and stay there the rest of the day.” “Say, what did you come to camp for—to be a bunk-stretcher?” asked Gallegher. “They’re goin’ to have tests for the honor emblem this mornin’—ain’t you goin’ to try for one?” “What’s the honor emblem? What good is it?” “Aw, you have to pass a lot of tests, and then they give you a badge to sew on your jersey. You’ve seen them—lots of the guys have won them.” “You mean the things with a swastika and a big L on them? What do you get for it?” “Say, don’t be dumb all your life! If a guy has an honor emblem he can join the Bugs Society and have an initiation and a feed, and then he can get away with lots of things, just because he’s got a badge, see? It’s somethin’ like the Knights of Columbus.” “Oh. What did you say you have to do to get one?” “A bunch of things, like knowin’ the names of the parts of a boat and bein’ good at hikin’ and swimmin’ and athaletics——” “That’s me. I can do all those things.” “—And collect flowers and tree leaves and rocks, and know the names of the stars, and box the compass, and cook a meal, and build cabins and do stunts—a whole lot of stuff. We can do it easy.” Blackie considered this, and after his work was done he joined a nature hike. During the hour before swim, he learned much that he had not previously known about geology and ferns, and collected the ten leaves he must identify as one of the qualifications toward his honor emblem. Since overhearing Wally and the Chief in the council ring, his attitude toward his leader had changed. He now thought of Wally as an irksome guardian and taskmaster, and found excuses for himself to disagree with every suggestion the councilor made. Nevertheless, he remembered Wally’s promise of the previous day, and after all the other campers had come out of the water after swim, he touched Wally on the arm and reminded him that he was to be taught the Australian crawl. The life-saving crew now had its brief moment of fun. They were having a game of water-tag about the boats and up the diving-tower. Blackie thought it great sport to be with them, and under Wally’s direction to seem one of the outfit that was so much at home in deep water. He kept one eye on their antics and with the other watched Wally Rawn demonstrate the approved method of breathing with the crawl stroke that sent him plowing through the sunlit water at a speedy rate. Then it came Blackie’s turn to show what he had learned, while Wally stood on the dock and shouted directions. “That’s right—take a breath every fourth stroke, and let it out under water! Don’t use that frog kick—use the trudgeon! Keep your fingers together! That’s the way.” At first Blackie found it hard to get the correct timing for his breaths, but after some twenty minutes Wally called a halt and put an end to the lesson for the day, pronouncing himself well satisfied with the boy’s progress. “If we keep on like this, you ought to win a couple first places in the Shawnee meet, Blackie. I’ll give you some diving instruction later on—I think I’ll give all the fellows in the tent a chance to learn a few jack-knives and swan dives.” “What do we get if we win?” asked Blackie. “Award ribbons, and lots of glory for Lenape. What more do you want? You’re pretty young yet, kid—but I hope it won’t be long before you find out that the biggest rewards in life are the ones you don’t get paid for. Money or silver cups or ice-cream don’t begin to compare with the ownership of an alert mind, a strong, clean, healthy body, fine friendships, and a reputation for honor and manliness and courage. Do you know there’s a treasure buried here on the Lenape campus?” Blackie was aglow on the instant. “Where? Do you know where to dig for it? Is it a pirate treasure? Let me help you hunt for it, Wally!” The man smiled. “There you go again—always on the lookout for a selfish, personal gain! The treasure I mean isn’t made of Spanish doubloons and stolen jewels; but it’s here, waiting for every boy to find it for himself. If you’ve got the right stuff in you, Blackie, and I think you have, you can take that treasure home with you when you leave camp. It’s a treasure you wouldn’t want to trade for anything else in the world—the treasure of a true Lenape spirit.” Blackie’s visions of delving in the dead of night for a glittering hoard in a pirate chest vanished. Somewhat downcast, he muttered, “Aw, don’t preach! Just the same, I sure would like to take home a bunch of money that I found up here.” “Well, stranger things have happened. Guess your mother would be proud if you did.” “Sure! It would help a lot; we don’t have much money since Dad left us. You see, she runs a little store and sells sewing things and fancy embroidery and stuff like that.” Wally nodded. “Did you ever stop to think how much she is sacrificing to give you a good time camping up here in the woods?” “I guess so,” said Blackie uncomfortably. “Let’s go. We don’t want to be late to-day—we don’t want to get the booby prize for inspection twice in a row.” “That’s the spirit!” CHAPTER VI THE HERMIT’S HOUSE That night after supper, when the whistle had shrilled for silence, Happy Face Frayne, who was officer of the day, made announcement of the evening’s program. “We still have lots of daylight left after supper, so we have planned a few short hikes before dark. Then, after that, we’ll gather here in the lodge around the fire and have some songs and stories.” “Hurray!” “Mr. Munson will take a group up the mountain road to the Devil’s Potato Patch. Mr. Colby will head a boating expedition to the dam at the end of the lake, while those who want to visit Rattlesnake Joe, the hermit, will report to Dr. Cannon. Those who stay in camp can have a rousing game of volley ball—Long Jim Avery and Lieutenant Eames will choose sides.” “Hurray!” “Dismissed!” “Where you going, you crazy Irishman?” Blackie asked his bosom friend Gallegher when they were outside. “Me? I’m goin’ to start out with the bunch up the mountain, and then lose myself. You want to come?” He winked significantly. “What are you going to do?” “You’ll see, if you come with me. We’ll get away from these babies and have a good time of our own.” “All right. Hi, Gil!” shouted Blackie, as his patrol-leader passed by. “Where you heading?” “Up the lake. Say, you remember when we hiked the short way to camp the first night we came up? You remember that house you asked me about? Well, now’s your chance to see it closer. That’s where the hermit lives, and he’s a queer old bird if there ever was one.” At Gil’s words the picture of that secret, sinister house on the mountainside, as Blackie had first glimpsed it, came back to him. “That’s right—thanks for reminding me. I’m sorry, Irish—I’ll sneak off with you some other time.” He slipped away and joined the group around Dr. Cannon, the camp medico, at the lodge steps. There were some fifteen or twenty campers who clamored about the short, sturdy figure of the doctor, deluging him with questions about their destination. “The old hermit, Rattlesnake Joe, is one of the sights of this part of the country,” he said, quieting them with a gesture. “I don’t need to tell you anything more—you’ll see him for yourselves soon enough. Keep together—forward, march!” The boys straggled behind him as he led the way around behind the kitchen and the ice-house and on past the Red Cross tent to the road. Blackie marched in company with the Utway twins and a shock-haired “two-striper” nicknamed “Sunfish” because he had once fallen out of a canoe and when he was pulled up on the dock, it was discovered that he had unwittingly trapped a good-sized sunfish in one of the pockets of his sweater. The hikers turned off to the right where the road turned up the mountain, and headed down a marshy lane bounded with a stone fence on each side. The small, stinging deer-flies swarmed about their heads, and Jerry Utway, one of the twins, showed Blackie how to fasten a handkerchief around his head so that it would flutter and keep the bothersome insects at a distance. “See that tree?” asked the Sunfish. Blackie nodded. “Well, that’s a black birch tree—the kind they make birch beer from. Some time I’ll show you how to tap it and get a drink of the sap—it tastes great. Here, take this twig and chew on it. Doesn’t it taste something like sassafras?” “Come on—we’ll be back with Elephant Crampton in a minute,” urged Jake, the other of the twins. “Hurry up if you kids want to see the old hermit before dark.” They increased their pace, and caught up with the vanguard about Dr. Cannon just as the mysterious house came into sight at the end of the lane. Surrounded by the shouting company of the campers, Blackie was not so awed by the place as he had been when, alone with Gil, he had glimpsed it from afar on his first memorable evening in camp. There were the same weathered shingles on the low roof, the same dirty windows and decaying out-houses—but it did not seem so unreal and awful now. On their approach they were announced by the furious baying and howling of half a dozen hounds that leaped and pulled at their chains beside a rickety kennel by the door. The campers drew back, hoping with all their hearts that none of the dogs would break loose. The door was flung open, and a tall old man stamped out and began quieting the hounds, beating their heads with a stick until they subsided, whimpering. Then he turned and gazed strangely at the group of boys, shading his eyes against the slanting rays of sunset. “Wal, now,” he said after a minute, “if it ain’t the Doctor and the camp-ground boys. How be ye, Doc?” He extended a dirty and claw-like hand. Blackie was near enough to notice that the finger-nails were all about half an inch long, broken, ragged, and encrusted with mold. Indeed, as Blackie watched him shake hands with Dr. Cannon and step back to lounge in the doorway, he seemed a far from attractive personality. He was probably sixty years old, with a tall, stoop-shouldered body. He leaned slouchily against the rough doorpost, and the blackened fingers of one hand nervously combed a ragged and greasy beard that was streaked with gray. The same tangled gray prevailed in the straggling hair that crawled from beneath his battered felt hat, and in the discouraged mustache that drooped to mingle with the beard. The hermit’s eyes were bleared by sitting beside a smoky fire, and were overhung by bushy brows. Now and then, as he talked, he would profanely quiet the hounds at his feet, who, it must be admitted, were far more intelligent and far cleaner than their master. “Glad ye’ve come, boys,” he drawled. “Allus glad to see boys here. Glad to see anybody. I been livin’ all alone here five year now come fall, sence my boy Jase left me to go over and cut ties in Pike County. Good boy, Jase was, but him and me couldn’t get along right well together. Say, Doc, when ye get back to camp-ground ye kin give Ellick and the Chief my regards fer sendin’ up that sack of flour last week. Shore did enj’y it.” “We thought you might,” said the doctor. “These boys wanted to take a little hike to-night, and I brought them up to call on you.” “Thet’s fine—allus glad to see boys. Well, boys, guess ye want to see my old thunderbolt, don’t ye? I allus show all the boys that thunderbolt——” He entered his house and with a long knife pried up a flat flagstone, one of those forming the hearth before his fireplace. Blackie saw him kneeling in a shaft of sunlight beside the cold embers, and watched until he drew forth from its hiding-place what seemed to be a long, thin, slate-colored piece of stone or iron. The hermit brought it out and passed it around for all to see. It was pitted and twisted, like a short iron bar that had been exposed to rough use and rust for years. “Thet’s my thunderbolt,” the hermit explained. “Ten year ago come August we had a whackin’ big storm—black clouds piled high over the hills here till it looked like midnight. All of a sudden, bang! comes a big blast of lightnin’, and hit thet old oak tree out thar—it was a big tree then, but it’s only a stump now. After the storm was all over I come out thar and saw this stuck right in the middle of the tree—had to cut it out with my old ax. Look at it close, young fellers—ye don’t get a chance to see a reg’lar thunderbolt every day.” The boys hurriedly passed the famous object from hand to hand, for it was suddenly growing dark and the doctor had announced that it was time to leave. Blackie was not at all regretful to leave the neighborhood of that ruined house, which became more unfriendly as the long shadows of the pines barred and striped its mouldering walls. “How long has he lived here?” he asked Dr. Cannon as they hiked on the return journey at a rapid pace. “All his life, I guess,” was the reply. “He makes a poor living, cutting railroad ties and raising a few pigs and chickens—just enough to scrape along on. It just shows you what a life of ignorance and dirt can do to a man.” “Was that a true story about his thunderbolt?” “There aren’t really any bolts thrown down during a thunderstorm. That thing he had may be what is called a belemnite, or maybe just a piece of meteoric iron he found, and made up the story about it afterward.” On the return trip Jerry Utway discovered a patch of gooseberries. He and his brother and Blackie and Sunfish clustered about and found a few berries that had ripened. “Well, Blackie,” said Sunfish, talking with his mouth full, “guess you won’t feel so lively to-morrow night.” “Why? What’s going to happen?” “Stuck-Ups.” “What’s that?” The two-striper put his thumbs in his ears and waggled his fingers mysteriously. “You’ll see,” he said meaningly. “They initiate all the new campers then. Big secret society; everybody tries to join, but they don’t always stand the tortures.” “Do they have real good tortures at this camp?” asked Jake. “We joined up at Camp Coutrell last year, so we don’t have to get initiated here. Oh, boy! We were black and blue for a week afterwards!” “What do they do to a guy?” asked Blackie. “You’ll find out. The Grand Mogul makes the neophytes—the new guys—do all sorts of things and go through all kinds of tortures.” “I won’t do it,” announced Blackie, with a sudden sinking of the heart. “Oh, you’ll have to, if you want to be one of the society. After you get in, it’s lots of fun helping to initiate the ones that join after you do. And some day, maybe you can work up to be one of the officers, like the Exalted Overseers of the Rabble or the Supreme Potent Inquisitors or the Sublunary Administers of the Last Rites.” “That sounds fine, but I don’t want to be black and blue for a week. Can’t you get in without being tortured?” “Oh, no!” said Sunfish. “A guy has to go through perils and trials before he ever amounts to anything in the world. Come on—we’ll be the last ones in camp as it is.” The four hastened after that. A few hundred yards from camp they came upon Fat Crampton, weary but still determined, and cheered him with the news that the tents were not far away. Through the trees was borne the rollicking chorus of the singers gathered about the fireplace in the lodge, united in good fellowship and roaring out the lilting words of the Lenape marching song: “Oh, I’ve travelled the world from shore to shore And sailed on every sea, But there ain’t no spot in the whole darned lot Like old Camp Le-na-pe!” CHAPTER VII INITIATION The coming initiation ceremony of the Stuck-Up Society was the chief subject of conversation during Tuesday. Many were the direful hints and bloodthirsty tales that the new campers heard from the lips of seasoned Lenape boys, who, of course, were all members of the society and who were all occupied in getting out their regalia and ceremonial weapons in preparation for the big night. Immediately after the supper dishes were washed, the lodge was cleared of all except the dozen members of the society who had been chosen to arrange the mess-hall as the Throne Room. Blackie, sitting on the steps in front of his tent, could hear a prodigious thumping and running and hurly-burly inside the lodge, but could see nothing, because blankets had been hung over all the windows and the door was guarded. He was gravely watching Slater, who had been initiated the year before. The red-headed boy was putting the finishing touches on a war-club he had just made, meanwhile whistling the Funeral March in a dolorous key. “How’s that?” he asked, whirling the formidable club by its thong. “When you’re a member, you can bear one of these at initiations too.” “Say, how do you make one of those clubs?” asked Blackie. “First you find a nice little white birch tree. You dig it up and cut it off about two feet above the roots; then you peel it around the base and sharpen the roots. Then you can cut your mark and decorations and designs on the bark, like this. If you soak it in water soon after it’s cut, it gives it this nice, red, bloody color.” “All loyal Stuck-Ups come to the Throne Room!” came a call through the megaphone on the lodge porch. “So long,” said Slater. “I’ve got to go up now. I’ll see you later. Take my advice and don’t get fresh with the Grand Mogul, or it’ll be all the worse for you.” He departed, swinging his club with gusto. Blackie left to join the group of new campers who were gathered under the big black-cherry tree by the baseball field to await the summons to their doom. There were about forty of them; among them he found many he knew, mostly boys who had never spent a season at Lenape. Lefkowitz, Guppy, Fat Crampton, and Gallegher were those from Tent Four who, beside himself, were to prepare to undergo the awful ordeal. They sat about nervously on the stone fence, trying to reassure themselves by bold talk and a great deal of forced laughter. “Here they come!” shouted one boy after a while, and instantly there was silence. All eyes were turned to watch the approach of the Outer Guard, which consisted of four older boys marching toward them in formation. Each one of them wore nothing but a towel caught about his hips and knotted on the side, and fantastic peaked hats some three feet high that had been made by wetting an ordinary felt hat and pulling it over the end of a baseball bat until the crown had stretched to a high point. The faces and bodies of the Guard were barbarically daubed and streaked with colored grease-paint, and each bore over his shoulder a broad-bladed canoe paddle. They solemnly halted beside the secretly trembling neophytes, and “Kipper” Dabney, who was in charge, spoke in hollow tones: “Line up by the alphabet—those with names beginning with A are in front. You are all about to undergo the dread inquisition of the Omnipotent Stuck-Up Society. Meditate upon your benighted souls, and ponder how best you can serve the spirit of Lenape!” He counted off the first four boys in the line, and marched them away to the lodge porch. Blackie saw Dabney give a secret knock and a password; the portals of the Throne Room unclosed; there was a flourish of trumpets, and then an ominous silence that lasted until the Outer Guard again came to take four more aspirants to the great hall of the society. Four by four, Blackie Thorne saw his fellows vanish into the echoing Throne Room. He was almost at the end of the line, and did not know whether to be pleased or sorry that he would be one of the last to be initiated; but Fat Crampton went with the second bunch, and both Guppy and Gallegher with the fourth. Blackie was surprised to see the latter, about twenty minutes after he had entered, ejected somewhat roughly through the door and escorted down the steps by two stalwart guards. “What’s the matter?” he called. “What did they do to you, Irish?” “Aw, they booted me out of their old society!” mumbled Gallegher. “They let that little squirt Guppy stay in, though. Guess I didn’t bow down and lick their boots enough to suit ’em.” “Key down, you!” ordered one of the guards. “You have been told to go to your tent. You, Thorne, get back in line and wait your turn.” Blackie returned to his place, wondering at this new development. Gallegher had failed to pass the trials for some reason; evidently the Stuck-Ups did not accept everybody. But he figured that he was at least as clever as Nightshirt Guppy and could stand any test they might put to him. At last there were only three neophytes left under the cherry-tree—Blackie, a younger boy named “Peanut” Westover, and Slim Yerkes. Peanut had grown more and more timid as the minutes passed, and at last ventured to address the others in quavering tones. “Do—do you think they’re going to hurt us much?” “Maybe,” said Blackie. “Who cares if they do?” “I sneaked my pillow out here with me,” confessed the boy, “and stuffed it in the seat of my trousers. Some of the kids said they paddle you something awful.” “Well, we’re in for it now,” said Yerkes, pointing. “Here come the guards for us.” The three neophytes were surrounded by the serious-faced paddle-bearers and marched up the steps to the porch. Blackie assumed a careless expression to conceal his inward misgivings, and whistled with as much bravado as he could muster. Knock! Knock! Knock! Kipper Dabney whispered a password through the keyhole, the door swung open, and they were marched inside. Two boys with sashes about their waists, whom Blackie recognized as Ted Fellowes and his younger brother, put pennant-hung bugles to their lips and blew a clarion call that set the rafters ringing. The huge room was dark except for a space in front of the empty fireplace, where a row of lanterns the first to experiment along the lines which led to wireless telegraphy, or the first to signal for short distances without wires. He is prompt with his acknowledgment to other workers in his field, and to his assistants. Professor S. F. B. Morse, the inventor of telegraphy; Dr. Oliver Lodge and Sir William Preece, of England; Edison, Tesla, and Professors Trowbridge and Dolbear, of America, and others had experimented along these lines, but it remained for Marconi to perfect a system and put it into practical working order. He took the coherer of Branley and Calzecchi, the oscillator of Righi, he used the discoveries of Henry and Hertz, but his creation, like that of the poet who gathers the words of men in a perfect lyric, was none the less brilliant and original. [Illustration: _MARCONI TRANSATLANTIC STATION AT SOUTH WELLFLEET, CAPE COD, MASS._] In its bare outlines, Marconi's system of telegraphy consists in setting in motion, by means of his transmitter, certain electric waves which, passing through the ether, are received on a distant wire suspended from a kite or mast, and registered on his receiving apparatus. The ether is a mysterious, unseen, colourless, odourless, inconceivably rarefied something which is supposed to fill all space. It has been compared to a jelly in which the stars and planets are set like cherries. About all we know of it is that it has waves--that the jelly may be made to vibrate in various ways. Etheric vibrations of certain kinds give light; other kinds give heat; others electricity. Experiments have shown that if the ether vibrates at the inconceivable swiftness of 400 billions of waves a second we see the colour red, if twice as fast we see violet, if more slowly--perhaps 230 millions to the second, and less--we have the Hertz waves used by Marconi in his wireless-telegraphy experiments. Ether waves should not be confounded with air waves. Sound is a result of the vibration of the air; if we had ether and no air, we should still see light, feel heat, and have electrical phenomena, but no sound would ever come to our ears. Air is sluggish beside ether, and sound waves are very slow compared with ether waves. During a storm the ether brings the flash of the lightning before the air brings the sound of thunder, as every one knows. [Illustration: AT POOLE, _ENGLAND_.] Electricity is, indeed, only another name for certain vibrations in the ether. We say that electricity "flows" in a wire, but nothing really passes except an etheric wave, for the atoms composing the wire, as well as the air and the earth, and even the hardest substances, are all afloat in ether. Vibrations, therefore, started at one end of the wire travel to the other. Throw a stone into a quiet pond. Instantly waves are formed which spread out in every direction; the water does not move, except up and down, yet the wave passes onward indefinitely. Electric waves cannot be seen, but electricians have learned how to incite them, to a certain extent how to control them, and have devised cunning instruments which register their presence. Electrical waves have long been harnessed by the use of wires for sending communications; in other words, we have had wire telegraphy. But the ether exists outside of the wire as well as within; therefore, having the ether everywhere, it must be possible to produce waves in it which will pass anywhere, as well through mountains as over seas, and if these waves can be controlled they will evidently convey messages as easily and as certainly as the ether within wires. So argued Mr. Marconi. The difficulty lay in making an instrument which would produce a peculiar kind of wave, and in receiving and registering this wave in a second apparatus located at a distance from the first. It was, therefore, a practical mechanical problem which Marconi had to meet. Beginning with crude tin boxes set up on poles on the grounds of his father's estate in Italy, he finally devised an apparatus from which a current generated by a battery and passing in brilliant sparks between two brass balls was radiated from a wire suspended on a tall pole. By shutting off and turning on this peculiar current, by means of a device similar to the familiar telegrapher's key, the waves could be so divided as to represent dashes and dots, and spell out letters in the Morse alphabet. This was the transmitter. It was, indeed, simple enough to start these waves travelling through space, to jar the etheric jelly, so to speak; but it was far more difficult to devise an apparatus to receive and register them. For this purpose Marconi adopted a device invented by an Italian, Calzecchi, and improved by a Frenchman, M. Branley, called the coherer, and the very crux of the system, without which there could be no wireless telegraphy. This coherer, which he greatly improved, is merely a little tube of glass as big around as a lead-pencil, and perhaps two inches long. It is plugged at each end with silver, the plugs nearly meeting within the tube. The narrow space between them is filled with finely powdered fragments of nickel and silver, which possess the strange property of being alternately very good and very bad conductors of electrical waves. The waves which come from the transmitter, perhaps 2,000 miles away, are received on a suspended kite-wire, exactly similar to the wire used in the transmitter, but they are so weak that they could not of themselves operate an ordinary telegraph instrument. They do, however, possess strength enough to draw the little particles of silver and nickel in the coherer together in a continuous metal path. In other words, they make these particles "cohere," and the moment they cohere they become a good conductor for electricity, and a current from a battery near at hand rushes through, operates the Morse instrument, and causes it to print a dot or a dash; then a little tapper, actuated by the same current, strikes against the coherer, the particles of metal are jarred apart or "decohered," becoming instantly a poor conductor, and thus stopping the strong current from the home battery. Another wave comes through space, down the suspended kite-wire, into the coherer, there drawing the particles again together, and another dot or dash is printed. All these processes are continued rapidly, until a complete message is ticked out on the tape. Thus Mr. Kemp knew when he heard the tapper strike the coherer that a signal was coming, though he could not hear the click of the receiver itself. And this is in bare outline Mr. Marconi's invention--this is the combination of devices which has made wireless telegraphy possible, the invention on which he has taken out more than 132 patents in every civilised country of the world. Of course his instruments contain much of intricate detail, of marvellously ingenious adaptation to the needs of the work, but these are interesting chiefly to expert technicians. [Illustration: NEARER VIEW OF _SOUTH FORELAND STATION_.] [Illustration: ALUM BAY STATION _ISLE OF WIGHT_.] In his actual transoceanic experiments of December, 1901, Mr. Marconi's transmitting station in England was fitted with twenty masts 210 feet high, each with its suspended wire, though not all of them were used. A current of electricity sufficient to operate some 300 incandescent lamps was used, the resulting spark being so brilliant that one could not have looked at it with the unshaded eye. The wave which was thus generated had a length of about a fifth of a mile, and the rate of vibration was about 800,000 to the second. Following the analogy of the stone cast in the pond with the ripples circling outward, these waves spread from the suspended wires in England in every direction, not only westward toward the cliff where Marconi was flying his kite, but eastward, northward, and southward, so that if some of Mr. Marconi's assistants had been flying kites, say on the shore of Africa, or South America, or in St. Petersburg, they might possibly, with a corresponding receiver, have heard the identical signals at the same instant. In his early experiments Marconi believed that great distances could not be obtained without very high masts and long, suspended wires, the greater the distance the taller the mast, on the theory that the waves were hindered by the curvature of the earth; but his later theory, substantiated by his Newfoundland experiments, is that the waves somehow follow around the earth, conforming to its curve, and the next station he establishes in America will not be set high on a cliff, as at St. John's, but down close to the water on level land. His Newfoundland experiments have also convinced him that one of the secrets of successful long-distance transmission is the use of a more powerful current in his transmitter, and this he will test in his next trials between the continents. And now we come to the most important part of Mr. Marconi's work, the part least known even to science, and the field of almost illimitable future development. This is the system of "tuning," as the inventor calls it, the construction of a certain receiver so that it will respond only to the message sent by a certain transmitter. When Marconi's discoveries were first announced in 1896, there existed no method of tuning, though the inventor had its necessity clearly in mind. Accordingly the public inquired, "How are you going to keep your messages secret? Supposing a warship wishes to communicate with another of the fleet, what is to prevent the enemy from reading your message? How are private business despatches to be secured against publicity?" Here, indeed, was a problem. Without secrecy no system of wireless telegraphy could ever reach great commercial importance, or compete with the present cable communication. The inventor first tried using a parabolic copper reflector, by means of which he could radiate the electric waves exactly as light--which, it will be borne in mind, is only another kind of etheric wave--is reflected by a mirror. This reflector could be faced in any desired direction, and only a receiver located in that direction would respond to the message. But there were grave objections to the reflector; an enemy might still creep in between the sending and receiving stations, and, moreover, it was found that the curvature of the earth interfered with the transmission of reflected messages, thereby limiting their usefulness to short distances. [Illustration: MARCONI ROOM _SS PHILADELPHIA_.] In passing, however, it may be interesting to note one extraordinary use for this reflecting system which the inventor now has in mind. This is in connection with lighthouse work. Ships are to be provided with reflecting instruments which in dense fog or storms can be used exactly as a searchlight is now employed on a dark night to discover the location of the lighthouses or lightships. For instance, the lighthouse, say, on some rocky point on the New England coast would continually radiate a warning from its suspended wire. These waves pass as readily through fog and darkness and storm as in daylight. A ship out at sea, hidden in fog, has lost its bearings; the sound of the warning horn, if warning there is, seems to come first from one direction, then from another, as sounds do in a fog, luring the ship to destruction. If now the mariner is provided with a wireless reflector, this instrument can be slowly turned until it receives the lighthouse warning, the captain thus learning his exact location; if in distress, he can even communicate with the lighthouse. Think also what an advantage such an equipment would be to vessels entering a dangerous harbour in thick weather. This is one of the developments of the near future. The reflector system being impracticable for long-distance work, Mr. Marconi experimented with tuning. He so constructed a receiver that it responds only to a certain transmitter. That is, if the transmitter is radiating 800,000 vibrations a second, the corresponding receiver will take only 800,000 vibrations. In exactly the same way a familiar tuning fork will respond only to another tuning fork having exactly the same "tune," or number of vibrations per second. And Mr. Marconi has now succeeded in bringing this tuning system to some degree of perfection, though very much work yet remains to be done. For instance, in one of his English experiments, at Poole in England, he had two receivers connected with the same wire, and tuned to different transmitters located at St. Catherine's Point. Two messages were sent, one in English and one in French. Both were received at the same time on the same wire at Poole, but one receiver rolled off its message in English, the other in French, without the least interference. And so when critics suggested that the inventor may have been deceived at St. John's by messages transmitted from ocean liners, he was able to respond promptly: "Impossible. My instrument was tuned to receive only from my station in Cornwall." Indeed, the only wireless-telegraph apparatus that could possibly have been within hundreds of miles of Newfoundland would be one of the Marconi-fitted steamers, and the "call" of a steamer is not the letter "S," but "U." The importance of the new system of tuning can hardly be overestimated. By it all the ships of a fleet can be provided with instruments tuned alike, so that they may communicate freely with one another, and have no fear that the enemy will read the messages. The spy of the future must be an electrical expert who can slip in somehow and steal the secret of the enemy's tunes. Great telegraph companies will each have its own tuned instruments, to receive only its own messages, and there may be special tunes for each of the important governments of the world. Or perhaps (for the system can be operated very cheaply) the time will even come when the great banking and business houses, or even families and friends, will each have its own wireless system, with its own secret tune. Having variations of millions of different vibrations, there will be no lack of tunes. For instance, the British navy may be tuned to receive only messages of 700,000 vibrations to the second, the German navy 1,500,000, the United States Government 1,000,000, and so on indefinitely. [Illustration: _TRANSATLANTIC HIGH POWER MARCONI STATION AT GLACE BAY, NOVA SCOTIA_] Tuning also makes multiplex wireless telegraphy a possibility; that is, many messages may be sent or received on the same suspended wire. Supposing, for instance, the operator was sending a hurry press despatch to a newspaper. He has two transmitters, tuned differently, connected with his wire. He cuts the despatch in two, sends the first half on one transmitter, and the second on the other, thereby reducing by half the time of transmission. A sort of impression prevails that wireless telegraphy is still largely in the uncertain experimental stage; but, as a matter of fact, it has long since passed from the laboratory to a wide commercial use. Its development since Mr. Marconi's first paper was read, in 1896, and especially since the first message was sent from England to France across the Channel in March, 1899, has been astonishingly rapid. Most of the ships of the great navies of Europe and all the important ocean liners are now fitted with the "wireless" instruments. The system has been recently adopted by the Lloyds of England, the greatest of shipping exchanges. It is being used on many lightships, and the New York _Herald_ receives daily reports from vessels at sea, communicated from a ship station off Nantucket. Were there space to be spared, many incidents might be told showing in what curious and wonderful ways the use of the "wireless" instruments has saved life and property, to say nothing of facilitating business. And it cannot now be long before a regular telegraph business will be conducted between Massachusetts and England, through the new stations. Mr. Marconi informed me that he would be able to build and equip stations on both sides of the Atlantic for less than $150,000, the subsequent charge for maintenance being very small. A cable across the Atlantic costs between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000, and it is a constant source of expenditure for repairs. The inventor will be able to transmit with single instruments about twenty words a minute, and at a cost ridiculously small compared with the present cable tolls. He said in a speech delivered at a dinner given him by the Governor at St. John's that messages which now go by cable at twenty-five cents a word might be sent profitably at a cent a word or less, which is even much cheaper than the very cheapest present rates in America for messages by land wires. It is estimated that about $400,000,000 is invested in cable systems in various parts of the world. If Marconi succeeds as he hopes to succeed, much of the vast network of wires at the bottom of the world's oceans, represented by this investment, will lose its usefulness. It is now the inventor's purpose to push the work of installation between the continents as rapidly as possible, and no one need be surprised if the year 1902 sees his system in practical operation. Along with this transatlantic work he intends to extend his system of transmission between ships at sea and the ports on land, with a view to enabling the shore stations to maintain constant communication with vessels all the way across the Atlantic. If he succeeds in doing this, there will at last be no escape for the weary from the daily news of the world, so long one of the advantages of an ocean voyage. For every morning each ship, though in mid-ocean, will get its bulletin of news, the ship's printing-press will strike it off, and it will be served hot with the coffee. Yet think what such a system will mean to ships in distress, and how often it will relieve the anxiety of friends awaiting the delayed voyager. Mr. Marconi's faith in his invention is boundless. He told me that one of the projects which he hoped soon to attempt was to communicate between England and New Zealand. If the electric waves follow the curvature of the earth, as the Newfoundland experiments indicate, he sees no reason why he should not send signals 6,000 or 10,000 miles as easily as 2,000. Then there is the whole question of the use of wireless telegraphy on land, a subject hardly studied, though messages have already been sent upward of sixty miles overland. The new system will certainly prove an important adjunct on land in war-time, for it will enable generals to signal, as they have done in South Africa, over comparatively long distances in fog and storm, and over stretches where it might be impossible for the telegraph corps to string wires or for couriers to pass on account of the presence of the enemy. [Illustration: Work on the Smith Point Lighthouse Stopped by a Violent Storm. _Just after the cylinder had been set in place, and while the workmen were hurrying to stow sufficient ballast to secure it against a heavy sea, a storm forced the attending steamer to draw away. One of the barges was almost overturned, and a lifeboat was driven against the cylinder and crushed to pieces._] CHAPTER VIII SEA-BUILDERS _The Story of Lighthouse Building--Stone-tower Lighthouses, Iron Pile Lighthouses, and Steel Cylinder Lighthouses_ A sturdy English oak furnished the model for the first of the great modern lighthouses. A little more than one hundred and forty years ago John Smeaton, maker of odd and intricate philosophical instruments and dabbler in mechanical engineering, was called upon to place a light upon the bold and dangerous reefs of Eddystone, near Plymouth, England. John Smeaton never had built a lighthouse; but he was a man of great ingenuity and courage, and he knew the kind of lighthouse _not_ to build; for twice before the rocks of Eddystone had been marked, and twice the mighty waves of the Atlantic had bowled over the work of the builders as easily as they would have overturned a skiff. Winstanley, he of song and story, designed the first of these structures, and he and all his keepers lost their lives when the light went down; the other, the work of John Rudyerd, was burned to the water's edge, and one of the keepers, strangely enough, died from the effects of melting lead which fell from the roof and entered his open mouth as he gazed upward. Both of these lighthouses were of wood, and both were ornamented with balconies and bay-windows, which furnished ready holds for the rough handling of the wind. [Illustration: Robert Stevenson, Builder of the Famous Bell Rock Lighthouse, and Author of Important Inventions and Improvements in the System of Sea Lighting. _From a bust by Joseph, now in the library of Bell Rock Lighthouse._] [Illustration: The Bell Rock Lighthouse, on the Eastern Coast of Scotland. _From the painting by Turner. The Bell Rock Lighthouse was built by Robert Stevenson, grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson, on the Inchcape Reef, in the North Sea, near Dundee, Scotland, in 1807-1810._] John Smeaton walked in the woods and thought of all these problems. He tells quaintly in his memoirs how he observed the strength with which an oak-tree bore its great weight of leaves and branches; and when he built his lighthouse, it was wide and flaring at the base, like the oak, and deeply rooted into the sea-rock with wedges of wood and iron. The waist was tapering and cylindrical, bearing the weight of the keeper's quarters and the lantern as firmly and jauntily as the oak bears its branches. Moreover, he built of stone, to avoid the possibility of fire, and he dovetailed each stone into its neighbour, so that the whole tower would face the wind and the waves as if it were one solid mass of granite. For years Smeaton's Eddystone blinked a friendly warning to English mariners, serving its purpose perfectly, until the Brothers of Trinity saw fit to build a larger tower in its place. In England the famous lighthouses of Bell Rock, built by Robert Stevenson, Skerryvore, and Wolf Rock are all stone towers; and in our own country, Minot's Ledge, off Boston Harbour, more difficult of construction than any of them, Spectacle Reef light in Lake Huron, and Stannard Rock light in Lake Superior are good examples of Smeaton's method of building. [Illustration: The Present Lighthouse on Minot's Ledge, near the Entrance of Massachusetts Bay, Fifteen Miles Southeast of Boston. "_Rising sheer out of the sea, like a huge stone cannon, mouth upward._"--Longfellow.] The mighty stone tower still remains for many purposes the most effective method of lighting the pathways of the sea, but it is both exceedingly difficult to build, and it is very expensive. Within comparatively recent years busy inventors have thought out several new plans for lighthouses, which are quite as wonderful and important in their way as wireless telegraphy and the telephone are in the realm of electricity. [Illustration: The Lighthouse on Stannard Rock, Lake Superior. _This is a stone-tower lighthouse, similar in construction to the one built with such difficulty on Spectacle Reef, Lake Huron._] One of these inventions is the iron-pile or screw-pile lighthouse, and the other is the iron cylinder lighthouse. I will tell the story of each of them separately. The skeleton-built iron-pile lighthouse bears much the same relation to the heavy stone tower lighthouse that a willow twig bears to a great oak. The latter meets the fury of wind and wave with stern resistance, opposing force to force; the former conquers its difficulties by avoiding them. A completed screw-pile lighthouse has the odd appearance of a huge, ugly spider standing knee-deep in the sea. Its squat body is the home of the keeper, with a single bright eye of light at the top, and its long spindly legs are the iron piles on which the structure rests. Thirty years ago lighthouse builders were much pleased with the ease and apparent durability of the pile light. An Englishman named Mitchell had invented an iron pile having at the end a screw not unlike a large auger. By boring a number of these piles deep into the sand of the sea-bottom, and using them as the foundation for a small but durable iron building, he was enabled to construct a lighthouse in a considerable depth of water at small expense. Later builders have used ordinary iron piles, which are driven into the sand with heavy sledges. Waves and tides pass readily through the open-work of the foundation, the legs of the spider, without disturbing the building overhead. For Southern waters, where there is no danger of moving ice-packs, lighthouses of this type have been found very useful, although the action of the salt water on the iron piling necessitates frequent repairs. More than eighty lights of this description dot the shoals of Florida and adjoining States. Some of the oldest ones still remain in use in the North, notably the one on Brandywine shoal in Delaware Bay; but it has been found necessary to surround them with strongly built ice-breakers. Two magnificent iron-pile lights are found on Fowey Rocks and American Shoals, off the coast of Florida, the first of which was built with so much difficulty that its story is most interesting. [Illustration: The Fowey Rocks Lighthouse, Florida.] Fowey Reef lies five miles from the low coral island of Soldier Key. Northern storms, sweeping down the Atlantic, brush in wild breakers over the reef and out upon the little key, often burying it entirely under a torrent of water. Even in calm weather the sea is rarely quiet enough to make it safe for a vessel of any size to approach the reef. The builders erected a stout elevated wharf and store-house on the key, and brought their men and tools to await the opportunity to dart out when the sea was at rest and begin the work of marking the reef. Before shipment, the lighthouse, which was built in the North, was set up, complete from foundation to pinnacle, and thoroughly tested. At length the workmen were able to remain on the reef long enough to build a strong working platform twelve feet above the surface of the water, and set on iron-shod mangrove piles. Having established this base of operations in the enemy's domain, a heavy iron disk was lowered to the reef, and the first pile was driven through the hole at its centre. Elaborate tests were made after each blow of the sledge, and the slightest deviation from the vertical was promptly rectified with block and tackle. In two months' time nine piles were driven ten feet into the coral rock, the workmen toiling long hours under a blistering sun. When the time came to erect the superstructure, the sea suddenly awakened and storm followed storm, so that for weeks together no one dared venture out to the reef. The men rusted and grumbled on the narrow docks of the key, and work was finally suspended for an entire winter. At the very first attempt to make a landing in the spring, a tornado drove the vessels far out of their course. But a crew was finally placed on the working platform, with enough food to last them several weeks, and there they stayed, suspended between the sea and the sky, until the structure was complete. This lighthouse cost $175,000. The famous Bug Light of Boston and Thimble Light of Hampton Roads, Va., are both good examples of the iron-pile lighthouse. Now we come to a consideration of iron cylinder lighthouses, which are even more wonderful, perhaps, than the screw-piles, and in constructing them the sea-builder touches the pinnacle of his art. Imagine a sandy shoal marked only by a white-fringed breaker. The water rushes over it in swift and constantly varying currents, and if there is a capful of wind anywhere on the sea, it becomes an instant menace to the mariner. The shore may be ten or twenty miles away, so far that a land-light would only lure the seaman into peril, instead of guiding him safely on his way. A lightship is always uncertain; the first great storm may drive it from its moorings and leave the coast unprotected when protection is most necessary. Upon such a shoal, often covered from ten to twenty feet with water, the builder is called upon to construct a lighthouse, laying his foundation in shifting sand, and placing upon it a building strong enough to withstand any storm or the crushing weight of wrecks or ice-packs. It was less than twenty years ago that sea-builders first ventured to grapple with the difficulties presented by these off-shore shoals. In 1881 Germany built the first iron cylinder lighthouse at Rothersand, near the mouth of the Weser River, and three years later the Lighthouse Establishment of the United States planted a similar tower on Fourteen-Foot Banks, over three miles from the shores of Delaware Bay, in twenty feet of water. Since then many hitherto dangerous shoals have been marked by new lighthouses of this type. [Illustration: Fourteen-Foot Bank Light Station, Delaware Bay, Del.] When a builder begins a stone tower light on some lonely sea-rock, he says to the sea, "Do your worst. I'm going to stick right here until this light is built, if it takes a hundred years." And his men are always on hand in fair weather or foul, dropping one stone to-day and another to-morrow, and succeeding by virtue of steady grit and patience. The builder of the iron cylinder light pursues an exactly opposite course. His warfare is more spirited, more modern. He stakes his whole success on a single desperate throw. If he fails, he loses everything: if he wins, he may throw again. His lighthouse is built, from foundation caisson to lantern, a hundred or a thousand miles away from the reef where it is finally to rest. It is simply an enormous cast-iron tube made in sections or courses, each about six feet high, not unlike the standpipe of a village water-works. The builder must set up this tube on the shoal, sink it deep into the sand bottom, and fill it with rocks and concrete mortar, so that it will not tip over. At first such a feat would seem absolutely impossible; but the sea-builder has his own methods of fighting. With all the material necessary to his work, he creeps up on the shoal and lies quietly in some secluded harbour until the sea is calmly at rest, suspecting no attack. Then he darts out with his whole fleet, plants his foundation, and before the waves and the wind wake up he has established his outworks on the shoal. The story of the construction of one of these lighthouses will give a good idea of the terrible difficulties which their builders must overcome. Not long ago W. H. Flaherty, of New York, built such a lighthouse at Smith's Point, in Chesapeake Bay. At the mouth of the Potomac River the opposing tides and currents have built up shoals of sand extending eight or ten miles out into the bay. Here the waves, sweeping in from the open Atlantic, sometimes drown the side-lights of the big Boston steamers. The point has a grim story of wrecks and loss of life; in 1897 alone, four sea-craft were driven in and swamped on the shoals. The Lighthouse Establishment planned to set up the light just at the edge of the channel, and 120 miles south of Baltimore. [Illustration: The Great Beds Light Station, Raritan Bay, N. J. _A specimen of iron cylinder construction._] Eighty thousand dollars was appropriated for doing the work. In August, 1896, the contractors formally agreed to build the lighthouse for $56,000, and, more than that, to have the lantern burning within a single year. By the last of September a huge, unwieldy foundation caisson was framing in a Baltimore shipyard. This caisson was a bottomless wooden box, 32 feet square and 12 feet high, with the top nearly as thick as the height of a man, so that it would easily sustain the weight of the great iron cylinder soon to be placed upon it. It was lined and caulked, painted inside and out to make it air-tight and water-tight, and then dragged out into the bay, together with half an acre of mud and dock timbers. Here the workmen crowned it with the first two courses of the iron cylinder--a collar 30 feet in diameter and about 12 feet high. Inside of this a second cylinder, a steel air-shaft, five feet in diameter, rose from a hole in the centre of the caisson, this providing a means of entrance and exit when the structure should reach the shoal. Upon the addition of this vast weight of iron and steel, the wooden caisson, although it weighed nearly a hundred tons, disappeared completely under the water, leaving in view only the great black rim of the iron cylinder and the top of the air-shaft. On April 7th of the next year the fleet was ready to start on its voyage of conquest. The whole country had contributed to the expedition. Cleveland, O., furnished the iron plates for the tower; Pittsburg sent steel and machinery; South Carolina supplied the enormous yellow-pine timbers for the caisson; Washington provided two great barge-loads of stone; and New York City contributed hundreds of tons of Portland cement and sand and gravel, it being cheaper to bring even such supplies from the North than to gather them on the shores of the bay. Everything necessary to the completion of the lighthouse and the maintenance of the eighty-eight men was loaded aboard ship. And quite a fleet it made as it lay out on the bay in the warm spring sunshine. The flagship was a big, double-deck steamer, 200 feet over all, once used in the coastwise trade. She was loaded close down to her white lines, and men lay over her rails in double rows. She led the fleet down the bay, and two tugs and seven barges followed in her wake like a flock of ducklings. The steamer towed the caisson at the end of a long hawser. In three days the fleet reached the lighthouse site. During all of this time the sea had been calm, with only occasional puffs of wind, and the builders planned, somewhat exultantly, to drop the caisson the moment they arrived. But before they were well in sight of the point, the sea awakened suddenly, as if conscious of the planned surprise. A storm blew up in the north, and at sunset on the tenth of April the waves were washing over the top of the iron cylinder and slapping it about like a boy's raft. A few tons of water inside the structure would sink it entirely, and the builder would lose months of work and thousands of dollars. From a rude platform on top of the cylinder two men were working at the pumps to keep the water out. When the edge of the great iron rim heaved up with the waves, they pumped and shouted; and when it went down, they strangled and clung for their lives. The builder saw the necessity of immediate assistance. Twelve men scrambled into a life-boat, and three waves later they were dashed against the rim of the cylinder. Here half of the number, clinging like cats to the iron plates, spread out a sail canvas and drew it over the windward half of the cylinder, while the other men pulled it down with their hands and teeth and lashed it firmly into place. In this way the cylinder shed most of the wash, although the larger waves still scuttled down within its iron sides. Half of the crew was now hurried down the rope-ladders inside the cylinder, where the water was nearly three feet deep and swashing about like a whirlpool. They all knew that one more than ordinarily large wave would send the whole structure to the bottom; but they dipped swiftly, and passed up the water without a word. It was nothing short of a battle for life. They must keep the water down, or drown like rats in a hole. They began work at sunset, and at sunrise the next morning, when the fury of the storm was somewhat abated, they were still at work, and the cylinder was saved. [Illustration: A Storm at the Tillamook Lighthouse, in the Pacific, one mile out from Tillamook Head, Oregon.] The swells were now too high to think of planting the caisson, and the fleet ran into the mouth of the Great Wicomico River to await a more favourable opportunity. Here the builders lay for a week. To keep the men busy some of them were employed in mixing concrete, adding another course of iron to the cylinder, and in other tasks of preparation. The crew was composed largely of Americans and Irishmen, with a few Norwegians, the ordinary Italian or Bohemian labourer not taking kindly to the risks and terrors of such an expedition. Their number included carpenters, masons, iron-workers, bricklayers, caisson-men, sailors, and a host of common shovellers. The pay varied from twenty to fifty cents an hour for time actually worked, and the builders furnished meals of unlimited ham, bread, and coffee. On April 17th, the weather being calmer, the fleet ventured out stealthily. A buoy marked the spot where the lighthouse was to stand. When the cylinder was exactly over the chosen site, the valves of two of the compartments into which it was divided were quickly opened, and the water poured in. The moment the lower edge of the caisson, borne downward by the weight of water, touched the shoal, the men began working with feverish haste. Large stones were rolled from the barges around the outside of the caisson to prevent the water from eating away the sand and tipping the structure over. In the meantime a crew of twenty men had taken their places in the compartments of the cylinder still unfilled with water. A chute from the steamer vomited a steady stream of dusty concrete down upon their heads. A pump drenched them with an unceasing cataract of salt water. In this terrible hole they wallowed and struggled, shovelling the concrete mortar into place and ramming it down. Every man on the expedition, even the cooks and the stokers, was called upon at this supreme moment to take part in the work. Unless the structure could be sufficiently ballasted while the water was calm, the first wave would brush it over and pound it to pieces on the shoals. [Illustration: Saving the Cylinder of the Lighthouse at Smith Point, Chesapeake Bay, from being Swamped in a High Sea. _When the builders were towing the unwieldy cylinder out to set it in position, the water became suddenly rough and began to fill it. Workmen, at the risk of their lives, boarded the cylinder, and by desperate labours succeeded in spreading sail canvas over it, and so saved a structure that had cost months of labour and thousands of dollars._] After nearly two hours of this exhausting labour the captain of the steamer suddenly shouted the command to cast away. The sky had turned black and the waves ran high. All of the cranes were whipped in, and up from the cylinder poured the shovellers, looking as if they had been freshly rolled in a mortar bed. There was a confused babel of voices and a wild flight for the steamer. In the midst of the excitement one of the barges snapped a hawser, and, being lightened of its load, it all but turned over in a trough of the sea. The men aboard her went down on their faces, clung fast, and shouted for help, and it was only with difficulty that they were rescued. One of the life-boats, venturing too near the iron cylinder, was crushed like an egg-shell, but a tug was ready to pick up the men who manned it. So terrified were the workmen by the dangers and difficulties of the task that twelve of them ran away that night without asking for their pay. On the following morning the builder was appalled to see that the cylinder was inclined more than four feet from the perpendicular. In spite of the stone piled around the caisson, the water had washed the sand from under one edge of it, and it had tipped part way over. Now was the pivotal point of the whole enterprise. A little lack of courage or skill, and the work was doomed. The waves still ran high, and the freshet currents from the Potomac River poured past the shoals at the rate of six or seven miles an hour. And yet one of the tugs ran out daringly, dragging a barge-load of stone. It was made fast, and although it pitched up and down so that every wave threatened to swamp it and every man aboard was seasick, they managed to throw off 200 tons more of stone around the base of the caisson on the side toward which it was inclined. In this way further tipping in that direction was prevented, and the action of the water on the sand under the opposite side soon righted the structure. Beginning on the morning of April 21st the entire crew worked steadily for forty-eight hours without sleeping or stopping for meals more than fifteen minutes at a time. When at last they were relieved, they came up out of the cylinder shouting and cheering because the foundation was at last secure. The structure was now about thirty feet high, and filled nearly to the top with concrete. The next step was to force it down 15-1/2 feet into the hard sand at the bottom of the bay, thus securing it for ever against the power of the waves and the tide. An air-lock, which is a strongly built steel chamber about the size of a hogshead, was placed on top of the air-shaft, the water in the big box-like caisson at the bottom of the cylinder was forced out with compressed air, and the men prepared to enter the caisson. No toil can compare in its severity and danger with that of a caisson worker. He is first sent into the air-lock, and the air-pressure is gradually increased around him until it equals that of the caisson below; then he may descend. New men often shout and beg pitifully to be liberated from the torture. Frequently the effect of the compressed air is such that they bleed at the ears and nose, and for a time their heads throb as if about to burst open. In a few minutes these pains pass away, the workers crawl down the long ladder of the air-shaft and begin to dig away the sand of the sea-bottom. It is heaped high around the bottom of a four-inch pipe which leads up the air-shaft and reaches out over the sea. A valve in the pipe is opened and the sand and stones are driven upward by the compressed air in the caisson and blown out into the water with tremendous force. As the sand is mined away, the great tower above it slowly sinks downward, while the subterranean toilers grow sallow-faced, yellow-eyed, become half deaf, and lose their appetites. When Smith's Point Light was within two feet of being deep enough the workmen had a strange and terrible adventure. Ten men were in the caisson at the time. They noticed that the candles stuck along the wall were burning a lambent green. Black streaks, that widened swiftly, formed along the white-painted walls. One man after another began staggering dizzily, with eyes blinded and a sharp burning in the throat. Orders were instantly given to ascend, and the crew, with the help of ropes, succeeded in escaping. All that night the men lay moaning and sleepless in their bunks. In the morning only a few of them could open their eyes, and all experienced the keenest torture in the presence of light. Bags were fitted over their heads, and they were led out to their meals. [Illustration: Great Waves Dashed Entirely Over Them, so that They had to Cling for Their Lives to the Air-Pipes. _In erecting the Smith Point lighthouse, after the cylinder was set up, it had to be forced down fifteen and a half feet into the sand. The lives of the men who did this, working in the caisson at the bottom of the sea, were absolutely in the hands of the men who managed the engine and the air-compressor at the surface; and twice these latter were entirely deluged by the sea, but still maintained steam and kept everything running as if no sea was playing over them._] That afternoon Major E. H. Ruffner, of Baltimore, the Government engineer for the district, appeared with two physicians. An examination of the caisson showed that the men had struck a vein of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. Here was a new difficulty--a difficulty never before encountered in lighthouse construction. For three days the force lay idle. There seemed no way of completing the foundation. On the fourth day, after another flooding of the caisson, Mr. Flaherty called for volunteers to go down the air-shaft, agreeing to accompany them himself--all this in the face of the spectacle of thirty-five men moaning in their bunks, with their eyes burning and blinded and their throats raw. And yet fourteen men stepped forward and offered to "see the work through." Upon reaching the bottom of the tower they found that the flow of gas was less rapid, and they worked with almost frantic energy, expecting every moment to feel the gas griping in their throats. In half an hour another shift came on, and before night the lighthouse was within an inch or two of its final resting-place. The last shift was headed by an old caisson-man named Griffin, who bore the record of having stood seventy-five pounds of air-pressure in the famous Long Island gas tunnel. Just as the men were ready to leave the caisson the gas suddenly burst up again with something of explosive violence. Instantly the workmen threw down their tools and made a dash for the air-shaft. Here a terrible struggle followed. Only one man could go up the ladder at a time, and they scrambled and fought, pulling down by main force every man who succeeded in reaching the rounds. Then one after another they dropped in the sand, unconscious. Griffin, remaining below, had signalled for a rope. When it came down, he groped for the nearest workman, fastened it around his body, and sent him aloft. Then he crawled around and pulled the unconscious workmen together under the air-shaft. One by one he sent them up. The last was a powerfully built Irishman named Howard. Griffin's eyes were blinded, and he was so dizzy that he reeled like a drunken man, but he managed to get the rope around Howard's body and start him up. At the eighteen-inch door of the lock the unconscious Irishman wedged fast, and those outside could not pull him through. Griffin climbed painfully up the thirty feet of ladder and pushed and pulled until Howard's limp body went through. Griffin tried to follow him, but his numbed fingers slipped on the steel rim, and he fell backward into the death-hole below. They dropped the rope again, but there was no response. One of the men called Griffin by name. The half-conscious caisson-man aroused himself and managed to tie the rope under his arms. Then he, too, was hoisted aloft, and when he was dragged from the caisson, more dead than alive, the half-blinded men on the steamer's deck set up a shout of applause--all the credit that he ever received. Two of the men prostrated by the gas were sent to a hospital in New York, where they were months in recovering. Another went insane. Griffin was blind for three weeks. Four other caisson-men came out of the work with the painful malady known as "bends," which attacks those who work long under high air-pressure. A victim of the "bends" cannot straighten his back, and often his legs and arms are cramped and contorted. These terrible results will give a good idea of the heroism required of the sea-builder. Having sunk the caisson deep enough the workmen filled it full of concrete and sealed the top of the air-shaft. Then they built the light-keeper's home, and the lantern was ready for lighting. Three days within the contract year the tower was formally turned over to the Government. And thus the builders, besides providing a warning to the hundreds of vessels that yearly pass up the bay, erected a lasting monument to their own skill, courage, and perseverance. As long as the shoal remains the light will stand. In the course of half a century, perhaps less, the sea-water will gnaw away the iron of the cylinder, but there will still remain the core of concrete, as hard and solid as the day on which it was planted. It is fitting that work which has drawn so largely upon the highest intellectual and moral endowments of the engineer and the builder should not serve the selfish interests of any one man, nor of any single corporation, nor even of the Government which provided the means, but that it should be a gift to the world at large. Other nations, even Great Britain, which has more at stake upon the seas than any other country, impose regular lighthouse taxes upon vessels entering their harbours; but the lights erected by the United States flash a free warning to any ship of any land. [Illustration: Peter Cooper Hewitt. _With his interrupter._] CHAPTER IX THE NEWEST ELECTRIC LIGHT _Peter Cooper Hewitt and His Three Great Inventions--The Mercury Arc Light--The New Electrical Converter--The Hewitt Interrupter_ It is indeed a great moment when an inventor comes to the announcement of a new and epoch-making achievement. He has been working for years, perhaps, in his laboratory, struggling along unknown, unheard of, often poor, failing a hundred times for every achieved success, but finally, all in a moment, surprising the secret which nature has guarded so long and so faithfully. He has discovered a new principle that no one has known before, he has made a wonderful new machine--and it works! What he has done in his laboratory for himself now becomes of interest to all the world. He has a great message to give. His patience and perseverance through years of hard work have produced something that will make life easier and happier for millions of people, that will open great new avenues for human effort and human achievement, build up new fortunes; often, indeed, change the whole course of business affairs in the world, if not the very channels of human thought. Think what the steam-engine has done, and the telegraph, and the sewing-machine! All this wonder lies to-day in the brain of the inventor; to-morrow it is a part of the world's treasure. Such a moment came on an evening in January, 1902, when Peter Cooper Hewitt, of New York City--then wholly unknown to the greater world--made the announcement of an invention of such importance that Lord Kelvin, the greatest of living electricians, afterward said that of all the things he saw in America the work of Mr. Hewitt attracted him most. On that evening in January, 1902, a curious crowd was gathered about the entrance of the Engineers' Club in New York City. Over the doorway a narrow glass tube gleamed with a strange blue-green light of such intensity that print was easily readable across the street, and yet so softly radiant that one could look directly at it without the sensation of blinding discomfort which accompanies nearly all brilliant artificial lights. The hall within, where Mr. Hewitt was making the first public announcement of his discovery, was also illuminated by the wonderful new tubes. The light was different from anything ever seen before, grateful to the eyes, much like daylight, only giving the face a curious, pale-green, unearthly appearance. The cause of this phenomenon was soon evident; the tubes were seen to give forth all the rays except red--orange, yellow, green, blue, violet--so that under its illumination the room and the street without, the faces of the spectators, the clothing of the women lost all their shades of red; indeed, changing the very face of the world to a pale green-blue. It was a redless light. The extraordinary appearance of this lamp and its profound significance as a scientific discovery at once awakened a wide public interest, especially among electricians who best understood its importance. Here was an entirely new sort of electric light. The familiar incandescent lamp, the invention of Thomas A. Edison, though the best of all methods of illumination, is also the most expensive. Mr. Hewitt's lamp, though not yet adapted to all the purposes served by the Edison lamp, on account of its peculiar colour, produces eight times as much light with the same amount of power. It is also practically indestructible, there being no filament to burn out; and it requires no special wiring. By means of this invention electricity, instead of being the most costly means of illumination, becomes the cheapest--cheaper even than kerosene. No further explanation than this is necessary to show the enormous importance of this invention. Mr. Hewitt's announcement at once awakened the interest of the entire scientific world and made the inventor famous, and yet it was only the forerunner of two other inventions equally important. Once discover a master-key and it often unlocks many doors. Tracing out the principles involved in his new lamp, Mr. Hewitt invented: A new, cheap, and simple method of converting alternating electrical currents into direct currents. An electrical interrupter or valve, in many respects the most wonderful of the three inventions. Before entering upon an explanation of these discoveries, which, though seemingly difficult and technical, are really simple and easily understandable, it will be interesting to know something of Mr. Hewitt and his methods of work and the genesis of the inventions. Mr. Hewitt's achievements possess a peculiar interest for the people of this country. The inventor is an American of Americans. Born to wealth, the grandson of the famous philanthropist, Peter Cooper, the son of Abram S. Hewitt, one of the foremost citizens and statesmen of New York, Mr. Hewitt might have led a life of leisure and ease, but he has preferred to win his successes in the American way, by unflagging industry and perseverance, and has come to his new fortune also like the American, suddenly and brilliantly. As a people we like to see a man deserve his success! The same qualities which made Peter Cooper one of the first of American millionaires, and Abram S. Hewitt one of the foremost of the world's steel merchants, Mayor of New York, and one of its most trusted citizens, have placed Mr. Peter Cooper Hewitt among the greatest of American inventors and scientists. Indeed, Peter Cooper and Abram S. Hewitt were both inventors; that is, they had the imaginative inventive mind. Peter Cooper once said: "I was always planning and contriving, and was never satisfied unless I was doing something difficult--something that had never been done before, if possible." The grandfather built the first American locomotive; he was one of the most ardent supporters of Cyrus Field in the great project of an Atlantic cable, and he was for a score of years the president of a cable company. His was the curious, constructive mind. As a boy he built a washing machine to assist his overworked mother; later on he built the first lawnmower and invented a process for rolling iron, the first used in this country; he constructed a torpedo-boat to aid the Greeks in their revolt against Turkish tyranny in 1824. He dreamed of utilising the current of the East River for manufacturing power; he even experimented with flying machines, becoming so enthusiastic in this labour that he nearly lost the sight of an eye through an explosion which blew the apparatus to pieces. [Illustration: Watching a Test of the Hewitt Converter. _Lord Kelvin in the centre._] It will be seen, therefore, that the grandson comes naturally by his inclinations. It was his grandfather who gave him his first chest of tools and taught him to work with his hands, and he has always had a fondness for contriving new machines and of working out difficult scientific problems. Until the last few years, however, he has never devoted his whole time to the work which best pleased him. For years he was connected with his father's extensive business enterprise, an active member, in fact, of the firm of Cooper, Hewitt & Co., and he has always been prominent in the social life of New York, a member of no fewer than eight prominent clubs. But never for a moment in his career--he is now forty-two years old, though he looks scarcely thirty-five--has he ceased to be interested in science and mechanics. As a student in Stevens Institute, and later in Columbia College, he gave particular attention to electricity, physics, chemistry, and mechanics. Later, when he went into business, his inventive mind turned naturally to the improvement of manufacturing methods, with the result that his name appears in the Patent Records as the inventor of many useful devices--a vacuum pan, a glue clarifier, a glue cutter and other glue machinery. He worked at many sorts of trades with his own hands--machine-shop practice, blacksmithing, steam-fitting, carpentry, jewelry work, and other work-a-day employments. He was employed in a jeweller's shop, learning how to make rings and to set stones; he managed a steam launch; he was for eight years in his grandfather's glue factory, where he had practical problems in mechanics constantly brought to his attention. And he was able to combine all this hard practical work with a fair amount of shooting, golfing, and automobiling. Most of Mr. Hewitt's scientific work of recent years has been done after business hours--the long, slow, plodding toil of the experimenter. There is surely no royal road to success in invention, no matter how well a man may be equipped, no matter how favourably his means are fitted to his hands. Mr. Hewitt worked for seven years on the electrical investigations which resulted in his three great inventions; thousands of experiments were performed; thousands of failures paved the way for the first glimmer of success. His laboratory during most of these years was hidden away in the tall tower of Madison Square Garden, overlooking Madison Square, with the roar of Broadway and Twenty-third Street coming up from the distance. Here he has worked, gradually expanding the scope of his experiments, increasing his force of assistants, until he now has an office and two workshops in Madison Square Garden and is building a more extensive laboratory elsewhere. Replying to the remark that he was fortunate in having the means to carry forward his experiments in his own way, he said: "The fact is quite the contrary. I have had to make my laboratory pay as I went along." Mr. Hewitt chose his problem deliberately, and he chose one of the most difficult in all the range of electrical science, but one which, if solved, promised the most flattering rewards. "The essence of modern invention," he said, "is the saving of waste, the increase of efficiency in the various mechanical appliances." This of the muddy spots with her tiny handkerchief. "Your mother will know you couldn't help it." "I'll tell her it wasn't Sue's fault," cried Bunny. "The railroad oughtn't to have puddles where people will fall into 'em!" "That's right," chimed in Bunker Blue. "It ought to be filled up with dirt, and then it wouldn't hold water. You're to ride back with us in the pony cart, Miss Baker." "Oh, so you drove over for me; did you? That's very nice," said Aunt Lu with a smile. "My! How large Bunny has grown!" she went on, as she bent over and kissed him, having already done that to Sue, when she wiped away the little girl's tears. "I'll go and get the cart," Bunker said. "Yes, and I think I'll take Sue inside the station, and see if I can get a towel to clean off the worst of the mud stains," said Miss Baker. "She can sit away back in the pony cart, and I'll sit in front of her, so nobody will see the dirt on her dress," offered Bunny. "That's very kind of you," his aunt remarked. "We'll be all right soon. Bunker, will you see after my trunk, please?" she asked as she gave him the brass check. "It can be sent up later," she went on, "as I guess there is hardly room for it in the pony cart." "No'm, not scarcely," answered Bunker with a smile that showed his big, white teeth. "I'll have the expressman bring it up, or I can come down for it later," and he went away to the baggage room. The ticket agent in the station gave Aunt Lu a towel, with which she took some of the dirt from Sue's dress. The little girl was smiling now. "I like you, Aunt Lu," she said. "We're awful glad you came, and you'll play with us; won't you?" "Oh, yes, of course, dear. Well, what is it, Bunny?" she went on, as she saw the little boy looking closely at her hands. "Do you see something?" Aunt Lu asked. "It--it's that," and Bunny pointed to the shining ring. Aunt Lu's eyes sparkled, almost as brightly as the glittering stone in the ring, and her cheeks became red. "I know what it is--it's a diamond!" exclaimed Sue. "Isn't it, Aunt Lu?" "Yes, dear." "Did you find it?" asked Bunny. "Or did you dig it out of a gold mine?" "Diamonds don't come from gold mines; they make 'em out of glass!" said Sue. "Yes they do dig 'em; don't they, Aunt Lu?" insisted Bunny. "Yes, dear, they do dig them." "Where did you dig it?" Sue wanted to know. Perhaps she hoped she could dig one for herself. "I did not dig it," their aunt said. "It was given me by a very dear friend. I love it very much," and she held up the diamond ring, so that it sparkled more than ever in the sun. "Well, Sue," she went on, as she finished scrubbing away at the muddy dress. "I think that is the best I can do. It will need washing to make it clean again. But here comes Bunker with the pony cart, so we will start for your house. Your mother will be wondering what has become of us." Aunt Lu had been on a visit to the Brown's several times before, and as she sat in the pony cart with the children, with Bunker driving, she bowed to several persons whom she knew and who knew her. There was Mr. Sam Gordon, who kept the grocery, Jacob Reinberg, who sold drygoods and notions, and little Mrs. Redden, who kept a candy and toy store. "Stop here a minute, Bunker," said Miss Baker, when the pony cart reached the toy store. "I want to get something for Bunny and Sue." "Candy?" asked Bunny eagerly. "Yes, just a little," his aunt answered, and soon Bunny and Sue were nibbling the sweets Mrs. Redden brought out to them. Just as he had said he would do, Bunny sat in front of his sister, so no one would see her soiled dress. But Sue did not much mind about it now. Her mother only said she was sorry, when she heard about the accident, and did not blame her little daughter. Mrs. Brown and her sister were glad to see one another, and after Aunt Lu had taken off her hat, and was seated In the cool dining room, sipping a cup of tea, Bunny called to her: "Aunt Lu, won't you come out and play with us?" "Please do!" begged Sue. "I have a new doll." "And I have a new top," added Bunny. "It hums and whistles. I'll let you spin it, Aunt Lu." "Oh, dears, your aunt can't come out now," said Mrs. Brown. "She must rest. Some other time she may. She and I want to sit and talk now. You run off and play by yourselves." "Don't you want to come down and see the fish boat come in?" went on Bunny, wondering why it was that grown folks would rather sit and talk than play out of doors and have fun. "Oh, yes, let's take her down to the dock and see the fish boats come in!" exclaimed Sue, for this was one of their delights. Some of the boats were those which the fishermen hired from Mr. Brown, and it was at his dock, where he had an office, that the boats landed, the fish being taken out, put in barrels, with ice, and sent to the city. "No, Aunt Lu can't go to the dock with you now," Mrs. Brown said. "Some other time, my dears." "Then may we go?" asked Bunny. Mrs. Brown hesitated. Then, as she saw Bunker Blue coming in with Aunt Lu's trunk, which he had gone down to get, instead of sending it up by an expressman, the children's mother said: "Yes, Bunny, you and Sue may go down to the dock with Bunker. But stay with him, and don't fall in; you especially, Sue, as I don't want to put another clean dress on you." "Oh, I'll be careful, Mother," Sue promised, and away she and her brother hurried, calling to Bunker to wait for them. Bunker was very glad to do this, because he liked to be with Bunny and Sue. "Have the fish boats come in yet, Bunker?" asked Bunny, as he trudged along, holding one of the red-haired lad's hands, while Sue had the other. "No, Bunny, they're not in yet, but maybe they will be coming soon after we get to the dock," Bunker answered. And so it happened. Bunny and Sue went into their father's office for a moment, to tell him that Aunt Lu had arrived, and then, with Bunker to look after them, they went out on the end of the dock. Soon one of the big fish boats came in. It was loaded with several kinds of fish, some big flat ones, white on one side, and black on the other. These were flounders. There were some blue fish, large and small, and some long-legged "fiddler" crabs. But they were not the kind that is good to eat. "Oh, look at that big lobster!" exclaimed Bunny, pointing to a dark green fellow, with big claws, and a tail curled up underneath. "Isn't he big!" Sue said. She and her brother often saw many strange fish, but they never failed to be interested in them, and this lobster was a fine one. "Yes," said a fisherman, "he was in our nets, and we brought him in with us. Your father, the other day, said he'd like to have one, and maybe he will want this." "I'll go and ask him," said the little chap. "And maybe Aunt Lu likes lobsters, too," Sue said. Neither she nor Bunny cared for lobster, as they did for other fish. But grown folks are very fond of the big, clawy creatures. Perhaps some of you children have never seen a lobster. They are a sort of fish, though they have no scales. They live inside a shell that is dark green when the lobster is alive. But when he is cooked it turns a bright red. Lobsters have two big claws, and a number of little ones, and with these claws they walk around, backward, on the bottom of the ocean or bay, and pick up things to eat. In some inland rivers and streams there are what are called crayfish, or crabs. They are very much like lobsters, only, of course, a lobster is much larger. Mr. Brown came out of his office when the fish were being unloaded from the boat, into barrels of ice. He saw the big lobster and said he would buy it, to take home to cook for supper. "We'll have a fine salad from him," said Bunny's father to the fisherman. The lobster was still alive and the fisherman picked it up just back of the big, pinching claws, so he would not get nipped, and put the lobster in a basket for Mr. Brown to carry. Bunny and Sue leaned over, looking at the green shellfish, when a voice behind them asked: "What is it?" The children turned to see George Watson, a boy older than Bunny, who lived near him. George often played little tricks on Bunny and Sue. "What is it?" he asked again. "A whale?" "A big lobster," Bunny answered. "I guess he could almost pinch your nose off in one of his claws," Sue said, not going too close to the basket. "Pooh! I'm not afraid of him," George declared. "I'll let him pinch this stick," he went on, picking up one, and holding it out toward the lobster, which was slowly waving its "feelers" to and fro, and moving its big eyes, that looked like shoe buttons sticking out from its head. "Better look out!" was Bunker's warning, seeing what George was doing. "He'll nip you!" "I'm not afraid!" boasted George. "I can----" And just then something happened. George got his finger too near the lobster's claw and was at once caught. "Ouch!" cried George. "Oh dear! He's got me! Make him let go, Bunker! Oh, dear!" Bunker did not stop to say: "I told you so!" He took out his big knife, and put the blade between the teeth of the lobster's claw, forcing it open so George could pull out his finger. Then, with a howl of pain and fright, the boy ran home. He was not much hurt, as a lobster can not shut his claws very tightly when out of water. Just as does a fish, a lobster soon dies when taken from the ocean. "What's the matter?" cried Mr. Brown, running up when he heard George's cries. "Are you hurt, Bunny--Sue?" "No, it was George," Bunker explained. "He thought he could fool the lobster, but the lobster fooled him." "I guess I'd better take it home and have mother cook it," said the children's father, and home they started, Mr. Brown carrying the big lobster in the basket. "Oh, what a fine large one!" Aunt Lu cried, when she saw it. "And what a fine salad it will make." "May I have one of the claws--the big one?" begged Bunny. "What for?" asked his mother. "I want to put a string in it and tie it on my face, over my own nose," the little boy explained. "Then I'll look just like Mr. Punch, in Punch and Judy. May I have the claw?" "I guess so," replied Mrs. Brown. "And when you clean it out, and put it on your nose, I'll be Mrs. Judy," said Sue. "We'll have fun." A lobster's claw, I might say, is filled with meat that is very good to eat. When the lobster is boiled and the meat picked out with a fork, the claw is hollow. It is shaped just like the nose of Mr. Punch, with a sort of hook on the end of it, where the claw curves downward. Bunny and Sue often played with empty lobster claws. The children went out in the yard while Mrs. Brown cooked the lobster. Then, when it was cool, Aunt Lu helped pick out the meat which was to be mixed up into a salad. "Is my big lobster claw ready now?" asked Bunny, coming up just before the supper bell was to ring. "Yes, here it is," his aunt told him. "I cleaned it out nicely for you." Bunny held it over his own nose and went toward the mirror to see how he would look. "Oh, you're just exactly like Mr. Punch!" Sue cried, clapping her hands. "Isn't he!" agreed Aunt Lu. And then she gave a sudden cry. "Oh dear!" she gasped. "Oh dear! It's gone! I've lost it!" "What?" asked Bunny. "My ring! My beautiful diamond ring is lost!" And Aunt Lu's cheeks turned pale. CHAPTER III WANGO, THE MONKEY Aunt Lu hurried over to the kitchen table, at which she had been helping Mrs. Brown make the lobster salad. She looked among the dishes, and knives and forks, but shook her head. "No, it isn't there," she said, quite sadly. "What isn't? What is the matter?" asked Mrs. Brown, who came in from the dining room just then. "Can't you find the big lobster claw that Bunny wanted? I laid it----" "Oh, I have it, Mother, thank you," the little boy said. "But Aunt Lu has lost----" "It's my diamond ring--Jack's engagement ring," said Mrs. Brown's sister. "It must have slipped off my finger, and----" "Oh dear! That's too bad!" said Mrs. Brown. "But it must be around here somewhere. We'll find it!" Bunny and Sue hardly knew what to make of it all. They had never seen their Aunt Lu so worried. "Mother, what's an engagement ring?" asked Sue, in a whisper, as Aunt Lu kept on looking among the things on the table, hoping her diamond might have dropped off there. Then she looked on the floor. "An engagement ring, my dear," said Sue's mother, "is a ring that means a promise. A very dear friend of Aunt Lu's has promised to marry her, and he gave her the diamond ring to be a sort of reminder--a most beautiful present. Now we must help her find it." "It can't be far away," Mrs. Brown said to her sister. "You were not out of this room, were you?" "No, I've been here ever since I began to pick the meat out of the lobster, and I had my ring on then." "Oh, then we'll find it," said Bunny's mother. But it was not so easy to do that as it was to say it. They looked all over the kitchen--on the floor, under the table, among the dishes, the pots and pans--but no diamond ring could be found. Papa Brown came in from the front porch, where he had been reading the evening paper, and he helped search, but it seemed of no use. "Oh, where can my beautiful ring have dropped?" asked Aunt Lu, and Sue thought she saw signs of tears in her aunt's eyes. "Perhaps it fell into the lobster salad," suggested Mr. Brown. "Then you can find it when you eat," called Bunny. "Only don't bite on the diamond. It might break." "We'll look in the salad now," Mrs. Brown said. They did so, looking in the dish that held the chopped-up bits of lobster meat, but no diamond ring was to be found. Then the floor was looked over again, most carefully, the empty dishes were turned upside down in the hope that the ring might drop out of one of them. But it did not. Aunt Lu looked sad and worried, and so did Mr. and Mrs. Brown. The cook, who had been out for the afternoon, came in and she helped search for the diamond ring, but it could not be found. "I'm sure I had it, when I began making the lobster salad," said Aunt Lu, "but when I handed Bunny the empty claw I looked on my finger, and the ring was gone." "Perhaps it dropped out of doors," suggested Papa Brown. They looked near the side porch where Bunny had been standing when his aunt gave him the claw with which he was going to play Punch, but the ring was not found there. "Oh dear! I feel so sorry!" Aunt Lu said, "If only I could find my lovely ring. Bunny--Sue, you must help me. To whomever finds it I'll give a nice present---anything he wants. That will be a reward, children." "Yes, you must help Aunt Lu look for her ring," said Mrs. Brown. "Come now, we will have supper, and look afterward. We may find it when we least expect it." But even after supper, the ring was not found. The whole family searched. Aunt Lu did not eat much supper, much as she liked lobster salad. She was too worried, I guess. Even Bunny did not feel like playing Mr. Punch with the big hollow lobster claw that fitted over his nose in such a funny way. Neither he nor Sue felt like making jokes when their aunt felt so unhappy. That night, when he and Sue went to bed, Bunny put the lobster claw away. "We'll play with it some other time," he said to his sister. "Yes," she agreed. "Some day when Aunt Lu finds her ring, and then she'll play with us, and be the audience. You will be Mr. Punch, and I'll be Mrs. Judy. Only I don't want to wear a lobster claw on my nose." "No, I'll be the only one to wear a claw," said Bunny in a sleepy voice, and then he dreamed of sailing off to "by-low land." Aunt Lu was up early the next morning, down in the kitchen, and out in the yard, looking for her lost ring. But it was not found, and Aunt Lu's face seemed to grow more sad. But she smiled at Bunny and Sue, and said: "Oh, well, perhaps some day I shall find it." "We'll look all over for it," said Bunny. "Indeed we will," added Sue. "Let's look out in the yard now, Bunny." The children looked, but had no luck Then, as it was not time for dinner, they wandered down the street. "Don't go too far away," their mother called after them. "Don't go down to the fish dock unless some one is with you." "No, Mother, we won't!" Bunny promised. They had each a penny that Aunt Lu had given them the day before, and now they wandered toward the little candy store kept by Mrs. Redden. She smiled at Bunny and Sue as they entered. Nearly every one did smile at the two children, who wandered about, hand in hand. "Well, what is it to-day?" asked the store-lady. "Lollypops or caramels?" "I want a penny's worth of peanuts," said Bunny. "And I'll take some little chocolate drops," said Sue. Soon, with their little treat, the brother and sister walked on toward the corner, the candy store being half way between that and their house. As they passed a little dark red cottage, in front of which was an old boat, filled with flowers and vines, Bunny and Sue heard some one inside screaming and crying: "Oh dear! Stop it I tell you! Let go my hair! Oh, if I get hold of you I'll make you stop! Oh dear! Jed! Jed! Where are you?" Bunny and Sue looked at one another. "That's Miss Winkler yelling!" said Bunny. "But what makes her?" asked Sue. "I don't know. We'll go and see," suggested Bunny. Into the yard of the little red house ran the two children. Around to the kitchen they went, and, looking in through the open door they saw a strange sight. Standing in front of a window was an elderly woman, wearing glasses which, just now, hung down over one ear. But, stranger still, there was a monkey, perched up on the pole over the window. One of the monkey's brown, hairy paws was entangled in the lady's hair, and the monkey seemed to be pulling hard, while the lady was screaming and trying to reach the fuzzy creature. "Oh, it's Wango, the monkey, and he's up to some of his tricks!" cried Bunny. "He'll pull out all her hair!" Sue exclaimed. "Oh, Bunny--Sue--run for my brother! Go get Jed!" begged Miss Winkler. "Tell him Wango is terrible! He must come at once. Wango is such a bad monkey he won't mind me!" And Wango kept on pulling her hair! CHAPTER IV THE EMPTY HOUSE Bunny Brown and his sister Sue hardly knew what to do. They just stood there, looking at the monkey pulling and tugging on the rather thin hair of Miss Winkler, and she, poor lady, could not reach up high enough to get hold of Wango, who was perched quite high up, on the window pole. "Oh, Bunny!" cried Sue. "We must do something--but what?" Sue felt that her brother, as he was a whole year older than she, ought to know what to do. "I--I'll get him down!" cried Bunny, who, as had Sue, had, some time before, made friends with the old sailor's queer pet. "How can you get him down?" Sue wanted to know. "I--I can stand on a chair and reach up to him," went on the small, blue-eyed boy, looking around for one to step on. "No, no!" exclaimed Miss Winkler, as she heard what Bunny said. "You musn't go near him, Bunny. He might bite or scratch you. He is very bad and ugly to-day. I don't know what ails him. Stop it, Wango!" she ordered. "Stop it at once! Come down from there, and stop pulling my hair!" But the monkey did nothing of the sort. He neither came down, nor did he stop pulling the lady's hair, as Sue and Bunny could easily tell. For they could see Wango give it a yank now and then, and, when he did, poor Miss Winkler would cry out in pain. "Oh, go for my brother! He's down on the fish dock I think," Miss Winkler begged. "No, we can't go there," replied Bunny slowly. "Our mother told us not to go there unless Bunker Blue or Aunt Lu was with us." "Then the monkey will never let go of my hair," sighed Miss Winkler. "Yes, he will," Bunny said. "I'll make him." "How?" Sue wanted to know. "This way!" exclaimed her brother, as he held out some of the peanuts he had bought at Miss Redden's store. "Here, Wango!" he called. "Come and get some peanuts!" "And I'll give him some caramels," cried Sue, as she held out some of her candy. I do not know whether or not Wango understood what Bunny and Sue said, but I am sure he knew that the candy and peanuts were good to eat. For, with a chatter of delight, he suddenly let go of Miss Winkler's hair and scrambled down to the floor near Bunny. "Look out that he doesn't bite you," Miss Winkler said. "Be careful, Sue!" "I'm not afraid," said Bunny Brown. "Nor I," added Sue. Wango was very tame, however. The way he acted, after he saw the good things to eat, would have made anyone think he was always kind and gentle. For he carefully took the peanuts from Bunny in one paw, and a caramel from Sue in another, and then, making a bow, as the old sailor had taught him, the mischievous monkey scrambled into his cage in one corner of the room. The next minute Miss Winkler had shut the cage door and fastened it. "There!" she exclaimed, "the next time I let you out of your cage you'll know it, Wango!" "What happened?" asked Bunny. "I don't know, child," the elderly lady answered, as she began to coil up her hair. "He is usually good, though he minds my brother better than he does me. When Jed was here, a while ago, he was playing with Wango out in the room, and, I suppose, when he put the saucy creature back in the cage, the door did not fasten well. "Anyhow, when I was making some cookies awhile ago I suddenly felt something behind me, and, as I tumid around, I saw the monkey. He made a grab for a cookie, and I had to slap his paws for I won't have him doing tricks like that. "Then he got mad, snatched my comb out of my hair, and, when I ran after him, he got up on the window pole, grabbed my hair and stayed up there where I couldn't reach him. Oh, what a time I've had!" "It's too bad," said Sue kindly. "I don't know what I would have done if you children hadn't come along," went on Miss Winkler, "for I had called and called, and no one heard me. I'll make Jed put a good lock on the monkey-cage after this. Now come out to the kitchen and I'll give you each a cookie." Wango seemed to want a cookie also, for he chattered and made queer faces as he shook the door of his cage. "No, indeed! You sha'n't have a bit!" scolded Miss Winkler. "You were very bad." Wango chattered louder than ever. Perhaps he was saying he was sorry for what he had done, but he got no cookie. Bunny and Sue each had a nice brown one, though, with a raisin in the centre, and, after Miss Winkler had thanked them again, they kept on with their walk down the street. "Wasn't Wango funny?" asked Sue, as she nibbled her cookie. "That's what he was," Bunny said. "'Member the time when he pulled the cat's tail?" "Yes," agreed Sue. "And when he sat down in the fly paper! That was funnier than this time." "I guess Miss Winkler didn't think this was funny," commented Bunny. "I guess the monkey doesn't like her." "But he minds Mr. Winkler," Sue said. "I've seen him make the monkey stand on his head." The old sailor, who had brought Wango home, after one of his many ocean voyages, had taught the furry little creature many tricks. But though Wango minded Mr. Winkler very well, he did not always do what Miss Winkler told him to do. As Sue walked on, still nibbling her cookie, she kept looking down at the ground, until at last Bunny asked her: "What are you looking at Sue--trying not to step on ants?" For this was a game the children often played. "Not this time," Sue answered. "I was looking to see if I could find Aunt Lu's ring." "Why, she didn't lose it down here!" Bunny said, in surprise. "Maybe she did," returned Sue. "She thought she lost it around our house, but she looked, and we all looked, and we didn't find it, so maybe it was lost down here. I'm going to look, and if we find it we'll get a present." "I'll help you look," said Bunny kindly, "but I don't believe it's down here." The two children walked along a little farther, with their eyes searching the ground, but they saw no golden ring. "Oh, I tell you what let's do!" suddenly exclaimed Bunny. "What?" asked Sue, eager to have some fun. "Let's go back home, and I'll put the lobster claw on my nose, and we'll play Punch and Judy. We haven't done that yet." "All right, we'll do it!" Sue agreed. "And I'll let you take my sawdust doll. You have to hit her with a stick you know, if you're Mr. Punch, and it won't hurt a sawdust doll." "All right," Bunny cried. "And when I hit her I'll call out, the way Mr. Punch does: 'That's the way to do it! That's the way I do it!'" He said this in the funny, squeaky voice which is always heard at Punch and Judy shows, and Sue laughed. She thought her brother was very funny. Bunny and Sue were about to turn around and go back home, but, as they came to a stop in front of the last house on their block Bunny said: "Oh, Sue, look! They're painting this house, and maybe we can get some red or blue paint, to put on my face, when I play Mr. Punch." "Oh, Bunny Brown! You wouldn't put paint on your face; would you?" demanded Sue. "Just a little," said Bunny. "Why not?" "S'posin' you couldn't get it off again?" Sue wanted to know. "Oh, I could wash it off when I got through playing," Bunny replied. "Come on in, and we'll see if the men will give us a little paint; red, or blue or green." Outside the house, in front of which the children then stood, were a number of pots of differently colored paint, and some ladders. But there was no paint yet on the outside of the house. "I guess they're painting inside," Bunny said. "I don't see any of the men out here. Come on, we'll go in; the door is open, Sue." The front door was open a little way, as the two children could see as they went up the walk. Bunny and Sue knew every house in that part of town, and also knew the persons who lived in them. All the neighbors knew the children, making them welcome every time they saw them. "There's no one in this house, I 'member now," Sue said. "Miss Duncan used to live here, but she moved away." "Then I guess the men are painting it over all nice inside to get it ready for someone else to live in," remarked Bunny. "There isn't anyone here, Sue," he added, as his voice echoed through the empty house. "Even the painters have gone." "We'd better go out," said Sue. "Maybe they wouldn't like us to be in here." "Pooh! Nobody will care!" exclaimed Bunny, who was rather a daring little fellow. "Besides, I want to get some paint. Come on, we'll go upstairs. Maybe they're painting up there, or pasting new paper on the walls." Bunny started up the front hall stairs, and, as Sue did not want to be left alone on the first floor of the empty house, and as she did not want to go out, and leave Bunny there, she followed him. Their footsteps sounded loud and queer in the big, vacant rooms. As they reached the top of the stairs they heard behind them a loud banging noise. "What--what was that?" asked Sue, looking quickly over her shoulder. "I--I guess the front door blew shut," said Bunny. "Never mind, we can open it again. I want to get some red paint for my face, so I can play Mr. Punch." But if Bunny and Sue knew what had happened when that banging noise sounded, they would not have felt like walking on through the empty rooms, even to get red paint. CHAPTER V LOCKED IN "On, say, Bunny!" suddenly called Sue, as she followed her brother through the upstairs rooms, "wouldn't it be fun for us to live here?" "Do you mean just us two?" the little boy asked. "Yes," answered Sue. Bunny shook his head. "I'd like mother, and daddy, and Aunt Lu, too," he said. "It would be nicer, then." "Oh, but sometimes they don't want us to make a noise," went on Sue. "And if we were here all alone we could yell and holler, and slide down the banister, all we wanted to. Let's slide down now," she said, as she went to the head of the stairs, and looked at the long, smooth hand-rail. "Say, that will be fun," Bunny cried. "I'll go first, Sue, but don't come after me too close, or you might bump into me and knock me over." "I won't," promised the little girl. It did not take much to cause Bunny to change his mind or his plans when there was any fun to be had. For a while he forgot about looking for red paint to put on his face to make him look funny when he played Mr. Punch, with the hollow lobster claw on his nose. Just now the joy of sliding down the banister rail seemed to be the best in the world. "Here I go!" cried Bunny, and down the rail he went, ending with a little bump on the big, round post at the bottom. "Now it's my turn," Sue said, and down she came. Though she was a girl Sue could slide down a rail almost as well as could Bunny. In fact, she had played with her brother so much that she could do many of the things that small boys do. And Bunny surely thought that Sue was as good a chum as any of his boy playmates. "Now it's my turn again!" exclaimed the little blue-eyed chap, as he went up the stairs, his feet making a loud noise in the empty house. For some time Bunny and Sue played at sliding down the banister rail, and then Bunny remembered what they had first come into the house for. "Let's go to look for that red paint," he said. "All right," agreed Sue. Her little legs were beginning to get tired from running up the stairs so often. Back up to the second floor went the children, looking through the vacant rooms. But no paint pots did they see. "I guess all the paint is outside," said Bunny. "We'll go down and get some." "Maybe the man wouldn't like us to take it," said Sue. "We'll pay him for it, if he wants money," Bunny replied, as though he had plenty. "Mother or Aunt Lu will give us pennies soon," he said, "and I can give the man mine. I only want about a penny's worth of red paint Come on, we'll go out, Sue, and get some." "Yes, and then we'd better go home," Sue went on. "I guess it's going to be dark pretty soon," and she looked out of a window. It was getting on toward evening, but the children had been having so much fun that they had not noticed this. Bunny and Sue walked through all the upstairs rooms of the empty house. In one Bunny saw something that made him call out: "Oh, Sue, look! A lot of picture books! Let's sit down and read them!" Of course Bunny and Sue could not read, though the little boy knew some of his letters. So when he said "read" he meant look at the pictures. The books were some old magazines that the family, in moving away from the house, had left behind. Bunny and Sue made each a little pile of the paper books for seats and then they sat there looking at the pictures in another pile of magazines on the floor beside them. "Oh, look at this dog, riding on a horse's back!" exclaimed Bunny, showing Sue a picture he had found in his book. "Yes, it's like in a circus," Sue agreed. "And see, here's a colored picture of a cow. Oh, I wish I had a drink of milk, Bunny. I'm hungry! It must be pretty near supper time." "I guess it is," the little fellow agreed, as he patted his own stomach. "We'll go home, Sue. I wonder if we couldn't take some of those books with us?" "I guess so," Sue said. "Nobody wants 'em." "And, anyhow, we didn't get any red paint, though maybe I can find some outside," Bunny said. "We'll each take a book." It took a little time for Bunny and Sue each to pick out the book, with the pictures in it, that was most liked. But finally, each with a magazine held tightly, the children started to go down stairs. "Here I go!" cried Bunny again, as he straddled the banister railing. Down he slid, but this time Sue did not wait until her brother had reached the bottom post. "Oh, what's that?" cried Bunny, sitting up in his cot, for the noise had awakened him. "What's the matter?" he asked. "It's a thunder storm," replied his father. "Go to sleep, for it can't hurt you." But Bunny could not go to sleep, nor could Sue. She, too, was awakened by the bright lightning, and the loud thunder. The wind, too, blew very hard, and it shook the sleeping tent as if it would tear it loose from the ropes. "Do you think it is safe?" asked Mother Brown. "Oh, I think so," answered her husband. "Bunker and I put on some extra ropes before we came in. I guess the tent won't blow away." Everyone was wide awake now. The storm was a very heavy one. The wind howled through the trees in the wood, and, now and then, a loud crash could be heard, as some tree branch broke off and fell to the ground. Then, suddenly, it began to rain very hard. My! how the big drops did pelt down on the tent, sounding like dried corn falling on a tin pan! "Oh, the rain is coming in on me!" cried Bunny. "I'm getting all wet, Daddy!" Surely enough, there was a little hole in the tent, right over Bunny's cot, and the rain was coming in there. "Swish!" went the lightning. "Bang!" went the thunder. "Whoo-ee!" blew the wind. It was certainly a bad storm at Camp Rest-a-While. CHAPTER XIV TOM IS GONE "Daddy! Daddy!" cried Sue, from behind the curtain, in the part of the tent where she slept with her mother. "Daddy, do you think we'll blow away?" "Oh, no," answered Mr. Brown. "Don't be afraid. Bunker and I fastened down the tent good and strong. It can't blow over." "But I'm getting all wet!" cried Bunny. "The water's leaking all over my bed, Daddy!" "Yes, I didn't know there was a hole in the tent. I'll fix it to-morrow," said Bunny's father. "You get in my bed, Bunny!" "Oh, goodie!" Bunny cried. He always liked to get in his father's bed. But as Bunny jumped out of his own little cot, and pattered in his bare feet across to his father's, he saw Daddy Brown getting up. Mr. Brown was putting on a pair of rubber boots, and a rubber coat over his bath robe, which he had put on when the storm began. "Where you going, Daddy?" asked Bunny, as he crawled into the dry bed, and pulled the covers up over him, for the wind was blowing in the tent now. "Where you going?" "I'm going out to see that the tent ropes are all right," said Mr. Brown. "Going out? What for?" called Mrs. Brown. "You musn't go out in this storm. It's terrible!" "Oh, but I must go!" answered Daddy Brown with a laugh. "I don't mind the thunder, lightning and rain. If some of the tent pegs come loose, the ropes will slip off, and the tent will blow over. Bunker Blue and I will go out and make sure everything is all right." "I could go with you," said Uncle Tad from his cot. "Shall I?" "No, you stay where you are," Daddy Brown said. "You might get the rheumatism if you got wet." "I used to get wet enough when I was in the army," returned the old soldier. "Many a time, when it stormed, I used to get up to fix the tent." "Well, Bunker and I will do it now, thank you," Mr. Brown went on. By this time Bunker Blue had on his rubber boots and coat. Then, taking a lantern with them, Mr. Brown and Bunker went outside. "Fasten the tent door after us, Tom," called Mr. Brown to the city boy, "or everything will blow away inside. Tie the tent flaps shut with the ropes, and you can open them for us when we want to come in again." Out in the storm went Daddy Brown and Bunker Blue. As they opened the flaps, or front door of the tent, a big gust of wind came in, and dashed rain in Bunny's face, so that he covered his head with the bed clothes. He had one look at a bright flash of lightning, and he could see the ground outside all covered with water. "I'm glad I don't have to go out in the storm," he thought, and he felt sorry for his father and Bunker Blue. But Mr. Brown had often been out on the ocean in worse storms than this, and so had Bunker, so they did not mind. With their lantern they walked all around the sleeping-tent, making sure that all the ropes were fast to the pegs, which were driven into the ground. Some of the wooden pegs were coming loose, and these Mr. Brown and Bunker hammered farther into the dirt. All the while the wind blew, and the rain pelted down, while the lightning flashed brighter, and the thunder rumbled so loudly that it scared Sue. "I--I don't like it!" she sobbed, and she crept into bed with her mother. "Please make it stop, Mother!" "No one can make the thunder stop, Sue, dear," said Mrs. Brown. "But the thunder won't hurt you, and the storm is almost over." Just then there came a very loud clap. "Oh, dear!" cried Sue. "I'se afraid!" Bunny heard his sister, and called out: "That sounded just like Fourth of July; didn't it, Sue? When the big boys fired the cannon on top of the hill." "Isn't you afraid, Bunny?" asked Sue. "No, I--I like it," Bunny answered. He tried to make himself believe he did, so Sue would not be so frightened. "Well, if you isn't afraid I isn't goin' to be, either," said Sue, after a moment. And she stopped crying at once, and lay quietly in her mother's cot-bed. And then the storm seemed to go away. It still rained very hard, but the wind did not howl so loudly, and the lightning was not so scary, nor the thunder so rumbly. The rain still leaked in through the hole in the tent, but Tom Vine moved Bunny's cot out of the way, and set a pail under the leak. All at once there sounded a banging noise, as if a whole store full of pots and pans and kettles had been turned upside down. "Oh, what's that?" cried Mother Brown. "Sounded as if something blew away," said Uncle Tad. "I'll get up and look." But he did not have to, for, just then, in came Daddy Brown and Bunker Blue, their rubber coats all shining wet in the lantern light. "What made that noise?" asked Mother Brown. "The cook-tent blew over," said Daddy Brown, "and all the pots, pans and kettles fell in a heap. But we'll let them go until morning, I guess, as the worst of the storm is over. Now we'll all go to bed again." "This tent won't blow over; will it, Daddy?" asked Bunny. "No, it's all safe now. Go to sleep." But it was some little time before they were all asleep again. Nothing more happened that night, and Bunny and Sue were up very early the next morning to see what the storm had done. Camp Rest-a-While was not a pretty sight. Besides the cook-tent having been blown over, there were broken branches of trees scattered about. The tents were covered with leaves blown from the trees, and there were many mud puddles. The oil stove, and the pots, pans and other things, with which Mother Brown cooked, were piled in a heap under the fallen cook-tent. The tent itself was soaking wet, and one of the poles that had held it up was broken. "Oh, we can't ever have anything to eat!" said Sue sadly, as she looked at the fallen tent. "We can build a campfire," said Bunny. "Uncle Tad used to cook breakfast over one; didn't you?" and he turned to the old soldier. "Yes, Bunny, I did. But I guess we won't have to this time. We'll soon have the oil stove working." Then he and Daddy Brown, with Bunker Blue and Tom Vine, set to work. The blown-down tent was pulled to one side, and it was seen that though everything under it was in a heap, still nothing was broken. Soon some milk was being warmed for the children, and coffee made for the older folk. Then Mother Brown even made pancakes on the oil stove, which was set up on a box at one side of the dining-tent. The day was a fine one, and there was not enough wind to make the stove smoke. So they had breakfast after all, and then began the work of making Camp Rest-a-While look as it had before the storm. A new tent pole was cut, and the tent put up again, stronger than before. Bunny and Sue helped by picking up the scattered pieces of tree branches, and piling them in a heap. Then they swept up the torn-off leaves, and by this time the sun had dried up some of the puddles of water. By noon time the camp looked as well as it had before the storm. "And don't forget to fix the hole over my cot," cried Bunny. "I don't want to be rained on any more, Daddy." "I'll fix it," said Mr. Brown, and he did. "I didn't hear any fire engines last night," said Tom Vine as they sat at supper that evening, after coming in from a little sail around the lake, Bunker having fixed a sail onto the rowboat. "Fire engines!" exclaimed Bunny. "Why should you hear fire engines, Tom?" "Why, in the city, where I lived, before I went with that farmer, the fire engines used to come out after every storm. Places would be struck by lightning, you know. I've seen lots of fires. But I didn't hear any engines last night." "There aren't any engines in these woods," said Daddy Brown. "Of course trees are often struck by lightning, and lightning often sets fire to houses in the country, but there aren't any engines out in the woods." "And no policeman, either," added Tom. "It seems funny not to see a policeman, and have him yell at you to move on, or keep off the grass." "Do you like it better here than in the city?" asked Mrs. Brown. "Oh, heaps better, yes'm! I love it here. I hope I don't ever have to go back to the city--or to that mean farmer." Nothing had been seen of the man who wanted to get Tom back, since that day when he had called at the camp. Bunny and Sue had almost forgotten him, but it seemed that Tom had not. He was always a little bit afraid, thinking that the cross man might come back. One morning, two days after the big storm, when Bunny, Sue and all the others were gathered around the breakfast table, Daddy Brown asked: "Where is Tom Vine?" "He was here a minute ago," Bunny said. "I think he went to the spring to get a pail of water," put in Uncle Tad. "Yes, that's where he went," said Mrs. Brown. "I said we would need some fresh water, and he went after it." "Well, we won't wait for him," said Daddy Brown. "We'll eat, and he can have his breakfast when he comes." But the others had finished breakfast, and Tom Vine had not come back from the spring, though they waited for some time. "I wonder what's keeping him," said Mrs. Brown. "He couldn't have fallen in; could he?" asked Uncle Tad. "No, the spring isn't large enough," Bunker Blue answered. "I'll go to look for him." Bunker ran off along the path that led to the spring. In a little while he came hurrying back. He carried a pail full of water, and he said: "I found the empty pail by the spring, but Tom was gone!" CHAPTER XV LOOKING FOR TOM Bunker Blue, with the pail of water, walked up to where Bunny, Sue and the others were still sitting at the breakfast table, though they had finished eating. "Tom's gone," said Bunker again. "Gone where?" asked Bunny. "I don't know," answered the red-haired boy. "I looked all around by the spring, but I couldn't see him. The pail was there, but Tom wasn't." "Could he have fallen in?" asked Mrs. Brown, just as Uncle Tad had asked. Bunker Blue shook his head. "The spring is only about big enough to dip a pail in," he said, "and Tom is bigger than the pail." "But maybe he curled all up in a little heap when he fell in," said Bunny. "Oh, dear! I don't want Tom to be lost!" Bunny and Sue had grown to like Tom very much. Once more Bunker Blue shook his head. "I could look right down to the bottom of the spring," he said. "It's quite deep, even if it isn't big. But Tom wasn't in it. There was a big bullfrog in the water, though." "Was the frog big enough to--to eat Tom?" asked Sue, her eyes wide open. Sue's mother and father laughed, and Bunny said: "A bullfrog couldn't eat anybody!" "They could if they was a big enough frog; couldn't they, Daddy?" asked Sue. "Well, I don't know," replied Mr. Brown. "Then you couldn't see anything of Tom, Bunker?" "No, sir, not a thing." "Had he filled the pail with water?" Uncle Tad wanted to know. "The pail was empty, and it was tipped over," Bunker said. "I don't know whether Tom had filled it, and then something had knocked it over, or not. Anyhow, the pail had no water in it, so I dipped it into the spring to fill it, and came on back to tell you." "That was right," said Mr. Brown. "We'll go over and look around. Tom may have seen some new kind of bird, or something like that, and have wandered off in the woods, following it." "Maybe he saw a bear, and ran," suggested Bunny. "No, I guess the only bear around here is the tame one that came in our tent the first night," said Mrs. Brown. "Oh, I do hope nothing has happened to Tom!" They all hoped that, for the strange boy was very well liked. Mrs. Brown remained at the tent to wash the breakfast dishes, since Tom was not there to do them, while the others--Bunny, Sue, their father, Uncle Tad and Bunker--went to the spring. It was on the side of a little hill, where grew many trees, and was about three minutes' walk from Camp Rest-a-While. Mr. Brown and Uncle Tad looked all around the hole in the ground--the hole was the spring, and it was filled with clear, cold water. The bottom of the spring was of white sand, and sitting down there, having a nice bath, was a big, green bullfrog. With his funny eyes he looked up at Bunny and Sue as they leaned over the spring. "Oh, look!" cried Sue. "What a big frog!" "But he isn't big enough to swallow Tom," said Bunny. "No, that's so," agreed Mr. Brown. "We'll have to look for Tom. Bunny and Sue, you stay with me. Uncle Tad, you and Bunker walk around in the woods. It may be that Tom fell and hurt himself, when running after a bird or butterfly, and can't walk. We'll find him." Tom, having lived all his life in the city, thought the birds and butterflies were most wonderful creatures. Every time he saw a new one he would run up to it to get a close look. He never tried to catch them, he just wanted to watch them fluttering about the flowers. But, though they looked all around in the woods by the spring, there was no sign of Tom. Up and down, back and forth, they walked, looking beside big rocks or stumps, behind fallen logs and under clumps of bushes they peered, but no Tom could they find. "Oh, he's losted, just like we was losted," said Sue, sadly. "Yes, I guess he is," agreed Bunny. "Splash, can't you find Tom?" The big dog barked: "Bow-wow!" But what he meant by that no one knew. Splash, however, could not find Tom. "Let's call his name," said Uncle Tad. So they called his name. "Tom! Tom! Tom Vine! Where are you?" But Tom did not answer. "This is queer," said Mr. Brown. "I don't believe he'd run away and leave us. He liked it too much at our camp." "Perhaps he saw that mean man," said Bunker Blue. "Tom may have seen the cross farmer who wanted him to come back to work, and Tom may have run away off and hid--so far off that he can't hear us calling." "Yes, that's so. He _may_ have done that," agreed Mr. Brown. "We'll go back to camp, and wait for him. He may come when he thinks the man has gone away." Back to camp they all went. Bunny and Sue felt bad about Tom's being lost. So did the others. Every time Splash would stop in front of a clump of bushes, and bark, as he often did, Bunny and Sue would run up, thinking their friend had been found. But it would be only a bird, a rabbit or a squirrel that Splash had seen, which made him bark that way. Tom was not to be found. They waited in camp all the rest of that day, only going out a little way for a row on the lake. Night came, and there was no Tom. It grew very dark, and still he had not come. "Oh, dear!" cried Sue. "Will he have to sleep out alone all night?" "Perhaps he'll come back before you are awake in the morning," said Mother Brown. "Anyhow, Tom isn't afraid of the dark, and it is now so warm that anyone could sleep out of doors and not get cold. I think Tom will be here in the morning." But morning came, and there was no sign of Tom. A lantern had been left burning outside the tent all night, in case he should come. But he did not. "Well," said Mr. Brown, after breakfast, "there's only one thing to do, and I'm going to do it." "What is that?" asked his wife. "I'm going over to Farmer Trimble's, to see if Tom is there." "Oh, Trimble is the name of the man who wanted to take Tom away; isn't it?" "Yes, that's the man who came here, and tried to get Tom. It may be that Mr. Trimble saw Tom at the spring, getting water, and made him go away. So I'm going over to the Trimble farm, and see." "Oh, may we come?" asked Bunny. "Yes," said Mr. Brown. "I guess so. I'll take you and Bunker Blue with me. And if we find Tom we'll bring him back with us. That man has no right to keep him!" CHAPTER XVI "WHO TOOK THE PIE?" The shortest way to go to the Trimble farm was to row across the lake in the boat, and then to walk a little distance through the wood. Mr. Brown, with Bunny and Sue, started, with Bunker Blue at the oars, dipping them in the water, pulling hard on them, and lifting them out for another dip. "Don't row too hard, Bunker," said Mr. Brown. "It is a hot day, and I don't want you to get tired out. Besides, we are in no hurry, so take it easy." At the last minute, Splash, the dog, had run down the hill to the lake, and climbed into the boat. He did not want to be left behind. "May we take him, Daddy?" asked Bunny. "Oh, yes. Let him come along. He's a good dog, and maybe he can help us find Tom." Splash was a regular water-dog. He could swim across the lake, he could jump in and bring back sticks that Bunny or Sue would toss in, and he liked to be in a boat. Splash knew that dogs, as well as boys and girls, must keep quiet in boats, especially small boats, so they would not tip over. And now Splash perched himself up in the bow, or front part of the boat, and quietly sat there, looking across at the other shore. Bunny looked down over the side, where he was sitting, and saw some fish swimming about, for the water of the lake was very clear. "I wish I had brought my fishpole," Bunny said. "I could catch some fish for dinner." "We've something else to do besides catching fish to-day, Bunny," replied his father. "We've got to find Tom Vine." "Do you think we'll find him, Daddy?" asked Sue, as she hugged one of her dolls, which she had brought with her. "Well, maybe so, little girl. I can't think of anything else that would happen to Tom, except that he would be taken by Mr. Trimble. I think we'll find him." They were half way across the lake when Sue suddenly cried: "Oh, there she goes! Oh, she's fallen in!" "What is it?" asked Mr. Brown, turning around quickly, for he was seated with his back toward his little girl. "It's my doll!" Sue cried. "She jumped right out of my arms, and fell in the lake." I guess Sue meant that her doll slipped out of her arms, for dolls can't jump--at least not unless they have a spring wound up inside them, like an alarm clock, and Sue's doll wasn't that kind. "Stop the boat, Bunker! Row back!" cried Mr. Brown. "Sue's doll fell overboard, and we don't want to lose her!" Bunker stopped rowing, and he was reaching out with an oar to pull in the doll, which was floating like a little boat on top of the water, not far away. But before Bunker could save the doll, Splash, with a loud bark, jumped in and swam out toward the plaything of his little mistress. Seizing the doll in his mouth, Splash swam back with her to the boat. Bunny stretched out his hand to take the doll, but Splash would not give it up to him. The dog knew that boys don't play with dolls, and that this one belonged to Sue. So Splash swam around to the other side of the boat where Sue was anxiously waiting, and he let her take the doll from his mouth. "Good dog!" cried Sue, patting him with one hand. Then she began to squeeze the water out of her doll's dress. "I'm glad I didn't bring my best doll," said Sue. "This is only one of my old ones, and it won't hurt her to get wet. I was going to give her a bath, anyhow, but I didn't mean to leave her clothes on. Anyhow, she'll soon dry, I guess." Sue put the doll down beside her, on the seat, where the hot sun would dry up the water. Splash put his two paws on the edge of the boat, and Mr. Brown and Bunker Blue helped him in. "Now you be quiet, Splash!" called Mr. Brown. "Don't go shaking the water off yourself, as you always do when you come in from a swim. For we can't get far enough away from you in the boat, and you'll get us all wet. Don't shake yourself!" I don't know whether or took with him Louis XVI’s personal gift—the King’s miniature, set with 408 diamonds. The whole population of Passy watched him leave, silent except for occasional outbursts of sobs. “All the days of my life I shall remember that a great man, a sage, wished to be my friend,” wrote Madame Brillon just before his departure. A farewell note from Madame Helvétius was waiting for him at Havre: “I see you in your litter, every step taking you further from us, lost to me and all my friends who love you so much and to whom you leave such long regrets.” He and his grandsons spent four days at Southampton, England. William Franklin came down from London, where he was now living, to see them, but the meeting with his father was brief and strained. Then Benjamin Franklin set off for his eighth crossing of the Atlantic. He knew it would be his last. 17 THE CLOSING YEARS Never had America given a returning hero a more resounding welcome. Booming cannons announced his landing on September 14, 1785, at Philadelphia’s Market Street wharf. Bells rang throughout the city and the whole town was out to greet him. Cheering crowds lined the street as his carriage proceeded to his home at Franklin Court, where Sally and his grandchildren, eight now in all, were waiting for him. Ceremonies in his honor continued for weeks. Old and feeble and almost constantly in pain, he was still not allowed to relax. On October 11, he was made president of the Supreme Executive Council of the Pennsylvania Assembly—an Assembly which would never again have to pay heed to “the proprietors.” On October 29, two weeks later, he was elected president of Pennsylvania. To avoid the agony of riding in a carriage, he had a sedan chair built, so he could be carried to meetings. His eightieth birthday, January 6, 1786, was celebrated at the Bunch of Grapes Tavern by Philadelphia’s now numerous printers. They drank their first toast to their “venerable printer, philosopher, and statesman.” At least once in this period George Washington came to dinner with him. One pleasant afternoon and evening he spent with Thomas Paine, now one of America’s most distinguished citizens; together they worked on inventing a “smokeless candle.” For a while, Franklin kept in his garden a model of an iron bridge which Paine had invented and which attracted droves of curious visitors. He tried vainly to secure a post for Temple, but Congress was still doubtful about him. Later he bought the young man a farm at Rancocas, New Jersey. Temple liked farm life so little he spent most of his time in Philadelphia. For Benjamin Bache he set up a printing press and type foundry, which the youth managed contentedly until at the age of thirty an attack of yellow fever brought his life to a premature end. In July 1786, an Indian chief of the Wyandots, named Scotosh, came to Franklin with a message from his people, bringing strings of white wampum. Franklin received him with the same courtesy due any ambassador. Following the Indian custom, he waited two days to consider the chief’s message, then presented more strings of wampum with his reply. In the Pennsylvania Assembly, that September, he helped revise the penal code. No longer were men to be hanged for robbery, arson, or counterfeiting. By the new act only murder and treason warranted capital punishment. Branding with a hot iron, flogging, the pillory were all abolished. Such barbarities did not belong in a new nation. He was pleased with signs of progress and quick recovery from war. “Our working-people are all employed and get high wages, are well fed and well clad,” he wrote in November. “Buildings in Philadelphia increase rapidly, besides small towns rising in every quarter of the country. The laws govern, justice is well administered, and property is as secure as in any country in the globe.... In short, all among us may be happy who have happy dispositions; such being necessary to happiness even in paradise.” But all was not yet honey and roses in the new United States, as he soon discovered. Much trouble had risen because of the lack of power of the Confederacy. Under the Articles of the Confederation, Congress might declare war, but could not enlist a single soldier. Congress could ask the states for money, but had no authority to raise a dollar by taxation. It could make treaties but could not force the states to recognize them. It could not regulate commerce and each state taxed imports as it wished. Not only the Confederacy, but all the states issued their own money, resulting in endless confusion. To create a strong central government, the Constitutional Convention opened on May 25, 1787, at the Philadelphia State House, in the same room where the Declaration of Independence had been signed. Franklin, who was the oldest delegate here, as he had been at the Second Continental Congress, expressed the hope that good would come from the Convention: “Indeed if it does not do good it must do harm, as it will show that we have not wisdom enough among us to govern ourselves.” There were fifty-five delegates in all, the best minds in America. George Washington was the natural choice as presiding officer. All that hot summer they labored on the task of making a workable constitution. Franklin did not miss a meeting in the four months. As always, he said little. When he had a speech to make, he wrote it out in advance and let James Wilson, or some other delegate, read it for him. He could no longer stand to deliver an address without pain. In the course of the sessions he advocated three ideas—a single legislature, a plural executive, the nonpayment of officers. All three were rejected. He accepted the defeat without rancor. His main role was as a peacemaker. In case of an impasse, as was inevitable with so many contrary views and opinions, it was invariably he who suggested a workable compromise. Once, when feelings were taut to the point of hostility, he moved that the Convention open its sessions with prayer: “I have lived a long time, and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth: that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid?” His motion was received with respect but no action was taken on it. Perhaps he guessed there would be none. Whether he planned it or not, his proposal had the effect of cooling hot tempers, and work continued with less dissension. The final day of the Convention was Monday, September 17. The great document, which was the fruit of their heavy labor, was read by the secretary. Then James Wilson gave Franklin’s comments: I confess that there are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them; for, having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration to change my opinions.... In these sentiments, sir, I agree to this Constitution with all its faults, if there are such; because I think a general government necessary for us, and there is no form of government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered.... Thus I consent, sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better, and because I am not sure that it is not the best.... Then Franklin moved that the Constitution be signed by the delegates as “done in Convention by the unanimous consent of the states present.” While the last delegates were affixing their signature, Franklin’s eyes were on the president’s chair, on the back of which a sunset—or sunrise—was painted. To those near him he said, “I have often and often in the course of the session ... looked at that sun behind the president without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting. But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun.” In the year of the Convention, the Massachusetts delegate, Elbridge Gerry, called on Franklin, bringing a friend named Manasseh Cutler. Later Cutler wrote down his recollections of this first meeting with the philosopher-statesman. He was sitting hatless under a mulberry tree in his garden, “a short, fat, trunched old man in a plain Quaker dress, bald pate, and short white locks.” Present were several men and women, one of whom was Sarah Bache. When Cutler was introduced, Franklin rose, took him by the hand, expressed his joy at seeing him, and begged him to be seated by his side. He spoke in a low voice and his “countenance was open, frank, and pleasing.” Sarah Bache served tea under the tree. She had three of her younger children with her, who “seemed to be excessively fond of their grandpapa.” They talked until dark when Franklin took his guests into his study, “a very large chamber and high-studded.” The walls were lined with bookshelves and there were more books in four alcoves extending two-thirds of the length of the room. Cutler guessed rightly that this was “the largest and by far the best private library in America.” Their host showed them a sort of artificial arm—a long pole with prongs at the end that could be opened or shut with a rope, which he had devised to take down and put up books on the upper shelves. (Previously he had used a chair which could be unfolded into a ladder, but now he was not sufficiently agile.) He had other curiosities in the room, such as a glass machine for “exhibiting the circulation of the blood in the arteries and veins of the human body” and his rocking armchair, with a fan placed over it which he could operate by a small motion of his foot. Because Cutler was a botanist, Franklin showed him a precious folio containing _Systema Vegetabilium_, by Linnaeus, the founder of systematic botany. Heavy as the folio was, Franklin insisted on lifting it himself, and to Cutler he expressed regret that he had not in his youth given more attention to the science of botany. They discussed many other matters and Cutler was astonished at Franklin’s extensive knowledge, “the brightness of his memory, and clearness and vivacity of all his mental faculties, notwithstanding his age,” and at the “incessant vein of humour ... which seems as natural and involuntary as his breathing.” But his age was catching up with Benjamin Franklin, as no one realized better than he. In February 1788, he fell on the stone steps that led into his garden, bruising himself badly and spraining his wrist, so that temporarily he could not even write to his friends. The accident was followed by a severe attack of his kidney stone ailment. He was still confined to bed when Pennsylvania celebrated gloriously its twelfth Fourth of July. The Pennsylvania Council held meetings at his house during his illness, and in October, Thomas Mifflin, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, was elected to succeed him. To quiet the anxiety of his sister in Boston, Jane Mecom, he wrote, “There are in life real evils enough, and it is a folly to afflict ourselves with imaginary ones.... As to the pain I suffer, about which you make yourself so unhappy, it is, when compared with the long life I have enjoyed of health and ease, but a trifle.” He made his will that summer of 1788. In a codicil, he bequeathed to “my friend, and the friend of mankind, General Washington,” the walking stick with the gold head in the shape of a cap of liberty, which had been given him in France as a symbol of victory. Congress was now allotting many pensions and bonuses to patriots who had sacrificed their personal interests to serve in the cause of freedom. Franklin had hoped that his many years of foreign service might be thought worthy of a grant of a tract of land in the West “which might have been of some use and some honour to my posterity.” This was never given him. Arthur Lee, who had been notably jealous of Franklin and who had written him vitriolic letters in France accusing him of leaving him out of things, was a member of the Treasury Board. He had never forgotten or forgiven Franklin for being the better man. John Adams was finding ears to listen to his long-standing disapproval of Franklin’s “frivolity.” He was being criticized for being too fond of France, as he had once been censored for his attachment to England, and especially for accepting as a gift the King of France’s miniature. There was also a matter of a million livres given by France to the dummy importing concern, Hortalez and Company, which was unaccounted for. Franklin was condemned by innuendo, though time would clear him completely. He was sorrowful about this turn of affairs but he blamed nobody. He knew something of the “nature of such changeable assemblies,” he wrote a friend, “and how little successors are informed of services that have been rendered to the corps before their admission.” Once more he had turned to working on his _Autobiography_, commenced years before at the Shipley home in England. For six months off and on he kept at it, even while his kidney stone was causing him such acute pain he had to resort to opium. He brought his life story up to the time of his first meetings with the Penn brothers in England. It remained unfinished. By the summer of 1789 he was so emaciated that, in his words, “little remains of me but a skeleton covered with a skin,” and philosophic as always, commented, “In this world, nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes,” tossing off another epigram that would survive. The long fermenting discontent of the French working classes exploded in the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. Franklin seems not to have realized the extent of the misery in France during his stay there. Most of his intimate friends had been wealthy, or at least well-to-do. His own life had been so idyllic he had come to think of his foster country almost as a utopia. Moreover, he was deeply grateful to the French King for his generosity to America. But his belief in the rights of the common man was firm and if the people of France felt they needed a change, he was with them. When rumors of their Revolution reached him, he wrote, “Disagreeable circumstances might attend the convulsions in France ... but if by the struggle she obtains and secures for her nation its future liberty, and a good constitution, a few years’ enjoyment of those blessings will amply repair all the damages their acquisition may have occasioned.” Since 1787 he had been president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery, founded by the Quakers, and his signature was on a memorial which the society sent to Congress on February 12, 1790, advocating the abolition of slavery. Congress dismissed the memorial on the grounds that it had no authority to interfere in the internal affairs of the states. Whereupon Franklin promptly published an essay, “On the Slave Trade,” in which a mythical Algerian, Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim, used the same arguments as the Negro slave owners to defend his right to Christian slaves! The piece showed the same barbs of wit and satire as his earlier writings. His campaign against slavery was his last public activity. His pain now kept him bedridden, but he did some work, using Benjamin Bache as his secretary, and he found the energy to listen to his nine-year-old granddaughter Deborah recite lessons from her Webster spelling book. In March, Thomas Jefferson, on his way to accept his post as Secretary of State under President George Washington, came to see him, and on April 8, he wrote Jefferson his last letter, a clear account of the map which he and the other peace commissioners used in fixing the boundary between Maine and Nova Scotia. He was now running a high temperature. Breathing became so difficult that he nearly suffocated. When, briefly, he felt a little better, he rose from his bed, begging that it might be made up fresh for him so he could die in a decent manner. His daughter Sally told him she hoped he would recover and live many years longer. “I hope not,” he said calmly. They put him back to bed and his physician advised him to change his position so he could breathe more easily. “A dying man can do nothing easy,” he commented. Soon afterwards he fell in a coma. Temple and Benjamin Bache, his grandsons, were alone with him when, on April 17, 1790, at the age of eighty-four and three months, the end came. His death brought an abrupt halt to the petty recriminations that had saddened his last months. In Philadelphia, the city that had grown up with him and because of him, muffled bells tolled, and flags on the ships in the harbor hung at half mast. Some 20,000 attended his funeral, the greatest number the city had ever seen gathered in one spot. As he was lowered into his grave in the Christ Church burying ground beside his wife, a company of militia artillery fired funeral guns in honor of the man who had organized Pennsylvania’s first militia. In New York, by a motion passed unanimously, the United States House of Representatives voted to wear mourning for a month. Neither the Senate nor the Executive Council followed the example of the House. Ironically, the man chosen to pronounce his funeral eulogy at the Lutheran German Church in Philadelphia was William Smith, his ancient enemy. Although Smith did not do him justice, the crowd before the pulpit sobbed openly. But it was in France, his adopted country, where the expressions of grief and loss were most tumultuous. The National Assembly proclaimed a period of three months of national mourning for the “benefactor and hero of humanity.” “Antiquity would have raised altars to this mighty genius,” cried the revolutionary leader Mirabeau. Splendid orations in his honor were delivered by the Jacobins, the Friends of the Constitution, the Academy of Science, the Royal Society of Medicine, the National Guard, the Masonic lodges, the printers of France, and uncounted other societies. All over the country, women wept for him. It is said that one enterprising businessman became rich by selling statuettes of him, made from the stones of the Bastille. Franklin’s contributions to his country, to science, to better understanding between nations and peoples were immense. His maxims on thrift and moral virtues have been extolled to generations of school children. His wit and wisdom have added to the world’s riches. He was many men in one—statesman, scientist, inventor, writer, humorist, philosopher, and a friend of humanity who shared himself with all around him. “Who that know and love you can bear the thoughts of surviving you in this gloomy world?” cried out Jane Mecom, his beloved sister, shortly before his death. Posterity would provide her answer. Because Benjamin Franklin lived and enjoyed life, the world would be a little less gloomy and a little more pleasant for all who came after him.

He was in his long lifetime, writer, editor and publisher, scientist and inventor, propagandist for the cause of the American colonies, statesman, diplomat.

BENNIE AND THE TIGER. [Illustration] LONDON: DEAN & SON. 11, Ludgate Hill. 14 BENNIE AND THE TIGER. [Illustration] A fair little English boy lay sleeping in the shady verandah of his Indian home. The servant who was left with him was unfaithful to her trust, and, while he slept, wandered away in search of pleasure. A treacherous tiger, prowling in search of a pig or a lamb for his supper, finding the village very quiet, ventured in among the dwellings. The English gentlemen were all absent, and most of the natives were at work in the rice swamp or the paddy field; while the white ladies, exhausted with heat, were taking their rest, little dreaming how careless were their nurses. [Illustration] The treacherous tiger crept noiselessly past the deserted homes, until he espied the sweet little sleeper. Then, with one bound, he sprang upon him, grasped the flowing white robe in his teeth, and darted off to his native jungle. Having secured the prize, he laid him down; and as a kitten plays with the captive mouse, began sporting with him. He walked round and round, layed first one paw and then the other on the little plump feet, and looked into his beautiful face as if his ferocious heart was almost melted by its sweetness. There was a brave heart in little Bennie, for he seemed not at all alarmed by his strange companion. He was well used to Negro, the large black house dog; the ponies were his chief favourites; and he felt inclined to look on the tiger, perhaps, as an addition to his circle of dumb friends. Or, if the glance of these fiery eyeballs, and the display of these dreadful teeth, made his heart beat for a moment, he only returned the gaze, saying in baby language: “I’m not afraid of you, for I’ve got a father! You can’t touch Bennie—Bennie’s got a mamma!” Oh, how strong this trust in earthly love made that frail boy! Why will not those who know that God is over all, confide in him in times of danger, and be at rest! [Illustration] All this time the boy’s mother slept, nor dreamed of danger to her darling. The truant nurse, missing her little charge, flew from house to house in search of him. But the Eye which never sleeps was on him. An aged native had heard the low growl of satisfaction, which to his practised ear, told that a tiger had seized his prey. Taking his carbine, he followed on his trail, and secreted himself noiselessly behind the bushes. He watched his opportunity to fire, trembling less the charge meant for the tiger might kill the boy. He took his aim and fired. The tiger ran a few steps toward the jungle, then staggered and fell dead within a few yards of the little captive. Do you think that his mother could ever forget the kind old native? Could she ever forget God, who saved her darling from so terrible a death? There is an enemy more dangerous than any beast of the forest, who seeks to destroy both soul and body—Satan, whom the Scripture calls a “roaring lion.” He has many servants, who watch like the tiger for their prey, ready to spring upon unguarded youth. God has warned us against these spiritual foes, and promised His protection to all that trust in Him. [Illustration] THE DEAD BROTHER. [Illustration] I am all alone in my chamber now, And the midnight hour is near; And the faggot’s crack and the clock’s dull tick Are the only sounds I hear. And o’er my soul, in its solitude, Sweet feelings of sadness glide, For my heart and my eyes are full when I think Of the little boy that died. I went one night to my father’s house— Went home to the dear ones all— And softly I opened the garden gate, And softly the door of the hall. My mother came out to meet her son— She kissed me, and then she sighed, And her head fell on my neck, and she wept For the little boy that died. I shall miss him when the flowers come, In the garden where he played; I shall miss him more by the fireside, When the flowers have all decayed. I shall see his toys and his empty chair, And the horse he used to ride; And they will speak with a silent speech, Of the little boy that died. We shall go home to our Father’s house— To our Father’s house in the skies, Where the hopes of our souls shall have no blight, Or love no broken ties. We shall roam on the banks of the river of peace, And bathe in its blissful tide; And one of our joys of heaven shall be The little boy that died. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES 1.

She’s a bargain.” “Sort of――worn out, isn’t it?” asked Tom, moving around to a new point of view. “N-no, there’s life in her yet, I guess. ’Course she needs overhauling, as you might say, and some paint. But she’s got four whole cylinders, a good set of gears an’――an’ some other things. No, she ain’t as bad as she looks. If you hear of anyone looking for a bargain in a five-seat, twenty-two-horsepower automobile, you tell ’em to come and see me, son.” “What do you want for her?” asked Tom. The carriage dealer looked at him shrewdly, kicked one worn and tattered tire as if to satisfy himself that it wouldn’t come to pieces, and replied: “A hundred and fifty dollars takes her just as she stands, with top, side curtains, top cover an’――an’ I think there’s a jack under the hind seat.” “I dare say that’s reasonable,” replied Tom doubtfully, “but I guess it would take a lot to put that car in running shape, wouldn’t it?” The dealer shrugged his shoulders. “I reckon fifty dollars would make a new car out of her, son. A coat of paint would make a whole pile of difference in her looks, anyway, and I’d paint her and varnish her for――let me see now; well, for thirty dollars. And that’s twenty dollars cheaper than anyone else would do it for. Better think it over.” “I’m afraid I couldn’t buy her,” laughed Tom. “I haven’t got that much money.” “Well, I didn’t suppose you had, but maybe your father would buy it for you. Ain’t you John Benton’s son? Ain’t Postmaster Benton your daddy?” “Yes, sir, but I guess he isn’t buying automobiles just now. If I hear of anyone wanting one, though, I’ll tell them about this one. Want me to help you run it inside?” “Yes, you might take a wheel over there. Wait till I put the brake off. Now, then! Heave-o! That’s the ticket. Easy! Look out for them hubs on that surrey. All right. Much obliged to you. Tell you what I’ll do, son; if you send a buyer for her, I’ll make you a present of ten dollars. That’s fair, eh? You tell folks she’s a bargain. She is, too. I reckon I could get three hundred for her in the city. I took her in trade from a man over to Graywich. Why, that car cost thirteen hundred dollars when she was new!” “I guess that was a long time ago, wasn’t it?” hazarded Tom. “Humph! About three years, if the man told the truth. That ain’t old, though, for an automobile. I was reading the other day about an automobile that had been run twelve years and was as good as new!” “Will this one run now?” Tom asked. “She might if she had some gasoline in her. Mind, I ain’t saying she would, for I ain’t tried her. I wouldn’t know how. I never ran one of the things in my life. But the man I took her from says she’ll run, an’ I’ll take his word for it till I find out different. Anyway, she’s all there; there ain’t no parts missing. You can tell ’em that, son.” “Yes, sir; I will.” Tom rescued his books, which he had laid aside, and, with a final look at the automobile, left Saunders’ Carriage Works and took up his homeward journey again. It was the first week in June, and the afternoon was warm and almost summer-like. There was a lazy quality in the air, which, possibly, explains why Tom had taken twenty minutes to get from the high school to Saunders’ Carriage Works and why the sight of a decrepit-looking automobile standing in front of the works had caused him to pause and waste another ten minutes. He had left school with the intention of going out to the field, after leaving his books at home and making a raid on the pantry, to watch the high school team practice baseball. Now, however, baseball practice had passed out of his mind. He was thinking of that old automobile back there. He knew very well what he would do with a hundred and fifty dollars if he had it! He would buy that car, fix it up so it would run and make money with it! He needed money, too. He had already made up his mind to find work of some kind as soon as school was over, and so far the best thing that had offered was a position at four dollars a week in the Audelsville Paper Mill. Tom was convinced that his services ought to be worth more than that stipend, and, if a more remunerative position could be found, the paper mill was not likely to see him. Tom’s father was postmaster at Audelsville, but the salary was barely enough to provide for a family of three. It had long been a settled matter that a college education for Tom was beyond the possibilities, and that so soon as he had graduated from the high school he was to go to work. There was still another year of schooling ahead, however, and Tom, who needed clothes pretty badly nowadays, owing to an unfortunate but quite natural proclivity for outgrowing his garments, didn’t see why it was necessary to complete his education before beginning to earn money. And if he owned that automobile――Tom sighed as he pushed open the gate and went up the short path to the house. The pantry didn’t offer much in the way of variety to-day, but Tom selected four doughnuts and a banana, and went out to the porch. There he seated himself on the top step, and set to with a good appetite. He had finished the second doughnut when the sound of whistling behind the row of overgrown lilacs along the fence reached him. Tom craned his neck, for the whistling sounded like the musical efforts of Willard Morris. Tom was not mistaken. The smiling face of Willard appeared over the gate. “Hello, Tom!” greeted Willard. “Going out to the field?” “I guess so. Come on in and have a doughnut.” Nothing loth, Willard accepted the invitation, and a moment later was perched at Tom’s side, and was setting his teeth into one of Mrs. Benton’s doughnuts. Willard was a good-looking youth of seventeen, large and broad-shouldered, with nice eyes, and a pleasant, likable face. He was Tom’s senior by a full year, and was in the class ahead of him at high school. But, in spite of that, the boys were very good friends. While Willard’s father was no better off than Tom’s, Willard himself had lately come into a small legacy from a grandmother who had died, and he was to start in college in the fall――a piece of good fortune that Tom certainly envied him. “I wish,” announced Tom presently, after they had talked school affairs for a few minutes, “I wish I had a hundred and fifty dollars, Will.” “What for?” “An automobile.” Willard stared at him in surprise. “Gee,” he said, “you’re getting swell! I’d like to see the automobile you’d get for a hundred and fifty dollars, though, Tom!” “You can see it in five minutes. It’s at Saunders’ Carriage Works. It’s an old one, and I guess it’s in bad shape, but it could be fixed up all right. It’s cheap at a hundred and fifty, I guess.” “I guess most any automobile would be cheap at that figure if it could be made to go. What do you want it for, Tom? Can you run one?” “I’ve never tried, but anyone can run an automobile after learning how. I’ve been sitting here wondering if father would get it for me if I asked him. I guess he couldn’t afford it, though.” “Say, are you daffy?” demanded Willard. “Of course he won’t buy you an automobile! Besides, you’ve got a bicycle, haven’t you? Isn’t that good enough for you? It takes money to run an auto after you’ve got it, Tom.” “Oh, I don’t want it for――for pleasure. I want to make money with it, Will. And I could if I had it, too.” “How would you do it?” “Well――――” Tom hesitated a moment. Then, “You aren’t thinking of buying it yourself, are you?” he asked. “Not a bit!” laughed Willard. “Then I’ll tell you. You know when folks stop here in Audelsville, drummers and folks like that, they have to go pretty near twelve blocks to get to the hotel or the stores.” “I know the station’s a long way from the town,” acknowledged Willard. “I thought last Fall, after the Gordon Academy game, I’d never get home. I had a lame ankle and a stiff knee, and it seemed about two miles from the station to the house.” “That’s what I mean. Drummers always have bags and trunks, and they can’t walk to the hotel. So they take one of those rickety old hacks down there, or they wait for a car.” “They don’t if they’re in a hurry,” said Willard grimly. “The cars only run every half-hour or so.” “Twenty minutes; but they’re never there when a train comes in, and so the folks usually take one of Connors’ hacks. That costs them fifty cents apiece, and twenty-five cents for a trunk. Well, if I had that automobile, Will, I’d be down there when the trains come in, and I guess I’d do a good business. Most anyone would rather go to the hotel in an automobile than a hack. It’s quicker, in the first place, and then, besides, I’d take them up for a quarter.” “Why, say, that isn’t a bad idea! But old Connors would be mad, wouldn’t he? How many would your auto hold?” “Four, besides me,” answered Tom. “It would be big enough most times, I guess.” “But gasoline would cost you money, Tom; don’t forget that. And oil; and repairs. I don’t believe you’d make much at twenty-five cents apiece.” “I’ve figured I could clear about fifteen dollars a week,” replied Tom thoughtfully. “At that rate I could pay father for the car and have quite a little at the end of the summer. Then, if it proved a success, maybe I could find someone to drive it for me in the winter while I’m at school. But, there’s no use talking about it, I suppose, for I don’t believe father would give me the money.” “Maybe Saunders would sell on the installment plan,” Willard suggested. “Then you could pay him a little every week. Did you ask him?” Tom shook his head. “No; I didn’t really think seriously of it until afterward. He told me he’d give me ten dollars if I’d find someone to buy it from him. So I should think he’d sell it for a hundred and forty if he didn’t have to pay out any commission, eh?” “Shucks, Tom, he’d probably let you have it for a hundred and twenty-five. Where’d he get it, anyway?” So Tom told what little he knew of the car’s history, and Willard listened thoughtfully. “Well, I’ll tell you what I’d do, Tom,” he said finally. “If there was any chance of getting it, I’d find someone who knows about automobiles, and have him look it over. Then, if it wouldn’t cost too much to put it in shape, I’d offer Saunders a hundred and twenty-five for it. Tell him you’ll pay him, say, fifty dollars down, and so much a week. As for painting it, why, I don’t see why you couldn’t do that yourself. It isn’t hard to paint. I’ll help, if you like. And, I wouldn’t paint it black, either, because black shows all the dust and mud. Paint it――paint it gray, Tom.” “Yes, I guess that would be better. And I suppose I could do it myself, as you say. It would be rather fun, wouldn’t it? Gee, I wish my father would let me get it!” “Well, ask him. There’s no harm in that. I guess you could do pretty well with it, if you had it, Tom. What time is it? Let’s go out and watch those duffers practice for a while.” Mr. Benton listened gravely and interestedly that evening to Tom’s plan, but shook his head. “Tom,” he said finally, “I couldn’t find a hundred and twenty-five dollars for you right now to save my life. Maybe I could find fifty if Saunders would let you have the automobile for that much down, but it would be risky, I’m afraid. Suppose you didn’t make your scheme work, my boy? Then how would you meet your payments?” “I don’t see how it could help working, father,” replied Tom earnestly. “I guess there’s fully twenty to thirty folks going back and forth from the station every day.” “More, but they don’t all ride in hacks. Lots of them take the car and lots more walk.” “But they wouldn’t so many of them walk or take the car if they could get up to town quickly and comfortably in an automobile.” “Perhaps not. You can’t tell, though. Besides, I don’t know as I’d want to do anything to hurt Connors’ business, Tom. He’s been doing the station livery for a good many years now.” “There wouldn’t be anything to keep him from putting on an automobile, too, father, if he found I was getting the business away from him.” “But supposing he did? Then where would you be?” Tom was silent. Mr. Benton shook his head again. “I appreciate your wanting to make money, Tom,” he said kindly, “but I guess the best thing to do is to find some work somewhere and not risk any capital. A hundred and twenty-five dollars looks pretty big to your daddy these days!” CHAPTER II AND SO HAS WILLARD That ought to have settled the matter; but, although Tom, refusing comfort from his mother, went to bed telling himself that it was going to be the paper mill after all, somehow the next morning brought renewed hope. While he was dressing he tried to think of some way in which to get hold of that automobile, and, although he hadn’t succeeded by breakfast time, he nevertheless went downstairs to the morning meal in high spirits. There’s something about a fresh, dew-sprinkled June morning that makes a chap believe he can do almost anything if he tries hard enough! When Tom started out of the house he was surprised to see Willard Morris leaning over the gate. “I’ve been waiting for you,” announced Willard. “If we have time let’s stop and look at that buzz-wagon you were talking about yesterday. Will you?” “Yes; but I guess there isn’t much use, Will. I spoke to father, and he said he couldn’t afford it. At least, he says he couldn’t afford to pay a hundred and twenty-five. He might pay fifty, but he’s afraid I might not make a go of it.” “What did he say?” asked Willard. Tom narrated the conversation of the evening before, and Willard nodded once or twice, as he heard Mr. Benton’s objections. “Well, maybe he’s right, Tom. There isn’t any sure thing about it, and that’s so, but he loses sight of the fact that, even if the scheme didn’t work, you’d still have the automobile, and ought to get as much for it as you gave; that is, if it’s as good as you say it is. Anyway, we’ll look it over.” They did. Mr. Saunders was glad to have them see it, and expatiated on its merits for ten minutes, while Willard walked around it and viewed it carefully. “Was you thinking of buying it yourself?” asked Mr. Saunders. “Oh, I don’t know,” replied Willard. “Maybe. I’m sort of looking for a bargain in an automobile.” Tom stared at him in surprise. “But I think you’re asking a whole lot for this thing. Why, it would cost a hundred dollars, probably, to put that car in shape!” “What if it did? That would be only two hundred and fifty, and where could you get an automobile for that money?” “Two hundred and fifty?” repeated Willard. “Oh, I see; you’re figuring on getting a hundred and fifty for it.” He shook his head, and felt disparagingly of a worn tire. “I wouldn’t give that much. Maybe I’d offer you a hundred, but I’d want to have someone look over the engine first.” Mr. Saunders snorted with disgust. “A hundred! Why, that thing cost me two hundred in trade! A hundred! Pshaw! I’d sell her to the junkman first!” “Maybe that would be better,” said Willard agreeably. “Well, perhaps I’ll come in again. I’ll think it over. If I were you I’d have someone wash it so you could see what it was like underneath the dirt.” Mr. Saunders received the suggestion with a shrug, and the boys hurried out. “What did you mean by saying you were thinking of buying it?” asked Tom curiously. Willard shook his head. “I’ll tell you at noon,” he said. “There isn’t time now. We’ve got only three minutes to get to school. Wait for me at the east door at recess, Tom.” Tom’s lessons didn’t go very well that forenoon. Try as he might, he couldn’t get that automobile out of his head, and the schemes he evolved and abandoned to get possession of it were legion. After morning session he waited for Willard at the front entrance, and the two boys sought a quiet corner of the stone curbing about the high school grounds and opened their lunch-boxes. After Willard had taken the edge off his appetite by the consumption of three sandwiches and a slice of pie he consented to satisfy Tom’s curiosity. “My, but I was starved. I didn’t eat much breakfast, because I was afraid I’d miss you at your house, and I wanted to have a look at that car with you. You don’t think there’s much chance of your father buying it?” “I don’t believe there’s any chance,” replied Tom ruefully. “Is there any other way you know of that you can get the money?” “No, I wish there was!” “Well, all right,” and Willard began to peel and quarter an orange. “I spoke to my dad about that auto last night, Tom. You see, I got to thinking about it, after I left you, and it seemed to me like a pretty good idea. He said it sounded as though it might be a bargain, and he didn’t see why you couldn’t do pretty well bringing folks up from the station. We talked it all over, and――well, here’s my idea. See how you like it. You say you can’t get the money to buy it yourself. I don’t want to ‘butt in,’ Tom, but I’ve been thinking that perhaps you and I could go into the thing together, that is, if you don’t mind having a partner. Wait a minute! Now, suppose we get a man to look that car all over and tell us how much it would cost to put it in good shape. Dad knows of just the chap. His name is Brennan, and he works in the machine shop down by the railroad. Dad says he’d probably do it for us for a dollar. Then, if he says the car can be fixed up for――well, say, fifty dollars, we’ll go ahead. You get your father to put in fifty, and I’ll put in fifty. That’ll make a hundred. We’ll pay fifty dollars down to Saunders, and we’ll spend fifty in having it repaired and painted. We’ll do the painting ourselves. That will leave us in debt about a hundred dollars. If it’s necessary I’ll put in another fifty, but if it isn’t we’ll pay off what we owe in installments. As the idea was yours, and, as you’ll do the work, you’ll get two-thirds of what we make, and I’ll get one-third. What do you say?” “Why――but――can you do that?” exclaimed Tom. “Yes. You know I got some money from my grandmother’s estate last Fall. I’m to use it for college, but I won’t need it all, and, anyway, if this thing works out the way we expect it to, it will be a good investment. Of course, I wouldn’t want to risk more than a hundred, Tom; I couldn’t afford to. Maybe you think you ought to get more than two-thirds, but dad thought that was fair, and――――” “That part’s all right,” said Tom. “Seems to me you ought to have more than a third of the earnings, Will.” “No, because, you see, you’ll have to do the work. I’d help when I could, but I don’t know how to run a car, and I’ll be rather busy this summer, getting ready for college in the fall.” “Well, it’s a perfectly corking scheme,” said Tom, “but I’m terribly afraid that father won’t let me have the money. Perhaps, though, when I tell him that you’re going in with me, and think it’s all right, he may change his mind.” “You keep at him,” laughed Willard. “Of course, there won’t be much in it for us for a while, because we’ll have to pay Saunders. But we ought to get our money back, in time, at least. Then, if the thing works well, we’ll find someone to run the car while you’re in school in the winter. Why, maybe we’ll get so rich that we’ll be able to buy a real motor ’bus, Tom!” “Wouldn’t that be dandy!” said Tom softly. “I――I’m awfully much obliged to you, Will, and――――” “Oh, piffle! I’m going into it, as a――a business proposition, Tom. You don’t need to thank me. If I didn’t think I’d get my money back all right I wouldn’t think of it. Couldn’t afford to, Tom. You have a talk with your father as soon as you can, will you?” “Of course. I’ll stop in and see him at the shop after school.” “That’s the ticket. I wonder if it would help any if I went along, Tom?” “I wish you would. He’d think more of the scheme if you talked it up a little. Don’t you think so?” “He might. We’ll try it. I’ll meet you after school and go with you. If he says yes, we’ll go on down to the machine shop and find this chap Brennan. We’ve got to know what the thing will cost, first of all.” “And hadn’t we better stop and see Saunders right away, and get a――get the refusal of the automobile?” asked Tom uneasily. “Suppose someone else got ahead of us and bought it?” “I don’t believe there’s much danger of that,” said Willard; “but maybe we’d better be on the safe side. So we’ll stop in and see the old codger first thing.” “There isn’t time now, is there?” asked Tom, looking anxious. Willard looked at his silver watch and shook his head. “No, the bell will ring in four minutes. If we’d thought of it sooner――but I don’t believe anyone will get ahead of us. By the way, don’t you have to have a license to run an automobile?” “I don’t know. Do you?” “I think so. We’ll have to find out about that. How much do you suppose a license will cost?” Tom shook his head. “I don’t know. Where do you suppose we can find out?” “I guess dad knows. I’ll ask him this evening. I hope it doesn’t cost very much. A dog license costs three dollars, but I suppose that hasn’t anything to do with an automobile license. How long do you think it will take you to learn to run the thing, Tom?” “About a week, I guess,” replied Tom vaguely. “Of course, there’s lots to learn about the engine part of it, but I guess you don’t have to know all that at first. There’s the bell. I’ll meet you after school, Will. And――and don’t be late, will you? It would be fierce if we got there and found Saunders had sold the car!” But that fear proved vain when, five minutes after dismissal, the two boys reached the carriage works, rather anxious and quite breathless. The car was still there, looking, if anything, a trifle more dilapidated than before. Mr. Saunders had to be summoned from somewhere on the floor above, and, while they awaited him, they again looked over the car. It wasn’t a very commodious car. The rear seat was quite wide enough to take three passengers comfortably, but there was precious little leg room for them. “Not much room for bags,” commented Willard. “We could put them in front,” said Tom. “It wouldn’t be very often we’d get more than three passengers at a load. I wonder what kind of a car it is.” “Gasoline,” suggested Willard, with a laugh. “I mean what make. There ought to be a name on it somewhere.” But search failed to reveal any until Willard found some almost illegible lettering on a brass plate running along the edge of the front flooring. They finally deciphered it. “Treffry Motor Co.” was the legend. “Ever hear of a Treffry car?” asked Willard. “Yes, I think so. I wonder how old it is. Saunders says three years, but I’ll wager――――” He didn’t have time to state what he was willing to wager, however, for at that moment Mr. Saunders appeared on the scene. Willard acted as spokesman. “Back again, Mr. Saunders,” he announced carelessly. “So I see.” The carriage man didn’t seem overly glad to find him there, Tom thought. “Yes, I got to thinking it over, and I dropped in to make you an offer.” “All right; let’s hear it. I’m sort of busy this afternoon.” “Well, I want to have a man come up here and look the car over. If he says it can be repaired reasonably, I’ll pay you a hundred and twenty-five dollars for it, fifty dollars cash and the balance at the rate of twenty dollars a month.” “My terms was a hundred and fifty cash,” said Mr. Saunders. “Yes, but like as not you were expecting to pay ten or fifteen dollars’ commission to someone,” responded Willard cheerfully. “You won’t have to pay any commission, and that will save something.” “H-m; and what about interest?” “Interest?” “Sure; interest on the balance of seventy-five dollars you’d be owing me. It would be four months before I’d get the last of it.” “Oh, I see.” Willard looked doubtfully at Tom. “Well, I suppose interest at three per cent.――――” “Three per cent.! Jumpin’ Jupiter! The legal rate is five!” “Is it? On automobiles?” “On anything. I guess you don’t know a whole lot, after all, son. You want a fellow to come here and take the car to pieces?” “Well, look it over, you know.” “Yes, and leave it spread all over the place, like as not, so I’ll never be able to get it together again! Who you going to send here?” “A man named Brennan, who works――――” “Jimmy Brennan at the machine shop? I know him. Well, all right, but he’s got to put things together the way he finds ’em. You tell him that.” “I will, Mr. Saunders. Now will you give me a refusal of the car until I hear what Mr. Brennan says about it?” “I don’t know about that. I might miss a sale. How soon is he comin’, and when will you know whether you want to buy her or not?” “I’m going to try and get him to come to-morrow. Then just as soon as I hear what he says――――” “I’ll give you an option until this time to-morrow, and that’s the best I can do,” said Mr. Saunders with finality. “Take it, or leave it. A hundred and twenty-five isn’t enough, anyway, for an automobile like that. Why, that car cost, new, ’most fifteen hundred dollars, I guess!” “That isn’t very long,” said Willard, “but if it’s the best you’ll do, all right. Only I’m afraid Mr. Brennan is so busy――――” “Tell him to come this evening. I’ll give him the key if he will stop at my house. He knows where I live.” “Thanks. I’ll ask him to, then. Much obliged.” As they started out Mr. Saunders called Tom back. “Look here,” he whispered, “I agreed to give you ten dollars, son, but that was for selling her for a hundred and fifty. This fellow’s only going to pay a hundred and twenty-five, and not all cash, either. So I can’t give you more’n five dollars; understand?” “I don’t want any commission at all, thank you, Mr. Saunders,” replied Tom. “Oh!” Mr. Saunders looked relieved. “Well, that’s all right, then. Can this fellow pay the money? Who is he?” “He can pay, all right, Mr. Saunders. His name is Willard Morris. His father――――” “I know. All right.” “But why didn’t you take the five?” asked Willard, when Tom repeated the conversation outside. “Every dollar helps, you know.” a fast ship ready for me and tell no one." Then she returned and sat in the hut, and in the evening her husband returned and climbed in by that window of his. After a week had passed the husband took leave of his wife and went down to the harbour, got on board his ship and set sail for Zanzibar. [Illustration: Sailing boat] After he had gone, the wife came out quickly and went down to the harbour and got on board the vessel her mother had prepared for her and set sail behind him. In the middle of the ocean that boat of hers passed his. He looked at it and called out, "Who is that in the ship that is passing me?" She answered, "It is I, my name is Kitangatanga of the sea." She arrived at Zanzibar, moored her vessel and went ashore, and found that house where he stayed and entered it and sat down. Presently her husband arrived, moored his boat and went up to that house. When he saw that woman he was surprised and said to her, "How like you are to my wife whom I left in Kilwa!" So he talked to her for a while and then asked, "Are you married?" She replied, "No, I am a widow." Then he said, "If you will marry me I will settle on you a hundred reals." So that woman agreed, and they were married, and they stayed together. After two weeks he said to her, "My wife, I must continue my journey to Maskat now; but in the space of six months I will return and stay with you." She said, "It is well, my husband; go, and return in safety." So he got in his boat and set sail for Maskat. After he had gone she got in her boat and set sail behind him. In the middle of the sea her vessel passed his, and he called out, "Who is that who is passing me?" She replied, "It is I, Kitangatanga of the sea." She arrived first in Maskat and found that house where he stopped and went and sat in it. Presently her husband arrived, moored his ship and went up to the house. When he saw that woman sitting there he was very surprised and said, "How like you are to my wife whom I left in Kilwa, and also to that woman I married in Zanzibar." Then he asked her, "Are you married?" She replied, "No, I am a widow." So he said, "I will marry you for one hundred reals." She agreed, and they were married, and he stayed with her six months there in Maskat. At the end of that time he said, "My wife, I must now return home. I will stay a year, and then I will return to you." She said, "Go, and return in peace, my husband." So he set sail from Maskat, and that woman set sail after him. In the midst of the ocean she passed him again, and when he asked who it was, she replied, "It is I, Kitangatanga of the sea." She arrived at Zanzibar and went up to that house. Presently her husband arrived, and she said, "Welcome, stranger; what is the news?" He replied, "The news is that I have made a prosperous journey to Maskat, and that there I met a woman just like the wife I left at Kilwa and also like you, and I married her." She replied, "It is well, my husband." After he had stopped several weeks he said to her, "My wife, I must now return home. I will stop one year, and then I will return to you." So she said, "May your journey be prosperous, my husband, and may you return in safety." So he set sail for Kilwa, and she set sail after him. In the midst of the ocean she passed him again, and when he asked who it was, she replied, "It is I, Kitangatanga of the sea." When she arrived in Kilwa she moored her vessel and went up to her house. She entered by her underground doorway and sat down. After a while her husband arrived and climbed in by his window. She said, "Welcome, my husband." Then she cooked food for him, and when he had eaten she asked him, "What is the news of there where you have been?" He replied, "I made a good voyage to Zanzibar, and there I met a woman just like you. I married her for one hundred reals, and stayed with her for two weeks. Then I went on to Maskat, and there I met a woman exactly like you and like that woman I married in Zanzibar. I married her, too, for a hundred reals, and stopped with her six months. "Then I returned to Zanzibar and stayed with my wife there a few weeks, then set out for home, and here I am. Now what is the news here of this place whilst I have been away?" That wife replied, "The news is this, my husband. I was angered because you put me in a hut without a door, so I made this underground door which you see there. "Then, when you set sail, I set sail after you, and I passed you in the sea; and when you asked who I was, I replied, 'Kitangatanga of the sea!' "I came first to Zanzibar, and it was I whom you married there for a hundred reals. "When you left for Maskat, I set sail behind you, and arrived there first. It was I also whom you married in Maskat for one hundred reals. That is my news, my husband." When her husband heard that, he said, "Indeed, this is true. Now I will build you a very fine hut with a door in it, so that you may go out when you please." So he built her a splendid hut with a door and put her into it, and there they lived happily.

When he goes out to hunt he digs a hole in the ground and hides it there. Then he goes to hunt, and when he has finished hunting and eating meat till he is satisfied, he comes back to that place where he has hid his charm and digs it up and swallows it. When he sees that he is about to die, he throws it far away, so that it may not be found at his death. [Illustration: BLESBOK] Should a man get it, he becomes possessed of great good fortune. If he wishes he can put it away and keep it, or if he desires he can sell it for much money, or he can make it into a charm and wear it himself. If a man wearing this charm meets with a lion, that lion is unable to do anything to him, by reason of that charm. X THE STORY OF KIBARAKA AND THE BIRD Once upon a time there was a Sultan, and he had one son, a very handsome youth, called Hasani. Every day at noon the Sultan and his son used to go to the mosque to pray. After they had gone the Sultan's wife used to sort out the seeds of every kind of grain in the Sultan's store. Those that needed drying she gave to a slave, called Kibaraka, to put out in the sun to dry. One day, after the Sultan and his son had gone to prayer, she called to the slave, "Kibaraka, take these seeds and put them out in the sun." Kibaraka took the grain and spread it out to dry, each kind by itself. Suddenly a wondrously fine bird came and sat down by the grain and called out-- "Kibaraka! Kibaraka!" [Illustration: The bird] He answered, "Here, lady, here." Then the bird sang-- _Bird._ "Shall I eat of this wheat? Or shall I not eat? Or shall I eat millet?" _Kibaraka._ "Eat, Lady, I will it." _Bird._ "Shall I eat rape instead? Or must I not be fed? Shall I eat maize to-day?" _Kibaraka._ "Eat, Lady, eat, I pray." _Bird._ "Shall I eat all the grain? Or must I now refrain? Shall I eat rice to-day?" _Kibaraka._ "Eat, Lady, eat, I pray." _Bird._ "Where has your master gone to-day?" _Kibaraka._ "Gone to the mosque to read and pray." _Bird._ "My greetings to the Sultan give When he returns. Long may he live." At that it flew away. On the next day and the day after the bird came again and sung the same song. Till one day Kibaraka told his young master Hasani, "Master, every day at one o'clock, when you are at the mosque, a lovely bird comes here." Hasani asked, "What kind of bird is this?" Kibaraka said, "All ordinary wonders are surpassed by this bird, for it sings a very beautiful song," and he told his master of the song. At these words the Sultan's son perceived that this bird was of the daughters of the Jins, and he fell in love with her. Then he said to Kibaraka, "See here, I have given you your freedom, you are no longer a slave, and now you must catch this bird for me." After that Hasani was seized with a grievous illness because of his longing for that bird till, on the third day at one o'clock, the Sultan went out to look for all the wisest of the medicine men to attend to his son. Whilst he was gone that bird came and sat by the grain and called, "Kibaraka! Kibaraka!" Kibaraka cut a thin pole and made a noose at the end and set it near the bullrush millet, the grain the bird loved best. When it had finished eating all the seeds it wished to fly away, but one of its wings caught in the noose. Then it said to Kibaraka, "Please let me go and do not touch me, for you will injure me. Take this feather of mine and carry it to your master, and let it be my salaams to him." So Kibaraka brought the feather to the Sultan's son. Hasani was very pleased. Then he said to him, "Kibaraka, my brother, why did not you catch the owner of this feather?" Kibaraka said, "I was not able to catch it. When I saw it I fell down seven times because of its light, and my wisdom forsook me." When the Sultan returned, his son said to him, "My father, you must sound the pallaver-horn, that all the people may come before the palace." The Sultan loved his son exceedingly, so he gathered all his people together. Then Hasani said, "Tell the people that they must look for this bird and bring it to me, and if they do not bring it I shall die." So the Sultan gave out the order, "There is no leave to weave or spin, to grind corn or pound grain, until this bird has been brought." At once all the people of that country went out into the jungles and deserts to look for that bird. Every one who found a fine bird would seize it and bring it to the Sultan's son, but to each he said, "This is not the one." Till one day, as people were sitting in the Sultan's court holding a pallaver, just after one o'clock had struck, they looked up and saw a dustcloud coming like rain. Behold, it was that bird coming, and Kibaraka recognised its coming. When it came it sat down by the grain and ate all the seeds till, as it came to the last, Kibaraka caught it and brought it to his master. When Hasani looked on that bird, behold, it was a beautiful woman. He said, "Kibaraka, run quickly, go your way to the audience chamber and tell my father that he must fire the cannons, for the thing I desired has come to pass, and the request I made of Allah has been granted." So Kibaraka came and told the Sultan, and the cannons were fired, and wedding festivities and feastings were held for nine years. After that Hasani and the fair Jin had a child, a boy like pearls and precious stones. And Hasani loved his wife exceedingly, and the people of that country saw wonders come to pass, for the second son was like the stars and the moon. The house of that Sultan was greatly blessed, and the story ends here. [Illustration: AFRICAN OKAPI] XI THE STORY OF THE FOOLS Once upon a time there lived a man called Omari and his wife, and they had a very fine fat black ox. So fat was this ox that all the young men in the village wanted to eat it, but Omari would not part with it. Till one day he went away on a journey; then they thought, "Now we will be able to get that ox and have a feast, for his wife is a great fool." So twenty men set out and came to the house of that woman, Omari's wife, and they knocked on the door. "Hodi!" And she replied, "Come near." So they went in and told that woman, "We have had a vision, and in that vision we saw that you were going to have a child, a beautiful boy, who will be rich and clever, and will marry the daughter of the Wazir." Now when the woman heard this she was wondrously pleased, for she had no child. Then these men said, "There was, in our dream, the sacrifice of a black ox, before this came to pass." So she said, "Take my ox and sacrifice him, that the vision may come true." They replied, "Shall we kill him, though, while your husband is away?" She said, "Take him, yes, take him, for my husband will be only too pleased when he knows for what purpose the ox has been slain; and he, too, desires a son." So the youths took away the ox and killed it and feasted and made merry. After three days the husband returned, and when he did not see his ox in its stall he asked his wife, "Where is the ox?" She said to him, "It has been slaughtered." "Why?" She replied, "Men came who had dreamed a dream that we should have a beautiful male child of great good fortune, and as the sacrifice of a black ox was necessary to bring it true, I gave ours to them." Omari then said to his wife, "You are a fool. Now I am going out to search for as great a fool as you are. If I cannot find any one who is your equal in folly, I shall leave you; you will cease to be my wife." So Omari took his donkey and rode away till he came to the house of a certain rich man, and this house had a verandah beneath it. Omari got off his donkey, and as he stood there, a woman, one of the slaves of the household, passed in, and said to him, "Master, where do you come from?" [Illustration: So Amari took his donkey and rode away.] Omari replied, "I come from the next world." Then was that slave very astonished, and she went upstairs to her mistress and said to her, "There, below in the verandah, is a man who comes from the next world." "Is that indeed so?" asked the mistress. "It is indeed true, and if you doubt me ask him yourself, for he is there below," said the slave. So the mistress sent her slave down to call Omari up into the house, and she came to him and said, "The mistress asks you to come upstairs." Omari replied, "I cannot come upstairs; I am afraid, because it is a stranger's house." When the slave brought these words to her mistress, she herself came down and called to Omari, "Do not be afraid; come upstairs; there is no danger." So Omari went upstairs, and that woman asked him, "Master, where do you come from?" Omari replied, "I come from the next world." "See," said the slave; "were not my words true?" Then was that mistress very amazed, and she asked him, "Why have you left the next world?" "I have come to see my father," answered Omari. "My father, who is dead," said the woman; "have you met him there in the next world?" "What is he called, and what is he like?" said Omari. "He is called so-and-so, son of so-and-so," said the woman, and she described to him his appearance. Omari replied, "I have seen him." "And how is he?" At that Omari put on an air of grief and shook his head and sighed. "Oh, tell me, what is the matter with my father?" asked the woman. Omari replied, "He is in great trouble. He has no money or clothes or food. Oh, his state is very bad!" When that woman heard these words she wept. Then she asked Omari, "When do you return to the next world?" "I return to-morrow. First, I must see my father, who is still alive, and then I go back." "Will you see my father when you return?" "Most certainly," said Omari. "Do I not live next door to him?" "Then," said that woman, "you must take him a present from me." So she went into an inner room and took out a bag of a thousand dollars, and clothes, and a robe, and turbans, and came and gave them to Omari, and said, "Take these and give them to my father, and say that they are from his daughter, Binti Fatima." Then she went in and brought out another bag and said, "Take these hundred dollars; they are a present for you, as you are taking these things for my father." So Omari gathered up the bags of money and the clothes and left that woman, and mounted his donkey and rode away. He had only just left when the husband of that woman in the house returned home. He noticed that his wife was very joyful, so he asked her, "My wife, why are you so glad to-day?" She said to him, "A man has just been here who has come from the next world, and he has met my father there in great trouble. So I have given him a thousand dollars and clothes to take to my father. That is why I am so happy; for now the spirit of my father will be very pleased with us, and it will bring us great good fortune." Now that man saw that his wife had been fooled, but he feared to say so, in case his wife should tell him no more, and he wished to follow that man and get the money back. So he said to her, "You are not a good wife, for when a man came from the next world to tell you about your father you gave him an offering to take back to him, but you never asked him about my father, or gave him anything to take to him." Then the wife said, "Oh, forgive me, my husband, but as he has only just left you may overtake him. He was riding a donkey, and he left by that road." Then she described him. So the husband called for his horse, and the wife ran in and brought out another bag of a thousand dollars, and as he mounted she gave it to him, saying, "Take this, my husband, and give it to him for your father, and if you gallop after him down that road you will surely overtake him." Now Omari had ridden away on his donkey till he came to a plantation, then he turned his head and saw, in the distance, the dust made by a galloping horse. There was no one on that plantation except one male slave, and so Omari said to him, "Do you see that dust? It is made by a man of great violence. I am going to hide from him, and I advise you to climb up into a coco-nut tree, lest he do you some harm. If he speaks to you do not answer him, for it will only make him more angry." So that slave scrambled up a coco-nut palm as fast as he could, whilst Omari hid himself and his donkey in a thicket close by. Presently the husband of the woman galloped up, and saw the slave clambering up to the top of a tall coco-nut tree. He stopped and called out, "Have you seen a man riding a donkey pass here?" The slave did not answer, but continued climbing higher and higher. He asked him again and again, and the slave did not reply, but only made more haste to get well out of reach. Then was that man very angry, and he got down from his horse and divested himself of all his robes, except only an under-garment, and placing them and the money on the ground, started climbing up after the slave. Omari watched him from behind the thicket, and, when he had got well up the tree, he came out and seized that man's money and clothes, as well as those he already had, and then mounted his horse and galloped off. When that man came down from the tree he found all his clothes and his money and his horse gone, and he was very ashamed. So he had to return home wearing only a loin-cloth. When he came in his wife asked him, "My husband, why do you return naked like that?" He was ashamed to tell her that he also had been fooled by that man, so he said, "I met the man from the next world, who told me that my father was in a very distressed condition, that he had no clothes, and was dressed in rags. So when I heard that, I took off all my clothes and gave them to that man to take to my father." Now Omari took all that money, and the clothes, and the horse, and came back to his wife and told her, "I said that I would seek for a fool like unto yourself, and if I did not find one that you would cease to be my wife. Well, now I am content, for I have found two fools, each one more foolish than you." So they lived together, Omari and his wife, and they spent the money and were happy together. Here ends the story of the fools, the fool-wife, and the husband and wife who were fooled. XII THE HYAENA AND THE MOONBEAM A hyaena went forth to drink water one day, and he came to a well and stooped down to quench his thirst. Now where he stooped down there was a moonbeam shining on the water. [Illustration: STRIPED HYAENA] The hyaena saw that moonshine there in the water and he thought it was a bone. He tried to reach it, but he could not, so he said to himself, "Now if I drink all this water I will get that bone which is at the bottom." [Illustration: SPOTTED HYAENAS] So he drank and drank, and the water was not finished. So he drank and drank again, till he was so full of water that he died. XIII THE SULTAN'S SNAKE-CHILD Once upon a time there was a Sultan and his Wazir, and those two men were very rich with much wealth, but neither had a son. They took counsel together, "How will it be when we die? Who shall we leave all this wealth to and we are without children?" The Sultan said to the Wazir, "We must go to a far country and look for some wise man who will tell us what to do." [Illustration: Snake] So they went away, and wandered on and on for three years, till at last they met an old woman, bent with the weight of many years. [Illustration: AT LAST THEY MET AN OLD WOMAN, BENT WITH THE WEIGHT OF MANY YEARS.] That woman said to them, "My grandsons, I know what you have come for." Then she sank down to the bottom of a big lake, and when she came up again out of the water she brought in her hands two charms, which were two slimy roots; one for the Sultan and one for the Wazir. And she said, "Take these, and when you return home you will find that your wish has already been accomplished; but to these charms I give you there are conditions attached. When you arrive in your town, you must tell no man about it, and take heed that in the way you neither chirrup nor look back." Then she shook her withered hand and said, "It has taken you three years to come; you will return in one month. Farewell." Then the Sultan and the Wazir set off home. In the way the Wazir said, "Allah be praised that our wish has been granted." The Sultan, forgetting the old woman's warning, chirruped, as much as to say, "I will believe when I see." After one month they came to the gate of their town, and as they entered the cannons sounded and the news spread forth, "There is an heir in the palace of the Sultan, and there is an heir in the house of the Wazir." The Wazir returned to his house swiftly, and there he found a most beautiful boy. The Sultan came to the palace, and there he found a snake. When he heard that the Wazir had a lovely child he was very pleased, and he used to go every day to the Wazir's house to see that child, but he told his people to throw that snake out of the palace. Now there was a slave girl in the palace called Mizi, and when she saw them taking that snake to throw it in the river she said, "Give me that snake, that I may bring him up as my child." So Mizi took that snake and wore him round her neck till he grew, and then she came to the Sultan and said, "Build me a grass hut, that I may live there with my child, the snake." So a hut was built for her, and she stayed there by herself with that snake. She took her cooking pots there, and cooked food for herself and the snake. Every day she fed that snake, and it grew and grew, till at last it filled up the whole hut. Then that snake said to Mizi, "Go and tell the Sultan that his little snake wants a stone house of seven storeys in which to live. He must look for craftsmen who are not afraid, to come and build the house, and what they ask must be given them." So Mizi came and told those words to the Sultan, and craftsmen who had no fear were sought for. They came and built a house of seven storeys in the space of seven days, and the wages they asked for were given them. When the house was finished, they said, "Go and tell the little snake that the house is ready." Then Mizi and the snake moved into that house and lived there. Till one day the snake said to Mizi, "Go and look for a sage who will teach me learning, but he must be master of his heart and unafraid. He must come of his own free will." So she went and sought a man of learning, but every one she asked to come replied, "I am not going so as to be swallowed whole by that snake." At last she found a sage who said, "I will go, for I see that Mizi lives with this snake and is not devoured, so why should I be eaten?" So that professor came and taught the snake learning of every kind, and when he had finished he went to the Sultan and received the pay he asked for. So the snake and Mizi lived together, till one day that snake said to her, "Now you must go and look for a wife for me; but she must come of her own free will, and what money she wants she must have." So a wife for the snake was sought for in all the land, but none was found; all said, "Who wants to go and be swallowed whole by a big snake?" Now in that country was a very poor man who had seven daughters. When the news came to them all refused, till the seventh and youngest was asked, and she replied, "We are very poor; I will go and be eaten by that snake. What matter?" So that girl was taken and decked out with pearls and precious stones and clothes of silk, and then Mizi was called and told, "This is the wife of your master, the snake. Take her." So Mizi took her and brought her to the snake, and he said, "Arrange everything for her comfort." When night had come, Mizi slept with that girl till, when twelve o'clock came, that snake came out from inside his skin. He put on wooden sandals and went to the bathroom and made his ablutions. When he had finished washing he took his prayer mat and spread it out and prayed and read the Koran. After that he came and sat near that girl and looked at her and said, "My wife is beautiful; she has beautiful eyes, lovely ears and long straight hair. Hhum! Poor me, who am a snake. Sleep, my beautiful wife." Then he entered his skin again and slept. Seven days passed in this way, and on the eighth Mizi said to that girl, "I will fasten a thread to your thumb; when I pull it open your eyes and look at him." That night, at twelve o'clock, the snake came out of his skin, and then Mizi pulled the thread and that girl awoke and opened her eyes and saw a wondrously handsome Arab youth: in all that country there was no youth so handsome as that son of the Sultan. The snake went to the bathroom and made his ablutions, and then returned and prayed and read the Koran. At the time of the before dawn breezes he came and looked at his wife and then returned to his skin. When dawn came Mizi and that girl took counsel together, and then Mizi went to the Sultan and said to him, "Give me three tins of oil and ten maunds of firewood." When she had got them she had them brought to the house. Then she said to that girl, "Now we must dig a pit here in the other room." So they dug a pit and put in it the firewood and then poured the oil over it. That night they watched till after midnight. When the youth went to the bathroom they got up and seized on the skin and tried to drag it into the pit, but it was too heavy for them. So they exerted all their strength, till at last they managed to drag it into the pit. After that they set fire to the wood and the oil. When its owner in the bathroom heard the skin crackling he ran in and said to Mizi, "What have you done, taking away my clothes to put in the fire?" Then he fell down, and did not regain consciousness till three o'clock next day, for that youth did not know the world outside of his skin. When he recovered Mizi cooked porridge for him, and when he had eaten it he said to Mizi, "Go to the Sultan and tell him to make offerings, nine shells full of alms; for the day after to-morrow I will go out." So Mizi went with the news to the Sultan, but he replied, "Go back and get eaten by that snake. We do not want any more of your folly; for you have taken the poor man's daughter and brought her to the snake, and she has already been swallowed up. Now you in your turn will be eaten, and to-day, I suppose, you have come to take leave of us." Mizi returned and said to that youth, "He will not give the offering." He replied, "Then leave him; he who has had no luck does not trust to luck. On Friday I will come forth by the power of Allah, alone." When Friday came he decked his horse with pearls and precious stones and rode off to the mosque to pray amongst all the people; but the Sultan did not know that it was his son. Then Mizi came forth and trilled and shouted for joy, and told every one in the mosque: "Look at me to-day, for it is to-day that my son, the snake, has come to life." Many people thought that Mizi had gone mad. When the Sultan had finished praying he came forth, and Mizi said to him, "To-day my child has come forth." The Sultan said, "Peace be upon you;" and he followed that youth on his horse and knew that it was his son, and rejoiced greatly. He said to his slaves, "Run to the palace, spread out diamonds and cushions, carpets and mats; do not leave anything of any value, but spread everything out." Then was the wedding of that girl, the poor man's daughter, and the snake held with great festivity. So that snake and Mizi lived happily, and he loved her as if she had been his own mother. When he became Sultan he gave the kingdom to her, he gave Mizi what spoke and what did not speak; it became her country, because she had nurtured that snake from its infancy until it became a full-grown man of wisdom. Now this story comes from the Sultan and his Wazir. XIV THE POOR MAN AND HIS WIFE OF WOOD Once upon a time there was a poor man who used to beg. One day he sat thinking to himself, "I am a poor man and have no wife. When I go out begging there is no one to come back to in my house or to cook my food for me whilst I am away." So he went out to the forest and cut down a tree and carved out of it a woman of wood, and when he had finished he decorated her with jewels and necklaces of wood, and then brought her back to his house. Then that tree turned into a woman, and he called her Mwanamizi, the child of a root, and he lived with her many days. Till one day, when that poor man had gone forth to beg, a slave girl ran out from the palace of the Sultan in search of a brand with which to light the fire. She came and knocked at the poor man's door, and when she got no answer she entered and went into the kitchen, and there she saw a lovely woman decked out with pearls and jewels. She went running back to the Sultan and said to him, "I have just seen the most wondrously beautiful woman in the house of that beggar who lives near us." The Sultan then ordered his soldiers, "Go to fetch the wife of the beggar, that I may see if the words of this slave are true or false." So they went and took Mwanamizi and brought her to the palace. When the Sultan saw her he thought her very beautiful. So he said, "This woman is too beautiful for a beggar. I will take her for my wife." Now when that poor man returned from begging he could not find his wife; then the neighbours told him, "The woman has been taken by the Sultan to his palace." So he threw down his bag and went round to the palace, and rushed in before the Sultan and asked him, "Where is my wife whom you have taken?" The Sultan replied, "Get out of my sight, you foolish fellow, or I will order my soldiers to beat you." Then he said, "If you will not give me back my wife, take off my ornaments which she is wearing and return them to me, that I may go." At that the Sultan called his soldiers and had him turned out of the palace. After that the poor man went under the Sultan's window and sang-- "Oh listen, master, unto me: My wife I carved from yonder tree; I carved her well, with zeal untold, And decked her out with fetters gold. These ornaments and jewels fine, Oh, give them back, for they are mine; And, Mwanamizi, let me go." When the woman heard the poor man's song she was bathed in tears. The Sultan then said to her, "Take off those silly ornaments and throw them to him, that he may go away. I will give you things tenfold more fine and rare." The woman did not want to take off those things. The poor man sang again-- "Oh listen, master, unto me: I carved my wife from yonder tree." Then the woman took off her ornaments and threw them down to him, saying-- "The ornaments are thine, The golden fetters fine; Take them, oh, take them, Makami, and go." She cried then very much, and took off all her things, till there was left a single charm round her neck. The Sultan said, "Take off all his ornaments quickly and throw them to him, that he may go." But Mwanamizi did not want to take off that charm, for it was her soul. Then the poor man sang again, and Mwanamizi unfastened the charm from her neck and threw it to him, and at that moment she turned into a tree there in the house of the Sultan. [Illustration: "AT THAT MOMENT SHE TURNED INTO A TREE"] The poor man sighed and went back to his house, but the Sultan in his palace was seized with great fear. The telling of the story ends here. XV BINTI ALI THE CLEVER Once upon a time there was a Sultan and his Wazir, and that Sultan had seven children, all sons, and that Wazir had seven children, all daughters. [Illustration: Seven sons] Those daughters of the Wazir had no mother; their mother had died, and they were very poor. The sons of the Sultan used to laugh at the daughters of the Wazir, saying, "You poor people, what do you eat? It is our father who pays your father his wages, and how do they suffice for you seven people who are in one house? You poor creatures, you have not even a brother to help you." Now those girls used to plait baskets and sell them. They lived for many days like that, their work being to cry every day, and when they came out of school they used to plait and sell their baskets. Till one day the youngest daughter, who was called Binti Ali, was sitting with her father, and she said to him, "What advice have you to give us, father?" Her father asked her, "Why, my child?" She said to him, "We are only seven girls; we have neither husbands nor brothers. Should anything happen to you, who will be our headman? Father, you must arrange to have a ship built for me, and it must be ready in the space of three years." Her father said, "All this wealth, where shall I get it from, that I may build a ship?" She answered him, "God, the merciful, will provide." In the morning the Wazir arose and went to the Sultan and said to him, "Give me help, for my youngest child wants a vessel built for her." The Sultan brought out nine lakhs of rupees and gave them to his Wazir. Then the Wazir sought for workmen, and told them to build a ship and have it ready in three years' time. Now that child, Binti Ali, was very beautiful, more beautiful than all her sisters. Many men had come to seek her in marriage, but she had refused them, saying, "I am poor; my father has not wealth to suffice for my wedding." At the end of three years the ship was ready, and her father called her, "Eh, my child, Binti Ali." And she answered him, "Lebeka, father," which means "Here I am" in the language of to-day; but long, long ago, Lebek was the name of the god worshipped by the Phoenicians at the temple of Baal-lebek (Bal bek). Her father said to her, "Your ship is finished and ready for you." So she went to see it, and found that it was built in a wondrously fine way. When she returned she said to her father, "Now you must find me a captain and sailors, and you must put on the vessel enough food to last three years." So he found a crew for her, and provisioned the ship and returned. Then she said, "Father, now you must buy for me fine raiment, a sultan's turban, a shirt and coat, and a sword and dagger. Also you must get for me sandals of gold braid and two men's gold rings." So her father searched for one hour and half a second, and then returned and said, "My child, the things you want are ready." Then he asked her, "My child, where are you going to? Tell me." She said, "Father, have you no understanding? I am going to the country of the Sultan Makami." Her father said to her, "My child, you are already lost. Do you not know that a woman may not go to the country of Sultan Makami? Any other than a male who enters the country is put to death." Binti Ali said to him, "Father, have you no wits, you, a full-grown man, who rule all this land? Do you not see that all these clothes which you have bought for me are men's clothes? I want to go and see Makami's country." Her father said, "I do not approve of this journey you are setting out upon." His daughter replied, "What becomes of me is in the hands of God." Then she entered the bathroom and washed herself, and when she came out she was dressed as a man. Now that girl had wisdom more than all her sisters, and she was well read in the Koran. She took her dog, whose name was Atakalo, and she entered the ship and set sail. She travelled day and night for three years, and there in the midst of the ocean she taught her dog till it attained great learning. At the end of the third year she drew near to the country of Sultan Makami, and she ordered a salute to be fired, and the people on land replied also with a salute. When her vessel drew near, the Sultan's son rowed out to meet her. He climbed on board, and there he saw a handsome Arab youth sitting on the deck. Binti Ali arose, and they greeted one another after the fashion of men: "Peace be with you," "And with you peace." She went ashore with that son of the Sultan, and they came to the palace. When they came to the palace he said to his father, the Sultan, "How shall we see that this is a man and not a woman? Let us give him very hot gruel, and if it is a woman she will not be able to drink it, and then we will kill her." So they ordered food to be brought, and slaves were told: "Take matting and platters, and very big trays and cups of gold, and place them ready for the feast." When the food was ready they brought gruel for that foreign youth to drink, and it was very hot. Binti Ali took it and threw it away, saying, "Am I a woman, that you bring me cold gruel like that?" So they prepared fresh gruel, steaming hot, and gave it to her, and she said, "Ah, that is more fit for a Sultan's son to drink." So she put it beside her, and her dog Atakalo blew on it, so that it quickly cooled, and she drank it. Very good food was then brought, and they fed, and she returned to her ship. The Sultan then said, "To-morrow we must take this foreigner to my store of jewels and ornaments, and if it be a woman we will surely see, for she will take delight in women's jewellery." All night long Binti Ali taught Atakalo what he should do, and in the morning the Sultan's son came to fetch her. He said, "My father says that I am to take you to his store and show you his treasures." So they went to the Sultan's treasure-house, where they showed her neck chains and nose pendants, anklets and bracelets, women's gold rings and ear ornaments. She said, "Have you in this country no men's ornaments, that you should show me nothing but women's jewellery?" So they brought her to the next store, wherein were gold-hilted daggers and all manner of arms, swords and pistols, guns and muskets. These she admired, and meanwhile Atakalo went and swallowed all the gold ornaments he could find and took them to the ship, till he had brought much wealth aboard. Then the Sultan's son said to his father, "Now what shall we do, so that we may kill her if she is a woman?" So the Sultan said, "Make him take off his turban, and then we will surely see by the manner in which he ties it whether it is a woman or not." So the Sultan's son said, "Now will you not wash?" Binti Ali said, "Thank you, I have already bathed on board." So he said, "If it is only your face, I beseech you to wash." So she said, "Certainly; but first you and your father must wash." So they took off their turbans and began to wash, when suddenly there was a shout from outside: "The Sultan's house is on fire." Behold, that dog Atakalo had brought a brand and set fire to the palace. Then the Sultan and his son and all the people in his house rushed out, with their turbans in their hands, to see what was the matter and help put out the flames. Binti Ali went down swiftly to her ship and got on board, and meanwhile Atakalo had run round and bored a hole in the bottom of every boat and ship in the Sultan's harbour. Then Atakalo came back to her vessel and said, "Mistress, I have finished." [Illustration: Seven daughters] So she weighed anchor and changed into her woman's clothes. The Sultan and his son and all the people, when they saw that she was sailing off, rushed down to the beach and tried to row out and stop her, but every boat they launched sunk; and so they were not able to get to her. Then they saw her come up on the deck. Then, changing her clothes as a woman, she sings-- "Makami, behold my bracelets and rings. See my anklets, Makami. Aha, behold! See the chain for my neck of beautiful gold. Behold now my ear-rings and nose-stud see. Lola, Makami, lola, look well at me. I'm Binti Ali, the Wazir's daughter; I came, Makami, from over the water. We are seven in all, the last born am I. Farewell, Makami, for I bid you good-bye. Lola, Makami, lola, farewell." Then she said to the captain, "Set sail, and let us return home." When she arrived home there in her town her father and sisters were holding a great mourning for her, for they said, "Our youngest one has now been away many years; surely she must be dead." When they saw her their hearts were very glad, and a feast was made for her for the space of three days. And the riches she brought with her, which her dog Atakalo had taken from the Sultan's treasure house, were brought to land; and when he saw them her father rejoiced greatly. After a space of ten days she said to her father, "I know that Sultan Makami's son is making a plan to get me. If he comes here and asks for me in marriage, do not refuse him, but agree. My cleverness, which I have in my heart, is that which will save me." One day the Sultan of Makami's son arrived, and came to the Wazir and said, "I want your daughter, Binti Ali, in marriage." So the Wazir agreed. Binti Ali took a large pumpkin and filled it with honey and placed it on her bed, and she herself got under the bed. That night the Sultan of Makami's son came into her room and said, "Ee, woman," and she replied, "Lebeka, master." Then he said, "You, woman, you think that you can come to our country and cheat us, pretending that you are a man. Behold, to-day is your last, so make profession of faith quickly, so that you may be prepared for death." Binti Ali said, "I testify there is no God but one God, and Muhammad is the prophet of God." So he drew his sword and struck a blow which cut the pumpkin in two, and then he went out quickly and got on his ship and sailed away. When he came to look at his sword, to wipe the blood off, he found no blood, but only honey stuck all over it. [Illustration: Resting camel] This is the end of the story. The tale comes from the Wazir and his daughter, the last born, who was called Binti Ali the Clever. XVI SEGU THE HONEY-GUIDE Segu is the honey-guide. His work is that he lives in the forest and flies about looking for bees' nests, and when he finds one he goes to look for men. When he finds them he says, "Che! che! che! che!" until those sons of men look up and say, "Ah, there is Segu. Let us go with him that he may show us honey." So these people follow Segu, who flies in front from tree to tree saying, "Che! che! che! che!" When he comes to that tree where the honey is he flies round, saying, "Che! che! che! che!" very fast, and then he goes and sits by himself. Then these men come to the tree and look up and see where the bees' nest is; so they climb up with their axe and cut a hole and get out the honey. They take that honey and are very pleased, but a little of it they leave for Segu as his share. On these people going away, Segu comes out and finds the honey which they have left him; so he sits and eats and fills himself, and arises and flies away. This is, indeed, Segu's manner of living. Another day Segu sees a lion asleep, and he looks for people, and when he finds them he twitters and says, "Che! che! che! che!" Then these people follow him thinking, "To-day Segu is going to show us much honey." They follow him up there to where the lion is lying, and when they suddenly see him they are unable to stand, if there is running away to be done instead. The lion frightens these people, so they run swiftly away, saying, "To-day Segu has done evil; every day he shows us honey, and to-day he comes to show us a lion." That is all. XVII LILA AND FILA There were once upon a time two poor children, one was called Lila and one was called Fila, and they were great friends. Fila said one day to Lila, "Our mothers are poor; what can we do for a living, my friend? We have no money with which to repay them for the kindness they have shown towards us. We have now become full-grown lads, and have not yet earned any money to give them. I propose that we set out on a journey and see what we can find." [Illustration: Lila and Fila] Lila agreed to the words of his friend, and so each one went to his mother and said to her, "Mother, make me seven ladu-cakes, for I am going on a journey to a very far country." And each mother replied, "Where are you going, my beloved child?" Lila's mother said to him, "Do not go with Fila." Lila answered, "I am not able to leave my friend Fila for half a second." His mother said, "It is he that will leave you, and it is you that will be lost." He replied, "If a man is lost for the sake of his friend it is well." So they had each one seven ladu-cakes made for him, and each one took a gourd of water, and on the next day they set out. After they had gone a day's journey Fila said to Lila, "Bring out one of your ladus, that we may break and eat it. We will eat yours first, and when they are finished then will we eat mine." So they ate one of Lila's ladus. On the second day they did likewise, and on the next and the next day, until, on the seventh day, all Lila's ladus were finished. On the eighth day Lila said to Fila, "Bring out one of your ladus, my friend, that we may break and eat it, for all mine are now finished, and hunger is hurting me." Fila replied, "You must give me that Kanzu shirt of yours first, and then I will give you a share of my ladu." So Lila took off his Kanzu and gave it to Fila, and then Fila broke off a bit from one of his ladus and gave it to him. On the next day Lila said, "My friend, I am hungry; bring out the second of your ladus, that we may eat it." Fila replied, "To-day if I am to give you some of my ladu you must give me your vest." So Lila took off his vest and gave it to Fila, and received a piece of ladu for it. On the next and the next day it was the same, till, on the twelfth day, Fila had taken away all Lila's clothes. On the thirteenth day, when Lila asked for some ladu, Fila said, "You must let me put out one of your eyes if you are to have any ladu to-day." Lila replied, "I cannot refuse, for I am very hungry." So Fila put out one of his friend's eyes, and Lila said nothing; he put all his misfortunes in the hand of God. On the fourteenth day Lila said to Fila, "My friend, have you not treated me evilly? Have you not done wrong? I left my mother to follow you, my friend, and you have deceived me. You have eaten my ladus till they were finished, and now you have taken all my clothes and put out my eye. Will you not to-day give me a piece of your ladu?" Fila said, "Yes, I will give you a piece of ladu if you agree to me putting out your other eye." Lila said to him, "Go on, put out my other eye." So Fila put out his other eye, and then he sat him down under a tree and put his gourd of water and a piece of ladu beside him and went his way, leaving his friend blind and naked in the road. Lila sat there awhile, and then he ate his piece of ladu, drank his water, gave praise to God and then slept. When it was midnight two birds came and perched on the tree, one on one side and one on the other. The first said, "Eh, my friend, I have a song which I will sing." The other asked, "What song will you sing?" Then the first bird looked down and said, "Look, there is a human asleep underneath." The other said, "Oh, that son of Adam is lying just where those jars of money are buried; just opposite him is the tree whose roots are medicine for mad people, and he is leaning against the eye medicine tree." Then they flew away; but Lila heard these words, and he groped and took some of the bark of that tree and rubbed it on his eyes, and behold, he could see; both his eyes were whole. Then he went to the other tree and dug up some of the roots, and after that he dug down where he had been lying and found jars of money. He took a little money, and the rest he covered up and left. Next day he took the road and journeyed on, and that day he arrived at a town, and there he heard the news that the daughter of the Sultan had been seized with madness. He was told, "No one is allowed to come to this country unless he knows how to make medicine for the Sultan's daughter. This is now the seventh year since she became mad, and the Sultan has made a vow that he who cures her will marry her, and he who does not cure her will be killed." So Lila entered that town, and he was at once taken before the Sultan, who asked him, "Can you cure my child?" He replied, "Master, I do not know medicines, but I will try." So he was taken in to the Sultan's daughter through seven doors, and he saw her where she had been put. She was fastened with chains on hands and feet. He gave her of that medicine, and immediately she became cured. Then the Sultan ordered a feast to be prepared, and he married Lila to his daughter. He himself descended from the throne and put Lila in his place. So Lila became the Sultan of that town. One day, as he looked out of the palace window, he saw a man passing, and when he came near he recognised that it was his friend Fila. He told his soldiers to fetch him and bring him before him. When Fila was brought he said to him, "My friend, do you not recognise me?" Fila replied, "I do not know you." Then Lila said, "Is it not I whose eyes you put out?" Then Fila was very afraid, and said, "Then it is you who will now put out mine." Lila ordered his soldiers, "Take him out, put out his eyes and leave him in the way." So they took him out and did as they were bid. After three days they went to look for him and found that he had died. Lila and Fila, it was not possible for them to mix together, and even to-day, if there are two people who cannot agree, or two things which cannot go together, it is said And you were all the better for it, I know! ALICE Yes, but then I _had_ done the things I was punished for; that makes all the difference. WHITE QUEEN But if you hadn't done them that would have been better still; better and better and better! ALICE There's a mistake somewhere-- WHITE QUEEN [_Screams like an engine whistle, and shakes her hand._] Oh, Oh, Oh! My finger's bleeding. Oh, Oh, Oh! ALICE What _is_ the matter? Have you pricked your finger? WHITE QUEEN I haven't pricked it yet--but I soon shall--Oh, Oh, Oh! ALICE When do you expect to do it? WHITE QUEEN When I fasten my shawl again; the brooch will come undone directly. Oh, Oh! [_Brooch flies open and she clutches it wildly._] ALICE Take care! you're holding it all crooked! WHITE QUEEN [_Pricks her finger and smiles._] That accounts for the bleeding, you see; now you understand the way things happen here. ALICE But why don't you scream now? [Illustration] WHITE QUEEN Why, I've done all the screaming already. What would be the good of having it all over again? Oh! it's time to run if you want to stay in the same place! Come on! ALICE No, no! Not so fast! I'm getting dizzy!! WHITE QUEEN Faster, faster! ALICE Everything's black before my eyes! [_There is music, and the sound of rushing wind, and in the darkness the WHITE QUEEN cries: "Faster, faster"; ALICE gasps: "I can't--please stop"; and the QUEEN replies: "Then you can't stay in the same place. I'll have to drop you behind. Faster--faster, good-bye."_] SCENE THREE _When the curtain rises one sees nothing but odd black lanterns with orange lights, hanging, presumably, from the sky. The scene lights up slowly revealing ALICE seated on two large cushions. She has been "dropped behind" by the WHITE QUEEN and is dazed to find herself in a strange hall with many peculiar doors and knobs too high to reach._ ALICE Oh! my head! Where am I? Oh dear, Oh dear! [_She staggers up and to her amazement finds herself smaller than the table._] I've never been smaller than any table before! I've always been able to reach the knobs! What a curious feeling. Oh! I'm shrinking. It's the fan--the gloves! [_She throws them away, feels her head and measures herself against table and doors._] Oh! saved in time! But I never--never-- WHITE RABBIT Oh! my fan and gloves! Where _are_ my-- ALICE Oh! Mr. Rabbit--please help me out--I want to go home--I want to go home-- WHITE RABBIT Oh! the Duchess! Oh! my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Oh! _you_ have them! ALICE I'm sorry--you dropped them, you know-- WHITE RABBIT [_Picks up fan and gloves and patters off._] She'll chop off your head! ALICE If you please sir--where am I?--won't you please--tell me how to get out--I want to get out-- WHITE RABBIT [_Looking at his watch._] Oh! my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting. [_A trap door gives way and RABBIT disappears. ALICE dashes after only in time to have the trap door bang in her face._] ALICE [_Amazed._] It's a rabbit-hole--I'm small enough to fit it too! If I shrink any more it might end in my going out altogether like a candle. I wonder what I would be like then! What does the flame of a candle look like after the candle is blown out? I've never seen such a thing! HUMPTY DUMPTY [_Sits on the wall._] Don't stand chattering to yourself like that, but tell me your name and your business. ALICE My _name_ is Alice, but-- HUMPTY DUMPTY It's a stupid name enough, what does it mean? ALICE _Must_ a name mean something? HUMPTY DUMPTY Of course it must; _my_ name means the shape I am--and a good, handsome shape it is, too. With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost. ALICE You're Humpty Dumpty! Just like an egg. HUMPTY DUMPTY It's _very_ provoking, to be called an egg--_very_. ALICE I said you _looked_ like an egg, Sir, and some eggs are very pretty, you know. HUMPTY DUMPTY Some people have no more sense than a baby. ALICE Why do you sit here all alone? HUMPTY DUMPTY Why, because there's nobody with me. Did you think I didn't know the answer to _that_? Ask another. ALICE Don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground? That wall's so very narrow. HUMPTY DUMPTY What tremendously easy riddles you ask! Of course I don't think so. Take a good look at me! I'm one that has spoken to a king, I am; to show you I'm not proud, you may shake hands with me! [_He leans forward to offer ALICE his hand but she is too small to reach it._] However, this conversation is going on a little too fast; let's go back to the last remark but one. ALICE I'm afraid I can't remember it. HUMPTY DUMPTY In that case we start fresh, and it's my turn to choose a subject. ALICE You talk about it just as if it were a game. HUMPTY DUMPTY So here's a question for you. How old did you say you were? ALICE Seven years and six months. HUMPTY DUMPTY Wrong! You never said a word about it. Now if you'd asked _my_ advice, I'd have said, "Leave off at seven--but--" ALICE I never ask advice about growing. HUMPTY DUMPTY Too proud? ALICE What a beautiful belt you've got on. At least, a beautiful cravat, I should have said--no, a belt, I mean--I beg your pardon. If only I knew which was neck and which was waist. HUMPTY DUMPTY It is a--_most--provoking_--thing, when a person doesn't know a cravat from a belt. ALICE I know it's very ignorant of me. HUMPTY DUMPTY It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. There's glory for you. ALICE I don't know what you mean by "glory." HUMPTY DUMPTY When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less. ALICE The question is, whether you _can_ make words mean different things. HUMPTY DUMPTY The question is, which is to be master--that's all. Impenetrability! That's what I say! ALICE Would you tell me, please, what that means? HUMPTY DUMPTY I meant by "impenetrability" that we've had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life. ALICE That's a great deal to make one word mean. HUMPTY DUMPTY When I make a word do a lot of work like that I always pay it extra. ALICE Oh! HUMPTY DUMPTY Ah, you should see 'em come round me of a Saturday night, for to get their wages, you know. That's all--Good-bye. ALICE Good-bye till we meet again. HUMPTY DUMPTY I shouldn't know you again, if we _did_ meet, you're so exactly like other people. ALICE The face is what one goes by, generally. HUMPTY DUMPTY That's just what I complain of. Your face is the same as everybody has--the two eyes--so--nose in the middle, mouth under. It's always the same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance--or the mouth at the top--that would be _some_ help. ALICE It wouldn't look nice. HUMPTY DUMPTY Wait till you've tried! Good-bye. [_He disappears as he came._] ALICE Oh! I forgot to ask him how to-- [_She tries to open the doors. They are all locked; she begins to weep. She walks weeping to a high glass table and sits down on its lower ledge. She sits on a big golden key and picks it up in surprise. She tries it on all the doors but it does not fit. She weeps and weeps--and Wonderland grows dark to her in her despair. In the darkness she cries, "Oh! I'm slipping! Oh, Oh! it's a lake; Oh! my tears! I'm floating!" A mysterious light shows a "Drink me" sign around a bottle on the top of the table. ALICE floats up to it panting, and holding on to the edge of the table takes up the bottle._] ALICE It isn't marked poison. [_She sips at it._] This is good! Tastes like cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast--all together. Oh! Oh! I'm letting out like a telescope. [_A mysterious light shows her lengthening out._] [_Music._] But the lake is rising too. Oh! Oh! it's deep! I'm drowning. Help, help, I'm drowning, I'm drowning in my tears! GRYPHON Hjckrrh. Hjckrrh! [_The GRYPHON, a huge green creature with big glittering wings, appears where HUMPTY DUMPTY had been and reaches glittering claws over to grab and save ALICE._] SCENE FOUR _Is symbolic of a wet and rocky shore in a weird green light. The MOCK TURTLE is weeping dismally._ GRYPHON Hjckrrh. Hjckrrh. Hjckrrh. MOCK TURTLE [_Answers with his weeping._] GRYPHON [_Drags ALICE in._] Drop your tears into the sea with his. ALICE He sobs as if he had a bone in his throat. He sighs as if his heart would break. What is his sorrow? MOCK TURTLE Oh, Gryphon, it's terrible! GRYPHON It's all his fancy that. Mock Turtle hasn't got no sorrow. This here young lady, she wants for to know your history, she do. MOCK TURTLE I'll tell it her. Sit down both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished. ALICE I don't see how you can _ever_ finish, if you don't begin. MOCK TURTLE Once, I was a real Turtle. [_A long silence is broken only by the exclamations, "Hjckrrh," of the GRYPHON and the heavy sobbing of the MOCK TURTLE._] MOCK TURTLE When we were little, we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him tortoise-- ALICE Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one? MOCK TURTLE We called him Tortoise because he taught us; really you are very dull. GRYPHON You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question. Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it! MOCK TURTLE Yes, we went to school in the sea, tho' you mayn't believe it-- ALICE I never said I didn't. MOCK TURTLE You did. GRYPHON Hold your tongue! MOCK TURTLE We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day. ALICE I've been to a day school too; you needn't be so proud as all that. MOCK TURTLE With extras? ALICE Yes, we learned French and music. MOCK TURTLE And washing? ALICE Certainly not! [Illustration] MOCK TURTLE Ah! Then yours wasn't a really good school. Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill, French, music, _and washing_--extra. ALICE You couldn't have wanted it much; living at the bottom of the sea. MOCK TURTLE I couldn't afford to learn it, I only took the regular course. ALICE What was that? MOCK TURTLE Reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with, and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. ALICE I never heard of Uglification. What is it? GRYPHON Never heard of uglifying! You know what to beautify is, I suppose? ALICE Yes, it means--to--make--anything--prettier. GRYPHON Well then, if you don't know what to uglify is, you _are_ a simpleton. ALICE What else had you to learn? MOCK TURTLE Well, there was Mystery; Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography, then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger eel, that used to come once a week; what _he_ taught us was Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils. ALICE What was _that_ like? MOCK TURTLE Well, I can't show it you, myself. I'm too stiff. And the Gryphon never learned it. GRYPHON Hadn't time; I went to the Classical master, though. He was an old crab, _he_ was. MOCK TURTLE I never went to him; he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say. GRYPHON So he did, so he did. ALICE And how many hours a day did you do lessons? MOCK TURTLE Ten hours the first day, nine the next, and so on. ALICE What a curious plan! GRYPHON That's the reason they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day. ALICE Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday? MOCK TURTLE Of course it was. ALICE And how did you manage on the twelfth? GRYPHON That's enough about lessons, tell her something about the games now. [_MOCK TURTLE sighs deeply, draws back of one flapper across his eyes. He looks at ALICE and tries to speak but sobs choke his voice._] GRYPHON [_Punching him in the back._] Same as if he had a bone in his throat. MOCK TURTLE [_With tears running down his cheeks._] You may not have lived much under the sea-- ALICE I haven't. MOCK TURTLE And perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster. ALICE I once tasted--no, never! MOCK TURTLE So you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is. ALICE No, indeed. What sort of a dance is it? GRYPHON Why, you first form into a line along the seashore. MOCK TURTLE Two lines; seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jellyfish out of the way-- GRYPHON _That_ generally takes some time. MOCK TURTLE You advance twice-- GRYPHON Each with a lobster as a partner. MOCK TURTLE Of course, advance twice, set to partners. GRYPHON Change lobsters, and retire in same order. MOCK TURTLE Then you know, you throw the-- GRYPHON The lobsters! MOCK TURTLE As far out to sea as you can-- GRYPHON Swim after them! MOCK TURTLE Turn a somersault in the sea. GRYPHON Change lobsters again! MOCK TURTLE Back to land again, and--that's all the first figure. ALICE It must be a very pretty dance. MOCK TURTLE Would you like to see a little of it? ALICE Very much indeed. MOCK TURTLE Come, let's try the first figure. We can do it without lobsters, you know; which shall sing? GRYPHON Oh, _you_ sing, I've forgotten the words. [_Creatures solemnly dance round and round ALICE, treading on her toes, waving fore-paws to mark time while MOCK TURTLE sings._] First Verse "Will you walk a little faster!" said a whiting to a snail, "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance? Second Verse "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!" But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. [_The creatures dance against ALICE, pushing her back and forth between them. She protests and finally escapes; they bump against each other._] ALICE Thank you; it's a very interesting dance to watch, and I do so like that curious song about the whiting. MOCK TURTLE Oh, as to the whiting, they--you've seen them, of course? ALICE Yes, I've often seen them at din-- [_Checks herself hastily._] MOCK TURTLE I don't know where Din may be, but if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're like. ALICE I believe so, they have their tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs. MOCK TURTLE You're wrong about the crumbs, crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths; and the reason is-- [_MOCK TURTLE yawns and shuts his eyes._] Tell her about the reason and all that. GRYPHON The reason is, that they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all. ALICE Thank you, it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before. GRYPHON I can tell you more than that, if you like. Do you know why it's called a whiting? ALICE I never thought about it. Why? GRYPHON _It does the boots and shoes._ ALICE Does the boots and shoes! GRYPHON Why, what are _your_ shoes done with? I mean, what makes them so shiny? ALICE They're done with blacking, I believe. GRYPHON Boots and shoes under the sea, are done with whiting. Now you know. ALICE And what are they made of? GRYPHON Soles and eels, of course; any shrimp could have told you that. ALICE If I'd been the whiting, I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please; we don't want _you_ with us." MOCK TURTLE They were obliged to have him with them, no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise. ALICE Wouldn't it really? MOCK TURTLE Of course not; why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey, I should say, "With what porpoise?" ALICE Don't you mean purpose? MOCK TURTLE I mean what I say. [Illustration] GRYPHON Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille? Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song? ALICE Oh, a song please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind. GRYPHON Um! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow? MOCK TURTLE [_Sighs deeply and sometimes choked with sobs, sings._] "Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen! Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau--ootiful Soo--op, Beau--ootiful Soo--oop, Soo--oop of the e-e-evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup." WHITE RABBIT [_Enters, stretching out a red and white checked sash with which he separates ALICE from the creatures._] Check! MOCK TURTLE They won't let her stay in our square. WHITE RABBIT The Queen is coming this way. GRYPHON She'll chop our heads off. Come on, come on, let's fly! [_The MOCK TURTLE and GRYPHON grab ALICE and fly into the air._] CURTAIN [_The Curtain rises to reveal small silhouettes of the GRYPHON, MOCK TURTLE, and ALICE in an orange-colored moon far away in the sky. Down below the WHITE RABBIT is shouting to them, "You'll be safe in the March Hare's garden."_] CURTAIN ACT II SCENE _The March Hare's garden, showing part of the Duchess' house. On a small platform there is a tea table, set with many cups, continuing into wings to give impression of limitless length. THE MARCH HARE, HATTER, and DORMOUSE are crowded at one end. ALICE sits on the ground where she has been dropped from the sky. Finding herself not bruised she rises and approaches the table._ MARCH HARE and HATTER No room! No room! ALICE There's plenty of room! [_She sits in a large armchair at one end of the table._] I don't know who you are. MARCH HARE I am the March Hare, that's the Hatter, and this is the Dormouse. Have some wine? ALICE I don't see any wine. MARCH HARE There isn't any. ALICE Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it. MARCH HARE It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited. ALICE I didn't know it was _your_ table; it's laid for a great many more than three. HATTER Your hair wants cutting. ALICE You should learn not to make personal remarks; it's very rude. HATTER Why is a raven like a writing-desk? ALICE Come, we shall have some fun now! I'm glad you've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that. MARCH HARE So you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it? [Illustration: HATTER: Your hair wants cutting.] ALICE Exactly so. MARCH HARE Then you should say what you mean. ALICE I do; at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know. HATTER Not the same thing a bit! Why, you might just as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as, "I eat what I see!" MARCH HARE You might just as well say that "I like what I get," is the same thing as "I get what I like." DORMOUSE You might just as well say that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing as "I sleep when I breathe." HATTER It _is_ the same thing with you. [_Takes out his watch, looks at it uneasily, shakes it, holds it to his ear._] What day of the month is it? ALICE The fourth. HATTER Two days wrong. I told you butter wouldn't suit the works! MARCH HARE It was the _best_ butter. HATTER Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well; you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife-- MARCH HARE [_Takes the watch, looks at it gloomily, dips it into his cup of tea and looks at it again but doesn't know what else to say._] It was the _best_ butter, you know. ALICE What a funny watch! It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is. HATTER Why should it? Does _your_ watch tell you what year it is? ALICE Of course not, but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together. HATTER Which is just the case with _mine_. ALICE I don't quite understand you. What you said had no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English. HATTER [_Pouring some hot tea on the DORMOUSE'S nose._] The Dormouse is asleep again. DORMOUSE Of course, of course, just what I was going to remark myself. HATTER Have you guessed the riddle yet? ALICE No, I give it up, what's the answer? HATTER I haven't the slightest idea. MARCH HARE Nor I. ALICE I think you might do something better with the time, than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers. HATTER If you knew Time as well as I do, you wouldn't talk about wasting _it_. It's _him_. ALICE I don't know what you mean. HATTER Of course you don't. I dare say you never even spoke to Time. ALICE Perhaps not, but I know I have to beat time when I learn music. HATTER Ah, that accounts for it. He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons. You'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half past one, time for dinner. MARCH HARE I only wish it was. ALICE That would be grand, certainly, but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know. HATTER Not at first, perhaps, but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked. ALICE Is that the way _you_ manage? HATTER Not I, we quarreled last March--just before _he_ went mad, you know. It was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing. "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you're at!" You know the song, perhaps. ALICE I've heard something like it. DORMOUSE Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle-- HATTER Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his head!" ALICE How dreadfully savage! HATTER And ever since that, he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now. ALICE Is that the reason so many tea things are put out here? HATTER Yes, that's it; it's always tea time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles. ALICE Then you keep moving round, I suppose? HATTER Exactly so, as the things get used up. ALICE But when you come to the beginning again? MARCH HARE Suppose we change the subject. I vote the young lady tells us a story. ALICE I'm afraid I don't know one. MARCH HARE and HATTER Then the Dormouse shall. Wake up Dormouse. [_They pinch him on both sides at once._] DORMOUSE [_Opens his eyes slowly and says in a hoarse, feeble voice._] I wasn't asleep, I heard every word you fellows were saying. MARCH HARE Tell us a story. ALICE Yes, please do! HATTER And be quick about it, or you'll be asleep again before it's done. DORMOUSE Once upon a time there were three little sisters, and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well-- ALICE What did they live on? [Illustration] DORMOUSE They lived on treacle. ALICE They couldn't have done that, you know, they'd have been ill. DORMOUSE So they were, _very_ ill. ALICE But why did they live at the bottom of a well? MARCH HARE Take some more tea. ALICE I've had nothing yet, so I can't take more. HATTER You mean, you can't take _less_; it's very easy to take _more_ than nothing. ALICE Nobody asked _your_ opinion. HATTER Who's making personal remarks now? ALICE [_Helps herself to tea and bread and butter._] Why did they live at the bottom of a well? DORMOUSE [_Takes a minute or two to think._] It was a treacle-well. ALICE There's no such thing! HATTER and MARCH HARE Sh! Sh! DORMOUSE If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself. ALICE [_Very humbly._] No, please go on. I won't interrupt you again. I dare say there may be _one_. DORMOUSE One, indeed! And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know-- ALICE What did they draw? DORMOUSE Treacle. HATTER I want a clean cup. Let's all move one place on. [_HATTER moves on, DORMOUSE takes his place, MARCH HARE takes DORMOUSE'S place and ALICE unwillingly takes MARCH HARE'S place._] ALICE I'm worse off than I was before. You've upset the milk jug into your plate. MARCH HARE It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited. ALICE Where did they draw the treacle from? HATTER You can draw water out of a water well, so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well--eh, stupid? ALICE But they were _in_ the well. DORMOUSE Of course they were--well in. They were learning to draw, and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M-- ALICE Why with an M? [Illustration] MARCH HARE Why not? [_ALICE is silent and confused. HATTER pinches DORMOUSE to wake him up._] DORMOUSE [_Wakes with a little shriek and continues._] --that begins with an M, such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchness--you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness? HATTER Did you? ALICE Really now you ask me, I don't think-- HATTER Then you shouldn't talk. MARCH HARE No! ALICE [_Rises and walks away._] You are very rude. It's the stupidest tea party I ever was at in all my life-- [_WHITE RABBIT enters carrying a huge envelope with a seal and crown on it._] MARCH HARE and HATTER No room! no room! [_Rabbit pays no attention to them but goes to the house and raps loudly. A footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and powdered hair opens the door._] WHITE RABBIT For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet. FROG From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet. [_WHITE RABBIT bows and goes out._] MARCH HARE and HATTER [_To WHITE RABBIT._] No room! No room! No room! [_The FROG disappears into the house but leaves the door open. There is a terrible din and many sauce pans fly out._] MARCH HARE She's at it again. HATTER It's perfectly disgusting. MARCH HARE Let's move on. [_The platform moves off with table, chairs, MARCH HARE, HATTER, and DORMOUSE. Meanwhile the FROG has come out again and is sitting near the closed door, staring stupidly at the sky. ALICE goes to the door timidly and knocks._] FROG There's no sort of use in knocking, and that for two reasons: first, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you. ALICE Please then, how am I to get in? FROG There might be some sense in your knocking if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know. ALICE How am I to get in? FROG I shall sit here, till tomorrow. [_The door opens and a large plate skims out straight at the FROG'S head; it grazes his nose and breaks into pieces._] [_FROG acts as if nothing had happened._] Or next day, maybe. ALICE How am I to get in? FROG _Are_ you to get in at all? That's the first question, you know. ALICE It's really dreadful the way all you creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy. FROG I shall sit here, on and off, for days and days. ALICE But what am I to do? FROG Anything you like. [_He begins to whistle._] ALICE Where's the servant whose business it is to answer the door? FROG Which door? ALICE _This_ door, of course! [Illustration: FROG: I shall sit here till tomorrow.] [_The FROG looks at the door, and rubs his thumb on it to see if the paint will come off._] [Illustration] FROG To answer the door? What's it been asking for? ALICE I don't know what you mean. FROG I speaks English, doesn't I? Or are you deaf? What did it ask you? ALICE Nothing! I've been knocking at it. FROG Shouldn't do that--shouldn't do that, vexes it, you know. [_He kicks the door._] You let _it_ alone, and it'll let _you_ alone, you know. ALICE Oh, there's no use talking to you-- [_She starts to open the door just as the DUCHESS comes out carrying a pig in baby's clothes. She sneezes--FROG sneezes and ALICE sneezes._] DUCHESS If everybody minded her own business-- [_She sneezes._] ALICE It's pepper. DUCHESS Of course, my cook puts it in the soup. ALICE There's certainly too much pepper in the soup. DUCHESS Sneeze then and get rid of it! [_DUCHESS begins to sing to the baby, giving it a violent shake at the end of every line of the lullaby._] "Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes; [_FROG and ALICE sneeze._] He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases. [_DUCHESS sneezes, FROG sneezes, ALICE sneezes._] I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; [_FROG sneezes, ALICE sneezes._] For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!" [_DUCHESS sneezes, FROG sneezes, ALICE sneezes, DUCHESS gasps and gives a tremendous sneeze._] ALICE Oh dear! [_She jumps aside as kettles and pots come flying out of the door. The DUCHESS pays no attention._] What a cook to have! [_She calls inside._] Oh! _please_ mind what you're doing! [_Another pan comes out and almost hits the baby._] Oh! there goes his _precious_ nose! DUCHESS If everybody minded her own business, the world would go round a deal faster than it does. ALICE Which would not be an advantage. Just think what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis-- DUCHESS Talking of axes, chop off her head! [_The head of a grinning Cheshire cat appears in a tree above a wall._] ALICE Oh, what's that? DUCHESS Cat, of course. ALICE Why does it grin like that? DUCHESS It's a Cheshire cat! and that's why. [_To baby._] Pig! [Illustration: DUCHESS: I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes.] ALICE I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats _could_ grin. DUCHESS They all can and most of 'em do. ALICE I don't know of any that do. DUCHESS You don't know much and that's a fact. Here, you may nurse it a bit, if you like! [_Flings the baby at ALICE._] I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen. [_She goes into the house._] ALICE If I don't take this child away with me, they're sure to kill it in a day or two. Cheshire Puss, would you tell me please, which way I ought to walk from here? CAT That depends a good deal on where you want to get to. ALICE I don't much care where-- CAT Then it doesn't matter which way you walk. ALICE So long as I get _somewhere_. CAT Oh, you're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough. ALICE Please, will you tell me what sort of people live about here? CAT All mad people. ALICE But I don't want to go among mad people. CAT Oh, you can't help that; we're all mad here. I'm mad. He's mad. He's dreaming now, and what do you think he's dreaming about? ALICE [_Goes to the FROG to scrutinize his face._] Nobody could guess that. CAT Why, about you! And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be? ALICE Where I am now, of course. CAT Not you. You'd be nowhere. Why, you're only a sort of thing in his dream; and you're mad too. ALICE How do you know I'm mad? CAT You must be, or you wouldn't have come here. ALICE How do you know that you're mad? CAT To begin with, a dog's not mad. You grant that? ALICE I suppose so. CAT Well then, you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad. ALICE I call it purring, not growling. [Illustration] CAT Call it what you like. Do you play croquet with the Queen today? ALICE I should like it very much, but I haven't been invited yet. CAT You'll see me there. [_Vanishes._] ALICE [_To squirming baby._] Oh, dear, it's heavy and so ugly. Don't grunt--Oh--Oh--it's a--pig. Please Mr. Footman take it! FROG [_Rises with dignity, whistles and disappears into the house; a kettle comes bounding out. ALICE puts pig down and it crawls off._] CAT [_Appearing again._] By-the-bye, what became of the baby? ALICE It turned into a pig. CAT I thought it would. [_Vanishes._] [_FROG comes out of the house with hedgehogs and flamingoes._] CAT [_Reappearing._] Did you say pig, or fig? ALICE I said pig; and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly; you make one quite giddy. CAT All right. [_It vanishes slowly._] [_FROG puts flamingoes down and reenters house. While ALICE is examining the flamingoes curiously, TWEEDLEDUM and TWEEDLEDEE, each with an arm round the other's neck, sidestep in and stand looking at ALICE._] ALICE [_Turns, sees them, starts in surprise and involuntarily whispers._] Tweedle--dee. DUM Dum! DEE If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay. DUM Contrariwise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak. DEE The first thing in a visit is to say "How d'ye do?" and shake hands! [_The brothers give each other a hug, then hold out the two hands that are free, to shake hands with her. ALICE does not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of hurting the other one's feelings; she takes hold of both hands at once and they all dance round in a ring, quite naturally to music, "Here we go round the mulberry bush."_] ALICE Would you tell me which road leads out of-- DEE What shall I repeat to her? DUM The "Walrus and the Carpenter" is the longest. [_Gives his brother an affectionate hug._] DEE The sun was shining-- ALICE If it's very long, would you please tell me first which road-- DEE The moon was shining sulkily. DUM The sea was wet as wet could be-- DEE O Oysters, come and walk with us The Walrus did beseech-- DUM [_Looks at DEE._] A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, Along the briny beach-- DEE [_Looks at DUM._] The eldest Oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head-- DUM [_Looks at DEE._] Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed. DEE But four young Oysters hurried up And yet another four-- DUM And thick and fast they came at last, And more, and more, and more-- DEE The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, DUM And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low, DEE And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row. DUM "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said, "Is what we chiefly need. DEE Now if you're ready, Oysters dear, We can begin to feed." DUM "But not on us!" the Oysters cried, Turning a little blue. DEE "The night is fine," the Walrus said, "Do you admire the view?" DUM The Carpenter said nothing but "Cut us another slice. I wish you were not quite so deaf-- I've had to ask you twice!" DEE "It seems a shame," the Walrus said, "To play them such a trick, After we've brought them out so far, And made them trot so quick!" DUM "O, Oysters," said the Carpenter, "You've had a pleasant run! DEE Shall we be trotting home again?" DUM But answer came there none-- DEE And this was scarcely odd, because DUM They'd eaten every-- DEE [_Interrupts in a passion, pointing to a white rattle on the ground._] Do you see _that_? ALICE It's only a rattle-- DUM [_Stamps wildly and tears his hair._] I knew it was! It's spoilt of course. My nice new rattle! [_To DEE._] You agree to have a battle? [_He collects sauce pans and pots._] DEE [_Picks up a sauce pan._] I suppose so. Let's fight till dinner. [_They go out hand in hand._] ALICE [_Hears music._] I wonder what is going to happen next. [_She backs down stage respectfully as the KING and QUEEN OF HEARTS enter, followed by the KNAVE OF HEARTS carrying the KING'S crown on a crimson velvet cushion, and the WHITE RABBIT and others. When they come opposite to ALICE they stop and look at her._] [_The DUCHESS comes out of her house._] QUEEN [_To the KNAVE._] Who is this? [Illustration] KNAVE [_Bows three times, smiles and giggles._] QUEEN Idiot! What's your name, child? ALICE My name is Alice, so please your Majesty. QUEEN Off with her head! Off-- ALICE Nonsense! KING Consider, my dear, she is only a child. QUEEN Can you play croquet? ALICE Yes. QUEEN Come on then. Get to your places. Where are the mallets? DUCHESS Here. [_The FROG appears with the flamingoes and hedgehogs._] QUEEN Off with his head! [_No one pays any attention._] KNAVE What fun! ALICE What is the fun? KNAVE Why she; it's all her fancy, that. They never execute anyone. ALICE What does one do? QUEEN Get to your places! [_She takes a flamingo, uses its neck as a mallet and a hedgehog as a ball. The FROG doubles himself into an arch. The KING does the same with the followers and the KNAVE offers himself as an arch for ALICE. Even though ALICE does not notice him he holds the arch position. The QUEEN shouts at intervals, "Off with his head, off with her head."_] ALICE Where are the Chess Queens? RABBIT Under sentence of execution. ALICE What for? RABBIT Did you say, "what a pity"? ALICE No, I didn't. I don't think it's at all a pity. I said, "What for?" RABBIT They boxed the Queen's ears. [_ALICE gives a little scream of laughter._] RABBIT Oh, hush! The Queen will hear you! You see they came rather late and the Queen said--Oh dear, the Queen hears me-- [_He hurries away._] ALICE [_Noticing the KNAVE who still pretends to be an arch._] How _can_ you go on thinking so quietly, with your head downwards? KNAVE What does it matter where my body happens to be? My mind goes on working just the same. The fact of it is, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep on inventing new things. KING Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood? ALICE Yes, I did; several thousand I should think. KING Four thousand, two hundred and seven, that's the exact number. They couldn't send all the horses, you know, because two of them are wanted in the game. And I haven't sent the two messengers, either. ALICE What's the war about? KING The red Chess King has the whole army against us but he can't kill a man who has thirteen hearts. [_The DUCHESS, QUEEN, FROG, and followers go out. The KNAVE and the FIVE-SPOT, SEVEN-SPOT, and NINE-SPOT OF HEARTS stand behind the KING._] [Illustration: KING: I only wish I had such eyes; to be able to see Nobody!] KING Just look along the road and tell me if you can see either of my messengers. ALICE I see nobody on the road. KING I only wish I had such eyes; to be able to see Nobody! And at that distance too! Why, it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light. ALICE I see somebody now! But he's coming very slowly--and what curious attitudes he goes into--skipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel. KING Not at all, those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when he's happy. I must have two messengers, you know--to come and go. One to come and one to go. ALICE I beg your pardon? KING It isn't respectable to beg. ALICE I only meant that I didn't understand. Why one to come and one to go? KING Don't I tell you? I must have two--to fetch and carry. One to fetch, and one to carry. MARCH HARE [_Enters, pants for breath--waves his hands about and makes fearful faces at the KING._] KING You alarm me! I feel faint--give me a ham sandwich. Another sandwich! MARCH HARE There's nothing but hay left now. KING Hay, then. There's nothing like eating hay when you're faint. ALICE I should think throwing cold water over you would be better. KING I didn't say there was nothing _better_; I said there was nothing _like_ it. KING Who did you pass on the road? MARCH HARE Nobody. KING Quite right; this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slower than you. MARCH HARE I do my best; I'm sure nobody walks much faster than I do. KING He can't do that; or else he'd have been here first. However, now you've got your breath, you may tell us what's happened in the town. MARCH HARE I'll whisper it. [_Much to ALICE'S surprise, he shouts into the KING'S ear._] They're at it again! KING Do you call _that_ a whisper? If you do such a thing again, I'll have you buttered. It went through and through my head like an earthquake. Give me details, quick! [_The KING and MARCH HARE go out, followed by FIVE, SEVEN, and NINE SPOTS._] DUCHESS [_Runs in and tucks her arm affectionately into ALICE'S._] You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing! ALICE Oh! DUCHESS You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit. ALICE Perhaps it hasn't one. DUCHESS Tut, tut, child! Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it. [_Squeezes closely, digs her chin into ALICE'S shoulder, and roughly drags ALICE along for a walk._] ALICE The game's going on rather better now. DUCHESS 'Tis so, and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!" ALICE Somebody said, that it's done by everybody minding their own business. DUCHESS Ah, well! It means much the same thing, and the moral of _that_ is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves." ALICE How fond you are of finding morals in things. DUCHESS I daresay you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist. The reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment? ALICE He might bite. DUCHESS Very true; flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together." ALICE Only mustard isn't a bird. DUCHESS Right, as usual; what a clear way you have of putting things. ALICE It's a mineral, I _think_. DUCHESS Of course it is; there's a large mustard mine near here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours." ALICE Oh! I know, it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is. DUCHESS I quite agree with you, and the moral of that is--"Be what you would seem to be;" or, if you'd like it put more simply, "Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise." ALICE I think I should understand that better if I had it written down, but I can't quite follow it as you say it. DUCHESS That's nothing to what I could say if I chose. ALICE Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that. DUCHESS Oh, don't talk about trouble; I make you a present of everything I've said as yet. ALICE Uhm! DUCHESS Thinking again? ALICE I've got a right to think. DUCHESS Just about as much right as pigs have to fly, and the moral-- [_The arm of the DUCHESS begins to tremble and her voice dies down. The QUEEN OF HEARTS stands before them with folded arms and frowning like a thunderstorm._] DUCHESS A fine day, your Majesty. QUEEN Now, I give you fair warning, either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your choice! [_The DUCHESS goes meekly into the house._] [Illustration] QUEEN Let's go on with the game. [_She goes off and shouts at intervals, "Off with his head; off with her head."_] CAT How are you getting on? ALICE It's no use speaking to you till your ears have come. I don't think they play at all fairly and they all quarrel so and they don't seem to have any rules in particular. And you've no idea how confusing it is with all the things alive; there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming. [_Music begins._] CAT How do you like the Queen? ALICE Not at all; she's so extremely-- [_The KING, QUEEN and entire court enter. The QUEEN is near to ALICE. The music stops and all look at ALICE questioningly._] [_ALICE tries to propitiate the QUEEN._] --likely to win, [_Music continues._] that it's hardly worth while finishing the game. [_QUEEN smiles and passes on._] KING Who _are_ you talking to? ALICE It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat--allow me to introduce it. KING I don't like the look of it at all; however, it may kiss my hand if it likes. CAT I'd rather not. KING Don't be impertinent and don't look at me like that. ALICE A cat may look at a king. I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where. KING Well, it must be removed. My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed. QUEEN Off with his head! KNAVE But you can't cut off a head unless there's a body to cut it off from. KING Anything that has a head can be beheaded. QUEEN If something isn't done about it in less than no time, I'll have everybody executed, all round. ALICE It belongs to the Duchess; you'd better ask her about it. DUCHESS It's a lie! CAT You'd better ask me. Do it if you can. [_It grins away. The DUCHESS and FROG escape into the house._] QUEEN Cut it off! KING It's gone. EVERYBODY It's gone! It's gone! Where, where, where-- QUEEN Cut it off. Cut them all off! EVERYBODY No, no, no! ALICE Save me, save me! KNAVE [_Shouts to ALICE and gives her a tart for safety._] Take a tart! QUEEN [_Seeing ALICE stand out a moment from the others._] Cut hers off! Cut hers off! OTHERS [_Glad to distract QUEEN'S attention from themselves._] Cut hers off, cut hers off, cut-- ALICE [_Cries in fear and takes a quick bite at the tart. If there is a trap door on the stage ALICE disappears down it, leaving the crowd circling around the hole screaming and amazed. If the stage has no trap door, a bridge is built across the footlights with stairs leading down into the orchestra pit. When the crowd is chasing ALICE she jumps over the footlights onto the bridge and as the curtain is falling dividing her from the crowd she appeals to the audience, "Save me, save me, who will save me?" and runs down the stairs and disappears._] CURTAIN ACT III SCENE ONE _Is a garden of high, very conventional and artificial looking flowers. On a large mushroom sits the CATERPILLAR smoking a hookah. ALICE is whirling about trying to get her equilibrium after her fall. She goes to the mushroom timidly and, conscious of her size, for her chin reaches the top of the mushroom, she gazes at the CATERPILLAR wonderingly. He looks at her lazily and speaks in a languid voice._ CATERPILLAR Who are you? ALICE I--I hardly know, sir, just at present. The Queen frightened me so and I've had an awfully funny fall down a tunnel or a sort of well. At least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then. CATERPILLAR What do you mean by that? Explain yourself. ALICE I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, Sir, because I'm not myself, you see. Being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing. [Illustration] CATERPILLAR You! Who are you? ALICE I think you ought to tell me who you are, first. CATERPILLAR Why? [_As ALICE turns away._] Come back. I've something important to say. [_ALICE comes back._] Keep your temper. ALICE Is that all? CATERPILLAR No. [_He puffs at the hookah in silence; finally takes it out of his mouth and unfolds his arms._] So you think you're changed, do you? ALICE I'm afraid I am, Sir; I don't keep the same size. CATERPILLAR What size do you want to be? ALICE I don't know. At least I've never been so small as a caterpillar. CATERPILLAR [_Rears angrily._] It is a very good height indeed. ALICE But I'm not used to it; I wish you wouldn't all be so easily offended. CATERPILLAR You'll get used to it in time. ALICE Are you too big or am I too small? [_She compares her height wonderingly with the tall flowers._] CATERPILLAR [_Looks at her sleepily, yawns, shakes himself, slides down from the mushroom and crawls slowly away._] One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter. ALICE One side of what? The other side of what? CATERPILLAR Of the mushroom. [_ALICE hesitates, then embraces mushroom and picks bit from each side._] [_Three gardeners representing spades enter carrying brushes and red paint cans._] TWO-SPOT Look out now, Five. Don't go splashing paint over me like that. FIVE-SPOT I couldn't help it. Seven jogged my elbow. SEVEN-SPOT That's right, Five, always lay the blame on others. FIVE-SPOT You'd better not talk. I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded. TWO-SPOT What for? SEVEN-SPOT That's none of your business, Two. FIVE-SPOT Yes, it is his business, and I'll tell him. It was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions. SEVEN-SPOT Well, of all the unjust things-- [_Sees ALICE; others look around, all bow._] ALICE Could you please tell me what side to eat? [_FIVE and SEVEN look at TWO._] TWO-SPOT I don't know anything about it. [_He paints a white rose, red._] You ought to have been red, we put you in by mistake, and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off. [_A thumping is heard off stage and the music grows louder and louder._] ALICE What's that? FIVE-SPOT The White Chess Queen. SEVEN-SPOT Don't let her see what we are doing. TWO-SPOT She'll tell on us. SEVEN-SPOT Run out and stop her from coming here. FIVE-SPOT [_To ALICE as she runs to the right._] No, no, the other way. ALICE But she's off there! TWO-SPOT You can only meet her by walking the other way. ALICE Oh! what nonsense. ALL THE GARDENERS Go the other way! ALICE [_Re-enters in dismay and dashes out to the left._] She's running away from me. [_The WHITE QUEEN backs in from right and ALICE backs in from left. They meet. The gardeners cry "The Queen" and throw themselves flat upon the ground; their backs are like the backs of the rest of the pack. Music stops. ALICE looks at the QUEEN curiously._] ALICE Oh, there you are! Why, I'm just the size I was when I saw you last. WHITE QUEEN Of course you are, and who are these? I can't tell them by their backs. [_She turns them over with her foot._] Turn over. Ah! I thought so! Get up! What have you been doing here? TWO-SPOT May it please your Majesty, we were trying-- WHITE QUEEN [_Examines rose._] I see! Begone, or I'll send the horses after you, and tell the Queen of Hearts. [_GARDENERS rush off. The RED QUEEN enters. ALICE has gone to the mushroom again to look at its sides and there to her amazement finds a gold crown and scepter, which she immediately appropriates. Music. The QUEENS watch ALICE superciliously. ALICE puts on her crown, proudly exclaiming in great elation, "Queen Alice," and walks down stage bowing right and left to the homage of imaginary subjects. She repeats as if scarcely daring to believe it true, "Queen Alice." Music stops._] RED QUEEN Ridiculous! ALICE Isn't this the Eighth Square? RED QUEEN You can't be a Queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination. WHITE QUEEN The sooner we begin it, the better. ALICE Please, would you tell me-- RED QUEEN Speak when you're spoken to. ALICE But if everybody obeyed that rule, and if you only spoke when you were spoken to, and the other person always waited for you to begin, you see nobody would ever say anything, so that-- RED QUEEN Preposterous. ALICE I only said "if." RED QUEEN She says she only said "if." WHITE QUEEN [_Moans and wrings her hands._] But she said a great deal more than that. Ah, yes, so much more than that. RED QUEEN So you did, you know; always speak the truth--think before you speak--and write it down afterwards. ALICE I'm sure I didn't mean-- RED QUEEN That's just what I complained of. You _should_ have meant! What do you suppose is the use of a child without any meaning? Even a joke should have some meaning--and a child's more important than a joke, I hope. You couldn't deny that, even if you tried with both hands. ALICE I don't deny things with my _hands_. RED QUEEN Nobody said you did. I said you couldn't if you tried. WHITE QUEEN She's in that state of mind, that she wants to deny _something_--only she doesn't know what to deny! RED QUEEN A nasty, vicious temper. I invite you to Alice's dinner party this afternoon. WHITE QUEEN And I invite _you_. ALICE I didn't know I was to have a party at all; but if there is to be one, I think I ought to invite the guests. RED QUEEN We gave you the opportunity of doing it, but I dare say you've not had many lessons in manners yet. ALICE Manners are not taught in lessons; lessons teach you to do sums, and things of that sort. WHITE QUEEN Can you do addition? What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one? ALICE I don't know. I lost count. RED QUEEN She can't do addition; can you do subtraction? Take nine from eight. ALICE Nine from eight I can't, you know, but-- WHITE QUEEN She can't do subtraction. Can you do division? Divide a loaf by a knife--what's the answer to that? ALICE I suppose-- RED QUEEN [_Answers for her._] Bread and butter, of course. Try another subtraction sum. Take a bone from a dog; what remains? ALICE The bone wouldn't remain, of course, if I took it--and the dog wouldn't remain; it would come to bite me--and I'm sure I shouldn't remain. RED QUEEN Then you think nothing would remain? ALICE I think that's the answer. RED QUEEN Wrong as usual; the dog's temper would remain. ALICE But I don't see how-- RED QUEEN Why, look here; the dog would lose its temper, wouldn't it? ALICE Perhaps it would. RED QUEEN Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain! ALICE They might go different ways! What dreadful nonsense we _are_ talking. BOTH QUEENS She can't do sums a bit! ALICE Can _you_ do sums? WHITE QUEEN I can do addition, if you give me time--but I can't do _subtraction_ under _any_ circumstances. RED QUEEN Of course you know your A, B, C? ALICE To be sure I do. WHITE QUEEN So do I; we'll often say it over together, dear. And I'll tell you a secret--I can read words of one letter. Isn't that grand? However, don't be discouraged. You'll come to it in time. RED QUEEN Can you answer useful questions? How is bread made? ALICE I know _that_! You take some flour-- WHITE QUEEN Where do you pick the flower? In a garden or in the hedges? ALICE Well, it isn't _picked_ at all. It's ground-- WHITE QUEEN How many acres of ground? You mustn't leave out so many things. RED QUEEN Fan her head! She'll be feverish after so much thinking. [_They fan her with bunches of leaves which blow her hair wildly._] ALICE Please--please-- RED QUEEN She's all right again now. Do you know languages? What's the French for fiddle-de-dee? ALICE Fiddle-de-dee's not English. RED QUEEN Who ever said it was? ALICE If you tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is, I'll tell you the French for it! RED QUEEN Queens never make bargains! ALICE I wish Queens never asked questions! WHITE QUEEN Don't let us quarrel; what is the cause of lightning? ALICE The cause of lightning is the thunder--no, no! I meant the other way. RED QUEEN It's too late to correct it; when you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences. WHITE QUEEN We had _such_ a thunderstorm next Tuesday, you can't think. RED QUEEN She
