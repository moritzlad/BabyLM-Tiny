MAXIMILIAN KOLBE'S OHUROH IN KRAKOW MISTRZEJOWIOE Dear people! Let us welcome Father Jerzy PopieIuszko from Warsaw! Weak are the people who accept their own defeat. Who have forgotten that they have been delegated to keep watch... But mighty are the people who, in their lives... build on truth... Sister, did you see a green volkswagen, it drove by here, a volkswagen golf? Vagen? No, I didn't see any... You've come for the Mass or for holidays? For the Mass. Then come tomorrow, today's Mass is over. Here... See, he's not here. If he were here, he'd let you in. Show this letter at the sacristy, maybe you'II find him there. I can't accept this letter. I don't have the appropriate charism. Yes... But it's not stamped by the Ohancery Office... Father PopieIuszko is a dependent of the Bishop, he's just a resident here. Go to the Bishop's Office. Good morning. - Forever and ever, amen. - We've got a summons to appear. Sister, stay with us, please. Jerzy PopieIuszko... Is summoned to appear in person as a susp... It's illegible here... Anyway, it's up to the Bishop. Yes, but it says here it's for 9 o'cIock in the morning, and it's almost noon. Minister, we have a connection... ExceIIency, it's about a two-hour interrogation. Why play hide and seek? Let us do it... and I promise you he'II be released as soon as it's finished. I take you at your word, Minister. OouId everybody please leave the hallway! Why? We want to wait here. Out! Go out, I said! This is not a waiting room. We want to stay here. - What's your name? - What, are you trying to bully me? - I want to check your papers. - I won't be intimidated! Show me your ID, please. Now! You must leave now. Why didn't the suspect respond to numerous summonses to appear? Because the summonses were delivered to me dishonestIy. They shouldn't be delivered by 1 2 men and I should receive them at Ieast one day in advance, since I have my duties, besides, I'm subordinate to Ohurch authorities, which means that I must notify them about being summoned. Does the suspect preach in StanisIaw Kostka's church only or also in other churches in Warsaw or at other locations? As a OathoIic priest, I am entitled to say holy Mass anywhere in the world. I refuse to answer the question whether I say Mass or preach anywhere else in Warsaw or in poland. Did the suspect order the decorations and symbols relating to the banned trade union "solidarity" to be installed in the church? The suspect refuses to answer the question. - No, I'm silent. - please record: the suspect is silent. Does the liturgy allow you to deform the host? I think she's talking about the letter "V". Why did the suspect name his dog Snitch? I liked it better than Secret policeman. Are you deaf? - Out! - Excuse me! You're talking to a polish clergyman, son! Every pole in the Iast thousand years has known at Ieast how to address a priest! You speak polish? ! Then speak polish! OounseIIor, I'II take the blame. Maybe you'II need to do that at some point. - Move away! - gentlemen, there's no need for that. I'm sorry but I must leave you now. I have other engagements. No problem. God bless you, OounseIIor. Jurek, I'm really sorry, I have a hearing... I'm the defense counsel so I'm obliged to be present. OK, go. Thanks a Iot. We're going to the suspect's apartment on OhIodna street to undertake a search. - Wait a moment, I have no keys on me. - Ah, you don't have the keys? I'II have a friend of mine get them from the church, I'II just write a note. He's at the front entrance... - Besides... - Yes? I want him to come with me as a witness. - gentlemen, this is going too far... - How much is in here? Lieutenant, take down the evidence. Lieutenant, write down the following, please: Note that one of the officers headed directly towards places where he found incriminating evidence, as if he knew it wouId be there. Recognize this? Madame Prosecutor, please check whose fingerprints are on the wrappings. finally. Do a closeup here... And here. Where are you going? To the bathroom. I consider this provocation an ordeal sent by God to improve the effects of my patriotic and religious work... I have always propagated truth. I do not wish to be used to provoke people to come out to the streets. I will not divulge anything at the hearings, I will not give anybody away. I ask you to pray for my endurance. You are under arrest. December 1 2 1 983 December 1 2 1 983 Take all your clothes off. OouId you repeat, please, I didn't understand you. You're going to be strip-searched. Take off your clothes, Father. Why do I have to do this... - Praised be Jesus Ohrist. - What for? Abuse of freedom of conscience. - article? - 1 94. - That's now and ever shall be. - For shorter than that I hope... I'm Jerzy... a priest. I'm Krzys. I beat my woman to death and threw her in the VistuIa. I'm Adam. I ran four people down with my locomotive I'm innocent, and won't have my name trampled on... I'm Staszek, burglary. alright, so it's all devils and one angel here. Me, I drove my wife to the river with a stick! pleasure to meet you gentlemen. If you're in need of ministry, feel free to let me know. I haven't been excommunicated. Father... Yes? I'm not sure where to start. When was the Iast time you've been to confession? Ten, maybe fifteen years ago... Oonfess your sins. Father, the guy with the mustache is no railway worker. Look at his pants, they're no railway worker's pants, they're miIitiaman's pants. He's a snitch, the worst kind. I beat the crap out of him. If he fools around again he'II bite the dust... We'II talk about your achievements afterwards. Now I'd Iike to hear your sins. Dammit, Father, I see you're a believer... The authorities have approved Father's release. However, the future proceedings of the Prosecutor's Office will depend on Father's line of activity. The authorities? And this is a summons for a new hearing. God bless. Good to see you. Let's talk. You seek renown among workers, do you really need that? What are you trying to do? We have many priests who work as passionately as you do. But I also lecture, people listen to me. I hear confessions every day... More people line up to my confessional than to anybody else's. You have long lineups and you think here's nobody else but you... Others also have pastoral achievements, but they don't make so much noise. Why don't you request to be transferred? We could think of another area for you to work in... Father Jerzy PopieIuszko forcefully denied his guilt, but did not act like a man confident of his own innocence, ignored the Prosecutor's summonses for fear of facing the charges. Who signed it? A michael Ostrowski. The good aunt who had given the apartment to Father as a present turned out to be a fairy tale for naive parishioners. It has been proven beyond any doubt that, at the age of 22 Father PopieIuszko... This is rubbish! He studied in the seminary when he was 22. Stop throwing this dirt around! What do you mean he never worked in the paper? The article is signed by him! hello... - Witek, be quiet! - The coward hung up. ...hiding from his superiors the fact that he has a private apartment and a secret life... What channel was that? One? I heard it on Four in the morning. No, I don't think it was some editor's idea. It must have been ordered by somebody at the top. The OentraI Oommittee or the politburo, or the government. Jurek! Why are you so soft? Why don't you denounce them by name: Minister Urban, general JaruzeIski, general Kiszczak! You think so too? Yes. - AII of you? - Yes, Jurek. It's time to stop preaching a soft gospel My God. There's so many of you... you're all my friends, and you don't understand anything? I combat evil, not the victims of evil. God... people's lives are so much alike Grey, tough Sometimesgrim... It would be unbearable but for the little glimmers of joy of your presence Signs... That you are here with us. Oome in, Father. Father KaroI WojtyIa stayed and worked in this room, Bishop WojtyIa after that, and then OardinaI WojtyIa... "So you are a king," said PiIate. Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this I was born and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth Every one who is of the truth. hears my voice." - hello. - God bless you. "What is truth?", PiIate asked. - hello. - God bless you. God bless! Your excellency! What a coincidence. What are you doing here? I'm on my way back from Rome and have stopped over in Zakopane. The Pope says that, in the plans of Divine Providence, there are no mere coincidences. Your excellency talked with the Pope? The holy Father inquired about you... I told him the secret police had a list of one hundred priests considered the most troublesome. I'm on this list... but you're number one. The Pope read your homilies. Did he say anything? Not much... He just said, "Give him this rosary from me." Snitch, Iet's have a photo together. Look that way, at those gentlemen. - Praise the Lord Jesus Ohrist. - Forever and ever, Amen. What's going on, Professor? I've heard rumors that the Primate wants you to study in Rome. Me? To study? I barely scraped through seminary. - You'd be safe there. - would you go? It's Anna. I've brought the sermons I have them typed. Great, this is the rest... We'II publish them right away. Did I show you what I already received? Yes. Here's carbon paper... You seem ill at ease, Father... - I lost something... - What? - A little calculator... - What calculator? You know, the one with the solar battery and a cover. Don't worry about that, we'II get you a new one. But it's not about the calculator, Ania, it's not that... But who could have taken it? Look... If the Primate sends me to Rome, take this radio, VOR recorder, TV set, and give them away. I don't want this stuff to sit here and gather dust. I just don't know what to do with those souvenirs. It's Dorota, she says you're expecting her. hello, Jurek. I've got letters from your "fans", may I have a look at them? You wish they were your fans, don't you? Did I show you what I got from the Primate? "To Father PopieIuszko, with blessings!" I've seen this ten times already. I've come to confess. You have to wait a moment. I promised Dorota to pose for my portrait. well, your face a little to the light... Good, to the light... So, Father, did the Primate approve? Approve what? To send you to Rome. What do you mean "approve"? Who asked him? You know, that delegation. What delegation? Excuse me. Father, my son's grown out of his shoes, he has no shoes to wear in school... - I've got no ration cards... - What size? - Eight... Larger than mine. - alright, just a second... I've got a size eight, just slightly worn... Thank you. A Mr. Jarzyna and wife, I don't know him, but he says his wife was beat up... - God bless. - God bless. My husband wasn't allowed into work... The personnel manager showed him a photo from a Mass - and fired him... - How did you get this bruise? She got beat up when she brought flowers to the grave of Grzes. But it's not what we've come to talk about. Before I was fired I went to see a guy who often turns up here. He has a Iot of underground magazines and badges at his place, everything lying in plain view. He names "solidarity" activists out loud... asks a Iot of questions, and acts friendly, calls you by your first name. Be careful around him, I think he collaborates with the secret police. He's talking about Piotr. alright, we'II go now. We wish you that we all may live to see freedom. But I am free. hello, Father Jerzy speaking. Listen preacher, If you stick your ass out of your priesthoIe, neither the Pope nor Reagan will save you. Show up on the pilgrimage and you'II get a bullet. A chilly evening. They went to the Primate? They petitioned him? Father... - How could they do that? - They did it out of concern... They didn't even ask me if I wanted that! You rotten fascist. Your buddies shouIdn't be surprised if they find you with your throat slit open. - You stinking witch... - Hand that over. You won't preach those stupid homiIies of yours any more! - Soon... - Give it to me... Jurek... I hate them. I hate them sons-of... I'II never stop hating them! I'II never stop hating them! You can't... I won't give you absolution. I don't care. Wait... At least try. please, try... Good evening. Look what scared you! The only downside is there's no lemon! Mietek... has agreed to collaborate with the secret police. But he wants it announced during holy Mass. Your Eminence, I can't leave. My dear, if you can or cannot leave is also up to me. And I say you can leave. But the question is... Do you want to leave? Your acquaintances and friends have asked me to make it possible. I understand their concern for your safety. Are you asking me to allow you to leave? No, I'm not. I'II conform to your instructions. As required by the vow of obedience. But do you want me to send you to Rome? If you don't want this, I won't force you. But if you think it wouId be best for you, - consider it. - I can't betray the people. My dear Father Jerzy, we are both priests. We both know we... cannot betray Jesus. You understand that you cannot betray him Do you understand that I can't betray him either? It's Jerzy! Jerzy is here! Why do you hardly ever show up? Doesn't visit at all! They need me there all the time. Mom, every time I eat something you've cooked, the taste lasts for a week. Why do you wolf it down like that? They don't feed you in Warsaw? They do, but you know Mom's cooking always tastes special. WaIdek, tell them they feed me. He gets food from people all the time, but has no time to eat it. Oome on, you shouldn't say things like that. If you come more often, you'd know what taters taste like. Want more? I'm heating up some gravy. If you stay until tomorrow, we'd go pick some mushrooms. I can't. We're getting ready for the pilgrimage of working people to Ozestochowa. I need to create the program, select hymns, so people can sing together, God willing, there'II be people from all over poland. Not bad, this is a workers' state, and you lead the working people to Mother Mary. - They won't forget that. - Be careful, son. Everything they do figures into God's plan. Not to worry. They've left me alone, Z ygmunt's been released. And others from "solidarity", too. You see, they've accepted the fact that the people won't be broken down. - I was granted amnesty, too. - Amnesty? And they keep following you around the village like rabid dogs? ...such as PopieIuszko from Warsaw, keep turning religious services into political meetings against the orders of the Episcopate and our patient warnings that this kind of activity will not be tolerated. Despite the fact that we keep our promises, which poland seems to understand... Shut your mouth, or you look like you're swallowing files. - Right, that's it! - No, Mom, don't go. Let me gaze at you. Go gaze at your Father. I'II go wrap some mushrooms and bread for you... Or Father Pastor will kick you out. Daddy, just promise not to cry for me if they... Hi... How was your trip? - Do you have it? - Sure I do. Look. Jurek, I'm telling you, the people are waiting. AII of poland will hear your words. - Are you saying a homily? - No, only an introduction. - I must go. Bye. - See you. Jurek, my poor little twig. Look. The North has met the South and the heart of poland. Good morning, Mr. Ohairman. Virgin Mary of Ozestochowa... We have heard the graceful voice Upon you we depend... We have heard the graceful voice Of the Virgin Mary calling Oome to me my children The time has come... Dear friends! The First Station. Jesus is condemned to death. Through the cross of Jesus we have all been liberated. Let us beg for liberty for those who have been unlawfully deprived of it. hall Mary, full of grace... Father, are you sure of that? You may have all sorts of problems afterwards. Oh, we're used to problems. please write: The polish Martyr Friars parish, Bydgoszcz. - Friday the 1 9th, right? - Right. Father, there's so many people. This is your achievement. Who knows, maybe we're responsible for it too. We've been praying for you fervently! So many people, what grace! God bless you, Sisters, I ask you all to pray for me... That I'm not alone at my hour of death. - And that there's a witness. - We will pray. - God bless. - OertainIy. They've tracked me. Do you have a copy of the sermon? Yes. If I get detained, take it to the church of the exaltation of the holy Oross. If you're taken into custody, I'm going with you. If need be I'II kick up the biggest commotion ever seen... Ania, calm down. The homily is what matters. Irena will take it, she has another copy. alright, get in the front seat. He conducted a service on the 8th of October in Bytom, at 6:00 in the evening. In his homily he emphasized the significance of human dignity, of the freedom granted by God, and the ability to differentiate between truth and falsehood. He promoted prayer and the education of children in the spirit of love for God and for the homeland. The hymn "God save poland" was sung with the verse, "Return our free homeland to us, Lord." Hundreds of people raised their hands making the "V" sign with their fingers. Father PopieIuszko responded to questions: "Do you see any point in what you are doing?" "If I didn't see a point, I wouldn't be doing this." "What do you think is poland's future? Do you believe in our country's rebirth?" "The future is in our hands. I think it isn't only me who believes this, we all do." MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS Here's the cryptogram you requested. "The actions of the clergy." Thank you. I have information that PopieIuszko will be in Gdansk on the 1 3th. Is it reliable? It's based on multiple sources. OCTOBER 1 3 1 984 - What was that? - should we go and see? No. There's three of us. What if it was an assassination attempt? especially then, we shouldn't stop. Oan I come in? Listen, I talked to Irek, I've got a car, we'II be going to Bydgoszcz with you. Are you out of your mind? ! You're not going anywhere. You have two kids, you're staying home. Are you hungry? I am, but I'II be home in a minute and grab a bite. Wait. I've got mushrooms from my father in Okopy. I'II make you something to eat. How are your kids? Has Kasia got used to the new school? She still complains a little but she's getting better. And how's Arek? Arek's fine. He's upset about his pimples. I told him they'd go away. pimples? Sure they'II go away. I have to go... - hello. - Hi... Lamb of God, Who takes away the sin of the world, have mercy on us May the Body of Ohrist lead me to eternal life... May the blood of Ohrist lead me to eternal life. Take a deep breath... Oome, Snitch, you're staying with me today. Be a good boy and don't make a fuss. Nothing new, same old wheezes... You won't get rid of them until ripe old age. Jerzy, I'II stay here with Anna for a while. We'II hang around the windows and create some movement. OCTOBER 1 9 1 984 John paul II turned to Our Lady of Ozestochowa with the following prayer, "I thank you, holy Mother, for those who are not defeated by evil and who fight evil with good." hall Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. holy Mary, Mother of God... To fight evil with good we must nourish the virtue of fortitude. "Woe to a society," cried the Primate of the millennium, "that is not governed by fortitude." Let us pray to God that he free us of fear and intimidation, but first and foremost, that He free us of the desire for violence and retaliation. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name... Stop the car. pull over. Step out of the car. - What for? I'm a passenger. - For an identity check. I'II show you my ID. Don't obstruct official procedures. We need to go to the radio-teIephone.

Piotr, take this one. Did you have it translated? "The more the man's truth and love, the more justice" - Maybe a section of a homily? - Okay... Okay... Wait... Wait... It's OK. It'II be fine. gentlemen, come to the front of the church. "GIVE FATHER JERZY BAOK TO US" Brothers and Sisters, Brothers and Sisters, today, Father Jerzy's body was found in the waters of the WIocIawek Reservoir. Lord, you who have suffered for us. We failed to protect him... What could we do? We failed... Maybe it was meant to happen. - Excuse me... - It's Father Pastor. Father Jerzy, he is the patron of our presence in Europe, for which he sacrificed his life just like Ohrist has done! Like Ohrist! Just like Ohrist he is entitled to be a citizen of the world, of Europe. Because he sacrificed his life for all of us. JUNE 1 4 1 987 In the year 1 985 four security service officers were sentenced for executing the crime on Father Jerzy PopieIuszko. They were all released under amnesty. In the year 201 0 Father Jerzy PopieIuszko was beatified. 'In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate but equally important groups - the police, who investigate crime, and the Crown Prosecutors, who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories.' No, no, no, no. We can't finish any sooner. I'm not a miracle worker. If I was a miracle worker, I'd be on a pleasure boat in Hawaii. Hello? Hello? Bloody developer put the phone down on me. Come here. There's something you should see. And how long's it been empty? About a year. Who owned it before? Council. Young. Eight, nine. Poor kid. What happened? Crawl over the top and fall in? Massive skull fracture. More likely a hit. Not a gentle cuff round the ear, either. Boy or girl? Male. How long's he been there? Matt. Old West Ham badge. I've got one of these. If that's original, that kid's been in there for over 20 years. Could be a mum and dad out there still hoping their son's alive. When I first joined CID, the first week, we had a young girl go missing. She was ten. Name was Shona Morris. I still catch myself looking for her. Who lived in that house? Before 1995, it was privately owned. We need to know who this poor boy is. Get Angie onto it. Merlin database. All the missing children from 1981 to 1984. Oh...that is a lot of kids. About 200 open cases just from last year. Press only feature the pretty ones. Male. Eight years old. Reported missing July 16th, 1983. Thomas Keegan. 59, Kenville Road. Same street the body was found. Says he has a broken collarbone. We're checking for missing kids with similar injuries. Mother Phillipa Keegan. Arthur Keegan was the dad. But he died the year before. 1982. How many losses can one woman take? Dad was born 1939, Upton Park, E15. His dad got him into the Hammers. Sorry? West Ham, called the Hammers because they keep getting hammered. Watch it. Investigating officer DS... McFadden. I'm fluent and illegible. If you look at the last page, they had a suspect - Edward Connor. Oh. Devlin, yeah. The boy in the wall had a broken collarbone. Thank you very much. It's him. Track down Jeffrey McFadden. Game on. So, this is what retired Old Bill get up to, is it? Bet you can't wait. So, anyway, Jeff. This old case of yours. Missing child. 1983. Keegan. Eight years old, blue eyes, brown hair, broken collarbone, West Ham supporter. Blimey. Sounds like you just read the file. You ever done a missing kid? It stays with you, doesn't it? So, the case is alive again? We've found Tom. Tommy. Tommy. Bones in a basement inside a fireplace. Opposite his home. Where the poofter lived? Sorry? Edward Connor. You mean the suspect from the file? He was the last one to see the boy alive. He was mucking about with him on the steps. An hour later, Connor goes for a drive. He did it, but we couldn't nail him, despite going over the boot of his car with a fine-toothed comb. He couldn't tell me where he'd been or who he was with that night. I was sure he'd taken Tommy in the boot of his car for his own...sick pleasure. You didn't search the house? We did, smart-arse. Jeff, sorry. Where can we find Edward Connor? Moved out. Changed his name. Went off radar. Now, if that isn't a sign of guilt, what is? Forensic evidence, maybe? A corpse? OK. So we missed the corpse. But we had the right guy. OK, so we missed the corpse. You're the crappiest copper I ever met. He's a product of his time. There were no good detectives then? You're talking to one. Like I keep telling you, I am special. So, we've got to find Edward Connor, even though he's changed his name? Yeah, but first we need to talk to Tommy's mum. Cos thanks to that bigoted prat, she probably hasn't slept in 25 years. Are you sure it's him? As sure as we can be, ma'am, yeah. I've been waiting for this. But part of me still thought... He was still out there. I know. I'm sorry. We're looking for Edward Connor. Mrs Keegan, at the time, if you remember, he was a suspect. I didn't think it was him. But if Tommy was found in the basement... Let me get you a tissue, ma'am. I hope you don't mind if... I ask you... what you remember about that day. Um... I dropped him off at school. Didn't kiss him. Didn't want to embarrass him. It was my teacher training day, so he was going to a friend's for tea. It was just the two of us, you see, because his dad died the year earlier. Well, I came to pick him up. Joe's Mum called them in. But Joe said they'd argued and Tommy had gone home. And I said, "Not to worry," because we only lived a few streets away, and Tommy was good at crossing roads. And the key was under the mat. But he wasn't at home. I tried the neighbours. And then I called the police. I remember saying to them, "I'm sure it's nothing. He'll be back any second." I stayed in that house for 20 years. You know, just in case. How can she still believe in God after what happened? You won't be lighting a candle for little Tommy, then? You already have, haven't you? Once a Catholic... Don't suppose it does any harm to throw in the odd prayer, eh? We're still trying to track down the previous tenants of Kenville Road. 25 years, people move on. Thank you very much, Jane. You are an angel. Ta. Bye. OK. We've got a trace. Vernon Mortimer. Work and Pensions says he retired to Pimlico in 2005. So, there's a chance he stayed in touch with Edward Connor. Let's hope he's in. Vernon's not in. Moved out about a year ago, according to the caretaker. That for me? Cheers. Yeah. Right. It's like chasing ghosts, isn't it? But he left his flat to his daughter, who works around the corner in, "one of them overpriced, poncy flower gaffs". You grew up in Kenville Road, Ladbroke Grove? Yeah. What's this about? A little boy. Do you remember him? Yeah, that's Tommy. He was my friend. He disappeared. We recently found his remains... in the basement of the building in which you grew up. God, no. That's horrible. Can you remember the day he went missing? It was such a long time ago. Well, we know that Tommy went to his friend Joe's house after school. Yeah, that's right, because I think I wanted to go with them. My mum wouldn't let me. I don't think I was very well. I know I played outside the house for a while. My mum was going out, I think. And then I got into my pyjamas. And Dad made me some tea. Tomato soup and Dairylea sandwiches. Well remembered. He always made me that if I was ill or upset. And then I went to bed. I didn't wake up until Mum told me the police wanted to talk to me. And that was the next morning, so... I didn't see Tommy. What about Edward Connor? Lived in the flat upstairs. Publisher. Remember him? No. I didn't see him either. Sorry. Well, we'd like to talk to your parents. They moved out of London a year ago. They live in Lewes. Lovely. Is it? I don't know. I've never been. It shook us all. Thomas was a sweet boy. He only lost his dad the year before. Julia wasn't well. You went out, right? To the PTA meeting, yes. When I left, at about half-past five, Thomas was with Edward Connor, outside on the steps. But I said all this in my statement. Yeah, but we now know that Tommy was probably killed inside the building. So, I mean, we still have to - Do your job. Of course. We're trying to track Connor down. He's changed his name. To Ralph Drake. Yes, I know. And he wrote several children's books under that pseudonym. Oh, I kept tabs on him down the years. We all knew it was him. I told her there was no proof. He was a volunteer at St Peter's Church youth group. Not this again. And three months after Thomas disappeared, he was accused of propositioning a 12-year-old boy there. Well, I call that proof, don't you? Just make sure you get him this time. The cheeky little bastard who made the complaint He knew I'd been arrested over Tommy's disappearance. Wanted attention. He retracted it soon after. No-one wanted to hear that. Because all gays abuse kids. As you know. Well, I think we both know that most child abusers are straight, don't we, Mr Connor? So, tell us about the day Tommy disappeared. Why should I? Because we're trying to get to the truth. Deja vu. We chatted outside on the steps. I went in and left him playing football. I came out a bit later to go for a drive, and he was gone. Is that all? No, no. I forgot. Before that, I took him down to the basement, tortured and killed him. That's not funny, Mr Connor. Mm. Neither is being hauled off the street for no reason, and kept in a cell for three days while some rat-faced detective kicks the shit out of you. He...he only stopped when he drew blood and I told him I had AIDS. I couldn't give him an alibi. My lover was married. Gays had never been so unpopular. After all, we brought in the plague. It's not like that now, sir. No. No. Now, I'd get 100 grand in compensation. Then, I got three broken ribs and a black eye. McFadden has persecuted Edward Connor and took his eye completely off the ball. SOCO can't find any crime stains to reanalyse. This should have been solved back then. Now we've got nothing to go on. Think I'll go home and cuddle my boys. Which they'll hate, of course. Night-night, guv. Wait. Listen to this. READS: Mum picked me up from school. I played outside for a bit. I was feeling ill because of my cold. Mum was going out. I put on pyjamas. Dad made tea - tomato soup and Dairylea sandwiches. I went to bed. I didn't wake till Mum said the police wanted to speak to me next morning. Does that ring any bells? That's the statement we took from Julia this afternoon. Wrong. It's the statement Jeff McFadden took in 1983. It's practically word for word. Well, what you make of it? Well, maybe Tommy going missing was so traumatic for her, that day was etched on her brain forever. No. To her, the trauma didn't occur until the next day. The night before was a normal night. She didn't know there was anything to witness. Or a story to perfect. She's lying. After you. Blimey, what's he done wrong? I take it you're not here to buy flowers. Maybe in a few weeks, for Tommy's funeral. But we need to solve the case first. Well, I've told you what I know. You told us exactly what you told the police in 1983. That's what happened. Well, not quite, Julia. Because one of your ex-neighbours told us that she saw you with Tommy. Yet you told us you hadn't seen him. It was a long time ago. Which is why we'd like to take an hour to go over that day. Listen, I was eight years old, OK? I don't want to go back to that day. I am really sorry about Tommy. But it's in the past. Tell that to his mother. Julia - I'm sorry. I'm very busy. I've got work to do. I take that as a no. I take that as a sign she's got something to hide. It's possible someone told her what to say. She was sworn to secrecy. Not necessarily. As a child, you can be coaxed into believing an alternative version of events. If what she witnessed was traumatic, then the real memory could have been repressed, because it was just too hard to process. So, she doesn't know what she's hiding? What can we do? We could try EMDR. Come again? It's a process that involves the patient following an object with their eyes. Oh, he's good at that. It's used to treat post-traumatic stress sufferers. It helps with the healing. It's also used to help stimulate the processing system and retrieve lost memories. I don't know. Sounds like a load of old mumbo-jumbo to me, hypnotising. EMDR's not hypnosis, Ronnie. It's a form of psychotherapy. If Dr Rawls thinks it's a good idea, I believe her. Anyway, it's not like we've got a whole bag full of other options. All right. I ain't sleeping well cos I'm wondering what Tommy Keegan's mum is going through. If it'll give her a bit of peace, it is worth a go. But first, we'll have to convince Julia Mortimer. I don't have any buried memories. How would you know? Dr Rawls can help you remember what really happened. She's used the technique before with good results. They're nice flowers, Julia. Gladioli. Knights used wear the roots under their armour for protection. Maybe we should try it. You are our only hope. We would like to find out who killed your friend. But it's your choice, Julia. Have a think about it. I keep seeing Tommy's face. Frightened. Crying. Calling out my name. And I don't know if it's my imagination or if I'm remembering it. Could she help me with that? Mum got cross. Because I'd been to the shop and bought sweets. She found them in my pencil case. Called me her little liar. I went out into the street. I did see Tommy. He waved at me. Threw his ball for me to catch. Mum told me to come back indoors. "I was getting into bed when the doorbell rang. It was Tommy. He wanted to make sure I was OK." Vernon never mentioned Tommy calling round. Tommy didn't stay. Julia's dad sent him away. And then she went to bed. I keep getting her to the point where she remembers waking up, but I can't get her beyond that. This is getting us nowhere slowly. Give it a chance. She's shutting down for a reason. I can't do this to order. Sometimes it takes years. I woke up. Wanted my dad. I looked for him everywhere. Kept calling out for him. He must have gone out. I'm scared. What did you do, Julia? I went out of the flat. Look at the light. You went out of the flat. The basement light was on. I could see it through a crack in the door. I walked towards it. I opened the door. Oh, God, can we stop? It's OK. You're safe. Please. You're doing so well, Julia. Keep going. You opened the door. I went down the stairs. My dad was there... with his back to me. I was so glad to see him. Oh, God. What's wrong? It's Tommy. He's got blood on his head and his hair, and he's not moving. Where is he, Julia? He's on the ground. At my dad's feet. "It's Tommy. He's got blood on his head and his hair, and he's not moving." "Where is he, Julia?" "He's on the ground. At my dad's feet." What do you think? She's not faking it. She didn't want to remember. It took seven sessions to get her there. She's telling the truth. Yeah, but will a jury believe her? Building a case on this evidence... It all hinges on Julia Mortimer being a credible witness. She at least deserves the chance to be heard. I'll talk to her. Why are you estranged from your parents? Dad's always interfering. Every time one of my relationships falls apart, he gloats. And when my last marriage ended, I just... ..I couldn't face him. Must be tough on your mum. Dad's her world. No-one else matters. Why did your marriage end? My husband cheated on me. Hardly your dad's fault. Was your father violent? No. Even the night he talked me through the story, he wasn't angry. He was crying. Sorry for himself. You hate your dad, don't you? No. Long before you allegedly remember what he did. I thought you believed me. This is a vendetta against him, done to punish him. A man who's shown you nothing but love all your life. He terrified me. He kept telling me about all the bad men out there. And all the time, I was holding the bad man's hand. I grew up with my best friend rotting in the basement. Yes, I want him punished. For what he did to Tommy. Thank you. I apologise. I hope you understand why I had to do that. Now we build a case. Julia's evidence is nothing if not backed up by some hard facts. OK. So, we get everything we can on Mortimer as quietly as possible. Find out why he might attack and kill a small boy, so that we can corroborate what she saw. If we don't, that's it. Phillipa Keegan will live her life without her son's killer being brought to justice. The system failed her once. We can't let that happen again. James, you're never going to believe this. Doug Greer, Mortimer's lawyer, called. He's coming in with the Mortimers tomorrow. Julia told her father what she's doing. Why the hell would she do that? She was angry. Ranting, according to Greer. I mean, you wound her up and sent her off. It's a lie. I don't know why she's doing this. Look on the Net at all the forums for people with fake memories. All around the world, women blaming their eating disorders on some fabricated crisis from their past. Innocent parents accused, left, right and centre. Just like my client. It's my duty to look at the facts. Yes, but you don't know our daughter, Mr Steel. She has a habit of running off with unsuitable men who bleed her dry. We pick up the pieces. All her life, Vernon's done nothing but take care of her. She lives in our flat, rent-free. He pays the lease on her shop and this is how she thanks him. She's not herself, Catherine. You don't know how... suggestible she is. I'm worried sick about her. Look at me. Are you really going to put me through this? I'm not saying you're guilty. I'm saying there's a case worth prosecuting. Then the jury can decide. Yes, but it will ruin us. It will ruin the reputation of the CPS first. A 25-year-old case that doesn't dignify the word evidence. A witness with zero credibility. You might want to think about that. Good day. Unbelievable. If your husband was accused of murdering a child, would you sit there and talk about your reputation? Tell me you've got something. Ladbroke Grove Life Casualty. Mortimer got sacked in 1986. I've spoken to five people. No-one will tell me why. Doorstep them. After you. Thank you. Take a seat. Chief executive officer back then? You must have been rather young. And upwardly mobile. Got a lot to thank old Maggie for, eh? I had my first alcoholic drink the day she resigned. Asti Spumante. Our estate celebrated for a week. How very urban. Vernon Mortimer. Did you know him well? He was a good salesman. Vernon could sell fire insurance to Eskimos, even after a liquid lunch. Then why did you sack him? We all have our demons. What were his demons? Is it to do with young boys? I'm investigating the murder of a child. We did a job once, in Birmingham. On the way back, the train stopped at High Wycombe. He went to the loo. I went to the bar and had a few too many. Next thing I know, he's with some policeman. A 13, 14-year-old boy said... ..Vernon made a pass at him. More than 20 years ago now. Weren't just him. I was experimenting. Gave him the come-on and then I lost my bottle. What exactly did he do? He offered me £20. It was something in his eyes, though, like he hated himself for doing it. I turned it down. He grabbed me and said, "All right, £50, you little shit." I kicked him and ran. Funny thing was, though, out there in the daylight, he just... just looked sad. Kept saying, "I'm sorry". Even tried to give me the 50 quid. The policemen called him a sick, disgusting man. Took a statement. But the case never went to trial. My parents suspected I was gay, but didn't want the neighbours knowing I hung around station toilets. So, they wouldn't let you give evidence? They took me to see a shrink instead. She said it's not about sex when it's adults with kids, it's about power. Somebody they can control. The judge won't allow Kevin Jackson's evidence. It was sexual conduct, rather than violence, which is what we're prosecuting. Any application on that basis is bound to fail. The sexual abuse probably led to violence. We can fill in the gaps all that we like, but that's not the way the law works. It's time to let this go. We can't. Julia Mortimer will go into the witness box with nothing to back her up. Her dear old dad is an elderly pillar of the community. He was 39, strong and dangerous back then. That's how we must see him, not as some frail old pensioner. But that's what he'll look like to the jury. It's just not worth the risk. My son is eight too. No parent would say that. Phillipa Keegan has suffered enough - And should be spared the pain of a trial. And I'm a dad too. Remember? Hello. Castle? Just a second. It's Dr Rawls. It came back to her in our session this morning. "Dad would come into my room at night, read me a story. He'd lie on the bed, touch me. Kiss me on the lips. Stroke me under my nightdress. I told my mum. And she said that... if it told anyone else, that I'd never see my dad again. That's when it stopped." It's my fault. He couldn't have me, so he moved on to Tommy. Mr Mortimer, you stand charged on this indictment with murder. How do you plead, guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. Is the defendant on bail? Yes, My Lady, with a number of conditions. He's lodged a surety in the sum of £30,000, surrendered his passport, is subject to daily reporting at Lewes police station. Bailed as before. I want to withdraw. You can't. We've come too far. We've built the case. But this is killing him. My mother said he's losing his mind. She's trying to manipulate you, Julia. He's my dad. He's 65. He will die in jail. He killed an eight-year-old child. Walk away, he'll never pay for what he did to Tommy. I was better off not knowing. Tommy's mum is on her way. Please, Julia. Wait. I didn't realise you had an appointment. Julia just showed up. I am so sorry about Tommy. You were joined at the hip, you two, weren't you? You played weddings with my veil. I would love to have seen him married. Don't, please. I'm not sure I can do this. Your father held me while I cried. He drove me round and round, day and night, searching. And all the time, he knew. Tommy wouldn't go to that basement. He said there was a monster down there. There was, wasn't there? Yeah. You've got to help me. Tell me, James, exactly how much research have you done on your key - oh, sorry - only witness? I believe her and the jury will too. Not when they hear where she spent her summer holiday last year. Little clue. The staff wear white coats. Hm? Let's go. Tommy was seven when his father died of leukaemia. And that brought us closer. Did your son have a relationship with the defendant? Yes. Mr Mortimer started helping us out after my husband died. And what did you personally witness in this relationship? He'd arrange treats for him. He took him to see West Ham play. Tommy's dad used to support them. Once, he came home with one of the players' autographs and I remember... thinking that at least he had a father figure. Thank you, Mrs Keegan. No further questions. Did you tell the police about my client's relationship with your son? No. So, it didn't seem unusual? It's the strangers you worry about. Not the nice man over the road. If you were as close as you claim, you would have noticed if something was wrong. Yes. No. Because I trusted Vernon. Mr Mortimer. And continued to do so, until this hysterical notion was planted. If I'd have known, I would have kept him away. Well, maybe there was nothing to know. No further questions. You do know I'll demolish Julia Mortimer in the witness box tomorrow? She's a mess, James. You're right. She's long since learned not to trust her own mind. Tomorrow might break her. That's not what I want. If you cared for her, you'd confess. How can you say I don't care? I love my daughter! Don't get involved. Don't look for absolution from me. I'm a good man. I've worked hard all my life. Don't... Don't you walk away from me! You don't know me! Tell me about the day Thomas Keegan disappeared. Erm... I saw him outside the house briefly. Later on, he came to the door. I thought my dad sent him away. What else happened that evening? I wasn't well. I went to bed early. Erm...when I woke up, the flat was empty. I went outside and... I saw that the basement light was on. I went down some steps. And my dad... was there. Tommy was lying at his feet. He had blood on his head. What happened then? Erm... Dad... My father, he saw me, and he shouted at me to go back to bed. He came running at me, up the stairs, eyes all bulging out. And I ran to my bedroom, but later he came in. And he hugged me. And he told me that I'd had a nightmare because I was ill. And that if I told anyone about the nightmare, then I... would lose him forever. When did you remember all this? When I started doing therapy with Dr Rawls. And I also remembered... that my father sexually abused me when I was seven years old And when I told my mother, it stopped. Thank you. No further questions. Prior to the past few weeks, Miss Mortimer, when did you last see your parents? Erm... about a year ago. Long time. Why is that? Ever since I was a child, Dad tried to control me. Did they treat you badly when small? Well, there was the abuse. Ah, yes. The abuse. It suddenly came back to you while you were moving your eyes back and forth. Much like the memory of your father with Tommy's corpse. Did your...delusions last year include images of blood or basements? No, you don't understand. I think I do. You have always been resentful of your father, because he told you the hard truths that you didn't want to hear. And when you heard that Tommy's bones had been found, you wanted revenge. No. He did it! That is why, all my life, he has been there watching me! Good job. He warned you off the 17-year-old who got you pregnant, then forced you to have an abortion, which made you sterile at the age of, what, 15? That's hardly relevant. What is your point, Mr Greer? That Miss Mortimer's life is a catalogue of disastrous relationships. She is deeply unstable. Mum, I told you what he did to me and you blamed me! You called me a dirty, precocious little whore! You always took his side! And there you have it. The sole motivation of this hysterical witch-hunt. A spoilt child who resents the bond between her.. I can't... ..loving parents. Thank you, Mr Greer. I can't... I can't take it. Great. Our main witness falls to pieces in the witness box. So, now the jury think she's a hysterical mess and they'll side with her dad. We've got nothing left. We've lost. There's one last chance. Vernon himself. He knows why Julia fell apart in the box. He's carried that guilt for 20 years. Imagine what that's done to him. And how is he going to respond under pressure? I... I cared about Thomas. So much so that you abused him, just like you abused your own daughter. I never hurt her. Oh, you did, Mr Mortimer. And you're still hurting her now, aren't you? You saw her in the witness box. It didn't look much like she was gloating, did it? More like she was falling apart. Mr Steel's opinions are neither here nor there. You didn't just destroy one family, Mr Mortimer. You destroyed your own. Are you ever going to make it right for your daughter? Or for Tommy? Will you ever take responsibility for the damage you caused? The damage you continue to cause. When are you going to be a father again? I sexually assaulted my daughter when she was seven years old. It went on for four months. Julia, she told her mother, who said she'd call the police... My lady, this is most irregular. ..if I ever did it again. May I ask the jury to retire? This is my turn to talk! The jury will hear what Mr Mortimer has to say, Mr Greer. Go on. I didn't know where to get help. I took work away from home. I approached young boys in toilets. But they were strangers. When Thomas's dad died, all I wanted to do was help. We got close. Oh, I came to love him... like he was my own son. I made him do things to me. For six months. In return for... treats. He wanted to stop. Said it felt wrong. We were in the basement. He said he was going to tell his mother. Tried to get away. There was a hammer... ..by the boiler. I hit him with it. The side of his head. Just the once. I didn't mean to kill him. I didn't want to lose you! What did you do then, Mr Mortimer? I... I put him... inside the fireplace. I bricked it up. My boy! I'm sorry. My boy! Mrs Keegan. Ronnie. We got our man in the end. We? Did you know? I just wanted us to be a family. Well, where...where will you go? transcript:chocolate sync:innuit -==Ææàãðüàöô°çãçé·îï×==- ±3⁄4×öä"1⁄2ö1©ñ§ï°1⁄2"á÷3¬ñï1⁄2ûóãóúéìò�óãí3⁄4 -=Ææàãðü×öä"×é=- ·­òë3o ð3¶ô3o ê±3⁄4äöá3oëäôâ What's the matter with you, huh? !

I thought you were going to ~ Giulio, the ball! ~ Excuse me. ~ Just imagine! Are you crazy? Your Honor, I apologize. Can I arrange for the repairs? It's nothing, it's hardly the first time. Here we'd like a steel door! ~ What do you think? ~ That in my home of 5 doors, 4 are made of glass! Don't worry, if the mother remains in jail... we'll find accommodation in another institution. Good luck. ~ God help me! ~ Goodbye. I need some advice. I ask to be recused from this investigation. If I were to discover something that aggravates the mother's situation... Then how would I dare face the kid? You're very suitable for keeping her child! ~ Thanks. And I apologize again. ~ No biggy! Look at this! Excuse me again. Are you crazy? Do you think you're in San Siro? ~ You told me to kick it to the goal door! ~ It's just that this door's a judge's, not of Zenga's! No, no hands! I'm too mad at you! ~ You broke this, too? ~ No, someone stole your radio. ~ But look! ~ It's the crowning touch! What do you mean? A policeman's radio's stolen in front of a judge's house! The crowning touch is me having to take care of you. Get in, Tarantula. What'll you bet I catch those thieves? If only it were true! Damn! Ah! Why are you laughing at? I'd guess the radio's already in Naples! Today everything's going wrong. ~ Good evening, Mr. Vinciguerra. ~ Good evening, Mrs. Matilda. ~ Good evening, sir. How's it going? ~ Good evening, Ma'am. ~ Good evening, Mr. Carlo. ~ Good evening, Madam, good evening. ~ Good evening Mr. Carlo. ~ Hello. ~ Hello, dear. ~ See you again. ~ How come they're all such old bags? ~ Don't say that word. It's ugly. Say: "old ladies". This is a palace for widows. ~ Good evening, Mr. Carlo. ~ There's an old one! Good evening, madam. ~ This lovely child is your nephew? ~ No, just a friend. ~ Goodbye. ~ Goodbye. Good evening. Those two aren't old. Are you hungry? ~ A bit. ~ Would you eat a plate of spaghetti? ~ Not bad. Or maybe fusilli. ~ Fusilli? Who will bring them? We'll eat spaghetti that'll be so good! ~ We should sauté it in the pan. ~ Right. Come on. To sauté we must leave the pan on the fire. Otherwise you don't get the juices in right. OK. We have to be two idiots! Two hours of work thrown away! We are two fools! What do you doing? What if we eat them with the sauce on the top? ~ How could we? ~ Come on, else they'll get cold! At least let's add the parmesan! ~ This way we cooked them sauté on the floor! ~ Don't try to be funny! You can't! Give it up! ~ It's like eating cat vomit. ~ No! ~ No! ~ But why "no"? Give me a break! You see what we've been reduced to? We're crazy, you know. And me the more so for following you! ~ Why are you laughing? ~ Because now Derrick gets his radio stolen. I told you I'll nab them. You can count on me! Since it's 10:45... children go to bed. And you're bursting with biscuits. Go on. ~ First I have to wash. ~ Let's go wash! You had your shoe filled with ink? The other. What is it? I can wait until tomorrow to wash this one. I've never seen anyone wash one foot! ~ Are you a wading bird? ~ We're starting over? Indeed we start over! I can't bear see you in this shape. Let's go. It's 11:30 We're still washing! Why couldn't you go to the institute, hmm? You could go to the institute! OK? Get in. ~ Why are you smelling it? ~ It's almost correct. You have paranoia! Get into bed. ~ It squeaks. ~ Sure, if you jump that way, it squeaks. Mom lulls me in her bed. ~ Your mom, not me! Got it? ~ Mom's commands have priority. Then go to your mother and sleep on a bench in Rebibbia! Why, do they make them sleep on the benches? No, those are just phrases that are said. Lights off! Mom leaves me a bedside light on. Here you have a glass door and the light in the hallway. That's good enough. Good night. ~ This is not a boy, he's an alien! ~ Carlo! Carlo! ~ What is it? ~ The bed squeaks, I can't sleep. You see? Just by breathing! You're doing it on purpose! One breathes in a coma like that! Enough! If I get angry, you'll be in trouble! There is nothing to laugh about! Not a thing! Cursed be the moment when I went into that house! Folliero, you could make me a favor. Buy a stereo for my car. Send D'Ambrosio since his uncle has a warehouse. The brand? It's "Nebraska", with "k"... Model...271. It could be either well used or new, I'll take care of aging it. I recommend it! Tomorrow morning I want to find it on my desk! OK? I speak softly because I had a chill. I'm hoarse, but don't worry. Yes, tomorrow. Goodbye. Thank you. The little guy is screwed! I can't stand this squeaking, it drills my brain! Giulio! Come sleep with me. I won't put up with this noise any longer! ~ Are you serious? ~ Yes. You'll stay with me until you fall asleep... then go back there. Got it? The bandits have been about seven, eight, or ten. What does "around" mean? Be a little more precise. There were ten bandits. They were violent, armed to the teeth. They had hand grenades, pistols, machine guns. ~ One had a bazooka. ~ You exaggerate! And their aircraft carrier? Some were heavily armed bandits. I don't remember if there was a bazooka. At some point we surrounded the house. At three o'clock I gave the signal like a turtledove. At night the turtledoves sleep, they don't sing. In fact it was in afternoon. ~ At night would be better. ~ This raid was made during the day. Next time we'll do it at night, to make you happier. After my signal, Marshal Cipriani... ~ answered me with the cry of a dog. ~ Do it. I drew my gun, then pointed it to the sky... and then I fired a flare which brightened up the whole area. But it was broad daylight? We go running in the house, break through windows and doors. Beatings, gunfire, screams! "Police!" And things like that. ~ Pim, bang, bang! ~ That was good. "Hands up!" You don't want to hear about WWII, huh? I want to see my mom. Last time I saw her in a "talking room". I'll tell you something in great secrecy. She might be out in two or three days. Two or three days is a long time. ~ What's your mother like? ~ I like her. Do you? She's a beautiful girl, with a nice body. ~ She's nice. ~ With you. Yes, sometimes she gets angry. Sometimes she swears! What kind? Things like "Judas Pig"? ~ Much worse. ~ Yes? ~ But she gets over it quickly and turns happy. ~ Is she happy, then? Usually, but not always. That's because she's a little lonely. That evening at home There were so many people, so many friends. ~ They're not friends. ~ What are they? Enemies? Listen... At home, for example... Carlo! Carlo. Carlo! ~ Who is that? ~ Wait until I explain. ~ Who is it? ~ A boy, or does it look like a cat? My slippers. I have to walk over the glass. I'm afraid that... I was afraid of that. It's like a thorn in the foot. Hurry. Check it out. ~ Wait a minute, huh? ~ You see? Wait, I need my eyeglasses. ~ Look. ~ One second. Hold on. ~ Can you see? ~ This isn't a foot, it's raw meat. Take him from me. The child's falling onto the glass. Wait... I got it! ~ Lucia. ~ Yes? ~ The band aids are... ~ On the shelf in the bathroom! ~ Keep still. ~ You're tickling me. ~ May I learn who he is? ~ The judge entrusted him to me. He's the son of someone I arrested. It's just for two or three days. I'm only free for two nights! You'd forgotten I was coming. No, not at all. I even put on my fighting pajamas. These shabby pajamas? Think about the fighter --- what does the clothing matter? ~ No, come on. ~ I've got total lust. There's a child there. ~ What? ~ There's a little boy! Husbands and wives don't do anything because there are children? Just don't do the screaming part, OK! ~ Stop it! Doesn't he have a father? ~ He's in Milan, in prison. Enough about the child. Think of us! ~ Carlo, no! ~ You're so hot! Why do you always carry around these seat belts? ~ Don't scratch! ~ No! ~ My head is spinning. ~ You worry too much. Foot first, then the head. Relax, it also helps me. You're right. Don't leave marks. So even yours squeaks, too? ~ What? ~ Who's that woman? Who is it? It is a colleague who came to do some karate training. ~ Stop it! ~ Yes! Why aren't you sleep? It's two in the morning. ~ Did you take cocaine or what? ~ Kiddo, check out this move! ~ Damn! ~ Disliked? ~ End of training. Good night. ~ Lucia! Don't do that, Lucia! ~ Did it hurt? ~ No, we studied the moves. It's all make-believe. Christ... Stop! Mom always insists on seeing hair combed! OK. ~ But you, why do you care? ~ Eh? I don't matter. ~ Don't you notice anything? ~ You have a wart. Not on me. You don't notice anything in the car? ~ Look closely. ~ The radio! ~ Did you nab them! ~ Yes, I put them under pressure. But that button was broken. ~ It was broken? ~ Yes. Oh, yeah. It seems they fixed it. ~ And why did they fix it? ~ Why did they fix it for me? Well... to make it easier to fence, maybe. ~ And so we've won! ~ Of course! ~ Thanks. ~ You again, with my son? ~ What do you want? ~ Nothing. ~ I don't want anything. ~ So what are you doing here? Ask him yourself. I'm at his house. ~ At your house? ~ In my house! ~ But maybe tomorrow you'll be free. Right? ~ Maybe. You asked for bail? You have to be awarded it. ~ You get the idea. ~ Get lost. Let me speak to my son. Sure, talk away! ~ How are you, my love? ~ Not bad. You promised me that wouldn't happen anymore. I wanted to take you to another city, but they wouldn't let me go. ~ Those from Milan? ~ Never speak of these things with him. ~ Did he ask you anything? ~ No. Don't trust him. That's why I wish you weren't with a cop. It's not really bad --- actually, it's kind of good. As soon as I told him I wanted to see you, he arranged it. He has you with him to pressure me. I know what he's doing. No. I know him better. He's not so very clever. He let them steal the car radio! He's a cop! He said he found it because he had arrested the thieves. In my opinion, he just bought a new one! He's a liar! The other night a female guard came over and I caught them. I was told they were doing karate. What kind of karate do you do with your pants off? ! ~ Then he told me stories. ~ What stories? You know, bedtime stories. He says his stories are true. All full of shootings, bombs, machine guns. In which he's most courageous! He also did sound effects. It goes like this... He told me all about the Second World War! ~ What are you laughing at, you ninny? ~ Who's laughing? I laughed so... ~ Commissioner Vinciguerra? ~ Yes. You should accompany me to the men's department. There, the warden would like to speak with you urgently. Right away. Can you keep an eye on the boy? Can you keep him until the end of the interview? Yes, we'll wait in the antechamber of the lounge. ~ See you later. ~ Come on. Director, this is Commissioner Vinciguerra. ~ Good morning, Commissioner. ~ Director, good morning, how are you? Eh! Crappy. ~ What's happened? ~ An evil which I think applies to you. Come along. ~ You arrested him. Do you remember? ~ I remember, yes. Antonio Licata. They found him a quarter of an hour ago, hanged in the shower. He seemed like a fairly quiet person. He had never shown signs of imbalance. ~ He did it all by himself? ~ It's hard to imagine... first fracturing his skull and then hanging himself. ~ They rubbed him out. This one won't squeal anymore. ~ I should imagine. If you want to proceed in this matter: interviews, surveys... ~ I'm at your disposal. ~ I can't do more any this case. I'm recused and perhaps I did so too well. Furthermore, in my opinion, there's another prisoner who faces a similar risk. Her name is Rosanna Clerici. I think there's a connection to this case. In the women's branch it's less likely, but I'll give the orders. ~ I beg you, eh! ~ Accompany the inspector. ~ A pleasure. ~ Thank you, Director. ~ Goodbye. ~ Good evening. ~ At your service. ~ Thank you, thank you very much. ~ What are you doing? ~ Cutting my nails. ~ With your teeth? That sucks! ~ I told him that, too! Your mother teaches you these things? Put on your shoes and socks. ~ What's your problem? ~ Me? Nothing! ~ Are you angry? ~ No. ~ Are you sad? ~ No! ~ Are you nervous? ~ I said no! But something's up when you get eyes like that! ~ Like what? ~ A boiled egg! ~ Do my eyes look like eggs? ~ No, I don't think so. ~ Thanks, eh. You've been very kind. ~ A pleasure, goodbye. Thanks so much for...for your assistance. Thank you, come on. Can't you tie your own shoes? ! ~ Why did you wander off before? ~ Problems of work. Has something has bad happened to my mother? Hey, I'm not concerned with your mother anymore. Don't you understand? Let's go! ~ But you've got hands like bolt cutters! ~ No, I'm just exhausted! Unit 44 here. He's taken the Christopher Columbus towards Ostia. ~ There's the accomplice on board. Over. ~ Got it. Over and out. Unit 7, unit 18, unit 31. ~ 7, roger. ~ 31, roger. ~ 18, roger. Converge immediately on Christopher Columbus, repeat, Christopher Columbus. Report when you have a Golf in sight. Maximum precautions, the' armed and dangerous. He has previous convictions. ~ I'm worried. ~ But why? We're four against one. You don't understand, I'm worried for the kid! ~ Trevi 01 calling Doppia Vela. ~ Next. ~ Capuano, link me to channel 24. ~ 24! You need to echo me? Why? Trevi 01, come in. Operator channel 24, listen. Hello, I'm chasing two robbers. I need to make a personal phone call. ~ Commissioner! ~ I know! ~ You're crazy. It's against the rules. ~ I'm in a mood over this heartache because... Folliero came to pick me up and I left the kid alone at home asleep. ~ Everybody is overhearing! ~ What should I do? ~ I understand. ~ If he wakes up and finds me gone, what'll he do? ~ He'll go back to sleep. ~ No, I know. Do me a favor... call Mrs. Ernestina Pisano right away... she's downstairs. Ask her to look after the kid until I get back. ~ She'll find the key under the mat. ~ I understand. If dear Mrs. Pisano can't because an attack of uric acid... call Mrs. Adelina Cruciata, Adelina Cruciata, building E. ~ This is an emergency channel. ~ My private business is an emergency. ~ If you can't even get Cruciata... ~ Then I'll go. ~ Really? ~ Of course! I'll go tend to the son of a criminal! Over. Enough about this brat. We've got more serious things to think about. Cursed be the day when I set foot in that house! Unit 44 at the roadblock. Heads up, Golf about to arrive. Repeat, Golf about to arrive. No sign of backing down. Maximum precautions. He forced the roadblock. There was a firefight. ~ Was he hit? ~ Yes, it's serious! But what have they done? Where did they go? ~ Towards Ostia. ~ Bring up the reinforcements. Blocked the entrance the pine forest of Castel Fusano... and the junctions of Torvaianica and Ardea. We're after them. He has diverted through the pine forest of Castel Fusano! We can't seem to keep up, step on it. ~ Hello, Carlo. ~ By the Holy Mother, it's the boy! ~ Christ! ~ What are you doing here? I was afraid to be on my own. So you came up here? ~ What do we do, sir? ~ Turn off the lights, come on. There they are. ~ They turned theirs off, too. ~ How did you get here? When they came to take me, I heard them in the room... ~ so I ran down to the car. ~ Keep your head down! Keep your head down! There they are, trying to get away. Get moving and slip behind the hedge. ~ Trevi 01 calling Doppia Vela. ~ Roger. We need help in the pine forest. We must block the exit. Falcon 10 is already near. ~ You'll arrange a trap? ~ Shut up and get down! Shut up, keep down. ~ Make the sound of the turtledove! ~ No. Get down! Please. Keep your head down. Down, please. My mom was an addict before I was born. She says I made her stop from inside her belly! ~ I kicked her! ~ Bravo! Now keep your head down. Why don't you give the signal of the turtledove? Turtledoves sleep at night! Get down! ~ One of them woke up with the shots. ~ That's a sick one. ~ Get your head down, Giulio! ~ Just make the damned noise! ~ OK? Are you happy? ~ Here they go! ~ Go on! ~ Did you see it can sing? Shut up! Get your head down. Get your head down, kiddo. ~ Poor guys, they are all killed. ~ Anyway, first thing, remove the weapons. ~ Oh, my God! ~ Carlo! And stay down! ~ Are you injured? ~ Quick! We'll summon the ambulance. Come on, I urge reinforcements, come on! ~ From Trevi 01, urgent! ~ Roger. We are in the pine forest. The Golf is overturned, there are two serious injuries. ~ Send an ambulance and reinforcements. ~ Roger. Folliero, when we make the report there's no need to say... ~ Carlo, what happened? ~ You sit tight! ~ Will you shoot again? ~ Shut up or I'll shove a turtledove in your mouth! Don't say the boy was with us, so no one's seen him, understood? OK, sure. And the judge who gave him to me --- what would she think of me? ~ What would they think of the judge! ~ She'll get angry and take him off me. ~ I've never seen children in my entire life! ~ Bravo! Let's go. The squeak! ~ That's who it was! ~ Mr. Carlo, you've returned! ~ Yes, what you doing here? ~ Ms. Pisano could not come... ~ So I came by for the child. ~ I'm sorry you were disturbed. No, he was an angel! He's still asleep, I never heard a squeak. ~ I believe you! ~ I'm just making breakfast. ~ Lady, you... ~ There's milk. Don't worry now. I'll watch over him. ~ You must be tired. Go on home. ~ A little tired, yes. You've already done so much, really. Go get some sleep. ~ Thanks. ~ Of course. Excuse me, my phone. ~ Go on, go on. ~ Yes? Pass it over. ~ Your Honor... ~ If you need I can also come tonight. ~ Thanks. Tell me everything. ~ You were right. ~ They've been denied bail. ~ Oh, God! So what'll I do with the kid? Look, I've been thinking about it a lot, but I also know your opinion. ~ If your child is happy with you... ~ Very happy! Too happy! Since he's already there and is settled in... He's all set. For me it's a bit complicated... But if you tell me to keep him, I'll do so without any problems. ~ And if they're convicted? ~ Then I'll dump this burden. Of course I couldn't play daddy for the rest of his life. ~ Agreed. The boy is fine? ~ A wonder! Have you noticed any symptoms of neurosis? Does he sleep well at night? Sure. He's doing a major snore after last night! ~ Stuttering? Eating his nails? ~ No, just those on his feet. ~ What! ? ~ Your Honor, I'm sorry. We're speaking, but we have an underlying problem. The mother, who hates me, will never give consent. ~ She already has. ~ You can't be serious? I have here before me the signed document. ~ Her lawyer brought it to me yesterday. ~ What's said about me? ~ By the lawyer? ~ The lawyer? The mother! Nothing. Not a thing. ~ She trusts you. ~ So tomorrow I get to sign the decree... And...continue. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Damn the skate, the puppets, the balls, and...the pots! ~ Here you are. ~ Bye. Bye. You've got the excuse that I wrote for you? ~ Yes, I have it here. ~ See you at four. Goodbye, handsome. ~ Carlo! ~ Yes? Will you give one to me? ~ What? ~ A kiss. ~ Bye. ~ Bye. There's everything from necklaces, bracelets...everything you found on the ground? ~ Yes. ~ This, too? ~ And tell me that you have found this on the ground too? ~ It's the truth. Yes, it's true... ~ Commissioner, this is lucky. ~ He who digs, he finds things! ~ Yes, in the pockets of others! ~ You are undoubtedly right! Write this. "Mr. Patrick... "Nguori, born in Brazzaville... ~ "was arrested on Via Palestro..." ~ What were you doing there? ~ Why were you still there? To do what? ~ Tourism. "In possession of objects... "of dubious origin." Pisano House? Are you? It's you. What do you want? Hurry up, they're very busy. What do you mean "busy"? You have a tone I don't like at all! Hostage? What do you means by "ransom"? You're not upsetting other people? I order you to put Mrs. Pisano on. Put Mrs. Pisano on. I'll let you talk just so you'll understand she's alive. Speak, tell him that you're alive. Hello, ma'am? What's he up to? ~ Wait while I take off the gag. ~ The gag? Mr. Carlo? No, no. We were playing. No, he's so cute! I'm always so alone. He keeps me company! Did said too much! Die! My Mom looks much better on a bathing suit. OK, we can't help it! What are you doing? Are you stupid? You're starting to compete with a six year old child? Everyone knows kids love their mothers most of all! Cover up! ~ There is a minor! ~ Are you two married? ~ The two of us? No. ~ Why does she have a ring? Why does she have a ring? Maybe she's married to someone else. ~ Where's he at now? ~ How should I know! Why so many questions? ~ He's fishing. He went fishing. ~ He's gone fishing. Alone or with another woman? What's with a third person involved? Why do you care? Something to investigate? Enough! ~ Would you all stop? Want to keep quiet? ~ Let us close our eyes ten minutes! ~ And what'll I do? ~ Dig a hole. Don't let him touch the sand, he threw it in my eye! Keep those hands clenched shut! I want to swim. No! You can't swim after all you've just eaten. ~ Ten pounds of mussels! ~ That old man does! Well, he's old and senile, it doesn't matter if he drops dead! That's my husband, you boor! Sometimes I lose my patience with... Please be patient. Excuse me. ~ What a fool you make me look like! ~ My mom makes me do it! Your mother doesn't exist, is in jail! Now I'm seeing to you! Totally! OK? OK? Is that clear? But what a beautiful Sunday in Hell! Don't you rattle my chain, too! Today's already difficult enough, please! ~ OK, you sleep. ~ I'll sleep, but you promise you won't go swimming. ~ I'm not promising that. ~ You're getting me annoyed! Now we'll see! You can dig your hole with one hand. I cheated! What dare you doing? Look at this red-haired spider! If I catch you, crush you! Why are you all wet? I'm sweating. You're lucky you don't sweat! ~ Sorry, guys. ~ Good morning. ~ Good morning. ~ Cariddi's marriage? It's inside. He's marrying off his daughter. ~ Your Honor, excuse me. ~ What is it? I know the moment isn't convenient... but I have custody of the son of Rosanna Clerici, held as... Yes, I know, I know. How can you think of coming bothering me right now? ~ The child has measles. ~ Dad, come on. Might you grant a permit to his mother to come to visit her son? ~ Please, we're late. ~ I've prepared a brief. ~ Give it to me in the office. ~ I'll leave it with you, so you read it. Tomorrow I'll call... Witnesses approach the couple. Excuse me a moment! Sorry. Instead of the memo, I gave you the prescription for the boy's drug treatment. Thank you. Excuse me! I am pleased to celebrate your wedding... Good morning. Please, make yourself at home. ~ How are you? ~ Better, no longer has a fever. ~ Thank goodness! ~ He's in there. Come along. He's such a little angel that child. ~ I'll wait here. ~ OK. Giulio, there's a surprise for you. See you tonight. Goodbye. ~ Hello, Giulio! ~ Mom! Hello, my love! ~ How are you? ~ Almost well. I infected him myself! It is not all that funny. For me, it's a tragedy. At my age it's a big tragedy. Be careful. As an adult, you could end up impotent! You're getting confused with mumps, this is measles! ~ What's "impotent"? ~ Another disease that would make you laugh! And I really hope that it is! At least he's taking good care of you? Until yesterday, yes --- now I'm taking care of him! ~ Get out the thermometer. ~ Speak softly, don't scream! I can't read. My eyes must be affected, too! ~ This thermometer reads...? ~ Give it to me. Well, what is it? Why did you reset it? ~ But why, because I've got a fever? ~ 39.9°. Was it that hard to tell me? ~ And how do I have to say it, in slow motion? ~ You're almost a water boiler! Cursed be the moment when I set foot in your home! How scared he is, that beats all! ~ It's time for your injection. ~ My God! The doctor gave me suppositories and gave him the injections! ~ Yes? ~ Thankfully the lady's gone, so my mother'll do it. She's great. ~ Come, quit it, Giulio. ~ Wait 'til you see all the spots on his butt! Have a little respect, I beg you. Please! ~ Why should I give him an injection? ~ Right! ~ Don't you think the suppository was worse? ~ What do I have to do? Absolutely nothing! The old dear will do me tonight. Let me think about her! Let me think about the nice old lady! The doctor said: "Every five hours." Don't even try it! ~ Hi. ~ Hi. ~ Hello. ~ Hello. ~ How are you? ~ Well. ~ Who's here? ~ The mother. ~ Bye. ~ Bye. It was true! ~ You've got the air out of it? ~ Yes, don't piss about! ~ Am I interrupting something? ~ Hello, Lucia. Thanks, nice reception! I want you to be quiet! Before the trumpet, now the gun! Enough! ~ Mom, she's the karate lady. ~ Lucia, she's the mother of Giulio. The Clerici detainee. Since you're here, you can give me an injection. No! Let her do it, she's a specialist in syringes! OK, but... Softly! Sorry, but I'd forgotten how to do this! ~ Mom, come let me show you something. ~ What? Pum! Pum! Pum! She was here! I have to have a shot every five hours... the old lady's out, and... ~ What am I seeing? ~ A surprise. He bought me all this. At first it was awful. There was only one bed, with a smelly mattress. I'd have one of these every night. For me it's just crazy! See that? ~ You like it? ~ Very. Feel how soft it is! ~ You miss me a little? ~ Yes, very much. But I'm fine here too. Why did you have to say that the prisoner Clerici is an expert with syringes? Why are you so sour? It's clear that you don't like the child... ~ if anyone would notice. ~ As soon as he sees me he shoots me! It's kids' stuff! What did they both do to you? Well, nothing. But why didn't you tell me she was coming by today? I told you. ~ No. ~ Didn't I? OK, I told you nothing, come on. I've got a fever! She came to visit her son, not me! But the one with his ass in the air was you, not her son! Don't do that. I have a fever of 40 and a pounding headache! I'm going. Let her heal you! See you when you're cured! Lucia... Lucia... I'll die of a broken heart! ~ He's just ugly ugly ugly? ~ He's a cop. A handsome policeman or an ugly cop? ~ Ugly inside and out. ~ Today, because he has a fever! ~ Without his fever, he's nicer. ~ No, I've seen him with no fever, too. But if you like him... It's you the one to stay here, not me. ~ It's time. ~ Yes, OK. ~ I have to go. ~ You can't stay a little more? No, unfortunately. Let's go. Now go back to bed. I don't want you to catch cold. ~ Come to see me. ~ Of course, if you order it! Goodbye. Mom, when will they bring you back home? ~ Hopefully soon. Goodbye. ~ You're not going to say goodbye to him? I'd rather not wake him. You say it for me. And tell him: "Thanks for everything." OK. Bye. ~ Come in. ~ Please, make him behave. ~ With these skates he's drilling my brain! ~ You're right. But the old woman had a gastroscopy, another a cardiology appointment... and the other was on dialysis. Who's left for him? Who's left? He's a devil! You're right. I don't know who else I could leave him with! ~ You think you're in the racetrack at Imola? ~ I can't believe this! There are people here who work! Try to be good! I'm sorry. Tomorrow we'll install the slides and swings! Everything kids could want! Sit tight and be good! Read a bit and let us work! OK? Let me work! ~ Why are you staring? ~ If I tell you one thing, will Mom get out sooner? ~ It depends on what you say. ~ I know one. ~ One what? ~ One of Mom's bosses. ~ Tell me who he is. ~ No. ~ Why not? ~ If Mom doesn't speak, I don't speak. Too bad for you and your mother! ~ But... ~ What? If you do an interrogation of those who can't resist... Maybe I can't resist! Come over here. Immediately! Making it hard? This reticence is, you know? If you want a hard line, I'll use it! Clear? Speak! Why won't you talk? ~ Speak! ~ Shine the lamp in my face. ~ OK? ~ During the day, it has no effect! Talk, by God! Spit out that name or I'll make you spit it out along with all your teeth! ~ Why are you crying? Why are you crying? ~ It's too hard, this way! Would I? What's going on, sir? Nothing. I'm doing an interrogation. Something just between me and him. ~ Back to work. ~ OK. ~ Is that the way to grill a child? ~ He lost his marbles! ~ Out with the names. ~ I don't know. You know if he's tall, short, fat, skinny...what? I'll draw him. Go on. That's him. This would be an identikit? I wouldn't even find him on Mars! It's here that he met with your mother? See if you can spot him. Don't lean. You see him? OK, let's go to another bar. Don't get noticed. Giulio, pay attention. There he is! ~ Which one? ~ With the blue shirt and a cigar. Get down. ~ Good morning, Commissioner. ~ Hello. ~ Hello. ~ Hello. ~ How are you? ~ I thought you weren't coming over anymore. Why don't you come over? I thought you were off to take the child to school. No, no, I sent him with the old woman, Mrs. Cruciata. ~ Now we'll only see each other at work. ~ It'll be like that for a while. It'll pass. Things won't always be like this. What, you're nervous? I'm tense. Do you know why? We arrested a big fish of the operation. We searched his home, we found some evidence. I'm worried about Giulio's mother, I wouldn't want them to kill her. ~ This family gives you such problems! ~ Why do you say that? What is this about? I care about them! I talked to my husband. I said that I talked to my husband. ~ Eh? ~ You understood that very well. Last night I talked to Michele, I told him everything. Everything? Yeah, about us. ~ Well, did he get mad like a beast? ~ No, not at all. If he was glad, I don't understand. ~ Actually, he was very understanding. ~ Holy crap! Basically, if you want, I can come to live with you...tomorrow, even right now. OK. I'm glad. Even... I'm completely free! You put the round right on my dummy's heart! Don't worry, it's not true. I didn't say anything, fortunately. ~ "Fortunately"? ~ Come on, it's better that way! Let's not fool ourselves. It's over. Let's not have any drama. It's the right thing. Not just for me, but also for you. OK. Commissioner, you're wanted on the phone. It's urgent, your headquarters. Urgent? Thank you. Yes? What? Oh, my God! ~ A tragedy! ~ Problems, sir? Huge! Come on, come on. I had the boy in my hands. I didn't see the car. Those two threw me down and took the boy! The poor boy! I was thrown to the ground at the gate of the school! I shouted: "Help!" No one helped me. They ran to the car. They pushed the child inside the car. ~ How dreadful! ~ What make was this car? I don't remember. They're all alike! ~ Can you remember the color! ~ I think that was beige. Maybe. I asked you the color, not the VIN! Shit! I'm sorry. They've already switched cars. Were they young, old? ~ Tall, skinny, men, women... ~ Who knows what they were like! Then you were stunned! Make yourself better! Or did I entrusted the boy to a corpse! ? Don't say that! The woman is in shock! ~ Even I'm shocked! ~ Don't let yourself feel guilty. Drink this and calm down. You've already been recused from this investigation. Believe me, leave it to others. They can handle it. You're not steady, you're too involved. I want to solve this case. I want to be reattached to the investigation. ~ They can't deny me! ~ Let's consider photography and the info about the child. Blue shorts, a white shirt with Linus... No! The dog Snoopy and a backpack in the shape of teddy bear! And a red skate! Then you say I'm stunned! You're the old wreck's king! ~ Go away or I won't do it! ~ Don't make jokes. ~ Well? ~ Hurry up! Yes. ~ How much did you have? ~ Not a lot, sorry! ~ "HELP" Come on! Don't touch me! Cursed be the moment you walked into my house! For once we agree! We need to find Giulio. You know who took him! ~ You're protecting them. ~ You want me to talk right now? They grabbed him to silence me. Do you want them to kill him? ~ No. ~ If he were your son, what would you do? Would you talk? So where should I look for him? Please try your best. Please! We're adjacent to the Pontine Heights, near Practica di Mare. A BMW was noted as reported. We found a red child's skate. ~ A "Baby Rollins". ~ Brand: "Baby Rollins". ~ It's him. Are there any other tracks? ~ No, not yet, but we'll keep looking. ~ You want reinforcements? ~ I asked for the help of a helicopter. ~ Keep us informed. This is big. ~ Roger. Over. ~ Over and out. Attention. For all. On Pontina, Pomezia direction. Make more accurate reports for suspicious cars and people. Alert all free units in the zone and notify the maritime police. Over. Emergency services throughout the area of Pomezia and Neptune. Maximum attention at the junctions of Aprilia and Lavinia. Repeat, Aprilia and Lavinia. ~ Let's go. ~ Yes. All flying units: keep a channel clear. ~ Carlo. ~ Yes? Good luck. ~ Thanks. Bye, Lucia. ~ Bye. ~ There's nothing. ~ It's his. No doubt about it, it's his! ~ You mean he's been dumped into the sea? ~ They've grab it there! ~ I was referring to the child. ~ You know what it's like, this bag? He's smart. It is an important trace, like the shoe. ~ Have you heard the story of Tom Thumb? ~ Who? ~ Of Tom Thumb. You know the story? ~ No. Giulio knows it very well. Think! Where did you put the parcel? ~ What parcel? ~ The one with the bear! ~ Ah, the backpack! ~ Well? Where is it? Hmm! Where? Could I have left it in the car? ~ What an asshole! Come on, check it out. Go on! ~ It's a mess. ~ They're closing in, we have to go. ~ It's all your fault! You idiot! We'll never get away if they've alerted a patrol boat,... Let's dig into the last row of fishing boats. You're right. You go below. Hurry. ~ Where do we start? ~ Folliero, the boat on the right. ~ Morra, to the left. ~ You two come with me. On! We'll start from the first vessel. Police, step outside. It's a search. ~ What's going on? ~ Move. Bend over and spread your legs. ~ Got it. Commissioner? ~ Yes? Commissioner, could you come here a minute? What is it? The patrol noticed that a vessel is receding from view. Have the patrol vessel escort it back to shore immediately. ~ Immediately. ~ Dai. Gunboat 494, block the vessel and bring it to the dock 2. Immediately returned to the pier! ~ Give me that. Gunboat 494. ~ Roger. Have the vessel brought back and moored. ~ Got it. ~ Over and out. ~ Folliero? ~ Yes, Commissioner? The patrol has caught the boat. He turned off the lights. ~ Morra? ~ Yes? How did that boat even get started? Eh! Manage that maneuver! Hurry up! It's a bit strange that they set sail in the night. ~ Did you noticed where they left from? ~ They were after the fishing boats. They were well camouflaged. I'm going to remove the roadblock. Strange! Toss the line. Come on. But what's going on? ~ We're conducting a search. ~ A search made? What for? We have our reasons. ~ What reasons? ~ Don't worry, we'll explain now. ~ Do you have a warrant? ~ Yes! Let them see, go on. And if that's not enough, we also have a mandate to go beyond the border! OK? Go on! But check us out! We're perfectly in order! Better for you, right? If you're in the clear, you'll be on your way in no time. Come aboard, Colucci. ~ Ask for their papers the documents, check them out. ~ Yes. ~ Your documents, if you please. ~ Sure. Here you go. ~ Who has title to the boat? ~ It's a corporation. The documents are clear. ~ Based in Monaco. ~ Yes, exactly. ~ Go check the engine compartment. ~ Yes Meanwhile, I'm going forward. ~ You're looking for a boy? ~ Yes And what we did we do wrong? Why did you veer off when you saw the patrol boat? ~ We didn't see it, we were just leaving. ~ At this time of night? It's not forbidden to leave at night! ~ Where were you going? ~ To Corsica, Bastia. To meet friends. Commissioner, I haven't found anything. OK. Enjoy your trip. Remember to turn your lights back on! ~ No apologies? ~ We don't have to! ~ Start the engine. Let's go. ~ Yes. ~ Is there a problem? ~ Maybe. Stop the engine! ~ Why? ~ Because I feel like it --- I'm in charge! Folliero, lights, Di Maio. Restrain them. Like hell you will! No way! Have you a warrant? Giulio! Enough with the dove! Where the hell are you? Giulio! Giulio! Giulio! Giulio! ~ Giulio! ~ Carlo! ~ Carlo! ~ Giulio! I'm here. Down! ~ Giulio! ~ Below! Push! Push! Push! Damn it! ~ Didn't I imitate the turtledove well? ~ You had to push more gently. What a shot you took! Tremendous! What should I do with you, huh? What should I do with you? Anyway, things worked out well. It went very well. ~ Are you ready? Have you got everything? ~ Yes. ~ Even your pajamas? ~ That's true! I won't be sleeping here tonight. But...you're going to sell all this stuff? ~ What? ~ This furniture. I'll keep it. It'll be the guest room. ~ Hurry up, they're waiting at the entrance. ~ OK. Giulio! C'mon, it's late. What are you hiding behind your back? What are you hiding? What's with this rascally face? Let me see. I'm giving you this as a souvenir, even though it's broken! Since you leave me that, see what I'm giving you! ~ These. New! ~ Uh, how beautiful! Do you like them? You're not going to get angry? No, you keep. Judas Pig thief! ~ Good morning. ~ Good morning, Commander. Hello, Giulio. Good morning, ma'am. ~ Good morning. ~ Catherine... Hello, Giulietto, returning home to Mom? ~ Yes ~ I've seen you both in the newspaper. ~ You, too, Mr. Commissioner, congratulations. ~ Thanks. Give me a kiss? ~ Goodbye, Mrs. Cruciata. ~ Don't disappear again, OK? Goodbye, Mrs. Pisano. You're leaving us alone? ~ But you'll come and see us sometime? ~ Yes, yes. As soon as they arrest my mother again... I'm coming to stay here. Now we also have a guest room! Well, how about that! ~ Even a guest room! Goodbye. ~ Goodbye! What's with: "As soon as they arrest my mother again"? You think we're the Gestapo, so we go around arresting people? You should say: "I'll see you anytime"! That's the right way to answer. Here she is! Mom! What do you think? Him, can we invite him to dinner tonight? Or do you mind? Hello. OK, fine. Mama said you can come to eat with us tonight at our house. You mean yours and mine or yours and hers? ~ I'm not clear about that. ~ Right. Mother says that at hers and mine there's nothing to eat. Unfortunately, there's no food even in yours and mine. ~ So what do we do, huh? ~ Wait... Mother says that then we'll go to a restaurant. OK? OK. Come on, Carlo. Come here. Give me your hand. Experimental Art Union "Ladya" of the Gorky Central Studio of Childrens' Teen Films Czechoslovakia TV "Bratislava" with assistance of "Barrandov" Studio Sergei Zhigunov Marina Levtova Nikolai Karachentzov Dmitriy Pevtzov The long range space research ship "Titan". Direction: open space. Destination: planet KS 63/12/ "Ev-fur" - evolutional furor. The laws of evolution on the planet are disrupted. Species of different historical eras coexist in the same time. Mammoths, diplodocuses, birds, pterodactyls, and semi-wild nomad tribes who constantly have intestine wars with each other. in Yuri Moroz's film WITCHES' DUNGEON Script writer - Kir Bulychyev Sit. Sit. When was this filmed? Half a year ago. In that time Oktin Khash conquered all tribes in our expedition's work area. Oktin Khash is this savage with red feathers on his head, isn't it? - Yes. - What kind of expedition do we have there? - Ethnographic one. It's head is Conrad Zhmuda. - Conrad? - You know Conrad? - Yes, he was my teacher. "Conrad Zhmuda, age 47, Professor Specialization: ethnography" Do the tribes represent any threat to the expedition? No. The station is well protected. But Conrad established direct contact with the tribes, which is prohibited by the instructions. Then we need to send a contacts inspector. "Andrei Bruce, age 32, Inspector Training course in "Phoenix" program." We decided to send Andrei. Main thing - pay attention to their weapons. There's nothing unusual there, at first glance at least. The case is that their civilization doesn't know metal yet. Then where did they get such weapons? That's what you'll need to find out. - Andryusha! You've matured! - And you haven't changed a bit. - Hello. We were expecting you after lunch. Who are these horsemen? They are our neighbors from White Wolf's tribe. Ingrid is treating their chief. - Hello. - Hello. - Ingrid Khan, a doctor. - Inspector Bruce. - I am ready, Inspector. - Won't you eat with us? - No, thank you very much. - I'll see you in two days. - May I go? - Yes. - Good bye. - Good luck. - We are going to the tribe's village. - Will you come with us? - Yes. I'll just change quickly. - Will we sort mail now or after lunch? - As you wish. - Have you had a chance to meet Andrei. - No, I haven't. - Axel. - Pleased to meet you. - What? The Center is not pleased with us? - Why wouldn't they be? Well, we won't go down without a fight. - Why are you helping the White Wolf's tribe? - Zhan is sorry for them. They're under his wardship. - Aren't you sorry for them? - I am. But I understand that we can't really give them real help. - We can give real help, we just don't have the right to according to instructions. Zhan maybe goes against instructions, but as a human being he's right. - Zhan is your philologist, right? - Zhan is not just a philologist. He's a GREAT philologist. The White Wolf's tribe considers him one of their own. Conrad, helping the White Wolf's tribe you are breaking the instructions on non-interference. We are looking for knowledge. And without contact our knowledge is abstract. And besides, if I can save a human life, if I can feed a hungry person, I'll do that. And no instructions can prohibit me to do that. You've come... And I haven't seen you yet. Zhan said, "A young chief is flying down from the sky." - You are handsome. - Well, there - you've already got a fan. - How come she knows our language? - It's clear. Zhan is teaching me. Nobody knows the language of people from the sky. I know. I'm smart. I'm Chief's daughter. - What's your name? - Billi Guri. Your people call me Bel-lo-gurochka. Is it pretty? - Hurry up. - Come on. Careful! - Zhan Lemont. - Inspector Bruce. - Pleased to meet you. - Is everything all right? - Yes. - Hi. - Hello. Glad to see you. And how often do you break the rule against usage of laser weapons? Yes, Zhan, you should've waited till that beast bit Inspector's head off. Hey, look who comes running. Hello, kiddo. That's Chief's brother. He's showing what a great sorrow this is. Zhan, ask him how he's feeling today. - That's a bad weapon. Katuradzh. - Ka-tu-radzh? - That's when someone leaves. Forever. - You are a big warrior. - Well, yeah. You can tell Conrad to give us lots of iron knives and arrows? ! Have to fight. Oktin Khash comes and we all katuradzh. It's clear. - You'll tell him? - No. - No.. No... It's not clear. You are strong. You don't want to fight. Oktin Khash does. He has lots of iron knives and arrows. He'll come to win over you. I tell, you listen. Bellogurochka always says what she thinks. Did you promise to give them weapons? - We don't have the weapons they need. - And if you had it, you'd give it? ! If it were up to me - definitely. - Conrad, we have visitors. - We see them. We did as you said, we moved to the ravines. Oktin Khash won't find. - Why didn't you leave with everyone? - It's clear. I wanted to see him. - Where's your knife? - Knife? Why do I need a knife? When Oktin Khash comes, don't let his warriors in here. He comes and you put the knife in his back. That's not good. He's coming to talk about peace. He always comes to talk about peace when he wants to kill. - He's coming to kill you. - We are not afraid. Conrad, Oktin Khash is approaching. - How far? - They'll be here in half an hour. - Axel, check the energy shield. - Check. - Good. We're coming through. - So what are you expecting from this meeting? - For Oktin Khash to leave us alone. - Are you going to let him into the station? - Of course. It's an offense not to let him come in. Guys, time to meet the guests. I greet you, Oktin Khash, the great chief, in my home. He says he's being much honored and he'll visit your tent. His speech is quite primitive. Kind of hard to translate. He says that the night is cold and his warriors are hungry. - Who'll feed them? - The last thing we need... - He's right, we'd be breaking the law of the steppe. - Tell him, they'll be fed. We'll go broke! We are glad that the great chief came to us with peace. Oktin Khash also likes peace. He's suggesting we give him this house and everything in it. In return, we'll always be fed and happy. He also offers women. He promises good ones. Zhan, please tell our guest, that we don't want power over other tribes. We want quiet. He's accusing you of lying. He says we enslaved the White Wolf's tribe. And also he demands that we give him Billi Guri. His gracious choice fell onto her. They are not our slaves. They came to us of their own free will. The White Wolves ran from him like cowards, says Oktin Khash. They are not worthy of your care, brother. How can I persuade him? Conrad, insist on your own. He's just testing you. The moment you give in to him in something, he'll move forward at once. - He's asking me to translate your words. - That's all right. Translate them. In my counsel, the minors aren't allowed to advice the chief. Or are you a bigger chief than Conrad? We are not pleased. You didn't give us the White Wolf's tribe. There'll be war. - What war? We have work to do. No, I don't get it. He's really going to war with us? Not likely. He's not even caring to show anger. Ask him, please, if he wants to trade with us or establish commerce. We have pots to help you cook your meals. We have grains and we can teach you to grow wheat. He came here to get weapons. Everything else is just camouflage. We cannot give you weapons. The food for his warriors is ready. Oktin Khash wants to send his sorcerer to check the food. He says we could poison it. - Why? We eat it ourselves. Andrei, could you see him out? - Sure. - Then come back. I don't know the thoughts of my dear brother. Maybe death of my warriors will bring him happiness? ! - And what's he here for - sampling? - Who knows? - Ingrid, the field. Turn off the field, Ingrid. - Turning off. - Check. I see. - The field! Ingrid, turn on the field. BACK! - Ingrid, the field! Scum! Shhh... - Where are we? - We are imprisoned by Oktin Khash. They killed Conrad. - Ingrid too. - I know. They killed everyone. Only we are left. How many times did I say that Oktin Khash's tribe should have been localized? ! Who are we to fight a wild chief on a wild planet? That's right. It's just the time for intellectual arguments. - We have to do something. We have to run. - Where? - To the station. Aha, they'll catch us in five minutes and finish us on the spot. - I see... - What? He said you'd go to the shrine of the witches. After all, he thinks you are a chief. So witches are waiting for you. Do you get it? He told you to come out. Hey! Who made this? ... That's some exhaustive information. Whoa! What a...? Hey, guys! It's honorable to be proud... But it's better to stay alive. Follow me. Hey, where are you? ... Are they chasing us? This is a bad place. No one will go when there's fog. There are big snakes here. Come. Don't be afraid. He's smart. He eats only grass. How did you find me? My brother was looking after you. We couldn't help. We have only few warriors. We could only watch. Brother came and said, "The one that flew down is being taken to the witches. There's one arm of warriors with him and the sorcerer." Then I said, "The one who flew down nabu nabu Andrei. The great chief Andrei." Father is sick. We need a new chief. Now you are my man. You will be our chief. It's clear? You laugh, I'll kill you. I am Chief's daughter. It's clear? It's clear! What happened after that? After that is simple. We caught up with you in the forest, where one needs to sleep. - That's it. Katuradzh. - They caught your brother? Brother rode away. They caught another warrior. - You can hear that far? - I hear in here. Here I hear the sorcerer and his men looking for our traces. Soon they come here. Come, Father is waiting for us. Daddy is waiting for us... Aha... - Follow me. - I'm going back. Oktin Khash still has Zhan. I know, Zhan is now the sacrifice. - What sacrifice? - Oktin Khash wants the witches to be kind. You were a sacrifice. A good sacrifice. You ran away. So now Zhan will be the sacrifice. Zhan is alive and I will save him. You will be a real chief. You think we will win? All right. We'll go to the place where the mountain is cut open by a dagger. My brother is waiting there. We'll think. He's smart. Wait a second. - Where does this road lead? - Nowhere. - Has it been here long? - It's been here forever. It's an old road. - That's interesting. And who made it? - The old people. They lived here before us. - And where are they now? - It's clear. They died. Katuradzh. - Let's go. I don't like it. - What don't you like? The whole steppe knows I stole you. They are looking for us. Let's go. I'll catch up with you. Who are you? Are you a boy or a girl? A boy. That's U-ush. Very bad. You are a real warrior. A real warrior needs an iron knife. Where do you get such knives? You can't make them, can you? No. The witches gave them to us until Oktin Khash came. And where do the witches get them from? It's clear. The witches can make them, right? And what did the witches need me for? The witches would have given you to the big fish. Katuradzh. And you don't want that? What would we need a dead chief for? My man has defeated U-ush! You are a real warrior. I'll think up a song. And I'll sing about you, all right? Well, I don't really need a song. My man has defeated U-ush! It's the witches' gorge. The horses will be here. - Why? - Need to. We can go in. - Your brother is waiting for us in there? - Yes. There's a cave there. Let's go. - I am walking and they are watching. - Who "they"? The old people? - No, the witches. - What are they like? Those witches? They are like... also old.. scary...they glow. The fire arrows! Run! - It's the witches! - Just move! - It's the witches! - Where's the cave? - The witches! The witches! - Where's the cave? The cave! - There! - Let's go! Whoa! Quiet! Come here. It's a good animal. I told it that we came. You are my man. You are kind to me. You won't beat me. No guarantees there. Come here. Come here. It's good here. Come here. - Do you have many wives? - I don't have any wives. Such warrior as you should have many wives. As many as there are fingers. - And I don't have any. - Or maybe you are sick? - No. If you don't want to live with me, you can take my sister as your wife. She's pretty. - And what if I agree to that? - I'll be happy.... Only then I'll kill my sister. - No, it's not how we do it where I'm from. We have a different law. - What law? - Back there a man loves only one woman. - What does it mean - "to love"? "To love"? Well, love is... a feeling. It's when one person leaves and the other one feels bad without that person. Well, to love is to love... Too many unknown words. Let's go look for food. You can't walk around like that in the woods. Any animal will eat you that way. Oh, you... Here, eat. You can't eat everything right? You sound like my conscience. Is it hard for you? Uh, is what hard for me? Like, being by yourself here? Like, you're just totally okay to sit here all day by yourself? That's why I took the job. Mmhm. Okay. And while you're here, by yourself, you never get this almost uncontrollable urge to talk to people, or be complimented, or... I know everyone in this town, so for the most part, I would rather be here by myself than engage in meaningless conversation with people I don't care about. Totally. Mmhm... And why is that? Because I enjoy my own company more. Of course. Of course. Okay. Can I have everyone's attention, please? If I could just-okay. Thanks, Jazzagals. I just wanted to grab your ear for just a second, to make a quick announcement. I will not be at rehearsals for the next two weeks, because... I have decided to throw my hat in the ring, and run for council! Oh, Jocelyn! That's great! Oh my gosh! That's amazing! I'm currently running unopposed. So that kinda takes away the excitement of winning, you know, but still, I think it's gonna be a real hoot. That's so fun! Congratulations! Good going! Good for you! Thank you. That's awesome! That's great! So Jocelyn, good for you. Taking on a new little project. Thanks I'm really looking forward to it. You know what's funny, just this morning, Twyla asked me if I was running for council. That is funny. I mean, unless you're thinking of running. Mm, no. No, no. - Can you imagine? - No! I mean, just because you've spent all your time trying to sell the town and get outta here, so. Twyla dear, what was it this morning that made you say I would make such a great councilwoman? Oh, I just heard you were running. - Are you? - No! I... She's not interested in politics! Although I can see why someone might think that. I certainly know how to command a crowd, and I've never been one to shy away from a good fight. I don't think it's such a bad idea for someone else to run. A little healthy competition never hurt anyone. Yeah, a real election race could be fun! Absolutely, I mean, I wouldn't want anyone to think that I was just stepping into this, you know, because of Roland. Yeah, I mean, if any of you townies wanna put your name on the ballot, I think that's just a great idea. That's the spirit. If Jocelyn can do it, anyone can. - Yeah. - Yeah. Places! Don't you think? Hmm... On a scale of one to I'm-gonna-get-beat-up by-an-angry-local, where do we see this look fall? Um, like, easy six. - Okay. - Where are you going? I am going to a sketchy bar on the outskirts of town. And nobody invited me? ! You know how at home I am at sketchy bars! Who are you going with? With Stevie, we're gonna meet some randoms. So um, when I go missing, just feel free to tell people that the last place I was seen was at a sketchy bar on the outskirts of town meeting randoms. Okay well, this isn't fair, David. I'm the one who should be at a sketchy bar meeting randoms. I'm the one who should go missing! - Well then, come! - I can't. - Why? - Well, for one thing, this mask doesn't come off for another twenty minutes. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. And... second, I told myself that I would enjoy my own company tonight. Okay um, well, we're going to a bar, and you're on the rebound, so text me when you're dressed. I'm serious, David, I'm not coming. Have fun, though. Oh, and in case you wake up in a chair with your hands duct taped together, you can snap the duct tape by just raising your hands over your head, and then bringing them down really hard. Thanks. Um... see you there? I'm not coming. I'm not coming. Hi, Moira. How was rehearsal? It was quite an afternoon. Oh John, thank you. Listen, I just wanted to thank you - for what you said this morning. - And what's that? When we had our little talk about me running for council. I have to admit I'd given it a little more thought than I'd let on. - Oh? - Yes. I actually picked up a nomination form. Really John, I didn't realize. No, no, no, I'm glad you talked me out of it. - Okay. - Yeah, because I thought about the job, what it would entail, and you know, listen, Roland drives me crazy when he's not even around, - but can you imagine? - No! Working with him every day? Huh! I'm laughing about it right now. Did you know Jocelyn is running? No, oh my God! This gets better and better. So the two of them on council together? Is there a more frightening thought? They would have a virtual monopoly on this town. Well, don't they already? Exactly, I think someone needs to challenge them! Right! So... what are you saying? - That I should run? - No. Nope. Because I did get five signatures on my nomination form, and I... No! No, no, no, John, you've got enough on your plate. - Oh. - Whereas I... have nothing but free time. I'm not exactly sure... where this is going. John, you have the family to think about. You're going to accomplish wonderfully big things. Town council would just, hold you back. But something tells me it will not be... holding you back? It would be a few weeks of my time. And you know, someone said it might be a nice project for me. And would that someone be you? Jocelyn practically begged me to take the bait! So you're running for council? ! - Looks like it. - Oh well, isn't that wonderful! Isn't that wonderful! Hey, that's really good news. I'm sorry, John, I just got swept up in it. No, no, listen as long as one of us is running, okay? That's the important thing. It doesn't matter which one of us is running. I thought it would be me, but then you talked me out of it! But that's okay! Please John, I'm going to need you every step of the way. And I'll be right behind you Moira, supporting you, because... you're the one running, and I'm not! How long are we going to be doing this? Oh, just a few more minutes, at least. It's not usually this dead. It's like everybody saw you coming, and left. Is this really what our lives have become? Sitting in some sad... bar waiting to get laid? Well it's this, or the Internet. Oh, I did have a match earlier. Um who is... 79 miles away. Well, if you start walking now, you'll get there before breakfast. Alexis is supposed to be meeting us here. She said she wasn't coming, but this is a bar, and she is single, so. Well, you should warn her that we are the only people here under sixty. Yeah, it's not... not brimming with options. No. - Nope. - No! - No, it didn't feel right. - No, it didn't. Well, at least we tried. I agree. Oh, uh, I notice that man is no longer sleeping under the pool table. Well, I'm surprisingly good at pool. - So... - Hmm! Wait a second, is this like a reverse hustle, where you say you're good, but you're actually terrible? Um, I don't know. Do you wanna break? Um, from what? Oh, this is gonna be fun. Don't, David. I have nowhere else to put stuff. It's just a checkpoint. Okay, I've been through tons of these in Johannesburg. It's like a drive-thru, except everybody has a gun. When were you in Johannesburg? I remember I'd just got my braces off, so... You were 14, in South Africa? - No! - Yes! Ha! Ina! Ina, get UP! Come here. Ina, we need to go right now! - Get up! We need to go! - You're scaring me. Please, listen to me. Ina, we have to go! Right now! Please, please, just leave! Ina, leave me! You need to get out of here right now! Now! The Lord has delivered you unto me and I will take thy head from thee! 1912, the year that marks the sinking of the Titanic the debut of the Oreo cookie, just look it up, and also one of the puzzling and notorious murders in Iowa history. Today marks 100 years since the Villisca Axe Murders. A century-old unsolved axe murder, eight people hacked to death, has intrigued 21st Century forensic scientists and investigators around the world. Okay, I think I just saw something move behind the camera. If this is Lena or Ina, please let me know you're in here. Lena? Ina? Hello? And finally, we've reached the number one most haunted place in America. I'd been a paranormal investigator for about 11 years and up to that point, I'd never... The most grisly, terrifying, unsolved murders of the 20th Century. Okay. You have one new message. Hey, Caleb, this is mom. I have to do a double shift today, so I won't be home until at least after nine or ten tonight. Just a reminder, tomorrow before you leave, I'd like to visit the cemetery, of course... Too early to start celebrating? I'm being sad. Come on, man. It's your last day of school, ever! - Denny? - Yo. This town blows, man. Tell me about it, dude. - You don't know. - Yeah, I know. You don't know. Excuse us! Coming through! We survived. - Thank you for the ride, Denny. - Of course, buddy. By the way, what are we doing tonight? Oh, all will be revealed this evening. I'll tell ya, Denny, I will not miss your cryptic bullshit. What are you talking about? You love my cryptic bullshit. It's like one of my major features. Shut up. No, you did not. Oh... Look who's here, everybody's favorite faggot. Why don't you back off, Connor? Yeah, I'm not talking to you, freak. God, I haven't seen you since, what, last summer, buddy? Underneath the bleachers, remember? You had Jerry Fletcher's dick in your mouth. Caleb! Caleb, stop it! Fucking psycho. Just like your old man. Oh, yeah! Hit me, come on, do it! Stop! Shut up and back up! Do you want me to call your dad again? No, ma'am. And Dennis, what are you doing here? I'm sorry, Mrs. Flanks. I just wanted to give Caleb a ride on his last day. - I'm sure he'd love that. - Fuck you, Connor. Not one more word! It's a nice sentiment, Dennis. But would you please take your little bike and get off my campus? Sure thing, Mrs. Flanks. Later, Caleb. Bye, buddy. Boys, the gymnasium is this way. Why don't we all go together? Oh my gosh, you have to see this. I heard about it all last week. So excited. - Excited? - You know what I mean. I do. I bookmarked it. - Hey, bitch. - Dude. That girl in the bathroom, she passed out. - You wanna know... - What, what? The new girl! The new girl from Chicago! Fuckin' camera! Give me the camera. - What's your name? - I'm Connor. - Connor? - Yeah. You guys are weird here. What do you mean, here? In Iowa. What's wrong with Iowa? Who lives in Iowa? I live in Iowa. We live in Iowa. That can't be her. Don't be stupid. It's definitely her. Hi. HEY" - What do you want, Rob? - Connor wants to talk to you. Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen. Everybody knows you're gonna come crawling back. Sun. - What do you want? - Nothing, man. - Such a bitch. - Yeah. Did you see what I wrote on her locker? - No, man. - It's right here. Oh, fuck! Ah! Oh, shit! - He started it. - Go to the nurse. You, in my office. Now. Come on. Quick time. Sorry about that. Don't be. Kid's a jerk. I told you if you focused you'd be in and out of here by the end of the month. Any plans? I'm leaving for Omaha tomorrow. My uncle owns a motel. Said I could have a job if I had this. Well, listen, before you take off I'd like to have a little chat with you. I know this has been a difficult time for you and your mom. But, Caleb, when you walk out that door there's nothing else I can do for you. I wasn't expecting you to. That's not what I meant, Caleb. I know you're a smart kid. But life is about the choices we make. And we have to do our best to make the good ones. Otherwise, we get stuck living in the bad ones. Okay.. Let me know how it goes in Omaha. Hey! So today is a pretty exciting day for me. For the final outing of the Maryville Paranormal Institute we will be visiting the boss fight of ghost houses. Villisca. As always, I will be joined by my best friend and fellow ghost hunter, Caleb. Countdown begins now. Tonight. The Villisca Axe Murder House. Love you, mom. You gotta know, Jess, in a couple of months all this shit's gonna go away. It's already been a couple of months, Ellie. And, today, while I was at school two girls were watching it again. God, I hate this place. I miss you guys. I miss Chicago. Get your ass back here and stop hanging out with farmers. Uh, you know, actually this kind of cool thing did happen today at school. Yeah? So Rob came up to me today and was like, "Connor wants to talk to you." And I just walked away and he was yelling all this mean shit at me. And then this other kid, I think his name is Caleb, he went up to Rob and just slammed his face into the locker. - What? - Yeah. - It was awesome. - Yeah. Okay, uh, what's his last name? Um... - Hirsche? - Hirsche. - What? How did you... - Facebook. Geographic search. - Perfect for stalking. - Oh, my God, you're creepy. - Wait a minute. - What? He's got his address on Facebook. "And? 'Go! No, Ellie. Look, at least go tell him to take his fucking address off Facebook. Jess, you are a Chicago woman. Do this, bitch! Come on! Okay, okay, okay, fine. Whatever. I'll go... to his house. But if I get murdered, it's totally your fault. Girl, please, nothing ever happens in Iowa. Give me that. You can take that. Brooks Brothers? Where'd you get a Brooks Brothers shirt? Not this one. No. Now, what time are you leaving tomorrow? Around noon. Greyhound. Awesome. What, riding the bus? No, seriously. Going someplace else, getting out of here... It's awesome. What's up? - Nothing. - Denny. Nothing. I mean... It's like two hours away. You can visit any time you want. Oh, shit. We gotta move. - For what? - The tour. - Dude, no. - Yeah. We've been planning this for like, two months, dude. The Maryville Paranormal Institute. - We're not even close. - The Villisca Axe Murder House. Last video. Big finish. - No. - You promised. You promised to help me pack but Instead we got drunk, so... Well... me and your "high school equivalency..." This isn't even a real diploma. What are you... What are you doing? - We're going to Villisca. - No, no, no. - Oh, no. Did I rip it... - Don't, don't. Denny! - Give me that... - Now, easy. Denny, really, don't make me hurt you. Hun? Give it! Give it to me! - What, what, what? - Quit fucking around. Hah. - Oh. - Am I interrupting something? HEY" Your name is Jessica, right? This is Denny. Yeah. We gotta go, dude. We're gonna miss our tour. - Where are you guys going? - Somewhere you're not. Ow. - You wanna come? - Are you sure? I mean, it seems like you guys have it all figured out. C.. C... Caleb, we don't have room for her on the scooter. I can drive. - Great, let me get my jacket. - Dude, what the fuck, man? I only made reservations for two people. Denny, they're not gonna give a shit if we bring one more person. Use your brain. I like your jacket. Yeah, I know. That's why I wear it. Okay. Let's go. Here. - He doesn't have a license. - Then drive carefully. Okay. Come on, Denny. It's the way to Villisca. Shot gun. This is a nice car. So, where are we going exactly? Villisca. Isn't that like a sinus medication? What? You know what I'm talking about? The Axe Murder House. Everyone knows what that is. I'm not from here. Well, I guess that's something that's good about you. Dude, 74 views on our last video! - I'm driving here! - Oh. What is he talking about? We do this video ch... YouTube Channel thing with Supernatural. MPI. We are the Maryville Paranormal Institute. - I was just telling her... - I got it. Caleb and I are... We're ghost hunters. We hunt ghosts! Yeah. He can be a little intense about it. No, it's... It's cool. Where is everybody? They're all dead. I'm kind of not joking. Back in the day, there was this Indian tribe here and they called this area "Wallisca." They used to bury their outcasts and their insane in shallow graves here so they couldn't move on. You mean like that movie Poltergeist? Little girl, broken TV? But this is something different, Jess. Eight people, six of them kids, got their heads smashed in in 1912. - You scared yet? - Totally. - Are you Denny? - Yes, sir. Hah. I was just about to give up and go. Well, I'm so glad you didn't. We drove all the way from Maryville. Nice house. All right. Welcome to the Villisca Axe Murder House. All right. This is the, uh, foyer. Okay, so, the murders took place on the night of June 9th, 1912. There'd been a big gathering at the Presbyterian church in town. They called it "Children's Day." Ever since then, this house has been marked by an evil greater than you can imagine. People just like you have seen and heard... Um, young lady, this way. Everything will make more sense if we start the tour from upstairs. Come along. It's believed the killer entered the house around midnight. Climbed these very stairs... Right this way. J.B. Moore was the first to get it. And then his wife, Sarah. Mrs. Moore was hit 35 times on the top of her head with the blunt side of the axe. Totes crayballs. Uh, beg your pardon? Let's, uh, go to the children's room. It's right down this way. Come on. Follow me. Herman was the oldest child, he was 11. Paul was the youngest, he was only four. And Boyd was the middle. Little Catherine Moore's room was right over here. All but one of the victims were found flat against their bed. Why is the mirror covered? Well, they found all the mirrors covered that way the next day. The thought is that the murderer wanted to cover 'em up before he began to kill. Hey. They caught the killer, right? No. But there was this one guy, a traveling Presbyterian minister. He confessed but was never... Reverend Lyn George Jacklin Kelly. I did my research. We come to places like this all the time. In his confession, Kelly stated that he woke up in the middle of the night hearing windmills in his head. And then he went for a walk and ended up here. Okay. Thanks. I'll just put this back. What happened to him? No one knows. But, you guys wanna see something super cool? We have the murder weapon. Right here. Come on. That, my friends, is the actual axe itself. A one-of-a-kind piece of bloody lowan history and genuine American craftsmanship. Genuine. Okay. Right this way. Caleb. Let me see your teeth. Aah! Murder boner. I'm not a religious man, but I don't see your being here as anything short of God's will. You think God sent me? I don't see how else this could've happened. I mean, seriously. I need a drink. I think we all need a drink. - Tussin? - I like grape cut with ginger ale. Coming up. - Is that cough syrup? - Oh, yeah, see, where we're from in Oklahoma was dry... No beer, no wine, no booze. You had to make do. He likes it straight. I'll admit it's an acquired taste, and, uh, I sure as hell acquired it. All right, so, after I finish this, uh, cough-syrup cocktail thingie, then, uh... We'll have some, uh, business, I guess. - [giggles] - First, let's drink. Cheers. - [glasses clink] - Cheers. Oh. So... [clears throat] Here's the thing, George. The fact that we're both such huge fans and that we should run into you in the middle of nowhere is clearly remarkable, but how do I put this? I am your number-one fan. Oh, this is like "Misery." Wait a minute... I'm James Caan, and you two are Kathy Bates. [both laughing] Oh, he's even funnier in real life. Yeah, George, nobody's gonna break your legs. Unless you want us to. You see, George, you're Edna's pass. It was between you and David Hasselhoff, and, boy, did I choose right. Pass? Uh... You know, it's when you pick a celebrity, the one person that you could be with that wouldn't be considered cheating. It's a game. It's a fantasy... you know, unless it becomes real. Wow. [clears throat] So you... you... You want me to have sex with Edna and then what, I... - Then I can go? - Let you go? - Um... - Oh, my God. You think we kidnapped you... [crying] And the ransom is forcing you to be with me. Oh, my God. [Edna sobbing] Now you've gone and done it. Oh, my God. Come on, honey. [sniffling] I'm so embarrassed! Edna, it's... it's George. - I'm coming in, okay? - Okay. I'll fix it. Good enough. I'm going for a drive. I'll be gone for a while. Wait. You don't have to be gone for a while. I'm coming in. Edna? Uh... Obviously you would never want to be with me. I mean, look at me. I just feel so stupid. No, Edna, I'm flattered. It's just... [sighs] I'm really not into swinging. "Swinging"? Broughton and I aren't swingers. You were just my pass. Annie Potts was Broughton's pass. - Annie Potts? - Yeah. I mean, I never really thought I would actually meet you, and then you just appeared like magic. But then you've always been like magic. Whenever I felt down, I could just watch you, and I'd feel better. So... Wow, wow. You picked me over Hasselhoff, huh? Yeah, and that's when he was on "Baywatch." Wow. You just always brought me so much happiness. I thought it would be so great if I could bring you some, you know, show my appreciation. Appreciate me? You look a lot more stressed than you do on TV. [chuckles] Yeah, well, in real life, I always have to hold things in because I'm George Lopez. I can't fight back. Well, you don't have to worry about any of that now. You just need to relax. Well, I got to tell you, this Tussin is helping. ♪ It's all right, yeah ♪ Come on! Mm, that's when Carlos Santana was on. That's my favorite. Of course it is. You just enjoy. Wow. Carlos Santana! Yeah. [chuckles] All right. [sighs] Oh. [groans] Good morning. - Well, rise and shine. - Hey. What time is it? - It's almost noon. - Wow, I slept all night? I haven't done that in years. Hope it made you hungry. I made flapjacks and ham and eggs. Oh, great. Uh, you guys aren't gonna eat? Oh, I already did. I'm gonna hang this up before it gets wrinkled. My clothes... Wait, you ironed my clothes? Well, you slept in them, and they were already pretty wrinkled. Hey, Broughton, I know my clothes are wrinkled and everything, but I'm not positive about what happened with, you know, the pass. George, I don't need you to sleep with my wife. It was a pass. If it was used, fine. If it wasn't used, fine. My man. Hey, I'll take a little bit of the hair of the dog that bit me. Well, now, I believe you were a grape man. - I am. - Uh-huh. I'm a old-school cherry man myself, but I will join you. Yeah, I better not mix. No, no, never mix, never worry. Hey, it's G.L. You got my voice mail. You know what to do. [sighs] He better be dead. Well, I'll get you back to your car, get her gassed up. - I better get to work. - What do you do? Well, I'm a treasure hunter. I want to go. So you just hope to find a watch someday? That'd be fine, but... [metal detector squealing] [laughing] How about this? Wow. Is that from a six-shooter? Yeah. I've found everything out here, from bullets to gold nuggets. Gold nuggets. It's rare. It happens. You know, I would always drive by so fast and see a house like yours out in the desert, and I'd think to myself, "What kind of inbred [bleep] lives way out here?" [laughs] Yeah. But, you know, when you stop and look around, it's... it's beautiful. It's beautiful to me because it's freedom. Until Edna and I moved out here, George, I was miserable. People nonstop coming at you with needing things, wanting things... Demanding things. "Hey, George, take a selfie with me." "Hey, George, give me some money." And not so much as a "please" or a "thank you." That's right. I live life on my terms. Now I feel great every damn day. Wow. Yeah, me too. I don't have any stomachaches. I don't have a headache. A-a-and I can't tell you the last time... [inhales deeply] I could breathe like that. That's the Tussin... Opens the nasal passages. [metal detector squeals] [metal detector beeping] Oh. - Huh? - Look at that. - Ah. - I found a fork. [cheers and applause] Hey, it's G.L. You got my voice mail. - You know what to do. - No, nothing. George is clearly on a bender. I have to pivot. Uh, season three. - [laughs] - No! That character wasn't even introduced until season four. I never watched the show. I guess I got to drink. You know, George, we do have some beer in the fridge if you prefer. No. Hey, man, when in Rome... You know, I-I could be in Rome. I don't know where I am. [all giggle] [knock at door] - Who is it? - It's the sheriff. Open up. Uh, I'm not here. I'm not here. So we ran the plates on the abandoned car. Now, this is where it gets weird. The car is a Chebby. It is registered to a Tiddlypie, but it was last seen driven by George Lopez, the comedian. We know George Lopez. Well, he's been missing for almost two days, and there's a fear he might've been kidnapped, maybe worse. And the person last seen with him was you, Broughton. - George, did we kidnap you? - George Lopez! - Did we kidnap you? - No. Yeah, I need to... see him. I wasn't kidnapped. I was hanging out. [sighs] Well, apparently you were expected in Las Vegas, but because of your personal history, there was a great deal of worry. Does this mean I have to leave? I don't really care, but you do need to get that Chebby off the side of the road. Well, all right, Gus. Good to see you. Tell your dad I said hello. Will do. Will do. - There you go. - All right. - Take care now. - All right. [chuckles] George, I'll get you some gas and get you on your way. You know, I don't want to leave. I have to make sure I had sex with Edna, and then we're gonna go out and try to find some gold. Hey, you have to help me find a spoon for my fork. [chuckles] And then the Tussin, man. Come on. George... you got to go. I mean, this ain't about Edna or treasure hunting or Tussin. I mean, hell, you can get Tussin anywhere. - Yeah, but I won't... - If you want it, you will. That's what it's all about. It's like Shakespeare wrote... "To thine self be true" and just eliminate the bullshit. What? That last part... that's not Shakespeare, thought, right? Right, but it's true. And, George... if you had a pass to have sex with anyone... would it be me? Well, you know, Edna, y-you're a beautiful woman, sweet. You ironed my clothes. But maybe, you know, it'd be like Eva Longoria or Jessica Alba. Exactly, George. You need to go, and deep down, you want to go. We didn't kidnap you. I think you wanted us to kidnap you from all your troubles. Wait a minute. That... Is that... That's not Shakespeare too, is it? Better. Season six... It's what your wife said when you wouldn't go on that school camping trip. - Oh, man. - [laughing] Come on. Wow, "Lopez Tonight," the Santana episode. Oh. I can't take this. We want you to have it. Um... thanks. [uplifting guitar music] I don't have a VCR, but I-I'm gonna get one. Go and pack my clothes. To thine self be true. Just have to eliminate the bullshit. [both laughing] If I had that on a T-shirt, I know I'd remember. You're gonna be fine. If you guys are ever in LA, you got to look me up. Hey. I think I can get to Annie Potts. - Oh-ho-ho. - Thank you, Broughton. - You're a hell of a guy. - Adiós. [engine turning over] Move! [laughs] [electronic dance music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [car hissing] Finally they put me through to you. Hey, this Chebby is a piece of shit. It's barely running. Does it smell like bitter almonds? It smells like almonds. I don't know if it's bitter. - Get out of the car. - Okay, I'm out. Relax. Walk away. Do not go back in the car. We will take care of it. - All right, listen, I parked it at... - We know where it is. Just walk away. Have fun in Vegas. [car sputters, groaning] Hey, Olly, why is Tiddlypie on my marquee? My name is Robert Sepulveda Jr. I'm 33 years old, originally from Puerto Rico. I founded RSJ Design, an award-winning interior design firm, currently based in Atlanta. I'm also the president and founder of the Atlanta Rainbow Crosswalks, which is a nonprofit historic art project. I'm definitely a hopeless romantic. I'm looking for love, I'm looking for marriage. I'm looking for that white picket fence dream. It's my turn to find love. My parents are the biggest support system. They have accepted me through everything, and my sister as well. She gives the most amazing advice and I can trust her. She's my best friend. I've accomplished things in my career. I've accomplished things in the community. But there's a missing piece, and that missing piece is someone that I can just hang out with, somebody that I can travel with. I want what everybody wants. To share my life with someone special. My dream guy? He's articulate. He's smart. He's gorgeous. Has good family values. I'm ready for someone that's a go-getter, and most importantly, has an amazing heart. I'm excited that I'm Prince Charming. I'm making history here. I get to meet 13 amazing guys and they're looking for love, just like me. But this is a competition, and one by one, I will be eliminating these men until I find my perfect guy. This journey is about finding love. Connections will be made, but hearts are also gonna be broken. But in the end, I know I'll leave here with the man of my dreams. Thank you. You're welcome. How's it going, Robert? How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you too, definitely. Wow. Here we are. Here we are. About to embark on this crazy experience. Now, this is a game-changer. I mean, it's 2016. And there has not been an all-gay dating show. Exactly. So tonight will be very interesting because you're gonna get to enter the house as one of the suitors, so this is the best way to get a real first impression on all of these guys. Are you nervous? Do you think this is gonna work? First of all, I'm gonna enjoy this. I think this is an amazing way to really see how they are without them knowing that I'm their Prince Charming. Now, I have to ask the question. Some of these guys might be going in the house thinking it's summer camp, wanting to hook up. What are you gonna do if that happens? Well, that's why I'm doing what I'm doing tonight. I really want to get, like, an unfiltered look at what these guys are thinking, what they're doing. Yeah, this is gonna be interesting but I-- I'm loving the opportunity to do this. So what are you wanting to happen by the end of this? You know, I hope I meet someone just honest, genuine, but at the end of the day, I want to find someone that I can build a life with. That's my goal, is to meet someone that I can continue my path with, basically. Well, I'm excited. I am so excited. I mean, to be next to you during this whole adventure. Because an adventure it is gonna be. And we're gonna find you true love. Good. Ready for this? Yeah, cheers to that. All right, cheers to that. Cheers to love. To love. Thank you, Lance. I'm Eric, I'm 35 and I'm from Los Angeles. When people first get to know me, I'm quiet and I'm shy. It's a protection mechanism, because growing up in Texas as a gay man was definitely a challenge. I've been single for a little bit over two-and-a-half years. Currently, I feel like I've just been trying to present myself in the most authentic way I possibly can and be true to myself. Hi. Thank you. I'm Paul. I am 34, from Dallas, Texas. I moved there with my ex and we were engaged at the time. He passed away this last Thanksgiving and I think that I have learned how to be a better partner as a result of being with him. The one thing that I think still makes me lonely and frustrated at times is that the experience of sharing a life is something that is so much more rich than experiencing it alone. I'm Paul. Eric. Eric? Nice to meet you. Good to meet you. How's it going? Well, it's really nice to meet you. You have amazing eyes, by the way. Thank you. Yeah. So, when I first walked in, Eric was the only person there and my first thought was that he was the Prince Charming that we were all going to be vying for, and I actually, to be honest, was excited about that, 'cause he seems like a really great guy and he's obviously very attractive. I genuinely want to get a chance to meet all these guys without any pretense. I think for me, this is an amazing opportunity to get to know them and not have them know who I really am. I like San Francisco to visit, but I don't- - I don't think I would want to live there. Hi, guys. Hey. Hi. Robert, how are you? How's it going? Eric. Hi, Eric, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Robert? Yeah, Robert. Paul. Pleasure. Pleasure to meet you. Cheers. Cheers. Nice to meet you guys. Yeah, it's a pleasure to meet you as well. This is gonna be an interesting experience. It-- I was telling Eric, this is completely outside of my comfort zone. Yeah. The first two guys that I see are Paul and Eric. Paul is striking and Eric is just as striking and I know that it's gonna be an amazing few weeks. Hi, I'm Dillon. Sorry. Hi, Dillon. Eric. Hi. Dillon. Dillon? Paul. Pleasure to meet you, Paul. Hi, Robert. Dillon. Pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. I'm Dillon, I'm 26 and I live in Los Angeles, California. Originally from New Orleans, Louisiana. I come from a big family, you know. They accept that I'm gay. I'm the only gay person that I know in both sides of my family. Are you excited about all this? Uh... I think so. Yeah? I'm nervous. Yeah? We all-- We all are. Anxious, nervous. We're all nervous, yeah. I'm like, what's next, what's going on? Hi. How's it going? Good, how are you? Hello. Hi. Hi, everyone. Hello. I'm Brandon. Hi. Brandon? Paul. Hi. Hi. Wow. Weird places. And left there about five pounds heavier. Hi. Hi. Hello. How's it going? How are you? You can stop by the bar if you want. Yeah, can I? I feel like it's rude. My name's Jasen. I'm 33 years old and I live in New York City. I think a lot of people think if you are gay, you can't be in a monogamous relationship. That to me is very untrue. I'm always monogamous. I want to be with somebody who I can wake up next to every day and share my life with, but then, like, be passionate about and have, like, really great sex and have really great conversation, have really great moments with. We're all gonna be friends. All right. So we might as well get comfortable, right? Sounds good. At this point, my ears are perking up. My radar is on full blast. I'm still undercover and I want to know what's gonna happen when I'm not around in the house, so I am definitely digging for gold. I think you're the tallest one here. How tall are you? Well, I usually am in most places. What are you? Like, six-three? Six-three? Okay. Good call. Nice. Six-three also, yeah. Okay. I'm six-two on a good day. Are you? Yeah. I try. Yeah, I think so. You know, it's a strange thing, so all of my exes have been five-eleven and below. Okay. How does that make you feel? Most guys are shorter than me, so it makes it easy. But you generally go for short guys. Yeah, I do. Okay. Yeah. I thought that we may have been a match, but I can't change what he is and isn't into, you know? I'm not gonna shrink, so I'm definitely thinking, exit stage left, please. My name's Justin. I'm 29 years old. And I live in sunny Seattle, Washington. I am coming into this with an open heart and an open mind. I have no idea who I'm about to meet and who this Prince Charming is going to be. Being gay isn't all pride and pageantry. I'm a man. I'm a man who also wants to be in love and, you know, there's a part of that that people don't realize, like, gay dating is the same as straight dating. There's still a courtship. There's still these nerves that you get before a first date. Based on who's already here, I don't know what my chances are, so... I'm hoping there are not that many more. Well, hey, cheers. Cheers, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. This is really exciting. So, yeah. Yeah. Do you know any of the guys here? Um, not yet. Oh, actually, I do now. That's so funny you say that. There you go. Yeah? Fate. That's so crazy. Oh, my God. I know... I know you. Hi. So good to see you. How are you? Good to see you, too. I'm Chad. I'm 32 years old. And I live in New York City. I came out because I fell in love with someone I met on the Internet when I was 19. I have been in love before. You don't plan for it. You don't look for it, necessarily, when it happens. If you're looking for it, it doesn't usually happen. I'm not here looking for love. I'm here being open to something great. Are we just-- Are we waiting for one of us to announce that he's our Prince Charming? And he's just been listening in. That would be weird. Well, I'm really nervous about, you know, not being honest, or being a little sneaky, but I think this is a good way to gauge the guys, so I'm gonna try to stand back a little bit and just let everybody talk. This man looks like the prototype Disney prince. If this is my competition, I have no chance whatsoever. Were you born in Jersey? I was, yeah. Okay. Why, were you born in Jersey, also? No, I just could tell. Do I sound like a Jersey person? Yes... But I like it. So at this point, I am very nervous because they still don't know who I am. I think there's a room full of amazing men. There's a room full of Prince Charmings, but the next step is to reveal that the Prince Charming in this moment is gonna be me. Hello. Hi. Welcome. How you doing? How you guys doing? I'm sure this is not intimidating at all. No. I'm not. Just a little bit. We all went through it. My name's Brodney. I'm 34 and I live in Atlanta, Georgia. I went through, like, a really, really bad relationship and working out was kind of, like, my therapy, and that's when I fell in love with exercising. I've known that I was gay ever since I was four or five years old. You don't even know about sexuality at that age, but you know what you feel. Are you from L.A.? No. I used to live in L.A., though. Where do you live now? Atlanta. Oh, I live in Atlanta. Yeah? Yeah. That's why you look familiar. Hi. Right. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? Are you nervous? You look nervous. A little nervous. Robert. Charlie. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. Charlie walks in, he's like, dripping sweat, nervous like a deer in headlights. Cheers. Welcome. Cheers. Yeah, welcome. Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good, how are you? I'm Dillon. Hi, I'm Nick. Nice to meet you, Dillon. Hi. The second face that I see when I walk in this room is this man who looks like the prototype Disney prince, and I thought, if this is my competition, I have no chance whatsoever. Yeah. Hello. Oh, how are you? Welcome. Yeah. I'm Brandon. Danique. Danique, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I think everyone's sizing up the competition, and right now, I am competition, 'cause they don't know who I really am. This is perfect for me. I'm loving it. Hi. How are you guys? How are you? I'm Sam. Danique. Nice to meet you. Robert. Sam, nice to meet you. My name is Sam, I'm 31 years old and I'm from Chicago. The dating life for me in Chicago has been very difficult. It's kinda funny, I'll go to a bar and people are on their phones. No one knows how to speak, you know, face to face anymore, I feel like. I've struggled with love. I'm not the best dater out there. I've never had a boyfriend in my life, which is kind of strange at 31 years old. I'm here to put myself out there in a different way. Obviously, what I'm doing isn't working. Ah. Very nice, very good, very good. Here we are. I'm here because I'm taking a chance on love. Now, there's no shortage of love in my life. However, I find this to be such a unique opportunity that I'd be remiss if I were to pass this up. Party's started, bitches! I joke. I kid. How lucky am I? I'm Robby. Brodney. Hi, Robert. Hi, Robert. Robby as well. I like that name, very good. Hi, Robby. Oh, darling. Can you stand it? Can you stand it? How are you? I'm well, Dillon. Good to see you. How are you? It's good to see you. I think Robby's a fun person. His, like, energy, is amazing, and he, like, exudes, like, fun. So it's just us. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers to... What are we "cheersing"? To being the last-- You were the last one. I was the last. They saved the best for last. My name is Robby. I'm 26 years old. I'm from Boston, Massachusetts, but I live in West Hollywood, California. I think people that don't know me find that perhaps I could be a little over the top, but then they come to realize that this is actually who I am, it's what I'm like, it's-- it's me. I'm so grateful to have chosen to be alive during a time where I could be out of the closet. Can you imagine going to an all-Catholic private high school, being on the football team and coming out of the closet at 15 years old and still having the football team rally up behind me, saying, if anyone f's with you, we'll kick their ass. Blonde hair blue-eyed boys do absolutely nothing for me. I like the eyes so dark you can't even see their pupils. If you have that, we're good to go. When are we gonna meet this guy? I don't know. I'm excited to meet him. Yeah. What do you hope he's like? I mean... I hope he's got his shit together and... I don't know. A go-getter. Handsome. Handsome is nice. Handsome's very nice. But handsome can only get you so far. True. You know, so hopefully, he's got, I don't know, family oriented. I'm really close to my family. My family values are very important. So the anticipation is growing. Everybody wants to figure out who Mr. Right is, who Prince Charming is. I'm really a genuine person, so I hope that they forgive me. Where's Mr. Man, though? Maybe he's among us. Maybe he's among us. Is he? Is he among us? It's Lance Bass. Hi. Well, hey, guys. Hey. Is Lance Bass Prince Charming? Oh, my God! Oh! Unfortunately, I am not. He's married, don't try it, queen. Unfortunately, I'm not your Prince Charming today. I'm already taken. Oh! Lance Bass comes on through and if I didn't think we were legit before, we're definitely legit now, we're in this. Welcome to "Finding Prince Charming." I'm Lance Bass and I'm gonna be with you every step of the way on this exciting new journey. Now, I'm assuming you're all here because you want something more in your life. Looking for that companion, that lover, someone you can share those amazing memories with and maybe grow old together. Well, you came to the right place. Because if you play your cards right, one of you is gonna win the heart of our Prince Charming. During your time here, you're gonna have plenty of opportunities to go on dates, heat things up, and really create those special memories where you're tying yourselves together. I'm sure you're curious to meet our Prince Charming. Whoo-hoo! Yes! But before we do, we're gonna go inside because I want to play a little game with you. Come with me. It's about to get real. Right now. Okay, Lance, let's get to it. Where's Prince Charming? All right, I think we all need to get to know each other a little better, so we're gonna play a little game called, tell me about your hashtag self, all right? So how we play this game, one at a time, you're gonna come up here, tell a little bit about yourself, and then I want you to describe yourself in one hashtag. My hashtag would be like, hashtag, if I can find love, you can definitely find love. All right? It's been hard to keep up this sneaky act, this lie, basically, so I am ready to just reveal to the guys who I am and why I had to do what I had to do. So let's start off with Robby. Hashtag, Lance don't make me dance. Well, my name is Robby. Originally from Boston, Massachusetts. I live in Los Angeles now. I work in the beauty business. So my hashtag would be, hashtag, why be a nine when you could be a ten? I've never met anyone like Robby before, except for, like, someone in the theater or something like that. Like, it's like a character. Sam nudges me and he says, it's you. And I'm- - I'm literally sweating bullets at this moment. I am petrified, because I know that he's right, it is me. You know, but I'll reveal myself in time. I guess my hashtag would be, what the fuck Chuck and... Next up, Danique. My name is Danique. I am originally from Atlanta and I'm 30 years old. I found that a lot of people really like my personality, they like me. They just don't really want to be with me in that way. The reason why I'm here is because this is probably the only thing that I haven't tried. Um, what I'm looking for is someone to make me want to be barefoot and pregnant, just waiting for 'em, asking myself, what, when and why did this happen to me? And I guess my hashtag would be... Danique the freak. Danique the freak. I love this guy. I think that he's full of life and I appreciate that. Up next, let's go with... Paul. Oh. If I'd pick a hashtag, it would probably-- Hashtag perfectionist? I just can't get a good read on this guy. Like, is he just being, you know, pompous? I am looking for that spark and my hashtag would be hopeful romantic. Up next... Nick. My hashtag would be, I'm living for love, but haven't found it yet. My name's Nick. I'm 31. And I'm from Hamilton, New Jersey. All my life, I've always kind of approached life like love is just gonna happen and it's not working for me. This is my opportunity to actually come here and take a huge chance to find that very special someone. I've been in relationships before, but I definitely would say that I've never been in love. Let's go with... Jasen. Yeah! I'm 33. I'm from New York City. And my hashtag would be chemistry, 'cause it's all about chemistry for me. My name is Brodney. I'm a personal trainer from Atlanta, Georgia. My hashtag would be ready for love. Hi! I'm Eric. I'm a hairstylist and I think my hashtag would be, hashtag, be myself. Hi, everyone, I'm Dillon. I think my hashtag would be hashtag spontaneity. I want somebody that can take me to the next level. I'm Chad. I am from New York City, and if I had a hashtag, it would be hashtag flexible. Don't take it the wrong way, don't take it the wrong way. Who doesn't like a guy that's flexible? Come on. TMI! What I meant is that I am mentally flexible. I'm mentally flexible. I can do many things at the same time. I'm-- I'm pliable. Well- - Well, you know what I mean. Hi, everyone. I'm Brandon. If my life was a hashtag right now, I would have to say it'd be happiness, 'cause that's all I'm really feeling right now, so I'm excited to be here. I'm Brandon, I'm 29 and I live in Los Angeles. I'm very confident. I'm adventurous and I'm often ridiculous. Me going from homeless alcoholic to where I am today, I've learned that the greatest thing that I can do is connect with people on a day-to-day basis. All right, up next, let's go with Charlie. I am super nervous because I know that my hashtag is coming up and that's gonna be the big reveal. My name is Charlie. I am 26. I am from Wisconsin and I live in Hermosa Beach, currently. A lot of people are surprised to hear that I'm gay or they tell me I don't seem gay. It's always kind of funny, because if they were to check my Internet history, they might think otherwise. But... I guess my hashtag would be what the fuck Chuck and... I feel like Charlie's hashtag matched his personality. All right. Hi, guys, I'm Justin. I live in Seattle, I'm from Portland originally. My hashtag might be, don't limit yourself. There you go, all right. Up next, we're gonna go with Robert. I am petrified, because I know that I'm gonna have to reveal to them that I'm the guy. I'm Prince Charming. My name is Robert Sepulveda, and, um... I am your Prince Charming. No way! Really! Oh, my God! Oh, wonderful. Oh, I love that. Oh, that is so... I mean, did any of y'all have a clue at all? Yes. Right here. Totally had a clue. Oh, my God. I totally suspected that Robert was Prince Charming. He looks like a walking Photoshop. You lie like a rug! Super excited that Robert is our Prince Charming. He's very prince-like, if I do say so myself. All right, Robert. Is there anything you'd like to say to these guys, now that they know you are our Prince Charming? Yeah, well, first of all, I want to apologize for being so sneaky. Going forward now, I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys. We're all taking a leap of faith, looking for real love. I'm looking for my dream man and I hope that I can find that here. Just to let you know... it's gonna be me. Obviously, tonight was all about first impressions, so what do you think? I mean, some guys, I really appreciate them being so honest with me. Other guys, it's gonna be an interesting journey. Um... Don't worry, guys. Tomorrow, you'll get another chance to make another first impression with Robert. 'Cause we're gonna have a little soiree by the pool tomorrow. Yay. So you'll have all day to take in some sun, and more importantly, get to know your Prince Charming. And it's very important that you do, because, unfortunately, tomorrow night, some of you will be heading home. I know I said hashtag chemistry as my hashtag and I felt chemistry, like, I really want to stay here and make a connection with Robert. There are some things that I need to look for, too, because we both need to see if we're interested in each other. All right, guys. This is where we're gonna have to leave you. Enjoy the house, get to know each other better. Unfortunately, I have to take Mr. Prince Charming with me. You'll get to see him tomorrow on your little soiree. All right? Say your goodbyes. Bye, guys. See you tomorrow. Robert is definitely a very, very handsome man, but I could tell he was won over by me when he first saw me. I hope that doesn't sound cocky, but it's just... I know it. Do you know him? Hmm? Do you know him? No, I just-- We go to the same gym, so I see him all the time, so... That's cool. Eh, kinda. But then you think about, like, what kind of impression have I made before, like, when I saw him on the machine, did I speak to him? Did I... da-da-da-da, da. You know? So I've seen Robert before. We've never interacted back home. So when I walked in here to say, are there sparks between he and I, I don't really think so. Honestly, I felt like we made the best impressions, I would-- I think. I felt like I was too honest. No, I'm afraid that I told him that all of my exes have been, like, below five-eleven. Oh, so you think he's worried that... I think maybe a little, I don't know. I need to do some damage control because I gave Robert the impression that I wouldn't be attracted to someone like him. I'm not going to let tomorrow go by and not have that opportunity to talk to him. Oh, all the beds are so tiny. Well, I feel sorry for the tall guys who have to sleep in a twin bed. Yeah, no. Well, oh, barely. So we all start to, like, move around the house, right? We're all checking it out, finding our place, and I'm like, oh, my God, I have to be in a room with four other guys and share a bathroom? I mean, the last time I was in a room with another person was when I was a kid with my brother. What's your name again? Robby. Okay. What's yours, Mary? Um, are you always over the top like this? Or is this just who you are? It's just who I am. Okay, I didn't know, 'cause I don't know who the hell you are. Well, no, no, no, this is just me, me in the flesh, but honestly, it's-- What you see is what you get. You can't make this shit up, this is like, real life. It's real life. Oh, you can make it up easily. No, but he's not doing it. Well, how do you know? You're gonna see. You're gonna see. What the hell is going on? Who is this kid coming into this place with all this energy and calling me darling and I love you and you are fabulous. You don't know any of us. You just walked in the house and-- You know, it just didn't seem authentic to me, so I called him out. We have a Virgo on our hands, darling. Don't get me started on the Virgo-- You speak like a Virgo. You're a Virgo to the Nth degree. What is a Virgo to you? Grounded, conservative, beige. I'm not conservative. I'm not beige. Oh, you came in with a pinstriped suit, Mary. "Why are you so fabulous?" "Why are you acting like this?" I didn't call you fabulous. Oh, well, pardon me, then. I didn't call you fabulous. Fix your dress. Oh, my God, okay. Do you believe this? There's- - It's enough. Do you believe this? Like, I think you're going too far, seriously. I mean, point taken. I'm going too far? He's calling me conservative. He didn't say fix your dress, though, like... Calling my shit out, my fucking suit. Conservative, fix your dress, like that's, like... I liked your suit. You guys, let's just... Tone it down. Yeah, I feel like we need to tone it down a notch. I'm here to get to know Robert. Why would you even engage in something so petty? Why would you waste your energy and time over something that is so insignificant? best friend more than ever, and you cut me out because I was honest with you! And you were never, ever honest with me. You made fun of my mom's death, Brooke. You knew her. You cried with me when she died. And now you use her as a punch line for a joke to hurt me. It hurt. It did. Not anymore, 'cause you and me -- we're done. You were right. She's dead. As far as I'm concerned, so are you. - Hi. - Hi. Can we just put this whole thing behind us and have a good time at prom? I'm not going. Why? Did something else happen? No, I just don't care about prom. Peyton, we don't have to see Brooke. It will be fun. I promise you that. It's not about Brooke. I just really don't want to go anymore. You can still go if you want. Look, I... I think you're gonna regret not going. I know I'll regret not going with you. I just can't. I'm sorry. Well, I really hope you change your mind, because I'm coming back later, and I'm picking you up. And if you open that door, I know you're gonna look beautiful. And then we're gonna have a great night. And if not, I guess I'm going alone. Here's the list. But it's not the list of every girl I've ever been with. Then what is it? It's the list of every girl I've ever been in love with, and your name's the only one on it. It's the only one that matters. Nathan... That other list would have just been garbage from a person I'm not proud of. That's really sweet. But... But you want the other list. I thought you might. Wow, you're actually leaving. I guess I should be packing, too. Why? I didn't invite you. No, because this is your house. This is your house, isn't it? You didn't, like, marry and kill some old guy and bury him in the basement? I wish. My parents won't be back for a while, so you have some time. I feel really guilty you got expelled for something I did. Please. I practically forced you to cheat. Besides, for me, getting expelled equals getting tan. You had more to lose with your Clothes Over Bros deal. Thank you, Rachel. I don't know why you did it, but thank you. I did it 'cause you're my friend. Now, do something for me and make things right with Peyton. Yeah, but she said I was dead to her. Do you blame her? You're wrong, and you know it. - You slept with her boyfriend... - They were broken up! ...who, broken up or not, is off limits. But then you wouldn't forgive her for doing the same thing to you. Well, fine. If that's not the skank calling the whore a slut. You hit on Nathan knowing he was married. I know. But I suck. You're better than that. Work it out. It's no fun being the girl with no friends. It's no fun being the girl without a boyfriend, either. No kidding. What's with the Clean Teens, anyway? I mean, first Shelly dumps Mouth, then Chase dumps you. They should have a new slogan -- "We break hearts, not hymens." Shelly broke up with Mouth? I saw him this morning. He didn't say anything. He probably didn't want to pile onto your problems the way Peyton piled onto your face. But he's pretty broken up about it. That's my limo. Thanks for being my friend. You cheating whore. Thanks for being my friend, you crazy bitch. Sorry I got you expelled... again. It's okay. I'm used to it. Rachel... Okay, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna miss you. Yeah. You too. I think you should wear this one. Listen, I'm sorry I got weirded out earlier. That's okay. When he asked me, that was my initial reaction, too. And my second and my third. So, why did you agree to go? I don't know. I thought it would be fun. I just -- I just don't want to see you get hurt. But if going to prom with... Dan is gonna make you happy, then you should go. You know, there was a small part of me that was hoping you'd tell me not to go. I still could. I'll be fine. Okay. But no slow dances, okay? Did you name him "Nathan"? Why? Did he screw my best friend? I'm sorry, okay? And I know I'm late. I should have been here two years ago. - Well, why weren't you? ! - Because I was a jerk. Why Brooke? Did you really hate me that much? No, I didn't hate you. I just didn't care about anybody but myself. Look, I hooked up with Brooke because she was drunk and I was a bastard. It didn't mean anything. It was just a mistake we both wanted to forget. That explains why you taped it. Did I mention I was a stupid jerk? - Look, when you get to prom -- - I'm not going. Hey, I know you're mad at me and Brooke, but don't take this out on Lucas. I'm not. I just don't care. I'm you two years ago. No, you're not. You never were. Why do you think you stayed with me when I treated you so bad? I'm a masochist. Because you cared. That's who you are. You care about Lucas because you know he loves you, and you probably still care about me and Brooke because you know we love you, too. Just face it, Peyton. You care. So get dressed and go with Lucas. I'll see you there. It looks like you made the right call, Mouth. I guess so. But I always thought I would lose my virginity to my prom date, not my prom date to my virginity. But at least I have my friends, right? Will you go to prom with me, Marvin McFadden? What about Chase? Man, don't ask about Chase, fool. Clean Teen isn't really for me. Of course I'll go with you. It looks like we'll be a not-so-clean couple. See, Mouth, being a friend sometimes pays off. Who says we're going as friends? Just go with it. See you guys there. What's he got that I don't? A date. Haley? - Hi. - Hi. I just wanted to thank you for agreeing to move in. That means a lot to me. Yeah, sure. I mean, you know, you're family, Deb. If you want to get better, we are here to help. I also wanted to tell you that... whatever stupid thing Nathan might have done, I'm possibly to blame for it. Trust me, this one is all Nathan. His only role models growing up were a spineless, alcoholic mother and a controlling, sociopathic father. That doesn't excuse everything that he does, though. No, of course not. But he's become a wonderful man. And it's all because of you. And I want to thank you for that and ask you to forgive his shortcomings. Whatever grace he has, he learned from you. Maybe you can return it. Have fun tonight. My mother will be out in a second. I know this is tough for you, Lucas, but you can trust me. I trust her. - Wow, you look beautiful. - You look great. Well, thank you, both of you. Uh, you're not ready yet. Oh, well, only old people go to prom early, mom. Well, save your mom a dance, would you? Sure, 'cause every kid wants to dance with his mom at prom. You're not every kid. You're my kid. Have a good time at prom, mom. Dad. Thank God. You look amazing. Thanks. Notice anything different? You're smiling. Anything else? Your -- your boot's off. Haley, that's great. You can walk on it? Yep. Even better, I'm gonna dance on it. I was gonna tell you last night, but your surprise kind of trumped mine. Sorry... again. I know. And the list? Uh, the list -- I just read the one written by the man I fell in love with. I didn't need the one written by that other boy. Do you know how much I love you? You better. - We're gonna be late for prom. - Oh, please, there's nothing wrong with being a little late, is there? Oh, hey, does this dress make my butt look big? Oh, yeah. Thanks, baby. Don't walk with me, dude. People are gonna think we're together. Please, you could never get with Fergalicious. Did you just say...? Yeah. It was really awful. Peyton looked through me like I didn't even exist. I mean, can't she hate me? At least if she hates me, she still cares. You guys have been friends longer than me and Luke. I mean, that's too long not to care. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm always venting to you, Mouth. Do you want to talk about Shelly? Not at all. No. Okay. If you do, I'm here. Thanks again for being my date. You've always been there for me. Even now, when everyone thinks that I'm a whore. Nobody thinks that. Oh, my God. You might want to step out of the black light. She cares. She cares! Oh, you two look so cute. Wait there while I get the video camera. Sorry. Are you okay with this? I so broke that camera. Lucas -- Hi, Peyton. Praise the Lord! Amen... Dear brothers and sisters, we have gathered here on this beautiful day to make the holy and, inseparable union of marriage between the beloved children of God... - I'm afraid we've been too hasty. - You're Kornel's best mate! And you say it was too fucking hasty? ! Don't think you can make me feel guilty with this silence! It always ends like this when someone shows you some heart! You'll never learn! When there's a problem, one has talk about it, one has to... What about Kornel? No idea, too crowded, everybody were jumping over each other. I wouldn't have you in my brigade if a war broke out. - I've got an E. - You've got what? E. "Permanently unfitted for military", so even if it broke out... Why are you lying down like this? Want to catch a cold? Get up! You want me to beg, right? Lie down, do what you want. I couldn't care less. Just don't think I'll beg. I don't give a shit about you. Starring Screenwriter Sound Music Songs Art Director Costume Designer Editing Special Effects Director of Photography Production Manager Producer Directors - Why so early? You said 3 p.m. - Get lost! We usually have this stuff at the end of a party. How many times do I have to tell you? Are you retarded? ! What a beautiful place. You want to swap? - Let me introduce myself, Stavros. - Fistach. Thanks for you help, Fistach. I wouldn't make it alone. Who would say such a mutt would hold out so long? Half day of polishing and they're tarnished again. Sir, this is a big misunderstanding... Shut up! You're lucky they didn't break. Do you know how much they've cost? Very stylish shoes. Greek, but they look Italian, don't they? - I'm telling you it's a mistake... - Shut up! - Where's Jedrus? - You should knock. I could, but someone better looking. - Pig! - Beatka we have a problem. They're here and they are not in a swinging mood. Could you kindly tell me where is the cook? Where could he be? In the kitchen, right? It's so beautiful here. Yeah, beautiful! What is it? ! - He sworn to me he quit. - You believe cooks? A waiter? You have to hide him. If they find him they'll throw us all in the pots. He's not picking up! - Mr. Kornel seems to have fallen down. - Maybe someone hit him? I think. Yes, with a giant candle, you know, how do they call them? - Paschal candle. - You were to shut the fuck up! Then I lost sight of him, because everyone was jumping over each other, - then a baldish guy took him out... - Janis, my blood. We're done with it. Now get to the pots. What? Someone has to make the food for them, right? Are you crazy? I'm a waitress, not a cook. I have no idea how to cook! Old Maciochowa? She's a lady cleaning. But she's old! Women were much better educated in her times. I'm sure she cooks! - What are you doing? - He's bleeding. Bleeding, bleeding, This isn't any war! Exactly... Exactly! This is a rat, not a prisoner of war! He doesn't deserve anything. Maybe some poison. Speaking of poison, how about we slugged a shottie? Sir, don't waste your life on shotties. If one slugs, it should be a whole glass. Young man, your philosophy is so close to mine! The "permanently unfit" will have a shot as well? - I prefer wine. - Wine, wine. It isn't a party for faggots! Waiter! Where is that fucker? Waiter! Chateaubriand. No? Then maybe stroganoff? At least chicken one? Just do what you can, Mrs. Stenia. I know potato liver sausage. Waiter! Proceed with questions. Waiter! And chitterlings? Yes! Start working, or we won't like each other. - How can I serve you? - Loyally. We'd like a drink for a start. Excuse me, which way to the gentleman's room? Through the courtyard, door to the left, then downstairs, then right, then right, then right... He got stuck... No, it's three times right. Then upstairs, second door to the left, No, the third door, the second is the ladies room... What is that? A way to a loo or the wolves' den? No, it's just that today the restaurant's toilet... - just today it overflowed... - I'm afraid to get lost. Take a taxi! - I'll show you. - You get to vodka! You've got a cellphone, call if you need help. Glasses, like a man! Waiting is a despicable job, right? Got to be a fag to enjoy it. Attentiooooon! Have you known Kornel for a long time? I don't know him at all. I'm from Alicja. Bitch! But you're OK, Fistach. Why only two? - Because there are two of you. - Are you blind? What about the rat? Is he a dog? ! I might be strict, but I'm not a monster. - I don't want any vodka. - Who asked you what you want? ! There comes a moment in every man's life, - that his son gets married... - What if he has a daughter? Sorry. In such moments he drinks a toast to the beauty of his daughter-in-law. But life does not always have these soap opera moments. So the only thing we can say today is: Gentlemen, may all the treacherous bitches rot in hell! Finally, she came along. - You've got hematuria? - Worse... - There was paint in the tap! - Jesus, you've mixed up the rooms. I followed your instruction. You got to the storage room. Our boss's brother is a performance artist. He keeps his installations there. You must have turned on the "Lady Macbeth's Tap"! The work... "Lady Macbeth's Tap" Deconstructs romantic patterns, letting us in the dead lake of banal and into stinking, but refreshing mumble of anxieties. No, I walked according to the plan, third door on the left... Right! I said right! Did I say left? Moron! I said he was a moron... - Please, do not call me like that! - How should I call you? Your Holiness? Don't call me anything. I'm having a bad day today. Bad day! Your mother had a bad day when she met your father, who climbed down from a tree especially for that occasion. I don't know. I never got to know my father. Then buy a ticket to the zoo, you'll recognize each other. One more word and I'll fix your face. No kidding. There! Finally some human reflexes! - He really isn't joking. - Shut up, rat! You shut up. You, listen, you... I told you he wasn't joking. Quarrel is the most common cause of murders all over the world. I would not underestimate that. Sebastian Tretyn... Tytus... Most often murder isn't a one-sided attack on a completely unaware victim, it's more of a dynamic interaction between a victim, an attacker and a witnesses of the event, that is us. I don't want to kill him. Right, you don't. But you will. What? What for? ! What do you mean: what for? To save your reputation, your face, which has been tarnished by the victim's crude remarks about your honorable parents, in the painful presence, of the witnesses. Well thought, mate, Fistach. Sebastian Tretyn, pleasure. Miskiewicz, Master degree, you can call me Bug. Tretyn. A pleasure. What the fuck? ! If there is anybody in this restaurant who has a right to murder because of lost face, then it's only my son! And I represent him while he is absent! There is no worse crime! Just for stealing a horse, one was to pay with his head, not to mention... Which one of you is Mr. Stavros? Kornel, my little son. How is he? Happy now? ! What is going to happen, Janis? Nothing, I guess. He just fainted. They wanted to take him for observation but he insisted on staying here. Fortunately, they brought a man pulled from under a tram. Everybody were screaming "Where's the leg?" So we could... Can I have a drink? You, listen... Pardon sir, my son is thirsty. What would you like to drink? I am drinking. Thanks. - Where's the bathroom! - Pardon me? Where is the bathroom? ! Through the door, to the left, then downstairs, then right, then right, then right, then upstairs... No good. A blow to the head, especially in the occipital part can cause dangerous hematomas. Daddy, what is he doing here? Although, as you gentlemen probably know, the paschal candle is formed out of soft material, wax, but it still has its weight. And I don't mean the weight of its meaning, as you surely understand. Kornel! Kornel! Kornel! Attentiooooon! Excuse me. She's mine! You get it? ! Mine! Of course she's yours! I don't challenge that! - I'll castrate you, you bum! - You're getting carried away - quite unnecessarily! - I'll cut off your balls! Yes, you've mentioned that already! Your prick! I'll tear off your prick, you prick! You're repeating yourself, son! Daddy... Yes, son? I feel weak. Kornel, my dear, be a man. Pepper mint, freshly brewed, - I'm sure it will work. - You made it nicely cool? Thank you, Mr. Tytus. - Frail constitution. - Sensitive, after me. Honey? Honey, do it again for your nutty little frog. Kornel! It's Dad. Dad is talking to you. Honey? Kornel! Father! Ladies and Gentlemen! The higher the testosterone level in the cock's blood, the bigger... silence, please, his comb and wattle. However the testosterone level also affects his susceptibility to parasites. What's more: the negative influence of steroid hormones on the immunological system causes men... Mr. Kornel? ...to be much more susceptible to infections and illnesses than women. And, Ladies and Gentlemen, castrates for example, live much longer than men. Because castrates are the best example here... Why this castration thing again? Is it some kind of a hobby? - It's so screwed up! - Kornel is a lecturer at our university's biology department, but he specializes in willies. Like all of us, from time to time... Kornel is an outstanding ornithologist! - My blood... - I have the pleasure of working - with him, sir. - On willies as well? - No, I'm in parasites. - Screwed up, huh? Mr. Kornel? Mr. Kornel, do you recognize me? I do. It's OK now. OK? The fuck OK! Alicja, what are you doing here with him again? No, no, Kornel, wait! I am not your Alicja. I am Bug. B-U-G...! - Bug... - He recognized me... You're screwing my wife too. - Bug, you Brute! - You're kidding Kornel. You're all screwing her, right? All of you! You drooling, lusting dolphins! Stop it son! You're among friends! Friends? Germans are banging my wife! Why is he talking about dolphins? Male dolphins work in groups. They surround the female, force her to separate from the herd, then copulate with her one after another. Just like the bosses in my agency. - Advertising agency. - My Wife! Wife! This isn't your wife. Stop behaving like an idiot. Get up! Which wife is not? In the legislative and sacramental sense no obligation has been made, because Alicja didn't say "I do". It means the act of matrimony did not take place at all. And there was red paint in the tap! Maybe yours didn't take place, you Greek impotent! - Brother, really... - I'm not your brother! How is he not your brother? He's your brother like I am your father! - You're not my father! - How am I not your father? You're not my father! You're fired! Jesus, this is so screwed up! Sure it's screwed up! Better help, then talk bullshit! - Are you sure? You impressed me with those dolphins. Clever little fish! No, no, Mr. Tytus, they're mammals. Yeah, right, mammals, mammals... More! More! There's no more sugar. Maybe a cookie? - Let's put him on the drip again! - Are you crazy Dad? I think I'm better. Gentlemen, I suggest we sit down. Excuse me, could you fill up the glasses? Sorry for that, was it too hard? No, not at all... - Fistach! - Was OK, very professional. Gentlemen, and you too, I clearly owe you an apology. From what you are telling me, I got slightly carried away. Son, don't worry! It's a man's thing to burst out occasionally. Dad, a human being is no beast. He should be able to control himself. The only excuse I have, is my state of great agitation. My wedding today, especially it's finale, quite unusual finale, caused me extreme stress. This was the reason for the sudden loss of sugar in my blood, that caused hallucinations during which, I'm afraid, I offended some of you. No, no, it's OK. No, no, gentlemen, my fault is unquestionable here. This is my wedding, you are my guests, so I suggest we raise a toast. There you go, to my guests' health! Cheers! Mr. Kornel, gentlemen, I feel the moment has come for me to speak. Because what I went through today... I understand everything, emotions too, but I still want to express my amazement that it's me whom you, gentlemen, blame even though I am clearly a victim here. The victim of an inexplicable misunderstanding. Didn't Alicja told the priest she couldn't marry Kornel, because she loved you? - Bitch! - Dad, you're talking about my wife! She is not your wife. Neither legislatively nor sacramentally. - OK, OK! But she didn't say it was me, she loved! Sure she did! The priest asked "Do you want to marry Kornel?", and that bitch, - Dad, I asked you! - OK, Alicja! She said "no", - that only you. - Pointed her finger at you. - Walked up to you. - And started kissing you! Right, I'm sorry, really sorry. Stress flashback apparently. Is there any sugar left? Gentlemen don't talk about facts. Although she did start to kiss me passionately, pushing her tongue - down to my tonsils. - Objection! You could spare us the details! My brother... - It's OK, I'm eating sugar. - My tonsils have been cut out. I was no less surprised than you were, gentlemen, but I insist that Miss Alicja did not speak about myself, and I have a proof! You recorded the wedding? Yes! I'm a journalist. Well, actually I'm not, but I was at Mr. Kornel's and Miss Alicja's wedding in business, sent by the editorial team of Biba. Kornel: I love her gigantic IQ. Alicja: Our home will be the Palace of Culture Science. A new great love of a well known singer! He is Mr. Scientist... That bitch! Forgive me, son. So, let's listen to these Tapes of Truth of yours. Nah, it's all gabble. Your basses were distorted. I don't know how to use it, it's my wife's. You've got a wife? Yes, five years now. What? I don't believe you. And a daughter! Here, my Zuzia. Zuzanna Czeslawa. Czeslawa after my wife's mother. Ah, what a nipper, and these cheeks she has. - How old? - Two and a half. That was good, only be careful, there's water behind you. I have a son, Piotrus, three months and seven days. My blood...! Big girl. Still breastfeeding, or bottle? It varies, you know, a bit of this and a bit of that. Gentlemen, this is all screwed up. Is this the Wigry Lake? Mamry, Mamry Lake. Speaking of bottles, how if I pour something? Ah, words of wisdom, Mr. Tytus! Words of wisdom! There you go! Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, My hands are growing numb! Gratie, gratie, guests will come hungry! No one will come, they're already here! Big lads, they'll eat well. Gratie, gratie! Long live the groom! The groom! Thank you, gentlemen! Gentlemen, let's eat, let's enjoy ourselves, there you go. I'm just wondering, Mr. Sebastian, because you're telling you have a wife, a child, you look like a happy man, - and you kiss my brother's wife. - She's not my wife! And let's stick to the facts: she kissed me, not the other way! Bitch! Gentlemen, let's finally make clear what actually happened. Let one person take the recorder, hear it through and tell us what happened. Otherwise it's all screwed up! OK. Oh, no, I have to protest, you are a bias side in this argument! Let it be someone who... Me? No, no, absolutely not... Very unclear. Concentrate! The priest says: "Kornel, do you want Alicja to be..." Move on! Move on! - Mr. Kornel says "yes"... - I know what I said, move on! - The priest says: "Alicja..." - Move on! Oh, there it is, Miss Alicja says: It would be dishonest to God to marry a man one does not love. Wait, there is more: The most important thing... is to be loyal to love. What a bitch! Don't interrupt! What is most important? The most important thing is to be loyal to love. My tart... What tart? I have to listen again, very scrambled, you know... Got it! It's not my tart but... My heart belongs to someone else. My heart belongs to someone else. You think it's funny? You think it's funny, Mister? No, not at all, I'm just happy I could hear it. - OK, OK. - It's buzzing terribly, - you know, all this bass. - Fucking slut. You heard it, gentlemen, she said "someone else"! She didn't say "my heart belongs to Sebastian Tretyn"! That's no proof! - What do you mean: no proof? - No proof. Father is right this time. Not mentioning your name, doesn't mean it wasn't about you. Every lawyer will tell you that. - What lawyer? Janis for instance. Janis is a lawyer. Dad, I've asked you: Janusz. My name is Janusz! But I've named you Janis. But when you had to register me, my mother couldn't find you for a week. I was celebrating your birth. She had to go alone, pissed as hell. That's why I'm Janusz! You'll always be Janis to me! Like your grandfather and my father! Whatever. - Your line of defense has been refuted. - It hasn't, gentlemen. What will we do with it now? - We'll stuff the intestines. - What intestines? - Pork intestines. - We don't have intestines. I mean pork intestines. Don't you worry, pumpkin, Stenia will always come up with something. It might cheer you up to know, you're not the only one she made an ass off. Mr. Tretyn is another one, and myself too. - You? - Yes. - You are also involved with this... - Of course. For several years. - Let me pour something. - Not now! It looks like out of the seven of us, I was the only one not banging her! Do you expect flowers for that? ! Don't you know other relationships between a man and woman but sexual ones? - Are there any other? ! - There are: mother and son, grandmother and grandson, me and my ex-girlfriend, although that's not a good example, because I did want her. Great examples: mother and son. What about Oedipus? That's Greece, they're all completely fucked up there. You fuck off from Greece! I'm Greek and I won't let you insult me! What can some lousy waiter know about our sophisticated culture? ! Where is the damn vodka? ! - Did you tell not to pour? ! - But now I'm telling to pour! We're listening, Mr. Fistach. My son will gladly learn about the nature of your relation with his wife. But she's not his wife! At least that's what I understood. Gentlemen, as you might know, I am a guitar player. I started with hard core thrash in Defloration, than reggae with the Weed, jazz with Karolak, than St. Francis's Dogs and two records with them. - Your first CD was awesome! - Thank you. And the third track... Though I'm like a magnet, nothing makes me glad! Chicks are going crazy, I'm still kind of sad! Grave, grave, grave, grave, grave... - Grave! Fucking great piece! - Thank you. Hey, what is this? "Pop Idol Show"? - You were to talk about Alicja! - That's where I'm heading, gentlemen. Then I started playing with Alicja. Alicja And The Sperm we were called. - We were the sperm. - Alicja And The Sperm. - Where did you get her from? - Television. There's no denying, after the break you'll be watching a controversial show, Kuba Wojewodzki's show, which is my show. A fresh, young and supple talent has spurt out on the Polish scene recently: Alicja and her Sperm. What kind of love do you believe in Alicja? I believe in love from the first fuck. Break! And gentlemen, thank you, Mr. Tytus, we recorded an album, the record company peed in their pants, for the stuff was so shit-hot, but it didn't matter, since the target group wouldn't buy it. Why, if you said the material was shit-hot? - 'Cause there was no event. - What? - No media feeding frenzy. - You know, like a scandal. Exactly. It's not enough to record a couple of good tracks any more. You need an engine which will pull it all. Something to gain attention. An event! You're joking, right? I'm afraid not. Gentlemen, I didn't meddle in those affairs because I am an artist. All I'm interested in is music. I don't give a fuck if it sells or not. But Alicja was as lusty for fame as an Arab during flying lessons. Fistach, you'll see, I'll think of something. I surely will. And she did. It was Mr. Kornel. What did such a bitch need a common ornithologist for? ! Eh, not that common. Few months ago Mr. Kornel was the most popular ornithologist in the country! By mistake... As far as I know, you met Alicja in Wojewodzki's show. You don't get invited there by mistake. We just talked with Alicja about love at first fuck and that brings birds to mind. Speaking of birds we think the first ornithologist of the Fourth Republic. Ladies and gentlemen: Kornel Olecki! What a rocking guy, wow! Good evening. Kornel, I'd like you to meet Alicja. - Kornel Olecki. - Alicja. Gimme five, yo. Hi, good evening. Kornel, tell me, do you have a favorite bird? Yes, this one and only... And that's why I like you! The first Pope of Polish ornithology! Olecki! Thanks for coming to my controversial show! Watch me next week! I'll never believe that. She is not like that. Why she is not here than? Excuse me. No, no gentlemen, I just need a... Oh, that's through the courtyard, door to the left, then downstairs... I know! Right, right. Gentlemen, pardon me, if you allow me, I think you should explain everything step after step, otherwise we will be stocked in those circles. What a genius advice. And what exactly do you suggest? Maybe Mr. Kornel should start with telling us how he met Miss Alicja? Nah, forget it! It's not a bad idea, son! Step by step we'll tear that bitch to pieces. I got a scholarship. But come here, here! Could you? A chair. I got a scholarship in Australia: "breeding habits of ostriches". - Polack! - Yes, Polska! I have no idea who the attackers were. Probably Germans. I woke up on a beach. No suitcase, no passport, no money. I didn't feel like watching those fucking ostriches anymore. So I went to the embassy. There was an awful crowd, bodyguards, the Polish Prime Minister - had just come to visit. - What Prime Minister? - What Prime Minister could it be? - Oh, that one, right. So I thought: "this is my only chance, at worst they'll shoot me". So I went straight up to him, said what happened, who did what, he said no, he was busy with some high-ranking meetings, but in the evening he sent a bodyguard who said I could go back with them on a government plane. Be a bit more concise, son, or we'll... I am concise Dad, but it is all important! On the plane the Prime Minister joins me and asks what is going on. So I tell him about my plan to get PhD, about the scholarship, the ostriches. I only skipped the fact that I had just landed. And he tells me he's tired, that the talks in Australia came to fucking nothing and that he has no idea what to tell those journalist hyenas at the airport. You know, the usual small talk on the road. Kornel, I beg you, get to the point. We get off at the airport, the journalists jump and start: "Mr. Prime Minister, how was the visit? Was it a breakthrough?" And he says he's proud of the accomplishments of Polish science, which is doing swell in the foreign lands, and he pulls me in front of those microphones. - Fucker wise ass! - I couldn't drive them away, one interview after another, finally that talk show. And you say he's a common ornithologist! That's precisely what Alicja needed, gentlemen: a popular intellectual and a pop starlet. The event has started! I warned you not to go for those pictures, remember? Alicja wanted them so much. That's an event, Mr. Kornel. E-V-E-N-T. Bullshit not event! What about love? The notion you apparently have no knowledge about. What love? What did she say in the church? The most important thing is to be loyal to love. Exactly. And then... My heart belongs to someone else. I'm sorry, Kornel. OK, she doesn't love me, but she loves someone else and that's love too! I'm afraid it's much worse. Alicja And The Sperm. My heart belongs to someone else Everything Alicja said in the church were lyrics from our newest album. I'm sorry. Could that bitch? ! I'm afraid she could. Tomorrow's newspapers will write about today's scandal quoting Alicja's words, the album hits the stores in three days. That's how you create success these days, gentlemen. Are you angry? No, it's OK. Yummy! This liver sausage is excellent! I'll tell the chef, he will be pleased. - I had to take it out on someone. - But it's OK, don't worry. Mine! Hi, honey. I just wanted to call you. No, no it's OK. We're having fun. How's the baby? A poo! Great! Why you saying it's quiet? It's not! More vodka Mr. Tytus! The band is eating. Eating, I'm saying...! I'm drinking! Mister Fistach, I'm begging you. What pictures? The wedding ones? Yes, of course, perfect, came out great, especially Kornel. Gentlemen, let's go! Oh, they're starting to play. Honey, I have to go, the dance is starting, bye. Done! Why done? - Done with talking. - But we were doing so well, son. We didn't come here to dance. Why not? It's a wedding. That's right! Come on! Fuck, stop! A friend of mine from Fabryczna street, you know Fabryczna street? Right. So her husband died and... she took a lover. And every time that lover was with her, her husband was banging the drawers in the wardrobe. Miss Stenia, they're telling me the liver sausage is delicious! All neighborhood knew when he was with her, for all that drawer banging. He kept an eye on what was his even after his death. My son is little too afraid of his wife, gentlemen. I'm not afraid... The poor thing is alone with the baby in a house, if I told her something happened, she'd worry. Worry? She'd be mad. Not mad, Kornel, not mad. She's just sensitive. Sensitive? ! Man, she's a madwoman! Last week she jumped out of the car, leaving him with the kid in the middle of a crossing! Just because he didn't tell her she had a hole in her stockings. They got almost battered down by a truck! I got my driving license two days ago, I will drive myself. And when she didn't let us in on your birthday? 'Cause she learned Konecka's husband earned more than you! A madwoman! - How if you pick on your own wife? - I don't have a wife. You said it yourself. They're all whores! Watch your tongue, waiter! My wife is no... Maybe your wife isn't, don't know her, haven't met her. I know the rest and they're all sluts! My wife isn't either. Apart from Mr. Janis's and Tretyn's wives...! - And my mother. - OK! Apart from our mothers and wives all women are whores! My aunt isn't too. She's a nun. You don't think gentlemen she could... Besides, she's really ugly. Let me fill up the glasses to blow off the steam... To our health, gentlemen! Orgasm after fifty. What a crap. Only orgasms count today. A man is not for orgasms but for paying the expenses. Unfortunately gentlemen, what Mr. Tytus, with brutal sharpness, typical of his intellectual condition called "whore", does indeed depicts reality. And although it is not easy for me since, as I have already mentioned, I love me wife, I trust her, I still must be fair to the facts. And the facts, as we so often see in various publications, show that the system of values shared by women is different from ours, and allows behavior which could easily fall within the definition of the term... "whore"... Well said. - Could you say it more clearly? - Say what if it's so clear? Male manner of perceiving women might be unsophisticated, but at least is honest. Every male perceives the female as a sexual object. Meaning he'd like to screw her, right? If you prefer that expression. Sure I prefer, gentlemen, when it takes me over sometimes, it's like I'm connected to an electrode. I once had an action with a waitress in Wroclaw. I'm from around Wroclaw, you know. The bitch wasn't pretty but she had these aerials, aerials like this! Excuse me, but I think Mr. Tretyn was just explaining something? Every male, like I said, perceives female as a sexual object and that makes the whole thing easier. It means that if we have a sexual relation, or as Mr. Tytus would say, we screw our chosen one... - Giving her the boner! - Exactly. It means that our only reason is the will to satisfy our sex drive. Ergo, we are honest with her femininity and with her humanity that fulfills itself through her physical features. In the meantime the reasons for women having sexual relations are inordinately more twisted. Examples? Did any of you ever have sex to improve your social or professional status? Precisely. Women however can do it with someone who doesn't attract them physically at all but has an appropriate status, who is rich, popular or has power. Are you saying they do it with us only for profit? Yeah, but in a devious way. It's a whole game with complicated rules. What's complicated about it? When I'm into some chick, I just approach her, look her straight in the eyes, you know, the very masculine way, I look and she knows, she feels, she is having butterflies down there, you know where? And I tell her in a low voice: come sweetie... I'll strip your moneybag so hard you won't have any coins left. And? She gives you a smack? Are you kidding? I get what I want. And they beg for more. That's right, gentlemen! That's the method! I've always used it too and it has always worked! Well done boy, keep up the good work! What do you mean you've always used it? You told my mother you would strip her moneybag? No, I didn't say that to your mother. Maybe to mine? Neither to yours! Boys, you've grown up enough to figure it out that your father has always been quite popular with ladies. Popular? I can't take this cynicism any more. Do you have any idea how much mother suffered because of you? All those nights you didn't come home. I was dying of fear something might have happened to you. I couldn't sleep hearing how she cried in the pillow. Let it go son, that's ancient history. God, I was so happy when she finally kicked your butt out. So many years of sacrificing herself for you, having practically no life, and finally... Janis! Janusz. My name is Janusz. Janusz, please, stop. And that's why I will never be like you. Even if my wife is a maniac. She can be nice sometimes. Really. You stepped in... Just mud. Tastes even better when cold. Sorry if I've misunderstood, but do you gentlemen have different mothers? Yes... As you've heard our Daddy was always very popular. Now you are getting on my back? Daddy used to travel a lot. Everywhere he went, he left a mark. When my mother figured out she was pregnant, she paid him a visit. As it turned out she wasn't the one and only dream he had. She told him she'd never wanted to see him again and she returned home. My mother, who got pregnant exactly the same time, forced him to marry her. A child needed his father. We were born the same day. So it's really screwed up, gentlemen. We are a rare type of twins with different mothers. I had an honor to met my father when I was eighteen years old. He simply appeared one day. Out of nowhere. I understood the importance of a family. So when I hear my father giving me advice, on how to connect with women, it sounds really pathetic now. You, dear Daddy, you have no idea how to talk to them. Look at him! And you do? Sure I do. Very interesting. Let's make a little experiment here. I'll be a woman, you'll be a m... you'll be yourself. Will see how you manage. Picture this, son: we wake up. We fucked all night like rabbits. You screwed me so hard, I screamed like I was on fire, even neighbors were banging on the walls. Now is the morning after, we're getting dressed. Anything wrong? No, it's just difficult for me to imagine... like rabbits, neighbors, and the fire... OK, OK, right, you didn't exactly inherit my temperament. - And I'm pleased! - Anyway! I'm sitting on the bed, you're almost done with your tie. Will be going apart for work in a moment. What do you say? Darling, are we still going to the movie today? - No. - Why not? - No! So let's do a theater, or a nice dinner somewhere? I don't want to see you again. This was the last time. That's nonsense! I want to breathe again. I need space, you suffocate me. I long for air. Why are you saying this? Have I hurt you? Hurry up or I'll be late for work. - Will you give me a lift? - It's PMS, right? Sure, sure, that's all you can understand. Typical male. - OK, I'm going alone, bye. - Wait! Wait, I love you. I really love you. Don't be so dramatic. - Be a man for once... - Be a man for once. Don't do this to me... After all we've been through... I'm so impressed honey, you know? Excellent show. Excellent show. I'm not pretending! I really love you! I don't want to lose you. Shit, I'm dirty like a pig. What is it? So will you give me a lift? - Or I have to suffer on the bus? - Or I have to suffer on the bus? Of course. I should have expected this from you. You can't even split with dignity. Only a few hours ago she said I was her whole world. What a bitches they are. Let's try it, let's try it at least once. Let's say something each of us already knows. Maybe everything will fall down, on this beautiful garden of lies. Let's say it, let's say it to each other. I know it isn't easy to tell a simple truth. Maybe not today, what a beautiful garden of lies. This, you know, this moneybag of yours you bring it up with them right away? On the street? No way on the street. First one has to relax a bit. I take her to see the movie, then some coffee... There! - And who pays for the cinema? - And for the café? I get a good screw in return! So does she. Free of charge. You are impossible to talk to! Don't be so dramatic. Be a man for once. Oh my God, oh my God, I loved her so much, I wanted to marry her, but she exited my life like it was some stinking loo. - Sugar! Give him sugar at once! - Not sugar, not sugar, vodka, vodka! No! Not vodka! Vodka is no good for you! That's what the doctors say. Some of them. A few that is... mine... I played in one more band... Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Halleluuuuuiah! Father. Father. Father. Halleluuuuiah! Yeah, I had this episode... community, prayer, Bible under my pillow, stuff like that. Back then I met a girl from Pila, from the Catholic Youth Movement. Gentlemen, I got so mad about her. You can't imagine how deeply one can fall in love after making the decision of no fucking. One becomes a walking zombie! Each muscle in your body goes into jackass raptures! Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Halleluuuuuiah! Nothing? Really? - Not even a little petting? - Nothing! It lasted a year and we spent almost every night together! Wait a second, you said she lived in Pila. Fuck! Gentlemen, when I think about it now, I don't believe it myself! We play a concert in Sanok, the concert ends, boys run to the hotel, but I'm jumping into the car! I'm fucking driving through the whole country to lie next to her at 5 a.m., back in the car again the same morning driving to Jaslo where we play. I had to buy three cars that year 'cause they all fell apart. It's a miracle I didn't get kill on the road, gentleman! And you didn't get a bit of snatch even once? Nothing! Just some kind of an innocent kiss-kiss. Gees... Well, that's really screwed up. Mr. Tytus, that was a real torture. Gentlemen, I am lying next to her, I feel that warmth, that smell, my dick is whirring like a Russian fan, and I do nothing! For "not until the wedding night" had to - mean "not until the wedding night!" - Impressive. And all the things I bought her! She would call me and say: Honey, I think I need a little pair of shoes. Or... I just saw this funny sweet dress in Cottonfield. And bang! Off to get the dress! Not to mention the stuff for her apartment, the furniture, the rugs, the vases and who the fuck knows what else! I prayed: Dear Lord! I don't want to live in this filthy Pila... Dear Lord. I don't want to live in this filthy Pila, but if this is what you have chosen for me, I will obey. So why don't you live there actually? Why? Why? We were playing a concert in Olsztyn. The concert ends, I jump into the car, back on the road, I call her on the way and she tells me: That's lovely, darling, I love you, do you know? So I step on it to go faster, to be with her even sooner, I enter the house, face smiling like a happy idiot, but I stumble over some suitcases. "Whose are these?" I ask surprised but still smiling, and she... - Yours. - Mine? What for? You're moving out. I thought I heard something wrong, so I say: "My little sunshine, stop kidding, you said you loved me just a moment ago" I lied. That's all? Yes. Just: "I lied". I left Pila half dead. I drove, pulled over, threw up, drove again, pulled over, threw up. Nightmare. In the morning, in Warsaw, a journalist from "Beauty" calls me and asks for an interview about the life of a converted rock man. - You refused? - No, I told her to come. She enters smelling with perfume, short dress, her tits squeezed into this bra, you know, one can see right away she's weak at her knees. They have these parted lips, like they wanted to say something, but they only lick them with their tongue. She enters, and she puts the recorder on, I tell her: "You want an interview? Kneel down!" Excuse me? I unzip my pants. "Take it!" I say. She says: "What is this?" "You have eyes. Just take it!" And I stood right before her. You must have been in real shock, she could have run you down in the press. Nah, she took it. And she came back several times. The things we did, gentlemen, yoga is a child's play compared to that. Thank you very much, Mr. Tytus. That is how my Christian rock story ends, gentlemen. I love this nail polish color, Miss Beatka. On your toes. Well, boys, didn't I give you a cool psychodrama? Forget it Daddy, after Mr. Fistach story we've just heard, yours comes up completely amateur. - What? - Yes, indeed, biology is familiar with such cases. It has been observed more than once that female chimpanzees sexually provoke males only to steal meat from them. Wait, Mr. Bug, monkeys are monkeys and humans are humans. Do you know that genetically speaking there is a closer kinship between us and chimpanzees than between the chimpanzees and gorillas? Might be in your case, certainly not in mine! No, you are the best example here! Haven't you been whacked in the face lately? I found out later that she was the easiest chick to bang in Pila. On my rugs. Mr. Tytus? Why can't you understand that the goal of all living creatures is to reproduce? Re-pro-duce! Yeah, yeah, you don't have to repeat yourself. You are also a subject to this law of nature. But I didn't want them at all! Thanks. Thanks, Daddy. Sorry guys, I just wanted to have some fun. You said she was from "Beauty"? my wife used to work there, she must know her, right? Sure, it's a small office. And I spent all my life thinking it is me who decides whom to take to bed. With whom - yes. But why you do it, is determined by something very different. - By that cunt... - By testosterone... Testo... what? Testosterone, Daddy. A male hormone. It forces us to run after women from adolescence till death. It makes us potential murderers and rapists at all times. You too? I try to abstain, but it's like all of us... I hope. "Lovely lad, my lad so young, quietly hums the maid. Why by the ghostly water's bank you walk so late in the moon's light?" Testosterone, gentlemen, determines aggressiveness to such extent, that among birds with inverted sexual roles, females have more of it in their blood. I don't understand. Inverted roles? Males give birth? No! Australian cassowaries for instance, that I once had a chance to study, Cassowaries are a great example here... Female cassowaries are the aggressive sex. They're at least one meter tall, their claws are seven centimeters long, they can even rip a dingo to pieces, and they fight all the time, Daddy. They kick each other like crazy. What for? The winning female copulates with every male she can find. Then she leaves all of them with her eggs to hatch. - All screwed up. - All screwed up. Gentlemen, let's thank the good Lord for not making us cassowaries! And that our females don't have that testosterone thing. Well, you can't really tell, you know. What "I know", "you can't really tell"? According to research, women with a higher testosterone level have sexual intercourse more often. They are less prone to depression, they have more pleasure during sex. - Where can you find such a wonder? - Yes! Go to your kennel! To the kennel! To the kennel! Our aggression is caused by the mere existence of women! - True, the primate males... - Pardon me, please. So even us, Daddy, we are aggressive by nature, because that's what the females like, and it lets us beat up other males in fights over females. The conclusion is simple: if there were no women, men wouldn't kill each other. You've exaggerated a bit. Guys will always find a reason for a brawl. No. Yes! No! Yes! NO! Dad! Imagine there were no women on Earth. What reason would you have to kill me? See my point? I could take your mobile! - I don't have a mobile phone any more. - I could call some fancy chicks. There are no chicks! We agreed. So I would call Mr. Fistach! - And what would you talk about? - What do you mean? About chicks! - About football, for instance. - Yeah! We'd talk about football. - There would be no football. - How come? Who do the footballers play for? For the fans! You believe this? - For fame. - For money. What do they need fame and money for? To buy cool and fast cars! And what do they need those cool, fast cars for? ! To... To pick up chicks! The vicious circle is completed. That's totally screwed up! Vicious bitches, aren't they? They forced us to invent football, but when you want to watch the Champions League, they switch to "Dynasty". Wonderful world, eh? Yeah! - Mr. Fistach? - Just Fistach. Fistach, what was the name of that journalist? My wife must know her, it will crack her up when I tell her. Luiza Ostrowska. You know, they bawl us all the time for bad behavior, even though we have no influence since we are controlled by some fucking hormone. Even though when they get some more of that... eeeeeh, testosterone, they act just like us. Two-faced bitches, aren't they? Are you sleeping? No, I'm thinking. Do you remember doctor Slaska? Do I remember? Man, the best body of faculty in the history of this department. - We were together, you know. - You? Excuse me. Don't worry, It's hard for me to believe it either. I don't know why she chose me. She could have had anyone. Gees, Bug, wow! Why didn't you tell me sooner? I adored her. We could talk about cephalopods in bed for hours! Until one day she says for breakfast: Listen, we can't be together anymore. I thought it was a movie, so I answered: OK, if that's what you want... You did the right thing. "No" means "no", don't need no favors! Only in the evening, I felt something terrible rising up inside of me and I had to leave. You beat the bitch? - I bought a bottle and went downtown. - A firm decision, congratulations. Yeah, but I also bought a whole lot of tranquilizers. Bull! I swallowed all of them, I drank as much as I could, though I never could drink too much because of the usual obligatory puke so I thrown out the battle and I called her. I will live with you, or I won't live at all! She told me to stay at the phone booth, and she would be there in a second. Did she show up? I don't know, I left. - What happened next? - What could happen? I got diarrhea next, I shitted under a bush until someone called the police, so I had to run. I woke up in the morning under some gate, my jacket was smeared with lime, probably from bumping into some plaster, "Fuck, I could have died looking like shit!" I thought to myself. Forget it, Mr. Bug, one chick doesn't make a summer. It's easy for you to say that. You have such an easy way with women. Yeah, I do, I do, only now I will pay for this ease. You're just sitting here? We're sitting, Daddy. And where's our Tyson? He run home to kill his wife. And Mr. Janis followed to stop the crime. Seen that son? Such a blockhead, and what a speed-up. Like that gorilla! Yes. Like a gorilla, Daddy. Go to sleep. I spotted a nice chick a while ago here. She used to come to the restaurant with some friends and I wanted to immediately jab her on my pike, but the time wasn't right since she was just splitting with her guy. Really? And I thought there is no better time for adultery like a relationship crisis. No way! It's the worst. The worst! That's when they only want to cuddle not fuck. But they finally made up, so we started seeing each other right after. And now I have a problem Bad conscience? Something else is bad. She called this morning that her period was late. That doesn't mean anything. Just biology of the cycle. But it's fifty-five days late. You have a problem. Maybe it's the other guy's child? There is no other guy anymore. He threw her ass out the door the moment he found out about us. Well, gentlemen, to a new God's creature! Mr. Tytus, could you teach me some of your phrases? What phrases? You know, the ones that make every pussy yours. I'm not too good at those. OK, OK, come closer. - So you're just sitting here? - I am sitting, Daddy. And our poor Fistachio? He's washing the blood off his jacket. Go to sleep, Daddy, go to sleep. I'll be a chick and you... you'll try to convince me to jump into bed with you. Hello, Miskiewicz here, Master degree. But she knows you! She's just waiting for the sign! She's only waiting for the sign that... So how are you getting to it? You know... Well. You know... - You know... - Of coming. Really? . Wow. So...

Trust? Yes. There is no such thing. Nothing. No-one is trustworthy. I very much disagree. Oh, I have lived, and let me tell you it is not possible to know another human being fully. Especially a man. There is no such thing as certainty. To throw one's lot in with a man is...necessarily to risk. Ah, well... Even when the whole game's up... ..we survive. Where's Laura? Isn't she down yet? Down? She isn't coming down, Mum. Why not? Is she ill? No, Mum, remember? You sacked her. Sacked? ! Oh... Oh, she thought... Oh, Poor Laura. Oh, shame on me, thinking only of myself! Ain't that my Lark Rise boy? Queenie... Dear Queenie. See, you belong here. Aah, you must've sensed something was afoot. Come along... Ladies and gentlemen, "The intention to marry of Mr Thomas Turrill "and Miss Victoria May Warrener." The banns be up! There's to be a wedding and a wedding breakfast. Sausages, a mountain of sausages! PEOPLE CHEER Congratulations Queenie, Twister. Laura... Dorcas. Laura, there has been a terrible misunderstanding. When I told you to leave, I didn't mean... I have been distracted and snappish, but you are essential. Am I not making myself clear? Oh, dear. Laura, please come back to work. Oh! Yes! Yes, Miss Lane. There, you see! Miss Lane, I thought what I lost was the biggest, most important thing, but there's other love. I'm sure there will be other loves for you, Laura. No, I mean other kinds. I mean... I love my life. At the post office. With you. Emma, look at this, my father's birth certificate. He was two years older than his brother Edmund. I don't understand... My father, God rest him, would have been 70 this year, making Edmund only 68... Pa! Pa... Did you change your age for some reason? Change my age? Yes, Uncle Edmund, did you? Perhaps a long time ago? Oh, I did an'all! I was too young to be a stable hand, but I was a big, strong lad, so I upped my age to 17 to get the job. And have a tilt at the girls! And forgot all about it since. Hang on...does that mean I can go back to work? It may well do. Only if you want to. Of course, you're more than welcome to stay here. That's kind, child, but I'm not one for retiring. Got too much get up and go in me. Aye, we noticed. Two years time, Pa, Edmund will have left, there'll be a bit more room. Come live with us then? Don't worry, son, I'll help you with your trap. Miss Margaret... ..I am guilty of impropriety and deceit. I spent many hours at the hotel. Oh... I am unhappily well aware of the reason. Mrs Brice Coulson. Deliberately kept from you that I was employed there. I am ashamed. Employed? The three pounds I earned is as blood money. Employed? ! It burns a metaphorical hole in my pocket. Every penny shall go to the church. Perhaps the church might see fit to use it for the hire of an organ and organist at a forthcoming...nuptial? 'And although it was autumn, it was as if spring fever was in the air. 'Some behaved as if they were newly married. 'And some who, only a day ago, had determined they never would marry... '..they, once more, could sense the pull of nature.' I spoke in haste. It's my one weakness. I closed the door on you and... ..I am less certain of that decision. But...to be sure... ..I need some time. Walk on. 'Why don't you go to him and just say,' "You look so handsome"? You are too concerned with my business! You're next, Alfie. Me? Wed? That'll be the day. SHE SINGS Only give away your heart where it's truly yearned for. Ahem... Poor Miss Ellison. I have to find a degree of courage here. Oh, no, no! SMASH! The bees are gone! I Come With The Rain Jesus is in agony. Till the end of the world. Los Angeles Two years later I'm sorry, mr. Kline, for this deeply unpleasent arrangement. I apologize. I have a fear of being contaminated by all sorts of things. I have an only son, whose name is Shitao. Three years ago, without any explanation He left for Asia. A year after he left, he sent me a telegram from the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. He asked me to deposit $10,000 into his account. I did so. Without question. A month later, he asked for the same amount again. This time I sent a detective A man named Vargas. Vargas searched for 6 weeks and had reasons to believe that my son was looking after an orphanage. In an area occupied by gold miners. A short while later, I received a telegram from Vargas. He said everything was fine, That I could send the money, that it was for the orphanage. I sent the money. Since then... Thirteen months have passed without any news. No means of reaching Vargas. Do you have any idea why your son left? You must understand, mr. Kline, that Main is the largest pharmaceutical conglomerate in the world. I built this empire from nothing. Through sheer force of will. Perhaps I was too hard on my son. Since he was 10 years old, I've only ever seen my boy from there. Where you are now sitting. Please, find him. You have carte blanche, mr. Kline. Spend whatever you need to spend. But please, bring me back my son. When and where will you begin your enquiry? I have another job I am finishing up in a couple of days. I guess I will start the minute after and pick it up where Vargas left off. Very well, mr. Kline. Thank you. MINDANAO, Philippines Someone swore to me that he saw three men kill Shitao one night about seven months ago. They dragged his body into the jungle and buried it somewhere. Why would they kill him? At first Shitao kept the orphanage going with money from his father. Then one morning, he shut himself up here in this room for three days without eating. When he came out... He went directly to the richest miners around. to ask them for donations. One man... Never, if anything... Saw Shitao... Sat on the ground... in front of that man's house... And he talked... For hours and hours and hours... The man... didn't chase him away... He didn't hit him up... He said nothing to him. Then... One night... He had him killed. I want your advice, Vargas... On my way here, I got a phone call. It was Shitao's father. He told me something. He has a sisters that lives in Hong Kong. Except from Shitao, she's the only family he has left. Two days ago, she went to their parents' grave And she found fresh flowers. She called her brother... Scolding him for being in Hong Kong and not calling her. When he told her he hadn't budged from L.A. Naturally I assumed it was Shitao who left flowers at the grave. - He decided to leave the evidence. - That's what I said. But they want me to go to Hong Kong and check it out. I have no reason to doubt that the person who told me he'd seen Shitao murdered by three men. But I never said anything to my employer because... I didn't have any real proof of his death... Everything points to his being dead, but.... I know deep down That he's still alive. If I were you... I'd go to Hong Kong. Thanks. Here is a photo I took of Shitao. I think it's the most recent one. HONG KONG Save my boy, please, save him. Save my boy, please. Are you ok? Hi. I'm looking for Detective Ju Meng Zi. May I see your id please? Hey, how are you? - Good to see you. - Nice to see you too. What's going on? Who was that? Su Dongpo. An asshole. I'll take you to dinner tonight. Sorry, I was annoying. It's no problem. Who's complaining? Well, are you looking for a guy in Hong kong? Yeah. What have you got on him? Name, age, cards, a couple of photos. Give me your right hand. Christ, show me your other hand. What happened to you? You did it yourself? Come with me, I'm taking you to the infirmery. Maybe he looks totally different since the last picture was taken. Yes, possible. We'll see what the computers have to say about your man, ok? I'm restoring the house of the Lord. He is coming. Look, he's the crazy guy who painted the golden stuff. Who is the Lord? Is it Jesus? The Christ? The Buddha? It's traditional meal. You've got to taste that thing. The fish has to be at least 75 years old. Try it. It won't kill you. Come on. Try it. - So, good. - Ok, tell me, why do you quit the force? They made me see a shrink, that's why I quit the force. Just because of a murderer... He was... He killed 24 people... He considered himself an artist... He used to make scultpures of his victims' bodies. This guy could disect his victims so quickly they were still alive. What he... That's really disgusting. After 27 months on the case... I think I kind of... overidentified with him. I... It was the only way I could figure out what he's gonna do next. So I had to think like him, I had to live like him, and... in the end I think I got a little contaminated. Yeah, contaminated. Did you catch him? Yeah, I caught him, it was easy. It was easy? Yeah, it was easy. Because... He was ready to be caught. There were a lot of guys working on the case, but... He chose me... He chose you... He called me at 4 o'clock in the morning... He told me to come along, so I went... You went all by yourself? I went by myself and I killed him. I know what you are thinking. If you try, I'll help you. I know I can always count on you. I can't do it without you. Everyone has... They're all talking about this cop. This Ju Meng Zi. What about you? The thing... He could make things difficult for us? You have my respect and my trust... I'm just waiting for you... To give me something to pass to the others. The ones who don't really know you. This is a gift for your wife. I know she loves crab. These are the first of the season. I promise you... Ju Meng Zi will not taste them this year. That decision... Will serve the spirits... A wise decision. Five star... Who are you working for? World's biggest pharmaceutical company... I have complete control. No credit limit. In your shoes... I wouldn't be in a hurry to find your guys. I've never slept in a 5-star hotel. Mifu, how's it going? You seemed stressed out. Gambling did get you down? I need to freshen up. Is that alright? No noises. Be quiet. Lili is sleeping. I keep him with me Out of respect for his uncle. I shouldn't. He's a hot head. Mifu? What are you up to, Mifu? You don't... I just want to cool off. Put the money into these bags. Su DongPo lives around here. We're just going to drive by, see if he is still up. i think it's the street we just passed. He's dead. I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man. Su Dongpo is gonna kill me. What? He shot first. If I die with my eyes open... Will you close them for me? No, no, no... Thank you. Hey. Someone's called us on this phone. And there's still no sign of the bum that lives in the hut. What the fuck happened here? Meng Zi? - Meng Zi? - What? Look what I found. Look at the shelter, right? You may think it's a bum shelter, but it's something else. A bum, a real one, he collects stuff, he hoardes it. He.. He adds to it. But this... This hut is clean. The guy who lives here is not a bum. He's something else... And what bothers me the most... Is that it looks just like Shitao's place in Mindanao. Wait, don't jump to conclusions, ok? Imagine... If the jacket that I saw this morning Is this jacket... Imagine... If Shitao lives here... It means that the guy I was looking for was standing directly in front of me with a big fucking X butt to spot on his back Kline. Wait. Flesh. It's amazing... Fresh and flesh. I was always there. Just waiting for a great artist like Hesford to come and use it. Hesford was not an artist, mr. Kline. He was a murderer. Mr. Kline, he was a murderer. - Hello? - They are the same prints. You awake? What? The same prints? The prints from the bum with the yellow jacket in my office Are the same as the ones on the door of Mifu's car. And the same as the ones on the glass in the hut. They are the same prints. Hello? You still there? I don't understand a word you're saying. I'll be in your hotel in 10 minutes. I need a fix. Please, give it to me. In the glove box... There will be photos... You can't see his face. The cop saw scares on the guy's wrists. So he took him to the infirmery. The doctor took photos, but he didn't take a picture of this guy's face. Because he was interested in this weird cuts. Hey, look at this. Hey, Dungpo, what a surprise, eh? Looking for something? A dead body maybe, right... Or a bag full of cash... I know you are into this shit. And I will catch you, you asshole. Hello, you hear me? Dick hed, huh? Ok, ***. You will be behind bars soon. And you wanna hear the best part? I'll be able to fuck your lovely Lili for 10 bucks.. Hey, do me a favor. next time in your car, try not to put it in reverse. He never ceases to amaze me. Say one word against his whore And he goes ballistic. He loves her. You're trying to tell me he can love a woman? This guy is the meanest, The most pitiless guy in the world. I don't see how he could love anyone. I need you to find me an apartment, ok? I need somewhere to work. So? This is a crime scene. Sure you'll be fine? This is your choice. - Do you know what happened? - Yes. Hey. You're working for the husband. But right away you find yourself taking the wife's side because you're following her around the clock. You feel that you know her better than anybody. The day you find out she's cheating... The blood rushes to your head, your ears start to burn... Your heart feels like it's gonna explode. You feel like... You're the one she's cheating on. And from that moment on, she becomes the sexiest woman in the world. You know what I mean? Show me. 9 mm... Parabellum Comes out of the barrel at over 300m/s. That's a good bullet. Can I hold it? The gun? Hold it... With both hands... Close the door. Put them down. Face the door. Hands up. What happened to your eye? You had a problem making an arrest. Sit on the sofa. If you were friends, I admit then. It was a woman with me. And I wasn't making an arrest. I was off-duty. Ever think about killing yourself? Nine milimeter. Lili... Su DongPo's whore... Was in a car with Mifu... The dead guy we found at the hut. Before he took Su DongPo safe. And took the girl hostage. Lili never come back. So... Su DongPo thinks... The bum has something to do with Lili's disappearance. And he's looking for him. Yeah? Did I wake you? Look... I'm watching you sleep. Look in your fridge, I'm going home tomorrow. I miss Su DongPo. Move. Move. Keep moving. Keep moving. Who are you? Come on, tell me. Tell me! So... Tell me what you felt when you looked at it. I puked. No... What did you feel before that. What did it tell you? It told me that you'd eaten a corpse. How did you know I'd eaten it? Say it. You tell me and I'll tell you where I am. You don't have to tell me where you are. I already know. Come by yourself. No, please! Please, stop. - Bring me someone else. - No. Go away! Stop! You're going to be ok. I'm here for you now. I won't leave you. I know it hurts. You're going to be ok. I'm here for you now. Everything will be ok. There's nothing on Earth I wouldn't do for you. Please just stop. No, no, please. The suffering of mankind... The marvel of the Universe... Is.. Is it anything... More beautiful on this Earth? In Golgotha... There is... The most sublime tree.. A cross.... And a more sublime body... Yours. Nude. Lifeless... I've... Created... From the suffering... Of man kind. You're here... And your body... I've achieved... What was missing in the Passion of Christ. Here... Agony... Has been achieved. I promised you a happy ending. Here it is. Take it. Thank you... No, no, no, no... Don't be afraid of me. I'm not afraid of you. Don't be blinded... By fear. You don't know what I've done. I'm not afraid of you. You still think I'm scared of you? Men like you... Always fear me. Don't hurt me anymore. I beg you. I'm frightened. I forgive you... You don't know what you do. I don't want your forgiveness. The lord is among us. Is it you? It hurts. He suffered for us all. - Let me go. - Let you go? Let you go where? No one can keep the Lord from going wherever he wants. I'm going to spread the good news. I just want to know where he is. Listen... I was sent here to find this man and bring him home to his father. That's all I want. I'm not afraid of you. You don't know what I've done. Who are you? My name is Kline. Your father sent me to bring you home. Father? I'd like to talk with you about that letter of recommendation to my alma mater, Clementine College. Are you gonna write me that letter? A good recommendation from you will guarantee me a spot in that corral. Look, Justin, I know the teenage years are about your search for an identity. But the western thing, that's mine. Sorry, Mr. Litate. Now, we need a director for the school's production of Peter Pan. And I think that director should be you. Pull it off, and I'll write that letter. Uh, no offense, but isn't that kind of blackmail? Blackmail is just the sort of thing they teach at good old Clementine College. Except they call it "ethics." Good luck, Mr. Director. People are already talking about you direing the school play. That's perfect. I got the role of Peter Pan in the can! Uh, not so fast, Zeke. I need to find the best actor by holding auditions. Uh, well that's perfect. I have just the audition piece. I took my report on Mexico's economy, set the whole thing to music. Check it out. * Mexico, Mexico * * Is a unique and emerging marketplace * * Ohhh Mexico! * * Ohhh Mexico! * - I gotcha. - * Mexico... * I got it. Yeah. Auditions will be tomorrow. Please bring something else. Tribeca Prep, autions for a Justin Russo production of Peter Pan will be held tomorw. And since I have your attention, I'm closing in on who put my gym clothes on the roof. Eric Winer. Yeah! Miss Russo. I was filing your delinquent slip when I noticed you hadn't fulfilled your extracurricular requirement. So I signed you up for Locker Refurbish Club. No, thanks. Perhaps you'd like me to define the word "requirement" for you. - No, thanks. - You have to! You can't be too busy being cute or charming, and being you is not a full-time job. Well, the thing is... Um... I'm gonna be in my brother's play. And you know how I'm always telling you things and then later on, you find out they aren't true? That's 'cause I'm a good actor. So you're too busy in the school play to be in Locker Refurbish Club? Well, I was ready to take on both, but you make an excellent point. Glad we had this talk. * Well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze * * That the end will no doubt justify the means * * You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease * * Yes please * * But you might find out it'll go to your head * * When you write a report on a book you never read * * With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed * * That's what I said * * Everything is not what it seems * * You can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams * * You might run into trouble if you go to extremes * * Because everything is not what it seems * * Everything is not what it seems * * When you can have what you want by the simplest of means * * Be careful not to mess with the balance of things * * Because everything is not * * What it seems * Hey, what are you up to, Max? Well, I'm the new reviewer for the school newspaper. I've always known you had promise, honey. Now I know what it was for. But if only I could think of something to review... Hmm. - Like a movie called Elasto-Man Snaps Back, playing at 3:45 or 4:15. You know, you're right. A writer needs inspiration. I'll take you. Let me finish this order, OK? And that is how you get your mom to take you to the movies before homework. Mom, did you hear that? He's using his school activities to get you to take him to the movies. No, honey. I'm using his school activities to cut my shift in half. Harper, you know how you said you loved the theater? I never said I loved the theater. Oh, I just assumed, the way you dress in all those costumes. Costumes? OK, let's start over. I'm gonna be an understudy in Justin's play. It should be easy because I understudy for most things. But understudies only get on stage if the other actor gets sick or injured. Exactly. And you have perfect school attendance because you never get sick. That's why you're gonna be Tinker Bell and I'm gonna be your understudy. Alex, you and I being involved in the same activity is not a good idea. You know how competitive I am. I'll crush you like a bug, just like I did in Skee-Ball. OK, let's try this again. You play Tinker Bell. I'm your understudy. You'll never miss. I'll never go on. Everyone's happy. OK, I guess we're not competing. 'Cause I will crush you. Why don't you go upstairs and start my homework. I'll make us some sandwiches. Oh, thanks, Alex. That's so generous of you. One Italian sub and a tuna salad on wheat. Got it! - Hey, Justin. - Hey, what's up? Oh, just makin' some sandwiches. That's a nice dollhouse. It's a diorama for the school play. Ah, that's right. I heard you were directing that. So, uh, who were you thinking for Tinker Bell's understudy? Oh... Tinker Bell's understudy. You want to be Tinker Bell's understudy. Well, um... You're gonna have to audition like everyone else. Why? You know I'm a good actor. I've been acting like I like you for years. No one thinks you like me. But I really do and I act like I don't. Pshh! That's acting. Alex, your order's up. Which table? Oh, I'll take those. Aw, that's my girl, always helping. Mom's helping Max. Alex is serving sandwiches. Where would we be without our ladies? Um... So, what do we got going on here? I'm directing the school play. Ah, my son's a director. That's fantastic! I don't know if you know this about me, but I've dabbled in the theatre arts. - You, Dad? - Oh, yeah. I directed a lot of high school plays when I was your age. And as a fellow director, I'm gonna make sure that you succeed. Any questions, you come to your old man. I have one. Should I let Alex be Tinker Bell's understudy? Which one of these is the understudy? Uh... - This one? - Yeah. - Got it? - Oh, yeah. I just always wanna be a little boy and to have fun. This world moves pretty fast, you know. It's not long before you're carrying a briefcase and heading to work, day in and day out. For what? These are the best days of our lives. Have a great summer. I'll see you guys next year! Was that your eighth grade graduation speech? I was told it was inspiring. And it was! The role of Peter Pan goes to Zeke Beakerman. Whoo! Yes! Next up, reading for the role of Tinker Bell is... Harper Finkle. No, it is poison! "Oh, Tink. Did you drink the medicine to save me?" Yes! "But, why, Tink? Now, you don't look so good." I think I might get well again, if the boys and girls believed in fairies. - What was that? - Fairy dust. Cheese puff powder. Look. Great. She was pretty good. The role of Tinker Bell goes to Harper Finkle. Now, the only thing left is auditions for Tinker Bell's understudy. Look, Alex, um... I spoke to some people in the directing community. People who are very close to me, and they advised me letting you anywhere near this production would be sure disaster. People close to you? So that means Zeke or Dad. Oh, it wasn't me, Alex. I swear. Oh, so then, Dad's directing this play. No, I am. I make my own decisions. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - Prove it. - Fine. Watch. Alex Russo's the understudy. There. I showed you. - Well, I don't want to do it. - You have to. I'm the director. - OK, then fine. I'll do it. - Good. Ha. Listen up, cast. I need everyone to stay healthy for the show. Yes. That's right. Because I don't want to have to step in. I have very little interest in this, and I've never even been to this part of the school. OK, here are the ground rules. Save your voice, don't do anything dangerous, and that includes tap-dancing. - Aww. - Hmm. You got it, chief. I'm gonna start being careful right now. - Whoa. - Whoa! Oh. That was close. I almost slipped on my cheddar cheese fairy dust. Ooof! - Harper, are you OK? - I don't know. Is my foot supposed to bend this way? Whoa. Looks like a rider got thrown off her horse. Sit tight, little filly. The nurse is on her way. She was Tinker Bell. Now, I'm gonna have to hold auditions all over again. Don't you have an understudy? I'd rather not say. Alex is my understudy. Alex, congratulations. You get to saddle up for the rodeo. Out of my way. I gotta throw myself off the stage. Make some room! You're in the show, Alex. Working on your review, Max? I'm so glad you finally found something you're half-good at. Right, here it is... "I saw Elasto-Man Snaps Back with my mom last night, which was a big mistake, because she didn't put enough butter on the popcorn. And that's the Max View." Dad, I gotta talk to you about the play. I got a big problem. As long as it doesn't involve Alex, there's nothing we can't solve. Lay it on me. - Never mind. - Oh, it's Alex? What did I say to you? You made her the understudy, didn't you? It's not as bad as it seems. I still got my main man, Zeke, dialed in on the role of Peter Pan. He'll just have to carry the entire show. Hey, Justin. Uh, there's something I gotta tell ya. What did I say? No tap-dancing! I wasn't. I went to tap-dancing class to tell them I couldn't make it. But then clog-dancing class started. And I was like, "Oh, man! Clogging?" And I fell off my shoes. All right, all right. Nobody panic. I said I was gonna help you, and I am gonna help you. - I'm gonna play Peter Pan. - Dad... If I shave twice in the morning, throw on my letterman jacket, I can pass as a high school senior. We'll just say I'm your cousin visiting from the country. A country of what, old dudes? - I can still do it. - Thank you. I'll catch you at rehearsal. This will never work. I won't get Laritate's recommendation, I'm not gonna get into Clementine College, and I can kiss robotic engineering goodbye. Justin, are you talking about kissing robots again? You're gonna get electrocuted eventually. Alex, you need to take this seriously. Your brother needs you to be the best Tinker Bell you can be. His college career is depending on you. You're right, Daddy. Justin's depending on me, and you're depending on me. I gotta do whatever I need to do to not let you guys down. Hiring a real fairy to play your part is less work than playing the part yourself? Harper, there's not enough room to write 27 lines of dialogue on my hand. Welcome to Fairy World. May all your dreams come true. Hi. - Look, Sparkles won't work under these conditions! Her wings need to be massaged and steamed. Those things are her money-makers. Come on! Last time I send a dwarf to do an elf's job. How can I help? I need to hire a fairy actress. Well, you have come to the right place. Of all the fairy talent agencies, FTA has, by far, the fanciest offices. I should sit down. And some advice: don't tile your cast. It's like lugging around a bathroom wall. Don't sit there! It's just for looks. It's made entirely of gum drops and licorice. Who'd mix candy with furniture? Oh, wait. I would. Here are some pictures of fairies. - OK. - Do you see one you like? Anyone really standing out? Anyone popping for you? These are pictures of the same fairy. You have a good eye. If it's Flutter you want, then Flutter you've got. OK. How soon can she start? You're girls. I'm Flutter. Well, this is working out. Let's all get to know each other. No, Harper! You're clumsy. See, Harper? She looks just like me. OK, you're gonna play me, playing Tinker Bell in the play. All right. Let's try a scene from the play. I'm tired of playing fairies. I want to play a cop. Hands up where I can see 'em, pal! Oh, she's a good actress. - I can't see 'em. - Oh! Flutter, you are a fairy. Fairies play fairies. I don't know, Alex. This fairy wants to play a cop, and she's packing heat. I say we let her. Who's this? That's Harper. No. Who's the one with the wings? Oh, that's Flutter. You're a man, and you're a lady. What is a fairy doing here? She is leaving. Come on, Flutter. A second ago, you wanted me to play the role of Tinker Bell. You smuggled a fairy across Never Land lines to impersonate you in your brother's play? I'm no wizard, but that sounds like a crime. It's not a crime. And I suppose you spent all this time working on this scheme instead of learning your lines? I don't think I should answer that until I'm assigned a Never Land attorney. Alex, we're not in a crime drama right now. Oh! But if we are, can I play the cop? Check this out. Hands up pal, freeze! Up against the wall. Spread 'em, punk. She's good. Tink, no! What are you doing? Peter Pan, do not take your medicine. It has been poisoned. No! I promised Wendy I'd take it. Ew, is this diet? Ugh. Ew. Oh, would you die already? Fine. I'm dead. Oh, Tink. Did you drink the medicine to save me? - Uh, yeah. - With feeling! Oh. With feeling. Dad, you're gonna have to go shave, get on your letterman jacket. Don't worry. Directors always have a back-up plan. And I'd like you to meet ours. You're a boy. But why, Tink? Why? Now, you don't look so good. I think I might get well again, if the boys... If the boys and girls believed in fairies. Do you believe? Say quick that you believe! Clap your hands. Don't let Tinker Bell's light go out. This is the part where you clap for me, and I come back to life. Mom? Sorry, sweetie. OK. It's go time. Come on, one clap? Anybody? Anything? How 'bout them Mets? Works for me. Come on, let's go save Wendy. Freeze, Tinker Bell. You're going downtown for bad acting, punk. - Flutter? - Sergeant Flutter. You're coming with me, straight to the slammer. Flutter, you have to get out of here before people start to think you're a real fairy. They're definitely gonna think you're a real fairy. Ow. Ow. Ow. See that? That's how you play a fairy. Well, this is how you get rid of a fairy. I'm thinking maybe we should leave before this is over. - Split a cab downtown? - Oh, yeah. Let's go. Jerry! All right, Sergeant Flutter. You have the right to remain silent. In this drawer. Ow. Boo! That's good, Max. Here he comes. I'm sure there are plenty of colleges that'll take you. I can get you into my alma mater. Mom, you went to an all-girls college. Wait. That could work. Yeah, I'll come visit. Um... I'm just trying to help out my son. Look, Justin. We wrote a letter of recommendation for you. "Dear Clementine College, here is a review of Justin Russo's directing debut. In this ambitious production, Tinker Bell swats down her own inner-demon Previously on Dexter... Judging from the spray, we're looking at somebody tall. Over six feet. (Dexter) He moved the arm. For a reason. The killer leaves the ash as his signature, making his vics point at it. Lundy came to Miami to hunt this guy. I think he got too close and I think it got him killed and me shot. It's been my dad's baby for years. A few days ago, he hands me the keys. No, no. Smooth circular motions, son. - I got it, Dad. - If you got it, I wouldn't have to remind you. Small cracks in the perfect family. (Christine) I can lose my job. Not like I'm the only one. Being a journalist these days is like a straight ticket to the unemployment line. Either I get a lead that bleeds or basically... I'm done. Are the sweeps connected to the shootings of Agent Lundy? I know it's really tough for reporters right now. So maybe instead of this one, I can give you that interview you've been wanting from me. Mother shit fuck. How tall was my shooter? My height. - Then it wasn't Trinity? - Nope. I was a "dress over the head" party girl. - You must think I'm... - Totally charming. We broke up. Officially. If I find out this is bullshit, there will be severe, career-ending consequences. Fuck it. (Dexter) No more confessions, no more good deeds, and no more fucking remorse. No, you're mine. Arthur Mitchell, you just got a reprieve. This'll do the job. Cut you into exactly the right size pieces. You got one more day. (Laughter) (Dexter) Happy families are all alike. They never leave you by yourself on holidays. (Arthur) I got some interesting Thanksgiving greetings from your Coach Davis. If you're not gonna play baseball anymore, I suppose you aren't gonna need this. - No, D-Dad... - All right? How about this? Oh, you're full of awards. Once the turkey's gone... so is Arthur. How about this one? This one's for Most Valuable Player. (Door slams, engine starts) Fuck you, Dad. (Engine revs, tires screech) Family business. It's my business too. OK. Healthy way to blow off steam. (Grunts) - What the hell? - (Roars) Jonah? Hey, it's just me. - Mr. Butler, what are you doing here? - I stopped by your house. I saw you arguing with your father. No, I don't argue. - I never argue. - Still, it looked like a bad one. Man, you have no idea what he's like. How he treats my mother and Rebecca. You don't know what he's capable of. - Well, actually... - He hits me. That's not right. You know, I'm running out of clichés to tell the coaches. You know, "Hey, I fell down some stairs. I walked into a door." I know it looks like we have the perfect fucking family, but in that house... when he's there, it's not a life; it's a tour of duty. Shit. I... - He'd kill me if he knew I was telling you. - I won't say a word. You should have just let him die. - Where you going? - Anywhere away from here. I can't go back. Not to him. Not with the car like this. So I'll go with you. I'll be there when you tell him. - Why? - You're not the only one with father issues. Well, you know, maybe... I mean, I guess if you came to Thanksgiving tomorrow, - Dad would be on his best. - Thanksgiving? Dinner's at one. I can stay at Luke's house until then. Guess I'm having two turkey dinners this year. The DNA sweep didn't give them Trinity. But it did bring in a cornucopia of criminals. That should keep Miami Metro off the Trinity case through the holiday. Deb won't be anywhere near as easy. Sorry, Dex, but I'm spending Thanksgiving with 90 or so of my newest friends. Look at these victims. It looks like a family portrait. The bathtub women, they're always young and single. A first girlfriend maybe. The jumper's always a mother of two. Maybe that represents his mom or his wife. But I don't think this guy's married. The bludgeonee's always a father... You used to love Thanksgiving when we were kids. You wore the little Indian headdresses. Picked the pearl onions out of the green beans. Yeah. Mom's green beans. And then she died. And it was you and me and Dad and football and TV dinners in aluminum trays. - Talk about your lonely. - Well, you won't be lonely at our house. You'll never get the chance. Dexter... I am lead detective on the biggest case of my career. - This is where I belong. - I thought Batista was lead. He's the lead on Lundy now. Once we figured out Trinity didn't shoot me, - there was no conflict for me... - What? Wait. Trinity didn't shoot you? While you were at your Rain Man convention, Masuka and I put it together form the bullet's trajectory. - How did I not see that? - We were too close. That's what happens when you make it personal. (Sighs) So I've heard. So...who shot you? Maybe Trinity knows. I'll ask him when I haul his ass in here. Deb, you really, really need to come to Thanksgiving. Tell the family I said "hi". (Batista) Heads up, everybody. This DNA sweep has been like Christmas. We got hits on three open rape cases and one open burglary case, but best of all, hits on two homicides. Merry Thanksgiving, Soderquist. This one is mine. Keep up the good work, guys. - Sarge...any news on any other cases? - We'll find the fucker who shot you. You know that. Focus on what you can control. - Catching Trinity. - Catching Trinity. (Knocks on door) I heard the ACLU's filing suit on the sweeps. We've got maybe 72 hours till we're shut down for good. - We'll just have to keep pushing harder. - The holidays may slow us down. - We'll have a skeleton crew. - I'll be here. Never been much for family holidays anyway. Particularly when they're all still in Cuba. Particularly. Are you with Auri tomorrow? - She's with her moms this year. - Hmm. Plus I have a chance to close an old case of mine, so... So I guess we'll both be working Thanksgiving. Together. How unfortunate. (Cody) Put it up higher, Mom. (Rita) No, I want it lower. Are happy families all alike? (Rita) Much better. - (Cody) Dexter's home! - Oh, good. They didn't run out of pies. - Here you go. - (Giggles) OK, bird, confess. - How big are you? - 22 pounds. - That's a lot of bird. - Better too much than not enough. I mean, that's what the holiday's about. That and family. - About tomorrow... - Uh-oh. It's not a big deal, but the Monroe County PD needs a spatter interpretation on a bar fight and their blood guy's in the Bahamas. (Sighs) Should just take a few hours. - Does it have to be tomorrow? - That's when the reconstruction is. - Mm. - Plus I'll be making triple overtime. Sure, that's a plus... but you'll be missing all the fun. Yeah. Poor you. Poor us. - At least Elliot will be here. - Yeah, good old Elliot. So is Deb coming? She's on the fence. (Sighs) No, tell her that this is our first family Thanksgiving and that we're establishing traditions that will shape our kids and that they'll pass on to their kids and that she's a part of that. An important part of that. (Grunts) (Sighs) Rather than me tell her all that... (Dexter) OK, guys, now look real sad, I mean, really miserable. And...action. Hi, Aunt Deb. We just heard that you might not come to Thanksgiving dinner, - and, well... - We really want you to come. - Look sad, retard. - All right, all right. Just... Take two. Will you please come over? Fuck me. (Sighs) You're here late. Ah, didn't even notice. - Big plans tomorrow? - (Chuckles) You're looking at them. Whatever about tomorrow, right? It's just another day where people eat turkey. I can eat turkey any day of the year. Dexter's having people over. Well, me. He invited me over. Have a good time. You know... (Sighs) - I could use a wingman... - Yes. I can't promise it'll be any fun. Well, I could be your thigh man. (Chuckles) Don't press your luck. I'll let Rita know. (Exhales) What time do you want to eat tomorrow? Oh, bad news, babe. I got to work. Oh. Well, what time do you get off? Uh... You do want to spend the holiday together, don't you? - It's a holiday. - (Chuckles) Exactly. Spending it together makes things all... serious. Oh, it's just a casual Thanksgiving with your girlfriend. Girlfriend? That sounds...really serious. Joey... I don't want to spend it alone. (Chuckles) Plus, uh... I make the best pecan pie in the state of Florida. I guess I could, you know... come by for dessert. Oh, so you just want to eat my pie. Is that it? (Chuckles) - Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Mitchell. - Happy Thanksgiving! I'll be at Arthur's by one, home by four. A serial killer's Thanksgiving recipe for success. - How can none of these be big enough? - Well, maybe if we, um... (Mimics Julia Child) Turn the bird on its side... - (All laugh) - Hey, Dex. Howdy, pilgrim. Did you hear that the pilgrims didn't eat turkey on the first Thanksgiving? - Really? - They ate corn and eel, which the Native Americans taught them to plant and fish. Then the pilgrims slaughtered them all, took their food, and went to church the next day to thank God for all their good luck. Mm, it's a phase. Don't worry about it. What you said about traditions shaping our kids... My not going to work, will that... misshape them? Look, I wish it was otherwise, but you'll be home soon, right? Right. I just... I don't want to do any damage. (Chuckles) You're a parent. Parents do damage. Hopefully we'll do enough of the good stuff to balance it out. Hopefully. Thanks. - "Ashes to ashes..." - Doughnut to doughnut. - It's all the store had left. - What are you doing here? Avoiding Christine. She can be a little intense. Tell me about it. She keeps calling to set that interview with me. - You said you'd do it. - Little busy here. Look at the timing of the Trinity kills. 15 in December, 40 in July and August... 20 or so in the spring. What's the pattern? Long-haul truck driver? Migrant worker? Some kind of salesman. Yeah. Gobble, gobble. - She's nothing if not persistent. - Hey, babe. What are you doing here? I thought I'd bring Thanksgiving to you. How sweet. - There's enough for both of you. - Oh, thanks, but I'm heading out. - Debra's taking the day off. - Fuck that. I'll be multitasking. - Well, I guess you can take the day off too. - Sure he can. Yeah, let me just...check with the boss. We'll go eat. So, Debra...how are you feeling? Do you mind if we put off that interview until after the holiday? I'm not here as a reporter; I'm here as Joey's...girlfriend. - My condolences. - (Chuckles) You know, he really cares about you. After you got shot, you were all he could talk about. - Really messed him up. - Well, that makes two of us. I just... I just wanted to say... Um... I'm really sorry... about what happened to you. I can't even imagine... looking into the eyes of the person you love... watching as he takes his last breath. Let's hope you never have to. (Muffled chatter) You got Lloyd Paulson to confess? Been waiting ten years to close this one. I promised the victim's husband I'd find the man who killed his wife. Finally lived up to that promise. You should go tell the husband. Give him something to be thankful for. As soon as I process that pendejo. Do you want to come with? To a next-of-kin notification? It is official business. (Doorbell rings) - Kyle! - Happy Thanksgiving. To you too. Kyle. What a nice surprise. Apparently Jonah didn't mention inviting me. I just wanted to drop by and say hi. It's my first Thanksgiving without my family and I... didn't know what to do with myself. I suppose you should eat with us. Full tables, full hearts. Full bellies. Come on in. (Knocking) (Knocking) - Aunt Deb's here! - Happy Thanksgiving, turkeys. Thanks for the video. - Hi, Deb. - Hi, Deb. Hi. - (Hushed) Who's that? - Danny and Grace's dad. Danny, let me help. Ah. Where's Dexter? (Sighs) He's at some crime thing in Monroe County. - Said he'd be back for dinner. - He's more like Dad every day. Come look at our puzzle. We've already got the corners. Cody, leave her alone. - You don't want to help? - Sorry, little man, but I've got work to do. Oh. (Chuckles) You are good. Another three hours to go. When do you want to put in the broccoli-cheese casserole? About an hour before. The sweet potatoes need an hour and the corn pudding needs about 30 minutes. Is it all gonna fit? (Sighs) No. None of it's gonna fit. What was I thinking? You were thinking, "My fabulous neighbor has not one, but two ovens." (Sighs) You know, you really are a lifesaver. You should just wear a red cross on your forehead. - (Laughter) - (Elliot) Oven crisis. Deb, can you watch the kids? Harrison's asleep. Actually, I was gonna try to get some... Oh! ..work done. Vince, hi! Vince, Elliot. Elliot, Vince. Hi. Uh, bye. - Uh...bye. - Bye. - They're using his oven. - Oh. Well...guess I'll be using his oven too. Chocolate lava cakes. My specialty. You have a specialty? A river of chocolate love that melts in your mouth. Wow. You can make anything sound perverted. It's a gift. Arthur seems to be in a decent mood. Maybe I'll be able to slip out early. It's almost one. You want me to set the table? No, we've got to watch the game first. - The game? - Yeah, it's tradition, Kyle. Ah! Will the kids be joining us? That too would be tradition, but apparently Jonah has forgotten. I'm sure he's on his way. He knows how important holidays are to you. Not such a decent mood after all. Do you think Rebecca could come out now? I suppose. I'll go get her. - She grounded or something? - Oh, no. No, nothing like that. This is Carl Haas? He's been in a persistent vegetative state for several years. Stepped off a sidewalk, got hit by a bus. I didn't know. It's been a long time. Would it be possible to have a moment alone with him? Have a good Turkey Day. Tell him. Like he can hear me. He'll hear you. Mr. Haas... I'm the one who told you about your wife. I also promised that I'd fi... This is pointless. Mr. Haas, Angel knows how much your wife meant to you... and he wants you to know... I want you to know... that we found the guy who killed her. I wish... I wish we would have found him sooner. Really, I wish he would have never killed your wife, but I can't change that. Can't change anything. But we got the guy. We got him. - Hello, Mr. Butler. How are you? - Well, I'm fine, Rebecca. Kyle, you up for a little pre-game football toss? I suppose. I'll go help Mom in the kitchen. At least I have one perfect child. Yeah, so it would appear. Come on. Normally, Jonah supplies the football. - How about a baseball? - No. We throw the baseball in spring. Thanksgiving, we throw the football. Traditions matter, Kyle. Yes, they...shape people. Yeah, and give children a sense of history, tradition. Teaches them who they are and what's expected of them. And what is expected of them? Generosity, common sense, obedience. It's a father's responsibility to set the boundaries, child's duty to honor them. No, there's nothing down there. Stop! Kyle, no! I made that... when I was still confused. Well, it's beautiful. Which is why I haven't torn it apart. Probably donate it to the needy. Obviously, I won't be needing it. No, you'll be buried at sea. I have a new lease on life. - Thanks to you. - (Chuckles) Hey. Oh. The best laid plans... It's Jonah's. What's the point of giving him the better things in life if he can't take care of them? What kind of father keeps a coffin in his garage? What kind of father keeps blood slides in his shed? (Sighs) Hey, we can still get some... Here we go. Dad, I don't know what happened. The car was parked in Luke's driveway all night. I came out this morning and, you know, someone had just gone all mental on it. Dad, I am so sorry. (Sighs) That's why God invented car insurance, right? It'll be OK. There! Now it's drivable till we can get her fixed. Well... Game's about to start. Shall we? (Cody) Come on, Danny. Throw it here. (Cody) Come on, Danny. Throw it here. - Oh, good one. - Hey, you two. No wiffle ball in the house. I don't know how you do it. All these kids at home at the same time. (Chuckles) Thanksgiving's only four days. You should try keeping them entertained for three months in the summer. Yeah, plus spring break and Christmas break. That's when you're really climbing the walls. June, July, August... December. Oh... fu-u-udge! Trinity's in the school system. - (TV commentary) - Quinn. Joey, it's Deb. His kill schedule matches the school year. Trinity could be a janitor. He could be a cafeteria worker, a bus driver, a teacher, a principal. - We got to get to the station. - I haven't eaten yet. Jesus, grab a drumstick to go. Deb, no one's working today and we're gonna need a warrant to access any school databases. We can find a judge. Yeah, who's gonna love us for tearing him away from his family. Come on, we're not gonna get anywhere today. (Sighs) Fu... Fudge. - Break in a case? - We'll see. (Sighs) Not a horrible Thanksgiving, right? No, actually it's kinda nice. You sound surprised. I am a little. Hmm. So having a girlfriend isn't so bad after all? - You with the labels. - (Sighs) Why does it matter? I just... I care about you. I'd kinda like to have it returned. Come here. (Whispers) I have a better idea. Aw! - You are so my girlfriend. - (Laughs) Get...get...get him! Get him! Get...get...get...get him! Ah! - It's OK, they didn't get the first down. - (Sighs) Jonah seems safe for the moment. I'm not a big football fan. I think I'll go see if I can help Sally. Oh, that's very nice of you. Look at that. There's three men on him. (Jonah) Yeah, I know. This room's kinda young for a teenager. Are those to keep someone out... or keep someone in? My God. He locks his daughter in here. You need any help? I'm completely useless in the kitchen. Sure. Uh... something for the centerpiece. Roses. Dad always likes these. Everything for Dad, huh? Those locks on your door for him too? - He says they're there to protect me. - And do they? - (TV commentary) - He's open. He's open! Go, go! Touchdown! What a play! No, no. No, Dad. - (Crunching) - Ow! (Muffled scream) (Grunts) And that's for my windshield. Things of beauty need to be honored. I ran away once. He caught me and... - it was bad. - It's not always gonna be like this. (Scoffs) - Jonah told me that you're helping him. - Yeah, if you can call it that. You can help me too. Get me out of here. You just need to wait a while. You're too young to be on your own. I don't have to be on my own. I could be with you. - With me? - Jonah also says you're nice. I try to be. If you're nice to me, I can be nice to you. I'll do anything you want. Whoa... I don't... Rebecca, you're 15. I don't want anything from you. I don't believe you. - Look, I know what guys like. - No. Rebecca? Go inside. - (Exhales) Sally, it's not... - Shh! I am so sorry about Rebecca's behavior. Oh. Just...please... don't say anything to Arthur. Kyle, you can't. - Whatever you did with Rebecca... - I didn't. Whatever you're going to do, I don't care. Just, please, I'm begging you... don't tell him. I wouldn't. I wouldn't. I-I won't. Please. Yeah, I promise. Thank you. What the hell is he doing to these people? (Phone rings) - Rita, hi. - Hey. How far away are you? Uh... Probably about an hour or so. All right, well, I don't want you to be surprised when you get home. - About what? - Cody fell into your shed. - What? Is he OK? What happened? - Well, he's fine. He hit a wiffle ball onto the top of the shed, climbed up to get it, the skylight cracked... and he fell through. Elliot was gonna push in the air conditioner... - No, don't! - Uh, he didn't. - He took off the door with an axe. - So my shed has no door? Dexter, Cody was scared and crying. I told Elliot to get him out however he could. Yeah, of course, of course. I'll... ..thank Elliot when I get home. Well, I'll see you soon, OK? (Sighs) No one can get into the trunk's false bottom. You didn't think anyone could get into your shed either. I gotta get home. Now. (Jonah groans) Arthur, I just got a call and I think I have to... (Groans, inhales sharply) Jonah, what happened? - I whacked it on the coffee table. - My son, the klutz. This team hasn't been the same since they traded Johnson. What else will he do to Jonah if I leave? Turkey wraps, icees... And Cuervo Silver. - Only the best for you. - (Giggles) You know, I was thinking... Carl Haas's wife gets mugged. Boom. She's dead. Carl gets hit by a bus. Boom. He's a vegetable. You never know when you wake up in the morning - what the day will bring... - I love you. I love you. Are you saying that because you're afraid you'll get hit by a bus? No. Well...yes, but... I just want you to know what I know before I don't know it anymore. And I love you. - I love you! - Shh! I can hear you. - I love Maria Esperanza del Alma La... - Shh! (Laughs) I'm not gonna say it. is this the sand you want us to move? Yes. As soon as the promenade's clear, Bob will lay out the illuminations, ready to put them up. (whistles) Spick and span! (whistling) (mimicking whistle) That's the way, little birdie. Make it clean as a whistle! clean as a whistle! (WENDY ON PHONE) Things keep going missing? That is strange, Wendy. Sounds like you could do with an extra pair of hands. And an extra troweI. I'm on my way. -Everything all right? -Wendy says things keep disappearing. We'd better go and see what's going on. It gives me pleasure in declaring BobbIeIand... Where on earth is BobbIeIand? Get a grip, Bernard. How's the speech coming along? Having a bit of bother with me bobbIes! Oh, dear, time for a cup of tea. could you? Painting or pointing, Wendy? Painting. This time, I won't let this tin out of my sight. The sooner we get finished, the sooner we'II get these illuminations up. -Wendy... -Oh, not the illuminations! Our sand went missing, too. Right from under our diggers! Oh, maybe it's mice. ( CHUCKLES) They're a bit small to carry all that. What about big mice? Nobody move! There's been a robbery! Bruce, the shopkeeper! A robbery? Someone has taken my buckets and spades from outside my new shop! Sand, paint, trowels, illuminations, and now buckets and spades. I need to get to the bottom of this. It's a mystery, that's what I think. Something links all these things. But what? They looked so colourful. I had them arranged on the ground here. That's it. Everything that disappeared was on the ground. The illuminations, paint tin and trowel, buckets on the phone? Jessie, get your backpack taken. Libby, have your take what you need. Detective Albrecht take you to a ward where you will stay overnight. - Where do you go? - Take your things. I do not know what to take. My mother put things. You have to come back, not never left us. Come on! If you break it, you pay him. Maoinãrie bad, I ate 75 cents. Stay here. Be careful. Beautiful ! I have years of exercise. Come here. - You're owed a favor. - You read crane rights? Would you kept in his arms? No. - This is Sarah Mohr. - Hey. Sarah's mother answer the phones for your father. I thought that you can look here. Good. If you need something, anunþaþi me or Darla. Are you lucky, your father's head. I have to be careful, always messing up someone. I was never in his office. Seriously ? Say you should not mix work and family. Sometimes you've chosen. My mother left home? No, why do that? Mother and father quarreled today morning. Because ours. From my experience, when people screamed, it means they care about. The things that do not need to worry talking. Want to talk about something else? I do not want to speak. Then what do you do? Slammer ! I have a better game. Plimbã Paiu? Even when're here're not here. Do not start, Karen. Not now. - But when ? No time ever. - By God, I lost a colleague! Should you care even half that have your family lose. It may become cuminþi school. As we know, today has been taken hostage. Suspect telephoned three hours ago. We know that when a hostage to live. He said he was blinded her, so it's the same man. A closed before you can locate it. We supplemented ... I supplemented patrols in the East Bay and King Henry, where they spent the first two incidents. Do keep in mind, so far did not kill any hostages. Isolated policemen, so sit together. Without action by yourself! Questions? Of? The two hostages have given us information about this individual? No. He managed to protect themselves. Putem învãþa of the. Any questions ? That's all ? Good ! Let us do our job! You went into the house. Have you discovered something about it? Not about him. About Vincennes. Tell me. I need any information. (? ) They both made it in front of children. Tighten apologize after. Anything else? I felt primarily feelings. I can give a sense manhunt. I know that's your friend and that's get your heavy, but ... It's more than that. He's a cop. That's the biggest nightmare for any police officer for any husband. Or for a father. The woman who told you wear this much? Yes. But I think we hiding something. I pressed her, but how much could be in her situation. Where is it ? At the hospital. Where are you going ? I have nothing to do with feelings. I need a name, an address. A shoe size. One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, and four to go. And one that should rise. I forgot. These books are good? Certainly. You must keep all figures. But all are figures. atiu. How do you do that? Poth ever to go to bluff. Mother to die. Mama voastrã n-o sã moarã. How do you know? Want to tell your children's version or the truth? I do not want to go to bluff. Good. Comers here. You see those people? All the free her mother working as yours. But she's not here. So it is.

Arrest him! I want that son of a bitch arrested for assault. I promise they won't assault you again. What? You saw the whole thing. I saw you and Bo insult Candace Pennington and attack her father. No, that's the way I saw it. Me, too. He punched my kid for no reason. I think there was a reason. What, the picture of you in my bedroom? What do you do with it when you have a sleepover? -So, what do you think? -About sleepovers? No, about me coming up. See, every news outlet in the country... is dying for some sort of inside something on this. I know. I thought I could come out with a cameraman and track the investigation. An inside look at how you're handling it. -No. -We could do a whole series about it. -No, Jenn. -I'd stay out of the way. Hey, Abby. Hey, Jesse. Two in the chest, just like the others. Cold morning. Might make the time of death a little harder. Hey, Doc. Not now. Jesse, I'm sorry. Maybe I should just say, "The hell with it, " and be a drunk. I don't see what purpose is served by locking these children up. You think they didn't know it was wrong? That they couldn't control themselves? -Well, they didn't. -No plea-bargains. They deserve jail time. Right now, Candace can't imagine going to school tomorrow. She cannot imagine facing all the kids that will know... she was gang-raped and photographed naked... and the three guys who did it will be in the same school with her. Maybe the same class. I may not be a little girl anymore, but I am a woman. And as a woman, I sympathise with her. Did the court specify the community service? Not yet. Let me have each of them in a cell for an hour. Let me beat the crap out of them. -You're joking? -l am. But why not let them serve their sentence with the police department? You would, of course, take your supervisory responsibilities seriously. I would bust their chops I'll see what I can do. What about unsolved murders in the Cleveland area? A young girl was shot at a bus stop in Parma, which is near Cleveland. I know where Parma is. The only thing that matches this m. o... are two killings in Hilton Head, 1999... and three in Florida, 2002. Where in Florida? There's a guy from CNN here. He wants to speak with you. He won't like that. There's a press briefing every morning. Tell him where and when. Okay. Maybe now we can get a search warrant. No judge is gonna give us a search warrant with what we've got. And the weapons won't be there. -We can try. -l don't want them to stop! That's good work. You may make Detective someday. We don't have any detectives. Well... if we did. I'm sorry about your girlfriend. She wasn't my girlfriend. She was my pal. No, thank you. -You're not drinking? -l don't drink. I did, but I don't. The DA went for your plan. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna take them over to Doc Perkins and have them sterilised. The Marino family wants me to file charges against you. -lt all happened so quickly. -I'm sure. I could tell you're kind of slow to react. Bo attacked Candace's dad who responded in self-defence. Then Joe Marino jumped in and Chuck had to defend himself from both of them. I was a prosecutor in a previous life. Don't beat yourself up. It's the toughest kind of case: motiveless, random killing. It seems that serial killers only screw up when it gets personal. So, when do we go to court? This one isn't a winner for our side. I'll persuade my clients to drop it. -And if they won't? -They'll drop it. So, off the record, what really happened with Bo and his father? Pennington smacked the crap out of Bo and his old man, and I let him. -I'm shocked. -Not that shocked. It'll be our secret. Perhaps before we're through, there'll be several more. Ballistics came back on the third victim. Same as the first two. Same two guns. -Who else knows about this? -So far, just you and me. It's freezing out here. The day I left LAPD, I drove out to Santa Monica... and just looked out at the ocean. I lost my wife and my job. lt calmed me. -Are you feeling that way now? -No. I'm angry. They killed my friend. So you think it was intentional, this killing your friend? Yes. I know who did this. I know who killed Eisley, the woman in the parking lot... The guy in ther alley, and Abby... I know who killed them. -Do you have a motive? -No. -Witnesses? -No. Hell, I'll warm up a cell right now. There's two of them. And they're not gonna stop. I won't let them. So these two people, they have an interest in killing people... and now they seem to have an interest in killing you? ls this a great country or what? Jesse, you might want to be a little careful with these people. -I'm a little careful with everyone. -The hell you are. It would not be good to take this personally. I've been at this thing too long to be wrong. I'm not gonna sit around and wait for someone to find another body. You just love to make me nervous. Need a ride? He's going to see you. That sounds good. -You know what sounds even better? -What? I think he looks worried. Maybe we've been too hard on him. Human life is like the flight of that sparrow. This is Reggie. Thought you might need this. -They took a ballistics test? -Yes, we did. We sent it to Boston. Come into the living room. Brianna doesn't wanna miss you. Bri, honey, it's Jesse. I assume it's not linked to a drive-by shooting or anything. Actually, the rifle's never been fired. So much for plinking vermin. -Must have been one of your other . 22s. -No. I have no other guns. Jesse Stone. -Brianna. -Hello. What a beautiful dog you brought! Hello. What a sweet doggie. Hello, you little noodle. Actually, I've kind of adopted him. He belonged to the first victim. Well, that's awfully good of you. How sweet. -l think he likes you. -Of course he likes me. You going someplace? Well, like we said, we're only here a short time. -When do you leave? -Tomorrow night. -How's the investigation going? -Actually, not too good. I hope the victims didn't suffer too much. I wonder what it's like to know you're gonna die. Have you ever been in that position, Jesse? I'm just a small-town cop. Mostly, I give out parking tickets. It must make everything very intense. I always wondered what it was like for the shooter. That must be intense. Exercising the ultimate human power. -lf he thinks about that kind of stuff. -Do you think he does? I'm just a small-town cop. Mostly, I give out parking tickets. -Do you have any leads? -l was pinning my hopes on you. Everyone needs a hobby. Seriously, though, why would we do such a thing? A shared sickness. At least we would be sharing. Who was the last victim? A friend of mine. Abby Taylor. I read that in the paper. It must be very hard when it's someone so close to you. I'm sorry. So am I. Abigail, oh, Abigail Have you met Abigail? The queen of the tattooed ladies How is it? My mother is kind of sulky. -And your father? -Daddy's great. I never saw him fight with anybody before, for me. -You didn't try to stop it. -He was winning. Daddy boxed in college. He must have been pretty good. There's not a mark on his face. -Did you ever box? -l don't box, I fight. -What's the difference? -Rules. So, how is it at school? Sometimes Bo or Troy will stare at me when I go past. But they don't say anything. Everyone else, most of the kids, have been okay about it. Good. I want you to know I appreciate what you did for me. -Could you do me a favour? -Sure. Reggie here has got no owner, no family. I'm never home... and he really needs someone to look after him. -Could you do that? -l don't know, my mum-- I can talk to your mum about it. But you have to take care of him. -Feed him, walk him, clean up after him. -l know. I can do it. I know you can. What? I'm sorry about your friend. Thank you, Candace. -So, why Abby? -Because she was close to me. -So you think they want to kill you next? -l kind of wish they'd try. I know they're not finished. They know where you live. Why don't they lurk around your house and shoot you? They want to do something more artistic. They are crazy. I tend to forget that. I think they made a mistake. It's not random anymore. They seem to want to taunt me, see my reaction. You might want to think about being a little careful. I need evidence. You think they'll come at you the same way? Serial killers like ritual. They'll do it the same. Jesse, you're a good man and a good cop. Better than this town deserves. It matters what happens to you. The ugly truth of it, Moll, is it doesn't matter a hell of a lot to me. A lot of people love you, Jesse. -including you? -Especially me. And don't shut me off by being cute. It's hard for me not to be cute. I think Reggie will be good for Candace. That was sweet. I don't know if I thanked you enough for all that you've done for me. I mean, you did so much, and now maybe Reggie and.... Well, ljust wanted you to know that I'm your friend... and I feel really close to you. -It's Jesse Listen, I need to see you both beofre you leave. The parking lot by the canal, where Abby Taylor was killed. You know. -When? -Tonight, 10. 00. ls this official? He thinks he's setting some sort of trap. -Can he do anything? -lt doesn't matter. This just makes it easier. Now we know where he'll be. Why am I here, again? That's lovely and chivalrous of you... and I know you do it because you care about me, but it's still dreaming. -You see anything, Sult? -Nothing yet That's why I've got you, Molly. Jesse, I don't think they're coming. We'll get there as soon as we can. You got that, Suit? On our way. -l won't have a dog in my house. -This is different. -I'll take care of him. -Except for when you don't. Dad. Margaret, this means so much to her. -You know the rule. -Can't we bend the rule this time? Reggie needs a home. You know how I feel about animals in the house. He's a great dog. He's already housebroken. -I promise, I'll take care of him. -Margaret. -But I really want him. -l won't have a dog in my house. -This is different. I'll take care of him. -Except for when you don't. Candace isn't home. Pick it up. -And let you execute me? -Pick it up. I didn't shoot anybody. I may do some jail time, but no court of law will execute me. I'll outlive you, Jesse. Get up. Put the gun away, Suit, before you shoot somebody. You all right? Two guns, one shooter. Give that to Healey. What are you looking at? Jesse, are you there? I'm sorry. I want you to know that I realise I was thinking only about myself and my career. And I know I've often been that way with you. Jesse, are you there? .:*~*:._.:*~*:._.:*~*:._.:*~*:._.:*~*:.

Stop right there! Get them! You won't blow me or let me go down on you? I said not my left tit! Don't hit me, jerk! I know some chicks shave their pubic hair. But taping a tit? You're a joke! You bitch! I did everything else! I said not my left tit from the start! What the fuck! You sure you're a hooker? Die, bitch! Fucker! Myung-su, stop... Stop it. A violation of a fair trade! I paid but didn't get to shag. And check this out. - He beat the shit out of me! - Look... Look! Look! I heard you. So shut the hell up! - You wanna sue him. - Right. She wants to sue you. And he doesn't wanna pay your hospital bill. This is gonna get ugly. And I will call your wife and tell her that you beat a hooker. What? You're a Democratic officer. Protect my privacy. Come on, we're all men. I'm Republican! Hey, Chief. PARK Hyun-su, what are you doing here? What happened? Did he beat you? You... You're in worse shape. He's a twin brother of PARK Hyun-su. - A twin brother? - Yeah. Let me see. They're carbon copies. Who's an older brother? I was born 2 minutes and 17 seconds earlier. Your mom must've had a hard time. He's our new chief. Way to go, Depot Boy. You messed up again? Depot Boy? Is it like a ball boy? Or a baseball player? A pitcher or catcher? Neither. His name is Myung-su. Quite famous around here. I hear your brother got into Seoul Nat'I University. The whole town is talking about him. What college did you get into? He got expelled from middle school. You were a player, huh? - You took care of this? - Yes, we're done. You can leave now. - What? - Go on. Damn Republicans! What are you doing now? What the hell do you tape your left tit for? I told you I had a burn. It's ugly. Some pimp cut it with a knife, didn't he? By the way, you should speak honorific to me. You told me you were 25. But you're only a year older. I saw it back there. A good one year! You're an older brother by 2 minutes. 2 minutes and 17 seconds! But he never treats me like one. So Soon-hui is your real name? What hooker uses her real name? Now you know. It's so tacky they think it's an alias. It's a secret, okay? By the way, Hyun-soo is graduating tomorrow. You must feel sour. I'm not sour. I'm happy for him. Come by tomorrow. I'll give you some. Crazy bitch! Take care of yourself. Hey you! Did you see Hyun-su's face? What was that? A graduation present? Let go! What did you do with the tray? Your brother got into Seoul Nat'I University with flying colors. But you, an older brother, do nothing but fight! Come here. Knock it off! If I'd gone to high school, I could've gone to college too. Listen to yourself. Did I tell you not to? You were too busy fighting! Deliver it to the station manager. Why can't that old fart come down here and eat? Are you coming tomorrow to Hyun-su's graduation? Not coming! Isn't he quick-witted? She doesn't want me there. Why the hell ask? A letter of commendation. PARK Hyun-su. With his excellent academic achievements... - That's my son. My son! - Hereby, I award him a scholarship. Granted by Gunsan City Mayor. Hyun-su! Don't let them get to you in Seoul. Who are you? You're a law school student. At Seoul Nat'I University! Of your contemporaries, you're the king. Don't worry about money. I'll work my butt off to pay your way through college. The Bar should be a piece of cake for you. Pass it before you graduate. Forget the military duty too. I feel sorry for Myung-su, but it's for our family. Middle school drop-outs can't go to the army. But he's dying to enlist. Trust me. I can talk him into it. You can return the favor when you make it big later. What's a brother for? What? Do me a favor. Joining the army for you? No freaking problem. For the glory of our family! I owe you one. Sorry. I didn't know you'd come. If my mom finds out, she'll kill me. Leaving tomorrow? Did you all pack up? Yes. What about you? I found a room near a local college. In 4 years, you'll be a prosecutor. And I'll be a teacher at a middle school. How many times? This is the tenth. We first did it the day after the SAT. - We did? - Then every Saturday since. - Hold on. - Take it off. You love me, don't you? Shit! Look, I'm sorry. I'm not Hyun-su. I'm his brother, Myung-su. I've passed off as him to bonk a high school girl. Why couldn't that bastard go to a brothel? Goddamn horny nerd! She has kick-ass skin. Be well! Take care of yourself. Life sucks. Life? Every cloud has a silver lining. You're only 20. What do you know about life? Soon-hui. Yeah? What's your dream? Getting married. To a responsible guy like you. Why? Nothing. I just wanna see under that tape. It's that bad? Watch it, or I'll cut it off! Ahhh... It hurts! Good. Why not to the classroom? I don't want others to see. Should I help you to the classroom? It's okay. I have crutches. You can go now. Go on. Thanks. Are you okay? Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. I'm PARK Hyun-su, a junior for Law. I'm a freshman for Korean Lit. Okay. Your name? Huh? It's OH Soon-hui. What? Tacky, isn't it? They named me that so I could have a long life. Tacky, but a lot better than Soon-ja. With you, we can rule this town. Myung-su, join our gang. Shut up, asshole. This is the only and last time I'm helping you. If things get ugly later and you rat on me, I will kill you. Stop being a sissy, man. Why waste your talent on those dirty whores? It's a damn shame. There's nothing cleaner than those whores. I've heard a lot about you, Myung-su. No thug dares to touch the depot street. With that Shortypants, that's awesome. It's Smartypants, not Shortypants! Watch it, Flatfish. Be quiet, assholes! That's it. They'll learn a lesson for invading our turf. Shake a leg, assholes! You said they were A few. Quite a few! Get them! Smartypants, here! What the hell did you eat for dinner? ! Stay inside! What's all this? You'd better not know. You sure it's a gang job? Damn, you're so suspicious! If not, I'll kill you. Voila! Wow! I've learned the meaning of this Latin word. It means an immortal love. The Bar is coming up, isn't it? Yeah. Don't feel burdened. You don't have to pass it while you're in school. You remove the cast tomorrow? Yeah. I'd love for you to come. Can you make time? Your parents will be there. They'd like to meet you. I'll come then. I got the money they promised. Here. It's yours. I think he acted alone on this one. Let's go party tonight! Party my ass! This is why they put you down. If we get caught, we're dead meat, stupid. I'll pay for your noodles. Over here. You're hard to see lately. I've been busy. Who's this? Say hi, Young-hui. He's our guardian angel. Name's Myung-su. I heard you take good care of working girls here. Okay. I'm S... S... Smartypants. Why do you s... s... stutter? Dammit! I'll take you to K... K... Karaoke. It's an early present for passing the Bar. I'm taking it again next year. You didn't do well? I bet I passed it. Then what? Just passing it isn't enough. What do you mean? I'm from a poor family. To be recognized, I need to pass it with flying colors. You okay? Mr. OH, CEO of Balhae Construction, killed himself in his house Death of the third biggest construction company's CEO put the whole country in shock. Meanwhile, it's known that he'd been under investigation for violating National Security Laws. Having lived in the North until the Korean War, he contacted a North Korean embassy in Northern Yemen to track down his family still in North. Wake up, Mom! Mom, look at me! Following its CEO's death, the company was taken over by Taewoo Group. However, he claimed in his will for his daughter that he was set up as he joined a consortium led by Taewoo Group. He also claimed that the violation of National Security Laws against him was forged in an attempt to take over his company. Nobody can come to the phone. Please leave your message after the beep. It's me. Nobody can come to the phone. Please leave your message after the beep. This is Mom. I got your draft notice. We need to take care of this for your future. It's me. Mom... I can't cry. I feel like crying, but... Myung-su, do this. Please? You've always wanted to join the Marine Corps. Why chang your words. No way. I'm not joining the army for you. And I got... I got a girl. What? ! Who did you touch this time? Did you knock her up? Come on, I didn't touch anybody! I'll pay you back. "He reaps as he has sown"! Your dad was your age, and I was only 17. I was tricked into having you with his honeyed-words. Look how I turned out. He was so good in bed that I couldn't leave him. What, he lasted long? Myung-su, please do this. Your dad's last words were, "Be obedient to women." So please listen to Mom. I'll take her. I'm leaving. Consider it. Bye. Hyun-su... When you were little, your dad played favorites. He only liked you. He even made me put an egg only in your bowl. Myung-su knew it but never complained. One day I saw him chanting before a hencoop. "Do me a favor, Hen." "Lay four eggs tonight for everybody in our family." He did that all night long. He's a troublemaker but a right-minded boy. Damn! Why the hell not. Come on, smile. Say cheese. No, say butter instead. Yeah, that's it. Smile naturally. That's good. You're good. I bet you can make a career out of modeling. So cool! How much have you saved? Just debts, right? I knew it. You need to borrow money? - No. - You know I can save. I have some put aside. How much do you need? That's not it. Add this to your savings. It's yours. Go back home. What money is this? You stole it? Go home and get married. Or move to Seoul. You're pretty enough to work in Seoul. It's about time you took off. I don't have a home I grew up at an orphanage and finished high school. I wanted to stay there, looking after the younger ones. But the director raped me. So did his freaking son. That's how I ended up here. This is my home. I'm going to the army. You fucked up and are going under, aren't you? Keep it a secret. It's on behalf of Hyun-su. I don't think he passed the Bar. Don't. Why are you doing it for Hyun-su? I told you I'd always wanted to go to the military. Think I'm gone deep-sea fishing. Why does he always make you do things for him? Bastard! When is it? The notice came long ago. It's tomorrow. And you didn't tell me until now? ! Give me your right hand. You didn't tape it? My tits are different in size. Left one is bigger and prettier. No knife scar, either. Why did you tape it then? Don't laugh, okay? I really wanna... get married and have babies. But I have nothing to give to my husband-to-be. So I wanted to keep it clean for him only. You've protected me. Whoever it's gonna be... He will understand if I let you grab it once. - Victory! - Victory! You received a citation at the boot camp. Yes, Sir! First time ever in life, Sir! You're humble for a law school student. You're handsome and smart. You have it all going on. Attention! Salute! Her mom isn't here. Go easy on her. Come on, daddy Take it off. My tank-top? I mean, put on a shirt. It's too revealing. I can't study when I'm hot. I can't study when I'm turned on! - Really? - Put it on! You sure you study law? Why don't we sneak out? We're not studying anyway. You're to study alone. How could a human being read this thing? Congratulations! Attorney PARK Hyun- su - A bowl of soup, please. - Okay. God, it's my son! Are you on leave? Are you happy to see Hyun-su or Myung-su? Son of a gun! You came out of me too. I shouldn't have agreed. I'm not a marine who fights, but a marine that teaches! What do I know to teach? I think the commander is trying to set us up. I'd gobble her up if I weren't playing Hyun-su. Shut up and gobble this up! Hang in there. Hyun-su is gonna be huge. Man, haven't I missed your soup! Eat up. Why is the market so deserted? The economy is so bad. On top of that, it's the big shopping malls. They don't shop at small markets any more. And all the girls left too. There was a fire 2 months ago. Fire engines were useless. Two girls died. Poor things! Myung-su! I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you earlier. I had her ashes laid here temporarily. Good. Go get the master monk to marry our souls. Right now! Tell him I'll burn down the temple if he refuses. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Should I keep the bankbook until you get discharged? What bankbook? Soon-hui left a bankbook, and it's in your name. Find out what orphanage she is from. Young-hui said she's from one in Mokpo. Check them all out then. One more thing. Bring some boys with you Whack the director and his frigging son. You were to look after her, not to rape her! Their heads didn't crash. Do it again. Shortypants, are you playing? Do it right this time. You rats! Look, Shortypants. I wouldn't mind taking out these bitches. What about those kids? Shortypants, why don't you run this place with your gal? It's Smartypants! If only Myung-su were here... Mom finally went where Dad is. If she had waken up, I could've forgiven them. Mr. PARK Myung-su? Excuse me. Mr. PARK Myung-su? I'm Myung-su. I have your draft notice. Please sign it. - A draft notice? - Yes. But I left the Marine Corps a month ago. Go again! I'm not tutoring any more. No way. That's PARK Hyun-su. I'm looking for PARK Myung-su. Myung-su? I'm Myung-su. PARK Myung-su. ID # is 770525-1142021. That's me, but I've done the military. Even if I hadn't, I don't go. I'm a middle school drop-out. A middle school drop-out... That's no prize! Get up and deliver! I'm an ex-marine and too old for this shit. Keep it down! You aren't an ex-marine. You just came back from deep-sea fishing. And I'm still doing this at my age. Stop bumming around and take over my business. Are you nuts? I'd rather work at an orphanage under Smartypants. You can do that later. Shut up and deliver now. You only deliver to the train station and police box. Damn, my life sucks. It's quite peaceful tonight with no fuck-ups. When you're not busy, take turns eating at our place. I'm tired of delivering. - Myung-su. - What? Put your arms out. What for? Wanna cuff me or something? We got him, Sir. I got him. Quit playing. A few years ago, you hit a truck at the harbor. Didn't you? Flatfish is in the can for murder. He talked about it. We know you were just an accomplice. The prescription for burglary is 10 years, which is still far. But you'll be indicted for larceny. In that case, the prescription expires in 5 days. It feels good to have a place to go to. You know things never work out for me. Let me call my mom. Your mom? Go head. Here. It's me. Go under for 5 days. Do as I say, Shortypants! Hello? Prosecutor PARK? This is Chan- ki from Gunsan. Chan-ki! You're with the Gunsan office? You never told me you had a twin brother. Myung-su is in my office. What? Myung-su? This asshole is nothing but an obstacle in my life. Hello? Are you listening? I have to go. I have an important meeting. Yeah, that's burglary. Put him away for that. He's a skeleton in the closet for our family. He's here. Come in. Leave us. Mr. Chief Prosecutor? You know, I'm... A former chief prosecutor as of last week! Sit down. Do you know me? Sure, Congressman JUNG. A former director at NSA. How do you do? President KIM from Taewoo Group. Do you have any idea why you're here? No, Sir. You know what we're going through, don't you? Are you married? Not yet. Meet a nice girl. "Don't trust any girls, even your mother." That's true. Look at me. I had to resign over chitchat by ladies while golfing. How embarrassing! What Golf Gate? It should've been gossip. I can't believe they held hearings for that. Where are you from? From Gunsan, Sir. Gunsan... Not this coming election. But I'll help you run for the next one. Politics costs money. A lot of money. I know, Sir. Start your law firm. I was appointed as a prosecutor only 6 months ago. We want you to take our case. But I'm just a... We still have a lot to do for this country. We didn't seek you because we didn't know law or didn't have power or money. If a young capable man like you volunteers to defend us... It's a beautiful thing. You're gonna cover Culture? Well, it'll be a good break for you. I'm even considering quitting. What? Writing news articles... I feel as if I were living someone else's life. What if I become a subject of the news? What are you talking about? They're leaving. Go wait in the car. Give me the camera! Quick! PARK Hyun-su? This is it. Since you're new, it's not gonna be easy. You have a newcomer. Go easy on him. Sit down. On your knees! Chirpy! The cell leader is sleeping. Let's do this quietly. - What'd you get? - 1 year. For what? A theft. What, a shoplifting? What's going on here? A shoplifter in our cell? - It's the lowest... - Chirpy! He's sleeping. This is too much. Murder for our cell leader. Burglary for Snake. Also murder for Plane. This bitch is an infamous serial arsonist. For your information, he's my partner in bed. And I'm in for... Love! Love my ass! It's a marriage scheme! You got 7 years for it. It must be the world record. I was in love with a few simultaneously. Due to the communication problem, I had to... - Save it. - Fucking shit. What? ! When was the last time you had sex? It's been a while. Cut the crap! Try to remember and tell us everything. Let us get a woody. Try to make us come if you can. Should I get you tissue? Give it a best shot. I don't quite remember. Son of a bitch! What the hell is going on? Did we wake you, Boss? What's this? Sorry, Sir. We have a newcomer. A newcomer? Bro! Myung-su, aren't you? You... Flatfish! Forgive me, Bro. My mouth talked against my will. Kill me please! Bro! What's going on here? Damn! What's he doing here? Myung-su! My baby! Let me look at you. Hey, Hyun-su. Long time, no see. You're looking good! Look at you. You're like a noblewoman. Mom, give it. Give you what? Tofu! That keeps me from going back to jail. Myung-su, I'm sorry. You need to go back in. What are you talking about? I just got out! I know. But it's for our family. What the... She's threatening to sue him for a marriage scheme. If she does, that's it for our family. He's on a huge case. When it's over, he'll be a national figure. What's a brother for? He can get you out in a few months. You're now an ex-con. It won't make any difference. Without him, there's no you. If he's sued, there goes his marriage with the daughter of Mr. Kim, CEO of Taewoo Group. Hold on. So I don't use your name as I did for the military? She sues me and I go back there in my name? I won't! I can't! I'd do it for murder. But for a marriage scheme? No way! "Be obedient to women." I'll listen to all the girls except you. - You! - It's okay, Mom. Myung-su, please. Think of our family name. There's no way I'm going in for Love. And since when did we have a family name? You should've watched it, son of a bitch! You call your brother a SOB? What am I then, a bitch? ! You stay out of it. I'd rather jump out of the car than see you fight! Let go! I'll kill myself! Let go of me! Let go! I absolutely loved it. It was shorter though. What a boy! Myung-su? What are you doing here? That's... Who's this girl? Why are you wearing glasses? Don't tell me you impersonated me again. We're gonna be late for a seminar. Let's go. Is he your twin brother? He's a pain in the neck and an ex-con. Who pulled strings for you? It's odd you were sent to the same prison. And the same cell? How long time this ceremmony? - Am I lucky or What? - You know What? I hope this newcomer has a clean ass. Good gracious! How are you? Bro, what happened? Come on, sit down. You just got out of here. What are you back in for? M... Murder? What the hell happened? It's not murder, asshole. LOVE? ! Marriage scheme. I know you're handsome. But it takes time to attract, shag, and steal from one. You can't pull it off on such a short notice. I'll be honest. It's fraud. Getting charged with a marriage scheme isn't easy. Unless you're a lawyer, it's fraud? What a fucked-up law is that? It's bullshit! I respect you, Chirpy. You got 7 years for a marriage scheme. What'd you get? 6 months. A year for a theft and 6 months for fraud? Look, Flatfish. Are you sure he's qualified to be the cell leader? Fraud is the lowest crime. We should be beating him up. Watch your mouth, asshole! Hey! I'm sorry. Chirpy, sit up. Let me tell you a sex story. I bonked her with lights on so I could tell you guys this. It's all recorded in my head. Runtime of 53 minutes! Bless the newlyweds! I knew that son of a bitch wouldn't come. But, why isn't Mom here? PARK Myung-su, right? Eat this first. Oh, I got it. Hyun-su sent you to play with me, didn't he? God damn it! "To play with you"? Is every girl a hooker to your eyes? You're not? Fine then. Look, Jerk. Show me some respect. I'm sorry. Sorry, Ma'am. Okay? Don't want a ride? Wait, Myung-su! Myung-su! He should eat this. How did he pick up a girl while staying in jail? My name is OH Soon-hui. Soon-hui? I know it's tacky. No, that's not it. I rob banks. You're pretty and funny. That's nice. Robbing banks... isn't easy. So I need your help. Isn't it cooler than a theft or fraud? I guess so. Don't you need a gun to rob banks? Check under the seat. Be careful. It's loaded. Can you drop me off here? You're scared. Unlike your reputation as Depot Boy. Check out the file in the glove compartment. I know a lot about you and your brother, Hyun-su. You went to the military and jail on his behalf. If the press gets hold of that, what would happen? Are you... blackmailing me? Yes, I am blackmailing you. I heard you are obedient to women. I'll give you a carrot too. Am I pretty? So is my body. I'll give you some after robbing a bank. Where are we going? Hanbyul Bank I got out of jail 2 hours ago. I'm not physically ready to rob a bank. Don't worry. It's next week. We're just scouting today. Every fourth Monday, cash is delivered out of here. It's not good to be filmed by that security camera. It only reaches right before our feet. The bank closes at 4:30. 10 minutes later, a van pulls up. In front of that door. The vault is open for 10 minutes, but we have to pull it off in 2. Can't we hit a small one? I know this bank back home that carries a lot of cash. The security system is a lot less tight here. How are we gonna get in after it closes? That's why I need you. Upstairs is a VIP Center. And Hyun-su has a safe deposit box there. With his fingerprint, we can get in through that place. Stay here until it's over. I'd be better off to rape you right here than rob a bank. I'm very capable of that. You know that, don't you? If you mess with me, the file goes to the press. You'd be sharing the cell with Hyun-su. What would the paper say? "Brave Twins"? Or, "Stupid Twins"? And... What about your mom? Haven't figured out yet? You've been kidnapped. You'd be raped, not me. Use it strictly with me. You go upstairs first. At 4: 29, come downstairs through this door. Hide behind this mirror until 4:31. Then you start shooting. Fire twice into the ceiling so they won't call the cops. Are you listening? That revolver... Where did you get it? A cop is alone at the station. Walk in and fire a gas gun at him. He passes out and I grab one of the guns. That's it. Simple, isn't it? A theft of a revolver that happened 3 months ago. I did it. Damn, I'm fucked! Put it in your deposit box tomorrow. What's this? It's a document concerning our bogus firm in Singapore. Dad trusts nobody but you these days. You're our family, but not on the record. I'm gonna have to rent a few more safes soon. Can I buy this glass? What? My girlfriend and I just drank wine in this glass. She wants to keep it for a sentimental value. Soon-hui, what are you up to? Nothing illegal. You don't have to worry. We're done. Let's go. Sit down. Are you really a bank robber? Why'd I steal a gun then? I'm up to my eyeballs with card bills. I'll hit the bank and leave the country. If you're robbing a bank, why do you need photos of Hyun-su's safe then? Should I go to the press? Shut up and follow my lead. It's only a rehearsal. I'm not stupid. We can sneak into the bank, threatening security guards. Let me ask you again. It won't harm Hyun-su? And we're robbing the bank? Okay, let's go. The word 'National' makes me break out in a rash. You're so bad. Myung-su! What's wrong? What? Today is not good. We're going back. Don't chicken out now. Wait here. Let me handle this. What are you doing? Right here? Shouldn't we get the job done first? Hyun-su isn't wearing a tie. Only one person is allowed. Who cares? You can have this. My mom said it has a French name. In Korean, it means cow dung or something. It's about half a million. Put it back where it was. It doesn't matter. It's ours. Wait... What about A quickie? You're crazy! Thanks. Good day. You forgot something? Oh... It's okay. Here's the key. I took a lot of photos like you said. This was for nothing. Damn. We're done today. Let's go grab some beer. It was just a rehearsal. You're so uptight. Tell me. Say we fail to rob it. You'd still give me some, right? Why don't we do it first? Lt'll strengthen our chemistry. We'll work better. If you're horny, pick any train station. There are many brothels. Those girls are dirty though. Where's the nearest station? Pull over the car. Pull it over! Don't look down on those girls. Who do you think you are? You're robbing a bank! If you need money, be a hooker. That's more honest. SONG and JUNG plotted it. And KIM profited from it. I need more evidence to nail them all. It's time to go. Hit it. My bag! It's a snatcher! - Open the door! - What? Open the damn door! What are you doing? Let's get out of here! Let's go! It's kind of chilly. Climb over back here. We are bank robbers, not the police! Now we have to wait a month! Let's hit another one. It's a huge bank. It's impossible without an insider's help. It has to be that bank. I know it inside and out! I'm upset too. I thought I'd be eating something real delicious. Not a cup-a-noodle! We don't have a month. So let's do this. It's not gonna harm Hyun- su. And you don't have to rob a bank with me. After this, we're done. - Your face is so wrinkly. - Shut up! Sir! I forgot something. I must've left the keys in the car. I'm sorry. This tastes better dipped in soybean paste. Still pretty good. Attorney PARK Hyun- su Wow. This is cool. Hyun-su, that asshole... Our birthday? Or Mom's? Dad's memorial day? What a nice son. You sure there was nothing? Are you lying to me? All I care about at this moment is shagging you! What is it you're after? I need to take care of something before I leave this country! Who cares? He's a bastard! That is more important than my life! Nothing's more important than life. Forget about it. Let's just hit the bank. You don't know shit! Find a medium-sized bank that's easy to rob. Lend me your car for a week. Welcome, Sir. You must know better. This kind of diamond can't be imported legally. It wasn't smuggled in for sale. Bro! Smartypants! - How are you? - Good! So glad to see you! You have new shoes on. Wash Your hair. Myung-su! Over the years, they've contributed so much to our country. For the national economy. For the national order. And for the national security. They've devoted their lives. We need to recognize their contributions. They're being blamed for what they've accomplished without any physical evidence. If it's just our jealousy, we should be sorry. They still have so much to do for our country! 3 suspects of Golf Gate that had dragged on for 3 years were found not guilty in court today. The public isn't so happy with the court's decision. A former chief prosecutor, SONG, told the press that he'd run for Congress in the upcoming election. I'm happy to see some justice. This is no surprise. What are you plans now? Next news What the police had feared became reality. A revolver that had been stolen from the police station was used in a bank robbery at Hanbyul Bank in Jeonnam. According to the police, it was a thoroughly-prepared hit. Two robbers took 300 grand, all of which was cash. Their get-away vehicle was found by a playground about 5 hundred meters away from the bank. However, no clue was found. Why isn't he answering? ! There, they switched vehicles and are still on the run. The police believe they are... - Hello? - You saw TV? Get yourself ready for me. Look, Myung-su. PARK Myung-su? Hey! I gave Smartypants 100 grand. That's the rest. It was so heavy to carry. You're not ready to honor your promise. Way to go, Myung-su. You can rob that bank of all its money. It played a key role in stealing my dad's company. Stop talking nonsense. You're drunk. If you had brought me those documents, I could've sent them to jail. But it's okay. Jail won't make up for what they did. Bang! You know what I planned? I planned on killing them. But I can't do it alone. Can you help me? If you help me... I'm all yours. I knew you'd eat your words! After I kill them, I'll kill myself too. You can shag me as much as you want until I die. LEE Soon-hui and OH Soon-hui are different on one thing. LEE Soon-hui was free, and you're conditional. What's this, a bank loan? So complicated! LEE Soon-hui? I'm OH Soon-hui! I don't need your help. This is my business. Sit! I'll give you some now, okay? Hold on. I can't do this on a clear mind. Go abroad with this money. I'm going where I belong. If you wanna keep your word, come to Gunsan. Why can't Mom live with Hyun-su in Seoul? I bet she's staying here to make me deliver! Hey, Myung-su. How's your brother? I bet he's not carrying a tray on his head. Be careful. Why didn't you have your mom deliver it? Since you're here, the area is full of life. And I am not! Breaking news. Terrorism happen at National Assembly Acid from the toilet poured over Congressman JUNG. His private part... Backside of his private part! It must've messed up his asshole. Give me a toothpick. You're the police. What's so funny? It should've melted down his pecker. When he was with NSA, he was a torture expert. It's crazy that assholes like him are in our Congress. Son of a bitch! Myung-su. What kind of people vote for those dogs? Don't ask me difficult questions. That tray looks good on you. What business... If you're here to keep your promise, let's go. This looks like a good place to see the sun setting. Damn. How nice! Wow! It's so cool! Is your left one bigger than the right one? What? These! Sorry. I thought of my ex-wife. Your ex-wife? You were married? Her name was Soon-hui too. LEE Soon-hui. She always taped up one of her tits. I really wanna get married and have babies. But I have nothing to give to my husband-to-be. She was the only woman who treated me with respect. After I got discharged, I was gonna take her to an island and marry her. This place... I threw her ashes here. Right here. I heard you when you were drunk. You seem to have a story of your own. But you can't be less fortunate than her. I didn't know. There was someone who was lonelier than me. You need to learn to value credibility! You didn't wanna go to a motel so we came here. And you're drinking again? I'm sorry. But I can't do this on a clear mind. You're gonna pass out on me again? If you leave me alone again, I'll kill you. Let's see when you sober up! So much for a girl with a college degree! Now I have one down Can I do well till the end? Myung- su bluffs a lot, but he's kind of cute. Where'd he go? You should've told me earlier. I'll take care of it. You leave the country. I miss those bastards in jail. Whether in or out of jail, it's the same for me. What's this? ! Smartypants, what's wrong? Stupid ass! A former chief prosecutor, SONG was attacked at a sauna. Using a brick, the perpetrator hit his... His private part, indeed. He was carried to the ER right after the accident. The safety of Taewoo Group's CEO, also involved in Golf Gate, concerns us a great deal. He has postponed his return from overseas. Taewoo Group expanded in the past... Now it's on the verge of bankruptcy. Turn it off! He's known to be hiding in China, and... Why didn't he take me? This is so embarrassing! We're through, right? There's one thing I don't quite understand. That document was in your safe. How did it get out? Someone must've had a copy. It wasn't me. - Bastard! - Bitch! Why'd you put a glass ball in my safe? - What? - Why not cow dung? You made me lose my face over that fake. Bastard! You sold it, didn't you? Show me another one. Stop it. Blow it up for me. OH Soon-hui? ! Hello? Why? What'd Myung-su do this time? He's not just impersonating me. He's trying to ruin me. - What do you mean? - None of your business We have to find him before he really messes up. He goes to Seoul often lately. He said he rented a place by this college. - Doesn't He have A phone? - No. Take care of Myung- su. He went through a lot for you. He's your older brother after all. By 2 minutes and 17 seconds? They should've pulled me out before him! I told him to take photos of Hyun- su's safe. It was rather easy to talk him into it. He does listen to girls. When I'm with him, I feel comfortable. And simple too. What should I do with this money? What the hell! I'll give it to Hyun-su. I'll end the show with style. The police? I stole the revolver. And I whacked JUNG and SONG. So I'm turning myself in. No, it's okay. I'll come to you. Will they put me in Flatfish's cell again? Should I ask Hyun-su to pull strings? Why do I suddenly feel like Mom's soup? This is PARK Myung-su who called earlier. With all due respect, I have this thing that just came up. Can I turn myself in tomorrow? Trust me I will. It's just one more day. Yeah, I should say goodbye to Mom. This time I'll be gone for a long time. You're dead once I catch you. Excuse me. - You recognize me? - Sure, from Apt 501. You left your keys with me, saying you were going away. I changed my plans. Your keys. Thanks. Wait! Your car keys too! You're so forgetful. - Excuse me. - Hi. Sit at the table. I'm Myung-su's friend. Did he tell you he was an attorney? No. There he is! Money! Myung-su, you bastard! Bull shit! You're way too pretty to like that thing. Myung-su has been good since he was little. He always yielded to his brother. The police are in pursuit for a suspect responsible for the bank robbery and a series of terrorist attacks. His name is PARK Myung- su from Gunsan. - Myung-su? ! - After calling the police that he would turn himself in... He finally messed up big time! We're going to the air for coverage. The suspect's car is now on a free way, which makes the pursuit more dangerous. He was spotted by his apartment earlier this afternoon. Myung-su! Myung-su... Smoke is pouring out of the car, and the suspect seems trapped inside. Where's everybody? Is there a soccer match against Japan tonight? You haven't gone abroad yet? Bastard! If Myung-su dies, it's your fault! I AM Myung-su. Are you finally giving some when sober? You fool! I didn't steal that revolver. You can't take the rap for it! What are you talking about? I bought that piece for $5000 in the black market. What? You weren't a bank robber? You get it? Do as I told you. I really have to go abroad now. You want me dead? I... You made me wanna live again. There's one thing I lied to you about. That bank robbery... I didn't do it. What do you mean? When I went to take photos of his deposit box, there was a glass ball in it. So I took it with me. If I redesign this, I can triple the price. At least $1.5 million. You buy it from me for 500 grand in cash. And make me a fake one exactly like this. I can't believe this! Then I went to Mokpo. I was gonna give you the money, saying I robbed a bank. But while I was there, an actual bank robbery happened. Those bank robbers took only 300 grand. So I couldn't give you all. I gave 100 grand to the orphanage and 200 grand to you. Hyun-su was getting too greedy. It would've been his money. You completely fooled me? I'm still a bank robber. I bet I'm the only robber who stole from a VIP Center. His lungs are filled with toxic gas. When can he talk? Lt'll take a few weeks. PARK Myung-su, you really are something. The court will give you a break. Take care of yourself. Myung-su, they're saying you're Robin Hood. People are lined up outside to see you. They sent you flowers and money. And everybody back home is praising you. Myung-su... I always put Hyun-su before you. I forced you to sacrifice. Do you remember? Back in middle school, Hyun-su always topped. So this Congressman's son got jealous. And he set Hyun-su up with punks. You went instead and the fight got serious. So you got expelled. I don't think Hyun-su has any idea. Hadn't you gotten expelled, you could've gone to college and become something. Mom is so sorry. It's me. Can you hear me? Everybody is taking you for Myung-su. Let's keep it that way for the time being. We're gonna skip town. Go aboard for a few years. I'm Myung-su. And you're Hyun-su. Let me... Let me be you for a change. All I wanted was to get off depot area. The smell of Mom's soup disgusted me. Can you understand me? Feeling frigging sour about Hyun-su? Watch your language. I'm trying to scoop to your level. I got you a present. Where did you get these? I bought them, of course. You know what? A small diamond is put inside the band. It finally found its owner. In fact, Hyun-su... Put it on. Let me put it on you. PARK Hyun- su Law Firm Pro-bono Legal Service Twins Soup You're so pretty, Myung-soon and Hyun-soon. Happy to see Daddy? Honey. This is Hyun-soon, and this is Myung-soon. You still can't tell? Hey, Mrs. LEE! You went to Karaoke last night with that old station manager? How could you do that behind my back? The lady from fruit store was there too. And what do you care wherever I go? His thing has gone limp. I saw it with my own eyes at a sauna. He said the same thing about you. He did? That old fart! Want to check it out? Mine is still fresh! That old bastard! I should take him to a sauna and... To the third floor. Damn, he pisses me off! PARK Hyun-su! Get down here and eat! Bring it up here. I have so many clients. What? Clie... I should be working while eating. Clie... Whatever! Should I go then? I'm not sick but I'm not well ...And I'm so hot Cos I'm in he-ell... 'Yeah, fuck you. 'Shit. Five hours on Blitzkreig. 'This isn't how it was meant to be. Week's holiday? 'I was gonna get to grips with the Roman Republic. 'Get into the GI diet. 'Can't stop now - gotta win the war for the Nazis. 'Am I enjoying this? 'Don't know any more. Doesn't matter. 'Gotta finish the level. 'Then read those, do some sit-ups, learn the clarinet.' OK, bye. That was your sister. She'll be here in an hour. My sister? Yes, your sister. She's coming to stay, remember. I left you a message. Do you mean the pizza coupon with "sis mesg?" written with a burnt match? Yeah, she rang a couple of nights ago. She's broken up with her husband. What! Hold on. Sarah's broken up with Simon? That's terrible. 'Never get my iPod speakers back now. 'Still, on the bright side, the base response was pretty awful.' So, Sarah, great to see you. We haven't had a proper chat in ages. I've been chomping at the bit. All this crap with Simon's brought up so much stuff for me. Really. You seen they have jumbo cashews now? Yeah, I think we're overdue for a big chat, aren't we? Spill some home truths? Yeah. Course, I was happy enough with the normal size. But nothing lasts. All the shit that went on at Grange Terrace before the move, get it all out, cos it's so hard when you're trying to work through this family stuff on your own, isn't it? 'Why do the people who want to talk about things always win? 'Why can't the people who don't want to talk about things win? ' It's great getting everything out in the open. I think so, but a lot of men don't see it that way. They're just not comfortable talking about emotions. I think it's different when you're a musician. You're a musician? Yeah, I'm a musician. I really think that music really opens you up emotionally. A lot of musicians like me feel that way. I think that's great. 'Oh, my God, he's doing it. 'His routine. He's doing his routine on my sister! ' Yeah. Mark's not too musical. He bought a clarinet but he uses it to hit a cymbal. 'She's laughing. 'She's laughing at his jokes! ' Yes, great, Jeremy, getting everything out in the open. Have you told Sarah how you've got chlamydia and you're still in love with Big Suze? It was a visa marriage, it's symptomless and it's a platonic love, as you might have for a dog or a sandwich. Be back in two ticks. I see you. I know what you're doing. - What? - You're gonna try and sleep with her. I can see it in your eyes. Look, Mark, she's your sister. I know that. Yeah? Promise me you'll not try to sleep with her. I promise I will try not to sleep with her. So, you slept with her. You promised! I promised to try not to. Yeah, well you didn't try very hard, did you! Mark, I tried incredibly hard. It just turns out it was impossible not to. Morning, Mark. Hey, honey, I called Frank about the clerking job. Should be fine for you to fill-in. Come in 10ish. Cool, thanks. 'They're rubbing it in. It's like I've apply for a leave and take you there. I promise. Deal. Deal. See you, thank you. Go now. Go. Auntie. Don't go, auntie. Please don't go, please don't leave me, I know you won't come back. Angel, be good, I will be back. Auntie, don't go. Angel, be good. What a tragedy. Shut your mouth. Angel, good girl, don't cry, I will come back to see you. I will visit and play with you. You won't come back, you are cheating me. Don't cry, be good. Angel, go with your dad. No. I've lost mom, I can't lose you. Anna, please apply a leave for me, I will go back few days later. No problem, I will help you. Two of a kind. Cut the crap, go now. Fantastic, we may go back. I will cook you a great dinner tonight, go. Take care. I know it. The headlines tonight - Portillo's teeth removed to boost pound... exploded cardinal preaches sermon from fish tank... and where now for man raised by puffins? Yes! On "The Day Today" tonight - woman describes her parrot's kidnap hell... She told me that a very heavy officer sat on her back, others sat on her legs, she was then handcuffed and broad Sellotape taped round her ankles so she couldn't walk. ...and new Welsh minister in incomprehensible energy outburst. The main benefit is that it is competitive. It permits the production of electricity cheaper, competitive, and hence enhance the competitiveness of British industry. Good evening. Junior Minister for Health Mr Douglas Wemby has resigned today following revelations of irregular accounting and racist dances at his constituency. Reporting from Westminster, Hellwyn Ballard reports. Mr Wemby's resignation could spell trouble for John Major's government, trouble it could do without. I'm joined by our political correspondent Collin Haye. A bad day for the government? The government needed a shot in the arm. What it received was a bullet in the throat. I'm joined by Tory Chairman for Resignation Issues Mr Austen Straker. - A bad day for the government? - The media overblows these things. Mr Wemby's acted entirely with honour. Minister, thank you. Hellwyn. - Collin. Chris. - Hellwyn. - Chris. - Hellwyn. Mr Wemby's week of hell ended at 11.3o this morning when his resignation was accepted by Mr Major. He walked out of his office for the last time and left Westminster by car... (ENGINE STARTS) ...to meet family and constituents at his house in Gloucestershire where he hopes to spend more time cultivating his hobbies. He is a keen cook and is fond of collecting stamps. Sylvester Stuart has today's weather. Starting in the south-east - Devon and Cornwall should have heavy, prolonged showers, like jagged metal piercing old flesh. The Midlands now. Warm at first, turning cocky later, around 12, with cloud around in the shape of a whore. In Scotland, thunderstorms, but the sun should come through later. It'll be like being woken up in the night by strange men shining torches in your eyes. In summary, then - dispassionate. And that's all the weather. Alan Partridge is at Marple for the races. I wonder what he's doing? - Alan? - Hi, Chris. I'm Alan Partridge. Horses, love 'em or hate 'em, from Mr Ed to Silver, they're all here mingling with officials. Don't do that, please. It's the 6.3o Queen Henry Stakes, which is generally regarded as the litmus test for Derby form. Jockey folklore says that if you cock up the Queen Henry, you might as well ride the Derby on a cow... which would be a waste of time. Let's have a look at the betting, the going today moist to tricky. That's all for now. Join us later for the race. Back to you, Chris. - Alan, have you got a tip for us? - I did, but... I was going to tip New Year's Lad, but his horsebox was hit by a Volvo. Terrible mess. Apparently, he's... he's dead. So... bad luck there. Back to you, Chris. Stop it! That's a coincidence, because last week, Collately Sisters, you survived a car crash. - Only because you landed in a stomach. - It was a cowy night for the pound. It stood at 3.79 against the German bordello, up.5 against the Portuguese starling and down 1oo against the bitch. Earlier, there was confusion when France and Spain swapped currencies, and trading remained succulent for the rest of the day. Thanks, Chris. Here at home tomorrow, the new £5 note comes into circulation. The notes, featuring the head of Iggy Pop, can only be used once. Thanks, Collately. Coming up - Bosnian old woman... controversy over new police shirts... It's blatantly too small. I mean... That wouldn't fit my daughter. ...and your opinions in "Speak Your Brains". - Firing public servants. Do you approve? - I agree. - In all circumstances? - Yes. Yes. - So once they've made a mistake... - No, give them one chance. - Then fire them. Heavily? - Heavily, yes. - Who would you fire them at? - Their governors. - You'd fire them at their governors? - Definitely. Yeah. (ALAN) The 6.30 delayed due to a collapsed paddock. They're sorting that out. Men and women here wandering around like ants on an anthill. Good to see Platitude Queen, a renowned... horse, well known for its sense of humour. Look at that wiggle. Marvellousl Don't know what that is... Two to look out for - Number 1, Zeinab Badawi's Twenty Hotels and Number 3, Two Headed Sex Beast. Great to see the deaf catered for by these real characters in anoraks. Couple of youngsters fooling around. Let's hope that tomfoolery doesn't escalate into blind, ugly violence, which none of us want to see. Two fat ladies - 88I Old bingo expression there. Although, these ladies, I'm sure, are not the kind who you'd find at the bingo hall. They're altogether a better class of fat lady. Look at that lovely girl there, chomping on a sandwich. Ah... Not sure what that is. (LAUGHS) Hope it's not a dead horsel They won't fit it in the back of a Volvo 340. Actually, I hope it isn't a dead horse. Sorry. "The Day Today" - bagpiping fact into newsl American actor Marlon Brando was sold today in an auction at Sotheby's. Brando, who starred in "Apocalypse Now" and "Superman", was part of a sale of works of art which attracted international interest. He was sold in the chair he's occupied for three years to the Vatican at just under two and a quarter million dollars. He will be installed in St Peter's later next month. Dentists. Time was when dental care... was free. Now costs are forcing people with sick mouths onto the streets. Last night, I went with a team to there. Soaring costs have forced dentists to use telephone boxes as reception areas and the backstreets as their chair. It's daylight, and the streets look quite normal, but when night draws in, like a great dark thing, this area becomes the stalking ground for dentists. Up to 150 practitioners can operate under this bridge in any one night. We saw seven, all after one mouth. (MAN) My wisdom at the back... (DENTIST) Turn round. Just pretend you're yawning and open your mouth. You need that out. Molar needs doing as well. Need any dental work done? Fillings, hygiene, root canals? 25 quid. - 2o. - Done. For three years, Hambel has worked alone without equipment or basic surfaces. I used to do a wet polish with my tongue, and... I used to blow on their faces to keep them cool, because there was no anaesthetic. Without anaesthetic, it must have been hard to stop people screaming. - How did you do that? - I'd hold their throats. - Can you show me? - What? On you? I'd press their windpipe. (GROANS) Night-time, with the police's undercover social unit. Kids see these, they get big ideas. They think, "Oh, that's cool." They all want to be Clint Eastwood. Here we go. Our old friend Mr Drill. - That doesn't look like a dental drill. - It's not. There's two. Both masonry drills. - Was that used for dental treatment? - There's traces of enamel here. Oi! A backstreet dentist and his client. We chased and filmed at the same time. He's gone that way! The dentist managed to escape on a nearby yacht, but the dentee was less fortunate. - (OFFICER) Look at that... - How do you feel? (MUMBLES) Slightly disorientated, obviously. (OFFICER) OK, what's wrong with the NHS? I had to wait three weeks for an appointment! He's made a pig's ear of your face. I've used an illegal dentist. It's hardly a criminal offence... - It IS a criminal offence. - It's not. - It is. - Is it? The next night, our dentist was back at work. Proof if proof be need be that it'll take more than a big syringe to cure Britain's mouth. "The Day Today" - aware that while the world looks round, it is, in fact, a cube. And from this, we know that fact times importance equals newsl Coming up - controversy over new police shirts... Obviously, we're ready to comply with changes if they're for the better, but... this clearly is not going to work. First Alan Partridge for the delayed 6.3o at Marple. Alan, it's raining its arse off out there. Hi, Chris, no racing yet. Some problems with the weather. It's really quite wet here. Really is quite wet. It's horrible. Really awful. Back to you in the studio. Your complaints. - Hello, peasant. - How do you do? Read this complaint which you've just written. - I shall indeed. - Grasp the candle. - Sorry? - And bang on. And bang on. I would like to complain about the slack monitoring of broadcasters' mouths. As a recruitment officer, I know it is simple when appointing staff to filter out those with unusual or disgusting mouths at the interview stage. Yet our screens are plagued with the likes of Gavin Esler, whose mouth not only looks like it is trying to escape from his face, but is grotesquely lopsided. A balanced view from that? In a chimp's cock. Surely it is time for the BBC to face up to this demoralising assault and sack anyone... whose mouth does not conform to a reasonable standard. Perhaps mine. Point at mouth. Regular, neat, and I've had the stretch marks dealt with. Do it or I'll ram you up your own... fudge tunnels. Thank you. Ask anyone what they think of Britain's public buildings and they'll probably say, "They're rubbish." So "The Day Today" has commissioned a fly-on-the-wall documentary series about every single one of them, starting this week with St Lamb's pool in Acton. Hi. Can we have two, please? One adult and a child. - How much is that? - 85. 85? Thanks. No, it's not for the phones. Just two for the pool. Well... I haven't got the exact money. It's only... - Just... keep the change. - No, I can't. Well... I haven't got the exact money. It's only a pound. I can't. I don't have the authority to just give you 25 pence. - I'd have too much in the till. - Just give me two tickets. I'll keep the pound, but I can't let you in. Line up along here, please... (ALL SHOUT) No duck... Michael! No ducking! Stephanie! Stephanie! Leave her hair alone! I've tol... Right! All down this end! All down... Right, free swim! Free swim! - (FRENCH ACCENT) Er... One swimming... - Swi? - Er... Swimming... - Sorry, I don't know... What do you want? (SPEAKS FRENCH) What? Swimming. I, er... I go... (SPEAKS FRENCH) You go what? No! No! No! No, not the floats! No! No, they're not for us! Not the fl! No! Put them back! Put them all back! Excuse me, I wonder if you could help. I've lost my locker key. Do you have a spare? - No, we don't give out spares. - It's 2o7, the locker number. Well, you'd better look for it. - Haven't you got a master? - I can't give you a master key. It'll be in the pool. Go and look for it. OK. (MUTTERS) Look, I've got to go back to the office, so if you could just give me a master key... I haven't got the authority. We need a £1o deposit. - Look, my money is in the locker. - I can't help you. - Give me a key! - I don't have the authority... - GIVE ME A KEY! - You'd better get off to your office. (CHILDREN LAUGH AND SHOUT) "The Day Today" - game warden to the events rhino. Coming up, microtometercandyhell. First a look at programmes tonight on BBC2.

On the panel, Virginia Bottomley, Tony Banks, Sir William Rees-Mogg and Nik Kershaw. And then at 11. 15, it's "The Day Today" special, "Camfam". The Hall family of Lincoln have agreed to have cameras implanted into their faces to give us a unique view of family life. Oscar! Oscar! What is the golden rule? What is the golden rule? You know what it is - don't touch Daddy's car. Turn it off. - Mum said I could. - Mum said you could? - Roy! Roy! - Did you tell him he could touch the car? - No, I didn't. - You little liar! - Roy, Roy! Calm down! - I am calm! Don't you... - Get out the car! - Roy, stop it! Roy! Christ! After that, a "Day Today" information special from Conor Hammil. Hey! Look at me! I'm driving my sports car. Going at 5o, 6o, 7o! The wind's in my hair... 8o! Look. A bend. Who cares? 9o! Get out of my way, you squares! I'm doing 1oo 'cause it's cool to drive fast. Of course it's cool. Just one question... Is this cool? Is this cool? Is this cool? Is this cool? Is this cool? Is that cool? All these people, are they cool? Is this cool? This guy... Cool, is he? This guy, is he cool? This woman, is she cool? So, what about me? Do I look cool? Well, do I? Do I look cool? Do I really look cool? Do I? Do I? Do I? ! Yes or no? Find out tonight on BBC2. Coming up - 500 more uncles laid off in Derbyshire... My nieces and nephews called me this morning and said, "Sorry, but we have to let you go." ...and controversy over new police shirts. We've been issued with these new shirts, and I and many officers feel they're too small. A week of foul-tempered debate ended this afternoon as finance ministers agreed new quota rates with the United States. In Brussels is Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan. Peter, what is the new rate? It's 3o per cent. Agreement was a long time coming, but the decision was unanimous. The Germans were holding out for 4o per cent. That's right. When I spoke to Finance Minister Reinhardt today, he said he didn't like it, but he'd go along with it. You spoke to him? He's a tricky man, isn't he? That's right. He was in the hotel. You conducted a conversation about the quota rates? Yes. He said he didn't like it, but he'd go along with it. What language did you conduct this conversation in, Peter? German. - You spoke to him about the deal in German? - Yes. - So, what's German for "3o per cent"? - Trenter per center. - Dreißig Prozent? - Yes. That quote, " I don't like it, but I'll go along with it"? - That's what he said. - How did he say it? - "I don't like it, but I'll along with it." - In German, how did he say it? "Ich nichten lichten..." Presumably you mean... (SPEAKS GERMAN) - Yes. - No, you don't, Peter, because that means "Get me a taxi, I'm late for my plane!" Now, did you speak to the German finance minister? - No. - And what was his reaction? - I don't know. - Peter, thank you. "Enviromation", from me, Rosy May. The vast arm protruding from the South Pole is continuing to grow. All fingers have now fully emerged, along with sections of the wrist. An international conference will be held to discuss the arm, now over a mile high. Another pasta slick has washed up in Devon, threatening gulls, terns and starfish. These birds were among over 1,000 found drenched in linguini near Exmouth today. Several basking sharks are also believed to have become clogged up. I'm Rosy May and I'm sitting on your sphere. Back to today's races. Alan Partridge is at the, erm... It's his bed, let him lie in it. I'm Alan Partridge. You're at Marple with me. Just a quick look at the betting. The 6.3o has a 5o-minute delay due to a fight near the paddocks between two officials, one of them now hospitalised, but... I have with me the winner of the last race. Come here! Mickey Doolan. How are you? - I'm very well. - Are you? Now, how do you feel? You won the last race. How do you feel? Well, I'm very pleased. It was hard. I won by a nose... And your mum and dad must be pleased. Don't they think you're missing schoolwork? - Well, I'm a bit old for that. I'm 33... - What? ! - That's right. I'm 33. - You're 33? ! - That's right. - But I thought you... You look about 14! I'll take that as a compliment, you know? - Are you really 33 years old? - 33. That's right. My God! Well... All the others, are they like? Are they sort of? - They're not children? - Well, age varies from about 18 to 42. - But you're so small! - That's the idea. If I was any bigger, I wouldn't have won the race. Right. That's why Brian Blessed never rides horses. Makes sense. Right. Well, thanks very much, Mickey Doolan. Mickey Doolan here at Marple. Raining!

The work of Bob Dylan is to be reappraised following the discovery of a film which shows several of his songs, including "Subterranean Homesick Blues", being sung as long ago as 1947 by the singer-songwriter George Formby. # Oh, look out, kid, you're gonna get hit # By losers, cheaters, six-time users hang around the theatres # Girl by the whirlpool's lookin' for a new fool # Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters # Ha-hey! # Dylan, in hospital after eating rotten wool, has been unavailable for comment.

American rapping now. American rapper Fur Q is in trouble over his song "Uzi Lover". During the stage version in the live show, he kills five people on the stage during the show, live, as it's performed. # Cop! Bitch! Cop, bitch, mother!" # Uzi lover # She's an Uzi lover... # I set them on fire with petroleum, and then after about half a minute, um... put a gun in each one's face and pull the trigger. The whole controversy is preposterous. These killings are obviously ironic. # Uzi like a metal dick in my hand # Magazine like a big testicle gland # Bitch wanna try it, I said, "Keep her quiet" # Shove it up her mother... ass and fry it... # You gotta kill people to have respect for people.

"Arafat ablaze in kerosene oyster hell" in the "Telegraph". "Today" - "Peter Collins is not a man."

That's "The Day Today" on the day we asked, "Are these the real Birmingham bombers?" Goodnight. Whatever it is, something suddenly got him singing. If our new equipment would ever arrive, - we might have a better chance to see the little creature. Attention, master Jason Bates. Request you report to Commander Lucas on the bridge immediately. According to this, you've had the ant boat out five times this week. Are you aware of this? Just fishing. Scouting around the reef. Using my own free time. Did you sign off properly? You can't do all that paperwork every time you want to go out for a little spin. These aren't private pleasure craft. You're abusing a privilege. - You're off the roster for a week. - But ... - There's another thing ... - Excuse me, sir. There's an unscheduled helicopter approaching. (Helicopter engine noise) Move it, Lambert! I want to talk to Commander Lucas. Sorry, sir. Without authorized landing permits – There's the paper work. I'll sort it out with the Commander. Let's go! -I see we're to give you full cooperation. - Much appreciated, mate. Your department chief and I go back a long way. He helped me build my company into the biggest leisure conglomeration in the north. What exactly is the survey for? - We're proposing ... -All set to go just as soon as we find exactly the right spot ... - for the most advanced recreational facility in the tropics. - Talking about a tourist resort. That's what we need up here. -It's off the beaten track, isn't it? - Get it first. That's my motto. And all this publicity about ORCA has brought world attention to this area. We're looking at this crop of islands but – that one in particular. My pilot's gonna drop us in for 24 hours while I make a personal inspection and if I like what I see, I'll start negotiations to buy. So, other than supplies – how can we assist you? Well, we could use a guide. Someone who knew the area. They'd need to be standing by in the morning. - I know it. I was just scouting the reef just the other day. I'll go with them. - Jason – - Come on, mum. It'll be just like going on a camping trip. I can't get into any trouble. Trust me. They're talking about Neri's island! I can't let them go alone. - At least this way I can try and keep them away from her. - She'll freak! - You promised, no people. - You got a better idea? - Can't we just go over there and warn her? - No way! Lucas has banned me from the boats, remember? All we have to do is wait 'til tomorrow. Hopefully she keeps her cool. - Look! - who? It's the new guy on board. His name's Billy. Isn't he gorgeous? Oh, god, he's coming over. He's noticed me. I don't get it. What's wrong with me? Paradise, Jason. That's what people want today. The garden of eden – but with room service. And if that island lives up to its promise, we'll have a five-star hotel within the year. Gentlemen. Your helicopter's been refueled and loaded. Let's get moving. Time's wasting. - Fix the Commander up with whatever we owe. - Oh, yes. That won't be necessary. The first'll show you topside. Now, I'll be expecting you back with the boy around this time tomorrow morning. Excuse me. Mm hmm. Fetch my bag. Here, I'll give you a hand. I've got it! - Don't give it to me. - I know what's wrong with me. Listen – "nothing turns heads faster than the sight of a healthy golden tan." Well, look! We've been down here so long, I've practically gone white. "For that glowing skin that guys will really notice, get bingham's indoor tanning cream. Available in the large tube for only – can anyone lend me $39.95? - Get real! - It's only 'til the end of the month. I get my allowance, then. But I need this stuff now. Please! Listen. If you really think that anyone's gonna part with that kind of money – just so you can impress some boy - you're even sillier than you look. - Thanks very much – I don't think. Jodie – oh, don't worry about her. She'll be over it in five minutes. Hey, you left I'm sure I had it just a minute ago. I must've dropped it down in the galley. You won't need money where we're going. You can collect it on your way back. It can't have gone far. We'll track it down by then. Come on! Time's wasting! - Jase – good luck. - Thanks, Brett. Wait! Wait! You are going to town with the mail run this morning. Aren't you? - Well, yes, but – - Oh, please – bingham's tanning cream? They say you can buy it at any chemist. Oh, please, I'll be really grateful. All right. Thanks. (Helicopter engine noise) What did I tell you? . Paradise! Get over here Hey, Jason, get a move on. - What are you looking for? - Nothing. But it's gonna be hard to cut inland through the forest. That will not be necessary. Because we – are going by boat. You know, this would be a great spot for an adventure playground. Waterslides, that sort of thing. - Excuse me. Excuse me! - huh - I – need to go to the bushes for – - yeah, yeah Don't be long. Don't be too long! Ah, nature. Neri. You promise you tell no one! Now you bring people here. Neri, calm down. I couldn't stop them so I came along to try to help you. - Who are these people? - Developers. People with money who want to buy things – like this island. Hey! Jason! I gotta go now. We'll talk again as soon as I can. In the meantime, just stay out of sight. Someone Is hiding something. We have scoured every inch of the galley. And there is no sign at all of the wallet. So, I'm afraid there's only one conclusion that can be made. Someone has taken it. And anyone in the vicinity at breakfast has to be considered under suspicion. Not fair. - How come? - There was only a limited opportunity and you were all there at the time. I'm willing to accept this was some kind of misguided prank so I'll make a deal. If the wallet's returned by 1800 intact, we'll let the matter rest there. What if it isn't, dad? The innocent will suffer with the guilty. Because the shore leave this group has coming up – will be cancelled. I thought so. I had a hunch it was you. I didn't mean to, Vanessa. Honest. I don't know what came over me. It was just a stupid thing. On the spur of the moment. I don't think Commander Lucas will see it that way. I only wanted $40 and there were hundreds in here. I figured I would've got that much for a reward anyway. So you just took it. I always meant to put it back. I swear. As soon as I got my next allowance. And then I was gonna hand it in. Well, it's a bit late for that now. You've only got until 1800. What am I gonna do? How can I come up with $40 by then? - I could lend it to you. - Really? I've got some cash in my cabin. You could leave the wallet where it'll be found. And no one would be the wiser. Vanessa – I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Don't forget. You owe me a big favour for this. (Squawking) Why don't we try back the other way? - Nonsense, Jason. This is the perfect spot for the central hotel complex and golf course. I just gotta get these trees sorted out. And I don't trust the water. A little chlorination will fix that. It just needs lighting up a tad. - What – did you hear something? - Yeah. It was a Dingy bird. Dingy bird? Sounds sorta like a sneeze, doesn't it. I think it's time for afternoon tea. - Let's head back to camp. - Okay, you go on ahead. I've got something in my shoe. - What is hotel? - Where people live when they're not at home. - And what is golf? - People hit balls with long sticks and try to put them into holes in the ground. - Why? - It doesn't matter! What's important is the stuff they're talking about is going to bring thousands of them here. My island. It won't be for much longer if they keep on thinking it's paradise. Now, listen. I've got an idea. The only way to get rid of them is to convince them that it's not as beautiful as they think. It's up to you – but I say we don't give up without a fight. Oh! Is it safe to come out? Come on! They've all gone now. Maybe they're just waiting to attack again. We'll have to do something about those vicious little brutes – even if it means even if it means fumigating the whole island. Even if that were possible, that would cost ... - What is it? - I saw a hand! A human hand. You know, I heard a story once that a ship went down on the [] survivors made it back to this island - but one by one they disappeared and were never seen again. - Fairy tales. It'll take more than that to scare me off. (Hissing) There's a snake in there. - One of you get it out. - Not me. No way. Why don't you do it? Well, I would. I'd rather sleep out under the stars. We don't really need a tent tonight. I'd rather sleep in one of those soft bunks back on ORCA. - Is that all? For $40? - 'Fraid so. But they did say you only need to use a very little bit at a time. Well, aren't you going to try it out? Yeah. Thanks. Thanks very much. After all that, they found the wallet in some lift! Well, at least we got our shore leave back. Why do these things always happen to me? Probably because you're silly enough to believe the advertisements in the first place. - I've been an idiot, haven't I? - Yeah. Well, you would've been in a worse mess if I hadn't loaned you that money.. Which reminds me – you owe me a favour It's not much. Look. Those Bates boys aren't going to say a word of what they're up to when I'm around. But they're not gonna be so careful in front of you. So just tell me anything you might hear. - But that'd be like spying. - yeah, wouldn't it? I'm sorry, but I can't do that, Vanessa. Don't you forget something! You're a thief and I know it. But no one else will – as long as you do what you're asked. Like it or not, you're on my side now, Jodie. (Howling whistle) Lambert! Wake up. Kid's disappeared. The boy's gone! Wake up, you fool. We can't afford to lose him. Think of the publicity. - Argh! Get me outta here! - they still come - How do you know? I know. Follow. I don't care about the kid! I'm getting outta here! I just wanna get off this stinking hell hole and never come back! And I couldn't agree more! But what are we gonna tell them about the kid! - There are some very strange people in your world. - You can say that. My father never told me about men like these. Perhaps he did not know all about the outsiders. - Perhaps it is time I found out for myself. - What do you mean? Maybe it is time I saw your world. Forget it, Neri! Just stay here where you're supposed to. It's much safer that way. I've gotta go. I'll see ya as soon as I can get back. We'll just have to tell them the truth. That he was taken by a croc! Look. - Where have you been? - Thank goodness you're all right. Don't know. It's real weird. I woke up in the forest. Must've sleep walked. Here! Here! Get us out of here! - You've never sleep walked in your life - Yeah, that's what Mom said too, had a bit of trouble convincing her and Lucas. But I think they're glad to see the back of those two. Yeah, well at least we got rid of them. Yeah, for now, but I think there will be others along. [missing line] [missing line] Oh! Look at this guy. - Andrushki. - Oh! - How are you? - Oh, there's Wal. - Hi, Wal. - Weren't we going to rehearse at 5:00? I think it was 5:15. Is, uh - Mmm. What is this? - It's a knish. - Mmm. There he is. Wally! - Hi. Hi. Great to see you. - Hello. André, this is Mrs. Chao. - Uh, we met last summer in Berlin. - How do you do? Do you mind if she comes to our rehearsal today? Oh, I'd be delighted. I love to have people visit. In fact, you've come on a great day because we're gonna be running through the entire play. That's wonderful. This is my friend Flip Innunu. You know, Mrs. Chao was explaining to me... her grandfather actually translated Chekhov into Bengali. That was a long time ago. My God! You know, I've never seen Uncle Vanya. Really? Well, it's certainly, uh - - What part does André play? - Oh, uh, he's the director. - Positive. Hi, Phoebe. Nice to see you. I want you to meet my cousin's niece, Tucker, from Toledo. - Oh, how nice to have you. - What an amazing place! When was it built? Well, I think around the turn of the century. It's been abandoned for years. We're just squatting here really. And we can't use the stage 'cause the ropes, obviously... have been eaten by, uh, rats. - I've lost it. Larry, you've been losing it for 25 years, for as long as I've known you. - Hi, Jer. Hi, there. Hey, André. How you doin'? I like these, uh, squirrels. And the faces are actually from Shakespeare's plays, or that's what they say. God, I am just exhausted today. I, uh, didn't get any sleep at all last night. You know, the Ziegfeld Follies were done here. There used to be, uh, dressing rooms here... that could accommodate 500 actors. Now, it's a little dangerous because it's been raining through the ceiling... and those nets are there to catch the plaster that's coming down. - Watch your step, Phoebe. - I'm all right. But you look tired. Yeah, well, I haven't had time to catch my breath. You see, I'm doing these two other plays. They keep calling me for extra rehearsals. I was up at 6:00 this morning learning lines for the rewrites... on the play I'm doing over at the Hearts and Minds Café. - I've never heard of that theater. - No reason you should've. Thanks, Liz. - So, what I'm doing in the first act is okay? - Well, how does it feel? Just very uncomfortable. Well, that's the whole point. Okay. - Did you go swimming today? - I'm gonna go tonight. - If I don't swim, I don't move. - Here, come on with me. - Like the body just - - I'm gonna get a cup of coffee. - Under water, my hair turns green. - my own mother? - Your mother. - My mother, she was so difficult... and she was literally driving me so nuts. It's all crumbling, but it's all so beautiful. Are you telling me Wally's going to strip? - No. No, I just mean - - He could, you know. - He could do anything. Do what you've been doing. You know, just get it - - Drink? - No. No, thank you. I don't want it. - A little vodka? Not today, no. I can't drink it every day. It's not good for me. - How long have we known each other? - How long? - Mm-hmm. Let me think. Eleven years. How much have I changed? - How much? - Yeah. Very much, I think. Well, then you were young, now you're old. - Mmm. - I think your looks have faded. - And you're drinking now. - Ten years' time, I've become a different man. Oh, that's true. Why? Why? Overwork, simply. On my feet all day, every day. Every night I go to sleep in fear I'll be called out on a call. In the years you've known me, I have not had one single free day. Do you know that? And how can I help but to become old, you tell me, living such a life? - Not dead yet. - Ha! Some enthusiasms, some thoughts... but quite subdued. Dull, somehow. There's nothing I want... no one that I love... nothing I need. Well, I love you, of course. - Mmm. Third week of Lent, I was called to Malitskoye - spotted fever. There were rows of huts, people in the huts, side by side on the floor, lying in filth. Cattle living in the buildings with the sick, young pigs in there in the same room. - Ugh. - All day, working, not a bite to eat. I come home, thank God, to lie down, to rest... and they send in a switchman hit by the train, and - And I get him on the table, I'm going to start operating... and he dies... under the chloroform. The moment I least required it... my conscience chose to inform me that I'd murdered him. I sat down and closed my eyes and thought... 100 years from now... those who come after us... for whom our lives are showing the way - will they think kindly of us? Will they remember us with a kind word? And, Nanny, I wish to God I could think so. The people won't remember... but God will. Thank you. That was nicely said. Yes, oh, yes. - Sleep well? - Yes, very. I'll tell you... since the Herr and Frau Professor have come to visit... my life's gone completely off the track. I'm sleeping days, I'm up nights... I'm served all sorts of "je ne sais quoi" to eat... drinking wines. Used to be, all day, each moment ordered - work, this. Well, Sonya's still working, of course, but what am I doing? - Modern ways. - Ah! - Absolutely right! Yes, the professor sleeps till noon. I keep the samovar boiling, waiting for him to get up. We used to have dinner at noon, like people everywhere, hmm? Now it's after 6:00. He writes and reads all night. 2:00 in the morning, there's a ring. What is it? Excuse me. He wants his tea. Wake up the house, put on the samovar. Modern ways. - How much longer are they here? - Ah. A hundred years. - He wants to move here. - No! Magnificent. Beautiful views. - What a prospect. - Beautiful indeed, Your Excellency. And tomorrow I'll show you the plantation, Papa. Would you like that? Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the tea is served. Oh, would you please ask them to send it to my study? There's some things I have to do. I know you'll like the plantation, Papa. It's hot, sweltering. Our great scholar dresses for December. He's quite a careful man. Mmm. I am happy today. Birds singing, sun shining. You know, whatever I find myself doing today - just now, walking in the garden, or just standing here, looking at this table - I feel happy. God bless you. - And her eyes, uh - - Vanya. - Yes. - Tell us something. - What should I tell you? - Something new. Something new. What's new? Nothing's new. Everything's old. Nothing's changed. I'm the same. Probably a little bit worse because I've grown lazy... complain all day. What's new? Hmm? My old crow, my old mother's still prating on about her dear rights of women... one eye on the grave... the other one looking in her book for the secret of life. What about the professor? The professor, uh, goes on as before. All day and half of the night, he sits at his desk and he writes. What is he working on? Why doesn't he turn to some magnificent subject... like his autobiography? Now, there's a book - a worked-out academic... gout, rheumatism, migraine... the liver inflamed with jealousy and envy... lives on the estate of his first wife. From choice? No, because he's too cheap to live in the town. And the man prates constantly about his misfortunes. What are they? He has none. The son of a poor deacon. He's a scholarship student at the seminary. Gets a degree, gets a teaching chair. Now he's "Your Excellency," and he marries the daughter of a senator, and so on. But I say, forget that... because this man is so exceedingly fortunate... as to write and lecture for 25 years... upon a subject of which he knows less than nothing. Twenty-five years, this wise man tells us about art. Twenty-five years, he reads the works of others... he prattles about realism and naturalism... specious nonsense which the clever have long known... and the stupid really don't care about. Not a living soul knows who he is or cares... nor is he missed from a position which he held for 25 years. Isn't that something? For 25 years, this man kept some more worthy man out of a job. Yet look at him. He goes around as if he were saying... "Yes, I'm here among you." Well, you know, I believe you're jealous. Yes, I'm jealous. What a Don Juan with women. What a success with women is this man. His first wife? My sister, a transcendent beauty pure as the blue sky. Generous, noble. She had more admirers than this man had students. And yet she loved him, God knows why, the way only the pure angels love. My mother, his mother-in-law... she dotes on him to this day. He inspires in her reverent awe. And his second wife, this beauty whom we just saw... perceptive woman... she married him, he was already old. She gave up to him her life, her beauty, her luster. For what? Why? I'm asking you. And she stays faithful to him? Regrettably, yes. - Regrettably? - Yes, and I'll tell you why. Because a fidelity like that is false. From start to close, it's composed of rhetoric. To cheat on an old man who revolts you, oh, that would be immoral. But to willfully squander your youth and stifle yourself in unhappiness... well, now, that's something we can really commend. Well, now, Vanya, you shouldn't say things like that. I mean, someone who would betray their husband or wife... well, they just might next betray the country or something, you know. Oh, please, you're killing me. Now, Vanya, please allow me. You know, my wife, she ran away from me the day after we were married. I think she just didn't like me. But do I then forget my duty? No. To this day, I honor and revere her... and to this day, I am absolutely faithful to her. I - I do everything I can for her. That is, I give her what I have... so that she could raise the children... which she had with the man that she loved. Oh, have I given up happiness? Yes, but I've kept my pride. And what of her? There she is, now no longer young. Her beauty, as it must, has faded. Her lover died. What does she have now, hmm? Nanny? You go see to the chickens, and I'll tend to the tea. Yes. You know, I came to see your husband. You wrote he was deathly ill with rheumatism complications... and it seems he's in the perfect pink of health. - Ah, last night he was ill. - Mm-hmm. He complained of his legs. Um, today, though, you're right. He does seem fine. Yes, he seems fine... and I flat-out galloped 45 miles. Never mind. It isn't the first time. All right, um, I'll stay here tonight then, if you don't mind. At least I'll get some sleep. Lovely. It's so rare you spend the night here with us. I - I don't suspect you've eaten, have you? No. Many thanks, and thank you kindly. No, I haven't. No. Well, then you'll get your rest and your supper. These days we're not dining until 6:00. Cold tea. Yes, the temperature in the samovar markedly decreased. No matter, Ivan Ivanich. We'll drink it cold. Oh, no, no. It's not Ivan Ivanich, it's Ilya Ilych, ma'am. Uh, Ilya Ilych. Or you might want to call me Waffles, as some do... on account of the pockmarks on my face. - Waffles. - I know Your Excellency - your husband. He knows me very well. We're old friends. I lived right here on the estate. You've probably seen me there at the table, having dinner with you every night. Ilya llych is our good right hand. - Would you like some tea, Godfather? - No, no. Ah! Ah, God! - What's the matter, Grandmother? Forgot to tell Alexandr... I received a letter from Kharkov today. Pavel Alexeyevich sent me his newest pamphlet. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. - Is it interesting? - Yes. Interesting, yes... but strange. He's now refuting the very same things he defended... seven years ago. How, how, how, how - How... what? How awful. Nothing awful in it. It happens all the time. So just drink your tea, Mother. No. I want to talk. We all want to talk. We've been talking. We've been talking and reading and writing pamphlets... for 50 years... and I say, enough. Why is it unpleasant for you to hear me speak? Oh! Excuse me, Jean, but you have changed so much this last year, I hardly know you. You used to be a man of character... a man of fine opinions, an enlightened man, and now - Oh, yes. I was so enlightened... it's unfortunate I lit the way for no one. An enlightened man. What worse could you say about me? - I'm 47 years old. Up until one year ago, I thought exactly the same way you did. I joyed to cloud my mind with this rank scholasticism... that we all hold so dear... not to see real life. I knew that I was doing right. What a fine man. Now, if you'll excuse me, if you only knew. How can we know if you don't tell us? I - I spend my nights in a vicious fury... at the life I've let slip away from me. I could have enjoyed everything in life. I could have enjoyed everything! I enjoyed nothing! Now I'm too old. Uncle, it's so depressing. Are you blaming your former convictions? What you say is not the fault of your convictions - it's your fault! It's your own fault! Convictions by themselves are nothing. Like - Like paint on a palette. It's you who should have been working, you who should have been using them... doing real work. - Oh, real work? - Yes! Well, not everyone is called, you know, like our Herr Professor... to go speaking and writing and spewing work forth... like some farm machine. What do you mean by that? Grandmother, Uncle Vanya, please! I'm sorry. I'm done. I am silent. Excuse me. What a lovely day today. Not too hot. Excellent weather for - Suicide. Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick! Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick! - Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick! - Nanny, which one are you calling? Polka Dot has gone off with her chicks. I don't want the crows to get them. Here, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick! - Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick! - Uh, Doctor, they've come for you. - Who? Uh, from the factory. There's been - They need you. Fine. Well, I have to go, damn it. What a shame. I'm so sorry. Um, why don't you come back for supper, after the factory? Well, it'd be too late then, won't it? How could I? How could I? Waffles, get me a glass of vodka, would you, please? Glass of vodka. Well, if you should like to stop by sometime, perhaps with Sophie here... I would be most delighted. I only have the 80 acres, but if it interested you... next to me we have a model orchard such as you won't see within a thousand miles. It's a state reserve. And the, um, overseer, the old forester... he's usually ill, you see... and actually I get to oversee the work myself. - Yes, they told me you loved the woods. - Oh, yes. I - I suppose there's much good to be done there. Oh, much good. But my question is, doesn't it interfere with your real calling? My real calling? God knows what our real calling is. The woods. You find them interesting. Interesting? Fascinating, yes. Yes. Fascinating. You don't seem that old. What would we say? Um, 36, 37? - So? Well, how interesting can that be, really, alone in the woods all the time? I should find it quite monotonous. No, it's-it's really - it's really quite interesting. Every year he plots new forests or he makes a plan to conserve the old ones. He's received both a medal and a diploma for his work. If you listen to him, you'll see what he means. He says that forests embellish the land... and that they instill in man a love of beauty... that they raise the mind. Um, they moderate the climate... and in the lands where the climate is milder... then people struggle less with nature... and the people in those lands are milder and gentler... and their speech is more refined, and their movements are more graceful... and they cultivate the arts and sciences, and there's joy in their philosophy... and they treat women with nobleness. Bravo! Bravo! This is magnificent. But now it's not convincing, my friend, as I still must fuel my stoves... and build with those same woods that you prize. - Burn peat in your stoves. - Hmm? Build your barn of stones. You understand? Yes, sometimes we cut wood out of necessity. But why be wanton? Why? Our forests fall before the ax. Billions of trees, all perishing. The homes of birds and beasts being laid waste. The level of the rivers falls, and they dry up. Sublime landscapes disappear, never to return... because we haven't sense enough to bend down and pick fuel up from the ground. Isn't this so? What must human beings be to destroy what they can never create? God's given us reason and power of thought so that we may improve our lot... and what have we used these powers for but waste? We've destroyed our forests, our rivers run dry... our wildlife is all but extinct... our climate ruined. And every day, every day, wherever one looks... our life is more hideous. Oh, I see. You think me amusing. These seem to you the thoughts of some poor eccentric. Perhaps - Perhaps it's naive, too, on my part. Perhaps you think that, but I pass by the woods I've saved from the ax... and I hear the forest sighing. I planted that forest. And I think things may be in our power. You understand? Perhaps the climate itself is in our control. Why not? And if in a thousand years, people are happy... I will have played a part in that happiness. A small part. I plant a birch tree. I watch it take root. It grows. It sways in the wind. And I feel such pride. Well. Well, my time is up. I must be off. Thank you, Waffles. And, of course, it's possible I am just an eccentric. And thank you for the honor of your hospitality. - When will we see you again? - I can't say. Sooner than next month, I hope. You - What? You've fallen into one of your moods again? - Excuse me? - You're being impossible. - Was I? - Yes, you were. - Why are you baiting your mother? And this morning at breakfast, you quarreled with Alexandr. Yes! Excuse me. - How petty. - Petty? - Yes. - What if I hate him? - Why should you hate him? He's like everybody else. He's no worse than you. Oh, look at yourself. Look at your face. Look at the way you move. You're too lazy to live, with your torpor. - Too lazy to live? - Yes, you are. Yes. I am. I'm too bored. Do you know? Everyone berates my husband. Everyone berates him. Everybody pities me. Oh, the poor woman saddled with such an old man. They're so concerned for me. I mean, you must excuse me, but it's quite disgusting. Don't you think so? Why can you not look with indifference on a woman who's not your own? - Why? Because the doctor's right. There is in each one of you a demon of destruction that spares nothing - neither forests, birds, women... nor each other. You know, I don't care for that philosophy. He has an interesting face. - "He"? - Our doctor. - Yes? - Nervous face. A tired face, I think. - Sonya finds him attractive. I think she's in love with him. I understand it. Do you know he's been here three times since I first came... and I haven't once spoken with him properly? What must he think? He must think I'm mean. Oh, must he? I've never shown him any kindness. - Do you know why we're such good friends? - No. It's because we're both tiresome people. - We're both dull. No, please don't look at me that way. I don't like it. Well, how else am I supposed to look at you? I love you! I look at you, and I see my life - I see my youth and I see my happiness. I know that the chance that you could reciprocate those feelings... is nothing. - But I want nothing. - I just want you to permit me to look at you - - Shh! - And to hear your voice. - Shh! Someone will hear you. I just want you to let me speak with you and just to be near you. Oh, God. This is awful. Good. Okay. Uh, the next act is - it's a couple of weeks later. It's in the dining room, and it's very late at night. Would you follow me? - Who's there? Sonya, is that you? - It's me. Lenotchka, I'm in pain. Help me. Your blankets fell. I'll close the window. No, no, no. It's stifling in here. I dozed off... and dreamed that my leg belonged to someone else. I was awoken by the pain. I don't think it's gout. I think it's rheumatism! What time is it? Twenty past 12:00. In the morning, please go to the library... and look for the Batiushkov. - I think we have him. - Hmm? Look for - In the morning, please look for the Batiushkov. I remember we have him. Why can I not breathe? Two nights with no sleep. You're tired. They say Turgenev developed angina pectoris from gout. I'll get it too. Damn old age. Damn, revolting, impotent old age. I grow more repulsive to myself. And I'm sure you, too, find it revolting to look on me. Do you know, you speak of your age in a tone... that suggests that it's our fault you've grown old? I revolt you most of all. You're right, of course. You're young, you're healthy, you're beautiful, you want to live. Here am I, an old man, more than one foot in the grave. - Isn't that right? - Oh, God. - Of course that's right. - Oh. How foolish of me to still keep on living. Please. - Be patient. - I'm ready to collapse. - Soon I'll set you all free. Yes. - What must I do? Please, be silent. Because of me you're all ready to collapse, all of you. - Everyone bored. - Oh! Wasting their youth. I'm the only one content. I see it. - Oh, you're destroying me. - Yes! Of course I'm destroying everyone. What do you want from me? Nothing. Well, then be quiet. Fine. Let us stipulate. I am repulsive. I am a despot. I am that sick egoist you all think me to be. But have I not earned it? I worked all my life for science, respected and honored. And then I'm thrust, thrust... for no apparent reason... into this tomb among the mindless... every day their prattle stuffing my ears. I want to live. Here, I'm in exile. Every waking moment I can pine for the past... envy the success of others... or I can fear death. Those three choices are my life. Have patience. Five or six more years, I'll be old too. - Hmm? - Papa. Papa, you sent for Dr. Astrov. Now he's here, and you don't want him. What am I supposed to tell him now that we've called him here for nothing? What good can Astrov do me? The man knows as much of medicine as I do of beekeeping. What am I to tell him, please? We sent for him. The man's a fool! I don't Enceladus a prime candidate for future missions. To me it's like there's a sign on Enceladus that says, "Free samples, take one." We just gotta fly through the plume and collect the stuff. We don't have to drill, we don't have to dig, we don't have to scurry around looking for it. It's being injected into space. NARRATOR: The discovery of a new energy source and the possible oceans of liquid water inside planetary moons point to potential new footholds for life in our solar system. Meanwhile, discoveries here on Earth are revealing that life can withstand an even wider variety of conditions than previously thought. Missions to extreme environments are showing that microbes can live in dry deserts and thrive in lakes full of poisonous arsenic. Bacteria survive in slimy colonies on cave walls dripping with sulfuric acid, living off noxious hydrogen sulfide gas. And microbes flourish in toxic rivers of corrosive industrial waste. GREEN: We now know it's possible for microorganisms to exist in these large acidic and even poisonous regions. SHANK: The more we look at the extreme habitats on Earth, the more we find life there. We're pushing back the limits of where life can live all the time through our own discoveries. NARRATOR: From freezing glaciers to super-heated hot springs... from high deserts blasted by ultraviolet radiation... to deep mines miles underground... and ocean trenches where sunlight never penetrates, scientists are discovering that life finds a way to adapt and thrive. McKAY: Life on Earth can exist in many extreme environments, and it can do many remarkable things. And we're learning more every day about how flexible and remarkable life on Earth really is. NARRATOR: So, could environments on other worlds previously thought too harsh for life be worth a second look? GREEN: We've really gotta put ourselves out there in terms of thinking what the possibilities are. McKAY: When we first started looking for life on other worlds, we were looking for Earth-like conditions. "Okay, well, we got to have water, got to have an energy source, got to have carbon." But to me, the number one question-- the big question-- is: Is there another type of life on another world somewhere in our solar system? NARRATOR: So Chris wants to know, if life could develop in new ways, perhaps even using different kinds of chemistry, then could even the most inhospitable places offer surprising new footholds for life? One such place is one of Saturn's moons visited by the space probe Cassini-- Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Cassini detects organic building blocks in the atmosphere, and the spacecraft's radar reveals something mysterious beneath clouds at the south pole. It looks like a lake of water. Further flybys reveal it's just one of hundreds scattered across both the north and south poles. It was exciting and mysterious to see all these different lakes and to try to understand what's going on. NARRATOR: Titan is the first world other than the Earth known to have a liquid on its surface. But at minus-290 degrees, this liquid can't be water. Analysis of infrared light reflected off the lakes reveals that they are filled with super-chilled liquid methane and ethane. On Earth, these hydrocarbons are gases we use as fuel. Data now reveals that methane on Titan carves river valleys, forms clouds, and even falls as rain. Liquid methane acts a lot like water on Earth. But could it act the way water does as an essential foundation for life, allowing organic molecules to dissolve, mix and interact? It's a question astrobiologist Chris McKay is investigating. McKAY: Our general theory of life, based on our one example on Earth, is that we need a liquid. Some people would argue that that liquid has to be water. Well, on Titan, we can ask the question, "Well, what about another liquid? Could some other liquid besides water do the trick?" NARRATOR: For life to exist on Titan, Chris believes one fundamental process has to happen first, a process that, according to the most widely accepted theory, took place on early Earth and ultimately produced us. In this scenario, the raw ingredients of life-- organic molecules-- dissolved in water. And once in this liquid, they came together and reacted to form bigger, more complex molecules that would eventually somehow become living things. For life to have a chance on Titan, the building blocks would have to dissolve in liquid methane. Chris is now trying to find out if this is possible. He first has to replicate the organic building blocks that Cassini's instruments detected high in Titan's atmosphere. Simulating an energy source, Chris fires an electric spark that hits gases inside the test tube that are known to exist on Titan. This creates organic molecules similar to those in Titan's atmosphere, the brown residue at the bottom of the tube. And we trigger the same reactions in the flask, and as a result we produce the same kind of solid organic material in the flask that is being produced in Titan's atmosphere. NARRATOR: Then Chris recreates Titan's remarkable lakes. He fills the test tube with methane gas and then cools it below minus-290 degrees using liquid nitrogen. Now the methane liquefies, just as it does on Titan's frigid surface. So in the flask we'll have a miniature little lake, a little puddle of liquid methane, swirling around in that organic material. Will anything dissolve in that organic material? That's the question. And will that over time build up organic complexity? Could it be the start of what could be another type of life? NARRATOR: No one knows exactly how life gets started. But the question Chris is interested in is can organic compounds dissolve in liquids like methane? If so, it would suggest that even at extremely cold temperatures, the chemistry needed for life could be possible in liquids other than water. McKAY: We know that there's conditions there that maintain liquid, there's energy sources, there's organic material, there's nutrients, there's an environment that may be suitable for life. But if there's life there, it's going to be completely different than anything we have on Earth. NARRATOR: Chris's experiment is one step toward understanding whether there could be life on Titan. McKAY: To me the most exciting possibility is that there's life on Titan because then that would show not just that life started twice, but it's started twice in very different conditions. It would show us that life is a natural process that's going to pop up on many different worlds, many different planets around many different stars. NARRATOR: Titan, Enceladus, Europa, and Io show that even within our solar system there are places where some scientists believe life could potentially gain a foothold. GREEN: Might be extreme life, might be life that we've never seen before in terms of its structure and its composition. But we're now realizing that those environments could harbor life. NARRATOR: The three vital factors-- energy, liquids and chemical building blocks-- are more widespread than has ever been realized. And if it's possible here, then could the right conditions also exist beyond the boundaries of our own solar system? GREEN: By understanding our own solar system, I believe we'll then be well on our way to understanding the conditions that could occur around other stars and throughout our galaxy. It really changes our view of this universe. NARRATOR: Is there somewhere out there, a star like our sun, orbited by habitable planets that are teeming with life? There are billions of stars just like our sun within our galaxy. And the odds suggest that tens of billions of planets are orbiting around them. If there is life out there, can we find it? Astronomer Mario Livio is at the forefront of the search. He's using the Hubble space telescope to look deep into space to where new stars, like our sun, are bursting into life. This is the Orion nebula as seen by Hubble. Here, 1 ,500 light years beyond our solar system, new stars are being born inside a vast cloud of dust and gas. LIVIO: So when we look at the nebula now, it's almost like looking into a cave. We see this hollow part where gas and dust has been blown away and inside where these stars are being born. NARRATOR: And right inside, among all the shining stars, is what looks like a small, dark smudge. In fact, it is a young sun surrounded by a dense disk of dust and gas more than 50 billion miles across. This smudge represents the dawn of a new solar system. In this case we see the disk edge on, and therefore the disk completely obscures the light from the star, and this is why you don't see the star. NARRATOR: Other images show similar disks tilted to reveal the star at the center. These spinning clouds of matter may one day form planets and moons, as particles of dust, ice and gas collide and clump together. This is the same process that is thought to have created the planets of our solar system. Hubble has revealed that swirling disks like this are extremely common. The fact that we see these very often tells us that these raw materials from which planets form are very, very common. And so that planetary systems form probably around most stars. NARRATOR: But do these young solar systems produce Earth-like planets containing the right ingredients needed to sustain life? Astronomer Josh Eisner wants to find out. He has come to Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to look at the clouds of gas and dust in more detail. EISNER: We'd really like to understand are there building blocks of life there? Are things that we associate with at least life on our planet available for planet formation around other stars? NARRATOR: Analyzing gas and tiny bits of dust from hundreds of light years away is no simple feat. It requires instruments of great sensitivity and precision: the Keck telescopes. 1 4,000 feet up on the summit of a dormant volcano, these twin telescopes are among the most powerful on Earth. Josh uses both of them together. And with a spectroscope to analyze infrared light emitted from inside the early solar systems, he can tell what they're made of. EISNER: We're actually trying to map a detailed picture of the dust and what that hot gas is made of. Is there water vapor there that might get incorporated into an atmosphere one day, or into an ocean one day? NARRATOR: His findings are encouraging. In some of the distant solar systems, Josh is detecting evidence of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, three key elements needed to produce the chemical building blocks on which life depends. Even more intriguing is that in some disks those ingredients also appear to be at the right distance from their stars to form planets with Earth-like qualities. So much for theory. The question is: Do such planets actually exist? Geoff Marcy is one astronomer trying to directly answer that question. He's a planet hunter, scanning the heavens for signs of planets that may have already formed around other stars thousands of light years away from our solar system. It is actually quite a challenge to find planets around other stars, and the reason is very simple-- planets don't shine. Planets are essentially dark. NARRATOR: By using advanced telescopes, dedicated planet hunters like Geoff have found ways to overcome this challenge. If you watch a star, it ought to have the same brightness all the time, 24/7. But if there's a planet orbiting that star, when the planet crosses in front of the star, the planet will block a little of the starlight and you'll see the star dim, a tiny amount, every time the planet crosses in front, over and over in a repeated way. And, marvelously, you can learn the size of the planet, because the bigger the planet is, the more light from the star it blocks. And so we learn an enormous amount of information about these planets just by watching stars dim. NARRATOR: Not surprisingly, most of the planets astronomers have found this way are giant ones that block a lot of star light. By also observing the gravitational pull they have on their stars, Geoff calculates that most of these giant planets are made of gas and are unlikely to be habitable. But the holy grail is to find far smaller, rocky worlds, like Earth, where the conditions for life could exist. MARCY: The challenge of finding Earth-sized planets is enormous. When an Earth crosses in front of a star, it blocks only one one hundredth of one percent of the light from the star. NARRATOR: The Kepler space telescope is designed to detect this subtle dimming. Its mission: to focus on one tiny spot of space and scrutinize 1 50,000 stars for signs of planets the size of Earth. Sensitive enough to detect minute dips in a star's light, Kepler is already producing mountains of data, and thousands of new planet candidates are being discovered. MARCY: Kepler has now already discovered a few planets that have a diameter and a mass that indicates clearly the planet is rocky. And so we now have for the first time in human history definite planets out there among the stars that remind us of home. NARRATOR: These first rocky planets are too close to their stars to sustain life. But the sheer number of smaller planets being found is transforming our view of solar systems beyond our own. MARCY: We've learned that nature makes some large planets, the size of Jupiter and Saturn, but nature makes even more of the smaller planets the size of Neptune, and even more of the planets the size of the Earth. The number of planets is sort of like the rocks and pebbles you see on a beach. There are a few big boulders; there are many more rocks; and there are an uncountable number of grains of sand that represent the Earth-sized planets we see in the cosmos. NARRATOR: Geoff believes it's only a matter of time before we find a habitable planet. I suspect that this scene we see here is one that's reproduced billions of times over among the Earth-like planets, the habitable planets, in our Milky Way galaxy. NARRATOR: But even if we find a world just the right size and in just the right place, with oceans of liquid water, could we detect life from a distance of trillions of miles? The James Webb space telescope may be able to do just that. Due to go into orbit later this decade, this new telescope is three times more powerful than Hubble. It will be able to analyze starlight passing through the atmospheres of the closest Earth-like worlds, looking for the telltale signs of life itself. I think the chances are very good that if you find a planet with oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, like our own Earth, there's probably plant life on that planet that is producing the oxygen. NARRATOR: As telescopes see farther and spacecraft voyage closer to distant worlds, new discoveries are transforming what we thought we knew about our solar system and our galaxy. GREEN: I am constantly awestruck by the data that's coming in our current fleet of missions. Science fiction didn't tell us in any way, shape or form what we're finding out now. SQUYRES: Years from now, people are gonna look back on this as being the golden age of exploration in the solar system. You can only go someplace for the first time once, right? And we're doing that now. NARRATOR: Scientists are finding organic molecules, the raw ingredients that life needs to take hold, in our solar system and beyond. GLAVIN: I think we'd be naive to think that this chemistry and life here on earth is the only place that it's happening in the universe. I mean the fact is that we've got billions of galaxies, you know, trillions of star-forming environments that probably have the same chemistry going on. NARRATOR: The right conditions that make a world habitable could be more widespread than ever imagined. All of this leads us to think that life should be an easy start on another world. NARRATOR: And the same forces of nature that forged life here could be playing out elsewhere in our galaxy. A lovely exercise for everyone to do is to look up into the night sky, look at the twinkling lights and realize that those stars by and large all have planets. And that's just our galaxy. There are hundreds of billions of galaxies out there like our Milky Way, and so the number of planets in our universe is a truly uncountable number. NARRATOR: So the race is now on to see if life actually exists beyond Earth. Will life first be discovered on a moon such as Enceladus? Will it be found by an advanced telescope? Or will it be found at all? Whatever the answer, many believe this is a turning point in history, when we at last have the technology and the know how to find out if there is life beyond Earth.

Hey, I don't know how expensive this is, but even if you give it to me, I won't use it. Why? Is it more fun to use it secretly? Be careful. That is also a mental disease. Yes, Mom. Hang up your phone, let's talk. Hey! Did they call? What did they say? Today? No. Just say we'll meet today. From the start, we wanted her to become an actress. But they said they first wanted to make her recognizable, so they made her debut in a girl group. I thought it would only be for a short time, but it's been 3 years... Wearing shoes with such high heels, while jumping around on the stage. Every time I see it, I feel so sad. I feel so sorry for our darling. Why are you saying this? My mother is a bit naive.

Didn't you say that anyone can listen to your performance? You don't seem to know that I'm someone important. I'm just telling you. Don't talk to me anymore. You just say useless words. You punk! Do you know how expensive that was? What will you do? Don't go. It'll create difficulties. Isn't he your friend? Isn't he a part of your group? Acting all cool up til the end. I told you to get up! Ajussi! Two against one... What exactly are you doing? Don't cause trouble. Go. And absolutely do not report this to the authorities. Who's letting you just take him away? You punk! Aren't you JB? Right? Idols, all of you just manage yourselves like this, huh? Where do you think your dirty hands are touching? What's this? Telling others to stay out. Is JB that great? Excuse me-- Excuse me, is it possible that you'd do a duet with me? Sorry. So, you've already found someone? It's not that, I... Ri An! If you don't have a duet partner yet, do you want to do it with me? Hi. What's this? Is it possible that you don't have a partner yet? Wait a minute! Wait! Ri An, it's me, S - Sun Dong. Ri An, open the door! It's me! Can't you be outside too? Here we go again. Don't you get tired? I want to be by myself. Go find another room to sleep in. I won't say a single word while I'm here, so don't tell me to do this or that. You're just like a beggar. What? What did you say to me just now? Who do you think you are to just randomly make fun of other people? So annoying. Don't provoke me. Are idols some big officials? They clearly don't have much talent... You don't have much talent either, isn't that right? Shouldn't your talent be stronger than mine? Right now, are you saying that I'm very bad? My uncle isn't talented at learning at all. He's over 30 years old and is still taking his exams. He eventually tried to commit suicide and now... now he's a vagrant. Why are you telling me this? Seeing you reminds me of my uncle. You haven't reached the level of a trainee yet, and all the time you say you dream of becoming something. You think too highly of yourself. From what I see, you don't need dreams. You need to give up. You should work on seeing reality. A completely rude idol like you, who is never polite to anyone, has no right to criticize me! I hate these kind of humiliating fights the most. Let go while I'm still able to be nice. When you're fighting, are you still concerned about how others see you? What kind of fight doesn't make you lose face? Do you treat it as something fun? What are you guys doing here? Teacher, can't we stay here for the night? Stars? They only look pretty from afar. Hello? Isn't that JB? I'm in front of the school. After 5 minutes, help me open the door. - Okay. - Wait a moment. - Thank you very much. - Yes. Um, excuse me. Can I take a picture? Taking a picture is a bit... I'm all finished. Who's there? What is this? It's way past the curfew, and you're breaking into a female teacher's room-- This is too... - Don't shout. - You're not leaving? You're not leaving? Ah, that was close. Did you have a fight? Wow, you're really hardworking! It's because I was stressed. I solved a few questions, just to relieve stress. Can solving math equations also help relieve stress? Isn't that more stressful? If there is a human museum, I will put you in it. Alien, a complete alien. Why? In this type of situation, shouldn't the female student take the initiative to cook ramyeon? Ramyeon tastes best when eaten raw. Is your collaboration with Sun Dong going well? What? The evaluation. Am I crazy to be in the same group with that crazy girl? Then who will you be pairing with? Will you-- Salty! Ah... it's salty. I told you to eat little by little. Here you go. Boys, knowing that they'll get beaten, why do they still want to fight? Beaten. Who got beaten? The other guy was bleeding so badly. It's no joke. 17 against 1? What's this? Stay still, don't move. I'm applying medicine here. Go rest. Ye-Yeah. Yeah. Ah, right... Thank you for the advice. Huh? I shouldn't allow others to snatch my things away. You're right. I will not get robbed. With all my might, I'm going to protect what belongs to me. Are you all right? Mmm... What are you doing? You... Do you like men? Even if that's the case, you can't like me. Huh? Next time remember to wear clothes. Sin Hae Seong, you little bastard. What time is it now? What time? Run. Hurry up. Run. Quickly! Quickly! Quickly! - Hello. - Yeah. Hey, you can't park there! Ajussi! Excuse me. Is there a problem? Is there a third year student here named Jin Yu Jin? Why are you looking for Yu Jin? Hey. Something big has happened. I thought that by moving here, it would be more peaceful. This fellow is causing me trouble again. Look over here, there's this user name, Unknown Yi. Go and report this fellow. It's making matters worse. What kind of ID is this? Calling himself Unknown Yi. I've already informed JB and Si U. Once the results are out, we'll do our best to ensure they are the ones that are the victims. Also stopping the reports. Wanting to stop it, is it possible? Fabricate Si U's news. Go lid past JB to cover news. Si U has quit our company, announce that to the media. What? Exactly how? You really want him to quit? Find out what school he wants to go to. Why don't you go ask? Representative. I was wrong. There were several of them beating one up. Should I have just stood there and looked? Just keep quiet. Sorry. According to what he says. Looks like it's not a one sided issue, right? Try asking JB to see if I am telling the truth or not. That party has already reconciled. Reconciled? Reconcile, what reconcile? Who is the victim exactly? Keep your mouth shut. Detective! You also know that among young people, who get angry , they sometimes are temporarily unable to control themselves. You can understand... Sorry... I've collected the necessary information In our next contact, it'll be enough to just bring him over. Yes. Of Course. Aigoo... You want to with me ? Let's go together. What? I was a fan of your band. So you recognized me. Yes... yes... Next time I'll buy you a drink. Yes, thank you. Take care. It was nice meeting you, I hope we can work well together. - Hey. You . - Don't be like this. What is this? It looks good. Aigoo. This is new. Don't simply touch it. This child. Show off what? This is very expensive. Wow. You in the school bully school mate. What? Don't do that. Wow. Voice not bad. I want to use a while Until this investigation is over. Confiscated. Teacher? Just listen to what a teacher says. I've already told you before. Don't cause any trouble in the school before graduation. Oh? When you heard that, what did you do? Leaving while holding a guitar. Singing by the streets? Nonsense. Confiscated. Saw the news? The company questioned me about going to other schools. Doesn't that mean they want me to quit? Isn't this what you wanted? Didn't you want to go solo? This... I'm worried about what to do with it while I'm not around. Now, looks like it should be given to you. My name is also included, over there. I was going to get expelled sooner or later, why not expel me right now? I just didn't expect it to be so quick. Isn't it better this way? Why are you giving this to me? I was just curious to see how you would react. It seems like the director is trying to cover up any negative news about you. Shouldn't it be that way? What? Using an incompetent person to influence me? From the company's perspective, shouldn't it be like this? Did you think I would get in a fight just for a colleague? Don't be too sensible. You've changed so much. Don't you think that you've changed a lot? Is it a bad thing to change? I'm more disappointed in the people who don't know that they've changed. The matter has been exposed. What is he going to do? Hello. Hello. Why do you look so shocked? What? How is school life? Mmm... Ri An, I know what you are thinking of. The matter, this time. Si U. If he quits, celebrity life is going to get harder. It is also possible that your popularity may fall and never rise again. That should be uncomfortable. Just don't be too sad. Yes. Have a seat. Whether or not it's your kid, Or my kids. Immediately giving them a warning of being expelled. Isn't it a bit, At least consult me for a moment. I am also considered the principal. I will turn this school into the best art school of South Korea. -Yes You just don't categorize it by your side or my side. Cultivate what is good. Throw away what is bad. Start anew. How can it be like this? Is this a company? What is a school? Isn't it waiting for the kid's debut? Allowing us to protect this place? Hyung. Stop living in a fantasy. Talking honestly to non-promising students, is also considered helping. We should be able to help them discover their own talents. Giving them hope without conditions. Are you going to be responsible for the rest of their lives, hyung? What responsibility? At least give them a chance. That's why there is a test. Test. What happened in the past is in the past. Now we should join hands and work together. For the school's sake. So, be it the company or the test is good. Is all to cheat them? Dividing them into groups has already proceeded. What does that mean? It's not a competition between groups. But a cooperative work between two people and to choose one and eliminate the other. Isn't it like this nowadays? Why must we do that? The kids are not filming a variety program even. By doing this, only then will the kids be motivated. Kids nowadays only follow their instincts. Unmoved by force or persuasion. That's why I don't have to drive them out. I don't bully people. That's right! But your children are competing with my children. Isn't it very obvious? My kids also have normal standards too. Even if they form a clique, Hyung's students also have a possibility of winning. Didn't you hope for a fair evaluation? What's the problem? - Mother! - Mother! Don't contact the other representative today. Our president seems to know already. I'm asking you not to do it, don't do it. Don't you know that you need to protect me? I also didn't know that it would become like this. Everything's settled using money, isn't it? You could also give them money and it's over. They're just bastards. Who's the reason I got into a fight? Who let you in? What? What? You don't have money? No money, just say it. I can lend you some money. Are you still human? You shameless guy. This time let's do the duet together. What did you say? I said to do it together. What are you plotting? Didn't you look down on me? I want you to see how great I am. There is no need. You haven't found a partner yet, have you? Now is not the time to refuse. No matter what, I have to choose someone to work with. I feel more comfortable being with you. Let's do it together. -=OZ Entertainment presents=- -=Head Director Lee Gang Cheol= =Students raising objections towards the dormitory rooms arrangement=- -=Change the lead actress to Eun Jeong.= =Ri An's acting, what to do about it?

I don't know either. There are only these. I really want to know how the story will end. It's time for us to win. For the end-of-the-month tests, your results weren't bad. Everybody did well, very well. Then do we qualify to enter the art class? No. Your score must exceed 300 points to qualify. Which is a shame, because your scores were just a little short of that. Hye Mi, 30 points; Sam Dong, 40 points; and Pil Suk, 45 points. Then, we will be in the Half-Admission class next year as well? Teacher! We didn't qualify! How can you be so happy? Don't worry. We still have a chance. Idol group K members' attendance this semester is very poor. You knew how it would be. Why are you being like this, Principal? When they first debut, they need to make sure everyone remembers their faces. Going onto many variety shows and flattering the directors is a necessary part of their path. There are 24 hours in a day, but even that's not enough. Principal, use your broad mind and try to understand. It's already gone past that point. No matter how busy they have been, there has never been a student who has been absent this much! So, are you saying that you won't let my kids graduate? There is one way... What way? By participating in the Dance of the Year competition. Dance of the Year? What's that? I know! Isn't that the competition that Rain won last year? That's right. It's an annual dance competition for high school students. You might call it a dancer's biggest competition. The first place winners are awarded 100 points. Furthermore, just competing in the competition is worth 50 points. How's that? Sounds possible, right? How are we supposed to win at such a huge competition? Don't worry. We have the Dance God, Yang Jin Man. Dance God? He's the god of dancing. You won't find a single person able to dance better than him. During university, he won every single nightclub dance competition in the country, and then gave all of his prize money as a generous gift to his sister. Wow, he won enough for a dowry? Maybe he really is good. But even more than that, I believe that with the skills you've shown me this past semester you have a very good chance of winning. Oh! Registration starts today. Hurry, let's go register! No need for that. The loser of rock paper scissors will go. Sure let's do that. Rock paper scissors. Go Hye-Mi, Song Sam-Dong, and Kim Pil-Suk. Long time no see. Yes, that's right. I saw your end of the month assessment. You improved a lot. Was it about four times...? I practiced until my toes were falling off. I don't even know how many times I have sprained my foot. I've never been this serious about something in my life. All thanks to you. It... really irritated me quite a bit. Are you competing? Yeah, you too? I'm excited. Who will win? Winning isn't that important. All that matters is giving it your all I wish I could say that. Wait and see. I'll definitely win this competition. Just watch. I'll join the Art Class. Fine. I'll wait and see, then. Oh, right! Jin Guk told me to register for him. See you next time. Hi. Hi. Are you participating in the competition? Yeah. You are too, right? Yeah. Competing is the only way I can make up for my absences. Ah, really? Why are you looking at me like that? Do you have something to say to me? Don't you have something to say to me? No... Really? Jason! Have you filled out the registration form yet? Yeah... Why didn't you grab one for me? Then... I'll see you later. Bye... Who is she? I haven't seen her before. Kim Pil Sook. You said before that if she couldn't lose 30kg, she wouldn't be able to debut. You're telling me that was Kim Pil-Sook? Goodness! Did she fix herself up? Did she get liposuction? Listen up. It's not like she can be a singer just because she lost weight. Why not? You're a singer, but you can't even sing. What did you say? Who is it? It's Teacher Kang's sister. Oh, hello. We're almost home. It's really cold outside. I know. What's up? What'd she say? We have to go buy a cake. Jin Guk is home. You go home first and I'll go buy it real fast. It's fine. Let's just go together I'll just go get it myself. It's cold. Just go back first. Can you put writing on the cake? Alright. "Welcome home" should be good enough right? Mmm... Ok, go in. This is for Hye Sung. This is for teacher. And this is for our noo-nim. No thanks! You haven't even called once in all this time. You think you can pacify us with these gifts? We weren't allowed to use the internet or our cellphones during our activities. I didn't get a chance to keep in touch. Does that make any sense at all? Which planet are you on? On the South Pole of this world? OMG! A handbag! Jin Guk, where'd you get the money to buy me such an expensive handbag? I have a job now, but I still have a long way to pay back what I owe you for rent. Far from it. Headphones with ear covers. My ears are hurting from the headphones hanging off my ears. This is perfect. Oh my. Your face looks so tiny. Why's that? Oppa, help me to tie this up? Ok, come here. How does this work? Hey - Hey what do you think you're doing? Whose face do you think you're allowed to casually kiss? I can't be at ease because of her. Jin Guk can you tie it for me as well? Act your age. Oh.. there's one more gift. When do Sam Dong and Hye Mi come back? Oh, them? They should be back soon. They stopped nearby to buy something. Put them on and let me see. They make your face look smaller. Do they always come back late everyday? Don't get me started on them. They don't listen to me when I tell them to stop practicing. Our love for Shi Hyuk Oppa is unconditional. Why, why, why come to the gate of Shi Hyuk's house? It's because I want to see- to see- to see Shi Hyuk. Shi Hyuk, come out! You've all worked hard. Shi Hyuk is in the care of the Kang family. Today, Shi Hyuk Oppa returned home with great difficulty. If we continue making so much noise, we could be sued. This will cause inconvenience to Shi Hyuk oppa. So let's be a little quiet. Quiet! Excuse me, this is Shi Hyuk oppa's house. You can't go in. I live here too. Come on. I want to live here, too. But as Oppa's fans, we have to respect his personal space. I'm not one of his fans. Hold on. Like I just said, you're not allowed to enter. It's you all that aren't allowed in. Ya, you should listen while I'm talking nicely. Wake up! Who do you take me for? What do you think you're doing? Let go now! What's this? Hey! Pay attention when I'm trying to be nice. Shi Hyuk oppa! Hye Mi, are you alright? You should leave. Why are you here? This place hasn't changed a bit. Other people don't come here anymore. Where are all the others? Hye Mi... Is Hye Mi alright? She's fine. Don't worry about it. Thank you for yesterday. If it wasn't for you, there would've been big trouble. I don't think that's something you should be thanking me for. Don't you remember what you said to me last time? I asked you if you liked Hye Mi. If I ask you again now, Will your answer be the same? No. You already know that I really like Hye Mi. Mmm... I will not give up on Hye Mi. See you. I just wanted to say that. Welcome home! It's late. Hello everyone. I am the judge of this grand competition, Gu Jun Yeob. How are the teams split up? The teams are really important to me. The 2010 Dance Competition will have teams of four. If it's four people per team, we are one person short. Start making your teams. First, would those students whose score is a multiple of four come on stage. You! Four! Four! Hye Mi! You definitely have to pick me! Got it? Those who are on stage now will be the leaders of each group of four. Each leader will now choose members one by one. Then first, number four, Go Hye Mi. Who will be the first to be chosen? For the first member... I choose Jason. Ah, I guess Jason is the strongest. For my first member, I choose... Hyun Shi Hyuk. My next choice is Song Sam Dong. I choose Jun Tae San senior. My last choice is Kim Pil-Suk. I choose Ha So Hyun senior. Alright, next. It's time to choose the dance theme and performance order. Each leader please step forward to choose their team's theme. For Go Hye Mi's team, the theme is... birds, and will be 12th to perform. Yoon Baek-Hee's team's theme is... a snake and will be 7th to perform. Birds, huh? Snake... This will be an interesting contest. The competition will be held on this stage in a week. Please choreograph the dance according to the theme you have been assigned. Prepare the best performances for us. I'll see you all in a week. Sam-dong ah Hye Mi... I'm sorry. I wanted to choose you first. It's alright. If it were me, I'd choose Jason too. It'd be bad if another team got him. Thanks for understanding. It's okay. Hey, country boy. This time we're really a team. Looks like it. Take care. Let's work hard. Let's work hard. This kid can speak dialect. Didn't I learn it from you? Yes, right. Hye Mi, want to speak in dialect? - Forget it. - Right. Really? Did I make a mistake? What do you mean? It seems like you want to be in the same group as Hye Mi. High five! High five! No, good job. Really? Baek Hee-ah... We have to beat them. Mmm. Okay. Teacher Shi said she would help us choreograph our dance. Ah, that's really good. We're in the Half-Admission class, so we're not allowed to use the practice room. You're part of our group now, so you'll have to practice in the underground room. I know where your underground room is. I went there before. When? That day when we went to the karaoke. I was bored, so I followed you. Really? Looks like you two have a pretty deep connection. No, it's not like that. It seems like it's a bit complicated. What is that? What is this? It's blocking the entrance. The total is nearly 2,000,000 won, and you're only paying this much? Do you realise this interest is even less than what the bank charges? Of course, I understand. Thank you. I know you're thankful. Just make sure you're on time. I'm such a busy man, and you still have me come down here. I am so sorry. Please wait a moment. Hello? Teacher! Something terrible happened! We have been kicked out of the underground room! What? Kicked out? The owner wants to sell the place. In that case, how about we practice in the park? The subway station would work too. Ya! Do you want to freeze to death? I know, go back to school first. I'll think of a way to fix this. Where are we going to practice? And we can't go to the park, it's too cold today... If there really isn't any place to go.. How about going to my place? Your place? How's this stage? Using it to practice wouldn't be bad. This really is not bad. But it's not a place where students should go. Don't worry. There isn't a problem if it's before business hours. So spacious, not bad. Teacher, let's just use this place. The floor here isn't bad, either. There's plenty of room. Is that right? Compared to the old practice room, this might be 100 times better. The floor is not bad either. -Hurry and look at the ceiling. -Then it's up to you to look after it now. How much is it to rent? This is prepared for VIP clients, our 2nd special test product. President Ma... Your expression.... Please don't make that kind of face. That... because I'm so grateful, I don't know how to express it. Terrence. In a dance, the snake is very charming. Very sexy. The stage set are forming with various changes. I know, right? It looks really sexy. If composed well, the group dance should be good. Well said. The snake makes for a very charismatic dance. The subject is very good, but... Without Jason, I'm a little worried. Yeah, he's our group's trump card. Without Jason, we're like a fan without its blades. Underpants without their elastic. On the contrary, I think we're better off without him. Why? Team spirit is more important for this competition. With that in mind, people like Jason, who is so much better than the rest will end up becoming a burden. At this time, the group that has Jason must be having a headache. Look at those birds. Watching them, how do they fly? Like this, flapping its wings! It's not like this? Is this teacher a good dancer? Mmm... Take the movements you were doing just then - and combine them into a dance. - Has he choreographed a dance before? This choreography... Dancing and choreographing are completely different concepts. Ya, I can hear everything you're saying. Come here, come here. What's with you now? What's wrong with my dance? Oh Hyuk, you know I can dance right? Do you want to battle with me? You're not a child... Okay, let's test it out. Let's go. I don't want to. I don't compete with students. You're so funny... Let's just focus. Look at the bird, the bird. You look like a bird. Oh man.. Teacher Meng look at this. What? These are the results of the Half-Admission Class's end-of-month assessments. Take a look. Wow, that's amazing. The rate of improvement is frightening. If this goes on, don't you think they'll make it into the top class? That's right. Looks like the Director's judgment wasn't wrong. Mr. Kang is amazing! Looks like the Director kept Mr. Kang around for a reason. I know, right? It used to look like the Director was covering up for Mr. Kang. But now, Mr. Kang's principal seems rather hateful. Is Mr. Kang... channeling the spirit of the Director? His words and actions are exactly like those of the Director's. Hello everyone. Teacher. What time do you want to go practice today? Don't you have Japanese class at 4 today? That's so boring. It's more interesting here. Hey I've got some new moves. Sit over here. Why are you sitting there? The Principal's watching. Hurry and look at the front, the front. He's really something. A big strong body like that, but he only has the courage of a mouse. Ya, even though the words from your mouth aren't that great, but I possibly could be a genius. The dances I arrange might really be a work of art. There will be a male solo dance in the middle. When you jump, fly like a real bird. Simply awesome. Male solo dance? Solo dance, eh? Then my outfit should be specially prepared. Oh, that's right, this will highlight the solo dance. Is that right? How about getting that big piece of material to contrast with the atmosphere? This...cloth... This cloth idea is pretty good! What do you think? It seems like a good idea. Imagine in your head all the birds you have seen. Can you see the bird? Now imitate how the bird spreads its wings to soar. With that bird in mind... *Whistling* Yes, like that. Huh? Hey! What kind of bird are you thinking of? What kind of bird? Yours isn't even a bird. How are you dancing? Taryeong? (korean folk dance) You, come over here. Come on. Imagine your wings spreading out one by one. One, two, three... One, two. AHH! Ah, Hye Mi. What are you doing here? What else? Practicing dance. What if someone sees you? It's already past 12. Who would come? Also, are you also practicing secretly now? Mmm... Just before, I saw you practicing the solo dance. Am I right? You're right. There is a possibility... If I do it better than Jason, then I could do the solo. You doing the solo? What? You don't think it's possible? Yeah. A bit. You. Can't you even tell a white lie? Fine. You can do it. Forget it. You're angry. If I don't give up, even if there's no improvement... Then don't I have a chance? I will never give up. No matter what. You've been acting tough lately. Let's try to dance once. Ok, let's do that. They're in better condition than I expected. Don't you think they will win? It looks that way. President, it's already an hour past business hours. It's ok. Let them continue practicing. Today is Monday so there aren't any customers anyway. Yes. How are you doing, President Ma? It's been a while officer. What brings you here? I received a report. They look like students. Do you think it's ok that they are here at this time? They said they have nowhere to practice, So what am I supposed to do? I pitied them so I gave them permission. Even if you say that, because it was during business hours... it violates the Youth Protection laws so I cannot let you go. The children will be given a warning. But your business will be temporarily closed. Detective! For how many days? About 30 days. You kids can leave once your teacher comes. Which teacher from our school did you call? Are you from Kirin Arts Academy? Yes. Oh no, we're in trouble! What should we do? The police even said there wasn't a problem. It wasn't for anything other than practice. If there's a problem, it's because the school doesn't allow the Half-Admission class to use the practice rooms. Stop. That's not what I'm making an issue of. The reason I called you is about this. (The name on the card is Ma Du Shik) This is... This was found on the day of the showcase. It belongs to the person that rented the auditorium. President Ma Du Shik. I saw this person with your admission class at the police station. How will you explain this, Teacher Kang? What did you say? Can you hear? No. Maybe we can't enter the competition anymore. What are you doing here? Sir, are you alright? Of course. I was hard on him. You guys should've seen it. Once I unleashed my 10 speeches on him He couldn't do anything. How is that possible? I said it's the truth. Then, there won't be a problem with us going on stage? Of course not. But where can we go to practice? We can't go to the night club right? Yeah, that as well. All we need to do is finalize the choreography. We're practicing here? Isn't it great? There aren't that many customers around this time. And since I'm a regular, the president said we could turn on music. How about it? Let's try. It's not like we have any other options. Ok. Where's Jason? He said that he had a very important appointment today. So he'll just be at the final rehearsal. Then Sam Dong can fill in for the solo part for now. You know how it goes, right? Yes. Ok, I understand. I modified the end so follow my moves. Play the music. They're really good. We can, too? I think so. Don't be too worried. Come, we're going to prepare as well. Let's go. Jason, how come you didn't come to your last practice? The movements have changed. Please show me. The last part.. Jin Man.. About the solo dance, instead of Jason, why not let Sam Dong dance? What? Because we've changed the dance moves, Jason is not as familiar with it as Sam Dong is. It doesn't matter, if I don't remember, I'll make it up on the spot. Hey, this is his solo dance. How about it? Sam Dong, can you do it? That, I... This opportunity will go away once you hesitate. Okay, I'll do it. Being able to do it and doing it well are two different things. I am opposed to Sam Dong. I agree. Why are you being like this? Didn't you say if you won, they'll let you into the Art class? Don't you want that? You need to calm down and think carefully. I'm very calm. I pick Sam Dong. I've seen Sam Dong's solo dance. Then let's vote. Hye Mi and I pick Sam Dong. You've picked Jason. Pil Sook... What about you? I, I feel Sam Dong can dance well too. Hey. Then it's decided. Wha.. What? The solo dance isn't Jason's, but Sam Dong's? Yes. We've chosen Sam Dong, not Jason. He needs to be aware that talent does not win over hard work This is a lesson being taught to Jason. What? Although the intention is for a good purpose, it wouldn't be a problem to do this at school, but here, at this event... What was he thinking? Who said that it's not you? Teacher Kang is simply stubborn. You really are very smart. If I did the solo, we would have won for sure. Don't misunderstand. I'm not being greedy. No, if you did the solo... Then we may have not even been able to get 3rd place and we wouldn't have been able to enter the Arts class. What? You need to work very hard if you are going to be the solo dancer. You must be very angry because someone else snatched it, or because you didn't come 1st. Also, that day, during the showcase... You shouldn't have abandoned yours and came to mine. You're too distant. You have no dreams, no goals. Are you trying to teach me? No. I'm telling you this because I genuinely feel bad for you. I'm sorry if you're mad at me. You! I didn't want to say this at first because it's embarrassing... But why aren't you keeping your promise? Promise? Oh. The 200 day line. It was very hard for me to lose weight. I couldn't eat nor drink what I wanted. I nearly died and came back to life. And then when I thought about it-- about doing all that because of you... it felt like a waste. You have no desire, no dreams, no goal. I wonder if I did all that for someone who has no dreams, no goals. So, I gave it up. But because I am your fan... I am saying this can I help you gentlemen today? The three of us adults would like three tickets to Colombia, and you can put it on that man's card. South Carolina, that's what I'm talkin' about, man. I got cousins down there. That's good, man, but we're not going to South Carolina. Sir, I think he means the country of Colombia. Colombia! Vincent, are you crazy, man? That is the drug capital of the world. I'm black, they're gonna think I'm trafficking... click-click. Chill, dude, you'll be fine, man. Everybody knows the Valley's the drug capital of the world. Can I carry this on? [woman] Yes. [Kurt groans] Betcha they ain't even got black people in Colombia. I'm pretty sure the entire country was founded by black people. Right, you geniuses are all set. Have a wonderful time in the African nation of Colombia! How is he? Passed out. They found an empty row, just laid him on down there. Where did you get them clothes, man? Don't be laughing at my clothes, man. Stewardess gave me this. That boy slobbered all over my new shirt. Kurt can never catch a break, man. Ever. What? Do you want to look in the motherfucking mirror? All right, I admit I'm going through a transition right now. [chuckles] - Oh, that's funny, isn't it? - You goin' through a Tran... Vincent, we on a plane. Where we goin', and why? Man... you need to learn to relax. We are in first class, man. This is first class. Look at this! What the fuck up, Vincent? Promise you're not gonna get mad. First class! What the fuck's up? All right. You know, on the news, every day, that guy, Juan Garcia, in Colombia. You know who I'm talking about? The drug lord Garcia, chop your head off, yeah, him. Well, he doesn't necessarily chop your head off. I mean, we don't know that. That's what the news is telling us. All right? Listen to what I'm going to say. - I'm listening. - There is a 20... There is a $25 million reward for the capture of this dude. And what the fuck does that have to do with us? [whispering] $25 million. Are you out of your motherfucking mind, Vincent? He kill people, man. Your dog will be dead! The motherfucker kidnap families, take 'em over to Colombia and they never come back, man. I'm not talking about that. I'm just saying, let's do recognizance. That ain't even a word, "recognizance." We just go look and see what's happening from a distance. - From a distance? - From a distance. - Like a vacation. - Yeah. It is a vac... - In first class! - All right. I like living, know what I'm saying? Ain't nothing like breathing. I never heard a dead motherfucker come back... - Well, then breathe... -and say how good it is to be dead. Some of this. Is that them shrooms, motherfucker? - It is. - Chocolate marsh. Yeah, you don't have to yell to everybody. Yes, it is, my nigga, it is. This motherfuckin' trip just got a whole lot better, know what I'm sayin'? - [like Cosby] Have the pudding. - Hmm? It tastes a little different. He didn't get much time to put it together, he said. So... he had to substitute a couple of the ingredients. What did he substitute? Small shit, like butter. Butter? What did he replace the butter with? What did he say, hold on? Pee-otee? Pee-ot... Pay-ot... Pee-Ari. Peyote? ! That motherfucker fucked a fire hydrant butt asshole naked on that shit. On a Sunday, in front of the church. He said it was cool, man. If you can't trust your drug dealer, who are you gonna trust, man? He does this for a living. Did you hear what the fuck you just said? [kazoo plays] Chemistry lesson 101.

After a long flight, our hapless heroes arrive in Colombia, South America, which should be very interesting, as Vincent and Chris believe that Colombia is just another city in Mexico. Whoa! - [straining] - You got him? Yep. [Chris] Oh, man! Prop him up against here. Man, what is this? Ain't no black people here, man. You lied. I don't know about this shit, but... That is not what it looks like in the picture, right? - It says five stars. -Man, this ain't one star. This ain't a quarter moon. This place is nasty, man. All right, let's go. - Uh, what about Kurt, man? - What about him, man? We're in a foreign country, they love Americans. Dude'll be fine. We're Americans! [Vincent sighs] Three rooms, please. - Three rooms? - ¿Qué necesitas? ¿Qué necesitas? Something about a K and sisters. ¿Ah, necesitas una habitación para alquilar? Sólo tenemos una. - I don't know, bro. - You better know, man. You've been reading that damn Mexican travel guide ever since you was on the damn plane. Now, figure this shit out, man. It doesn't say anything about ordering a room, dude. It says, like, fuckin' plants and soccer and shit, that's it. - Like Escobar, you'd give him a room, wouldn't you? -Escobar? Yeah, Escobar. Like the soccer player. Like goal! [shouting in Spanish] [woman] iDios mío! What the fuck did you just do, Vincent? I don't know. Andrés Escobar is Colombia's best soccer player, says it right there. Man, let me see this. No damn wonder. This is 1992. This motherfucking magazine is 20 years old. No wonder she didn't understand what the fuck you talkin' about. - What is that? - Get y'alls skins! - Hey, yo, man, look! - It's a midget with a gat. You're Americans? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're cool, right? Americans. Why you singing praises to Pablo Escobar? We ain't praising' nobody but the Lord. We're God's children. We were sent here to build a small mission for the Lord... mission... for Jesus's children. And we don't know Pablo Escobar, bro. Put the gun down, please. Forgive her, she's getting senile in her later years. All right. Three rooms. Twenty American dollars. Only have one room and one bed. The hell with that. Come on, $20? Just get the room, man. Little dude's got a gat. We can get another hotel tomorrow. We only accept cash. You got a spa? It's never easy informing one of your friends that while he was in a drug-induced coma, his marriage ended. But hey, what are friends for? - [high-pitched weeping] - Fuckin' hug him. - Fuck you, you hug him. - I'm not... I had to tell him. I had to wipe the slobber off his face the whole flight down here while you were jacking off underneath the blanket. How did you know I was jacking off? - Smooth ripples in the blanket. - I should have used the jacket. Jackets are real smooth, got the material. When it get crunchy it don't wrinkle up. I ain't never done it myself but it's what I heard. - Good lookin' out, next time. - That's what's up. [murmuring] I think a drink is in order for you. So you thought bringing us to a Third World country was a good idea? To catch a fucking Colombian cartel drug lord? Are you mental? Keep it down, man. These people all look alike. They could be the cartel. [Kurt] He's trying to get us killed. You're gonna get us fucking killed, Vincent. Maybe it wasn't a well thought out plan, right, but we're here. So let's just do this. How could you let this happen? I didn't do shit. He told me we was coming on vacation. I didn't know we was gonna be doin' Rambo shit. Have you lost your mind? No, Kurt, you lost your mind, and your wife, your job and your dignity, all in, what, three hours? - I can testify to that. -I can't believe I'm getting a divorce. Just think about it. $25 million. $25 million. Do you know how much that is? $8,333,333.33 apiece. Motherfuckin' Rain Man. We're still gonna get killed. None of us know anything about capturing a drug lord. You can say that again. He know what he talkin' about. I didn't think of it like that. Everybody's got their thing, this is our thing. Kurt, wouldn't you like to show your ex-wife - Who said I was a loser? - [both] She did. - What a bitch. - And, Chris, wouldn't you like to throw a baseball with a kid that's actually yours? Yeah, that's funny. I'd like to do that one of these days. Come on, man, listen, if we go back to L.A. like this, broke, what do we got? We got shit. Listen, I'm goin', I'm doin' this. Now, who's with me? - Fuck it, I'm in. - Thank you. I'm still not sure why I'm even here. Hey, man, grow some nuts so the squirrel can climb up the tree and nibble on 'em. I'm not even sure that made sense, but you should listen to him. All right, I'm in. Let's do this, fuck it! And fuck that bitch! [Latin music plays] Got that shit, man, raise the roof! There are my Americano brothers! Come on, I take you to the other party with all the girls and cocaine you want... [slurring] I'm goin' with him. I'm goin' with him and him. He got pussy, man, you trippin'. Pussy is not a bad thing. That's what I'm saying, 'cause you guys are doing it all wrong. You need to package and combine these drugs for more efficient distribution. Hmm. Man, snap out of that grunting shit. Mmm... What? Hmm, I'm not grunting. Could have swore we were drunk. I'm still drunk. [sniffs] But I'm up, but I'm drunk. [sniffs] Yeah. This is Alaska right up here. This is Alaska. See all the snow? [chuckles] That's Canada. So we're gonna come in here, and come in here, and come over here. - Hmm. - Man, I need a gun. We need guns. Think about it, a .357 Magnum, if we're gonna do this. Man, fuck that baby shit. I need a AK-47. I could bust a cap in the motherfucker's ass. Ack-ack-ack. Ack-ack-ack-ack-ack! Ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack! You forgot one. Ack! [chuckles] - Ahem, titties. - Yes, they are. [Vincent grunting] Uh, I'm gonna go say hello to her two friends, tit and tat. No, no, no, no, we gonna say hello to tit and tat... We ain't doin' the "we." Ain't no sword-fightin', nuts ain't bouncing', no. No, no, no, we'll Eiffel Tower her, man. I don't wanna touch your balls either, man. We get on each end. I'm not making a porno. I'm going in here and fuck. I think it's London Bridge, man. We'll London Bridge her! Oh. [sniffing] Hello. ¿Cómo estás? - Mm. - Vamos. OK. [Chris clears throat] [Kurt] If you could smuggle less by sea and more by air... here, in this, uh... [giggles] in this vicinity right here, you could attack the United States where they least expect it. - Jesus! - Enough. How do you know so much about... marketing cocaine? I... I don't know anything. Oh, you've been teaching everybody like school children. No, I just know business. I'm a... It's not like it's rocket science. It's actually common sense. Oh, so you're calling me stupid! No, no, no, I don't... I don't even know you. [slams knife] I don't know when I've been so disrespected in my own homeland! [Kurt] But... Am I such a man that should be treated like this? No. You know what? I don't think I should be the one that should be... discussing your fate. I think maybe we should take him to... Garcia. Juan Garcia, no, no. I haven't got... fate? I don't need to see him. Get him. Can't we talk about this? [murmuring] I'm really sorry! I didn't mean to! That's what I'm talkin' about. You Mexican girls are hot! I'm not fucking Mexican. Oh, well, whatever. That's what I'm talking about. - Oh, shit! Fuck! - Aaah! She's got a fuckin' dick! Damn, I was just about to bust! You better be... Fuck! Aaah! Shit. Goddamn, man! I just passed a chick with a dick. I know, man, I touched her fucking ass! - You touched her ass? - I did! Oh, goddamn, man, eh! It's gonna be all right. Man, this is a freak scene. That shit make me gay? No, just... alternative. Man, I don't want any more fucking cocaine! All right, man, don't do no more blow! My friend ain't gay! So, she had a dick? You didn't touch it, you didn't... - Did you suck it? - No. All right, 'cause I was gonna... Kurt! They got Kurt, man! They got a gun to his head! Come on, man. Let that shit go! Would you like cream and sugar with your coffee, Mister...? Oh, Mr. Pomeroy. Kurt. Kurt Pomeroy. And I'll take Splenda, if you have it. Do you know who I am, Mr. Pomeroy? I've, um... I've seen news reports about you in America. How do they portray me? They say that you're a... Your business is the cause of a lot of violence, both here in South America and in North America. So I've heard. Let me say this, Mr. Pomeroy. Long before our country learned how to capitalize on our largest export, we were a nation in despair. A very poor country where industry would have never existed or jobs, or schools, as we have today, without cocaine. The United States suffers from a disease you Americans call multiple personality disorder. I'm not sure I follow you. [Garcia] I will explain. The State Department in Washington sends down a representative every few months. They work out a special deal with us. They give us a free route, where we can bypass the Mexican distribution and sell our products straight to the streets. Now, not having to deal with the Mexicans quadruples our earnings and keeps me from having to deal with those dirty, uneducated field mice, as I like to call them. Then... the United States' other personality appears. And they send down a representative calling off all deals and demanding money from me. Now, I call that extortion, Mr. Pomeroy. But there's nothing I can do about that. Yet. Why exactly am I here? My associate here, Mr. Diego, he knows more about this business than anyone that I know. He overheard you tonight, apparently sharing a great wealth of information on how to improve our business. And I want to find out what that is. No, I really, I don't know. I don't know anything. One more time... and I'm going to sew your lips shut with your hair. [Garcia] Mr. Pomeroy, let us take a walk outside. [chairs creaking] As you know from doing business in America, loss is something you cannot tolerate. Oh, my God, no. No. Now Mr. Diego will take you into the study. There you will find a stack of files that he will explain just enough to get you started. W-what if I said no? Well, I will show you. Mátalo. [whimpering] God, no! No! No! No! Good night, Mr. Pomeroy. She had a dick! [guard speaking Spanish] Well, what the hell is you sayin', pig? Get up! Colonel Andreas will see you now. Brilliant. What do I owe the honor of being woken up in the middle of the night by one of my soldados speaking about a kidnapping? Our friend got kidnapped. He got taken away in a Jeep. That's why we came here. Hombres... you're not answering my question. Why did you two come into my station at 4 a.m., yelling, screaming, demanding that I be woken up? ! I... El kidnappo, kidnappay. Like we just told you. Our friend got taken and we're trying to get him back. - [Chris] Hey, hey, look, man. - [car door slams] Our friend was taken in a Jeep. I know damn well he ain't outside that window, man. Why are you wasting our time? We've been here... Chris, fucking chill. Third World country. You should listen to your friend, Mr. Christopher. That way you might make it out of this country sitting in the seat of a plane and not a wooden box. [Chris] Look, you took me out of context, man. You know, I have a problem when I get hot. You know, I have a mental thing that happens, and it's kind of like Tourette's... motherfucker! You know, so, uh... shit! Sorry. Sir. I cannot help you. You need to head to Bogotá and see someone in the US embassy. They will be able to help you. Carlos. [speaking Spanish] - This way, let's go. - No, we're not done here. - [shouting in Spanish] - [Carlos] Yes, I've got a gun! - You can put that down. - Go, go! IRápido, vamos! - Is this some Mexican boardroom? - Hey, what are we doing here? You're in some shit already just by coming to the station last night. They know! Who knows? - Garcia cartel. - The cartel! Keep your voices down! They're everywhere, even in this Policía station! How do they know who we are? You two idiots came in here yelling at the top of your lungs about some kidnapping. They would kill me if anyone found out I was telling you this, so listen carefully. You're going to go to the embassy and tell them about your American friend. Tell them he's being held by... one Armando Garcia of the Garcia cartel. They will start a negotiation for his release in two or three months. Two or three months? Are you crazy? They got him now! You have no other choice. Now that they know you're here, they will kill you, sure enough. Why you want to help us? My people have lived in fear of cartel regimes over 30 years. The United States is our only hope on stopping them and their murderous ways. Having an American kidnapped will bring exposure to this and help with our efforts. There's gotta be another way. - I may know someone. - Who? There's this guy. He's a former American Special Forces unit guy. He's very local. Name is Jon Waters. He lives in the old church in the middle of the village. Oh, and another thing. This is Colombia, not Mexico. We're not Mexican, you imbeciles! Wait a minute. How do we get in touch with you? You don't. [speaking Spanish] What did he just say? I think he said we're fucked. What the fuck. Man, you always getting me in some shit! [Garcia] Very, very, very, very... Oh, very good! Yes, oh! The US involvement. [chuckles] Very good, Mr. Pomeroy. I see you and I are going to have a very fruitful business relationship. You, my friend, are going to be very rich. Uh... with all due respect, Mr. Garcia, I, uh... I have a wife and a job back in L.A. I, uh... I can't stay here. Mr. Pomeroy. Your wife filed for divorce in a Los Angeles courtroom yesterday afternoon. And as for your job... my associate informed me that you no longer have one. You see, Mr. Pomeroy, information is extremely valuable in our business. You have spies? No. We have Google. Now, why don't you just make yourself comfortable? Make yourself at home, Mr. Pomeroy. The choice to stay is not yours. But your choice to live. Yes. Come. Come. Come! Please. I want you to check out the view. You may find it somewhat... meaningful. Oh, God! My God! Even in a moment of sheer terror at what he had just witnessed, no man can resist the mysterious and majestic beauty of the punani. - This has gotta be it. - Looks like the place to me. What do you think "fuck off" means? It means don't come in the motherfucker but knock anyway. [man] Go away! My name's Vince, this is Chris. We're looking for Jon Waters! [Jon] How do you know my name? What do you want? Look, Policía Carlos sent us over here, man. We're just looking for help! [Jon] I don't know no Carlos. Fuck off! Come on, man, our friend got kidnapped by the cartel! [both] Ohh! Hey, that's my manhood you got that shit pointing at. Jon, put away the fucking guns, man, we're cool! - What the fuck is going on? - IDs now. Come on, Jon, we're cool. [Jon] Hey, you're Americans. No shit, can we just come in? Boy's a genius. Come on, get in there! This motherfucker's in his underwear. All right, take a seat, tell me your story. [Chris] Man, this makes South Central look like Beverly Hills. [Jon grumbling] - [dish shatters] - Oh, well. [clears throat] Tell me your story. All right, we came out here on vacation. We went to a party. Cartel members kidnapped our friend. We were told that you can help us. You want me to light that dog dick you puffin' on? I don't smoke. How do you know it's the cartel? The guy at the police station told us... Heh heh heh heh heh! - What are you doing? - Ha. You can't go to the police. Are you fucking crazy? They don't do anything. I tried to tell him, man. I got warrants, I told you. The police stations are connected all over the world. They got computers now. Thank you, my fellow negro. I came here in '89. With Special Ops Division. Dropped us in the jungle 30 clicks south of Medellin. Did you just eat that? We've been out here for an hour. Special search and destroy mission for Pablo Escobar. - The soccer player, thank you. - Who? No, man, I'm talking about Pablo Escobar, the most dangerous drug lord in the world. You short bus recipient. That's why the lady was crying at the hotel. How am I supposed to know there's more than one person in Colombia named Escobar? Are you sure he did not play soccer? Man, I don't know. So there we were, waiting for our orders. But they didn't come. Some asshole in Washington decided to push it back, so weeks turned into months, months turned into years, and next thing you know, finally the order comes through. And, man, we were ready. And we went in there, quieter than a virgin's queef. And we took him out on the roof of his own home. [chuckles] Yeah, but then again, some yahoos in Washington decided... to give credit for a job well done to the Colombian army. Now, those monkeys... Excuse the expression... Wouldn't have been able to find Pablo Escobar if he was hiding in their own jock strap. Yeah, well... So I've been waiting here ever since to take down the cocaine cartel. - You want some? - Yes, I do. What is it? - Urine. - It's what? - You drinking your own piss? - Oh, hell no! [laughter] I couldn't fill this up by myself. No, I got a couple of guys who go to the bars downtown and fill it up fresh. Gives your skin a really nice glow. You'd understand that. Can you help us or what, bro? Let me ask you a question. Do you want help getting your friend back or do you wanna take down the cartel? Look, man, we're willing to do whatever it takes. We just don't wanna die, if you know what I'm saying. We like being alive. OK. I will train you. [rapping table] But, boys, now is the time where you make the decision to be man enough to call yourself soldiers. Because once you go into this thing, there is no turning back. Once you awaken the beast, you better have the balls to slay him. "Dinner at the Garden. I will send for you. Maria." Hmm, what's that? "Don't even think about cancelling." [playing "Greensleeves"] I cannot believe that you did that to your best friend. He probably wanted to kill you. Oh, he did. Vincent hates it when you mess with his hair, let alone shave it. But enough about him. What do you call this again? - Carne con salsa de tamarindo. - It's the best one I've had. - What did I tell you? Right? - Oh, my God. Why do you speak such good English? Well, I was born here in Colombia, but I was educated in the States. Actually, spent most of my life in New York City. But I got pretty homesick so I decided to come back to be with my father. That's... that's really sweet. I like you, Kurt. I really like you, too, Maria. And I'm honored that a woman as beautiful as you would want to have a dinner like this with me. But I'm a little concerned about your father and some of his men. Have you seen what goes on here? It's not always that pretty. Listen, my father gives these men opportunities that they would have never received anywhere else in this country. He gives them a chance at a good life, you know? I'm pretty sure I saw a man ripped in half today. They're not always appreciative as they should be. It's sad. I weep for them. I just want you to know that I respect your father. I mean, I... I respect him. A lot. [speaking Spanish] Gracias. It doesn't sounds as nice when he says it. [rooster crows] Goddamn, man, my head fucking is killing me. Hey, morning'. Whose idea was it to drink moonshine? I didn't drink it, man. You and old boy was up singing and dancing like y'all was best friends forever. You do realize this dude's bat-shit crazy, right? Pretty much. I'm telling you, Vince, this is like some movie shit. And I know how this story goes. How does the story go? Man, you ain't never seen them Harrison Ford movies? You know, he starts out in Washington. Then he comes down to South America. Next thing you know, all his friends get blown up by rockets and shit. Keep going. They probably already took his ID out his wallet, right? Found out his address. They probably sent a hit man to his crib in L.A. and killed his wife Brenda. Let's just go to the embassy, all right? It's not like this GI Joe motherfucker gonna be able... What the fuck? ! Never underestimate the element of surprise. First lesson: always be aware of your surroundings. That was a lesson? Yes, it was. And training day is just about to begin. [mouthing words] So you stayed up all night painting yourself like your wall? Affirmative. Maria and Kurt had grown quite fond of one another, but when you're the daughter of the world's most notorious drug lord, nothing remains a secret for long. - Maria! - Luis. You should have told me you were going to leave the grounds, especially in front of our new employee. Luis, always a comandante. [speaking Spanish] Kurt, this is one of my father's men, Luis Diego. Yep, we've had the pleasure of meeting. He showed me his knife collection. We need to talk to Señor Kurt. Talk to him. Not here, in private. You can talk to him here in front of me and everybody else. No, it's OK. Are you sure? Yeah. I'll be fine. Carlo. Hey! Uhh! Stay! I got this! Ow! Now, Mr. Pomeroy, are you enjoying Garcia's daughter? Whoa. That sounds like a loaded question there, buddy. [speaking Spanish] I believe that in America... the word "buddy" means we're amigos. We are no way amigos, you gringo bastard. ¿Me entiendes? Yeah... I get it. Not... not buddies. Who are your friends... at the Policía station asking all the questions? I don't know anyone else here. Ohhh! OK... OK. They're harmless. All right? I can talk to them. Just let me talk to them, and I'll keep them quiet. I'll get them to stop talking to the police. Policía is no longer the problem. Oh, my God! What the hell is wrong with you people? Is killing all you know? - What? OK. - Let me tell you this. When I find your two amigos, I am going to cut their tongues out if they are lucky. If you touch them, I'll kill you! [chuckles] OK! Gentlemen, welcome to my training ground. You know what we're gonna do here, a little agility training, a little bit of speed, and maybe some weapons capability, see if we can turn you into some soldiers. How's that sound? - It's cool. - It's cool, man, let's do it. That's cool, man, let's do it... Sir! - [cocking gun] - All right, let's go over here. Yes, sir. Come on, come on! Swing it! Aaaaah! Why would you own such a device? ! Be a man about it! [Vincent sobbing] Climb over a wall. [Vincent] Aaaah! Ugggh! Climbin'! There's the enemy, Vincent. That's the bomber, get it! [firing] What? Right here we got Niger. Niger runs right across the same latitude as Colombia, right there. What you gonna do when they come after you? That isn't how to kill a bird. What are you doin', man? ! The line goes down here like that. Hey! That's where you're comin' in. Right, and then if he's coming in here, then he's gotta go in there. - Right, right here. - He's right in there. - [Vincent] Right. - [Jon] You search for him. [Vincent] But if he's gonna be over here... Go! [Jon] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! [indistinct shouting] - [Vincent laughing] - You bitches! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [both chuckle] [chuckles] It is my honor to go into battle with you. You are my brethren. And one of our own is captive by the poison that is the cartel. We need to rescue our friend. We need to bring him back to the nest. Let's do it. Hoo-yah! [all] Haaaa! All right, gentlemen, let me get a picture for posterity. I just have to say one thing. There's only one thing you need to know to keep from getting killed in battle, OK? And that rule is, you must never, and I mean never... - [chickens squawking] - [Vincent] Oh, my God! God damn! Oh, my God, I'm gonna throw up! Man, this shit is fucked up. We ain't cut out for this shit, Vincent. Don't even go there, man. This is what Jon trained us for. It's not like the movies like you're always talking about. It's not like we're gonna show up, man, and there's gonna be a mansion with guys in suits and Uzis and shit. We'll go in there and kick the door down L.A. style. Man, why you bullshittin' yourself and me? That motherfucker was Special Forces, Marine Corps, crazy son of a bitch, and he got killed by a Mexican bitch in a motherfucking chicken truck. Man, have you ever seen Breaking Bad? Two regular dudes, right? Come on. Then they became bad asses and started capping' people. That's exactly what we could do. That was a TV show. And it took 'em four seasons to become bad asses. I've been a screw-up, bro, ever since we were kids, man. I've never achieved anything I set out to do, and I know that, man, I just kept bullshittin' people. But right now, if I don't go get Kurt back, this is all my fault, man, this is my chance. This is your chance, man. What have you got to go back to? Come on, man, you look good. Look at you. You're holding guns and shit. All right, I hear you, motherfucker, you know. We do got guns and shit. Shit, I got a couple of grenades right here. That's what I'm... Do you even know how to use those things? No, but I can hit a motherfucker in the head long-distance. [speaking Spanish] What's he saying? I think he's saying we can pick up the dead body now. What do you mean, man? He's not going anywhere. We'll get him when we come back. - [flies buzzing] - [Vincent] Think about it. Let's get the fuck out of here. With their fearless leader now roadkill, Vincent and Chris continue on their quest to rescue Kurt. I'm tired, man. This must be it. Why don't you make a fire, man, and I'll shoot some food. Man, you truly are an ignorant motherfucker. Why don't you just shoot a flare in the air so they can come over here and kill us? - I don't understand. -Garcia's house is up the hill, fool. I don't know anything about this woods shit, man. I refused to be in the Boy Scouts growing up. - Fuck that. - Refused? - [Chris laughs] - [Vincent] Yeah. What you got against the Boy Scouts of America? You better think about it. All those old men taking them young boys to the woods, not allowing any little girls to go... Teaching them to "tie knots" and be "Webelos." Hmm-mm. Whole thing sounds like an underground gay farm to me, I'm out. That's the smartest shit you said all week. - We've got a special sauce. - Piss-off. Look at this, man. Shed some light on the subject. - That'll work, that'll work. - Jackpot. Food. That's what I'm talkin' about. You know what? This dude's got forks. - Thank you. - That's what I'm talkin' about. He might be dead, but he was a, uh... he was a proper dead man, leaving his friends some stuff. - Look, man, don't play hard-ass. - What you talkin' about, man? You have not talked about your wife leaving you one time this entire trip. Come on, now. You need... You need me to hug you? Do you want me to... I will... You see that? You can put your head right there. Love is a four-letter word, like fuck and shit. Just something you gotta do. [boom! ] I was in love once. Shoot him, man, shoot him! He's a fuckin' zombie! I remember it like it was yesterday. She was the most beautiful girl in the world. It was in Vietnam. And the minute we looked into each other's eyes... it was love. We were going to love each other forever. [gun cocks] [gunshot, body falls] Yeah, of course, I only knew her for 15 seconds. [gunmen shouting in Vietnamese] She was my opponent in a Russian roulette game. She lost. - Aaaaah! - [trigger clicks] What was her name? I'm gonna call her Biglet. Biglet! [sobbing] I tried to put her brains back in her head, but... that doesn't always work. [Vincent] Hardly ever. Man, your motherfucking ass was dead. He's right, man, you were dead. I can't die. You was dead, motherfucker. You got hit by a chicken truck. You guys want to get to business now? OK, first I gotta pee. When we approach the mansion, we got to approach from the east side. There's an outcropping of rocks. It's great cover. And, as I was trying to tell you before I got run over by a chicken truck... [explosion] [coughing] [man] Señor Garcia, we all want the same things. But your new associate here is asking for things that are not reasonable. [Garcia] Not reasonable? Mr. Pomeroy just spent the last hour explaining the newest and the best option to cut our distribution losses by 75%. And you say it's not reasonable. [Garcia scoffs] [chuckles] Felix, your men are imbeciles. Yes, they our cowboys with no class. And your country is killing our distribution because you idiots are killing each other like a bunch of uneducated Compton gang members. No... No, you have no control over your men. Your ignorance is putting all of us and our money at risk. Señor Garcia, you do not know how difficult it is to move product in Mexico now. We have to open up the lines of distribution by using force. You wanted a bigger cut so you stopped selling us your cocaine and started leasing us to move it for you. If you don't like the way we do business, we could go back to buying your product wholesale. That way you would not have to worry about the distribution. Very, very interesting. Felix Santos is telling me how to run my business. You Mexicans. You're just a pawn in this chess game. The problem is that you all want to be kings. Right here is your king. Don't forget who your king is. [Felix] Juanito. You do not realize how important we are to your... "kingdom." Without us, you will be struggling to even get your product into the United States. And you, Mr. Pomeroy... [chuckles] your idea of 25747s into Canada and then rerouting them into the southern states, it's... it's too costly. Maybe you're right. Maybe we will lose less product overall, but we need more manpower as it is. But, Juan, must you not forget that battling the three-headed monster that is the United States is hard enough. If you choose to disrespect me, and our efforts, you will be adding one more head to that monster. King, learn to respect your pawns, for they are the largest army on the chess board. Luis, I think Mr. Santos and his body guards have overstayed their welcome. [Luis] Consider it done. [Garcia] Gracias. [fingers snap] Mr. Pomeroy, tomorrow morning we are going to Mexico City to meet our new distribution. [Kurt, whispering] Maria! - Maria! - Kurt. Look, uh... - We're going horseback riding, want to join us? - Horses? No, no. Absolutely not. Look, there's been a problem. I, uh... I just saw your father and Felix Santos, they got into an argument, and I'm pretty sure Diego is on his way to kill Santos and his men. Did you not just hear what I said? Yeah, you were rambling on about Santos or something. - Do you not like me anymore? - I like you so much. I mean, you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. It's just that... these people, they're killing each other on a daily basis and... it's insane. You are so cute when you're nervous. Well, you... you remember my two friends I told you about? - Uh, Vincent and Christopher? - Your gringos? Those gringos, the ones that have been going to the police and telling them about me being missing 'cause I'm here. Uh, and I'm pretty sure that Diego is gonna either kill them or the United States is gonna send someone here to find me. Either way, it's gonna end bad for us. My father will handle them all. You are safe here. I don't want them handled, I want them alive, they're my friends! You don't need them anymore. You have a new family here. Now, let's go horseback riding. Uh... I gotta go change. I'll be right back. [sighs] I'm gonna have to kill him. Aren't I? Oh, Blanca... probably. [rapping on truck] [Chris, whispering] Which way we headed? This things says north. So like northwest right there. That should be it. Hey, man, look. Moss grows on the north side of the trees. Learned that in Boy Scouts. Well, why don't you go look for some fuckin' moss on the north side of the trees and I'm gonna use technology, and we'll meet there? I'll never find your ass. Look, man, I somehow got service. I can't get it in the middle of L.A., but I damn sure get it out here, I'm using this. Unbeknownst to our heroes, the Colombian army was already mobilizing against the cartel. [speaking Spanish] Fuck, fuck, fuck! What, you mental midget motherfucker? Thought there weren't gonna be nobody in suits and shit. Who fuckin' thought they'd be walkin' around in suits, man? You think a guy's job, he goes home, changes clothes, and goes, "Fuckin' relieve the next guy who walks around in a suit with an Uzi"? You got a problem, man. You got a motherfucking problem. This look like a Scarface reunion up in here, man. We ain't built for this shit, I'm tellin' ya. I'm bouncin', I'm gettin' the fuck up outta here. [whispering] No, man. Shut up. It's a Mexican on a bicycle, man, with a box. Let me see that. Let me see the motherfuckers, man. Here, hold this. Stay on point, man. - I trained with this gun. - Shut the fuck up. Pull the trigger, that's all, it's a gun. Bang-bang, motherfucker. I'll be goddamn. Sellin' a box of oranges at a motherfucking cartel crib. Gimme the gun. [Vincent] What the fuck is that? - I don't know, man. - Play dead, play dead! Play dead? This your motherfucking idea of "play dead"? I didn't come here to do a no motherfucking Machiavelli. - Shut the fuck up! - You mensch. Mensch! Just laying you down into this motherfucking shit. - OK. - Motherfucker. Like we been trained, let's kill somebody. Somebody got to die with this bitch. [Chris] Where'd he go? They pulled out a freakin' head. They pulled a fuckin' head out. Hold the gun, motherfucker. We need an extra brain, motherfucker. Let's go get the head. Maybe he can think of some better shit. A dead man think better planning. Just go, crawl, crawl! Come on! Diego. What? What the hell? Vincent, Christopher! You guys are gonna get yourselves killed. Hey! Maria! Maria! Hi! I need to talk to her, just for a second. Maria... Holy shit, you look amazing. I love leather and Japanese anime. [gunfire] That's, um... That's a Mexican cartel. They killed Diego. We have to get out of here. I know, that's why I'm preparing to kill Santos myself. Wait, sit down, sit down. My friends are here, all right? You can come with us. You, too. Or not. - Your friends? - Yeah, Vincent and Christopher? They're alive, all right? Come with us, I'll protect you. You dirty gringos. You think you can come here and take our business and our home? What? It's not like that at all. [speaking Spanish] [screaming] Yaaaa! [machine-gun firing] Kurt, come on! Come on so we can get the hell outta here! - Come on! - [Kurt screeching] - [Kurt] Oh, my God! - [Chris] Keep your head down. Vincent, this is the craziest thing you've ever done to us! Get me outta here! Who the fuck is the crazy bitch shooting at us? Oh, that's Juan Garcia's daughter. We're in love; we had the most amazing connection. You got a sick motherfucking mind. You fall in love with the biggest bitch down here, just like back home. I do not think this is the appropriate place or time to be talking about this. Shut the fuck up, somebody's gotta shoot her! - I love her. -You do realize this bitch is trying to kill us? - She's just a little confused. - Well, then text the bitch and tell her to quit fucking shooting at us! I don't even have her number. Chris, you said you could throw a grenade like a baseball, right? Motherfuckin' Satchel Paige. Throw it! - A grenade? - Here, hold this. Shut up, man, he won't pull the pin. - Seriously? - Seriously. You're not gonna hurt her, right? I'm gonna bean the bitch and knock her the fuck out. Listen, I'm gonna create a diversion. You know what a diversion is? Yeah, that's when one motherfucker do some crazy shit so this motherfucker can hit the bitch. Yeah. Aaaaaah! Fuck you, bitch! [clang! ] - Oh! - Oh! Uh-huh! - Oh, fuck! - What was that? - Aaaah! - Get the fuck down! You just fuckin' blew that pussy up! [laughing] - That's Juan Garcia! - That's him? - That's the man! - The money! Go! Move! Wait for me! Put the gun down! Put the fucking gun down! Put it down! - [Chris] Did you see that? - We don't... - Goddamn! - You a killer now, motherfucker. Come on, let's go, this way! [gunfire] Goddamn, we're becoming bad asses. This is fuckin' fun! Hey, watch your motherfucking gun! Come on! [shouting indistinctly] [Chris] Where are you going, motherfucker? Maria! - You all right, man? -No, but throw the other grenade! [Kurt] Get up! [Vincent] Get it, Chris! IBomba! Stay here, on the ground! [Garcia] iBomba, Bomba! Freeze, motherfucker, freeze! Now, you can calm down, man. Think we got him. They did it. These three nitwits... Uh, I mean heroes... Actually captured the world's most wanted criminal. I'm not even sure there's anybody left. No, we killed all these motherfuckers. Maybe we should, uh, call the embassy. Yeah. Yeah, it's that time. I think you motherfuckers need to call an ambulance, man. [Chris] Hey, man, get in the back, man. Get up! Get up, motherfucker, get up! - [Garcia] All right. - [Chris] You heard the man. Where is Maria? [Vincent] No! Get the fuck back! - Where am I goin'? - You're standing right here. - I got him. Get in. - What are you doing? Don't be shoving that motherfucker on me! - [Chris] Go on, get in. - Maria! - What did you do to my Maria? - [Chris] Your Maria's dead! I got that bitch's pussy in my pocket, I'm gonna fuck it later. - [Garcia, sobbing] Maria! - [Vincent] Sit down! [helicopter hovering] So that is when Mr. Pomeroy decided to stay in Colombia and now runs one of the most controversial drug cartels in history. Yes, the Brighter Day cartel still produces and distributes cocaine but they do it in a very different way. Most of the money is used to build better schools and housing in the countries of Mexico and Colombia. A logo for the cartel, a new marketing department, employee benefits... makes this not your everyday cartel. The Brighter Day cartel is estimated to have surpassed all other cartels in total revenue, although specific numbers will never be released to the public. In parting, we asked Kurt Pomeroy why he does what he does. I would ultimately say I get high helping others, because others got high. - [Chris chuckles] - So there you have it... [Vincent] Looks good with a mustache, don't he? [Chris] Yeah, he does, man. I like that. [narrator] So, there you have it. One of the greatest stories ever told. Well, not really. But I'm sure you'll find some moral to this story that you can live your life by, or some such nonsense. And if not, honestly, who really gives a shit? [female reporter] Fazi is the newest leader of the Taliban in Afghanistan and now number one on the United States' most-wanted list. A reward for tens of millions of dollars is being offered for his capture. US officials say Fazi should be considered extremely dangerous. - What's wrong? - And now in other news... Yo, you hear this? Yeah, I heard it. You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? I think you have lost your mind. You got shot! - Who cares? We're still here. - Vincent! It ain't happening, man. Why can't you just enjoy the money? Man, are you not surrounded by some beautiful girls because of it? That's exactly why I don't want to do what I think you're thinking about us doing. I'm gonna stay right here with the beautiful ladies. I need deep tissue before the retarded child comes up with another idea that I ain't down with, by the way. I'm just asking you to think about it.

Hollow Sky's been alerted to a young man with special abilities. Your services are required. Am I the first girl to be brought up to your bedroom? One of the gazillion things I missed was... hangin' out with girls. There, I said it. The people that killed my brother are after your son. I need your help. Ian agreed to wait up for Holden with me. That's a kind gesture. Doesn't go unnoticed. I know we had something. That's what matters. It's not just about us. It was all so I could go back in. - For him, for Arthur? - It's complicated. Let me know when you un-complicate it. I'm looking for Holden. He's not here. This is my number. Could you tell him to call me? The year I went into my coma, I was supposed to visit this telescope in Colorado. Of course I never got to see it. Wait, is it the emperor or the prince in the carriage? - The prince, c'mon. Keep up. - Okay. So the... the prince is traveling through the countryside? In disguise, yeah. He wants to see how common folk will treat him, if they don't know he's royal blood. But what he realizes is he actually likes being special. Problem is, by the time he returns to the Forbidden City, his father, the emperor, had died, and no one will recognize him as the crown prince. So he has to just go on living the rest of his life as a regular Joe... er, Xiao. I feel like I'm supposed to be taking something from this. You say you want a normal life. I do wanna have a normal life. Nobody wants to have a normal life. And what... what the hell is normal anyway? For starters, not... going into a 12-year coma. Not... setting houses on fire with my mind. - Or... - Super powers? 'Cause you're special. I'm not special and they're not... super powers. Okay, what would the normal 25-year-old Holden Matthews be doing in his normal life right now? I would... you know, graduated college. Have a job. Building telescopes. You know and... maybe even build one to send to outer space like the Hubble. I... I built a telescope when I was 13, the summer before. God, when you talk like that, all enthusiastic and smart, I... I just... I just wonder is there really no limit to your space nerdiness? Thanks. Oh, my God, did you see that milkshake? - You want one? - Oh... yes! No, no! It's... it's like a million calories. Don't think you have to worry about calories. You haven't seen me naked. So... speaking of not-normal, I dare you to totally blow these normal people's minds right now. And how would I do that? Do something subtle, like, change the god-awful music on that jukebox. C'mon. Let's get psionic up in this bitch. Okay. Okay. Remember, focus on a specific point. - Stare inside it. - Shh! I'm workin' on it. Oh, yep, we should bounce now. Go, go... go, go! Oh, my God, that was amazing! I was trying to change the music, not cause a blackout! Blackout's way better, dude! Got you somethin'. C'mon, you know you want it. Couple sips is only like 25,000 thousand calories. Mmm! Let's go! So he just lit out in the middle of the night? It wasn't the middle of the night. He asked if they could go and I said yes. What's at Mt. Remick? 350 miles away. Remember that observatory that he talked nonstop about when he was a kid? Who's the girl? Charlie, she's very sweet. Who... who's Charlie? Apparently your brother took off on a road trip with some girl named Charlie. Huh. Yeah, first it was Jamie and then Willa, and... - Who's Jamie? - Who's Willa? Or was it Willa first? So, what, you just let him leave, Mom? I didn't just let him leave, he's 25 years old. - We gave him a truck. - Which needs a new timing chain. And I'm not gonna stop him from catching up on some of the things that he missed. I worry about him, too. I'm really late for work. That is old. Do you have a reservation? No, uh... is that a problem? Oh... I just got a cancellation on Cabin 4. Great! Um... we'll take it. If you don't, somebody else will! If you could just sign my ledger here, Mr. and Mrs.... Matthews. Mr. and Mrs. Holden Matthews. Of Fort Reed, Kansas. We're newlyweds. Kansas, huh? Beautiful country. You been? No. Uh, but my sister-in-law... my former sister-in-law... she spoke very highly of the Buckeye State. - Jayhawk State. - Come again? Nothing. Um... the cabin, it's, uh... it's got two beds? Why would we need two beds, dear? Unless you're expecting company on our honeymoon? - Um... - Boy, she's funny. She's... she is great, um... - What do you want? - You don't call, you don't write. How's our project coming along? I don't... I don't know what you think Holden can do, or what Frost wants with him, but... I've been looking over my shoulder ever since I woke up, and I'm not gonna do that to Holden. I shoulda told you in Monte Carlo what I'm telling you now: you can go... You like him. How adorable. But that doesn't change our deal. You help bring in Holden, and we help you get Arthur. Arthur will get what's coming to him, Holden or no Holden. You might want to rethink your position. Oh, is this where you tell me that you'll get your hooks in Holden with or without my help? No. This is where I tell you a story about a bright 15-year-old in Oregon, named Annabelle. I... I don't... I don't know who that is. You don't remember the foster sister you befriended back in the day? You are still paying for her posh boarding school, aren't you? - Stay away from Anna. - I would hate to see her thrust back into the inner city foster care system you're so familiar with. I will kill you! I will destroy Hollow Sky, I will burn down the entire building and everybody in it! Now, Charlie, is that any way for you to talk to an old... God... dammit! Ohhh! God! Sorry if I sounded distracted, I... I can't say I expected your call. Can't really say I... expected you to answer. Is everything okay... with Holden? I don't... know... how to say this, so I'm... I'm just gonna say it. Who the hell are you, and... and what do you want with my brother? Me, I... we're just friends. See, uh... I can tell a bad liar from a good liar. And you're terrible. Look, I'm helping with Holden's rehab. Holden quit physical therapy weeks ago. Do you wanna go for strike three, or do you just wanna skip to the truth? Holden drew these, and... and you know what they are. Don't you? This... is where your brother was... when he was in his coma. Wh... what are you...? But that's crazy. Sounds crazy, but... more than that, you need to ask him. I'm sorry. So what're we looking for? The main event is Mercury in retrograde. It'll look like the planet is actually moving backwards. But it's... not? No, but it does slow down. See, it's the only planet whose orbit speed changes, so, Earth is moving the same speed while Mercury slows down, so it seems like it's moving... backwards. - Ohh. - Okay. C'mere. Take a look. Okay. Look for the brightest object in the sky above the moon. Oh, yeah, I see it. I... I think, maybe. - Maybe. Uh... - Don't worry. Once we go inside and look through the big telescope, it'll be like we're looking right out the window. Then what are we doing out here with this rinky-dink telescope? You mean the telescope I made? - Uh-oh. - Hi, excuse me? Uh, we wanted to check out the Cassegrain telescope inside, is there... a line or a sign-in sheet? Unfortunately, we retired the 1/2 meter reflector from the public use about three years ago. Okay, wait, wait... wait, wait... hold... hold on... Brett. My say she's human, going by the life-support software. She climbed out of the suit like she forced her way out. She must be incredibly strong. I see you accessed our files. Do you understand yet? Oh, don't worry, I'm a long way away. But I like to keep tabs on you. The child then... What do you think? What is she? Hope. Hope in this endless, bitter war. What war? Against who? Against you, Doctor. What's that? Force field. And those are the doors... locking. Apparently we're not leaving. Is that the Monks? Oh, dear God... that's the attack prayer. Quick, come with me. Commander Strax! I'm trying to seal off this area of the lighting grid. This is where we'll make our stand. Clear lines of sight on all approaches. Rory, no offence to the others, but you let them all die first, OK? You're so Scottish. Centurian, you're needed. There should be some plasma pistols somewhere. They left everything. Then find them, boy! She's definitely a girl. Oh, stop it! We don't have to fight. I'm friends to the Monks, they know me. Yeah, and they know you just sold them out to the Doctor. Oh, they'll understand. It's only me, only silly old me. You understand, don't you? Mr Maldovar, get back here! Arm yourself, fool! Dorium! Mr Maldovar? Dorium? The child! At all costs, protect the child! A child is not a weapon! Oh, give us time. She can be. She will be. Except you've already lost her, and I swear I will never let you anywhere near her again. Oh, Doctor. Fooling you once was a joy... but fooling you twice, the same way, it's a privilege. Amy... Amy! 'Demons run when a good man goes to war. 'Night will fall and drown the sun when a good man goes to war. 'Friendship dies and true love lies. 'Night will fall and the dark will rise 'when a good man goes to war.' Amy! 'Demons run but count the cost 'the battle's won but the child is lost. Wakey, wakey! Amy! Rory! Rory! Rory! Amy, she's not real! Melody - she's a flesh avatar. Amy! Amy! Amy. Yeah, we know. It's strange. I have often dreamed of dying in combat. I'm not enjoying it as much as I'd hoped. Come on, Strax, don't give up. It's all right, I've had a good life. I'm nearly 12. Listen to me. You'll be back on your feet in no time. You're a warrior! Rory... I'm a nurse. So they took her anyway. All this was for nothing. I am so... sorry. Amy... it's not his fault. I know, I know. Doctor, there's someone who wants to speak to you. Her name is Lorna, she came to warn us. Hey. Hello. Doctor! You helped my friends, thank you. I met you once. In the Gamma Forests. You don't remember me. Hey, of course I remember. I remember everyone. Hey, we ran, you and me! Didn't we run, Lorna? Who was she? I don't know but she was very brave. They're always brave. They're always brave. So, what now? They'd almost certainly have taken her to Earth, raise her in the correct environment. Yes, they did. And it's already too late. You're giving up? You never do that. Don't you sometimes wish I did? Well, then, soldier. How goes the day? Where the hell have you been? Every time you've asked, I have been there. Where the hell were you today? I couldn't have prevented this. You could've tried! And so, my love, could you. I know you're not all right. But hold tight, Amy, because you're going to be. You think I wanted this? I didn't do this. This... this wasn't me! This was exactly you. All this, all of it. You make them so afraid. When you began, all those years ago, sailing off to see the universe, did you ever think you'd become this? The man who can turn an army around at the mention of his name? Doctor? The word for healer and wise man, throughout the universe. We get that word from you, you know. But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean? To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word "Doctor" means mighty warrior. How far you've come. And now they've taken a child... the child of your best friends... and they're going to turn her into a weapon, just to bring you down. And all this, my love... in fear of you. Who are you? Oh, look, your cot! Haven't seen that in a very long while. No, no, you tell me. Tell me... who you are. I am telling you. Can't you read? Hello. Hello. But... but that means... I'm afraid it does. Ooh! But you and I, we, we, we, er... Yes. How do I look? Amazing. I'd better be. Yes, you'd better be. Vastra and Jenny, till the next time. Rory and Amy, I'll find your daughter and on my life, she will be safe. River, get them all home. Doctor? No! Where are you going? No! Where's he going? What did you tell him? Amy, you have stay calm. Tell me what you told the Doctor. Amy, no, stop it! It's OK, Rory, she's fine, she's good. It's the TARDIS translation matrix, it takes a while to kick in with the written word. You have to concentrate. I still can't read it. It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate. But this will. It's your daughter's name in the language of the forest. I know my daughter's name. Except they don't have a word for "pond" because only water in the forest is the river. The Doctor will find your daughter and he will care for her whatever it takes and I know that. It's me. I'm Melody. I'm your daughter. This little girl, it's all about her. Who was she? Doctor! What is happening to her? Contractions. Contractions? She's going into labor. Breathe. I needed enough information to block the signal to the flesh. - What signal? - The signal to you. Rory, I don't like this. Stand away from her, Rory. We're coming for you, I swear it. Whatever happens, however hard, however far, we will find you. I'm right here. No, you're not. And you haven't been for a long, long... Time. You're ready to pop, aren't you? Aaaaah! I wish I could tell you that you'll be loved, that you'll be safe and cared for and protected. But this isn't a time for lies. What you are going to be, Melody, is very, very brave. Two minutes. But not as brave as they'll have to be. Because there's someone coming. I don't know where he is or what he's doing, but, trust me, he's on his way. Intruder, level 9. Seal level 9. There's a man who's never going to let us down, and not even an army can get in the way. Leave her. Just you leave her. Please leave her. Please! Leave her! Intruder, level 11. Seal levels 12, 13, and 14. Intruder, level 15. He's the last of his kind. He looks young, but he's lived for hundreds and hundreds of years. And wherever they take you, Melody, however scared you are, I promise you, you will never be alone. Because this man is your father. Prepare to engage. He has a name, but the people of our world know him better... As "The Last Centurion." I have a message and a question. A message from the Doctor and a question from me. Where... Is... My... Wife? Oh, don't give me those blank looks. The 12th Cyberlegion monitors this entire quadrant. You hear everything. So you tell me what I need to know. You tell me now, and I'll be on my way. What is the Doctor's message? Would you like me to repeat the question? ♪ Doctor Who 6x07 ♪ A Good Man Goes To War Original Air Date on June 1, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == A whole Cyberlegion, though. He just blew them all up, to make a point. We're being paid to fight him, not praise him. Praising costs way more. Level minus 23. Transept. Digger says he once chased the Atraxi off the planet, then called them back for a scolding. Fight him, not praise him. Reminder -- this base is on yellow alert. This base is on yellow alert. Is she sewing? She's on a break. She can do what she likes. Now, try again. That one. No, that's the psychic. You've got to look for the fractals. Don't look bored. We're on yellow alert. We've been on yellow alert for three weeks. Reminder -- do not interact with headless monks without divine permission. Do not interact with headless monks without divine permission. You're not supposed to stare at them. And, if they think you're tying to see under their hoods, they'll kill you, on the spot. Why are they called the "headless" monks? They can't really be headless. They believe the domain of faith is the heart and the domain of doubt is the head. They follow their hearts, that's all. You're Lorna Bucket, aren't you? Yeah. Hello. I'm the thin one. This is my husband. He's the fat one. Don't you have names? We're the thin, fat, gay, married, anglican marines. Why would we need names as well? Fat one: Oh, it looks like I'm off. Time for my conversion tutorial. See you in a bit. Do you lot have lent? Because I'm not good at giving things up. Lorna Bucket. You've had an encounter, haven't you? You've met him. I was just a kid. But what's he like? The Doctor. He said, "Run." Just "Run"? He said it a lot. And this was in the Gamma Forests, yeah? Because you're a Gamma girl, aren't you? What are you doing here? The forests are heaven-neutral. Yeah, and 30 seconds of the Doctor is the only thing that ever happened there. Oh, this is nice. I like this. I mean, quite a lot of red. I hope it's not to hide the stains. What's in the little boxes? Welcome, applicant, to the order of the headless. It is traditional for visiting armies of other faiths to offer individuals for conversion to our order. You have been selected. Are you ready to make a donation? So, what do you think? If the Doctor's really coming here, where is he? He's the Doctor -- he could be anywhere in time and space. Whoa-oa. Thank you, Parker. I won't be needing you again tonight. Yes, m'lady. Oh, you're back early, ma'am. Another case cracked, I assume? Send a telegram to Inspector Abberline of the yard. Jack the Ripper has claimed his last victim. How did you find him? Stringy, but tasty, all the same. I shan't be needing dinner. Congratulations, ma'am. Uh, however, a matter has arisen in the drawing room. It just appeared. What does it mean? It means a very old debt is to be repaid. Pack the cases, Jenny. And we're going to need the swords. Argh! Nurse! Nurse! Damn it! Where's the nurse? He needs help! Madame President, I'm sorry, but we have to go now. Those things could be here, any second. Did somebody call for a nurse? Will I be okay? Of course you will, my boy. You'll be up and around in no time. And, perhaps, one day, you and I shall meet on the field of battle and I will destroy you for the glory of the Sontaran Empire. Thanks, nurse. Commander Strax, I just have to ask -- a Sontaran nurse? I serve a penance to restore the honor of my clone batch. It is the greatest punishment a Sontaran can endure -- to help the weak and sick. Who came up with that one? Tonight, though, perhaps my penance is over. Captain Harcourt, I hope, someday, to meet you in the glory of battle, when I shall crush the life from your worthless human form. Try and get some rest. Oh, turn it off. I'm breaking in, not out. This is River Song, back in her cell. Oh, and I'll take breakfast at the usual time. Thank you. Oh! Are you boys dressing up as Romans now? I thought nobody read my memos. Doctor Song. It's Rory. Sorry, have we met yet? Timestreams - - I'm not quite sure where we are. Yes. Yes, we've met. Hello, Rory. Hey. What's wrong? It's my birthday. The Doctor took me ice skating on the River Thames in 1814, the last of the eat frost fairs. He got Stevie Wonder to sing for me under London Bridge. Stevie Wonder sang in 1814? Yes, he did. But you must never tell him. I've come from the Doctor, too. Yes, but at a different point in time. Unless there's two of them. Now, that's a whole different birthday. He needs you. Demons Run. How -- how did you know? I'm from his future. I always know. Why on earth are you wearing that? The Doctor's idea. Of course. His rules of engagement -- "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." "Look ridiculous." Have you considered heels? They've taken Amy. And our baby. The Doctor's getting some people together. We're going after her, but he needs you, too. I can't. Not yet, anyway. I'm sorry? This is the battle of Demons Run, the Doctor's darkest hour. He'll rise higher than ever before and then fall, so much further. And I can't be with him 'til the very end. Why not? Because this is it. This is the day he finds out who I am. Goodbye. You appear to be closing down, Dorium. What have you heard? That you pricked the side of a mighty beast, Madam Kovarian, and entirely failed to run. I admire your courage. I should like to admire it from afar. We've been waiting a month. He's done nothing. Do you really think so? There are people all over this galaxy that owe that man a debt. By now, a few of them will have found a blue box waiting for them on their doorstep -- poor devils. You think he's raising an army? You think he isn't? If that man is finally collecting on his debts, God help you, and God help his debtors. Why? Colonel Manton, all those stories you've heard about him, they're not stories, they're true. Really, you're not telling me you don't know what's coming? We're wasting our time here. Agreed. The asteroid, where you've made your base, do you know why they call it "Demons Run"? How do you know the location of our base? You're with the headless monks. They're old customers of mine. It's just some old saying. A very old saying. The oldest. "Demons Run when a good man goes to war." No! No, no, please! Not me! You don't need me! Why would you need me? ! I'm old, I'm fat, I'm blue! You can't need me! He is not the devil, he is not a God, he is not a goblin or a phantom or a trickster. The Doctor is a living, breathing man, and, as I look around this room, I know one thing -- we're sure as hell going to fix that. Yeah! Yeah! Sorry. I shouldn't be here. I'm meant to be at the thing. I brought you something. Your child's name, in the language of my people. It's a prayer leaf and, we believe, if you keep this with you, your child will always come home to you. Can I borrow your gun? Why? Because I've got a feeling you're going to keep talking. The asteroid is now -- faster and more powerful than -- Yeah! Talking like he's famous. The Doctor isn't famous. He meets a lot of people. Some of them remember. He's sort of like a -- I don't know, a dark legend. "Dark"? Have you met him? Yeah. But I was just a little girl. So was I. You've been with him a long time, then. No. He came back for me. You must be very special. Hey. You can wait a long time for the Doctor, but he's worth it, okay? The thing is, he's coming, no question about it -- just you make sure you're on the right side when he gets here. Not for my sake. For yours. Thank you. On this day, in this place, the Doctor will fall. Hooah! The man who talks, the man who reasons, the man who lies, will meet the perfect answer. Hooah! Some of you have wondered why have we have allied ourselves with the headless monks. Perhaps you should've wondered why we call them "headless." It's time you knew what these guys have sacrificed for faith. As you all know, it is a level 1 heresy, punishable by death, to lower the hood of a headless monk. But, by the divine grant of the papal mainframe herself, on this one and only occasion, I can show you the truth. Because these guys never can be... Persuaded, they never can be afraid, and they can never, ever, be... The Doctor: Surprised. The Doctor: Ha-ha! Hello, everyone! Guess who. Please, point a gun at me, if it helps you relax. You're only human. Go on, resist. I am ever so hungry. Now, dear, which button controls the lights? Doctor, you will come with me right now. Three minutes, 40 seconds. Amelia Pond! Get your coat. The Doctor: I'm not a phantom. Doctor. I'm not a trick. Doctor. I'm a monk. Doctor, show yourself. It's him! He's here! It's him! Weapons down! Do! Not! Fire! Ugh! No! Follow me. Doctor! Doctor! Clever, isn't he? And rather attractive. You do realize he's a man, don't you, ma'am? Mammals -- they all look alike. Thank you. Do not fire. Nobody discharge their weapon in this room -- nobody! Do not fire! Was I being insensitive again, dear? I don't know why you put up with me. Stop, wait. Listen to me. I am disarming my weapon pack. Monks, I do this in good faith. I am now unarmed. All of you, discharge your weapon packs. The Doctor is trying to make fools of us. We are soldiers of God. We are not fools. We are not fools. We are not fools. We are not fools. We are not fools! We are not fools. We are not fools. We are not fools. We are not fools. We are not fools. Colonel Manton is regaining control. Where's the Doctor gone? We are not fools. We are not fools! We are not fools! This base is now under our command. I have a fleet out there. If Demons Run goes down, there's an automatic distress call. The Doctor: Not if we knock out your communications array. And you've got incoming. Danny boy to the Doctor. Danny boy to the Doctor. Give 'em hell, Danny boy. Vroom! I need to get off this station now. Bring me the child. Danny boy: Target destroyed. Ha-ha! Ha! Don't slump. It's bad for your spine. Get back in there with the rest of them. Remember -- the Doctor must think he's winning, right until the trap closes. I'll take my ship from here. Airlock engaged. Shuttle ready for boarding. No. I have a crew of 20. How do you expect to gain control of my ship? This ship is ours, my lady. All airlocks sealed. Resistance neutralized. The Doctor: Sorry, Colonel Manton, I lied. Three minutes, 42 seconds. Colonel Manton, you will give the order for your men to withdraw. No. Colonel Manton, I want you to tell your men to run away. You what? Those words -- "Run away." I want you to be famous for those exact words. I want people to call you "Colonel Run Away," I want children laughing outside your door because they've found the house of Colonel Run Away, and when people come to you and ask if trying to get to me through the people I love! Is, in any way, a good idea... I want you to tell them your name. Oh, look, I'm angry. That's new. I'm really not sure what's going to happen now. The anger of a good man is not a problem. Good men have too many rules. Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many. Hmm? Give the order. Give the order, Colonel -- "Run Away." Who's that? Who's there? You watch it, because I am armed and really dangerous and... Cross. Yeah, like I don't know that. Rory? Rory, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Ugh. No. Hang on a minute. They took her. Rory, they took our baby away. Now, Mrs. Williams, that is never, ever, going to happen. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where's she been? What have they done to her? She's fine. Amy, she's fine. I checked. She's beautiful. Oh, God, I was going to be cool. I wanted to be cool. Look at me. You're okay. A crying Roman with a baby -- definitely cool. Come here, you. Ew, kissing and crying. I'll - - I'll -- I'll be back in a bit. Oi, you. Get in here, now. My daughter. What do you think? The Doctor: Hello. Hello, uh... Baby. Melody. Melody? Hello, Melody Pond. Melody Williams. Is a geography teacher. Melody Pond is a superhero. Well, yes, I suppose she does smell nice. I never really sniffed her. Maybe I should give it a go. Amelia Pond, come here. Doctor. Sorry we were so long. Ah! It's okay. I knew you were coming. Both of you. My boys. It's okay, she's still all yours. And, really, you should call her "mummy," not "big milk thing." Okay, what are you doing? I speak baby. No, you don't. I speak everything. Don't I, Melody Pond? No, it's not. It's cool. Doctor! Take a look. They're leaving. Demons Run is ours, without a drop of blood spilled. My friend, you have never risen higher. Hey, what's wrong? She doesn't like the TARDIS noise. I asked him to turn something off, but it was all, "but I don't want to punch a hole in the space-time continuum." Rory! The Judoon have escorted the clerics out of the quadrant, the spitfires have returned to their own time, Captain Avery and his men are -- is she all right? Yeah, she's just crying. Give her to me, human fools! She needs changing! I just changed her. I think she might need a feed. A feed. Of course. I'll take care of everything. Uh, I really don't think you will, actually. I have gene-spliced myself for all nursing duties. I can produce magnificent quantities of lactic fluid! She's not hungry, she's tired. Sorry, Melody, they're just not listening. What's this, Melody? Very pretty, according to your daughter. It's a -- it's a cot. No flies on the Roman. Give her here. Hey! There we go. Hello! But where would you get a cot? It's old. Really old. Doctor, um, do you have children? No. Have you ever had children? No, no, it's real. It's my hair. Who slept in here? Doctor, we need you in the main control room. Be right there! Things to do. I've still got to work out what this base is for. We can't leave 'til we know. Uh, but this is where I was? The whole time I thought I was on the TARDIS, I was really here? Uh... Centurion, permission to hug? Be aware, I do have a sword. At all times. You were on the TARDIS, too. Your heart, your mind, your soul. But, physically, yes, you were still in this place. And when I saw that face looking through the hatch -- that woman, looking at me? Reality, bleeding through. They must've taken you quite a while back, just before America. That's probably enough hugging now. So her flesh avatar was with us all that time? But that means they were projecting a control signal right into the TARDIS, wherever we were in time and space. Yeah, they're very clever. - Who are? - Whoever wants our baby. - But why do they want her? - Exactly. Is there anything you're not telling us? You knew Amy wasn't real. You never said. Well, I couldn't be sure they weren't listening. But you always hold out on us. Please, not this time. Doctor, it's our baby. Tell us something. One little thing. It's mine. What is? The cot. It's my cot. I slept in there. Oh, my God. It's the Doctor's first stars. She's -- Drop your weapons. State your rank and intent. I found it listening at the door. You've hacked into their software, then? I believe I sold it to them. Ooh! So what have we learned? Anger is always the shortest distance to a mistake. I'm sorry? The words of an old friend who once found me in the London underground, attempting to avenge my sisters on perfectly innocent tunnel-diggers. Well, you were very cross, at the time. As you were today, old friend. Point taken, I hope. Now, I have a question. A simple one -- is Melody human? Sorry, what? Ha! Of course she is. Completely human. What are you talking about? They've been scanning her since she was born and I think they found what they were looking for. Human DNA. Look closer -- human plus. Specifically, human plus Time Lord. I heard her talking. This is a trap. Why would I lie to you? Well, you might want to take a look at your uniform. The only reason I joined the clerics was so I could meet the Doctor again. You wanted to meet him, so you joined an army to fight him? Well, how else do you meet a great warrior? He's not a warrior. Then why is he called "the Doctor"? It's starting. Please, listen to me. The Doctor: But she's human, she's Amy and Rory's daughter. You've told me about your people. They became what they did through prolonged exposure to the time vortex, the untempered schism. Over billions of years. It didn't just happen. So how close is she? Could she even regenerate? No, no. I don't think so. You don't sound so sure. Because I don't understand how this happened. Which leads me to ask -- when did it happen? When? Ugh! I am trying to be delicate. I know how you can blush. When did this baby... Begin? Oh, you mean...? Quite. Well, how would I know? That's all humany, private stuff, it just sort of goes on. They don't put up a balloon, or anything. But could the child have begun on the TARDIS, in flight, in the vortex? No, no! Impossible! It's all running about; Sexy, fish vampires; and blowing up stuff. And Rory wasn't even there at the beginning. Then he was dead, then he didn't exist, then he was plastic, then I had to reboot the whole universe -- long story. So, technically, the first time they were on the TARDIS together, in this version of reality, was on their w-- On their what? Hmm? On their wedding night. Confirmed. No life forms registering on this base, except us and the Silurians. The headless monks aren't alive. They don't register as life forms. The Doctor: It doesn't make sense -- you can't just cook yourself a Time Lord! Of course not. But you gave them one hell of a start and they've been working very hard ever since. And, yet, they gave in so easily. Does this not bother anyone else? Amy -- she worried the baby would have a timehead. Only you would ignore the instincts of a mother. Or the instincts of a coward. This is too easy. There's something wrong. Why even do it? Even if you could get your hands on a brand-new Time Lord, what for? A weapon? Why would a Time Lord be a weapon? Well -- They've seen you. Me? Mr. Maldovar, you're right -- this was too easy. We should get back to the others. Me? I'd say she's human, going by the life- support software. She climbed out of this suit. Like, she forced her way out. She must be incredibly strong. I see you accessed our files. Do you understand yet? Oh, don't worry. I'm a long way away, but I like to keep tabs on you. The child, then. What do you think? What is she? Hope. Hope in this endless, bitter war. What war? Against who? Against you, Doctor. What's that? Forcefield. And those are the doors. Locking. Apparently, we're not leaving. Is that the monks? Oh, dear God, that's the attack prayer! Quick, come with me. Commander strax! I'm trying to seal off this area of the lighting grid. This is where we'll make our stand. Clear lines of sight on all approaches. Rory, no offense to the others, but, uh, you let them all die first, okay? You're so Scottish. Centurion, you're needed! There should be some plasma pistols somewhere -- they left everything. Then find them, boy! She's definitely a girl. Oh, stop it! We don't have to fight them. I'm friends to the monks. They know me. Yeah, and they know you just sold them out to the Doctor. Oh, they'll understand. It's only me. Only silly old me. You understand, don't you? Mr. Maldovar, get back here! Arm yourself, fool! Dorium! Mr. Maldovar? Dorium? The child. At all costs, protect the child! A child is not a weapon! Oh, give us time. She can be. She will be. Except you've already lost her, and, I swear, I will never let you anywhere near her again. Oh, Doctor. Fooling you once was a joy, but fooling you twice, the same way? It's a privilege. Amy. Amy. "Demons Run when a good man goes to war. "Night will fall and drown the sun "when a good man goes to war. "Friendship dies and true love lies. "Night will fall and the dark will rise when a good man goes to war." Amy! "Demons Run, but count the cost: The battle's won, but the child is lost." Amy! Wakey, wakey. Amy! Rory. Rory! Rory! Amy, she's not real! Melody -- she's a flesh avatar! Amy! Amy! Amy. Yeah, we know. It's strange. I have often dreamed of dying in combat. I'm not enjoying it as much as I'd hoped. Come on, strax. Don't give up. It's all right. I've had a good life. I'm nearly 12. Listen to me. You'll be back on your feet in no time. You're a warrior. Rory... I'm a nurse. So they took her, anyway. All this was for nothing. I am so... Sorry. Amy, it's not his fault. I know, I know. Doctor, there's someone who wants to speak to you. Her name is Lorna. She came to warn us. Hey. Hello. Doctor. You helped my friends. Thank you. I met you once. In the Gamma Forests. You don't remember me. Hey, of course I remember. I remember everyone. Hey, we ran, you and me. Didn't we run, Lorna? Who was she? I don't know, but she was very brave. They're always brave. They're always brave. So, what now? They'd almost certainly have taken her to earth, raise her in the correct environment. Yes, they did, and it's already too late. You're giving up? You never do that! Yeah, and don't you sometimes wish I did? Well, then, soldier, how goes the day? Where the hell have you been? Every time you've asked, I have been there. Where the hell were you today? I couldn't have prevented this. You could've tried! And so, my love, could you. I know you're not all right, but hold tight, Amy, because you're going to be. You think I wanted this? I didn't do this. This -- this wasn't me! This was exactly you. All this, all of it. You make them so afraid. When you began, all those years ago, sailing off to see the universe, did you ever think you'd become this? The man who can turn an army around at the mention of his name. "Doctor" -- the word for "healer" and "wise man" throughout the universe. We get that word from you, you know. But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean? To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word "Doctor" means "mighty warrior." How far you've come. And now they've taken a child, the child of your best friends, and they're going to turn her into a weapon, just to bring you down. And all this, my love, in fear of you. Who are you? Oh, look, your cot. Haven't seen that in a very long while. No, no, you tell me, you tell me who you are. I am telling you. Can't you read? Hello. Hello. But -- But that means -- I'm afraid it does. Ooh, but you and I, we, we, we, we, uh -- Yes. Ooh! Ooh. How do I look? Amazing. I'd better be. Yes, you'd better be. Vastra and Jenny, 'til the next time. Rory and Amy, I know where to find your daughter and, on my life, she will be safe. River, get them all home. Doctor. No! Where are you going? No! Where's he going? What did you tell him? Amy, you have to stay calm. Tell me what you told the Doctor. Amy, no. Stop it! It's okay, Rory, she's fine, she's good. It's the TARDIS translation matrix. It takes a while to kick in with the written word. You have to concentrate. I still can't read it. It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate. But this will. It's your daughter's name, in the language of the forest. I know my daughter's name. Except, they don't have a word for "Pond," because the only water in the forest is the river. The Doctor will find your daughter and he will care for her, whatever it takes, and I know that. It's me. I'm Melody. I'm your daughter. == sync, corrected by elderman == NARRATOR: Is Earth the only planet of its kind in the universe? Or is there somewhere else like this out there? Is there life beyond Earth? The search for alien life is one of humankind's greatest technological challenges. And scientists are seeking new ways to find answers. We're pushing the boundary of information of where life can exist past the Earth and out into the solar system. NARRATOR: Leading the search are sophisticated telescopes that scan the sky and an armada of robotic probes exploring the outer reaches of our solar system... all revealing the planets, moons, asteroids and comets like never before. WOMAN: We can go places and see things that there's no other way we could have ever seen. NARRATOR: The search reveals evidence of strange and unexpected worlds-- places with lakes, storms and rain, violent places driven by powerful forces deep underground. Worlds that may have hidden oceans hundreds of millions of miles from the heat of the sun. The pace of discovery, just in the last couple of years, is just mind-boggling. NARRATOR: New missions are helping to unlock the mysteries of what makes a planet habitable, raising the question of whether the building blocks of life are more prevalent than previously imagined, not just in our own solar system, but possibly throughout our galaxy. We now have for the first time in human history definite planets out there among the stars that remind us of home. NARRATOR: "Finding Life Beyond Earth," up now on NOVA. Major funding for NOVA is provided by the following: And... And the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and by PBS viewers like you. Additional funding is provided by Millicent Bell, through: NARRATOR: After a seven-year, two-billion-mile voyage, the spacecraft Cassini enters orbit around Saturn. Cassini heads towards the largest of Saturn's 62 moons... Titan. Bigger than the planet Mercury, Titan is hidden by a thick orange haze. No one has ever seen its surface. But a small probe named Huygens, released by Cassini, is about to change everything. This mission will challenge long-held notions of where life could exist beyond Earth. These are the actual images Huygens takes as it breaks through the clouds and haze. Titan is a land of mountains and valleys, a place that looks surprisingly like Earth. Then, images reveal something no one expects. The surface is littered with smooth rocks, the type normally found in river beds on Earth. CHRIS McKAY: My response was shock. We look out on the surface and we see what looks like a desert and at the same time, the data from the probe told us that the ground around the site was wet. NARRATOR: Hundreds of miles overhead, Cassini's radar sweeps the surface. The images show a landscape covered with what appear to be hundreds of lakes. This one covers an area of 6,000 square miles, about the size of Lake Ontario, one of the Great Lakes. It's a surprising discovery. It's the only world other than the Earth that has a liquid on its surface. NARRATOR: But what exactly is this liquid? Titan is minus-290 degrees Fahrenheit. If it's water, it should be frozen solid. Then, one of Cassini's instruments analyzes the infrared light reflected off the lakes. The readings are consistent not with water but with liquid methane and ethane, substances that on Earth are volatile, flammable gases. The data from Cassini are so detailed, scientists can imagine what it would be like to stand on this cold, distant world. McKAY: Standing on the surface of Titan, you see Saturn just sitting there in the sky, big, huge, stationary object, almost like a door to another dimension. Here we see lakes, lakes of liquid methane. And in the horizon, we see mountains. These are mountains made of ice, made of water ice, frozen so hard that it acts like rocks. And the features that we see in them are carved by the liquid methane that's forming these lakes. Looking across the horizon on Titan, you might see a thunderstorm or a range of thunderstorms coming at you. We see rain coming down. It's not drops like we're familiar with on Earth. This is methane instead of water. It falls much more slowly due to the low gravity and the drops are bigger. NARRATOR: So what are the implications of finding a liquid flowing on Titan's surface for a scientist like Chris McKay? McKAY: Liquid seemed to be the key to life, so maybe there's life in that liquid on Titan, little things swimming in liquid methane, being quite happy at these low, cold temperatures. NARRATOR: There is no evidence that living things like microbes exist in these lakes. But if such evidence were found here, it would fundamentally change perceptions about life beyond Earth. If life could evolve on worlds as drastically different as the Earth and Titan, then perhaps life could evolve in many other ways on many different worlds. NASA's director of planetary science is Jim Green. GREEN: One of the questions that we all want to know, I think, deep down inside, is, "Are we alone?" I mean, that's really fundamental. NARRATOR: Jim is at the forefront of a global effort to understand whether the conditions for life exist beyond our planet. GREEN: We're pushing the boundary of information of where life can exist past the Earth and out into the solar system. NARRATOR: So, where in our solar system could life potentially exist? Heading out from the sun, the first planet is Mercury. It's an extremely hostile environment. In March 201 1 , NASA's Messenger probe becomes the first spacecraft to orbit this small ball of rock and iron. These are some of the first images sent back. Three times closer to the sun than Earth is, Mercury bakes in 800-degree heat on its side facing the sun, while on the night side, temperatures plummet to minus 290. Mercury is the ultimate desert world. Life of any kind here seems unlikely. Mercury's closest neighbor, Venus, is almost as hostile. Though nearly twice as far from the sun, temperatures here exceed 880 degrees. Decades of observations have revealed a planet shrouded in carbon dioxide and toxic clouds of sulfuric acid. These radar images reveal thousands of ancient volcanoes on a surface hot enough to melt lead. And with an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than on Earth, it is hard to imagine that anything could live down here. But based on chemical analysis of the atmosphere, scientists believe that water once flowed on Venus's surface. If life ever did exist here, evidence has yet to be found. So what is it about Earth, the third planet out from the sun, that makes life possible? The answer lies in three key ingredients. First, all life is made up of organic molecules consisting of carbon in compounds that include nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen, among others. Although organic molecules aren't alive themselves, they are the basic building blocks of every living organism. Life also needs a liquid, like water. In water, the basic organic molecules can mix, interact and become more complex. The last ingredient is an energy source like the sun to power the chemical reactions that drive all life, from the smallest microbe... to us. When these three ingredients came together billions of years ago, life found a way to take hold... and today persists even in the most extreme environments, like here. This is the Mojave Desert, Nevada. It is one of the hottest, driest places on our planet. McKAY: This part of the desert is particularly interesting to me, because it's the driest part. There's an axis of dryness here. If we go either east or west, it becomes wetter. NARRATOR: Surprisingly, even here, with only a foot of rainfall a year, all three ingredients for life are present. The rocks provide just enough shade to prevent water from evaporating completely. McKAY: Underneath the white rocks, we can find the most amazing thing. We see this layer of green. This is bacteria. The rock provides a little shelter. It's a little wetter and a little nicer living under the rock than it is in the soil around it. In addition, the white rocks are translucent. Hold them up to the sun and see light coming through. These organisms are photosynthesizing here in the desert where nothing else will grow. So they're living in a miniature little greenhouse. NARRATOR: This place shows that even in some of Earth's most extreme environments, under the right conditions, life has a chance. For scientists like Chris McKay, the question is: Is Earth the only planet with the essential conditions for life? One way to know is to investigate how planets like ours formed to have these ingredients in the first place. That story starts 4.6 billion years ago, with the birth of our solar system. As a vast cloud of dust and gas collapses in on itself, pressures increase. Temperatures at the center rise to millions of degrees... until energy from the early sun blasts away some of the cloud. This lights up the young solar system, revealing the beginnings of planets. The mystery has always been how did this spinning cloud of dust become the massive planets we see today? SCOTT SANDFORD: How does one go from microscopic grains to golf-ball size things, and how do golf-ball size things go from there to ten-meter size things? How do those go to planetary embryos? And there's a lot of steps in there we don't quite understand. NARRATOR: Many scientists believe the answers are hidden in asteroids... the oldest rocks in the solar system, leftover debris from its earliest days. In 2003 the Japanese probe Hayabusa sets out on an audacious mission. The goal: to land on an asteroid, collect samples of dust and then return them to Earth. The target is asteroid Itokawa, a third of a mile long and speeding through space at 56,000 miles per hour. Landing on it would be like trying to hit a speeding bullet with another speeding bullet. SANDFORD: Hayabusa in Japanese means falcon, and the idea was to do like a falcon grabs a rabbit-- swoop down, sort of just touch the surface, get your sample and go. NARRATOR: In 2005, 1 80 million miles from Earth, Hayabusa makes contact. It stays just long enough to grab a sample. It will take five years before Hayabusa returns asteroid dust to Earth. But in the meantime, using lasers on board, Hayabusa takes measurements of Itokawa's size and mass. These allow scientists to determine the asteroid's internal structure. What they discover could be a blueprint for how planets like Earth first formed. SANDFORD: It's not one solid lump of rock, but, in fact, it consists of a pile of smaller rocks, of many sizes all the way from houses down to dust grains. NARRATOR: If we could see inside asteroid Itokawa, this is what it would look like: a loose mixture of smaller asteroids that are held together by gravity. SANDFORD: Maybe 40% of the internal volume of the asteroid is empty space. You probably could just take your hand and just go like this and just push it down into the asteroid. NARRATOR: Is this the first step in building rocky planets like Earth? GREEN: Asteroids are just not lumps of rock. These are the basic parts or building blocks of planets. NARRATOR: Over hundreds of thousands of years, asteroids like Itokawa continue to collide, growing bigger and hotter. As their gravity increases, they attract even more asteroids until eventually, as temperatures rise, they become spheres of rock with hot molten cores-- protoplanets. Computer simulations suggest that within ten million years of the solar system's birth, up to a hundred protoplanets ranging in size from our moon to Mars were orbiting close to the sun. So why does the solar system look so different today? This is proto-Earth four- and-a-half billion years ago. Planetary geologist Stephen Mojzsis believes this world was very different from the one we see today. MOJZSIS: Looking at the surface here, this landscape is dominated by lava, black and blasted by impacts. Underfoot we find mostly basaltic rock. It is the frozen product of molten rock. These planetary surfaces weren't molten boiling cauldrons. But instead, for most of their early histories, they were solid and cool. NARRATOR: The atmosphere is thick with carbon dioxide and laced with sulfuric acid, the result of intense volcanic activity. MOJZSIS: The embryonic Earth would have an atmosphere denser than the one we have and a sky yellow and red and thoroughly unbreathable to us. NARRATOR: How does this toxic and inhospitable world eventually become the Earth we know today? Ironically, it will take a cataclysmic event to create a planet capable of harboring life. A protoplanet the size of Mars slams into early Earth. The collision is so violent it melts the surface, creates an even larger planet, and blasts molten rock back into space that will coalesce and eventually form our moon. Earth isn't the only planet that gets transformed by giant impacts. Over tens of millions of years, all the protoplanets of the early solar system repeatedly collide, becoming larger bodies with each impact in a destructive game of planetary billiards. This process eventually formed the four rocky planets seen today: Mercury... Venus... Earth... and Mars. SARAH STEWART: So the final planets that we have today are really the ones that won the competition in that some planets were literally destroyed or thrown out of the solar system and others survived to be here today. NARRATOR: Sarah Stewart is a planetary scientist. She's trying to determine how these impacts created a habitable world. There's some magic set of conditions that has to occur in a solar system to give you an Earth-like planet. NARRATOR: Figuring out what happens when a massive planet the size of Mars hits Earth is no small feat. It requires smashing things together at extremely high velocities. We want to simulate what happens when materials strike the Earth at very high speeds. What we can do in the lab is study little pieces of the process and, using the information we gather from many experiments, we build computer models that try and recreate the whole event. NARRATOR: This requires a special piece of hardware, a 20-foot cannon that uses an explosive charge to fire projectiles at up to 6,000 miles per hour. At the other end is a pressure chamber and the target, representing a planet like Earth, wired up with precision sensors. STEWART: We have a 40-millimeter gun that launches 1 00-gram bullets into rocks or ices, and we study what happens as that shock wave travels through the material. NARRATOR: The gun is set to fire. (gunshot) Each test measures the temperatures and shock waves generated in different materials when they are slammed into each other. The results are fed into computer models of the final stages of a planet's formation. STEWART: Over the past few years, we've realized how important the last giant impact is to the final state of a planet. That last impact could fundamentally change major parts of the planet, and that could lead to something that's Earth-like or something that's more Mercury-like. NARRATOR: Sarah's work, though not yet conclusive, suggests that giant impacts could play a role in producing water on a planet's surface. Her results indicate the collisions were so violent, they could heat rock to 2,700 degrees, hot enough to release water trapped deep beneath the surfaces as steam. Sarah believes this may have happened during Earth's final catastrophic collision. In its aftermath, as the raging hot planet cools over millions of years, this steam condenses and falls as rain, covering the surface with seas and oceans. If this hypothesis is correct, then several million years after forming, Earth has two of the three ingredients needed for life: water, and energy from the sun. But what about organic molecules, the chemical building blocks of life? How did they get to Earth? Some scientists believe the answer may lie in the furthest reaches of the solar system... beyond Jupiter... Saturn... Uranus... and even Neptune. Here, three billion miles from the sun, is a vast ring of comets and other debris called the Kuiper Belt. Like asteroids, comets are remnants from the dawn of the solar system, but as well as rock, they are also made of ices that only freeze this far from the sun. Astrobiologist Danny Glavin and his team think comets are the key to understanding how the final ingredients necessary for life arrived on Earth. GLAVIN: The reason that comets are so important to study is that they really are windows back in time. These things formed four- and-a-half billion years ago, before the Earth even formed, and so we're looking at the chemistry in these objects that was frozen in time. NARRATOR: But analyzing actual comet material when the closest sample is more than three billion miles away is a major challenge. Fortunately, icy comets occasionally fly in closer to Earth. As they approach the sun, comets warm up and the ice starts to vaporize, spitting out tiny particles of ice and dust. GLAVIN: So when you're looking at a comet in the sky, what you're actually seeing is predominantly the tail. You don't see that tiny rocky ice nucleus, because it's being dominated by the sublimation of ices and rocks. So you see that long tail and the solar wind, which is just dragging it for millions of miles behind. NASA ANNOUNCER: Zero and lift-off of the Stardust spacecraft. NARRATOR: A Delta II rocket blasts into space. Onboard is the probe Stardust. ANNOUNCER: Gone through mach 1 , vehicle looks very good, burning nicely. NARRATOR: The aim: to meet up with a comet speeding through space at nearly 60,000 miles per hour, then, fly through the ice and dust and bring some of it back to Earth. 240 million miles from Earth, Stardust approaches the comet named Wild 2. It heads to the heart of the comet and takes these images of its solid icy nucleus. The surface is broken and jagged, and shooting out of it are jets of dust and ice particles. Astronomer John Spencer is an expert on objects from the outer solar system. SPENCER: The cometary surface is pretty treacherous. We have crazy spires that may be several hundred feet high. We have overhangs, we have upturned layers where the surface really seems to have been torn apart. This is a very, very bizarre landscape. We have a surface that is mostly black, but scattered around within that we have fresh ice. We see a mostly black sky because the atmosphere is almost negligible. That black sky is punctuated by these geyserlike jets of ice particles that are shooting up at supersonic velocities. NARRATOR: These icy geysers bombard Stardust. These particles hit at almost 1 4,000 miles per hour, six times faster than a speeding bullet. NARRATOR: Stardust survives intact and on January 1 5, 2006, the samples return to Earth. GLAVIN: The samples fell down on Utah and boom-- we had the first comet sample materials and there were astrobiologists all over the Earth that were, you know, kind of screaming inside, because we knew this was our first chance to actually analyze comet material. NARRATOR: Inside, scientists discover over 1 ,000 grains of comet dust. Glavin and his team analyze this material for three years. Then, they make an incredible discovery. In the dust from the comet are traces of the organic molecule glycine, an integral part of living things. Probably frozen into the comet when it formed, glycine consists of simple elements found in the cloud of gas and dust that gave birth to our solar system. Now, glycine is an amino acid. It's one of the building blocks for life. GLAVIN: These make life go. They make up proteins and enzymes, they catalyze all the reactions in our bodies, they're fundamental to life. Without these we could not exist at all. NARRATOR: All life on Earth, from these bacteria to us, uses amino acids. Glycine is special because it's the most common of the 20 amino acids needed to make proteins, part of the very fabric of life. The discovery means that comets could have been one source of the organic materials necessary for life on Earth. We've proved that in fact comets could have delivered the raw ingredients of life to the early Earth. NARRATOR: But what could cause comets to fly in from the furthest edges of the solar system, slam into Earth and deliver these organic compounds? The clues to one possible process lie back out in the Kuiper Belt, the disk of icy objects that orbits the sun at the edge of our solar system. HAL LEVISON: We expected when we found the Kuiper Belt that we would just see objects in nice circular orbits about the sun. NARRATOR: But observations reveal that the Kuiper Belt objects are not orbiting as predicted. Out here, it's chaotic. When we look at the Kuiper Belt, we see something that looks like somebody took the solar system, picked it up and shook it real hard. And that's what started us thinking that something really strange has happened there. NARRATOR: Levison theorizes that the reason for this mayhem likely is connected with the two largest planets in the solar system. Jupiter is so big it could swallow more than 1 ,300 Earths, and Saturn, with its vast rings of ice, is 95 times Earth's mass. With their enormous size comes an enormous gravitational pull. LEVISON: Everything that we see is a result of what Jupiter and Saturn did. NARRATOR: Levison wonders if the chaos of the Kuiper Belt could have resulted from a planet smashing into it. To find out, he runs a number of computer simulations. One model creates the conditions in the Kuiper Belt that we see today. 3.9 billion years ago, as Jupiter circled the sun twice, Saturn made one complete orbit. Each time these orbits coincided, there was a powerful gravitational surge. That pushed Saturn's orbit further from the sun and destabilized the orbits of the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter and Saturn sort of tugged each other, and that drove the orbits of Uranus and Neptune absolutely nuts. NARRATOR: Uranus and Neptune are sent careening outwards towards the Kuiper Belt. Comets ranging in size from a mile across to objects the size of Pluto are blasted out of their orbits by the planetary invasion. The disk went kaplooey. Think of it as sort of a bowling ball hitting bowling pins. These things got scattered all over the place. NARRATOR: The end result is a hundred-million-year period when comets, kicked out into the solar system by Uranus and Neptune, smash into anything in their path. It's a period scientists call "the late heavy bombardment." Earth doesn't escape. LEVISON: This was so violent that probably every square inch of the surface of the Earth was hit by a comet during this time. NARRATOR: This is one theory that might explain how massive amounts of organic molecules, the building blocks of life, made their way to Earth. Possible evidence of the late heavy bombardment can be seen on the surface of other planets and moons in the solar system. Impact craters. Literally the seeds of life, the amino acids would have been delivered to all the planets and their moons in our solar system. NARRATOR: So if life's building blocks were delivered by comets throughout the solar system, could life also have sprung up on worlds other than Earth? It is unlikely that living organisms exist today on Venus or Mercury, as space probes have found no evidence on these planets of the other vital ingredient life needs: liquid water. But what about Mars? Organic compounds have yet to be found here, but scientists are searching the planet for the other preconditions of life. There have been many missions to Mars, and nearly all suggest that water once flowed on the surface. These detailed images from satellites orbiting Mars reveal vast canyons blasted out by epic floods and valleys carved by raging rivers. But the evidence indicates that all this water disappeared from the surface billions of years ago as Mars cooled down and lost its atmosphere. But on May 25, 2008, a spacecraft called Phoenix touches down near Mars' north pole. Digging a few inches down, it exposes a white material that vaporizes after a few days. Soil analysis reveals it is water ice. We landed 68 degrees north, poof! Just a few centimeters below the ground there was a layer of ice. NARRATOR: Satellites analyze radar waves bouncing back from both polar caps. They reveal that beneath a layer of frozen carbon dioxide there is a lot of water ice. If it all melted, it would cover the whole planet in an ocean more than 80 feet deep. GREEN: When we look at Mars and we see the reservoirs of water there, it's completely surprised us in terms of the amount of water and how much water is actually trapped underground. NARRATOR: The same satellites orbiting Mars are discovering that buried ice is also widespread beneath the desert floors. McKAY: When we look at Mars, we see what looks like a desert world with no water, but in fact, Mars has lots of water-- it's ice. Mars is an ice cube covered with a layer of dirt. NARRATOR: But this doesn't mean that finding life here is rings ] [ Indistinct conversation ] [ Door opens, closes ] [ Shoes squishing ] Holder: Damn, Linden. What the hell are you doing here in the middle of the night, sneaking around in the dark? I was returning the file you forgot at my place. [ Snaps fingers ] That's where it was. - Yeah. - I've been looking all over for it. I thought I lost it. What are you doing here so late? You know, clock never stops. Digging around down in storage halfway to China, still no Seward file. Well, it sounds like you have a long night ahead of you. Good luck. You miss it? What? No, I mean, I didn't really look. No? Not curious at all? Just opened it up, closed it real quick, brought it right back? Yep. Stepping in that bouillabaisse at the factory nearly ruined my hush puppies, too. [ Sighs ] Why did she get out of the car? She knows he's not bringing her there for sex-- not there. Yet she walks right in. She doesn't fight. She doesn't run. No ligature marks on her arms or wrists. No sign of a struggle outside the scene. Know he's got a knife, so maybe he's got a gun, too. No one's outrunning a bullet. Or else he knows how to control them because he's done it before. Maybe there's a connection between this killing and the Seward job. No. No, their throats were cut. That's it. Look, your girl was outside. Mine was in an apartment. Yours is a teenager. Trisha Seward was 30. Yours was raped. Mine wasn't. And you closed your case three years ago. Yes, we got the guy. I'm thinking my guy took trophies. Bunch of my girl's rings were missing. Probably broke her finger pulling them off. What do you mean, broke a finger? Snapped it in two postmortem. Seward take any trophies? No. Back to square one. [ Telephone rings ] Yeah, well, good luck. Hey, Linden. Get them dogs cleaned. [ Shoes squishing ] [ Siren walls in distance ] [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Dialing, ringing ] Kallie: Hey. It's me, so leave me a message or whatever. [ Beep ] Hey, Kal. It's me again. Where the hell you at? Call me. [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Knocking on door ] Yo, Kallie, wake up! Hey! Come on! Answer the door! [ Knocking continues ] [ Thud ] - Kallie around? - No. She said she was staying here last night. Where's she at? I don't know. I-I don't have time for this, all right? You mind? [ Door slams ] Bitch. [ Siren walls in distance ] [ Indistinct shouting in distance ] He isn't as fine as you. [ Scoffs ] Yeah. No shit. [ Sighs ] But his look, you know-- God, it's sick. My look will be like that, you know, but sicker. Going to those Hollywood parties, getting to eat fish off naked girls, getting free swag. A lot of girls would be all up on you- models and stuff. [ Chuckles ] - Yeah. [ Sniffling ] [ Sighs ] Come on, Lyric. Cut it out. I'm not doing anything. Leave me alone. [ Sighs ] Hey. [ Singsong voice ] Lyric. Lyric. [ Normal voice ] Hey. [ Sniffles ] Hey. No one's like you. - Yeah? - Yeah. You got snot and stuff everywhere. [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] I got to wash up first. No, you smell good. Hey. I don't want you working today. Mm. Come here. [ Sighs ] I got like 60 bucks saved. Maybe, if you want, we could go see a movie later, get Chinese. Yeah, all right. But only if we see something scary, 'cause you a little scaredy-cat. [ Grunts ] [ Both laugh ] Reddick: Well, you should have just given Jablonski the file, like we talked about. [ Police radio chatter ] This one's on me. It's not like we had nothing to go on. I mean, th-these girls, they got regular Johns, pimps. Jablonski was up. We would have been up. Even money says the wife will be booked by lunch. Yeah, it blows, but, you know, it's the job. Come on. Let's go. Where are we going? There's a place down in The Jungle-- Beacon House, Beacon Home. They take in runaways. We might get lucky. Jesus freaks. Great. I was talking to Linden about this case she closed. Whoa. - You talked with Linden about this? - Yeah. There's a reason she's not a cop anymore. I had a hunch-- came up empty. Well, that's what you get when you learn from a bad first partner. At least with Linden, you got to learn if the carpet matched the drapes, huh? Yeah, night shift ends, out to gas works park, - bend her over the hood... - Hey. - ...watch the sunrise. - It wasn't like that, all right? - Hey, whatever you say, partner. - Look. I told you the name 10 times. So, then, what's your problem, man? Kallie Leeds-- L-E-E-D-S. Just look it up. Jesus. Damn, instant karma's a bitch, ain't it, little man? Look. Have you seen this girl in the tombs? Is that your little lady? It's a nice ring. You give that to her? Where did you find it? A gum-ball machine? Your friend's not in the system. Didn't pick up anyone named Kallie Leeds last night. Well, there you go. She ain't here. Case closed. You are welcome. Hey, Sergeant. [ Spits ] Official hanging procedures-- you believe this? No longer you hold the left leg, I hold the right leg. We got to do homework to kill this asshole? This son of a bitch wants to be hanged. I got a rope and a lawn chair. What's the holdup? The academy didn't teach you how to get dressed? Henderson: [ Sighs ] Sorry. Billy started teething. My wife's going crazy. We're not really sleeping. Yeah, well, that sucks. Still, your focus has got to be right here. - You do your eight, then you hit the gate. - Yeah, yeah. You just keep pounding them Red Bulls. Uh-huh. [ Sniffs ] Yeah. [ Spits ] [ Sighs, sniffs ] 27 years, I've never seen anybody not take the needle. Seward's turning this whole place into a three-ring circle jerk. How many executions you done? Left arm twice. Brown two years ago. Elledge in '01. Working an execution's like being called up to the show. Open six! [ Buzzer ] You're kind of like the southpaw of the rotation. More like the specialist in the pen. Ray: Hey! I want to make a phone call! Go shut him up. Let's go! Open six! Man: Open. [ Gate clicking ] Opening six. Copy that. Closing six. You know the drill, Seward. Phone call's only after yard time. I need to call my lawyer. I thought you didn't have a lawyer anymore. How old's your kid? What? Mine did the same. Must be, what, uh... two months, three? Four. You got to take off your shirt when you burp them. I saved a few of mine that way. [ Sighs ] My lawyer's gonna help me see my kid one last time. I got to talk to him. Turn around. Put your hands through the hole. [ Handcuffs clicking ] Well, look what the rain washed in. Come on in. Well, there's always pressure from somewhere, you know? But, uh, I'll leave the politics to the politicians. You know, heading up special investigations-- it's-- it's where I belong. You still take your coffee black, Sarah? I do. Thanks. [ Sighs ] So, uh, how's, uh... how's civilian life treating you? It's good. Yeah, I love the island. It's really been a change for the better. Well, you look good. I'm happy for you. [ Sighs ] Now, I must have been off the street too long. I mean, I assume... this is why you're here? Aren't that many cops who know what it's like having one of their guys executed. I always had questions. You know that. Well, you worked a solid case out. The DA thought so. The 12 members of the jury did, too. But nothing's 100%-- not in our line of work. You know that. Trisha Seward's finger was broken postmortem. I went back through the case file. It was, uh, her ring finger, but we never found a ring on her body or at the crime scene. Yesterday, a working girl was found in West Seattle with... her throat cut ear to ear, just like the Seward woman-- broken finger, missing jewelry. Finger broken, jewelry missing. It's a stretch, I know. But what if there's a connection? What if-- Ray Seward didn't kill his wife? Yeah. [ Sighing ] Seward called me here... today, at my home. That's right. He invited me to his execution. He said, "Bring the wife, the kids, and a bag of Ding Dongs." [ Chuckles ] He requested hanging... which he'll have. Yeah. I should go. Please tell Jen thanks for the coffee. Those aren't the actions of an innocent man, Sarah. I just want to be sure we're executing a guilty one. [ Engine turns over ] [ Seat belt clicks ] Stay away from us. I've forgiven him, but I don't ever want to see you again. [ Horn blows ] [ Sighs ] What's going on? I mean, I thought we had a good thing, Sarah. Last night, and then some guy shows up, - and you-- - You don't know me. What? I break things. [ Voice breaking ] I do- - I break them, and they don't ever get fixed. But this thing, this one thing-- Sarah. I can help. Just let me help you. Sorry. [ Sighing ] [ Car door opens, closes ] [ Knock on door ] Pastor Mike: What is it? Seattle PD. We've got some questions about this kid Ashley-- Yo! It's the police! Open this damn door! I'm gonna need to see some identification. Whatever you say, Padre. Got some questions about a girl-- one of yours. Ashley Kwon. Happy to have a convo after I see some ID. All right, you want to see some ID? Here you go. Hey. What's with the security, Padre? Some of the girls' pimps or ex-boyfriends come in here, claiming to be family or social workers or whatever, trying to take them back. Yeah, okay. So, the last time you saw Ashley Kwon was five days ago? Yeah, she had a bed here for a few nights, - then she went awol. - Huh. You don't seem too surprised about how she ended up. Well, after being here a few years, there's not a lot of surprises left. That's Ashley? Yeah. Did she have a pimp? Run with the street family? I don't pry into their lives. Beacon is a safe space. No questions asked. They can come here, and they can be kids again, even if it's just for a few hours. That's the most recent photo I've got. We've been asking around all the usual places. Do you know anywhere off the grid where Ashley might have stayed? Uh, there's a motel off 99- - Queens. I know she's stayed there before. It's kind of a last resort for some of the kids if they can't get a bed here or the other shelters. Thanks, Father. Yeah, and to answer your question, Detective, if I don't keep track of these kids, no one will. And it's "Pastor," by the way. So you're just the light at the end of the tunnel. No, the light at the end of the tunnel is the train that's speeding towards them. I'm just trying to pull them off the tracks. [ Zipper opens ] All right. All clear. [ Sighs ] Lucky number seven. Last time you got to piss in front of me. I know how much you're gonna miss it. [ Both chuckle ] So, you've been doing really good. How's everything else? Look like you lost some weight. You been eating? Yeah. Every day. Probation's almost up. We got to start thinking... [ Zipper closes ] about the next move. Did you, um, check out any of those GED classes I talked to you about? No, not really my thing. No, as soon as I clear this, I'm heading to LA, doing some modeling and acting. Yeah, the problem with dreams is that they stay dreams, not reality, for most. Remember, you got to be the one to make things happen, so stay clean, focused, and, um, I'll see you next week with the results. Sweet. [ Door opens ] [ Water runs ] Yeah, when Twitch starts modeling, he said we'll have lots of money and we won't have to pull dates anymore. He said you could come with him to California? Hell, yeah, he did, like he was begging me. "Please, baby. Please, please, please." And I was like, "Okay. Maybe." Hey, Lyric, you looking fine, girl. Don't run away from me, bitches. I got a limp. Okay, be like that. You're all-- you're all-- you're all teeth, anyways. That's why you only suck dime slots and high-schoolers. Yo, what's up, guys? Young man: What's up, Bullet? Any of you guys seen Kallie around? Hey, shorty. I seen Kallie. Where? 7-Eleven. Candy aisle. Chicken-head slut got her throat cut. - Now she a PEZ dispenser. - Do you want me to kick your ass, huh? Is that what you want? You better get up out of my face, bitch. [ Scoffs ] You gonna shoot me? Is that what you're gonna do? All right, Goldie. Come on. Shoot me. Pull the trigger. That's what I thought. You're nothing but a punk-ass pussy bitch. I got more balls than you. Okay. Y'all know we're just joking, right? - You better watch your bitch ass. - Yeah? You better watch yours. [ Buzzer ] You get one. Look, I take full responsibility. Shut your mouth. You get one. You get one screw-up. The first one-- that's on me. But the next time you break protocol, that is me on you. Do you understand? Seward said he was gonna call his lawyer. He didn't call his lawyer. He called a cop. A cop, Henderson! What did he say to you? He said that, uh, he wanted to see his son. - He asked me about Billy. - Aw, that's sweet. So, just the two of you swapping baby tips like two daddies in a playground. [ Radio chatter ] Open it. [ Door slams ] [ Buzzer ] [ Gate clicking ] Go get the other guy. Tell him I want to order a Meat Lover's pizza. "Chapter one. Essentially, execution by hanging is strangulation effected by restricting the executee's air supply at the neck, unconsciousness occurring between two and four minutes, and death within 10, resulting in death by asphyxiation." Dale: That's not needed. You're a-a better man than that, Francis. Sit your ass down, Dale. Unless you want to be jacking off to memories of your girlfriend, go sit down. Hey. Hey. I knew a Jimmy Becker. He's a guard at Cedar Creek. Is there any relation? Hmm? Of course there is. It's a family business-- prison guards and racecar drivers. Well, get on with it, Francis. It was just getting good. "Depending upon the equipment used, there will be some physical trauma to the executee's body. A mathematical miscalculation can result in..." Last exit to nowhere. Why can't these kids ever find a place with a bar? If we crap out here, I'll buy the first round, all right? That make you happy? Just knock. They'll probably let you watch. Hey, mamacita. Seen this girl around? I'm a cop investigating a homicide. That jog your old-ass memory? Honey, I don't care if you're six cops. I watch shows. You need a warrant if you want to bother me. [ Chuckles ] Put the damn specs on and look at the picture. On second thought, um, you know, me and my partner here-- we need a room. You know, we work together, but we... You got an ice machine? 'Cause we're gonna settle in real tight and spend a few days making sweet, sweet love. You know, when my big old bear over here, when he-- when he gets started on that vibrating bed, he never wants to leave. [ Drawer slides ] [ Chuckles ] That's what I'm talking about. Give me a smile, mama-san. Yeah, that's it. I like it. Never seen her. Yeah? 'Cause we got a witness says our dead girl was here two nights ago. Kallie said that? Kallie was cussing up a storm in the parking lot a couple nights ago, and I had to boot her out, and now she's trying to say I know some dead girl, which is a damn lie. I try and help these kids, and this is how they repay me. [ Indistinct conversation ] Need to check my balls for lice after going in there. That girl at the station this morning-- she was looking for Kallie, thought she was missing. 5 Point or Sloop's? Your dime, your choice. Kallie got thrown out of here, she'd have to walk this road back. It's the only way back to The Jungle. I mean, t-those kids might have seen her. Clock stopped 45 minutes ago. Come on. We're here. W-we got to talk to them. Thought you were gunning for your stripes, being smart, putting cases in the black. Now we're looking for a missing girl that's not even missing? We're here, all right? It'll take a couple of minutes. Go, go. Just go. Have a talk. [ Engine turns over ] [ Horn honks ] Get in, or I'm leaving you. [ Footsteps approach ] I knocked a couple times, but... I brought some leftover cake. Ellen wanted it off the boat. She said she lacks self-control. I say live a little, but-- Just say it. Say what? I have about a million times. I mean, you're gonna do whatever it is that you need to do, and nobody's gonna convince you otherwise. Adrian drew that over and over after I found him in the apartment. He'd been trapped there for six days with his mom's decomposing body. I never told you that part. So, now you're gonna drag him back into this, make him relive it all over again? It's almost four years. In that time, he's been in and out of foster homes. He's not you, Sarah. He doesn't need you to save him. But he deserves to know the truth. Will that make it better for him or just you? [ Gate closes ] Open seven! [ Buzzer ] [ Gate clicking ] [ Chains rattling ] Where's Skinner? He's not coming. Yeah, then you're wasting my time. But he couldn't care less about you. Yeah, I remember you from the trial. You're his partner. I was. Why do you want to see him? 'Cause he lied in court. He called me a coward. He said I was weak. There's nothing weak about holding down a woman and sawing through the muscles, the tendons, in her neck, all while she's looking up at you with her windpipe cut, trying to breathe. So... you tell Skinner that I want him to be here. I want him standing right there when they put the noose around my neck. And tell him that I want him to look me in the eye, 'cause then we'll find out who the real coward is. What did you do with your wife's ring? What? Your wife. Her finger was broken postmortem. You took her ring. What did you do with it? I pawned it. - Where? - At a pawn shop. Which one? Your son, Adrian, just kept drawing this over and over. Why? Why? [ Receiver thuds ] Guard. I don't have a son. [ Receiver clicks ] [ Handcuffs clicking ] [ Door opens, closes ] And my lawyer *! It's cruel and unusual! No right moving me around! Man, you two woods just like the judge! I was railroaded! BO and short line! - Turn around. - Didn't want you to get lonely, Ray. Hey, and I want my books, too. I want my books. You know them dumbass boys down there in "D" can't read anyhow. [ Buzzer ] Aw, damn. Is that Ray Seward? Is that Mr. Big Noise? Ray. Ray. Hey, man, everybody up in here got your name in their mouth. Man, I don't know who's trending more, you or Jesus. Look, I just need some advice. Know what I'm saying? I'm just trying to figure out how I can work these fools, you know? I got my Pardon Board coming up. I wrote my own motion of appeal. You want to hear it, man? I got it right here in my head. Let me give it to you. [ Water runs ] Hey, crime fighter. Hey. Hmm. "Serenity." Mm. Sounds like a stripper's name. Yeah, actually. I should get that removed. Uh, yeah. That, okay. Um, we need to talk. Toothbrush is the first step. And next, it'll be your clothes. And then your friends, and then I'm gonna make you get me a ring. And a dog, because what I really want is a kid, but-- but I don't want to scare you off, so I have to take baby steps. Seriously, it was an-- an old white-elephant gift. Did you just, like-- what, y-your old one? It's right here. It's right here in the drawer. - You know, Marty The Molar... - Okay? ...gave that to me in third grade 'cause I had proper flossing technique. Ah, yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. So sweet to me. I got a new "Untamed Uncut" on the DVR. What? Oh, double white shark attack. Oh, snap. No joke. I'll get the microwave popcorn ready. And keep the tat. It's hot. "After chemicals are applied to one side, repeat steps three to six." All right. [ Door closes ] Check it out. What are you doing? Oh, damn, this stuff's itchy as hell. You spent all our money on this? What? I thought you said we were gonna lay low. I didn't spend it. I invested it. No, this is an investment. Well, the sooner I get my head shots, the sooner I start modeling, the sooner the money comes rolling in. Huh? I know what I'm doing. - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. Well, look, um, you know, we're still gonna need some walking-around scratch, you know, just for now. I was gonna pull a date tonight, but I got to let this stuff settle. You know, it's what the pros use. I got to leave it in all night. [ Sighs ] It's okay, baby. I can go out. Oh, Lyric, girl. You're the best. Now you want to help me do the other side? Bullet: Yo, Lyric! You seen Kallie up in here? Ever heard of knocking, Bullet? Oh, shut up. No, didn't see her. Why? 'Cause no one has. She ain't picking up her phone. She ain't at Beacon or the bridge. She's gone. She'll show up. Don't worry. Oh, Goldie's been turning out a new girl at his pad. Yeah. Didn't know? What are you talking about? I-- that's what I heard. You know he's always wanted to stick it to Kallie, so one plus one... [ Scoffs ] That is one crazy bitch. [ Siren chirps ] [ Sniffs ] [ Scream in distance ] Kallie? Kallie? You punk-ass bitch. What do you think you're doing? Huh? [ Grunting ] Stop! Get off me! Aah! Just-- think you're hard, huh? You think you're a man? You're just a little bitch that needs to be broke like the rest. [ Breathing heavily ] Stop! [ Grunts, groans ] [ Buckle clicks ] [ Whimpering ] Please, no. No. Please. [ Zipper opens ] [ Grunting ] Please. Please. [ Siren walls in distance ] No. No. It's nice of you to come and check in on Adrian, after all these years. I just wanted to see how he's doing with everything that's going on with his father. He's been doing really great lately. We're still trying to figure out the right way to talk to him about all this-- his dad, the execution. [ Knock on door ] Adrian, honey? There's someone here to see you. Oh. He's in the backyard. Adrian's very lucky. Let's go out so you can talk to him. No, I just wanted to see him. Thank you. He's been drawing again lately. Since he heard the news about his father. Subtitles by DramaFever The bullet entered from the left temple. And it's lodged just before the frontal lobe. Do whatever it takes to keep him alive. I'll do what I can. Yes, Mr. Black. Her cover has been blown. He's going in to cardiac arrest. She can still be of some use. Leave it up to me, sir. Clear! We still have an insider inside the NSS. Episode 6 What are you doing now? Do you think sulking around like this will help us find Team Leader Jung? Team Leader. Actually... they think he was shot in the head. So? Are you saying Team Leader Jung is dead or something? - No, not at all. - Snap out of it... and focus on locating the suspect's vehicle. Since they took Team Leader Jung... if we find the vehicle, we may be able to find him, too. Hurry up and move now! Let me talk to you for a minute. Did you guys know... that there were two camps being set up? So... did you find out who the spy is? The Director told us to report our findings only to him. No matter whom we have to report to first if you'd found out, you should've made an arrest right away. Who is it? - That's... - It's the Director. A few hours prior to the transfer mission, he searched for the firearms transportation log. During the mission he logged on to trace the location of Team Leader Jung and the Deputy Director. It's the Director. I know you have your theory about this. Please tell me. Ah, well... that's actually... - Hey, Mr. Kim. - Yes. These are blood and tissue samples we collected at the site. In short, it's brain tissue. I've already compared the samples with the tissues collected from the deceased IRIS agents. These were... Jung Yoo Gun's blood and brain tissue samples. If he sustained this kind of injury, he probably died at the site. Until we find his body... we can't say anything for sure. Now, Soo Yun... I'm going to Team Leader's Jung home now. While I'm gone, if you find anything new, please let me know. Lieutenant Ha... Baek San... What on earth... had happened to you? I'll... definitely find you. What's Team Leader Yoo Hae Young doing now? She was a little concerned but agreed that we should report to you first. Truthfully, we still don't have enough evidence but most importantly... we can come up with a motive. Director Kang Chul Hwan wanted to dissolve the NSS. I can't think of a better motive than that. First, figure out the Director's whereabouts during the time he was logged on. I'll give you two agents from the International Collaboration team so focus on finding evidence. Understood. You seem pretty excited. I do? What are you so excited about when we're doing another team's grunt work? There is no our or their work. Since the A Team needs hands, we should help. Newbies always stand out wherever they go. Hey, do you like it now that you're finally getting to do some field work? It must make you feel cool knowing you belong to a secret service or something. Yes. You might have expected some kind of a spectacular espionage scenario here. Not all field work is the same. This is... We're just running errands here. I wonder whether this is it? Welcome. Do you know him? Yes, I do. He comes here sometimes. He used his credit card here on the 20th. Do you remember that? Yes, I remember that. He had an expensive bottle of wine. He even tipped that day. Was he with anyone? He was here with the woman he's always with. Can we take a look at your CCTV record? Right there. What do you think? Her bag is big enough to hide a card copier. Trace Section Chief Lee Soo Jin's current location now. - I can't do it with my security clearance level. - Okay, I'll do it. Section Chief Lee Soo Jin must know where Team Leader Jung is, right? Let's hope so. Since you guys are helping us, would you mind going? I need to make a report to the Deputy Director. Of course. At this rate, we're going to stay up all night again. As you instructed, I'm deleting them all. And about Team Leader Jung... do you have him with you now? Yes. Is he still alive? No, he's dead. I see. After this call, deactivate your phone and destroy your SIM card. Why all of a sudden? What the hell are you doing? You are under arrest for leaking classified information. Since your cover has been blown they won't leave you alone. Give us information, and in return, you'll receive our protection. I don't know about anything else. But at least tell us... where Team Leader Jung is. As you can see. Are you certain of this? We are still in the process of restoring... but we traced deleted classified information in her laptop. That alone isn't enough to prove she leaked the information on our transfer mission. We also confirmed that she used your security card to access your personal computer as well as the main server room. By any chance... have you already known about Section Chief Lee Soo Jin? Based on what information, are you saying this? It reminded me of a familiar scenario. Get close to begin an intimate relationship. Using that relationship to threaten and blackmail... There was no blackmailing. Do you think I'm such a fool that I'd get manipulated knowing what's going on? I know that. At the time when the log on signature was registered, you were at home. We've also confirmed that Section Chief Lee Soo Jin copied your security card. So you... already knew? I was only following the proper procedure. If I take the procedure one step further, I'll inform you that you'll be retiring dishonorably. And I'll be the acting Director until the position has been filled. Is that what you wanted? I don't know. To be precise... rather than the position, I'm more interested in the power that position holds. I'm not sure I understand. If you could promise me a few things... you and I could be allies for a little while. Soo Yun. This is... Team Leader Jung. You know that he's been shot. Help us find him. You were also used by them. Where they took him... Why they took him... Just tell us those things. Ji Soo Yun. Tell us. Where is Team Leader Jung? - Put the gun down. - Don't come near me. Until I find out where Team Leader Jung is... this woman and I won't take a step out of this room. Since I got arrested... I'm no different than being dead. So do you think I'll be scared by this kind of a foolish act? Soo Yun, let's... A foolish act? Tell me. They took him. Just before I got arrested, I talked to the IRIS Operation Team Leader. I was curious, too. Why and where did they take Jung Yoo Gun? Whether he's still alive? So... So where is he now? I heard it clearly that... Jung Yoo Gun is... dead. That's enough now. She's lying. I know. It can't be true. Do you believe it? Team Leader Jung is really... That's really what happened? No, I don't believe it. Until I see it with my own eyes... I'm not going to believe it. Yoo Joong Won! Oh, you're here. You said you have something to report? Yes, I do. We stayed up all night searching and searching... it better be worth all the effort. Step back. But last time, she attacked suddenly. She's not that stupid. If you put this message in the newspaper, they'll send the answer. How long do you have to wait until you get an answer? The answer will come when you're just about to forget about it. Captain. Can't you move us out of this building now? Once we get an answer, you'll get out of here. There isn't even any sunlight. On top of that, you put a man and a woman in the same room like this. I almost didn't recognize you, Yun Hwa. I'm sorry about... what happened to your mother. And... I don't know whether you'll believe me or not, but... as much as you want... I do hope your sister, Sun Hwa, is alive somewhere. Hey, I didn't say anything. Really. You're here. It's Yoo Gun's first birthday picture. Perhaps I'm embarrassing him by showing you these. I think it was when he was in 5th grade. He fell and scraped his knee badly. But he never said it hurt, so I didn't even know he was injured. I finally found out after seeing his torn gym pants. When he was in pain... From when he was a child... he endured pain really well. I hope... he's enduring his pain well now. Yoo Gun. Who's the shy one here? A disciplinary action? Shooting a suspect in the middle of an interrogation... can't happen in a country governed by laws. Then since I failed to control the situation, I should be the one responsible. Ji Soo Yun needs rest, not disciplinary action. But Deputy Director... If there is any legal issue, I'll take care of it. Have you found any clues on Team Leader Jung's whereabouts? Somewhere... If I just knew he's alive... I'm sure he's still alive. If IRIS took Team Leader Jung... that means they plan to keep him alive to use him for some purpose. Do you... really think so? Trust me. If they took him, I'm sure he's still alive. IRIS, which was quiet for some time... had former NSS director, Baek San escape and attacked one of our safety houses. During that attack, Section Chief Park Joon Han was killed. Even with Baek San's warning, the NSS couldn't stop the assassination of Representative Kwon Young Chan and failed to protect Representative Jo Myung Ho. We let already the captured Yoo Joong Won escape. Lee Soo Jin who could approach the highest security clearance level acted as an IRIS spy and stole the Director's security card and leaked the NSS's classified information outside. As a result, Team Leader Jung was shot... and went missing during the transfer mission to lure IRIS in. We don't even know whether he's still alive or not. The flaws in the NSS were plainly exposed during the long past several months. No more. I can't just sit here and watch the NSS get defeated each time we face IRIS. I'll do anything to make the NSS as lean and mean as before. The President is fully on board with this initiative. You've all heard that a good offense is the best defense. Right? From this moment on, the powerless NSS will be history. Find any trace left behind by IRIS. And you go yourself to confirm it. Director Kang Chul Hwan. If you have any different opinions, please let us know now. No... Fine... proceed as planned. During Team Leader Jung's absence... Ji Soo Yun will be the acting Team Leader for the TF-A Team. Kang Byung Jin and Kim Ji Yun will become field agents from now on. The real war with IRIS... starts now. I'll be back. They always order food at night. - I'm right on time, right? - Yes. You must be working late again today. It's not working late but more like working all night. It's pretty common at our company. Bon Appetit. Fighting! Thank you. It's cold. Let's get back inside. The five nuclear arms you've hidden... where are they? When the time comes, I'll hand them over to you. Trust me. You must know this isn't a subject that could simply be dropped with just your word. I wonder why I surrendered myself to the NSS? I sacrificed everything I had for the security of this country. As I said before, the only justice I believe in is this country Korea. I wonder what IRIS wants from me? They want to take the nuclear arms and instigate a war. And I'm trying to stop that kind of atrocity from happening. The NSS will have to protect me for a while. Doesn't look like you've shared the existence of nuclear arms with the President. No, I haven't. But I will after things become more definite. Don't. It'll only cause tremendous chaos. I did say this before, but there are still shadows of IRIS left over in the NSS as well as in the Presidential House. Let's keep this a secret between us for a while. So I can't convince you to change your mind? Well, then... I hope you don't regret your decision later. Go on. Excuse me? I said to go on. Excuse me, but can I use your phone? It's me, Soo Min. Do... not... come... Starting today, your name is Baek San. You'll be living with a completely different identity. Take care of yourself first. You first mission is to clear out the dogs at the the Central Intelligence Service, including Kim Jung Yong. What happened to the woman who was there? She died... along with the baby. If you want to live, you should live quietly with the new identity we gave you. Luckily, the baby is okay. The child should take your last name instead of his father's. What about Sang Joon? How many times did I tell you? Your child's father Yoo Sang Joon is dead. What's going on? You're going to live there? It took me a while to convince my mom. I really believe Team Leader Jung is still alive. So I don't want to leave his house all dusty. Shutting myself inside a room and crying myself asleep isn't my style. Because I really believe he's still alive. I'll see you at work. [Nine months later] What would you like to have? Scotch on the rocks, please. Hello. Why are you looking at me like that? Nothing, it's just that you don't look like the type to purchase homemade bombs. Can I sit down? Soon we'll have the intelligence. Send it to me. Okay. First, let me look at the pictures of the sample and the reserve. The sample explosive confirmed. It doesn't seem like it's fake. The amount you see in those pictures should be about 200 kilograms. With that amount, you can knock down a building no problem. The place in this picture looks like the basement parking garage in this hotel. Where is the money? If you try anything funny, you won't be able to get out of this room safely. The money is also in this building. I'll bring it over. Hey, hey, run! It's a trap! I heard you almost detonated a bomb. I believe the situation was under control. I understand you were alone doing the dealing. Are you overly confident or just reckless? We discovered evidence that the weapon's dealers had dealt with IRIS. With the intensified interrogation, if we find the correlation... we'll be able to get closer to IRIS. The process was a little dangerous, but these were the best results we've had in months. Good work, Team Leader Ji. Thank you. I told Team Leader Jung this before. I told him he's a monster that could explode at any moment so he needs someone who can calm his violent energy. But now that I look at it... Soo Yun seems like more of a monster. Hey, what do you think? About what? Never mind. Please... please get me out of here. I want to get out of here. I beg you, Soo Yun. Please help me get out of here. IRIS has started to move again. Do you want to live? I need more information. Can you give me another glass? You are an expert at finding me. Hey, how can you celebrate all alone at your own party? I'm celebrating alone because it's my own party. Thank you. I guess you're right. Drink up. Are you picking up the tab today? Sure. What a woman with those bloody lips. Why? Do you think they're sexy? I guess kind of. - First Officer, First Officer. - What? There's some uranium on board! I heard the singer talking. I think they want to steal it! And Alan, he didn't kill the captain. He's innocent! What else did you see? I also sawthe man who was with Elaine. But... I didn't see his face. Security chief's on his way, Boss. All right. I'll take care of this myself. You can go now. I'll see you're rewarded. Thank you, sir! Thank you. Who are you? I've never seen you before. Why are you on the bridge? First Officer... - What do you want? - I thoughtyou'd like a drink. - I can't drink on duty. - I won't tell. I'm sorry. I know it's my fault. If only you'd caught me for stealing, I wouldn't have said all those things. I'm really sorry. I can't blame you. We're both in the same boat now. We can't blame each other. And you just saved me. But the others, they outnumber us. Now what? We have to find out exactly who is on their side. We could die at any moment. You've got to make a decision. Are you with the good guys or the bad guys? I'm with the good guys. Wait! - The radio room. - Look out. Are you all right? - Are you free tonight? - Yes, I am! Really? Let's get a drink. Yeah, good idea. We could go for a drink in my cabin. - Are you Jerry? - I'm Johnny. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Sorry, I mistook you for someone else. I'm sorry. Tracey, you'll have to learn to live withoutyour daddy. At her age, children only think about playing. Not their parents. Don't worry. I can take care of her. Butyou're a woman. What can you do alone? That's no big problem. Her father's away a lot. But we're both independent. But... What can a woman do without a man? All the loneliness! You seem upset about something. You'll find your own man soon. I saw him... go...just like that. Auntie, you can't eat that much yourself. Tracey, come on, I think we should leave her in peace. But... I just can't tell her! It's an emergency. Call the coastguard! I can't without the captain's order. The captain's been killed! Call them! - What are you doing in here? - Just call the coastguard! Shut up! Move it! - Come on! - Go away! Call the coastguard. - I'll call security. - I am security. Sorry about that. What's going on? Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come. The countdown is about to begin! Ten, nine, eight, seven... One! Alan's got away. Easy! Listen to me, the first officer and this woman are terrorists. Are you crazy? Can'tyou see I'm a singer? That's justyour cover. They want the uranium on this ship. - They've murdered the captain. - You're crazy. I've got proof of it. The first officer and she have masterminded this conspiracy. They've stolen the uranium from the captain's cabin. Come on, I'll show you. - All right, let's go. - Come on. Let's go! Come on. - Show me some action! - Roger. Don't let them escape! Getyour guns, quick! No, please. Please. - You go that way. - Come with me. Don't let them escape. Move back! Move back! No! Come on, get down on the floor! Get down. Anyone who moves dies. - You there, boss? - What's up? - The second lock's open. - Good. Keep going. What's happening down there? - One got away. - I thought my orders were clear. Sure. I'll handle him. I hope so. Get down! 'The ballroom should be through here.' Isn't it great? We meet again. This time I'll kill you. Let's see who kills who. What's happening? Jake, how are you doing? Just fine. I'm through the third lock. Just be quick. Darling, are you all right? You sure? - There's something I want... - Pardon... What's going on? We were just talking. We're all women, so you won't kill us, right? Help! It's my husband. Please help me with my husband. Darling, are you all right? Please get him some water! He has to take his pills. Please hurry! Your concern is so touching. But don't worry, it's only a mild attack. So today's your wedding anniversary? What do you want? Please! The stress could kill him! Are you all right, are you all right? - We need a doctor! Are you a doctor? - Sorry, I'm not. Isn't anybody here a doctor? Somebody save him! Please! Somebody do something! Why don'tyou do something? Darling! Why did you kill my husband? ! He's cured now. No more heart pills, isn't it wonderful? No, Tracey! Little girl, don'tyou like me? - She didn't mean to throw it. - Is that right? Don'tyou bully my mum or my dad and uncle will beatyou up! Really? So who is your daddy? He's head of security. Is that right? Your daddy's already gone to feed the fish. Would you like to join him? Tell me, is your uncle the one who hurt my face? I beg you... please don't hurt my little girl. I wantyou to cut this bitch's face. Sorry, I can't! You heard me. Go on! Get on with it! I told you, I can't do it! Here. Do it to me. Do it! Go on! You killed my husband! Get this mad woman off of me! Go to hell! Get her out of here! You're an animal. You bastard, you bastard. Why are you killing innocent people? Auntie, I'm scared. Who's that? Sandy! Tracey! Sandy! Linda! I'm sorry. Sandy! Tracey. Elaine, where are you? Can you hear me? I'm on B deck. The bitch and the girl are here somewhere. - I'll find them. - Don't screw up again. Don't worry. Auntie, I want to find mummy. Don'tyou worry, we'll go and find mummy later. I'm scared. Don't be scared, I'm here. - You bitch! - Come on! Don't think I'm frightened of you. Come on! Come on! You hit me. I'm bleeding! Does it hurt? All right, time out. That really hurts. Tracey. Tracey. - Don't kill me! Don't kill me! - It's me. - Linda! - Alan! - It's over now. - I'm so glad to see you again! Let's go. Elaine, can you hear me? Why? Why do I need to steal? Why all this killing? Why? ! Why did I have to kill? Tell me why! - Calm down! Pull yourself together. - Why? ! - Calm down! Listen! Listen! - Why? ! You had to kill to save an innocent girl's life. Please stop crying. We have to face the reality. I'm afraid we might have to kill more people. We don't have a choice, if we want to survive. Uncle, will we be killed by those nasty men? No, Tracey. I'm here... and I won't let those men hurtyou. They won't touch you, I promise. Tell me, have you been through this kind of thing before? Yes. And I lost my wife. She was killed? I can't believe it's happening again. Help me. Help me! I hope I can come back here in the morning to wake you up. Where are you going? Boss, I've opened the fourth lock. Now, the fifth one. When we reach the Philippines, a helicopter will pick us up. You're not leaving me behind. Can you take me with you? ! - The game's over, First Officer! - Where are you? I'm on the same ship as you are. But don't worry, I'll catch up with you. When I do, you'll pay for whatyou've done. Wrong. I'm sure... in a few minutes, I'll see your dead body lying on the floor. No one will ever see my face. You're wrong. I'll getyou before you leave the ship. Come on. Come on, move it. Get going! Move! What's up? Damn! There's a way out! I'll still getyou! I've got an idea. I need this more than you do. Follow me. You'd better go ahead. It's heavy! Go ahead. Go. Go on! Hold it! Drop your gun, or he'll kill me! If I drop this gun, we'll both die. - What do we do? - I'll have to letyou die. What? ! You can't! Let's pull the triggers. One... What? ! No! - Two... - No, please! Three. - Am I dead? - That gun wasn't loaded. - Why didn'tyou tell me? - You had it! You bastard... Come on. Auntie! Uncle! Where are you? I'm scared. Come on. - Hey, you! - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Turning off the power. Do you know which switch controls the safe? Don't getyourself killed! The second one from the left. The second one? Come on. Boss, the power's out so I can't finish. I'm stuck. We've only got five minutes left. Use your brain, think of something. Uncle, I'm frightened. Don't come near! Help, Uncle! The ballroom. Look! It's Tracey! Uncle! Auntie! Help me, please! - Help me! - Do something! Help me, Auntie! I do hope you like the decorations. How can you do this? Using a child to bargain with! Everybody uses everybody else. All you want is money, why did you kill all those people? Whoever saw my face had to die. They all saw your face so are you going to kill them all? Let me help you. Stop it! Let me handle it. - Sorry, I can't help you! - Move. Move! Help me, Auntie. Don't worry, I'll getyou down. Tracey, don't worry, close your eyes. Tracey, I'm sorry! Help me. Tracey, don't worry, Auntie's here. Tracey, I can't do it. I'll have to letyou go down. I'm really scared! I'm really scared! Pull her up! The detonator's under her foot. Uncle, please save me! Uncle, please save me! You've ruined my plans, now I'm gonna take you all with me! No! All right, you win. You admit defeat? I put a lot of hard work into this. Now you've ruined it all. Do you know how it feels? I want you dead. I want to send you to hell. Do you hear me? I want to send you to hell. Auntie. Are you hurt? Let's go. Happy New Year. Subs by drunken@! M*~~ [Yawning] Oh! Good morning sweetheart. — What are you gonna do today? — I've got lots of things to do. First, I'm gonna see you off to work. Then I'll probably go out on the patio and work on my tan. Then I guess I'll take a hot shower and maybe a nap. By then you should be home. Honey, maybe we should go out to dinner tonight. I don't think I'm gonna feel like cooking. That building a tan can really take it out of you. Well, Bob, I'm just bored. I wish there were summer school for third grade... — sol could at least teach during my vacation. — [Bell Dings ] Emily, working during a vacation from work is not a vacation from work. You owe it to yourself. You just gotta find something to do. — Like what? — [Knock at door] — Would you get the door? — Oh, sure. But that still leaves me with two months of nothing to do. Hi, Howard. Hi, Emily. How'd you know it was me? — You're wearing a uniform, and I recognized your face. — Oh, well... I just wanted to tell you that I just got back. I didn't even know you were out of town. I wasn't. I just got back from a party. Wow! How come you're wearing your uniform? It was a costume party. — Uh, come in, Howard. — Oh, yeah. Come in, Howard. I love costume parties, but I like to go as myself. It's pretty hard to pick up a girl when you're dressed as a chicken. Howard, Emily and I were just discussing what to do with your time off. — Thank you, honey. — Thank you very much. Thanks. You have a lot of time off, right? You're on three days, and then you're off three. Yeah, they call it "three on and three off." Oh, thank you. — What do you do with your three off? — Oh, I keep myself busy. I took up jogging last month, but it didn't work out. Emily wouldn't care for running. — How about handball? That's good exercise. — That's a man's sport. Women have hands. It's too hard. It's too strenuous. They wanna be equal. Let them do some of the hard stuff. How about Ping—Pong? No, you need a partner. Does she have any Chinese friends? Honey, where are you going? Oh, I just thought while you two were deciding... the half of me that's awake would go join the other half of me that's still asleep. I think I'll go downtown early and have another breakfast. For some reason, this didn't stick with me. — How about riding horseback? — No, I think I'll take the train. — Hi, Carol. Anything for me? — Oh, yeah, Bob. —Jerry wants to see you. He says it's extremely urgent. — Mm—hmm. — Bob, aren't you gonna see him? — You have to interpret Jerry. The last time he told me it was extremely urgent... He wanted me to have my teeth cleaned. Bob, it sounded really important. — It did? Is he free now? — As a matter of fact, he is. His 10:00 appointment just went into extra innings in a little league game. Wh—Where's my 10:00 appointment? My new patient? He called, said he'd be late. Bob, I think this one's going to be a dilly. — Why? Because he's late? — No. Because of the reason he's late. He's having trouble finding a sitter for his chimp. Gee, you'd think he could find some teenage chimps glad to pick up the extra money. Oh, I like that. — Hi,jerry. — Hey, Bob. How ya doin'? — What's extremely urgent? — Bob, do you realize... it's been six months since you had your teeth cleaned? — That's what I thought. — Bob, your teeth are your friends. You just take care of them, and they'll never leave you. I can't do it today. I got a lot of things on my mind. Well, why don't you just sit down, and we'll talk about it... and I'll get your teeth at the same time. That's good. Just hop in there. Put your little feet up. I'm all ears. Emily and I are having problems. Oh, really? —jerry, do I have to wear this? — Yes. I feel a little silly talking about my marriage with Tommy Tooth staring up at me. — Can't you turn it over? — Yes. Most kids prefer Tammy Tooth to Tommy anyway. So, what's wrong with Emily? I don't know. She's so disinterested. She has no drive, no energy. She's just happy to sit around all day and—— Okay,just open. Go on. How are you gonna be able to hear what I say with your hands in my mouth? Hey, Bob, I've had people talking to me with my hands in their mouths for years. It's kind of like understanding a foreign language. — Go ahead. — Well—— [ Continues, Indistinct] — "It happens every summer, you know." — [Continues] — "But this time, it's different." — [Continues] Worse, huh? A little wider, please. [Continues] You're afraid that it's something beeper. — Deeper. — Deeper. Right. [Continues] You're afraid that she's getting bored with you, huh? Rinse and spit. Bob, it's not you. Most schoolteachers go through this summer—boredom thing. Last summer, it happened to my Aunt Louise real bad. But when it was over, it turned out to be the best summer she ever had. — What'd she do? — She had an affair. — That's the last thing I wanna hear. — Yeah. My uncle wasn't too thrilled when he found out either. I don't know. Maybe I'm not paying any attention to her. Maybe I should take her out to dinner to a nice place. — That's fine. Just open up. — That's all the time I have right now. — I'm gonna have to close. — Bob, I'm not finished yet. I got a new patient coming in. It wouldn't look good if I was late. Hey, Bob, it wouldn't look good if you were wearing that bib either. Honey, I'm home. Emily? Are you sleeping? — Oh, hi, Bob! — Hi, honey. Where you been? I took your advice. Wait till you see what I did. Oh, Bob, look! You had your wedding dress shortened. Bob, I can't believe how I was stagnating. I almost wasted a whole half a summer doing nothing... but now I've taken up tennis, and I got all the equipment. Wait till you see. Look, Bob, a tennis sweater, huh? And wait. This is the best part. Bob, look. I got a wristband. Isn't that terrific? — Huh? — Honey, how about a tennis racket? Oh, I didn't have time to get one of those. But I borrowed my pro's, and he's gonna order one for me. — You have a pro and everything? — Yes. And he's such a sweet man. You know what? We were talking over coffee... and he says he has a lot of personal problems. Isn't that wonderful? — No, not for him. — What I mean is... when I told him you were a psychologist... he said he was looking for one, and I think he's gonna call you. Honey, you're gonna get out of the kitchen 'cause we're going out to dinner tonight. Oh, Bob, I was gonna play tennis tonight. I was just putting this in the oven for you. I could cancel if you want. No, don't cancel. How, uh, late does your pro work? Oh, I'm not playing with him. I'm playing with Howard. [Chuckles] How—— How—— Howard plays tennis? No. That's what's so terrific. I can start winning right away. When the bell goes off, honey, your dinner is ready. Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like to come and watch us? No, no. I'll just wait here for the bell to go off. — Open wider, please. — [ Indistinct] Uh—huh. I understand you completely, Bob, but I still don't know what your problem is. A few days ago, you complained because she wasn't doing enough... and now you're complaining because she's doing too much. Don't you think you're kind of hard to please? Come on. Open wider. What do you think I am, a snake? I is, of course, to partake of a small mouthful, like this, whoosh it around in the mouth like that, and then inhale like this, thus releasing the aroma... You do it your way and I do it my way. Châ... Château... Châ... teau... Savignon! It's very good. ♪ Who dat... who dat... - ♪ Who dat... who dat... - Please, sir. - ♪ Knocking at the door? - Please, sir. Please. Am dat you, Sam? - Couldn't you walk a bit more upright? - A little upright? - Yes. - ♪ A little bit more upright... ♪ Who dat... who dat... Am dat you, Sam? Please, sir. ♪ Who dat... Hey, why... why don't you sing with me, Sam? - My name is not Sam. - But sing with me! - ♪ Who dat... - Shh, shh, shh. I know the way. Follow... follow me. Here I am, young and handsome. - Oh! - Oh. I want you to meet a friend of mine. A very good friend of mine. The best friend I ever had in the whole wide world. What was your name, friend? Luchresi. Fortunato Luchresi at your service, ma'am. I am Annabel Herringbone. I was just trying to help my friend home. He had too much to drink! Asseyez-vous, Sam. No, really, I must be going. Asseyez-vous, Sam. Thank you. Come on and sit down, friend. Siddown! - You... you live in the city, Mr. Luchresi? - Yes. Yes, I do, Mrs. Herringbone. My, what a lovely cat! Well! - You like cats? - Oh, I adore them, yes. I have several of my own at home. He's... resting. Yes, he's... resting. Oh. I think he's ill. Oh. I tell you this: With women... with women you have to assert yourself. Take my case, for instance. I tell my wife to give me some money. I want to go out for the evening. Well, sir, it used to be that she gave me trouble. Argued with me and tried to withhold what was rightfully mine. But now she just gives me all the money I ask for, and I can stay away the entire night doing exactly as I please - which happens to be drinking. - Since when? - Since when? Huh? Seems to me... since that day I went to that wine sellers convention and met... And he assisted me home and I... I introduced him to my wife. - Good night, my treasure. - Good night, beloved. Let me look at you again. Until tomorrow night, heart of my heart. Oh! Good evening, dear. You gave me such a start. - Why? - I didn't expect you home so early. You didn't? I thought it would be nice if I came home early and we spent some time together. But I see you've already gone to bed. Oh, yes. I... I was very tired. Exerting yourself? Exerting? I had a very strenuous day. And a more strenuous evening, I assume. I beg your pardon? - Isn't it a little too late to beg my pardon? - I... I don't know what you mean. You lie! You dirty, faithless little trollop, you! You lie! So you know. How long has this been going on? Long enough for me to realise that our marriage is a farce, a mockery! You can no longer wound me with your cruelty. I have found, at long last, love. How touching. Mock me if you will, but this is the end. You and I are finished. I'm going to leave you and become Mrs. Fortunato Luchresi! You are? Congratulations. Good afternoon, Mr. Herringbone! - How very nice to see you again. - And how nice to see you again! - And how well you look. - Thank you, sir. And yourself as well. - Thank you. Come in. - Thank you. - After you, sir. - Oh, thank you. And how nice of you and Mrs., uh... Mrs. Herringbone to invite me for dinner. Oh, we're enchanted to have you, sir. Most delighted, I assure you. - Please. - Thank you. Ah, the cat! The cat. What a charming fellow he is! - Yes, isn't he? - Yes. And is Mrs. Herringbone about? Oh, yes. She's very, very busy preparing our dinner. - May I offer you some sherry? - Oh, I'm delighted, sir. Delighted! - Amontillado? - That's correct, sir. Ah, but what an amontillado! A wine to conjure memories of taste buds in transport. I'm terribly happy you like it, sir. To your health. - And to yours, sir. - Thank you, sir. - A draught from paradise. - That it is, that it is. Let me fill your glass. Look, mine is always empty. - Well, I cannot resist. - That I've noticed. - I beg your pardon? - No, nothing, nothing. To your long life. And to your long life, sir. Right now I have a better chance than you have. - You spoke, sir? - No, no. Nothing. - Let me fill up your glass. - Well, just a bit more. Where did you get this...- pardon me - this excellent wine? Oh, I've had that in my cellar for a long, long time. - Indeed? - Saving it for a very special occasion. - Oh, today? - Yes, sir. - What occasion? Surely not my presence. - That's part of it. And what is the other part? Your death. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'll give you three guesses. - Surely you can't mean to? - Wall you in, yes. - But why? - Ask your treasure, your heart of hearts. - What? - Ask Annabel! Annabel? I... Ann... a... bel? You... you killed her. You notice everything, don't you? Help! Please, let me go. Help! Don't make so much noise. I don't like it. - You're insane! - That may be, but... very clever. The way I put that drug in your amontillado with the consummate skill of a Borgia. And this whole arrangement. - They'll never find you behind this wall. - You can't mean it. You can't mean it! Haven't I convinced you of my sincerity yet? I'm genuinely dedicated to your destruction. Help! Help! Help! What kind of a man are you, anyway? Make love to my wife and doesn't even talk to me! It's an excellent jest, sir. We'll have many a good laugh about it in the future. I Will. I Will. God... For the love of God, Montresor... Yes. For the love of God. Nice professional job. She must have it hidden somewhere. Eureka! Everybody back to the counter! Montresor is buying again! Gentlemen, let's have a toast, huh? To my precious wife, without whose money this most splendid evening would be impossible. Where she is now, she won't need it anyway. ♪ Who dat knocking at the door? Is dat you, Sam? Argh! Argh! Aaargh! Give me back my head! Keep that cat from my head, will you? ! Keep that cat from... Give me back my head! Aaaaargh! Huh! Go away! I said... go away! - Mr. Herringbone? - Yes. - We knocked, but no one answered. - The door was ajar, so we looked in. Then when we found the house in such a state... In such a state? Oh, yes. I... I remember I was searching for something last night. We thought there'd been some trouble, so we came right in. - Are you all right, sir? - I'm all right! We've received a report from a Mr. Wilkins. He's the bartender at the Red Lion Tavern. You know Mr. Wilkins. Claims you spent a rather large amount of money last evening. Well, it's my own money. Can't I spend my own money? Further, that you said that your wife wouldn't need the money where she is. Might I ask, sir, where your wife is? She's gone. She left with her lover. I don't know where she is, nor do I care. Are you ill, sir? No, I... No. You don't happen to have a little whisky on you, boys, huh? No, sir. You see, I've had hallucinations lately. Been drinking a little bit too much last night. I see. Do you mind, sir, if we search the premises? No. Where do you want to start? I think... the cellar. The cellar. Oh. Are you coming down, Montresor? - Did you hear anything? - No. - No. - I didn't think so. Well, here we go, gentlemen. Yes. Come on down. I... I think I'll drink a little less in the future. Now he decides. - Shut up. - What? Nothing, nothing. I just keep mumbling. I had too much to drink. - We had better make a thorough search. - Search? Don't you find everything all right and in order? Go ahead, search everything you want. I don't care. Montresor! What a thing to say. Naughty, naughty, Montresor. Keep quiet! Whoo-ooh! Whoo-ooh! Right behind here, Mr. Policeman. We're right behind the wall! Right behind it. Are you blind, Mr. Policeman? Whoo-ooh! You're not paying attention. You're getting cold. This way. Now are you satisfied? What do you think? I buried them down here? That's exactly what he did. Exactly! Where would I have hidden them? Under this floor? Or... or maybe in that wall, huh? Look! Look how solid it is! Look at it! Look! What in the name of God? - You can hear it too? - Hear it? What's behind there? Nothing. Nothing at all. Well, we'll see. What exactly is it that occurs at the moment of death? Especially to a man who, in that moment, is not permitted to die. As in the case of Mr. Valdemar. There is no pain. No... Dairy. You are at peace, mind and body at peace entirely. Yes. Then listen to the sound of my voice. Carefully. Pain vanished. Mind and body in a state of peace. You understand this, Valdemar? I... under... stand. Then sleep. Sleep. Sleep. When my hand passes across your face, waken. - Are you all right? - Perfectly, my dear. - The pain, it's gone? - Vanished! What is your finding, Doctor? - Well, you seem to be in good condition. - Seem to be? But I am! Oh, come now. Admit the truth of it: Mesmerism works! It works. I've never doubted that it works, sir. Only its advisability in certain cases. It would certainly seem to be advisable in the case of Mr. Valdemar. Or would you have me suffer untold agonies of pain in order to observe strict medical protocol? - Ernest! - My sweet Helene. Forgive me, both of you, for my most untimely sense of humour. But this is a joyous moment. Smile! Come. Let us drink. Let us drink to mesmerism, the ministration of the gods. I'm sorry, I can't drink to that. Then drink to the health of my beautiful wife. - To the very good health of you both. - And to Mr. Carmichael. Sir. How blessed to be free of pain. For that part, sir, I am truly happy. Please believe me. It's for the other aspect of mesmeric influence that I feel concerned. - Which is, Doctor? - Perilous toying with the human mind. But, my dear Dr. James, what is perilous about it? Mr. Valdemar has received nothing but advantage from its applications. And, as we all know, he is dying of an incurable disease. - I wish you'd stop refer... - Helene, Helene. The issue must be acknowledged. Within this skull - as well you know, Doctor - there is tissue which is dying even as I speak. I am physically doomed. I do not say this out of bitterness or despair. However, there is one favour I would ask: To escape a pitiful and painful decline to death through the auspices of Mr. Carmichael. - Would you deny him this, Doctor? - No, sir. And yet, you know, he will accept nothing for this blessing, save some trifling favour on my deathbed. - Sir? - Favour, Ernest? I should not even have mentioned it. It's so slight. No, please. I want to know. Well, my dear, it's simply... You tell them, sir. You can explain it so much better than I. Mr. Valdemar has consented to be mesmerised in articulo mortis. - Which is to say... - At the point of death. I fear it sounds more dreadful than it really is. What does it mean? Ernest, why? To ascertain just how long the actual moment of death can be forestalled. A momentous experiment. Momentous? Monstrous would be more the word! Sir, I appeal to you, withdraw this offer. The deathbed is no place for lunatic experiments. My dear young friend, what can it matter whether I die 10 or 20 minutes beyond that point when I shall die at any rate? What could be less important? I owe this gentleman a great deal. A great deal. I could not dream of refusing him such an insignificant request. As you say, sir. - I fear I must leave now. - So soon? I am sorry. Good night, Doctor. Thank you for attending me. My dear, show our friend to the door, will you? Yes, of course. A bit more wine, Mr. Carmichael? Hm? Oh! Thank you. Elliot, this experiment... Do everything in your power to dissuade him from it, Helene. I've no proof that it's dangerous, no proof whatever. I only sense that it might be. What is it, Elliot? Why is it that since that man entered our life I can't think, I'm uncertain... Oh, he helps Ernest. I can't argue with that. He seems to relieve him of all pain. To see him suffer is more than I can stand. - But at the same time... - You distrust Carmichael? Yes, I do. Still, it's true that he asks for nothing. Perhaps he asks for nothing because he desires everything - including you. You can't be serious. - You haven't seen him looking at you? - Yes, but... Of course I've no right to say this, really, for I too look at you. Elliot, please. You know how I feel. I love my husband and respect him. - No more than I do. - I know that. So let us think of nothing else but Ernest and our respect for him. - Good night, Helene. - Good night. Ernest. Hm? Oh. Yes, my dear? Won't you reconsider? - Regarding the experiment? - I fear him. Fear Carmichael? But, my dear, think of the pain he has spared me. If only you could see the change in him when you're under his control, Ernest. All the fawning ceases. He no longer calls you Mr. Valdemar. It's just Valdemar. - He tells you what to do, what to think. - Please, my dear. No more. Let us forget it. It is established and of no importance. What is important is you. I wish with all my heart that following my death you would marry our good Dr. James. No, no, no. Please, my dear. Let me finish. I know that there is a bond between you. All honourable. I know that too, and I love you both for it. But I... I am going to die soon, Helene, and it would make me very happy to know that you would not be alone, that you would marry again. Oh, my dear. Your happiness means more to me than anything. Anything! But I refuse to die until that happiness has been assured. It... it approaches, does it not? No pretence, please. It approaches. No, my dear. No sorrow. I... I am content, believe me. Have you informed Mr. Carmichael, as I requested? - He is below, sir. - Then fetch him, if you will. Quickly. Go quickly. Have a care, sir. So... the time has come, Mr. Carmichael. It will be to you, sir, I promise, no more than sinking into a dreamless sleep. Best hurry, Mr. Carmichael. Now, no despair, I implore you. It is peace I go to. Freedom from this ghastly pain. Your hand, Doctor. I charge you this... upon your soul: Watch over my Helene. - Swear to it? - I swear to it. Rest easily, sir. I do now. With all my heart I thank you... for having added to my life one great, sweet measure of devotion. No... You may proceed, Mr. Carmichael. Look at the turning wheel, at the changing of the colours, and sleep. Deep... deep sleep. Your body losing all sensation. Your mind enveloped in darkness. Nothing can disturb you now as you drift ever deeper into darkness... and sleep. Sleep... Sleep... Valdemar. Do you hear me? It is my voice. I... hear. Are you asleep? I... am... asleep. Valdemar, raise your right arm. Lower it. Is there any pain? No... pain. I am... dying- Oh! Please... do not wake me. Let me... die. I will not wake you, Valdemar. Deep... deep sleep... from which there is no waking... unless I say. - You understand, Valdemar? - I... understand. You may examine him now if you wish. Do you so fear me? I have but released your husband from his pain once more. - Would you have had me do otherwise? - No. - Then do I... personally offend you? - Please, Mr. Carmichael, not now. Valdemar, return to your sleep. Return to your sleep, Valdemar! - I command you! - Stop it! Valdemar. Do you hear me? Do you hear the sound of my voice? Are you asleep now? I... have been... asleep. But now... I am... dead. You are asleep, Valdemar. No. Yes, yes, yes. You do but sleep. Raise your right arm. Raise it, Valdemar! I command you! Raise your right arm! He does not. He does not. He is dead. Yes, he is dead. But still aware. - Release him. - Release him? ! Valdemar, do you hear me? I hear. Tell me, where are you? Darkness. - Stop it! - That will do, Mr. Carmichael. Where, Valdemar? Where? Stop it! - End the control, Mr. Carmichael! - No! Valdemar, tell me what you see. - Your surroundings, what are they? - That will do! Are you insane? ! Do you not comprehend the import of what has happened? His body is dead, but his mind lives on, controlled by me! - Which control will now end! Let him die! - No! Be gone! Where am I? What place is this? I see only darkness. People. Multitudes of people. No... No-o-o-o! No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Valdemar, be still. Help me. Be still, Valdemar. I will let you go when I am finished. Your whisky, sir. Leave it there. Get out! Valdemar. Valdemar, do you hear me? Be still. Be still! Release me. Release me. Give me peace. Be still! Release me. Let me go. I will release you when I am ready. - Good evening, Doctor. - Good evening. - Is Mr. Carmichael upstairs? - Yes, sir. Thank you. Come. I promise you an end to it, Helene. HOW? Come. Now, tell me this. Come in. - What can I do for you? - I'm here to order you, Mr. Carmichael... Not request, but order. You will end the mesmeric control immediately. - Will I, Doctor? - You will. And how do you propose to enforce that order? With this. - You wouldn't dare. - Do you choose to take that risk? If you kill me, Valdemar will remain in the same state indefinitely. - Perhaps for ever. - No! - I shall count to three, then I shall kill you. - Elliot! - You must be out of your mind. - One. - No. - Two. - Elliot, no! - Wait a minute. - I want you to hear something first. - Nothing from you, sir. Did I say it was from me? If you will, come with me. Valdemar. Tell them what you told me just now, about Helene. I do not wish for her to marry Dr. James. I wish for her to marry Mr. Carmichael. - No! - You heard him, madam. - You control him. His words are yours! - That is a lie! - Is it? - Yes! Elliot, please, you must leave now. - What? - I want you to go. - But that was not your husband speaking! - It was his voice. - But not his will! - I don't know that. - Helene, in the name of God! - Elliot, please go. There's nothing more to be said or done. I just want you to go now. Very well. But I shall be back. And God help you if you do her harm in any way. - Well, madam? - I believe Dr. James is quite correct. It is not my husband who would have me marry you. - You heard him with your own ears. - It was not him. However, I will make a bargain with you, Mr. Carmichael. I'll marry you... upon the stipulation that you set my husband free. I need make no bargains with you, madam. - What? - You will marry me in any case. No. Not unless you end his torment. Edicts, madam? Orders from you? Allow me to enlighten you. I am in command here. You will do as I say, or I will leave Mr. Valdemar exactly as he is and never, do you understand me, madam? , Never let him go. I've coveted you these many months, hungered for you. And now you shall be my wife. I shall take what I desire. - Your body and your soul, if I demand it! - I've heard enough! No! Stop it! Let me go! Let me go! You're hurting me! Help! Help me! Let me go! Help! Help me! No! Argh! Helene! Helene! Ugh! ripped by qwerzz Go, swim away! You're free now. The two snake spirits White snake is the elder, green snake is younger. They are always caring for and helping each other. It's so boring here as celestial beings. And so lonely too. Everyday just drags on. Everything remains the same here. To be joyful one should go to the mortal world. It's certainly warmer there. Seek fun in the mortal world. Romance is sweet in the world of humans. If you know the mortal world is fun, ...why not go there to live? I'd sure like to. But I fear the heavenly rules and punishments. Well, I've had enough here, I'll take my chances. I've decided to take a trip there. Please take care of our home. You treat me like your younger sister, we go through everything together. I will worry if you go alone. Of course I too would like to go with you. After Xu Xian paid his respects to his ancestors, ...he took his time on the way home. Gazing tirelessly West Lake's picture-perfect scenery. There, unexpectedly, he'd meet a beauty by the shore. Dear sister. He's neither kith nor kin, why are you so lost in thought over him? We have just got here to the mortal world, and you seem to be like, totally besotted! It's true that we don't know him, but... I remember him saving my life once perhaps eons ago. That's in his past life, of course you wouldn't know. Oh, so then he's your benefactor. I have to pay my debt of gratitude. I need to get to know him first, ...and I'll need your help. Hey, look. Boatman, would you go to Qingbo Gate? Yes. Hop on. Please come closer. Be careful. Boatman. Where are you heading to? We're going to Qingbo Gate. Could you take us? Of course, this master is going that way. Come on, you two. Watch out! It's slippery. Mister. My lady invites you to sit inside. There's no room. I don't want to cause you any inconvenience. Mister, since we are travelling together, there's no such thing as inconvenience. Please come in. - Come on. - Please stop pulling. It's fine. I'll come in. It's fine. Sure. Let me hold the umbrella. That's alright, thank you. Please sit down. Please. Just sit down, or my boat will rock over. May we know your name, mister? Xu Xian. So it's Mr. Xu. Yes. Sorry to bother you. Don't be so modest. Boatman. You can't take their money. I should pay. It's the same. Give her money back, I'll pay you. Let me pay... It's the same. You shouldn't have. You're most welcome. Qingqing. We ought to move on, looks like it might rain. Is that so? It's raining again. It's quite heavy, what should we do? Please take this umbrella, miss. We can't... what about you? It's fine, I live close by. Thank you. You're welcome. Let's go, it's getting heavier. Where do you live, mister? I'll return the umbrella to you tomorrow. Don't worry. I'll pick it up from your residence tomorrow. Good idea. Outside Qingbo Gate, there's Qianwang Temple. Beside it is a red door; with character "Bai" on it. That's my home. I'll pay you a visit tomorrow. Mister, you can get off too. Alright. Playing in the woods a thousand years ago, I was held hostage by a naughty child. Luckily my benefactor was there to help, ...or else I'd be beaten to death. I must repay this favour, I'd like to marry him. "Bai Residence" Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu, why are you leaving? My lady worried that you can't find us, she sent me here to welcome you. Please come inside. My lady has been expecting you. Please have a seat, Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu. Please sit down, Mr. Xu. After you, miss. Are you busy at work? Yes, I work in a shop. We're busy all the year round. The dishes are getting cold, I'll check in the kitchen. Please have another drink. Please. The wine's getting cold, I'll fill this up. Be seated, please. No, I can't drink too much. Don't worry, you won't get drunk. Sister. Should I send him off? Qingqing. I must remind you, although you're in love with Mr. Xu, and we've checked his background out. But still, you never know. I request you to think it over. Qingqing, I appreciate your concern. But about Mr. Xu, he's honest and sincere. There's not a lie coming from him, he's not like the others. If you love him that much, I'll talk to him. You're dashing and polite, young and good looking. Your wife must be very lucky, I'd say She's fortunate to have a husband like you. My parents died when I was very young, I work live at my brother-in-law's pharmacy. I'm not married yet, so how would there be a wife as you say? One should get married on coming of age. Say, even if not married you should be engaged. I have no assets and no abilities, ...how could I get engaged? Okay, so you're not engaged now, you don't plan to stay single forever, do you? No matter what, you don't have to worry about me. I don't think it's a good idea to be single. Let me be your matchmaker. There's a young spinster I know of; She's prettier than the fairies. Even if she is, she certainly won't marry a poor man, right? But this young lady that I speak of... she's marrying for love, not for money. To fall in love it's got to be predestined. Otherwise it won't work. If it's not meant to be, how could she fall in love at first sight? She'd have to meet me first, before she could fall in love. You've met her, and you've talked to her. Please don't pretend to be a fool. I've met and talked to her? Are you teasing me? Whom are you referring to? My lady Miss Bai Suzhen. I'm a junior worker in a pharmacy, I am no match for your lady. I'm from a poor family, I've no assets, ...how could I get married? Haven't I told you? She's not interested in betrothal money. There's no need to worry. I appreciate your kindness. I however, must talk to my elder sister and brother-in-law first. Then I'll give you an answer. What if your sister says no? She would of course consider. Wait a minute, I'll ask my lady to come here, ...and you can have a talk. Shoulder to shoulder, side by side. In a pair, under the full moon. Like a fish in the sea, husband and wife will be together forever. Very much in love, the couple is thrilled. The hills and the willow trees on the side, ...the little boat sails on. My dear wife... You're a rare gem, such a romantic. You are willing to marry a poor man like me. I'm ashamed that I haven't achieved my goals yet, I feel bad not being able to provide you a good life. We're husband and wife now, don't be so modest. I'm not marrying for money; As long as our love can last forever, ...I can live a simple and poor life. Even if you put vanity aside, one would still need money to live a simple life. My income is limited, I reckon it will be difficult for us. Don't worry, I have it all planned out. I have many relatives in Suzhou city. They'd all be willing to lend a helping hand. I've been practising medicine since I was young, ... I've been handed down a 'cure-all' prescription. Let's move to Suzhou. We'll open a clinic. Xu Xian bid his sister goodbye and moved away. "Baohe Clinic" Business at the new clinic is going well. Bai Suzhen is a good doctor. She can cure all. She can even cure all kinds of hopeless cases. One dose of her prescription will do the trick. Their reputation has spread far and wide. The clinic is often packed. "Luzu Temple" Incense sticks for sale... I'll burn incense sticks under my master's order. I'm passing by, and it happens to be Luzu's birthday. That's why I'm here to meet and greet new friends. Charms, amulets for sale. Guaranteed to keep off all troubles and evil spirits. Work like magic they do. My name is Guo Wei, I can summon wind and rain. I know how to ward off evil spirits. You are here to pay your respects to Luzu, don't miss the chance to buy my charms. Strange, I can feel some evil spirit. It's you to flush the spookiness around! Nonsense! We all know Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu and his wife are life-savers; Evil spirits? That's ridiculous. Everyone. What evil spirits? No one believes you. He indeed has evil force around him. And it's from someone close to him. What rubbish! Your wife is a monster. That's sheer nonsense. Tell me then, what kind of a monster is she? Speak up. Speak up. Where? Monster? If you can't tell, ...I'll wreck your booth. Wreck it! I couldn't say what kind of a monster she is, but I'm certain that she's the one. If you don't get rid of her, your life is in grave danger. Taoist priest, you are much older than me, I'll let you get away this time. I'd be a conman if I take your money. Now, I'm giving you three charms for free. Come here to thank me tomorrow. He makes sense. What if she isn't? If she isn't... What do you say? Wreck his booth. Fine! It's a deal. Alright. Alright. Here you go. Hide the first one in your hair, then the devil wouldn't hurt you. Place the second one above your door, then she couldn't escape. Burn the third one in front of her, and her true identity... will be revealed! What a silly Taoist priest. A third grade fortune-teller he is. I've been a snake spirit for a thousand years, do you think I'll be scared of your charms? But my husband is confused, I must try to lift his suspicion. I must solve this puzzle for him. Are you alright, dear? What do you want to tell me? I met a Taoist priest at Luzu Temple. He just kept insisting that you're a monster; Moreover, he has even given me 3 charms. This is ridiculous! Go on then, try it out! See if it works. What if it doesn't? If it doesn't, I'm going to wreck his booth tomorrow. Go on then, try it out! Go on. I'm worried that you couldn't handle it... So you believe what the Taoist priest said? You think that I'm some evil spirit. If I burn this you will... my true identity will be revealed. Dear, it's just a scam, You shouldn't listen to such gossip from now on. Especially not those conmen. I won't listen to such nonsense anymore. I'll go wreck his booth right now. Dear. Dear. Where do you think you're going, Taoist priest? Do you think you can bully people ...with your voodoo? Are you scared of me? Taoist priest. Miss Qing... Please spare me... Sister. Are you alright? Congratulations! What is it, dear? Dear. Should I congratulate you or myself? Congratulations! Mr. Xu... What is it? Miss Qing, where is Mr. Xu? What is it? There's a monk outside who wants to meet the master. A monk. What is it? There's a monk here to see you. Give him a donation and send him off. He's not here for money or for consultation. He wants to see you; Um... it seems rather important. What does he want from me? Strange. Do you know who that monk is? Monk Fahai of Golden Mountain Temple. Master, are you looking for me? You don't know me, but I know you are Xu Xian. Do you have advice for me, master? This is not such a good place to talk; There's an open space over the bridge, ...let's walk over there. Only my family's here, we can talk at ease. This is kinda private, we better talk over there. After you. Don't let anyone disturb us. Yes. I don't collect alms nor am I connected to medicine. But this is important, I must warn you. Please, master. Listen well: Your wife is a white snake spirit. A white snake spirit? Also, her maid is a green snake spirit. Both snakes could be trying to harm you. I don't believe any of this! I'm just a poor man, why do they want to harm me? They've done nothing but good deeds. In fact people call my wife "Empress Bai". Well, that's her bewitching charm. The white snake spirit is very powerful. If you don't leave her, ...you might die. You see, it was fate that brought us together. Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple to become a monk. That way, you can stay alive. I don't aspire to be a monk. Don't be so stubborn! Trouble is upon you. Thanks for your concern, master. I don't believe they are snake spirits. And I don't think they are trying to harm me. Most of all, I don't want to become a monk. Thank you. So you still don't believe me. No, last time I got tricked by ...some Taoist monk. Guess I won't believe any of this again. That Taoist monk must be incompetent. Fine, if you don't believe me, wait till the Dragon Boat Festival; And you'll know it's all true. Amitabha Buddha. High noon sun on Dragon Boat Festival is unbearable, Snakes and insects are in panic. The realgar wine being naturally very potent, Snakes insects will keep at bay or suffer from it. Over here it's the festival preparations, others are in panic. The red sun shines brightly, the scorching heat is unbearable. It's almost noon; you better hide, Qingqing! We'll go through... bliss and misfortune together. I can't leave you on your own. I can't let you suffer all by yourself. I'm more powerful, I think I can handle it. You better go, don't waste anymore time. I want to be here with you. Qingqing. Dear. It's been so busy at work these days, at least we have a day off today. Have a cup of realgar wine, let's celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival. But I can't drink, not at all. Just have a sip, you'll be fine. I'm pregnant, I can't take realgar. That's actually good for you, ...you will be fine. You should have a few drinks too, it's refreshing and it detoxicates. I... I can't drink. Qingqing, watch out. Yes. Dear. I told you I can't drink. Just smell it. No. It smells so good. Very well then, just one sip. Okay. No more. No more. Come on. Are you alright, dear? What's wrong? I... I need to lie down. Dear. You look terrible. Is it nausea? I'm fine. Don't come in, I just need to lie down for a while. My dear, I'm bringing you medicine. Qingqing, my wife needs help. Hurry! Dear. Dear. Take some medicine, you'll feel better. Sister. Sister. Master Xu was frightened to death by you. Where is he? My dear. I wanted to repay you. But I scared you to death It's all because of Monk Fahai. It's his fault. He tried to alienate us. I didn't want you to suspect, that's why I drank the wine unwillingly. This is terrible. Stop crying, don't be sad. We must try to save him. But he's dead. What can bring him back to life? Only the glossy ganoderma, yet it's on the summit of Kunlun Mountain. Thank you for reminding me, I'll go right away. I know the danger I'll face, but for my husband, I must go. After I've got the ganoderma, I'll come back right away. If I'm not back within three days, ...it means that I'm dead. In that case, you must leave after burying my husband. Master Xu, my sister did this for you. She might not live. Qingqing. Sister. I'll be off then. Take care of him. Don't worry. You... just go. Riding the clouds to Mount Kunlun. All for the sake of her beloved. Desperate to bring him back to life, She'll beg for the venerable old man's mercy. How dare you pick-up the ganoderma? Celestial spirits. Please wait, let me explain. You're a thief! What more do you want to say? Stop it... Step back... It's you, White Snake! Please spare me, venerable old man. I'm Bai Suzhen, the sinful. I tried to steal the ganoderma to save my husband. I just hoped to repay him for saving me in past life, and now he's dead because of me. After some thought, I decided to risk by coming here. Please have mercy on me; Allow me to bring this to the mortal world. Trust me, I'm not trying to escape, I don't expect to be spared. I just want to bring my husband to life. Then I'll return for my punishment. I'm willing to die for this. If you want to save your husband, you should have told us first. You've committed a theft, it's hard to talk your way out. She's pregnant, and she didn't mean bad. I'll let her go this time, but this won't be let off again. Give the ganoderma to her, White Crane, Yellow Deer. Thank you! After Bai Suzhen thanked the venerable old man, she left in gratitude. Heading back to the mortal world, she is hurrying home. My dear. You... My dear... My dear. What have you seen? When I brought you the medicine, I saw a big white snake on the bed, ...it was so scary. I've killed the snake, it's hanging on the tree. Do you want to take a look? No. You better go, I don't want you to conjure up crazy stories, go on. Are you still scared? Don't worry, I'll go with you. Alright then, I'll go. There, it's hanging on the tree. Master Xu, look. It's dead. Master Xu. Go back to the room to rest. You're no monster, that monk is full of nonsense. Say, if I was really a monster, will you stop loving me? What are you talking about? We love each other. I don't care if you were a monster. Without affection, human is not as good as a monster. I'm glad to hear that. So you are true to me. Let me tell you the truth now. I'm indeed a snake spirit. You've saved me in your past life, I'm here to repay you. I hoped we can grow old together. That we'll forever live happily. Then came the cold hearted monk Fahai; he just wouldn't give up. I don't want anyone to come between us. I don't want anyone to be in the way. Telling you the truth is my only option. Don't worry. We've been a couple for quite a while, our love is real. We don't need to worry. It doesn't matter whether you're human or a spirit, nothing can come between us. Master Xu. Good day, master. It's fate! Here we meet again. Master. You can't go back, you will only be hurt by the monster. Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple to become a monk. That's your only chance to be saved. Even if my wife is a monster, I'm not scared of her. She's nice to me. She revealed her true form on Dragon Boat Festival, ...and you were scared to death. I'm here to save you. Okay, so I was scared to death on Dragon Boat Festival ...where were you? You weren't there to save me. Instead, my wife risked her life and brought the ganoderma in order to restore my life. That's because I knew it wasn't your time to go yet, ...that's why I wasn't there. Let's not talk about this. Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple to become a monk. I don't want to be a monk. Please let me go home. I've no business with the Buddhist Temple. Please let me go home. Please leave me alone. Master... You're so stubborn. Where's Fashan? Here, master. Master. Bring him back. I don't want to go. I don't want to be a monk. My dear wife, help me! Help me! Did you hear, sister? Qingqing, he kidnapped my husband. Hateful monk Fahai! We haven't done anything wrong to deserve this. Qingqing, we must hurry to the Golden Mountain Temple. Be careful, Qingqing. Monk Fahai is very powerful. I know. "Golden Mountain Temple" Master, please let my husband go. You're a snake spirit yet It's an offence on your part coming to mortal world. You better turn around while you can, ...or you will be punished. Xu Xian was once my savior, I made it up to him by marrying. Please be kind, and let my husband go. How dare you talk about your personal life? This is a Buddhist temple. If I hand Xu Xian over, you will turn him into a monster too. We haven't harmed anyone, what's wrong with me looking for my husband here? And tell me what's your grudge, why are you separating me from my husband? You're a high rank Buddhist monk, you should be kind to all living creatures. Please don't go over the top, you should be more forgiving. I won't be duped by you, there's no use for the pretty speech. Unless you move Yangtze River up here on the mountain, ...you won't see your husband. He is unreasonable, mean and arrogant. Fine, let's do what he wants. We'll move Yangtze River here. Then he'll let Xu Xian go. Amitabha Buddha. Let me go! Sister. Are you alright? It hurts. I think it's time to give birth. What should we do? We're so close to winning. Qingqing, I can't hold up anymore. Sister. We can't stop now, or the water will flow back down, ...and we'll drown. The water! Let's go! Come on. Hurry. Sister. My dear. Xu Xian. And you are? Venerable old man. Please help me. Save my wife. Bai Suzhen has failed in her attempt. Where's my wife? She's hidden in the woods. I'll show you the way. I'll let you two see each other. Thank you, master. Close your eyes. Yes. Qingqing. Sister. My dear... Listen, Qingqing. My dear. My husband is here. Dear wife... My dear. My beloved! Dear wife... My dear husband. Dear wife... My dear husband... Dear wife... My beloved! Dear wife... you... How did you escape? The venerable old man saved me. Sweetheart. Thank you, venerable old man. Hurry, sister. You better hurry. Are you alright? It's all because of you. Qingqing. I cannot believe you. My sister has suffered all because of you. Think it over, Xu Xian. We've risked everything for you. Sister. Dear wife... Move away. Sister... Qingqing... Sister... Dear wife... Don't come any closer. A bit further. A little bit more. Turn your head. Qingqing. Sister... Qingqing. Sister. Dear... My dear wife... Dear. Sister, you have a bonny boy! My dear, you've borne enough hardships... I want to look at my son. Fahai is here, take the baby. Honey Hurry and leave. We'll go through this together, Let's go! You better leave, dear. No. I don't think I can go anywhere. No. Qingqing, you... Take him to Hangzhou, ask my aunt to take care of him. And I'll have an heir, also someone to revenge for me. Listen to me, go now! Or you won't be able to make it. Sister. Leave, Qingqing. Qingqing. For your own personal grudge you stirred up trouble. By drowning Golden Mountain you tried to harm others. You've done the worst crime, what do you have to say now? Why did I do that for? Who's really behind this? I've done serious damage, but you should share the punishment with me. You're a real snake spirit. Still trying to bite at your time of death. I'm generous enough to let you live, so you can live the rest of life in an earthen bowl. She's just given birth. Have mercy on her. Let her go! We'll forever be grateful. She's nothing but a pest. Why won't you give up? You refuse to come to your senses, ...do you really wish to die? You have no conscience. You're the pest. I'm not scared of death. I'll fight you. Dear... Dear... Snake Spirit, you aren't going anywhere. Amitabha Buddha. My dear... My dear... Dear wife... My dear... Leaping out from a foggy cloud of miserable gloom... They soared into a sunny day with gentle breeze. In a different world of emotions. We'll never be apart. Never again shall we be apart.

What kind of homework are they handing out? It's his Space Cub test. I told Elroy you could help him. -I'm at the end of my rope. -Very funny. But I can't help him. -I was a Scout-- -I know, Pop. A long time ago. No, it's not that, Elroy. A good Scout is self-sufficient. What does your scoutmaster say about outside help? In the Space Cubs, it isn't a scoutmaster, Pop. It's a Big Buddy. See, Mr. Bunsen was our last Big Buddy, but he retired suddenly. -Why was that? -The men who took Mr. Bunsen away said he was having a nervous breakup. -Oh, George. Isn't that a shame? -Now, now, now. Forget it, Jane. I am not about to be a Big Buddy to a mob of strange kids. -But, George, they're EIroy's friends. -Jane, honey. In five minutes, I have an appointment with Mr. Spacely to ask about getting a two-week vacation. And if I get it, I don't want to be tied down with extra kids. AII right, George. If that's the kind of father you want to be to your son don't be surprised if he becomes D-E-L-I-N-Q-U-E-N-T. Yeah, delinquent. You want me to Iearn about tying knots from kids in the street? -Now, EIroy, that is not what I said. -If I were you, George I'd ask Mr. Spacely for a three-week vacation. You need it. AII right, Jetson, don't blow your stack. You gotta be calm when you talk to the boss about that vacation. Facts and figures, that's what Mr. SpaceIy understands. I'II prove statistically how overworked I am. And his own computer will supply the figures to prove it. -Ready, R.U.D.I.? -R.U.D.I. 's ready. AII right. What are my chances of getting a two-week vacation this year? "Your weight is 1 68 pounds." I don't get it. What's my weight got to do with a vacation? Fat chance. What do you know, you big junk pile? Jetson! What are you doing to my delicate $500,000 referential universal digital Indexer? Good SpaceIy, Mr. Afternoon. I mean, good afternoon, Mr. SpaceIy. -I didn't hear you sneak in, sir. -What are you doing to R.U.D.I.? I was adjusting it, sir. I think it has a screw loose somewhere. well, takes one to know one, Jetson. Is this why I pay you? -To kick my brain around behind my back? -Oh, no, sir, I onIy-- I have had my eye on you for some time now, Jetson. -I think you need a vacation. -Oh, no, sir-- Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir! How would you Iike to take a little trip? Get away from it all, say, this weekend? Oh, gosh, Mr. SpaceIy. Are you sure you can spare me? -Positive. I'II pay all expenses. -Oh, that's great. could I take the family? well, the place I have in mind is a little primitive for family living. But I'm sure your son would enjoy roughing it. -After all, he's a Space Cub. -Yeah, but how did you know that? Oh, I forgot. Your son's a Space Cub too. In the same troop. Right. Troop 54. That's why I want you to take this weekend vacation trip. -You mean, me and my little boy? -You and your little boy and my little boy, and the rest of Troop 54. -Oh, but, sir, I'm really not up to it. -Jetson, after seeing the kind of work you're up to indoors, I figure you must be an outdoor man. The type who should take the boys on an overnight camping trip this weekend. -But Mr. SpaceIy, sir, I'm not prepared. -A Space Cub is always prepared, Jetson. I no more considered taking an overnight hike than I thought of going to the moon. Funny you should mention the moon, Big Buddy because that's exactly where you're taking Troop 54. To the moon! Grand central Spacion. I haven't been here in years. Why do hikes always have to start so early in the morning? And where are the other Cubs? The troop's supposed to form at 6 sharp. Oh, they'II be here, Pop. See? Here they come. Troop 54 wouldn't let us down. Over here, men. Over here. -We are strong, we are brave -In 1 0 years, we'll even shave We're the Space Cubs of Troop 54 -Through the storm and the sleet -Dragging grandmas through the street We're the Space Cubs of Troop 54 If your bones get bent In an accident -We know the proper knot to tie -Get a stretcher! -We can cook, we can bake -But we get a bellyache -We're the Space Cubs of Troop 54 -Let's hear it, men! We're the Space Cubs of Troop 54 -That was fine, boys. -Once again, men! -Now, hold it, hold it! -Aren't they great, Dad? well, EIroy. How do you turn them off? You gotta give the proper command, Pop. Space Cubs, atten-hut! Thanks, EIroy. Space Cubs, atten-hut! -But we get a bellyache -We're the Space Cubs of Troop 54 Overnight hike! Make little Orbit take his vitamins no matter how much he fights. And be sure Werner wears his fiIter-top. He's allergic to moon dust. I promised little Anode he could sit by a window. He gets spacesick. And keep a close watch on Arthur. He's always getting lost. Mothers, atten-hut! About face! On the double! Get lost! Shuttle to moon now loading. Passengers, please go aboard. well, Iet's go, men. -Hey, Pop, how far is it to the moon? -There's a sign showing the distance, EIroy. Oh, yeah. "Moon: 238,000 miles." -Gosh, Pop. That's not very far. -That's right. We'II be there in no time. AII right, men. Fasten your couch belts. We'II be taking off in a minute. -Hello there. -Who's that? This is your stewardess, Lana Luna welcoming you to Galaxy Space Lines flight 22. We're going to the moon together. Won't that be funsies? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -We'll be flying at Mach 34. Thirty-four times the speed of sound. If you have any questions, ask them now. But you won't hear the answers until we get back again. -Oh, boy, I'II have to meet her. -If weightlessness makes you nervous just ask for our special lead pills. They hold you in your seat. Now, settle back, relax, cross your fingers. And when we're safely out of the Earth's atmosphere you are welcome to come to the lounge and rub elbows with the crew. Crazy, crazy. I'm looking forward to it. This is your stewardess, lovely Lana Luna, bidding you: aloha, auf Wiedersehen, arrivederci, and hasta Ia vista. -This has been a transcribed announcement. -Oh, boy. WouIdn't you know it? Moon Shuttle now launching from Pad 1 2. All systems go. Stand clear. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, and so forth. Take a deep breath, men. We'II soon hit maximum G's. See? Isn't this great, boys? Okay, Cubs. Prepare for weightlessness. -Hey, Pop, look at the Earth! -It's very nice, EIroy. -But you shouldn't leave your seat. -Look at all those signs, Pop! "Danger," "Meteor Crossing," "Caution," "Bumpy clouds Ahead." -Yeah. Here come some more. -"Stay In Your Orbit," "school Crossing" "slow To 30,000 miles." Hey, look at that, Pop! Yeah. "Spaceway's Cafe. Free parking." Must be a good place to eat. AII the space truck drivers stop there. Attention, passengers. This is your stewardess, Lana Luna. We will be landing on the moon shortly. The daytime temperature is 240 degrees. However, at night it cools off to 2 1 5 degrees. Below zero, that is. Galaxy Space Lines hopes you had an enjoyable trip and looks forward to serving you again. -This has been a transcribed announcement. -I know. I know. There's the moon! Fasten your couch belts. We are about to land. Hang on, men. These moon landings can be pretty rough. Hey, that was a pretty smooth touchdown. Okay, Cubs, this is it. Put on your oxygen helmets and stay inside until I Iook around. It's pretty wild out there. "Moon Port." "Moonhattan TiIton hotel." "HaIf-acre moon craters out of the smog zone." Hey, gosh. Hey, look at that. "Short of breath? Try Orbit Oxygen." -Taxi? Taxi, mister? -Downtown Moonhattan, mister? No, thanks. We're looking for the campground, Lunar Park. Oh, sure. Over that way, about 1 0 miles. The other side of Copernicus Crater. -Yeah, pile in. I'II take you there. -We're Space Cubs. We'II hike it. elroy, are you getting too much oxygen? -He said 1 0 miles, and we've got our packs. -So we'II just take big steps. Watch. Geronimo! Gravity on the moon is only one-sixth that of Earth. -Come on, Pop. -AII right, all right. We'II walk. To keep from getting lost, use the buddy system. Everyone pick a buddy and stay with him. Anode, you go with EIroy. Orbit, you go with Werner, And Arthur.... -Who's that leave for your buddy, Arthur? -You, I guess. That's right, Arthur. I promised your dad Mr. SpaceIy, that is, that I'd look after you personally. Big deal. Come on, Iet's go. Up-two-three-four, two-three-four. Up-two-three-four, two-three-four. Up-two-three-four, two-three-four.... well, our camp is in pretty good shape, men. -What should we name it? -How about calling it "Camp EIroy"? Camp EIroy, no, no. What do you think we should call it, Anode? I think we should call it Camp-- -That's Indian. -What's it mean? Beats me. I can't talk Indian. well, Anode, that name is a little bit long. Arthur, what would you Iike to call it? I'd Iike to call it quits. How do I get my walking papers out of this chicken feed outfit, anyway? Did you hear that? Arthur suggests we go on a hike and do some bird-watching. AII right. fall in, men. And a hup-two-three-four. Hup-two-three-four. Hup-two-three-four. Hey, here comes another group of campers, men. Hey, what troop is that, Pop? It says "Troop ZIgph, Martian and Chowder club." -Boy, did you get a look at those guys? -Yeah, talk about freaks. How would you Iike to go through life with only one head? Not me, boy! Don't get too close to the edge of this crater. Look out, Orbit. That rock you're standing on is loose, Orbit. Orbit! Oh, no. -Now, why didn't Orbit pay attention? -Because that was Anode. Sorry, Anode! He's not hurt. Here he comes. He's bouncing back up. -well, here we are, men. -Yeah, Big Buddy, but where are we? well, according to the map, we're right about here. -On the rim of that crater. -That's not a crater, Mr. Jetson! -That's your thumbprint! -well, it's no problem, men. We all know the direction back to camp, don't we? -Yes, Big Buddy! -Good. Then let's go. Someone had their directions mixed up. Okay, now let's go in the right direction. It looks like you men are lost, but don't panic. I'II check with the Space you don't want children. This isn't Walter's boy. He doesn't look anything like Walter. But he looks just like his beautiful daddy. See? Would you like to hold him? Please... Hold him... please. And that, my handsome friend, is how young Ernst Haeckel finally found the love he sought. That's the most horrible tale ever told! Is it? That the woman would have carnal knowledge with the dead. Your story is impossible. It is an affront to God! So say you... Mr. Ralston... May I assume that you could not be happy to have your wife returned under such circumstances. That you, do not love your wife that much? My wife is a spirit. - Not the body that holds it. - Just so, kind sir, just so! I can return the body, but... I hold no guarantee for the spirit! *** There is no God in this simple home, sir. No God at all... What is that sound? What is that horrible sound? How do you know horrible sound? How did you come to know this terrible tale? Sweet darling! We were just talking about you. Montesquino taught me so much... I should always be deeply in his debt... Give me, little darling. Come to mommy, sweetest. Time for supper! Oh darling! Gentlemen ! We have a very handsome guest, who claims to love his wife as much as we love one another. Mr. Ralston. You boys can just wait? Until the baby's fed. Then we can all... play. Together! - - Where does it come from? This quest, this need to solve life's mysteries, when the simplest of questions can never be answered? Why are we here? What is the soul? Whydowe dream? Perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all. Not delving, not yearning. That's not human nature. Not the human heart. That is not why we are here. How's he doing? I'm sorry. Did I scare you? No. No, I just... I keephavingtheseamazing dreams every time I close my eyes, and... Nevermind. He likes me to read him the stock page. Has he been conscious at all? No. Been a week now. I think he's close. A couple more days, maybe. Excuse me. You know, I don't know what he'd do without you. You got a real gift. Just doing my job. No, you're like a son to him. Now, that'd make us like brother and sister. Might be... Mightbe alittleawkward if I ever wanted to ask you out. I'm sorry, that was. .. That was inappropriate. No, it's sweet, it's. .. I'm dating somebody. Yeah. No, really, it's okay. I need to change his iv. I'm sorry, of course. Man is a narcissistic species by nature. We have colonized the four corners of our tiny planet. But we are not the pinnacle of so-caIIed evolution. That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach. capable of living for months without food. Remaining alive headless for weeks at a time. Resistant to radiation. If God has indeed created himself in his own image, then I submit to you that God is a cockroach. They say that man uses only a tenth of his brainpower. Another percent and we might actually be worthy of God's image. unless, of course, that day has already arrived. The Human Genome Project has discovered that tiny variations in man's genetic code are taking place at increasingly rapid rates. TeIeportation, Ievitation, tissue regeneration. is this outside the realm of possibility? Or is man entering a new gateway to evolution? is he finally standing at the threshold to true human potential? I'm sorry, I'm out of time. I know, I know. I'm beginning to sound like my father. I can't help it. You know, they can fire me, too, if they like, but there is something to it, Nirad, as crazy as it sounds. What is it? It's your father. He's dead. How? Driving a taxi in New York City is a very dangerous job. The wrong fare, the wrong time. We may never know what really happened. No, I spoke to him two days ago. He was convinced someone was following him, trying to steal his research. He died because of his theories! That's crazy! is it? The man left his family, discredited his career, to chase wild theories halfway around the world! Where are you going? To his apartment, to get his papers, his research! He was this close to finding the first of them. His Patient Zero, he tracked him to Queens, New York. Mohinder, listen to me. Your father was my colleague and my friend. A respected professor, a brilliant geneticist. But he had clearly lost touch with reality! I've followed in his footsteps. My thesis is based on his research! Yes, you always wanted his approval! And now you're telling me that it was all for nothing. I'm telling you to let go. I need to know why he died. I need to know that it wasn't all for nothing. And then I need to finish what he started. hello? Yeah, yeah, I'm at his place now. No, no, no, he left everything behind but his computer. Research, the map. Yeah, Iet's get a team in here to bag and tag everything. I gotta call you right back. Pervert. Time to get up, Micah! Micah! Micah ! Micah! What? Damn it, Micah, don't do that to me. Do what? Just you need to be careful. AII right? I'm just working on my computer. The logic board was bad, so I had to build a new one. A new one. Did anyone ever tell you you're the smartest little man on the planet? You do. AII the time. What's this? It's a pinhole camera. It's for the eclipse. The moon's gonna cover up the sun today. We're supposed to look at it at school. Speaking of which, you need to go get ready. Can't be late, not today. Mom, I'm already dressed and I've packed my own lunch. That's what I've been doing this morning. What about you? Don't get smart with me. AII right, I've been working to pay our bills. Yeah, that's why they turned off our gas again? Go grab your stuff and wait by the back door, okay? Why? Just do it. Mom, what's going on? Never mind, just keep your voice down and stay close to me. Camera ready? Yeah, almost! hold on! This looks like 70, 80 feet. This is so unreal. Okay, I'm good! Okay. Oh my. .. Oh, my God. Oh, my God ! claire? Oh, my God. claire! This is claire Bennet and that was attempt number six. You get out here, yes? Mr. Linderman, I'm gonna have to call you back in five minutes, okay? Thank you. I'm Iate. I've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting. What is it? It happened two more times. Sometimes I'm falling, sometimes I'm flying. Sometimes you're in 'em. I don't have time for this now. They're not just dreams, Nathan! hold this. I thought they'd go away, but they're not! Jim, I need this back by 6:00, please. Thanks. This morning when I got out of bed, my foot hovered before it hit the ground. Hovered! For a split second, Iike I was floating. I'm telling you, I think I can fly! These all undecideds? Mmm-hmm. tell you what, you think you can fly? Why don't you jump off the brooklyn Bridge? See what happens. Maybe I ought to start with something a little lower first. Just like learning to walk. You're serious. Oh, I'm serious. You need to snap out of it, Peter. Go see a doctor, get some drugs. But do not pull a Roger clinton on me, man, I'm eight points down in the polls! Look, this isn't about you, all right? Look, something is happening to me, and I have this feeling that you're the only person that's gonna understand this! Why the hell would I understand that you think you can fly? Because you're my brother! Mom, I can't talk. .. What? I'II be there in 1 0 minutes. What'd she do now? She got arrested. Arrested for what? shoplifting. I'm so depressed. What? What are you talking about? Why? I mean, I mean, besides the fact that it was so gross that I almost fudged myself, this is the single coolest thing to happen to this town in, Iike, 1 00 years. Not if nobody finds out, it's not. Why'd you want me to tape it? I have my reasons. It's not Iike you're not gonna be popular anymore. popular? Who said anything about being popular? My life as I know it is over, okay? I've got the Bishop game next week, SAT's in October, Homecoming's three weeks from today, and I'm a freak show! You're being a little dramatic, don't you think? No, I don't think! I have busted, Iike, every bone in my body, stabbed myself in the chest, I've shoved a two-foot steel rod through my neck, and I don't have a scratch on me! What do you call that thing sticking out? Oh, great. Just give me the tape, okay? Sure. Hey, I can give you a ride on my handlebars if you want. Look, thanks, okay? I'II talk to you in front of people at school tomorrow. Promise. Your son is a very intelligent boy. Gifted, actually. That's not the issue. His father's not around, and sometimes I think he could use a bit of a stronger hand, you know? I work nights a Iot, but we can both work harder. It's not about the work. The truth is, I just don't know if this school is the right fit for him. But he's made friends. I'm sorry. He's on the soccer team. I'm sorry. I wrote a check for $25,000 to get him into this snob fest. I was told that that's what it took. That's on top of the tuition. About the tuition. Your last three checks have bounced. Fine, take it out of the 25 grand that I gave you. That was a donation. And it was very appreciated. well, I want my money back. I want my money back, now. That money went to the capital campaign for the new wing. It's already been spent. Then unspend it! I'm sorry. We could maybe discuss an extension of the money that you owe, but. .. I want my money back. That's not possible. Come on, baby, Iet's get out of here. You're too good for this lousy school. Mom? Leave me alone! For God's sake, Ma. Are you okay? They dropped the charges. I have to fill out a form. No big deal. No big deal? I'm running for Congress. Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to me if it gets out, with our family's past? What could you possibly need so bad that you had to steal it? Never mind, I don't wanna know. Socks. Socks? Dad left you a fortune. What are you thinking? You know, it's been one ridiculous stunt after another with you for the Iast six months! Dad's gone, just get over it! You know what? Leave her alone! She's okay, that's all that matters. I gotta keep this out of the press. You know what? Just get out of here. Go worry about your image, I'II handle this. Yeah. Good. I gotta make sure this stays buried. Thanks a Iot, Mom. Mmm-hmm. What were you thinking? I just wanted to feel alive again. Nathan only cares about himself. Your father was the same way. alpha dogs, both of them. You, in the meantime, for all your selflessness, and sitting with dying people. .. What? You're gonna retire on what you make? Maybe I'II shopIift my socks. Don't get smart. When you put everyone else first, you end up last. You always put Nathan first, he took advantage. Yeah, it wasn't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me? He takes up more space than you. Demanded more attention. And besides, it's not my fault, you allowed it. He's my brother. I Iove him. Ah, love is overrated. He loves me, too. I know him. We've always been close. Rose-coIored glasses. That's cruel, Mom! Look, since Dad died, I know you've been feeling free to speak your mind, but it wouldn't hurt to edit yourself every once in a while. I'm sorry if the truth hurts. I'm just saying you hero-worshipped him. And those feelings were never returned. You're wrong! It's biological, and I can't help it, we're connected. I never told you this, but when Nathan had his accident, I knew it. We all got the same call. No, I'm saying before the call, like he was telling me, 300 miles away. I woke up, and I knew that he'd been hurt. I hate it here. She doesn't even have any books to read. Baby, I'II be right back, I'm just gonna go and pack up a few things. We should really go see Dad. What good would that do? He could help. He should know that someone's trying to hurt us. Your dad's not in any position to help us right now. Look, I made some mistakes, I admit it. Mom, what'd you do? Hey. I need you to know that I would never let anything happen to you. Promise. Mom, why'd you look at yourself like that in the fish tank? How long? Just a couple hours, tops. There's some ice cream in the fridge. Go ahead. What happened? I went to see Linderman. How much? Thirty. You gambling again? No, it's just bills. And I used the rest to get Micah into private school. They didn't know what to do with him at public, and I just. .. I needed them to think that we had money. From the mob? hell, Niki. You weren't born yesterday! I'm just two weeks overdue! I mean, I thought that I couId handle it, okay? I'm under a Iot of stress right now, okay? Gee, I wonder why? I feel like I'm kind of losing it a little bit. I'm seeing things. Like? Like I keep feeling like someone's watching me. Yeah, Linderman wants his money back, so he sends some mouth-breather that's gonna put you in the hospital. No, it is someone else. It's someone that I can't see. Does this make any sense to you? No. I'm sorry, you know what? But I'II tell you what does. .. I shouldn't be telling you this. No, no, Iet me tell you what does make sense. You need to come up with that 30 grand plus interest, now. Or you gotta run. Watch him. AII right. cool, huh? How hot do you think it is in there? Turn on the camera. Scotty! Scotty! Come on! Take it easy, you're all right! I'm okay, I'm fine! Take it easy. There's no burns! Get going! One, two, three, four, five, go! One, two, three. .. Yeah, I was real sorry to hear about your father. He seemed like a good guy. Man, I thought I was a slob. They were here, too. What? Nothing. I got a guy who can clean this up for 1 00 bucks. No. lt's all right. I'II take it as it is. We rent by the week. I'm gonna need to know you can afford it. I have a job. Doing what? Driving a taxi. I'II get you an application. - - ln these uncertain times... We need a leader who... Nathan Petrelli. He served his country in Bosnia. Hey! Oh, God. What? The silent treatment? Oh, boy. Isaac? What are you doing? What the hell is wrong with you? Isaac! Okay, stop! What... What, are you crazy? CIearIy. I don't even remember painting these. I was high, okay? I lied to you. Damn it. I've been chasing for a month. well, then, get yourself back into a program and make it stick this time. These are fantastic! No! They're evil. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? You know what I'm talking about? You see this? Suicide bombing in Israel. I painted it three weeks ago. Yeah, so? So? That's this morning's paper. Look at the number on the bus. This happened yesterday. Yesterday. Something's wrong with me. We'II get you help, Isaac. I tried that, twice. There's only one way left. And you know it. You can't go cold turkey, not alone! I mean, Iet me help you, please! No! I Iove you! I'II drag you down with me, I swear to God, I will. Just leave me alone. Get out of here! Now! An unidentified Good Samaritan who witnesses describe as a young teenage girl ran into the flames and rescued the young lieutenant. Now the train is registered to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and there has been no official statement yet as to what was in the car. But judging by the amount of security around here... lt wasn't easy, Nathan, but consider it gone. I know I owe you big on this one, Tom. I'm not gonna forget it. Yeah, I won't let you forget it. Thanks. Sure thing. Mom's rap sheet is now officially buried. It only took half my political capital to pull it off. Why can't she get herself a hobby like a normal person? They were married 41 years. It's a plea for attention. She's lonely. Give her some time, will you? I don't have time. I got eight days to make up ten points. I need all the help I can get, which is what I wanna talk to you about. I wanna offer you a job. A job? Yeah. I trust you. You're good with people. I need a coordinator to help organize the volunteers, and you got nice guy instincts, I couId use that. I'm a shark, Pete, everybody knows it. And it's starting to show up in the polls. I bring you on, and it kind of reflects well on me, you know what I mean? Yeah, all right, so I make you look good. That's a new one. It makes me look like I put family first. I mean, I know that sounds seIf-serving, but this is for you, too, right? You've got to think of your future. How do you do that? Do what? Even try to make it look like it has something to do with me? You didn't hear anything that I said earlier today, did you? About how you can fly? Yeah, I did. I'm gonna pretend for both our sakes you didn't say anything like that. I'm trying to do the right thing here. Look, I already have a job. Yeah, watching old people die, now there's a career. It's not cute anymore, man. The dreamy kid, sitting in the back of the classroom, staring out the window? It's time for you to grow up. Look, I cast a big shadow, Pete, I get it. Life isn't fair. But there's nothing I can do about that. I'm trying to do the right thing by you here, okay? I don't want your pity. Hey. Corner of Center and canal, please. Wow. solar eclipse. Yeah, yeah, I wonder if it's gonna be total. Not here, no. Some other part of the world, yes. A global event. Makes one appreciate just how small our planet really is. And we're all quite small really, aren't we? What's your name? Mohinder. I'm Peter. Let me ask you something, Mohinder. Do you ever get the feeling like you were meant to do something extraordinary? I'm driving a cab, you may have noticed. No, I'm not talking about what you do, I'm talking about who you are. I'm talking about being special. Yes, we are all special. That's not what I meant. Some individuals, it is true, are more special. This is natural selection. It begins as a single individual born or hatched like every other member of their species, anonymous, seemingly ordinary, except they're not. They carry inside them the genetic code that will take their species to the next evolutionary rung. It's destiny. Hey! Hey, I can't believe you just left like that! Yeah, I know, I was there. You saved that dude's life, he was okay! welcome home. Get over there. Fifty grand is a Iot of money. Fifty? It was 30. Even with interest. .. Mr. Linderman wants to be nice about this. You should have read the fine print. Look, I have a son. I'm all he's got. Mmm. please, I can get you the money. I'II tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make you a little business proposition. You make, what, 40 bucks for every 20 minutes you take off your clothes? well, I'm gonna give you a chance to lower your debt a little. And see where it goes from there. Come on. Come on, show me what you got. Lift up your shirt, baby. Oh, look at that belly. smile for me. That what you want? Ah, yes. What's the matter, baby? You just started getting good here. What's the problem, baby? I said, what's the matter? Screw you. Screw me? - Hi, this is Niki. - Leave me a message. Mom, are you there? When are you coming to get me? I hate it here. You said you'd be back soon. Just come pick me up, okay? - hello? - Peter, it's me. Hey! Simone? Are you busy? No, I was just heading home. Listen, I need you to meet me at my dad's. Yeah, no, I can be there in 1 0 minutes. Just hurry, okay? Yeah,okay,okay,I'IIseeyouthere. Bye. You know, I'II hop out here, please. Thanks. Where to, my friend? JFK, please. I'm going home to my family. These business trips are wearing me out. Suresh, huh? I'm sorry? Your name. On your license, there. That's Indian, yes? There was a Professor Suresh at the University of Madras, a geneticist. Interesting theories. Don't think he's teaching anymore. But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? probably lots of Sureshes where you're from. Like Smith or Anderson. And then carla had the nerve to tell me he's not breed-worthy. Like he didn't win five aII-breed rallies, two regionals. Can you believe it? It's just not true, Mr. MuggIes. It's not true. He's a little stud muffin, that's what he is. He still humps my leg when I watch TV. AII right, enough about Mr. MuggIes. What'd everybody else do today? Doug and I saw this Mexican guy. A homeless dude, on our way to school. We thought he was dead, but he wasn't. I thought Dad was coming home today. well, ah, I was gonna surprise you. He finished up early, he's coming home tonight. Isn't that great? Just in time to read my report card. So what about you, claire, do anything special today? I walked through fire and I didn't get burned. What the hell is that supposed to mean? God, you're so crazy sometimes. LyIe. I think I know exactly what you mean. Oh, here I am, talking dogs again. And you go and say something really profound. We come up against all kinds of fires in our lives, and when we test ourselves and face our fears, we usually don't get burned. You are very wise, sweetheart. Whatever it is you did, I'm proud of you. And so is Mr. MuggIes! He's just so proud of claire! Aren't we? We're proud of claire. Yes, we're so proud of claire, aren't we? She's the best. Hiro. What are you looking for? Morphine. What for? I need you to come with me someplace. Where? You'II see. Look, there's. .. There's something I need to tell you. Now that is gonna have to wait. No, look, I need to tell you about this, okay? I've gotta stop living for other people. My whole life I've had no idea what I'm supposed to do, what I'm supposed to be, if I even have a destiny of my own! I promise you we will talk about this later, okay? But right now I really need you to come with me. You're a nurse, you can give out a shot, you can help him. help who? I thought we could go to the movies this Saturday, maybe try on some shoes at the new mail in gardendale. Sure. I Iove you, Mom. But? No buts. I just wanted to tell you that. I know you think I'm trying to be your best friend again, admit it. No. It's all right, we can go to the movies together. lt's no big deal. I just miss you, that's all. I wanna be your mom, I wanna give you advice. But I don't wanna push you away. I want advice, I do. I won't push you away, I promise. I just don't think you should be so worried about fitting in all the time. About being so popular. I don't want to see you make mistakes like I did. I wanted to be someone more interesting than I am. You are interesting. You breed show dogs. Whose mom does that? No, I wanted to hitchhike across Europe. Study art. fall in love with some poetry-quoting Frenchman. Not that your dad isn't wonderful, but my point is, you should know who you are and know that it's enough. 'Cause who you are is special. About that. There's something I need to say. Something I never talked about 'cause I thought it wouId upset you and Dad. Sweetheart, you can say anything to us, you know that. I think I'm old enough for you to tell me who my real parents are. Of course you are. Honey! I'm home! Your father. Hey, honey! Bad, Mr. MuggIes! No! I'm glad you're home. Oh, me, too. I have such a headache. I slammed my head getting out of a taxicab. Hi, Daddy! Hey, baby! hello, New York! I'm just saying it's impossible. Nobody can predict the future. I saw it with my own eyes, Peter. Isaac! I brought someone here to help. He's a nurse. Isaac. Isaac? Isaac! Simone! Oh, God! Okay. Oh, my God. Isaac? He's alive. call 91 1. What have you done? God, he's overdosed. Yeah, I'm at 21 5 Reed Street, number seven. I need an ambulance here immediately. He's OD'd. No, no, he's conscious. Just barely. I know. Listen, could you just come? Get here soon, please. Okay, baby, it's okay, they're sending an ambulance right now, okay? You just hang in there, okay? You're gonna be okay, I swear. We have to stop it. - Oh, baby. - We have to stop it. This quest, this need to solve life's mysteries. In the end, what does it matter when the human heart can only find meaning in the smallest of moments? They're here among us. In the shadows, in the light. Everywhere. Do they even know yet? AII right, I'm here. Now what do you want? Peter? I've been up here all night thinking about this. Thinking about my destiny. What are you doing, Pete? It's my turn to be somebody now, Nathan! Come on, Peter, quit screwing around! Peter! You're flying, Nathan. You're flying. How did you. .. I don't know. No! No! OENOMAUS: No one even knows where he came from. Some say he was from Thrace in Greece. But he never said. All I know for sure is he had once been in the army. And then he and his wife were seized and taken to the slave market in Rome. And that's where the story of Spartacus really began. SLAVE TRADER: A woman and a child. We'll start at 3,000 sesterces. What am I bid? 3,000 sesterces. BIDDER: Four! SLAVE TRADER: Four. 4,000 sesterces. Yes, come on. For the family. Good workers. Good breeders. Who will give me 5,000 sesterces? You've a good eye, Batiatus. He's special, this one. Where did you serve? Not a soldier. So you're not a soldier? - I'll take him. 2,000 sesterces. - 3,000. With the female. BATIATUS: What do I want with a woman? This one I'll make a gladiator. Two. Two and a half. Hold on. All right, all right. Two. Get him. No, no! WOMAN: No! WOMAN: No! No! No. No! No, Spartacus! No! OENOMAUS: Spartacus would become known as the man who fought back. He was a hero. No, Spartacus! He was my friend. No! But most of all, he was a slave who took on the might of Rome to be free. - Pleased to meet you. - Welcome to hell. Come on! OENOMAUS: He didn't look like much when I first saw him. We'd been there for years, me and my mate Crixus, ever since they'd snatched us in Gaul. One of the perks of being a veteran gladiator was beating up the new arrivals. And I fancied my chances with him. Huh? You call this fighting, huh? Good. Good. I'll kill you! You'll be pissing blood for a week. Guards! SPARTACUS: One, two, three! Get them to the cells! Come on! Put your backs into it! CRIXUS: No use. I said... You should listen to him. You know how long he's been here? He's crazy. Whoever she is, forget her. Best to forget everything in here. Believe me. - You'll learn. - No, he won't. You won't forget your hate. OENOMAUS: A few months later, Spartacus had become one of us. We were ordered to fight in the arena in Capua. It was a routine job. A politician who wanted to suck up to the voters would put on a show. And we were the entertainment. So what have you got for me this afternoon? A marvellous spectacle, I assure you, Senator. - Worth every penny. - Well, I should hope so. It cost me enough. OENOMAUS: Our paymaster that day was Marcus Licinius Crassus, a man with a fortune in slaves and property who was aiming for high office. - A good turnout, don't you think? - Mmm. A full house, sir. More people, more votes, Batiatus. What a pleasant surprise, Senator Lentulus. More than we deserved, I'm sure. Or at least expected. The people appreciate seeing the future consul, I always think. Of course. We are deeply honoured. That's very gracious of you, Marcus Crassus. What the hell is he doing here? He'd turn up at the opening of a shithouse if he thought there was a vote in it. OENOMAUS: When you went into the arena, you didn't expect to die. The deal was simple. Fight hard, put on a good show, keep the crowd happy, and they'd let you live. If you showed cowardice, then they'd turn nasty. Fight me. I'm trying to save your life. Fight me. MAN: Send him to the galleys! MAN: Fight him! Fight him! How disappointing. And after all the trouble you went to. You promised me a spectacle. This is pathetic. I assure you, sir. It will not happen again. CROWD: Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Please. You'll get used to it. OENOMAUS: But he never did get used to it. I wonder if it was then that he started thinking about escape. Roll. Tell everyone supper's ready. We're getting out of here. Not your lucky night. Spartacus! Welcome to hell. High ground. Move! OENOMAUS: And that was it. We were out. We had no plan. Just 70 of us on the run, hiding on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, 20 miles from Capua. Do it. OENOMAUS: Escaped slaves were like vermin. We had to be hunted down. So they sent 4,000 men. They outnumbered us fifty to one. OENOMAUS: We're trapped. No way out. SPARTACUS: There's always a way out. Look at them. They're not patrolling the perimeters, and the sentries are all facing this way. - That should tell you two things. - CRIXUS: What? One, they don't expect us to attack. - We're gonna attack? - You try and stop me. And two, they're raw conscripts, amateurs. Now, look again. - What are they doing? - Watching us. Exactly. - Just like the crowd in the arena. - So? So the crowd in the arena doesn't watch the exits, does it? No one's watching the rear. How thick are those vines? Evening, ladies. ALL: Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus. Psst! There's something you need to see. Who are they? They're slaves, mostly. What do they want? What do you think they want? They wanna join you. OENOMAUS: Over the months, more and more of them came. Soon there were thousands. Not just men. Women and children. Suddenly, we weren't just outlaws. We were a movement. That's when the trouble started. Hundreds of them. Where are they all coming from? They're flocking to the mighty Spartacus. Look, this one's brought his wife and his bloody mother. How old is he? How old are you? Not a fighting man among them. Useless. So what are you gonna do with all this lot, then? I don't know. Feed them. What do you think you're doing? What's it look like? You can't spare that. There isn't enough for the men. So what do we do? Let them starve? They're no use to us. That's your army, Spartacus. Feed it or someone else will. You want food? Go find it, then. OENOMAUS: We weren't the only ones who didn't have enough food. We slaves had built the Roman Republic. Slaves worked the fields. We brought in the harvest. We built their buildings and we cleaned their streets. Without us, Rome would be brought to its knees. You see this? It costs twice what it did last week. How am I supposed to feed my family? Answer me that. I understand, I really do. It's a disaster. What is Consul Lentulus doing about it? - What are you doing about it? - Leave it with me. What makes you think you can do better? Because I'm here and Lentulus isn't. Because I'm listening and Lentulus isn't. Look, if you need money to tide you over, come and see me, do you understand? I'll do everything in my power to help. OENOMAUS: Meanwhile, Crixus took Spartacus at his word and went looking for food. Prepare to die, Roman slaves! Empty the granaries! Take the cattle, the sheep, anything! Whatever you can find! No! No! No, please! Don't! Don't! Please stop! No! I should have killed you when I had the chance. You think you had a chance? You gutless piece of shit. You're no better than the Romans. I never said I was. Hey! Hey! Where are you taking him, Spartacus? Where are you taking us? Where are we going? OENOMAUS: In his own brutal way, Crixus had put his finger on it. And Spartacus knew it. We couldn't carry on living as a robber band, hidden in the hills. There were too many of us to hide. And too many of us couldn't fight. We needed a plan. A plan that could look after thousands of men, women and children. Crixus has a point. OENOMAUS: Mmm? We can't run forever. Face it. We can't run at all, not with this lot. - We can stand and fight. - And lose. No. We can't beat the whole Roman army. We keep moving. Where? Where are we going? As far as we have to. - That's it? - Have you got a better idea? It's not much of a life. But it is life. We'll go north, across the Alps. Tomorrow! Tomorrow, we march north to Gaul and out of Roman territory. We'll find ourselves a new home. Gaul? Have you ever been to Gaul, Spartacus? Have you seen the women? No. I didn't think so. You go to Gaul. I'm gonna stay here and fight. I saw my family burn, Spartacus. I saw my children burn. I want revenge! Who's coming with me? Who's coming with me? - Me! - Me! MAN: Me! Oenomaus? I'm sorry, Crixus. Why? Because I think you're wrong about the women. OENOMAUS: Spartacus' rebellion had become a political embarrassment. But for some, it was also an opportunity. My friends, my heart goes out to you. You decent, hard-working merchants are facing ruin. And what does Lentulus do? Well, either he's been sending incompetents to deal with the situation, or he's allowed the army to grow so soft, it can't defeat a bunch of slaves. He is weak. Weak. If you have a grievance, Marcus Crassus, air it in the Senate rather than the marketplace. With respect, Consul, it's in the marketplace that the people are suffering, not the Senate. I know exactly what you're up to. You don't give a damn about the slave revolt or the people. This is about power. All I'm doing is giving the people a voice. And it's you who have the power, not me, remember? - Even if you're not prepared to use it. - How dare you? As a matter of fact, I've decided to take control of the situation myself. OENOMAUS: Lentulus mobilised a massive army. The first slaves they ran into were Crixus' mob in the Garganus Mountains. We got there too late. - I'm sorry, Oenomaus. - Don't say another word. He was my friend. You know what? Perhaps he was right. He's dead. What, and this is living? Looking after a bunch of women and children? - At least he died like a man. - He died like a fool. We made a promise. Revenge, Spartacus. We lived for it. It was all we had. You want revenge, then live. They want you dead, so live and you win. There's no other way. Come with me to Gaul. What kind of a victory is that? It's the only one we can get. OENOMAUS: So Spartacus led 40,000 of us north, slowly getting nearer and nearer to the Alps and our new home in Gaul. All the time, the Romans were closing in. They're gaining on us all the time. We can't move any faster. There is nothing for it. We'll have to stand and fight. You said that we couldn't do that, said that was suicide. Two miles north of here there's a gorge. If we can lure them in there, their numbers will count against them. Packed together like rats in a trap. It's our best chance. Now! Go, go, go, go! We did it. We bloody did it! - We were lucky, that's all. - No. No, that wasn't luck. Huh? With you leading us, we can beat them all. They want you to lead us against Rome, to victory! - No, Oenomaus... - Victory! - Oenomaus, listen. Listen. Listen! - Victory! Victory! Another three days' march, maybe two, and we're there. Gaul. - We've done it, we're out. - No. Escaping, you'll just be an escaped slave. Huh? You'll still be a slave. Wherever you are. To be free, I mean really free, we have to kill our master. Now, Spartacus. Now for Rome. Huh? Rome. Huh? Rome! ALL: Rome! Rome! Rome! Rome! Rome! Consul Lentulus. I came as soon as I heard. What for, to gloat? To offer my sincere commiserations. I'd like to say it could've happened to the best of us, but it didn't. Oh, you're enjoying this, aren't you? No, Lentulus, I'm not enjoying this. Who could enjoy a disaster on this scale? I did my duty. Your duty? Thanks to you, a slave army is marching on Rome. It's time someone strong was put in charge. Someone who gets the job done. CRASSUS: So, you're the army that ran away from slaves. Soldiers? You're a laughing stock. No doubt you're saying I'm a businessman, not a soldier. What do I know about strategy and tactics? Well, I do know about leadership. I know about discipline. I know about efficiency. Every 10th man to step forward. Decimate them. OENOMAUS: You had to hand it to Crassus. In just a few months, he changed that army. When we arrived on the hills outside Rome, that was only too clear. This is a mistake. We could've been in Gaul by now. You think we can't win? You swore to lead us. What do you want me to say? I want you to lead us. They believe in you! I didn't ask for this! Go! Go on, get out! Go! Go on! You go with them. You still don't understand, do you? There's nowhere left for them to go. You said you'd lead us to a new home. You've done that. You're their home, Spartacus. We're staying with you. Forget Rome. Just tell us what to do, we'll do it. We can't go north, we head south. OENOMAUS: So, once again, Spartacus led us off, with no real idea of where we were going. All the while, Crassus followed us, tracking our every move. They're heading south. Good. Don't let them turn or rest. Herd them like cattle. We're gonna drive those bastards into the sea. OENOMAUS: And that's just what he did. He pursued us all the way from Rome to Rhegium at the toe of Italy. - What do we do now? - We grow wings. Gentlemen, we have them cornered. And now we're going to build a wall, 35 miles across, stretching from coast to coast and bordered by trenches. No one gets in or out. I'm sorry. What for? Everything. No one said I had to follow you. Anyway, there's always a way out. That wall, what does it look like to you? 'Cause to me it looks defensive. OENOMAUS: So? They're scared of us. They don't want to fight, not if they can help it. They'll starve us out. That'll take too long. We're an embarrassment to them, remember? They need a result and they need it fast. Perhaps they'll listen. What do you mean, a deal? What have we got to offer them? SOLDIER: Sir. Over there, sir. Look, over there, sir. Well, I'll be damned. So, you're the mighty Spartacus. I've come to offer you terms. You've come to offer me terms? Kill me. Spare my men. You really are stupid, aren't you? You've no idea. Do you think the life of one slave means anything to me, or to Rome? You will surrender to me, and I'll decide who lives and dies. All those who fought against us, I will execute. The others will return to work. These are my terms. Then it's over? Yes, it's over. - So, we fought for nothing, then? - No, Oenomaus. We fought for everything. But I haven't understood it until now. SPARTACUS: We have what we fought for. To be free means having the right to choose. Tomorrow, you can stand and fight with me, or you can accept Rome's terms and take your chances. It's up to you. I'm not going to give you orders. This is your choice. Who's with me? Once we lived for our masters. Tomorrow, we die for ourselves. That is freedom. Go! Go! On my command, we charge the centre of the line. ROMAN COMMANDER: Company, halt! Are you ready? Attack! Where's the body of Spartacus? I told you I wanted the body. I'm sorry, sir, we can't find it. Crucify them. Crucify them all. OENOMAUS: Six thousand of us were crucified as a warning to any slave who might dream of rising up against Rome. But the Romans never did find Spartacus' body. I like to think he's still out there. Of one thing I am sure, when the centuries pass, few will remember the name of Marcus Licinius Crassus, but Spartacus will live on forever, because he showed us something that we never knew before. That a slave didn't have to just take it. He could be free. Where does it come from? This quest, this need to solve life's mysteries when the simplest of questions can never be answered. Why are we are? What is the soul? Why do we dream? Perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all. Not dwelving, not yearning. That's not human nature. Not the human heart. That is not why we are here. How is he doing? I'm sorry, did I scare you? No. No, I just... I keep having these amazing dreams everytime I close my eyes and... Nevermind. He likes me reading the stock page. Is he even conscious at all? No. It's been a week now. I think he's close. A couple more days maybe. You know I don't know what he'd do without you. You have a real gift. Just doing my job. No. You're like a son to him. Yeah, well, that would make us like brother and sister, it'd be a little ankward if I ever wanted to ask out. I'm sorry. That was... That was inappropriate. No, it's sweet, it's... - I'm dating somebody and I... - Yeah. No, really, it's okay. I need to change his IV. I'm sorry. Man is a narcissistic species by nature. We have colonized the 4 corners of our tiny planet. But we are not the pinacle of so-called evolution. That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach. Capable of living for months without food. Remaining alive headless for weeks at a time. Resistant to radiation. If god has indeed created himself in his own image, then I submit to you that god is a cockroach. They say that man uses only a 10th of his brain power. Another percent and we might actually be worthy of God's image. Unless of course that day has already arrived, the human genome project has discovered that tiny variations in man's genetic code are taking place at increasingly rapid rates. Teleportation, levitation, tissue regeneration, is this outside the realm of possibility? Or is man entering a new gateway to evolution? Is he finally standing at the threshold of true human potential? I'm sorry. I'm out of time. I know, I know, I'm beginning to sound like my father. I can't help it. You know they can fire me too if they like. But there is something to it, Merad. As crazy as it sounds... - What is it? - It's your father. He's dead. How? Driving a taxi in New York City is a very dangerous job. The wrong fare, the wrong time, we may never know what really happened. You know I spoke to him 2 days ago. He was convincing someone was following him, trying to steal his research. He died because of his thesis. - That's crazy! - Is it? The man left his family, discredited his career to chase wild theories halfway around the world. Where are you going? To his apartment, to get his papers and research. He was this close to finding the first of them. His patient zero. He tracked him to Queens, New York. Mohinder, listen to me. Your father was my colleague and my friend. A respected professor, a brilliant geneticist but he had clearly lost touch with reality. I followed in his footsteps. My thesis is based on his research. Yes, you always wanted his approval. And now you're telling that it was all for nothing? I'm telling you... to let go. I need to know why he died. I need to know that it wasn't all for nothing. And then I need to finish what he started. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, I'm in his place now. No, no, no, he left everything behind but his computer. Research, the map. Yeah, let's get a team in here to bag and tag everything. I gotta call you right back. Pervert! Time to get up, Mika! Mika. Mika! Mika! - Mika! - What? Damn, Mika, don't do that to me. Do what? You need to be careful. Right? I'm just working on my computer. Prologic prog's bad. So I had to build a new one. A new one. Anyone ever tell you you're the smartest little man on the planet? You do, all the time. What's this? It's a pinhall camera. It's for the eclipse. The moon's gonna cover up the sun today. We're supposed to look at it at school. Speaking of which, you need to go get ready. You can't be late. Not today. Mom, I'm already dressed and I've packed my own lunch. That's what I've been doing this morning. What about you? Don't get smart with me. I've been working to pay our bills. Yeah, that's why they turned down our gas again? Go grab your stuff and wait by the backdoor, okay? - Why? - Just do it. Mom, what's going on? Nevermind, just keep your voice down and stay close to me. - Camera ready? - Yeah, almost. Hold on. It's like 70, 80 feet. This is so unreal. Okay, I'm good. Okay. Oh my... Oh my God! Oh my God! Claire! Oh my God! Claire! This is Claire Bennett. That was attempt number 6. You get out here, yes? Mr. Linderman, I'm gonna have to call you back in 5 minutes, okay? Thank you. I'm late. I've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting It happened two more times. Sometimes I'm falling, sometimes I'm flying. - Sometimes you're in 'em. - I don't have time for this now. They aren't just dreams, Nathan. Hold this. I thought they'd go away but they're not. I'm gonna need this back by 6, please. Thanks. This morning when I got out of bed, my foot hovered before it touched the ground. Hovered for a split second like I was floating. I'm telling you, I think I can fly. Is Owen decided? I'll tell you what, you think you can fly, why don't you just off the Brooklyn Bridge? See what happens. Maybe I oughta start with something a little lower first. It's le leng twalk. - You're serious? - Oh, I'm serious. You need to snap out of it, Peter. Go see a doctor. Get some drugs. Do not pull a Roger Clinton on me, man. I'm 8 points down in the polls. This is not about you, all right? Something is happening to me. And I have this feeling that you're the only person that's gonna understand. Why the hell would I understand that you think you can fly? Because you're my brother. Mom, look, I can't talk right now, I've got... What? I'll be there in ten minutes. - What did she do now? - She got arrested. - Arrested for what? - Shoplifting. I'm so depressed. What? What are you talking about? Why? - Camera ready? - Yeah. Besides the fact that it was so gross, I almost fudge myself, this is the single coolest thing that happened in this town in like a 100 years. Not if nobody finds out, it's not. Why did you want me to tape you? I have my reasons. It's not like you're not gonna be popular anymore Popular? who said anything about being popular? my life as I know it is over, okay? I've got the Bishop game next week, SATs in October, homecoming is 3 weeks from today and I'm a freak show! You're being a little dramatic, don't you think? No, I don't think. I have busted like every bone in my body, stabbed myself in the chest, I've shoved a two foot steel rod through my neck and I don't have a scratch on me. What do you call that thing, sticking out? Great! Just give me the tape, okay? I can give you a ride on my handlebars. If you want. Look...thanks, okay? I'll talk to you in front of people at school tomorrow. Promise. Your son is a very intelligent boy. Gifted, actually. That's not the issue. His father is not around and sometimes I think he could use a bit of a tronger hand, you know. I work nights a lot but uh... we can both work harder. It's not about the work. The truth is I just don't know if this school is the right fit for him. - But he's made friends. - I'm sorry. - He's on the soccer team. - I'm sorry. I wrote a check for $25,000 to get him into this snob fest. I was told that's what it took. That's on top of the tuition. About the tuition, your last 3 checks have bounced. Fine, take it out of the 25 grand that I gave you. That was a donation and it was very appreciated. Well, I want my money back. I want my money back now. That money went to capital campaign for the new wing. - It's already been spent. - Then unspend it. I'm sorry. We can maybe discuss an extension of the money you owe but I... I want my money back. That's not possible. Come on, baby. Let's get out of here. You're too good for this lousy school. Mom? Leave me alone! For god's sakes, ma. Are you okay? They dropped the charges. I had to fill out a form. No big deal. No big deal? I'm running for Congress. Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to me if it gets out? With our family's past. What could you possibly need so bad that you had to steal it? Nevermind, I don't wanna know. - Socks? - Socks. Dad left you a fortune. What are you thinking? You know, it's been one ridiculous stunt after another with you for the last 6 months. Dad's gone. Just get over it. You know what? Leave her alone. She's okay. That's all that matters. I gotta keep this out of the press. You know what? Just get out of here. Go worry about you, I'll handle this. Yeah, good, I gotta make sure this stays buried. Thanks a lot, ma'! What were you thinking? I just wanted to feel alive again. Nathan only cares about himself. Your father was the same way. Alpha dogs, both of them. You, in the meantime, for all your selflessness and sitting with dying people... What? You're gonna retire with what you make? Maybe I'll shoplift my socks. Don't get smart. When you put everyone else first, you end up last. You always put Nathan first, he took advantage. It wasn't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me? He takes up more space than you. Demanded more attention. And besides it's not my fault, you allowed it. He's my brother, I love him. Love is overrrated. He loves me too. You know it. You've always been close. Croseolorlasses. That's cruel, mom. Since dad died I know you've been feeling free to speak your mind but it wouldn't hurt to edit yourself every once in a while. I'm sorry if the truth hurts. I'm just saying you hero worships him. And those feelings will never return. You're wrong. It's biological. I can't help it. We're.. We're connected. I never told you this but when Nathan had his accident, I knew it. We all got the same call. No, I'm saying before the call. Like he was telling me. 300 miles away. I woke up and I knew that he'd been hurt. I hate it here. She doesn't even have any books to read. Baby, I'll be right back. I'm just gonna go and pack up a few things, okay? We should really go see dad. - What good would that do? - He could help. He should know that someone is trying to hurt us. Your dad is in no position to help us right now. Look, I made some mistakes. - I admit it. - Mom, what did you do? Hey. I need you to know that I would never let anything happen to you. I promise. Mom, why did you look at yourself like that in the fish tank? - How long? - A couple hours tops. There's some ice cream in the fridge. Go ahead. - What happened? - I went to see Linderman. How much? 30. You're gambling again? No, it's just bills. I used the rest to get Mika into private school. I don't know what to do with him in public and... it's just I needed them to think that we had money on the mob? Hell, Nicky. - You weren't born yesterday. - It's just 2 weeks overdue. I thought that I could handle it, okay? - I'm under a lot of stress, okay? - Gee, I wonder why! I feel like I'm kinda losing it a little bit. I'm seeing things. Like? Like I keep feeling like someone is watching me. Yeah, Linderman wants his money back so he sent some mouthbreather that's gonna put you in the hospital. No, it is someone else. It's someone that I can't see. Does this make any sense to you? No. - I'm sorry. You know what... - But I'll tell you what does. I shouldn't be telling you this. No, let me tell you what does make sense. You need to come up with that 30 grand plus interests now. Or you gotta run. Watch him. All right. Cool, huh? How hot do you think it is in there? Turn on the camera. Scotty! Scotty! Come on! - Take it easy. - I'm okay. - You're all right. - I'm fine. There's no burns. I was real sorry to hear about your father. Seemed like a good guy. Man! I thought I was a slob! They were here too. - What? - Nothing. I got a guy who can clean this up for a 100 bucks. No, it's all right. I'll take it as it is. We rent by the week. I'm gonna need to know you can afford it. - I have a job. - Doing what? Driving a taxi. I'll get you an application. Oh, god, what? The si tntreatment? Oh, boy. Isaac... what are you doing? What the hell is wrong with you Isaac Okay, stop What are you, crazy? clearly. I don't even remember painting these. I Was high, okay? - I lied to you. - Damn it. I've been chasing for a month. Well, then get yourself back into a program and make it stick this time. What are you talking out? Want to know what I'm talking about? You see this? Suice bombingin israel. - I painted it three weeks ago - Yeah . and so? so...that's this morning's paper. Look at the number on thhe bus This happened yesterday. Yesterday. Something's wrong with me. Well i'll get you help, isaac. I've tried that twice and there's only one way left, and you know it. You can't go cold turkey. Not alone. - I mean, let me help you, please. - No I Love you. I'll drag you down with me. I swear i will just leave me alone. Get out of here! Now! an unidentified samaritan witnses ribe as youeenage girl ran into the flames and rescued the young lieutenant. Now, the train is registered to the nuclear gutory commiion, ss and ere has been no official statement yet on whawas inhe c it wasn't easy, nathan, but consider it gone. I know, I owe you big on this one, Tom. - I'm not gonna forget it. - I won't let you forget it. - Thanks. - Sure thing. Mom's wrap sheet is now officially buried. It only took half of my political capital to pull her off. Why can't she get herself a hobby? Like a normal person? They were married 41 years. It's a plea for attention. She's lonely. Give her some time, will you? I don't have time. I've got 8 days to make up 10 points. I need all the help I can get which is what I want to talk to you the point, innit? They know you're not a kid. If you can show to them that you're adult, which you are, if you can show them that, they're on your side. If you rough it up though, it's away with a few of the old privileges. I've seen it in the army, you let men get bolshie and bolshie they are. And then where's it end? In the glass house. None of that nonsense here. They give you your chance and it's up to you. KATE: Yeah, I know it's up to me. -You finish your gardening? -Near enough. Would you like to go for a bit of a walk then? Walk? What's wrong with that? Some of them don't like it. -Who doesn't? -Staff. What I'm saying is it makes some of them a bit nervous. Whatever for? It's a bit dodgy, that's all. We're not doing anything, are we? Look, we're their responsibility, look at it like that. Well, supposing... Supposing that we did do something. Is that what you're after? No, it's not, I'm just asking. Well, it's none of their business, is it? Of course it is. Look, we're in here, aren't we? We're in their charge. You've got a lot to learn. Mind your feet. All I'm saying is... What I mean to say is... You and me, supposing we were attracted, it would be up to us, wouldn't it? You and me? That's a lot to do with why we're in here. No, I can't see how it is. You're an ill person, aren't you? Otherwise you wouldn't be in here. Yes, I suppose I am. Well, try and see it from their point of view. You're not fit to be carrying on like when you was outside. No one's fit to know themselves till they are discharged. I didn't carry on when I was outside! Yeah, well... I can see a look in your eye and see... What? You're fond of me. You like me, darling? No, I just asked you to go for a walk. That was all. I'm not promiscuous. Nothing wrong with asking to go for a walk. You come along tomorrow about the same time, we'll go for a little walk. I've a nice cup of tea for you. KATE: What do you want? Do we want our tea, then? -(STAMMERING) What do you want? -(SIGHS) Sit down, Kate. -It's about Paul Morris. -Oh. Oh, yes. -He's going out soon, you know. -Yes, yes, I know. He told me. Oh! You two have struck up quite a little friendship, haven't you? KATE: Well, no, not really... I'm not all that keen on him, you know. Good, because... (SIGHS) Well, it's not quite the right thing to be doing, you know. -Isn't it? -You know it isn't. You sound just like my mother. Well, I think that's something I needn't be ashamed of. They're coming to see you, aren't they? Tomorrow, is it? Yes, yes, that's right. Tomorrow. And I don't want you taken advantage of. I know what I'm doing, you know. -Oh, I didn't say you didn't... -I can take care of myself... Of course you can. -But for the time being... -I mean, am I misbehaving or something? Well... Shall we say a little self-willed? A bit thoughtless, no more than that. Oh, I see. So, is that what it is? You see, Kate, in hospitals, well... Well, you and Paul, I don't think it's quite suitable. I've heard that, not that it means anything serious, but I've heard your little walks upset Paul. Do you follow what I mean, Kate? No, I'm sorry, I don't. Well, he's not been so good, since, well, you know, since you got pally. Why? What have I done? You haven't done anything. I'm not saying it's you. It's just, well... He might be anxious about you. You think I've made him unwell again or something? But of course not, you silly girl. What on earth would put such an idea into your head? No, no, no. It's just that... He might be -embarrassed. -Well, what have I done, then? You haven't done anything. It's just these walks and talks that perhaps upset him a little when he's going out of here, you see. Tell me... Have I been worse? Well, you haven't been too well, lately, dear. Oh, you've been very good and taking your pills, but, we do have to be a little careful, don't we, when we're not feeling too good? But I don't feel too bad. I mean, at the moment, I feel quite well. -I don't feel too bad. -(SIGHS) You think you know better than the doctors and the rest of us? No, no. Of course not. There. I knew you'd see how it was. You're a bright girl. (THUDDING) WOMAN: Nurse. There, now, Kate. -Get off! -Hold tight. Hold tight. There you are. Easy, now. Easy, now. All right. Hold on. Relax. All right. Good girl. -There, that's better, isn't it? -I don't want to be in bed. Well, we can't have you up if you're going to create such a fuss, can we? -I haven't created any fuss. -What was all that then, with the chair? Now we're going to give you something to let you have a nice sleep. There, now. There. You'll feel much better when you've had a nice rest, Katie. I don't know what to make of it, Katie. I really don't. You know that nurse, love, she was really put out and I don't blame her. But, anyway, there you are. Now look, Katie love, have you been right all these years or have we? -I don't know. -"I don't know"? She doesn't know. Hitting the staff with a chair. Now, look, you said you knew what you were doing at the time. It isn't as though you were ill just for a minute now, is it? I said I wasn't attacking anybody. And then, there's this boy. What's going on there? -Nothing. -Nothing? It's nothing that ends up with you going wild. I didn't go wild. What else is it, Katie? We've heard their story, and we've heard yours. You admitted picking up the chair. Nobody's lying. You know, I think, really think, that you get things twisted, all jumbled up in your mind, afterwards. But you're giving trouble to all these people... You see, Katie love, now, look at it like this, it's you, Katie, you do as you like, you go your own way, but it's us, your father and your mother who have to suffer the consequences for it. You know, love, I hardly dare look that nurse in the face. MRS WINTER: We're not getting at you, Katie. MR WINTER: No, because if you go on like this, love, and after all, they are trying to help you. Well, they'll keep you in here forever. KATE: I sometimes think, if they, if I cooperate with them, I mean, that's how I'll end up in here forever. It's that nurse, she's always dominating me, she's always getting at me. -Always trying to put me down... -Listen, darling. Is it wrong to give you a bit of advice and guidance? She just doesn't like me, that's all. She just persecutes me all the time. Now, why should she do that, eh, love? You see, they're put here, they're trained, Katie. Do you see that, love? They're trained. I mean, there's doctors here, they've spent years. Now, the thing with you, you know, having your trouble, the way to look at it is as though it's just an ordinary physical disease in the body. Do you see, love? I mean, any other way of seeing it is old-fashioned. And all these old-fashioned ideas, they're all going out with... Well, today, you see we've got books and television programmes, and there isn't that stigma, is there, Mother, with it, really? No, there isn't, love. That is the nice thing about it. It's, um... It's just as though you've got a broken arm. Well, that's what I've heard said anyway. -Nothing to be ashamed of. -But I'm not ashamed. Now, look, I didn't say that you were, love. But if you were, well, it would be quite understandable. With the ignorance that's about these days... People who just don't want to know anything about it or couldn't care less, or can't face up to things. -You know, that sort of mentality. -(MRS WINTER MUTTERING) Now, if on the other hand, you get the nurses, who've been trained, who can look at you from the outside, who can see you as you can't see yourself, well, that, you see, is what they call professional. And for you to talk about her persecuting you... I hope you didn't actually say that to her face, did you? Because if you did, love, I mean, she'd hold it against you, won't she? Dad, will you just... Will you just ask her? Did she try to stop me seeing Paul? MRS WINTER: That's all right, love, we know all about it. Did she say that I shouldn't see him? MRS WINTER: What else could she do, love? What would happen if they had this on their hands at every first turn. MR WINTER: Do you not see her point of view, love? -Haven't I got a point of view? -MR WINTER: Of course you have. Have we ever denied it? Have we ever tried to take it away from you? KATE: (SOBBING) Don't want to hear anything, see anything... Now, look, just don't upset yourself, Katie. Well, they've got their... They've got these wires in here they go right inside my head and right into my brain. There's this great big machine at the centre of the earth and it controls everybody, it controls you and me and her... All of us! I can hear it, can't you hear it throbbing? -MR WINTER: There's no machine. -It's a war machine. Look at my hands. MR WINTER: I'm telling you, love, there's no machine... (CRYING) They'll kill me! MR WINTER: Nobody's going to kill you, love. You're all right, you're going to be quite all right. If you'd only give it time. Come along now, Kate. Come along. (KATE SOBBING) -I think we'll be going, Dad. -Say goodbye to Mum and Dad, then. Goodbye, Katie. We'll come again soon. Run along, dear. I'll be with you in a moment. I think it would be a very good idea... (WHISPERING) (KATE PANTING) Not going out this morning, Kate? -No, I don't feel like it. -No. You had a good night, didn't you? Yes, thanks. Yes. Such nice people, your parents. I think we were a bit naughty with them, weren't we? After they'd come all this way to see you. (CLICKS TONGUE) And then to go making your mother... Well, you remember, don't you? It's simply a matter of not losing our temper. Isn't it? MRS WINTER: It isn't the way I'd go on, you see? Not at all. I have to call it badness. I have to say, this matter of sex, you have to be careful and obtain a man's respect. You give them what they want, and there's no respect. And no future. You're no better than a prostitute. And one thing leads to another. Now, you can't say about what you've learnt. Nothing that's good and right from me and your father. And that's what you've got to go by. I hardly recognise you sometimes. You're a disappointment. And this with men, it's dirty, it's filthy. And until you learn some self-control... MR WINTER: I love you. I have since you were little. And I've tried. I think I can say that I've been a good father. And what have you done? You've pushed it all back in me face. Because you're self-willed. Your mother and me... I mean, she's a good woman. And I can't stand to see the effect of what you are doing... What you do to her. Undermining her health. I'm ashamed of you. I just can't put me mind to think of what you're doing and how you're behaving. If she has a breakdown or anything, it'll be on your conscience, my girl. We're not in this world to do as we like. I don't care how free... You see, Kate... You'll find that freedom doesn't come from self-indulgence. But it's doing what is right, and what you owe people. You can't live as if you're the only one breathing. Now can you, girl? So what we're trying to do in this hospital is to help you to help yourself. That's what we're here for. There's no one to push you about or regiment you, give you orders. Nobody here to make you do anything you don't want to, Kate. You do realise that? Everything has its purpose. And I think we know what that purpose is. In the end, it's for you to walk out through those gates and never come back. Isn't it? DOCTOR: Good morning, Kate. How are you this morning? No. Kate, you're not very well? I haven't... (STAMMERING) Really, I haven't... Yeah, I will. I'll let you. You can. Anything, I... Morning. I can "Good morning". Listen. "Good morning." -I can... -Well, there you are, you see? In many ways a fairly typical case history. Happy and sociable till her late teens. Then, in and out of various jobs for a while. Reputation for inefficiency, bad temper, rudeness. Often alienated from the people she was working with through the notion that they were, somehow, plotting against her, or disliked her, or tried to make a fool of her. And she was out of work for a time, and the parents noticed some improvement. From all accounts she became childish and tractable. The mother seems to think that this was one of Kate's well periods. Eventually, she worked again. Then, an unfortunate series of affairs, culminating in a pregnancy which was terminated at 11 weeks. The case notes here include, thought-blocking, over-inclusion, emotional apathy, automatic obedience. She was in seclusion for a time and gained a reputation for smashing in states of catatonic excitement. There were delusions of persecution. For example, that her mother was killing her, had killed her aborted child, that she was under the control of some all-powerful cosmic machine. The family history is negative and there's no detectable relationship between her various symptoms and her environment. Notice the posture, the occasional grimaces, the tendency to mumble things to herself. Well, I think the clinical picture is a very clear one. And the present state of the patient, what one might call a logical expectation, given the case history. Now, uh, diagnosis? STUDENT 1: Paranoia. DOCTOR: Paranoia. What treatment would you suggest? STUDENT 1: Um, that's a good question. (STUDENTS LAUGH) Well, let's have another diagnosis while you're thinking. Another? (STUDENT SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) -DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? -This is probably chronic schizophrenia. -Isn't it, sir? -Yes, now what treatment? -With drugs, um... -What drugs? Largactil. Three times a day, orally. DOCTOR: Yes, any other treatment suggest itself? What about ECT? -I beg your pardon? -What about ECT? ECT, yes. Can you tell me if electric shock treatment does any more than simply shake the patient up? DOCTOR: That patient completely anaesthetised, see? And feels nothing. Afterwards, some temporary loss of memory. Now, something between the teeth, that's to stop dislocation of the jaw. Notice how the electrodes are placed. NURSE: Okay. DOCTOR: Stand back. If I don't get an interview for this I should think I'm using the wrong toothpaste. I'm pulling all the strings, aren't I? NURSE: It'd be a nice one to get, sure. DOCTOR: Of course, we don't know how it works. All we know is that is does work. Quite remarkably. You know how this treatment originated? Yes, yes, it was pigs. More or less an accident, really. Naples, I think. Oh, my God, if we waited until we found out why these things work, we'd be waiting a long time. What are the chances of her committing suicide in the future? Do you think, sir, ultimately, this girl may have to have a brain operation for this condition? Perhaps the abortion played some part in worsening her condition. Do you think the fact that she was associating with friends that her parents regarded as undesirable has any bearing on the development of the disease? Is there any hope for this girl's recovery? What advice would you give about her employment in the future? Do you feel she could be a danger to the public upon leaving hospital? In any way? What is there left after all... After all the forms of treatment have failed? Would you say, at the moment, the outlook is not very good for her? Do I understand that you don't think her family background played any part in her illness at all? What, in fact, do you know about this family, besides the one or two interviews with her mother? With due respect, sir, you seem to be studiously avoiding any, um, environmental factors. You seem to have had a lot of them brought up, um... Strained relationships with her mother, associating with undesirable friends, her sister leaving home, and so on. And you seem to be studiously avoiding saying that the disease is something almost by itself. Surely, both before, as the cause of her illness, and after, as her means of treatment, one's got to take into account her home background. Captain. What is it, Webb? A blip, sir.Just came on the screen. How do you read it? Aircraft of some sort. By the size and speed, it's not one of ours. It doesn't read like anything I've ever seen. What was the approach? None, sir. It's just like it fell out of the sky. Current position? Directly over the Omaha installation. Holding there. Watch the scope, Webb. Air Defense will send somebody up for a closer look. We may have a real U.F.O. on our hands. [Alarm Blares] Space-- The final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds... to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man has gone before. Captain 's log-- Stardate 3113.2. We were enroute to Starbase 9 for resupply when a black star of high-gravitational attraction began to drag us toward it. It required all warp power in reverse to pull us away from the star. But, like snapping a rubber band, the break away sent us plunging through space, out of control, to stop here... wherever we are. Mr. Spock. Except for secondary systems, everything is out, sir. We're on impulse power only. Auxiliaries? If Mr. Scott is still with us, auxiliaries should be on momentarily. Are you all right, Lieutenant? Mr. Scott is still with us. This is the captain. Damage control parties on all decks, check in. All departments, tie-in with the record computer. Report casualties and operational readiness to the First Officer. Kirk out. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Control. I want them alerted to the position of that black star that's in the area of Starbase 9. Captain. Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries. Engineering reports warp engines nonoperational. Mr. Scott overrode the automatic helm setting. He's holding us in orbit on impulse power. Orbit where? Earth, Captain. We were on a course in this direction when we were pulled in by the star. The breakaway threw us on in the same direction. Screen on. We're too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit. Engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape velocity. Give us some altitude, Sulu. Yes, sir. Helm answering. She's sluggish, sir. Captain, normal Starfleet channel has nothing but static. I'm getting something on another frequency, but it's not Starfleet. Put it on audio. [Newscaster] This is the 5.:30 news summary. Cape Kennedy--the first manned Moon shot is scheduledfor Wednesday, 6A.M., Eastern Standard Time. All three astronauts who are making this historic-- Manned Moon shot? That was in the late 1960s. Apparently, Captain, so are we. What? Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain--backward. Exact chronometer readings in a few moments. Captain, I'm getting ground-to-air transmission. Verified. Scanners report some type of craft approaching from below, under cloud cover and closing. [Ground Control] Bluejay 4, this is Blackjack. We're tracking you and the U.F. O. I have him on my screen. Following. Mr. Sulu, can you gain altitude faster? I want to outdistance him. Picking up, sir. She's still slow in responding. Blackjack, this is Bluejay 4. U.F.O. is picking up speed and climbing. I'm going in closer. Bluejay 4, you should be close enough for visual contact. I can see it now. Whatever this is, it's big. Two cylindrical projections on top, one below. Purpose--undetermined. We have two flights scrambled andon the way. They should rendezvous in your sector in two minutes. It won't be here. The U.F.O.'s climbing away. [Ground Control] Bluejay 4, you're ordered to close and attempt to force the U.F. O. to land. We want it brought down or disabled until the other planes arrive. [Pilot] Acknowledged. Closing on target. Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor, equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads. If he hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our capacity to repair under current circumstances. Scotty, Activate tractor beam. Lock onto that aircraft and hold it out there. Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile for our tractor beam. [Scotty] Tractor beam on. We have the target. Aircraft is breaking up, Captain. Transporter room. Can you lock onto the cockpit of that aircraft? Scanning area, sir. Try and beam that pilot aboard. Take over, Mr. Spock. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. You speak English. That's right. You can step off the transporter, uh-- Captain John Christopher, United States Air Force. Serial number 4857932. Relax, Captain, you're among friends. I'm Captain James T. Kirk. What's going on here? Where am I? What happened? You people-- who are you? All in good time, Captain. Meanwhile... Let me apologize for bringing you aboard this ship so abruptly. It couldn't be helped. I didn't know your craft couldn't take our tractor beam-- Just tell me who you are. We'll tell you what we decide to tell you shortly. For now, relax. You're our guest. You'll find it interesting. Bridge to Captain Kirk. What is it, Mr. Spock? The aircraft has completely broken up. Shall we turn off the tractor beam? Affirmative. We have the pilot aboard. I'll be right up. Kirk out. Follow me. Good morning, Captain. Good morning. Captain. A woman? Crewman. Bridge. Must have taken quite a lot to build a ship like this. There are only 12 like it in the fleet. I see. Did the Navy-- We're a combined service, Captain. Our authority is the United Earth Space Probe Agency. United Earth? This is very difficult to explain. We're from your future. A time warp placed us here. It was an accident. You seem to have a lot of them. However... I can't deny the fact that you're here, with this ship. I never have believed in little green men. Neither have I. Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer Lieutenant Commander Spock. Captain. Feel free to look around, Captain. Don't touch anything. You'll find it interesting. Interesting is a word and a half for it, Captain. We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again as a U.F.O. Mr. Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines. Very well, Mr. Spock-- Anything else on your mind? Captain Christopher. What about him? We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man's future? Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations. And, in so doing, change what must be. And if it is changed, Captain, you and I, and all that we know, might not even exist. Your logic can be most... annoying. That flight suit must be uncomfortable. Why don't you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable? Then I want to meet you and him in my quarters. Yes, sir. Computer on. Record. [Computer] Recording. [Doorbell Buzzes] Come. Captain's log-- supplemental. Engineering Officer Scott informs warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and re-energized. [Computer] Computed and recorded, dear. Computer, you will not address me in that manner. Compute. Computed, dear. Mr. Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired. I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a starbase. I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so... affectionate. It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle. I take it a lady computer is not routine. We'd put in at Signet 14 for general repairs. Signet 14 is a planet dominated by women. They felt the ship's computer system lacked a personality. They gave it one. Female, of course. Ha ha! Well, you people certainly have interesting problems. I'd love to stay around to see how your girlfriend works out, but-- I'm afraid you'll have to. We can't send you back. Can't? Spock said that your transporter can beam down an object, even from an orbit this high. It's not the transporter. It's you. You know what the future looks like. If anybody else finds out, they could change its course, destroy it. Then my disappearance would change something, too. I have run a check on all historical tapes. They show no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher. Look, Captain, I don't buy all your time-accident story. The experts can figure out who you are, what you are. It's my duty to report what I've seen. What would you do? I'd...report, If I could. We can't take the risk. I don't want to know about risks. I have a wife, two children. What about them? I'm sorry. [Scotty] Engine room to Captain Kirk. Kirk here. What is it, Scotty? Progress report, sir. Everything's jerry-rigged, but we're coming along with the repairs. We could re-energize in about four hours, but, uh... But what, Scotty? Well, sir, as I say, the, uh, the engines are being repaired, but we've no place to go in this time. If you-- If--If you see what I mean? Sir? Yes, Scotty, carry on. Too bad, Captain. Maybe I can't go home, but neither can you. You're as much a prisoner in time as I am. Captain 's Log Stardate 3113.7. Our engines are being repaired, but we are still locked in time. And we have aboard a passenger whom we do not want, and we cannot return. Recommendation for his disposition, dear. Maintenance note-- My recording computer has a serious malfunction. Recommend it either be corrected... or scrapped. Compute. Computed. [Spock] Bridge to Captain Kirk. Kirk, here. Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher. Important I see you both immediately. Yes, Mr. Spock. Report to my quarters. I'll contact Captain Christopher. Yes, sir. Bridge out. Captain Christopher... Captain Christopher? Security, this is the captain. Security Chief here, sir. All decks alert. Captain Christopher is not in his assigned quarters. He may be trying to escape. Put a man outside the transporter room immediately. I'm heading there myself. All right! Nice and easy. Now I'm going to step into that thing, and you're going to transport me back to Earth. Well, Jim, with the exception of a slight bruise or two, our captain is as healthy as a proverbial horse. He'll be coming to in a minute. He tried to escape. I know how he feels, but I can't send him back with what he knows. Jim, what if we can't go back? What do we do? Wait up here for our supplies to run out, our power to die? It has to eventually, and we certainly can't go back to Earth. It would be worse than the Captain being returned. There are 430 of us. Now, that means 430 chances of altering the future. Yes... We're not in that position yet. I'm glad to hear it. And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong. We're roughly about the same age. But in our society, he'd be useless. Archaic. Maybe he could be retrained, re-educated. Now you're sounding like Spock. If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave. Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children? The answer to that is no. Mmm. You all right? Yeah. I see physical training is required in your service, too. Mmm. Crude methods, but effective. What does he mean by that? Just a joke, Captain. You said you had some additional information, Mr. Spock? I made an error in my computations. Oh? This could be an historic occasion. I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after all. Why? You said I made no relative contribution. Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I find, after running a cross-check on that factor, that your son Colonel Sean Jeffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant-- Wait a minute. I don't have a son. You mean, yet. The doctor is correct. Unless we return Captain Christopher to Earth, There will be no Colonel Sean Jeffrey Christopher to go to Saturn. Well, that's it, isn't it? We'll have to find some way of... A boy. I'm going to have a son. Acknowledging that we must return Captain Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the explanation of his return. We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it. It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska. That means those search parties will be crawling all over that range. Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter. When I made visual contact, I turned on my wing cameras. I got close enough to take some pretty clear pictures. Air Defense Command will be processing that film fast. And A.D.C. Control was probably recording my radio transmissions. If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sundogs, explainable things-- at least publicly. Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane. It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine U.F.O. Possibly alien... definitely destructive. What about our problem, Mr. Spock? Any ideas on how to get us back to our own time? A theory... a reverse application of what happened to us. Logically, it could work. Also, logically, there are a hundred variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're in now. We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos. If the captain feels duty bound to report what he saw, there won't be any evidence to support him. That makes me look like a liar or a fool. Perhaps. Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a U.F.O. Captain, I know that base. I was stationed there a year ago. I'd like to-- No, Captain. Thank you. But if anything should go wrong, you might get hurt. We couldn't risk that. Neither could you... or your son. Well, I'd like to help. I could sketch a layout of the place for you, show you where the record section and the photo lab are. Primitive computer. I've seen them demonstrated in museums. Me, too. If this one's like those, it'll make the devil's noise if you start it. I don't intend to start it. How long have they been down there now? 15 minutes, 28 seconds. Well, shouldn't they be coming up? It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more time-consuming than a direct approach. In our case-- Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mr. Spock? I am. Hold it. Get your hands up. Now...one at a time-- Hand me those belts. And the bag. It's been too long. Jim should have at least signaled by now. You may be correct, Doctor. Open communicator channel. [Beep Beep] What was that? What was what? That noise. I didn't hear anything. [Beep Beep] That noise- - It's coming from one of these things. [Beep Beep] [Whirring] The emergency signal. Stay right where you are. One emergency signal, sir. Beam up immediately. Only one signal. What happened? We'll know in a moment, Doctor. [Signal Sounds] Kirk to Enterprise. Spock here. Are you all right, Captain? Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we have...another problem. Captain 's Log, Stardate 3113.9. First Officer Spock recording. Due to an unfortunate accident, we have taken aboard another unwanted passenger. Your surprise package is an air police sergeant from the base. Keep him there. No use in letting him see more of the ship than is necessary. I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain. Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is. Kirk out. What was the chronometer reading when we first sighted Christopher's jet? 5:30 in that time zone-- maybe a little after. Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? You've got them all. [Door Opens] We'll try the darkroom. Photo lab. That's... That's it. That's all ofthem. Signal Mr. Spock that we're almost ready to beam up. I'll make a check of the files just in case. Yes, sir. All right. Where's the other one? What other one? Your partner. I saw somebody move in there. No, no, no.Just me. Besides, could anyone get out of here without your seeing them? No. Nobody should have been able to. Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mr. Sulu. Engine room to Mr. Spock. Spock here. We've completedre-energizing the warp engines, sir. We can refire them anytime. Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory. Aye, sir. Engine room out. Hmm. Poor photography. Blast your theories and observations, Mr. Spock. What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one. I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain Christopher to the briefing room. Now, look, Mister. You and I had better start communicating. I want to know how you got in here. That's a simple question. Nobody saw you. You got all the way inside without tripping any alarm. How did you do it? Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me. Don't try to be funny. How did you get in? I popped in out of thin air. You seem to think this is some kind of a game. No, Colonel. I know it's no game. What did you say your name was? For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk. And how did you get inside a top security installation, James T. Kirk? I told you you wouldn't believe me. Uh... Colonel, would you mind being careful with that? That worries you, huh? Is that a radio, transmitter of some kind? Of some kind. You can be more specific than that, Kirk. I don't like mysteries. If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one-- a big one. I'll have it disassembled and examined. We are not dummies, mister. We know how to fi nd out things we want to know. What is that? Is that a uniform of some kind? This little thing? Something I slipped on. Kirk, maybe you don't realize how serious this is. Sabotage of a government installation-- Did I sabotage something? No. We stopped you in time. But what would you have done if we hadn't found you? Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all. Is that what you're here for, nothing at all? That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered. All right, Kirk. maybe this will make you laugh-- Sabotage, espionage, unauthorized entry, burglary! How are those for starters? I can think up lots more if you don't start talking. All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri, a beautiful place. You ought to see it. I am going to lock you up for 200 years. That ought to be Just about right. He's probably being held in security section. Even if they've notified the authorities, it'll take time for someone to get there. Can you give us the coordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms? Yes. But you're not going to get them unless you take me with you. I can't do that, Captain. If something went wrong-- Something's already gone wrong. You could beam down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him. Mr. Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me. The captain will provide the coordinates for the transporter chief. Shall I issue phasers? One for you, one for me, set on heavy stun force. Yes, sir. You don't trust me, Spock. In fact, I do... but only to a certain point. Energize. Do they do that all the time? Are you hungry? Uh-huh. What would you like? Maybe some chicken soup. It is. Just a minute, sir. Hold it. [Knock On Door] See what that is, airman. Don't you find that painful, Captain? Yes, I do. What's he doing here? He knew the exact beam down coordinates. It was necessary to bring him along. I see. No harm done. Mr. Sulu, did you check out those tapes? Mr. Spock ran them through. We got them all. They know you've been here. They have a mystery and no answers. Mr. Sulu, signal the transporter chief. Four to beam up. Uh-uh. Not me. Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake. You bet I do-- My family. A son that isn't born yet. You don't have to return me now, Captain. Spock, come out of there. You can't explain your presence here. It's my duty to report everything. That's explanation enough. Spock! You'll go home, Christopher... but you'll do it our way. Over my dead body. I suspected he might not wish to return with us. Four to beam up, Mr. Sulu. Yes, sir. Captain 's Log, Stardate 3114.1. We must make an attempt to break free of this time, or we and our reluctant passengers will remain its prisoners. All we have is a theory anda few facts. Mr. Scott and I both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect, Like the one that put us here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash will propel us into another time warp. Slingshot effects are fine for you people. How do you propose to return the Sergeant and me? Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened. You won't remember anything, because it never would have happened. What if you can't pull free of the sun? We'll not be getting so close that my engines couldn't pull us out. What I am worried about, sir-- We may not have much control when we're thrown forward again. Helm control? Braking control, sir. If I can't stop us soon enough, we may overshoot our time, and if I stop the engines suddenly, the strain may tear us apart. Any way we do it, it's a mighty rough ride. Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance-- especially if one is all you have. Assume your stations. Affirmative. Engineering to bridge. Environmentalcontrol, negative. Engineering control, negative. Ahead warp factor 3, Mr. Sulu. Warp factor 3, sir. I never thought I'd make it into space. I was in line to be chosen for the space program... but I didn't qualify. Take a good look around, Captain. You made it here ahead of all of them. Sir, our speed is increasing. We're traveling at warp 8. Mr. Spock. Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And, Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed o ftime passage will now increase. Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain Christopher, you only have about 15 years, so you'd better hurry. Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. 10... 9...8... 7...6... 5...4... 3...2... Now, Mr. Sulu. More power, Mr. Sulu. Maximum now, sir. She's fighting it. Engineering, can you give a damage report? Point 5here. Confirm. Gravity is down to point 8. We've broken free and heading back. Gaining speed now, Captain. We're now at warp 4. Warp 7. 8. Off the dial, sir. Chronometer is moving forward again, Captain. You have the chronometer reading and the coordinates to return Captain Christopher and the guard? Computed. Bridge to transporter room. Captain Christopher. This is Christopher. We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain. Everything A-okay. Uh, Captain... thanks for the look ahead. Our pleasure, Captain. Bridge out. 20 minutes, sir. It'll be close. Bridge to transporter room. Prepare to energize. 10 minutes. 9... 8... 7... 6... 5...4... 3...2... Energize. You should be close enough for a visual contact. Bluejay 4. Can you see it? What is it? Bluejay 4. Come in. We've lost the image. Blackjack, this is Bluejay 4. I could have sworn there was some kind of ship, but... nothing could have moved that fast. We don't track mirages. Mark it down as another U.F. O. Bluejay 4 returning to base. Out. Approaching second beaming, Captain. Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energize. Now. Energize. Past Pluto, sir. What's our reading, Mr. Spock? Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin... now. Bridge to engineering. Begin full braking power. Pulling away from the sun weakened them, sir. They may blow apart if I reverse. No choice, Mr. Scott. Aye, sir. 50 years to go. Engines cutting back, sir. No decrease in speed. 40... 30... Never mind, Mr. Spock. The engines! Engine room to bridge. Engines are on full reverse, and they're buckling! Bridge! Mr. Scott is still with us. Captain. Starfleet Control calling Enterprise. Come in, Enterprise. Open a channel, Uhura. Frequency open, sir. Starfleet Control, this is the Enterprise. Captain Kirk speaking. [Computer] Recordship arrival, dear. Enterprise, this is Starfleet Control. Come in, please. Starfleet Control, repeating message. The Enterprise is home. Kirk out. Coming up on it fast, sir. Are you certain of your sensor readings? Definitely a space vessel of some type. - Origin? - Unknown. It could hardly be an Earth ship. There have been no flights - into this sector for years. - I'm picking up a signal, sir. Captain, that's the old Morse code call signal. - Thank you, lieutenant. - C-Q. C-Q. We're reading it, lieutenant. I thought you said it couldn't possibly be an Earth vessel. Fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong. An emotional Earth weakness of mine. There it is. An old Earth vessel similar to the DY-500 class. Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s. Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic. Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens. - Weapons status. - Deflector shields on maximum. - Phasers manned, sir. - Bio-scanners report. Life science bio-scanners are picking up heartbeats from over there. Can't be human, though. They're too faint and average, only four beats per minute. Sensor reading, captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel. All decks, go to full alert. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 3141.9. A full hour has elapsed since interception of the strange vessel. Our presence alongside is still being completely ignored. Although our sensors continue to show signs of equipment and life aboard, there's been no indication of danger to us. Weapons Department, maintain battle stations. All other decks, stand by alert. All decks acknowledging, sir. Continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there. Very faint, very slow. Seems to be coming from about 60 or 70 bodies, - as near as I can make out. - Alien bodies, Bones? Could be. There's no sign of breathing or any other form of respiration. Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars. However, scanners make out a name, SS Botany Bay. Then you can check the registry. No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary, however. The mid 1990s was the era of your last so-called "World War." The Eugenics Wars. Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding. Now, wait a minute, not our attempt, Mr. Spock, a group of ambitious scientists. I'm sure you know the type: Devoted to logic, completely unemotional... - Doctor, I would be pleased... - All right, gentlemen, as you were. Rig for tractor beam, helm. Lock onto that vessel. - Rigging for tractor beam, sir. - Bridge is yours, Mr. Spock. Care to join the landing party, doctor? Well, if you're actually giving me a choice... I'm not. Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-century Earth. Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change. What's her name? McGivers? Lieutenant McGivers. Attention. The following personnel report to Transporter Room: Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers. Acknowledge. McGivers, on my way. It looks like that ship is expecting us. We read heat coming on, complete oxygen atmosphere. Very interesting. You ready, Bones? No. Signed aboard this ship to practise medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget. You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy. Where's that historian? - Well, come on, Lieutenant... - McGivers, sir. Energize. Scotty? Definitely Earth-type mechanisms, sir. Twentieth-century vessel. Old-type atomic power. Bulky, solid. I think they used to call them "transistor units." I'd love to tear this baby apart. Captain, it's a sleeper ship. Suspended animation? I've seen old photographs of this. Necessary because of the time involved in space travel until about the year 2018. It took years just to travel from one planet to another. Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel? Theoretically possible. I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period. What a handsome group of people. Jim, I have a new reading. Lights must have triggered some mechanism. Captain, look here. Scotty? Beats me what's happening. We've triggered something, all right. Heartbeat's increasing, now passing eight beats per minute. And there are some signs of respiration beginning. This one was probably programmed to be triggered first. Could he be the leader? The leader. Lieutenant. Yes, sir. The leader was often set to revive first. This would allow him to decide whether the conditions warranted revival of the others. Heartbeat now approaching 40 per minute. The respiration pattern is firming up. From the northern India area, I'd guess, probably a Sikh. They're the most fantastic warriors. - Heartbeat now 52 and increasing. - The others? There's no change. And they're all mixed types: Western, mid-European, Latin, Oriental. A man from the 20th century coming alive. Maybe. Heartbeat dropping. Circuit shorting. Probably some dust. Heartbeat now 30, dropping fast. There's a heart flutter. He's dying. - Do something, captain. - Can we? Take an hour to figure out. What happens if we get him out of there? He'll die in seconds if we don't. How long? How long have you been sleeping? Two centuries, we estimate. Landing party to Enterprise. Come in. Go ahead, boarding party, we read you. Lock in on Dr. McCoy's beam. He's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here. Magnificent. Captain's log, supplemental. Alongside the SS Botany Bay for ten hours now. A boarding party of engineering and medical specialists are now completing their examination of the mysterious vessel. Attempts to revive other sleepers await our success or failure with the casualty already beamed over. Dr. McCoy is frankly amazed at his physical and recuperative power. - Kirk to boarding party. - Scott here. Scotty, any records? Log books of any kind? Negative, captain. It appears they were in suspended animation - when the ship took off. - How many alive? Twelve units have malfunctioned, leaving 72 still operating. Thirty of those are women. Kirk out. Seventy-two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mr. Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years. A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record whatsoever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was 10,000-1 against their making it to another star system. And why no record of the trip? Botany Bay that was the name of a penal colony on the shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel... If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion. Your Earth was on the verge of a Dark Ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships. Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours. Even a theory requires some facts, captain. So far I have none. - And that irritates you, Mr. Spock. - Irritation? - Yeah. I am not capable of that emotion. My apologies, Mr. Spock. You suspect some danger in them? Insufficient facts always invites danger, captain. Well, I'd better get some facts. - Rig for towing. - Aye, aye, sir. - Make course for Starbase 12. - Aye, sir. That'll be all. - Bones? - He'll live. - My compliments. - No, I'm good, but not that good. There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death. Now, look at that. Even as he is now, his heart valve action is twice the power of yours or mine. Lung efficiency, 50 percent better. An improved breed of human. That's what the Eugenics War was all about. I'd estimate he could lift us both with one arm. Be interesting to see if his brain matches his body. Doctor, will he live? Lt appears he will, lieutenant. I'd like to talk to you. If I were to rate your performance as a member of the landing party today... I know, sir. I'm sorry. Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel might depend on the performance of a single crewman aboard. And the fact that you find a man strangely compelling to you personally... Not personally, captain, professionally. My profession is historian, and to find a specimen from the past, alive... I mean, the sheer delight of examining his mind. And men were more adventuresome then. Bolder, more colourful. - Yes, sir, I think they were. - Good. If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes. - That's all. - Yes, sir. A pity you wasted your life on command, Jim. You'd have made a fair psychologist. Fair? Sickbay to lab. - Anything new on those bios? - They all came out fine, doctor. Good. McCoy out. Well, either choke me or cut my throat. Make up your mind. English. I thought I dreamed hearing it. Where am I? You're in... You're in bed holding a knife at your doctor's throat. Answer my question. It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery, just under the left ear. I like a brave man. I was simply trying to avoid an argument. You're aboard the United Spaceship Enterprise. Your vessel is in tow. I remember a voice. Did I hear it say I had been sleeping for two centuries? That is correct. Where is your captain? I have many questions. - Bridge. - I have a patient here - with many questions, captain. - On my way. James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. I see. And your name? I have a few questions first. What is your heading? Our heading is Starbase 12, a planet in the Gamma 400 star system our command base in this sector. Is that of any use to you? And my people? Seventy-two of your life-support canisters are still functioning. - You will revive them. - As soon as we reach Starbase 12. I see. And now... Khan is my name. - Khan. Nothing else? - Khan. What was the exact date of your liftoff? We know it was sometime in the early 1990s, but... I find myself growing fatigued, doctor. May we continue this questioning at some other time? The facts I need, Mr. Khan, will take very little time. For example, the nature of your expedition. Jim, a little later might be better. Captain, I wonder if I could have something to read during my convalescence. I was once an engineer of sorts. I would be most interested in studying the technical manuals on your vessel. Yes, I understand. You have 200 years of catching up to do. Precisely. They're available to any patient on the viewing screen. Dr. McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes. Thank you, captain. You are very cooperative. This Khan is not what I expected of a 20th-century man. I note he's making considerable use of our technical library. Common courtesy, Mr. Spock. He's going to spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selected breeding? There is that possibility, captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over 40 nations. Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant. They began to battle among themselves. Because the scientists overlooked one fact: Superior ability breeds superior ambition. Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons. I've collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some 80 or 90 of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated. That fact isn't in the history texts. Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some 80 Napoleons might still be alive? - Ship's historian. Lieutenant... - Marla McGivers. Yes. I am told you participated in my rebirth. In a small way. I've been reading up on starships, but they have one luxury not mentioned in the manuals. I don't understand. A beautiful woman. My name is Khan. Please sit and entertain me. I'd like some historical information about your ship. - Its purpose and... - And why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion? Lt's comfortable. But it's not attractive. There. Soft. Natural. - Simple. - Mr. Khan, I'm here on business. You find no pleasure here? My interest is scientific. Men of... That is the world of the past. I'm sure you understand, actually to talk to a man of your century... There. Simple. Soft. Please remember. Perhaps some other time when you feel more like talking about the past. I'm glad you came. Please do it again. Very impressive. Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner? Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century. Just how strongly is she attracted to him? Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim. My curiosity is official, not personal, Bones. Well, he has a magnetism, almost electric. You felt it. And it could overpower McGivers with her preoccupation with the past. Thank you. I hoped you might guide me to our dinner engagement. Very good. - Fine technique. - It's a gladiator named Flavius. - He once... - And you've rearranged your hair for me. Excellent. All bold men from the past. Richard, Leif Ericson, Napoleon. A hobby of yours, such men? I am honoured. Thank you. But I caution you such men dare take what they want. Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Khan, but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey. And how you managed to keep it out of the history books. Adventure, captain. Adventure. There was little else left on Earth. There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble effort. Tyranny, sir, or an attempt to unify humanity? Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip? I know something of those years, remember. It was a time of great dreams, of great aspiration. Under dozens of petty dictatorships. One man would have ruled eventually, as Rome under Caesar. Think of its accomplishments. Then your sympathies were with... You are an excellent tactician, captain. You let your second-in-command attack while you sit and watch for weakness. You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mr. Khan. This is a social occasion. It has been said that social occasions are only warfare concealed. Many prefer it more honest, more open. You fled. Why, were you afraid? - I've never been afraid. - But you left at the very time - mankind needed courage. - We offered the world order! We? Excellent. Excellent. But if you will excuse me, gentlemen and ladies. I grow fatigued again. With your permission, captain, I will return to my quarters. I wanted to apologise. They had no right to treat you that way. Quite understandable, since I'm something of a mystery to them. You're no mystery to me. I know exactly who you are. Do you? Leif Ericson, Richard the Lion-Hearted, Napoleon. I don't know if you're going to like living in our time. Then I'll have to remould it to my liking. - Please don't. - Go. Or stay, but do it because it is what you wish to do. Well? I'll stay a little longer. How many minutes do you graciously offer? - I only meant... - This grows tiresome. You must now ask to stay. I'd like to stay. Please? Open your heart. Will you open your heart? Yes. I intend to take this ship. - Do you agree? - Please don't ask me to... I need your help. You won't harm anyone? - Now you question me? - No. Will you assist me? - Please, Khan, don't ask... - Leave me, then. Go, I say. No. I promise. I'll do anything you ask. Name: Khan, as we know him today. Name: Khan Noonien Singh. From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of your world, from Asia through the Middle East. The last of the tyrants to be overthrown. I must confess, gentlemen, I've always held a sneaking admiration for this one. He was the best of the tyrants, and the most dangerous. They were supermen, in a sense. Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more daring. Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is... Mr. Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us. Appalling, but there, nevertheless. There were no massacres under his rule. - And as little freedom. - a good little head on her. She has her own business, beauty parlour down on Anne Street. Silver Swan we call it. Doing very well there too. Perhaps your wife would like to come in and try it. Well actually I... I don't have a wife. Well we do manicures for men. Well thank you but... I don't think I'm that kind of man. I didn't really think you were. Look... it's Tommy Marsh. It's great to see you, Quirke. We'll have a drink one day soon. Yeah we will, Billy. Tommy! Goodbye. (Seagulls squawk) All set? Will I give you a lift to the salon? No, I'm not ready. Ah well. I best hit the road then, so. Do you have your passport? I have. Did you tell them I want to look at the books when I get back? I did. There's nothing to worry about, Billy. We're doing fine. Did I say I was worried? Come on, now. My little angel. I wish I didn't have to go at all. Sure you'll be back soon enough. Can't be too soon for me. Mrs Griffin. That's fine, take a seat. Sarah. Hello. Wh-what are you doing here? I just didn't want Mal to know. He takes everything so seriously. He gets so worried. Wh-what's wrong? Oh, headaches... really bad ones. Sometimes so bad that I... well whole days go by and I... Who have you been seeing? Fitzgerald. And? He's running ECGs and em... x-rays and... he says he can't find anything wrong. I think...what you need... is a good holiday. Yeah. I think we both need a good holiday. Where would we go? Rome, Florence? Mm. Verona. What would I say to Mal? You can tell him you're going to Verona with me. (Chuckles) Sarah... you know where I am if you ever need to talk to me about anything. I know. (Doorbell tinkles) I'm sorry, Mrs Cuffe-Wilkes. Punctuality is the politeness of princes, Ms Griffin. Yeah, Mrs Cuffe-Wilkes. But now that you are here, you can do me a message. I've run out of rosewater for the tissue paper. Keel's Rosewater, I'd better write that down. Would be a tragedy if I got it wrong, wouldn't it? Hardly that. Oh I don't know. Little things mean a lot. That's a song, isn't it? (He sings) ? Blow me a kiss from across the room, ? say I look nice when I'm not. ? Touch my hair as you pass my chair, ♪ little things mean a lot. ♪ Keel's Rosewater. And your name is? Em... Griffin. Griffin. (Door opens) Miss or Mrs? Miss. Telephone number? 147-749. And is that a daytime number? Yeah, it's the hat shop. Maison de Chapeaux. (He speaks in French accent) Maison de Chapeaux! Tell me, how is Mrs Cuff-Wilkes? She's alright. I could tell you a thing or two about that one. Right, well we'll give you a ring very soon. I'm sure we'll be able to help you one way or another. Thank you. Goodbye. Aurevoir. Who was that? A Miss Griffin, very nice young lady works in the hat shop. You don't want a nice, young lady, Leslie, you want me. Come on. Let's take the afternoon off. (Knocks on glass) Doctor Quirke. Doctor Sinclair. I used to be afraid of those things when I was a little lad. My aunty had one and she'd pretend to give me a nip with it. I always thought she'd take off the end of my nose. So... any joy? Ah... melatonin quantities that suggest she took an overdose of sleeping medication. And eh... diamorhphine which I can't really account for. That's heroin. Thank you, Doctor Sinclair. See there's no underlying pathology, so I'd say that she wasn't taking it for pain relief. We were just looking for needle marks. I wouldn't have thought she was the type. I don't think there's any particular type. See, there's no nasal inflammation which means she was taking it orally. Suicide or accident, would you say? Hard to tell. I mean with that combination of drugs it could be a mistake. She was a long way from home. Well if it was me... I'd lose myself in the mountains, do it there. You've thought about it, then? Haven't we all? Not me, Doctor Quirke. So you don't suspect foul play? It's too early to tell. I'd like to find out was it is that she took though. Any bottles or pills found in the car? If there were they'd be impounded as evidence, let me look into it. (Keys jangle) Bloody hell! Do you need a hand with that? Hello again! Yeah, thank you. Bloody door slammed shut and Mrs Hunter's gone home, would you mind? Keys are in my jacket pocket just there. Thank you. That's the ticket. Now don't run away. Doctor Quirke! Just on my way home. Where'd you find it? In the car. I didn't give it to you, alright? It's not proper procedure. So why are you? If I follow proper procedure in every case, I'd never get anything done. It's got no label on it. But there's some residue left at the bottom. This will be very helpful. Thanks. Let me know what you find. I will. I won't take up any more of your evening, Doctor Quirke. Oh, Inspector... em... I was going to go for a drink, if eh... Well we've reached a respectable hour. Right. (Indistinct chatter) So, what's it to be? Gin and tonic. Gin and tonic, that's my girl. Make that two, please. More tonic than gin, Ms Griffin? All the vices. I approve, Ms Griffin. Phoebe. Phoebe. Tell me, Phoebe, any relation to the illustrious Judge Griffin? His granddaughter. Ah! Oh well. So what are you doing working in a shop? You're not one of nature's shop girls, I can tell. Slumming it, are we? I was studying to be a doctor, but then... it's a long story. Good, I like long stories. The hat shop suits me fine. Phoebe. Hello, Quirke. Lesley White, proprietor of the Silver Swan around the corner. And you are? Quirke. What's this? Ms Griffin was kind enough to give me a helping hand and I'm repaying her with a drink. Is that alright with you? Let me buy you one. No thanks. Sarah says that you're leaving home. What if I am? (Scoffs) She's worried about you. She's no need to be. I can look after myself. Now, if don't mind, Quirke. Another time, then. Golly who was that? No-one. A man I used to know. Leaving home, eh? Yeah. And where are you off to? I don't really know. I haven't found a place yet. Well this might just be your lucky day. I happen to know of a place that might suit you just around the corner as well let me write the address. (Laughing) Friends of yours? Eh, family. It's my eh... my niece. Ah. Just through here. I'm very sorry for your loss. (Door bangs) Now, Mr Millican. Doctor Quirke's post mortem examination seems to suggest your wife had been taking sleeping pills and pain killers for some time. Did she have trouble sleeping? Mm, sometimes. She had em... problems with her nerves. And why would she have needed to take pain killers? I don't know. She didn't tell me about anything like that. Mr Millican, as things stand, Doctor Quirke can't tell whether your wife committed suicide or died from an accidental overdose anything you can tell us will help us determine which it was. Will we be able to avoid an inquest? I doubt that. I can't have the coroner putting it on record that Geraldine killed herself. Ta-da! Where did you get them? He gave them to me. They're disgusting. Yeah, they are, aren't they? Who is she? Just a woman I used to know. I better not tell you her name, you'd be shocked. Awfully good sport though, wouldn't you say? Why did she give them you, how could she? Well, I suppose she's a bit of an exhibitionist and she thought I might like them, of course, she didn't think I'd show them to you. Which you shouldn't have. No, I suppose not. But you're glad I did, aren't you? I am not! You're terrible what you've turned me into. I used to be a good girl, you know? I don't believe you've ever been a very good girl, Deirdre. Billy thinks I'm a good girl. Thinks I'm his angel. If only he knew. Give us one of your pills, will you? Don't you think you're getting a little too keen on those pills, Deirdre? Well if I am we know whose fault that is. Come on, Leslie. Don't tease me. I don't have any. You keep taking them all. (Whispers) I'm sorry. I just... I... I hate the feeling in my hands that comes to me when I get... Christ sake! I can't stay here all afternoon. Alright. Go down to Harcourt Street, number 24, ground floor flat chap called Hakim Kreutz will sort you out with a little something. I don't like until I see. Don't be silly. You needn't be afraid of Hakim he's an absolute sweetie. He'd adore you. He does spiritual healing as well and I think in your case he'll absolutely insist on it. (Children shouting) (Door creaks) Good afternoon. Dr Kreutz Yeah? Leslie sent me. Ah yeah. Come in. Sit down, relax. This is most... most pleasant. And how may I help you today? I was hoping that... do you have any of that relaxant that you give to Leslie? I-I can pay for it. No! No my dear I'm not a drug dealer. I keep only a small supply for the purpose of relaxation. But em... if you like we might come to an arrangement? What sort of an arrangement? Oh, no, no... nothing to alarm. There is perhaps, a small favour you might grant me. What? I would like to take your photograph. See, this is my work, on the wall, yeah? I'm a serious photographer. And you are a most beautiful woman. You mean, nudey pictures? Yeah, of course. The body is nothing to be ashamed of, especially one so beautiful. And the photographs would be tasteful, and not for display, or sale. Just for my private collection. And you wouldn't want anything else? No. I'm a professional man. And a most serious artist. So em... perhaps today? A little something to relax you. Alright. And a little water. (Pours water) (Stamps foot) I don't want to interrupt you, Quirke. I was a bit short with you the other night. Meant to catch up with you later but, you'd gone. I was all a mess. What did I say. Phoebe's taken a room in Harcourt Street. Moving in today. On Harcourt Street? I worry she has a taste for the low life... Inherited from me, no doubt. I didn't say that. What do you want from me, Mal? We thought you might keep an eye on her, she's eh... well she's not talking to us. I'll do my best, but eh..she's not really talking to me either. Right. She's the only child I've ever had, Quirke and I worry about the Judge. You need to forgive him. Forgive him? He's not getting any younger. And he's, he's always asking about you. Well, he knows where I am if he wants to find me. I've invited him round for some dinner tonight. Will you do that? No, I won't do that, Mal. No. Do it for me then. Will you do it for me? I never ask you for anything, do I? Do I? Alright. I'll do it. Good. We eat at eight. (Door opens and closes) (Children playing) Thank you. Thank you, Miss. Hello. Hello. I'm Phoebe Griffin, I'll be upstairs. Ah! My name is Doctor Hakim Kreutz. You're most welcome, Ms Griffin. (Door opens) Good to see you, Quirke. Mm. I hope you're keeping well. Oh, I'm keeping well. Still knocking back the old grog anyway? Yeah. Phoebe sends her love, by the way. She couldn't join us unfortunately. Yeah, it's extremely disappointing. Where is she? In a flat, on Harcourt Street. A what? A flat. A flat? That's put me right off my mackerel. What do you make of that, Quirke? I dunno. You don't know. Good answer. Well in my opinion, you've all driven her out because of your shenanigans. Oh yeah. I suppose you're going to sit there with a pus on you all night, are you? Because if you think I care what your opinion is about ME, what happened in Boston.. Oh yeah, well, let's... Let's agree to differ. Isn't that right, Maggie? What's that, Judge? Families have to agree to differ. A family would fall apart if they couldn't agree to differ. Well let's... let's agree what it is that we differ about. I don't argue with hypocrites. Oh, I'm not the hypocrite here. This mackerel is excellent. Try cleaning up your own mess before you muck about with mine. Yeah. I know you went to the Guards about me. Did you think I wouldn't find out? I wanted you to find out. And what happened? Exactly nothing just as I predicted. Well they closed down that Laundry place, didn't they? That's the church's decision. They're perfectly within their right to. Well, do you think it's right to be stealing babies from their mothers, do you? You think that's right or legal? Ah, legal! You think I sat in a courtroom for half a century and didn't know what the law is for? Well maybe a little law would have protected that little girl that you chucked out. Maybe it would've protected her from being murdered by that toe-rag! You now what? I'm worse to sit here an let you speak to me like that. You're half sozzled, look at you, I can tell! What time was your first one today? What's that got to do with anything? You are guests in my house, if you can't be civil to each other, go somewhere else! Ah, Sarah... (Bangs table) I suggest we'll just have to agree to differ. Agree to differ. Let's all agree to differ. We'll agree to differ. You said that. Agree to differ! H-how many more times are you going to say 'agree to differ'? I have to go to work in the morning. I'm so sorry, Sarah. (Thunder rumbles) It's alright. I think I'll sleep in the spare room. Aren't you feeling well? No. Compared to other spats when we were growing up, that was pretty mild. Well... I just feel like everything's gone wrong. Oh, don't be silly. Phoebe will come back. When her temper cools down. You'll see. Why would she want to come back? What do you mean? Just to keep us together. What? ! Don't let's pretend, Mal. I'm not pretending anything. I never thought there was any point in telling her. You and Quirke! No wonder she's annoyed at you. At me. Well what did I do wrong? Apart from giving her a home? And loving her. So did I, Mal. Don't sleep in the spare room, Sarah. You have the big bed, I'll go. We're closed! Billy! There she is. Oh I missed you so much, my little Angel. I thought you weren't back until Monday? I finished early. And... I'm Salesman of the Month again. Well done you. Ah like I give a bollocks about that. Here we are. I got you some of those chocs you like. You're very sweet to remember. And... this. Well go on. Open it. It's a dainty gold watch. You shouldn't have. What else would I spend my money on? Ah I bless the day I found you in Plunkett's Pharmacy I do. I do. I do, I do, I do. (Rapid knocking on door) Hakim! Come on, Kreutzy boy, I know you're in there. Jesus! You gave me a fright. Why didn't you answer the door when I knocked? I didn't know it was you. Who did you think it was then? Come on. Come on, you know why I'm here, and don't palm me off with any old rubbish, that last lot was enough to snuff. Ah, Kreutzy boy what have you done now? W-What do you mean, I don't understand. You've done a very bad thing, there Kreutzy boy. Did I say you were to do that? She seemed ready. I thought you would be pleased. I don't believe you. I think you, are trying to cut me out. No, no I assure you... no! (Whimpers in pain) (Glass smashes) You burnt my hand! My hands are my living. Yeah, well it will teach you to keep them to yourself. Perhaps I should go to the police? You wouldn't dare. I'm taking these and I want the negatives before I really hurt you. Fine. Let's get your name on them, shall we? Credit where credit's due and all that. Hakim Kreutz Studios. Very nice. (Gathers up photos) Now we won't go to the cops, will we? (Letterbox clatters) On the road again. At least it's only Belfast this time. Not bloody Berne. This is grand. Are you not going to have any yourself? I'm not really that hungry, Billy. I-I think I've a bit of an upset tummy. You can sit down with me for a couple of minutes at least. Come on. Well you don't look yourself. Should I call the doctor before I go? No it'll pass. Are you sure now? Is there something you're not telling me? It's just an upset tummy, Billy. You're so sweet to me, I don't deserve you. Ah look at the time. I've got to go. My little angel. You take care. (Door closes) (Items clattering in drawer) (Car engine revs) (Doorbell tinkles) How did you get these? What have you done? ! Where did you get them from? Hakim Kreutz Studios. That's nothing to do with me, darling. You've got to admit Kreutz has got flair. It was you! (Crying) I know it was. How much do you think Billy would pay Kreutz to keep it quiet, hm? You bastard! Did I ask you to go around there and show him all you've got? No you did that all by yourself! And I must say I don't care much for him, I don't care much for these pictures either! Funnily enough they don't do a thing for me, not one thing. It's all a question of timing, really. I think we've had our time. It was nice while it lasted, but it's over. Sorry and all that. (Door opens and closes) Mr Hunt, how's it going? Not so bad. Yourself? Not too bad, not too bad. Okay. Alright, if you just step inside and bring your samples case with you. The kettle's on. Lovely. Back on Wednesday? I am. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Lovely. What did he say? He said, well, I stopped playing pocket billiards when I was 15-years-old, and she said, I don't care I'm still not shaking your hand. (She laughs) Oh God, that is so... Oh Quirke... isn't it nice? I mean aren't you glad we're past all that mooning at each other across crowded rooms like two teenagers? Oh yeah. And besides it's unbecoming of a woman of your age! (She laughs) I should brain you. (He laughs) All that pain and havoc that you caused me. Have I? Once upon a time, yeah. But not any more? No. Well, thank God for that. Yeah, thank God. Phoebe's still mad about you. You do know that? Mad about or... mad at? Always watch out for her, won't you? Yeah. Yeah of course I will. Thank you. Oh, I'll get this. No, no let me get this, please. This was my idea. You can get the next one. Alright. I like your hat, by the way. Thank you! It's new. You're very dear to me, you know? To all of us. Ah! There you go. Well this is... nice. Here we are. Keel's Rosewater. I could have just come into the shop to collect it. No. It's nice to make an occasion of it. Now tell me... do you always wear black? I suppose I do. It's required at the shop and I seem to got into the habit. Yeah, habit's about right. Do I look like a nun to you? No. You look like a convent girl. Were you? Yeah. I adore convent girls. It's wonderful. - Well, this is my office. - This door ? I walk past here every day but we've never met, how incredible. I know. Well, thanks for the chat. Bye, see you. Well, well, Freud ! - I'm terribly sorry. - I've been waiting for an hour ! - Don't crucify me. - You were with a woman. Was it a blonde or a redhead ? - You're far too reserved. - You're the client. - Shall we begin ? - I gave her a present yesterday, as you said. - Did you get rid of all the memories ? - Yes, they're in that box. - You were supposed to destroy them. - I couldn't do it. Do me a favour, you do it. - But something strange happened. - What ? In the box I found the DVD of our wedding. - So I watched it. - And that's strange ? - Yes, I've never watched it before. - Why not ? It bored me, every time Claudia showed it to someone, I'd leave. Don't wedding videos bore you too ? Yes, but maybe I'd make an exception for my own. - Anyway, I watched it. - And ? I was moved. Just like a kid. Claudia was beautiful. - She really is beautiful. - I didn't get that. - She still is very beautiful. - Of course, she's not changed much. I was crying proper tears. You felt nostalgic, that's understandable. - Is it ? - In fact, it's real progress ..towards true awareness. - Awareness of what ? Of the fact that your wedding is really over. So the fact that I held her tight when we were in bed afterwards... - ..means it's over ? - Of course. - I was worried ! - No, it's normal. Is it normal that I felt like making love to her too ? - Did you ? - No. - Good. - But I have to, one last time ! Well, there's time for that. Really ? Well, we haven't touched each other for a long time. At first, we did it all the time ! - Does this subject embarrass you ? - No, why ? - You therapists have regular sex. - Regular as clockwork. At first we did it all the time, you wouldn't believe it ! She had this funny way of moaning... a sort of shrill... - Enough ! - Sorry, I got carried away. - And then ? - I'd sleep like a log ! - No, what changed ? - In our relationship ? - Yes. What happens to everyone, I think, everything became routine and repetitive. And normal. Well, how do I look ? - A bit boyish ? - How about a skirt ? I refuse to strut back and forth in different dresses like in an American sitcom, with you sitting there shaking your heads ! I like this outfit, it's elegant. - I feel comfortable so I'm wearing it. - So why ask us then ? It's an excuse to talk. You have to help me with the technical details. What time should I pick him up ? Sara, it's them who should pick you up and it's them who should choose the restaurant. Right. - It's ringing. - So it should be. Roberto, hi. It's Sara. At 9:30 ? Perfect. - Make him feel important. - I'll stand right next to the buzzer. - Don't overdo it. - But don't be late ! - Somewhere in between. - Okay, see you later. Bye. You shouldn't talk to me while I'm on the phone ! You said you'd stand right next to the buzzer ! I'm at the office, the audit guys are in so I don't know if I'll make it, you know how it is... - Shame, the Masterchef final's on. - The final ? I thought we could watch it whilst we pig out on the sofa. I know, but I don't think I'll make it. I'll get some treats in anyway. - And if you don't finish too late I'll leave you some. - All right. Bye. - Hi, honey ! - It's so cool here. They've played a few tracks and they're awesome. I can hear them, they're real loud ! It's pumping ! No, they're having a break now. - How long will you be ? - I don't know if I can make it tonight. What ? I've been really looking forward to it ! I know, but the audit guys are in, you know how it is... No, I don't know how it is or who they are ! I promise I'll try to come. - Bye, honey. - Okay, bye. - Is he coming ? - He said he'll try. Good evening and welcome. This way, please. - This is your table. - Thanks. After you. - This place is really nice. - Thanks. - The wine list. - Give it to me. For you. If I get a bottle, will you have some ? Just a drop. Don't straight women drink ? I can finish a bottle myself ! Here you are ! - Back already ? - Yes, I tried to speed them up. Great, come and sit down. - How's it going ? - They're down to the last two. The girl made ravioli stuffed with grouper, sea urchins, scented with thyme and bottarga shavings. - What about the other one ? - Crepes with asparagus crispy artichokes and white truffle. - And we're eating nachos. - But we have tortillas too. - That's good ! - Have some dips... My ex's name was Jodie, it still is, but I just want to forget now. Sorry, isn't Jodie a woman's name ? - A woman's name ? - Like Jodie Foster. But it can also be a guy's name. - Like "Joedi Maggio". - "Joedi" Maggio? We'd been together for over a year then out of the blue... - How did it end ? - Badly ! Relationships always end badly or they wouldn't end. - Am I right in thinking that he left you ? - The day I asked him to marry me. Ah, you asked him to get married ? He asked me to marry him. They day he asked me to marry him ! He asked you to marry him then left you on the same day ? - What a bitch ! - Who's the bitch ? - Me, what a bitch I am ! - You ? - Me ! I'd even said yes. Excuse me for asking, but why did it end ? Because he wanted a kid at all costs. - Strange, usually it's women who insist... - She did insist. - Who's she ? - Him... I mean. It's not that I didn't want to. I said that maybe marriage would be a good incentive ! But he was dying to get pregnant ! To get pregnant ? - To get pregnant, no ? - To get pregnant ? What's it called when you want to stick those things into ovums ? - To get a woman pregnant. - That's what I said. "Not even a goodnight text" - Hi. - Hi, are you new ? - Yes, it's my first day here. Bless. An orange juice, please. "I forgot to mention something," "when a girl turns me on" "I start sneezing." - Do you want it with ice or without ? With. - It wasn't a total disaster. - Don't lie, I know. About what ? - You talked about your ex all night. - My ex-boyfriend ! - Well, it's the same. - No. I worked real hard trying to get the pronouns right. You can't depress everyone with your story about Jodie. - You know what men are like. - No, I don't know ! I told you: make them feel special. He said you're not over your ex yet. And that you're confused. And you should go easy on the booze. I know, I messed up, but he was no good anyway. But Roberto is fantastic. Too fantastic, too handsome, too tall, too perfect ! - Have you seen his ass ? - What about it ? Your boyfriend's ass can't be smaller than yours. We'll find one with a bigger ass. No, forget it, maybe I need to accept I'm not cut out for men either. - Great, come to the bookshop to do that then. - Okay. Here's your juice. Excuse me ! Excuse me ! I come here for breakfast, I always have juice... - Thanks for the juice. - No problem. Seeing that I drank half of it maybe I can get you another. To be honest I'm still quite thirsty and hungry too. How about you ? Bless you ! An allergy, I hope No... really don't think so... - Where shall we go ? - You decide ! Okay... come with me. So you've ended the nightmare of evenings in front of the TV too ! What a drag ! Maybe you wanted to go out all night, drink energy drinks, but no. You got roped into sitting on the sofa with your wife ! And don't say it was all right because I won't believe you ! Well, we can continue with your therapy. - My therapy ? - Yes. Yesterday I bought two tickets to Paris, because Claudia adores it. We'll spend a few days by ourselves. It's too soon. You said that being together somewhere nice would make us see that we can't be together, not even on holiday, out of our routine. That it was important to end it ! Too important. Alessandro, please... you're confused. You need more sessions before organizing a trip by yourselves ! - I'll take Emma to Paris. - Who ? - Emma. I promised her. - We'd planned it... - Planned it ? Emma... she doesn't even have a passport ! She doesn't need one, it's Europe ! Plus, we've never spent two days together, this could be the right occasion. It could be, but is it ? Who should I take to Paris, Claudia or Emma ? This is a very delicate decision. We shouldn't rush into things, we need to reflect ! I know that ! - Listen, would these tickets be refundable ? - No. No... It's all right. Really, it's all right. I booked for tonight. Is 8:30 okay ? Do you like Japanese food ? What's up ? What is it ? What's the matter ? You were late, I said it's all right. You were late and I should be angry ? Well, maybe something happened. If you screw up, I get mad. If I screw up, you get mad. Hi. - Are you always in a rush ? - I just finished with my last client. If you've finished, would you like to come shopping with me ? - Of course. - Why don't you come round for dinner tonight ? - Do like fried courgette flowers ? - Of course. Hi, dad. - What are you doing here ? - We need to talk. Well, I have a couple of things to tell you. Not on the couch, please. Come on, just for once, I'm tired. The first is that there's a guy I like. I'm always a bit worried about your infatuations. And then I've found out who stole the books, he's stopped now. - Did you report this criminal ? - No. Why not ? - Because it's the guy I like. - The thief ? - Yes, but he's not a thief. - He steals, he's a thief ! - But only librettos. - Why doesn't he buy them ? They're not essential items. For him they are, he's deaf and dumb. - I don't understand. - He was born deaf. - You're joking ! - No. - You are. - No, help me understand him ! Because it's hard, he's distrustful, very touchy. He's really sensitive. We fixed a date for tonight but we fell out today. I really like him, but I don't know how to be around him. Listen, Marta... your little sister has brought home a 50-year-old boyfriend. Your other sister wants to change sexuality. You're in love with a kleptomaniac, who's deaf and dumb and touchy... You know what I think ? That I'm sick to bloody death of playing the role of the modern, understanding father ! Who understands me ? Fathers have to behave like fathers, not friends ! Don't you understand ? I won't help you, because this guy's not right for you either, just like the writer, the philosopher and the juggler. I'll remind you that you brought a juggler home ! - So ? - What's wrong with an ordinary guy ? You want a dad you can moan about ? Okay, now you have one. Thank you. Hi, dad. You won't believe it, but today I met a guy I really like. Why wouldn't I believe you ? Even though he's a guy, I like him. It was fate, you know when you hit it off right away ? - Do you like this ? - Nice. - What's wrong ? - Nothing. I know you, what is it ? I had an argument with your sister. How typical of Emma. I was talking about Marta. She likes a guy, a thief, and she wants my approval. So ? Aren't you pleased that she wants your approval ? We're a disaster, I know, but plenty of dads would love to have three daughters who still need them. Think when we won't ask you anything anymore... Has she already gone out ? To Lanificio, a vintage restaurant, she looked beautiful ! Where are you going ? - Well ? - To dinner with the dog lady. - White or red ? - To get her drunk, red's better. - Her husband will be there. - White then. Can I give you a piece of advice ? Now that you're going out with... - Luca. - Luca. Don't get carried away. Often we men mistake enthusiasm for frivolity, then we have our wicked way and call it a day. Have a nice evening, darling. Would you like an aperitif to start with ? - Yes, thanks. - Any preference ? An aperitif. Don't worry, darling. Ignore me, carry on reading. You want to know how to behave ? Be normal: get mad if he makes you mad, and tell him off when he's wrong. And don't be over-protective. They tend to be anxious, especially if they don't understand. Those who can hear forget about other people's deafness and the problems involved. They're not able to do that. You've brought him to this beautiful, romantic place... for him it's just a dark place. Where it's hard to read your lips. Don't treat him like he's deaf, but don't ever forget that he is. Have a nice evening, darling. Hi, good evening. Please, come in. - May I ? - Come in. - Follow me. - Thanks. - Shall I... - What ? - Shall I put that in the fridge ? White wine, nice. Alessandro's been held up at work, so he'll be late. - At work ? - Yes, but we can begin. Honey, come on, it's ready ! - Here, this is for you. - For me ? - Why ? What is it ? - Open it. Are they chocolates ? A map of Paris, nice. - What are these circles ? - The places we'll see together. - Of course, when we go. - You promised it'd be soon. Real soon ! Of course. "For the attention of the head of personnel." It's a letter of resignation written by me. - Did you write it ? - Yes. - What does it mean ? - What you just read. It's a letter of resignation. Honey, you're an architect, a great architect. It's time you got serious about your career ! This is my plan: I'll take my exams, then we'll take a year off, we'll travel round Europe to see all the great works of art. You need to get your inspiration back ! - What do you think ? - That it's a great plan. A bit hard to put into action, though. Shit, who gives a damn ! We have our whole lives ahead ! Here's to life ! To life ! You've really never been with anyone since you separated ? At first I hoped Ilaria would return, that it was just a phase, and that we'd have put our dentures in the same glass. But then time went by, and I got used to being on my own. I wanted to focus on looking after my three daughters. - Be honest, you do it on purpose. - Do what ? You know perfectly well ! A man who's so dedicated to his girls is irresistible to women. You think so ? I assure you. - Well, when we get talking... - Time flies, I know. Well... I should go. - I live here. - Nice. - What's the plan ? - The plan ? No, I mean... What's the plan ? I'd love to let you have your way right now but my therapist says you're nearly all bastards, so I'll wait till next time, if you don't mind. I don't mind. Well, what else can I say... Till next time. - Can I have my dad's office keys ? - No. - Please ! - Why ? - I have to get something, he knows. - Darling ! - Honey ! Why didn't you tell me you're seeing my father ? - Sorry ? - You know what I'm talking about. I couldn't tell you, it's confidential. - For him, not for you. - I didn't think it was appropriate. It's a delicate matter. You're in therapy to try and save your marriage but you don't tell me ? Don't shout. I don't want to save it, it's over. You know that ! - So why are you in therapy then ? - To fully accept that it's over between us. I'm trying to end it, it's not easy. - Are you really trying to end it ? - Of course. Honey ! Hi. I came to thank you for the Paris trip, but I picked the wrong time, What ? You said you were taking me ! - Her ? She's 20 years old ! - You said you were trying to end it. You told her you were trying to end it ? - I can... - You're sick. And I'm 18, actually. Shut up. Just shut up. Now I know why you've been so nice recently. - That's not why. - Please ! Aren't you ashamed ? She may be 18, but she's right about one thing. You really are sick. There's 20% off all sofas, grab a bargain. You knew he meant a lot to me ! - I knew he wasn't right for you. - Why try to save his marriage ? That's my job. Is it your job to ruin your daughter's life too ? What's up ? Luca, he's invited me to his house. Fabio's invited me to his house too. - I'm a bit nervous. - Me too. I'm meeting him after work. Can we focus on me ? I've never been with a man, tell me how to do it. We've joked until now, but now I'm going to Luca's house, I'm in the shit ! Just let him do everything, you can't go wrong. The light, shall I ask him to turn it off ? I don't know, some people like to keep it on. You're no good, you're no help whatsoever ! Tell me about your first time, so it'll be less embarrassing. No way ! I'll tell you what I do with women and you tell me if that's okay. All right. To start, I put on some music. He'll do that, you're going to his house. I take her hand and accompany her to the bedroom. Or do straight people start on the sofa ? We skip that... It depends. Just see where he takes you. Then I look into her eyes with desire - and I start undressing her. - No, you wait for him to do that. Perfect. Then I lay her gently down on the bed and I start caressing her everywhere, on her nose, eyes, mouth, neck... and I touch her nipples. Spare me the details ! Forget about all that and let him make the first move. Shit, can't I do anything ? Making love to a man's a real drag ! You can invert your roles later, but at first it's best the man leads the way. - Why ? - I don't know ! They're the men and we're the women. Women are passive, where's the fun ? Sorry... could you turn the light off ? "You want to know what I felt seeing it for real ?" "I found it funny." "That thing hanging between his legs looked absurd ! " "Right, now it's no longer hanging." "It's not so funny now, more aggressive, I'd say." "Yes, most definitely." Very aggressive ! "And now what do I do with this thing ?" - Want to use something ? - No, I'll have a drink later. No, I mean as a contraceptive. No, nothing. Hi ! - How are you ? - Fine. Excuse me. What is it ? What's the matter ? Tell me what's wrong. Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Okay, let's go. I... I'm going. Enough ! - This is my voice. - Please, stop it. Happy now ? Open up, please ! - Alessandro? - She's gone. - What do you mean ? - She's gone, she's not here. - Have you tried to... - She won't answer her phone. No one's heard from her, she's left the dog here, she'd never do that. I'm very worried. Let's report her missing. - I'll come with you. - I'll pick you up. - I'm coming with you. - There's no need. There is, I think you've both caused enough trouble already. When did you last hear from her ? Over 1 2 hours ago. I think it's a bit soon to declare her missing. We're talking about someone who's never gone away, - ..she's never left the dog... - I love you. - Yes, I love you. Knowing her, something has happened, trust me. Or I wouldn't be here. All right. - Do you have a photo of her ? - Sorry ? - A photo of her. - Not with me, no. - Give me a description then. - Okay. - Height ? - About 1.70 m. - Maybe a bit more. - Yes, a bit more. - So, 1.72m ? - Yes. - Hair ? - Fair. - Can you be more precise ? - Quite fair. Let's say, honey blonde. With lighter strands around the neck area. She often wears it up, but sometimes she wears it down. Over her shoulders, yes. Eyes ? - Green, is that enough ? - Light green... with hints of blue. And small specks of amber, which are especially visible in daylight... Who should I be speaking to ? Has dad ever spoken to you about Alessandro's wife ? I'm bloody furious with dad, but this doesn't make sense. Will you help me or should I keep thinking that my dad's a bastard ? Well ? Alessandro's wife and the lady with the dog are the same person. What ? Yes. And believe me, getting her back with her husband cost him a great deal. Do you realise ? If I hadn't ordered a juice, I'd never have met you. Juice or no juice, I'd have found you all the same. This afternoon my cousin is coming from Turin, for one night. - Do you mind ? - No, not at all. - She's fun. - Is she ? Hi. Hi. Bless you ! - You must be Sara. - And you must be Barbara. Come in. - Luca's still at the office. - Forgive me for intruding ! What a cool house ! I'm flying to Prague tomorrow, - I'm sorry to burst in like this. - Nonsense ! Plus, you're family... Actually, we're second cousins, we've not see each other since we were 10. Baia Felice Campsite, in Terracina ! A luxury resort ! - Shall I make some coffee ? - I'll make some. - What a cute girlfriend my cousin has. - Thanks. - I remember him being a loser. - No way ! - We were 10... - He's gorgeous now. - You're defending him... - Lucky you, being so in love. - Aren't you ? No, never again. "I'm here to tell you something, it's about you and me." "Words should bring us together..." "but if that's not the case, we can do without them." "I can stop speaking." "Or I can learn your language." "But regardless of sounds, silences..." "and noise." "And regardless of any form of communication..." "I want you." I was such an idiot, I hadn't realised. - What a bastard ! - You see ? But, you know how long it took me to end it ? 10 minutes, honestly ! I left before he could even think of inventing an excuse. And you know what the funny thing is ? That I'm happy ! - And I've reached a decision. - What ? I want to have a relationship with a woman. I've given it a lot of thought. Being with a woman must be fantastic, I really want to try. Look at us two, for example, we've only just met and already we're in harmony. That would never happen with a man. I think... things are much better between two women. Think about it. - Believe me, it's not like that. - What do you know ? I know because sexuality is an important thing, - you can't decide in haste. - It's not a hasty decision. - It's not ? - I can feel it in my belly. - Not your belly... - All in my belly ! Maybe you've been unlucky, not all men are bastards. Luca is an incredible man. He's caring, attentive and gentle. He's restored my faith in men. - What are you doing ? - Can I take a shower ? Everything you need is upstairs, hot water, cold water and soft water. - How long have you been together ? - Not long. Three days. - Only three days ? - And a half. Come on ! We'll talk about it again in two years' time ! Anyway, I bet sex with a woman is fantastic. Our bodies are so much nicer, more appealing, smoother. - Don't you agree ? - Yes ! I want to try it. I'm so disappointed with men It might not be forever, I'll try, I'll experiment, to understand... - Can I use a towel ? - Upstairs. There's no soap, can you bring some ? Luca, sorry, something came up... It's nothing serious, just a family matter. I'm really sorry I can't be with you tonight ! But your cousin's here, take her for a walk, or out to dinner... Yes, her flight's in the morning, I'll be back tomorrow. If I don't see her, say goodbye for me. "Tonight: Row M, seat 1 " Luca, I'm back. "Sara, you were right, not all men are bastards." "Luca is a fantastic guy, he's caring and sensitive." "Sorry, I hope you'll be able to forgive me." "Sara, we didn't plan this, honestly." "It took us by surprise too." "We've gone away together and we'll be back next week." "Sorry, sorry, sorry." "You're a fantastic woman." "You can leave the keys with the concierge." I'm a fantastic woman. Hi. - Where did you get to ? - Can I come in ? Of course. Alessandro was cheating on me, and you knew. You should sit down next to me, right ? You know, being cheated on isn't what hurts. It's the humiliation, of having to say certain things... And having to ask all those questions. Why ? When ? When did you see each other ? For heaven's sake... I'd rather die, you know. But I have absolutely no desire to die. So you know what I did ? I committed suicide. Just for a few seconds. One jump and off you go. Your whole life flashes before your eyes and you fall down, down, down... all the way to the bottom. But then you get up again, and you go up, up, up, all the way up to the top... and then it's fantastic, because you've left everything behind you. And you're ready to start all over again. Ready to start over, maybe from the couch of his dear childhood friend. I'm not a childhood friend of his, I'm his therapist. - He was in therapy ? - Yes. And he found out many very important things. But the most important one was that he still loves his wife. - What did he tell you ? - Where would you like me to start ? From the beginning. I'll start from Zia Teresa's in Maccarese then. "Okay, I've finished." "I don't feel any better, but how could I have known ?" "It's only by doing it that I realised it wouldn't help." "Now there's just one thing left for me to do." "You are my heart's delight," "And where you are, I long to be" "And where you are, I long to be" "You make my darkness bright," "When like a star you shine on me" "Shine, then, my whole life through" "Your life divine bids me hope anew" "That dreams of mine may at last come true" I love you. I love you. Honey ! Hi. Thanks. You saved my life. I think I did. Do you have an allergy ? No, not at all... Your memory foam. Or you'll have a bad neck ! Thanks. The house is deserted, the fridge is empty, I'm hungry. Shall we go for something to eat ? Okay, let's go. But no hamburgers or chips. All right, you choose. Mexican. - Dad ? - Yes ? - What colour are my eyes ? - They're ocean blue with hints of grey. The left one has honey-coloured flecks. I love you ! BLAME FREUD Subtitles: Laser S. Film s.r.l. - Rome Previously on "The Lottery"... The first viable human embryo in six years. One hundred human eggs have been successfully fertilized. - What do you suggest? - A lottery. Let every woman out there have a chance to hit the jackpot. You, the people, will vote for the one hundred best mothers. Lottery finalist number 88... Perry sommers. Number two hundred... Angela Maria Perez, The eyes of the world are upon you. History has chosen you. Anything you say or do is being transmitted live to the American people. Son of a bitch! Come on! - It's all right. - Is it? I don't even want a baby. What's this contestant's name? What do you want from me? I just want to chat. This panel has decided to terminate the parental rights of the father. Elvis Walker is now a ward of the state. Why the hell are you following me? ! I'm a part of the Maytwos. Kyle Walker... welcome. There was one address he visited a few times... Crystal City. I see you've met my daughter. So, uh... Where are you staying? At my dad's apartment in Crystal City. We have to remove obstacles. Are you talking about the president? I'm talking about the future. Y-you're saying my father is connected to the fertility crisis? We think the government is responsible for the crisis. Fertility crisis? Yes. You're saying the United States government is behind the global fertility crisis? Yes. And you have actual proof? We can tie the government to Heliogenics. That's the company that was funding the infertility research Kessler was doing. Do you know who was involved? Do you have names? You mean like Darius Hayes? Yes. Can you tie him to this? Not yet. But I know he was involved. He's been covering something up all along. Look, if... if we want to take him down, we need hard evidence. It's got to be bulletproof. Dig in to everything you have... Your files, Heliogenics. Try to connect Darius. And if he finds out what we're up to... you'll protect us? I will. But don't let it come to that. And don't breathe a word of this to anyone... no one. Wait. Where are you going? I need to figure out what Darius is going to do next. This is fantastic. I couldn't be more thrilled. Again, thanks so much for letting me do this. Oh, I trust you'll handle it the right way. Welcome, everyone. I'm Jack Kerr, and I have your ticket to the hottest show in the country... the lottery. With the guidance of our lovely and gracious first lady, Gabrielle Westwood, we'll go behind the scenes of this historic event. Thank you, Jack. So nice to see you. And welcome, America. Tonight you'll get a better idea of what our contestants are experiencing. Now, I have no doubt that among these two hundred women, we will be able to find one hundred wonderful, loving mothers. Who those one hundred are... well, that's up to you, the people. That's great. We'll use that as the cold open. - Okay. - Are you ready for your interview? Sure. Yeah, I got the address. I'll be there shortly. Are you serious? You're gonna join the Maytwos? I'm going to have a conversation with them. They are not good people. Look, they're taking a stand against the "D of H". They are bombing testing centers. They're the only ones out there who are willing to get my son back. Is that what they told you? And you believed them? I've been to lawyers. I've been to judges. I've tried every legal method. I've been playing by the rules, but the game is rigged. My son is in an institution, a damn prison. And if they can help me get him out, I'm in. I get it. But it's not that simple. Nobody does anything for free. They are going to use you. And I'm gonna use them. It's a relationship. People use each other. So, you think this is the right venue? The lottery event? The only way that people will demand fundamental change is if we create a public outrage, induce shock so they'll feel vulnerable and exposed. Then we'll have control. Darius, as you might imagine, his protection will be extreme, historic even. That's why we need to breach his security. He'll be an easier target. Forcing them to evacuate. Improves our odds. Yeah, but it's not that easy. Their extraction plan will be highly classified. Let's talk to the secret service, see what they'll tell us. Did you talk to our friend? I have. His on board? I think so. I'll know more soon. What is that? It's a fertility doll. I brought it back from Ghana. Does it work? Well, that's what the clerk told me in the souvenir shop... Once she found out I was Vice President. Good. We need all the help we can get. We're announcing the one hundred winners of the lottery on Friday. It's a big gala event. I hear it's gonna be quite a party. Oh, yeah. Darius and Langdon are meeting with the secret service to review the security measures. I want you to sit in and make sure they don't hijack it. What are we talking about, Tom? Sit down. Darius is gonna try and turn this event into a military operation. Make sure he doesn't. I don't want the American people staring at a bunch of armed soldiers and tanks. We're trying to inspire hope, not fear. Don't worry, Tom. I can handle Darius. We met before, right? Yeah, last Summer, I think. At church? No. At a party. Agent Kent said you could help me out. All I need is a photo and a start point. Just so you know, the person I want you to follow is a high-ranking member of government. Well, unless it's my mother or father, I don't really care. It's Darius Hayes. Can you do this? Sure. Planning the revolution? Have a seat, Kyle. We don't invest in furniture here. Security dictates we move every nine days. Nice. You've set up a temporary mesh system to cloak your communications. You know about these things. I did duty in Venezuela... Tactical. You're gonna fit right in. Look, I get what you stand for. You hate the government. But what do you actually do here? Our mandate is to disrupt the infrastructure of the current government. We work with very powerful people. They have lots of money. They have lots of connections. But they don't like getting their hands dirty. You do? Whenever it's necessary. Last time we spoke, you told me that you could help me get my son back. - We can. - How? We've got topos... Um... moles... Inside of the "D of H", very close to your son. How do I know you're telling me the truth? It's a game of trust. And you and I are both playing. I don't play games. You give me a picture of my son wearing this mask, I'll do whatever it is you want. The state department's picking up credible chatter around the lottery announcement. Specifically, this Maytwos underground group may be planning something. So, now we're worried about a bunch of beatniks with computers? It would be a mistake to underestimate them. Then let's not. Are you prepared in case something happens that night? We are. But the specific security measures are confidential. I understand, but given the role the department of humanity is playing in this event, I think it's imperative we get on the same page so there are no disruptions. We don't want troops or tanks. This thing should look like a celebration, not a war zone. That doesn't mean we can pretend there are no security risks. So, if you wouldn't mind, I'd really appreciate if you dropped the formalities and gave us a little more insight into the plan. I'm afraid I can't do that. Like I said, that's confidential. We're just trying to help out here, Ted. I certainly would be willing to work with you on this. We can provide troops. We can provide tanks. I said no tanks. No tanks. We certainly could help with the emergency extraction plan. Well, I'd have to run that by my superiors. Uh, Ted, in case you've forgotten, I am one of your superiors, also one of the people who would need to be extracted, so... Sir, I story. - Yeah, I didn't think so. - I can't even imagine. And then there's Brandon. He hates me. VOICE: Brandon. Brandon! Come on, Dad, help me! Come on, let's go. - Oh, my word! - Brandon, what happened? - Oh, my God. - Don't let go of me! Ow! Stop it, okay? They're just scratches! I'm fine! That's been happening to you an awful lot lately. What did you do? He didn't. He didn't do anything. What does this look like to you? No. No, Michael! Don't touch him. Not him. Not ever. Watch him! But it wasn't me. There's been an accident. I wonder... Actually, I was wondering about the security footage. Do you guys keep... Hello? Hello? VOICE: Stay. Stop it! Just stop it! Thank you. Come on. Come on, come on. I'm sorry, Gary. But there... there are some things... I just can't accept, that I just can't live with. There you go. You stay safe, my darling. Safe. He isn't telling you everything, and when he does, it will sound crazy. I may have gone a little crazy myself to believe it. You need to tell them everything. You need to tell them. They have a right to know. It isn't safe to keep it from them. Whatever you decide, my dear, decide it with all your heart. Anabelle... Michael! VOICE: Brandon, I'm so sorry. Shit. What are you doing? Oh, my God. What is this place? I thought there might be a manual switch or some way I could restart the server in here. I don't know how he's doing this. - Anabelle is leaving. - Right now? Yeah, and she was talking about something Gary is not telling us that sounds very important. So you need to come. Is her niece here? I don't know. I came to find you. - Shit. - I know, right? Where's Gary? I don't know. I lost him. He was there one moment and then he was gone. I might have a concussion. I'm seeing things. - Well, is Anabelle gone? - I don't know. What do you mean, you might have a concussion? (CRASH) Michael? (BELL RINGS) I'll get it, Hi. Hey, um, is Aunt Anabelle ready? Yeah. Um... I'm Brandon. Christine. Nice to meet you. So what happened here last night? We should go inside. Okay. What grade are you in? (DOOR CLOSES) Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. Is Anabelle ready? I saw her bags outside. - Are you Christine? - Yeah. We thought that she was already with you. With? But I... I just... I just got here. Did you guys see this? Seen what? It looks like you guys got TP'd or something. I hate to tell you this, but they let the air out of your tires, too. Oh, my God. I changed my mind. Let's find Anabelle and go in Christine's car. I'll come back with the authorities for Dad once I get you guys into town. My car? What's going on? I really gotta get going. Look, right now we just really need to find your aunt. Michael, where do you think she could have even gone? - What is it? - Go inside. Michael, what is it? What happened? Is it my aunt? Is she all right? No. No, no, no. You don't wanna know. Oh, God. (SCREAMING) Oh, no! Help! Help! Get out of the way. No, no. Brandon, come on! She's dead! Let's go! Michael, help him! Brandon! Boo. Not so perfect now, are you? This is just like when he went ape shit on us at home. It's a game with him. He's gonna draw us out. - What do we do? - I don't know. He's fuckin' playing with us. I don't get it. How is he here? It was him at the tree house. I think I saw him when the car broke down. I saw Mom, too. Where? Is he gone? No. - (STATIC) - VOICE: Never again. - There you are. - Get out! Who the hell is on my property? William. Chloe's husband. My dad. But how did he get through my wards? That stuff isn't real, Dad. Neither are ghosts, I guess you'd say. I seem to recall my precautions saving your ass out there. (GROANS) - Hey. - Juliette. Hey. Hey. I can barely move my arm, and my head is... You just hit your head, that's all. Let's get to the panic room. Come on, honey, let's go. You're saying Chloe's been trapped here this whole time. You called me insane. The next words out of my mouth were not going to be, "Your dear departed sister is living with me." And while I'm truly sorry, I'm glad, too, because... I'm losing my mind, you see? It's going. Faster than I'd like to admit. Pieces at a time. But now I know that after I die... no, after we die... we'll all come back together. Here! That's impossible. Michael, please tell me that you are not believing this. I didn't take it completely seriously all those years ago. Truth be known, I was just an angry drunk with too much time on my hands. But our family has a very unique lore. I pulled this from the book The Pack Eternal. You used to say that all the time. It's part of an ancient ritual. Once done, we shall be gathered unto one place, never to be cast asunder. United in death as in life, and by hallowed ground of the ritual. I've been working on the "hallowed ground" part. All this shit, as you call it, is meant to make this place safe for us. Not now. Later. I have a trust that's been set. It will maintain this compound until the end of time. And when I cross over, it will be me and Chloe, and then one day you will join us. I've seen them. Both of them. Me, too. You cursed us. The scar? It binds us to the place of the ritual at death. Mom is here stuck... and Dad is out there. That's the mystery. (BEEPING) We got him. It's a thermal reading. He's got a heat signature. He's working on my last level of exterior protection. What happens then? This is all we've got, and I don't know how long it'll last. We've gotta go on the offensive. We can't kill what's been killed. We must banish him. I can't do this, Dad. I can't watch anyone else die. Well, at least Anabelle's away and safe. Where's Brandon? Brandon! Oh, Jesus, Brandon, stop! Get it off of me! Just get it off of me! - Who did this to you? - (GROANS) My mom! Who else did she mark, Brandon? Dad! She marked my dad. So what happens whenever he kills us or what happens when we die, are we gonna be stuck here with him forever? Dad, when did you first start noticing activity outside? When you got here. Didn't you say that the people who were marked would be drawn together? Yes, drawn to where the ritual was performed and to the other members of the bond! My mom did this at home. She did this when I was little at the apartment. Hers was performed here. Brandon was living with us while Chloe was here. William was pulled in every different direction. He couldn't fully manifest. Yeah, but now you guys are all in one place. The balance has shifted. He's getting stronger. He followed us. Is it reversible? The book talks of a way, but... The book. Oh, stay here. Shit. We got cut off when I called. They have to send someone. - (CAR DOORS CLOSE) - How you doin' today? Yeah, we got a call from dispatch. They said there was a disturbance here. - Is everything all right? - Uh... We're having some trouble with the equipment inside. Do you guys want to come in and take a look at it? What is... Is that blood? There's hair. Sir, stay right there. Is that blood? What is that? Just stay where you are, sir. Just don't move. Jack! Jack, call it in! Is that a body? What's over there? Jack, call it in! Call it in! Don't move! Don't you move. - Jack, call it in. - What happened? Get over there! Take it easy. What happened? A lot of weird shit. It is hard to explain. You will never believe it, okay? The... The door. Hey. Hey, he's right behind you. He's right there! - Just come in, please. - He's right there! He's right there. He's right behind you. Oh, my God. Don't! Don't you move! Michael, come inside! Get back in here! - Calm down. - What the hell's going on here? What is going on here? (DING) Get up, Michael! Come on, get up! - Get in the house! - Michael, come on! Throw me the book! Hey, kiddo. (SCREAMING) Sorry. I'm sorry. Did I get him? Yeah, you got him. So why can't I see him? You don't have the mark. The only way you would see him is in these monitors. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This translation's missing, the one about the scars. Dad, where are these pages? - I don't... - (STATIC) Hey, don't go foggy on me now. This is the most important thing. I didn't lose them. Somebody took them. I've seen those before. These? Where? (STATIC) (RECORD SCRATCHING) (RECORD WINDS DOWN) It's Mom. It's a ritual. We need to make a circle. That circle's on the floor of the panic room. That's too close quarters for this. Help me. Okay, but that's in here, and he's out there. Not for long. If this doesn't work, this room is your last holdout. No, Michael, wait. I don't like this idea. I don't want to separate. I should be with you. Your only eyes and ears are in here. And besides, you don't have the scar. If all hell breaks loose, maybe he'll leave you alone 'cause you're not part of the family. Hey. It may be the only thing that saves you. Brandon, you ready? Not really, but I'm in. Juliette, you holler when you see him break through. Come on, kiddo. It's really quiet. Where the hell is he? Wait, was that him? I don't know. Shit. Get ready. (BELL DINGS) (SCREAMING) You can't go out there blind. Then don't let me. Michael! (GUNSHOT) Where the hell did he go? Where is he? Behind you! Michael, here! Now and forever I banish you from this bond! Alone you shall wander, bound by this curse. Broken from the circle, I shall see you nevermore. Michael. You did good. You put your family first. That's all I ever asked. All I ever wanted to do. I'm proud of you. ♪ She can stop now ♪ ♪ She ♪ ♪ Will follow ♪ (LAUGHTER) ♪ (ROCK) ♪ Aristotle! This is Wasp Delta. Do you hear me? Stay with me, Kai! Stay with me, please! Ripped By mstoll Aristotle! We have been hit! Major damage! Aristotle! Aristotle! The enemy are right on top of us! (SCREAMING) I'm sorry! DALEK: Exterminate! (SCREAMING) (GASPING) You'll probably feel a bit sick. Please, don't be. Where's my brother? Hello, I'm the Doctor. He was right beside me. Where's Kai? How did I get here? DOCTOR: I materialised a time capsule exactly around you and saved your life one second before your ship exploded, but do please keep crying. My brother just died! His sister didn't. You're very welcome. - Put the gun down. -Or what? Or you might shoot me. Then where will you be? In charge of your vessel. You'd starve to death trying to find the light switch. Who are you? I'm Lieutenant Journey Blue of the Combined Galactic Resistance. I demand you take me back to my command ship, the Aristotle, which is currently located... No. Hey, not like that. You will take me back to my command ship, - which is currently positioned... - No, no. Come on, not like that. Not like that. Get it right! Will you take me back to my ship? Please? The Aristotle's the big fella parked in the asteroid belt, yeah? It's shielded. More or less. (WHOOSHING) DOCTOR: Dry your eyes, journey Blue. Crying's for civilians. It's how we communicate with you lot. But it's smaller on the outside. No, it's a bit more exciting when you go the other way. This isn't a battleship. Medical insignia. It's a hospital. We don't need hospitals now. The Daleks don't leave any wounded. And we don't take any prisoners. I saved your little friend here, if that's in anyway relevant to mention. That's true, sir. He did. - Thank you. -You're welcome. - I wish I could've done more. -Then you should have. - Okay. -But you did save journey and for that I am personally grateful. - Well... -However, the security of this base is absolute. So we're still going to kill you. Oh, it's a rollercoaster with you, isn't it? Shoot him, bag him and throw him outside. No! Stop! I'm sorry! He might be a duplicate. He's a doctor. And we have a patient. Don't we, Uncle? Why does a hospital need a doctor? The Aristotle wasn't always hidden. The Daleks got here before us. You don't like soldiers much, do you? You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns. Wow! A moleculon nanoscaler! You know what it does, then? It miniaturises living matter. What's the medical application, though? Do you use it to shrink the surgeons -so they can climb inside the patients? -Exactly. Fantastic idea for a movie. Terrible idea for a proctologist. Are you going to miniaturise me? You're a doctor, aren't you? And this is your patient. No, you don't understand. You can't put me in there! DALEK: Doctor? (DOCTOR WHO THEME) Attention! Look at you lot! I've never seen such a miserable bunch! What are you? Children? Yes, sir. - You think you're funny, Fleming? - Yes, sir. (BELL RINGING, LAUGHTER) All right, me too. Dismissed! BOY: What are you doing, Fleming? So, Mr Pink, did you have a good weekend? Yeah, I did, thanks. Yes, I'll bet you did. What did you get up to? Urn... You know. A bit of reading. Oh, I bet you were reading. - I was, yeah. - Yeah, I bet you were. Well, yea h, I was. I know your type. She wishes. Be quiet, you. So that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. - Any questions? - Sir? Have you ever killed a man? (STUDENTS GROANING) I was a soldier. There were other soldiers and some of them weren't on our side. I shall leave the rest to your imagination. And, please, think of another question. Okay. Have you ever killed anyone who wasn't a soldier? Just to repeat, that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Is everyone clear? ALL: Yes, sir. Fine, I'll take that class and then you can do some of the testing. I know. Oh, Clara, urn, you've not met Danny Pink yet, huh? New fella, maths. Danny? Clara Oswald. - Hey. -English. - Hey, nice to meet you. -You, too. ARMITAGE: Want to watch yourself around him. Bit of a lady-killer but always denies it. - I am not a lady-killer. -See what I mean? - Oh, Beth, can I have a word? -BETH: Yeah, yeah, sure. Uh... Was it you that I saw outside doing the soldiery thing? Ah, yeah, probably. The Coal Hill Cadets. Just a bit of fun. What, teaching them how to shoot people? There's a bit more to modern soldiering than just shooting people. I like to think there's a moral dimension. Ah, you shoot people and then you cry about it afterwards? Ah. Something wrong? -Nothing, no. Sorry, no, nothing. I just... I didn't think they'd say anything, that's all. - Sorry? -Have they told everyone? No, no, no. As far as I know, nobody has told anybody anything. What... What are you talking about? Why did you just say the crying thing? - I was being funny. -Why? I just do that. - Why? -I don't know. Anyway, I, um... - I've left some stuff in my class... -Okay. - Um... -See you. See you. Uh, are you going to the, um, leaving thing tonight for Cathy? Um... Yeah! I wasn't going but I am now, because you're going to be there and suddenly it seems like the best idea ever. (EXHALES) No, I'm not. Oh, okay. Never mind. Goodnight. Change your mind! - Excuse me? -I'm going. Uh, I'll give you a lift. Why not? Actually, now that you mention it, seems like the best plan ever. Thank you. No, I've got some reading. Oh, okay. Maybe some other time, then. Thank you! (CLEARS THROAT) (BANGING CONTINUES) ls the wooden sound you or the desk? - How long have you been there? -Longer than you would like. Okay. Are you going to look that terrified when you take me out for a drink? I... I ab... Absolutely promise I won't. Play your cards right and you might. (LAUGHING) Where the hell have you been? You sent me for coffee. Three weeks ago. In Glasgow. Three weeks, that's a long time. In Glasgow! That's dead in a ditch! It's not my fault, I got distracted. By what? You can always find something. Come on! - Why were you smiling? -Was I? No, I wasn't! You were smiling at nothing. I'd almost say you were in love, -but to be honest... -Honest? - You're not a young woman any more. -Yes, I am! - Well, you don't look it. -I do look it! Oh, that's right. Keep your spirits up. Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. I need something from you. I need the truth. Okay. Right, what is it? - What's... -(EXHALES) You're scared. I'm terrified. Of what? The answer to my next question, which must be honest, cold and considered, without kindness or restraint. Clara, be my pal and tell me... am I a good man? I...don't know. Neither do I. Uh, hey, no offence, but I've got plans. I need you. (SIGHING) Right! - Where are we going? -(ENGINE POWERING UP) Into darkness. DALEK: Doctor! - How do you know who I am? -He doesn't. We promised him medical assistance. Are you my doctor? We found it floating in space. We thought it was deactivated so we tried to disassemble it. You didn't realise there was a living creature inside? Not till it started screaming. Help me. Why would I do that? Why would any living creature help you? Daleks will die! Die all you like. Not my problem. Daleks must be destroyed! (MIMICKING) Daleks must be de... What did you just say? All Daleks must die! I will destroy the Daleks! Destroy the Daleks! Destroy the Daleks! A good Dalek? There's no such thing. That's a bit inflexible, not like you. I'd almost say prejudiced. Do I pay you? I should give you a raise. You're not my boss, you're one of my hobbies. Come on. That was quick! This is gun girl. She's got a gun and she's a girl. This is a sort of boss one. Are you the same one as before? - Yes. -I think he's probably her uncle but I may have made that up to pass the time while they were talking. This is Clara, not my assistant, she's, uh, some other word. - I'm his carer. -Yeah, my carer. She cares so I don't have to. DALEK: Doctor! Hello again. Will you help me? Will you? A Dalek so damaged, it's turned good. Morality as malfunction. How do I resist? Daleks must die. Daleks must die. So, what do we do with a moral Dalek, then? - We get into its head. -Hmm. - How do you get into a Dalek's head? -That wasn't a metaphor. These are nano controllers. Once we're miniaturised, they take over the molecular compression. When the mission's over, hit the button. (BEEPS) Are you sure you understand? Why wouldn't I? Because this is a dangerous mission and you look like a schoolteacher. I am a schoolteacher. Still didn't catch your name. - Journey Blue. -Blue? Blue, yes, problem? (CHUCKLES) No, uh... I just met a soldier called Pink. Lucky fella. Lucky? From the way you smile. So, uh, who makes you smile or is nobody up to the job? My brother, but he burnt to death a couple of hours ago, so he's really letting me down today. Excuse me. What are those ones for? I don't need armed babysitters! We're not babysitters. We're hereto shoot you dead if you turn out to be a Dalek spy. Well, that's a relief. I hate babysitters. Okay, listen up. Now, remember, do not hold your breath when the nanoscaler engages. You'll feel like you want to, but you must keep breathing normally during the miniaturisation process. - Why? -Ever microwaved a lasagne without pricking the film on top? It explodes? Don't be lasagna. Nanoscaler engaging in five, four, three, two... Nanoscaler engaging...now! (ENGINE POWERING UP) COMPUTER: Nanoscaling in progress. (ENGINE POWERING DOWN) COMPUTER: Nanoscaling complete. Nanoscaling successful. Everyone okay in there? We made it. Nobody popped. Whoa. (CHUCKLES) I can't believe this! No, neither can I. (THUDDING) We'll be following you all the way, Rescue One. - COMPUTER: Integration complete. - Good luck, all of you. COMPUTER: Dalek levels steady. CLARA: That was, uh, weird. DOCTOR: You've seen nothing yet. CLARA: What are the lights? DOCTOR: Visual impulses travelling towards the brain. CLARA: Beautiful. DOCTOR: Welcome to the most dangerous place in the universe. JOURNEY: Entering the cranial ledge now. Here! CLARA: Oh, my God! DOCTOR: Behold the belly of the beast. CLARA: It's amazing. It's huge. No, Ross. We're tiny. So how big is it, that living part compared to me and you right now? DOCTOR: You see all those cables? - Yeah? -They're not all cables. Does it know we're here? It's what invited us in. New, this is the cortex vault, a supplementary electronic brain. Memory banks. But more than that. This is what keeps the Dalek pure. How are Daleks pure? Dalek mutants are born hating. This is what stokes the fire, extinguishes even the tiniest glimmer of... of kindness, compassion. Imagine the worst possible thing in the universe and then don't bother because you're looking at it right now. This is evil refined as engineering. DALEK: Doctor? Oh, hello, Rusty! You don't mind if I call you Rusty? We're going to need to come down there with you. Medical examination and all that. What? With all those tentacles and things? How close do we have to get? Well, you know, we're never going to insert a thermometer from up here. (MACHINE LOADING) No. No, no, no, no! Stop! Stop! Stop, you idiot! We need to find a way down and the only way... This is a Dalek, not a machine! It's a perfect analogue of a living being and you just hurt it! So what's going to happen now? Oh, God! What? What is it? Antibodies? Dalek antibodies! Nobody move! Any attempt to help him or attack, those things will identify you as a secondary source of infection. Stay still! (BUZZING) But the Dalek wants us in here. Why is it attacking? Can you control your antibodies? Ross, stay calm. We're going to get you out of this. Can you? Ross, swallow that! - What is it? -Trust me. Now what? (SCREAMING) Ross! Oh, my God! What's it doing? The hoovering. - Gotcha! -What did you give him? Oh, it's just a spare power cell but I can track the radiation signature. I need to know where they dump the bodies. I thought you were saving him! DOCTOR: He was dead already! I was saving us! - Follow me and run! -Run! They've dumped him in here. Organic refuse disposal. - We need to get in there. -Why? Those antibodies won't give up until we're inside! I'd rather go in alive than dead. You don't know where it goes! Yes, I do! Away from here! Now, in! In! In! (CLARA YELPING, SCREAMING) - I can hold them oh? -No, you can't! Pull back! Down! jump, everyone,jump! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) Ugh! What is this stuff? (PANTING) People. The Daleks need protein. Occasionally, they harvest from their victims. This is a feeding tube. Is Ross here? Yeah, top layer, if you want to say a few words. A man has just died. You will not talk like that! A lot of people have died. Everything in here is dead and you know why that's good? There is nothing good about that! Nothing is alive in here, so logically, this is the weakest spot in the Dalek's internal security. Nobody guards the dead! Mortuaries and larders. Always the easiest to break out of. I've lived a life! Tell Uncle Stupid that we're in. A-ha! A bolt-hole! (RUMBLING) He'll get us out of here. The difficult part is not killing him before he can. Bolt-hole. Actually a hole for a bolt. Does nobody get that? Also, there's the puns. DOCTOR: Watch it, decontamination tubes are hot. COMPUTER: Anomaly threat displaced. Dalek levels returning to normal parameters. JOURNEY: Rescue One to Mission Control. This is Blue, Rescue One. Report. The Dalek has an internal defence mechanism. We've lost Ross. What kind of defence mechanism? That thing knows you're in there to help it. Yeah, well, who knows? It's a Dalek. We're going to continue the mission. Are you all right back there? It's a bit narrow, isn't it? Any remarks about my hips will not be appreciated. DOCTOR: Oh, your hips are fine, you're built like a man. Thanks. What's that noise? Are you wearing a Geiger counter? Standard battle equipment. That's just low-level radiation. It's stronger down here, for some reason. Give me it. MORGAN: Was that him? How's he working out? - It's hard to say. He's... - DOCTOR: I've got it! - I know what's wrong with Rusty. - Okay, that's good. - Is that good? - Well, you know how I said this was the most dangerous place in the universe? I was wrong. It's way more dangerous than that. JOURNEY: Colonel, we have radiation indicators red-lining in here. Could be that the Dalek is more badly damaged than we thought. MORGAN: Copy that. DOCTOR: Old Rusty here is suffering a trionic radiation leak. It's poisoning the Dalek and us. Just as well we're here. JOURNEY: Really? Perhaps we should get out while we can. Why should we trust a Dalek? Why would it change? DOCTOR: Good question. Rusty? What changed you? RUSTY: I saw beauty. DOCTOR: You saw what? RUSTY: In the silence and the cold. I saw worlds burning. JOURNEY: That's not beauty. That's destruction. RUSTY: I saw more. What? What did you see? RUSTY: The birth of a star. Stars are born every day. You've seen a million stars born, so what? RUSTY: Daleks have destroyed a million stars. DOCTORR: Oh, millions and millions. Trust me, I keep count. RUSTY: And yet, new stars are born. Every time. RUSTY: Resistance is futile. Resistance to what? RUSTY: Life returns. Life prevails. Resistance is futile. So you saw a star being born and you learned something. Oh, Dalek, do not be lying to me. Come on! JOURNEY: Heading for the trionic power cells, Colonel. MORGAN: Radiation approxing 200 rads. Danger levels. COMPUTER: Radiation levels increasing. - We're at the heart of the Dalek. -Oh, it's incredible! (ELECTRICITY SURGING) JOURNEY: Geiger counter's off the scale. Looks like it's about to blow. - DOCTOR: Good. - How is that good? Well, I like a bit of pressure. Oh! - Rusty? Can you hear me? - RUSTY: Doctor? DOCTOR: Rusty, we've found the damage. I'm sealing up the breach in your power cell. No more radiation poisoning. Good as new. (PANTING) There.job done. That's it? just like that? An anti-climax once in a while is good for my heart. Rusty? How do you feel? Rusty? Rusty? Rusty... RUSTY: The malfunction is corrected. - What happened? -I'm not entirely sure. (POWERING up) It's like he's waking up. DOCTOR: Rusty, come on, talk to me. What's going on? RUSTY: The malfunction is corrected. All systems are functioning. (BEEPING) Weapons charged. Oh, no, no, no... RUSTY: Exterminate! Exterminate! (BEEPING) - No, no, no! - Exterminate! Exterminate! - The Daleks will be victorious! - DOCTOR: No! The rebels will be exterminated! Colonel? What's happening out there? Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Pull back, pullback! Dalek fleet! Communications open! DALEK 1: The rebel ship has been identified! Prepare porting Daleks! Doctor, what happened? Do you see? Do I see what? Daleks don't turn good. It was just radiation affecting its brain chemistry, nothing more than that. No miracle. Let me get this straight. We had a good Dalek and we made it bad again? That's all we've done? There was never a good Dalek. There was a broken Dalek and we repaired it. You were supposed to be helping us. I gave it a shot. It didn't work out. It was a Dalek, what did you expect? No more talking, you are done! Okay, new objective. We are taking this Dalek down. Exterminate! Exterminate! What's that look for? That's the look you get when I'm about to slap you! Oh! Clara! We're going to die in here. And there's a little bit of you that's pleased. The Daleks are evil after all. Everything makes sense. The Doctor is right! Daleks are evil, irreversibly so. That's what we just learned! No, Doctor. That is not what we just learned. RUSTY: Exterminate! Exterminate! MORGAN: Secure the door! Wasp fighters to action stations! MAN: The security systems have been hacked. We don't have access to the Wasps. Then God save us all. JOURNEY: We need to place these charges for maximum effect. I'm going to scan the rest of the architecture for weaknesses. - One question. - JOURNEY: No time. CLARA: Why did we come here today? What was the point? You. You thought there was a good Dalek. What difference would one good Dalek make? All the difference in the universe but it's impossible. Is that a fact? Is that really what we've learned today? Think about it! Is that what we learned? Journey, what the hell's happening? That thing's set the Daleks on us and it's locked us out of our defences. Journey, you're the Aristotle's only hope. I need you to destroy that Dalek. The rebels will be exterminated! Whatever it takes. Understood, Uncle. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me, too. Clara Oswald, do I really not pay you? You couldn't afford me. (RUMBLING) Whatever you're going to do, don't do it! This Dalek must not be destroyed, we can do better! Are you out of your mind? No, I'm inside a Dalek! I'm standing where I've never been. We cannot waste this chance. It won't come again. What chance? ! have my orders! - Soldiers take orders. -And I'm a soldier. A Dalek is a better soldier than you will ever be. You can't win this way. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (YELLS) So what do we do? Something better. DALEK: Prepare to board the rebel ship! We must find our comrade Dalek! Spare no humans! Exterminate them all! DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! (GRUNTING) The Dalek isn't just some angry blob in a Dalekanium tank. If it was, the radiation would have turned it into a raging lunatic. Uh, it is a raging lunatic. It's a Dalek. But for a moment, it wasn't. The radiation allowed it to expand its consciousness, to consider things beyond its natural terms of reference. It became good. That means a good Dalek is possible. That's what we learned today. Am I right, teach? CLARA: Top of the class. JOURNEY: But now it's back to how it was. But what it saw, what it felt, is still there. Yeah, I'm not really seeing that. Not here. There! - JOURNEY: You mean in the cortex vault? - The evil engineering? DOCTOR: Every memory recorded. Some suppressed but all still intact. We need to show the Dalek that star being born again. Recreate that moment. You need to get up there, find that moment and reawaken it. - Me? -Yes, you. Good idea. How? Haven't the foggiest. Do a clever thing. And then once you've done it, the Dalek will be suggestible to new ideas. It will be open again. And I will show it something that will change its mind forever! - What? -Not a clue. DALEK: Docking initiated, pressure equalised! Boarding corp, begin attack! Advance! Exterminate the humans! Seek, locate, destroy! Surrender is not accepted! This is crazy. There is no way that we can get back up there in time! GRETCHEN: Yes, there is. JOURNEY: No, Gretchen. It'll bring the antibodies back down on us. Tell me the truth. ls he mad or is he right? I've come this far. I'm probably going to die anyway. Wouldn't mind something to do for the rest of me life. Is he mad or is he right? Hand on my heart, most days he's both. One question, then. Is this worth it? If I can turn one Dalek, I can turn them all. I can save the future. Gretchen Alison Carlisle. Do something good and name it after me. I will do something amazing, I promise. Damn well better. - (MACHINE LOADING) - JOURNEY: No, Gretchen! (FIRING) Go! They're coming. They're coming! JOURNEY: Grab hold of the rope. - Don't look down. - GRETCHEN: Good luck! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) Hello. I'm Missy. Welcome to heaven. Would you like some tea? Little splosh? Lovely. MORGAN: Fire! DALEK: Exterminate! Advance! Seek, locate, destroy! DALEK 2: Exterminate! DALEK: Advance! Seek, locate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Oh, Rusty! Here we are. Eye to eye! RUSTY: You cannot save the humans. They will be exterminated. I shall join the Dalek units in the final attack! - So what do we do? -Ah... A clever thing, quickly. Think, think, think, think think. Some of the lights are out. Yeah, we got a damaged Dalek, you want to complain to someone? - But it's not damaged. Look at them. -So? So the Doctor said that this was a memory bank and some of the memories were suppressed. What if... What if the dark spots are hidden memories? What if one of those is the Dalek seeing a star? Seriously? -Yeah. Well, maybe. It's either that or the bulbs need changing. It really could be the bulbs. Got a better idea? - Really wish I had. -Yep. Me, too. A-ha. Watch out for antibodies. Let's see if there's an on switch. I saved your life, Rusty. Now I'm going to go one better. I'm going to save your soul. RUSTY: Daleks do not have souls. Oh, no? Well, imagine if you did. What then, Rusty? What would happen then? I'm in the cortex! If there's a pack of spare bulbs, break it to me gently. Ah! Your memories! I'm about to give some back to you. Are you okay? Clara! Yeah. I think there was some sort of energy charge. You got the first lights on. Of course, it's a brain. Brains work with electrical pathways linking up memories! It's working! It's working, we're turning the memories back on! See, all those years ago, when I began, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. And then I went to Skaro. And then I met you lot and I understood who I was! (GRUNTS) The Doctor was not the Daleks! (FIRING) Exterminate! Fall back! All of you, fallback! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! You'd better get a move on. There's company coming! Exterminate! - Exterminate! - MORGAN: Fall back, fall back! Exterminate! Exterminate! Hurry up! Show me a star, Rusty! - (ELECTRICITY SURGING) - Oh! Oh, look. It's your memories again. It's like somebody's mucking about up there. Memories, all those memories. Do you remember the star you saw being born? Almost done! - One more to go. -Hurry up, Clara! Hurry up! (GRUNTS) Clara, you did it! It's rebooting. The antibodies have reset! (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) RUSTY: I... I remember. DOCTOR: You saw the truth, Rusty. Remember how you felt! You saw a star being born! The endless rebirth of the universe! - No! -And you realised the truth about the Daleks! RUSTY: Truth? What is the truth? Let me show you the truth! I've opened your mind and now I'm coming in. That door is never going to hold. But I'm damned if I'm going to make it easy for them! (SCREAMING) I'm part of you. My mind is in your mind. RUSTY: I see your mind, Doctor. I see your universe. And isn't the universe beautiful? RUSTY: I see beauty. Yes, that's good. That is good. Hold on to that. RUSTY: I see endless divine perfection. Make it a part of you. Remember how you feel right now. Put it inside you and live by it. RUSTY: I see into your soul, Doctor. I see beauty. I see divinity. I see hatred. DOCTOR: Hatred? I See your hatred of the Daleks and it is good! No, no, no. No, you must see more than that, there must be more than that! RUSTY: Death to the Daleks. Death to the Daleks! Death to the Daleks! DOCTOR: No, there must be more than that. There must be more than that! Please! RUSTY: Daleks are evil! Daleks must be exterminated! Daleks are evil. God save us all! RUSTY: Daleks must be exterminated! Exterminate! DALEK: Under attack from a Dalek! (DALEK SCREAMING) RUSTY: The Daleks are exterminated! Of course they are. That's what you do, isn't it? - Journey! - Uncle Morgan. I have transmitted a retreat signal. The Daleks will believe the humans have initiated the ship's self-destruct. What about you, Rusty? I must go with them. Of course you must. You've unfinished work, haven't you? Victory is yours. But it does not please you. You looked inside me and you saw hatred. That's not victory. Victory would have been a good Dalek. I am not a good Dalek. You are a good Dalek. DOCTOR: Till the next time. Is he leaving? Isn't he going to say goodbye? I think that was it. Yep, that was it. Sorry, gotta run! I'm sorry. Sorry? Doctor! Take me with you. I think you're probably nice. Underneath it all, I think you're kind and definitely brave. I just wish you hadn't been a soldier. How do I look? Sort of short and roundish but with a good personality, which is the main thing. I meant my clothes. I just changed. Oh, good for you. Still making an effort. Okay, right. You're back in your cupboard 30 seconds after you left. When will I see you again? Oh, soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. I don't know. I'm sorry? You asked me if you're a good man and the answer is I don't know. But I think you try to be and I think that's probably the point. I think you're probably an amazing teacher. (CHUCKLES) I think I'd better be. - Ah, hey. -Hey! Danny. Have you changed your clothes? Yes. Yes, I... I have. Well noticed. - Okay, good. - Yes, good. Very good. Good work. You've passed the test. Are you really going to go for a drink with me? Yeah, course I am. Why wouldn't I? - I just thought... -Thought what? I thought you might have a... a rule against soldiers. No. No, not at all. Not me. CLARA: There is someone that I always wanted to meet. It's Robin Hood! DOCTOR: No damsels in distress! MAN: Seize him! DOCTOR: No pretty castles. No such thing as Robin Hood. Ripped By mstoll Aristotle! This is Wasp Delta, do you hear me? ! Stay with me, Kai! Stay with me, please! Aristotle! We have been hit! Major damage! Aristotle! Aristotle! The enemy are right on top of us! I'm sorry! Exterminate! You'll probably feel a bit sick. Please, don't be. Where's my brother? ! Hello, I'm the Doctor. He was right beside me. Where's Kai? How did I get here? I materialised a time capsule exactly round you and saved your life one second before your ship exploded, but do please keep crying. My brother just died! His sister didn't. You're very welcome. Put the gun down. Or what? Or you might shoot me! Then where will you be? In charge of your vessel. You'd starve to death trying to find the light switch. Who are you? I'm Lieutenant Journey Blue of the Combined Galactic Resistance. I demand you take me back to my command ship, the Aristotle, which is currently located... No. Hey, not like that. You will take me back to my command ship, which is currently positioned... No, no. Come on, not like that. Not like that! Get it right! Will you take me back to my ship? Please? The Aristotle's the big fella parked in the asteroid belt, yeah? It's shielded. More or less. Dry your eyes, Journey Blue. Crying's for civilians. It's how we communicate with you lot. It's smaller on the outside. It's more exciting when you go the other way. This isn't a battleship. Medical insignia - it's a hospital. We don't need hospitals now. The Daleks don't leave any wounded. And we don't take any prisoners. I saved your little friend here, if that's in any way relevant to mention. That's true, sir. He did. Thank you. You're welcome. I wish I could've done more. Then you should have. OK. But...you did save Journey and, for that, I am personally grateful. Well... However, the security of this base is absolute. So we're still going to kill you. Oh, it's a roller coaster with you, isn't it? Shoot him, bag him and throw him outside. No! Stop! I'm sorry! He might be a duplicate. He's a doctor! And we have a patient. Don't we, Uncle? Why does a hospital need a doctor? The Aristotle wasn't always hidden. The Daleks got here before us. You don't like soldiers much, do you? You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns. Wow! A moleculon nanoscaler! You know what it does, then? It miniaturises living matter. What's the medical application, though? Do you use it to shrink the surgeons so they can climb inside the patients? Exactly. Fantastic idea for a movie. Terrible idea for a proctologist. Are you going to miniaturise me? You're a doctor, aren't you? And this is your patient. No, you don't understand. You can't put ME in there! Doc...tor? ! Atten-shun! Look at you lot! I've never seen such a miserable bunch! What are you - children? Yes, sir. You think you're funny, Fleming? Yes, sir. All right, me too. Dismissed! What you doing, Fleming? So, Mr Pink, did you have a good weekend? Yeah, I did, thanks. Yes, I'll bet you did. What did you get up to? Um...you know. A bit of reading. Oh, I bet you were reading. Er, I was, yeah. Yeah, I bet you were! Well, yeah, I was. I know your type. She wishes! Be quiet, you! So that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Any questions? Sir? Have you ever killed a man? I was a soldier. There were other soldiers and some of them weren't on our side. I shall leave the rest to your imagination. And, please, think of another question? OK. Have you ever killed anyone who WASN'T a soldier? Just to repeat, that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Is everyone clear? Yes, sir. Fine, I'll take that class and then, they can do some of the test. I know. Oh, Clara, um, you've not met Danny Pink yet? New fella, maths. Danny? Clara Oswald... Hey... English. Hey, nice to meet you. You too. Watch yourself around him. Bit of a lady-killer, but always denies it. I am not a lady-killer. See what I mean? Oh, Beth, can I have a word? Yeah, yeah, sure. Er...was it you that I saw outside doing the soldiery thing? Oh, yeah, probably The Coal Hill Cadets. Just a bit of fun. What, teaching them how to shoot people? There's a bit more to modern soldiering than just shooting people. I like to think there's a moral dimension. Oh? You shoot people then cry about it afterwards? Ah. Something wrong? Nothing, no. Sorry, no, nothing. I just... I didn't think they'd say anything, that's all. Sorry? Have they told everyone? No, no, no, as far as I know, nobody has told anybody anything. What are you talking about? Why did you just say the crying thing? I was being funny. Why? I just do that. Why? I dunno! Anyway... I, erm... I've left some stuff in my class... OK, see you. See you. Er, are you going to the, um, leaving thing tonight for Cathy? Um... Yeah! I wasn't going, but I am now, because you're going to be there, and, suddenly, it seems like the best idea ever. No, I'm not. Oh, OK, never mind. Good night. Change your mind! Excuse me? I'm going. Er, I'll give you a lift. Why not? Um, actually, now that you mention it, seems like the best plan ever. Thank you. No, I've got some reading. Ah, OK. Maybe some other time, then? Thank you! Ahem... Is the wooden sound you or...or the desk? How long have you been there? Longer than you would like. OK. Will you look that terrified when you take me out for a drink? I... I absolutely promise I won't. Play your cards right and you might! Where the hell have you been? You sent me for coffee. Three weeks ago. In Glasgow. Three weeks, that's a long time. In Glasgow! That's dead in a ditch! It's not my fault, I got distracted. By what? You can always find something. Come on! Why were you smiling? Was I? No, I wasn't! You were smiling at nothing. I'd almost say you were in love, but to be honest... Honest? You're not a young woman any more. Yes, I am! Well, you don't look it. I DO look it! Oh, that's right. Keep your spirits up, Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. I need something from you. I need the truth. OK. Right, what is it? What's...? You're scared. I'm terrified. Of what? The answer to my next question, which must be honest and cold and considered, without kindness or restraint. Clara, be my pal...and tell me... ..am I a good man? I...don't know. Neither do I. Er, hey, no offence, but I've got plans. I need you. Right! Where are we going? Into darkness. Doc...tor! How do you know who I am? He doesn't. We promised him medical assistance. Are you my doctor? We found it floating in space. We thought it was deactivated. So we tried to disassemble it. You didn't realise there was a living creature inside? Not till it started screaming. Help...me. Why would I do that? Why would any living creature help YOU? Daleks will die! Die all you like. Not my problem. Daleks must be destroyed! "Daleks must be de..."! What did you just say? All Daleks must die! I will destroy the Daleks! Destroy the Daleks! A good Dalek? There's no such thing. That's a bit inflexible, not like you. I'd almost say prejudiced. Do I pay you? I should give you a raise. You're not my boss, you're one of my hobbies. Come on. That was quick! This is gun girl. She's got a gun, and she's a girl. This is a sort of boss one. The same one as before? Yes. He's probably her uncle, but I may have made that up to pass the time. This is Clara, not my assistant, she's, er, some other word. I'm his carer. Yeah, my carer. She cares so I don't have to. Doc...tor! Hello again. Will you...help me? Will you? A Dalek so damaged, it's turned good. Morality as malfunction. How do I resist? Daleks must die. Daleks must die. So, what do we do with a moral Dalek, then? We get into its head? Mmm. How do you get into a Dalek's head? That wasn't a metaphor. These are nanocontrollers. Once we're miniaturised, they take over the molecular compression. When the mission's over, hit the button. Are you sure you understand? Why wouldn't I? Because this is a dangerous mission and you look like a school teacher. I AM a school teacher. Still didn't catch your name. Journey Blue. Blue? Blue, yes, problem? No, er... I just met a soldier called Pink. Lucky fella. Lucky? From the way you smile. So, er, who makes you smile or is nobody up to the job? My brother, but he burned to death a couple of hours ago, so he's really letting me down today. Excuse me. What are those ones for? I don't need armed baby-sitters! We're not baby-sitters. We're here to shoot you dead, if you turn out to be a Dalek spy. Well, that's a relief. I hate baby-sitters. OK, listen up. Now, remember, do not hold your breath when the nanoscaler engages. You'll feel like you want to, but you must keep breathing normally during the miniaturisation process. Why? Ever microwaved a lasagne without pricking the film on top? It explodes? Don't be lasagne. Nanoscaler engaging in five... four...three...two... Nanoscaler engaging...now. 'Nanoscaling in progress.' 'Nanoscaling complete.' Nanoscaling successful. Everyone OK in there? We made it. Nobody popped. Whoa. Ha-ha! I can't believe this! No, neither can I. We'll be following you all the way, Rescue One. Good luck all of you. 'Integration complete. Dalek levels steady.' That was...weird. You've seen nothing yet. What are the lights? Visual impulses travelling towards the brain. Beautiful. Welcome to the most dangerous place in the universe. 'Entering the cranial ledge now.' Here! Oh, my God! Behold, the belly of the beast. It's amazing. It's huge. No, Ross. We're tiny. So how big is it - that living part - compared to me and you, right now? You see all those cables? Yeah. They're not all cables. Does it know we're here? It's what invited us in. Now, this is the cortex vault, a supplementary electronic brain. Memory banks, but...more than that. This is what keeps the Dalek...pure. How are Daleks pure? Dalek mutants are born hating - this is what stokes the fire, extinguishes even the tiniest glimmer of kindness or compassion. Imagine the worst possible thing in the universe, then don't bother, because you're looking at it right now. This is evil refined as engineering. Doc...tor? Oh, hello, Rusty! You don't mind if I call you Rusty? We need to come down there with you. Medical examination, and all that. With those tentacles and things? ! How close do we have to get? Well, you know, we'll never insert a thermometer from up here. No. No, no, no, no! Stop! Stop! Stop, you idiot! We need a way down, the only way... This is a Dalek, not a machine! It's a perfect analogue of a living being, and you just hurt it! So what's going to happen now? Oh, God! What? What is it? ! Antibodies? Dalek antibodies! Nobody move! Any attempt to help him, or attack those things, will identify you as a secondary source of infection. Stay still! But the Dalek wants us in here. Why is it attacking? Can you control YOUR antibodies? Ross, stay calm, we're going to get you out of this. Can you? Ross, swallow that! What is it? Trust me. Now what? ROSS! Oh, my God! What's it doing? The hoovering. Gotcha! What did you give him? Oh, just a spare power cell. I can track the radiation signature! I need to know where they dump the bodies. I thought you were saving him! He was dead already! I was saving us! Follow me and run! Run! They've dumped him in here - organic refuse disposal. We need to get in there. Why? They won't give up till we're there! I'd rather go in alive than dead. You don't know where it goes! Yes, I do! Away from here! Now in! In! In! Whoa-agh-oh! I can hold them off! No, you can't! Pull back! Down! Jump, everyone, jump! Whoa-oh-agh! Eugh! What is this stuff? People! The Daleks need protein. Occasionally, they harvest from their victims. This is a feeding tube. Is Ross here? Yeah, top layer, if you want to say a few words. A man has just died, you will not talk like that! A lot of people have died. Everything in here is dead, and do you know why that's good? There is nothing good about that! Nothing is alive in here, so, logically, this is the weakest spot in the Dalek's internal security. Nobody guards the dead! Mortuaries and larders - always the easiest to break out of. Oh, I've lived a life! Tell Uncle Stupid that we're in. Aha! A bolt hole! He'll get us out of here. The difficult part is not killing him before he can. Bolt hole. Actually, a hole for a bolt. Does nobody get that? Also, there's the puns. Watch it, decontamination tubes are hot. 'Anomaly threat displaced. 'Dalek levels returning to normal parameters' 'Rescue One to Mission Control.' This is Blue, Rescue One. Report. The Dalek has an internal defence mechanism. 'We've lost Ross.' What kind of defence mechanism? 'That thing knows you're in there to help it! ' Yeah, well, who knows? It's a Dalek! We're going to continue the mission. Are you OK back there? It's a bit narrow, isn't it? Any remarks about my hips will not be appreciated. Och, your hips are fine, you're built like a man! Thanks(! ) What's that noise? Are you wearing a Geiger counter? Standard battle equipment. That's just low level radiation. But stronger down here, for some reason. Gimme! 'Was that him? ' How's he working out? Hard to say... He's... I've got it! I know what's wrong with Rusty. OK, that's good. Is that good? Well, you know how I said this was the most dangerous place in the universe? I was wrong. It's way more dangerous than that. 'Colonel, we have radiation indicators red-lining in here. 'The Dalek could be more badly damaged than we thought.' Copy that. 'Old Rusty here is suffering a trionic radiation leak.' It's poisoning the Dalek and us. Just as well we're here. Really? Perhaps we should get out while we can. Why should we trust a Dalek? Why would it change? Good question. Rusty? What changed you? I saw beauty. You saw what? In the silence and the cold. I saw worlds burning. That's not beauty. That's destruction. I saw more. What? What did you see? The birth of a star. Stars get born every day. You've seen a million stars born, so what? Daleks have destroyed a million stars. Oh, millions and millions. Trust me, I take count. And, yet, new stars are born. Every time. Resistance is futile. Resistance to what? Life returns. Life prevails. Resistance is futile. So, you saw a star being born. And you learned something. Dalek, do not be lying to me. Come on! 'Heading for the Trionic power cells, Colonel.' Radiation approxing 200 Rads. Danger levels. Radiation levels increasing. We're at the heart of the Dalek. It's incredible! Geiger counter's off the scale. Looks like it's about to blow. Good. How is that good? I like a bit of pressure. Rusty? Can you hear me? Doctor? Rusty! We've found the damage. I'm sealing up the breach in your power cell. No more radiation poisoning, good as new. There. Job done. That's it? Just like that? An anti-climax once in a while is good for my heart. Rusty? How do you feel? Rusty? Rusty? Rusty... The malfunction is corrected. What's happened? Not entirely sure. It's like it's waking up. Rusty, come on, talk to me, what's going on? The malfunction is corrected. All systems are functioning. Weapons charged. Oh, no, no, no... Exterminate! Exterminate! No, no, no... Exterminate! Exterminate! The Daleks will be victorious! The rebels will be exterminated! Colonel! What's happening out there? Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Pull back, pull back! Dalek fleet! Communications open! The rebel ship has been identified! Prepare for the Daleks! Doctor, what happened? Do you see? Do I see what? Daleks don't turn good. It was just radiation affecting its brain chemistry, nothing more than that. No miracle. Let me get this straight - we had a good Dalek, and we made it bad again? That's all we've done? There was never a good Dalek. There was a broken Dalek and we repaired it. You were supposed to be helping us. I gave it a shot. It didn't work out. It's a Dalek, what do you expect? No more talking, you are done! OK, new objective. We are taking this Dalek down. What's that look for? That's the look you get when I'm about to slap you! Oh! Clara! Are we going to die in here? I mean, there's a little bit of you that's pleased. The Daleks are evil after all. Everything makes sense. The Doctor is right! Daleks are evil, irreversibly so, that's what we just learned! No, Doctor! That is NOT what we just learned! Exterminate! Exterminate! Wasp fighters to action stations! Wasp fighters to action stations! 'The security systems have been hacked. 'We don't have access to the Wasps.' Then God save us all. We need to place the charges for maximum effect, I'm scanning the architecture. One question. No time. Why did we come here today? What was the point? You... You thought there was a good Dalek. What difference would one good Dalek make? All the difference in the universe, but it's impossible. Is that a fact? Is that really what we've learned today? Think about it! Is THAT what we've learned? Journey, what the hell's happening? That thing's set the Daleks on us. 'and it's locked us out of our defences.' Journey, you're the Aristotle's only hope. 'I need you to destroy that Dalek.' The rebels will be exterminated! Whatever it takes. Understood, Uncle. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. Clara Oswald, do I really not pay you? You couldn't afford me. Whatever you're going to do, don't do it! This Dalek must not be destroyed, we can do better! Are you out of your mind? No, I'm inside a Dalek! I'm standing where I've never been. We cannot waste this chance. It won't come again. What chance? I have my orders! Soldiers take orders. And I'm a soldier. A Dalek is a better soldier than you will ever be. You can't win this way. Ah! So what do we do? ! Something better. Prepare to board the rebel ship! We must find our comrade, Dalek! Spare no humans! Exterminate them all! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! The Dalek isn't just some angry blob in a Dalekanium tank. If it was, the radiation would have turned it into a raging lunatic. It IS a raging lunatic, it's a Dalek. But, for a moment, it wasn't. The radiation allowed it to expand its consciousness, to consider things beyond its natural terms of - and I can't find a free detective to look into it - We're understaffed I got a van-load of ammo driven by a Byz Lat dad - Where there's bullets, there's guns - Did the driver confess to guns? - No It's gonna take some legwork to prove I'm right - And in the meantime I've got actual murders, actual armed robberies that take priority You're not interested in preventing murders before they happen? - Why don't you look into it yourself? . - Fine. Talk to the chief Get him to back off this arrest quota I can't do both And I can't get in the middle of whatever arrangement the chief has - Can't? - Won't What, more important things to worry about now than a few guns on the street? I'll assign a detective when one frees up Hey, did you finish up the paperwork on this morning's car accident? Yeah - Lem, you finish that accident report? - Yeah - You said he wanted me to write that report - He does You done? - Hi, guys - We in your way? - No, we're just, uh- - We're just finishing up Sorry to interrupt. Just needed to ask a question... and sneak a kiss - You buying a car? - Yes. Yes, we are. I'm getting my Realtor's licence next week. So I need a respectable ride... - to show homes - Really? Yeah, I'm just helping out with the down payment He's the best Yeah, the best So we're gonna meet after work, right? - Dream Motor Cars, off Sepulveda? - Yeah, okay Okay - I'll see you there. - Okay. - Bye - See ya. Bye-bye Go with Lem and Ronnie, keep the dime-bag bust rolling - I hear you. - Let's go. Come on, lover You and me are ditching school today Interpol's dossier on Margos Dezirian. He's suspected ofkilling three coca farmers in Chile. - All found with their feet chopped off - Let me see. I need to run his known aliases against international flight manifests for the past month - He's in town. - Detectives, you have visitors The two men you find dead this morning. I know who did it I see him waiting at my home to kill me next My mother, my sister, her children If you protect us, I tell everything I know you, yes? I don't think so Yes, you and your friend Cletus. The accident that day. The guy paid up I never had to call - All right, yeah That's good - Cletus? - I did not know you worked for the police - Yeah, I was off duty I'm on duty now I gotta get back to work You've known this girl for two months. You buying her a new car? It's pre-owned I'm just covering the down payment She'll take over the monthly when she makes her first sale What happened to keeping a low profile, business as usual? I'm using my own money I'm putting it on my Visa Yeah, but it looks like you're buying your girlfriend a new Lexus It's pre-owned And being up to my eyeballs in debt is business as usual for me Nice try No sale, you got it? - Vic - What? Dutch is interviewing the guy that saw us the day of the money train - What guy? - Armin, the advance man. - So what's he doing here? - I don't know, but he recognized me - And he remembered your name, Cletus - Cletus Van Damme? You gave this guy the same alias you used to rent the storage unit where we hid the money? Well, it makes Lem laugh Hey, Lem. You gonna ride with the A-Team today or what? You were following this guy the day we stole the money Ifhe starts stringin' together the facts- Yeah, if Dutch does He heard the guy That's it We move the money tonight New location New name That is not the man doing the killing. Are you sure? His name's Margos Dezirian. That is Margos? Yeah, I've heard of the name, but it is Lyor Slavok you want - Lyor Slavok? - He is a soldier Who gives him orders- Margos, someone else- I do not know It's all because of this damn money train I heard a rumor a while ago about a money train Somebody ripped it off? Yeah, and the Armenians are gonna keep dropping bodies until they find out who Shit Our latest quarterly crime statistics... jumped up double digits in all areas Well, the best thing you can do for us in city council... is to find the money to fully staff this place again I don't take office for another six months I'm worried about right now You said you had a few ideas about adding personnel? Oh, the undercover Decoy Squad, uh, working Wilshire? - Yeah? - Their original mandate was to rotate among all districts. Well, Captain Griggs has used his Miracle Mile clout to hold onto them Well, that's why their numbers at Wilshire look a lot rosier than ours. - The unit's had great success - Well, Griggs will never give them up. I was thinking of appealing higher up the ladder. To the chief? You don't have anything to offer him It will make you look naive What other ideas do you have? Hey, strike a pose, boys You- get out of here, man Get out of here I'm gonna go out on a limb - Diagur. What, are you psychic? Yeah I predicted your old man would crash a van-load of live ammo He's fine. It's you he's worried about. - Me too - Vic. Those nine-millimeter shells aren't for these little cap guns You guys expecting a new shipment of hardware? Who's running this boys' club now? Yeah, we missed the last election You guys looking to shoot your way back into business and territory? Well, you know, we do what we gotta do Really? I find out you're arming yourselves with anything more serious than this I will turn the Byz Lats into my personal piñata Which means we shove candy up your ass and beat you with a bat. You pass it up the daisy chain Vic Mackey, my nigga Ain't seen you boys around here in a while Yeah, we've been enjoying the sun New stuff? Religious erotica Where in the Bible does St Schlong visit Our Lady of the D-cup? Hey, man. I'm giving the believers what they want right there. So what's the news? You find out if anyone's selling guns to the Byz Lats? Nope. But I found out who's buying. - Yeah? Who? - You know the cat Lovely. Let me see you, uh, spin around. Nice - Hey - Oh, drama. Hey, ladies, ladies, ladies Could y'all bounce for a minute? Everybody, come on Sweet setup. I thought you were broke, Kern. Whoa, whoa, whoa Slap, easy, man Easy, easy, baby This is my boy, Slap. He got my back. Whatever makes Slap happy So who's financing this hot spot? - You know, found some investors - Really? - One-niners buy a share? - Let's just say... - sometimes you can go home again - Come on, Kern What's a gangsta rapper like you investing in heavy metal for? - We know you're making a gun buy for your boys - Well, you know wrong Really? You know what? I'll bet we could make half our narc quota by emptying the pockets in this room -Let's go Everybody, hands on your head -All right. Calm down, Hee-Haw. All right, man. Yeah, I'm buyin', okay? But not because I want to, 'cause I got to The Byz Lats armin' themselves to the mother tit with MP5's -Jesus Christ Fully auto SMG's? - Three dozen. My boys just looking for a balance of power - The Byz Lats already have 'em? - I don't know. Same guy that's sellin' to me is sellin' to them too - Who's runnin' this arms race? - He's regular army - When's your buy? - What about the Byz Lats? They got it in their greasy little heads that south of Vermont belong to them I'll disarm the Mexicans And I'm supposed to believe that? You forget last time we did business? How you just shit all over me? That was a one-time war crime, and I apologized Now what time's the buy and where? You make me find out on my own, you'll be facing a charge too. - Detective Holland Wagenbach? - Yeah? Agent Quigley, US Treasury - I asked for FBI - You got me I understand you have an Armenian wiseguy who wants to come clean - Already has - Who's the boss around here? We've been concerned with the Armenian mob's propensity for shipping US currency overseas About four months ago, my office instituted a sting operation What kind of sting operation? In San Jose, the Armenians were extorting a local businessman He allowed us to insert $50,000 of marked, traceable bills into his payment to the Armenians so we could track the loot and see what banks were washing the money. - And? - Not a single bill has popped up in three months It's mystified us. But then today I was notified by my counterpart in the F.B.I... that you were investigating a possible robbery of the Armenian mob And four related murders We may have blown our laundering case but if any of these marked bills show up they might lead you to your killers Someone inside? Hey, I thought I heard you guys in here Oh, I'm Albert, Albert Kreeg I'm the manager Uh, looks like you guys got everything in okay - Yeah, we're all set, Al - Ah, Albert Like the prince - Yeah We're good, Al bert - Okay Okay, uh Did you just move out of a place? - Yeah, I'm getting divorced - Oh,yeah.

Vic? - Come on It's not like that - I worked my ass off to get this Realtor's licence - Yeah, I know that I need to make a living Would you buy a half a million dollar home - from somebody driving a '97 Neon? - From you?

Bye Bye, Daddy I love you, Matt He's got a great energy Uh, that classical music you were playing there It's the Tomatis Method Matt's learning to use his ears as his primary source of hearing so his other senses don't get overwhelmed - And he's responding really well - Yeah - Remember to do his drills with him - I will Mr Mackey, it was nice to meet you - I'll just let myself out - Okay So I'll see you next time. I told you he was amazing Matthew's actually talking We could have Owen two more nights a week He has another job offer but he wants to work with Matthew full time. Ah, things are kind of tight right now - How much is it gonna cost? - An extra 300 a week Okay Look, I gotta get back to the job Book him I'll figure out how I'm gonna cover it Actually, you know what? I only need for you to pay for half I'm gonna take care of the rest. I'm going back to work There's a nursing shortage, and the pay is good. - Full time? - Thirty hours a week - to start. - How's that gonna work with the kids? I don't know, but, uh, we're gonna have to figure it out because it's something I wanna do Danny, hi. Sir I'm temping here till my appeal - And how's that looking? - My lawyer says not to get my hopes up I'm thinking of adding a few more bodies to the Barn I'd be filling the slots with people who can get with my program What program's that? I need officers who I can trust play tough but fair, keep me aware of anyone who isn't - You're looking for rats - No. No, I don't want what happened to you to happen to anyone else -Just tell the truth if any big lines get crossed - You mean by Vic? By anyone You interested? You saying I can get my job back? Think about it Give me your answer when school gets out What? Word is you're a little unsure of yourself out there - Is that what my partner's saying? - What do you say? - I'm doing just fine - Look,Julien I'm not the one riding you here But you got a little problem with respect in this house People are wondering what you're doing about the beating you took Look, detectives haven't made much progress They still can't prove who did it Everybody here knows who did it And they're watching you Where do we stand with our Armenian triggerman? Judge Molina's clerk says we should have the warrant within an hour - Good - Somebody say "warrant"? Need me to knock any doors down? Damn, I was gonna ask her to the prom This warrant for that Armenian double hit? Turns out the mob's pissed off about a shitload of stolen money ticketed for the homeland Now they're whacking'all the players trying to find it. - Armin was scared he was gonna be the next stumpy - Where's Armin now? Feds took him. Witness protection. The good news is, finally got a break on two unsolved murders that have been screwing up my perfect record - How's that? - When this robbery went down... two mob soldiers got killed Three, four guys in masks came roarin' in, took the cash, left the bodies Hey, man What's up? Armin told Dutch that the guys who robbed the money train killed those two Armenians that night - We didn't kill no one - Why in the hell would he tell him that? My guess is Armin knew those two guys were stealing from him. Armin's the one who called the shooter down there that night He's scared enough to admit to money laundering but not scared enough to admit to his part in a 187 So if the robbery leads back to us we're on the hook for a double murder. - Jesus. - Right Here are the keys to the new space With this new heat, we should wait another six, nine months before giving our cash over to the real estate guy. - Nine months? - We've already been sitting on this- Well, I didn't mean to interrupt your secret Klan meeting - We left our hoods at the dry cleaners - Come on, Tavon. Why is it that every time I enter the room, y'all stop talking? Maybe it's because we're captivated by your winning smile - Or blinded by yours - Hey,you two done pissing? Sit down I'll tell you what's going on The Byz Lats just opened fire on our turf Aceveda doesn't have the manpower to attack this and Kern's not playing nice. So we gotta do it ourselves and do it fast. We're gonna tap Kern's phone, find out when this gun buy's going down. What, you gonna set a tap without a warrant? - No time. - Not enough hard evidence. You got a problem with that, speak up now Two weeks ago, 12 cases of MP5's were stolen from Fort Irwin And that's 72 guns on the streets in the open market. I already picked up one body I don't want any more Set up the tap on Kern Hey, look It's the Village People Stand by, Vic We're tapping I don't believe you. Jamir said all the skanks you hired are light-skinned with fine bodies. Come on, baby. Jamir's half white. What's he know about fine bodies? I know you, Kern. Don't play me with this innocent- Sounds like Kern's not too big to be a little whipped Next thing you know, he'll be buying her a new car - Don't cut me off - Let me know when the call comes in - Where you going? - Corrine asked me to pick up Cassidy at school - How long we staying here? - Until the call comes in The conversation will probably be in code Shit I told Mara I'd take her to lunch Four different guns so far We'll run them all through ballistics Look what the Dutchman found He mailed an international overnight package to Greece this morning - Look at the name of the recipient - "Marcus Dreliozis"? Sound like a Greek alias of Margos Dezirian to you? Check out the comments section Contents contain dry ice I think we found our missing feet I'm sorry Yeah, I'll try All right, me too Yeah, I love you too Okay, bye-bye Oh, blow me Dude, we're rich - At least we're gonna be - Yeah -Just gotta ride things out - Yeah - Yo,yo. Let me talk to Kern. - You got him. It's Lex. Guns are ready. Get all the cash yet? Yeah, man. I'm sittin'on it. - Be there in half an hour. - Right here. I think I just broke the code The gun boyjust went inside. With six crates and four army pals. - Four? - Yeah - We need backup - Backup? Vic, we're here on an illegal wiretap - 6-Paul-11 requesting additional units - What are you doing? - I'm getting these guns back - Vic, we don't have a warrant He's right, you know Maybe we should just keep a low profile on this thing Roger, 6-Paul-11. What's your location? Hey, it's five-on-five You guys wanna go bullet to bullet with 3,000 SMG's? I know what I'm doing 6-Paul-11 - We're at the corner of Fletcher and Riverside. - Roger that. My client denies any involvement in these killings. We've got an informant in the organization that implicates him. This informant may have heard some stories, but he saw nothing with his own eyes. What did he mail to Athens this morning? Books In dry ice? This isn't even his name on this - He just said he sent it - And the receipt was found in his place The only question is why were you stupid enough to keep the receipt? - I'm not gonna ask him that. - Okay. Why is he whispering? We don't understand what he's saying anyway Margos Dezirian is gonna be at this address in Greece tomorrow, isn't he? We're having the package rerouted to us We'll see for ourselves Four of them That way Go in the back Take your cue from those guys Don't get in the way - Hands on your head! - Hands on your head now! - Get down! - Get on the ground! - Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit! He ducked into a back room - Kern, where's that lead to? - Nowhere The window's barred Hook these people up Hook them up and get them out - Turn that off - Everybody grab a gun Load 'em You inside It's your 800 rounds a minute versus our 4,000 I'm gonna give you three seconds to toss that weapon, or we're gonna open fire One, two- Come on out These are the serial numbers of the marked bills If they get spent, make their way through the banking system, they'll eventually get flagged. - Maybe we can flag them earlier - The money was stolen here,; it'll probably be spent here. We should do cursory checks on all big money busts - Any luck siccing the Greek authorities on Margos? - Not yet. I talked to the American embassy in Athens The Greek authorities aren't gonna move unless they hear from somebody higher up than an LA detective - You have any connections in Washington? - I've been to a few parties Taking guns from our soldiers, selling them to gangbangers? You must be very proud, asshole God bless America - Come here Come here - We got it, man Hey, Vic You tell me Who bought the guns for the Byz Lats? Yeah, like I'm just gonna admit I sold guns to another crew? Uncuff him What are you doing? Instant court-martial A trained soldier grabbed my spare gun and tried to run for it - Yo, guys. - Evidence Around there Now you either tell me who bought the guns for the Byz Lats or you and me are gonna play some run and gun - Yeah - Then run - You're out of your goddamn mind. - Run It's an OG named Garza He's king of the Lats That's a good little soldier boy You want Treasury's list of marked bills, or you want me to hang onto it? I'll keep it I saw you talking to Vic Has he been asking about this case? I was asking him some questions, 'cause I know he has experience with Armenian organized crime Well, from here on, keep him out of the loop - Okay Why? - Because that's the way I'd like it Detective, you've got a package. Size 101/2 Hold on. Kern and his guys were in on the sting. They set it up. - That's why we didn't need a warrant - That's right Little always ready to help his brothers in blue Give him to me,Julien Come on What the hell was that? I thought you'd be a little bit more appreciative since I just saved you from a felony arms arrest - Call us even - Nothing's even One of your guys ain't dead. Look, we're just gonna get different gats Go see the Mexicans It's on It's off My next stop is the Mexicans You have my word - Yeah, well I used to trust that - You still can You just give me tonight to prove it You got tonight - What? - I thought we were playin' it tight - We are - You put us all at risk without lettin' us have a say over guns that we've got nothing to do with - And I'd do it again - Well, I wouldn't I wouldn't I talked to my boss in D.C. Here's the problem. The Greeks don't wanna help us - They're a little pissed off at the moment - Why? 'Cause we make up reasons for going to war and then act like the world's policeman? That and the missiles we sold to Turkey We're not the only ones who want Margos - Paraguay, Chile, Belgium. - It's not Brussels who's asking them to conduct this raid. Maybe in a couple of days we can go through back channels - and figure out a way we can- - Whoa, whoa, whoa We know where Margos is gonna be tomorrow It's already tomorrow in Athens I just need a few police officers to pick him up He's wanted for murder in four countries. - Can you get Leo to tell you where Margos is going next? - No. He's not talking Even in prison you need feet Sorry, I've done everything I can. Assistant Chief Phillips. Claudette Wyms. - I remember, Detective - What's going on? I think you should talk to Captain Aceveda Why? He's not stepping down yet, is he? You should go talk to him I'm supposed to be captain in two days. I still have some unfinished business - How long? - Until I take office. - In six months? - It's a volatile time in Farmington right now I can't leave the Barn underfunded, understaffed - You're gonna bring in more personnel - Yes - The undercover Decoy Squad? - Yes - You're stealing my ideas - I'm implementing them, along with some of my own You are stealing my ideas, and you're taking my job I've got the power to make those ideas happen I can still make a difference here - I can make a difference - Not like me - This is my job - Not yet You're the reason for half the problems in the first place Well, that's your opinion I'd keep any others to myself I will not let you do this to me There's a bigger picture, Claudette, and you're smart enough to see it The chiefs not gonna help you. He's gonna need me The army scab who sold the Byz Lats their guns says the buyer's name was Garza Garza? I thought he retired Well, maybe his pension ran out 'Cause he's back I need you to get in touch with him Tell him that you found a buyer offering to pay double what he paid That's all I got I'll cover you on the back end Hey, man Top's down pretty tight on the Byzantine Quarter these days That's at least a couple days' work You got two hours - Danny? - No, no I'll hold - You got the guns, huh? - Uh, half of them. Byz Lats already have the other half Trying to put together a buy while they're all in the same hands - I need some cash - How much? - A hundred grand - Right Just to show them that we're real I just need it for a couple hours - Then put in a request through central - I need it now, tonight I'm not bending the rules for you. - Hey, look I didn't even want this case in the first place - Then why did you take it on? Because, obviously, I'm the only one who gives a shit - about the damage these guns are gonna do - You're not I've spent all day calling in favors to make sure things change in Farmington in the next six months - What's that mean? - It means that you have to file the proper paperwork and wait a couple of days for the hundred grand Or you can stop by an ATM The guy's wanted by Interpol I'm giving you the address All you have to do is pick him up What's so goddamn hard about that? If my tone sounds superior, it's because I'm American and you're Greek. - Trouble in Armenia? - Athens actually What's going on? Nothing It's just the usual bullshit Whom shall I fear? You are the stronghold of my life Whom should I- Jesus Christ What are you doing here? Confess To what you did to me - What? - I just need to know Look, I just- I just need to know What the hell is your problem, man? The truth Just tell me the truth I didn't do anything to you Oh, shit! Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear Even though war breaks out against me, even then- Julien, please! Oh, God Previously on Wonderfalls. As your brother, I'm gonna be relentless until you tell me what's goin' on with you. God, as if I knew. - Make me a match. - You can't talk! - Girl needs a boy. - Girl needs a doughnut. - Keep 'em here. - Take a picture! - Mend what was broken. - Get her words out. Tell me why you talk to me! Because... you listen. All right, girls. Let's make this quick! Come on! You know, this sudden impulse of yours to visit my ancestral lands... is great, but aren't you supposed to be at work? I couldn't stand the thought of spending another day... looking at those faces with their stupid little mouths constantly running... and making all sorts of unreasonable demands on me. Are you sure you should be in a customer service industry? So what happens after you hand that thing in? They verify my claim, and then I'm embraced by my people... as a part of the Satsuma Indian Nation. - That's awesome. - It's also fraud. You're not Indian. You're black. Uh, one-eighth Satsuman on my grandmother's side. But even a fraction of my fraction makes me eligible for full tribal citizenship. And a cut of the gambling money. Uh-uh, no. This is not about money. This is about tribe pride. However, if a Title IV federal grant will pay off my student loans, then justice is served. Where's the casino? This place doesn't even have a Stuckey's. Hey, there's some guys over there. Why don't you ask them? Hey, fill it up! And do not drip on the paint. Hi. Go on in. Go on! Be glad you did. Over there. An authentic Satsuman totem should not be speaking English. I'm not authentic. They put me here for the tourists. Go on. Go on in. That's it. Go on. - Hurry. Right across the street there. - I'm going, I'm going. That's good. Look both ways! - You're gonna like it. - I think we both know that's not true. - Right across there. That's good. - Shut up, already! Hello? Oh! Sorry. Excuse me. I didn't mean to wake you. Enter and sit. Why do you hesitate? You've come with many questions. But very little money. So, if you're like the local fortuneteller or something- They speak to you in many voices. And many forms. You have been sought out for a great purpose. For this, you have been chosen. No. I don't want to be chosen. In this instance, I'm anti-choice. Also, chosen by what? Who are "they"? - Do you know? - Yes. Many questions. Yeah. If you're just gonna be all cryptic, it will affect your tip. You entered this place only to silence the voices. You wish to silence them forever? Can I? Is there some way? Can you tell me how? Why do you think you're here? Okay. Cryptic. And yet, I think I like where you're going. Okay. I'm listening. If you could tell me how to get some relief... - I'd really appreciate it. - Excuse me. Hi. We're sort of in the middle of something. So would you mind... waiting outside until we're through? Uh, what are you in the middle of? We're having a conversation. You're having a conversation with my dead grandmother? Okay, that's just odd. One case of Milestone cigarettes. Will that be all? Make it two. Just because I own 80 cartons... doesn't mean I won't quit before I smoke them all. I need to see your resident card. Oh, I'm not Indian - Native. - I can only sell you three packs. - Three packs? That's hardly worth the trip. - Sorry. New rule. - What moron started this rule? Hello, Tyler. Littlefoot? Deana Littlefoot. Oh, my God! Why, this is so- Wow! Hey, congratulations! I read in the alumni newspaper that you are practicing... upstate with Kirchner/McKenzie now. - Very prestigious. - I left Kirchner/McKenzie. - Oh, you did! - I was needed here. My people were being exploited, and there was no one looking out for their interests. Good for you. And- good for you too. She is the best! We went to law school together. Both top in our class. Remember the time you got our 200-year-old... beloved mascot banned from campus? - It was a sexist symbol of patriarchal oppression. - Yeah. - It was a beaver. - My people are through being slaves... to imperialist aggression by relying on nonnative trade. My God. You haven't changed a bit. Neither have you. You always did need to be reminded of your place. You were never top of our class, Tyler. - I was. - All right. You were one. I was two. Whatever! This is silly! How about we just leave all that ugly competition in the past, where it belongs? I don't know what you're talking about. You were never any competition. And you weren't two. You were like sixth. - I want my cigarettes. Two cases. - She might get cancer. Mahandra! This is my good friend, Mahandra... who happens to be a member of the Satsuma Nation. She will take two cases. Show him your membership card. I don't have one yet. I just turned in my application. - It has to be reviewed by the tribal lawyer. - That would be me. Did you just screw me? Ohh! Excuse me! Hi. That crazy blonde woman? - This way. - She's not my good friend. In fact... I wouldn't even really say we're friends, in any meaningful sense of the word. The fact is- - What's going on? - She disturbed Gentlefeather's sacred resting place. I - I don't know her either. This is all making me really uncomfortable. I'm trying to respect my grandmother's wishes, I am. And I thought I'd be fine with a native funeral. But not if you're going to allow tourists to participate. - What were you doing in there? - I was paying my respects. And I have a few more respects to pay. I just need to talk to her for one more minute. - Talk to her? - Did I say talk? - I meant see. - I'd rather she didn't. And, uh, if you're gonna do that pyre thing, I'd appreciate if you could do it soon. Before more people show up and poke my dead grandmother. - You poked a dead grandmother? - I didn't poke! I think it's best you and your friends leave, Tyler. Not friends. A - Acquaintances. - What about my application? - Denied. But, if you care to contest, tribal court meets Thursday morning, 11:00 a. m. Hope you have a good lawyer. It will be fine. I will personally represent you. Pro bono. That means free. What? Her spirit spoke to you? Nope. Mm-mmm. But does that sort of thing happen a lot around here? Not that it happens every day, but we're taught that our holy ones... can sometimes linger between this world and the next. - She was holy? - Gentlefeather was our seer. Our spiritual guide. A voice of reason among many loud and more angry voices. I'm very sorry for your loss... but could I maybe speak to the new seer person, the backup "seerer"? There isn't one. The line ended with Gentlefeather. It's a line? Well- What about him? He's the grandson, right? He's in line. Hey, it's his holy grandmother. Can he talk to her? He doesn't have the gift. Besides, he barely spoke to her... when she was among the living. Why should it be any different now? Show him who's special. You can do it. Go on! What's the matter? - Nothing. - Nothing? - You said it was an emergency. - An emergency of sorts. Um, what do you know about Satsuman Indian legend? Um, not a lot. Good. Okay. You can be my authority. Shut up. Hi! - You came. Thanks. - Did she tell you it was an emergency? I'm Jaye. We didn't really get a chance to meet officially. You're the girl that was talking to my dead grandma. It's inanimate people, too? You said you had something of hers. Please tell me you didn't take it off the body. No! It was in the dirt. Someone must have dropped it. Uh, this is from that rack. Well, actually, it's mine. Okay. How about this? - You getting anything? - Does that belong to my grandma? I... don't understand. I - I don't understand. Is there some reason I'm here? - Is this about a time-share? - No time-share, but there is a video. I can't watch a video. Tax season is a very busy time for me. I have things to do. I'll fast-forward through the beginning. We'll get right to the meat, please. For your grandma. I'll give you a gift certificate. Gift! You'd like a gift, wouldn't you? And, because Lelawala, daughter of Chief Eagle Eye, surrendered to her destiny... the tribe lived on in peace and prosperity. There. See? That's what you need to do. - Throw myself over the falls? - No! Surrender to destiny. You have to follow in Grandma's footsteps. Ahh. You're one of those. It's in your blood. You're the next in line. I gave up that line a long time ago. I've got a new line now. - Thanks, though. - No, no, no. The new line is the wrong line. The old line is the line you want to be in. Grandma's line. So, you can claim your gift. Whatever it is you're looking for, you're looking in the wrong spot. - I don't have a gift. Any gift. - Oh, you do. You do have the gift. It's your destiny. What did the Maid of the Mist teach us about destiny? The Maid of the Mist isn't even a real myth. It was just fabricated by whitey to bring in tourists. What if the gift was hormonal, like menopause, and develops as you mature? - I mean, when was the last time you checked? - I've been checking... since I was born- so has everyone else. - Why do you think I left? - But Grandma- I broke my grandma's heart. It's like... she knitted a sweater for me I could never wear. When I was a young boy, I would pretend I could talk to spirits just to make her happy. But they just thought I was retarded. I can't go back. I have no place there. My place was reserved for someone with a gift I don't have. But how do you know for sure? Like, for sure, for sure? Yeah. Many of the great spiritual leaders didn't even realize they had gifts... - until they were called on to use them. - Ooh, that's good. St. Paul was just a punk until he was blinded by the light... and Gandhi was just drinkin' and whorin' it up with his friends, until... he heard the cry of his people. And Neo was just a big geek... until he swallowed that little red pill. - I'm kind of a geek. - Yes. You are. But in a good way, like Neo. So come on. Take the red pill. You know you wanna. The grandson of Gentlefeather has returned to us. We will commence with the journey of the feather. The feather is drawn to the energy of the seer through concentration and reflection. It'll be the first sign that Bill Hooten has the gift. What? That feather took a mean left turn. It's static cling. I was out of dryer sheets. Lots of things seem to cling to you. - Including the spirits of old women. - What? That's crazy! She didn't- All right. We may have had words. But she said nothing about purposes or being chosen or anything like that. - But you were chosen. - Nope. Her spirit chose to talk to you. It never talked to me. And I couldn't get her to shut up when she was alive. - You are Gentlefeather's successor. - No, I'm not! - She never said that. - The tribe needs a spiritual leader, now more than ever. Leftist fury has clouded Littlefoot's judgment. She will bring financial ruin if she stands unopposed. All this B.S. about exploitation. - I've got a business to run. - I'm not a leader! I need a leader. I need a leader who can talk to dead Grandma... and find out how to lift a particular burden of mine. Besides, they don't want a white chick fighting their battles. It doesn't look good. She is your broom... and this floor may not be dirt, but it is dirty. And I am ready to sweep. Karma's comin' round, and it's gonna knock her to the ground. Ooh. I should write that down. The tribal certification hearing for Mahandra McGinty will now begin. - Your Honor- - Your Honor, I- Point of order. In accordance with the new rule passed by Tribal Council last night... birth records may not be computer generated, abstracted or transcribed. These are and, therefore, are not admissible. Motion granted. All court costs will be paid for by the defendant. Please see the clerk for your bill. If Bill Hooten, grandson of Gentlefeather, is destined to be our seer... he must prove himself in three tests. First, you must choose... which one of these things belonged to Gentlefeather. It's multiple choice. I think someone's having a spiritual awakening. - He is? You think so? - Not him. He's having a panic attack. You. You're having a spiritual awakening. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You're stupid. - You're being called. - Yeah? Well, I'm transferring the call to his extension. Wh - What are you- You recognize anything? Not really. I- I don't think Grandma smoked a pipe, and I'm not sure if she wore glasses. Just relax. Open yourself up to the experience. Psst! Pick me. Pick me! Pick me. Pick me. Me. Pick me. "Ear-bay ull-skay. " The bear skull. Yea! You got one right. I think we can all see who the new seer's gonna be. What? Nine hundred dollars? Why should I pay $900 to not be a member of the tribe? I'm already not a member of the tribe. You always have to be number one, don't you? But do you have to do it at the expense of others? Fine. I'll do it at your expense. Why do you have my credit card receipts? Cigarettes purchased on the rez by nonnatives... are subject to the New York State cigarette tax. You wouldn't dare. You owe $6,750. Before interest. Light the pipe. Breathe in the smoke. The power will be passed on to the one who can pierce the veil... and commune with Gentlefeather. There's not gonna be any communing. He's not the guy. The feather didn't land on him, and I saw you cheat. - I think you're the guy. - That's crazy! Why are you fighting this? Is it because you're lazy? Do you just not want the responsibility? I admit that's a factor. But let's face it. "Seer-ing," or whatever, isn't my destiny. - I'm just not cut out for that kind of work. - And you think he is? Look at him. The man's an accountant, Jaye. An accountant. He can't even get the pipe lit. - They're making a fool out of him. - Oh, my God. You're right. This is very cruel. What have I done? I'm like those parents who force their uncoordinated children to play sports. Someone's got to put him out of his misery. You have to tell him the truth. All right. But he- - Oh, my God! - Oh. - He doesn't have a pulse! - This is the final test. To depart from this world and return after speaking with his ancestors. - We thought we lost you. - Technically, he's supposed to bring himself back to life. - Was I dead? - For like a minute. Which means you might have brain damage, so you should probably get that checked. I touched the other side. I saw my grandmother. She was like a vision in the mist. - Did she speak to you? - She told me not to go into the light. Did she say anything else? Anything about- - I don't know, silencing voices or- - No. Nothing like that. She said I lost my path... but that I would find it again. - That's not very specific. - Or helpful. I talked to my dead grandmother. And I came back. I do have the gift! This is my path! This is my path! I found it! Come here. Finally, it's happened. Don't you think it's cruel to let him believe he's the new seer... when clearly he's not- I mean, clearly. What harm could it do? A little help, please! Well! If it isn't Mahandra Tanawanda! No, it isn't. That name was killed in the cross fire of a bitter law school rivalry. What did Mom say about your competitive streak? I didn't do anything! Littlefoot ambushed me. It was a setup. I didn't stand a chance. Comfort her. Go on. Comfort her. - What are you doing? - I'm comforting you. Well, stop it. Ow. Ow! Stop. Ow! Ow! Stop pulling. Wait! It's my bracelet. Stuck in my hair. We can wait it out somewhere. - Really? The red one, here. Red stands out. - They're not easy to come by. You guys go on. Not without you. Are you going to your lover? I'll screw him and tell him, okay? She knows what she's doing. - Don't snap at me. I didn't. He's only in one scene and I promised. - I'll see you in Hazeldonk. If I'm not there in an hour, go without me. And us? - We're going on a holiday. This is a nice mess. - Yes. Renée, I want a cigarette now. What? - I want a smoke. Thanks. Thank you. I needed that. I do have a stable, round the back. We'd be glad to take it. Follow me. Excuse me. That night baby Jesus was born. Mary laid him in the manger. twinkle, twinkle, little star how I wonder where you are Has Najib put the boys to bed? You know. Kimmie doesn't have anyone beside me. That's so... I never thought about her not having anyone else before. And I forgot to say when I'd be back, too. Maybe it's better that way. I didn't know where else Kimmie... I don't even know the woman. She's Russian. - Natasha is okay. Even if she is Russian. Did you see the star too? Lot, you have to give yourself up. You'll only get a few years. It could be alright. You could still see your children. Tell me where the others are. So we can arrest them without using violence. Do you want me to call them? 'Hey girls, come turn yourselves in.' So here we are in Hazeldonk. Nobody knows you're with us. You can just fly to your daughter. There's the Road to Far Away. - I'd do it if I were you. Here, take this. You never know. - I won't go without you. Catch a ride to Brussels. - What's stopping you, your dog? No, you are. You've become my family. I wouldn't mind you as my mother. And besides: you can't even drive. You have to let the woman go, at least. You're taking big risks. With guns and all... They were never loaded. - Oh, come on. The police are going to start shooting back. You're no good to your children dead. What if I told you I love you? - That's up to you. Fear not, Mary. Follow your heart to a safe haven. When your son is grown he will be the King, God promised us long ago. Kees. You're a hero, my hero. Listen, Ramon's here. Go to him when it's over. Bye, darling. This is the first time I've been further than Antwerp. Isn't that crazy? So far, it's not that great. - All I want is to hug Mel. What's the plan? We can't drive around forever. They'll catch us anyway. - They should have to try hard. I don't dare go in there. - Don't be silly. I stayed here often with Twan. They're normal people. Depends on what you call normal. - I don't even have pyjamas with me. Do you have a room for four? - Certainly, tout-de-suite. Did she say suite? Yes, please. You want a suite? I have a nice suite for four persons. You're staying for one night? - Yes. May I ask how you'll settle the bill? Do you have a credit card? Good. Agreed. Room 326 on the fourth floor. I wish you a very pleasant evening. Kers, we're rock stars. Girls. There's more to see. Wow, a bubble bath. It's working. There was a violent robbery at a supermarket in Breda this afternoon. Hey, we're on TV. Two people were injured, and a passing woman was taken hostage. The robbers, almost certainly three women, are dangerous. They escaped with an unknown sum of money. The two injured men were taken to hospital. Their condition is not critical. The women, who have disappeared, are responsible for several robberies. It is now known that they successfully robbed a branch of a bank in Breda. It is possible they were also involved in other robberies. The police already know the names of two of the women. Nothing is known about the fate of the female hostage. That's all for now. I would never have thought it. Oh, my goodness... The bath is overflowing. Why don't you sit down and relax? So where's the bubbly? - I'll call for you. Hi, it's Mom, give me Najib please. Room service? Room 326. Okay, thank you. She has to take three of the blue ones at once, they're for her arteries. Champagne's coming. - The others, for blood pressure. Damn, I'm not hungry. And get her to pee before sleeping. Don't forget. In the left cupboard. No, there's a safety latch. How many times have I told you? You're not his mother. Listen Najib. No, be quiet. You'll have to fend for yourself. You have to use your head. I know you can. I want you to take good care of Mo and Moes, and Ma. Promise me that, Habibi. Do you promise? Yes, okay. Okay, darling. Hang in there. Good evening. - Good evening. Nice bubbly stuff and snacks. do not disturb I would've liked to count it, just for the feeling. We'll keep our fingers crossed. That I won't run off with it. You will. - I'll take care of you. You'd better. - We'll come to see you, sometime. I'll miss you. - We'll miss you too. I'll ask Kees to fetch your dog. - That stinky thing? Take care of yourself. - And of you. Before this falls into the wrong hands. - Exactly. I hope she makes it. I hope she doesn't buy lots of fancy coats. She won't. She's already got one. She'll buy a car, a Fiat Panda. Let's toast to us, then. Yes, to us. It's perfect, almost perfect. I only miss... Don't say it. Now's the time. Achilles? Yes. We let the woman go. We don't know. Listen, we're surrendering. Achilles, I didn't mean what I said at the play. Bye. He knew. I never said so, but I love him. You're not serious. - Yes, you are. Watch out, you two. Don't say anything. Give me some more champagne. - Isn't there any more? The robbers are hiding in Brussels. The police are at the site. They're surrendering.

Disney cartoons everywhere you turn. Disney, disney, disney. People having conversations with themselves. Like you. You know how strange you look Having a conversation by yourself? I have a theory about that. If i can't see it, it doesn't exist. That's because you don't believe in magic. Yeah, well... I don't. You know why? Because when i was a little kid, They used to have this show on tv called peter pan. Had this grown woman in it named mary martin Dressed up like a little boy, Which i don't even want to get into now. So this little fairy gets sick, right? Tinkerbell. She drinks the poison That captain hook left for peter. Yeah. Whoever, whatever. Anyway, they said, "well, if you believe in magic, "Why, then, you just clap your hands, and she'll get better. Yeah, if you believe, clap your hands, ooh! She'll get better." Let me tell you something: I didn't believe, so i didn't clap my hands, and you know what? She got better anyway, Which just goes to show you there is no such thing as magic. People just try to make you believe that there is. I watched that video with my mom. We always clapped our hands. Yeah, well... Ha ha! You can't believe... I got caught in a detour. You know, they're tearing up allen street. Come on, harriet. Nobody takes allen street. You take rose, and you cut across the 92. So you brought your bodyguard, huh? Albert, mr. Morrison. Hi. Bob. Come on. I just want to show you this. Isn't this great? Isn't this spectacular? Isn't it everything i said it was going to be? I mean, it's amazing. Look at this place! And you know what's wonderful about it? It has its own 2 trucks. Albert, don't break anything. I don't own it yet. And leave that cat alone. Bob, so, can you see what i can do here? You can make a lot of soup. Bob, I'm serious. I take you seriously, harriet. I always did. You know that. Well, then, make the numbers work. Put it together, bob, and make it work. Wow! Vanilla. What do you want? Oh, uh... strawberry! Strawberry? What? Ok, strawberry. Strawberry. And chocolate. Chocolate. Bananas. ♪ tutti-Frutti once and spumoni twice ♪ ♪ banana split for my baby ♪ ♪ and a glass of plain water for me ♪ ♪ spray the whip cream for at least an hour ♪ ♪ pile it as high as the eiffel tower ♪ Nuts! ♪ load it with nuts, about 16 tons ♪ ♪ top it with a pizza just for fun ♪ ♪ banana split for my baby ♪ ♪ and a glass of plain water for me ♪ ♪ banana split for my baby ♪ ♪ and a glass of plain water for me ♪ Why wrap yourself up in this place?

Now because of you, we're going to a party, So i want you to take bob aside, And i want you to say, "bob, This investment is great for your bank." Repeat that to me right now. This investment is great for your bank. Albert, can i ask you a question? Who do you talk to all the time? Bogus. And, uh...where's your friend come from? France. He's french. French. Oui. Listen, albert, i got to tell you. I'd feel a lot more comfortable If you had some visible friends. See, then i wouldn't care If they were from france or germany or ethiopia. Tell her about ethiopia. Ethiopia is in the northern part of africa. Children in ethiopia are very hungry. There's a drought there. That means no rain. Liza minnelli went there once With shirley maclaine. Mom told me audrey hepburn made them come. How do you know all that? I wrote a report. My mom helped me. You want a root beer? You know, albert, you're so smart.

SHE THOUGHT HE WAS MAGIC. MAYBE HE WAS, 'CAUSE HE SURE DID DISAPPEAR. I DON'T EVEN THINK SHE GOT HIS LAST NAME. Woman: GRANDPARENTS? Ruthie: SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FAMILY-- NO PARENTS, NO GRANDPARENTS, NO BROTHERS, NO SISTERS. SHE WAS RAISED IN A FOSTER HOME BACK IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. IF THERE'S NO FAMILY, WHERE WILL ALBERT GO? WHY CAN'T I JUST STAY HERE? ALBERT! HONEY, WE THOUGHT YOU WERE FAST ASLEEP. Mrs. Partridge: COME ON, HONEY. LET'S GO BACK TO BED. MR. ANTOINE SAID HE WAS MY FATHER.

I FOOLED YOU, DIDN'T I? YES. YOU CERTAINLY FOOLED ME. AND MY FINGERS ARE GETTING STRONGER ALL THE TIME, AND MY WRIST. LOOK! SEE? SEE? IT'S ALL IN THE WRIST. Lorraine's voice: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: IN THE EVENT OF MY DEATH, PLEASE CONTACT MY FOSTER SISTER HARRIET FRANKLIN. EVEN THOUGH OUR LIVES HAVE GONE SEPARATE WAYS AND IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE WE'VE SPOKEN, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF HER AS THE GODMOTHER OF MY SON ALBERT, WHO I AM LEAVING IN HER CARE. I BELIEVE SHE WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR ALBERT... Man and Lorraine: "AS HARRIET AND I WERE ONCE THERE FOR ONE ANOTHER. Man: "SHE IS MOST LIKELY STILL IN NEWARK.

JANET, GET ME DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE FOR NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. LET ME ASK HARRIET, OK? HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HARRIET! CAN YOU HOLD ON ONE SECOND? WHAT IS IT? MIKE BELASCO'S CLAIMING WE OVER-DELIVERED ON THE COASTERS. PENNY, DID YOU REMEMBER TO VERIFY THE ORDER? VERBALLY AND IN WRITING, LIKE YOU SAID. BOB, CAN YOU HOLD ON ONE SECOND? IT'S SO BUSY HERE.

OH, YEAH. YEAH. YOU JUST LET ME KNOW, OK? THANKS. BYE-BYE. ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. SOMEBODY FROM LAS VEGAS ON LINE 2? SOMETHING ABOUT LORRAINE, YOUR SISTER? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A SISTER. HELLO. Attorney: HELLO. MISS FRANKLIN? YEAH. MISS FRANKLIN, MY NAME IS CLAY THRASHER. I'M A LAWYER AT THE HOTEL WHERE LORRAINE FRANKLIN HAS BEEN WORKING. Harriet, on speakerphone: UH-OH. WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT, IS SHE IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE? I'M AFRAID IT'S WORSE THAN TROUBLE, MISS FRANKLIN. LORRAINE WAS KILLED LAST WEEK IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. WHAT DID YOU SAY? LORRAINE WAS KILLED LAST WEEK IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. YOU ARE LORRAINE'S FOSTER SISTER, IS THAT CORRECT, MISS FRANKLIN? YOU'RE TELLING ME LORRAINE IS DEAD? MISS FRANKLIN, THIS IS RUTH CLARK. I WAS LORRAINE'S BEST FRIEND. WE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU SOONER, EXCEPT... WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU. WE'RE SORRY TO BREAK THE NEWS TO YOU THIS WAY, MISS FRANKLIN. OH, NO. I... I UNDERSTAND, AND THANK YOU FOR CALLING. NO, NO. PLEASE DON'T HANG UP. MISS FRANKLIN, THERE'S SOMETHING MORE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT? Ruthie: IT'S ABOUT ALBERT--LORRAINE'S LITTLE BOY. LORRAINE HAD A LITTLE BOY? NOW, WHAT I HAVE BEFORE ME, MISS FRANKLIN, ARE SOME DOCUMENTS NAMING YOU THE BOY'S GUARDIAN. WHAT? ! OH. OH! NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. I... UH-UH. NO. YOU KNOW, FIRST YOU TELL ME LORRAINE IS DEAD, AND NOW YOU TELL ME SHE'S GOT A KID, AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SPRING ON ME THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT? HE'S NOT AN ORDINARY BOY, MISS FRANKLIN. Ruthie: HE'S REALLY A WONDERFUL BOY, HARRIET. Antoine: HE'S A MAGICAL BOY. WAS THAT HIM? WHO WAS THAT? I'M ANTOINE. Harriet: WHO? ALBERT'S GOOD FRIEND. Ruthie: THE PROBLEM IS THAT RIGHT NOW, HE IS A HOMELESS BOY. Harriet: WELL, WHAT ABOUT HIS FATHER? WE CAN'T FIND THE FATHER. THERE IS NO FATHER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THERE IS NO FATHER? THE BOY WASN'T IMMACULATELY CONCEIVED, WAS HE? LISTEN, YOU PEOPLE, LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU. I DON'T HAVE A MOTHERLY BONE IN MY BODY, OK? I'M NOT A MOTHER. I DON'T WANT TO BE A MOTHER. NOW, I ALSO ASSUME THAT THIS LITTLE BOY IS WHITE, IS HE NOT? HAVE YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT? YEAH--JUST A SMALL ONE. 'CAUSE I'M BLACK, TOO, YOU KNOW, AND I THINK THAT YOUR SISTER WOULD BE DAMNED UPSET WITH YOU IF SHE THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULDN'T TAKE ALBERT BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT BLACK GETS IN THE WAY! Harriet: THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. IT DIDN'T BOTHER HIS MOTHER, AND YOU GREW UP WITH WHITE FOLKS, DIDN'T YOU? WHAT HAS MY GROWING UP WITH WHITE FOLKS HAVE TO DO WITH ME RAISING SOME LITTLE WHITE BOY? IT'S WHO YOU ARE. YOU ARE THE CLOSEST THING THAT HE'S GOT TO BLOOD! YOU UNDERSTAND THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO PLACE HIM IN THE STATE SYSTEM, MISS FRANKLIN? NO-- GOD! WHAT HAPPENS NOW? BYE. BYE, ALBERT. Antoine: BON VOYAGE. ALBERT! DON'T YOU EVEN WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FRIENDS? NO. BYE-BYE, ALBERT! ALBERT, BYE-BYE. AU REVOIR!

AND I'LL BRING YOU A SNACK, AND AFTER THAT WE'LL DO LUNCH AND A MOVIE. OK, ALBERT? MERCI. HUH? I SAID, MERCI. [SOFTLY] JE VOUS EN PRIE. WHAT, SON? NOTHING. TU PARLES FRANCAIS? [WHISPERING] Mr. Antoine taught me je vous en prie and bonjour and comment ça va and merde! You know those? YOU TALKING TO ME, SON? UH-UH. I WONDER, COULD YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE BIGGER, MY AND RASPING) - All right, all right, all right! That's enough! Cor blimey! What are you teaching them? Cat's cradle? - Come on, underneath this lot. - (ALL COMPLAIN) - What do you think you're doing? - We'd better have a talk. - I've no wish to speak to you. - You'll have to. Take over, Wilson, will you? Won't take a minute. Hold that, Jones. - Now, look here... - No, YOU look here. My HQ is out of action. I have permission to use these premises. - On whose authority? - See for yourself. There you are. Now, I'm a reasonable sort of man. We've had our differences, but we are on the same side. I want to be generous. I don't want to... I don't want to, you know, be stand-offish. I'm prepared to go shares with you. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. This half, with your chair, you can have. This half here is me. Right? Draw a line here like this. Got it? - Down the wall... - Just a moment. What are you doing? When it comes to the desk, you keep your stuff over there. I'll keep my stuff over here. Right? - How dare you mark my desk? - I'm only trying to be fair. - I shall rub this out at once. - Then I shall chalk in again. I can chalk quicker than you can rub, mate. There. That'll be enough of that. Now, you've probably noticed both the doors are in my half. Now, I want to be fair. I'm going to draw a chalk line on the floor, and another one like this here. - That's Tom Tiddler's ground. - Oh, nonsense. You're standing on my bit. Get off. I have to insist on the telephone. That has to be on my side. Oh, no. That is my artery of communication. If Hitler invades, that is how I shall learn of it. It's my artery every time a siren sounds. If Hitler's coming, I'll take a message for you. That stays there. I'll give you five seconds to get out. - One, two, three, four, five. I'm not going. - Oh? Oh? Right. Wilson! Jones! Escort this person from my headquarters. - I'm staying. This is MY headquarters. - Carry my orders out. Would you mind awfully leaving the office? Look, I've got official permission. There it is in black and white. If you don't move out of here, you'll get this right up you and you will not like it. - Now, look here, Gandhi... - What? ! Look, you haven't heard the last of this. I'm telling you. - Well done, Jones. - The old cold steel, they cannot countenance it. Right, let's resume our lecture. - He's done it this time! - What is it? You look like a soul in torment. Fetch the vicar. It's Mainwaring. I have to sit down. I'm having a funny turn. - You sit down. I'll get His Reverence. - He threatened me with a bayonet. A bayonet! He who liveth by the sword shall die by the sword. And that goes for bayonets, and all. Now, you're not going over when I say "over". So let's do it in turns. All my file will say it first, then Wilson's file say it. Right, one, two, three. Over. Over. - Over. - Over. - That's better. - I've got it, sir. Can I do it on my own? - We're not quite ready for that. - Oh, let me go solo, sir. - Oh, very well. - This should be good. Hello, all stations. Charlie One. Hello, all stations. Charlie One. Report my signals, all stations. Charlie One. Over. That was very good, Jones. Excellent. Quite correct. Thank you very much, sir. I bet they all thought I couldn't do that. - You did it beautiful. - Yes, I'm not such a fool as I may think I am. All right, let's try it again. Tighten your strings. Right. Now, keep the strings tight. I have given Mr Hodges permission to use my office. He's been molested. Vicar, I'm busy. I'll see you in my office in 20 minutes' time. It is not your office. It is MY office, and I have lent it to Mr Hodges. - What did I say? I told him. - You did. You are interrupting vital training for the defence of the realm. Go away. I will not. I want to get to my office. Take your silly bits of string out of my way. - I will not. - I'll report you to the bishop and to the police. - Don't be so damn childish. - Don't profane His Reverence! - Don't let's have any impertinence from you. - Oh, so that's the way it is! Follow me, Vicar. Well, I think it's a cheek, Hodges using this as his ARP headquarters. Mainwaring won't be pushed around. He tried to cooperate, but Hodges is so dead common. - You're right there, Joe. He is common. - I can't stand common people. I don't think you're being fair. Mr Hodges does a good job as ARP warden. It's a dangerous job. I don't say he don't do it well. He does it uncouth. If only Mr Mainwaring had put a curse on him. A curse? How can he put a curse on anybody? - I've seen it done. - When? Oh, nigh on 50 years ago, when I was trading coral in the South Seas with a friend of mine. Was that the one that got eaten by a squid? No, son. This was a different friend. Jethro, his name was. One day, we were anchored off a wee island about 20 miles west of Samoa. Jethro told me that he'd heard that there was a ruined temple in the centre of the island, with a huge idol that had a ruby the size of a duck's egg set in its forehead. He was determined to get it. As soon as it was dark, we rowed ashore armed to the teeth and set off through the jungle to find the temple. After about two hours hacking our way through the undergrowth, we came to a clearing. And there was the temple, the ruined temple, covered with jungle creepers. The place was deserted. We crept inside and there it was. A huge idol with a great ruby in its forehead. As the shafts o' moonlight struck down through the holes in the roof, it burned like fire. Jethro gave a cry of triumph, jumped up on the idol and hacked the ruby out of its forehead wi' his knife. All this time, I could feel eyes... horrible, unseen eyes staring at us. I could stand it no longer. I shouted, "Let's get out!" And we turned to go. And then we saw it. Barring our way in the doorway was the witch doctor. He gave a scream that turned my blood tae ice. He shook a bunch of bones in Jethro's face, and he cursed him! After all these years, I can... I can still hear that terrible curse. "Death!" he screamed. "Death! "The ruby will bring ye death! "Dea-ath!" Did the curse come true, Mr Frazer? Aye, son, it did. He died... last year. He was 86. Right, on parade, all of you! Come on, do as the officer says! Fall in in three lines! Open order. Take the mark from me. Thank you, Corporal. Now, I've had a word with area HQ, the civil defence people and the secretary of the council, who happens to be a fellow Rotarian. I assure you, I gave them a piece of my mind. These ARP people will be cleared out of here. - But not this week. - But not this... All right, I'll tell them. In the meantime, we'll behave in a true Christian manner and, as far as possible, ignore them. Left, right! Left, right! Right wheel! Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Right wheel! Mark...time! Halt! Left turn! Very smart. Right dress! Home Guard, left dress! All right, that's enough of that, Mainwaring. - You started it. - Stay in your own half. - I've got twice as many troops as you. - Call these troops? The Bath chair fusiliers. (ALL COMPLAIN) - Would you like a bunch of fives up the hooter? - He's already had one. - That's brave, innit? Ten to one. - This town's not big enough for both of us. Don't start anything! How dare you push me? - (SIREN) - Hello, they're here. - Saved by the bell. - I'll sort you out later. To your posts! - To your duties, men. - Mrs Cole, telephone. Miss Robertson, map. Make up your defence points at the Marigold Tearooms. Patrol from there to Timothy White's. Get the fire going. We might be here all night. Jones, keep your section in reserve here. And keep that over your side! Now, look, Hodges. I'm doing my best to tolerate your presence, but you're being insufferable. You'll never get it alight like that. The wood's damp. You want a firelighter. - I haven't got any. - I can help you there. - That'll get it going. Ninepence to you. - Oh, thanks. Hey, Joe! Hold on, son. That's trading with the enemy. Yes, right. Thank you very much. Let me have a report in the morning. Thank you. Right... Oi! Cut that out. Not during an alert. I shall be receiving a stream of reports on that. And I shall be receiving my orders from the War Office. (PHONE RINGS) Walmington ARP. Number One Platoon, Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard! Yes. It is for you, Captain Mainwaring. Of course. Good evening, sir. Captain Mainwaring here. Oh. Hello, Elizabeth. You can pack that in, chats with your bits of stuff. - This happens to be my good lady. - Tell her to cut it short. No, no, no, I've... What? Of course I can't come home. Not just now. If you're frightened, why don't you sit in the cupboard under the stairs, as usual? A bomb is far more dangerous than a mouse. Look, careless talk costs lives. - There you are. Try another one. - I expect some sparrow's laid a nest up there. They do a lot of that, laying nests, in the top of the chimney. We can have some roast sparrow. Very tasty, very sweet. - Ah, that's better. - Blimey! Here, what are those made of, Joe? They're mostly made from incendiary bombs. What? That stove is not to be ignited without the consent of the vicar. - What? It's only a fire. - He'll be told. There'll be a rumpus. Who lit it? - The wardens. - The wardens? Did they? Cheers the place up, a nice fire, doesn't it? Yes, well, perhaps if you made a big noise, the mouse would jump down the hole. Look, leave the mouse where it is and YOU jump down the hole. - How dare you? ! - That wasn't very kind. You keep out of this, dear. I haven't received a single report yet. - (RINGS) - Hello. Yes, yes. Righto, Mr Yeldon. Thank you very much. Mr Yeldon. They're standing by in Khyber Road. - (RINGS) - Hello. Yes. Chimney on fire? Right, give me the details, will you? - Yes, fine. Get this down, Mrs Cole. - Yes. There's... That's the end, dear. Look, we can't have vital communications blocked by this trivia. There's nothing trivial about a chimney on fire. An enemy bomber could see it miles away. Where is it? Right. A large building next to St Aldhelm's Church, Mortimer Road. Ready. - A large building next to St... - A large...? - Large... A large building. - Large... Building, yes. Next to St Aldhelm's... Worse than your lot, she is. Mortimer Road. - Road? - Road. R-O-A-D. Right. Get on to the fire brigade. - Now what are you up to? - Please, Vicar, we're busy. - Do you realise you've set the chimney on fire? - The stove has become a raging fiery furnace! Fiery furnace? Just a minute. This is a large building next to St Aldhelm's Church. Cor blimey! Get out of the way! - He lit it. - His firelighters did it. Normally they don't burn. - Wilson? - It happened in the nursery. Nanny used salt. Blimey, it's a fire, not a pigeon. Sir, I have the fire brigade now. Shall I ask them to pop round? Certainly not. Make us a laughing stock? Gerald, you and I, up the tower. - With the pumps? - Yes. Excuse me, Mr Mainwaring. Do you have the key of the cupboard? I can bring bandages. Bog peat, Mr Mainwaring! One barrel of bog peat would put that fire out. - Be sensible. - I've seen it. Mr Mainwaring! Mr Mainwaring! Captain Mainwaring! Captain Mainwaring! - What is it, Jones? - The chimney's on fire. - I know that! - Yes, well, if you lean out, sir, you can see. It's like a Roman candle, all the sparks. You've got to be careful, sir, because there's a 40-foot drop down here, you know... Agh! Oh, thank you, Mr Mainwaring. You saved my life. I won't forget that, Mr Mainwaring. - Oh, get out of the way. Pike, give me a lift up. - Yes, sir. - Get inside, Jones. - I can't, Mr Mainwaring. I'm sitting on the window catch and it's made of cold steel, and every time I move it goes in a funny position and I don't like it, Mr Mainwaring. Now, look. There's a ledge out here. I'm going to inch along it and see if I can get to the roof. What's going on? Get out of the way! This is an ARP matter. Come on, off there. - I'm in an embarrassing position. - What? - His trousers are hooked. - Get your trousers off. - Not in front of His Reverence. - Come on, get your trousers off! Stop it! Stop it! Get out of it! - What's going on here? Leave him alone. - They're trying to take my trousers off. Don't be neurotic, Jones. - Wilson! - Yes, sir. There's a gap between the tower and the roof. Hand me a plank. I'll put it across. - I haven't got a plank. Why should I have one? - Here's a ladder. What about that? Well done. Well done, Walker. Shove it out. - Oh! - What's the matter? I have relieved myself, sir. It's quite all right. - He's not very nice, is he? - Hang on. I can't do it that way. Hang on. - Get it off the banisters. Right. - Here we go. - No! Let me in! - Back inside. Oh, thank you, Mr Mainwaring. Thank you. You saved my life. I won't forget that. - Grab the ladder. - Get it on the edge of the sill. Hurry up! A German bomber will see that chimney on fire for miles. All right. Careful, careful, careful. Jones! Get up! Oh, thank you, Mr Mainwaring. You saved my life again. Come on, now. Round the corner. - Mind that crumbling bit on the corner. - Right, sir. Right, sir. There we are. Blimey, I don't like this. I get verdigris terrible. Where are you going with that bucket of sand? I've been polishing that hall for 30 years, sir. I can't see it go up like a bundle of kindling. Right, I think it's firm enough now. Right, sir. I will test it. I'll test the ladder. - Hurry up, you old fool. Don't talk so much. - Righto. All right so far. Jones, when you get on the other side, edge your way along the roof. - See if you can reach... - Right, sir. See if you can reach the chimney from there. Pike, Walker. Get down on the catwalk and see if you can work your pump from there. Go across? - They need water. - There are buckets down in the hall. - Come on, Godfrey. Aren't you coming? - No, I'm going to pass it through. Come on, grandad! Hurry up! Come on, Verger. Mr Mainwaring! Mr Mainwaring! If I had a... If I had a bucket of water, I could throw it down the chimney. Pass water. Pass the word back for water. - Hurry up, hurry up! - There you are. - More. - Oh, Lord! - Water coming! - Water coming! - Water coming! - Water coming! Water coming... Oh! Missed! More water! More water! (VERGER) I've still got a bucket of sand here. (WARDEN) Well, go and... Water coming! Missed! More water! - Blimey! How much more? Are you ready, Joe? - Yeah, almost. You're not having this one. I'm gonna do it. More water! Start pumping, Joe! (JONES) More water! More water! Get more water! - More water! - Get more water... Agh! You saved my life! You remind me of Mr Mainwaring. More water! Come along! More water! Come along. - All right, quick as we can. - More water! - It's your church. Get it yourself. - I agree. Go on, Godfrey. Get some more water. Mr Mainwaring! Mr Mainwaring! If I slide down the roof, I can get next to the chimney. I'll draw myself up to my full height and I will pour the water down the chimney. - Don't talk so much and get on with it! - Very good, sir. Right away, sir. It hot! It's hot in a funny place, sir! I can't, sir. I'm on fire! I'm on fire! Don't worry, Mr Jones. I'll put you out. Start pumping, Joe! - Mr Mainwaring! - What? I think they've put me out. - The fire's gone out. - How did that happen? When I went down the last time, I put some salt on it. Well done, my men! Get back to the tower. Careful how you go. You be careful, Mr Mainwaring. This ladder's poised on the edge of the... It's smashed to smithereens, sir. You'll have to stay up there for a wee while. - Wilson! - Yes? - Go to the builder's yard and get a ladder. - That'll take half an hour. Get the fire brigade. - Not likely. - You're dry. I'm soaking wet. That's your fault for chucking water about. - You wouldn't say that if you was wet! - Oh, yes, I would. (THUNDER) Now's your chance to try, innit? - Wilson! - What is it now? Perhaps if the fire brigade aren't doing anything else, they wouldn't mind popping round. # Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler # If you think we're on the run? # We are the boys who will stop your little game # We are the boys who will make you think again # 'Cause who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler # If you think old England's done? # Mr Brown goes off to town on the 8.21 # But he comes home each evening and he's ready with his gun # So who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler # If you think old England's done? # Ah. Captain Mainwaring and the Walmington-on-Sea Platoon are a bit late. They're using their own transport, sir. It's a butcher's van. They made it into an armoured car. - Very ingenious, these Home Guards. - Yes, sir. They're very keen as well. - A bit too keen if you ask me. - You all right, sir? Oh, it's this damn twitch I've developed. I've been running this school of explosives for over a year now. Only when we got Home Guards for weekend courses did I get a confounded twitch! - You could do with a spot of leave, sir. - They've no idea of the danger. They're mad keen, charging all over the place. One of these days, they'll blow themselves sky-high! I just know it! Never mind, sir. This is the last of them. The sooner we get them through the course the better. Then you can sleep easy, sir. All I can say is roll on tomorrow night! - Hello. - (HORN BEEPS) (MAINWARING BARKS ORDERS) This lot sounds even more keen than the others, sir. Oh, Lord! All right, Sergeant Major. Look after them. - Right, then. Bring them all in. - Thank you, Sergeant Major. Captain Mainwaring, Walmington-on-Sea, reporting for duty, sir. - Sergeant Wilson, Lance Corporal Jones. - Sir! We can't wait to get training. - We haven't handled any live grenades before. - Haven't you? - I can't wait to get my hands on them. - Neither can I, Captain Mainwaring. I don't know which I like best - the bayonet or the bomb. I'm fond of them both, of course. I like Mills bombs best. I've always wanted to meet that Mr Mills. He must have been very clever. In 1916 when I was in France, I used to lob those bombs over, one at a time. Pin out, over, bang! Over...bang! They used to call me the Mad Bomber. I'm not mad, really, you know, sir. I'm as sane as you are. Oh, really? If you'll excuse me, I've got rather a lot to do. Make yourselves comfortable. He's a bit historical, isn't he, sir? Yes. Let's go and get our bedding. I think Pike is bringing my stuff in, sir. Look, we can't have anybody waiting on us in this platoon, Wilson. This is a democratic unit. We eat, sleep and fight together. Rank doesn't come into it. Here's your bedding, Uncle Arthur. Pike, in future you will not wait on Sergeant Wilson. - We're all equal here. - Shall I take it out again? Frank, please, don't be absurd. Over there. - Right. Mum says don't walk on it in your boots. - All right! Here, we've got to sleep on the ground, have we? It's either that or stand up all night! - It won't do my rheumatics much good. - Ach, don't be so peely-wally. It'll make your back go straight. At my age, it's already decided which way it wants to go. (MAINWARING BARKS ORDERS) - Uncle Arthur? - What is it, Frank? Have you seen Mr Snuggly? - Mr who? - Mr Snuggly, my teddy. No, I haven't. - Mum said she'd put him in. - Well, I haven't got him. - I can't get to sleep without him. - I haven't seen him. - Have a look in your bed. - All right. - Ah, yes. Here he is. - Don't let anybody see him! - I thought you wanted him. - If they see him, they might laugh. - Wrap him in the towel and hand him over. - All right. What have you got there, Wilson? Er... Mr... - Mr Snuggly. - What? ! He's my...my bear. My... My teddy bear. I can't get off without him. Extraordinary (! ) - Here. - Thank you, Uncle Arthur. - What are you doing, Jonesy? - Making me bed. You gonna grow strawberries in it? ! - Of course not! - What you got that net on it for? For mosquitoes. A mosquito net. What? There's no mosquitoes here, you silly old duffer! But it goes with the bed, doesn't it? We've been together for 50 years. - # And it don't seem a day too much! # - I was very glad of this net in the Sudan. It doesn't just keep out mosquitoes. It keeps out snakes an' all. Snakes tried to get into bed with you? Yeah. Snakes? It's cold out in the desert. Them snakes used to come in and try to snuggle in beside you. Urgh. It's all right. They're not cold and slimy. They're all warm and soft. There's one used to come round every night round my tent. And round my net. What did I call him? Charlie, I called him. His little face used to look in through the net, a little pathetic look in his eyes as if to say, "I'm cold. Let me come in." I never let him in, though. I don't like that sort of thing, you know. - Everything all right? - Yes, my chaps are settling in, thank you. - Good, good. Where are you sleeping? - Here. - You're not sleeping with the men, are you? - Yes. Oh, my dear fellow. Can't have that. Bad for discipline. - Oh. Do you really think so? - Definitely, old boy. It's just not on. - We officers have got to stick together. - I usually muck in with my chaps. My dear fellow, it's a mistake. Where would it all end? You take a tip from me. You rig up separate quarters for yourself and your sergeant. Look here, I'll see you later. - All right. - Grub up! Come and get it! - Let's get our tea! I'm famished! - What is it, sir? What? - Wait till they've all gone. - I thought I'd get some food, sir. - That'll wait till later. This is important. - What is? I, uh... I think you and I had better sleep together. - Together? - Away from the others. I'm awfully sorry. I don't quite follow you. I've come to the conclusion that it's very bad for discipline to sleep with the ORs. - ORs? - Other ranks. But you said we were all going to eat, sleep and fight together. Yes. From now on, we'll just eat and fight together. Give me a hand with this blanket. # It's a hap-hap-happy day Toodle-oodle-oodle-oodle-oodle-ay # For you and me... # - That was a wizard tea. - Aye, you're right. It wisnae half bad. You know, they're doing their very best to make us feel comfortable. - That seed cake was nice, wasn't it? - The caraway seeds give me indigestion. - Then why did you bring that bit back? - I'll eat it later after I pick the seeds out. Silly old fool! Hello. What's this? "Officers and sergeants only." - Ohh (! ) - I wonder why Mr Mainwaring's done that. It's obvious. He's getting ideas above his station. He really thinks he is an officer! So he is. He deserves a little privacy. Rubbish! Rubbish! We're a civilian army and he's only holding a wartime commission. - Jonesy, come on. - Boys, come and look at this. Ha! "Officers and sergeants only"? ! That's a bit strong, innit? Mr Mainwaring's not like that. He usually mucks in with all of us. So, chaps, did you have a nice tea? I think we'll be very comfortable here. I'm going to play some gramophone records. Any requests? What about "Don't Fence Me In"? I haven't got that one, Frazer. 'Ere, Sergeant, why's Mr Mainwaring gone all toffee-nosed? Well, I think he...got the impression that it was bad for discipline for us to sleep with the "ors". Well, the...other ranks. - Oh, other ranks, yeah. - ORs. - (MAINWARING) Sergeant Wilson! - Yes? Come in here, will you? I want you to wind the gramophone. Go away, boy. Right, sir. - What's the matter with Frazer? - Nothing as far as I know, sir. His manner's very offhand and downright rude. And he's upsetting the others. What makes you say that? I detected a distinct change in the atmosphere. The men were surly and sullen. - I'm very sensitive about these things. - Perhaps you upset them. Don't be absurd. I've hardly spoken to them. No, no. Frazer. - You don't think he's a Communist? - What on earth makes you say that, sir? Well... He has the look of a Communist about him to me. I've noticed that when we're on night duty, he never plays Monopoly with the rest of the men. - Oh, really, sir. - It's all very well to laugh. Pay attention. You're all off duty until lights out at 2200 hours. There's a free issue of two pints of beer each in the canteen. We're not giving you any more because Captain Reed wants you to have a steady hand when you throw those bombs! Well, Sergeant Major, you can tell Captain Reed not to worry. We shall be there, ready and steady. That should cheer him up no end (! ) What did the Sergeant Major want? He says there's two free pints of beer for everyone in the canteen. Oh, splendid. We'll have a convivial evening. There you are. How about coming to the mess for a drink? - What mess? - The officers' mess. - We could have a chota peg or two. - We were just all off to the NAAFI. Oh, my hat. Come here. There's no harm in having the odd drink with the men, but don't overdo it. - Oh, no, only a couple of pints. - All the other officers will be in the mess. If you don't turn up, they'll think you're a bit...odd. - Will they really? I wouldn't want that. - Of course not. - Hang on a minute. I'll get my cap. - Good fellow. - I say, Wilson... - Yes? Awful bore, but... I've got to go and have a drink in the officers' mess. - Oh, what a shame! - Yes. - You won't be coming with us, then? - No, I won't. If I don't go, they'll... they'll think I'm a bit odd, you see. - You do understand, don't you? - Of course I do, yes. - You don't want to look odd. - No, of course I don't. I'd ask you to come with us, but...officers only, you know. - Well, see the chaps have a good time. - Yes. - Seen my cap anywhere? - Er... Oh, thank you very much. Stupid boy. Well, have a good time, chaps. And...don't do anything I wouldn't do. Come on, Main-waring. Come along. And there it was - hanging out of the window as large as life! Hello, fellows! Hello, hello. Now, let me introduce you all. Main-waring, Walmington-on-Sea Platoon. Pritchard, HQ. And Ashley-Jones, Dimwich Platoon. Take your belt off, old boy. Now where are we? Same again, what? Three large whiskies. - What are you having, Main-waring? - Sweet sherry, please. - Sweet sherry (! ) - Sorry, sir. We've only got whisky. Damn glad to have it, too! Make it four large whiskies. - I don't think I can manage a large whisky. - Don't tell me you don't drink. Oh, I have a pint of beer after parade and the odd sherry. A spot of whisky won't do you any harm. Sit down, sit down. It's so damn hard to get. Drink it when you can, Main-waring. Dash, there I go calling you Main-waring. You call it Mainwaring, don't you? I knew a chap out in India, called himself Chumley, spelt his name Cholmondeley. Absolute idiot. We used to call him Chilli Mushrooms. Chilli Mush...! How frightfully amusing! Terribly clever. Chilli Mushrooms. Thank you, thank you. Well... Cheers, everybody. - So sorry. Cheers. - Cheers. (WILSON) Cheers. (MEN) Cheers. - This is the end. - Eh? I said this is the end. No, it isn't. I've got another full bottle here. As soon as I get back, I'm resigning. You can't, Taffy. Your country needs you (! ) I'll be there when I'm needed, but I'm not serving under Mainwaring any more. - Uncle Arthur? - What is it, Frank? Would you like to finish my beer? Well, no, thank you. No. I'm not really in a drinking mood, for some reason. I don't think Captain Mainwaring is to blame. I think Captain Square led him astray. As an old member of the platoon, you ought to give him another chance. Ach, you silly old fool. There's no call for you to talk to Private Godfrey like that, Jock. - Well, he IS a silly old fool! Calling me old! - Well, you ARE old! - Not as old as you! - I'm not as old as you are, you silly old fool! I'm not 60 yet. Blimey! You told me you tried to relieve General Gordon in Khartoum! You must be over 90! I was a boy soldier. - Did they pin a medal on your napkin? - Walker! Old Bungy rode his polo pony right through the mess! And the punka-wallah, who was asleep, went on pulling the punka with his foot! Oh, by Jove! What a night that was! Here you are, old boy. - No, no, no more for me, please. - Nonsense. You must keep up. - Whatever happened to old Bungy? - I never saw him after that. Good chap, good chap. You know what his trouble was, don't you? Couldn't leave the little brown girls alone. Oh, dear. I remember one night in the mess at Jabalpore when we made him a cardinal! - How did he take that? - He went through it like a lamb. Good heavens, that takes me back. I haven't seen that for donkey's years. How...how do you make someone a cardinal? It was a ceremony we'd go through in the mess in the old days. - What did you have to do? - Why? Do you want to be made one? I might. It's all right for us old soldiers, but I think you might find it a bit much. I don't see why I should. I'd like to be made a cardinal. What? What? Well... Shall we make him one, boys? All right, then. Here we go. I'll try and put you in the picture. It goes rather like this. Now, here's to the health of Cardinal Puff for the first time. And you tap the table once with the first finger of your right hand, then your left hand, stamp your right foot once, left foot once, bang the glass on the table once and you take one drink. Now, here's to the health of Cardinal Puff Puff for the second time. And you tap the table with the first two fingers of your right hand twice and the first two fingers of your left hand twice, stamp your right foot twice, left foot twice, bang the glass on the table twice and you take two drinks, you see. - Ah. - Here... Here's to the health of Cardinal Puff Puff Puff for the third and last time. And you tap the table with the first, second and third finger of your right hand thrice, and with the first, second and third finger of your left hand thrice, and you stamp your right foot thrice and your left foot thrice and you bang the glass on the table thrice - one, two, three - and you take three drinks, you see. - Now, have you got that? - Not quite. I'll go through it again for you. Listen. Here's to the health of... This commercial traveller, he says to the landlady, he says to the landlady, "I'm sorry, madam, but I am un..." No, wait a minute. He says, "No, no, I'm sorry. I do not work between Mondays and Fridays." (JONES LAUGHS) Well, I thought it was funny. Hey, I know some jokes. God's sake! Listen, I've got tuppence in that hand... Uncle Arthur? I've got tuppence in that hand. - How much have I got? - Fourpence. No, wrong. Sixpence. I've got tuppence in my pocket! Three tomatoes going across the desert. Which one's the cowboy? No idea. None of them. They're all redskins. - Here's another... - No. No, listen. Why did the submarine blush? - Why did the submarine blush? - Don't nudge me. Do you give up? 'Cause he saw Queen Mary's bottom. I don't think Queen Mary would like that. Sorry, Uncle Arthur. And you bang the glass on the table three times... and you take three drinks. Now do you see it? - Yes, I think I've got it. - Good. Come along, chaps. Now, if you go wrong, you've got to drain the glass and go right back to the beginning. - Right. - Good luck. Here's to the health of Cardinal Puff for the first time. Wrong! - You didn't bang the table with the glass once. - Oh, yes, so sorry. Right, right. - Here's... - Drain the glass, old boy! Drain the glass. There we go. Just listen to them, will you? It's a disgrace, a perfect disgrace. I don't know what's come over Mainwaring. He was never like this. I tell you, when I was out in the Sudan, there was some terrible goings-on in the officers' mess. It was absolutely alarming. But if you drunk too much out in that heat, it would turn you into a gibbering idiot! Blimey! You must have knocked a bit back! Here... Here's to the health... ..of Cardinal Puff... Puff... Puff Puff... Wrong! - What was... What was wrong there? - Puff Puff Puff Puff! Ha! What was wrong...? What was wrong...? What was wrong with that? - Wrong with what? - Puff Puff Puff Puff. - Too many Puffs! - You're absolutely right. I should have said... Here's to the health of Cardinal Puff Puff Puff. Not Cardinal Puff Puff Puff Puff. - What? - Start again, start again. Here's to the he...the heal... Here's to the health... of the Archbishop of Canterbury! What's that got to do with it? It's all the same thing. It's all religious, isn't it? It's the wrong denomination! The wrong denom...denomination? Yes. RC, not C of E. Yes. - Right. - Start again. Here's to the health... of the Duchess of York... ..who's a friend of Cardinal Puff Puff Puff Puff! - Start again! Start again! - Here's... Ohh! Start again. And drain the glass. I'll drain the bloody glass. (DRUNKEN SINGING) # Puff Puff Puff Puff... # Shh! Damn revolving doors! Got him! I've got him! I've got the intruder! Come on, boys! I've got the intruder! I've got him! I've got him! I've got... Oh! I'm sorry, Mr Mainwaring. I thought you was a Thuggee. No, you're quite mistaken, Colonel. I'm Cardinal Puff Puff Puff... Puff! - Bless you, sir. - Thank you very much. # Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo? # Right, let's see. Eastgate, Littlebourne-on-Sea and Dimwich Platoons. - They've all thrown one grenade each. - (EXPLOSIONS) What was that? What was that? I heard two going off at once! Walmington-on-Sea, sir. He's trying to finish them quickly. If he's not careful, they'll finish him quickly! They're mad. Especially that lunatic Lance Corporal. - (GROANING) - What's that? Oh. Are you all right, Captain Mainwaring? You look ill. - What time is it? - 11.30. Where are my...? Oh! Where are my men? All down at the bombing range. I'm giving them a lecture on sticky bombs. Oh, good, good. I'll come with you. - Are you sure you feel up to it? - Of course. I wouldn't miss the bombing for anything. Carry on. (EXPLOSION) That covers the nine main points of the sticky bomb. Now, before we put it to any practical use, are there any questions? - Right. Carry on, Sergeant Major. - Sir! Right, now, that is a Nazi tank there. Righto. Line up. You're first, Sergeant. Ah, yes. Would you mind...? - Thank you. - Now, you walk smartly up to the tank. Don't run. Pull the pin out, the cover falls off and you press the bomb firmly to the side of the tank, to which it will adhere. Once the glass breaks inside the bomb, you've got 15 seconds. - Oh, yes? - Don't pull the pin out! Don't pull it out! All right. I wasn't going to. Right, now, I want you all to go to the tank with him so you get the hang of it. Whatever you do, don't run. Understand? Don't run. You don't want to attract the attention of the enemy. And you don't want to fall flat on your faces and blow yourselves up! - Right, now, off you go. - (SHRILL BLAST) Turn! Don't run. Don't run! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Right, down! Right, Corporal, you're next. Now, don't run, whatever you do. Don't run. Understand? - I shall assume a nonchalant manner, sir. - Get on with it, Jones. (WHISTLE) Left, right, left, right, left, right. Left, right, left, right, left, right. Turn! He's got it! Don't panic! - Right! - (EXPLOSION) Right, take it steady. And don't fire till I say. Right! Fire! (EXPLOSION) Not bad at all. Next! We've nearly finished, Jones. Jones! Jones? - We've nearly finished now. - Oh. - Move the van off when I give the signal. - Right, sir. - I'll bang on the back. - You'll bang on the back, sir. - You ready, lad? - Yes, sir. Fire! I think it's broken. You silly lad! Here, let me do it. It still won't go, sir. Ooh! There's no need to bang as loud as that, Mr Mainwaring! Blimey! - Hang on, hang on. - All right, Wilson. I'll handle this. We're with you, sir! # And in the meantime # Think of me, do # Cleaning my rifle and dreaming of you # Jones! Jones! Jones! (JONES) # La-la-la-la # And in the meantime # Think of me, do # Cleaning my rifle and thinking of you... # - Jones! Jones! - Mr Mainwaring! How did you get there? - Quick! Stop the van! - What? - Stop the van! There's a live grenade in it! - What, sir? What, sir? A live grenade? A live grenade! Don't panic! Don't panic! - Get out. - Yes, sir! Stop it first, you idiot! Ohh! Jones! Jones! Take cover! That lot could blow up at any second! There are 200 grenades in that van! If that lot goes up, it'll put the whole defence of the county out of action. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure! - Come back, you fool! - Come back, Mr Mainwaring! - Think of Mrs Mainwaring and the men! - Careful, sir. We'd really rather not lose you! Got it! Oh! Well done, Mr Mainwaring! Very good. Well do... # Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler # If you think we're on the run? # We are the boys who will stop your little game # We are the boys who will make you think again # 'Cause who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler # If you think old England's done? # Mr Brown goes off to town on the 8.21 # But he comes home each evening and he's ready with his gun # So who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler # If you think old England's done? # There we were, in the desert, no food and, what was worse, no water. And Johnny Turk sniping at us all the time. Ha-ha-ha! My tongue was so swollen, it filled my entire mouth. I would have sold my soul to the devil for a drink. - Would you like another, sir? - Thank you, Sergeant. Very good of you. Same again, please. We don't see you gentlemen from the Eastgate platoon in these parts very often. - We're here about the big exercise on Sunday. - What exercise is that? - All the local Home Guard units are taking part. - That's enough, Sergeant. Careless talk, you know, what? Careless talk, eh? Ha-ha-ha! Now, where-where-where was I? In the desert, dying of thirst. Oh, thank you so much. Yes. Cheers. Yes, as I was saying, my tongue was absolutely black. Then I remembered the old trick of sucking a pebble. Only trouble was, no pebbles in the desert, what? Ha-ha-ha! Nothing but sand, don't you know? Then I had an idea, and I pulled out my gold hunter. Beautiful watch, belonged to my father. It's even got an alarm. I popped that in my mouth and left it there for three days. There's no doubt about it, that watch saved my life. - That's a remarkable story. - I'll tell you something more remarkable. When I took that watch out, it was going perfectly. It hadn't lost or gained a second. I'll prove it. I'll pop this in my mouth for a few minutes and you'll see. I'll just set the alarm. There. Oh, well, I must say, I could do with a glass of beer, sir. - I look forward to my pint after the parade. - Oh, Lord! There's that old bore, Captain Square. I wonder what he's doing here. I suppose he's over from Eastgate about Sunday. Let's go to the other end of the bar. Good evening, Mr Mainwaring. Mr Wilson. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) What the devil's he doing with a watch in his mouth? Perhaps he's, er...watching his drink. - Just a little play on words, do you see, sir? - Oh, really, Wilson. Your sense of humour gets more childish every day. - (ALARM) - Ah! There we are! And still going. What did I tell you? Ha-ha-ha! This calls for another drink. I'm so sorry, Main-waring. You were first. After you. - No, please. Carry on. - The same again, then, please. - Well, are you looking forward to Sunday? - Should be an interesting day. You'll find it difficult capturing that mill with us inside. - How will you get across that open ground? - I dare say a way will be found. Now, gentlemen, it's your turn. Sorry to keep you waiting. Pints? - Yes, please. - Thanks very much, yes. - Sorry, gents. No more beer. - Well, that's nice. # When that man is dead and gone... # And so, gentlemen, this is without doubt the most difficult exercise that we have so far tackled. To sum up, here is the windmill. Inside, Captain Square and the Eastgate platoon. Wall here. River here. Boathouse here, and here and here, bushes and trees. Around the windmill is open ground. Not a scrap of cover. Our job is to get across that open ground and plant a high explosive inside the windmill. Any suggestions? - Permission to speak, sir? - Yes. - What about a tunnel, sir? - A tunnel? Yes, sir. We all go round behind that wall and we can dig a hole in a downward direction. Down and down, then suddenly you start digging sideways, sideways, sideways. When we think we're under the mill, start digging upwards, upwards, upwards. And, God willing, we'll be in the mill. Or else in Australia. I think you're in the realms of fantasy again, Jones. There he goes again with "realms of fantasy". He's playing with fire. I control his meat. I've got an idea, sir. There was some play of Shakespeare's, I can't remember which one. There was some sort of king who invited his troops to dress up as bushes... ..so that they could move across the open ground in order to attack the castle. - Yes. Dress them up as bushes? - That's right. Yes. Sounds a very good idea. I... - You going to be polishing long, Verger? - I've got to keep the place clean. The state you leave it in is a disgrace. Do it some other time. You're getting on my nerves creeping around with that miserable face. This happens to be my normal expression. You can't be a verger with a funny face, you know. You seem to have managed all right. - Yeah, get out. - That's what they treat me like. Dirt. Sorry about that, gentlemen. Where were we up to? Sir, get one of us inside a dummy log, then we can float down the river to the mill. - That should do the trick. - That's a rather good idea, Walker. But someone has to push the log and we can't stay underwater. - Get someone in a diving suit to push the log. - Don't be absurd! Who's got a diving suit? - I've got a diving suit. - You have? How did you come by that? I was in the South Seas with a friend of mine, Willy Stewart. We were diving for pearls. One day he was down below doing the job and I was up on deck with the native boys working the pumps. Suddenly, I felt four pulls on his lifeline. That means "haul me up". I knew there was trouble. I looked down - the sea's as clear as crystal - and there was Willy fighting for his life with a giant squid. I never hesitated. I dived down and down into the depths. I plunged my knife between those two hideous eyes. My lungs were bursting, a red mist before my eyes. The sea was black with the inky liquid from the squid. I gave the signal and they quickly pulled Willy up. I went on deck and unscrewed his helmet and then...then I realised they'd pulled him up too quickly. He was dying from the dreaded bends. I cradled him in my arms and he gazed up at me and said, "Look after my poor old mother. "See that she gets all my property." Well, all he had was his diving suit and it was no use to her, so I gave her ten bob and kept it. Every time after that, whenever I went down in that diving helmet I could hear poor Willy's voice crying, "Help. "He-e-e-e-elp." So... we take it you have a diving suit, Frazer. - Permission to speak, sir? - Yes. I'll ask the vicar to borrow that imitation log he uses in his pantomime Babes In The Wood. - I don't think he'll like that. - Don't fret, sir. I'm in charge of his meat. He'd do anything for a bit of kidney. There's nothing we can do tonight. We'll parade tomorrow and discuss the plan. That's all. - Hello? - Hello? Who's there? It's me, Captain Square. The verger, Walmington-on-Sea parish church. - Any news? - I found out how they'll get into the mill. - How? - The same way as Shakespeare did it. Shakespeare? What are you talking about? They're going to dress up as bushes, creep into the crops, then across the open ground. LordI That old trick? Main-waring must be slippingI Ha-ha-ha. - Thank you for your help. - I'd do anything for you, sir. You're a gentleman. Not like Mainwaring's lot. Treat me like dirt, they do. Just like dirt! - All right, Frazer? - Fine, thank you, sir. We'll just run through the plan in detail again. We are in the boathouse here. Frazer will push the log out into the open river here. Remaining underwater, he'll push the log through the river till he comes level with the windmill here. What do you do then, Frazer? When I'm level with the windmill, I give one tug on my lifeline. Now, when Frazer tugs on his lifeline, I shall give one warble on my bird warbler, and what do you do then, Wilson? When you've done your warble on your bird warbler, I shall start to create the first diversion. Walker? When you've warbled and Sergeant Wilson starts the first diversion, I'll help him. What happens then, Frazer? While the diversion is attracting the attention of the defenders in the mill, I quickly tilt Jones in the log onto the bank. Excellent. Jones? Where's Jones? He's dressing up as a log. Hurry up, Jones. Shouldn't take you all this time to dress up as a log. And here we have Betty, in a natty little one-piece woodland ensemble. # A pretty girl is like a melody... # Walker! All right. Stand easy, Corporal. - What do you think, Wilson? - I don't know what to think. I really don't. It's too late to change our plans now. We'll have to hope for the best. Jones? Where are you, Jones? - Jones? - I'm here, sir. We've just got to the bit where you've been tipped on the bank. What do you do then? Well, sir, it's like this. When Sergeant Wilson's being diverting, I make my way to the windmill. When Jones reaches the windmill, I shall give two warbles on my bird warbler. What then? When I hear two warbles on the bird warbler, I start the second diversion. - And I help him with it. - That's right. Now, Jones. The second diversion should give you time to get to the mill. You flatten yourself against the outside so people inside can't see you. You then divest yourself of the log, climb up the ladder here and throw the bomb in through the window here. - How are you going to carry the bomb? - Between my legs, sir. What? I shall have a piece of string round my waist and it will dangle between my knees. At a given point, the choosing of my own, I shall let loose the string and the bomb will drop on the floor, sir. I see. Give him the time bomb. Right, sir. Here you are, Jonesy. Keep still for a moment. It's going to be rather difficult, sir. I can't quite see where to put... That was really rather neat, wasn't it? - All right. Tie it on, Jones. - Right, sir. - Quickly as you can. - Right, sir. - Hurry. I want to try this out. - I've only got two pairs of legs, sir. - Give him a hand, Walker. - Right, open up, Jonesy. Look, Joe, I'm tying a knot, so put your finger on it. Not there! Oh, come on! Get on with it. See if you can release the bomb. - Off you go. - Right, sir. Release the bomb! - (CLUCKS LIKE A CHICKEN) - All right, Walker! You can stop jumping about now. That seemed to work, Wilson. - Yes. Shall I put the bomb back in again? - No. We can't go through that nonsense again. Let's assume that it's inside. I want to run through this from the start. Take up your positions. We're going... Where have you gone to? - Down here, sir. - We're going from the beginning. Very good, sir. Right, sir. - Right. You all right, Frazer? - Aye, sir. Don't forget, boys, keep up a nice steady pressure. - Don't worry. We'll keep pumping. - Don't forget the signals. If I give four pulls it means I'm coming up. If you give four pulls it means you want me to come up. See? Yeah. I've got it, Mr Frazer. Two different signals - four and four. Put the glass in. Right. Start pumping. - Godfrey, Wilson, take up diversion positions. - All right, sir. Now, let's get Frazer into the water. Come on. Here we are. Right. Now...you're going into the water. Now, Frazer takes the log out from the boathouse into the open river. (JONES) Gurgle, gurgle. Gurgle, gurgle. - All right, Corporal? - Yes, sir. - That's the water gurgling against the side, sir. - I see. - (JONES) Gurgle, gurgle! - I shall be looking through my periscope. Frazer's now submerged, pushing the log along the river. He has now reached a point opposite the windmill. - (JONES) Gurgle, gurgle. - (WARBLE) - That's the signal for the diversion. Wilson! - Yes? I've warbled. Are you diverting? We're doing it behind the wall. - I can't see you. - How could you, sir? - We're doing it behind the wall. - All right. Start again. - (JONES) Gurgle, gurgle. - Frazer! Frazer! - Frazer! - He can't hear you, Mr Mainwaring. - Give four pulls on his lifeline. - Thank you very much. One, two, three, four. Get him up. He don't half look a funny colour, Mr Mainwaring. Perhaps he hasn't got enough air. Sponge! More air! We're pumping as hard as we can, Mr Mainwaring. - Mr Mainwaring? - Yes? You're standing on the pipe, you stupid boy. - Help him off with his helmet. - No, he might get the bends in his head. - No one would tell the difference. - Are you all right, Frazer? - All right now? - He still can't hear you, Mr Mainwaring. He's all right. Can't waste any more time. All right, Corporal? - OK, sir. - Right. Once more. Here we go. Positions, everybody. This time we'll get it right. Right. Here we... What are you doing, you stupid boy? Right, take up your positions. Everything ready? Off you go. - What do you want, Warden? - What's going on? That's no concern of yours. What we are doing is vital to the war effort. A bloke in a diving suit pushing another bloke on a soapbox dressed in a log? - Vital to the war effort? - Yes. - I'd never have believed it. - (JONES) Gurgle, gurgle. Gurgle, gurgle. - What's that? - That's the water gurgling past. - (JONES) Gurgle, gurgle! - Don't go away. Gerald's got to see this. Right. Let's start again. When Frazer reaches the point of the windmill... I told you. A bloke in a diving suit pushing another bloke on a soapbox dressed in a log. - Don't call me a liar. - You were right. Here's your five bob. Are they on our side? - Any sign of Main-waring's lot yet, Sergeant? - No, sir. Nothing. It's only a quarter to. They're not due to start till two o'clock. - I make it a quarter past, sir. - What? Good heavens! Damn thing must have stopped. I don't see how that Walmington-on-Sea lot will get across. All the others have failed. Well, keep your eye open for a lot of bushes. Part of their master plan. Ha-ha-ha. - According to the verger. - Is he reliable, sir? Of course he is. He's my fifth column. I've got him posted in a graveyard on the side of a hill. He can see everything from there. I'd better ring him up, see if he's OK. (SNIPPING) (PHONE RINGS) Verger here. Not yet, Captain Square, but I've got my eyes peeled. - Let me know if anything moves. - Yes, sir. - A quick check now, before we go. Jones? - Yes, sir? - Have you got the bomb between your legs? - Yes, it's quite comfy, sir. Right-ho. Right. Glass in. That's it. Start the pump. - Mr Mainwaring? - Yes. Mr Frazer's just given four pulls on his lifeline. That means he wants to come up. He's already up, you silly boy. - Stop pumping. - Yes, sir. - What's the matter, Frazer? - I just want to scratch my nose. Oh... Go on, hurry up. - Is that enough? - That's it. Right. Start the pumps. - Right. You ready, Jones? - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Good luck. - Good luck, sir. - Right. Lower him down onto the raft. - (JONES) Gurgle, gurgle. - It won't go through, Mr Mainwaring. - Oh! Give it to me, you stupid boy. There you are. Right. They've got to a place level with the windmill. Take over the periscope, Pike. - I'm going to sound the signal. Got it? - Yes, sir. Off we go, then. What are you doing? (WARBLE) I think they've started, sir. Look. Over by that wall. What the devil are they doing? Left, right, left, right... Why are they drilling? They ought to be attacking us. - It's typical of Main-waring's Blimp mentality. - Could be a trick. It's impossible. I can count 15 rifles. It's a whole platoon. (MUFFLED ) I can't get the door open. I at this hotel? The magazines say ... many former spies ... stayed in this hotel Were you among them?

He's known as "The Fixer" He fixes all kinds of things ... Like firearms, drugs, kidnaps But his friends call him Mr. Zen Like he's some kind of philosopher Now I'm damn sure he's after you Me? Why me? Look 6 months ago, an American biochemist came up ... with an even more dangerous version ofAnthrax Called the Anthrax II Half a teaspoon of this can wipe out an entire village Interested buyers wanted results Turkey was chosen as a testing ground Hundreds of Turks died within a couple of weeks in the initial trial 2 months ago 4 scientists were killed in a village near Istanbul One we know worked on Anthrax Il The locals killed him for revenge and to seize the toxin They realized how valuable it was What has this to do with me? Well, the day before this scientist was gunned down Agents spotted him meeting with Mr. Park Looks like your father was the middleman And the toxin was passed on to him But we don't think he made the delivery Day after the shooting Your father entered the South Korean Consulate in Istanbul Seeking asylum He gave the toxin to South Korea? No, no one knows where he hid it Now, can you remember what Mr. Park told you before he died? Nothing about this That's not what people think And that's why Mr. Zen sent her to approach you Sorry I'm late I knew you would be Your head? I fell My boss Mr. Zen invites you to dinner tonight Finally What? Didn't he send people after me? No, why would he? What does he want? He has the wrong man I don't have what he wants You must be his gift to me A generous host He's in big business You should talk to him Is that a warning?

I have never ... seen so much death Did he get you addicted? I'm an orphan He's my master He provides for me He says, pretty girls ... should enjoy pretty things If not for him Perhaps I would have died ... in the orphanage at age 1 3 He saved ... my life Yong, you all right? Boss Don't worry I brought your medication Yong! I went to rescue you Why didn't you wait? You didn't have to kill them If not for me the villagers would have killed you It's going to rain Come aboard Yes, I understand Goodbye Where were we? That's between you and my father I paid a deposit Part of the money in that ... safety deposit box is mine I'll give it all to you Just leave me alone A deal is a deal I paid, and I want my goods Besides It's for your own good Really?

Youg too Don't decide now Think it through The car is waiting But don't take too long My French buyer is impatient And don't keep Yong waiting She may die hanging around me I'm an orphan He saved ... my life "Wait for me" He must have realized that he was going to die So he came to say a final goodbye to her How about a game of hide-and-seek with me? What can I do for you? Japanese? Not Japanese. I'm Chinese How are you? You speak Chinese? I worked in the Far East I know Chinese, Japanese and Korean You know this man? He came often We don't know his name I saw him 2 months ago He looked unwell I let him stay here 2 days later, he disappeared He called me afterwards And told me he was dying His son would come for his things A question If someone awaits your rescue But saving her ... means others may die Would you still do it? If you don't go she will die Correct? I can only say Even if he was Hitler you should go The aftermath Leave that to God This may be the thing Maybe Go, take care We're leaving in 20 minutes This was ... the terminal station of ... the Orient Express It had its prime Zen told you all this? Only an empty shell remains as a tourist trap All things have their destiny Perhaps some day This will be grand again You're an optimist I have to be to survive You're free to go anywhere France, Italy, Switzerland Home?

Don't tell me you gave it to Zen So, I guess that's a "yes" If you had given it to us, that poor girl might still be alive This is how they control their organization They trust only the dead! One small dose was all it took to get her killed I shouldn't have come here, damnit! I should have let you rot in that Turkish jail Where's the car? This way, I'll take you back to the hotel No I've got to find Zen To do what? To get revenge? Can't you see that you're lucky to be still alive? Don't play innocent! There's blood on your hands You guys set the trap, Zen planted the bait I feel sorry for you and myself Hello I'm sorry, I lied to you about being a reporter But if you want to nail Zen Be at the Hazari Airport tomorrow at 2 pm And you better be prepared He is bringing his elite bodyguards What's Ashley's plan? He is flying to Athens to meet his boss The CIA wants the damage controlled And doesn't want any more black-bag operations in Turkey So we decided to take everything into our own hands. And buy back the Anthrax II from Zen We'll use the money to repair ... the orphanage I miss you all I'll study hard, Yong P.S. I'm going somewhere far away No address yet If you need anything Contact my friend Buck Yuen What's he doing here? Let's go! What the hell is he doing here? Good question! Hurry up! Hurry up! Boss!

Miss being a spy? It's in your blood. There are no jobs out there. But I have one. Everyone has a dream that fills their heart... a journey they must take... a destiny to fulfill. As close as your imagination... exists a magical place... where wondrous creatures with incredible powers... help make dreams come true. It's the world of Pokemon. People can capture Pokemon to be more than just pets. Human trainers and their Pokemon... compete against others in amazing contests... of skill and strategy. The best trainers one day become Pokemon masters. That's a dream that burns brightly for many... but none more so than Ash Ketchum. The pride of Pallet Town began his Pokemon journey... on his tenth birthday. That's the day he qualified to become a Pokemon trainer. Professor Oak gave Ash his very first Pokeball. Inside was an electric Pokemon... with whom Ash would spark a lifelong friendship--Pikachu. Pikachu! Together, Ash and Pikachu are determined... to fulfill his dream... of becoming the world's greatest Pokemon master. Joining them on their quest are Misty... and yours truly, Brock... in the incredible world of Pokemon. Bi. Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Hound! -Bi! Bi! -Scyther! Scyther! Scyther! Scyther! Bi! Bi! Bi! Huh? Ohh. If you're going in, be careful. Huh? Don't forget--if you hear the Voice of the Forest... don't move a muscle. Huh? Don't tell me you haven't heard about it. No, I haven't. What's the Voice of the Forest? Well, it's only a legend... but everyone around here believes it. They say there's a sound you can hear... when the spirit that protects the forest... is time-traveling. Time-traveling? That's one of its special powers. It can go back and forth between the past and the future. Wow. So if you hear a weird sound... stop and stay completely still. If the spirit catches you... it could carry you off to a different time. Don't worry. I'll be careful. Mm. Thanks. Bye. Wait. Huh? T ake this. It's a loaf of bread I made... that's full of berries from the forest. It might come in handy if you get hungry. Here. Thanks, Miss. I appreciate it. Bye. Furret. Furret. Furret! Bi! Bi! -Scyther! -Bi! Hound! Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Scyther! Bi! Ho-o-o-ound. Scyther! So... Bi...bi... You've been givin' me the slip for a long time... but you won't today. Bi! Don't let it get away! Let's go! -Scyther! -Hound! Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi-i-i-i-i-i! Huh? Cele? Cele! Oddish. Oddish. Oddish. Whoa! Bi. Huh? Uhh! Hound! Huh. Uhh! Huh? Scyther! Bi! Bi! Let it go! Two against one isn't fair! Doom...hound! Aah! Bi! Scyther! Scyther! Hou-hou-hound! Bi! Bi! Huh? All right, hand over that Celebi. Celebi? Why should I hand it over? What do you want with it? I'm a Pokemon hunter, kid. I make good money off of rare Pokemon. First I catch 'em, then I auction 'em off... to the highest bidders. Well, you're not gonna get your hands on this Pokemon! Give it to me! No! Go away! Bi. Bi-i-i-i-i-i! Could that be time-traveling? Uhh. Uhh. Huh? Bi-i-i-i-i-i! I'll tell you why I'm here. I'm here because I heard a story... that you almost caught a Celebi... somewhere in this forest about 40 years ago--true? I'm still a Pokemon hunter! I'm not gonna tell you anything! Heh heh. We'll see about that. OK. Sneasel! Sneasel! Sneasel! What's that thing? A Dark Ball. What's it do? Allow me to demonstrate. The Pokemon I catch with the Dark Ball... become evil Pokemon... and their power instantly increases to the highest level. Come on out, Tyranitar! Hyper Beam Attack! No, please! It's gonna destroy everything! Uhh! Aah! Aah! All right! All right! I'll show you! I'll show you the spot... where I found that Celebi! Heh heh heh heh heh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I thought you'd see it my way. Today we find our friends... waiting for a ferry that will carry them... to yet another Pokemon gym... as they continue their Johto League journey. Brock and Misty are ready. The passengers are hurrying aboard... and it's almost time for the boat to leave. But where are Ash and Pikachu? Well, if they don't come soon they're gonna miss the boat. T ogepi! Crobat, go! Crobat! Cro! My name's Dundee... and I'm the best Pokemon trainer in the whole town. Well, my name's Ash... and I'm a pretty good Pokemon trainer, too. Why don't you pick a Pokemon, and we can have a battle. Pika! Croconaw, go! Croconaw! A Croconaw, huh? Never battled one of those before. OK, Pikachu, let's go! Pika! Pokemon, Pokemon, Pokemon, Pokemon, Pokemon Let's do it Thunder Shock Attack! So, sounds like you're all... pretty interested in Pokemon, huh? Yeah. I come from a place just up the river... and a lot of real unusual ones... live in the forest nearby. Hey, if you could show us where it is... maybe we could stop and check it out. No problem. We can get off... at the next stop, and I'll take you... the rest of the way in my boat. Great. Thanks. Pika! ALL: Huh? ASH: Ohh. Hey, was that a Pokemon? Looked like one to me. You'll see the woods around here are full of them. There's one more possibility. Did it look anything like this? Yeah, that's it, Professor. It was a Suicune. A Suicune? What kind of Pokemon is that, Professor? It's one of the legendary Pokemon, Brock... and not very much is known about it. And according to folk tales... Suicune personifies the north wind... and it's believed to have the power... to purify tainted waters. Wow, I hope I get to see Suicune again. Its sounds like it's a pretty cool one. Believe you me, kids... those tales are definitely true. Really? How do you know that for sure, Professor? Have you ever seen a Suicune before? Yes, I sure have, but only one time. Wow! Where? Hey, Ash, come on! We've gotta go! OK! Uh, bye, Professor. I wonder if I should've told him before he hung up. Hmm. The quicker we get into that forest... the quicker we can look for those Pokemon. Maybe even that Suicune. Those twerps won't get away now. They're right beneath us. Of course, they're beneath us. They're twerps. Now all we do is swoop in and swipe Pikachu. Uh-oh. Something's wrong with my leg. All this pedaling is giving me a cramp. Oh! Ow! Aah! You can't cramp! We'll crash! All right. What do we do now? Don't worry, Misty. You'll see. -Whoa. -Pi? Toge? Toge! Toge! Toge! Toge! Ha ha ha! Toge-togepi! Well, we're here. Here? Where? Look closer. Tree houses? Togepi! That's right, Brock. Welcome to Arborville. Pika? -Whoa. -Prrri! Stop right there! Huh? I suppose you kids are heading into the forest... to look for Pokemon. Yes, ma'am. Then you're gonna love what you see in there. I love what I see here! My name's Brock... and I'm studying to become a Pokemon breeder... but my specialty is human relations. Oh? Please tell me your name! My name's Diana, and that's my grandma. She's been guarding the entrance to the forest... since she was my age. Listen for The Voice of the Forest... and if you hear it, stop and be still... or you will not get away. The Voice of the Forest? It's an old village legend. Yes, it's a legend, and a true one. If you hear The Voice, stop where you are. Uh, we gotta hurry... but thanks a lot for the warning, ma'am. Pika! Diana, why don't you come, too, and protect us? Then she'd need protection from you. I wonder what Diana's grandmother meant... by 'The Voice of the Forest. " Maybe the sound of the wind or the trees... the water, or maybe the voices of the Pokemon. Pi? Ohh. I wonder what that is. Maybe it's The Voice of the Forest. -Come on! -Pika! Ash, no! Hey, shouldn't we stand still? Uh...wait up! Bi. Bi. Bi. Hey, it's a kid. Is he OK? He's still breathing. Yeah. Let's take him back to Diana's house. Good idea. Yeah. Bi... I wonder what that light was. Hey! Diana! Diana! We need help! Oh, dear. What's happened? Hey, Ash, he's waking up. Take it easy. You're gonna be OK. Pika. Uhh. Uhh! What'd you do with that Celebi? Hey, I'm trying to help you! That's enough, you two. Knock it off. Settle down! Who are you anyway? Huh? Where am I? Howd I get here? I carried you here on my back, that's how! What's going on? misty: We found him unconscious... when we were out in the forest. Oh! Oh-oh-oh! I can't believe it. It's really you. Huh? You've come back. Oh, thank goodness! Uh, Grandma... where did he come back from? Diana, I've told you the story... about what happened when I was a young girl. A little boy disappeared from the forest. But this boy can't be him. Well, maybe it can't be... -but it is. -Huh? Ah! You're the girl... who gave me the loaf of bread. Yes. Here. I've kept this all these years in case you ever came back. This is my sketchbook. How-- You've been away... on a 40-year-long journey, young man. 40 years? What do you mean? The legend says The Voice of the Forest... can catch a person and take them on a trip through time. -Huh? -Through time? Stantler? Stan-- Stantler! Uhh! Where's Celebi? What happened to Celebi? Celebi? Was there a Pokemon with me in the forest? We didn't see any. The Pokemon you met that day was a Celebi? Yes. We know Celebi as The Voice of the Forest... the spirit that protects it. They say that Celebi can travel through time. You two must've been in danger... and Celebi just picked the fastest way... to get you out of it. It's must've escaped to the future... and taken you along with it. I'm afraid you're right. Celebi lives deep in the forest... in a place we call "The Lake of Life." That's probably where it's gone back to now. I've got a feeling Celebi still may be hurt. I have to go back into that forest and find Celebi. I'll go, too! Me, too! So will I! Togepi! My name's Brock... and I'm a Pokemon breeder. I'm Sam. And I'm Misty. My specialty is water Pokemon. My name's Ash Ketchum... and I'm trying to be a Pokemon master. Pika! Oh, yeah, and this is Pikachu. Pikachu! Hi, Pikachu. I'm Sam. Our glider didn't glide very well. Next time we spring for a motor. I wonder where those twerps are. We may never know. Huh? -Huh? -Huh? Well, well. I can't believe my eyes. Looks like it's a good thing... we crashed after all, eh, Meowth? Come on, let's get down and tail them twerps! Pika! Pikachu! Pi--pi--pi--pi-- Pi--Pika! Guys, look up there! The Pokemon are all together. I'm coming, too! Ash climbs just like a Mankey. Togepi! Pi! -Aah! -Pika! Sam, maybe you should wait down with Brock and Misty. No. I have to find Celebi. I couldn't protect it before... so I've gotta help it now. I know how you feel, Sam, but take it easy. Pi! Pi! Pi! Pi! Uh. Ah! Bi...bi. Hey. Is this the Celebi? Mm-hmm. Come on, Celebi. Bi. Bi! Whoa! Unh! Hey! What'd you do that for? I think Ash just evolved into a primate. We're only trying to help you. Bi! Whoa! What's going on? Pika-- No, Pikachu, don't! Don't be mad at it. It's just afraid... and it's hurt, too. A hunter attacked it. That's why it's scared. OK. Here goes. Celebi, we're your friends. We don't want to hurt you. We just want to help you. Bi! I tried to help you before. Don't you remember, Celebi? I got you away from the Pokemon hunter. It's OK. Bi? You just take it easy. And we will, too. There... Bi. Bi? Uh... Ha ha! You're safe with me, Celebi. Bi. Bi. Pik--Pik--Pik... Brock, it seems really weak. Yeah, we better hurry. We'll take it to a Pokemon center. Pika-pi! Who are they? Prepare for trouble. Your future looks grim. And we're not afraid to go out on a limb. To protect the world from devastation. To unite all peoples within our nation. To denounce the evils of truth and love. To extend our reach to the stars above. Jessie. James. Team Rocket... blast off at the speed of light. Surrender now or prepare to fight. Meowth--that's right. Wobbuffet! Wobbuffet! Aah! Hmm. Do you think they're gonna be OK? Unfortunately, yes. Hmm. You twerps got lucky this time. They're always lucky. Wobbuffet! Don't press your luck, blubbo. Hang in there, Celebi. Look, that's the village up there! Aah! I've been looking for that little Celebi. Who are you? A Pokemon lover. Leave us alone! What does he want? He must be trying to steal our Pikachu away. Well, we won't let him! Weezing. Weezing. Huhh! What's that? A Tyranitar... but there's something funny about it. Hyper-beam! Here it comes! Pika! Pika! Weezing! Two can play the Celebi-stealing game. Who are you three? Look at that mask. I've seen him before. Yeah, wasn't he in that Mexican wrestling movie? No, Meowth, he's from Team Rocket. The Iron Mask Marauder! So you heard about me. Yeah! Oh, yes, we've heard a lot about you. As you can tell from the uniforms... we're also members of Team Rocket. Me, too, but Pokemon get to go naked. Go! Scizor! Sneasel! Aah. Misty! I think Misty's hurt. Brock, I twisted my knee. You better stay off it. Pi--Pika! Something's coming! Sneasel! Scizor! Scizor! What are they doing here? They must want Celebi. Scizor! Snease! All right, then they're in for a battle. Brock, take care of Celebi. Right. All right, I'm with you, Ash. Ready? Uh... Char! Go! Bay! Scizor! B-bay! Scizor! Bay. Quick, Bayleef, use your razor leaf! Bay... Scizor! [Echoes] Bay! Bay. Scizor! Scizor! [Echoes] Bay... Char. Char! Char. Char! Scizor! [Echoes] Bay! Bay. Are you OK? Ash, you gotta find the real one. It's using double team. Mm. Bayleef, listen, you gotta concentrate! Then you can find the real one! Scizor! [Echoes] Bay. Bay. Scizor... Scizor. Bay! Scizor! Bay! Scizor! Yeah, Bayleef, you did it! You're a great trainer, Ash. Well, it helps when you have great Pokemon. Look out. Sneasel! Sneasel! Char. Charmeleon, use head butt! Char! Char! Snease. Hey, you're not a bad trainer yourself. We make a good team. -Scizor! -Snease! -Scizor! -Snease! Those kids aren't as wimpy as I thought they'd be. This makes things interesting. We gotta find the way out. Pi? This is getting bad. Pppi. Bi. Bi. Bi. Bi. We better keep moving forward. If we stop now, we might be too late. -Pika! -Huh? It's Ursaring. Huh? Daddy Ursa. Goom-um. Oh... What are they doing? I think they're telling us to follow them. Pika! Should we? Yeah. Stantler. -Goom. -Stantler. Stantler. Furret. Furret. Stantler. Furret. -Stantler. -Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Furret. Hey, do you think this could be The Lake of Life... that Diana's grandmother was talking about? Bi... Bi... Bi... Bi... Bi... Bi... Bi... Hey, Sam, look. Huh? Uh-- Look, guys, Celebi's swimming. And it's glowing. Pika! This must be the Lake of Life. Hey, that's it! The lake water... must have brought Celebi back to life. Oh. Ha ha. Pika. Pika! Bi! Bi! Celebi! All right! Pikachu! Bi! Ha ha ha. Whee! Whee! Pikachu! Whee! Bi! Bi! Toge! Toge! Bi! Whee! -Bi! -Whoa. All right, then! Let's do it! Yeah! Mm! Mm! Mm! Mm! -Whoa! -Whoa! Pika! Pika! All right! Bi. Oh. Hey! Heh heh. My knee's better. Thanks, Celebi! Bi! Bi! Hi! Hey, you guys! Bi! Bi! -Whoa! -Whoa! This is great! Oh... There's the village over there. Jaj, jaj... Ja, ja, ja... Ja, ja, ja... Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi-bi! Bi. Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Huh? Awesome! These are really good. Yeah? Pika. Ah, you're right. Pika, Pika! Huh. Mmm, they're tasty. They're delicious. Bi! Bi! I'm gonna keep some for later. Pikachu! Thanks for taking us here, Celebi. Yeah. These are good ones. Have some, Celebi. Bi-bi-bi-bi! Bi-bi-bi-bi! Don't you worry. We'll find Celebi. I'd rather find some lunch. So would I. Or a bathroom. -Huh? -Huh? Lucky us! It's a peach tree! Grab that big one there, Meowth. You got it, Jessie! Eee! Ah! Ah! -Hey! -Hey! Nice catch. It was peachy. Huh? There goes our driver! Wait! Come back! Don't leave us! We'll even chip in for gas! Sammy, it's the middle of the night. I know, but I can't sleep. Hey, that's great. Thanks. When I meet a new Pokemon... I sketch him in this book. Can I take a look? Mm-hmm. Hmm. Oh, these are amazing! This is like a handmade Pokedex. That's this machine that has pictures of Pokemon. I guess you know a lot about the future, huh, Ash? At least more than I do. Yeah, I guess so... but I'm sure glad I'm not stuck in it like you are. Oh, hey, I'm sorry. Hey, I didn't mean to make you feel bad, Sam. Honest, I didn't. That's OK. I think I'll like living in the future... but it'll take some getting used to. Yeah. Probably. But then I think about my mother worrying about me... and wondering where I am. And I wonder if she still wonders. Oh. Yeah, me, too. Hey, what about your mom, Ash? I bet she worries about you... when you're out on your Pokemon journey. Yeah, she worries, I guess. Maybe that's just what moms do. Mm. Thinking about my mom... gets me thinking about her cooking. Hey, I have something. Huh? Diana's grandmother made this... but that was about 40 years ago. Still looks pretty fresh, though. -Mm. -Mm. It's great! Tastes like it was made yesterday. Pika? Pika? Bi? Bi? What's the matter, Pikachu? Hey, Ash, look. Huh? Oh. Oh. Oh, cool. Wow. Look at all the Butterfree. I hope you'll be free, Sam. Huh? I mean, to go back in time. Oh. -Oh. -Oh. Free! Wait for me! Bi! Bi! Pika! Ah. Whoa. Oh, cool. Pika! Bi! Well, the village is real close now. Bi! Bi! Look! Pika! Bi-i! Bi! Bi! Bi! Thought you'd gotten rid of us... didn't you, twerps? But Team Rocket doesn't give up so easily! Not you again. All right... we ain't leaving without that Celebi. Pikachu! Nice try! Togepi! Oh! Bi! Celebi! This ought to calm you down. Bi! Hey! Pika-pi! Dark Ball, go! -Aah! -Aah! Celebi is mine. Let it go! Stupid kids. Aah! Hey! Aah! Pika! -Whoa! -Aah! Don't worry. I got ya. Aah! I think that Dark Ball belongs to me. Aah--aah! Ash! -Pika-pi! -Toge! Huh? Don't waste your time. It's too late to save your friend Celebi. Stantler. Because the sweet little Pokemon you used to know... doesn't exist anymore. Here, see for yourself! Celebi, get rid of them all! Aah! Pika! I don't understand. If Celebi's their friend, I'd hate to see their enemies. Excellent. You're very strong, Celebi. Now show me even more of your power! [Laughs] With a Pokemon like you, no one will ever stop me! Celebi. Celebi's building a nasty nest. Oh, no! Oh. Oh, what is that? I don't know. Grandma. We'd better go find out. Right. Mm...uhh. Uhh! Celebi! Uhh! I've gotta-- Uhh! Take it easy, Ash. You might be hurt. Hey! Hi, guys! Just stay right where you are. We're coming down to get you! Diana! I can't believe they found us! Uhh, this is awful. Forcing the Spirit of the Forest... to destroy the forest. Mid Honeho to be the same route! Our only chance to enter this Leyline! All we can never overcome them! Shield maximize!

What are you doing here? ! I followed the xgp'y and brought me here. What was the purpose? If you like a hyena's pointless to be here. Is the hyena? No, we're hunters.

Merger would be difficult to him. Yes, I wondered what it would be if ...? I already know that he is a bio android! Water androit? No, no, I know it's a little different from bio android girl. No, no, no, absolutely different. How different? Kei pirates had come to me and asked me if I could not solve the problem some genetic engineering or data have revealed something similar rumors "Move Dragon's Tomb" was their ruins. One professor pirates know you solve your design data and XGP. To tell the truth, I am not able to solve all data. As I said in my understanding I had many things. "Black box" olarak isimlendirdim I do not know how it happened, but 30,000 years ago have come from somewhere I do not know how active you with this black box, It can be solved by the XGP and Melfi. Yup... Are you telling me that a professor can not solve the mystery In the XGP and Melfina? Yeah, it is! Exactly! Oh, why is there so much mystery in the universe ... I ... I can not even decipher them? In other words, what is your answer, Harry? She is a great mystery. I caught them! I found you Melfi in! Turn the ship! What's the fucking doing here? Mel? Spiral crashes. Mel, what was that ? ! Is this a ... a swirly? I spotted another ship! This Geomancer! Catch xgp'y! Destroy MacDougall! Mess with me! Go directly to the attack! Watch the XGP!

Guidance for us to do! Is that guidance? This business is very easy! Çarpışıcaz! I'm picking up the atmosphere outside the vessel. Again! What will we do? ! We're not gonna turn our backs? Leyla invited to send us. Edicez accepted. Finally we reached the end of the road, huh? My God, my God. Take a look at this. It looks like an artificial species.

Tobiger, you will protect the crew and the ship Geomancer mold! Aye. The rest of you will be with me! Aye! Well, Harry? How is this body? A great feeling. I can stand more comfortable standing by my real body. This powerful but completely life-support systems of the body only. Yes I understand. This place gives me the creeps. What, the end of the road? Yet, what is going to be now? As we have no other choice? Back dönücez ... What is all this light? Disappeared! What are these...? ! What's all this? Cave disappeared! It's like a different place! What's going on here? I do I know? Anyway, it looks like inside the cylinder. What's happening in Melfi? I do not know anything at all. I do not know how I did it! I can guide you how Outlaw Star? I have not been here before, then how ...? Is not We came here to find all their answers? Then I let me tell ! Who are you? Because this is the secret hidden in the Melfina Leyline. Hazanko. And ...

I'm standing here, asking the Father... ... todeliverme somekindofheavenly sign, and he sends me a lawyer. Well, God works in mysterious ways, they say. What? Actually, I could use an attorney. I was just fired by my congregation. I might have a case for wrongful termination. Why did they fire you? They said I could no longer perform the function of the job. Oh. Because? I don't believe in God. I've been down this road Nine One One Walking the line That's painted by pride And I have made mistakes in my life That ljust can 't hide Oh, I believe I am ready For what love has to bring I got myself together Now I'm ready to sing I've been searching my soul tonight I know there's so much more to life Now I know I can shine the light To fiind my way back home Baby Oh yeah You took this guy's case? He's clergy. Not all religions believe in God. There are some sects that don't. -And what's his? -Methodist. It's a tough sell, I admit. That doesn't mean-- -How can a minister not believe in God? -His wife was killed. I'll try to settle it or make it go away. He seemed like he needed help, and I couldn't say no. Could you just allow this for me, please? I don't ask for much. -I don't! -Uh... . Let's see, Hooley v. the town of Jackman, Massachusetts. -Mine. -What's it about? -I don't know. -You don't know? No. I am meeting the client at 1 0, youngster, and I will know then. Move along. FISH: Speaking of sexual harassment, we need you to sign waivers. Our office Christmas party is Wednesday night. -Jenny, you can bring your mother. -I don't like you dogging my mother. Where's your Yuletide spirit? 'Tis the season to get your jolly. I'm tired of pulling the religious sled. What's that song? -"Wattle Wonderland"? -Winter. Whatever. Bygones. Party Wednesday. Parents welcome. Adjourned. -He canceled Christmas? -Basically. The parade, the street decorations, they're not doing any of it. -Did the mayor say why? -The town is in a recession. He thinks it is irresponsible to spend on nonessential-- Oh, but this is Jackman. I go there to buy ornaments. -They have a Santa's Village. -That's partly the reason. The manufacturing plant and village burned down. It was our town industry, so because it's Christmas, the mayor... . The kids are heartbroken. -Can't you have a parade on your own? -No, we can't get the permit. Ms. McBeal, the board adores your client. We want him to continue being the minister. You know that. -I can't question God? -Of course you can. You're saying you don't believe in him. It takes the pep out of the hymns. Actually, what I said to the congregation was... ... thatGodno longerbelievesinus . Or if he does, he simply no longer cares. How can we have our minister saying that? Of all the ridiculous motions to put before me. -That's not a productive start. -You can't sue for canceling a parade. This isn't just a parade. This is about Christmas. Christmas? -Perhaps you've heard of it. -Have you heard of contempt? I have, but if you held me in it, how would I know, you grumpy lump? -I apologize. You hit a holiday nerve. -I've put up with you for five years. All I ask, your curmudgeon-ness, is that you listen to my client. He paid taxes to this municipality. He moved there, in part to participate in events, and now this one is gone. Just give us five minutes. Is there a root canal you're running late for? Let's have a rock 'n ' roll Christmas Just like we used to know Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh A rock 'n ' roll Christmas And I'll meet you by the mistletoe Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Rock around the tree Go Santa go, go, go -You shouldn't do that. -Why? -It's too sexual for a holiday party. -To women you're a stocking stuffer. I'm up here as a "stocking stuffer"? It's Christmas. Birth of Christ, conception, sex. You're the ocean. I'm the sperm whale. Dance. Let's have a rock 'n ' roll Christmas Just like we used to know, ooh Yeah a rock 'n ' roll Christmas And I'll meet you by the mistletoe There's no way I'm gonna be able to get a court to reinstate you... ... ifthisis howyou trulyfeel . Is it? Well, I'm sure in time, l-- You know, I probably should have asked you this before... ... buthowdidyourwife die? She was shot. A man came to rob her. She fumbled opening her purse, so he shot her. And you blame God. You're the expert, but I believe that the Lord gave man free will. Which, given the times, would seem to be an abuse of discretion, right? You know, as a minister, you must deal with death a lot... ... andyouhavehad tocomfort families who have lost loved ones. And what do you say to them? I fire off a few sacred platitudes and pray that they buy it. I know that isn't true. Ms. McBeal, I can't even help my own son. He-- What kind of a minister could I be? Do you want to tell me about your son? He's an amazing kid. And when he sings... ... italwaysseemedtomethat it sounded like the voice of God... ... tohearmusic coming from him. He doesn't sing anymore. Is that what this is about? You not being able to help your son? (KNOCKING] John, l-- -Hello. -Hello. Is there a reason you're dressed like an elf? Yes, Veterans Day. Why would anybody dress like an elf? -Have we all forgotten Christmas? -Bite my head off. -Or why don't you just bite me. -Damn shoe doesn't even fit. (SCREAMS] Can't even get a decent elf shoe, for God's sake. What is wrong? I'm disappointed with mankind. Did you need something? I was looking for you to talk to my minister client. The one who doesn't believe in God. Even my elf underwear is riding up. John, I'm not really equipped to deal with somebody who's lost God. Why not? I don't know. I just... . From what I can tell, he's devastated because his son won't sing. The boy can sing well, and since his mother died, he won't. Any advice? You're good at these things. Why don't you go talk to the son? Hi. Excuse me, I'm looking-- -Malcolm? -Ally? Well, hey! Wow. -What are you doing here? -Well, I came to see-- -Oh, my God. -What? -Is your dad Harrison Wyatt? -Yes. -And he's a minister? -Has something happened? -He's my client. -He is? Yeah. Oh. Oh, Malcolm... ... I'msosorryaboutyour mother. You know, I wish that you would have called me. -Are you okay? -Yeah. It was rough for a while, but I'm really doing fine now. Your dad doesn't think you are, and I know that he isn't doing well. Why? What's going on? -Could I come in? -Of course. It's not just a parade. It's an event families look forward to for months. To suddenly cancel it, it's arbitrary, hurtful and very unfair. There are other towns with celebrations. -Couldn't you take your children--? -It's not the same. This is our town. You celebrate holidays where you live, not in somebody else's yard. What about the fiscal well-being of the community? Jackman's always had big Fourth of Julys, Labor Days, Halloweens. We do it up. That's who we are. You want to cancel Columbus Day? Okay. Labor Day, Presidents' Day. If the town can't acknowledge those occasions, so be it. But Christmas? No mayor should be able to cancel Christmas. I'm sorry. ELAINE SINGS: Oh, yeah Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney Stuck in my chimney Stuck in my chimney Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney -This doesn't seem to be a duet. -Oh, it's a duet, trust me. There he was in the middle Of the chimney JENNY: Testing. Testing. What's going on? We're rehearsing for the Christmas party. -Pick another song. -Why? This one's suited-- -Pick another number or partner. -What happened to holiday spirit? Just keep your grubby, horny little paws off Glenn. I didn't know your father was a minister. I thought you sang in somebody else's church. Reverend Harris. I used to sing in his choir. You don't sing in anybody's church now? No. -Is that because you're not able to? -I don't want to. And I just can't make it happen. -Do you think in time, it'll just--? -I don't know. I always sang with my mother when I was little. To her when I got older. The truth is, I can't listen to music right now. You know, Malcolm, you're so smart and-- You know tragedies happen to good people. Yeah, I do. But my mother... ... ifyouknewher .... If he wanted to take her, okay. But tell me why she had to be shot in the neck... ... bleedtodeathonthesidewalk. -So you're angry at God. -I'm not really angry at him. You just don't feel like talking to him much. I don't know what the problem is, but you can't hang in here as an elf. -I'm preparing the mayor's cross. -What's going on? The world seems so desperate. Oh, that. You know, Richard, privately every Christmas, I rent the elf costume. I scamper around my house at night to imbue myself with good tidings. Gee. Good idea to do it privately. It's a tradition. It started years ago when I went to rent a Santa outfit. They were sold-out, as they always are, hence the elf costume. But this year, the rack was filled with Santa Claus costumes. Nobody wants to be Santa anymore. How about that? And still you chose to be an elf. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? We've all flatlined. I don't know how to respond. Other than, if you leave again... ... becauseyou'resad, can I redecorate your hole? I gotta get back to court. (TOILET FLUSHES] Could you have possibly offered him something more? I've never been good with elves. This party in the bar? It will, in fact, be a party, right? Yeah, of course. Why? Because I think we all need one. -This is not a year to celebrate. -Why not, Mayor Horn? First of all, people died in that fire. Second, we're in a terrible recession. We can barely pay teachers. A snowstorm? We can't afford to plow the streets. So you, in your mayoral wisdom, decide to cancel the holiday. I'm not extinguishing the holiday. I won't authorize the wastiture-- -Object to wastiture. It's not a word. -Sustained. You're not just withholding funds. You're denying a permit for people to celebrate. Many people lost their jobs. We had six firemen lose their lives in that fire. This is not the time to be throwing parades. That's your opinion. It's disrespectful to be celebrating in the streets. Given the state of things, a public party is blatant inappropriate-ism. It's a fake word. Move to strike. Mr. Mayor, please use real words, sir. Look at me, and let me ask you this. -I missed the question. -I haven't asked it. -He's tinkering with my rhythm. -Just ask your question. What about the people, sir, who need this holiday? As a mayor, Mr. Cage, a politician... ... Ihaveto lookbeyond what the public needs... ... andconsiderwhattheywant . Most of the people do not want this parade. Most didn't want the Christmas tree in Main Street. People aren't in the mood for Christmas. What about those who are? Again, I repeat, out of respect for our economy and the lost lives... ...

Have you ever had somebody you loved suddenly die? The man I loved more than life itself laid down in front of me... ... anddiedin my arms. Would you like to see the scars?

When a guy moves on somebody else's girl, they settle it with fists. With women, they talk things out. I prefer the guy way. -You're gonna hit me? -Well. -That's a warning. -Excuse me, Jenny. Don't ever push me. Oh, but, Elaine, I will. Oh, Jenny, you're mistaken. All right!

I must tell you that I reject everything you just said. You know, four years ago, I met an 8-year-old boy with cancer. And he hired me to sue God, actually. And Billy. Now, I do sometimes see him as a ghost. I know that it's me summoning him up in a way. But I get to talk to him in my mind, and I get to talk to him in my heart. And he'll never be gone because I'll never let him go. It's because your mother's still here that you can't sing.

We have all become so deadened. Now we're canceling parades. -Where's the hope, for God's sake? -Are you deadened? You've seemed so sad lately, and... . Well, that's what this is, isn't it?

I'm doing the midnight service tonight. At least, I'm gonna try. That's great. Assuming I can come up with something to say. -What do you feel? -What do I feel? Yeah. Well, I feel... .

That's what it looked like, and that's what it always looks like with you. what I've got here." It was a letter from Einstein. I realised he was full ofinitiative. He had written his letter in such a way that Einstein replied. "Dear Argyris, I was very pleased with your kind letter dated July 6, including the fact that you gave a talk about me. Keep up your interest in science. It is a friend for life. With my very best wishes, Albert Einstein." When I came to the village, we all had atask to do: filling up the heatingwith coal. Every child, not groups of 2-3, had the weekly duty to go downto the cellar, also at night, to fill the heating with coal. I had to do so when I was ten. And I remember it being a march to hell. Down to the cellar, open the door and look at the glowing coal. It brought back memories instantly. Eight years in Switzerland already, this untouched country, as I fit existed out of time, which considers itself neither a victim of history nor a perpetrator. The village children rarely talk about why they're here. On a Christmas Eve, they attend mass in the St. Gall cathedral. Beethoven's Missa Solemnis is performed. It was an overwhelming experience. I was transposed into an entirely different world. I began asking myself how a German composer could compose this mass in this moving way and how the Germans, 150 years later, or not even 150 years later, could commit such horrible crimes. I felt agreat shock within me, about this great tension that lies good and bad and how thin the line can be. Like Beethoven said in the score: May God grant us inner and outer peace. It moved me greatly: This begging for peace means that people with such an experience are almost, or even totally, unable to find peace or inner peace. It's all the more difficult to promote peace for all humans. and to help mankind if you don't find inner peace. Why have I survived? Why wasn't I killed too? Can one leave the past behind, this overbearing black shadow? Summer visits in Distomo, where anew generation is growing up, andwhere, despite all traditions, the massacre hasn't been forgotten. People here won't forget. It is as if these things had happened only yesterday. I don't think they feel hate, but they feel pain and sadness in their hearts. Maybe it feels to them like a bad dream, but unfortunately it was reality. All that happened here. I was not yet born on the day ofthe massacre, only a year later. I was giventhe name of my brother, whom the Germans killed, alongwith 13 otherfamily members. My fatherfound him dead by the fountain overthere. Histhighs had been sliced up like meat at the butcher's. In desperation, my father hit his head on the ground. He suffered from migraines afterthat. I often wonder what I would have been like if my brother had been here, which of his qualities I have, and how much I'm apart of him. An existential pain. An even more existential helplessness. We had told grandmother where Argyris had gone. She wasn't an educated woman and had gone through so much. When she heard what language he spoke, she exclaimed: "German!" She tore her hair out. It was the Germans who had killed her children. She had a shock! German! "My God, my child has been taken to Germany!" During Argyris's childhood near Germany, a new generation is growing up in Germany. A new youth that wants to confront the national socialist past of its country with open eyes. I grew up - I'll use the wrong word - as a totally normal human being who doesn't ask questions and who thinks he lives -again the wrong word - in a totally normal society. In fact, I grew up in a society, that was marked not only by the crimes committed, but also by its perpetrators. My father was with the Reiter-SS. He was with the Wehrmacht and he was in Thessaloniki in Greece. I saw a photo of him when I was little. He's sitting on a table giving an order. I asked: "What were you doing there?" "What were you doing in Greece?" I knew that the Germans had committed crimes in Greece. Even on his deathbed my father said: "I wasn't aNazi." We had big arguments about it. We liked each other, but we argued a lot about it, because he never said what he did there. I went to Greece as a student. It took me many years to find out what happened in Greece during the German occupation. I went to Greece every year as a student and didn't know about these things. There is a photo of my father where he's sitting in a state coach with Hitler and Mussolini. I asked: "What were you doing there?" His reply: "l interpreted, that's all." This opportunism of a typical man ofhis generation has made me think agreat deal, because I loved my father dearly. I said to myself: "Such a nice man, who had six children, who was attentive and kind to them, how could he go to war? Why didn't he say that he wouldn't? It was striking in secondary school. He was a highly talented young man, a smart guy. When he returned to the village after passing his A levels, the others lifted him up, - I have a foto from that - like a wrestling king. He enjoyed it, of course, although he remained modest and unassuming at all times. He was aware of his abilities. But he never made use ofit. The time for saying goodbye has come. In 1959, Argyris is admitted to the reputed polytechnics in Zurich, where he studies maths and physics. A new life. He's interested in nuclear physics. As if he wanted to get to the bottom of the smallest tangible particles. Then he turns to astrophysics: The infinity ofthe universe. In this observatory in Zurich I saw a scientific telescope and was allowed to look through it. Anew dimension opened up for me, which I couldn't imagine at all when I was fifteen years old. A new world opened up for me, with other views and other rules. The radiance and the silence of the night sky, or ofthe entire sky vault, impressed me most at first. Its sparkle, its radiance, its protectiveness. I never lost this first impression throughout my scientific studies. The feeling remained constant. Ulysses in the stars. into the world, into the universe, and... into professional life. Argyris becomes aphysics teacher. He teaches at grammar schools in Zurich, where the loner has settled down. Literature becomes ever more important. He translates Greek authors into German: Kazantzakis, Seferis, Jannis Ritsos. He starts writing himself. Poems, essays and short stories. And in 1966 aplay: "Hostages of peace". An inquiry of blame, reconciliation, identity and being a stranger. Afirst analasys ofthe shadows ofthe past. Then Greek history catches up with him. There is a new catastrophe at home. Greece has not come to rest afterthe civil war. Any movement towards democracy was denounced as Communist. There are riots in parliament and demonstrations in the street. In the night of April 21, 1967, the colonels stage a coup, establishing abrutal dictatorship. Ashock to us Greeks abroad. We asked: "What can we do?" "We have to protest from here." We organised the first major demonstration on May 20, 1967. We were able to get Max Frisch as a speaker. Ahuge success, of course. But it also gave us apolitical streak. The new regime acts severely against opponents. Political mass trials, torture, and purges. Thousands of people are exiled in concentration camps. Long hair and miniskirts are prohibited. Who listened to music by Theodorakis, a spokesman of the democratic movement, could be imprisoned. It was a police state, instilling terror and fear. Anarrowing of horizons. Culture was persecuted. Those were bad times. But there were a few who held out, who listened to the radio in secret: Deutsche Welle and BBC. We listened to the forbidden songs by Theodorakis. Our constable, who wastotally uneducated, thought they were beautiful! But we listened to Theodorakis's songs as an act of resistance. Those were times of ignorance, of Fascism without ideology, dominated by uneducated people. Argyris becomes more active in Zurich. He foundsthe "Propylea Magazine". Aliterary forum for Greek expatriats. It was amagazine that was considered the organ of all those who were imprisoned. These are texts by Jannis Ritsos. Translated by Argyris. The texts had often been smuggled out ofprison. This is an edition of Propylea, in which Argyris assumed the pseudonym of Nikos Damianos. These are antiquarian gems. It's the story of the resistance in Greece from 1967 to 1974. Our friendship deepened in those days. Ritsos sent his poemsto Argyris, and Argyris sent them to me. I passed them on: a circulation of poems against dictatorship. Mikis Theodorakis becomes the symbol of resistance. He is imprisoned, tortured and exiled. Exiled Greeks organise concerts abroad, where his songs are performed. I rememberwhen Maria Farantouri came to Zurich from Paris and gave the first resistance concert. Of course we were all involved in the organisation ofthis concert. We hung aroundthe musicians a lot. We were wrapped up in these songs. The whole floor sang along. Ablossoming of all things Greek. Because I didn't submit to instructions, my mother has been waiting foryears to see me again, beyond the blue waves, beyond the blue sky. Argyris is blacklisted as an activist by the Greek junta. His Greek passport is not renewed. He doesn't have a Swiss passport. So he cannot travel anywhere. When a nephew is born in Distomo, and Argyris is to be his godfather, he cannot attend the christening. A catastrophe in Greece... My 3 sisters travelled with the baby through Yugoslavia by train. I picked them up in Innsbruck. We baptised him here and could see each of her for a fortnight and unfold emotionally. But those were difficult times because we knew we had to separate again. And nobody knew for how long. His host country has become his exile. Argyris applies for naturalisation. He has to hold out for four years, before he obtains Swiss citizenship, to his great relief. Avalid passport again at last! And, forthe first time in his life, a uniform. ASwiss army uniform. Greece is still ruled by generals. Yet their days are over. Due to increasing pressure at home and abroad, they stand down after seven long years. The leaden lethargy seems to have been lifted in one go. Theodorakis returns to his country. The return to democracy is celebrated in alegendary concert. Tens of thousands sing his songs, although they were prohibitedforyears. On anAugust morning, in the dawning hours, I went outside to breathe the scent of flowers. So strong and brave he was and I'll mourn his loss forever. His springing step, his beaming smile... Cursed be the hour, cursed be the day: The Fascists murdered him, the laughing boy. There is no stopping Argyris now. He boards a ship in Venice. He wants to return to Greece. First he meetsJannis Ritsos, the authorwhom he only knew through his poems. He pays regular visits to his youngest sister Kondylia. Argyris has been her guardian foryears. After leaving the orphanage, she has spent her life in nursing homes. How are you? Fine? -How have you been? - Fine. Gone swimming yet? Not yet. lt's too cold. -How are you? -Just fine. This is the whole family. I have put youfirst. Me and my sister Chryssoula. This is Vassilis with a bunch of flowers. Here are Dimitri's boys. Nikolakis and here Orestis. And here the three sisters. My entire family! Shall we play the game? Do you still know how? Do you remember me when I was little? -No. -When I was in the cradle? Did you sing lullabies to me? Can't you remember when Mummy was singing? I can't remember anything. My mind stood still. When did that happen? When I was little. Since the massacre. Your "mind has stood still" since the massacre? - Shall we sing the Easter song? -Yes. Easter Sunday has come and flowers are many. Pick some lilac, children. The air is filled with joy and song. Come, let us kiss each other. Let us lie in the meadow. Our paschal lamb is is getting cooked. And to celebrate the resurrection let us crack the eggs. The parents' house in Distomo... It's been uninhabited foryears. Argyris has brought it back to life. Somehow it takes me back, of course. It's more appropiate to say that deep inside I'm still that little boy. So it isn't about taking me back, but about continuing what used to be, despite outward changes and spiritual developments too. It is always present. Forforty-five months, I received so much from my parents, I was literally overattended, that I feel to this day how many reserves were built up in that short period oftime. I can still draw fromthem. They're not used up yet. Vassilis, who was baptised in Zurich, is getting married. One ofthe most important days in life, for his godfathertoo, who is also his best man. God's servant Ioanna is getting married to God's servant Vassilis. In the name ofthe Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. My life is atemporary arrangement. I have always felt abit like a wanderer. So it is difficult to find anyone with a similar outlook, who wants to join you on yourtravels. This is why living with someone has never been an aim for me. It wasn't the absence as such of apartner in life, but ratherthe absence of the desire to settle down and to say: "That's it." Don't be scared! It is said that time heals all wounds. When Willy Brandt knelt down in Warsaw in 1970 something was triggered within. I saw for the first time: there were humans in postwar Germany. I had a violent, positive emotional reaction. That no ambassador or Federal President Rau 4 years ago, had felt compelled to kneel down in front of the memorial and to be silent -silence is the strongest statement - but to use the corresponding gesture. This gesture of one single man: would it be conceivable between nations? Where does reconciliation start? Where does guilt end? At the end of the 70s, it is Arthur Bill who makes Argyris a proposal. His ex-teacher in the Children's village is building the Swiss relief organiation on behalf ofthe Swiss government. Argyris signs his first contract. He goes to Somalia for six months. He then follows a course at the Zurich polytechnic. Afterthat he is sent to Nepal. He works foryears in Indonesia, as a scientific advisor on how to set up highertechnical colleges. One ofthe greatest times in my life. It was very challenging professionally. I could use almost all my possibilities. Abeautiful country with very pleasant people. Those were four marvellous, almost heavenly years. Argyris travels extensively: Asia,Australia, and Oceania. He takes photos to his heart's content. Landscapes, people... and always the stars in the sky. It's difficult to say whether I carried less of my my past and all the tragedies I had to go through. Maybe... I saw it sort of suspended. It wasn't as rejected nor as unwelcome as in Europe to talk about it, to tell about one's experience, as to put it undertaboo. It was part of my life without being painful. Far, far away. Almost like paradise. Until health problems force him to return to Europe. Now bend forward and down, ist. as far as you can without pain. He travels increasingly between Greece and Switzerland. His stays in his old country get longer. Over 50 years have past since that fateful day in June. Should he remember? Should he forget? There is thistension, causing us, when remembering the incident, to be set back in our development too. You ask yourself: Would there have been other possibilities? The 3 1/2 year-old asksthis question. He keeps askingwithin me. At every crossroads, this is the crucial question: Do you want to keep working on it or are you going to flip, forget everything and simply try to enjoy life? Or follow psychiatrists' recommendations who tend to encourage you to bring it to a close and to resign yourself. But I told myself: I don't want to bring it to a close, I don't want to resign myself. I want to do something with my experience. I don't want to suppress it, or "digest" as shrinks say. Rather, it is a task that has been given to me. It is about this question I keep asking myself: What can I do to prevent it from happeningto others? Argyris decidesto appear in public. He chooses amythical location, only a few miles from Distomo. This isthe temple area ofDelphi. Onthe 50th anniversary ofthe massacre, in 1994, we organised apeace congress here with Greek, Swiss and German speakers. We discussedthe topic of war and why there are wars, why there are such exaggerated acts such as massacres, and what ways could be found to get out ofthis vicious circle in world history. PEACE CONGRESS Greeks and Germans exchange views. Scientists, historians, family members and survivors ofDistomo talk to each other. Friendships are formed. However... no German offials participate. Imagine a survivor ofDistomo inviting the German ambassador inAthens to a widely attended peace congress: professors from Switzerland, France, and many other countries. The ambassador not only doesn't turn up, but doesn't react to the invitation. He could have sent a word of absence. Instead he sendstwo secretaries who incognito note everything that is said at the congress, what people like me or others say... It is quite an insult! I imagine there was the impression ofbeing put in the dock. Moreover, it is obvious that victims andthe German state perforce have different viewpoints. Argyris rents an attic flat in Athens. His very personal peace offer, the congress in Delphi, is it too small and insignificant to be noticed by politics? Give up? Considerthe matter closed? The fall ofthe Berlin wall and the end of the Cold War change the European situation once more. When East andwest Germany make peace, a reunification agreement is signed between the 2 countries and the 4 allies the so-called "2+4 agreement". It has explosive legal consequences. For Greece as well. Although it is called "2+4 agreement", it is seen as compensation in international politics, the equivalent of a peace treaty. And so the situation arose: the reparation payments defined at the London conference had to be paid in principle. In the case of Greece: 7 billion dollars. Plus interest. 1,600 villages destroyed, over 100,000 victims, and dozens of massacres inthe country. On behalf ofthe mayor of Distomo, Argyris enquires at the German embassy, how these claims can be asserted. The embassy answers 3 months later. The events in Distomo are not classified as massacres, as war crimes, but as "a measure within the framework of war strategy". This was the main reason for me to try with every means possible to publicise those events in all their cruelty in Germany. In September 1995, we went to court in Bonn, the former seat of government of the Federal Republic. My three sisters and I sued for compensation of 20,000 DM, to raise the question of the Distomo massacre in court. The way I know him, it wasn't about receiving money. It was about seeing justice, about bringing justice. And about remembering the murder of his fellow men in Distomo. 290 family members and descendants file a collective action in Greece. Attorney Jannis Stamoulis represents their cause in all instances, up to the Areos Pagos, the highest court in Greece. It clearly confirms that Germany is condemned to pay 28 million Euros to the victims of Distomo. Germany does not accept this judgement. He who steals has to pay. The Germans committed theft: the fathers and grandfathers of those who live today. What does it mean if you refuse to pay for your father's debt? I believe it would be an eternal stain onthe German nation. In Athensthere is an outburst. Attorney Stamoulis starts pledging German property in Greece inJuly 2000. In an action with great media coverage he has the Goethe Institute measured and sets a date for a forced sale. Diplomatic discomfort is huge. Only the minister of justice's veto prevents the auction at the last second. Argyris's and his sisters' suit was meanwhile dismissed in Bonn. The higher instance in Cologne does not decide in their favour either. Over eight years have passed since the first action, until finally the Federal court takes its decision in June 2003. The survivors of victims of an SS massacre in Greece receive no compensation from Germany. The Federal Court in Karlsruhe rejected the claim of 4 siblings. The massacre of Distomo was one of the most atrocious war crimes. Yet the Senate had to solve the question of compensation with the legal dispositions at hand. With its sentence, the Federal court saved Germany from multibillion claims. The plaignants can appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court or to the Court ofHuman Rights. Distomo's nightmares aren't overyet. And nobody knows what the future will bring. I agree with ourfriend, who lost 30 relatives, who experienced as a child what I read and what I've told you. lfl'd seen the scenes that I've described, I wouldn't forget them all my life. It won't be settled on a legal level in the Federal Republic of Germany. And it's questionable ifthose who have suffered will get anything out ofit, ifthe issue is put before the Court ofHuman Rights. We've moved on sixty years. Today we're in a situation in which most ofthe states that used to be at war with us or that were occupied by Germany are our allies. We have been in politics together since the early 50s, and we are NATO allies. I think it should be generally understandable that Germany does not negotiate war compensation with allies any more. That there is consensus in Germany to pay nothing is quite incredible. I wreck my neighbour's place, who then comes and says: "You must pay!" I reply: "Are you crazy?" "That was 10 years ago." Argyris cannot give up. He appears before the German public. He finds more support in the country of former perpetrators than anticipated. During the exhibition "Crimes ofthe Wehrmacht" he is invited to Hamburg, Nuremberg and other cities. The subject of his talk: Wars must not be profitable. But he's also confronted with Old Germany. In Bavaria the veterans' meeting of mountain infantry men is held. Former elite soldiers ofthe Wehrmacht, responsible for countless war crimes. Also in Greece. Argyris participate in a counterevent. He wants to break the taboo of absolute soldier obedience, behind which perpetrators can hide. This is something which has bothered me a great deal throughout my life: how soldiers could behave so brutally for an hour or one and a halfhours in Distomo. I can't get it out ofmy mind. I think it should be possible to build in constraints in training to prevent it from happening at all. In 2005 the German working group Distomo invites him to a congress in Berlin. In the country of former offenders. Let's imagine these soldiers entering houses, obeying the command oftotal destruction which confers terrible, absolute freedom of action. Screaming wildly they break into the house and kill men, old women, children, ugly women. They spare the most beautiful woman and rape her, while her father, her husband, her mother and her brother are lying in their blood. The sisters K. were found dead and raped. The child of G.P. hadwounds all over. The unbaptised newborn off. had almost been cut in half. Some German killedthe mother L.B. with a bullet. She was holding a40-day-old baby in her arms. The baby started screaming, whereupon the irate soldier stepped on its head with all his might, so that its brain gushed out. Acouple was burnt alive. Soldiers enjoyed watching the dance ofthe burning bodies. Four villagers were found slaughtered, their guts wrapped around their heads. Most inhabitants that had remained behind were massacred, among them45 children, 53 women, 75 elderly people, 20 children below the age of 5, and six unbaptised babies. I had a dream. In my dream, the commander who orderedthe killing lay down next to men, mutilated babies, and a pregnant woman with a dead baby in her belly. The commanderfelt ice-cold. His back was as hard as rock, his feet and his forehead were ice-cold, his jaw frozen. Now he's lying by the murdered people and slowly, starting in his abdomen, his chest, he starts shaking, almost imperceptibly, until he breaks into a soft weeping. The dead lie there, huddledtogether, peaceful, to the sounds ofhis endless weeping reaching all corners of the universe. Then everything is quiet. In my dream. June 10, 2004: The 60th anniversary ofthe massacre. Distomo prepares forthe 2-day event. Ambassador Spiegel has announced his attendance at the ceremony. It is an incredibly difficult subject and it is very difficult to be present at such aplace, be it in Auschwitz or other places, knowing that these crimes were committed in the name of Germany. But I'm going there deliberately. I think it's extremely important that I, as an ambassador, or any German representative goesthere, to convey the impression that we mourn the victims too. Praised be our Lord! Now and in eternity. Amen. Ioannou, Dimitras, Georgias, Louka, Dimitras, Panajotis, Marias, Othonos, Elenis, Toulas, Athanasias, Ioannou... You can try putting yourself in a victim's place. But you'll never succeed. Such a dialogue involvesthe danger of talking at cross-purposes, of intending something different, of not going down well, because a certain keyword is missing. This is the first German representative to speak at the day of remembrance. Dear Mayor. Dear citizens of Distomo, dear friends and hosts of the town. Unfortunately there has been a tendency to forget and suppress this black chapter in our history. This is amistake, which I will resist. As we all know, rememberance is the key to reconciliation. Only those countries that know their history have a future. Venerable citizens of Distomo: I hope that you'll remember one thing in particular of my speech this evening: Our plea forforgiveness. I would like to present my apologies. The fact that the German ambassador appears 60 years after the event and apologizes officially What does it mean? It is a total linguistic decline. Why does he apologize? Does he expect usto forgive him, his government or whoever? ! Has he thought about what it means? To use the word "apology" sixty years later, as a delegate, in a sort of diplomatic set exercise? It's never been about remorse, about insight pointing the way ahead. Over sixty years have passed since that day in June. Almost an entire lifetime. Resist? Bring a charge? Accept? Continue living... with such a story. - Gamvrili Sophia, 43 years! -Here! -Zissis Nikolaos, 71 years! -Here! -Zissis Panajotis, 66 years! -Here! Sfountouri Vassiliki of Athanassios, 32 years.

Then it'll only be 12 minutes before you're back with the right one. Hi, there. How can I help you? Hey! Dispatch give you the wrong parcel? Okay, so what you do is, you wait for her to go off on her lunch, then you nip back in, get them to sign for it before you hand it over, then dispatch can sort out their own mess. I'm Malky McGovern. Graeme Obree. Yeah, I know who you are. I'm a big cycling fan. Come on, Graeme! Well done, Graeme! Look, there's Daddy. We just got here a minute ago. I'll put the kettle on. Don't let him rip you off. Make it 300, you got a deal. Look, son, you've gone bust. Maker your mind up, it's either 200 or nothing. Okay, 200 it is. I'm sorry, you're better off going up the road. Oh, not with this antique. Aye, right. What can I do for you? Well, I need a new... An old crank. I don't think so, but let's see. Oh, aye. Once upon a time, eh? I'm afraid I don't follow cycling. I heard of him, though. Boardman. He's good, isn't he? Aye, well, he was always the man to beat. And still is, the bugger. Right. These young boys, full of bright ideas, but they can't stand the pace. You mind if I deliver that one myself? Haven't got time, son. I've got a buyer coming to the yard. That's okay, be there before you. Are you trying to be funny? Tell you what, you get there before me you can keep the 200, I get there before you, I get the other hundred I wanted. This gentleman here can hold the cash. If you've no objection. He's done. Maybe not. The little... Oh, come on. I'm fine. That was mad. It's been said before. Well, it's gonna cost 300 to repair the van. You could have killed him, man! It's all right. I would have won anyway if he hadn't have cheated. You weren't perfect yourself, son. Anyway, have to grab your chance. And trust to the Lord. When it comes to religion, Karl Marx got it right. I'll find a crank for you. Drop by sometime next week. We're in the flat above the shop. Mr... Baxter. Douglas Baxter. All right, Chris? So, what are you doing with this lot? Putting food on the table and paying the odd bill. But you're famous. You still hold the British one-hour record. But I gotta make a living like everybody else. Have a sandwich. Cheers. But all the same. Oh, Jesus, what have you got in this? Is that marmalade? Enough sugar to keep you going all day. Aye, but it tastes horrible. Couple of these for breakfast, I'm up the road in no time. That's 30 miles away. Thirty-two and a half. And if you're not gonna eat that, I'll have it back. What about Chris Boardman, then? He's going for the world one-hour later this year. But then again, that record hasn't stood for nine years for nothing, has it? You've been head to head a few times with Boardman, haven't you? You think he can do it? If anyone can do it, God can. Right, time's up. Fair enough. What's the problem? On you go, I'll catch you up. Is something wrong? I can fix it, I'm good at that stuff. No, there's no problem. Just got an idea. On you go! You're wasting a good head start. What the hell have you done? Been out with Graeme, I see. He's inside. Do you want fish and chips? And a pickle. This is Katie. Hiya. What do you think? Yeah, definitely got something. Look at him. Is that her bike? Oh, no, she just borrows it off her granny at the weekends. Where are we off to now? You got that tube? Yeah, yeah, got it. See, I told you it would be okay. So, Katie's a biker, eh? I suppose she's got tattoos and all that stuff? Bikers are into that kind of thing, aren't they? Then again, I suppose she's got a Hells Angel for a boyfriend. Who's is it? I just dropped by and I was wondering if you'd found that new crank for me? One second. And you dropped a few bits and pieces when you took off like that. It's for a new bike I'm building. They were throwing that out anyway. It's really not stealing... That'll have been in the dump... just bits and pieces... in a few days and we're in a hurry because Graeme's... and Rubbish that they couldn't sell. got a new idea. Who's this? It's Malky. Malky McGovern. What new bike? Why do skiers crouch like this? Better aerodynamics. Exactly. So why not for cycling, too? I tried reversing the handlebars but after about 20 miles or so I realized it's not enough. Gotta go the whole way, build a new bike. Forget all the rules, start from scratch. But to what end? Break the world one-hour record. Which stands at? Fifty-one and a bit kilometers. It's thirty-two miles, more or less. Well, nobody can accuse you of thinking small. But hold it, hold it, before we all get carried away here. Even if you could do it, this kind of thing takes lots of money. First, there's the money to build the bike. Then you need to find a world-standard velodrome which we don't have around here and pay for that. Including all the time keepers and all that... Okay, you got the job. What job? Well, Anne used to be my manager before, but she's got enough on her plate as it is. You can take over. Where do you plan to build this bike? Well, I hadn't got that far yet but... I do have a tendency to hoard. So, anything you can use, go ahead. This is fantastic. A toast... To a new world record. To a new world record. Eight weeks from now. Oh, wait a minute. What do you mean eight weeks from now? Your man Boardman's going for it in nine weeks. Well, then, let's do it in eight. Morning. How are you doing? You tell me. Aye, that's what I'm after. I'll leave it in the shed for you. I didn't know you were into hi-tech. Make do and mend. That's the Obree approach. It must be a killer. Going at that rate for an hour. Killer's not the word for it. Francesco Moser set the record, it stood for nine years. Eddy Merckx held it before Moser, said it burned three years off his life. Merckx swore he'd never go through that kind of torture again. And he was the greatest cyclist ever. He won the Tour de France five times. Before him there was Archambaud, Baldini and Coppi and Anquetil. Falling behind at seven hours, 29 and a half minutes from the start... Baldini. Okay, fine. The PR Manager's running a bit late, his secretary says, so if you could just wait a few minutes. No problem. Don't I know you from somewhere? No, I don't think so. Yeah, I'm sure I've seen you. Thanks. Usual routine, darling. Okay. Cheers. Malky, my man. You here for a job? No. Oh, I remember now. You were in here last week. You're not running a personal management company, you're just a delivery boy. No... We'll just leave it. Is it about Malky taking over? No, I'm delighted about Malky taking over. I know we need the money. I know I've got to keep on at the hospital. Are you sure this is the right thing to do? Going for the record? Sure, why not? 'Cause in spite of all the hassles, things have been quite good recently. I don't want them spoiled. It won't spoil anything. I can handle it, I promise. How did you catch the cycling bug? Oh, same as any other wee boy. I got a bike for Christmas one year. There must be more to it than that. Did you go cycling with your pals? Better get on. Hiya. Katie. Cappuccino. Thank you. Tea. Thank you. Thank you. So what are you dressed up like that for? Just walking the streets. You raising sponsorship for Graeme? How's it going? Well, how much have you got so far? To be honest, wouldn't pay for these coffees. Go and see this guy. Tell him that Katie sent you. Who is he? A serial parking offender who has seen the light. You meet all sorts in my job. It might appeal to him. Can't hurt to try. That's great. Thanks. Listen, I was thinking maybe we could go out and get a drink sometime. A drink? Did you think I'd show you my tattoos if you bought me a drink? How can I go out with a man who shaves his legs more than I do? No, Graeme, your bum does not look big in those. Well, that was a sexist remark. What are you gonna do about it? Lie down here on your back and close your eyes. How could I resist? Now raise your legs. Right. And pedal. This better lead to something memorable. Now, you see how close they are together... No, no, bring them back. There you go. Keep going, yeah. Now, check that. The natural, comfortable way is one banana wide. So why are pedals made two bananas apart? That's why you got me down here on the floor? To give me a lecture about pedals and bananas? Why, what else could we do down here? Graeme? Are you all right? Yep. Just got a design problem. Just trying to figure it out. Oh, aye. Seems like Dark Night of the Soul to me. Everyone gets a bit down sometimes. Oh, aye, sure. Listen... I've got some work next week and I need a cog-and-wheels type. Fancy giving me a hand next Saturday? Aye. Good. So you see, Mr. Armstrong, cycling is universally popular. Well, not so much in the UK, of course. Why would you want to sponsor Graeme? Well, because he's pretty special, really. I mean, for a Scotsman, that is. And, cycling could be a lot more popular if he wins... That's about it, really. Francesco Moser, eh? What a man. What a cyclist. I mean, that one-hour record... Pure brilliance. You've gotta take your hat off to him. But to think of that record being held by a Scotsman. Eh? By God, what a thrill that would be! I'd offer you a drink, but... I must get off. Club outing tonight. I'm going out to the Trossachs and back. That sweet highland air. Rapid Employment will be proud to assist such a splendid initiative. How much have you raised already? It's going a bit slower than I'd hoped. Nothing, then. Yeah. Excellent. Rapid Employment will get all the publicity. Great. Come by tomorrow, same time. We'll talk figures. Great. Thanks. Yes! Oh, you beauty. Graeme. What is it exactly you're doing? How does a washing machine spin at 1200 revolutions a minute? Bearings. Beautiful bearings, in their own casing. What does your wife say? She was all right about it. Well, you're a lucky man. You were never married? Aye, she died. I'm sorry. A long time ago. So, this sponsorship deal that Malky's landed, it is enough? Just. It'll get us to Norway well before Chris makes his attempt on the record at Bordeaux. And we've got the stadium and the timekeepers for 24 hours. And now we've got the machine. Okay... Let's hear it for... Now, most of the tubing is actually from the BMX bikes. And these rear ends are part of an old padlock. And my washing machine. Well, the bearings are in here. But this bit's part of the washing machine frame. Gives it extra strength. So, you gonna get on it? And off we go. So what do you think? Well, you're right. Nobody's ever seen anything like that before. Not bad for a first day. Okay, could have been better, but I'm beginning to get the feel of the bike and... That is the last place we should have been testing a bike. That was stupid. It was the only bloody place. Okay, if there was even a bog-standard track within 50 miles of here, fine. Will you just get off my case and do your job? For God's sake, Graeme. The bike that Boardman's going on cost half a million to develop and it was designed by a computer. So how the hell is that thing that's made out of scrap and washing machine parts going to break a record that's stood since... Well, since before they were born? What's that for, big man? The circus? Aye. Aye, that's right, son. You get one thing straight, Malky. I know what I'm doing here. Maybe it doesn't look like it, but this bike's been built according to the laws of physics. There's a scientific reason for every single bit of design. And that's how I'm gonna break the record with or without you. Graeme, he's trying to help you, that's all. Well, I don't need his help. I can do this on my own. Lord, Savior, Holy Spirit. Upon us, and upon this world. We ask you to bless Jonathan and to keep him within your sight, as he grows into manhood. And though we cannot ask you to keep him from all harm in this world, still we hope, that you will stay by his side in difficult times. And give him the strength to rise from despair and self-doubt. Jonathan, I baptize thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. You've done a good job, Malky. Couldn't have done it without phoning you twice a day. And the tickets. This one's for me, I'm not coming. Yes you are. Katie says you and Graeme are a team and that's good enough for me. There isn't enough money for the three of us to go to Norway. Yeah, well, I'm paying for myself. Malky I really appreciate it, but I've got no one to mind Ewan. Katie's gonna take some time off. She'll look after him. It's all sorted. Are you still worried about the bike? Yeah. And that is why you have to be there. You see, I've got a contingency plan that Graeme doesn't know about. I thought if you knew right away you might think I was after your soul. And aren't you? Souls are God's business. Mine is people. So, how are you feeling? Under control. Well, the hour is almost at hand. Bring it on. I'm raring to go. Good turnout. It's not for me. They're getting ready to announce the world championships. Moser's over there. Francesco Moser is over there. He's on the WCF council now. Who's that with him? I don't know. Some suit. Right, let's get Old Faithful put together, give them all a heart attack. Can I talk to you first? What about? Actually... Can I show you something? I got onto Mike Burrows, told him what the situation was and he said okay, he'd take a crack at it. I didn't know if it was gonna be ready in time, that's why I haven't said anything till now. I gave him all the specs. It's exactly the same as Old Faithful. All the ideas that you built into it, but it's the work of a world-class bike builder. And I think you should... You know... What do you think? Well, it's not exactly the same as Old Faithful. Burrows has used 32 mil not 16. So it's heavier. Right. Hey, the wheels... Specialized made them. And if you beat the record, they'll sponsor you for a whole year. Just give me a minute, will you? Sure. You knew about this? You always said Mike Burrows knows what he's doing. Don't use it if you don't want to. Graeme! My friend! Allow me to introduce Ernst Hagemann. It's nice to meet you. Hello. You built this yourself? No, it was Mike Burrows. I did the design and put together the original model. What is wrong with the original? It took a bit of a battering in the road trial stage so... Don't worry, it conforms to every WCF regulation, I made sure of that. It doesn't worry me, Mr. Obree. It would only matter if you were to break Francesco's record. Graeme, wait, please. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, clear the track please. - Okay, 205 laps... - Graeme, this is it. That's what you've got to beat. Set's ready. Give me a nod and I'll give you... Fifty-one... a five second countdown. point one five kilometers... That's 31.7 miles. Which is almost exactly the same as the journey from Prestwick to Glasgow but no hills. No traffic, no roundabouts. And when the gun goes off, you've broken the world record. In five, four, three, two, one. Go! Come on, Graeme! Come on! Come on, Graeme! Come on, Graeme, you can do it. I know you can do it, come on! Go on! ANNE: Come on, Graeme, come on! Go on, Graeme! Come on, Graeme! Come on, keep going, come on. Go on, Graeme! Go on. Go on, Graeme! Come on, Graeme! Well done, Graeme. Well, he's missed it. Graeme! Graeme, are you okay? That was a brilliant effort, Graeme. Just two laps off, that's all! You did bloody great. It was the bike, it was that new bike. It wasn't the bike, it was me. Okay, get all these people out of here. Just do it, Malky! Look, just step back. Give him some air. Come on! Step back. This is total fucking failure again. Don't do that. Look at me. Graeme, don't do that. Don't do that, Graeme. Okay. Okay. Wait. No, he's going over here. Get out of the way, you. Wait, wait, wait. Graeme, how are you feeling? Bravo, sandwich man! I'm going again. Impossible, the WCF must have access. Well, 24 hours, that was what my manager agreed with the people here. So, we've got the stadium till 10:30 tomorrow morning. But Graeme... 9:00 tomorrow morning. You English are mad! You wanna know what mad is, try calling me English again. I'm a Bavarian, I'm very proud to be called German. But I know you Irish Scots are always fighting you can't help it, Ja? What are you doing? Making sure I exercise every couple of hours to stop my legs seizing up. No alarm clock like a full bladder. We've slept in! We've slept in! We've gotta be on the tracks in 30 minutes. Where in the bloody hell's Malky? Malky! Malky! We're late. I've rebuilt Old Faithful for you. She's ready if you're ready. Malky, you wee beauty. That clock should be set. What's wrong with it? I think he slept in as well. This is a shambles. Excuse me! He's going for it now. Excuse me! He's going for it now! Oh, please, after you. Thank you. I haven't had breakfast. This is insanity, Graeme. You will cripple yourself, maybe something even worse than that. Right, you ready? Go! Come on, Graeme! Come on, Graeme! Go on, Graeme! Go on. Keep going, Graeme! Come, you're doing great. Go for it! Same as yesterday. He's a slow starter. Come on, Graeme! Shift it! Come on! Move it, Graeme! Come on, Graeme! Come on, keep going! This is where it went wrong yesterday. That was yesterday. Come on, Graeme! Move it! He cannot continue like this. Yeah, you're right. Come on, Graeme. It's time he really started to pile on. Come away, Graeme! Keep going, baby! Come on! Come on, Graeme! Come on! Move it, Graeme! Come on, Graeme! Come on, Graeme! Come on, keep going, Graeme! You can do it, Graeme. Come on. You're nearly there. Come on, Graeme! Keep going, Graeme! He's a whole lap up on where you were at this point. Come away, Graeme! On you come! Come on, Graeme! Keep going! Come on, Graeme! That's a good... He's gonna do it. He's actually gonna do it. Come on, Graeme, you're gonna do it! Come on! You're gonna do it! Go, go! Faster! Come on, Graeme! You did it! You did it! Bravo! Yes! You did it! Congratulations, Graeme! Absolutely amazing! On behalf of Specialized, I'm proud to give you this check, and to announce a year's sponsorship. Go on! Graeme. Malky... Just leave him. Why? He's missing the party. Graeme, congratulations! I see you made the front page. Well, the local paper, anyway. I just wanted to say thank you for your help. Oh, I didn't make much of a contribution. Which would seem to be the way in other cases, as well. What do you mean? Do you remember what Karl Marx said about surplus value? You're looking at it. Apparently the powers that be feel that this town is too small for two congregations so there's gonna be a merger. One of the churches is gonna be sold off to a property developer. Agnes, go in. Be with you in a minute. Now, Graeme, I've got work to do. Will you excuse me? One of my parishioners, her husband has just passed away. She's got a few problems coping. Hi, sorry we're late. Guess who kept going on about keeping inside the speed limit? What? Well, there's plenty of time. It doesn't start for another half an hour. So, where's Graeme? Going for a run. Said he'd better things to do than watch a non-event. The English rider, Chris Boardman, Great Britain's Olympic champion is certain to break the one-hour record so recently established by Graeme Obree. Here he goes! And how devastating this must be to his arch-rival Obree. But the world one-hour record holder is now an Englishman. Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry, thanks. Cheers. Cheers, thanks. Is that not Obree? Hello, yes, I'd like to make a reverse-charge call, please. All right, Graeme? Yeah, it's 01632960433, that's Prestwick. I knew it was you. You're a world champion now, some shite like that, eh? I'm just trying to make a call here. Oh, right, aye, aye. So, what you doing back here then, champ? Just come back to show us, did you? Fuck off. Hi, Anne, it's me. Aye, listen I've got a puncture, could Malky come and pick me up? Yeah. Malky? Yeah, I'm back in the valley of the damned at the pub in the main street. Aye. Yeah. Okay. Listen, what did Boardman do? Seven hundred meters more? That's more than the margin I beat Moser's record by. Right, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. What the fuck do you want? See, here he is. Thinks he's the big man now, eh? But I can remember what we used to do to him. Yeah, you made my life hell. Are you proud of that? Come on, Graeme, eh? It's just a bit of fun, mate, that's all. You wee shites! You dirty bastards! Steady! Fuck off! Fuck off! Go on, then! Fuck off! Supposed to be world champion, man. You know what? You take a good fucking look at me. 'Cause this is the closest you'll ever get to anything worthwhile. Okay, it's a pain in the arse, but this is what I was thinking. We book Hamar again for, say, the end of the year, after the Specialized money's run out. Then we announce you're going for Boardman's record. You'll get plenty of people to sponsor you then. We'll get them to make bids. No. They'll be lining up around the block. The man from nowhere returns. The Flying Scotsman rides again. No, I'm gonna go for the worlds. But you don't do that kind of racing. Not the four-kilometer sprint. You're a long-distance man. Fifty-one kilometers or four, it's still what I do. Yeah, well... Right enough, I suppose. Twelve months to get ready for it. I'm going for it this year. What? No, that's... That's totally impossible. You've only got five weeks. That's fine. Pressure works for me. Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Boardman. As you know, the annual bring and buy sale is gonna take place in four weeks' time. You have to be impressed that novice Obree has even made it into the semi-finals of the World Championship. But of course, Boardman's the clear favorite with his half-million pound, computer-designed carbon-fiber super-bike that he rode to a gold medal in the Olympics. Two riders chase each other from opposite sides of the track for 16 laps. It's 4,000 meters of agony. Five, four, three, two, one, go! The Christian band were really rocking with the Lord... An astonishing time. 4:22.668. A new world record for Graeme Obree, who goes through into the final. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Please forgive that short pause. I get quite excited by the prospect of the annual bring and buy sale. He's beaten the other semi-finalist, Chris Boardman, by 2.384 seconds. You've broken the record. It's a new world record! World record? You're joking. Oh, my legs. Congratulations, Graeme. Awesome ride. But you need a better helmet. Here, use mine for the final. And the best of luck. Thanks. Another world record, a new world champion. He won! Your dad's a world champion! Graeme? Graeme? Sorry, didn't mean to make you jump, but the reception's... And don't we look like a couple of swells. Listen, Malky, I know Anne's told you about me. Good. We should get downstairs, eh? I just get really down sometimes, and... Then I tell myself, "Get a grip, man." And I pull myself out of it. I mean, there's nothing really wrong with me, you know. Love you. Hello. Hello. Hey, Anne. Someone called Bourget's been on the phone about exhibition rides in France. Money up front, accommodation for all of us, that's what he said, anything for the new champion and we can go in our new car. What's wrong with the one we got? Have you actually looked at it? This time we get something a bit better. Think we should turn left here. Malky, who's driving? Oh, aye. Oh, my God. Oh, my word. My goodness, Graeme, is this for real? Almost like there's some sort of... I don't have a pen. Hello. When you tried to beat the record of the one hour we all wanted you not to stop ever, to continue for always. And even if you had built eyes for the bicycle, oh, for sure, they would have been crying. Yes. Is it gonna be like this everywhere? Why not? We deserve it. You deserve it. But how can manufacturers persuade people to buy the right bikes, when a washing machine on wheels can break records? Is he cheating? Drugs, perhaps? No you can forget that. He takes nothing. We even tested one of his sandwiches. Just oranges and sugar. You know, I loathe seeing him ride. His position is so grotesque, so ugly. And unstable. He fell off last week. Oh, yeah? He fell off? We have come to the conclusion that the riding technique of Herr Obree could cause him to hurt himself especially if he were to fall from his machine at high speed. And not only that, such an accident could cause serious injury to other cyclists. It has therefore been agreed that the riding position of Herr Obree will not be allowed under W... Please, let me finish, under WCF rules. Thank you very much. It's ridiculous to say it's unsafe, I've only ever fallen once and, you know, it's no miracle machine, either. Otherwise I'd win every race. No way. The bike meets all the WCF's regulations, so now they're just making up new ones. Okay, I'm going. You know you don't need to work. What am I supposed to do when you're away on tour with all your cycling groupies? I wish. Oh, do you now? The way things are going, I'll be spending a lot more time at home. Hagemann and his pals are really out to get me. Well, you're a threat. You got to the top the wrong way. A few more like you and those people won't be running things anymore. No more gravy train. Yeah, that's what makes me so angry. Well, that's healthier than being depressed. You'll find ways to get one up on them. Now, because of the WCF's concerns about safety, I've made a few modifications. So, ladies and gentlemen I give you the new, ultra-safe Obree bike. Let's see the back. He thinks he's so clever, this Mr. Obree. Stand back, stand back. We must not allow him to make fools of us. But every time we change the rules, he changes his bike to comply. Yeah, then you try again. That's as far back as it'll go. Oh, great. Your bike contravenes the regulations. Saddles must be five centimeters behind the center of the bottom bracket. Christ's sake, you inspected the bike yesterday. You okayed it. Five centimeters. All saddles must be complete and intact, Mr. Obree. If I use this. First thing I ever designed. It must be possible to purchase all parts in the commercial market. That's just not true. All the top cyclists have their bikes personally made for them. They would cost thousands to buy in a shop. Oh, yes. But if you had thousands you could buy it. That is the point. The changes I had to make to the handlebars mean it's very difficult for me to get into position on a commercial saddle, 'cause they're so big. There is no rule about the design of a saddle. Well, it... It doesn't break the letter of the rules, but it breaks the spirit of the rules. "The spirit of the rules"? Exactly, the spirit. This is from a 12 year-old's mountain bike, so we're not breaking any rules. Sound. What's this? Bastards! Hagemann just invented a new rule. There has to be a gap between the rider's chest and his hands. A gap? How much? He won't quantify it. Is it strange that I'm the only one who rides with his chest on his hands? Yeah, exactly. I'll tell you what the new rule is. Nobody called Graeme Obree's allowed to win the World Championships. Here's what we're gonna do. We'll replace it with the Tri-bars. They can't object to that. You can get down low enough on these and you'll still win. No. I'm sticking with Old Faithful the way she is. You'll be out of the championship. I won doing it my way, I'll lose it doing it my way. What's that supposed to mean? That's a lot of bollocks, Graeme, and you know it. Look, I'm your manager, right? It's my job to organize things so you win and I'm asking you to use these bars and just go out there and give it the Obree magic. Graeme, it's your only chance. I'm doing it my way, Malky. Win, lose or get disqualified. To hell with you, then. So, a red flag will be raised by an official if his chest touches his hands. Three red flags and he's out. Come on, Graeme. Come on, lad. I have to say that the whole thing a good cop. Not too late to change your mind . Lot of good cops want to drop the whole kit and caboodle. And who wouldn't? The pay stinks and you're up to your ears in human scum 16 hours a day. But it gets in your blood . A lot of good cops get to the point of slapping their badge down on this desk and find they just can't do it. How about you? Will you stick with the team? No, captain. I don't think I will . Like I say, they make me ask. You understand . How are the kids? I don't have any. What the hell? I'd like to take my stick to these clerks. -The file says-- -We lost a child . Lost it? Her.Lost her. Yes, of course.Her. That's rough. Well, it can be. Yes, sir. Still married, right? Yes, sir, I am . That's good . Where you going? -I'm going home. -Not this way. -Why not? -Metrorail construction, that's why not. Go around . Just follow your tootsies. You sure you don't want something? Coffee, soda, something? No, thank you, ma'am . I feel kind of stupid about this. Better safe than sorry. That's what I thought. You have a restraining order against your husband? Ex-husband . He'd show up on the wrong day or in the middle of the night, pounding on the door. Thing is, he has this horrendous temper. I didn't know if a restraining order was a good idea and if it'd do more harm than good . But the judge said we should make an example of him . So he can't come within 100 feet of us. Or is it yards? Which is it? Feet or yards? That's up to the judge. -I thought it was a set thing . -It's at his discretion. That's interesting . Does he drink? Oh, I thought you meant the judge! -No, I wouldn't say so. -Do drugs? But he has a propensity for violence? Yeah, I think you could say that. Did he strike the little girl? Did he strike you? Not exactly. Not exactly? You know, there were times when I thought he was going to but I just didn't want to wait until he got around to it. It's hard to explain. He could, I think. You think? Hello, sir. How are you today? I'm doing all right. -How about you? -Me? I'm terrible. I'm sorry. I came from Santa Barbara, and my friend wasn't home and he owes me money so I have no money to go home. I'm almost out of gas. I had to sleep in my car. Do you have a few bucks? It would really help me out. Give me your address, I'll mail it back.Honest. -Let me see your driver's license. -What for? It'll have your address on it. -I don't have a license. -You drove all the way without it? Are you a cop? Let's see your car registration and your car. All right, forget it. Okay, just forget it! That's a hell of a way to treat a vet, man. -You're an animal doctor? -No, a veteran.I was in Nam . You must've been 10 years old . I meant to say the Gulf. Come on! All I'm asking for is a little change. I haven't eaten in three days. Well, I mean, except for this. Fuck it! Give me some money, man. Just give me some money. How about a dime? Give it to me. I'm not giving you any. -You got a cigarette? -No. -You gotta give me something . -Why don't you get a job? This is my park.I live here! Who are you, walking through my park with two bags? I don't got any.Is that fair? What's in those bags, anyway? Give me one. I could sell those bags and eat for a week with the money. You've got two of them . Why do you need two? You're right. Here. -Are you serious? -I don't need it anymore. All right! Come on, now . Come on.What the-- Son of a bitch! -Can we cut the crap this time? -I'm telling you the truth! Yeah, right. -What's up? -She was at the drive-by shooting . -Angie, who hit your guys? -I told you. We know .The big bad white man. We're not buying it. Who are you protecting? They put your boyfriend in the hospital . He's probably dead . Do you realize that? He's probably fucking dead ! -Stop saying that! -You picked a good day to leave. You want another 3-year-old to get shot in the head? Is that what you want? Tell me the truth! I'm telling you the truth! It was a white guy! -Why would he go after your friends? -I don't know ! He attacked them on Angel's Flight Hill with a baseball bat! A baseball bat? Wait! Baseball bat. What did this guy look like? I don't know . He looked like you except he was taller and had hair. Good description, Angie! Did he wear a white shirt and tie? Come over here, will you? We gotta keep the pressure on her. Don't interrupt. What about the bat? -The white shirt and tie! -What will she think of next? I'm sorry you're leaving, but you are. -Sanchez, listen to me! -Check me later, babe. Remember that storekeeper, the Korean guy? -Mr.Lee? -Come here. Where was his place? Right there. He was assaulted sometime after 8 a.m .? -About that. -And the drive-by was here, right? What's going on? I may be nuts, but Angel's Flight Hill is between those two spots. -It was a classy neighborhood . -It's a shit hole.Gangland . I know .What would a white guy in a shirt and tie be doing in gangland? Hi .Can I help you? I'd like a ham and cheese Whamlette, an order of Wham fries-- Sorry, we stopped serving breakfast. We're on the lunch menu. I want breakfast. We're not serving it. So you said . Is that the manager? Could I speak to him, please? Sure. Rick, a customer would like to speak to you. Yes, sir. I'd like some breakfast. We stopped serving breakfast. I know you stopped breakfast, Rick. Sheila told me you stopped .... Why am I calling you by first names? I don't know you. I call my boss " mister" after 7 years, but I walk in here, a stranger and I'm calling you Rick and Sheila like we're in an AA meeting . I don't want to be your buddy, Rick. I just want a little breakfast. You can call me Miss Folsom if you want to. We stopped serving breakfast at 11:30. Have you ever heard the expression, "The customer is always right" ? Well, here I am . The customer. That's not our policy. You have to order something from the lunch menu. I don't want lunch. I want breakfast. Yeah, well, hey, I'm really sorry. Yeah, well, hey, I'm really sorry too! He's got a gun! Let's get organized ! Calm down! Just calm down, everybody. Sit down over there! Mister. Where are you going? No.You sit down there, and you finish your lunch. Everybody just relax and take it easy. Eat your lunch.Please. You all need your vitamins A, B and-- Don't! It was an accident! It's the trigger.It's sensitive. It's okay! It's a sensitive trigger. Could I have my breakfast? Yes, sir.Sheila? Rick? Miss Folsom? You know what? You were right. I've changed my mind . I'm going to have some lunch. Could I have a double Whammyburger with cheese-- -You getting this? -Yes, sir. And an order of Whammy fries and, let's see a Choco-Wham shake. Yes, sir. Sheila, get his order. Rick, could you get it for me, please? I feel comfortable calling you Rick after all we've been through together. How you doing? Enjoying your meal? How about you? Is it good? And you, ma'am? How's the food? I think we have a critic. I don't think she likes the special sauce. That's a joke. Now, here we go. Thank you. See, this is what I'm talking about. Look at that. See what I mean? It's plump, juicy, three inches thick. Look at this sorry, miserable, squashed thing . Can anybody tell me what's wrong with this picture? Anybody? Anybody at all . You guys are partners again! No such luck, Lita. He's moving to Lake Havasu. -What's in Lake Havasu? -London Bridge. -Are you going to England? -They moved it to Arizona. -Stone by stone. -Oh, yeah.I heard about that. You're better off, because cops get killed . -What did we used to get, six? -Seven. Two sevens. You all right? You sure? I'm sorry, I wasn't gonna do this. I should just shut up. It's none of my business. Tell me. Lake Havasu? It's nice.We like it. She likes it. What'll you do, watch cactus grow? Cacti . She's not handling middle age too well . The change of life and all that, whatever it is that is. What about you? Me? It's different, because she's a woman. Different? I'm a woman. But she was once very beautiful . Thanks a lot! You know what I mean. Come on, come on. She could've been anything . Anything but a cop's wife. She's high-strung . Don't give me that queen of the hop, homecoming-queen bullshit again. That was a long time ago. Sandra, you have a career. It's hard to lose your beauty when that's all you've got. What about your career? I'll be okay you know, even without you. Sorry to break this up. -Why are you here? -We got a call . Watch out! Hot plates! -Don't touch my gun. -Fuck you! You'll love this one.Some dickhead went into Whammyburger pulled out a gun when he couldn't get breakfast. Then he paid for it and left. Sorry, Prendergast. He paid for it? Move your buns.Let's go. I gotta go. Where was this? Quintero and Fourth. Bye, ladies. Wait a minute.Wait, wait! Let me know what this guy was wearing, okay? You trying to crack a big one before you disappear into the desert? Sandra, find out if he's wearing a white shirt and tie. Let's go, lovebirds. -I gotta go. -Wait. Something about my wife. Maybe I never mentioned it. What? I love her. Let's go! For seven years, I banked here. When I asked them for a loan, a small loan they told me that I was not "economically viable." Excuse me, sir.Excuse me. How'd your loan work out? Did they give you a loan? He must be economically viable! There's a man with a smiling face. A happy customer. That's what an economically viable person looks like! How much is the...? That is only $3. I asked them for a small loan. You know what they told me? I was not economically viable. That's enough. -I'll buy this. -Yes, sir.That is $3. I'm going away now ! I'm going away, everybody! This is what happens if you're not economically viable! Don't let this happen to you! Bye, everybody! Don't forget me. We're leaving now . You are? Really? It doesn't look like your husband's gonna show . He probably realized he could get into trouble if he harassed you. You should call your lawyer and tell him about it. It's one of those services. I didn't have much money. Have them call your husband's lawyer, make it official . In the meantime, lock up. And if anything else happens, call us. -Okay, thanks. -Sure thing . Excuse me.Hey, excuse me! If you haven't noticed, others are waiting to use the phone. -Others want the phone? -Right, asshole! Jeez, that's too bad, because you know what? I think it's out of order. Hi, it's me. He's eating and resting comfortably now . - Who is? -Mr.Peepers. -Good! -I'm sorry about before. I really blew my top.... That's okay, honey. Could you hold on one second? White shirt and tie. Could you hold on? I gotta go. Just one second . It's very important. Detective Torres! Excuse me. We have about 7 million people waiting to make a statement. Let me call you right back. What's wrong? What are you doing? Nothing's wrong . What do you mean? -l can 't. It's your last day. What are they going to do, fire you? There's a lot of red tape. As soon as I get done, I can go home. I'll call you in a while, okay? Wait a minute.Make a list. - We need boneless chicken skinless.Red peppers not green, red. Honey, hold on one second . I am tying up the phone here. Just listen for once in your life. A girl at the drive-by said a man in a shirt and tie attacked her homeboys with a baseball bat. Somebody's let that dog off the leash. I think you've got last-day-itis. This man was not swinging a bat. He has a gym bag full of guns. A gym bag? You asked me to tell you what he wore.I gotta run. We have to canvas the neighborhood . One more second. Please.It's important. - Why don 't you go to the store? -Why? It's my last day. The guys might want to have a send off or something . What're they gonna do? Get some broad ... dancing on your desk? Course not. Look, while you have been playing cop I'm at home planning your retirement. It's over.The sooner you get that, the better. You are no longer in the law-enforcement business. Now, I will expect you at the usual time.Capito ? Sandra, are you mad at me? -I hate you, but I'm not mad . -You retiring too? Just don't leave without saying goodbye. Goodbye. If you go up against this guy be careful . I'm Nick. What can I do you for? I'm just looking for some hiking boots. Well, well .Hiking boots, huh? Let's see what we got. These are the top of the line. Scientifically engineered and all that crap. Guaranteed by some Sierra Club asshole not to hurt a chipmunk if you step on it. Personally, I think they're for pussies and faggots! Now these are Vietnam jungle boots. Cost half as much, last twice as long and are great for stomping queers! When you're done, you gotta clean out the waffle with a stick but you can't have everything, right? Forget it. Come on, let's go. Have a nice day, fellas! Y'all come back now, you hear? You got a problem, buddy? You got the problem ! -No, you do, buddy! -Read the sign! " I reserve the right." Now take a hike. Make me. Take it easy, Mary. Take it easy. -Jesus! -Come on, make your play. Would you just come on! I don't need this shit today. Fucking redneck! Fascist! Fucking faggots! You believe this shit? Jesus! Alternate lifestyle, my ass! Imagine what those pumpkins do with each other when they're alone! And what about the muff divers? Think about it. Sergeant Prendergast. She don't have to talk! What do you want? I admitted it was a gang ! She don't have to say a word ! I know it was a white guy. We gotta talk.It's important. How many guns were in the gym bag? I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't see no gym bag ! The white guy took it, right? More people could get hurt. Now help me out. The bag was already in the car when I got in. How many guns were in it? I don't know . Lots of guns. They got all the guns in the fucking world . Good? Can I help you? Police officer. I'm looking for a man. Are you now? Late 30s white shirt and tie he'd be carrying a gym bag . What's the police scanner for? My own personal amusement. Seen anyone like I've described? Nope. -Okay, thanks. -Listen. Tell me something . Why don't they call you guys officer-esses? I beg your pardon? You know, like actress? Like that? Something to signify you know . I guess they feel that a police officer is a police officer not a "you know ." Thanks for your cooperation, sir. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, officer-ess. Why'd you do that? There's something I wanna show you. I'm not gonna turn you in. I'm your friend . Come on. I don't bring just anybody back here. This is my own private stash. I got some great stuff here. World War I .Good shape. Speaking of gas, wait a minute. Wait just a minute. You know what was in this? Zyklon-B. You remember? What the Nazis had? Listen. Empty. This was used, man. This was actually used . I wonder how many kikes this little can took out. Think about it.Here. Why are you showing me this? I'm not. That's just for fun. You can keep that. This is what I want to show you. The real thing . Heat-seeking, shoulder-fired . It's fucking disposable! You can take out a jet with one of these monkeys. It's for you. I want you to have it. Why? Because I'm with you. Don't you get it? I listened to the scanner. I heard about Whammyburger. Fucking fantastic! It's a bunch of niggers, right? On TV, it's always white kids. But when you go in there, it's nothing but a bunch of niggers! They'll spit on your food if you're not nice. I know all about it. I'm with you. We're the same, you and me. We're the same.Don't you see? We are not the same. I'm an American. You're a sick asshole. What kind of vigilante are you? I am not a vigilante. I'm just trying to get home for my little girl's birthday. And if everybody will stay out of my way, nobody will get hurt. Fuck you! Who the fuck are you? Are you fucking with me? I am just disagreeing with you! In America, we have freedom of speech, the right to disagree! Fuck you and your freedom ! Who the fuck are you? You fuck! You faggot fuck! Gonna take my rocket. I ought to shoot you, motherfucker! Now turn around ! Now lean on that counter! Go on, lean on it! Look at this shit! What is this doing in there? Faggot shit! You want freedom, huh? I'll give you fucking freedom ! Further back. Feet farther back. Spread them out. Farther. You're going to jail, motherfucker! How's that for freedom? Freedom to get fucked up the ass by some big buck nigger. Give me your hand . He's gonna be right behind you, just like this. Think about it. You gonna like that, faggot? You gonna like that, you faggot fuck? Give me your other hand . -I can't. -Why not? Gravity. Gravity? What the fuck does that mean? I'll fall down. Now give me your other hand ! Give it to me now ! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me. This isn't one of mine. Oh, my God ! Oh, my God ! Good ! Freedom of religion. Now you get the swing of it! Feels good to exercise your rights. I'm listening . We got a nutcase with a bag full of guns. He's in Hollywood, heading west. What is he up to? He's up to a lot of trouble. Never mind, we've got a hallway full of suspects. It wasn't a gang thing . I can tell you that. Angelina is a tramp and a liar. We don't appreciate you interfering with our investigation. I've got a positive I .D. on the gym bag, okay? What's this? A gym bag . Does this mean you're putting me under arrest? You guys take off. I gave you that speech earlier because that's regulations. They make me do it. This one's from me. I've never liked you. You know why? You don't curse. I don't trust a man who doesn't curse. Not a "fuck" or a "shit" in all these years.Real men curse. And I don't like a man who's afraid to hit the street. -It's bad for morale. -I'm not afraid . Get back behind that desk where you belong and don't waste any more of my time pretending you're a cop. A man in a white shirt and tie shot up a phone booth near the Whammyburger. -Did you hear me? -I heard you. Right about here, right? How did you know? He got the bag of guns at the drive-by. Then you were right. Excuse me. -What is wrong with you? -Me? I'm a coward, the captain told me. Get out of my way. Hey, look.It is your own fault. You let everybody think that, when it was your wife. She made you get off the street. What happens between me and my wife is nobody's business but mine! Sorry, I've been a bitch all day. She didn't make me quit. I came home late one night and found her sitting in the dark. She thought I'd been killed . She thought I was a ghost. I had to chase her all over the house. -I'm sorry. -Forget it. -Where are you going? -See if I can earn my last day's pay. Let me go with you. I thought you were on duty. What do you say, partner? Fuck them ! Go! Who were you talking to a while ago? You're trying to scare me. Am I succeeding? So you just might as well stop it. out of my own house. And you 're not coming here. But I am .I'm on my way. You can count on that. I'm past the point of no return. Do you know when that is? That's the point in a journey where it's longer to go back to the beginning than it is to continue to the end . It's like.... Remember when those astronauts got in trouble? They were going to the moon and something went wrong . They had to get back to Earth but they had passed the point of no return. So they had to go all the way around the moon to get back... out of contact for hours. Everybody waited to see if a bunch of dead guys in a can would pop out the other side. That's me. On the other side of the moon now out of contact and everybody's just going to have to wait till I pop out. The police are here. Did you know, Beth that in certain South American countries it's still legal to kill your wife if she insults you? They're here right now . I'm looking at one right now . Put him on the phone. -What are we gonna do? -Talk to the Korean guy. Then we just start banging on doors. What is it? Where are you going? I'll be right back. I'm sure the guy will let you use his bathroom . Prendergast, what are you doing? I know who this guy is! Who is he? He had a personalized license plate. What the hell was it? It said, " D-Fens." Defense? D-dash-F-E-N-S. " D-Fens." They said he was on his way home. Go check out his address. Mr.Lee! Defense! Hold it! Back up. You dumb bitch! You cut me off! What's wrong with you! Move back! Out of the way! What are you, a moron? If I wanted to be in a parking lot, I'd buy a ticket, you dumb bitch! You can't come this way. What are you doing? Fixing the street! What does it look like? Two days ago, it was fine. You're saying it fell apart in two days? Well, I guess so. I'm going to Erishin in Hirokoji. It's a collar shop for women. My mother asked me to buy a half-collar. I'm from Takeda in Oita. Now I'm staying with my cousins in Hongo Nishikata. What about you? I'm from Kakegawa, Shizuoka. Mr. Suzuki, I'm coming with you. I'll do my enands tomorrow. Ready? "The water wheel tums "The water flows "We take a rest "but they never stop." Mr. Aihara. Lend me three more yen. No. You still owe me money, Mr. Sakaguchi. Pay me back, then I'll lend it to you. You should draw ads for bars. How much money? Sakaguchi, will you draw it? No, I won't be deceived by Mephistopheles. Lend me only two yen. No. Mr. Suzuki. Thank you so much. Your pay for this month. Thank you. Minus your debt of 2.5 yen. Sakaguchi... see... Don't count on me. He's a freshman, Taki. A student at Fine Arts School. He's Sakaguchi. I live with him. I'm Taki. You drink fast for a novice. Most Kyushu men are strong drinkers. It tastes awful. Yeah... awful... Who do you admire most? Well... You had notes on Beethoven. Do you like him? Yes. Beethoven represents German music. European music after the 18th century is representative of architectural forms of music. He is typical. Architectural forms in music... Can you apply such concepts to music? What do you mean? The method to deal with the subject. Theoretically perfect, yet strong effects are generated. Haydn is skillful but Beethoven is more intense. From the score we can imagine a symphony. They're truly wonderful. What about you? I'm interested in Schumann. I see... Schumann...? I find his life fascinating. He started as a pianist late in life... Like me. He strained and mined his third finger. He was through as a pianist. Then, he focused on composing. Must one study piano from childhood? Yeah. Here they are! Charge it to this table! Suzuki, why don't you buy us drinks? They found us. Waitress, bring us five more. Shut up. You students supported by parents... How can you drink sake! Shut up! What? Idiot! Sakaguchi, sit down, okay... Okay, drink! Mr. Suzuki, must one study piano from childhood? You're still talking about music even here. It's all right. I think so. Yuki Nakano has been with Professor Mason since childhood. He indoctrinated her with Biehl. Prodigy instruction. Here you are. Oh it's here! Pass it to us! Another order? No, we don't need more. Pour the sake. Do it yourself. Let's toast! HEY, keep quiet! What! What's that! You call that music! It's nonsense. What! Mr. Suzuki, stop it! Mr. Suzuki! Please stop. Taki, let's get out of here. What about Mr. Sakaguchi? Never mind. They like to fight. Mr. Suzuki, I want to be a pianist. Really? I will be. I've made up my mind. You play Beethoven very well. You've improved so much. I'm proud of you, a former member of the Shiba Choir. It's snowing outside. Let's finish for today. Yes, but I'd like to practice a bit more. Well, then I'll accompany you. Since your father was demoted to Naoiri country chief, he seems depressed. He has trouble with the new governor. He refuses to curry favor. He really isn't the type. Sony you had to wait. I have family obligations as the successor, but I entered music school and disappointed him. Don't worry about it now. Rentaro, you eat less than before. Quite a bit less. I'm wonted. You never finish your rice in the morning. You seem thinner. Have some. It makes dinner more tasty. No... Nothing': wrong with me. It's okay. By the way, your school makes you study so hard from early morning until late at night. Liszt "Consolation No. 3 in Db Major" Hello... Taki. Oh, I fell asleep. Let's go out tonight. Thank you. It wasn't me... She did it. I've taken up your practice time. It's all right. Let's go. Here. Thank you very much. Goodbye. What's wrong? I feel like I'm imitating Seiki Kuroda. Imitating is different than being influenced. But mine's only an imitation. You're too self-critical. That's why you don't progress. Just like Suzuki. You fool. I'm not yours anymore. Who are you with now? Suzuki? I belong to nobody... You still depend on women. You coward. Art can prosper only when there is time and money. Teikoku Bungaku critique says so, but I disagree. It's a fact, of course. If that's true, all of us have time, but no money. What's wrong? We're failed artists. Mr. Taki. You haven't drank at all. Get drunk and forget yourself. I drink, therefore I am. Let's drink! Drink more! Taki, have you ever fallen in love? Have you ever made love? Never. Why not? Suzuki used to frequent the red light district. Hasn't he asked you to go? Misako, stop it. Even musicians are allowed to make love to women. Can you play the piano not knowing? Please stop it. Stop it! Slop! Hot hands... he must have a fever. He became hot being held by you. Taki, you look awful. Are you sure you're not ill? You've lost so much weight. Let's see the doctor. I don't want to. You're too intense. You'll destroy yourself. I realize it. Why are you in such a hurry? Why live long without intensity? I started piano late. I must hurry, or never... Let's go to the hospital... Let's go. Takeda, Oita Prefecture Rentaro is ill. I've warned you. That's why I opposed his going. Iku, Iku, bring a towel for Father. Yes. Father. Oh, thank you. Father... Let's go. He says it's pleura pneumonia. It's almost school break. Get him back. Bad air aggravates his illness. It may be contagious for the children. So, he can't stay here. So terrible for him... Your hometown has a spa. Can't he find a place there? I'll ask. Anyway, take good care of him. He is preoccupied by such things as music. It's made his body weaker. Wear this one. I made it for you. Yes, Mother. This medicine is different. You're recovering. That's why. Also, you only need to see the doctor twice a week, instead of three times... That's good. You're not as pale as you were, too. Of course. I was just a little tired. Father must still be angry. Since I was a child, I've always gone against his wish. But, Rentaro... You've been pursuing what you love. It's all right. I know. I have no complaint. I've brought tea. Fumi, now is most critical for him. Take good care of him. Yes. Fumi, where are my sisters? They're on the river bank. They came to see me. It's sad... I can't play with them because of my illness. Hey... Iku... Tomi! Is the water cold? Wait, I'll give you some sweets. Fumi, please take this to them. Yes. The girl, Fumi, takes good care of you. It's a pity. The matron said that she's all alone. She lost her only sister this spring. Please eat it all tonight. Hmmm... Mail this tomorrow. All this? Must I eat so much? I can't... It's too much. But I've promised. Many who want to can't even eat. To Tokyo? Yes, to my friends. I said I want to return soon. It's bad to hurry. Hurry... I am in a hurry! I must play the piano! Piano? If you don't practice, you'll lose your ability soon. Ah... you haven't seen a piano. No, but I've seen an organ. Really? The school annex near here. I'll ask for you. Bach "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring." This is a vintage organ. It's nice to play. Shall I play something for you? I know nothing difficult... like music. Mr. Rentaro, you study such things at school in Tokyo. Yeah... sort of. After graduation, you'll become a music teacher. A teacher... But rather than a teacher, I want to be a student forever. To study real music, one must go to Europe or Germany. Once I graduate, I want to go abroad to continue studying music. That's my dream. The county chiefs son's illness isn't beriberi. He has a lung disease. Is it true? That's what I heard. Didn't they tell you anything? Be careful. It could be very dangerous. No, I won't get it. It's beriberi. What's wrong with her? Shall I kill you? Thank you for coming. I sent a letter to you. Yeah. I was with Sakaguchi on a sketch trip until two days ago. We were in Okayama. I'm relieved. You've recovered. Your color's much better. And your weight, too. I brought flowers. Where shall I put them? Hi... Nice flowers. Wild pink. Put it on the desk. Yes. This is my best friend, Mr. Suzuki. Fix us something good to eat tonight. Yes. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Let me do that. Many well-dressed girls came to the concert. Yuki Nakano was with Professor Kabei. She was stunning. Yuki's very pretty- Even you think so. How are the others in Tokyo? Kume Yuhi started a singing movement to introduce colloquial and familiar children songs. I hesitated to join, but Kume insisted. Everyone is busy. I'm the only one left in such a place. It's nice. And you've got a cute girl. Cute girl? You mean Fumi. She's devoted to you. Devoted? Must be in love with you. Love? She's just a child. Now my world is music. You never change. The beauty of flowers and her feelings... You never understand... Isn't she devoted? Show her your gratitude. Well... I'll buy her a present. Nobu Koda will return from Europe. A concert will be held in October. I hope you can come back by then. Of course I'll come sooner. Ah... Here comes the cute girl! You forgot your hat. Please wear it. Thank you. You, too, Mr. Suzuki. It feels cool. Thank you, Fumi. Don't walk too much in the sun. Yes, we know. Give her your gift. Right now? Yes, now. Fumi! This is for you. For me... Fumi, let him put it on. No... I can't. It's all right. Why not let him do it? Hey... Taki! Yes. Fumi. It's nice. Isn't it, Taki? Nobu Koda Welcome Concert Schumann Carnival (Opus 9) "March des Davidsbundler contre les Philistine." My aunt, Nobu, the first overseas music student held a welcome concert in October this year. Not having seen Taki for some time, he looked well. Are you ready? A toast! Your Schumann was wonderful. The real thing sounds different. Can you tell? You're teasing... Professor... Toson Shimazaki, the poet. I'm Shimazaki. Thank you for the fabulous music. In appreciation, my latest poem collection, "Wakanashu." Thank you. You're such a gentleman, unlike my brother. "A girl with bangs standing under an apple tree "Conjures up your image with combs in your hair." I know why young girls love it. Me, too.I love it also. Schubert would compose beautiful music. The music for Goethe and Heine's poems is wonderful. Here comes, Rohan! Everyone, Rohan is coming! We've been waiting for you. Here, let's toast! Cheers! You don't come for the concert, but you'll come just to drink. I know little of Western music. Even your brother can't snore. Of course not. That's how you play. Like a cafe dancer. Everyone, you heard what he said... I should go and change. Excuse me. Yuki, help me. Taki, excuse me. I'll get the score. Please. Are you also a music student? Yes. I'm Rentaro Taki. Taki... You look like someone. Baiko, a female role actor. Hasn't anyone told you? I have no idea about actors. He's a great actor. That was a compliment. These crowds bore me. Let's drink. Yes. Borrow Schumann's scores? Just to look. He was so impressed. Impossible! No. He's waiting. Don't forget! Scores are irreplaceable. That's six years of achievement in Europe. I don't want to even show them to you. Absolutely not! Scores are irreplaceable? It's natural for Nobu Koda to think of it that way. That's ready to eat. Mr. Suzuki, isn't your music finished? Show it to me. Soon, in the future. Taki, I'm afraid I lack talent. It's not possible. You have talent. Don't struggle alone. Show me. I may have an idea. Your idea? To my own music. Don't be ridiculous, Taki! Waitress! Oh, both of you are here. Five bottles of sake and three beef pots. We're over there. Join us? Not me. You're unsociable... Let's go! Taki, you go! Come on. Taki, I'll introduce my fiancé. Is it okay? Never mind. He is a proud loner. Yes. Your music must be almost completed. Hmm... I'm editing it. Your standard is high. I expect good results. Everyone, a guest. Oh, Taki. Evening. - Hello. - Please sit. Mr. Taki... Motokichi Azuma my fiancé. - I'm Azuma. - I'm Taki. Taki, you know our singing movement? Yes, from Mr. Suzuki. Will you join? Perhaps four seasons in Japan. Four seasons, what's that? I compose each season's song... A suite. Wow, it's a great idea. Taki, please do it. No good! Why can't I do it! Suzuki! Letter for you. Thank you. I didn't tell you... Your father has palsy. Most of the laborers have left. Tenryu River work doesn't progress. Come back once. Your mother. Return to attend family affairs. Damn! However, most songs are to promote music in school and few are of a higher standard than that. Sony, I'm late. We regret the situation, and our own songs are presented hereby. How does it sound? Our purpose is clear. It's good. The old school will resist time. Depends on our songs. Still, Suzuki is late. Let's play our songs while we wait. Excellent foreword. You're great. Mr. Taki, our songs. Please play them. Sure. Is this yours? Female chorus in two parts. "At the zenith of spring time on the Sumida River, "Passengers on boats are going up and down the river." Wonderful! Isn't it wonderful? "At the zenith of spring time on the Sumida River, "Passengers on boats are going up and down the river. "The oars splash and spread the water "like flower petals. "The scenery is of incomparable beauty." Remarkable, a two-part chorus. So talented. I can never do this. "Have you seen the cherry blossoms "talking to you covered with early morning dew? "Have you seen the green willow tree in the dusk "inviting you and standing its branches like "welcoming hands? "On the long river banks trimmed with golden leaves, "a hazy moon rises when I come. "Every moment is precious. "The scenery is of incomparable beauty." "The Four Seasons Suite" including "Flower," was the first lyrics set to music in Japan. He kept writing, including a minuet, and songs for the piano and children. In a short time, he composed many great songs one after another. Yuki... Sony to bother you. What can I do? Here it is. Schumann's "Carnival". Sony for the other day. My aunt gave me many scores. Mr. Taki. I have many others. If it's okay, come to my home. Is it all right? Please. Here you are. Oh... Thank you. Whose is it? A fugue by Schumann. I'm cunning and mean. My aunt refused the other night. Truly, I was relieved. I wanted to monopolize them... It makes a difference. Especially towards you. Me... Why? "Consolation," by Liszt. You play such difficult pieces better than me. It was the first threat to me. Threat? That's ridiculous. May I play this music? Go ahead. Miss Nobu is back. Welcome back. I thought it was you. Don't stop because I'm back. Continue. Bring my tea in here. Please continue. Yes. Wait! Schumann must have written a comment. Don't ignore the composer's instruction. Also, play with your fingers deeper in the keys. It gives a full, rich sound. Move your fingers deeper. Go ahead. Yes. All of your books and scores are valuable. Hoffman and Campe of Germany is indeed a great publisher. I'll offer you ten yen. A little more please. My father is ill and I need money. Well... how about this? Fumi! Aren't you Fumi? I thought it was you. Who is this man? Do you know Fumi? I'm Suzuki, a student. Can't you prevent her from becoming a concubine? I've already been paid. Don't you pity Fumi? Here you go. Son-y, you spent money. Fumi, go ahead and eat. She's not becoming a prostitute. She'll serve just her master. There's a difference in age, but he's rich and kind. His wife has been ill a long time. It's a good deal for her. Which tram? Night... leaves at six. Fumi, come meet Taki. How is Rentaro? Is he well? Yes, he is well. You want to see him? No... someone like me... Hey! What're you saying to her? We'll be back by six. Fumi, let's go. Hey, you. Hey. Seeing a man from a different class will get her nowhere. Fumi, I can't find him anywhere. It's okay. You've done enough. Someone like me shouldn't meet Rentaro. Please, give him my best regards. Fumi, wait a moment. Fumi, wait here. Taki! Oh, Mr. Suzuki. Someone wants to see you. It's Fumi. Fumi? Well, I'm leaving... She's going to Ojiya, Niigata to become a concubine. Concubine? The six o'clock train from Ueno. We have no time. See her now. But, Mr. Suzuki, what can I do? She wears your comb like a treasure. At least say goodbye. Fumi. Fumi. She's not here. Idiot! She must be nearby. You study music but don't understand women! Look for her! Find her! Yes. Fumi! Fumi! Fumi! Ms. Adachi, where will you teach? Daiichi Women's High School. And you, Chika? I have offers in Tokyo and Kobe. I'm not sure. Choose Kobe. I'll visit. You can't. You'll be overseas. I'll get married soon. Germany? America? It's for the professors and the Ministry of Education to decide. No one knows who's going. If not you, who? Mr. Taki? In June, Meiji 32 (1899)... Alter a long hiatus, the government reactivated its overseas study program. Without choice, Mr. Taki and I were involved in this. Officials realized the importance of music education. It's good for them. After the Nisshin War, the military envied foreign band music and supported it. That's one reason. But, military music and ours have little in common. But a student will be sent abroad again, so their ignorance may be beneficial. Yuki Nakano seems the logical choice. I prefer a male student. Nobu was the first... Next should be Taki. Me? What about me? About who will be sent abroad. It should be Yuki. Who else! You'll be sent abroad. I'll take care of it. What about Mr. Taki? Don't be distracted by other matters. Prepare for German and your farewell concert. Okay, Taki will be the representative student player. A competition between you two. Yuki Nakano Farewell Concert Schumann "Fugue No. 1 in A Major." I can't... Not after Taki. You're weak! To be a professional. It's just the start. It's always a challenge. I can't... Taki's too good. Why? You give up easily. You must love Taki. Then, fight that feeling for fame and love. Now go ahead. Liszt Concert Etude No. 3 in D-flat Major "Unsospiro." Schumann is very sensitive and hard to control. You played it well. But that's not enough. Schumann is full of torment and sorrow. You don't convey that. Really? I wish I understood. But I'm also confused and have sorrow. You are? That's good. But, self pity is not agony. Understand? Mr. Taki, I'm sorry. You'd better go abroad first. I truly think so. I don't agree. Today, you played beautifully. Really? Yes, honestly. But, frankly speaking, while listening to you play I was thinking again that I wanted to go to Germany badly to study music. I became so jealous that you can go to Germany. I feel really bad about it. You should go this year, and I can go next year. Next year isn't guaranteed. Then, I won't go. That's silly! You can't. Today, Professor Nobu pointed out that my music doesn't convey torment and sorrow. I was dismayed. Because it concerned me lately. I'm confused about how to understand music, play the piano and compose. Sony, I became so excited that I talked nonsense. Today is to celebrate your farewell. Then, I can really go? Of course. Yuki, someone must be the forerunner. Otherwise, we'll never reach Western standards. Yuki, do your best. Come next year. I'll wait for you. Yes. I'll be there. Two weeks later, as the second one to be sent abroad, I left for Germany ahead of Mr. Taki. Taki, thanks for your letters. How are you? How's your health? I'm a day laborer now. I won't return to school. I won't see you again. I appreciate your lasting friendship. Do your best. Welcome. Don't stare... It's me. Misako... Please... will you change seats? - Okay. - Thank you. Mr. Taki, you look older. Rice? Right away. I left Tokyo without a word. She appeared here suddenly. I was surprised. She's prettier now. She likes the difficult life here. Maybe she's pretending. Please come back to school. If it's money, then my scores are selling, so I can help a little. No, don't bother. I'm the eldest son... I can't abandon my family. I'm also the eldest. I'm lucky compared to you. Thank you. Taki... his food. He eats quickly. Have some. Misa, we're still hungry. Right away. Mr. Suzuki. Rather than my music, I question my life. Is that so? To love and separate, I haven't experienced anything. I finally started to realize what you said. Yeah... now you understand... Maybe I pretended to be serious. The master is calling you. Yes, I'm coming. I expect great things from you. I'm writing music on this trip. "Moon on the Castle Ruin." Bansui Tsuchii's. "Bloom in the Moonlight." Take care and compose something original. Yes. Sony, no time. Never mind. I'm leaving. Be careful. When I followed him here he cried when he saw me. He cried so much. Isn't it funny? Have more. By March of Meiji 34 (1901), Taki completed songs such as "Bloom in the Moonlight" and "Hakone Hachiri" and acappella including "Araiso." In April, his life-time dream to study in Germany finally came. Rentaro Taki Farewell Concert "The cherry blossom viewing party on the castle tower "where sake cups were passed around, "the petals reflect on the surface. "Stately pine trees grew. "Whither the glory gone... "The same moonbeams always cast shadows "But man's life changes by ebb and flow... "Is the cool moon shadow trying to reflect the past? "Moonlight blooms in midnight on the castle ruin..." To study abroad is a government mission. I'm even prepared to sacrifice my own life. I'll complete the mission and want to return your favor to me. Taki, you should relax more. Yuki, too. Pressure to complete such a mission may overwhelm you. Forget about the government. I have high hopes for you. Yes. Rentaro, please take care of yourself. I'll eat a lot everyday. Please. Your father also worries. Yes. One month to Berlin is long. Oh, Mr. Suzuki. Mr. Suzuki. Mr. Suzuki. Congratulations! You made it to Germany! Yes, finally... How's your family, Mr. Suzuki? Father died and everything is gone. I'm getting married to Misako. Also, I've decided to pursue music as you are. I'm going to teach music at a grade school in Hamamatsu... It's near my home. That's great. I'm glad. Thank you. I'm grateful to you. I owe what I am today to you. Don't be ridiculous! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you... Leipzig Leipzig Imperial Music Academy Relax. Not so much weight on your arm! Try it. Let's see. No tension in your thumb. Elbow also. All must move freely. Use your thumb so. You see. Yes, sir. Try it again. Beethoven "Fourth Movement" from Symphony No. 5 in C Minor I'm adjusting to the food. I've been sent by Japan. I'm studying hard to fulfill all expectations. Please don't worry. Dear Father from Rentaro. Suzuki, I'm overwhelmed by the tradition and culture of Germany which we can never achieve. I feel forlorn by my helplessness. Schumann "Piano Concerto in A Minor" Technique, interpretation and philosophy... All surpass imagination. It may be more than culture and tradition. It's talent... My own talent... Someone like me... Sent to study here. What can I bring back to Japan? However, my mission is to take something back to Japan. I'll find something even if it means my life. Do your best, Taki. Around then, while Taki was staying in Leipzig, I was far away in Berlin. ...I was also suffering... Berlin National Institute of Music Yuki! You must practice! I can't... I don't want to even look at a piano. I've asked the Duchess. Go to the castle. I have no confidence. My fingers are useless. I miss Taki. I want to see him badly. That's all I could think of. Kume wrote to me. She had a baby... a girl. Kume is already a mother. She also wrote about you. After I left, you composed wonderful songs. "Bloom in the Moonlight," "Hakone Hachiri..." But I can't match German art songs. Not true. Everyone sings them now in Japan. Tonight, let's have a good meal. There's a nice restaurant downtown. I heard the Eiswein is good. The Duchess recommended it. Duchess? Why are you here? There's a final competition coming up soon. I'm practicing here. Competition? Beautiful room... It's good for practicing. When is the competition? In four days. Four days? What music? Beethoven's "Appasionata." But I probably won't be there. No? Why? No confidence... I'm afraid of the piano. Afraid? You wouldn't understand how I'm feeling now. You came to play a sonata in the competition and a concerto with full orchestra. That's why you're here. I'm nobody here. If you don't play now, you'll never play again. Is that what you want? It's all right. I don't care about music. I'm ready to forget about it. You're trying to escape. Running away won't help. Let's play- I can't! I knew it! It's not true! You can. No! What's wrong? You were doing fine. No, I wasn't! It's true. Let's continue. Delicious! Now I remember. I haven't eaten for a while. Have some. Shall I peel it? Sour... You should play this sforzando here more forcefully. But, it occurs many times, so it might be too persistent. But occasional persistence is characteristic of Beethoven. Yes... I'm feeling weak lately, so it's better to play it more forcefully. I don't agree with that. What's wrong? Beethoven's instructions. It's crescendo... decrescendo. Yours is flat. That's the climax of this difficult part. Don't ignore it. Then you DWI'-! It's no use for me to play... I got it. Thank you. Yuki, you made it. Taki... I did it! Yes, you did it. Taki, thank you. You helped me to regain my confidence. Me, too. Yuki, I also lost myself in Germany. But, because I struggled with you to play the "Appasionata," I also found myself. You, too, Taki? Is it true? Yes. But it's all right now. Taki, please compose... Write wonderful piano music... Piano music? I'd like to play it. I see. I'll write a song for you. For me? Truly? I promise. I'm happy- Oh, I've found something cute... Just like you and me. Us? Yes. Come in. These. Wait... I need some water. Taki... Taki? Taki. Wait! Where are you going? Come back! Taki! Taki! Come back, please! Why? Tell me why? I never saw Taki again. It was our destiny not to meet again. December, Meiji 34 (1901) hospitalized at the Leipzig University Hospital Next, we'll discuss the status of Rentaro Taki who is currently studying in Germany. The Ministry of Education recently informed us his health has deteriorated, and we accept his request to leave school and return to Japan. Sir... Affidavit... Akataro Shimazaki... We bestow this mission of being the fourth student to be sent abroad to study music by the Ministry. To Germany... To study piano and composition. March 10 Meiji 35 (1902)... Dairo Kikuchi, Minister of Education... Shimazaki is thirty-two. His dedication has finally been recognized. He must be very pleased. Let's have a fine party for him. Yuki is doing very well in Germany. It seems so. I heard Vienna is next. A concert in Vienna. Marvelous. Because she's Japanese. In any case, it's great. Yuki is really our best student. Not only in school, but the pride of Japan. Haven't we forgotten Taki? Taki was also talented. Japan and we drove him to the limit. I warned him not to crack under pressure. "The mountains of Hakone are very steep, "much steeper than Hanguguan. "High mountains find deep valleys surround us." Dear Taki, how is your health lately? Today, our school got a piano. I wish you were here to see how happy my students are singing your songs. "The winding mountain roads are slippery "with moss. No one has been here before. "A brave warrior who had been traveling "carrying a big sword marches while striding "over huge rocks. That's how warriors once were." Rentaro is... Rentaro. What's this? Father, I want to return to Tokyo. I must finish something there. But your health? You're sick, so no one will associate with you. You'd better recover first. Father... Mother... I can't stand being idle in Takeda. If I stay here, it means my time in Germany was wasted. People will quickly forget me. Regardless of my health, I must go again. I want people to know I exist. Forgive me. Absolutely not! Mother... Rentaro, I beg you. Don't go. Rentaro, you'll encounter hardship in Tokyo. You'll be miserable. Are you prepared? Yes. Please. Don't stop him. You should go to Tokyo. Hey! Stu? - Slop! Young man, do you need a doctor? It's okay. Take me to the port. I must go to Tokyo. This is terrible. You must see a doctor. Let's go. Yuki... It's rehearsal time. Please, send this letter. Rentaro Taki. who's that? I want to return to Japan. Alter the concert season. That's too late. My beloved is very sick. Let me go back. Yuki, compose yourself. Tchaikovsky "Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-Flat Minor" "Dear Taki, when I recall our sudden parting that day "it causes me great sorrow. "Why did you leave me alone? "I was distraught trying to understand. "Later, I was surprised to discover you were sick "and returned to Japan. "Now I know it was your kind consideration of me. "Taki, please regain your health quickly. "After this season, I'll return to Japan immediately "to meet you. Then we'll come back to Europe. "And finally be happy together." Your room is ready at the inn. You can use the school annex organ. Father got approval. Yes. You're so thin... Mother... Don't cry. I'm leaving. Father, thank you for your help with the organ. Now we're leaving. Rentaro isn't ours, after all. He belongs to music. That's how you feel. No. Rentaro is ours, after all. Chopin "Piano Concerto No. 1 in E Minor" You were wonderful. This is a parcel for you. Yoshihiro Taki...? Last June 29, my son Rentaro passed away. Just before Rentaro died, he asked me to send you the enclosed item. "By the time you read this, I'll no longer be alive. "I wanted to return to Germany to study "music with you. Here is the music "I promised to write for you. "It's incomplete, but I'm sending it. "The truth is, I wanted to complete it and "wanted to hear you play it." June 29 Meiji 36 (1903) Rentaro Taki passed away at the age of twenty-three years and ten months. THE END "Here we are, born to be kings" "We're the princes of the universe" "I am immortal" "I have inside me blood of kings" "I have no rival, no man can be my equal" "Take me to the future of the world" HIGHLANDER 1x19 "AVENGING ANGEL" Subtitles subXpacio JACQUES MOLAY THE LAST GRAND MASTER OF TEMPLARS Help me, Father! Help me! I'm fighting them. I'm fighting. Protect me from the fires of hell. I've tried so hard to please you. What do you want from me! ? Here's to my Dad. I hope the sanctimonious bastard rots in hell. - You haven't had anyone like me before. - Oh, you'd be surprised what I've had. - You know I'm a genuine war hero. - Yeah, you're a real killer, I can tell. You've ever heard of the S.A.S. Commandos? The Falklands, Iraq... I was there. Came out without a scratch. How exciting. You don't look very excited. Oh, look, you're my third war hero of the week. - Come on. Let's go to my room. - You saying I made it up? No, baby. I like men with imagination. Come on. - You're calling me a liar, bitch! - Is there a problem, now, my friend? - Mind your own business. - I am. She works for me. Then tell her to shut her lying mouth! And now we gonna see about correcting your nasty attitude, huh? - It's a miracle! - That's what we all say. The first time. - We? Who the hell are you? - Someone like you. I know you. You're the Angel Gabriel. I'm Duncan MacLeod. - Thy will be done. - You don't understand... You were right, Dad! You were right all along! Wait! I have seen the coming of the angel of the Lord! Wait! - So he didn't know he's an Immortal? - He does now. - Does he know the rules? - No, I tried talking to him. - But he thought I was an angel. - I know better. I've been trying to get in touch with an old friend. I keep leaving messages on the machine, but she doesn't call me back. - Hello? This... - Hello. - Elaine? - Yeah? - I've been calling in for days. It's Tessa. - Tessa? Yes, it's me. How are you? - God, I'm good. - When can I see you? - Oh, Tessa, this is a really bad time. - Come on, you can't be that busy. - Ok. How about tomorrow? - Wonderful. Where? - In my apartment, in Marat. - Ok. I'm looking forward to it. - Yeah, me too. - And there's someone I'd like you to meet. - Is he cute? - No, he is ugly, short and poor. - Oh, perfect. - Good bye Elaine. See you real soon. - Ok. Bye. I haven't seen Elaine since we were teenagers. She's an interior decorator right here in Paris. Yeah, and I'm the ugly, short and poor one? Elaine was beautiful and bright. I don't want her getting any ideas. What are you doing? I took out his wallet and glanced through ¡t. Got his name and some information. So, you've been hacking on the computer again. Yeah, well It's either that or fill out twenty forms and wait six months. - Alfred Cahill. English? - Yes. As a matter of fact he was honorably discharged from the Royal Air Force, according to the card he carried. Interesting. Access denied. Classified. Yeah, which may mean he was a member of an elite organization. There was a code on the discharge card. Let's see if I can find out what it means. Discharged, failed psychological screening. - Which means he's crazy, right? - It's a possibility. Finding out you're immortal must be quite a shock to the mind. You've no idea. But what will it do to someone who's already insane? - I'll be right back, Jean Paul. - I'm just waiting. You're damm lucky. The guy just disappeared. Maybe he fell in the Seine. Maybe you didn't stick him as hard as you thought. Anyway, chalk it up to your guardian angel. - Listen, Jean Paul has outside with the car. - I don't feel much Munir was dead too. And after everything you asked me about what Zafar drank, I was scared it was dad who poisoned him. Did you see him put anything in the tea you gave Zafar? No. But he was there when I made up the flask. Your dad's strict, but you really think he'd do something like that? Zafar's bruises. It was Dad's friends from the lodge that beat him up. He told them to do it after he caught us together. Why didn't you tell us this sooner? Because I thought you were one of them, in the police. I didn't think he'd actually kill him. But now... ..I'm scared of what he'll do to me. Well, why would he hurt you? It's over. You're pregnant. That's why you were sick at the cricket. If Dad finds out, he'll make me get rid of it. He has more 'friends' at the hospital. And these? Who sent them to you? They're not from me. You know my scrawl, it's barely legible. Look. It's not the same. So who? Give him two drops of this, twice a day, plenty of walks and no more beer. The medicine you gave to Dickens, what is it? Antimony. It's a bit old-fashioned, but it flushes out the system. - Similar to arsenic? - Yes. Could that have made us all ill at the cricket? - Possibly. - And killed Zafar? In a large enough dose. It's done nothing for Dickens. No odour. - It should be bitter. - Someone must've stolen the medicine from your bag to poison the beer. Who can access your supply? In the surgery, only Annie and me. And the last time I took it out of my bag was when I went to your house to treat your dog. Your father let me in. And we know Geoff wanted to get rid of Zafar. - Drink it! - Ugh! - Drink it! - Get off him. I'm trying to help him! - Mr Towler? - You... I was trying to help him. I came to apologise for my behaviour last night. Whatever my suspicions, I should've left it to you. I rang the bell but nobody answered. I could hear struggling inside. Drink it! Drink it! He was clutching his stomach like my brother. I tried to make him sick with saltwater. And everything else is as you found it? Uh-huh. - What is it? - A suicide note. It says Geoff poisoned Zafar and he couldn't live with himself. It's the same writing that was on the presents for Annie. So what? He was trying to get Annie and Neil together and that's why he killed Zafar? It fits. Poisoner poisons himself. "I cannot live another minute with what I did, "any more than I could bear Annie wasting her life with a boy she never truly loved. True love is a man strong... and kind." _ This isn't Geoff. This reads like a bad romance novel. Neil? ! Annie? ! Rosie Towler, I'm arresting you for the murder of Zafar Ali and the attempted murder of Geoff Towler. Mum? I don't know what you're talking about. You sent your own daughter round to kill the man she loved. You've made a mistake. I... I need to get home to cook. You're not going home unless you can refute the allegations made against you. We know you wrote this. Just like you sent these. No, Neil sent those to Annie. - Mrs Towler. - Rosie, we know it's a fantasy. We all have them because real life is hard. It's like those books you escape into, when you're feeling unhappy at home. I've got a beautiful home, a daughter. My husband's a pillar of the community. And Neil would make a perfect addition. Yes! He's a lovely man. Dashing. And... and he's a vet. Annie loves animals. But she doesn't love him. She'll come around. Even now? With the baby? Where does that fit in with your fantasy? It was that Indian's fault. He tricked my Annie. Zafar loved her, she loved him. They were going to get married. - Over my dead body. - That's why you killed Zafar. - No! - You poisoned everyone at the cricket to make it look like an accident. Then you gave Annie poisoned tea to take to him. He shouldn't have been here in the first place! He didn't fit. He... He didn't belong. Not like us, not like we do. And where do you belong Rosie? At home, with Geoff? Yes. That why you tried to kill him too? Because we were getting close - and you needed a scapegoat. - No. - Or because you hate him and can't bear another minute with him? - No! - He bullies you. He belittles you. - Shut up! You don't want Annie to end up like that, - married to the wrong man. - She deserves better! So instead you had her kill the man she loves, without her even knowing. And now she's all alone because of you. This isn't how it's supposed to end. Annie is supposed to be with Neil. I... I should be at home. This isn't where I belong, is it? Look at me. Ohh... There's the world as it is... and the world as we would like it to be. Zafar Ali was that rare thing. Someone who lived the life they wanted to live. He didn't pray as he was supposed to pray. He loved someone... he wasn't supposed to love. He held firm when others told him to walk. The problem is, we don't all want the same thing. One man's happiness... is another man's sorrow. Zafar was killed because he didn't fit into somebody else's world. I'd like to say we should all be more like Zafar. The truth is... ..the world won't let us. Oh, hello. - I wasn't expecting you. - I'm not coming in. I'm glad you're here. I was going to pop over. I'm sorry I've been so... busy. - It's just been the case, Zafar's memorial service... - I know. - Drink? - Yes, please. - Look, there's something... - I don't know how to say this. - Can I go first? - No, I've been rehearsing this and I'm scared it'll go out of my head. Amanda, this is going to be hard enough as it is. We can't do this any more. I'm still leaving him, it just can't be for you. It's... it's too difficult. - I know. - You know? How it looks. What it means. - It shouldn't matter, but... - But it... does. We even agree on this. Ah! ~ - Bacon roti. - Thank you. Seriously? You've haven't lived, seriously. Brown sauce? You got some! I could kiss you. - You've tried this? - Yes. Quite foul. Ah! Oh. Just, erm... Marcus? Hi. Sorry? So all I have to do is sign it? If you're still OK to sell the place? I mean, we can talk about it if you like. But it's an offer at the asking price and they want to move as soon as possible. No. No, no. Sure. I mean, it's fine. It's what we agreed on. What time is it over there? Oh, it's t'middle of the bloody night. Another false alarm. Couldn't sleep. So... how are you? Good. Really good. Listen, if this goes wrong, the hospital is over there. OK? You are joking? Oh, she didn't? I told you, your mum is clinically insane. You remember that time we went over and she answered the door stark naked? Right. Yeah, that's her story. - Oh, shit. I've gotta go. - Dr Walker, we're needed. - A nun has collapsed. - I've got to go. - Dr Walker? - Yeah, just send it. Did you just say a nun has collapsed? Exactly. You look terrible. I feel terrible. No, no, no. No time for that. Come on. Get up! - OK. - Come on! Leave that! OK, Dad, what are you doing? Time to smarten you up. - You look like a damn tramp. - Look... Is this him? Yes. Handsome enough, I suppose. With work. What's with these rags? Clothes maketh the man, Dr Nair. I... I know. I've tried, Miss Pradeep, - but the boy just won't listen. - OK. Can I just say... Ssh! They never do. If only you'd taken after your father. Clearly a man who knows how to dress. Oh, you are too kind, Miss Pradeep. - Will you to take him on? - Ordinarily, no, I would not. My client list is exclusive. They expect the very best. I understand. But, erm, then, I do like a challenge. Marrying off this boy will be my... - ultimate achievement. - Really? Yes. Your son is, er... my Everest. Oh, I'm sorry. - There's a call from Chennai. - Sure. - Excuse me. Hello? - Are you crazy? I don't need a marriage broker. - Are you married? - No, but... My point precisely. My son is in need of female company. This way, we can get somebody who's appropriate. "Appropriate"? You mean "brown", right? I mean a girl who's... who's a serious proposition. That's all I ask. Only, if your mother were here, - she'd have wanted this too. - I'm not listening to this. - Oh, AJ. AJ! - Ooh. Crab racing? Imagine the Grand National, only sideways. And you bet on this nonsense? No. Not at all. Gambling's strictly illegal in India. Which is why Greg McConnell's Annual Crab National is incredibly popular. Places strictly limited. So, are you in? Go on, then. When in Rome... A thousand rupees. - Do you want to see the form? - Bloody crabs have form? I get the impression you're not taking this entirely seriously. - Just put it on the favourite. - Oh... - Each way. - Very wise. Incoming. - Hiya. - Hi. You're unnaturally quiet, Dr Walker. Usually, I can't shut you up. Something bothering you? It's fine. Not important. Why don't you let me be the judge of that? Well? We're selling my house. Our house. Which I suppose means it really is over. Me and Marcus. God put those eyes in the front of your head for a reason, Dr Walker. Look forward in life. Turn the next corner and meet the future head on. I know, I know. We met when I was 16. He was the first boy I ever kissed. And you stayed with him? How lacking in imagination you must have been. - I think I was in love. - Impossible. You were only children. The whole thing sounds like a dreadful mistake. Take my advice. A man you don't love is like a sticking plaster you don't need. Just rip it off. It only ever hurts for a second. - You're probably right. - No "probably" about it. Haven't you realised by now I'm always right? It's a cross I have to bear. You love trains. I prefer sitting down with a light ale. You're not well and I hate bloody temples. Tough. We're going. It'll be a cultural experience. I refer you to my previous answer. And you'll have to change. You can't meet God in a Villa shirt. So the nuns make wedding dresses? It's a tradition that stretches back donkey's years. Young brides travel for days to collect their trousseaus. It's a form of devotion. Exalting God through labour. Some people pray. Here they sew and stitch wedding gowns for Jesus. - Sounds amazing. - Or ridiculous. Remind me to lend you my copy of The Female Eunuch, Dr Walker. - Hello. - Still, she looks happy. Didn't we all? Thank you for coming so quickly. Had she complained of feeling unwell? Sister Inez has taken a vow of silence, Dr Fonseca. I wouldn't expect her to. In this order, we take discipline very seriously. And here? Sickness, fever? How about when you pee? Mutra. You may speak to the doctor. It hurts. Well, I think you'll live, but you should've called me earlier. It's probably a urinary tract infection coupled with a faint. We're going to need a sample. So this will tell us if you have an infection. We can check for blood, protein, white blood cells. Of which you have a full house. Congratulations. So what happens now? We need to start you on a course of antibiotics. We need to make sure you drink plenty of... Is everything all right? The tests we've taken indicate that you do indeed have a urinary tract infection... .. but also that you're pregnant. Did you really need me to wear this shirt? Traps the heat like nobody's business. Now I know why Gandhi wore a bed sheet. You look good in black. Everyone does. OK. OK. Why are all the blokes wearing flowers round their necks? It's traditional. It says so in the guidebook. You should be wearing one, too. Excuse me. Here. Oh, stop fussing. Come on. It's this way. You do understand what this means? Of course. This baby is a gift. A true miracle. So, do you have any idea who gave you this gift? Isn't it obvious? It's Him. You believe her? That she has an immaculate conception? I may be an extremely lapsed Catholic, but I'm not totally stupid. No, some miracles are more easily explained than others. OK. Lift your right arm, please. And now your left. - Believe me, I'm trying. - You see? I'm afraid it looks like you've suffered a stroke. That's why you can't move your left side. Now, when did this all start? - Less than an hour ago. - Uh-huh. This place was the nearest. So what happens now? I'll prescribe some treatment to thin the blood and then you'll need a scan, which I can arrange. In the meantime, we'll do everything that we can. OK? - Thank you. - OK. My husband, he'll get better? Er... I'm afraid that, at this stage, that is impossible to say. We want the best treatment. We have funds. And Dr Nair is a personal friend of my husband. Yes, er, all our patients get the very best we can offer. I'll make sure that Dr Nair is aware your husband is here and he can arrange any transfer if that's what you'd prefer. Thank you. "We have funds", hm? The girl had nothing before she married him. You don't approve, Sister? In sickness and in health, Doctor. Perhaps now we'll see how true that is. Hm? I am pleased her condition is not serious, but I'm very much against my novices leaving the convent unless there's a genuine emergency. Now, is this ultrasound scan really necessary? Absolutely essential. I've arranged for an appointment first thing tomorrow and, given the circumstances, I wish to take care of this case personally. In that case, I will make an exception. What's going to happen to her once Mother Carmen - finds out she's pregnant? - God knows, but she's gonna need help to deal with this. So how long were you married? Whoa! What brought that on? Sorry. If you don't wanna talk about it... One confession deserves another, I suppose. Jules Fonseca was... an entertaining man. Impossible, but entertaining, right up to the day he left. - But you still kept his name? - If you had my maiden name... - What was it? - I have never told anyone - and never will. - So what happened? I woke up one morning and he'd gone. Haven't heard from him since. Wow! - That must've been hard. - Yeah, well, life goes on. Just rip it off and it only hurts for a second. And the sex was fantastic. So, Josie, what first attracted you to this exciting, public facing retail employment opportunity? Sorry? - Why do you wanna work here? - Truthfully? - Always. - I really don't, but it's my fastest route to a plane ticket out of here so... I see. In that case, you're hired. Really? Mm. Amazing. Miraculous. You were the only applicant. So when can you start? - As soon as you need me. - Good answer. Can you tell me what this is? - A dishcloth. - You're a natural. Come on. You gave her a job? She was by far the best candidate. OK, what about them? - She's gonna be so jealous... - They run out of money, Daddy FedEx's a new credit card. Her desperation is my profit margin. Oh, that's it. I'm gonna kill myself. Fine. Just not here. Suicide's bad for business. No. It's worse than that. My father hired a marriage broker. Is that so bad? Means a lot less effort on your part. So you would have an arranged marriage? I met a girl once. Clever, pretty, sweet. For some reason, she liked me. Wanted to get hitched, kids, the whole deal. OK. So what did you do? I bought a one-way ticket to India. I just think you should consider the alternatives before it's too late. Hari Menon. I went to school with him. He was in my class. What's wrong with him? - Stroke. Left hemi. - Oh. I've started anti-platelet therapy. So is he a close friend of yours? I haven't seen him in years. I heard he remarried, a younger woman. Yes, very attractive. - Mari doesn't approve. - Ha! Hari never cared about what other people thought of him. Probably that's how he got so rich. Mr Menon, how are you? Is this it? No. How much further is it? Oh, about eight to 12 kilometres depending on... 12 kilometres? That's nearly... That's bloody miles. If you can't handle a small hike, you're welcome to stay here. Us ladies will pick you up when we're done. What is it, child? I have good news, Mother... Well? And she just threw you out? I was... I was so happy, so proud. Couldn't keep it in any more. I thought Mother Carmen, a woman of God, would understand. She called me things. Dreadful things. Said I'd brought shame on the order. Well, did you? A handsome young man can make the best of us lapse. No. Of course not. I swear by Almighty God, Dr Fonseca, I have done nothing. Nothing. In that case, I think we'd better find out what's going on here, don't you? (Yes.) Push a little harder. That's good. Now rotate it. Like this. There. You see it? Not really. Sorry, I just can't visualise a foetus. I'd hope so too. The uterus is there. Empty. This is what you should be looking at. - What is it, Doctor? - You have a cyst on your ovary. A dermoid, if I'm not mistaken, which explains everything. You're not pregnant. You have a benign growth on your ovary. Inside is tissue that has developed like a foetus would have done, which is why your pregnancy test was positive. So, it was all a mistake? There's no baby? No, and there never was. You will have to have the cyst removed, but it's a relatively simple procedure. You'll make a full recovery. Thank you. - I'm sorry. - You do understand. We can treat this. It's not that. When I thought I'd been chosen, when I thought it was a miracle, it made me so happy. I hadn't been sure, you see. I'd had doubts, bad thoughts. Then this. It was as if God was speaking to me. Telling me He was real and that I was His servant. But this? This is an abomination. It's not real. None of it is. It's all been a lie. I want the operation, please. I need it out of me as soon as possible. And I'd like to borrow some clothes. Put her in a bed and call the gynaecologists in Kochi. Arrange for an appointment as soon as possible. - Where are you going? - To commit a mortal sin. Dr Fonseca! You will not use language like that in a house of God. God? And what do you think He would say about the way you've treated this girl? Mercy and forgiveness? Rules must be obeyed. If a genuine mistake has been made, the girl can return to the convent any time she likes. God is nothing if not merciful. And what ever happened to trust? Trust comes with discipline. Oh, yes, discipline. I spent ten years being taught by women like you. Believe me, those scars don't heal so easily. Look where it got you, Dr Fonseca. A glittering career. Sometimes a little discipline can work wonders for the rebellious. Yes, yes. All right. Right, that's it. I'm done. Sorry. - Sorry. - Oh, it's not much further. I'm knackered. My feet are blistered. The bloody mosquitoes think my ankles are their personal World Darts Championship. I swear, it's like Lakeside down there. But this temple, Paul, you'll really love it, I swear. Seen one temple, you've seen 'em all. I'm done. No. We're not going back. We can't. I need to... You need to what? You need to what, Maggie? Tonight, a star appears in the woods above the temple. The Arundhati star. It always appears, always, and it's... Well, they say it's got these healing powers. And it's... I thought I should at least try to see it. What? Christ! A bloody healing star! Jesus, Maggie. Our daughter has been calling us every day and I've been lying to her, telling her everything is fine. - Stop shouting, Paul. - You think this is shouting? This is nothing. I hate it here! I hate the heat, the flies! The money doesn't make any sense at all. I've stuck it out because... - God knows why we're doing it. - Paul... Now you are literally leading me up the bloody garden path because you think some poxy speck of light billions of miles away is gonna fix everything, when we could be back home surrounded by people who love you. Why this? Why...? Why here? We've got a life, family, friends, back home in bloody Stourbridge where it's cold and miserable and you can get proper Nando's. I miss those things, Maggie. And you should miss them too, if you weren't so bloody self-obsessed and selfish. Maggie! Help! Somebody help me! Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! Come on. Excuse me. Move it! I don't think we can get up here. Come on. Come on. Come on. AJ, come on. Come on. Excuse me. Excuse me, guys. Easy, love. Easy. You have to sip it. Not too much at a time. Oh, thank God. Over here! She's severely dehydrated. What are you doing hauling her out to the middle of nowhere? No. No. She was fine. She was the one who wanted to do it. It's the Aru... doodah star, or something. Yes, I know what it is. We need to get her to the hospital now. - Where's the bloody ambulance? - Next corner. Thank God for that. Nearly there, love. Oh! Sorry, memsahib. Hey. Are you OK? Yesterday I would have prayed with them. I'm sure they'd be grateful if you joined them. To ask God for a miracle? Well, if it gives people hope... Yesterday I trusted Him and then I find all He wants to do is make a fool of me. No-one thinks that. I do. Come on. Good afternoon. Here you go. Blimey! - Has it been a year already? - Yeah. - You know I always win? - Yes. Your recurrent good fortune astounds me. No-one picks a crab like Lydia Fonseca. I had considered banning you, but that didn't seem sporting. OK. That one. 5,000 rupees. Crazy Claude at fifty to one. Bold choice. What would you do if you saw a young girl ruining her life? I usually tell 'em not to stop and promise 'em a lift home. If it was me, absolutely nothing. If it's you we're talking about, I'd bet 50,000 rupees that you're gonna stick your nose in. Talking of which... Help yourself. Tell me you are not serious. I warned her of the risks, that we could only offer the basics, - but she insisted on staying. - You listened to her, Dr Varma? Yes. She's my patient. She has a right to make her own decisions. What about this nonsense about some healing star in the East? That part of your prescription too, was it? If she had told me, I would've stopped it. I knew nothing about this. It seems ignorance is your default setting. - Continue fluid resuscitation. - I will. If she doesn't recover quickly, we'll need a transfer to Kochi for a CT scan. Check her intracerebral pressure's OK. - Do the family know? - That's her husband over there. Well, you should put him in the picture. And it's not a pretty one. Yes, Dr Walker? Dr Walker is concerned about you. She thinks we need to talk. Or maybe you just need to listen. You thought that God had given you a virgin birth. A gift. But, in reality, biology gave you a better one. The truth. I've seen what this life can do. Death coming to those who least deserve it. Illness and misery striking down the purest of heart. If He exists at all, then He's a cruel tyrant. Why shut yourself away from humanity? See it with your own eyes. There's a whole world out there waiting for you. Now I have nowhere to go. Is that so bad? If we explained the diagnosis, the convent would have her back? - Oh, they'll have her back. - I don't understand. I went to see her so-called Mother Superior. She's welcome to return. You don't think we should tell her? She's young, Dr Walker. She has a chance to start again. - She's lost. Vulnerable. - Aren't we all? The sooner she learns to deal with it, the better. Lydia's Lydia. She manipulates people and refuses to apologise. I thought you would have figured that out by now. And we just accept it? Well, I don't think any of us have a choice. We could leave. That's true. So, why don't you? No, really. I'm interested. Why are you here? Why not Chennai or... or Delhi? I mean, you're a brilliant doctor. Maybe it's all I deserve. Now, Maggie Smart nearly died today. All because I let her do what she wanted. No. No, you listened. You tried to help. And it nearly killed her. You know, maybe Lydia's right. People need to be told what's good for them. I mean, that's why I always tell you what to do, because obviously I know what's good for you. Marcus is selling up. That's what the phone call was about. We were supposed to spend the rest of our lives together. Now that's a failure. I'm... I'm sorry to hear that. I should... I should get back. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yes. I'll... Sister! Sister! Come quick! Quick! You see. See? It's a miracle. He's cured. Isn't it wonderful? - Praise the Lord! - Praise Him indeed. I'll tell the doctor. They should tattoo it on our arms at medical school. Never give up on a stroke on the first day. One man's transient ischaemic attack is another man's miracle. Perhaps we should go and explain. No. We all need a little magic now and again. Some more than others. Yeah. Go on, do it today. You never know what tomorrow might bring. Excuse me. Give me five. My sincerest apologies, Miss Pradeep. The boy flatly refuses to cooperate. Our children are a gift, Dr Nair, but a gift that has been sent to try us. Ah. Of course, eligible men come in all shapes and sizes... and ages. Are you married? - Widowed. - Even better. I have many lovely ladies who'd like nothing better than a charming doctor with a little sadness behind his eyes. Unless the whole idea is completely out of the question? There's no harm in discussing it. I'll be in touch. On your marks... .. get set, scuttle! They're off at Greg McConnell's Annual Crab National. Not much going on at the beginning. They'll warm up. A bit of liveliness happening over here now. - Go! Go! - Who's this? Great form. Someone's making a break for the border here. It's the Hooded Claw making a break for the border. No. No, it's actually... It's No.3. No.3 making... Hi. Wow! Miss Pradeep, I was not expecting you. No, I mean... You look wonderful. Thank you. If your son was half the gentleman you are, every woman in India would be offering her hand. And, please, call me Mala. Mala. Look at her! He's making a total fool out of himself. Is he? Are you sure it isn't you? Oh, my God. That's it! Go! We have a winner. We have a winner. And it's Legs Co, ladies and gentlemen. Legs Co, our favourite. Who had Legs Co? Who had the favourite? It was Paul. Where's Paul? You were right. Hm? I shouldn't have taken us up there. Hey. It doesn't matter now. That's exactly why it matters. Stupid waste of a precious day. No day's wasted if I'm with you, love. Here. Home. Hot trains. Hospital. Sorry I shouted. It's OK. We need to call Debbie, love. Let me call her. We have to tell her exactly what's going on. You're sick, love, and she's our daughter. She deserves the truth. You can't sleep here. God! Shit! Help! Help, Gabriel! I need help here! We need to get her up now! - OK. I'm in. - What's going on? Female, 20s, attempted suicide. Deep lacerations to both wrists. Severe hypovolemic shock. - Sinus rhythm? - Fine, 88. - Blood pressure? - Better, 80 systolic. Chase up the cross match. Two more units of red cells. I'll call Kochi and arrange an urgent transfer. Wait! She tried to kill herself. - A heartbeat from succeeding. - I'm fully aware of that. She was down for five, ten minutes. Maybe more. We both know what that means. This should never have happened. She needed help. - Our help. - Which I gave her. No. No, you just told her how to live her life. I simply did what I thought was right. I know. You always do. This time you were wrong. Is that all? You won. The whole pot. How much? I think, technically, you're a millionaire. I'm sorry you couldn't make it. How is she? Better. Considering. In the circumstances, the bar decided to come to you. I won't make a habit of it. - Cheers. - Cheers. Thank you. Lydia? Hey... Hi. - When we first, you know, walked into the country, I mean, you had the weight of the nation on your shoulders. You know, we were America's response To the most catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S Soil. - Ever. - Ever. - And for a lot of us, You know, we felt that we had a responsibility To the people that died, To set the stage that you just don't do that to America And not pay the price. It was about... not retribution, But it was about justice. - What's that saying About, "who will go?" "send me." - You know... - Isaiah 6:8. - Sir? - Isaiah 6:8. "Whom will go, and whom shall I send?" - Yeah, "who will go, and who shall I send?" Send me, send me, 'cause I'm the dude that wants to make somebody pay For killing my brothers and sisters. - I think we have to assume That there will be more attacks. - The United States military has begun strikes. - Coalition warplanes have free rein over Afghanistan. - The public, though... - I think 94% of the public... Wants us to go in somewhere and do something. - U.S. Army Special Forces, known as the Green Berets... - The green berets... - Inside Afghanistan. Those reports first appeared in Pakistani newspapers... - Known as the quiet professionals... So secretive, we've agreed not to disclose Even their first name. - I never spoke out the way I felt like I should have. - It was an American green Bert raid in the dark of night. - Guns starting to flail back and forth. pow-pow, pow, pow... - This is another type of warfare: War by guerillas. - Unconventional warfare. - And to me, it's like brotherhood. - What is winning? - You're just praying You'll get to prove yourself to your brothers. - What began as a 100-day mission... - The longest U.S War... - It's been a long war... - The longest war in American history. - We've been living it for 15 years. - Think I was 10. Must have been 9 or 10, about 1970, I guess. I saw john Wayne, "the green berets," And I thought, "man, yeah..." - They all seemed to think that because my dad joined, That it was natural for me to join, But that wasn't the case. I went to go see a movie. - Funny thing. A fella takes one of these into battle, And he carries a strange sense of guilt All the rest of his life. - I figured everything else I'd done in the Army Hadn't been all that hard, for me. I figured, how hard could it be? It was pretty hard. Pretty good, yeah. - The Taliban must turn over Osama Bin Laden And must destroy the terrorist camps. Otherwise, there will be a consequence. - Spokesman for the Taliban denies Afghanistan Allowed Bin Laden to strike from its territory. - Good afternoon. On my orders, The United States military has begun strikes Against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. - I'm as close to these people as anyone in my own family, And in some ways closer. These are my 11 best friends in the world. That's how I feel. - This is us in Afghanistan. I mean, we were in, you know, some harsh... - Probably is as extreme a combat environment As you can fathom. It tested you in every way... physically, mentally... Emotionally. - We are it. And when you need the Army, We are the vanguard, the spearhead, the praetorian. - This has been happening for, what, 15 years. - Wow, since Vietnam. - Yeah. - We're talking about people. You know, as a unit, we've been... We've been deployed doing some pretty crazy crap For a while. And you get into a unit like this, And that's what you do. That's your game. - I've been in the military now 30 years. That mission was the pinnacle of my career, Absolutely the finest thing A team of green berets could do. - Mark wasn't on the team anymore at that time. So I thought I was good to go. I was 6 1/2 months pregnant. And we got a call while we were in a baby store, Shopping for baby things. I think Mr. Paul called him and said... - "get your butt back here." - "guess what, you're back on the team." And I was like, "oh..." - We both realized I was probably not gonna be there For the birth of our child. On the drive back from Nashville, then, We realized we'd better pick a name. Amy knew we were gonna go, but she didn't know where. Hell, I didn't know where we were going exactly. - Ramp runs down a big cloud Of that fine talcum powder dust. We come piling out of the back of that, Haul all of our shit out in this big, huge clump of stuff. Helicopter takes off. Dust kind of settles, And out of the dust comes the sand people. - That's right. - When you see a man with an AK Who's dressed just like your enemy, And you've got to walk over to him And basically ask him, "hey, how you doing?" And you have no idea whether he's gonna say... You put out his hand and shake it, Or he's gonna shoot you. - The Taliban's Army of some 30,000 fighters... Born from the crucible of war, Captured Kabul in 1996 and imposed draconian laws. - Indiscriminate and brutal... - Whipped in public for adultery In front of an all-male audience... - We have a small group... - The Taliban invited Osama Bin Laden... - Osama Bin Laden would offer money And his fighters to fight. - The northern alliance came together In mutual opposition to the Taliban. - General Dostum and his Advance Security Party Come riding up. - General Dostum, who has a fierce reputation For his treatment of foreign prisoners. - He jumps down off the horse, and... - Hell, the horse is still moving, he jumps off. - Yeah. - He was like, "hey." - General Dostum agreed to take my team members and I Up to his forward command post. "I can't guarantee your safety." He said, "there's some people That may be upset that the Americans are here." So we would mount horses for the first time in combat. - Mark knows horses. He knew horses when he got there. We didn't. Mark figured out real quick That you go up to 400 dudes on a horse and say, "hey, somebody get off their horse And give it to an American," You ain't gonna get a smooth horse. - We got to General Dostum's headquarters. My job at that point Is to establish and maintain rapport. His plan that he had briefed to us Was that Mazar-e Sharif was the key to the country, And if we could liberate Mazar-e Sharif, The northern provinces would be liberated. If we liberated the northern provinces, Then Kabul could be liberated. And from there, Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad. We represented 5th group. We represented America's foreign policy... At the point end, nasty, dirty, bloody end of that fight... That we went in and helped enable The possibility of a brighter future For the people of Afghanistan. - It was my first rodeo. We got married in April; He left in October. He was a medic. I thought it was safe. Yeah, he lied to me, guys. No, he didn't lie to me; He was a medic. - Is that what they're called? - I don't know. You know what it is. - Little dust off that. - A pickle tea. - A lot of memories, you know what I mean? It's like... that you kind of tamp down and put away. Not so good, but that's okay. - Every one of the husbands will tell you That they're gonna die before us spouses do. - Suck it up, buttercup. - Suck it up, will. - Hey, how about we toast to everybody who's not here? - Yeah, there you go. - 'Cause we got chad, we got Pete... - Pete. - We got Steve. - Bill. - Bill, wherever you are. - Wherever he's at. - Salud. - Salud. - Whoo! That shit's nasty. - What is this shit? - Hey. Say hello. Come on. It wasn't until you were forced to retire, You had to retire. Then you isolated yourself from your family And everybody else. You internalize everything. You try to find a new normalcy. - Off. Sit, sit, sit. Psst, sit. What I found kind of peace with Is to go out here, crawl around on jeeps And, you know, be one again. Being out here, I mean, listen. You know, you get to have no thoughts at all. Each one of our stories are almost similar, How we isolated ourselves, our family, everything else. Started reaching out and found, You know, the only way we're all gonna heal each other Is to get back together. - Holy shit. - That's that blooper. - Oh, there we go. Big Marky Mark. - Marky Mark. - I'm up here somewhere. That's me right there. - You know, in special forces, you have a team, And a team is 12 men. You've got a Captain, a team sergeant, A team warrant officer, Two Engineers, two Commo, Two medics, two weapons sergeants. That formulates a team, And each team would have a specialty, Like high-altitude, low-opening jumping Or scuba diving Or assaulting direct action. - I was the greatest tactician For direct action that there was. Back then, I thought I was on top of the world. - In the back. - Right here? - Yes. - General franks, again, on special forces, Can you give us a sense of how the size and scope Of their mission will expand over the next month, From classic liaison with northern alliance groups And reconnaissance, To more direct action, Shoot-em-up ambush type of situations? - A short answer, and that is that... One should not assume that there has not been Strategic reconnaissance and direct action activity. You would not expect for me to tell you Exactly what they're doing. - Evidence that another, much more covert operation Is well under way... - These special forces are trying to hunt down Suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden... - The letter-like attacks by commandos To go after and root out some of that infrastructure. - The mission statement was to kill or capture Senior Al-Qaeda and Taliban leadership, stop. Insert name, stop. Insert location, stop. At our level, there was a big map there, And the big map is synchronized by who's next, Who's on first, okay? And then, who's on first is a number And a picture and a little bit of background. Went into one room, it was total chaos. Seven guys, machine guys, Dodging bullets, shooting people, hand-to-hand. You run into the next room, Guys are shooting out the back of the window. One guy is surrendering. You went into the next room, bam. It was on-off, on-off, on-off, on-off, on... Helicopter home. As a kid, I was forced to read homer's "odyssey," You know, about a warrior king trying to come home And the family going through its situation. You never really understand it, Because you don't have the maturity. Now, you know, you're trying to find, you know, The subtleties and calmness of life. That, right now, is more valuable Than a million dollars in the bank. - As a leader, You have to balance, you know, "what's the mission? What are you trying to accomplish?" And the mission is invariably To put your soldiers in harm's way. So, I think, as a soldier, There's a part of you that, as an individual, You want to see it, to understand it, To be tested by it. But then, as a leader, You're so terrified at the thought Of making bad decisions that get your soldiers killed. - You need a very strong team leader. Amerine was outstanding. - It's like a democracy. You've got to kind of, you know... There's strong wills. 12 strong wills. - You're stuck with this bunch of guys And thrown into Afghanistan. And it was just fun. Yeah, it was awesome. - You know, we identified Tarin Kowt As the first step in our campaigns. The goal was, seize Kandahar. I met Hamid for the first time in the hallway. You know, he was going to the bathroom, And I was walking to get some coffee, And it was just men trying to work with one another That didn't have any time for bullshit. Even as all the tensions rose Between the U.S And Hamid Karzai, He still had an uncanny ability To hold things together over there. I think it was around 3:00 in the morning or so. The F-18s spotted a small convoy of trucks heading north. So here are these F-18s flying overhead, And they're calling for permission to engage. And that was when... that was then the war Really became real. There was just this moment where Alan looks at me And says, you know, "are they clear to engage?" And, like, everybody was suddenly quiet. I mean, I was... I was gonna authorize these F-18s To drop bombs on pickup trucks that were likely the enemy. But, you know, what if I was wrong? And it was the silence that always sticks with me. You know, "are they clear to engage?" And suddenly all eyes are on me. I looked at Allen, and I said, "smoke 'em." And after I said the words, It was just sort of, where did that come from? Smoke 'em? I don't say shit like that. I mean, that's just not me. The thing we didn't realize, though, Is that these trucks weren't the leading edge of the convoy. They were actually at the tail of the convoy Of maybe 1,000 Taliban. - So we're just kind of lookin', you know, with Binos, And we saw this glimmer. - I mean, these guys were coming heavy, And we're talking 23mm guns. A 23mm is, like, that big. I mean, it will... it will blow you, "pah." You'll be like mist. - We tell the pilots, "okay, we're the two truck right there." And the pilots would go like, "that's it." "yep, that's us; Everybody else is the enemy south of us." We were fucked. - And Yoshida assured us, he's like, "man, I'm on tune. "I'm talking to these pilots. We're knocking them out." And he would just keep saying, "cleared hot, cleared hot." Through the whole night, It just kept going further and further and further. And we just, like, bombed out, like 100 vehicles Through the whole night. "Pop-pop-pop." - I mean, I don't know that we were high-fiving and euphoric. It's like, "whew." We were just trying to win... and live. - I think, for me, the notion of fighting from a distance, Of fighting with these airstrikes, It didn't sit well with me. I mean, it... It almost promoted just the promiscuous use Of military power. I don't know how to explain it. It's just... I mean, we would have died otherwise. There was no alternative. But something just didn't feel quite right about it. I mean, in the end, we slaughtered them, you know. And as they were retreating, we kept bombing them. I mean, we wiped them out. But I didn't feel good about how we had to do it. I just felt like... Felt like I should have been looking the enemy in the eye Before I killed him. - We went down, and we started doing battle damage assessment And counting, you know, destroyed vehicles. And, you know, in some of them, There were still some charred bodies That were just... They're traveling in these little Toyota trucks, And you jam as many guys in the back of the truck And as many guys in the front of the truck as you could. So there might be eight or nine people In a Toyota truck, And there was, you know, hundreds of those trucks. - I don't know how to describe it. It was just... It was just what it is, you know? You just... you're, like, initially kind of... I don't want to say shocked, but you're just like, "wow." I mean, you're seeing people That are literally burnt and charred to death. You know, you're like, "ooh, wow." - That was the first of any of that carnage That I had seen, you know, with my own two eyes. It didn't really bother me. It was just kind of gruesome, whatever. But you're the enemy, and so it's okay. And that's kind of how you programmed it. "If I don't do this to you, you're gonna do it to me." And it's really that simple. - One of the things people... - they just... First thing out of their mouth, "how many people you kill?" I didn't know we were counting. I didn't know we were supposed to count. If you know how many people you've killed, It's probably not enough. - It's not a scorecard. - It's not a scorecard. - You know, it's... - And there's a difference Between shooting somebody face-to-face And somebody from a distance dropping a bomb. It's impersonal, you know what I mean? "Ah, got him. Ooh, dust, whoo-hoo, high-five." You know, little bit longer shot, "wow, the mechanics of that shot was great." Face-to-face, I could tell you what they smelled like, You know, how long it took them to bleed. Some guys can't get rid of the smell, okay? Smell of a burning body Is different than the smell of a burning tire. And you never know until you walk by And you're like, "oh, shit," 'cause that smell is now implanted in your brain, What that means. - My beard was covered in blood. I mean, I didn't just see, smell; I tasted. I thought I'd broke my nose, but then I realized, I didn't get hit by anything, and why am I bleeding? And, oh, it wasn't my blood. And I still... I will get that flash smell on occasion, And it'll take me right back. You just... that's... You know, that's the horror of it all. It's very personal. - I grew up with that strong American cowboy, U.S. Cavalry Heritage. I was probably on a horse before I could walk. You know, I'd studied U.S And confederate Cavalry commanders. We had walked the battlefields of Gettysburg And down through the Tennessee campaign. It was not lost on me that here I am, In the 21st century, And I'm leading a 19th century cavalry. - One of the things about the sf guys, Most of them are kind of rough and tumble guys To begin with. - She goes, I expect... - And just slide the bar the other day with that... - There's no weight behind that. - No, put that down first. Put that down. - The way I grew up in west Virginia, It was clan-ish, you know. Certain hollows, all these families lived up this one. All these families live up that one. And, you know, if you make an enemy of one guy here, There's more. - Afghani... - Yeah, understanding how tribal people think Is obviously gonna help. - Every one of these leaders told us, Do not become portrayed as the invaders. You're here as liberators. That's what you've said. Because we were so few guys, We could actually portray That Taliban are actually the foreign invaders, The Pakistani Taliban that had come over, The Al-Qaeda that had taken over And hijacked these people's country. - Straight ahead. - Straight ahead. - That is foreign Taliban. - Foreign Taliban. - Okay, the one to the left... - We've now raised this Army, Who are gonna rise up across the northern provinces, And we're gonna press for Mazar-e Sharif. The situation dictated that we needed to decentralize. Each of these three-man cells, then, Is tasked to support an afghan commander That had between 300 to 750 fighters. Each of those cells is a four- to eight-hour horse ride. It was hot, dusty, dirty, Riding the meanest, rankest, nastiest horse. - I rode Vince's horse that one time. - Rusty? - I was like, "oh, my god, Vince, How are you staying on this thing" - That horse was cross-bred with a werewolf. That thing... - The Americans would get bucked off. The afghans would get bucked off. And everybody would kind of cheer. That was another bonding experience. - Extraordinary defense department photo Released today. United states special forces on horseback. - When was the last time you saw U.S. Military Personnel In combat on horseback? - Haven't had them in combat in a long time. That's a tough mission. - Not till I saw him on TV. - Yeah, that was kind of a giveaway. - Yeah, that was when I got the phone call At 3:00 in the morning. - Well, and 2 and 2 still make 4. It's like, "oh, let's see, where could they be? Afghanistan perhaps?" - Yeah. - Yeah. - We couldn't talk about where we were at Or anything we were about to do. And coming back from a skirmish, then, I get a message: "Something's wrong; Call home." - I had... I had Kaya. And Michelle, bless her heart, She was on the phone, Trying to find a way to get a hold of Mark To let him know that I had delivered our daughter. And... but I didn't hear from him Till we were already discharged and at home Several days later. - Amy went in for an appointment, A normal appointment, And there were some complications, evidently, And the ob specialist Said, "you're having this baby today." And it was over, what, a month early? - Yeah, she said I had two hours to get my affairs in order, And I was not to leave, That I had to stay on the hospital grounds. So I called... - She called these wasps. - These ladies. - And they came. And from what I understand, Every one of you were in the delivery room. - But it's what you do. You just do what you have to do To keep your house in order, To keep your kids doing what they're supposed to be doing. - And safe. - Yeah. And while they're doing what they do, You do what you have to do, And that's just the way we are. That's the way this group of ladies are. - Bounce back. You know, they teach you that in the Q course. They teach you that in ranger school, in sere school. You just have to bounce back. So I regrouped, took a deep breath, and... We're about to go into battle. - Morning wood. - I wish we had that... The froth, you'll see. - Yeah, whatever. - Worth $7 a cup. I want to do something, man. - You know there's gonna be a fight. What are you gonna do, slap each other? There's a breaking of a wrist, A breaking of a finger that's on you. There's a chewing of a nose off. - We hit one of the compounds, And you could just tell right away, you know, That it was gonna be a difficult hit. - They're on building one. - You had less than one hour From the time you left the helicopter, Because if you weren't on the helicopter in another hour, They would fly off for 24 hours, and you had to stay there. - Unlike you, we didn't have any Afghani counterparts. We were... it was us, on our own, And we were out in bad guy country With no support. - And we breached into the house, And it's all squishy and everything. We're walking around, we're like, "what he heck?" Well, at the time, we didn't realize That they didn't have beds or furniture. They just piled rugs. So we're under night vision. You could barely see anything. Your eyes were going glean. And on the floor, you saw some movement, You know, squirming, like, "what the heck?" I was a big guy then, And tony was twice as big as me. We're looking, and all of a sudden, We see two little hands come up from this blanket And lift it over, And looks up and sees green little eyes, And she sits up for second, squeezes her eyes like this. And I'm like... You know, you don't want to say nothing, Because her dad could be in the next room. We all got kids. Imagine your girl starts screaming. So all of a sudden, she did. She started screaming and going nuts. We're like... - Yeah, yeah, "be quiet." - So I pick her up. Starts screaming even more. One of the other rooms had caught fire. So now she's really screaming and going crazy. - We could hear it over the radio. - Yeah, so you could hear it on the... - And I'm like... - 'cause we were outside. - We were all on different houses. - Yeah, we were outside in a gunfight. - I remember I had a baby Ruth bar, So I reach in my pocket, I pull out a little baby Ruth bar. I'm like... you know, she doesn't know what candy is. Going like this, And she's screaming and turning her head and everything. I put it on my lips, and I put it on her lips, And she licks her lips, and she's like, "huh?" I came around the corner, Where they were kind of lining up some other family members. And I come out of the darkness. And I think it was Rodney Trosco at the time, Going, "what the fuck are you doing?" You know, "put the kid down. We're in a gunfight over here." I'm like, "I don't know." I got the rest of my tattoo colored in. - Did you really? Wow, I haven't. I need to get some more... One of the big things about combat Is being able to keep your emotion in check. A lot of people say that we don't have emotions anymore. Well, maybe it's because we're good At controlling our emotions And not letting our emotions overtake everything else. - Because you suppressed all those emotions So much and so long, You don't know what you're supposed to be happy for Or sad for anymore. Zero emotions, across the board. I don't get overly happy. I don't get overly sad. I don't get overly excited. And it, you know, becomes a big burden For the family, too, because they don't know where I'm at. "Did I do a good thing, dad?" "of course, I love you, way to go." - My name is bill Howell, nice to meet you. Yeah, I worked with Jefferson. I'm a special forces guy. - Oh, you are? - Yes, Ma'am. I worked with him there in 5th group. Fix the bike, put it back together, Get it running, yes, Sir. - That's it, right there. - Holy... look at that. September '02. To be able to do this for Jesse is awesome. - You know, he was man that could walk in the room And tell you how it is. That's the way the bike is; It's loud. You feel it, you know, the engine was strong, Just like my father. - Y'all want to try to push it back? - In my head, that emulates everything my father was And what I missed about him. - I mean, there's no way That anyone could ever replace his dad, But if each one of us can give him a little something Of what J.D's not able to, Then I believe we're doing our job as brothers. I would have never wanted to be my wife. I wouldn't have wanted to be one of my sons. Back and forth, back and forth, Not knowing if you're gonna come home, Somebody else getting killed. What kind of... what kind of father was I? I was young. Very hard. Very mean. It's the whole intimacy of family, That I didn't have it when I was a green beret, 'cause I was a good green beret. Did a lot of things wrong. Good lord. And if I could, I'd do a lot of them different. I'd sure be a better father and a better husband. You know, it's just... What can you do, But try to learn and move forward, you know? - Is that dad? - That's dad. - I just don't believe it. - I remember when my dad initially got his paperwork About how he's gonna Go, go, go, go. Going, gone! Have fun! Found something. And I'm sure it's gonna be very compelling! Text me, mcgee. Let me know who the bad guy is. Found a requisition for the car In a dod motor pool database That I do not have access to, but I accessed anyway. Uh, car was requisitioned to an op Called lex... Talionis? Uh... What just happened? I have no idea. Huh. Let's go find out. You know what lex talionis is? I know the phrase-- latin. It means, uh, law of retaliation; Eye for an eye; that kind of thing. Oh, you ever heard of an op with that name? No. I'm locked out! What the hell's going on? I don't know. Agent gibbs, I have no idea what you're talking about. We got a dead petty officer driving A vehicle assigned to lex talion. Why is there operational activity That my agents aren't aware of? Director vance, if there's lex talionis activity In the field, then I'm not aware of it, either. Which isn't unusual. You do recall this is a highly compartmentalized operation. Are you in charge or not? I understand your frustration. I know you've been working on this for years. So let's focus. Where was the petty officer assigned? We're still looking. He had navy I.D. But there's no record of him in any navy database. Might be a cover. Could we have some kind of a leak? Well, if there is and the target finds out we're after him, He'll go even deeper underground. And we lose the best shot we've had at finding him in years. Understood. Do your thing. I'll see what I can find out on my end. Get me carschenk at naval intelligence. And ambassador edmunds at state. Agent gibbs, I think it's time to bring in The rest of your team. So what exactly are we looking at? Metropolitan international airport. 1979. Someone detonated a bomb in the departure terminal. I know this. At the time, it was One of the deadliest attacks on american soil in decades. Almost a hundred people injured or killed. Who did it? Nobody knows. Vance: Case went cold and the attack was All but forgotten by the public. But we... Are not the public. And the United States of america doesn't forget. You got a lead. After almost 40 years, you got a lead. Two years ago, Ncis agents in colombia Recovered an unexploded bomb With a striking similarity To the one used at metropolitan airport in '79. Touch dna of the internal components confirmed That both bombs were made by the same bomb maker. Wow. Tony, how exactly Do you know all this and I don't? Admiral tyson immediately classified the intel And created a secret op to track down the bomb maker. And she named the operation lex talionis. Agent gibbs was placed in charge Because of his prior experience in colombia. And he brought tony in, and not me. Or me. Actually you weren't here yet, ziva was. Oh, come on, you're telling me that ziva knew, too? Agent mcgee, your ego is not the subject of this briefing. So, who is the subject? TomÃ¡s orlando... 62. He was formerly a colombian rebel, now he's One of the country's biggest drug kingpins. We narrowed the suspect pool down To orlando about six months ago. How? Well, it's a long story, bishop. Read up. For the past six months, We've tried to get a dna sample From orlando to confirm that he's our guy. He's not an easy man to find. We've been dead in the water. Until today? That's what you need to find out. Whatever's going on with that petty officer, This just might be the break That we've been waiting for. Hello? Abby? Hear you got something. What? Something wrong? Not at all. Tony read me in. I heard the fantastic news that you matched dna From the cold case airport bombing To a recent bomb in colombia. That is... Awesome! So? So I'm just thrilled. You got someone to run Dna for you. Someone with a lab full Of dna-running equipment. I mean, it must be so cool To know somebody like that. Abby, it's not like that. You cheated on me, gibbs. Abby, the dna was in the southeast field office When I was assigned the op. It would've run through too many hands to get up here to you. Okay, that makes sense. Awkward... (anxious laugh) What can I do to make it up to you? Just show me what you got. Consider it done. Or consider it done when I'm done, Which should take me, like, 30 seconds. Okay, I got a lead on our killer. I found bloody fingerprints in the car that belong to this Fine specimen of humanity. Eddie "collarbone" rosario. He's been busted for pimping more times Than I've said the word "pimping." Pimping, pimping, pimping, pimping, pimping. Now we're tied. Our victim said she had a falling out with her pimp. Well, then I would assume That that is him. And judging by the dead bodies, I think he won the argument. Weird. Just got an im from bishop. Yeah, what's it say? The admiral needs to see you right now. Yeah. He's already on his way. Okay, what do we have? The identity of our petty officer. I've brought in our ambassador to colombia. She has news, as well. Ambassador edmunds. Agent gibbs, nice to finally meet you In person, as it were. So, who was he? Tyson: Well, our male victim's real name Was lieutenant louis freston. Gibbs: I know the name. Intelligence specialist. Recently assigned. Apparently he had cultivated lolita as an asset. She has relatives in colombia who claim to know Where our target got his hair cut. You know, we get a report like this twice a week. It never pans out. This one did. The report freston was about to file Says lolita was bringing him a hair sample She'd picked up from colombia. She was going to give it to him the night they were killed. And if his dna matches the dna from the airport bomb, We got our guy. We didn't find a hair sample at the crime scene. According to freston's notes, It was sewn into the lining of the prostitute's purse. We didn't find a purse. Actually, boss, I may have a lead on that. A store owner across the street shot video On his cell, just after the shooting. Let's see it. Pimp has her dna. And you have 12 hours to get it back. The stars are aligning, agent gibbs. Ambassador? Edmunds: Freston's play kicked up some chatter. I just received intel on a meeting between orlando And his top lieutenants. We have a location. I'm scrambling a seal team. You need to verify orlando is our guy. While we have a window of opportunity. This is the best shot we've had in 40 years. Understood. It's payback time. Mcgee? Oh, hey! Where's agent gibbs? In mtac with his favorite agent. I'm sorry. I didn't get the chance to eat. Happy to help. Mcgee: Yeah, I need a bolo out On a convicted pimp named eddie rosario. Street name is collarbone. Uh... Excuse me, how do I, uh...? Do you know how...? Is there a doorbell or something? Excuse me, do you...? Okay, I'm not invisible, people! All right, I'm not invisible! Tony: What do you want, palmer? There is a camera. What do you want, palmer? Dr. Mallard has news, big news! I... Uh... (clears his throat) (door opens) Mcgee's got a bolo out on the pimp. That was palmer scratching at the door. Ducky's got something. Hey, put him up on the screen. Hello, duck. Oh, I forgot you can turn that damn thing on Whenever you want, can't you? Palmer said you had something? Well, during my examination, I found a small tattoo On the young lady's derriÃ �re. It looked as if someone had tried to scrape it off, Which I thought was a bit odd. So, I ran it down. Turns out lolita's pimp brands his girls With that particular tattoo. So, I was able to track the art to... I told tony that you wanted to speak to agent gibbs. Not that gibbs ever actually speaks. After "what do you got, doc?" All I ever get is... Angry glare. Hey, palmer. Angry glare. Uh, pimp brands his girls, and I was able to track The tattoo art to the web site of the parlor that does it. Thanks, bishop. Yeah, may give us a lead On where collarbone hangs out. All right, take, uh, mcgee with you, huh? (laughs) all right, mcgee. You've been pouting the whole car ride-- let's hear it. So, two years, huh? I don't want to hear it. You've been working on this op for two years And never said anything. Well, it was, um... What do you call it? Oh, yeah! Classified. Oh, come on, how many times have I hacked Classified data and shared it with you? 47 times. Yeah, it's... You know what? That's probably right. But you proved my point. Which is? Can't trust you anymore. (sighs) you're just upset 'cause gibbs read me in and not you. That's not it at all, all right? I'm sure he had his reasons. As misguided as they probably were. Sign number one you've walked into the wrong tattoo shop. Smells like cat pee? Yeah. (groans) Man: Just a sec! Got a bleeder! We'll wait. Hope he enjoys the hepatitis. Hey, we're not done yet, by the way. Well, what is left? I was read in first. And now you have been read in. How do I know you're not working on another secret op? How do I know you're not working on another secret op? Are you working on another secret op? Mcgee! Hurts, doesn't it? Tony: All right, for what it's worth, I felt bad lying to you. I think you enjoyed it. A little bit. But mostly I felt bad. Apology accepted. (clears his throat) You two... Maybe want to be alone? Edward rosario? Nobody calls me edward. It's collarbone. We're not "nobody." (speaks spanish) Yeah, thank god I'm out of that car. You two have the worst taste in music I've heard in my life. Ah! You found the pimp. Pimp by night. Tattoo artist by day. The purse? In his trunk. There was a dna tube sewn in to the lining. I'm running it down to abby now. I will brief gibbs. Okay. Commander, give me a sitrep. My men are deployed and standing by. Just awaiting the go-order. We're chomping at the bit here. We all are, commander hankos. Might not be much longer. Tony and mcgee found the pimp. They get our target's dna? Tony's bringing the sample to abby, as we speak. Shouldn't take her long to verify that orlando is our guy. How secure is your team's position? Colombia's not the safest place for navy seals To hang out in, but they'll make do. Understood. Where's the pimp? Hankos: You think he's working with orlando? We're gonna find out. If he is, no deals, no plea bargains. You make him pay. People may have forgotten about the metropolitan attack. I haven't. Commander hankos hasn't forgotten? He must've been, like, a baby when the attack happened. He was. What he hasn't forgotten Was growing up without a father, because of it. (sighs) What are the odds he'd be the one commanding this mission? About as good as it gets. He asked to command this mission. When it's time for payback, he wants to be the one To write the check. And I know exactly how he feels. (sighs) Sit down. Sit down or I'll sit you down. (laughs) You don't scare me. You lay one hand on me, And... (chuckles) Go on. I'll wait. Finish. Fine. Sitting works, if you want to be all anal about it. How long you been working for tomÃ¡s orlando? Who? That jog your memory? Nah. You killed her And you took something from her. I don't know what you're smoking, But I'd like a hit. The dna sample that was in her purse. And you took it. Why? (laughs) dna, man! Dna! I don't know anything about no-no dna. Do I look like a dna kind of guy to you? You look like a life without parole Kind of guy. I got your vehicle's tire tracks at the crime scene. Got your bloody prints on the victim. Okay, wait a second here. Dna! Talk. Hey, look, I already told you. I don't know what you... Who told you to take that sample? I don't know what you're talking about! Okay, I... I manage a tattoo parlor during the day, okay? But at night, I-I-I... I run this small freelance escort service. You're a pimp. Okay, semantics. Anyways... Lolita was one of my girls. Then, last week, she tells me she's out! Nah. No. No one quits collarbone, no. Then, last night, I find out she's Working my turf, I-I... I got to send a message to my girls, man. So, you kill her? A man's got nothing... If he doesn't have his reputation. Why'd you take the dna? The dna? I don't know anything about no dna, man! I told you! Because whatever bank she made that night was mine! I mean, fair's fair, right? You seem reasonable. (door opens) Hi. Apologies to rule 22, gibbs, But I finished running orlando's dna and... Are your men in position, commander? They will be in half a mike. Bishop: Where are they? I don't see anyone. They're there. Any chatter from the locals? Nothing. We are a go for takedown. Takedown is a go. Squad leader: Roger. Copy that. Move in. Switching to helmet cams. Squad leader: Breaching the back entrance. Clear. Fan out. Loop around. Clear! Clear. Commander, the target isn't here. Nobody is. The intel our office received was good. Orlando had a confirmed meeting With his top lieutenants in the building at 2100 hours. Vance: He could have found out about the assault. Did you alert the government of colombia That we were making a play? With all due respect, are you out of your mind? Uh, boss, we've got commander hankos on the line. Patch him in. Edmunds: I'm already getting Screaming phone calls from my counterpart, Wondering if the u.S. Is running an op On sovereign colombian soil. Commander, what's your status? Hankos: My men are holding position In the delta quadrant. They started taking fire from some locals, So we had to pull back from orlando's compound. Is it your recommendation, then, that we abort the mission? Hell, no. Place was cleaned out in a hurry. We're right on his tail. You get any useful intel from the compound? We recovered a partially destroyed laptop, But the hard drive's still intact. Anything there we could use to track the target? Unknown. It was encrypted. My tech's still trying to access it. Commander, abby sciuto and I might have some better luck. You're welcome to try, but it'll take At least 12 hours to get that laptop to dc. My men don't have that kind of time. Our people can meet. Meaning what? The commander's aircraft carrier in the gulf. I'll... Run down to tell abby. In the meantime, what do I tell the colombian ambassador? You're a diplomat. Say something diplomatic. Nice timing. Nice timing. Me first. Me first. Abby first. Go. I got a second hit On the most recent dna sample from orlando. It's a familial match. He has a niece that lives outside baltimore. Well, she may be in contact with the uncle. Maybe she knows where he is. Abbs, good work. Now go pack your bags. Where am I going? Hey. Abby found a relative. We heard. Relative's name is dr. Susanna soto. Runs a family therapy practice in rosedale. How long she been here? She was born in the states. Going by dna, her father and orlando were brothers. Were? Yeah, her parents were killed when she was seven. Raised by her mother's family. We don't even know if she knows her uncle. Any contact with anyone in colombia? Nothing on her cell or landline. E-mail. Not on her main account, But she could have others we don't know about. We would need physical access to her computer to be certain. Tony: We already got a warrant, but if we go in heavy, The uncle could be watching-- might tip him off. What's the play? There's no time for a lengthy interrogation, And we risk getting bad intel if we turn the screws. That's the play. Aw. We're gonna be parents. Tony: Boss, you reading us? Loud and clear. All right. So, what's the plan, bishop? Bishop: We go in, get settled. Then I excuse myself to use the bathroom, I find dr. Soto's pc And mirror her hard drive onto this. Perfect. Wives first. Thanks, honey. Soto: Come on in. We're back here. Please come in. Join us. (chuckles softly) Oh. Hi. Uh... (chuckles) Um, is this the parenting class? There was a mix-up on the web site. Tonight is my couples intimacy class. Oh. Well, this should be interesting. Tony: I lied. I was a... Afraid to tell you the truth. (chuckles) because... I-I didn't think you would come. Soto: Oh, I see. But you must understand, The first ingredient for intimacy is trust. Tony: All right, let's check out these cool pillows. Comfy. (grunts, laughs) Soto: Uh... Why don't you both sit down? Actually, I have to use the restroom. Please. You're here, so be here. But I really... Sit. Please. Okay. (quietly): Thank you. Now, take his hands. Huh? Oh, gosh. For real, I-I'm actually getting over a cold. Hands-- out. Guess that's better than my feet. (awkward laughter) Now, look into his eyes... (mouthing) Ah, geez. I can't watch this. Okay. Now what? No. Don't break eye contact. Bishop: So, now what? Just keep looking. He's going to file for hazard pay. Whoa. Okay... Tailhooking is the coolest thing I have ever done in my life. Well, so much for hugging a panda. Agent mcgee, ms. Sciuto, glad you could make it. Follow me. We're tight on time. Any progress accessing orlando's laptop? I'll let petty officer goode fill you in. Hi. I'm... Yeah, yeah, yeah, agent mcgee. You wasted your time coming here. I was able to access the laptop on my own, So you might as well get back on your... Your, uh... You're abby sciuto. And you're... Petty officer goode. You dated my roommate's brother's best friend, Like, 11 years ago. Wow. You have a really good memory. You're kind of memorable. Abby: Um... Uh, so you accessed the laptop. Yeah. And...? Oh, and I found the details to the meeting On orlando's compound that we already knew about. That was about it. Okay. Do you mind if we take a look ourselves? Uh, hold on-- one second. Did you say 11 years ago? No. Yeah. Uh, my roommate's brother's best friend Was a barista at this coffeehouse called buzzed. Oh, buzzed. Hey, we know that well. I used to take you there all the time, 11 years ago. Oh. (chuckling): Oh. So, are the two of you... No. No. Abby: Uh... (sighs) (sighs) what was that? I mean, you know, you're... You're like my brother and... Yeah, I know, you're like my sister, But I wouldn't (sighs) you like that. Come on. (chuckling): Oh. Okay, now I get it. What do you get? You got dogged by the barista. Right under your nose. Uh, could we just please get to work and...? I mean, it was... Abby, don't worry about it. It's ancient history. It's fine. Listen, you, Our friend abby sciuto here said that we need To get to work, so... How about we do that? Yeah, uh... If I let that one get away, I'd bury myself in my work, too. Or start drinking. (laughs) my lady. Oh. How did your undercover op go? No comment. (sighs) I need a shower. Oh... (chuckles) So, uh, who's briefing gibbs? Not me. I need a moment. For what? I may have intimacy issues. Well, tonight, I was thankful for them. Our people having any luck with orlando's laptop? Agent mcgee said they'll need another hour. It's getting tight. Who made contact with the family member? I finally got permission to use the restroom... Is she talking to orlando? It's going to take some time to find out. She's got some issues of her own. She's a cyber-hoarder. She's got three decades of files on her pc. It could take weeks to run it all down. We don't have weeks. Just a matter of time before orlando Finds out navy seals were in his compound. Then he goes down and never comes back up again. We either find this guy this go-around Or we could lose him forever. Found him. Where? Squad room. In the where? Squad room, ma'am. Hello. I am tomÃ¡s orlando. I am seeking asylum from the United States of america. (door opens) Per regulations, I notified state of his asylum request. They wanted to know, quote, "how the hell he got through customs." Well, he's a professional drug smuggler. I doubt he waited in line. What's he up to? Well, whatever it is, He's got a pair, I'll give him that. So what's the play? He came to us. Let's go find out. May I assume you've spoken to your state department? (tony scoffs) I wouldn't hold my breath. Asylum isn't really for, um... What do they call it again? Oh, yeah, terrorists. I'm a freedom fighter. You are a murderer and a drug dealer. Maybe if your country stopped giving weapons To the wrong team, I wouldn't have to sell drugs to finance my cause. Oh, really? You got a cause? Justice. From a corrupt government. A government which has imprisoned me for decades Because I stood up to it. So now you're going to be in prison here, for decades. I had nothing to do with that airport attack. Nothing. That's interesting. Your dna was on the bomb, pal. Whatever dna you have is not mine! I'm being set up. Talk. I've known for months The United States government was trying To get a sample of my dna. I just didn't know why. At least not until your informant was killed. The girl... Her family came to me for protection. They told me everything. That's when I realized I was being framed. I had nothing to do with the metropolitan bombing. Nothing to do with it. Fascinating. So you just decided to pop up north here And tell us that in person? I came here because I have a family. And I know how you cowboys work. Shoot first, ask questions later. My children... Are more important to me than my entire empire. I'm not willing to risk them getting cruise-missiled Coming home from school one day. I want them to learn how to read, Not how to scan the skies, looking for drones. So... You win. Just like that. I was retiring anyway. I was announcing it at that meeting you tried to crash. And I can see that you don't trust me. The beauty is... You don't need to. See for yourself. I didn't make that bomb. Whoever did found out that you're after him And he is playing you. He's playing you like a fiddle. Jimmy: Found the instruction book in the drawer. Just like abby said. I have orlando's dna. Let's see if we can match it To the original airport bomb. Maybe you guys need a caf-pow. Are you sure you can handle this? The instruction manual, please, mr. Palmer. Don't you think that I should probably take The driver's seat on this one, doctor? Driver's seat? This is an autopsy- - I do have more extensive lab training. Oh, really? Oh, come now, gentlemen. No need to fight. I graduated with top honors From my class of forensics At, uh, the university of edinburgh. Yes, in nineteen-twenty...? Pull up, jimbo. I'm just saying. That you wish to be cleaning intestines Off the autopsy floor for the remainder Of your tenure at ncis? That sounded like a threat, doctor. Well, apparently, my command of the english language Has not been dulled by the ravages of time. Nor my ability to read. Let it go, elsa. You wanted to speak with me, ambassador? Yes, I'm running out of lies to tell the columbian government. They know we're up to something. It's a moot point now. My men are pulling back to the extraction point Since ncis has the target in custody. In custody? He turned himself in while you were in conference. It's a fluid situation. He claims that he's been set up. It's not a claim. He was set up. Orlando's not our guy. His dna does not match the sample from the airport bomb. Someone tried to frame him. Are you sure? As it gets. So we have nothing. We're back to 40 years ago. No... No, we have something. We know the bomber's still alive. 12 hours ago, he used dna off his own head To try and frame orlando. Edmunds: When the columbians realize just what kind Of incursion we've committed, They'll place their military on high alert. If I'm gonna reactivate my team, we're gonna need something fast. Well, I guess you've come to the right place. Or... I have. Hi, gibbs. Hi, vance. Hi, other people Pushing buttons and stuff. Abbs, what do you got? A keystroke logger, gibbs. Mcgee found it embedded on orlando's laptop. Someone has been spying on him for weeks. Good work, but orlando's no longer our target. Well, who was on the other side of that bug? Um, I traced it back to a state department ip address. Ambassador edmunds...? You had access to orlando's computer for weeks, And you neglected to tell us? I'm sorry, what did you say? The connection's getting fuzzy. Vance: Get me the secretary of state. Call diplomatic security at foggy bottom, tell him That we have a situation with ambassador edmunds. Mps caught up with her in the parking lot. Turned herself in. Says she wants to talk to you. Yeah, well, feeling's mutual. I want to make a deal. Oh, I'll bet you do. We don't have much time, you know that. Tell me what's going on. Not without a deal. You're protecting a terrorist. Talk, and I will see if I can help. They will never give you a deal. Someone gave you access to the bug on orlando's laptop. You fed us his location. You helped set him up. Who are you working for? I'm not working for anybody. I'm not a willing accomplice. I was threatened. By who? 35 years ago, He was in prison for leading a communist rebel group. When he got out, he moved into the drug trade. He told me if I didn't help him frame orlando, He would kill everyone I care about. Why didn't you come to us? Because you were working for him. No. What does he have on you? I took money. For pushing a favorable u.S. Drug policy in colombia. Just once. That was it. And then... And then he owned you. Yeah. He attacked your country. Are you gonna tell me his name or not? Newscaster: There's no official confirmation, yet, But we have reports that the u.S. Navy launched A drone strike, early this morning, Against the compound of armand luna, a colombian drug lord. It is rumored that dna evidence has linked luna To the 1979 bombing Of metropolitan international airport. You gonna remain silent, too, sir? We got him. So maybe it was just a teensy little overlap Exactly how much overlap are we talking about here? It is, but I need to know whether or not I can trust you. Don't ever say you can't trust me, mcgee. Director. I have a debriefing at the pentagon, But I just wanted to thank you both personally. Thank you, commander. You put your men on the line for a thing. A thing that a lot of people forgot about. You didn't. Neither did my mother, my sisters or my big brother. They thank you, too. It's the president, director. Press conference starts in 25 minutes. Got to go. Time to let the other families know That they weren't forgotten, either. Oorah. Hey, guys. Hey. What's up, man? Hey! What's up, palmer?

Don't let him go! Hey, let go! Oh, God! - What? Break the window! It's top secret! - Get back! What is this? Sethji! Sethji! Give me the file! Give me the file! Sethji! Please listen to me. Listen... nab him! Nab him! Hey! Shut the door! - Get back! Praveen! Catch him! What did he eat for breakfast? Don't let him get out of here! Stop him! Open the door! Sethji! ' open Up! Sethji! Get out or I will drag you out. Sethji! Sethji! Open the door. Sethji, open the door. - How does it matter? What are you doing? - Sethji, please. Please! Meer Saukhat Ali. Muslim! Muslim! Remember! What is true, is right. What is this, God? Why did you create this mess? This is a major disaster! You created me a Muslim and had me raised as a Hindu? And You've chosen to reveal the suspense today! Today? Fifty years after the event! Did You forget I am a Brahmin? Here, look at this. Look at this! A Brahmin. Yes, I've eaten eggs. I have eaten chickens and so on. I have drunk liquor too. That... that's a hobby. I like that. It's not what I was taught. My values were that of a Brahmin. But, this is a huge punishment! You've just gone ahead and made me a Muslim! A Muslim! You could have made me something else! God, listen to me. You just say that this is all a dream, okay? But, I will atone for all the sins I have committed! Here, take that! That's for you. Alright? Enough? But, You are going to say that this is a dream. A bad dream. Alright? I know, Yourjustice is delayed, never denied. I will be waiting outside. I don't mind waiting. But, just do all this today if You don't mind. Hello. Remember! That which is right is true! What happened? Why are you shouting? What happened? What? Punditji. If I am true, then why am I not right? I don't get it. Just explain it to me. What can I say to you? I am ruined. I am doomed. - What? I am sure, it was a characterless debauch! He satiated his lust and tossed me at someone else's door. Oh, Lord! What kind of sinners are being born, now? They don't spare young girls. They hound the old ladies. And this is the limit! I mean, they didn't even spare a man of your age! - What? What are you imagining? - No! You did the right thing. You have come to Lord Shiva. Here's what I will do. I will go inside and get a Panchmukhi Rudraksha. You have wear it around your neck. That will heal you and set you right, too. I'll be right back. Where is it? Indu? What are you looking for? Allah! - What? I'm looking for my key ring. Why? - The key ring. Dad! - Yes. Who gave this? - Allah sent it. What? - Bhalla sent it. It's Mr. Bhalla's advance. It's a dinner order for a hundred people. Why didn't you say it's Bhalla? Alright. "Who created me?" "My shadow questions me." "I am lost, whether I exist or not." "My soul is in agony, let me see you." "Oh, Lord, take away this pain." "Oh, Lord." "Oh, Lord." "Tell me, who I am." "You are God and the Almighty." "Oh, Lord." Indu. My life is completely messed up. I wish I hadn't opened Baa's locker. You know, the one who adopted me... No, no... "Where did I come from?" "Who am I truly?" "I think at every moment." "I see that I am torn." "My prayer is silenced in the noise." "My soul cries out." "Let me see you." "Heal my sorrow." "Oh, Lord." "Oh, Lord." Indu. L...was born in a Muslim family. I am a Muslim by birth! Bomb blast in Pune. Today evening, in Vishrantwadi... lndu... - These people are going too far. What happened? - Watch this! I don't know what these Muslim folks want! These people are instrumental in doing everything wrong! Even in the police station 8 out of 10 wanted guys are Muslims! Whyjust 8 out of 10? - ...person has... 10 out of 10 are Muslims! What are you talking about? The Opposition Leader Mr. Kulkarni believes that this is orchestrated by a Muslim group. What about this incident? Yes. I didn't do this. I didn't do this, either. But, we are being blamed for it. Yes, but I am not responsible for it. Then who is responsible for blaming us? If there is any bomb blast in any place or a terrorist attack we are accused at once. They never take a good look at themselves. Can I say something? I understood your mentality the day you asked me to shift into a Muslim locality. Panditji, don't mind, but I want to ask you something. Why do you people hate us so virulently right from your birth? Mehmood Bhai, I am a Muslim, too. Bhai, do you realize what you are saying? I was born a Muslim. Really. What are you going to do about this, now? Are you going to broadcast it? Will you tell everybody? Will you stick it up on the notice board? Get in. - Why? Is it because I am a Muslim? No, because you are hassled. Tell me. What's the matter? Giving up one's own child! One's own child! If you didn't want the responsibility then why have a child? If in future you find out that you were born in a Muslim family won't you be disturbed? I was born a Muslim. I mean, you find out that you were born in a Hindu family, won't it bother you? Won't you feel disturbed? I get it. I just want to find out who was my dad. What is the name of your biological father? Meer Shaukat Ali. Meer Shaukat Ali. You are right. Biological father. That's correct. He's not my dad, he gave birth to me and abandoned me! How can he be my dad? Biological father! That's right. By tomorrow evening can it be done? Can you find out? I'll try my level best. I will try. No, not at four, meet me at six o'clock, tomorrow. - Oh! Don't move. - What is it? You look good. Flatterer. We will go to Himachal for our honeymoon. Besides, it's horribly hot here in June. We can go on a honeymoon if we get married, first. Don't worry, Shraddha. Just let me train dad a bit, and after that... Yes, but hurry up, Amit! You know Uncle Vyas wants his son to marry as soon as possible! And dad is also... He said, the day of appearance is 2 weeks away and on that day... Shraddha, don't get tense. I have found something, today which will put dad in a good mood. It's a very old, very rare clip from Manchala (film). Okay, very good. Now, just be quick and get him around... - I think, dad is here. Let me have him meet you too. Dad! Shraddha is online. You're flirting online, too? Nice. Hello, dear. - Hello, Uncle. My dear, I'm not that kind of orthodox father-in-law. Tell her, she has to be free and uninhibited. Just be free. - Yes. But, Uncle, these are our values. My dear, you are too young to get caught up in the values' tangle. Both of you love each other, right? Yes. - You love each other, right? That's settled then! And you know what they say if the couple is willing, what will Neelanand be able to do about it? That's all very well, Uncle, but I don't want to hassle my dad. Why can't you be a bit religious? It's really simple. Just pray a bit. Apply the tilak (sect marking) and wear a cap. That's all. Well, if you kids want me to wear a cap, I'll do that too. Alright, then, we'll meet. Okay. - Bye, dear. - Okay, bye. Bye, Uncle. - Okay. - Hail Neelanand. Hail Neelanand. If the girl says bye, say bye darling, say, bye love. Why are you saying Neelanand? If you do this at the wedding night then, she'll grow a beard and become an ascetic. Get it? Come on, dad! That is ridiculous. - "Come on, dad!" Dad. - Yes. I found a very rare, very old clip of Manchala. What are you talking about? - Yes. And you are telling me this, now? "I'm the Sardar (leader) of Bhangra, do you know, baby?" "It's unending, do you know, baby?" What's going on, dad? In those days, Manchala was accused of trafficking while conducting foreign tours. That when this clip was taken. He was an amazing singer. I wonder where he is? What is this? Dad! _ Yes? I took life membership of the Neel Parivar (family) today. They gave me a ten percent discount. Besides, they gave me the Neel granth free. Wow. - We must read this and obey it. Obey it. The Neel Parivar's book is blue. Does your Baba watch blue (adult) films, too? Dad! Here. Get your act together. Yes, Dharam Bhai. Any news of the man who created me? I have put some of my men on the job. All of us are doing our best, to find out. God willing, we will know soon enough. Okay, listen, let's meet at home, tonight. That's enough! Drink up. Mehmood Bhai? In Ahmadabad? I have a permit. - In that case, cheers. What is it? Is this Scotch? - Yes. It's orange flavored. I'll give you some that's lemon flavored the next time you visit. Did you find out what happened? Your Muslim dad? Not my dad, my biological father. Okay, cool down! Let me tell you a story. Listen, Dharam Bhai. Your dad isn't what you think he is. What do you mean? I have a friend. Dr. Farooque. Coincidentally, he knows your father. He was telling me that your father was admitted to his clinic a couple of times. And according to Dr. Farooque your father is a very good man. When you were an infant your mother expired. In those days, your father had a financial crisis at home. Later, he got hired as a driver in Kuwait. That's why, he had to leave. He was helpless and so he forced himself to hand you over to a relative. He went to Kuwait. The custodian of the child began to find it a burden. That's when the relative took the child that is you, and handed you over to the orphanage. Four years later, when your father came back from Kuwait he found out about all this. God knows, how he felt at that time. He went to the orphanage, searching for you. But, Mr. Trivedi had adopted you by then. The authorities didn't even tell him who the adoptive parents were. He was really traumatized. Due to that sorrow, he didn't even marry again. I believe, he has donated all his worldly goods to charity. And these days, he is in the Khwaja Garib Nawaz sanatorium at Sarkhej, living out the last days of his life. Oh, God! Your story is like a movie! Alright, please wait. Here he is. Dad! - What are you doing? You will make me a sinner! This is taboo. I am not your father. Why are you calling me dad? No, brother, he told me that... I know. I understand your feelings. Come on. I will explain it. Now, Meer Shaukat Ali is over 80 by the grace of God. He's 80 years old? - By the grace of God. May God grant him a long life, but at present, he is not too well. That's why I am saying that... That is what I am saying too, brother. You see, a man who has lived his entire life chanting the name of God and if he meets his only son in the last days of his life and he finds out his son is not a Muslim. Just think of how shocked he will be! He will be terribly upset. Right? So, you mean, I can't meet him? -You can meet him. Yes. -You can meet him. I didn't say that. Okay' But, I would like you to meet him in a way that he feels happy. He must not regret it. He should breathe his last with pride. He must not die due to the shock. Do you understand? Come this way. - So, how can I meet him? As a good Muslim. You do know what a good Muslim is like. Yes. What is a Muslim like? They have long beards up to here. They hitch up their trousers. They have black marks on their forehead and.. Oh, God! May the Lord have mercy! That means, you really don't know anything about Muslims. Come along. That's why I was telling you you should find out all about Muslims and then come back here. God willing, you can meet your father, then. Can't I just meet him? I'll tell him that I am a Muslim. And that my name is Wasim Akram. Or, Nawaz Sharif. - You're lying in the abode of God. And in front of a clergyman! Let's have some other name. First of all, it is not Nawaj, it is Nawaz. Nawaz? - Yes, Nawaz. N awaz. So, you can leave. Learn the ways and customs. Get some information. And, then you can meet your father. Good bye. N awaz. N awaz. Wretched clergyman! He wants to make you a Muslim. Don't worry. This is your legal and fundamental right to meet your father. I'll draft out a notice to him. Under Section 340. He'll get back on track at once. Please don't issue any notice. Or everyone will notice me. If people find out that I was born a Muslim then, that's the end of it. I'll become a social outcast. The kids aren't married yet. Whatever has to be done has to be done on the sly. I wouldn't have scaled the wall and come over at midnight, otherwise. So, you will become a Muslim. It really doesn't make any difference to me. Make me a Muslim, make me a wrestler or whatever. That's the very least I can do to meet my dad. Tell me something. You never met your father, you've never seen him. There has been no connection. Why are you longing to meet him? I want to see what is a father like? I was four years old, when my dad died. I have never seen him. Forget about that, and just tell me something. These Muslims ways and customs I mean, saying the prayers and whatever. Rituals, customs, traditions, call it what you will. Teach me that. Okay? That's it, then! - Marhaba! What? - Marhaba! Marhaba? Cheers! Marhaba. - Cheers. Here's the cap. Amazing. You look like a born Muslim. Teach me the ways and customs of a born Muslim. Then, I'll fit the bill to a T. Hold. Let me take a picture. Keep the chin up. Smile now. Yes, pleasant. Are we done? - Done. - Yes? Be seated, please. What should I do? - That means, sit down. I'm sitting down. Tell me. - Bismillah. So, let us begin with the greeting. What is that? I meant the greeting. The greeting? - Yes. What is that? - Greeting. Greeting. - sent this. They got Alex on tape busting out of the NYPD warehouse. Alex knew successfully pulling off two heists was a long shot. And she made sure NYPD put all the antiquities in one place. Add a bit of cat burglary... a little auto theft... and she makes off with both hauls simultaneously. Let's cut her off. Jones, talk to me. Dug into the video NYPD sent over. I'm tracking a box truck, plate number Ida-union-2-0-0-6. Traffic cams have it southbound on 2nd. She won't stay on a street with heavy traffic. Jones, call the 17th. Get them to scramble cars through truck routes and industrial thoroughfares. I'm on it. How did I not see this coming? You're an Aries, aren't you? Yeah, March 21st. Why? Please say a command. Horoscope. Aries. Hello, Aries. It's a 3-out-of-10 day. The moon-uranus conjunction in a sign of Aries will allow you to see an old acquaintance in a new light. But don't be fooled. You will soon revert to old roles. You checked my horoscope? I had some time to kill while you were in lockup. And, I repeat, you checked my horoscope? You have to admit, it's dead-on. Horoscopes always seem relevant. That's the con. But if you're gonna start taking life advice from a car... You're no fun. Well, I'm having a 3-out-of-10 day. Burke, we pulled her over. We're pulling her out. I'm done with you. I hope you didn't get too attached to that second star. She won't be armed, Peter. Stand back. Spiteri, get the hell out of the van. Put your hands up where I can see them. Come on. Where's Hunter? She's gone. There was another car. What other car? I don't know. A black car. What the hell were you thinking? That I would take back what was taken from my country. Peter, you should get back here. Cuff him. That's definitely not Greek. No, I'd say late 19th-century Russian. This was her angle from day one. And she's been one step ahead of us the whole time. She's gone, Peter. She's gone. You left the candelabra. I don't know why, but I thought you'd be more sentimental. Well, if I can't have the treasure, I'll take a treasure. You used Spiteri. He was using me to the same end. And you played me. Was any of it real? Yeah, well, there's really a villa in Sardinia that needs decorating. But we were never just Neal and Alex. This is Neal and Alex. I could call Peter right now. Oh, but you wouldn't. Because you owed me a treasure. Now... We're even. I don't trust you touching my wires. Oh, I wouldn't either. If I find out you've bugged my house... well, that would be easy. I'm just saying, you've got a mess back there. Hey, Neal. Hey, Peter. Come on in. Thanks. Moz. Uh, can I get you anything? No, I'm good. Thanks. Glad you're here. I'm happy you decided to watch that with us. You got to pick who you can trust, right? Well, whatever it is, if Ellen had wanted the whole world to see it, she would have given it to Channel 5 News. Instead, she gave it to me. And, maybe if she was still alive, she would have wanted you to see it. I don't know. But you don't want to make that decision for her. No. I want to make it for me. Whatever's on here... I know. You ready to see what Ellen wanted to show you when you were 3 years old? I am. NARRATOR: Our planet: Earth. You may think you know it well. But a startling new picture is emerging of a world shaped by forces more dynamic and intertwined than we ever imagined, raising possibilities that defy common sense. How can sandstorms in the Sahara Desert transform the Amazon rainforest over 5,000 miles away? In the frigid ocean beneath Antarctica, how can a vast undersea waterfall 500 times bigger than Niagara Falls lead to a gigantic feeding frenzy near the equator? And how can warm water streaming past the coast of Africa trigger a weather catastrophe half a world away in the southern United States? Scientists have begun to find surprising answers to these and other profound questions thanks to a network of satellites orbiting high above the earth. Ever watchful, their senses extend far beyond what our eyes can see. EMILY SHUCKBURGH: It's really the last bastion of human discovery. We're discovering new things every day. NARRATOR: What are these hidden forces that rule our world? How are the oceans, the continents, the atmosphere and even the sun bound together, and how do they affect all living things? For the first time, we can understand how earth, fire, wind and water join together to create the dynamic environments that shape life in all its forms. WALEED ABDALATI: Their interaction is what has created the environment, the diversity, the kind of life we see on earth today. NARRATOR: With astonishing images created from a wealth of new information from satellites, this is our planet as never seen before. "Earth from Space," right now on NOVA. ♪ NOVA 40x11 ♪ Earth From Space Original Air Date on February 13, 2013 == sync, corrected by elderman == Major funding for NOVA is provided by the following: NARRATOR: Since humans first ventured into space, some of the greatest gifts of exploration have been the new views of our home. Who can forget the iconic "earthrise" images of the Apollo era? And now from the International Space Station, we have these spectacular vistas. The blue marble is finally revealing its secrets. It's a planet alive with activity and constant change, its surface transformed by humans yet still ruled by powerful natural forces that we are only beginning to understand. ABDALATI: It's just spectacular when you view it from space. It's teeming with diversity, with beauty. Amazing colors, you know, the blues and the greens and the whites. PIERS SELLERS: You see the world as one huge system all linked through the atmosphere and the oceans, rolling its way around the sun. NARRATOR: So what is it that shapes Earth's dynamic face? What are the essential ingredients, and how do they combine to generate and sustain all life? How do the natural forces that surround us work together to create an engine powerful enough to nourish and drive life forward in all its diversity? Our best hope for answers may come from above. Orbiting over our heads are 120 satellites keeping watch from space. Most operate at altitudes ranging from a few hundred miles above the surface of the planet to as high as 25,000 miles. Each one of these Earth-observing satellites reveals a different piece of the puzzle. Each carries an array of exquisitely sensitive detectors, designed to reveal what would otherwise be hidden from our view. The satellites are absolutely amazing because not only can we see visible things from space, but also we can see things that aren't visible to the human eye. So satellites are enabling us to turn what are invisible processes into visible things we can see and then understand. NARRATOR: To see how our world works, in this program we have taken information provided by satellites, combined it with computer models, and rendered the results in these scientifically accurate graphics. With the invisible now revealed, we can see Earth as an endlessly changing system. These images will show in great detail how sunlight, moisture, land and atmosphere interact in unexpected ways, with seemingly local events often triggered by forces far away in space and time. And with these new insights, for the first time, scientists can begin to understand the intimate relationship between the planet and all the living things it supports. ABDALATI: It's really the thrill, because it matters so much, of piecing together the story of what the earth is doing, how it's changing, why it's changing and how ultimately that affects humans. NARRATOR: The first piece of the puzzle is in understanding the massive influence the sun, from 93 million miles away, has on our planet. The world's continuously bathed in a flow of energy from the sun. That warms the earth. Everything that you can see that lives and breathes and moves on the earth is pushed by the sun. NARRATOR: Now an electronic eye in space can measure the impact of the sun's energy all around the earth. One of NASA's newest satellites, named for a meteorologist, polar-orbiting Suomi, launched in 2011, provides the view. The spacecraft is the size of a small school bus. It orbits 500 miles up, circling the planet 14 times a day. On board, it carries five separate sensors that enable it to see things invisible to human eyes. The light that we can see is confined to a narrow band of electromagnetic radiation, just a tiny portion of what the satellite can pick up. Electromagnetic radiation spans a spectrum that goes far beyond the familiar colors of the rainbow. ABDALATI: If you were to consider the full spectrum to be a line that stretched from New York City to Los Angeles, the piece that our eyes could see would be about the size of a dime. There is so much other information out there available to us, and that's in large part what these satellites do. NARRATOR: One of this satellite's key instruments is called CERES, an acronym for Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System. It detects a broad range of the spectrum, including the very short and very long wavelengths of light in the ultraviolet and infrared that we can't see. This is a CERES-eye view of the planet. Anything that emits heat gives off infrared radiation, so the CERES data shows the earth in shades of heat, accurate to a fraction of a degree. It reveals how the planet as a whole reacts to sunlight, both absorbing and reflecting the radiation coming from our local star. At the poles, the sun strikes at an oblique angle, and what little light there is gets reflected back out to space by the ice and clouds. These are the primary reasons why the poles remain cool. At the equator, it's a very different story. Not only does the planet receive more direct sunlight here, the lack of ice means that less of the sun's energy is reflected back into space. And at the equator, the sun's concentrated energy fuels a heat engine that can trigger weather events around the world. Perhaps the best place to see the impact of the sun's heat is an area in the Atlantic just north of the equator and west of Africa: the coastal waters of the Cape Verde islands. Here, the sea provides a living. The local fishermen keep a careful eye on the weather. They know that storms can bring a good catch. Turbulent weather stirs up nutrients from the deep, attracting great shoals of fish. It's the hottest time of the year, and the sun beats down relentlessly. By late afternoon, the huge inflow of heat energy has led to the buildup of large cloud formations. Sometimes, these formations develop into massive storms. It's a process that satellites are revealing in fine detail. Circling above the fishermen is a NASA satellite called Aqua-- Latin for "water." It orbits the poles. One of its key tasks is to monitor the complex interaction between sunlight and water. JEFFREY HALVERSON: Aqua satellite is one of NASA's flagship satellites. Its primary function is to study the hydrologic cycle on Earth: vapor in the atmosphere, liquid ocean, the temperature of that ocean and the ice. NARRATOR: One of Aqua's instruments looks down at the sea around Cape Verde, again in infrared, sensing heat. Highlighted here in yellow, over one million square miles of ocean reaches a critical temperature: 80 degrees. At this temperature, the sea is evaporating fast, producing an invisible gas: water vapor. SHUCKBURGH: By looking at the infrared, the Aqua satellite is able to measure the amount of water vapor evaporating from the surface of the ocean. NARRATOR: Aqua shows that this area is producing millions of tons of water vapor every hour. Based on that data, it's possible to create an image of what the vapor might look like if these fishermen could actually see it in the air around them. Water vapor is much lighter than air, and vast columns rise upward, directly from the surface of the sea. The water vapor carries with it heat, the energy of the sun. HALVERSON: Well, water vapor is like invisible energy. It's like molecules escaping the ocean, taking heat energy with them, and they're like little mobile solar collectors that are zipping around the atmosphere. NARRATOR: Half a mile up, as the air cools, the water vapor condenses back into liquid water-- tiny droplets that form vast clouds. The vapor releases the sun's energy, the heat it received earlier. The result is a storm. HALVERSON: Molecules condense in the atmosphere and become liquid again, and when that happens, that heat is given off into the atmosphere and it warms the atmosphere, and that's the heat that powers storm systems. NARRATOR: In the worst storms, the heat captured by the water vapor is equivalent to up to 200 times the global production of electricity at any given moment. The process of evaporation results in something we don't need special instruments to see. The rising heat drives the clouds up to ten miles high. As the clouds rise upward, the earth's rotation causes them to spin. The thunderclouds merge into a vast vortex. This is the birth of a hurricane. (loud winds blowing) It is 2005, the busiest hurricane season on record. On August 27, a meteorological satellite is tracking a category three hurricane that started in the Bahamas. Its name is Hurricane Katrina. Throughout the region, there is one question on everyone's mind: will the hurricane hit land, or will it blow itself out? The answer may come from a NASA satellite called TRMM, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. TRMM is equipped with a radar and imager that operate in the microwave range of the spectrum. These are higher in energy and shorter in wavelength than other radio waves. The instruments bounce microwaves off raindrops in the clouds, allowing scientists to build a three-dimensional model of the internal structure of a hurricane. HALVERSON: We can actually look at microwave energy which is generated within the clouds and coming from the ocean's surface. It's almost as if the clouds are now invisible to us; we can see right through them like taking a CAT scan to look inside those clouds. NARRATOR: This satellite is a powerful tool, and now its sensors reveal something ominous. Huge, vertical columns of warm water vapor burst up from near the center of the storm. Almost like hurricanes within hurricanes, these climbing vortices deliver added infusions of energy into the heart of the storm, fueling its growth even more. These new sources of energy are called hot towers. HALVERSON: If they occur in the right place at the right time, near the very center of the system, they can be like a giant spark plug that gets that whole engine running at very, very high speed. NARRATOR: The hot towers draw more and more water vapor off the ocean. This triggers a feedback loop that leads to a runaway reaction. In just 24 hours, Hurricane Katrina grows into a category five monster. (loud winds blowing) (screaming) NARRATOR: All this violence is a direct result of the power of the sun on the ocean. Ferocious winds blow for two days straight, reaching 175 miles an hour, twisting steel like paper and ripping apart homes and buildings. Over three trillion gallons of rain a day and a massive tidal surge from the Gulf of Mexico combine to inundate whole areas of the Gulf Coast. Katrina leaves its mark across 90,000 square miles. Over a million people are displaced. Katrina becomes the standard by which future hurricanes will be assessed. But even this extreme hurricane is just a tiny brushstroke in a much bigger picture: a picture of how the sun drives water around the entire planet with radically different effects in different places, all under the watchful gaze of our eyes in space. Take just a single day in July. In New York, commuters swelter in 95 degree heat. Searing winds pump hot air into the region from the south, creating oppressive, humid conditions. 7,000 miles away, in Mumbai, India, commuters here struggle to cope with torrential rain. The deluge comes so fast that the streets are flooded in hours. Meanwhile, in Chile, the desert of the Atacama is almost totally dry. There are places here where rainfall has never been recorded. Such diverse environments, thousands of miles apart, appear totally unrelated. But by pulling back for a wider view, we can see that they are in fact intimately connected. Orbiting 22,000 miles from Earth's surface is a chain of five weather-tracking spacecraft, including this one: NASA's GOES East. GOES is an acronym for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. Each moves in a fixed position relative to the earth, called a geostationary orbit. They always look down on the same parts of the planet. The combined data from these five satellites gives scientists a unique perspective on the earth. SHUCKBURGH: By having several of them located at different positions around the equator, we're able to get a view of the whole earth 24 hours a day. NARRATOR: By observing the entire earth, these satellites reveal how energy moves throughout the globe, beginning with the impact of the sun on water. The process is the same everywhere, but the outcome will be very different in different places. Converted from the numerical data, these five circles graphically depict what the satellites actually sense. They reveal the total picture of water vapor produced on earth in a single frame. Seen here in fast forward, one second is equal to a day. It shows how water vapor produced at the equator continuously transports the sun's energy towards the poles. Local landscapes and topography affect the vapor's impact, with results unique to each region. In India at the end of July, the warm water vapor is drawn from over the ocean by the difference in temperature between land and sea. Rising to high altitude, the vapor cools over the land and condenses back into water. We call the result the Asian Monsoon. Nearly a trillion tons of rain falls out of the sky, transforming parched land into fertile plains. The monsoon eventually moves to the east, reaching China, where it floods the paddies that are ideal for growing rice. This process helps provide food for three billion people, almost half the world's population. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world in South America, westbound winds drive water vapor across the high peaks of the Andes. The altitude strips the air of its moisture, which falls as snow on the mountains, creating on the far side in central Chile the arid desert of the Atacama. That same July day in the eastern United States, hot, moist air surges north straight from the Gulf of Mexico. With no natural barrier in the way, more than 100 million Americans, from Memphis to New York, swelter in the summer heat. This graphic, based on information provided by satellites, depicts the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans as they connect in a global pattern of circulation that results in our local weather. SHUCKBURGH: The satellite data shows that it's all one interconnected system, but that in different parts of the world, different processes are happening. We can see the monsoons and their effect. We can see the effects on deserts in a different part of the world. And that together shows us how water vapor is connecting with life on earth. NARRATOR: But this vast cycle of sunlight, water and land is just one pattern among many on this planet we call home. A cycle with even greater consequences for the long-term climate involves extreme cold. To see how that works, we have to turn the earth upside down and look at it from below. Antarctica remains the earth's last great wilderness, a vast frozen continent plunged in darkness for almost six months of each year. In winter, temperatures can drop below minus 110 degrees Fahrenheit, and an incessant 100-mile-an-hour gale blows. It's hard to believe that anything life-giving could start here in this bleak place. But that's exactly what happens. Antarctica's ice plays a vital part in maintaining global climate, sustaining life even in lush, warm jungles thousands of miles away. ABDALATI: Antarctica is a fundamental element of the climate system. And while it may sit silently and majestically at the edge of the planet for very few to see, things go on there that spread out all over the world, that affect the world as a whole. NARRATOR: It's a paradox that such a bleak and barren place is so critical to life on our planet. On average, it's 43 degrees colder than the North Pole. Why should Antarctica be so much colder, and how does that affect the rest of the world? The detectors on NASA's polar-orbiting satellite Suomi provide part of the answer. The instruments sense in the infrared and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. They show that the poles receive little of the sun's energy and reflect most of it back out into space. That's one reason why the poles stay cold. But there's another factor that makes Antarctica colder still. This image has been pieced together from 17 different satellites that sense the infrared, or heat. The continental mass of Antarctica lies beneath this swirling maelstrom of cloud. A computer model of the data shows what happens as the warm moist air arriving from the tropics collides with the cold air over the South Pole. The result is a massive storm system. And just like a hurricane, it rotates as a result of the spin of the earth. Only this is much larger than a hurricane, 4,000 miles in diameter. Where that cold air and warm air meet high up in the atmosphere, the air starts to rotate around Antarctica. The winds can be up in the atmosphere as much as 200 miles an hour. NARRATOR: This circulation pattern is called the polar jet, a ceaseless circle of wind and storms. The relentless clockwise wind, seen here in yellow, drives the seawater below, shown in light blue. DAVID ADAMEC: Those strong winds are sending a jet around in the ocean, and it's driving an ocean circulation that is felt almost all the way to the bottom of the ocean, two and a half miles deep. NARRATOR: The Southern Ocean rings the continent with no land to interrupt a vast body of moving water. This is the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. And these are the "Screaming Sixties," the roughest, most dangerous seas on the planet. Here, storms rage almost every day of the year, whipping hundreds of trillions of gallons of water into a ceaseless frenzy. Now the infrared instrument on the Aqua satellite which senses atmospheric temperature puts the pieces of this puzzle together. The winds of the polar jet and the water of the circumpolar current together form an impenetrable barrier around Antarctica, isolating it from the rest of the planet and depriving it of warmth. That is why the whole region remains exceptionally cold all year round. ABDALATI: What's incredible about what the satellites tell us is that the movement of air and actually the movement of ocean current around the perimeter of Antarctica isolates the continent from the rest of the world. NARRATOR: So why is this relentless cold so important to the planet way beyond Antarctica? The answer lies in a remarkable property of water: what happens when it freezes. The Aqua satellite reveals the start of the process. It sweeps the surface with its microwave scanner, looking through the clouds to detect the distinct signature of ice. SHUCKBURGH: The microwave instruments on the satellite enable us to see through the clouds to the sea ice around Antarctica throughout the year. What's particularly incredible about that is we're able to take measurements of the sea ice in places where as scientists, as humans, we can't even go. NARRATOR: This satellite gives us an accurate picture of the extent of sea ice around Antarctica over the course of a year. Seen here in summer, Antarctica is nearly one and a half times the size of the United States, covered in ice. But in winter, it grows even more. Over five and a half million square miles of ice form around the continent. It grows to the size of all of Africa. This vast ice formation has a profound effect on life across the planet. How can its impact extend so far? One of the best places to understand the power of ice is the huge bay along the northwestern coast of Antarctica: the Weddell Sea. Here, a constant gale blows and cools the seawater to freezing temperatures. Once the upper layer of ocean falls below 29 degrees Fahrenheit, a critical threshold is crossed. The surface of the ocean begins to freeze. (crackling) At a microscopic level, tiny crystals start to grow, knitting themselves together. As the crystals bond, they expel salt into the water. The salt forms brine that drips down long, narrow tubes and holes in the ice as it forms. The brine is denser than regular seawater and it sinks downwards. As winter's grip tightens, the formation of ice speeds up and spreads. Soon, large slicks appear on the surface and thicken into a solid mass. What started as a microscopic process can soon be seen from space. Each year, more than 200 billion tons of ice form in the Weddell Sea alone, releasing tens of trillions of tons of dense brine into the ocean. The fate of all this brine is a mystery. The crucial question is where does it all go? A satellite called Jason, jointly operated by NASA and the French space agency, is providing new answers. Jason bounces radar signals off the surface of the ocean to measure its height. The instrument also reveals the shape of the sea floor far below. We can make very accurate maps of submarine bathymetry. But we don't do that directly; we do that by measuring the surface of the sea from space, very, very accurately and over time. NARRATOR: Jason's radar is so precise that it can detect minute changes in the level of the sea surface produced by the peaks and valleys of the terrain below. The data makes it possible to map the ocean floor. ADAMEC: You have a satellite that's up there, 500 miles up in space, and it's returning an accuracy of a little less than half an inch. What that means is, you know, I've stuck this instrument in Washington, D.C., say, and I'm looking at a crowd of people in Boston and I can tell you whether or not their toes are over the curb or not. That's what this satellite is doing. NARRATOR: The satellite data allows scientists to make a three-dimensional map of the ocean floor beneath the Weddell Sea. It reveals a vast chasm, two miles deep, off Antarctica's continental shelf. As the brine descends into the ocean, it eventually falls over this precipice. Other sensors attached to the sea floor track the flow of the brine as it sinks. SHUCKBURGH: What we're really excited about is that we're able to take that data that shows us what the bottom of the ocean looks like and combine it with data from sensors under the water. And that enables us to look at the dense water and where it goes. NARRATOR: Combining data from satellites and undersea instruments, scientists can reconstruct what is happening hidden beneath the ice. What they learn is astounding. One trillion gallons of salty brine plunge down through the Weddell Sea every hour, a torrent equivalent to the volume of 500 Niagara Falls. The brine spreads out towards the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf and then falls into the chasm revealed by Jason. A vast submarine waterfall plummets downward. The cold, dense brine falls slowly, silently, into the abyss, two miles down to the ocean floor below. It will not resurface for hundreds of years. What happens to the brine next is still being investigated. But computer models combined with satellite data are helping scientists to figure out where it goes. This animation shows the undersea current in action. The purple area is the brine. The outflow from Antarctica drives the salty water towards the equator, along the sea floor. ADAMEC: All the water in the bottom of every ocean around the globe has its start within six miles of the Antarctic continent. It creates the coldest, densest water that's on the planet. NARRATOR: The cold, salty liquid becomes part of a worldwide circulation system, stirring and cooling all the world's oceans. Leaving Antarctica, it has embarked on a journey that could take 1,000 years to complete. As it migrates towards the equator, the cold bottom current mixes with fresher and warmer water and slowly rises. It then joins other ocean currents and eventually returns south, where it cools once more. Finally, returning to Antarctica, the seawater freezes and releases its salt again, completing the cycle. It's an endless loop that is critical to the whole planet. ABDALATI: The importance of dense water in Antarctica is that it really forms the basis of global ocean circulation. The temperature and the salt combine to cause sinking and rising in different parts, which sets up this conveyor belt, this interaction of all of the ocean water. NARRATOR: In the Arctic, frigid winter winds cause the ocean to freeze. The North Atlantic currents cool and sink to the bottom, then head south again. All over the world, slow-moving currents of seawater like this regulate the average temperatures of the oceans to within one degree. This stability has a profound effect on life all across the world. This NASA simulation shows the surface of the entire ocean, a web of currents in constant motion. But satellites show us that the oceans don't work alone. The currents affect the air, the atmosphere, that sits above them. The ocean and atmosphere are intimately connected. For instance, the Gulf Stream takes warm water from the Gulf of Mexico north to the eastern United States and Europe, generating warm air. On the other side of the world, another current called the Kuroshio carries heat from China north to Japan. ocean currents distributing heat around the planet. The climate we live in is a result of ocean circulation patterns. The reason in the United States that North Carolina and South Carolina are warm is because there is the Gulf Stream. And the reason there's a Gulf Stream really takes root in Antarctica. NARRATOR: As a major engine driving the world's ocean currents, Antarctica helps protect Earth's climate from wild swings in temperature. The constant, dependable circulation of the oceans around the globe and the relatively stable temperatures it produces have made Earth a hospitable planet. Long-term stability provided time for life to flourish and complex animals and plants to evolve. And this is how a process that began with Antarctic ice continues to sustain our world. ABDALATI: When you put it all together, you get a story of how ocean circulation affects climate and weather and what that means today, tomorrow and 20 years out into the future. (rumbling) NARRATOR: But ocean currents and the atmosphere are not the only players. Beneath the sea floor, forces inside the earth are a crucial source for the basic materials that nurture life. This hidden mechanism is driven by ceaseless, often violent activity. Two recent examples: A magnitude nine earthquake strikes Japan in 2011. An entire section of the country moves eight feet towards North America. A year earlier, 2,500 miles to the south in Papua New Guinea, the volcano Rabaul erupts. It fires a vast plume of ash high into the atmosphere. These are catastrophic, hugely destructive events with an enormous cost in human lives. But the natural forces behind these disasters also provide the materials we and other living organisms need to survive. And satellites help show us how this happens. Canada's RADARSAT is one of several satellites that use highly sensitive radar to map the earth's surface in three dimensions. Bouncing radio waves off the terrain below, these satellites continually sweep the surface of the globe. They can measure the height of the earth's surface every day to an accuracy of less than a quarter of an inch. When the data is plotted over time, we can see in fine detail how the earth's crust is constantly moving. This is the surface of the crater atop Mount St. Helens in Washington state. Animation reveals how it swells over the course of three weeks, driven by a surge of molten magma beneath the crater. Satellites can actually see the crustal plates moving now. We can see bulges and dips where the magma is moving around underneath the crust. NARRATOR: This animation shows the swelling of Mount Etna in Italy as magma accumulates beneath it over nine years. When the volcano erupts, the land sinks back. SELLERS: So we're getting a picture now of what the world looks like under the crust and how that affects the other dynamic processes of the so-called solid earth. NARRATOR: Every day, dozens of volcanoes around the world are erupting, while 4,000 earthquakes shake the ground. Our earth is dynamic, constantly ejecting gases and magma from its depths. And some of this activity has a vital impact on life. The secret to understanding how lies deep beneath the ocean's surface. Here, a crucial chemical reaction takes place between molten rock and deep ocean water. The Jason satellite's sea surface-mapping radar reveals a chain of active volcanoes a mile and a half down, at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. This is where that critical interaction between molten rock and freezing water takes place. This footage was taken with a remotely operated submarine, also called Jason. Lava and superheated gases spill out of cracks in the ocean floor, known as hydrothermal vents. Jason reveals what happens when cold ocean water penetrates into the cracks. A magma chamber below heats the water to up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. In the pressure-cooker environment inside the cracks, the dense salty water actually dissolves the solid rock. Complex chemical reactions take place, producing minerals containing sulfur and iron. These are nutrients that living organisms need to survive. The seawater, now loaded with minerals from inside the earth, streams out of the hydrothermal vents. These nutrients feed a thriving ecosystem that includes shrimp and exotic creatures like tubeworms. The deep ocean currents carry the leftover nutrients away. Over thousands of years, they circulate through the oceans, ultimately rising to the surface and contributing to an amazing explosion of life. And we can see this activity with NASA's Aqua satellite, which is equipped with instruments that observe the earth in many wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. One tool is called MODIS. MODIS is pretty much the crown jewel of the Aqua satellite. It's an enormous scanner. So it basically covers the whole world every day. NARRATOR: MODIS scans the ocean in the infrared and the visible portions of the spectrum. It can detect extremely subtle changes in the temperature and color of the water. So what we have in space is an instrument that looks at very, very small parts of the spectrum, and we measure how much light comes back in each part of the spectrum. NARRATOR: Looking down at the west coast of South America, MODIS detects an upwelling of cold water 150 miles west of Peru. Then it detects a particular shade of green. This identifies the source as chlorophyll, a sign of plant life. It's clear that the satellite has spotted a massive bloom of tiny organisms called phytoplankton. Just below the surface, these phytoplankton are absorbing the rich soup of minerals that have come from the deep ocean. And with light from the Sun, and carbon from the carbon dioxide in the air, they multiply by the billions. As MODIS shows, the plankton multiply so quickly that in just 24 hours, 500 square miles of ocean have turned to this distinctive green color. GENE FELDMAN: They replicate very, very fast. So you can have a plankton bloom that doubles over the course of a day and can cover hundreds or thousands of kilometers of the ocean surface. NARRATOR: It's the minerals from beneath the earth's crust that have helped fuel this vast explosion of plankton-- over 800 thousand tons of living material. And that's only the beginning. This plankton is the base of the food chain for marine life. The bloom triggers one of the largest feeding frenzies on earth. Trillions of anchovies and sardines feast on the tiny organisms. They, in turn, attract larger predators to one of the densest concentrations of marine life anywhere. Sharks converge. And even birds, flying above, dive down to join the feast. And up above, humans are here, too, taking advantage of one of the world's most productive fishing grounds. The satellite data reveals similar upwellings all around the world, delivering nutrients, seen here in pink, into the surface waters. Each upwelling triggers a plankton bloom. FELDMAN: Phytoplankton provide that key link between this energy out here, the raw materials that this planet holds and the food engine that allows life to flourish. NARRATOR: These vast green ribbons of plankton can cover as much as a fifth of the world's ocean surfaces, about 45 billion tons of biomass every year. The plankton are one link in a chain of life that begins deep beneath the seafloor. The most important plant life on this planet are these microscopic little green plants that float in the ocean. NARRATOR: Plankton may be key to life, but they themselves don't live long. MODIS shows how, in just 72 hours, a bloom can rapidly weaken and fade. All the plankton that have not been eaten die and sink into the abyss. They take their precious minerals with them all the way back to the ocean floor. Here they will remain for millennia, a thick carpeting of tiny carcasses half a mile deep. Some of the minerals may ultimately be recycled. Some may emerge through hydrothermal vents again, millions of years from now. But some plankton, through yet another extraordinary chain of events, will deliver their precious cargo of nutrients not just to life in the ocean, but also to life on land. Half a world away from the coast of Peru, where plankton bloom, lies the Sahara Desert in North Africa. The Sahara is enormous-- it makes up a tenth of the African continent. It's one of the driest and dustiest places on earth. Surprisingly, the remains of ancient plankton are here, hidden in this arid landscape. It is May, the hottest month of all. Camel herders travel through one of the most exposed regions of the Sahara: the Bodele Depression. Six thousand years ago, this was covered by the world's largest freshwater lake. The floor of the lake is covered with the ancient remains of plankton-- called diatomite-- laid down in a much earlier age, when an ocean covered the region. With its eye on the earth from 400 miles above, NASA's Landsat 7 is one of the latest generation of satellites studying the composition of rocks that make up our planet. It sweeps the Bodele, producing these high resolution pictures in multiple wavelengths of visible light. The white expanse is the diatomite on the bed of the lake. The size of the lake is over a thousand kilometers long and 600 kilometers wide. But with a satellite image, we can see the whole extent of the basin on a series of images and visualize that on a computer in a matter of minutes. NARRATOR: The satellite image analysis shows over 24,000 square miles of sediment, all of it diatomite. We can map where the diatomite sediment is on the floor of the lake. NARRATOR: The diatomite from the plankton is a rich source of phosphorous, an element needed by all living things to produce energy. But for this nutrient to re-enter the chain of life, it must first embark on a long journey that can be seen from space. The journey begins here on the ancient lakebed in the Sahara. The wind sweeps up a few flakes of diatomite into the air. The flakes fracture into a fine powder and are carried off by the wind. A dust storm builds. 22,000 miles above, the European weather satellite Meteosat 8 looks down from its geostationary orbit. It records a daily pulse of dust rising off the Bodele Depression. Here it's visible as a whitish dust cloud lifting from the desert with clockwork regularity at noon each day. BRISTOW: Although the individual particles of dust are minute-- they're hundredths or thousandths of a millimeter in diameter-- there are such vast clouds of this dust that you can see it on satellite images. NARRATOR: The dust cloud is over a hundred stories high and 200 miles wide. From here it will head west on an epic journey. Seen from space, the dust is blown across Africa. At the Atlantic coast, it's drawn up high into the sky. This simulation, based on satellite data, shows how prevailing winds carry the dust cloud west and south 3,000 miles across the Atlantic. As much as 7,000 tons of dust are airborne at any one time. The destination is set by the winds: South America and the Amazon. We're taking literally thousands of tons of this dust, which is containing phosphate, and exporting that from the Bodele. The wind is carrying it out across the Atlantic to fertilize the Amazon. NARRATOR: Here in these clouds high above the rainforest, what was once living plankton reaches the end of its journey. The minerals in the dust, which include energy-giving phosphorous, dissolve into water droplets and fall to the Amazon in rain. BRISTOW: Areas like the Amazon jungle, although they appear very rich, the soils are actually very depleted, they've been leached. And one of the things that they're short on is phosphate. NARRATOR: Rain falls incessantly throughout the Amazon's wet season, delivering thousands of tons of phosphate into the forest below. It passes into the soil and the roots of the trees, nourishing the rain forest. The effect of all this natural fertilizer can be seen clearly from orbit. Terra is the twin of the Aqua satellite. It circles the earth every 99 minutes, monitoring how fast vegetation is growing. SELLERS: We can see all the green vegetation on earth-- wall to wall, every day-- and it tells you almost everything you want to know about the state of life on earth. NARRATOR: With its color scanner, Terra can see the effect of the Sahara dust on the Amazon at the end of the rainy season. It observes an increase in the distinctive green color of chlorophyll. Like the plankton blooms in the ocean, the forest is kicking into overdrive... watered by rain and nourished by the minerals borne across the Atlantic by the dust cloud. For every leaf that exists now, three more will grow in a week. It's the culmination of a chain of events that began far back in time and halfway around the world. SELLERS: Ancient sediments laid down by other organisms millions of years ago get eroded, make dust, the winds bring them across the Atlantic, fertilize the tropical forest in the Amazon. NARRATOR: The migration of Bodele dust to the Amazon is just one of many ways that vital minerals spread to living habitats all over the world. Every landscape has its own story and its own way of entering the chain of life. BRISTOW: The exchange of nutrients from the land is going on all over the globe every day. NARRATOR: And in certain areas, this is what accounts for the special productivity of the soil. The Great Plains of North America are rich in minerals eroded from the Rocky Mountains. These are vital ingredients for growing wheat and corn. In Bangladesh, the Ganges delta is rich in iron washed down from the Himalayas in river sediments, ideal for growing rice. The hidden transport of minerals creates fertile soils that enable plants to thrive. These minerals are the basis of the food chain for all life on land, including us. SELLERS: All of this reminds you how interconnected the earth system is that no living thing lives in isolation from processes that may happen a long way away in both space and time from itself. NARRATOR: Satellites provide a vivid new perspective on the links between land, sea, air and life. This new perspective helps us see how the natural forces of our planet fit together, and that includes the atmosphere and something as basic as the air we breathe. Less than a quarter of the air around us is comprised of oxygen, but that oxygen is essential to life. It's what all animals need to burn fuel in their bodies. Oxygen is vital to metabolism. It provides the energy that allows even the most active creatures to survive and thrive and to master their environments. Scientists believe that the abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere was essential for the evolution of large, intelligent mammals like us. The human brain alone uses about 20% of the oxygen we breathe. But where does all this oxygen come from? Satellites can help us answer that question. NASA's Aura satellite is one of several spacecraft that are helping scientists study the earth's atmosphere. Along with ground instruments, it can analyze the atmosphere and pinpoint its composition. It builds a picture of the nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide that together make up 99% of the air we breathe. This computer visualization shows how the earth's atmosphere changes over 24 hours. During the day, oxygen-- seen here in blue-- rises all over the planet. At night, carbon dioxide-- shown in orange-- is on the rise. And the oxygen we need is given to us by plants. Before plants, there was no oxygen in the atmosphere. So plants did all the hard work of allowing the atmospheric concentration to build up over time, allowing all other life to develop. They made the place habitable for us. NARRATOR: Plants breathe in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. They produce so much that the vast Amazon rainforest is often called the lungs of the earth. But the real picture is more complex. The verdant wilderness of plants and animals is one of the oldest, most abundant living systems on earth. Over two million square miles of lush rainforest teem with half the world's living species. SELLERS: The Amazon is the largest natural preserve of life on the continents that's left in the world. Thousands of miles of almost virgin forest, thousands of species that have been there for an awfully long time. NARRATOR: So dense is the Amazon jungle that it has a dramatic impact on the air above it. It starts in the trillions of leaves far below. We can use animation to show what this invisible process, known as photosynthesis, might look like. During the day, the leaf takes up carbon dioxide from the air, seen here in orange. It converts the carbon into sugar for energy and growth and releases oxygen, seen in blue. Each one of these trees will release hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of oxygen in the course of its life. And as for the Amazon as a whole, a fifth of the world's oxygen is produced here. But there's a surprising twist: we will breathe almost none of it. Satellite data and ground measurements reveal that almost all the oxygen the Amazon produces during the day remains there and is reabsorbed into the forest at night. SELLERS: With the advantage of the satellites, we can now see that the Amazon basically uses all its own oxygen and uses all its own carbon dioxide. It is, as far as we can tell, almost a closed system in itself-- almost. NARRATOR: But the Amazon still plays a vital part in generating the oxygen that we breathe. What satellites now make clear is producing the oxygen that benefits us takes an extra step. The process begins with rain, which falls up to 250 days a year in the Amazon. The soil of the rainforest is continually washed into the Amazon river system, taking with it nutrients and organic material. An average of two million tons of this sediment is released every 24 hours. The sediment flows eastward, traveling 4,000 miles into the Amazon delta. Here, microscopic plankton near the surface thrive on the nutrients and their population explodes. As they spread further out to sea, some of these tiny organisms act like plants, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Again the Aqua satellite shows us how a giant plankton bloom grows to cover 25,000 square miles. This vast area translates into a huge boom in oxygen production, made available to the entire planet. FELDMAN: When plankton grow, they release oxygen. That oxygen ultimately finds its way into the atmosphere. NARRATOR: The massive scale of this impact is revealed when the satellite data is visualized. This animation shows the oxygen produced by plankton blooms, seen here in bright blue. The Amazon plankton bloom releases billions of gallons of oxygen into the atmosphere every day. Within a few days the plankton die, leaving most of the oxygen they produced in the air as they sink to the bottom of the ocean. Similar explosions of microscopic life happen all over the world. Plankton's major role in replenishing oxygen in the atmosphere is something we've only fully grasped with the help of satellites. FELDMAN: Satellites gave us that very first global picture, global assessment of what the ocean's plants were doing. NARRATOR: And what plankton are doing is providing life-giving oxygen for us. FELDMAN: Plankton in the ocean are responsible for over half of the oxygen that we breathe, and it's what most creatures on this planet rely on to survive. NARRATOR: Microscopic organisms as well as rainforests are the lungs of the earth. So what other secrets of life can satellites-- our eyes in space-- reveal? It turns out that another surprising way life is sustained is through a violent force: lightning. From orbit, the whole earth buzzes with electricity. Astronauts are often amazed by the intensity of the electrical storms raging far beneath them. SELLERS: You can see a thousand miles' worth of lightning flashes left and right as you're looking down, and they seem to set each other off like fireworks, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. It's really quite amazing. NARRATOR: But to understand lightning's global impact, we need more than just observation. NASA's TRMM satellite carries a high-speed camera that can detect individual lightning bolts. From this information it's possible to build a picture showing the distribution of lightning all across the globe. Astonishingly, 40 strikes occur every second. That's more than three million strikes a day. So how is all this lightning created? And what is the effect of all this energy streaking through the earth's atmosphere? Each day, the combined force of sunlight and water vapor creates 40,000 thunderclouds. The rising columns of moist air generate powerful updrafts that turn water vapor into ice particles inside the clouds. As ice and water droplets smash into each other at great speed, vast charges of static electricity build up. An average thundercloud contains enough energy to power a city the size of Denver for ten hours. Eventually the charge builds to a point where air molecules are torn apart and a lightning bolt is born. A bolt is no thicker than a human thumb, yet it's five times the temperature of the surface of the sun. As it burns through the atmosphere, the electricity breaks apart the molecules of nitrogen contained in the air. ADAMEC: A lightning stroke, it actually splits the nitrogen into single nitrogen molecules. Nitrogen doesn't like that. It's desperately looking for something to connect back to with and it often does it with oxygen. NARRATOR: When oxygen bonds with nitrogen, it creates a vital nutrient called nitrate. Satellites show the extent of nitrate-- simulated here in yellow-- produced by the more than three million lightning bolts that strike every day. This creates about 13,000 tons of nitrate. It dissolves in water droplets in the clouds and falls to the ground in rain. Most people are familiar with nitrates because they're fertilizers. So when it rains in a thunderstorm, in a way you're getting a free fertilizing, because the water will have nitrates in it. NARRATOR: Nitrate is absorbed through the roots of plants and enters the food chain. When we eat these plants, the nitrates become available to us. And so this vital nutrient enters the cells of every living organism on earth, where it is critical for building the structure of plants and helps make proteins and DNA in our bodies as well. It is essential for the survival of all living things. But nitrate production is not the only way in which lightning promotes life on earth. In the Canadian Yukon, a massive wildfire devastates over ten square miles of forest in less than a week. Such blazes often start with a random bolt of electricity from the sky. In distant Siberia, over 1,500 square miles of forest burn to the ground, sparked by a lightning bolt. These flames may seem purely destructive, but thanks in part to satellites, we see that they can also be life-giving. The Terra satellite can detect the location of every fire on earth by looking at its heat signature in infrared. SELLERS: Terra basically gives us a map of all the fires in all the forests and grasslands of the world every day. NARRATOR: This sped-up visualization of Terra's data shows a year's worth of fire all around the world. The vast swaths of orange are actually thousands of tiny dots. Each one represents a half square mile of land where a fire has burned, over 19 million square miles in total. The Terra data also reveal fire's role in renewing life. SELLERS: The observations have shown us how important fire is as an element of change. NARRATOR: The benefits of change can be witnessed in the forests of northern Canada. This is a vibrant forest, but it has its share of dead and diseased trees. Locked inside them are ingredients that are essential for new life: elements like carbon, sulfur and phosphorous. Yet in a cold environment like this, trees take decades to decompose and return these elements back to the soil. Fire can shorten the cycle to a matter of hours. The pine tree is highly flammable. It's full of sap and resins that burn easily. The oxygen in the atmosphere fuels the flames. ADAMEC: When you're looking at fire, you're looking at a rapid oxidation. That's what fire is. NARRATOR: Within a matter of hours, what may have started as a spark from a single lightning bolt turns acres of forest to flames. The nutrients these trees have stored for so long end up in the ash. Fires also consume the dead animals whose bodies litter the forest, returning the nutrients they contain back to the soil. The smoke climbs into the sky, and the ultimate impact of this nutrient-rich ash can eventually be seen from space. With its infrared sensor, Terra can pick out the heat given off by the leaves of healthy new vegetation that grows after fire. A pulse of new growth follows every blaze. Huge areas of forest get burned down quite regularly and they're followed almost immediately by rapid regrowths. NARRATOR: In forests all over the world, the data from Aqua and Terra show that within months, large areas devastated by fire are rejuvenated. From a global perspective, wildfires are essential to the cycle of life. Fire's like a great blender for all the materials in the earth system, so when you get dead living material, particularly in the forests, fire will rip through there and decompose that stuff very quickly into its basic minerals and compounds that new life can use almost immediately. NARRATOR: Fire is such an intrinsic part of nature that many plants have evolved to make active use of it. The pine tree drops its seeds in the ashen aftermath of a blaze to make the most of the nutrients that have been released. Wildfires are essential to maintaining the health of many of the world's ecosystems. It's a mechanism by which habitats that are no longer productive regenerate. We can now follow this process over decades. SELLERS: When you look 30 years of satellite data, you see this continuous, dynamic rearrangement of the biosphere. The nutrients that that tree has pulled up from the soil are being dropped back down again on the soil to feed the next generation. The effect of all this is to allow the biosphere to turn over far more quickly and efficiently. NARRATOR: By looking at the world from orbit, we see our home planet anew. We discover countless hidden connections, all linked to life. The circulation of weather and ocean currents affects the ebb and flow of ice at the poles. Originating in the earth's crust, erupting magma interacts with cold ocean water, producing nutrients that rise to the surface and nourish aquatic life. Eventually, airborne in dust, nutrients travel around the planet, finally enabling tiny plankton to fill the air with oxygen. That allows complex animals like us to survive. Oxygen also allows fire to burn, which, in turn, accelerates the pace of death and rebirth in the forest. Above all, life's major driver is the energy we receive from the sun. As the earth rotates over 24 hours, the planet responds to the incredible power of the sun, our local star. Each day more than a million terawatts-- over 7,000 times our global energy consumption-- strike earth. This triggers a wave of activity around the globe. At dawn, plants on land and plankton at sea begin to photosynthesize and grow. At the same time, sunlight drives wind and weather around the globe. We are also a part of this cycle, as our bodies respond to the daily inflow of energy from above. Our skin cells use sunlight to create essential vitamins. Even the flight paths of planes reveal our intimate relationship with the rhythms of day and night. Aircraft travel west in the morning to extend the day and east in the evening to reduce the night. But while the sun nurtures all life on earth, it also has the power to destroy. And with the help of a very different kind of satellite, we are coming to understand just how great a threat it can pose. Orbiting 22,000 miles above the earth is the Solar Dynamics Observatory. This satellite looks not at the earth, but away from it. Its task is to observe the radiation released by the sun-- what scientists call space weather. We have this wonderful new satellite that is up in space, looking at the sun 24 hours a day and is providing unprecedented images of the sun and where space weather is born. NARRATOR: These striking images are produced by the SDO's ultraviolet sensor, detecting light frequencies beyond the blue end of the visible spectrum. The sun emits constant light, heat and other forms of radiation, along with A toast to the Brotherhood. To the Brotherhood. All right, Bloodthirsty Dave. Now, you tell us how you did it. Mr. Botts, I'm scared. Don't be, lad. Remember what it means to our crew aboard ship. Make it good. Well, sir, the Governor's men outnumbered us four to one, but I fought like a demon. A thrust, a feint, a slash and a cut. Four men lay mortally stricken on the deck. Then four more came at me. A thrust, a feint, a slash and a cut. Now eight men were lying around me. Why, I was up to my knees in bodies. Then, as I was coming down the companionway, the ship's captain, powerful swordsman, bears down on me. Slash! I cut off his right arm. Slash! I cut off his left arm. Slash! Slash! I cut off his head. Quickly, the captain picked his head up from the deck and ran for his cabin. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you cut off both of his arms, how could he pick up his head? He picked it up with his teeth. Oh. Well, I fought my way closer and closer to Governor Elden. My eyes watering, my nostrils burning with the smell of smoke. If you were fighting a sword battle, where did the smoke come from? Why, it was a hot battle. Then suddenly... Suddenly I was surrounded by six men, no five. The Governor's personal guard. My blade flashed in the sunlight. A thrust, a parry and a feint. Then a feint and a hack! Then a hack and a head! Then two hacks and two heads. A double-header. Then I move... Let go of me. Now, nobody stood between me and the Governor expect a small sailor. I pointed my blade at his heart and I cried, "Coward, yield.' ' And the cowardly dog yielded. Well, sir, that's the end of my tale. Captain Morgan. Captain Bonney? I say it's a bold man who'd dare attack the Governor of the Carolinas with one vessel. I move we vote Bloodthirsty Dave into the Brotherhood. Well, strip me if Mistress Bonney hasn't taken a fancy to this bag of bones. You got me wrong, Captain Avery. It's just that, well, if I'd married instead of taking to the sea when I did, I might have had a son of me own, ready to take his place in the Brotherhood as a first-class pirate. A real credit to his poor old mother. His poor old mother, indeed. Are you sure you're not giving up the robbing of ships for the robbing of cradles? Why, you weak-livered, soft-shelled turtle! I'll carve the skin from your flesh and the flesh from your bones! Stop it, Ben Avery! You both know the Brotherhood rules, there'll be no fighting amongst the captains. Captain Morgan. Captain Kidd. I've a question, Henry. Aye. This lad talks big, but how do we know that he has any courage? I propose that Blackbeard puts Bloodthirsty Dave to the test. Aye. We have our own way of testing a man's mettle. Take one end. You place your end of the handkerchief between your teeth. Blackbeard will do likewise. Oh, a game. Aye, a game. The man who first releases his hold is the loser. I see. Oh, thank you. You mean we try to cut each other? Aye. Well, couldn't we use a tablecloth or a bed sheet? A handkerchief makes it more interesting. Oh, it does. Well, look, sir. Where I come from, we have our own way of testing a man's mettle. I'll stand up to you unarmed, you stand on one end of this handkerchief and I'll stand on the other, and you won't be able to touch me with your cutlass. You're to stand on one end of the handkerchief? Yes. And I'm to stand on the other? That's right. And then you slam the door in my face. Yeah. We'll test you our way. I forgot, I have to go dry out my sails. Put that handkerchief in your mouth. Go! He tricked me! I'll... Easy, Captain. He bested you fair and square. 'Tis is my ruling you both shake hands. That's what I like. A man of courage. Come on, come on back here now, will you, Bloodthirsty? Now, pull up a stool and come on and sit down beside me. You and me'll get along, Bloodthirsty. Oh, thank you, miss... Missus... Madam... Captain. You're my type of man. Course, you could stand a little more meat on you. It's just that I haven't been eating well, lately. We can have some gay times, if you know what I mean. And I'm sure you know what I mean, if you know what I mean. Yes, I... I know what you mean. A messenger from the colonies. Show him in. Greetings to the Brotherhood from your friend in the colonies. Ah, a welcome visitor. Come, bring your message. Who is he? His name is Giles. Giles. Giles. My master sends you the usual list of all sailings to and from England. Hey, it seems I've heard his name before. We know nothing about him. All we know is his master keeps us well posted, well protected, and his money is good. A likely list. Thank our friend in the colonies. We shall plan how and when to sail and also to divide the loot equally. He begs me to remind you that he still stands ready to take all plunder off your hands at generous prices. Generous prices? Why, the prices he pays us, he's a... He's a worse pirate than... Than the lot of us. At present, your friend is particularly interested in a gown. A wedding gown, one without equal, one that would befit a princess. I've just such a gown as you mention. You may have heard how I took prisoner the daughter of the Grand Mughal on the Indian Ocean? Everyone has heard of that, Captain Avery. Well, she had one gown as white as milk, weighted with pearls almost beyond count, and on it is a crescent and star. And the crescent is fashioned of emeralds and the star of rubies. It will cost you a king's ransom. In this instance, cost is of no importance. Then come. Let me show it to you. You know who's gonna wear that wedding gown? Well, it will be for a woman, naturally. it wouldn't do for a man. But on that Ann Bonney... Mr. Botts, I've just recalled where l heard that man's name. It was on the Southern Gypsy. That means the bride-to-be is Lady Sylvia. Well, Governor or no Governor, she can't marry a criminal. I've got to get back to Charleston and warn her. Careful, lad. Yeah. Captain Morgan, will you permit me to address the Brotherhood? Aye. I understand none of you know the identity of your friend in the colonies. Well, I can tell you who he is. He's none other than Governor Elden of the Carolinas. What? Are you sure? Positive. Only a few days ago, I heard the bride-to-be tell Governor Elden to have Mr. Giles order her wedding gown. Perhaps the members the Brotherhood aren't aware of it, but Governor Elden is one of the wealthiest men in the colonies. And why? Because he sells your goods at fabulous prices. He pays us no such fabulous prices. Aye, that's because you're a pack of weaklings and fools. Mind your manner of speech, Bloodthirsty Dave. Bloodthirsty speaks the truth. We take all the risk of life and limb and our friend gets the lion's share of the plunder. What're you driving at, Bloodthirsty Dave? Since Governor Elden possesses enough wealth to make it worth the effort, I propose we combine our fleets and attack Charleston. You must be out of your mind, man. We'd not stand a chance. The guns of the fort would blast us before we entered the harbor. If we were crazy enough to listen to you, who would lead such a bold venture? Well, I would. And what portion of the loot would you demand as leader? Oh, I want none of the loot. I just don't want Lady Sylvia to marry Governor Elden. Well, sink me. I suspected the lad was addled, but now I see the cause of it. He's in love with the Governor's wench! Whatever his purpose, the boldness of the plan pleases my fancy. I say we put it to a vote. All those in favor of attacking Charleston with our combined fleets, signify in the usual way. I'm sorry, Bloodthirsty. I seem to be the only one that's with you. Well, thanks for trying, Miss Bonney. Aw, forget the lass and stick with me. I can promise you smooth waters with pieces of eight to larboard and dollars and doubloons to starboard. Well, thanks, Captain Bonney, but if none will join me, I'm sailing back to Charleston alone. Come, Mr. Botts. By Judas, you weak-livered cowards. Here stands a man. Come, Mr. Botts. Aye. Sir Reginald and Lady Parker. Delighted you could come, Sir Reginald. Only his Majesty's business could have kept us in the Virginias, Your Excellency. Lord and Lady Montrose, may I present Sir Reginald and Lady Parker. And this is Lady Sylvia. Lady Sylvia, my dear, I'm sure that tomorrow you'll be the loveliest bride ever seen in the Carolinas. You're very kind, Lady Parker. Sir Geoffrey Merriweather. Mr. and Mrs. Silas Higgins. I beg your pardon. Uh, Miss... I beg your pardon. Lord and Lady Fallbrook. Ah, your Excellency, so good to see you again. So glad you could come, Mr... Sir... Oh, come, come, you old rascal. Don't tell me you've forgotten your old friend Sir Geoffrey Merriweather. Of course, Sir Geoffrey. Yes. May I present... Oh, yes, the lovely little bride. Charming, yes. Utterly, utterly charming. You're to be congratulated, sir. You make a well-matched couple. Sir Geoffrey, that is Lady Montrose. Hm? Yes. This is Lady Sylvia. Oh, yes, of course. How stupid of me. What? Well, well, well! You are to be congratulated, old man. Old man, it's just a figure of speech, of course. No reference to age, old chap. A minuet. May I have the honor, Lady Sylvia? Oh, I'm sorry, Sir Geoffrey. I promised the first minuet to Governor Elden. Oh, piffle, posh and piffle. You can dance with him after you're married. Now, come child. Oh, but I... Oh, yes, thank you very much. Who is that weird creature? Sir Geoffrey Merriweather. I imagine he's newly arrived from England. Merriweather? Never heard of him. Come to think of it, neither have I. Excuse me. Mr. Giles, that man with Lady Sylvia, keep your eye on him. Yes, Your Excellency. His Excellency must be a jealous old bird. He hasn't taken his eyes off you once. Can't say that I blame the old boy. I have a favor to ask of you, Lady Sylvia. A favor of me? I must ask you to control yourself and not to cry out. It's me, David. Why do you come here? I've got to talk to you, it's important. It's impossible. I'm gambling my life for one minute of your time. You've got to give it to me. Very well, in the library, after the next dance. I got away for only a moment. Thanks for trusting me. Lady Sylvia, you mustn't marry Governor Elden. is that what you came to tell me? I fear you're overstepping yourself, Mr. Pirate. Listen to me, I've been in Tortuga with the pirate captains. 'Tis Governor Elden himself who arranges the raids on English ships and then disposes of the loot. You're lying. 'Tis the truth, I swear it. I don't believe you. You've got to believe me. Only a pirate could dream up such a fantastic story. Now, please, will you let me go or must I call the guard? If I could only convince you. Wait. Wait. Have you received your bridal gown yet? Why, yes. Has anyone seen it? Only my seamstress. It arrived from England three days ago. Ah. From England? Shall I describe it to you? White as milk, weighted with pearls almost beyond count, and on it is a crescent and star. The crescent fashioned of emeralds and the star of rubies. At least that's the way Longben Avery described it. Longben Avery? The pirate? Aye, the pirate. He took your wedding gown from the daughter of the Grand Mughal when he held her for ransom. Then everything you said is true. On my life. I don't know what to say. Oh, Davey, I'm frightened. Don't worry. Once we get out of here, you'll be perfectly safe. But where could we go? Well, my ship the Defiance is anchored at Pinetree Cove. By sunup, we could be miles at sea. Oh, Davey. They're in there, Your Excellency. Have the guards stand by. I want the entire house searched. Oh, yes, indeed, Lady Sylvia. A fascinating old place, fascinating. Oh, there you are old chap. Lady Sylvia was just showing me the library. You're quite lucky, you know. I'm just beginning to realize how lucky l am. Sir Geoffrey... Merriweather. Yes, of course. Oh, yes. Well, Lady Sylvia and I... Uh, Lady... Now, come, come, old boy. Let's not have a fuss over a few split hairs. Arrest him. Now, now, control yourself. Let's be gentlemen about this thing. Now, really, I... Guards, guards! Parry. Thrust. Parry. Thrust. Feint. Parry. Thrust. Feint! Lady Sylvia! The lady's fainted. Get some water, quick! Don't worry, darling. I'll return. Take him away. Giles, see that he's put in the dungeon. What are you going to do to him? Nothing much, my dear. Merely hang him. It's very thoughtful of you both to bring me such a delightful wedding present. Tomorrow, my dear, at the very moment you and I become one, your friend Bloodthirsty Dave will dance for us on the gallows. And now, Lady Sylvia, I believe our guests are waiting. Well, gentlemen, what do you say? I say we go ashore and storm the prison. Aye. We'll take him by force. I like your loyalty, men. But there's little sense in trying the impossible. We'd only be going to our deaths without accomplishing anything. We were as good as dead anyway if it hadn't been for the help of Captain Dave. That's the truth. Have you forgotten the plans he had for all of you to pick up your families and go to some island where you could start afresh? He'd not be wanting you to forget all that now. But you can't let him die. There's nothing to be done, Lady Sylvia. We've only the one ship, and it'll take a whole fleet to get past the guns of that harbor. Aye, if only the Brotherhood in Tortuga had voted to come along. It could've been easy. Then there's nothing left but to see him once more and bid him farewell. I'm sure it would cheer his last hours to know that you really love him, Lady Sylvia. How do you propose getting in to see him? The gems on this miniature are very valuable. They should open the gates to any prison. One of our men will row you ashore. Bullock. Oh, wait. Lady Sylvia, if I remember rightly, you painted this miniature yourself. Why, yes. I have a plan, a wild plan, but it may work. By Judas, we will have a fleet. We'll have the biggest fleet that ever sailed into Charleston harbor, with your help. I don't think it'll work. But Mr. Botts thinks it will. Well, even if it doesn't, I'll keep remembering how you risked everything to come here. And when I climb those 13 steps and they slip the mask over my eyes, and when I feel the noose start to tighten... Davey, don't talk like that. It's got to work. But if it doesn't, I'll not come back to Charleston. There'll be no wedding to Governor Elden or anyone else. Ever. You'd best go now. But don't worry. I'll put it over. Even if I hang for it. Hang? It's your time for hanging, Bloodthirsty Dave. They're coming for you. Unlock the door. Where is she? She? Lady Sylvia, she's disappeared. Has she, now? On your feet when you speak to His Excellency. You were not quite so bold, Mr. Giles, when I last saw you in Tortuga. She stole out of the house last night at a late hour and didn't return. Well, you're welcome to search my cell, Your Excellency. You know where she is. Do I? I have a proposition, tell me where she is and I promise you safe conduct out of the Carolinas. Even we pirates have a sense of honor, Your Excellency. You should know about pirates, if not about honor. Not yet. Our Spanish friends have taught me a few ways of loosening a man's tongue. Aye. The thumbscrew and the rack may get him to sing a different tune. Wait, I'll make the proposition. I'll give you the information you seek on one condition. First, you sign this document. Document? Yes. lt was brought to me last night by a very charming visitor. Lady Sylvia. Aye. Read it carefully, Governor Elden. 'Tis your resignation from office and a full confessión of your dealings with the pirates. He's gone daft. And I promise you that Lady Sylvia will be delighted to make a second visit here for your hanging. Oh, enough of this nonsense. Take him to the rack. Wait, you heard that cannon shot. Do you know what it means? What it's always meant. A ship is coming into the harbor. Not a ship, Governor Elden, but a fleet. An entire fleet. There, take a look for yourself. Mr. Giles, it can't be. There's no fleet in these waters. Who are they? Where do they come from? From Tortuga. Out there are the combined fleets of Henry Morgan, Captain Kidd, Blackbeard, Ann Bonney and the rest of your friends in the Brotherhood, but your friends no longer! They've come to blast Charleston off the face of the Earth. They wouldn't dare. Well, you know, those cutthroats would dare anything. I heard what Morgan did at Panama. They'll murder every one of us. Of course. You stop them. Certainly, after you sign this paper. Well, can't we make a deal? I'm a wealthy man. Your freedom and a fortune. Sign! Half of everything I possess. Lady Sylvia, anything. Hey, they're almost around the point. Once they can train their guns on us, they'll level the town. The streets will run with blood. They'll kill and they'll torture. And after the way you've dealt with them, you know what little mercy to expect. Why, in a moment it may be too late. Sign! Now, I must get outside to signal the fleet. Guard, guard. Escort this man through the front gates. And for heaven sakes, hurry. Yes, I will. You can be sure I will. Right to Lord Montrose. Lord Montrose? Why, that confessión will hang me. On the other hand, the pirates will murder me. Your Excellency, if we hurry, we can pack your valuables and escape on horseback overland. Good thought. See where the fleet is now. Why, Your Excellency, there's no fleet out there. Of course there isn't. We've been tricked. It's painted on. We must stop him before he gets to Lord Montrose aboard the liverpool Queen. Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! After him. A thousand pounds to the man who brings back Bloodthirsty Dave. No sign of him in there. Anything to report? No, Captain. Nary a sign of the pirate or his men, sir. Keep a sharp lookout. We've turned Charleston inside out for Bloodthirsty Dave. If you ask me, he's a hundred miles out to sea by now. I guess we better keep looking. The coast is clear, Davey. Under the cover of darkness, you can take the confessión to Lord Montrose on the liverpool Queen. Once he sees this, we'll have nothing to worry about. Lord Montrose? Come in. Lord Montrose, forgive this intrusión, but I... I've been expecting you, Mr. Crandall. Governor Elden. I don't know this is all about, Governor Elden, but you won't get away with it. I believe I will. Oh, if you're thinking of shouting for help, it'll do no good. I've sent the King's men to the hills to search for Bloodthirsty Dave. The local guards are my own men and very loyal. Your crew went overboard. I don't wish to keep His Lordship in the dark any longer. I believe you have a communication for him. Give it to him. I think it should prove interesting reading. When His Majesty hears of this, you'll hang. On the contrary, I shall expect to be commended. Poor Lord Montrose murdered by the black pirate, Bloodthirsty Dave, who in turn was killed by Governor Elden while courageously defending Your Lordship. You're mad. Oh, no, no, let's just say desperate. I've too much at stake. Besides, it's all very simple. A bullet through your heart, a blade through his. This I shall also destroy. Run him through. Hold fast, Davey. We're here to help you. Board her, lads! Board her! Board the liverpool Queen! Board her, lads! Give me that confessión! Give me that confessión! Come on, you sea rats! Glory be! The Brotherhood! Why you... Give me that confessión! You'll not get it from me. Ann! I'll be right back. Let me have him. Be right back. Give it to me! Come on, get up. We got work to do. Cease fighting! Where's Davey? There he is! Hold on, Davey! Davey! All right, Governor Elden. Give yourself up. Now, please Governor Elden. Give yourself up. No! Oh, thank you, Miss Bonney. Take a look, all of you. Here stands a man. Excuse me. You'll have to go to another tavern. The Brotherhood's meeting. Open up for Captain Bloodthirsty Dave. Bloodthirsty Dave? A thousand pardons! Go right in, sir. But who are you? Have you ever heard of Captain Ann Bonney? Of course. You are looking at the man who is going to be Mister Captain Ann Bonney. ...and with only three ships! Well, strike me if it ain't Mr. and Mrs. Bloodthirsty Dave. Your servant, lovely lady. You're a sight for my old eye, Bloodthirsty. Bloodthirsty, what brings you to Tortuga? Well, I bring greetings from your friend in the colonies, Lord Montrose. He sends each of you a gift from His Majesty. A complete and full pardon for one and all. A pardon? Well, now we can be respectable. An honest life could be interesting. I could be an honest man. We could even go to church. We could be loyal to the King. And I could open up an honest business. Well, what will I do? You... You could buy a little house for me and take care of it. But I can't cook. I can. Oh, Davey, you're so wonderful. From now on, there won't be a pirate ship on the open seas. Well, now I have a very important message... Captain Morgan! Yes. Captain Morgan, we've just sighted a Spanish ship three miles offshore loaded with goods and gold. You're coming with me! Davey, Davey, are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. How do you like that? They didn't even say goodbye. And after all those pardons I got for them. Davey, did Lord Montrose ever write a pardon for you? Well, come to think of it, he never did. Why, I'm still a pirate! Hey, fellas, wait for me. Davey, what about me? Well, you get your own knife. Davey, no, no, you're coming home with me. I'm sorry, honey. (I Love Lucy theme music plays) (theme song ending) Oh, boy, I ate too much. Me, too. I can hardly move. They make quite a picture, don't they, Lucy? Yeah- - Porky and Fatso taking it easy. Please, now, please. No nagging on a full stomach. Besides, it's your own fault. You put too much food on the table. You didn't have to eat everything in sight. I only ate 12 oysters. 16, But who counts? Fred, did you really eat 16 oysters? You heard what the oyster counter said. But I was doing it for you. I was trying to find you a pearl. Well, don't pick on him. Ricky ate more oysters than all of us put together. Naturally. LUCY: What do you mean, naturally? Because I got more Rs in my name than anyone else. Anyhow, the way you gals were shoveling in that food, I thought you were using a conveyor belt. Can't help it, eating's my hobby. Yeah, you ought to watch that, Ethel. 'Course, it doesn't matter what I eat because it doesn't go to fat. Where does it go to, thin? For your information, loverboy, I weigh exactly the same as I did when we were married. Ha! Well, I do. Oh, come now, Lucy. Ethel and Fred and I have all admitted that we're getting a little fat. A little, uh, puffy, perhaps. Now, why don't you break down and admit it, too? Well, I'd be very happy to join your tubby little trio if it were true, but it isn't. Oh, Lucy, you're among friends. Let's be honest. I am honest! When Ricky and I were married, I weighed 110, and I weigh exactly that right now. We shall see. Now, don't bother getting those bathroom scales-- they're broken. I fixed them this morning. Oh. Anyway, I'm getting a little bored with this discussion. - Aren't you? - No. Oh, whose side are you on anyway? I'm on the side of Ricky and his puffy pal. Okay, on the scales, champ. This I got to see. - Come on, on the scales. - No! - You're the one... - Come on, on the scales. Oh, now, Ricky. On the scales. All right. How much do I weigh? 45 pounds, and stop leaning on us. Okay. 132? ! On behalf of our tubby trio, I welcome you to our flabby foursome. Well, now that that's over with. What are we going to do tonight? I don't know what you're going to do but I'm going out and kill myself. Oh, honey, so you gained a little weight. Is that so terrible? A little weight? I walked into this room weighing 110. I now weigh 132. That's 22 pounds in ten minutes. Aw, Lucy, don't cry about it. What if I cried every time I gained a pound? We'd be up to our ears in tears. Never mind, Fred. I'm nothing but a big, bloated bunch of blubber. Oh, honey, now don't talk that way. I wouldn't want you any different than you are just now. You wouldn't? No- - I like you plump. (wailing) I... I didn't mean it like that. I mean, you look swell! I'm not worried about you, but how am I going to look on the stage? - The stage? - Yes. Oh, no, you're not going to start that again, are you? Oh, I know. You don't want me in show business, but someday, in spite of you, opportunity will knock and what'll happen? I'll be so big and fat, I won't be able to get up and open the door. -(phone rings) - Oh, honey, forget it. You look wonderful. (phone rings) Hello? Hi, Jerry. What? Oh, this is a fine time. What am I supposed to do-- dance by myself? Okay, okay. Well, look, try to get some girls lined up and we'll have auditions in the morning. Good-bye. Oh, hello, Jerry? Hello... Listen, Jerry, what was the size of the new costume you just bought for Joanne? Well, get girls that size. Good-bye. What's the matter, Ricky? Joanne is quitting. Who's Joanne? Oh, that's terrible. Who's Joanne? At a time like this, too. Who's Joanne? Why did she quit? Who's Joanne? She's getting married. Who's Joanne? She's the girl that dances with Ricky. Now, what was I doing wrong? Now I got to find a girl who can sing and dance and teach her the number by Saturday night. (humming a merry tune) I can't think of a soul. Lucy, will you stop that racket and let me think? What are you so fidgety about? Your girdle too tight? No, I was just about to suggest that in this very room, there's a very pretty and talented young lady who is a wonderful singer and dancer. Who? Ethel? Who? Ethel? No, not her-- me. Oh. Oh, Ricky, this is a wonderful chance for me. I know the number. I can take Joanne's place. Please? No, that's out of the question. Give me one good reason. Well, you're... You're too fat. - Fat? ! - You said so yourself. Plump maybe, but not fat. Come on, Fred, we'd better go. No, let's stay and see the fun. Then you won't have to hang out the bathroom window to hear what they're saying. Come on. No, now you two stay right there. I want you for witnesses. Ricky Ricardo, I'm asking you to give me the same chance you would give anyone else. Let me come down and audition for you just as if I were a stranger. You can forget you ever knew me. That's a very tempting offer. Oh, can I audition for you, Ricky? Can I? All right, all right. You can come down and audition in the morning. Good! Fred and Ethel, now, you heard that. You're witnesses. Yeah, but it's gonna be strictly business. I never saw you before in my life. Okay, Lucy? Lucy? I beg your pardon. Have we been introduced? (playing piano) Pardon me, but is this where Ricky Ricardo is auditioning girls for the dance? Yeah, honey, but if I had known he wanted older women, I'd have brought my mother. Don't pay any attention to her, honey. I guess we're all auditioning for the same part, huh? Can I give you a tip? Oh, yes. I've known Ricky Ricardo for a long time. Oh? You're not his type. Hi, Marco. Hi, girls. Sorry to keep you waiting. Good morning, Mr. Ricardo. Good morning, Mr. Ricardo. Now, let's all line up here, please. Let's all line up. We might as well get started. Let's see what you can... See what you can do. We'll, uh... we'll start with a time step. All right, Marco, go ahead. (piano plays) That's fine, that's fine. That's enough for now. That's enough for now. That's fine. All right, girls. That's fine. Now, um..., you're all size 12, aren't you? DANCERS: Yes. Uh... yeah. Well, that's good because whoever gets the job has to wear this size-12 costume. Now, uh... Miss... Uh...? Uh, MacGillicuddy. MacGillicuddy. Over here, please. Yes, sir. Now, take this costume into the dressing room and put it on, and then we'll see what you can do with the number. Yes, sir, thank you. All right. Miss Macgoullucuddy, uh... how are you coming along? (strained voice): Oh, I've almost got the costume on. Well, hurry up. We're waiting. I'll be right there. All I have to do is fasten it. We're waiting. Just this one last... (groans) (fabric ripping) Oh! What happened? It was a very small size 12. Mira Io que lo hizo al vestido. Mira lo que le paso el vestido. Me dijo que tenia un size 12 y se lo puso, y lo rompio todo para que se puso el vestido si sabia que no iba a caber, senora? Gracias. Now I got to get a new costume. Oh, no, you don't, Mr. Ricardo. It's only split in the seams. I can sew it up myself. Now, look, never mind. Just take it off and leave it in the dressing room and don't call us, we'll call you. - Oh, but Mr. Ricardo... - What? If I get thin enough to fit the dress, can I have the part? Look, the number goes in by Saturday. You couldn't possibly get thin enough by then. But if I can, can I? All right, all right. Now, good-bye, good-bye. You heard him, Ethel. If I get thin enough to fit the dress, I can have the part. Do you really think you can take off 12 pounds in four days? I'm going to get rid of this fat if I have to chop it off with a cleaver. If I have to chop it off with a cleaver. (running footsteps) Hey, wait! That was the last lap. Oh, that's great. You did that in two-and-a-half minutes flat. You now hold the national indoor record for the around-the- fourth-floor dash. You've done good work. You deserve a rest period. Thanks. Okay, time's up. Now, you have time to jump this rope 500 times before the boys come home for dinner. Two hundred? One hundred? Well, do as many as you can. Uh... one! Uh... two! Uh... higher! Oh, you poor little thing. You've worked very hard. Let's weigh you in. Come on. (grunts) Stiffen up, Lucy. (gasps) Another five ounces. In three days, you've lost almost two pounds. Keen. Oh, don't get discouraged. Only ten pounds more to go. We'll get you into size 12. Yeah, a size-12 shroud. Now, take a shower and clean up. I'll get dinner. Dinner? Okay. What's the matter? I can't seem to move. Could you point me in the right direction? Thanks. Here you are, Ricky. Oh, thank you. Here you are, Fred, a nice juicy steak. Oh, I love steak. I hope you don't mind us bringing Butch along? Not at all. If he behaves himself, we'll give him the bone. Oh, he's a good dog. Best dog in the... Here you are, Lucy. Oh, no, that's yours. How's your steak, Fred? Perfect-- just the way I like it. Is your steak all right, Ricky? Oh, delicious. How's yours? - Fine, nice and tender. - Good. How's your celery, Lucy? Oh, delicious, thanks. Is it cooked enough for you? Oh, yes, just the way I like it, nice and tender. Will you pass the potatoes, Rick? Sure thing, here you go. Thanks. Oh, could I have a biscuit, Fred? Sure, you can have a biscuit. Excuse me. Thank you. Want a biscuit, Ricky? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Hey, Fred, could I have the potatoes back, please? Sure, you may. Thank you, Fred. You know, I'm forgetting about poor, old Butch. Hey, yeah, don't forget about him. I'm going to give him a nice, juicy piece of this steak. - Do you mind? - Go ahead. Come on, Butch. Sit up there, boy. There you are. Sit up now. There you go. You going to thank me? Huh? Well, I can't stand anymore. I'll be back later. ETHEL: Ah! Stay out of the kitchen. FRED: How about another biscuit, Ethel? ETHEL: Uh-huh. There you are. RICKY: Hey, Fred, string beans? FRED: Sure, these are good for you. Full of iron. ETHEL: There you are, Ricky. RICKY: Thank you. Hey, I didn't give Butch anything. Here you are, Butch. Aren't you going to thank me? Nice Butch, nice Butch. (Lucy growls and barks) Who's under there? RICKY: Who's under the table? Nobody here but us dogs. Lucy. Come out from under the table. Now, what do you got to say for yourself? (barks) Lucy. All right, you don't have to get nasty about it, I'm leaving. Where are you going? I'm going down to the corner bakery and smell the bread. Okay, Lucy, let's get started on our road work for the day. What's that? A human pressure cooker. Where'd you get it? I rented it. You really are determined, aren't you? Of course- - I'm going to do that number with Ricky tonight. Did you lose enough weight? I've got five more pounds to lose and five hours to do it in. This is my last day. If you spend five hours in that it really will be your last day. Well, it's my only chance, Ethel. Okay, I only hope you know what you're doing. I do. Check me at 6:00 tonight. You're not really going to spend all that time in there? I certainly am. All right. They'll have to pick you up with a blotter. Okay, honey, it's 6:00. How are you doing? Lucy! Where are you? Lucy! Lucy. Is this all that's left? Practically. Oh, Lucy, you gave me an awful fright. Thank heavens you're here. I'm here all right. 120 pounds of me. You did it. I'm going down to the club and do that number. What about that other girl Ricky hired? I'll take care of her somehow. Do you really think you can make it? Oh, don't worry. I'm as strong as... as a very weak horse but I'll make it.

You're suffering from malnutrition. Ew... (I Love Lucy theme music plays) Yes, sir. That's it. The Overland Mail. San Francisco to St. Louis in 25 days. 2,700 miles in 25 days and 25 nights— when the weather and Injuns behave. A lot farther and longer when they didn't. People said it couldn't be done. They laughed, called it the Jackass Mail. But when mail and passengers and gold... began coming through from California day in, day out... the whole country sat up and took notice. San Francisco to St. Louis: The shortest, fastest, "backbreakingest"ride you could buy for $200 gold... meals included. Yes, sir. That's it. TheJackass Mail. This is the relay station at Rawhide Pass— one of many strung along the 2,700-mile route. Here, while a fresh team of mules was hitched to the stage... the driver and passengers could wash, have some food... and go on to the next station many miles away. Doggone it, Tom. It ain't been no picnic for me neither. I'm just gettin' mule skinner wages... and that don't include no bonus for learning you the business. I've knowed your old man for 40 years. There weren't nothin' too tough for him. That's why when he cracks the whip, men and mules just lay back their ears and take orders. Why, if any man was to talk to him the way I'm talking to you... he'd poke both fists right in their whiskers. Well, can't you even talk back? Hey. The trouble with you is y- you just don't listen. Here I've been trying for five, six months to learn you the business... and you're—you're still shaving, taking a bath. Well, it's no wonder them mules don't take to you kindly. See here. What's your old man gonna think of me... if I send you back lookin'just as much of a dude as when you first come out here? Well, doggone it! Can't you say something? Yeah, Sam. Bugle's blowing. That's the trouble. You get me so riled up I can't even attend to business. Try 'em again, Billy. Now do it like I learnt ya. Then come out and help me with them mules. Get! Hyah! - Whoa! - Hello. You still here in this center of civilization, Tom? I won't be much longer, Mr. Scott. I finally got my pardon. - So you're going back east, huh? - Yes, sir. - When? - One week. He hasn't half learned the business yet. What's the baby's name, Mrs. Holt? - Callie. - Callie? I never heard that name before. Short for California, Sam. Born there, wasn't she? - Placerville. - In a mining camp? - That's right. - Poor little thing. - That's tough. - It's tough to be born anywhere. Little more coffee, Mrs. Holt? No, thank you. And please stop calling me Mrs. Holt. I'm "Miss." - Miss Holt? - Yes. Have a little more coffee, Mr. Slade? Coffee? This stuff tastes like burnt corn boiled in branch water. Well, could be. We don't run no fancy hotel here. You couldn't get it down with a swig of whiskey. Back wherever you came from I'll bet you were glad to get a drink out of a sluice box. But it didn't cost $200 in gold, it didn't. That's the price of the stage ticket, Mr. Slade. - The company throws the food in extra. - You call this food? Mule boy here seems to like it. Mule boy doesn't. But it's eat or starve, so I— I eat. Just wait till I get back to Missouri. I'm a-gonna take it up with the fella and raise hob with him... whoever's runnin' this here company. Looks like trouble for old J.C. J.C. Can take care of any trouble that comes his way. - Who's J.C.? - J.C. Owens. It's his father, superintendent of the eastern division. I'll give you his address in St. Joe if you'll throw in a couple of complaints from me. - Hyah! - Well, see you in St. Joe, Mr. Scott! - You just pull in from the west? - Half hour ago. - You didn't by any chance see four men on the road? - Nope. - Who you looking for, Lieutenant? - Fella named Zimmerman. Rafe Zimmerman? - Yeah. - I thought they had him in prison over at Huntsville. He broke out— the day before he was due to get hung. Him and three others. - You didn't see 'em, did you, Todd? - No. And I don't want to neither. Figure they crossed over into Mexico? No, they're after gold. Lots of it. Found that out at La Mesilla, where they held upJohnny Madden's stage. - Well, Johnny drove through here just yesterday. - That's right. - Do much damage? - Plenty. Killed Johnny Madden. - Johnny Madden killed? - Johnny? Yeah. We're here to give you escort... as far as La Mesilla, if you're ready to go. I'm ready to go all right, but I got a responsibility: My passengers. - You and little Callie will have to stay here, Miss Holt. - Why? - Company rule. - That's right, ma'am. Company rule, my foot. I paid my fare. It took all the money I could scrape up. I won't do it. I'm sorry. It's a company rule not to risk the lives of children. If you're bent on going, I can't stop you... but you'll have to leave the baby behind. That's one responsibility I'm not allowed to take. Leave Callie behind? Jibber-jabber. That's up to you, ma'am. Here, you. Take her things. - He'll do nothing of the kind. I'm not staying here. - Go on. Hurry it up. Afraid you are, ma'am. Company rules. Leave these things alone! You leave me and my things alone! I'm going in this stagecoach, and the baby's going with me! - Stop her, Tom. - Just try and stop me! - I said stop her, Tom! - How? - Well, grab her. Doggone it. Grab her. - Let me go! Take your hands off me! I've got to get to St. Louis! - Let me go! I've got to get on that stagecoach. - Come on. Hurry up. Take your hands off me! Let me go! You fool! You'll make me lose my job! - Hurry up, Gil! Get 'em on out! - Let me go! I hope you're happy with what you've done. - I'm sorry I hurt your arm. - Thanks for not breaking it. Don't blame me, ma'am. I'm only a hired hand here. You'll only lose one day, ma'am. You can go in on the stage tomorrow. Tom, you take her things inside, and I'll look after the mules. Take it easy. That's everything I own. - What are you doing? - I'm taking this room. - I'm sorry. This is mine. - Not tonight it isn't. What are you afraid of? Coyotes? Yeah. The kind with boots on. Wait a minute. Is there someplace around here I can take a bath? - Yeah. The pitcher's full. - I said bath. Come on. You see that? That what? That "what"that Sam is pumping water into. That's a horse trough. Well, just don't use any soap. The animals don't like it. Is that where you take a bath? - No. - Don't you ever take a bath? Now and again, back in the canyon, a hot spring. That's more like it. Mind if I borrow this? Well, it looks as if you already have. You sure you know how to use it? - I've seen them around. - Well, here. In that case, you might just as well take this too. And you'll find my towel and my soap in my room. Have a nice bath. - Where's she goin'? - Back in the canyon. She's doing what you ought to do once in a while: Take a bath. Keep dry outside and wet inside. That's what a man does in this country. What's that? You hear anything? - No, I don't hear anything. - Where's your gun? Where do you think? She took it. Psst. Now, who can—who can that be? - What are you gonna do? - Keep a bead on him till you find out who it is. - Are you the station keeper? - No, I just work here. Where's the boss? Oh, he's around. Just the two of you work here? I guess you're wondering who I am, huh? Well, there aren't many strangers come along. I've been wondering about you too. But I guess you're all right. Deputy Sheriff Miles, from Huntsville. Oh. Owens is my name. It's all right, Sam. You can come out now. I hear they killed one of my best friends, Johnny Madden. - That's right. - Ought to be shot down like a mad dog, that Zimmerman. Not a doubt about it. Trooper said he's looking for gold. Just stand still, Todd. Get your hands up. Get over against that wall. Higher. Face it. Now stay that way. - Hiya, Sheriff Zimmerman. - Keep 'em covered. Sure, Zim. - That everybody, boss? Just them two? - Don't know for sure. - By golly, it worked, just like Zim said. - We could have rode straight in. - Yancy, take a look around outside. - Sure. - Here. Take this. - You reckon that I'll be needing firearms, boss? - Take it. Put our horses in the corral and hide the saddles. - Sure. Take a look around for guns. - Gratz. - Yeah, Zim? All right, Todd, Owens, turn around. - Listen, Zimmerman. - I'll do the talking! I gotta say something! Now, I want answers, and I want 'em right. What time's the next stage due here? - One from the east. - What time? - Tonight. - What time? About sundown. What about the next stage from the west? - That's tomorrow. - What time? Usually early mornin'. That right? I ask you, is that right? - Yeah. - Know how much gold it's carrying? - No. - You? None. That shipment went through today. You— I don't like to be lied to. The westbound stage is due here at 8:00 tonight. The California stage comes through tomorrow noon... and it's carrying close to $100,000 in gold bars... consigned by the Crocker Mining Company in Sacramento... to the government mint in Wall Street, New York. You both knew it becauseJohnny Madden told you so yesterday. 'Tain't so, Zimmerman. Hey, Zim! Look! You want to take me out to a barn dance? - Where did you get those things? - In there. - Where is she? - Look, Zimmerman— - Your wife? - No. So she's yours. Where is she? Where is she, Owens? - Where's your wife? - I haven't got a wife. Look at the mules. He won't hand us no more lies. Where was you, Zim? Using my head. You ran out and left Owens. Where is he? You want I, uh, should take care of him too? If you had half a brain, you'd know we need Owens. Sounds just like a baby crying. I'm a ringtail monkey if it don't. Look. Look. It-It is a baby. Those are the men the troopers were looking for. - Why did they lock me in here? - They think you're my wife. - Your wife? - That's right. - What gave them that idea? - I don't know. I didn't say it. It was their idea. - Did you tell 'em different? - They didn't give me a chance. - Well, don't do it then. - Why? Well, it might save your skin and your baby's. - How? - I don't know, but as long as they've made a mistake... we might as well go along with it. - Whose skin are you trying to save? Ours or yours? - Well, mine too. Now listen here, Miss Holt or Mrs. Holt or whatever your name is... those killers are after gold— gold that's coming through tomorrow on the stage from California. I don't know what's in their crazy heads or what their scheme is... but killing me right away isn't part of it, or they'd have done that by now. What's all this got to do with your telling them I'm your wife? I told you I didn't tell 'em. They just put two and two together. Simple as that, huh? You're not getting me mixed up in this. I'm going out there and tell them I'm just a passenger on this line. They can rob all the stagecoaches they want to... but I'll do nothing to get Callie and me killed. Now you listen to me. Your only chance of staying alive at least as long as I do... is to let 'em keep on thinking that you're my wife. They need me. The gold they want is on the eastbound stage... but it doesn't come through here until tomorrow. There's a westbound stage that goes through here tonight. Sam's dead. They've got to keep me here alive. Now you and the baby can stay alive just as long as I do. That's all I've gotta say, and you can do what you like. - Where'd you get this? - Why do you think Todd was running for the stable? That's where Zim find it, by golly. Old sowbelly sure could have picked us off with this. Give it to Gratz. He won't leave it lying around where Owens can get his hands on it. Meanin' you can't count on me? Now let's get this straight. I didn't pick any of you for this. You just happened to be there when I made my break. All right. You're here. And that's my bad luck. By golly, Zim, I don't do nothing. Aw, it's not you he's shootin'at. You, Gratz—You're nothing but a— a big dumb coot that does anything he says. And you, Yancy— You're a one-horse horse thief. It's me he's griping' at. The first thing to do is to get rid ofTodd's body. Take care of it, Tevis. - You, Yancy. Give him a hand. - Sure. Come on, bean belly. All right. Come out. Gratz! - You must forgive him. He's just a big dumb animal. - Yeah, by golly. What kind of an animal are you, letting them shoot down an unarmed man? Kill or be killed. He was heading for that rifle. - Where's your gun? - My what? - Your revolver. You know what I'm talking about. - Can't you see he hasn't any? Where's your revolver? Well, Sam had it. You took it away from him. Don't you remember? - Where's his gun? - He sent it to Tucson to have it fixed. What was wrong with it? The firing pin was broken. That's a rotten thing to do. Tevis. Put that body on a pack mule. Tevis has no respect for the dead. And he just loves the living. Why don't you let us bury him? We won't run away. We'd hate to get shot in the back. Go ahead, if it'll make you feel any better. Wait a minute. I'll get the baby. She's all right where she is, Mrs. Owens. If you want to go with your husband, go, but the baby stays here. Go with 'em. Tell Tevis to let 'em bury him. - Yeah, Zim. - Stay close. Yeah, Zim. All right. Back to the station. Well, maybe they want to say some words. Well, let 'em get it over with. You take that shovel and get goin'. - Well, it ain't fit to walk away— - I said get goin'. Well, go on. Go on. Say the words. May the Lord grant you everlasting rest and peace. Come on. What are you doing? Preaching a sermon? Where's my pistol? It must be behind the water trough. Just a minute. Now I want the next stage to come through and no questions asked. - But they'll want to know where Sam is, won't they? - And you'll tell 'em. Gone to Tucson, Fort Yuma. Make up your own story. But make it good, so nobody gets suspicious. Remember, Owens. You have two good reasons to be careful. Company rules. If they hadn't forced me to stay here, I'd be on my way to myjob... and we'd be safe. Yeah, well... looks like we've both missed being on the right stage. Where were you bound for? I was taking Callie to her father's folks in Independence. - Where is her father? - He was killed in Gold Run three months ago. Her mother too. Callie isn't my baby. Her motherJeannie was my sister. Well, what happened? We used to sing and dance on the Mississippi riverboats. Jeannie fell in love with a gambler. He got the gold fever. You know, wanted to go out west. She wouldn't go without me. So we went. From mining camp to mining camp. Jeannie was pretty. Johnny, her husband, was... hot-tempered and jealous. Every time a man so much as gaveJeannie a smile there'd be a brawl. One night a drunken claim jumper took a fancy to her... and when the shooting was over I was alone... with Callie. I kept on working. Saved up enough money to get us back east. And— And you end up in this mess. If I could get my hands on that pistol. I was... just watching Owens like you told me to. Keep away from her. Oh, I— I ain't been cured of women yet. Ain't had your medicine, Zim. Now let's get one thing straight. Owens'll take orders from us just as long as he thinks... that's the only way he'll save his wife and kid. You start anything, and the whole thing blows up in our faces. Where did you get that coat? Oh, oh. Well, I got— It's just a coat— He took it from that fancy-pants passenger. - He took a whole carpetbag full. - Take it off! - Ah, well, it's kind of pretty— - Take it off and bury it. - Bury it? - Yes, bury it. Get it all out of sight. Don't you realize there's a whole stagecoach full of people coming through here soon? - Can't you get that through your simple heads? - I'm sorry, boss. - I—I "misfigured" it. - Well, bury it. Take it off. Bury it. Dig a hole, and I'll bury— I'll bury everything that— What happens? A pity to take a pretty coat out and bury it. I wish I'd have stayed in jail. - The clock's stopped. - Usually does if you don't wind it. What time is it by your watch? I could tell you if I had it. Yancy. - Yeah, boss? - What time is it by his watch? Well, let's see now. Uh— Just, uh, 9:00. Straight up. Have you got any idea what's holding up that stagecoach? - No. - Well, does it often come in so late? Sometimes. Sometimes they don't get in at all. Well, what do you mean by that? Johnny Madden's stage never got in, did it? Boss! Boss, look. She likes it. She's singin'! Mrs. Owens, put your baby to bed. She sure sings pretty, ma'am. I'll call you when the stage comes. - Have you thought of something? - Yes. Here. Try to get this to the stagecoach driver. But be careful. Don't take any chances. They'll be watching us every minute, and they'll shoot down everyone if anything goes wrong. I'll try to get one to him too. Keep your ear at the door. What's that? Ah, keep your pants on, Yancy. It's just a lucky old coyote singing' to his sweetheart. She coming', I think. Listen. Yeah, by golly. That's it. - That's it all right. You know what to do. - Yeah, Zim. - Tevis— - Don't worry about me. - Yancy. - Sure, sure. I know, boss. All right. Come on out. Both of you. Yancy. - What's he going to do? - He'll look after the baby. Now go with them. - Tevis. - Now wait a minute, Zimmerman. She'll be all right, just as long as you don't make any mistakes. - Why can't I stay here with my husband? - Because I don't want you here. He don't trust no woman, girlie. Go on, Mrs. Owens. Go ahead. Gratz. Now remember. All Gratz and Tevis have to hear is one shot. Now grab that lantern and look alive. Come on. Get your hands off that. I thought you wanted that stagecoach to go through with no questions asked. - Well, they won't even come in if they don't hear me blow this. - All right. Go ahead. But they okay, guys-- new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you're an actress, you're a professor and you have three beautiful kids. Great. Really? You think I'm putting this body through three kids? Okay, let's do this. Good luck. You... Aren't you gonna come with me? While you confront your mother about her sex life? I'd rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps. Mother? Mother. Mother? Shelly! I'm so glad you're here! I saw you having naked sex. What are you talking about? Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man. Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry. Come in. Um... Maybe we should sit down and talk about this. Can you recommend a surface you haven't had coitus on? That's not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I'm sure that, uh, you... have a lot of questions. Who was he? His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group. How long have you been involved with him? A few months. And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert? That is no way to speak to your mother. Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas. I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize. Or what? Or I will send you to your room. That's ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground. Go to your room. But I occupy the moral high ground. Go to your room. But I'm a professional scientist. Go... to your room! I'm a grown man. Can we please get back to the game? I-I-In a minute. I-I-I don't understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science. Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress... I'm not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are. I'm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff. Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out? Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising... FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard. In 20 years, who knows what'll happen with any of us? I think you and Leonard will be together. You do? Yeah. I think you're the best couple I know. Aw. That's so sweet. What the hell? ! Excuse me? Ah-da-da-da-da! Let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that? Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don't know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person. Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you. Oh, come on! Penny did it! I win! Suck it, jackasses! (knocking on door) Hey, can I come in? Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car. That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, "For Sale" signs start to go up. I take it things didn't go smoothly with your mom. No. I'm not sure how we're going to get past this. You know, I... I sort of went through something like this myself. Howard, we've all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe. I'm talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple years after my dad left. I didn't know she did. Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it. What did you do? Well, let's just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she's basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why. I'm sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why. All I'm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom's happiness. You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel. And the healing begins. Hello. Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults? I am. Shelly, I'm sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you. I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn't this contradict all the religious rules you've been espousing your whole life? You're right, it does, and it's something that I'm struggling with these days. Then why are you doing it? Because I'm not perfect, Shelly. And that man's booty is. Well, this is confusing for me. But I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness. So... I'll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance. That is very Christian of you. Mother, if you're going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it's not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore. How old do you think I am? My point is that you're going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you're going to need a stronger friend named latex. Are you having the sex talk with me? Well, someone has to. Oh, dear Lord! Yeah, well... No, don't look to Him. He's mad at you right now. Oh, come on, don't pout. I'm sorry I ruined your game. I'm not pouting, I'm brooding. Which is how sexy men pout. It actually was kind of fun. You're just saying that. Yeah. I liked the time travel element. Thank you. I thought it was inspired. It was. By Terminator. Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends. Definitely. Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we're friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let's all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do. PENNY: Aw! I love it. Okay? Putting it in my phone right now. Yeah, me, too. My phone doesn't have a calendar. It's all right, I'll just write it on my hand. And it's done. Yup, we're all in. All right, I'll see you guys in 20 years. I knew it. == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Should you really be sitting in Sheldon's spot? He's in Texas. He'll never know. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it's true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up. - Have you heard from Howard? - I did. His talk at NASA went great. Sheldon didn't heckle him? No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream. - Hey, guys. - Oh, hi. - Hi, Stewart. - Hey, Stewart! - How's it going? - Good. Sheldon's out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn't like. Oh, how is it? Disgusting. Do not tell him. What do you guys want to do tonight? I don't know. Well, I told Howie if I wasn't busy, I'd spend the night at his mom's. So for God's sake, think of something. Stuart? Are you okay? No, I don't feel so... - Oh, Stuart? - Stuart? - Oh, my God, you guys need to do something! - Stuart? Calling 911. - Well, it's too late. - What do you mean it's too late? He's been murdered by someone in this room. - Oh, my God. - Oh, come on! Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner. I'm leaving. You can't leave. You're a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom. - I didn't know his last name was Bloom. - Yeah, it's Bloom. Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?

"Lame characters with silly ac..." What kind of actress are you? You're right, I'm sorry. - It... sounds like fun. - Thank you. That kind of actress. This sucks! Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that's great. It's not sad, it's great. I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight. - Actually, you're all just gonna be yourselves. - Oh... ugh. All right, if I'm doing this, I'm playing to win, so just to be clear: If we're ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart? Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi. What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes? Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi? According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first. Great, everyone's a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now... here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues. Got it. Hey... who's the murderer? Any question but that. Sorry. Hey... who's not the murderer? Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me? What do you care? You're dead. Suit yourself. But I can kind of... see up your skirt. Thank you for my bobble head. Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech. It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz? We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed. - We should bring something. - I already am. I'm bringing the gift of knowledge. Oh, boy. Despite what her Bible says, recent archeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later. I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful. So, what happens next? I can't tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment. Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer. Hey, I-I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase. Oh, no, no. That's Clarence Darrow. It's from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system. Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun. Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff? Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn't have any friends. - I didn't know you were fat. - Yeah, I was... I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn't help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that... that I would play those games with them. That is so sweet. I've seen old pictures of you. - You were never a fat kid. - No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling. Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt. - What's it for? - For a cup of coffee. But it's dated 20 years from now. From the future? ! How fun and imaginative. - So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart? - Correct. Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he's just ripping off Terminator? Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, byHarlanEllison? Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier? I'm gonna need another clue. Okay... give me the flowers and pie. But if we show up and you're holding them, she'll think they're only from you. They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough. Yes... but now that I've seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there's no going back. Boy, I can't wait to see the look on her face... We're leaving right now. - What's wrong? - Nothing. What? Sheldon, tell me what's going on! I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again. You ready to talk about it? I'm not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it's like to see your mother ravaging someone? Does a brisket count? I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough. But didn't she know we were coming? No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this? - Well, did she see you in the window? - No. Then don't say anything. I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don't tell her how disappointed I am, and that I'll never forgive her? Well, don't do it on the phone. No, I'm just going to tell her I'm coming so she can give that Good Time Charlie the heave-ho. That's some tough talk. I may need to cut you off. Yeah, maybe you better. I took a pretty big sip. Look, she's a grown woman. And-and your dad's been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business. I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote. Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must've used. You're all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-traveled. Stop looking so bored. Well, my beer isn't flat and my rack's not saggy. So far, the future's great. Hey, can I go to the bathroom? Fine, just try not to look too alive. That's my jam. So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart? - But why? - Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue. Hey, I-I won the Nobel Prize in physiology. Then I used the money to buy Stuart's comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea. Hey, I'm a famous actress living in London. - Hmm! I'm a professor at Stanford. - Hmm! So I guess you two are making it work long distance. Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna. - What does your card say, Bernadette? - Eh, eh, eh, hang on. Do-do you think we'd really drift apart if we both became successful? Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me. But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up. Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn't need the money. Well, you don't go into science for the money. Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps. So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go? Well... He started it. Okay, okay, guys-- new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you're an actress, you're a professor and you have three beautiful kids. - Great. - Really? You think I'm putting this body through three kids? Okay, let's do this. - Good luck. - You... Aren't you gonna come with me? While you confront your mother about her sex life? I'd rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps. Mother? Mother. Mother? Shelly! I'm so glad you're here! I saw you having naked sex. What are you talking about? Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man. Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry. Come in. Um... Maybe we should sit down and talk about this. Can you recommend a surface you haven't had coitus on? That's not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I'm sure that, uh, you... have a lot of questions. Who was he? His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group. - How long have you been involved with him? - A few months. And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert? That is no way to speak to your mother. Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas. I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize. - Or what? - Or I will send you to your room. That's ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground. Go to your room. But I occupy the moral high ground. Go to your room. - But I'm a professional scientist. - Go... to your room! I'm a grown man. - Can we please get back to the game? - I-I-In a minute. I-I-I don't understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science. Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress... I'm not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are. I'm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff. Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out? Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising... FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard. In 20 years, who knows what'll happen with any of us? I think you and Leonard will be together. - You do? - Yeah. I think you're the best couple I know. - Aw. - That's so sweet. - What the hell? ! - Excuse me? Ah-da-da-da-da! Let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that? Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don't know.

Well, you're not getting out of PE that easily. You can be a cone. Right, you lot... Ryan...is a cone. OK, gentlemen... Dribble! SHE CLEARS HER THROAT Can I help you, babes? I'm Ryan's mum, got his kit. Ryan, what you doing with that cone on your head? Go on, get changed. Thanks, Mum. It's been a while, Trevor. Since what? Since we, um... you know. Oh, right. Did we? You don't remember, do you? Pub car park, Seven Bells? Wookey Hole Caves? Back of Greggs? Caravan, Ideal Home Exhibition? Legoland, Windsor? Cleaning cupboard, Pizza Hut? Do I look like the kind of lady who'd do it in a cleaning cupboard? Back of the Megabowl? That's it. Oosh! Oh, that's what you said that night when you, um... Yeah, I always say that, even when I'm doing it on my own. How long ago was this, then? Oh, it must be 13 years now. Is it really, 13 years? Whoaf! It was good times. Time. Good to see you, Trevor. What, no, and you. Ryan's mum. 13 years... Sssh! 13 years? ! Hello there. Give us a hand with these leaves, Churchy. Oh, I'd love to, but I haven't received the proper training. Come on, pal, there's thousands of the beggars. Every time I pick one up, another one falls. Well, that's the nature of leaves, but on behalf of the entire teaching staff, I wish you all the best with them. Sarah? Is he all right? I think he's just a bit leafed out. So, are you excited about parents' evening? Oh, I'm dreading it. Why? It's so embarrassing, all those dads flirting with me. Really? Yes, they all flirt with me. Oh, I get the same with all the mums. Really? Yeah. I'm not lying. I mean, I'm trying to speak to these grown men about their child's French homework and they're just staring at my chest. Yeah, that would... Oh, er... Sorry, what were you saying? Sarah, can I have a word? Anything you need to say to Sarah you can say in front of me. Chest. What? I didn't accidentally just say "chest", why would I? Keith, can you stop staring at my chest? Chest. Chest. No, sorry, what? Why did I come over here again? Oh, yeah, I need to talk to you...alone. You OK? No. I think I should come, too. Keith, he wants to speak to me alone and I think that's for the chest... breast, best. That is your fault. OK? Yeah. Better? Better. All right? Mm-hm. So, why don't you start by telling me what's wrong? Oh, yeah, right, um... Sarah, I just found... SCHOOL BELL RINGS Oh, just wait for that to stop. BELL CONTINUES RINGING It goes on quite a long time, doesn't it? BELL STOPS And go. Look, I just found out that... ..I'm a dad. Wow! What, so, so someone actually let you, um.... Yeah, it was 13 years ago. So they're 13? No, he's 12. The baby is inside the lady's tummy for nine months before it comes out. Yes, I did know that! But he goes to this school. He doesn't even know I exist. Well, if he goes to this school, he probably does know you exist. Oh, yeah, that's true. Yeah, actually, I just took him for PE. Oh, this is better than an episode of Waterloo Road. I don't know what to do. Trevor, can I just say? I'm really happy that you've come to me with this cos I'm actually a really good listener. Yeah, well, I thought... Ah, ah, ah, ah, ssh! And I think that you becoming a father is the best thing that could ever happen to you. Do you think I'll make a good dad? So... What else have you been up to? These biscuits are on the turn. Right, every... Oh, God, it's vile in here! So, everyone, parents' evening on Thursday. We're all very much looking forward to it, Headmistress. Personally, I'd rather shit in my hands and clap. Now, a few do's and don'ts. Mr Gunn, try not to get into any scuffles with the parents. I won't be rude about anyone's kids because I realise now that... children are the greatest gift you could ever have. Have you dropped an E? I just realised that life's beautiful and we need to let love into our hearts. He's found God! Even worse! Mrs Klebb? Present. The parents don't want to know about your partner's irritable bowel syndrome. It's actually got a lot worse. This morning I had to give Frieda a manual evacuation. Too much information. Miss, um...? Postern. QUIETLY: I'm beginning to think... Sorry, what did you say? Er, nothing. No, no, no, you said something, so share it with the group. Well, I said I am beginning to think you are forgetting my name on purpose. Would I do that? Miss, um...? Postern. You should know, dear, that last parents' evening, I received numerous complaints about your choice of attire. Excuse me? Many mothers said you were "dolled up like a Parisian prostitute." Well, I'm sorry, I'm not... I'm not having that. It is every woman's right to dress as she chooses and if all the dads keep ogling my chest, that really isn't my fault. Well, they will look if you flop them out on the table. MR MARTIN: I'm not going to be there. What? It's wrong. The whole concept of parents' evening is wrong. We work so hard to get the trust of these kids and then what do we go and do? We grass them up to their folks. No, I won't be a part of it. Also, it's the same night as Bake Off. Oh, what, Bake Off's on? The lemon meringue pie last week... ALL TALK AT ONCE Will you please all shut up about the sodding Bake Off! Well, let's put it to a vote. Hands up if you think we should cancel parents' evening. Fortunately, Mr Martin, this school is not a democracy - it is a dictatorship - so you will all be there without fail. Don't mind me. Just doing the bins. So, the parents will arrive at seven. Parents' evening, is it? Yes. Oh, great! I can't wait. All of us making a night of it, popping down the pub for a couple of pints and a good chinwag later. Mr Barber, your presence will not be required. Oh, yes, er... Of course, er... I just do the manual work. I forgot. Oh, hey, I could still set up a little caretaker stall... give the mums and dads advice on how best to get shoes out of trees, if you like? Me no like. Yes. Got it. Just get on with the bins, Gareth, else you'll make things worse than they already are. LIQUID DRIPS FROM BIN Oh! Now I've got bin juice all over the shop! Come on, Gareth, come on, come on. Let's get you back to your shed. You couldn't give me a hand with some leaves, could you? Course I will, chuck. Well, it would've been kinder to have had him put down. WHISTLE BLOWS Penalty! What? ! He wasn't even near the ball! You off! Ball. Ryan's taking it. What? ! Come on. BOYS GRUMBLE I don't know what to do, sir. Of course you do. All right, it's football, it's in your genes. All you've got to do is pick your spot and don't change your mind. Imagine, it's the World Cup final, yeah? The whole country is behind you. They're all chanting your name - Ryan, Ryan, Ryan! Go on, son, make me proud. BLOWS WHISTLE Don't move! Yes! ALL COMPLAIN Yes! Give me an oosh! Oosh! PUPIL: To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune... ..or to take arms against... Next! All right? Can I help you? You don't mind if I sit in on this one, do you? I didn't have you down as a Shakespeare fan. Oh, yeah, massive. I've read all his plays. Really? Which is your favourite? King... ..Kong. OK. Right, so, remember, this is the most dramatic moment of the play, the most famous speech in the history of theatre. Prince Hamlet is contemplating whether to live or die. And begin. DEADPAN: To be or not to be, that is the question, Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the springs and arrows of out... ..outrageous fortune or...or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing... end them. Finished. Boom! SCHOOL BELL RINGS There's your Hamlet. Your alphabet's wrong. Trevor, what an unexpected, er... What do you want? No, nothing. Just relax, it's just a social call, Churchy. It's about Ryan's test paper. It's 31%. Yes? You must've marked it wrong, the boy's a genius. Well, I wouldn't say he's a genius. What is H2O? He's written "fruit drink." Why does this matter to you? I see a lot of myself in that boy and believe it or not, I wasn't all that academical myself at school. I do believe that. Go on, Churchy, give him an extra mark. If I do, will you immediately leave my classroom? Yes. Hm, 32%. Boom! I'm telling you, Churchy, that boy's got the potential to go all the way, to Cambridge even. Hmm. On a coach trip, maybe. BLOWER WHOOSHES Mr Barber, what are you doing? What? What are you doing? SWITCHES BLOWER OFF What are you doing? It's a pre-emptive strike. What? Blow the leaves off the tree before they fall, beat them at their own game. Perhaps you should concentrate on the leaves on the ground. But where do you think they come from? HE RESTARTS BLOWER Goodbye, Mr Barber. How are you finding, er... ..fatherhood? What? Fatherhood! Oh, it's the best thing I ever did, spreading the Gunn seed. I'm actually eating. I just hope I can pass on all my knowledge to him. Oh, well, it shouldn't take too long. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to explain to somebody who doesn't have kids. Not really because I have two cats, Jules et Jim, so I think I know what it's like to be a mother. It's not really the same though, is it? Well, you wouldn't know because you don't have cats. Can I ask which boy it is? No, I can't tell you. He don't know himself yet, so it wouldn't be fair on the lad. Yeah. Yeah. You could tell me though. No. Well, you could cos I wouldn't tell anyone. No. No, I understand. Is it Kieran? No. Is it Tyler? No. Is it Abdul? It wouldn't be Abdul, would it? Is it Ryan? I didn't know Ryan was here. Ryan! Give us an oosh! Oosh! Oosh! It's Ryan, isn't it? Yeah. Bollocks. Oh, I'm fine with the test tubes, thank you, Jo. Oh, hello, Sarah. Oh, I'm sorry, is this not a good time? Oh, no, Jo was just leaving us. Would you mind leaving, Jo? Thank you, Jo. Ohh! What's the matter? Nothing. Well, I'm glad you popped by because I wanted to talk to you about Fair Trade week. Keith, you can't expect me to care about the price of bananas with everything that's going on at the moment. What is going on? I can't tell you. You can't tell me? It's a secret. Oh. So, whatever you do, please don't ask me to talk about it because I simply can't. Well, I thought we could do an assembly together comparing the prices of a coffee... I just feel like I'm stuck right in the middle between a really difficult situation. What situation? I can't say. It's about Trevor. I've said too much already. Did he try and touch you? Yes, but that's not it. Well, I can't really help unless I know what it is. Then guess. You can guess, I mean, I won't say anything. I'll just nod my head if you're getting warmer and I'll shake my head if you're getting colder. Well, um... He's got a secret love child at the school. So someone actually let him...? Yes! I mean, it's hard to believe, I know, but, yes. Who is this love child? Well, that I can't tell you. I understand. It's Ryan. Beatboxing masterclass, Luke Martin on the mic, here we go. HE BEATBOXES Boots and cats! Boots and cats! We're into it one time, great big school coming at ya! CONTINUES BEATBOXING MC Nicholas, drop it. Dum de dum... Back to me. CONTINUES BEATBOXING SCHOOL BELL RINGS Homework in first thing tomorrow, please. Oh, hi, Keith. Oh! It's not easy having a secret. Is it about Ryan being Trevor's love child? Who told you? Sarah. When? Just before this lesson. Well, she told me at the end of lunch so I knew a good 45 minutes before you. Amazing anyone would actually let him... Yes. Of course, it's very important no-one else knows. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Haven't told anyone, have you? No, no, not really, just Klebb... Baron, Hubble and Jo. You? Mentioned it to the man who popped in to change the ink in the photocopier. Other than that, not a soul. So no-one's told Barber? Gareth! Gareth! Gareth! Gareth! Mr Gunn has got... ..a love child. Gareth's got a love child! In your face! Hello, Sarah. I just wondered if after parents' evening tonight, you fancied going for a drink? Do you want to have children? I'm sorry? Do you want to have children? Well, can we just see how the drink goes first? It's just this whole thing with Trevor has got me questioning everything. I mean, I am a woman who has always put my career first, that's why I'm one of the top French teachers in the county. In the whole of the South-East. But... I've been thinking... ..and what would really make me happy is...if I had a baby. Well, if it's a baby you're after... I know how they're made. I would hope so, you're 44. Not clear on all the small print, but I know the headlines. Oh, Keith... have we both left it too late? Well, I haven't. Are you saying I have? No, no! Not at all, I mean, how old are you, 40...? Around 40. Around 40, well...you have a small window. No, I've got a big window. I've been thinking I'd really love to have a baby girl. Or a boy. Called Amelie. Nigel. I'd raise her in a run-down old farmhouse in Provence. Guildford. She'd grow up to be an artist. With a science degree to fall back on. She'd be a good mother. She'd give me seven grandchildren. Well, that would make Christmas very pricey, plus even a trip to Chessington World of Adventures, we'd have to hire a minibus. SHE SIGHS We'll not bother with that drink, shall we? How are you feeling, Trevor? Anxious, nervous, tense? It's just going to be so tough, you know, coming face to face with Ryan's, um... dad. Yes, well, what's best for Ryan is that it is still secret. Yeah. You haven't told anyone, have you? No, no, no, no. Of course not. It's going to be awkward for you tonight, isn't it, Trevor? What? Hope it goes all right with Ryan's dad. You've only got yourself to blame. Not you as well! Sorry, just to say, the photocopier's up and running, and good luck with Ryan's dad. Who told him? BUZZ OF CONVERSATION If I can have a bit of quiet, please? I can still hear people chattering about Mr Gunn's love child. Let us not forget, tonight is an important showcase for the school, so let's all work together and give it 100%. I wish I could stay, but it's nearly time for Bake Off. He's got quite a sense of humour, your lad, always making up funny names for me the Nerd, Mr Moobs, Bellend. Can you please ask him to stop? It's actually very hurtful. Kelly needs to work on her pronunciation. Sorry, I'm up here, not down here. Please stop looking at these. The service here is very slow, they haven't even brought us a menu! If Tom really wants to make it in the music biz, he's got to change his attitude. He really needs to start bunking off lessons. When it comes to A levels, I don't think he should take chemistry or any other subject he can't spell the name of. Alesha should not drop drama, drama is a hugely important subject, plus you can get a C for just turning up. Not that she'd need that...at all. Regardez le visage! Ne parlez hooters! You'd think they'd at least bring us some breadsticks. I'm going to... HE BEATBOXES I didn't cast Connor in the production because I've always seen Hamlet as a little Chinese girl. Is anyone having a starter? Or are we all going straight to the main course? ROOM GOES QUIET So, um, you must be, er... Ryan's, um... Dad. Yeah. Course you are, mate. So, how's he getting on? Brilliant. So proud of him. Really? He's always struggled with sports. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, the kid's world-class. I mean, I'd bet money on him... captaining England one day. Well, it's great you believe in him so much. Ryan is always talking about Mr Gunn, isn't he? Yeah, you're his favourite. Am I? What does he say about me? Just that you've been really looking out for him, so cheers for that. Yeah, and thank you for, um... for all you've done too. Yeah...um, is there anything Ryan can do better? No. He's perfect. OK, well, we'd better go and see that tarty French teacher now. No, stop! I can't live this lie any longer. There's something I've got to tell you. What? Oh, Trevor, don't do this. I have to, babes. It's...it's eating me up inside. I'm Ryan's... real... LEAF BLOWER WHOOSHES Turn it off, turn it off! Mr Barber, you know you're not meant to be here. Just dealing with a rogue leaf. Evening, everybody. Nice to see so many friendly faces again. I don't know if you all know, but... I went through a very dark patch... bit of a breakdown, a biggie. Not able to teach any more. Just... dealing with leaves... leaves these days. All right, Gareth. HE BREATHES DEEPLY Let's get you back to your shed. What was it you were going to say? Eh? Oh... You know, I'm Ryan's...real... ..PE teacher. And his dad. What? Why would anyone think you're Ryan's dad? Because of, you know, what you and me done... 13 years ago. What we did that night can't make you pregnant. Yeah, I knew that. You told me you'd been with some wrong 'uns before me, but seriously? This geezer's off the scale! Look, no, hang on, he can't be Ryan's real dad. He's not, Ryan's adopted. Sorry, can I get a bit of quiet, please? Something very important's happened, I've just this moment heard, Jillian's custard tarts were too soggy. She's out of the Bake Off. DISAPPOINTED GROANS Sir? All right? What do you want? I'm on my break. I just wanted to give you this. "Mr Gunn... "Thanks for being the best PE teacher in the world. "Love, Ryan. "PS... "Oosh!" Ofsted? I hear we've got a visit coming from those Ofsted bastards. Great teachers have nothing to fear from an inspection. True, so I suggest you take the day off sick. What do we normally do? Wash your car. All go down the chippy? I'm not a bad teacher. Oh, no, no, no, you're an abominable one. Who are you calling amobidable? Le bingo. Why didn't I hear any numbers, miss? - Well, they were all in French. - You should've said. This is a disaster. If Ms Steele finds the drugs, we're finished. I would like to make a donation to Ofsted. Do you think you can corrupt me with money? No. - That's a career ender. - Well, don't say that. DAPHNE: Headmistress, she hasn't seen me. She's seen me. ♪ When I think about the days There is something of a haze about it ♪ Though we're not the same Let's not break the chain ♪ We should play this game together. ♪ - ( music playing ) - ( clock ticking ) ( footsteps ) ( quiet chatter ) Uploaded by [ sRtFeVeR ] new srt source ( door creaks ) Pardon the intrusion, gentlemen. William, good to see you. What brings you up from Baltimore? The board at Columbia asked for a consultation on how best to teach surgery to their medical students. Aha. We're all the rage these days. William, let me introduce my apprentice Dr. John Thackery. Thack, this is Dr. William Halsted. - Pleasure. - Pleasure's all mine. I had the good fortune of working with your colleague Dr. Osler in Philadelphia a few years back. I know you're doing extraordinary things. Well, you're in good hands yourself. J.M. was always a step ahead of me in school, in sport, and with the women. Well, Dr. Thackery might best the both of us. In short order, he's proven himself indispensable to the Knick. High praise from someone notoriously stingy with it. After what you witness today, you'll be praising this man in the hallways of your hospital for years to come. Then let me take my seat and let the games begin. Good luck, gentlemen. You didn't have to do that. I meant every word of it. You're a comet in the sky, young Thack. Embrace it. I just feel that the surgery could very well fail. You've rehearsed it over and over in the pathological lab. It will succeed brilliantly. We've got a full theater out there. Colleagues you've invited with the promise of a great breakthrough today. A man whose life hangs in the balance. It could be the biggest finding of my career or an absolute disaster. You're just nervous. I am. Aren't you? I won't be in a moment. I wonder what Halsted would say if he knew about this. Who do you think told me about it? Christiansen: The appendix is a rudimentary, functionless organ. A relic, really, and yet it still has the power to fell a man in the prime of health and has proven a difficult adversary. The patient on the table is 25. An attorney. No history of alcoholism or syphilis. He was perfectly fit until yesterday when he was struck down with acute abdominal pain. Then Dr. Thackery quickly deduced appendicitis. The pain has worsened, the fever risen. Vomiting began this morning. We could take the usual course with therapeutics, but we know these yield poor results and most often death. It is my belief that there is a way to almost guarantee full recovery in all appendicitis cases, and that is the complete removal of the organ. They're ready. Let's give 'em a show. Dr. Thackery will make the first incision. In countless trials, Dr. Thackery has devised a way in which to accurately determine the location of the appendix, thus eliminating the estimation of where to make the initial incision. Dr. Thackery. Surgical knife. By drawing a line and divining the midway point between the anterior-superior iliac spine and the umbilicus, parallel to the fibers of the external oblique, no matter what the size or sex of the patient... you will always find the appendix. And there it is. The Thackery Point never misses. Please, Johnny. Johnny, please. Please, Johnny. ( speaking Mandarin ) Hold his arms and legs. ( gasping ) Get some towels. You should load up his bowl. He's gonna need something for the pain. And, uh... could you... load up a fresh one for me, please? - ( barking ) - Shh. Shh. ( barking continues ) ( sighs ) Late night. Been watching you for a while from over there. And I'm thinking you might just be a clergyman's daughter out here on the street like you are. Pardon me? I got an offer for you. Could be good for both of us. I happen to be acquainted with a Mr. Collier who takes very good care of girls like you. To have another dark one in his stable might be good for business, so I suppose-- I ain't what you think I am. Sure. Sure. But might you be interested in a little proposal? Make you some good money for what you're doing out here already. What I'm doing out here is waiting for someone. Well, maybe I'm that someone. That someone is my man and I ain't no streetwalker. - You got that? - The hell you think you're doing? He thinks I'm a street whore. - Hold on. - Tried making me an offer. Trying to fuck my girl, is that it, Paddy? Back off, spooky. You don't want to start nothing with me. The hell I don't! - ( grunting ) - Man: Stop him! - Come on. - ( woman screams ) Hey, where you going? Hey, somebody find that nigger! - ( crowd shouting ) - A doctor! Somebody run and get the doctor! Cleary: One of youse call the surgeons. It's the cop Sears. He's been cut bad. Stabbed by a dirty coon in the street. Come on. ( Sears groaning ) And up. All right. Cleary: Now come back at me, ya gobdaw, I'll bust you to your knees and make you lick the back of 'em. Back! Make way, we got real working folk coming through. - What's all this about? - Not a clue. They're boiling up about something. Interesting way to start your first day back. It certainly is. Here, allow me. Come on. ( vacuum humming ) My apologies for my lateness. I was taking Eleanor to see her parents. There's no need to explain. It's good to have you back. So we'll repair the hole and reinflate the lung once the bleeding has stopped. He'll have to make do with the other one for now. Nurse Elkins, forehead, please. Me as well, Nurse. Suction. Tied off the hepatic artery, but the renal is going to require significant repair. Well, let's do it. He'll need that blood flow or he's likely to become ischemic. You say you know him? Officer Sears. Good man. Used to go on calls with Speight for the HD. And he's got a fine crowd outside rooting him on to health. Never mind who they're rooting against. You know, when this surgery is through, I will write a love poem to this machine. Bertie, step aside. I'll do that. So he's missed the aorta, but hit the liver square. Took a good slice out of it. He should already be dead. What is that? This, Everett, is the miraculous Edwards suction machine. I'm building a second one. For my birthday, I presume. Hmm. ( people shouting ) There you go, lad. All right. Whoa, whoa. Here we go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Where's my boy? - Shh, shh. Where are they keeping him? The butchers. We're gonna take you to him, Mrs. Sears. - Phinny's a strong boy. - Aye, strong. Ain't that right, Jenny? He'll be home bouncing Charlie and Ailish on his knee again in no time. Part the way. Let the boy's family through. - Let's go. - Get your arses to the side! The family is here. We've done everything we can, but the lung is still a problem. We'll go back and repair that if he gets stronger. We've just got to hope he makes it through the next few hours. I knew Phinny. He's a good man. You mean you know him. Don't go digging any graves, missy. Of course. If there's anything you need, just ask. You want to help us, do you? Then find the devious nigger that done this to our boy and string him up in City Hall Park. Oh, we'll find him and do just that, Mrs. Sears. I'm not sure that's helpful right now. We should be concentrating on the family and praying for Phinny to get well. You know what? Cut your shit spittin'. - He's gonna make it just fine. - Yeah. Our Phinny's got more pluck in his little finger than all you got in all your sorry souls. - ( laughs ) - To Phinny! - Aye, to Phinny! - ( laughs ) That's the spirit. Bertie. I'll be back to finish the chart, Nurse. Has everyone gone completely mad today? What do you mean? First I had to push my way past an angry mob to get into the building, and then I had to push my way past Edwards in the theater. Ah. Well, you weren't in yet, so Thackery needed an extra pair of hands. It's more than that. He was treating him like some old school chum. And that contraption-- It's ingenious, I know. No more nights of nursing my sore, tired arms from all that cranking. All right. Do you remember when you were-- must have been about three or four... - Excuse me. - ...and you got your hand stung by a bumblebee? Do you remember? It swolled up to the size of your head. ( laughs ) Who the hell are you? I'm the deputy chief of surgery. Nice to meet you. I'm the Queen of England. Is he here to finish the job? Ma'am, ma'am, I assisted in this operation. What kind of hospital is this? - All right. - Nurse Elkins. Yes, Doctor? I'd like to change the dressing on the lower wound, please. 1% acetate of aluminum. Yes, Doctor. You really got to take orders from him? I take my orders from all the doctors here. The day I let a nigger tell me what to do is the day I dig my grave. - ( Sears groaning ) - Mrs. Sears: Okay. All right. All right. Officers. ( baby crying ) ( crowd murmuring ) All right. The operation's over. They sewed him up. He's breathing, but that's about all. It'll be a while before we're tipping pints back with him again, so you might just go on home. - ( crowd moaning ) - Could be days, lads. Show's over. Go home. Man: We're not going anywhere! ( crowd clamoring ) Christ, you'd think the heat would drive 'em back. To where, the tenements? ( crowd shouting ) - ( banging ) - Open the door! His pain seems worse, his fever has gone up, and his breathing has become more shallow. - ( Sears groaning ) - Mrs. Sears: I know. I know. What are you doing? You can't give him that. He needs something for the pain. The hell I can't. - ( gags ) - ( gasps ) - Oh, in the name of the devil! - Hematemesis. - That ain't English! - Internal bleeding. Something's not holding. Should I get the theater ready? No, there's no time. Bring me a surgical knife, carbolic, clamps, silk. Quickly. Here you are, Doctor. ( sobbing ) We... we won't be needing them. Sergeant: Move back, lads. Give her some air. - Off to the side. You've seen enough. - Okay, let's go. - Off to the side. - A little respect here, gentlemen. Okay, we're gonna take care of that cotton-picker. Right over here. That's it, right here. Okay, it's over. It's over. Mrs. Sears, we're all saying prayers for your boy. - My boy is dead. - ( crowd murmuring ) He's dead at the hand of one of them black bastards. Take down every one of them fucking darkies. Rip their throats and grind their eyes down to jelly. - Make 'em pay for what they done to my Phinny! - Over there! - Get 'em! - Make 'em pay! Make 'em pay! - Man: Get the darkie! - Man #2: Kill that nigger! ( shouting continues ) Thack. Thack! What are you doing? Help him! Stop it. Stop it. Leave him. Leave him! You're just standing there. Help him, God damn it. Tell the nurses to lock all the windows and doors. Edwards: What happened? We need to get this man to the clinic. You need to stay out of sight. ( shouting ) ( screaming ) ( shouting continues outside ) Harry, I got one for you. Been slashed to ribbons. Get me silk, two clamps, and a Steinhart's needle. Can't see. Can you see anything? No. - Oh, watch yourself! - Shit! ( groans ) No, stop. - You can't be in here. - Man: We need help. No, no, no. You need to get out. - Hey, get them out of here. - Back up. - No niggers allowed. - You can't be here. I said get out of here! No niggers allowed! - Hey, hey! - Hey, get off! Edwards! ( people shouting ) My apologies. We're gonna have to separate the room. Let's get all the Negro patients over to this side. You're letting them stay? - Thack, this isn't a Negro-- - Not the time, Everett. Reporter: You got something to say to his killer? Mrs. Sears: I got something to say. - Excuse me. - What I got to say you can't print in your paper. - Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry, ma'am. - But I'll say it anyway. - Excuse me. - What is it, lad? Them fucking darkies are-- - Help me up, lad. Help me up. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. The one who killed our Phinny is in the hospital. Wait, what are you saying? Them kids saw with their own eyes. He snuck in the back. And they're treating that murdering Quashee right now. Get the rope. ( shouting ) The cotton-picker that got Phinny's inside. Shit, they got ropes. - Really? - Yeah. They get in, hit 'em with this. All right. Barrow: I can't get away. I'm having a bit of a situation here, but nothing to worry yourself about, dear. All is well. It's fucking mayhem out there. They're gonna have the doors open in about 10 seconds. I just wouldn't come south of 50th Street today. All right? I love you, too. Maybe the police should break up the crowd. The coppers are the ones fucking spurring them on. God damn it! - ( shouting ) - Heave! Heave! ( creaking ) Shit. ( shouting ) ( shouting ) ( glass shattering ) The mob is in the building. They are destroying this hospital. Okay, listen, everybody. - We need to get the Negro patients out of here. - Barrow: You, help me. Thackery: Okay? Patch up the wounds as best you can. We're gonna have to treat them someplace else. Let's take the south stairs through the basement. Let's go. Quickly. Man: There's a bunch of darkies in here! ( shouting ) - ( man grunting ) - ( horses neighing ) Hey! ( grunts ) Come on! Those are our fucking horses! Whose side are you on? This isn't a good idea. Drastic times. Barrow: Where the hell are we going? What in God's name is this? Is this an operating room? An exam room, lavatory, a postoperative ward, and whatever else I need it to be. You did him? We have hundreds of deputies in the department. He wore a golden star. A badge with two pistol barrels crossed. And letters of gold spelling F-T-O. There are only eight Field Training Officers in the whole department. Tell me if you see him here. Yes. That is him. That is the man who threatened me. It's Burdon. You're completely confident this is the officer? I'm sorry this happened to you, sir. I can promise you it won't happen again. What do you think? I cleaned the whole place. What's wrong? Kath, I need to go home for a while today. I need to go home and explain things to Carol better... to Nate and Bethany. I should be home when they come back from school. You just said "home" three times. It is my home. At least until we make another one. Are you coming back? A couple of hours. Three at the most. I'll understand if you don't. I don't deserve you. Of course you do. Fuck. I told the kids that this was just temporary... that you were just taking some time off, like a vacation. I didn't know what else to tell them. Tell them the truth, Carol. Hello. Deputy Lester Burdon? Hello? -Deputy Lester Burdon? -Yes? This is Lt. Alvarez with internal Affairs. I'd like you to dispatch yourself to my office immediately. Can't it wait till I'm back on duty, sir? No, Deputy, it cannot. You be in my office in 45 minutes... or you can come in tomorrow and drop off your badge. Please wait. Excuse for me, please. I am sorry for keeping you to waiting. How is your foot? Better, thank you. Can I come in? -Please, come in. -Thank you. I grew up in this house. It's the house that my father left to me and my brother when he died. The county evicted me from this house by mistake. And your husband bought it... and now he won't sell it back for less than four times what he paid. Now, I don't want to argue with him. You know, I really don't. It's just that if this goes to court, it could take months, and-- They are to deport us? -l don't know. -You must see. They will kill us. They will shoot my children. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Please, you are a very nice girl. Please, you write for me everything. I want for to understand... for discussing with my husband. You think you can frighten me? You think you can frighten me with your stupid deputy coming here, telling lies. What do you think I am? Tell me that. Am I stupid? Do you think I'm stupid? In my country, you'd not be worthy to raise your eyes to me. You are nothing! And you can tell your deputy friend his superior officers know everything. You tell him that. This is our home! -Please. -Our home! Please, stop! -K, is that you? -Yeah. Mom said you sounded strange on the phone. What's going on? I need help. -l really need some help. -What's wrong? Do you think you could just come out here? Please? K, I'm sorry. I just got a real shit storm going on over here. We just got the new models in. There's inventory. I'll be right there. Just give me a second. I just feel lost, Frankie, you know? I just.... l just feel lost. Look, Ma and the aunts will be out there on the 18th. They can help you, bring you back, straighten you out, okay? I'm sorry, K, but I got to go, okay? All right, chin up, baby sister. I'll call you later. Don't tell Mom, all right? Okay, bye. Fuck. Pack of Royals? Wild night? Seems to be heading in that direction. -Have a good one. -Thanks. This, and three on two. You need a funnel with that? No. Just a book of matches. I'm sorry. I don't want the house anymore. I don't care. Don't go. You must sleep now. You must rest. Please? Some tea. Please, have bath to relax. That car in the driveway, is it that woman's? The woman has come here and tried to take her own life. We must help her. Pesaram, she is a bird. A broken one. Your grandfather used to say that a bird which flies into your house is an angel. You must look upon his presence as a blessing. We have a guest in the house. You must be a gentleman, joon-am. Very kind. Very polite. Very quiet. Hello? Do you need anything? Your mouth to open. Very good. Your mouth. Very good. Yes. Very good. I feel sorry for her. We should have moved. Yes, perhaps you're right. We should have moved. Put her down! What did you do to her? Step back. Shut up! -Listen! -No! Move! Les, don't. Move. What did you do to her? She took an entire bottle of my mother's pills. Bring them to me. How many? When? English! My wife says 20 tablets, perhaps half an hour ago. My wife made her lose her stomach. She has vomited the pills. She also attempted to shoot herself with that pistol. I discovered her with it in her automobile. She was quite upset. She'd been drinking great deal. That's bullshit. Come here. Pick her up. Carry her into that room. Carefully! Step away. She'll be okay. All right, come on. I don't want to see this door move. Get some rest in there... 'cause tomorrow you're selling this place back to the county. Fuck. Yes? -l have to go. -Use the toilet. Your mother will not look. Today I want you to pretend to be frightened of this man. -You must do everything he says. -Why? He is a weak man, he is nothing without his gun. He's very scared, and a scared man is dangerous. We will remain... lions in our hearts, pesaram. -You're here. -l'm here. Sir? Please let us out so my family can eat. -What's going on? -l locked them in the bathroom. Why? That's crazy, Les. No, what's crazy is trying to kill yourself. Kathy, why? I didn't think you were coming back. Well, I'm back. Do you really want to die? I just wanted things to change. You will get out when you call the goddamn county! Sir, may I speak with you? What? Please open the door. I wish to speak with you directly. I think I have a possible resolution. You and I will go to the government office... and I will sign the necessary papers for returning the house to them. They to me will write a check for $45,000. This check I will give to you and the woman... in exchange for putting the house in my name. -You would do that? -l would do that. Wait. We can't do this, Les. I think that this can all work out. He signs the house to the county. When he gets the check, he gives it to us. Then you sign the house back to him. It's wrong. It's just wrong to do it this way. This has got to work. This way, at least you get some money. He gets what he wants, the house. It's a win-win situation. No one gets hurt. Let's just go. Please, let's just go. Kathy, we could use that money. To start new. lt's our only choice now. He'll never let it happen. All right. Leave the keys and go do what you promised. But your son stays here with me. You're not back soon... Ishmael and I will be gone. But we have made an agreement. No, I will for you do nothing without my son. Nothing. Shit. Fine. Let's just do this. Move it, Colonel. Come on. You too, Ishmael. Excuse me, Mr. Burdon? -All right. Slow down. -Deputy Sheriff Burdon. Sir? I know you're busy. I just wanted to say I appreciate everything you taught me. I just wanted to say thanks. I appreciate that. And good luck to you, Brian. All right. You listen to me. When we get in there, you and Ishmael here... You listen to me. When we get in there, you and Ishmael here... you'll have to hear me a whole lot better. You're gonna do exactly as I tell. Help! Somebody help us! Detective,I got your beneficiary. It's a Mathias Lee Whitlock. Thank you. Agent Stark,DEA. I'm looking for Chief Whitlock. - How much was it? - 485,000. Did he arrange to have it picked up or dropped off? He told my agents he was sending it to my office. Nobody showed. I'm sure it was just miscommunication. That's a.38,Chris. Only six shots. Give me the gun. Give me the gun! He's gone. You all right? Give me the gun. Wait a minute. You said he beat you up. It was self-defense. No jury would convict you. Just put the gun down. You think Chris did this to my face? I think you should put your gun on the floor. What? Put it down. I didn't think I could do this,but I will. You set this up. - Put your gun on the floor. - Are you sure? Don't do this. Where's the money? Come on. Jesus! So you... We didn't mean anything to each other? - It's not important. - That's not important now. - It was just all an act? - Where's the money? Look me in the eye and tell me you didn't mean any of it. Some of it! Don't try to confuse me! - I don't have any choice now. - You don't have to do this. I've known you all your life. You're not a criminal. - You know I know you-- - Stop! What? ! Okay. All right,high-school sweetheart. You think I'm playing? I'm not playing. Damn! - I was aiming for your arm. - Well,you missed! - Where is it? - Outside the door. - Show me! - All right. Just calm down. Just wait a minute. Just wait. Don't shoot me. I'm just gonna reach for it. Show me! - Here it is. - Put it down. - Wait,don't shoot me. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm the one that got you the money. I'm trying to save your life. It wasn't all an act. I can't live broke. Life ain't shit when you're broke. - Shit! - Wait! Wait,no! Oh,my God. - Anyone else up here? - No. How'd you find me? - Are you hit? - No,I'm okay. I'm all right. It's Alex. Get me an ambulance and a med examiner. No,I'm fine. I'm at the end of Runyon Road on the dock. Hurry. Did you kill Paul Cabot? No... It was self-defense. He was attacking me. I was trying to get the money back. You were just gonna hand the money back? - That's what I was trying to do. - Then what's that over there? What do you got? Chris and Ann Harrison's bodies are upstairs. The real ones. They were both working for Cabot. Chief found out they were here and took care of business,right? Right. - Let's move. - Good job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Your guy never showed up,Whitlock. Agent Stark? Yeah. I don't care if you're injured or not. I want that evidence money,or you're gonna be looking at a case-- Where the hell is Southeast 63rd Street in Miami? 53rd Street. I told you 53rd Street,not 63rd. - No,you did not. - Yes,I did. I said Southeast 53rd-- You said,"Those assholes in the DEA are at 8400 Southeast 63rd Street." I didn't. I'm very sorry. What I said was,"Those assholes from the DEA are at 8400 Southeast 53rd." - 63rd. - Never mind. Just give them the money. Give them the money. You don't have to count it. It's all there. Have a safe ride home. - Come on. - Assholes. - It is all there,right? - Most of it. It's all there. That's a pretty good one. Nice touch. A little over the top. - Which part? - Your part. You're the one that came in here screaming. What happened to you,man? Just never leave your wife. That's what happened to me. I'd take the bullet. Be careful there. It's a classic. That grille work comes from France. - How you feeling? Excuse us. - Yes,ma'am. Did you love her? No. Why would you do this,then? Because I'm... Because I'm stupid. Because... I thought I was doing the right thing,trying to help her,but it's no excuse. Sometimes people,you know,do stupid things. Especially when they're still in love. Thank you. Let's go. How you doing? I thought you were Chae. He called all worked up about something. Okay. - You want to sit down? - Yeah. - How you doing? - Good. - I asked that already? - Yes. I said I was good. - You want a beer? - Yes. I don't have any left. You can share mine,though. So what brings you out this way? I just needed to move the rest of my stuff. That's cool,I guess. The house is a mess. This came for you at the station. You opened it? You opened my mail? - Why you always opening my mail? - Just read it. They just want you to fill out the forms. "To claim amount payable to the beneficiary for the sum of $1 million." - What? - We're rich. We're rich. How about that? - $1 million. - Easy,Chae. - He can't take that money. - I can't take the money? - Why not? - It's a conflict of interest. - He's the legal beneficiary. - I am the legal beneficiary. And he's one of the arresting officers. What the hell's that got to do with anything? Tell him how much trouble you can get in. It's a million bucks! It's the chance of a lifetime! No! As his wife,I'm telling you he's not taking that money. - As my wife? - As your wife. Come on. Come on,don't fall for that. - What do you mean,as my wife? - As your wife. You said you came to move your stuff. I'm moving back in. This is great. Congratulations. It's kind of fortuitous. - You serious? - Yeah. Are you gonna behave? I'm actually afraid to leave you by yourself. You won the sweepstakes,man. You can do this later. It's a million bucks. Let's not lose focus. You know,a honeymoon fund,a nursery wing for the... This is the golden pot at the end of the storm thing! Just sign it before you go in,huh? I'm not gonna let you do this to yourself. I'm gonna be sitting out here when you're finished. I can wait three minutes. I'm a patient man. I am a patient man. Come on! Bye! Cell check 750. Hamsterwheel present. Confirmed. That's Hamsterviel. Oh, the indignation that my evil genius is wasted upon such a pitiful pretending-to-sleep ruse. Dr Hamsterwheel detention-code override sequence activated, Hamsterviel! Viel! You oh-so-soothing computer voice! Contact Gantu. Yes, Dr Hamsterviel, Explain to me, you overgrown sea bass, why my tiny hamster-like hands hold no evil genetic experiments? There haven't been any experiments activated recently. Warning: experiment 520 activated, Until now. And what are you waiting for? Get it and send it to me! All right, keikis, later is the Annual Aloha Sand Sculpture Exhibition at Lahui Beach. So now we're going to choose a design that represents aloha for our entry. Did everyone come up with an idea? A cat. Robo-hula, And ice hockey? Myrtle, excellent choice. Duke Kahanamoku. Hawaii's greatest athlete and the official ambassador of aloha, He was? Mr Petuli, wait! I made an aloha design, too! And Pudge the fish says "hi". Lilo, this is... - ... interesting. - It's an aloha tiki. And this line shows its aloha level. It's almost full, but not quite because sometimes it acts out and devours innocent humans. Look at this. It's totally gross! - Yeah! - Yeah! Well, I do think Myrtle has the best design. Well, then we don't need this! Girls, this is not what aloha is about. How are your aloha designs coming, Stitch? Stitch, that's mean! Moses is right. We don't know what aloha means. My evil genius improvements to stove are successful! Your improvements ruined my meat loaf! No! Is appealing quasi-rectangular bovine flesh block. It is beautiful, isn't it? Is a little bit crunchy. Inside and out. It's loaded with carbon! - What was that boom? - An explosion of Earth cooking! Dig in! Icky. This is a good design for a sand sculpture. It says "aloha", Kinda. For sand sculpture, is always nice to make castle fortress. Huge, impenetrable stronghold from which evil genius can destroy all! With teensy flag to fly on tippy-top. I can't beat Myrtle's design with a boring sandcastle. Boring? Why, what is this Myrtle's idea that is more genius than impenetrable stronghold? - Duke Kahanamoku. - Hawaii's greatest athlete? Official ambassador of aloha? - That's brilliant! - That's brilliant! What is that smell? What you smell is the aroma of misery. Don't worry. I know how to cheer up a sad Lilo. But, David, the pool at Birds of Paradise is for hotel guests only. - There are, like, ten signs. - Relax, Nani. I was here yesterday, and I figured out their system. All the hotel guests have special blue towels. And so do we. See? Instant vacation. Come on, Stitch, photo safari! - Are you sure this is OK? - Relax. - Lilo and I sneak in here all the time. - You what? Just chill out and enjoy your... our honeymoon, sweetheart! Hello, sir, ma'am. Are you guests here? - Yeah. - What's your room number? - Two fifty-seven! - Three nineteen. - Two fifty-seven. - Three nineteen. Two fifty-seven. Well, we don't have a room 319,257, and, besides, today is red towel day, not blue! Busted. Like living mummies! Vampires of the sun, wonders of nature. Aren't they beautiful, Stitch? Stitch? Stitch! Oh, no! No, you're fine, but look! It's Gantu! - Just follow the bouncing abomination. - He's after an experiment! With a really big butt! Stitch? Come on, we've gotta do something! Locals! Next time, I call the cops. Who needs your tacky tourist trap anyway? We got a whole ocean to swim in. What's all that? - Wait! Lilo! - She's safe with Stitch. Run! North Shore's got nothing on that! Hey! What's the big... Hey, buddy! You better have a red towel! Get away from me! I don't like the way he's looking at our ocean. You flicked him like a booger! But now we gotta go find him, and he's not gonna be behind the sofa. OK, we're here, and it landed somewhere over there. And there's a lot more of "over there" than there is of "here". We'll never find him. Wow! How'd you figure that out? You're smarter than any pet I ever had, except maybe Koko the goldfish. But he croaked, so I had to flush him. I guess I'll try the Launch Velocity Over Molecular Weight Times Pi Latte. Low fat. Where's Lilo? Is she here? No, but a freshly mopped floor was here. Apparently it just left! - Lilo! Are you all right? - I'm fine, but Stitch and me need to borrow your car. My car? Are you lölö? - Stitch could drive! - He doesn't have a license! Sorry. We only have one working car, and I need it for work! But there's an experiment loose! It can find its own ride. I have to get to the Rental Hut. Business is way off, and old man Wong is getting grouchy. - But... - I'll be home after work! Little girl, is my hearing correct? One of my precious creations is running about free? Yeah, it likes water, and it has a really big butt. - Just like my sister! - Hey! Experiment that is liking water and having large posterior? That would be 520! I was true evil ingenious that day. 520 turns any body of water into giant destructive wave! - It keeps trying to get to the ocean. - That I'd like to be seeing! Would make wave so big, whole planet will be destructed! Oh, would be bad thing, yes? Hello? Just think of all the jellyfish! No jellyfish, no jelly, no PB and J. We gotta stop him, but we don't have any transportation. What are you talking? Follow me. Your tall sibling has misinformation about number of working car-mobiles. - You fixed Nani's old dune buggy! - More than fixed. Is tricked out with so many customs, is boo-yah furious racer! Good for capture of experiments, yes? Just place 520 in protective orb, here. See, snug as rug in jug! Hold it right there! We cannot send a little girl off joyriding in an unlicensed, untested and possibly radioactive vehicle without a little snack! 625! Rough day? You look like last week's lettuce. Get a blaster! Hurry! - OK! Now what? - Cut me free, you insipid trog! You're in luck, fish breath. I took a class in advanced applied blasting. - Hey! - Oops. - Careful! - Sorry! Stop squirming! My bad! You almost vaporised me! That's what my teacher always used to say. Hey, hey, easy there. I'm not designed to be picked up like that! Are you sure we're looking in the right spot? There! - Bull's-eye. - Nice shooting, Tex. So, you're the reason Hamsterviel has me running all over this pitiful island. You'd better be worth it. Home run! Let go of me, you! Hold still! Where'd you go? You! Stitch! That's right. You want a piece of Gantu? You got it. Stitch! You OK? You're OK! You were just playing dead, like Koko the goldfish. 520? But what did Gantu take? Oh, it's a pineapple. Very good, Yes, juicy, pulpy sweetness is what every evil genius needs for conquering the galaxy, You fool! Yes! You da kine! Come on, we're your friends. You know what friends are, don't you? You know the big elephant-foot, fish-face guy? He's not your friend. But we rescued you. We are your friends. Aloha, friend! Aloha? We're supposed to be sand sculpting! More on the surfboard. You're not capturing my vision! Look who's here, with two ugly dogs now. Now, you're gonna have to behave yourself. Come on! Why has it got a giant caboose? Highly contagious butt-rabies. Calm down, keikis, Let's stay focused. Keep working. I'm glad you showed up, Lilo. It's good, you know? And even if I don't know what aloha is, I can still help. Lilo, that is what aloha is all about. It is? Go on, now. I've got an exhibition to judge. What? What? I'm a Samoan, just out for a stroll. Stitch? Where you...? Gantu! Open up! I'm here for the abomination! Go away! I like abominations! I'll have to devise an assault plan for this fortified defence structure. This is just made out of loosely compressed silicate! Oh, no! I thought 520 was our friend! But it's gonna wipe out the whole planet! Tsunami! Everyone, run! Oh, blitznak. I was wrong. He just wiped out Gantu. I'm gonna name you Cannonball 'cause you like to make waves. Congratulations, Lilo. Myrtle's design is good too, but you showed more aloha today. Awesome. It's not fair. She's so weird, and I'm so normal! Now, where would you fit in best? Everybody can use a good wave, but where to start? Nani. Another day, another job waiting to be lost. - Hey, we need boards. - Yeah. Quick! Sure! What's the hurry? Waves are breaking all over this beach! Everyone's coming down from North Shore! It's crazy! - All right, two for me. - It's absolutely perfect. Look at it. Come on, everybody! I wonder what happened to Gantu? San Francisco? Oh, double blitznak. This motion picture has partially reinterpreted certain historical events based on the facts of a true story. The late 1930s, the US has thus far stayed out of World War 2. Japan is looking to expand their powers in the Pacific theater to build an Asian Empire. The only way that Japan's ambitions could be thwarted was for the US to enter the war. At the very crux of the events leading up to the US involvement was one man, a Korean called HAAN. Mr. Haan JAPANESE STRIKE FORCE HAAN 1938, Hawaii Our second step would be place marines on Midway Island. This is near the Japanese mainland and from here we can organize in attack. So we submitted a proposal then for trade a spy, in the Japanese embassy located in Hawaii. Mr. Haan who submitted this proposal Japanese, he will be the one. Ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Haan. Are you all right? What happened? I'm so sorry. But you jumped in front of me so suddenly... Aren't you the one from the Kingfisher Club last night? Singing with the guitar? You were great. I would like to ask the consul to invite you to the consulate, what do you think? Do you know consul? He is my husband. Today is Wednesday, isn't it? Yes, that's right. We have to meet the consul. Right now. It's an emergency. What's wrong? Do you have a car? It's urgent! I don't think you can get up right now. Hold on tight. Here he comes, here he comes! Finally, we get a big one. Ahh! Those japs, just need to ride right over it. This place is too dangerous, get out of here! OK. - That's Kil Soo isn't it? - What is that? The Americans are up to something. What is their Pacific Fleet here doing? I don't think there's been much movement yet. There is a bomb on this bridge. The Korean spy organization SKPL have installed it to assassinate the consul! Koreans... Dakeo! Yes, sir! Go check it out! Yes, sir! What do we do? Oh My God. I've found something! Don't touch it! It might blow! Son of a bitch! Ahh, shit! Be careful. It took so muck time to make that bomb! He's driving me crazy! We thank you for today. But aren't you also a member of the SKPL? I spied on the US Naval Intelligence for the SKPL. I can give you information that will help the Japanese Empire in the Pacific. I see. Let us talk about that later. How could he! The bomb that he built with his own hands! Delivering right to the Japs! Could there be another reason? Reason? What reason could he have for blowing up a plan that we've preparing for months? We need to calm down and report this to the top. Report? Why don't you report that his dead body's ready to be picked up! Damn it! This is the report on Oda. Oda Report Let's drink. How fortunate we are to be able to drink Japanese drinks so far away in Hawaii? It is all thanks to you. Mr. Yoshikawa - It's good to see you. - It's good to see you. What a coincidence. And who is this gentleman with you? This is Mr. Haan... no Oda. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Oda. It's a pleasure. I am Watanabe. I trust that your wife is in good health? She's just so full of energy whenever I see her nowadays I can hardly keep up. Excuse me. Nanami! Hello! I'm afraid I have a prior engagement where I must be. Oh... leaving us so soon? I'll see you again soon. Oh, by the way, this is Nanami, the Consul's secretary. Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you. And this is Oda-san. It's a pleasure to meet you. Well. We'll be on our way then. Why don't you sit over here? Thank you. You are ethnically Korean are you not? I though I overheard them call you Haan... What do you mean? I have officially changed by name to Oda and I am now a citizen of the Empire of Japan. Of course, of course... Let me pour a drink to a new citizen of the Empire of Japan. All of those Koreans here in Hawaii should change their name like you, Oda. I don't understand it. We've been gracious enough to annex Korea into Japan and allowed them to take on new names. Those stupid Koreans just don't know what's good for them. You measly Jap! Who gave you the right to mess with our names! How dare you! You want to fight? Haan you Japanese dog! Sit down. We checked up on Oda and he really was the SKPL agent in charge of intelligence from the US Navy. That explains why he could be so knowledgeable about the US Navy. I think there might some use for him for a while at least. I'll leave that up to you. But I wouldn't trust him too much. A Korean is always a Korean. Don't worry about that, sir. Japanese Naval Affairs Office Hello. I've brought the documents that the Consul has approved. Is Yoshikawa not in? Yes, I think he is in the code room. I'll relay them to him. Would you? Thank you very much. Nanami, I look forward to working together. Excuse me? I just wanted to say that look forward to working together. Level 2 Classified Oda, what are you doing there! Oh, Nanami brought the documents approved by the Consul. And this is the information that you requested... Have you heard about the peace talks? What peace talks? It looks like Japan and the US are engaged in talks. Just a moment. Hello? It's me. What? I'll be there tomorrow. US Naval Intelligence, Hawaii Hello? Mr. Haan. Nice to see you. Sir. I heard from colonel Mike. All plan has been canceled. What happened? I'm sorry, Mr. Haan. He will tell you to evacuate the embassy soon. You mean we are giving up all the plan to attack Japan? Tensions with Japan had been diffused diplomatically We're days away from The Peace Treaty. But don't you think we should wait at least six months to know? What's really going on in the Embassy? And full out the useful data? It wasn't easy to infiltrated here. Please, let me stay here in the embassy little longer. Ok, I'll extend the deadline. But I suggest you focus on information for Southeast Asia, Is the clear? Yes, sir. Good luck, Mr. Haan. Sir! His Midway plan was suspended? No. That's still a go. When the movement begin? November 28th. That's classified information. When you finish reading it, I suggest you to destroy it. - Ok, thank you sir. - Thank you, Mr. If the US doesn't attack Japan, then who will overcome them? That's it. If I let the Japanese know that the US plans to move their base closer to Japan, to the Midway Islands, Japan won't stand for it, and the US will have to change her mind. This intelligence is incredible and very important. Is it dependable? Yes, yes it is. The US is about to move. Keep your eyes on him. If the Americans are moving their Hawaii base to the Midway Islands, couldn't they be planning to attack Japan? The Americans have already blocked off our oil supply. Is this intelligence certain? Yes, it's top secret intelligence that Oda personally extracted from the US Naval base. Is Oda really trustworthy? I think it's about time we found out the true extent of his loyalty to Japan. Yes, sir. Oda! Yes, sir! Minister Dojo will be visiting Hawaii on the 30th, I want you to make sure all preparations are in order. Minister Dojo is coming to Hawaii? Yes sir, I understand. I think I'm done for today. We should have killed you after the SKPL bomb incident... You've got way too many lives! Our job is to find trash like you and clean it up. We've heard that the Japanese Prime Minister is planning to come to Hawaii. If you tell us when he's coming, we'll let you live. Speak up! When is it! I've told you, I don't know! I'm just... an assistant, I take care of petty documents... They don't tell me anything! Haan, you son of a bitch. You shit! OK then, Haan! We'll see how long you last. Speak up! Speak up! Do you want to see your fingers chopped off one by one? Hold still! Speak up! When is it! I don't know. I really... don't know. You traitor! Mr. Haan? Mr. Haan? Are you feeling better? Do I always have to see you here? You're good looking but you sure can't fight! Why are you always getting beat up? Oh, Yoshikawa left this for you. From today, you are officially appointed a special agent of the Empire of Japan. - Head of Intelligence, Empire of Japan - The Americans have effectively barricaded the oil route for the Japanese Empire. We are in a desperate situation where the lack of fuel is threatening to end our war in Asia. Those damn Americans! Consul! What can we do to help here? How about storing up fuel? That is also what I had in mind. The government will give us whatever funds we need to buy oil. Let us stock up as much fuel as we can for the war. Oh no! Are you all right? Yes, I'm all right. Thank you. Oh No? Yes, Hello? Yes, yes this is Pastor Park. Sung-Do Yoon... yes of course I know him! May I ask who is calling? How do you know him? Yes, who is it? It's Oda. Oda, what are you doing here? There's something I need to ask you, may I come in? Is there something that you need me for? No, nothing like that. Then, you can tell me tomorrow at work! Nanami! Please, it will only take a moment of your time! I'm sorry, I'll see you tomorrow! Ji-In Yoon! It's been a long time since you heard Korean, isn't it? Please tell me what you are here for. Ji-In Yoon, let's speak in Korea, as two Koreans! Get out! When will you become the wife of an officer of the Japanese Empire? Will your parents be at the wedding? That's none of your concern! I said leave! Don't you even want to see your father? Ahh! What are you doing? What is this! Is this the way Koreans invite people? I apologize at our rudeness. Please, sit down. He said sit down! Is your father Sung-Do Yoon who was once a student at Tokyo University? What are you saying to me? Are you not the daughter of Sung-Do Yoon? Who is this Sung-Do Yoon? Is this not your father? Why did you bring me here? Why are you asking me if this person that I've never seen before my father? I don't believe this. Let's be frank here. You are a Korean woman, you're Korean! This man here, this is your father! We're just gonna have to show her a hard time aren't we? Stop it, Be quiet. Stand back! Kil Soo! You know I have children, don't you! You son of a bitch, I told you! We should have killed him then! You treat women like this? What are you doing to your comrades! We're not stupid here, let's not do anything stupid. Nanami! Shit! Send her over here, now! Ahh! Ahh! Shit! - Hey! - Ahh, damn! Ji-In, how long will you continue to pretend you're Japanese? Don't you think it's better to live as a Japanese a Japanese than to live like you, neither Korean nor Japanese? Whatever, Haan... I guess I'm just not as smart as you to understand why you're doing what you're doing. You'll understand someday. You must not forget that your father was a freedom fighter who fought and died twenty years ago in Tokyo! So what? Ji-In! Mr. Haan, I think there's something you don't understand. Whether he was a freedom fighter or a martyr, I hate my father. He was a father that just took up and left my sick mother, and me, too young to know what was going on. Is that what a freedom fighter is? Is that a patriot? Does a freedom fighter have the right to live only for his country and not care whether his wife his dying, throwing away his children and his home? I'm sorry, but I've already erased him from my mind a long time ago. Can I leave now? Good bye. Ji-In! It has finally begun. Our motherland has decided to strike Pearl Harbor. The war with America will soon begin. Yes sir. You must waste no time to finish the maritime map for the attack and send it to HQ as soon as possible. Yes sir. Japan is finally about to begin to implement a plan against America. Yoshikawa. Sir. The Party Head would like to meet with you, let's get together. Oda too! I'm busy until next week! Then Oda at least! I'll be there! Anytime! OK. I will see you next week! To the Emperor! To the Emperor! I would like to thank you once again for your visit to Hawaii! I have brought with me some valuable books. It was prepared rather hastily by our party with the help of the intelligence headquarters. I want everyone to read it carefully and prepare for what is to come. This book holds top secret information. I want everyone to take special precaution to make sure that its contents are not divulged! Yes sir. This book is being handed out only to the members of the party. It details an incredible event that will occur after the peace talks with America. So the Japs are going to strike Pearl Harbor. Sir, it's not some of fiction. It's international leak. It is clearly written Japanese plan to attack on Pearl Harbor. Sir, Hello? Hello? You think I'm interested in Southeast Asia? Excellent! I think you're better than me? At this rate I expect good results in your next promotion exam. If Yoshikawa comes out as my opponent. No, I think you're good enough to overcome anyone with one stroke. Ji-In, I was glad to see you. I'd been looking for you and your mother for 20 years. Meeting you has brought back memories of Master Sung-Do Yoon. I am sending you his final possessions that he entrusted to my father. He's a man of worship, sacrificed himself for independence. I hope that you can forgive him now so that he can truly rest in peace. Ji-In! Father! How long will you take this time? I'll be back soon to see you. Father, I miss you so much... I wait for you every night, why do you have to go away all the time? Ji-In, when you are older, I will tell you everything. Father, I'm old enough! Please don't go, not today! Please! Don't go! Look at mother! She's so sick... Ji-In! Mother! Ji-In, please take care of your mother. Father will be back soon, I promise... Honey... Mother! Mother! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Ji-In! What are you doing here? What is it that you wanted to ask me at the church last time? Come in. May, 1941 What is it? Sir, Nanami is looking for you urgently. Nanami, what is it? The frame with the Foreign Minister's Calligraphy fell down. Wait just a minute, I'll be right there. The consul will be here any moment. Ahh... the loop's fallen off. What? The loop? Yes. I don't think anyone deliberately dropped it. I'm so sorry Yoshikawa. Just be careful from now on. I'm going back to work. OK. The Naval Affairs Office! Yoshikawa! I'm sorry for bringing this up now, It's about our marriage. My mother, she's very happy about it. And also I'm getting older... Well, I don't think we need to delay it any longer. I think we can plan for after December. I'm sorry, can we talk about this later? Soon. Yes, of course. Why are you doing something so dangerous? My parents. Their heads were chopped off for giving a pail of rice to the freedom fighters. What? They cut off people's necks for giving a pail of rice? It was a public execution. My uncle made sure that I didn't close my eyes, he told me to take a good look. When I turned five, prefer running to walking... he said we should emigrate to Hawaii, that I should learn to pull a man's weight. So I came here and learned Korean and learn about my country. That's how I became an agent for the US Navy to fight for our independence. Getting your country back... Is that so important? If your father had been alive, he would have been able to answer that question better than anyone. Please, don't mention my father. I'm sorry. No, don't be, it's just that... of course I want to see my father. I used to cry every night because I missed him so much. They called me a crybaby. He said he would come back... but he still hasn't. Sir, Mr. Haan is managed photographs in Japanese documents. I decode it a few words. "Kinesy Island" and "Pearl Harbor attack". Where did you get this?

This newspaper was in the consul's secret filling cabinet. The 7th is a Sunday so the entire Pearl Harbor fleet will be moored in the harbor and the men will all be resting in the base. All the planes will be in the hangar or on the runway for maintenance. It's written by the intelligence officer for the ultra-right wing party. Sunday, December 7th. That could be the date of the attack. The consul has put his car up for sale for only ten dollars, December 5th is the final date of the withdrawal of the consulate... Ms. Yoon, we have no time left. You know that Yoshikawa puts all of the classified documents in Kamemoto's safe before leaving work everyday, don't you? Yes.

A pubic cemetery near San Francisco. Haan's grave. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Haan became a hero in the US media. Making a significant impact in placing all Japanese Americans in a holding facility in Colorado. He was also successful in helping Koreans, who had been classified as Japanese, reclaim their citizenship and their property. In 1945, Japan surrendered to the US and Korea gained its independence. When the Seungman Rhee administration was launched, Haan's opposition to the division of South and North Korea under US and Soviet control caused him to be exiled from his homeland and abandoned by the US authorities. He spent his remaining years as a fruitpicker in a Californian peach farm. He died in 1976 at the age of 76. As of 2005, Haan is still classified as 'decision suspended' in the 'Ministry of Patriots' and Veterans' Affairs list of Significant Contributors to the Nation's Independence, because he is considered to have been a double agent.
