if it's not true, I will see you impeached on the floor of the Senate and bury you! Good night. It's preposterous. Idiotic story. Mother, there's something I have to tell you. What? I've been having the dreams. Ben said there were tests they could run to see if... No. Where are you going? -Sergeant Shaw. -What? Sergeant Raymond Shaw. Mother, I... Raymond Prentiss Shaw. Yes. Listen. Good morning to you all, and welcome to Amtrak's northbound Acela, making station stops at Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New York's Penn Station and Boston as the last stop... Who's that? It's Raymond, sir. Oh, don't do that. You're gonna get soaking wet, Raymond. Raymond. I came to apologise, sir. Raymond, what are you doing? -I'm sorry. -We'll get some help for you, son. It's not your fault, Raymond. it's not your fault. -I'm sorry, sir. -It's your mother... Dad! Help! Oh, God. Daddy! Help! Raymond? What are you doing? What is going on? What is happening? Where's my father? What are you doing? Dad! Dad! The five-term senator and recent front-runner for his party's vice presidential nomination, appears to have accidentally drowned when his kayak overturned near his Chesapeake Bay weekend home. Police say his daughter; 35-year-old Jocelyn, may have been trying to rescue Jordan when she was herself overcome by the icy water The bodies of Senator Jordan and his daughter were discovered this morning by a crab fisherman who spotted the capsized kayak floating far offshore, nearly a mile from Senator Jordan's residence. Neighbours say the senator was an expert kayaker whose morning trips were a familiar sight along the western bank of the Bay. Governor Arthur; do you have any comment on this tragic event? Senator Jordan was a statesman of the highest integrity. Tom Jordan was a friend. A damn fine man. Just a great American. That's all for now. We'll have something for you a little later They're the latest target of SE C corruption probes, but private equity fund Manchurian Global confirmed today it is continuing with plans to finance privately owned combat units to relieve beleaguered U.S. troop deployments worldwide. It is a move that could save the Defence Department billions of dollars. How does Arthur die? You know who I'm talking about, the new president. If he dies, Raymond Shaw becomes the new president, doesn't he? Chain of succession. That's what you got in mind. That's what you people wanna do. You wanna really run the world, don't you, Susie? Rosie? Whatever the hell your name is. Well, I got my library card and I got your tapes. I do my research too. We're going to the feds, we're going to the police, the newspapers, whatever it takes. I am the feds. Now, get off me! Get off of me! We found... an implant device in AI Melvin. You found one in Melvin. Just like you said. I'm part of a shadow unit. We've been watching you. Trying to sort this thing out. This isn't an election, this is a coup. This is... In our own country, a regime change, in our own country. Ben, don't. Ben. This is rich people, Manchurian Global funding bad science to put a sleeper in the White House, and that's what's going on, Rosie. -That's what's going on. -I wanna believe you. Well, then, believe me. Help me. Help me. Shoot me, then. Help me or shoot me. Make a decision. Make a decision. I made a decision when I met you, Ben. Now, why don't you show me what you have in your file. -Sir! -Congressman! Sir, do you have a statement for us tonight? ...was exceptionally clear and simple. A stronger, safer, more profitable world through incorruptible top-level management. We trust you with our technology and suddenly you turn him into a common hit man. How fucking dare you. I trusted you with my son. You didn't even ask us... Don't lecture me! You swore to me that this was fail-safe. No leaks, no glitches, no dreams. Not even a shadow of what was done to Raymond... You needed to ask before you acted. This is not a... Tom Jordan was going to destroy my son and everything I've worked for, and every one of us along with it. And you wanted me to what? -Call a meeting? -Now, look, look, look. In the larger course of history... there are key players... and role players, Senator. Bullshit! This is about my son and the future of this country. I thought we understood each other. I think we do. I think we really do. -Your God is money. -Oh, wait, wait, and yours is? No, no. I'm a believer. I am an optimist. I believe in the future. And people who do, the ones who make history instead of just sitting around watching it, no, they're willing to take the big risks. Yes, I made a decision. Oh, God! Where are all the men anymore? My father, Tyler Prentiss, never asked, "ls this okay? Is this okay?" You know what I'm saying, Mark? He just did what needed to be done. Come on, rise and shine, New York. it's a big day in the Big Apple. That's right. All polls indicate that New Yorkers will be turning out in record numbers today across the five boroughs to select a new president. At least, that's how the billboard says it's supposed to happen. The polls open at 6 a.m. And bars and taverns in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island will be opening shortly thereafter That's right, New Yorkers. We are free to drink and vote all day today. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for coming out. Congressman, good luck. -Hello. -Hi. Raymond! Raymond! -Hey. Thank you very much. -The next vice president, sir. I hope so. -Let's have a win. -We're with you. We're with you. Thank you, Tony, take care. Thank you. Take care. Goodbye. Thanks very much. Good luck. It's clean. It's clean. It's all right, Evan. How's your back? I've been having the dreams, Ben. Oh, that's good. They're inside my head. We'll get them out. I got the proof. I know what they did to us. I just don't know why. I dream things, Ben. Terrible things that can't possibly have happened. -I'm gone, Ben... -No, you're not, you're right here. Ben, there's something I want you to have. I don't deserve this. Jocelyn's dead. I know. And the senator. Yeah. Did I... I think so, Raymond, yes. I don't remember, Ben. I don't remember. Raymond, did they tell you what it is they want you to do? That's what I gotta find out. We gotta find out what's gonna happen, where it's gonna happen... Are we friends, Ben? I wanna believe we were friends. We are connected and that's something nobody can take from us. You could've had me locked up, but you didn't. That's proof that there's something deep inside. There's a part that they can't get to. And it's deep inside of us. And that's where the truth is. That's our only hope. That's what you and me need to tap into, and that's what you and I are gonna use to take them out, Raymond. We don't have much time. Please. -I thought you were smarter than that. -Raymond, please. You don't think they saw this coming, Ben? You don't think they factored you in? I am the enemy, Major Marco. What are you talking about? Yes, Mother. Yes, he's right here. -She wants you. -Me? Yes, Senator. -ls this Captain Marco? -Yeah . Captain Bennett Marco? Yes. Bennett Ezekiel Marco. Yes. Listen. Hurry up! Major Marco? Ben? ...people can get together whenever they want and not get in trouble. People should be allowed to say what is on their mind... The Bill of Rights gives people... Thank you. The candidates made ritual trips to the voting booths today. Governor Arthur; casting his ballot in North Platte, will spend election night in the Big Apple with running mate Raymond Shaw for their anticipated victory party. The presidential rival, incumbent Vice President Nelson returned to his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He attended special church services this morning... -All clear. -Raymond, -Clear. -listen. The bullet will strike Bob Arthur the moment you step forward and arrive on your star beside him. Because the assassin... the deranged, obsessed, tragically paranoid lone gunman, is trying to kill you. Major Marco's an excellent marksman. But you must stay very, very still and stand right where you're supposed to stand. What happens to Ben? The assassin always dies, baby. It's necessary for the national healing. I'm sure you will never entirely comprehend this, darling. But I want you to know, Raymond... I did this for you. So that you could have what I couldn't. What your father threw away. The opportunity to lead this nation. -I know, Mother. -And so I let them take you and change you a little bit. Not so much that you would notice, but just enough to bring you back to who you really are. And to what you will become. Oh, and look at you. Look at you. Look what you've achieved, look how far we've come. It's working, Raymond. And you're going to save our country now. In the hour of her greatest need. Yes, Mother. But... But when you smile... Oh, darling, when you smile, that's what I live for. When you smile. Well, it's official. CBS News now projects Robert Arthur and Raymond Shaw to be the next president and vice president of the United States. With at least 270 electoral votes and support of almost 70% of votes tallied tonight. Arthur and running mate Raymond Shaw are leading in all but one remaining race, in the sitting vice president's home state of Louisiana. Wait, Jimmy. Jimmy, wait. -Wait. No. Go back. Can you go back? -Yeah. -Stop. -Sure. -Now, can you zoom in on that guy? -Yep. No, no, Jimmy, the other one. The one in the back. The one in the shades. -This one? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Never mind. Thanks, Jimmy. Arthur! That's right! Arthur! Arthur! -We did it. Wow. -Yeah! All right! Yes! -YES. -Hi. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Arthur! Arthur! Let's have a good show, people. Let's have a really good show, okay? Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Cue screens. Very good. Stand by with the first music cue. Now, music. Okay. Damn it. Shaw missed his first position. AOP! AOP! Up there! Ben! Ben! All right. Bye. The FBI has just released security footage of the assassin of Raymond and Eleanor Prentiss Shaw entering the hotel two hours before the fatal shooting. Authorities have identified the gunman as Klaus Bachmann. Bachmann was believed to have been killed in a car bomb explosion in Chechnya four years ago. He was employed there as a covert operation specialist by Global Endeavours, a UK subsidiary of the equity fund giant Manchurian Global. A second former Manchurian Global civilian contractor was taken into custody by federal agents at Chicago 's O'Hare Airport early this morning. Laurence Tokar made news during the Gulf War for his presence on Raymond Shaw's famed Lost Patrol. Tokar was missing in action after the ambush that resulted in Shaw being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour Authorities are exploring additional connections between the two men. Still reeling from the recent tragic loss of Senator Thomas Jordan, Congress has already announced a far-reaching investigation into Jordan's death, in an effort to learn if it is in any way related to the Shaw assassinations. In a supercharged encounter moments ago, president-elect Arthur.. I remember running. I had to... get out... to where the sky was. And had to... get to the water. Escape. Regroup. Come back, get my men. I thought that if I could just get to the water... everything would be okay. If I could just get to the water. Now, when you're rescued and returned with your patrol to command headquarters, what will be among the first of your duties that you'll undertake? I 'll recommend Sergeant Shaw for the Medal of Honour; sin He saved our lives. He terminated the enemy. Led us across the desert to safety. Excellent. And there were casualties? There 's always casualties in wan sin ? (Wilhelmina) I Can Make This Whole Thing Go Away. (Alexis) And What's It Going To Cost Me?

If It's Cool Then I'll Come And Get You. Ten Minutes. Um, Okay. I Guess I'll Just Wait Here. Oh, Okay. All Right. Why Are You Doing This Anyway? Excuse Me? There Are People Here Who Take This Really Seriously, Like Getting This Part Could Change Their Life. I Don't Go Down To The Football Field Because I Feel Like Giving Ball Tossing A Try. You're Just Mad I'm Good. Doubt It. This Is Good... That's All You Got? (Scoffs) Not Bad. All Right, But Not This... Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. All Right, All Right. Save It For The Stage, Okay?

I'm Feeling The Tension. What? I Can't Believe Wilhelmina Slater Uses A Dating Service. Well, Marc Doesn't Fulfill All Of My Needs. God Knows He's Given It The Old College Try. Well, I Guess It Just Shows You Everyone Gets Lonely. I'm Not Lonely. I'm Horny. Ahem. Your First Course Is Oysters On The Half Shell. They're An Aphrodisiac, Not That You Need One. Now Can I Bring You Two Some Wine? Dear God, Yes. Yeah. Keep It Coming. Hey. They Went With The Short Kid. Come Here. They're Idiots. "Billy Elliot" Is Dead To Me. Yeah, Anybody Can Do That Silly Choreography. You--You Make It Your Own. (Snaps Fingers) Hey, Why Don't We Go And Get Some Ice Cream To Cheer You Guys Up? Okay. I'm Gonna Get My Bag. Meet You Outside. All Right. Are You Okay? Go Away. Could You Pass The-- No. I Hope You Didn't Fill Up Because You're Not Done Yet. Why? How Many Courses Are There? Eight. (Sighs) I Know.

Okay, Okay, Okay. Don't Panic. This Happens, Like, Every Other Cruise. But Just As A Precaution, The Captain's Heading Back To Shore. Aw. Check Our Name. (Man) Check Again. Taxi! Betty. I'm So Sorry It Took So Long. Wait. You're Not Leaving, Are You? Kimmie, I've Been Waiting Out Here For 45 Minutes. I Mean, It's Been Fun, But I Think I've Had Enough. But You Can't Go. We Haven't Even Talked Yet. (Scoffs) Kimmie, I Don't Understand You. One Minute You're Like, "Hey, Let's Hang Out," And The Next You're Ditching Me And Sharing "Too Hard To Explain" Jokes. Look, We Don't Have To Be Friends. Just Don't Pretend We Are If We're Not. No, No. We Are Friends. I Swear. That's Why I Got Amanda And Marc In, So We Could Ditch Them. Really? Yeah, Totally. We're Getting Out Of Here. I've Got Us Lined Up For Three More Clubs And A Couple After Hours. Oh, I Don't Know. What About Work Tomorrow? We'll Be Exhausted. Not If We Go In Late. Daniel And Wilhelmina Have A Meeting At The Design Studio Until Noon. They'll Never Even Know We're Gone. It'll Be Fun. Getting Into These Places Is So New For The Both Of Us. Let's Do It Together. Come On. We're Friends, Aren't We? Yeah. Let's Go. It'll Be So Much Fun. I Will Never Forget. Nico Was 4, And I Was Leaving For The Black And White Ball, And She Threw Up All Over Armani-- The--The Man, Not The Gown. See, That's What I Want. I Mean, Not That Exactly, But The Memories, The Perspective It Gives You. I Know You Think You Have To Have Kids Right Away, But 2 Months With A 12 Year Old Is Not The Same As Having A Baby. I Know. So What You Should Do Is Take All The Time You Need To Prepare. I Mean, Lords Knows I Screwed Up With Nico, Not Being Ready. Well, Maybe You'll Handle Things Differently With This Baby. I Hope So. I Mean, It Wouldn't Hurt To Hedge My Bets And Try To Find A Partner. Well, As Much As I'm Sure Me And The Baby And The Nanny Will Make A Happy Household, I... There's Room For One More Person. Yeah. So... Any Idea How The Hell We're Gonna Handle Things With Both Of Us In Charge? Well, I Hate To Admit It, But We Did Make A Good Team Tonight. (Laughs) Yeah. Maybe, Um, We Should Start Trusting Each Other. No Offense, But I'd Say Trusting You Would Be Making A Rookie Mistake. Touch? Perhaps We All Have Our Pasts To Overcome. But Maybe With Time, You'll See That I Can Change. Wait. That's Not Your Building. Um, I Called A "Buddy." While I Certainly Have Long-Term Goals, I Also Have Short-Term Needs. H... (Clears Throat, Coughs) Hello? Betty, Is Everything Okay? Daniel, What Time Is It? Uh, 10:00. My Meeting Canceled. (Gasps) Where Are You? Oh, My God. I'm So Sorry. I'll Be There In A Jif. Actually, You Know What? Kimmie's Here. Kimmie's There? She Can Cover For You. Well, Can I Talk To-- I'm Here! I'm Here! I'm Here. I'm Here. I'm Here. I'm Here. I'm Here. Betty, Look, There's Pictures From Us Last Night All Over The Internet. That's A Picture Of You And My Elbow. Yeah, But You Can Totally Tell It's You. Hi. Well, Here's One Bright Spot This Morning. You Got "Mode" Onto "Page Six." We Haven't Been There In Ages. Good Work. Nice Of You To Join Us. Well, I... Darn. You Got Cut Out Of That One. Kimmie, What About Our Pact? Well, I Was An Idiot To Think That I Could Sleep In When You Have Total Seniority Over Me, So I Covered For You. I Texted You. Um, I Didn't Get A Text. That's Weird. I Sent One. Nope. No Text Here. Well, It Must Have Gotten Lost. (Christina) She's Lying. I Should Have Known Something Was Up When She Ordered Me That Second Long Island Iced Tea. Mm. By The Way, Not Tea. What Is She Trying To Do, Take Your Job? No Way. She Would Never Want To Work That Hard. Kimmie's Just Always Drawn Her Power From Making Me Look Bad So She Looks Good. Ugh. There's No Chance That Text Got Lost, Right? Well, I Texted You Five Times This Morning, And You Got Every Single One Of Those. You May Have Graduated, But High School Never Ends. Oh, My God. Look How Tiny I Am. You're Still Tiny. Oh, I Know. What Are You Guys Looking At? Oh, I Wanted To Show Them My Cheerleading Pictures, So I Brought In Our High School Yearbook. Wait. You Have To See This One. (Gasps) (Amanda Gasps) Oh, My God. Hello, Perm. It's Like Someone Deep-Fried Your Hair. (Gasps) And She's Wearing The Same Thing In Her Chess Club Picture As She Is Today. Oh! Well, It Was A Rough Morning. Then Or Now? Don't Worry. I'm Embarrassed, Too. I Mean, My Skirts Are Crazy Short. (Amanda) Mm, So Short. Hey, Betty, Since You're Up, Would You Mind Getting Me A Water, Please? Yeah, Sure. (Amanda) Oh, God. Betty, You Have Something On Your Skirt. (Gasps) You've Got Something On Your Skirt. Hmm? Not Again! (Gasps) What? What--What Are You Looking At? She Was-- About To Do That To Me. She Did It Back In High School. Tell Them. They Called Me "Granny Pants" For Four Years. I Thought We Were Friends. We Are. We Are Friends, Kimmie. I Just Thought That-- I Thought That You Were Gonna... I'm Sorry. Come On. La Perla? Hanky Panky. Oh, They're Totally Hot. Yeah. Granny Pants. Sexy Pants. (Chuckles) ? Hey. Hey. Bummer About The Audition, Man. I Can't Believe They Picked The Short Guy Over Us. Right? No One's Gonna Be Able To See Him. Our Vocals Were Way Better. And Our Dance Wasn't That Bad. Well, You Were Kind Of Popping Your Hip. Well, At Least My Jazz Squares Weren't Triangles. Maybe We'll Hang Out Sometime. Yeah, Uh, That'd Be Cool. We'll Work It Out. Okay. Bye. I've Got Your Lunch. A Turkey Sandwich And A Slice Of Chocolate Cake. Oh, Dessert. Someone's In Suck-Up Mode. Look, Daniel, I'm So Sorry About Being Late This Morning. You Know That's Not Me. Betty, Look, Your Night Out Wasn't Such A Bad Thing. All Those Photos Of "Kimmie From 'Mode'" Are Great Publicity. Really? Hey. Didn't We Used To Have Someone Who Worked For Us Whose Job Was Just To Go Out And Get "Mode's" Name In The Tabloids? She Was So Great Until She Went To Rehab. I Bet Kimmie Could Do That Job. I Don't Know. No, Look. Look At How Many Clubs She Got Us Into Last Night. I Have Never Seen Anyone Work A Room Like Her. She Got George Clooney To Come To Our Darfur Benefit. We Don't Do A Darfur Benefit. We Do Now. George Clooney's Coming. I'm Telling You, Daniel, She Would Be Great. I Guess A Little Buzz Never Hurt. I'll Think About It. Great. Oh, My God. I Almost Forgot To Ask You. How Was Your Date? Uh, Well, It Started Out Rough, But It Ended Up In A Good Place. Yay! Are You Gonna Go Out Again? No. But I'll Probably Run Into Her Somewhere. Now Moving On To The Elusive Center Spread. Puppies Or War? We Want You To Know We Really Appreciate Your Hard Work. We Assure You This Is All Gonna Be Settled Very Soon. Well, Actually, It Is Settled. It Is? Love Is A Battlefield. I Think We Both Know How True That Is, And I'm Sorry That It Took Me So Long To See It. We'll... Ahem. Get That Started Right Away. Uh, One More Bit Of Good News. Most Of You Have Had A Chance To Meet Kimmie Keegan By Now Or At Least Seen Her Photos On "Page Six." Whoo! From Now On, She's Gonna Make Sure That "Mode's" Name Is Associated With All The Coolest Events. Wilhelmina And I Are Promoting Her To Associate Editor. (Man) You Did It, Girl. We Totally Knew. Wow. That's A Big Promotion. Yeah, It Was Your Idea. I Know, But... Associate Editor? Well, If Kimmie's Gonna Be In The Public Eye, She Needs A Better Title Than "'Mode' Temp," Right? Besides, It's Just A Title. It's Okay. (Woman) I'm So Excited For You. Thank You. (Woman) We'll Talk To You Later, Okay? (Kimmie) Okay. Kimmie. Congratulations. You're Perfect For This. I Know, Right? I'm Gonna Need Some Coffee. Half-Caf Sumatra Soy, 121 Degrees. I'm Not Kidding. I'm Myself Again. Ever Since You've Been Helping Me, My Confidence Has Been Creeping Back In. I Should Thank You. Oh. But I Won't, Because I'm Popular, And Popular People Aren't Nice To Unpopular People. It's Just The Natural Order Of Things. I'm Still Waiting On That Coffee... Granny Pants. Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Please do NOT hardsub and/or stream this episode using our English subtitles. It looks like everyone has some sort of a handicap. But you must continue to have the yearning for the passion of music. I have high hopes for it. Then... I'll just end it here. From now on, it's all up to you. There was no need of you to pretend to be kind when you are going to end it like this. We are pitiful people with no money, time and abilities. Then are we supposed to go and die? Commoners are not supposed to dab in arts? Who's the one who made this rule? Lots of geniuses would have been tortured to death if you were a conductor at those times. You self-conceited fellow! That's why I don't like Mozart. Teacher, he was a genius. Come on, let's do the public performance. You and the Maestro Kang rascal, get mentally prepared. I'll make sure that your public performance gets really exciting. It's not really important to be able to keep with the tempo or tuning the sound. Sooner or later these will come naturally after practicing. What's most important are the emotions I want to emit to the audience. The heart... The feeling... I've found the feelings already. Of course, you would be a fool if you can't feel it by now. Nice cue. Maestro Kang, the great! The orchestra is a fake, right? Du Ru Mi lost the three million won? Episode 4 The three of them made me drink a lot without stopping last night. I didn't realize it at that time. You really drank a lot. You drank so much last night. You think that I'm like this now because of the wine? Our Seok Ran Music City project... I know, I know... What's that now? Is that music? What music is that boring? Switch it off immediately. I'll be Secretary Kim if I drink tonight again. There's a really strong smell of wine. Are you already congratulating each other on the disgrace of the Seok Ran Orchestra? How much do you know? She was planning a public performance, but she was conned out of 300 million won. So, she gathered anyone who's ever touched an instrument, a flute or harmonica. That's pretty much all that I know. Why didn't you tell it to me earlier? They threatened to kill my dog. And wanted to change the conductors half-way by getting an ordinary trumpeter to conduct. I don't know whether it was to save her own face or not. She thinks that the trumpeter is the most suitable conductor. And even said that practicing happily is her biggest goal... What a daring girl! Du Ru Mi... You did so many things without even letting me know? I'm really very sorry towards you. I'm apologizing in her place. Sorry. Forget it since everything has now already ended this way. So you're quitting? I'll be leaving today. Why are you still standing there in a daze? Send him off quickly. You drove an outside car here, right? Please let me put our seal on the parking coupon. That's right, you must start saving money. Since you're going getting fired soon, eating on an empty mountain is only seconds away. Hello... Yes, Teacher Jung Myung Hwan. That's right, the mayor has been waiting for you all morning. I'll now transfer you to him. Mayor, it's Jung Myung Hwan. Oh my, Jung Myung Hwan. Why did you call me up personally? It's an honor to get a call from Maestro Jung. Yes. You ended your schedule. Oh, that's a great relief. You'll be coming here personally. I really don't know what to say. Oh, we will meet then. I'll clear my whole schedule for the day. See you then. Teacher, let's go. Sir, did you leave anything behind? Were you just on the line with Conductor Jung Myung Hwan? Yes, since you've resigned, our Secretary Kim recommended him to me immediately. I'll find someone else. They'll all be better than Jung Myung Hwan, no matter which one of them. But Teacher, Jung Myung Hwan is the best right now. I'll be choosing my own replacement. You need a person that will follow my interpretations and style. Jung Myung Hwan can't do it. By your form of style is... do you mean by being an Orchestra Killer? I had already grown more suspicious after this incident. So I stayed up the whole night to research more about you. Secretary Kim, bring it here. You were recognized as a top grade conductor overseas. But you couldn't to stay with the same Orchestra for more than 6 months. You're a perfectionist that is respected the most by the professional performers. But then they pay a price for it. You're very demanding of their skills. You made a Viola player a cripple. You even made an internationally awarded tuba player completely give up on music. Would our orchestra be able to cope with such a fastidious person? The person who'll succeed you is a 'no' from you as well. We're really sorry about it. Then what about Teacher Jung Myung Hwan? Isn't he the same too? How dare you open your mouth when you messed up things like this! There's already a successful case for Teacher Jung Myung Hwan. The Italians who hadn't learned to play instruments before... where was that? Wait, let's see. He taught kids on the isolated island of Sicily and had a successful public performance. So Sicily is considered an isolated island, even with a population of over 500,000 people. Is that so? Anyway, I'm just putting out a comparison. We don't know that it'll work out even if Teacher Jung Myung Hwan were to come. I just felt that it had been hard on you during this time. So I wanted to let you relax without any worries. This is green tea. I drink it to sobering up this morning, as my stomach wasn't feeling too well. You better throw it away, since it's been used up. Do you want a cup of green tea? But can Jung Myung use this to make an fine cup of green tea? It's magic. Really great. Luckily there is still some fragrance. Don't worry, it'll work. Then, I'll show you some magic as well. Not with a successor, I'll do it personally. The public performance... Please anticipate it. I say Teacher.. Teacher, but I've already said that Jung Myung Hwan will be taking over. Teacher! Teacher! Hey, you... This isn't good. This won't do. Hey, make sure you tell him clearly what I mean. Why isn't this moving? Teacher, the lift for the even floors is here. How much time do we have left before the public performance? About 2 weeks... 14 days. Delay the public performance as long as you can, gather up all the Orchestra members right now. But, Teacher... Are you really going to be the conductor? Are you still dreaming? What practicing happily? Stop dreaming and wake up. Will you be happy if you ruin the public performance because you want to practice happily? This will become the nightmare of our whole lives. Gather everyone immediately, to the music practice room? No, gather all of them together up on the church's roof top within 20 minutes. Run downstairs! What's the music leader eating alone? Give everyone one each if it's vitamins. As from now on, it's going to be a hard battle. Teacher, it's headache medicine. My head is hurting. Why must you carry a head that isn't sharp and is always hurting you? Throw it away. Mr. Kim Gab Yong. Yes.. You had worked before in Shin Hyang Ri, right? Why did you retired? My age. Did you leave because they told you to leave? And still at your prime of 57. It's the rule. Then why didn't you join another Orchestra after that? My age. That's an excuse. Why didn't you go into the Orchestra after graduating college? There was no place that wanted me. Excuse. Why didn't you go to the music college? I had to work because my father was ill. What about your mother? Your siblings as well? I'm the only child of a three generation family and my mother just knows how to dance. My father was lying in bed. He can't work just because he was sick? He can't cook noodles because he had to rest in bed? But my father is already lying in bed like a child... Why must all these be your concerns? Children, parents, we don't need all of these. You can only think of yourselves! And you, why didn't you go to college? That's right, what can I expect of such an arrogant fellow like you? You must be selfish, all of you are too kind-hearted. No, it's not kindness but foolishness. You sacrificed because of your parents and kids. These are illusions. In the end, look at what you have become. You couldn't do what you wanted and were unable to make a living. You only grew an inferior heart because you sacrificed for them. This is not kindness, not even foolishness but inferiority. You all merely set your hearts on making 100 kinds of excuses... and ran away! From now on, there are no more places to escape to. As you can see, this is the roof top on the edge of a cliff. But then, if there is anyone who feels that they can't do it at all... I will not hold you back, just leave. This is your last chance to run away. But, I've already locked the door over there. You will have to jump down from here if you want to escape. I'll give you all three seconds. One... two... three... No one? Good, it's the choice of everyone, there's no objections right? Well. Today, we will start practicing William Tell's overture. It's a completely different style from last time's carefree and beautiful Nella Fantasia. Everyday for two hours, you have to increase your lung capacity by exercising day and night. Go get a the fitness card and let the fitness instructor design an intensive training for you. Oboe Course? But how... From now on, you'll be going to a trumpet school. You can't just practice at night since there is no time left. From now on, you have to practice all day and night. Quit your job. What? Stop working till the public performance, if not then start by taking leave. It's inconvenient for me to go on leave. Why are you still standing here? There's no time! Run to the practice room. We don't have the key. I'm really sorry. There seems to be a problem with the reed. It's the Contrabass's time to play. Pull the bow apart on that one phrase. And then pull at this position to the 'yi' phrase. And press harder on the string. Yes. Tune the sound base, it seems crooked. Flute... I'm worried about the piano part during the performance. Didn't you have it tuned? I did... The tuning is a little... Close your lips as tightly as you can and then blow hard. Isn't this the piano's part? Shouldn't I be blowing gently if I want the volume to be smaller. It worked. What did you eat for breakfast? Dried Pollack soup. Side-dish? Muskmelon. There could a melon seed in the reed, take it out quickly. What are these expressions? Teacher, you are really cool. Don't any of you have any pride? There wouldn't be any need for me to do this if you were professionals. Never. How can I tell the professionals that even though I'm the conductor... pull the strings like this, tune like that, how can I interfere with your techniques? All of you should feel angry by now. You can't let yourselves grow a heart with no pride. So let's carry on like this. One hundred bow strokes by tomorrow. Public performance piano part a hundred times. Brush your teeth a hundred times after eating. I'll be inspecting. Our Teacher Kim Gab Yong's teeth are all going to be dropping off. Instead of brushing, can he rinse his mouth instead? Do you know why I won't scold you? Because there's no value in it. Let's do it again. What are you trying to do? You can't even get the right notes! There won't be a lunch break, you can practice on an empty stomach. I'll be back again in an hour. Don't come in. Sorry, I came in. I'll be going out soon. There's a conductor room as well, this is really not bad. I thought the conducting would done in the village in some sort of tent. Did the Mayor tell you to come here? Right. And so, you came running here immediately? Do you really have nothing else to do after getting the medal? I don't have anything to do. I'm so bored. Where are the members? There? Where? Let me take a look at their foundation. Shall I take a look at their abilities? Don't go. They are practicing, let them be. I heard that they're all garbage? They're very hardworking. Being hardworking won't be enough. So that's why I said no. Cabaret, ahjummas and old people who are turning sixty. How can this be possible? And it's only 2 more weeks to their public performance. What are 2 weeks? It would be hard even it was 20 years. But you did it, didn't you? Oh, you mean the grade schoolers. Those were only children songs. Although those kids had never learned to play musical instruments, they learned quickly, because kids have no fear. They're pliable and obedient too. It's really cute when kids are performing. Their mistakes are overlooked. But yours are all adults. Do you think their mistakes will be overlooked? Add to that, their hands are already stiff and their minds are firmly set. They think too much and can't make big steps forward because of no confidence. The strange sounds of the Cabaret. That's something that can never be changed, for the rest of one's life. You know it too. Moreover, you don't have the details. What does that mean? Why ask when you know it? Sympathizing... Details... Care and consideration for the members. Considering, "What is that person is thinking?" Just lay out the bare truth after you understand it, and match him. You can't do that. But this is the main core of it. Gun Woo, how does this sounds? Is it still strange? Oh, it sound fine. What's good about it, Rascal? It's still going 'Wang.. Wang'. I won't ask you to conduct, so just tell me how it is. You should be pulling slower, put it slower during the slow tempo? Slowly? That's right, it works. Let's everyone tune up together. What about me? Do I really not have the value to be lectured about? Completely zero, right? Please don't ask me. I won't be interfering again. That means completely out. He wouldn't say anything if you really had no value. Hyung, you are doing really well. I'll ask as well, okay? Me too, me too. What are you doing? Don't come since I won't say anything. Don't go, he is not the conductor right now. Just once. How do I sound? Sit down all of you. - You are fine. - But you were too fast. Me, me, what about me? Perfect.. Miss Kim Joo Hee. This is really urgent. Did I do well? Is it okay to carry on like this? You're not bad, but you need some more confidence. Gun Woo... Your sound is a little off. Kang Gun Woo! How was I? Where do I need to fix? There're not just one or two places he needs to change. Hyung knows it well. You must praise them from time to time. They are just amateurs. You need to soothe them like a mother soothing her child. Are you able to do that? You can't do it, right? It's just that our styles are different. That's right, no one is saying anything. That's why remember the story, he was on a church youth group. He was on a roller coaster ride. His hat blew off. After the ride was over, he's like, "I'm gonna go get my hat." and there was a big fence with signs on it that probably said, "Hey, cut your losses." And he's like, "What? "Have you seen me in that hat? Not today, fence." And he went over it. And there was a second fence with more signs. Like, "Come on, knock it off." He's like, "You can't tell me how to live, signs." And he went over that fence. And on the other side, the story ends. Did he get the hat? I'd like to think he did. Right? A small silver lining. Like, "I told you I'd get it." And then whack, right then. And I know he was on a church youth group, and they don't believe in evolution, but that kid was getting picked off sooner or later. Yeah. And if I were a family member, I'd say 15 years was a pretty good run. But then again, I'm half full. The real story, which nobody talks about until now, is how he was decapitated. It was a suspension roller coaster. a young lady, 25 years old, her leg is what decapitated him. Shattered her leg in over eight places. She had to have three surgeries and wear a cast for over a year. I don't know if you've ever worn a cast or not, but everybody and their mother will come up to you and be like, "How'd you break your leg?" She gets to be like, "I fucking punted a guy's head "90 yards. Yeah. Top that, Janikowski." Oh, finally a raider reference that doesn't involve sucking. People have always told me I have a sick sense of humor. What do you say to that? I assume it's relative. Who are you comparing me to? Carrot top? Then, yeah, I'm a little blue. To my circle of friends, I'm tame. My sister's off the charts. I play practical jokes on her constantly, though. I got her so good a few weeks ago. I replaced her pepper spray with silly string. Anyway, that night, she got raped, and she called me the next day, going, "You son of a bitch. "You got me so good. "No, no, no, no, as soon "as I started spraying him in the face. "I'm like, 'Daniel. this is gonna really hurt.'" Hot pocket. That's how that joke ends. I had another comic friend of mine finish it. I hate rain. I understand the necessity for it. But when I walk outside, I prefer it to be sunny. That's why I love California so much. Oh, and I think it's because I wear a 35 inseam when I'm clearly a 34. But I've always liked my pants long in the back. I like 'em to hit the ground, naturally fray over time, but when it rains, oh. Am I right? The fray gets wet, then the pant leg goes up much higher than anything I ever stepped in. I just look down. I'm like, aagh! Is this what the people in New Orleans went through? Because this is awful. Had I known it was that bad, maybe I would have helped. Next time, 'Trina 2, I'm your savior. Do they name storms like sequels in movies? Because they should. "'Trina 2: God's still crying." You want help, don't invest in property value that's below sea level. You're welcome. People always assume I'm a bleeding-heart liberal. What? I'm conservative on almost all the key issues. I hate the poor. I've said that forever. "We need help." Yeah, we've heard. And some of you know I have a charity, but I did that for tax purposes. If you're not familiar with it, it's called febrezing the homeless. No, it's not what some of you think. What I do, I go around, and I febreze homeless people. Is that what you thought it was? Well, this isn't a game show. It's nice. Who would you give a dollar to? The guy that smells like liquid garbage or ocean breeze? It's a no-brainer. You're gonna make it rain on number two. Make it rain. "Thank you, rap community, for continuing to keep women in their place," he said with heavy sarcasm. If you don't know, it's when you throw cash on the hos. I came up with my own expression. I like to make it hail. Yeah, that's when you throw change on sluts. "Ow! Are those nickels?" "Yeah. It's a down economy. I'm a baller on a budget, bitch." You see that? You see that? Keep an open hand. That'll keep you out of prison. I don't know if that's true... just in case anybody goes home tonight and decides to beat the shit out of their-- "I kept an open hand. Your honor, the comedian clearly stated..." Some issues I go a little left on. I heart abortion. Fine. Where's that t-shirt, urban outfitters? I'll buy one. Large, preshrunk, cotton-poly blend, overpriced, but very soft. Just says "I heart abortion." Not a regular heart, an unborn fetus heart that has been vacuumed out. Look at it. What, it's okay for them to stick it on a poster board, shove it into some kid's face that's making the toughest decision of her life, but i embrace it and I'm the a-hole? Got it. What's the back of the shirt say? "Problem solved." It says, "Go back to being selfish. "Your life's not over just yet. "Don't have to take all those failed dreams and cram 'em down somebody else's throat." Back of the shirt's long. People may bump into you, like, "Sorry, I was reading that horrible shirt. Where are you headed?" "Sarah Palin's house." Speaking of awful parents, Joe Jackson deserves a lifetime achievement award. Holy cow. I like when people acted shocked that Michael died. Are you kidding me? Michael was on borrowed time as soon as he switched races. Don't act so sad over his death. Are you kidding? There's a reason-- There's a reason his reunion tour was in London. Nobody in America wants to watch a 50-year-old man scoot backwards. I was making love to this girl recently. Let's say she's 19. There's no bouncer in my bedroom. You're in. She says to me during the act of lovemaking, "Hey, Daniel, what's it like having sex with a condom on?" I'm like, "How should i know?" I didn't say that. We need time machines. What I said was way less romantic. I said, "Oh. it's a lot like picking up dog shit with a bag," Which I thought then and think now is a spot-on analogy. Like, you know there's dog poo in your hand, but you don't freak out. Sometimes when I'm out at night and I see a group of women, I like to walk up to 'em and pretend that I'm a judge at a dog show. And I just go, "Mm. "Third, second, first... in that order!" They love it. They want to be judged. They spend a lot of time getting ready. There's not a girl in here that wouldn't like to go home tonight with a blue ribbon on. Her friend's like, "Where did you get that ugly ribbon?" "Oh, some guy at the bar thought I won." "Katie didn't even place. I know. It's crazy." If I see a really hot chick, I'll grab her by the crotch and the throat and be like, "Best in show." Little heavy. Should have picked one from the toy group. Big can be beautiful, okay? Just not to me. I find you disgusting. Freshman 15's not a life sentence. Okay? We're too fat. We're just too fat. I was on a plane recently that was delayed over three hours at the gate because they ran out of seat-belt extensions. Do you even know what seat-belt extensions are? Seat belts only go this big. Some people need an extra 6 1/2 feet of nylon to strap in, as if any collision would unwedge them. I love that the modeling industry gets attacked for being too skinny. Really, America? You're not too big? Mm-mm. Is something in your mouth? Mm-mm. Do you know why they say that-- that models are too skinny? It's because parents are horrible. They can't tell their 16-year-old daughter that she's not really a princess. Well, guess what. I can. If you're 16 years old and you think the only difference between you and Gisele is your waistline and not your busted face... Here's some advice-- fill up the paxil, because life is gonna be really sad. If you're walking around like, "Well, why am I not a supermodel yet?" Who are you even looking at, seabiscuit? "Oh, I want to be a model." Do you want me to explain it to you? Let's start with your jawline. That's not gonna sell a lot of makeup in the magazines. "But i'm skinny." You are a troll. My advice, have a twinkie, get real good at math, because life is not gonna be easy for you. I'm sorry if this is your wake-up call, but being an ugly woman is like being a man. You're gonna have to work. Yep. Thank you very much, you guys. Thank you. thanks for coming out. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Oh!

Hair buns! two for 10! , I can't believe it! I know! Who wants a bun if it and frosting on it? on No, I was talking about next to the bun cart. Hey, she looks just like Miss Nancy from Miss Nancy's Fancy Dance Academy. Yes. Probably because it is Miss Nancy from Miss Nancy's Fancy Dance Academy. Oh! Excuse me. Hi. Um, I just wanted to say hi and tell you what a huge impact you've had on my life. Oh, did you join the Bun of the Month Club? Well, next month just came in. Spoiler alert, it's braided! No, I'm Rocky Blue. You were my first dance teacher. Oh! Thank you, Rocky. Look how tall you've gotten. Hey, guys, look. I'm that princess chick from that movie all those old people like. And CeCe! You haven't changed at all. Oh, thank you, Miss Nancy. Because of you, we're now dancing on Shake It Up, Chicago! How are things at the academy? Oh, not so good. The studio is on the verge of closing and I'm just desperately trying to make ends meet by working at a mall cart. Hair buns! One for six! Two for 10! I'll even throw in a free bottle of hair spray! I don't understand. Is business bad? Oh, no, but I had an opportunity to buy the building. Well, I have a $3,000 balloon payment and the building is upside down. Wow, even I know an upside down building is bad for business. Wow, CeCe, you really haven't changed. (CHUCKLES) Welcome to my world. We'll take two buns, please. Here you go. Thank you. Um... Bye! Thank you. I cannot believe that Miss Nancy's Fancy Dance Academy is going out of business. It's so sad. Because of Miss Nancy, we became dancers. And best friends. You know what? We owe Miss Nancy. We're going to save that dance studio! How are we going to do that? I don't know, but you can bet your buns we're going to. Yo, dude, check it out. I just got the coolest new app for my phone. The one that shows what you look like as a girl? Got it! Check it out. I'm hot! I'm just going to ignore that and move on. This one's called Bump It, Baby. You can record your own music and share it with friends by bumping. Oh, cool. Let me get one of your new raps. What... What the heck was that? I was bumping you for your song. You thought we would bump hips and music would magically trade in our phones? Sure, now it sounds stupid. If you broke my new YOphone... Would you relax? Okay? It's totally fine. Everyone knows a YOphone is practically indestructible. Okay, watch. (GLASS CRACKING) Okay, now it's broken. Hey, how's our bake sale going? Really good. "Save Miss Nancy's Fancy Dance Academy, "$16 a cupcake." Are you crazy? Who is going to spend that much on a cupcake? Actually, I've already sold two dozen. Oh, and by the way, I may or may not have included a kiss from you for that price. (LAUGHS) I'm kidding! Maybe. Oh, look, Tinka. The fruitcakes are selling cupcakes! This happens to be a fundraiser. Well, if you're trying to earn money to see a good dermatologist I'll take one for each of your poorly-concealed pimples. I'll take four. Ooh, no, five. Guys, this is not a joke. We're trying to help Miss Nancy, the woman who taught us how to dance. Help her? She should be imprisoned for her crimes against humanity. And the arts. Seriously, please stop. We're not kidding. No, but Miss Nancy is kidding herself if she thinks she taught the two of you how to dance. You know what? That's it. I'm sick and tired of you guys always being so mean. We're trying to do a nice thing here, but you two wouldn't understand because there's nothing sweet about you. So button it, or else... Ooh, I'm so scared! What is a little girl running a bake sale going to do? A pie to the face? So cliche. Besides, you don't have the cupcakes to do it. You're right. She doesn't. (GASPS) But I do! That'll be $32, please. Mmm, revenge is sweet. Well, according to the guy at the YOphone store, your friend repeatedly banging your phone on the table is not covered by the insurance plan. Dude, I feel awful. Could you do me a favor and stop bringing it up? Thanks to you, I'm stuck using my Grandma's old phone. That's a phone? There's no screen. How do you text? Watch videos? Listen to music? Get on the Internet? You don't. It just makes calls. Who uses a cell phone to make calls? There's gotta be another way to get a new phone. I know. In case you hadn't noticed, you're done! Well, then. We're winning you a new phone. Check it out. All we have to do is enter the contest and be the last ones standing with a phone in between us. I don't know. If I'm going to spend a whole day holding hands with someone, it's not gonna be you. Come on, man, let me win you a new phone. (PHONE RINGING) What is that? Excuse me, I gotta take this. What? Hello? Hey, Grandma. Yeah, it's working. What? Grandma? Hold on, bad reception. Hello? Yeah. I got you. Okay, hold on. Here we go. Okay. Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? (STUTTERING) There you go. Got you, Grandma. No way! We're still $1,500 short. Even after selling all our old clothes, putting in all the money from the bake sale and all of our savings. Don't make me feel bad about the refunds. I don't care how many cupcakes Petey Goldfeder bought. I was not kissing him. Guess this is the end of Miss Nancy's Fancy Dance Academy. No! There's absolutely no way I'm going to accept that. There's got to be something left we can sell. Well, there's still our Beyonce tickets. Okay, looks like this is the end of Miss Nancy's Fancy Dance Academy. Hey, do you remember that silent auction that Gary was involved in? Yeah, the one that was silent 'cause nobody bid on him. Yeah. Maybe he can auction off an afternoon with us. Oh! Okay, let's do that. Excuse me, Gary. See, we're raising money to save our old dance school and we were hoping you could auction off an afternoon with CeCe and Rocky at the mall show on Saturday. Let me think about it. No. But, Gary, we're talking about the woman who started our dance careers. Sorry, but this is an official Shake It Up, Chicago! and YOphone event. You can't use it for your own personal needs. Gary, does Shake It Up, Chicago! know you're getting a little pay-off from this YOphone event? Five, 10, 25, 75, 85, 95! Sold! How did you know? Hmm, I don't know. Five, 10, 25... (BABBLING) I guessed. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Let's hear it for our dancers! All right. Now, let's check in with our remaining "Two Hands on a YOphone" contestants. Oh! That's gotta hurt. But the YOphone calling package won't hurt your wallet. Only 40 bucks a month. Unless you're me. Then it's free. But shh! And now, one lucky bidder is going to get an entire afternoon with two of Shake It Up, Chicago! 's best dancers and shakedown artists, Rocky and CeCe. What if no one actually bids on us? Don't worry. I already thought of that. Okay, let's open the bidding. Do I hear $100? One hundred dollars for a great cause. I bid $100! You got $100 to spend on hanging out with Rocky and CeCe and you couldn't just buy me a new phone? Would you relax, okay? I'm only getting the bidding started. I'm a plant! What kind? A dill weed? Do I see 150? 150! (WHISPERS) Yes! I'm looking for two, 200? Two hundred from the pretty lady who should ask for my number when we're done! Do I hear three? Three hundred? Thank you, three hundred! From the man in the purple shirt with the sweat stains. You may put your hand down now. Do I hear four? 400 for a great cause? Three hundred going once. Four hundred dollars! No... Do I hear five? Five hundred dollars from the same bidder! Now, there's a man who cares about dance. Dude, you better watch that hand. Five hundred going once, going twice... BOY: One thousand dollars! (ALL GASPING) Thank you! Do I hear 1,100? Yes! 1,100! BOY: $1,500! Sold! Sold to the bidder for $1,500! Congratulations to the winning bid of $1,500! Not as chocolaty as two cupcakes shoved in your face, but just as surprising, no? All right, as soon as Gunther and Tinka pay us the ms we'll have the $3,000 we need for Miss Nancy. We did it! Yes! We did it! We did it! Hey, why do you think they spent all that money to buy us at the auction? Well, they walk around wearing 30 pounds of sequins and glitter. Who knows why they do anything? I'm just glad we didn't have to sell our Beyonce tickets. Yeah, we should get going. I want to be the first one in the last row. Hello, babies. (GUNTHER CHUCKLING) What are you two doing here? We spent a lot of money for an afternoon with Rocky and CeCe. Yes, but not this afternoon. We're going to see Beyonce. We've been looking forward to this for months. It's either this afternoon or forget the money we owe you. Hey, wait a minute. You're only doing this to get even with us for embarrassing you at school. Oh, look, Gunther. Someone had a big bowl of smarty-puffs this morning. Klaus! This is our little cousin, Klaus. Babysit him and your Miss Nancy will no longer have to sell her hairy buns at the mall. Why, hello, Rocky and CeCe. Thank you for welcoming me into your wonderful home. Pleased to make your acquaintance. BOTH: Aw! We'll be back in a few hours after the Beyonce concert. What! Goodbye to all the single ladies. Good luck. I mean, have fun. No, I mean good luck. Well, if we're gonna have to miss Beyonce, we might as well spend the time with a little cutie. Can I watch Jersey Hills? Oh, no sweetie. We don't want you copying those kids' bad behavior. Plus, we're not allowed to watch it either. Okay, let's play a game. Oh, fine, we'll play. (KICKING) Ow! What the heck kind of game is that? It's called Kick You in the Shins. Okay, how about we try a new game? Okay, how about... Ow! (WHIMPERING) Kick the Other One in the Shins! How do you like that, babies? I told you not to drink that 84-ounce chug-a-lug! Well, excuse me if I believe proper hydration is important to a growing body. It took six months to save up for that phone and two seconds for you to break it. If we drop this phone because of all your moving around, I'm gonna drop you in that fountain over there. Man, I can't help it. I have to go really bad. Like the blizzard of '09 bad. Oh. You mean like the time when you spelled your whole name and address in the snow? Yeah, that was pretty impressive. You just peed and peed... Would you stop talking about it, already! Relax. There's a bathroom break in 10 minutes. Now, focus. I want us to come in number one. Don't say "number one"! Fine, but remember, Deuce, we are a team. We have to work hard if we want to win. (WHIMPERS) Don't forget, Deuce, it's we, we! We, we! Okay, he wasn't in there. And he wasn't in there. How could he just disappear? I don't know. But we've got to find that little Hessen-horror. (BLENDER WHIRRING) How did that happen? I don't know. (STATIC HISSING) Rocky! Okay, relax, relax. I'm sure it was just a power surge. Okay? Okay. (WHISTLING) (WHIMPERS) On second thought... (SCREAMING) It's him! It's Klaus! He must've cut the power! Rocky, I'm afraid of the dark! CeCe, it's still light outside. Oh, he's good. (FOOTSTEPS PATTERING) What was that? I don't know. But... (CRASHING NOISES) (BOTH SCREAMING) Now can I watch Jersey Hills? Itch. Got an itch. Really bad itch. You gotta scratch me, man. Fine. Come on. You gotta do this for me. Okay. Little lower. Little lower. To the left. To the left. To the left. To the right. Oh, that's it. That's the spot right there. Okay, you're done! (SNEEZES) Oh! Oh! We did it! I can't believe we actually won. We have a winner! (CHUCKLES) Hey! Congratulations, what are your names? Oh, well, I'm Deuce Martinez and that's Ty Blue. Yeah. Ty Blue. Are you, by any chance, related to Rocky Blue? Yeah, she's my little sister. Oh, that's too bad. Shake It Up, Chicago! employees and their family members are ineligible to compete. I'm going to have to disqualify you. But you still win. Yeah! I got a YOphone! That's not a YOphone! That's a MYphone! What? All right. He seems calm. He's doing some arts and crafts. Hey, Klaus. Although I'm still not convinced that giving him scissors was a good idea. Oh, I didn't give him the scissors. His tongue shot out of his mouth and grabbed them off the kitchen counter. We're back! Beyonce was great. But your seats were so far away she looked like a dust bunny in a big wig. Yeah, well, Klaus was adorable. Now pay us our $1,500 and get that little shin-kicker out of here. Oh, how nice. You decoupaged a shoe box. What? A shoe box? Our money! ROCKY: What have you done? Your evil little cousin destroyed all the other money we raised. Oh. Did I do something bad? All the work we did was for nothing. This Fancy Nancy really means a lot to you, huh? It's all the money you need for your dance school. What's the catch? There is none. Wow. You guys pretend like you're so mean and hate us, but when push comes to shove... You're actually nice, caring, good friends. Save the violins, Miss Mushy-Pants. Yes, don't get too excited. If you want the money, you have to watch Klaus for the rest of the weekend. Oh, wait. There was a catch. And there's the Gunther and Tinka we know and don't love. Hey, where did Klaus go? (ALL SCREAMING) Relax. We're fine as long as he doesn't have scissors. (ROCKY AND CECE SCREAMING) I can't believe it. You guys saved Miss Nancy's Fancy Dance Academy! I don't know how to thank you. Well, You could start by changing the name and making it easier to say. You know what? It's us who should be thanking you for all you did for us. You know, I still remember our first recital. Oh, me too. You girls were the best itsy bitsy spiders I ever had. Especially you, CeCe. You were the itsiest bitsiest. I still am. All right, what do you guys say? Once for old times' sake? Sure, why not? BOTH: Five, six, seven, eight. ♪ The itsy bitsy spider went up the waterspout Posture, Rocky! You call that rain? That's not rain! Nancy Fancy way! You girls can do better!

Almost done... With the first paragraph. The Grapes of Wrath "sounds like it should a bunch of angry grapes..." It's not. Interesting." less. Okay! Good start, CeCe. Really? Yeah, except for one thing. Reading Of Mice and Men. Oh, great. I read the back of the wrong book. CeCe, turn off the radio so you can focus. They just play too many dumb commercials. And have dreamsce of becoming a professional dancer? Freeze! I do! Do you wanna spend learning dance days from award-winning choreographers? I do! Do you want to meet special guest stars like J. Lo, Shakira, Bieber, or someone with a Bieber-style haircut? I do! Well then, the Big Apple Dance Camp offers all this and much, much more. What are you waiting for? Register online now. We will! Well, here's one thing they forgot to mention. The camp costs two grand. That's expensive. Well, yeah, but it's so worth it. Hey, do you have any money I can borrow? How is it that we dance on a television show every week but still have no money? You know, I ask myself that same exact question every time I'm online shopping. Wait a minute. What if we put on a dance camp? Really? Put on a dance camp to raise money to go to a dance camp? We dance on TV, kids would love to learn from us. Oh! And we can do it right here while my mom is at work. Okay, now you can shoot me down. CeCe, I hate to say this, but that was a great idea! Yay, us! Your plan has one fatal flaw. Me. Now, we all know the drill so let's cut to the chase. I want fifty bucks. Hush money. I'll give you sixty because we're going to need a little help with the camp. But you gotta be a counselor. Or I'm telling mom that you broke her ceramic penguin. Blackmailing a blackmailer! Well played, sister, well played. Yo, Gunther. Hmm? What was all that yelling in the game room? The hubbabaloo was in response to the new ping-pong table. Ping-pong! Man, that's my game. Oh, really? According to all the girls in school, you have no game. Okay, then prepare to be embarrassed. Oh, don't worry. I am always prepared for that. All right, so, if we're actually gonna do this dance camp, I have a few ideas. Ooh! Me too. One, we put up a banner. And, two, we open up the door. CeCe, it's not that simple. Welcome to dance camp! I guess it is that simple. Okay, the bathroom is in the hallway, stay out of my room, and if you need anything else, don't ask me. I'm not getting paid enough. CeCe, we can't do this dance camp now. We, we have nothing planned, we don't have a schedule... Oh, would you relax? We'll just wing it. Just wing it? CeCe, this isn't school. Listen to me. We don't have... They paid 200 bucks a pop. Any reason not to get started. Welcome to dance camp, kids! All right! Now, we have lots of work to do if we're going to be ready for our performance at Crusty's tonight. Our what? Read the flyer. I mean, come on, Rocky, it's like you don't even work at this camp. Hi, sorry I'm late. I'm Suzy Richman. Hi, my name is Flynn and you smell like rainbows. Excuse me? I mean, sorry. I meant my name is Flynn and... You smell like rainbows. Okay, I get it. You think I'm pretty. But I'm here to further my dance career, and no man is going to derail that. She's totally into me. Ha! Match point! Wait, why not make it more interesting and play zing-pong? Zing-pong? You mean, like zingers? No, the loser of the game turns around, while the winner takes a shot at him with the ping-pong ball. Won't that hurt? Just your pride. I'm in. Okay, you win. Take your shot. Ooh! Zingy! You wanna play another? Maybe later. Right now I have to go take the nap of shame. I'll play you. Really? Have you played before? Oh, I'm sure I can figure it out. Okay. Are you taking it easy on me because I'm a girl? Bring your A-game or don't bother showing up. All right. But I don't want any tears. Whoa! Now, now. I don't want any tears. Four, five, six, seven, eight. All right, good job, campers. You guys can go ahead and take a five. Did I tell you this is going to be the easiest cash we've ever made? I hate to say this, but, you were ri... You were ri... You were not wrong. Hello, I am Larry Diller. And I'm looking for the dance camp. Oh! Are you here to pick up your daughter? Actually, I'm here to pick it up and put it down, if you know what I'm saying. No, I don't know what you're saying. I'm here to take your dance camp! Oh! But our camp is for kids. I'm a kid at heart. Does that count? Guess it doesn't. Look, I hate to tell you this, but in order to be in our camp, you have to be this tall. And I hate to tell you, but I went to lawyer camp, also known as Harvard Law School, and you and I entered into a binding agreement when you responded to my email, not only confirming my attendance in this camp but my preference for baloney sandwich over cheese. So, unless you start teaching me to dance my butt off, I'll sue your butt off. "I'm gonna sue your butt off?" I recognize you now! You're our friend Rachel's father, Larry Diller. The lawyer from the commercials. CeCe, this guy is great. I mean, he never loses a case. Uh-oh. CeCe, he's threatening to sue us. He's not bluffing! Relax, Rocky. Per Illinois state law, statute 9275-B, a child under the age of 15 is conclusively presumed to be incapable of negligence. How do you know that? I don't. I made it up. You can't bluff a bluffer. Mr. Diller, I'm sorry but we just can't let you join our camp. It's awkward. All right, look. My son is having his bar mitzvah next week, and he thinks his daddy is an old fuddy-duddy. Your flyer said you could teach anyone. So, I'm begging you, just teach me to dance like the young kids. Please, take the fuddy-duddy out of this daddy. Rocky, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah, CeCe. Welcome to dance camp! What? No! I was going to tell him to grab his baloney sandwich and hit the road! Well, it's too late now. All right, everyone, back to work. Fine. Uh, form two lines, please. Suzy. Suzy. Suzy. Suzy. Suzy. Suzy. Suzy. Hi. Yeah, hi, Flynn. She knows my name. Excuse me, pardon me. Excuse me! Uh, Larr? Taller campers in the back. Seems unfair to those of us who are near-sighted, but okay. Okay, kids! We're gonna do a move called, "The Good Foot." All right, so take it slow and follow us. Five, six, seven, eight. One and two. Three. Four, five, six, seven, eigh... The old guy crushed my toe. It was her fault. Was not. Was too! Was not! Was too. Was not! Larry? Does someone have something to say to Suzy? No. All right, fine. Sorry, Suzy. Yay! Twenty-one to eight. Zing-pong! Time to turn around... Loser! Oh! My pride. I demand a rematch. So basically, you can't handle losing to a girl, so you'll play me game after game until you win and then your male ego can pat you on your back and all will be right in your little man-world again. Am I correct? Yeah, pretty much. Works for me. If he's not willing to cut a deal, you tell him we'll go to trial, and I will own him in front of a jury. I am an animal and I will eat him alive! I am a pit bull, and he does not want to see my teeth. Larry! How many times do we have to tell you, how can you learn if you don't pay attention? I am taking your phone away! Give it to me. No, no, no. But, but, but... Give this here. Ah! I am keeping this and you will get it back at the end of the day! Fine. But if my client gets life without parole, it's on you. Okay! Anyone else a little hungry? Let's go take a lunch break. Hey, CeCe? Can I give you, like a little, teeny-tiny note about your teaching style? Sure. You're mean. I mean, if you want Larry to learn, you have to encourage him. Excuse me. He's unfocused, he doesn't seem to care, and he's distracting the other students. Oh, my gosh, he's me with less hair and bad loafers. I took the liberty of cutting the crusts off your sandwich. And you cut it into the shape of a heart. Oh... Did I? Must have gotten carried away. I guess the butter knife cuts what the butter knife wants. Look, you're sweet, but between dancing, school, and my oboe lessons, I don't have time for a relationship. So, what I'm hearing is, uh, you think I'm sweet? Sorry, but you're not my type. Dude, you got it bad. And that ain't good. I mean, how am I not her type? I'm the cutest kid in the room. Cute? Look at me. I used to be cute. Really? Just like you. You know how far cute gets you in life? This far. You know how far smart and successful gets you? The rest of the way. You think I became a lawyer just because I care about justice? I did it because court stenographers are traditionally very attractive. I don't understand your point. If she's important to you, don't give up. Never give up. Of course, there's a fine line between never giving up and a restraining order. If you find yourself on the other side of that line, my card. Welcome to the stage a man who has set the world of dance on fire. M.C.

Larry! Larry! Larry! Larry! Larry! Aah! I was just resting my eyes. For 20 minutes? Well, Suzy was supposed to wake me up in ten, but apparently someone is being a child and can't get past a little toe stomping. Ahh! Oh! Ooh! Okay, come on! And it's a right, right, and a left. And, right, right, and a left. No, Larry. Your left. Oh! Right. No! Not right! Left! Left, left, left, left, left, left, left! Larry... Forget this. I can't do it. Hey, Flynn, where's Larry? Oh! He left, left, left, left, left. CeCe, what did you do? Oh, I yelled at him for a while and then he finally quit. Well, I think it's time for a little juice break, kids! All right. CeCe, we made a commitment to him. Does that mean anything to you? Come on, Rocky! I'm just trying to get enough money to go to the Big Apple Dance Camp. So, that's it? We're just going to give up on Larry. Great, we're finally agreeing on something. You know what, CeCe, this reminds me of a little girl who went to dance school, and she was so uncoordinated that everybody laughed at her. She wanted to leave, she wanted to quit, but the teacher wouldn't let her. She stood by her and she taught her how to dance. And you turned into a wonderful dancer, Rocky. CeCe, the little girl was you. That's not the way I remember it. Well, that's the way it happened! I get it, Rocky. We have to go after him. When you make a commitment to someone, you always have to stick by them. No matter how annoying and irritating and exasperating they can be. Yes, I am very familiar with this concept. Okay, campers. Looks like we're going after Larry. So, we're gonna have to buddy up. Uh, Suzy? You're with me. Everyone else, figure it out. Whoo-hoo! No! Yes! Good game, Ty. You win. Now, I will turn my back and you may zing away. Yeah. Well, go on, take your shot, little boy. Oh, yeah! No, no, I can't do it. You're a girl. It's not right. Oh, I'll tell you what's not right. You not treating me like the equal I am. I lose fair and square and you can't be gracious enough to zing me? Ha! You call yourself a man? You don't even deserve the pants you wear! You play like a child and win like a girl. Ooh! I demand equality! Yeah! And I demand respect! Yeah! I can't believe you hit me! I'm a girl! Wha... What do you mean? You told me to... Ah! Just kidding. Best two out of three? Oh, good. 'Cause I thought you were serious about... Ha! Point, Tinka! You can't quit now, Larry! Okay, look, you do have some moves. I'm not sure what they are... But, maybe if you come back, we can figure them out. Or, I could keep eating my pizza, and you two could scoot on out of here. You can't eat through your problems, Larry. Although, you are doing a heck of a job trying. Come on! I want you to picture yourself at your son's bar mitzvah. There you are strutting your stuff and then someone from the crowd yells, "Who is that dancing machine? Is that Justin Timberlake?" And your proud little bar mitzvah boy says, "No, that's my poppa." Are you plotzing? No. I'm eating. And it's pointless anyway. You can't take the fuddy-duddy out of this daddy. You're not getting your cell phone back anytime soon with that attitude, mister. Okay, listen. You are not a fuddy-duddy, and I'll tell you why. A fuddy-duddy is stuck in his ways. A fuddy-duddy would never have the guts to show up at a dance camp meant for seven year olds and try to learn something new. You, sir, are no fuddy-duddy! Although, frankly, the pleated khakis aren't really helping your case. Mr. Diller? Remember what you told me in the kitchen? That if you care about something, never give up, no matter what. Thank you for reminding me of that, Flynn. I've got to get back to camp. I promised myself I was going to go to that bar mitzvah and dance my tuchus off, and I'm gonna do it! Yes! Actually, I was talking about when you said you were cute. I'm sorry, but I just don't buy it. ♪ I twist my hips, watch me ♪ I pump my fists, watch me I move like this. ♪ I move like this, watch me ♪ Whirl, watch me Whirl, watch me You can do it, Larry! Go, Larry! ♪ I swerve and dip, watch me ♪ I slide and switch, watch me ♪ Whirl, watch me Whirl, watch me ♪ Hey, Suzy? I know I'm not your type, but I just wanna say you were really good. Thanks. Call me sometime. You did a great job, Larry! Well, I owe it all to you two! You're wonderful teachers. And, please, send me a postcard from the Big Apple Dance Camp. I always knew you had it in you. You know, there were moments just give up on you. We should. But I said, "No. We must stand by him, "we must encourage him and teach him how to dance." Uh, CeCe... I said, "We made to Larry Diller, "and we will not stop untill that commitment is fulfilled." Uh, yeah, well that's the way I remember it. Well, that's the way it happened! Thought it was gonna be a good day [ Man chuckles ] [ Indistinct talking ] Mr. Gregory had this way of making everyone feel good, even when we were painting over graffiti. Should be good to go. Give it a good stir first, okay? - Okay. Dante. Closest thing I ever had to a father. Bring that ladder over here. Okay, Mr. Gregory. Want me to set it up? - Yeah. But Little T... He didn't like what Mr. Gregory stood for. Just like that... No! Mr. Gregory was gone. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Is Terrance Jones, the man you know as Little T, who you saw shoot Elmore Gregory? Yeah, that's him. Can you describe the gun used in the shooting? It was a Mac-10, all black-like, with a big barrel. Bad-ass gun. Isn't it true that you were focused on the weapon, focused on saving yourself? Yeah, but -- so focused, you couldn't possibly see the shooter because you were only looking at the gun. Isn't that true, Mr. Moore? Trust me. The defense attorney will be worse. Answer the question, Dante, just like we practiced. I saw Terrance Jones kill Elmore Gregory. It was Little T. Good job. That's all you have to do tomorrow. I think we're ready for trial. Good, 'cause I'm starving. Meet you outside. Come on. Let's get you to the hotel and get you fed. Just be yourself on the stand tomorrow, okay, Dante? That's all you got to do. You'll be there with me? The whole time. Come on. Rizzoli and Isles - S02E11 Can I Get Witness? Original air date November 28, 2011 I want to thank you for being the only guy with the guts to stand up to Little T. I'm standing up for Mr. Gregory. It will be very intimidating when you see Terrance Jones in the courtroom. I'm buggin' a little. Little T's homies are looking for me. Oh, don't worry about it, all right? They're not gonna find you. Um, this is officer Jermaine Walker, and he will be outside your hotel room all night. How you doing? I'll make sure nothing happens. You have my word. All right. See you tomorrow. Order a steak. No, no, no, no. Don't. I'm concerned about promise, reward, and inducement. The defense attorney could come after us if we give him anything -- you know that. [ Chuckling ] You can't lock him in a room and not give him food. Just keep it modest. Order a steak, all right, but a cheap one. And watch a movie. For real? Yeah. Keep it clean, right? See you in the morning. Yeah. Okay. [ Scoffs ] "Reward and inducement"? Like Dante's gonna risk his life to testify for a free steak? Valerie Delgado is a great prosecutor. I know, I know. The best there is. She's never lost a murder trial. But? - Just wish she'd lighten up a little bit. Valerie Delgado says your witness is prepped. Yeah, I think he's good to go, sir. Keep up the good work. We all want this guy. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Little T is responsible for at least 15 murders. Remember when we almost got him with the drive-by of the grandmother and the 8-year-old kid? That witness "disappeared" when Terrance Jones was charged. Since then, no one has come forward until Dante stepped up. So, how does a white female cop get the confidence of a black kid from the hood? I have mad skills. [ Chuckles softly ] No. Korsak's the one that got us his fingerprints on the weapon. - No big deal. - Yes, it is! You're the one who found the C.I. Who told us that the gun was still in Little T's car. Yeah, we caught a few breaks on this one. I want to look professional on the stand. Which one? Hmm. What's that music I'm hearing? What music? Oh, it's your ties, singing disco songs. All right, Armani. What would you wear? [ Chuckles ] Let's see. [ Clears throat ] - Uh, where's the other one? - The other one? This is two-for-one from the gentleman's warehouse, right? Jane: God, you know what? Go away, please. He's right. I got no sense of style. Oh, come on. He's just messing with you. Here. Wear this one. Goes nice with your eyes. Thank you. [ Sighs ] You are taking forever. Come on. You haven't touched your mulberry leaves or the wheatgrass. Bass, you love your Opuntia Cactus pads! [ Clears throat ] Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh, my God. [ Exhales sharply ] You scared me. I'm so sorry. I just wanted to watch something on your plasma. Oh. You're a Bill O'Reilly fan? [ Chuckles ] He has the most beautiful Irish blue eyes. I-I hope you don't mind, but the TV in the guest house just doesn't do them justice. Well, they look like contacts. No! Yeah, Paris Hilton wears them, too. I didn't think you read tabloids. Oh, no. I read that in Ophthalmological Month journal. Yeah. Of course. So, why is the sound off? Oh. Mr. O'Reilly's very bright but a little opinionated. And he gets on my nerves when I listen to him. Well, neurological studies show that listening to someone you disagree with helps stimulate the brain. Oh, I'm stimulated watching him. [ Both chuckle ] Oh, turn it up! This is why I'm watching. Elmore Gregory was one of the good guys -- a young father of two who stood up to drug dealers and paid with his life. Here he is on "The Factor" two years ago. I say put your Xbox down, get your paint rollers and your courage, and stand up to these drug dealers... - That's Jane's case. - I know. Bill O'Reilly's in town to cover it. - Isn't it exciting? - Elmore Gregory's alleged murderer, this man, Terrance "Little T" Jones, goes on trial tomorrow. Boston homicide detectives apparently have an eyewitness who is prepared to identify Jones as the killer of a good man, a patriot... [ Door opens ] Why is your door unlocked? Hey, ma -- okay, I couldn't find any sour patch, so you got to settle with gummi bears. It's good. No. No, no, no, no, no. Turn that crap off, ma. Uh, Jane, O'Reilly is doing -- Off, all right? We all know you're in love with B.O. Don't call him that. Off! Too bad, since he's doing the whole show on your case. What? But since you're not interested -- wait. No. Turn it back on. Ma, turn it back on! - Look, it's you! - O'Reilly: Now tomorrow, the trial of Terrance Jones begins, and we will be there. Shh! Boston police say he's a suspect in at least 15 other murders. Now homicide detectives finally have Jones right where they want him -- facing a jury for killing a man who stood up to him. Let's hope there will finally be justice for this father of two who wasn't afraid to speak up for what's right. Wow. Wouldn't that be something? Yes, it would. Hey, ma, can you make me some eggs? - Sure! - Thank you. I can't believe she has the hots for Bill O'Reilly. [ Chuckles ] "His Irish blue eyes"? [ Scoffs ] Vomit. Well, studies show that men with great earning potential are still the most desirable mate. She's too old to mate. Rizzoli! At least that stops her from falling for Stanley. How many times I got to tell you? The jelly doughnuts don't go here. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Stanley. Look at this mess. You got strawberry jelly on the sprinkles. Oh, that's a problem. Stanley has obsessive-compulsive disorder. The two doughnuts making contact is very upsetting for him. [ Cellphone rings ] Good. [ Beep ] Rizzoli. All right, we'll be right there. [ Beep ] Gang-related shooting. Let's go. [ Siren walls ] [ Car doors open, close ] Jane: What do we got? Victim's male, African-American, early 20s. Gang affiliation? No one's talking. Some things never change. Oh, God. No. Jane, who is it? Oh, God. [ Sighs ] It's Dante, my witness. [ Sighs ] There was a guard right outside his hotel door. Frost is checking it out. Little T ordered this hit from jail. How'd they find him? I talked him into this, Korsak. - You're not responsible for this. - Yeah, I am. Rigor indicates he's been dead about eight hours. So he was killed last night. One gunshot wound to the back of the head. [ Sighs ] It's a close contact, execution style. Hey. I'm glad you're here. You believe this? What I can't believe is how you let this happen. Oh! Nobody let this happen. Lividity suggests he's been lying here six to eight hours. Yeah, and yet nobody thought to call it in. I don't see any blood or brain matter. He wasn't killed here. I want an internal affairs investigation into that officer you put on the hotel room. Really? You think that's the most important thing right now? - Dante's dead, Valerie. - You vouched for that officer, Jane. [ Cellphone rings ] If we're getting technical, his safety wher responsibility. Let's not play the blame game. I just want to find out who did this. His wallet's still here. Did you see his phone? - No. I'll get a subpoena going for his phone records. Right. I want to take a look at that hotel room myself and talk to Walker. - Go. I'll handle this. - Can you handher? The guy with three ex-wives? Psh! That's what I thought. Okay. I looked at the surveillance tape. - He's telling the truth. - How is that possible? Walker never left his post. Dante never left the room. Front desk says no calls on the room phone, no card-key activity on the door, just room service. - Did we check the room-service guy? - Clean. What time was it when you last saw Dante? Look, he was fine. I saw him when they brought his dinner. What time was it? It was 8:53 P.M. Look, I come from the same project. I know what it took for him to stand up to someone like Little T. Jermaine, it's okay. Nobody's blaming you for this. He barely touched his burger. He was starving. He hadn't eaten all day. Something big must have interrupted him. Or someone called him on his cellphone. He was a foster kid. He bounced from home to home. No family. So who? Maybe a friend he trusted. Who lured him to his death. No signs of a struggle. Jermaine, did you open the window? It was hot when we came into the room. Dante opened it. Excuse me. Can you dust the sill for me? Look at the way the prints are facing. Looks like the prints are facing outward, like he was hanging from the window. Hmm. You think he climbed out? I don't know, Jane. It's two stories. It's a long drop. Do you see any other way for him to get out of here? What the hell made him bolt? What does the loss of your witness do to your case? It's not good, but we've still got the gun with Terrance Jones' prints, and I've never lost a murder trial. Wow, that's impressive. Oh, crap. I've got a flat. Wouldn't be surprised if a gangbanger slashed my tire. Damn. Oh, no. It wasn't slashed. Looks like you ran over a roofing nail. The last time I called peppy road service, it took them like four peppy hours. I'll be here all day. I'll change it for you. No. What? You don't have to do that. It's fine. No, no. It's okay. Just need to get the right footwear for the job. You sure you don't want my help? No, thank you, sergeant. I like to keep my skill set fresh. I feel bad, watching you do it all by yourself. Don't. She's faster than peppy. It's a dicey neighborhood. You want me to wait around with you? She can take care of herself. No, it's fine. I'll see you back at headquarters. He really thinks we're incompetent. No, he doesn't. He's just, uh, protective. Why is it men always think that women, we don't know what the hell we're doing? Actually, there are exciting advances in brain mapping and genetic research that prove some stereotypes are true. Really? What, like men are better drivers? Yes. Actually, probably due to testosterone. Seems they have an advantage in spatial ability. Okay, don't tell my colleagues that, please. [ Chuckles ] All right. There you go. You can drive on the spare, but you should get a new tire. Let me ask you -- what's science have to say about the chances of a woman who can't change her own tire becoming the next D.A.? Excellent. [ Chuckles ] Hi. The prints from the window sill belong to Dante. You started the autopsy? Just about to. [ Cellphone buzzes ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Oh, yuck. It's Delgado, asking me again, for the 400th time, if I've filed a 1920. I thought I'd memorized all your cop talk. You know, "code 10." That's lunch. And "I'm off for a personal." That's when you have to do number two. Stop. 1920 is the internal-affairs complaint form... [ Cellphone buzzes ]... Which I'm not filing, because Walker had nothing to a young fellow like you... would want to tie himself down to the job of a caretaker. You see, there is a difference in our philosophies. Here I continue close to the one I admired and loved in life. Have it your own way. I'm not complaining. You understand what you have to do here. Yes, I understand thoroughly. All right. I'll be getting along. Good-bye. Bye, effendi. Three tana leaves to keep him alive, nine to give him movement. Kharis. Kharis. Kharis. The moon rides high in the sky again, Kharis. There is death in the night air. Your work begins. What was that? I don't know. Let's go home. I'm scared. Vic. Vic. What's the matter? There's something outside. I seen it go by the window. Seen what? I don't know, but its shadow crossed my face. Ain't nothin' out there. I seen it, I tell ya. I'm gonna phone the Sheriff right now. Hello. Sheriff speaking. What do you want? A shadow? You wake me up for that? Go on back to bed. You must be crazy. Whoa! Whoa! What's the matter with you? Quiet down! You're kind of cramped for space, aren't you, son? Yeah. well... here goes. You know, that's just perfect. Even if you didn't ask me, as a checker player, I'd say you're a darn good doctor. Three games in a row ought to prove something. Yeah. Yeah, it proves it's 11:00. I'd better be getting on home. I'd better be getting to bed. You should've been there an hour ago. That's what you get for having an older sister. Now, Stephen, don't you start talking about ages. What's the matter with them? I'll run out and see. You go to bed, Dad. All right, son. I'll be back soon, Isobel, to take you home. Good night, Jane. Good night, dear. Good night, Isobel. Good night. King! Silver! Quiet, boys! What's the trouble with the dogs, Jim? They don't bark like that for nothing. Something must have frightened them mighty bad. Kharis! Why, that... that sounds like Stephen. Oh! Wait here. He... He's dead. One is gone, Kharis, one who dared dery our ancient gods. Three remain... only three... And then we can return to the land that gave us birth. This is just a waste of time. Those marks left on his throat were nothing but dust. You're the coroner and you should know. Still, it might lead to some clue. It's worth checking on. I've compared this with specimens of clay and dirt from all over this territory. There's nothing like it around here. It's just another Why would anyone do such a thing? You can't call it a fiend murder and let it go at that. I don't intend to. We'll do everything we can. Just let us handle it. All right, Sheriff. Go on. Well, you see, we were... We were parked along the west county pike and... What time was that? It must've been before 11:00. We were listening to Jan Garber on the radio. Then suddenly a shadow passed over us. What sort of shadow? I don't know. Just a shadow. Didn't you see what made it? No. We didn't look up right away. When we did, it was gone. All right, you can go. Yes, sir. I'll send for you if I need you. Vic, you called me about seeing the same shadow. I seen it. It passed right over my bed. I seen somebody pass by the window too. What did he look like? I don't know. The moon was behind him. He just kinda looked... all black. Anything else? When we looked out, whoever it was was gone. Okay, Vic, I'll see you later. I've covered a lot of murders, but this is the first time I ever had a shadow for a suspect. Might as well let the reporters in. Yeah? What are you gonna tell them? I don't know. Maybe they can give me a lead. Oh, John, are you still at this desk? I've checked through every person that ever contacted him. I still can't find anyone who would have reason to... Look, John, you can't spend the rest of your life... doing detective work. All right, Auntie. You're the boss around here. What would you have me do? Stop neglecting your practice. Go down to your office and... My dear, since this thing's happened, you've forgotten her completely. I guess you're right, Auntie. Of course I'm right. You go on out there. Spend the day with her. It'll do you both some good. All right. It's wonderful being with you again, darling. Auntjane told me you'd called, but since that night I've had so much on my mind. Oh, I understand, John. O mighty gods of Egypt, may you keep up my strength... to carry out the mission entrusted to me. Strength to resist any temptation... which may be thrown across my path. Strength to fulfill the destiny of Kharis. I was wondering when he'd get here. When does the train arrive? Around 11:00, I think. I'll run down and meet him. You needn't wait up. I certainly shall wait up. Babe was always one of my favorites. Suit yourself, Auntie. Good night. Good night, dear. Now go, while the moon is still high in the sky. Death goes with you. Am I glad to see you, Babe. I came as fast as I could, John. How's Jane? Oh, fine, considering. Come on, get in. We can talk on the way home. Very well. That's everything we know. We haven't found a motive or reason or anything. Not a clue nor nothing? No. Oh, yes, there was something, but nothing came of it. What was that? A kind of grayish mark on Dad's throat. Must've been a powerful hand that strangled him. What did you say? Kind of grayish mark on dad's throat. Clay or dust or something. Grayish mark. A grayish mark. Quiet, King. Quiet, Silver. Jim! Jim! You are back, Kharis. Now you can rest. Rest until the moon is high again in the sky. Two are dead and two remain. It's no use. Hemelpaegia. Take a look. It's a form of paralysis caused by severe shock. Jim. Jim. Don't you know me? Can't you remember anything? If there's any change, will you please call me? I will, John. All right, Babe. Hey, look who's here! Hi, boys, how are you? Hi, Lefty, Joe. Hi, Peoples. Well, Frank, don't tell me they sent you out on this assignment. Had my choice of covering the Russian front or this. I picked this. Look, John, your father's told this story over and over. Sure. When I was a kid. He used to tell me fairy tales too. Yes, but this is different, and you know it. Thirty years ago, your father and I met up with this curse in Ananka's tomb. It wasn't imagination either. We saw that curse bring on death. We thought we'd destroyed the mummy in the fire. Maybe it escaped, or maybe there was another one. Oh, Babe, it's ridiculous. Even supposing you were right, what would it be doing around here? Where would it hide? If those high priests could keep a man alive for 3,000 years, they certainly could figure out the rest too. Oh, Babe, listen... the only clue we have are the dust marks on dad's throat, and now on the throats of Auntjane and Jim. It's not dust. It was mold that came from a mummy. Have it your way. We can't go on arguing all night. John, will you do me a favor? Certainly. Leave Mapleton. Go far away, quickly. Why would I do that? Because you're next in line. The curse on that tomb extends to the blood relations of all who entered it. Then you're included. Suppose I am. I'm an old man. You're... Now, Babe, I've known you ever since I could walk. I'd do anything for you. But I'm a doctor. I can't believe in a live mummy. Where are you going? I'm going to find someone that will listen to me... before it's too late for all of us. There was a gray mark on the throats... of every person killed in this town. I know that. That mark wasn't mud or clay. It was mold. We'll look into it. We appreciate your coming in... to tell us about it. Don't you believe me? Well, now, you see... yes, I know. You're a doctor too, likeJohn Banning. A heart and lungs couldn't last 3,000 years. Go on, tell me. I was about to say those very words. All right, don't believe me. And don't do anything. Wait 'til more murders are committed. Look, there are dozens of reporters here... from all the metropolitan papers. A number of them are razzing Mapleton about the revival of witchcraft. I know that. What would they say if I told them... a mummy, 3,000 years old, was doing the killing? They'd laugh us out of office. What will they say when they find out I was right... and that I tried to tip you off? Give me a beer, will you? Yes, sir. Coming right up. Excuse me. Aren't you Babe Hanson? That's right. I'm Jake Lovell, "New York Record." How are you? Suppose you're down here because of all the trouble. Maybe. Too bad about Mr. Banning and his sister, wasn't it? Yeah. Any idea what's behind everything? I know what's behind it. You know what? Know all about it... and nobody will listen to me. Look, friend. If you're after a listener, you don't need to look further. What's this all about? Well, it started thirty years ago... when Steve Banning and I discovered Ananka's tomb. What's that got to do with it? Everything to do with it. That tomb was guarded by a live mummy. We saw it. We fought it. You think a mummy's been doing all these murders around here? I know it was a mummy. What a yarn. It's gonna be a tough baby to sell my editor. Give me all the details. Well, at that time Steve and I were young men. Steve was interested in archaeology. I know. I've heard that laughingstock routine before. What do you want me to do? The whole town's afraid of their own shadows. I'm following up on it. Good-bye. Sheriff! It's out again. I just saw that shadow. A shadow. What else did you see? I didn't wait for anything more. That's a great help. You don't think I was taking any chances? Where did you see it? Along High Street. We're going back to High Street. I've written hundreds of stories, but never... The killer! He's out again! He just frightened Nick Landsford down on High Street. The Sheriff s down there now! Thanks, Babe. See you later. Kharis! He's dead. Look. What is it? I'm not sure, but I think I know someone who can tell me. Will you drive me to the university? I want to see Professor Norman. Of course. I'll call and tell him we're coming. All right. This powder, which you say was scraped... from the gray marks on the victims' throats, is mold. Mold? Yes, mold. Developed through so many centuries... that it's almost impossible to calculate. It's the same we find in this strip of linen. What makes you so sure? There's a distinct scent common to both of them. Smell it. It's undoubtedly the odor of myrrh. Comes from a tree known as the Commiphora abyssinica, which grows only in parts of Africa. So? This reddish brown resin is myrrh. The other test tubes contain cedar oil and sodium carbonate. All those substances come from this strip of linen. Look. You can see that mark... where the linen has been partially eaten away? Yes, but what's it about? Where does it come from? That mold and this strip of linen... both came from the body of a mummy. The chemicals were used for embalming. There's no doubt about it. That inky hieroglyphic there... is the same that's found on the body of the Princess Ananka. It dates back almost, oh, 3,000 years, to the reign of King Amenophis, her father. Whether you are ready to accept it or not, we're dealing with the presence of the Living Dead. Then Babe was right, and we wouldn't listen. You've seen the evidence. We've got to accept it. Living or dead, I'm going after it, now that I know what to look for. Come on. Telegram for Mr. Banning. Oh, yes. Thank you. The commission's just what I wanted. But coming at a time like this... I think it's wonderful. Just what you've needed, something to get you away from here. Nobody else could reason with you. But there's one thing certain. You know the army won't wait. Three days. Hardly time to get my affairs settled. Any things that need attending to... I can take care of. You? Sure. You didn't think I'd leave without taking you with me. You've just proposed and answered yes... all in one breath. Isobel, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be so abrupt. I... Shh! Don't go spoiling it by saying any more. We'd better get started. I have a million things to do... wedding preparations and all that. Maybe we'd just better go to the judge's office. No, we'll have it at home, in memory of Dad. He'd have wanted it that way. All right, John. Kharis. Kharis, come here. They think there will be a marriage... and a heir to carry on the blood of the Bannings. They think that, Kharis. This time, Kharis, I'm sending you upon a different mission. One of life rather than of death. You are eternal, Kharis. Earthly pains and sickness cannot touch you. Like the age-old hills of Egypt, you exist, you are. The ancient line of the high priests of Karnak... must minister unto you until the end of time, Kharis. I shall do that for you, Kharis, I. I am going to take on to myself... a wife, Kharis. A wife. Do you understand that? The one... the one who is supposed to be the bride... of the last of the Bannings. The one whom it was ordained I should find. Turn around, dear. There, I think that's it. What do you think, Ella? Oh, she looks beautiful. How fast they grow up, though. You're sure you can have it ready for tomorrow? Oh, heavens, yes. There isn't much to do. A dart here and there, shorten the sleeves. You're about the size your mother was... when she was married in this dress. Am I, Mother? Someday I may be making this dress over for another young bride. You never can tell. Well, good night. Good night, Laura. Good night, Laura. Together we three, until the world crumbles... and there is no longer a stone or a rock... or a tree or a blade of grass. That is my will, Kharis, and you shall obey it. Bring her here. Go! Go. You've been happy, haven't you, Mother? We'll talk about that later. It's time you were in bed. Vic. Vic! Hmm? There's that sound again. I'm scared. Good night, darling. Good night, Mother. Sleep well. I've asked you to meet me at the Banning home... because we've got a terrible job on our hands... and it's gonna require all our courage to see it through. Believe it or not, the facts are here, and we've got to face them. A creature that's been alive for 3,000 years is in this town... and it's brought death with it. We've got to run it down. Thirty years ago, my father discovered... and violated a sacred tomb in Egypt. Did I hear you say something about Egypt? That's right. I've been out to the graveyard, sheriff... and I was talking to the caretaker... about a final resting place for myself. Yes? And the caretaker spoke all about Egypt... and Quoted a lot of passages from his Egyptian Bible. Then when I heard you talk here tonight, I thought maybe he knows something about it. John! John! Oh, John! John! Isobel! The monster took her away! Isobel? Yes. John, give out those clubs. Give out the torches. Come on, men, get your torches. Where am I? What are you doing? There is nothing to be afraid of. Nothing will hurt you ever again. That... that creature. Kharis? You have nothing to fear from him. He has brought you here to me... because it is your destiny to achieve the greatest honor that can come to a woman. You will become the bride of a high priest of Karnak. No. No! For you, I'm going to forsake the teachings... that have been handed down to us for generations upon end. The secret that has kept Kharis alive all these years... can be ours as well. You're mad. After I have given you the tana fluid... you will be immortal, even as Kharis is immortal. What I can do for you, I can do for myself. You will bear me a son, and he will be brought up... in the confines of the tombs of Egypt, even as I was brought up. A new priest of Karnak... who will carry on the ancient and honorable line. No. John and I, tomorrow, we're going to be married. There will be no marriage between you and John Banning. The sins of his father are upon his head, and only death waits for him, as it has for the rest of his family. For he who despoils the ancient tombs of Egypt... must die. Oh. One day you will thank me for this. Over here. Kharis. Take her out and hide her... until I get rid of these fools. Let's go in! Open that door! Come on! Open up! Open up in there! Get something to break this door down! Quiet! Quiet, men! There's the man we're after. You gentlemen wish to see me? Yes. You've some explaining to do. What have you done with Isobel? With whom? Up to now, I've only asked questions. Do I have to use another method to make you speak up? Well? I know nothing of any such person, effendi. The mummy. Isobel. Through the woods. Banning! Well? For those who defile the temples of ancient Egypt, a violent death shall be their fate. Come on, men, let's go. Over here! There he goes! Get him! Come on! If the mummy tries to get away, stop him with fire. Watch the back stairs. Don't let him get away. Isobel. Isobel! Oh, John. I'm so glad we snuck out... while the folks are celebrating. Hey! Morning, Johan. - Morning. - Good morning, Erik. - Morning, Gunnar. - Morning, Erik. How was your catch last night? - Found the school where you said. - Above the point. You'll have better luck tomorrow. The water temperature is up two degrees. - How's your luck, Erik? - My luck? I don't need any luck in my business. I wasn't talking about business. Nor is your business my business nor am I a man to talk, but there is talk in the village. The hermit is no longer a hermit. Go on and dry your nets. Erik, there was some tagged salmon in the catch, three of them. Well, that's right, my tags. They're the first to show up. I marked them in June, 1935. Home again. Four years later, on time. Thanks for bringing them. I've got to note this down. You're not too busy to come to my wedding tonight? - I'll be there. - Anna told me to remind you she's invited the English admiral. - And his daughter too? Yes, his daughter too. Go on and dry your nets. Don't look yet. - Now you can turn around. - Your wedding cake. How beautiful! Thank you. - Make a wish. - I will. Did you make the wish? I did. - This is wonderful cake. - All wedding cakes are lovely. This is the nicest one of all, I know. Save a nice piece for your father. - I will. This is for you, Alfred. - Thank you, Anna. - But you must remember our guests. - Yes, the English admiral. I'll serve them right away. Thank you. - To our English friends. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Good luck to you always. Thank you. The first dance with your husband. Excuse us. This is very good cake indeed. We seem to be celebrating every event in Norway with a feast. A pleasant custom, in my opinion. Judith's fond of her food. The poets say women are wrapped up in love and dreams of melancholy princes but my sister prefers roast beef any day. - Brother has no illusions about me. - All brothers are the same. - Would you care to dance? - I'll do my best. I like weddings. In fact, I like everything I've discovered in Norway. Norway returns the compliment, Miss Bowen. Happy? Yes, but I'd better go back and finish cutting the cake. All right. I'll tell you the truth, Anna. I'm delighted you married my son. I couldn't have picked a better girl. Two or three little points of instruction: In the morning, don't talk to him until he talks to you. A man in the morning is really an animal that belongs in the zoo. - Not Gunnar? - Gunnar! Instruction the second: do not permit yourself to get fat. Fat has ruined more marriages than actresses and pretty widows. Has Mother taught you not to talk to me until I talk to you in the morning? - Gunnar! - How did you know? Mother's married off five of my brothers already. When Alfred finds a wife, she'll hear the same. Dance. Your instructions will come later and not from me. Go, dance. I've never seen so many beautiful girls in my life. I'm seriously thinking of living in Norway for five or six years. You look so serious, as if you were trying to solve a world problem. I am serious about a problem. It isn't a world problem. If you have something on your mind, it makes it a lot easier to share it with someone. My friends tell me that I have a nice, honest face. We dance. We drink. Ridiculous. - Another drink, admiral? - I really oughtn't. - Just one. - Thank you. - To England. - To Norway. Though I reserve certain criticisms of the English government, understand. I understand. I imagine you are not alone in that. We dance. We drink. We pray. It's ridiculous. Evening, admiral. I hope my husband isn't boring you with politics. - Yes, Mrs. Bergesen. - At a wedding? Yes, at a wedding, in church, at dinner, in school in factories, in bed I talk politics. Laugh now. Later I will laugh, except that I won't feel like laughing. You're a patriarch. You sailed God's oceans. You're familiar with storms. With that beard you look as wise as Moses. What do you say? The herring will run, Germans or no Germans. All the philosophy you'll get from him. He owns a fleet of boats. I must drink. I just must drink. Tell me, is England asleep like this too? - Perhaps dozing a little. - Johan, why talk? Yes, it's only bad for my stomach. And it's a wedding. - Let's dance. - Yes. Come. Forgive me. Forgive me. Mrs. Bergesen? When Bergesen was a young man, we said he'd grow out of it. We were wrong. Still, he does no harm. To my son, and may he have seven sons too. I hope so, sir. - All right, Mr. Korstad? - I regret I haven't seven more sons to marry off in your hotel, Mr. Arnesen. Thank you very much. Here, smell. A beautiful combination of summertime and alcohol. Don't stand around all night, girls. See that everybody has what he wants. When I think of weddings, I think of the smell. You look unhappy. Somebody spill something? That Bergesen! Talk, talk, talk. He should be stopped by law. You always want to stop something by law. You don't eat enough green vegetables. A woman shouldn't make fun of her husband's political convictions. Go pour this in the bowl. It wouldn't do you any harm to stick your nose in it once or twice yourself. Hilma, we must have a serious talk. Next year, Lars. Go on now. A dry punch bowl is against nature. I'll always remember this. Tall trees, deep waters, peaceful waters. Stars like ice. Those good, kind people inside. What a pleasant place to hold a wedding. Yes, pleasant. - Is that where you were married? - Yes, seven years ago. My wife died when Solveig was born. Yes, I know. Hans! No, Hans. I said, no! "No" is not so different from any other place. Spring. The snow melts on the hills. The buds come out on the trees. The salmon come home and the girls say, "I said, no." What is that? My Solveig is sleeping in there with the children of the other guests. When I was a little girl and the grownups had a party I used to stay at the head of the stairs and watch all night long. - Perhaps she's still awake. - Shall we go and see? - Father. - Did you sleep well, Solveig? All right. But I lost a button from my nightdress. That's serious. I'll fix that. - Father, was it a nice party? - Yes, very nice. - Was there dancing? - Yes. How many dances? - Six? - Six. You danced six times? - Yes. - He did. With you? All right. - Good night. - Good night. This air's good after all that punch. It's time we turned in. It's an early start tomorrow. - Judith took an hour to dress tonight. - Not long for a woman. She usually takes eight minutes. - Nice chap, that Toresen, isn't he? - Very. Do you think anything will come of it? No. You'd better go say good night to those five girls you were dancing with. Seven. I observe the wind, the weather the arrival and departure of various kinds of fish. I report every day to Oslo that there is fog here or snow that the barometer is falling. Is that all? Well, I talk to myself. That sounds like nice and expensive fun. I argue with Bergesen about the League of Nations ski in the wintertime, teach my daughter cooking and geography. She's up to Africa and scrambled eggs by now. Until you came along I thought I spent a busy and full life. Has my coming along changed anything? Everything, Judith. I mean, Miss Bowen. Which is it, Judith or Miss Bowen? I'm not one for fine words, empty words. I never feel alone with trees, mountains. They're permanent. Why did you say that? I'm sorry if I said too much. But you didn't. I wanted you to say this. But you're going away and England is across the North Sea. How far is that? Too far. - I may be back. - When? Next spring, next summer. Sometime. Sometime... I think I better be going in. It's getting late. Yes. It's getting late. - Good night. - Good night. The British ambassador in Berlin handed to the German government a final note stating that unless we heard that they were preparing at once to withdraw their troops from poland, a state of war would exist between us. People of Norway, do not be alarmed because of German troops. Negotiations are being conducted with German authorities. Resistance or disturbance will only harm the negotiations. Be assured that our neutrality will be respected and remember there must be no resistance. This is the Norwegian war office speaking for your king and government. - Good morning. - Good morning. All right, children. All right, children. There's to be no more resistance. We've been ordered not to further resist. No resistance? 1933: no resistance. 1936: no resistance. 1939: no resistance. Now, 1940, the Germans are marching through Norway and still we hear "no resistance." - Those are my orders. - We can't do this. The Germans are coming, we must do something. Erik, friend, you're a sensible man. You're an educated man. Tell him. - The captain has his orders. - They came over the radio. They came over the radio. After all, it's his business. He's an officer. He knows more about how a war is to be conducted. We civilians, it's not exactly our line. Then we civilians must make it our line. People of Norway, greetings. The people of Germany shake the hand of their Nordic brothers. We are driving the English invaders from your shores and guarantee that never again will any English foot be set upon Norwegian soil. We are making a New World Order and there is a great place in it for our friends and brothers, the Norwegians. Everything is to go on exactly as before except that no longer do you have to live in fear of the English octopus. The Führer sends his greetings to his Norwegian brothers and congratulates them on their delivery. All is to go on as before. Your industries are now in safe hands. Your culture is protected. Of course, there'll be a curfew at 6:30 every night. And any Norwegian found in the streets after that will be shot. No boats are to leave the harbour under pain of death. Any act of disobedience against the German uniform is punishable by death at my discretion. - Colonel, the concert. - Oh, yes. There will be a concert by the regimental band here at 2:30 every Sunday. That is all. It is reported that one of you gentleman holds some interesting views about our arrival. Which one of you is Bergesen? That's my name. It is considered necessary that you be held for questioning. - But why? - You will come with me now. Captain just what does "questioning" mean? And what is your name? - Toresen. - Erik, this is my affair. - Look after Hilda. - I want to be with you. Please, dear. Sir, your Norwegian brother is ready to be taken into the New World Order. I don't like them. Father, I don't like those men. I don't like them. I'm writing a novel myself. I'd be very disappointed if you gentlemen don't burn it. Radios of all descriptions will be confiscated immediately. Anyone in possession of one will be punished by death. A little too fast, colonel. The last word... Why don't you listen, Beckhardt? The last word is death. Why do you take our blankets? It's cold in Germany too, grandma. - Six. - Bergesen. Six blankets. They steal blankets, pots, pans, food, everything. They kidnap your husband. A great nation? Conquerors, thieves, that's what they are. They ought to be handled in a police court. Finally, Mrs. Bergesen the police court will be set up and the traffic will be enormous. Father, you look tired. Have you a headache? No. You've got two different colours of hair. I'm afraid so. - It's getting blond, isn't it? - No, darling, it's not getting blond. The word is "grey." - Is grey as good as blond? - No, I'm afraid not. Is my hair getting grey? Not that I can see. - Why does your hair get grey? - It's a long story, Solveig. - Were you good in school today? - Very good. I learned about the Germans and Norwegians and Poles and Jews and Englishmen. Russians live over there. French live there. We live here. First come the Germans. They are better than anyone else. And then come the Norwegians, that's us. We're almost as good as the Germans. And then come the French. They are not so good. And then come the Poles, they are very, very bad and nobody talks to them. And then come the Jews and... What's a Jew? Is that what you learned in school today, Solveig? Yes. A German officer taught us today. Modern geography. Listen, darling, you are not to believe that. It's a lie. We're all human beings, that's all. And human beings are good and human beings are bad. And human beings can make themselves better and make themselves worse. We're all God's children, and no matter what they ever tell you in school remember what I said, won't you? Yes, Father. And now, Solveig, you wait here. I must go and speak to your teacher. There's nothing I can do. I suppose I could be a hero refuse to teach them anything more. Quit. But then the children will be left to their mercy. I don't know. If there were only some way I could get out of here. If there were only some way I could fight. There are Norwegians in England. They give them guns. They train them, not so far away. Boats get there. Some do, some don't. All the young men, ages 17 to 25, except a few fishermen are being conscripted to work in the mines of Narvik. Clear the square. Move. Quickly. Johan. This is Erik. Erik. I made it. I lived through it. I came back. Come, Johan. Johan. Bergesen it's me. Erik Toresen. I'll take you home. Come. Johan. I'm home, Mrs. Bergesen. It's a pretty room, isn't it, Erik? Yes. It's a beautiful room. I made it. I lived through it. I came back. I knew they were bad, but I had no idea how bad they were. Nobody no civilized human being can know how bad they are. I have to go now. There's some things that need to be done. Welcome home, Johan Bergesen. Can't you bear to look at me? Thank God I was never a handsome man. For many years, we've made a serious mistake. We believed we were living in a civilized world. Today we find that for years, we've been living in a jungle. Regulations were put into effect, and we attempted to live up to them. Now we discover there's only one regulation: Kill or be killed. I'm ready to observe that regulation. I've come to ask you how we can change over in this jungle from the murdered Norwegian people to the murdering Norwegian people. Erik Toresen, have you ever hit a man in your whole life? When I was 17 years old, I punched Olaf Johnson. He was kissing a girl I thought I was in love with. Half-hour later, I found out every boy in town had also kissed the girl. I apologized to Olaf. Since that time I've lived a quiet life. The Germans have not lived quiet lives. We must learn from them how to become gangsters, thugs useful with knife dynamite, poison. No! Gunnar, you mustn't listen to him. None of us must listen. We can't do anything. All we can do is wait. Let the English win the war. Let the Americans win, or the Russians. All we can do is die. I know how you feel, Anna. I know how all women must feel at a time like this but nobody's going to win the war for anybody else. That's fine talk, but it won't bring Alfred back. - Anna... - They murdered your brother. Now they want you to die too. Don't listen to them, please. Nobody's going to get victory as a gift, Anna. We get only what we earn and I propose that we earn a great deal. If anyone here wishes to be excused please go now. The rest of us will say nothing. We ask only of you that you say nothing. Good. Now we begin to cut ourselves out of this jungle. There will be no service this Sunday, or any Sunday for some time. Under our present government, it is not possible to serve Christ. The Church has no wish to serve such a government. The pastors would rather close churches than betray the religion they serve. I will continue to administer to the sick and dying. May God be with you. Present arms! Quiet. Silence! "And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the peace of thy children. In righteousness shall thou be established..." We are on our way to Narvik. The map says there's a fork in the road. Yes, there is. A hundred yards up there, and then turn to the left. To the left. A sharp turn to the left, not to the right. There's a bad cliff there. We'll be careful. Your Norwegian roads are as bad as your weather. "Almighty God, the consolation of the sorrowful and the strength of the weak may the prayers of them that in any tribulation or distress cry unto thee graciously come before thee so they may receive thy help and comfort through Jesus Christ, thy son, our Lord. Amen." Load! Ready! Aim! Fire! Ah, those vacations in the Hartz Mountains. It's beautiful there in the spring. We took colour pictures of the flowers last year, my wife and I. Springtime in the mountains. A man could cry. - That's very touching, sir. - Very touching. Will that be all, sir? You're a good officer. Executed that fellow with dispatch. That'll teach them not to oppose the orders of the Third Reich. I'm going to let you into a secret. I'm going to recommend you for promotion. - That's very kind of you, sir. - Not at all. - Good night. - Good night, sir. - Orderly. - Yes, sir? - Get me a light. - Yes, sir. Captain! Captain! The colonel's been stabbed! And then the prince said, " Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair." And the princess unbound her golden hair let it out of the window, down the side of the tower and... And then what happened? And down the side of the tower and the prince took hold and climbed all the way up and freed her. Then they were married, and they lived happily ever after. - Erik. - Mrs. Olav. Come in. So we came here. Your farm's hidden in the hills. If they come, there's a better chance of your hiding her. I've hid the cow, and I've more milk than I know what to do with. And it's good milk too. - You've been up late enough. - I think I've been up late enough. - Good night. - Good night. - Sleep well. - I will. On the way, Father told me the most beautiful story about a princess who lived happily ever after. Are princesses the only ones who live happily ever after? We're all meant to live happy, Solveig. Good night. Good night. Come, child. Glad for the night, glad for the day I fold my hands, dear Jesus, and pray keep my lips pure, my face bright, keep my hands busy doing the right. And dear God, bless Father, and all my friends and everybody. But, God, please take the bad people away from our village. Amen. Erik. Erik. - Time you went to bed too. - I can't stay here. I've got to go. - You can hardly stand, you're so tired. - They're liable to follow me. I'll sit at the window and watch. There's only one road. You're safe. Mrs. Olav, it is you who needs rest. An old woman sleeps very little. Go to sleep, son. "Son." I haven't been called that in a long time. So the colonel's been killed. Yes. Was it you? You've got a murderer in your house tonight, Mrs. Olav. God bless you, son. Sleep well. Erik, get up. They're coming. The Germans? Get the child. This way. I'll hide her clothes. - Solveig, darling, hold tight. - Yes, Father. Try the bedroom. - You were a long time in answering. - Sorry. I was in the bedroom. You were still a long time. Come here. - Your name is Olav? - Yes. Erik Toresen is wanted for murder. Have you seen him? No. Look at me. You know the penalty for hiding a murderer? Yes. - I'm glad of that. - No one in the bedroom, sir. We will look outside. Look in that shed. Do not leave me, Mrs. Olav. I have something to tell you. Last night five hostages were taken in the town. If Erik Toresen is not found within two days, they will be shot. Just a little longer, Solveig. We've been going for 10 hours. Where does he get the energy? - He eats better than we do. - And drinks better. All the beer he wants, when he wants it. Makes me thirsty just to think of it. - So? - lf we can't have beer, we drink water. I haven't drunk well water since I left my uncle's farm. We will go. You do not seem to be very impressed about the hostages. No concern of mine. One of them happens to be your grandson Pedar. But he's only a boy, 17. It is quite possible to kill a boy. Hold on. They've gone. You can come up. Come. Come to me, Solveig. That's it. I'm glad that soldier is still thirsty. Solveig, darling, listen to me. I'm going away for a little while and you are to do whatever Mrs. Olav tells you to do. - You understand? - Yes. - And you're not to cry. - I never cry. You know that. I know that. I'll be back soon, dear. Good luck. I thought I saw something moving in here. Well, there's nothing there now. I wish I was home again. Things will be worse before they're better. The captain said in two weeks there'll be hundreds of planes here. General von Breugel is coming down tomorrow. You are the most nervous man in the entire German army. Think there's a Norwegian behind every bush? Erik Toresen. Let me in. - Garmo. - It's past curfew time. May I sit down? What do you want? Garmo, I've heard you've got a boat hidden. I want you to take that boat out and help me get to England. - Where have you been the last week? - Hiding in the woods. I've discovered they're building a secret airfield. In two weeks they'll have hundreds of planes there and a general. They're going to make some kind of an attack. Other men have disappeared and fallen into the hands of the Germans. And when they got back, bad things happened to their friends. I didn't fall into the hands of the Germans. Five men have been killed for the murder of Colonel Von Dorn: Nils Skar, Karl Strom, Vidkun Koni, Pedar Olav... Pedar Olav? - Where are you going? - To give myself up. That'll do no good. It won't bring the men back. No, but maybe tomorrow it'll be 50. And the next day, the whole village. Bergesen was right. Nobody, no civilized human being can know how bad they are. Erik. I have a boat and I'll take you to England, God willing. God willing. I got your message, Garmo. Mrs. Garmo will call at midnight and take you where I'll be waiting for you. I'll be ready. I'll call for you at midnight. Where's the boat? - You'll see then. - Yes. Garmo. - Who else is going? - You'll see at midnight. I'll be there. I want to speak to the captain. Go in. Well? There's a boat leaving for England, with six men on board, maybe more. And probably the man you were looking for, Toresen. Where is the boat? I don't know. - Do you know who any of the men are? - No. But Garmo is going to take me there. All you have to do is follow. No good. They'd see anyone following after 50 yards. We'd get one, the rest would get away. We have to be ingenious. - You didn't hear anything, did you? - No. No. This is a special kind of whistle. For dogs. It's pitched too high for human ears, but dogs' ears can catch the sound. Also detectors. Sound detectors. And the precise spot it comes from. Angle. Bearing. Mr. Arnesen, tonight when you blow this whistle I assure you the sound will be heard. If I have any further orders for you, I shall send for you. You may go. I'll be right back. Garmo. - Everything go all right? - Yes. I'll stand guard here for a moment. Call when you're ready for me to come. Hilma Arnesen, what are you doing here? I followed him. You know that's dangerous. Not for me. For you. - What do you mean? - He warned them. Who? Lars, my husband. He's not a good man. They didn't follow him. Nobody knows we're here. Except you. They'll wait until you all get out in the boat. He has a whistle. A dog whistle. You can't hear it, but their instruments can. You get to a certain place, he'll blow it and warn them. The boats will come out and you'll never know what happened to you. Do you know, Hilma, what will have to be done with your husband? I know. I wish I could be not sorry but it's impossible when you live with a man you love so long. Two children. That's for me. A signal. I've got to go now. You're sure? You're absolutely sure? Yes. I'm sure. - Anything wrong? - No. Shove off. They hear anything at the sound detectors? No, sir. - Stop moving that light! - Stop moving that light! They should be here by now. Nothing yet? Ship oars. I want to listen. Don't move, Arnesen, or I'll strangle you. - Erik, have you gone mad? - Row. All right. Johan, Siegard, row. Something must have gone wrong. May I suggest you send the boat out anyhow, sir? Yes. - Yes. Turn on the light. - Yes, sir. No, wait! Wait. Sir. - We'll wait a little longer. - Yes, sir. - Turn on the lights. - Yes, sir. Turn on the lights. Searchlights! We're out of range. They won't see us now. All right, Arnesen, now you can tell them your story. - I don't know what you mean. - Tell them your story. Remember, I am in the same boat with you. If anything happens to you, it'll happen to me. I want to get to England as much as you. I have just as much to lose as any of you. - I don't know what he's talking about. - Erik. Look at this. A whistle. It doesn't even work. I'll show you. Yes. If you show us, we'll all be dead. Except you, Arnesen. What made you do it? This is no place to hold a trial. You're all excited and nervous. Why did you do it? The Germans are going to win. And they like us. They like the Norwegians, if only we'd give them a chance. You've got to be reasonable about this. We live in a reasonable age. - Why did you do it? - They have something new, that works. I studied the whole question very carefully. What is the use to fight? They have the guns. Tie him up. Please, Garmo. Garmo, you've known me since I was born. Bergesen, you are my brother-in-law. Erik. Erik, remember. You were married in my house. Yes. And you forgot it. Please, please remember. Please, you must. - Oh, please, can't you...? - Out oars. Help! Please! It's English. - What do you want to do in England? - Fight. Fight. - And you? - Fight. - And you? - Fight. - And you? - Fight too. First, I should inform you... First, we must establish that your story is true. Norwegian government officials in exile will be notified of your arrival. All of this will take time. Please inform Admiral Bowen I'd like to see him. It's very important. Your request is hardly in accord with regulations. However, I shall do my best. The rest of you will wait for the Norwegian officials. And you, sir, will accompany me to London. - Cigarette? - Thank you. The airdrome is here. The road to it, around this way, and I'm sure it's heavily guarded. It is possible for someone who knew the place to make his way up along this stream here and reached the airdrome without being seen. All you've told us is interesting, provided it's true. - I have only my word. - And that I can vouch for. - We accept full responsibility? - We do. Harper's decent but being an intelligence officer destroys all faith. An airdrome there can only mean one thing: Our convoys to Russia will be sighted from the air. Would you be willing to guide our commandos to this airdrome? I'd be grateful to the end of my days. - Toresen, you wait outside. - Yes, sir. Take this to Operations. Erik. - It's not possible. - Yes. Yes. Erik Toresen. - I can't believe it. - Yes, it's me. - A signal for you. - What? A signal for you. Take it to Operations. Oh, blast it, I think I'm going to cry. In uniform too. Isn't it disgraceful? I wrote you 10 letters and never sent any of them. I've been thinking of you too, and your danger. You're alive. You're really alive. Norwegians are a sturdy people. Like you English, we don't break easily. You know it's a funny thing, but I don't know what to say. - What are you doing for dinner? - I'd like to have it with you. Good. - So you two have found each other? - Yes, sir. The wheels are beginning to roll. You and I are flying to Scotland tonight. - But, sir, we were having dinner. - Not tonight, I'm afraid. - I'll get leave and come with you. - No room. Then I'll follow. I have no control over your movement whilst you're on leave. - Come on, Toresen. - Yes, sir. We're after something bigger than a 12-pound salmon this time. There you are. This will warm your cold Norwegian bones. Well, cheers. Good to see you, Erik. You know, we've often wondered how you chaps were getting along. Talked about you quite a lot. Well, that is, Judy did most of the talking. So much has happened in such a short time. More will happen, even in a shorter time. These commando raids are tough and quick. Every man is trained to move like clockwork. Erik, you'll need every bit of strength that's in you. So you better get to that bed. Robert it's hard for me to talk. Our people, as you know, are not demonstrative. But we don't forget our friends. Nor our enemies. - Good night, Robert. - Good night, Erik. As tired as I am, I don't think I'll sleep a wink tonight. If you don't sleep tonight, you've got tomorrow. - You know, you've got 24 hours to rest. - Rest? My mind's in a whirl. You know how it is when you're thinking. Solveig. Norway. I won't sleep a wink. Not a wink. Out in front. March. - Hello. - What are you doing here? Special orders. For the first time since the war began, I pulled strings. I wasn't going to let a war do me out of that dinner. Remember? Yes. I remember. - Will you have dinner with us? - Oh, no. Why, thank... Well, I'll see you at headquarters in two hours. I'm hungry. - Those days seem like a dream now. - Yes. Everything has changed. Everything. And England is full of Poles and Russians and Norwegians and Czechs and Americans, all mixed-up. And somehow it isn't important anymore what a man does or who his family is, or what country he belongs to. It's only what he's fighting for that makes any sense. Three years it took me to find that out. Three years to crowd now into 30 short minutes. Time up? Yes, I'm afraid so. You should be back in three or four days. Have you no plans? Oh, yes, I have plans. When I come back, the first thing I'll do is climb off the train go through the gate and call up Admiral Bowen's daughter and ask her to marry me. You won't forget, will you? I won't forget. - You will take care of yourself? - Yes, I'll take care of myself. To the future. - Good evening. - Good evening. Come forward, sir. Slow astern. Both engines. This is the stretch of shore you say is unguarded? Yes, sir. There's a shallow draft at the fjord's entrance. The enemy doesn't believe a ship could pass through. At high tide, there is enough water. - Even though the charts don't show it? - Yes. Very well. We'll now synchronize our watches. - Correct time, please. - 0346, sir. 0346. Good. By 0445 we should be passing through the entrance to the inner fjord. Zero hour will be at 0500 when the landing craft will leave the parent ship. You should be ashore by 0510 reaching the river at approximately 0600. According to plan, you should be at the hill bordering the airport at 0630. - Am I right? - Yes, sir. Good. The airfield will be attacked at 0645. In 30 minutes the job should be done, so let us say at 0715... I shall then go to my daughter. Whilst I should like to help you, I'm afraid that will not be possible. I cannot risk this ship or men for one minute not covered by orders. - May I make a suggestion? - Yes. Wouldn't it be possible that while he's leading us an officer and a few men bring his daughter to our boats? - The farm isn't hard to find? - It's close to the coast. - I could draw a little map. - Very well. I see no reason why Solveig shouldn't be awaiting you upon your return. - Any questions? - No, sir. - Toresen? - No questions at all, sir. Thank you, gentlemen. "My brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places." By the mark, seven, sir. - 8-0 revolutions, navigator. - 8-0 revolutions, sir. And a quarter six, sir. That's very little water for this ship. There's enough to get through, captain. Deep six, sir. And a quarter four, sir. - Deep four, sir. - One cable to go, sir. Stand by, starboard anchor. - Everything ready on one? - Yes, sir, everything ready. - Ready for letting go, sir. - Let go. - Carry on, sir, please? - Carry on. Keep your toes up, keep your toes up. Good hunting. Sergeant? You know where the farm is? - I think I could find it blindfolded, sir. - Good. Carry on. By this time, they should be reaching the river. I sincerely hope so, sir. Enemy battery bearing red, nine, five. Hoist the banner, ensign. Provost, shoot! Shoot! Rapid salvos! Good shooting, guns. - That does it for this trip. - And now to Solveig. She'll be proud of you, and she won't be the only one. - Sergeant. - Sir? Back to the boats. I'll assemble the men, just line them up. Where's my daughter? - Couldn't you find the way? - Yes, sir. - Well, where is she? - The house is burnt down. Burnt down? - A swastika scratched on the ground. - Right where the door had been. - Didn't you find anyone there? - A farmer. We asked him about it. He said they'd taken the old woman and the girl. - Taken them where? - To the village, at the inn. They're holding all hostages there. A swastika on the ground. Erik! - Goodbye, Robert. - Not yet. - But you have your orders. - My orders are that we get Solveig. - Sergeant? - Sir. - Fall in the able men. - Yes, sir. Once I said I didn't know a typical Englishman. Now I know. Come on, let's go. We better get those civilians off the street. Let me do it. Inside. Stay where you are. It's very dangerous. Inside. It's very dangerous. Make sure you stay inside. Quick. Stay there. It's very dangerous. Come on! - Give me a grenade. - Don't. Our people are in there. All right, we'll get closer. Come on! - Move it! - Come on, move along there. Report of the operation was signalled, sir. Thank you. I'm very sorry, sir. About your son, I mean. Two sons, Godfrey. Mrs. Olav, will we ever come back to our home? Yes, Solveig, we'll come back someday. Yes, Solveig, we will come back. We will come back. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wick edness in high places.

I'M STILL HUNGRY, BUT LET'S NOT CHANGE THE SUBJECT. - What about me? - You had your fun, sadist. - That's true. What happened? I got attacked and robbed. Even your boots! - But why? - I couldn't get your stuff. Don't, I'll do it myself. Let me help you. Those animals! - That reminds me of my parents. - What does? My Mom used to shave my Dad on the porch back home. It's all I remember. - Does it hurt? - Not at all. Boy, what it's taken! I don't know where to put my hands. Wait, wait. - Listen... - What? Should we do it? - We can stop. - No, no way. The only thing the bastards didn't touch was my cock. I'll put it inside. Don't pull out. - Now I know. - What? I remember you. I don't get it. When you kidnapped me, you said we had done it. I said I didn't remember. Well, now I remember all right. That's more like it. - Let's move up. - Where? - Up. - Up? Don't move. Stay inside. - Does it hurt? - I don't know. Wait. Don't move. Don't come. - Don't come. - I'm not! Don't laugh, it'll slip out. Wait, don't move. Stay inside. Don't pull out. - I didn't want to wake you. - What's that? A map of my life. Show me. Look. Just imagine my life's a subway line. First stop: orphaned at three years old. Orphanage. I escaped when I was eight. Reformatory. More escapes. - Mental hospital at sixteen. - What a career! There, I get on well, and learn lots of trades. Locksmith's the best, breaking in and out. So I ran away every so often, but I always came back. Why? I had nowhere to go. The director, she liked me. That's why you're such a good lay. With them, it was different. - Were there many directors? - No, but lots of nurses. Now I understand. Go on. I escaped a year ago and met you. That stop changed my life. All I thought about was you. Thinking took up all my time, and I stopped acting crazy. The judge came over, gave me a test... and said I was normal. They let me go. End of the line. - You. - Me. I can't leave her hanging there. I need another scene... or two. Someone find Marina. If it's a question of money, I'll pay for it. - With what? - Money's not the problem, Maximo... but everything has a limit. Perfection's my only limit. Do I have to remind you of your duty as a director? My duty is to warn you the film has no ending. Just add "The End." I won't discuss it. You're going too far! I'll be in the bar, meet me there. Okay. Can someone grab the mags? Thanks, love! What's with your sister? Why doesn't she phone? Don't know! I'll go see what he wants. Yeah, hurry, he might not hire you for his next film. If you're doing it, I'd rather direct traffic! Enough, Maximo. - What's he got against me? - It's not you. He doesn't want to finish the film... because he knows it's his last one. - I know he's unbearable... - I'll say. - He's fighting death. - Yes, but... Can't you tell Marina to call him? - Marina's disappeared. - What do you mean? I haven't seen her since the last day of shooting. Nobody knows where she is. - You two talked that night. - I lied to you. - Have you called the police? - Well, no. You see, the police... Well, I prefer not to. I see. Move. Set the table. Look. Here's Granadilla, my hometown. Not far from Plasencia. I'll steal a car tonight. Not with that face, you won't! I got balls. You don't wanna go? Not in a stolen car, I don't. We'll take a bus, but we're going. The pain's gone, right? - My whole body hurts. - We'll leave tomorrow. It's your door. You knew it! That's why you didn't want to leave! - I swear I didn't! - You tricked me, you whore! Don't hit me! How could I know she had the keys? You talked to Pepe! You could have guessed it! - Don't hurt Lola! - Shut up! I'll be right down! Move your ass, lady! I heard you! She's gone. No need to shout like that! - I just went up to... - C'mon, lady! Don't push me, or I'll stay double-parked! - Like hell you will! - Watch your language! Take your damn hands off my car! - I'm gonna burn it! - You are? - Maybe I'll burn you! - Women! I won't say what I think, else I'd be saying it too macho! We've got to go, we can't wait any longer. - Whatever you say. - I'll go get a car. - I've got a little money. - We'll need it... but we also need a car. Okay. Will you wait for me here... or will you run away? I don't know. Better tie me. Tie me up! This will be the last time. Shit! I forgot the damn radio! Here it is. I'm wetting my pants. Weird... Pepe? Is that you? Come in. - What happened? - I got kidnapped. Untie me. - Kidnapped? But where? - Here and at home. Who did it? Later. He'll be back any minute. The kidnapper? Let's go! You look awful. Did you take any dope? I'll get my purse. What about all this blood? I'm responsible for all of this. My walkman! Leave it, I'll buy you another one. I don't get it. What is it, Marina? - I love him. - What? - I love him. - The man who kidnapped you? You're crazy! Let's go! How can you love someone who ties you up? Do you think that's normal? It's probably the shock, no one's that warped. We'll go to the roof and into the other building. C'mon! Hurry! Hurry up, get inside! The line from Granadilla to Marina... How do you feel? Fine. I brought you a sleeping pill. Here. - Thanks, Lola. - All right... tell me all about it. Don't you trust your sis? - It isn't easy to explain. - How did it happen? The night of the party... Pepe rang the bell to say good-bye. When it rang again, I thought it was him. - You shouldn't have opened. - Yeah, but I did. I started screaming and he hit me. How terrible! - He didn't mean it. - Like hell he didn't! When I regained consciousness... he told me he had kidnapped me... so I could get to know him well. He told me he was 23, and had 50,000 pesetas... that he had no one... and that he'd be a good husband... and a good father to my kids. What a mess! Eleven. He can't hear you. Go on up. Ricky! Marina! You came! With my sister. She wants us to live with my family. - Your family? - And yours from now on. Come on. Let's go. - Lola, this is Ricky. - Hello. - Here, this is yours. - Thanks. Anything else? Is that all? Hang on. - I'm sorry about all this. - So am I. Don't let it happen again. Mind sitting in the back? - What about your car? - I stole it. I thought so. Well, someone will take it. By the way, there's never been a thief in my family. Come on! What about Dad, may he rest in peace? One was enough! Marina says you're a good locksmith. That, a plumber, a carpenter... - An electrician, a mason... - Perfect! I'll find you a job in no time. I suppose you don't mind working, do you? - I want to work. - Good. When we get home... not a word about the kidnapping to my Mom. Don't worry. Is the exam over? Come on, gimme a kiss, I'm not that bad! You two sure had me worried. Let's hear some music. When I lose all the games When I sleep in the arms of solitude When I find no more ways out And night won't let me rest When silence frightens me When I no longer stand on my feet When memories rebel And push me against the wall I will survive And fight for life I will turn Into steel and brace myself And even if life's wind blows harder I'll be like the reed that bends but does not break I will survive And fight for life What is it, silly? We get along just fine! C'mon, baby! I will survive Subtitles by Captions, Inc.

So sad. Bud, if I ever get that old and act like that, would you please shoot me? Why wait? Hi, Mom. Hi, Mom. Leave me alone. Hi, Peg. How you doing? How am I doing? It's my birthday, and you have the audacity to ask me how I'm doing? [SIGHS] The best years of my life are over. And the worst part is I spent them with you. By the way, Al, am I still attractive? Peg, you're still the same knee in the groin you were when you were 16. I don't believe you. You didn't say it with feeling. You are an insensitive hog of a man. Ooh, I've gotta do something to shake these birthday blues. I know. Give me money. I'm gonna shop till you drop. Oh, by the way, Al, this does not get you off the hook for a present, and this year, I want something different. Oh, Peg, I only know how to do it one way. And one day, maybe you'll get it right. No, honey. This year, I want something that lasts longer than three minutes. I want a real gift. I want you to spend money on me, Al. Peg, I have no more money. That doesn't stop me from spending it. God, do I have to do everything around here? Hi, Dad. Hi, Dad. Kids, why didn't you tell me it was your mother's birthday? I wouldn't have come home. Dad, do you know what we love about you? How could I? It's that you're old, but it's okay. Yeah, like Popeye. You yam what you yam. You're the greatest, Dad. [CHUCKLES] I'm broke, son. Don't call me "son." Kelly, let me ask you a question. Daddy, no matter what you heard on the streets, I'm a good girl, and I never would have done that. No, no, no. It's about your mother. Daddy, no matter what you heard on the streets, she's a good girl and she never-- No! I want to talk about her birthday. I don't know what to get your mother. Maybe your being a girl will come in handy for once. Any ideas? Well, it's not as easy as it sounds, Dad. She's real down about this age thing. You've got to understand something. Mom was around before I was even born. It's harder for a woman to get old. There's so many more places to sag. You know, I've seen those college girls just starting to age. The little lines they get around their eyes when they smile, the hair on their knuckles starting to darken, the fear in their face as they find themselves staring at the big 2-5. Well, I guess what I'm trying to say here is that-- Wait. What was the question? Yeah, I'd like to get some flowers for my wife's birthday. What can I get for $3.95? Well, how much for some seeds? Hello? Hello? Oh... Oh, hi, Peg. How you doing? I feel so empty. I shopped and I shopped, and I still couldn't get happy. Look at all this junk. I don't even want half of it. Oh. And as if I wasn't depressed enough, something horrible happened while I was out shopping. You accidentally bought something for me? No. Worse than that. They discontinued my bra. I told you not to wear it out in public. No, you damn shoe salesman. They stopped making it. My Fancy Figure 327 is a thing of the past. Oh, Al... What's gonna become of my breasts? I love how my bosom looks in the Fancy Figure 327. It lifts. It cradles. Al... That is the only style bra I have ever worn. Come on, Peg. The guys will look good in anything. You mean that, Al? You'll still love your little squeezies? [CHUCKLES] Well, sure, Peg, but promise to keep them locked up till the sun goes down. Well... I'm gonna have to do something about it sooner or later, so I bought 15 different bras. This is the only one that comes close... The Maxi-Force 911 EZ Loader. What do you think? Well, I'm thinking on my birthday, do I run to you with my underwear, looking for help? Well, maybe you should. Then I could tell you that the bigger hole goes in front. Yeah, Peg, I sense you're in a mood here. You know, it's just a stinking bra. Who cares? Let me explain it to you so you'll understand. You know how you like to stick your finger in your ear? Well, just suppose that one day that ear closed up and the finger didn't fit anymore. I'd use your fingers, like I do when you're sleeping. Doesn't anyone understand? Peggy... I just heard about your bra. I'm so sorry. Do you have a backup? No. Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk. Peggy, you have got to plan ahead. Now, I have a backup, and I break it in gradually so it's not such a shock, and I'm always out scouting. The Pretty Petite 204 looks promising. Oh, but that's more of a power bra. What you need is a nice, all-purpose utility bra. Mmm, but with more women joining the workforce, those are hard to find. Oh, tell me about it. I don't know why we even need bras. Well, I think it's to keep your breasts off the plate when you eat. You know, if we put an apple in his mouth, we could have a luau. No. He's got to go to work tomorrow and earn that big money. [LADIES LAUGH] [SIGHS] You know who we have to blame for this whole bra problem? Me? No, men. They design and manufacture bras not for the bosoms that we have, but for the bosoms that they want. Do you know what would happen if men had breasts? We wouldn't need women anymore? And if you had what other men have, I wouldn't need batteries anymore. That's what happened to my Diehard! Come on, Peggy, let's go upstairs and see if we can piece some of your old bras together. That should tide you over till you can break in a replacement. Oh, Marcy, what am I gonna do? That bra was the only thing in this house that felt good when it held me. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] I'm glad you're here. I need a bra, Steve. Some makeup wouldn't hurt, either. I'm in real trouble here, Steve. They discontinued my wife's bra, yet my wife lives on. If I don't get her a good birthday present, I'm in big trouble. It could get ugly. She could want affection. As we know, affection is just a hammerlock away from sex. So, what's the problem? Just get her her old bra, and you can hang up the big guy for another year. That's a nice dream, Steve, but I can't do it. She's looked everywhere in town. She can't find that bra. Ah, but she hasn't tried Francine's of Hollywood in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. It's the ultimate lingerie store. That's where I send for those special, um... items I get for Marcy. Do you think they'd have her bra? Their motto is, "If you've got the boulders, we've got the holders." It's a long way to go though, isn't it? PEGGY: Oh, they don't look right! Al, come up here and hold me. I'll drive. I knew women looked like this. I knew it. I knew it. Excuse me, sir. Would you know where they put the bun sparkle? I think they keep that in the produce department. Thanks. Whoa! So many things I want. May I help you? Uh, yes. We'd like to buy some breasts. Er, bras. And breasts. Actually, uh, we're up from Chi-Town. We're interested in the Fancy Figure 327 for my friend here. Size? Oh, gee, I don't know, uh... About this tall. Oh, I see. Don't be embarrassed. We often cater to people like you. Now, what size does your boyfriend like to see you in? No, no, no! You don't-- You don't understand. We're married. Not to each other! To, uh...women. And if I was gay, I'd like to think I could do better than him. What's that supposed to mean? You don't turn me on. There, I said it. Anyway, I'm looking for a bra for my wife, who is a woman...sort of. Well, then, I'll need to know her cup size. Is she my size? Sir? Oh, I'm sorry. I was sweating into my eyes. What did you say? What's her cup size? Oh, like, uh... Oh, miss, excuse me. Could you help us out here a minute? Sure. Um...um. What do you think, Steve, about like this? I'm not speaking to you. Uh... I'm sorry, sir, but I'm gonna have to take them away now. We have to try on some stuff. Oh... Anyhow, they're about like this. Oh, 36C. You're a lucky man. Yeah, if they came à la carte. Just give me 10. Okay. Let's see the Japanese build a better one of those. Steve, aren't you ashamed of yourself? Huh? Oh, come on, Al. She was asking for it. You see how she's dressed. Al, I'm feeling a little fevered. I'm just gonna go over there and cool off. Hey, Pops. How they hanging? Not too bad, son. Not too bad. I see you ordered the Fancy Figure 327. Solid bra, a bra with its feet on the ground. A real man's bra. [LAUGHS] Ah, look at that... And they wonder why we call 'em queens. Yeah...there ought to be a law. WOMAN: Pops! Phone. It's your wife. Nag, nag, nag, eh, buddy? [LAUGHS] Sheesh. Well, nice try, Marce, but now the right one lifts, and the left one cradles. Till now, the guys have always worked as a team. Well, this is just to tide you over till you find the one you want. That's what Mother said about Al. Now look at me. Thinking of Al is not going to help anyone. [DOORBELL RINGS] Yeah, you're right, but I can't help it. I feel lower than I did on our honeymoon when I realized Al wasn't holding back. Oh, I'm sorry. Kelly's not home. Mrs. Bundy? Yes. You're under arrest. What for? Parking tickets. Oh, well, that can't be. That's impossible. My car isn't even registered. Officer, isn't there something we can do about this? We can dance. [MARCY SQUEALS] [FUNKY ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Happy birthday, Peggy! Oh, hi, Al. I was just outside checking the car. The meter's a little low. I'm gonna need about $6 in quarters. Here are your bras, sir. Would you like some paddles to go with them? No. I don't have a Ping-Pong table. Excuse me, sir. Are you straight? The hairs on my chest are. Oh, good. Maybe you can help me. If you were my boyfriend, would you like this? Will he like it? Or do you think he'd like it better without the bra, like this? Yeah, you're right. I don't need the bra. You know, they change everything good. Remember full-service gas stations? They used to give you gas, change your oil and wash your windows. Now they just look up your dress, say, "Pay before you pump," and, "America, phooey." They do it with TV shows too. Remember Mission: Impossible? They canceled it. What did they replace it with? Mission: Impossible. I miss eight-track tapes. I'm not paying you to speak, dear. Hi, Mom. Dad dead? No. Well, then, I guess this is a good time to discuss my new allowance. Don't worry, Bud. He's just an exotic dancer that Mrs. Rhoades got for Mommy's birthday. It's just a rental. Hi, Mom. Dad dead? Just in spirit. Well... I gotta go. Bar exam tomorrow. Happy birthday, ma'am. You're very gifted. Mind if I get dressed upstairs? Oh, yeah. First door on the right. Just follow the trail of tears. [CLEARS THROAT] I know it's anticlimactic, but we got you some presents too. Oh, you didn't have to do that. I told you we didn't have to do this. Why do I listen to you? It's Mom's birthday. Drop dead, will you? Here. Open mine first. Ohhh... Al Jolson's Greatest Hits. Oh, honey. It's a 78. [LAUGHS] I knew Kelly's would bomb. Now, open mine. Unlike Kelly, I knew you were down about your birthday, so I got you something to make you feel better. Mrs. Yesterday's Wrinkle Remover? "Smear the years away." You know, I'm telling you, when you got your family, you've got it all. Kids... No supper tonight. Get out. That settles it. I'm a bachelor for life. And a virgin. Dad, if you're smart, you'll toss the present like a hand grenade and sleep at the bus station like us. Al, it's my birthday. Where have you been? Oconomowoc. Francine's? I don't know. Have you been a good little girl? Yes, I have. Yes, I have! Oh, Steve. I've been bad. I've been very bad. Well, come on, then. Yeah, that's a healthy marriage. Guess what I got you. A senior citizen's bus pass? [SIGHS] Oh, Al! It's my Fancy Figure 327. I can't believe this. You found it. I got 10 of them, so as long as they live, the guys will always have a roof over their heads. Oh, Al... You are the sweetest man in the whole world. I know. Oh, honey. Where did you get the handcuffs? Oh... They were a gift. Al, you don't think I'm getting old, do you? Peg, you look just the way you did the day I married you. Only difference is today I'm not dead drunk. Oh, Al. All right, Peg, we both know this isn't the end of it. Let's get to it. Let's go upstairs. See, you're never satisfied. Do you know what I had to go through to get that present? I had to drive to Wisconsin. I had to reassure Steve that I find him attractive. I had to sit in the store for an hour and look at nothing but, uh... Yeah, let's go upstairs. [LAUGHS] [GIGGLES] AL: Peg, who's the cop with his pants on backwards? [***] [whooshing] [roaring] [Man on radio]: T.U.A., three five heavy, descend to 3000 feet. [Pilot]: Minneapolis center, this is Trans-Universal three five heavy, descending to 3000. [Radio]: Roger, T.U.A. three five heavy. T.U.A. three five heavy, could you give me your location? Ron, where the hell are we? 25 miles due south on approach, descending through 5000 feet. [Radio]: Three five, what is your current heading? What's his problem? Minneapolis, we are currently heading zero- [Radio]: T.U.A. three five, turn to heading- [static] Say again, Minneapolis. [suspenseful music] Jesus, down. Oh my God. Down, go down. [metal crunching] My God, we hit 'em, we hit 'em! [alarm blaring] Minneapolis, this is T.U.A. three five. Declaring an emergency, we hit another aircraft. Looked like a 10. Three and four shutting down, cutting fuel to three. We are going down, repeat, going down. How much of the wing is gone? Ron, get back there. See how much we have left. Right. [rhythmic buzzing] [explosions] [thrilling music] [music becomes peaceful] [propellers] [planes passing overhead] - [Woman]: There he is. - [Man]: Excuse me! [reporters clamoring] [helicopter idling] Mr. Smith, I'm Kevin Briley, from the Minneapolis office- And you're not doing your job. Round these people up and shove 'em in a room somewhere. Make no statement 'till I get back. Ashby, tell 'em what we need. Right, c'mon, move it. The rest of y'all, let's go. - Move it! - Back up, back up. Come on, people, let's go now, do it! [ominous music] [Investigator]: Where'd the DC-10 go down? [Pilot]: 10 miles to the south. Jerry, Eli, go take a look. Tom and I'll put down here. [eerie music] Wanna give me a hand with this? [workers talking] [Man]: Bill. Alright. [Man]: Bill. [Man #2]: Get the flashlight over here! We were just going after the flight data recorder. You wanna do that next? Sure. I think that the DC-10 site came down a lot harder than this one. What happened here? Well, he managed to get it level, but you might have noticed there's only three engines. One came down south of here. So he lost a lot of wing? We think so, yeah. We started on the site map, and the cops have finally stopped moving things around. [distant sirens] Look, Bill, uh, we're being very careful but we don't think that this is a structural failure, natural. Do you have any numbers yet? Yeah, yeah, got 'em right here. [men shouting] This one had 354 and 13 crew and the 10 had 265 and 11. Watch that wing section there. Do you already have the cockpit voice recorder? Yeah, we have it, but it's pretty battered. They're working on it now. I want a dub made before you send it on to Washington. Alright, I'll tell 'em, but it might not be too good. [Man]: It's a silly rule. Why should the boys in Washington hear it first? I gotta hear what those poor bastards were up against after they hit the 10. I'm sure they did their best. They always do. Are you one of Roger's team? I'm Dr. Arnold Mayer. I'm the investigator in charge, Bill Smith. Bill Smith, yes, I know. I've read many of your crash reports. Naturally I've heard of you, Doctor. What's your interest here? You want me to leave? No, it doesn't matter. All this just seems pretty far removed from your physics lab. Maybe scientists should leave the lab more often. They might learn some things. Dr. Mayer, what's an ecology professor doing at a crash site? Do you know someone on the plane? Not that I'm aware of. How did you hear about the crash, sir? I got a call from a television [drowned out] He's the last guy I'd expect to find out here. Yeah, actually, he's not. He's been to several midwest crashes. That big one in '79 at O'Hare, he was all over that one. I wonder why. I don't think it will win him another Nobel prize. Over here, I got it! There's a whole mob here from Boeing, and the man from McDonnell Douglas is on the way. Wes Lake from the F.B.I is here, and the assistant D.A. from Ramsey County. Okay, the usual gang. Mr. Janz, I'm Bill Smith of the NTSB. Mr. Smith, my name is Raymond Leacock. I represent Mr. Janz. Is this a formal deposition? Not yet. I'm sitting in on this. Bill, meet Ian Carpenter. He's with the Air Traffic Controllers Organization. Mr. Janz, I know this is a hard time for you. I want to hear what you saw, and what your actions were. We were handling 40 flights, three of us, plus the private planes. The screen was so crowded. And a goddamned headache. I was tired. 35 was coming in from the east. No, from the west, and 880 was coming in. Was that the 747, Don? I looked away for a moment. Some other situation. And when I looked back, they'd changed places. I told 35 to turn. They were close, man. And then the numbers switched. You couldn't tell 'em apart anymore. Somebody's got these guys working harder and faster than I've ever seen. Well, that DC-10 was pretty public. It spread itself over a field not half a mile from the Interstate. Right. And they don't want people gawking at their... What was it they called that crash in Florida? Involuntary conversion. I think they made a profit on that when the insurance paid off. Yeah, well, they sure are busting their asses on this one. Look at that, they even got the ticket agents serving coffee. [Man]: Mr. Keane, where does this go? What do you wanna do with this stuff? Did I tell you you could touch that? Excuse me. Put that down! Just put that down. Hey. How about some coffee? Hey, wait a minute. I think she likes you, Bill. What'd I do? Could it be your breath? I thought you always got that reaction. Gentlemen, they're ready to play the cockpit tapes. [Pilot]: Minneapolis, we are currently heading zero- [Controller]: T.U.A. three five, turn to heading- [static] [Pilot]: Say again, Minneapolis. ...Jesus, down. [Copilot]: Oh my God. [Pilot]: Down, go down. [metal crunching] [alarm blaring] [Copilot]: My God, we hit 'em, we hit 'em! [Pilot]: Minneapolis, this is T.U.A. three five, declaring an emergency: We hit another aircraft. Looked like a 10. [Flight engineer]: Three and four shutting down, cutting fuel to three. [Pilot]: We are going down, repeat, going down. [Engineer]: How much of the wing is gone? [Pilot]: Ron, get back there, see how much we have left. [Engineer]: Right. Would you like some coffee, Mr. Smith? Dammit, I'm listenin'- [Pilot]: Still going down. Is there any place to land? [Copilot]: I'll check- [clicks button] Can you rewind that a little? [garbled audio] [Pilot]: Still going down. Is there any place to land? [Copilot]: I'll check for a field. [Pilot]: Just look for a flat place, anything. We'll be on the ground in- [Engineer]: They're dead, they're all dead. [Pilot]: What the hell's he talking about? Sit down for Christ's sake, Ron. [Engineer]: They're dead, all of 'em, they're burned up. [flames and crunching metal] [Pilot]: Jesus. [Copilot]: Yes, here it comes. [flames roaring] [loud crash] [silence] Was that Kennedy shouting? Yeah, Rockwell couldn't understand him. Run that last part through again. I'll see if I can clean it up a bit for ya. [Pilot]: Just look for a flat place, anything. We'll be on the ground in- [Engineer]: They're dead, they're all dead! [Pilot]: What the hell's he talking about? Sit down for Christ's sake, Ron. [Engineer]: They're dead, all of them, they're burned up. [Pilot]: Jesus. [clicks button] Burned up? They were going to be. They might as well have been dead already. Makes me sick. Yeah, but it doesn't make sense. You expect him to make sense at a time like that? No, not like that. Okay, I'll back the pilots. Like they say, they're the first on the scene of the accident. But how many crash tapes have you heard? God, too many. But how many times do you hear a man come apart like that? [sighs] Okay, but it's gotta happen sometime. He goes back there and sees all those people who are gonna die and it's too much for him. Obviously they hadn't burned up yet. Well, what about, if, uh, maybe, maybe there was a fire in the cabin, maybe they were burned up already? Sorry, but that won't work. The fuselage was unaffected by fire until after impact. He just broke under the strain. Get me a transcript of that tape. Roger, set up a press conference for tonight. Let's go see what the dead have to say about it. This gymnasium, is this the biggest place they could find? [Keane]: Oh, Bill, I've got something interesting for you. These are pretty good bodies in here. Next door we got stuff from the DC-10, which is mostly pieces, can't be identified. Next of kin are gonna have to look at personal effects, mostly, not many faces to show them. Then the F.B.I. takes over. We'll be lucky to tag 60% for fingerprints and dental charts. Not enough hands, not enough heads. We autopsied a few, and they died of trauma, dismemberment, burns, the usual. We gotta get some reefer trucks in here, and some airtight coffins- Yeah, they're on their way. Look, I only got this place for two days. I got a dance- Trucks will be here. Okay. Now, here's what I wanted you to see. Two kinds of watches, okay? Mechanicals here, and digitals here. Now, these digitals didn't do so good. Mostly they're blank. Heat must have wiped 'em out. But we did find this. Yeah, so what? Well, so take a closer look. It's going backwards. This better not be a joke. It's not. Somebody had a gag watch. Well, we thought of that. Look at this. [crowd chattering] Good evening. You all have copies of the prepared statement. I'm William Smith, investigator in charge. I'll try to answer your questions, but I warn you, we don't know much more than is in that statement. Who wants to go first? [Man]: Mr. Smith! [all clamoring] Sir, there have been rumors of some type of computer error being the cause of this crash. Can you confirm this? That's being looked at. I can't say more at this time. [clamoring] When can we talk to the controller who was handling the planes? You'll have to take that up with the man's lawyer. Mr. Smith, you're on record as issuing a pretty harsh indictment of the FAA for failing to require anti-collision devices on all commercial and private aircraft, even though, as you note, these devices have been available for over a decade. Would you care to comment? Dr. Mayer, do you have any idea what caused this crash? One of Newton's Laws, I suspect, the one about gravity. Beyond that I don't know any more than you do. Can I have an interview, Doctor? Gentlemen, please, I have to get in there and ask some questions of my own. Would you care to reply to the charge made by Mr. Carpenter? No reply at this time. Next question. Mr. Smith, I'm Dr. Arnold Mayer, professor of physics at the university. [Bill]: I remember you. Thank you. My question has nothing to do with overloaded computers or negligent air traffic controllers. [Bill]: That should be refreshing. I doubt it. What unusual facts have you developed so far in your investigation? I'm not sure I know what you mean. Were there any unexplained observations? Is there any indication that this crash was caused by something less obvious than a computer overload? None at all, of course, every crash is unique. Yet they share common factors. There are things you expect to find and things you don't. For instance, is there anything in the cockpit voice recording that's out of the ordinary? I can't comment on that; it's confidential. The relevant portions will be released in a couple of days. You can listen for yourself. Alright, but is there anything else odd? Have you found any unusual item in the wreckage? Any discrepancies in the time sequence of the crash? [coughing] I'm afraid I still don't know what you're driving at. I can't be more plain without sounding like a fool. I'm simply looking for the inexplicable; I usually find it. Look, somebody made a mistake, and a lot of people died. In a few days we should be able to tell you what went wrong. There's no mystery about it. Then I salute you. I'll read your report with interest. [Woman on P.A.]: All T.U.A. personnel, please check with your supervisor for shift changes. So, is there anything else you need tonight? I want the salvage team to work through the night. You got it. Better keep crew at the hangar, too. Might as well start getting it all sorted out. Alright, it's done. Oh, my secretary managed to get you a room at the Marriott. Tom, you're staying at the Holiday Inn. Privilege of rank, I guess. Why? They got a big beauty pageant there tonight. Miss I-94. You know, I hear the bar's pretty wild. Well, I'm outta here. Thanks, Roger, your people did a great job. Our usual service. Alright, well, I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. [P.A.]: Los Angeles passenger Mr. George Kelliman, please pick up the white courtesy telephone. [door chimes] Mr. George Kelliman to the white courtesy telephone, please.. I keep running into you. If you're not running away. I had to get out of that hangar. I thought I was going to be sick. I guess you get used to it after a while. [escalator clanks] [chuckles] Excuse me. Well, we could be stuck here for hours. Maybe we'd better get acquainted. I'm Louise Baltimore, and you're Bill Smith. How long is it since you slept? Do I look that bad? I didn't say bad, just tired. It's gotta be 30, 35 hours, but who needs sleep? Listen, maybe we could go have coff- Some dinner, and a few drinks, that'd be nifty. Am I moving too fast for you? I can move fast, too. Let's go. You should be careful, picking up strange women. You never know where it might lead. [gasps] Taxi. We could take my car. What kind of car do you drive? What kind? That's mine. You smoke too much. I'll quit tomorrow. Just like that, huh? I've heard that story before, took me over a year to quit. You don't believe me? This is my last cigarette. Was it that good? You were the best thing in 1000 years, Bill. I was, wasn't I? I'm stunned. Why? It's been so long since I've... enjoyed myself... let alone been swept away. Do you believe in fate? I will if you will. I think it was fate that brought us together. You may be right. I want to spend more time with you. I'd like that. We'll have all day tomorrow. We'll have all tomorrow night, anyway. This job is killing you, Bill. You need to take a rest. Take it with me. The first rule is... never go to bed with anybody crazier than yourself. I don't know if you're crazier, but you're right up there in the top ten of my weird list, lady. If you knew me better... I'd be number one. [romantic music] [coughs] Yes, I'd like to cancel the 6:30 wakeup. Yes. Damn it, they were supposed to call me. Well, they can't start 'till you get there. Bill, you remember we were talking about fate? Sure, I remember. Maybe that's why they didn't call you. Are you listening to me? I don't get it. This job is wearing you down. I know it is. I can't just walk away from it, Louise. Why not? The world's not gonna come to an end if you just walk away. I haven't had a vacation in six years, I got one coming. In one week, I'll have this investigation started, and I can hand it over to someone else. Then I'm gonna take a long look at my life. Maybe we can go away somewhere together. Anyway, we got tonight. I may not be here tonight. We'll talk about it tonight. Louise? [mysterious music] Louise? Now, as to systems surrounding engine number four, which was the one that sheared off in the collision, let's consider the fuel feed first. You'll find that on page 19 of the computer printout. [rustling papers] Everybody got that? On line five you will see there was a momentary surge when fuel line number four was severed along with 25 feet of wing tip. They'll have a better figure on that by tomorrow, they tell me. [phone rings] Smith. Julie, thanks for calling back. No, it has nothing to do with the investigation. I can't understand it. She was wearing a T.U. outfit. That's right, Baltimore, like the city. First name, Louise. I guess I made a mistake, then. Thanks, Julie. ...It looks like the captain had very little control. Good night, fellas. Good night. We're locking up, Mr. Smith. What's that? There'll be a guard on that door over there. Just knock on the glass when you want to go. I'll do that. Good night. Hell of a mess, huh? One hell of a mess. Good night. [lights clicking rhythmically] [faint beeping] [suspenseful music] [rapid beeping] [electricity crackles] Smith, isn't it? I'm not sure. Looks like the pictures I saw. Is he dead? Stunned. God dammit. Where's the stunner? There. He must have been fooling with it. Is he out? Our luck, he's probably seeing and hearing everything. If he is, it's already too late. [sighs] God, what else can go wrong? Let's get the hell out. Smith, you're gonna be all right. You don't know me and I can't tell you who I am. But you're endangering a project that's bigger than you can imagine. Forget about this. There's gonna be a paradox if you don't. You... You... Coventry, send the gate. [ethereal whirring] [Bill wheezes] My God, do you think...? We didn't make those planes crash, I swear it. [whirr grows louder] [Man on P.A.] Stand by for time travellers arriving through gate Gantry D. Operator, prepare for arrival. We have major problems. What happened? We got the stunner. Imagine my relief. [P.A.]: Louise, I want an explanation. Our master's voice. There was a little problem. Those words will be engraved in the annals of understatement. Your mother was a cash register. And she turned a tidy profit, too. Louise, what happened? [P.A.] All gate operators, report to decontamination center on shutdown. Do you see that? Do you see the red blob on the timeline? That is 1989. That's where you just went. And there's the mess you left behind you. It's a goddamn paradox, Louise. [Louise]: It's a potential paradox. You sent me back to get the stunner we lost. Well, here it is. What you didn't mention was that Smith was there. He'd already found it and stunned himself. And I don't think he was out when we found him. I think he saw us. Sir, I have a timequake approaching. [speaking into P.A.] Paradox, time quake approaching. Four, three. [alarms] [rumbling] A paradox, Louise. You've changed the past. I know damn well we can't change the past. It catches up with us. We change. Well, we haven't changed much. We're all still dying, this place still stinks, and you are still as ugly as ever. One not much bigger than that could destroy us completely. Look, you're the one that's supposed to scan the past. Why didn't you know Smith was gonna be in that hangar? And you're supposed to be ready for the unexpected. You're supposed to be the best. You and your people get all the best food, all the best quarters, all our precious medicine. Do you realize what it costs to pamper you? He was there, he was in the dark. What did you want me to do, kill him? Oh, you'd like that. Killing him would create the worst paradox imaginable. His life affects thousands of other lives in an endless chain, and if you break it- You get a thousand years of bad luck. And none of us is here anymore. Alright. Let's go find out what happened. Maybe we can still do something. All I'm getting is temporal censorship from her jump. Scan past it. What does temporal censorship mean? It means we can't see where we've been, or where we're going to. We can only go back to a specific moment once, and never to that same moment again. Too bad. If we could see where were gonna go- You'll get used to it, Susan, after you've done a few more missions. There he is, in the shadow. Give us rapid scan until he moves. Louise? He knows my name. You probably dropped your calling card. Louise. I didn't mention my name, neither did anyone else. How does he know my name? He's got the initiator. Smith had met me before, hadn't he? How else would he know your name? I'd never been back to that era. Do you want me to spell it out for you? Give it a try, would ya? In Smith's time he has met you before. In your time you have met him only once, in the hangar, which means you will go back and meet him earlier. I spoke to him, Sherman. That was not a good idea. I didn't like talking to him, Sherman. I didn't like it at all. You were not helping him. What's that supposed to mean? This seems to be my day for spelling out the obvious. I suppose I should not complain. Come on, you old fraud, prep me for the 1963 flight. [Woman on P.A.]: '63 mission will proceed to stage one. The 63 mission will proceed to stage one. You did not smoke enough, Louise. Give it to me straight, doc, I can take it. No new degeneration. The levels of complex hydrocarbons in your blood are depressed, due to breathing the primordial atmosphere of the 20th century. They think their air is awful, they ain't seen nothin' yet. Maybe I should replace those kidneys. Maybe a little kick, get the ol' blood moving? Speed kills, my dear. [P.A.]: Uniform and hair for lookalikes will proceed to stage two. Uniforms and hair for lookalikes will proceed to stage two. Sometimes I think you want me to live forever. Okay, so explain it to me. It's what you were built for. You don't expect me to know what's going on in my own head, do ya? Hardly. All right, on a normal mission, when you are taking people who are about to die off doomed airplanes you do not mind treating them roughly. All done. It's 'cause I'm helping them. Obviously, without you, those people would be dead. So you can function without remorse. But with Smith it was different. I don't think I want to hear any more. [bird twittering] How's the little feather head today? Louise loves you, Orville, yes, she does. Polly want a chemical free sterilized cracker? I should take you to 1963. You could fly. Would you like that? Huh, would you like that? You left Smith helpless and confused, so there was pain in you. Alright, I felt sorry for the bastard. But, I'd-a shot him if it'd straighten things out. As Coventry said, you did not have that choice. What choices do I have? You say I have to go back, because he met me before. Yes. What if I don't go back? What happens to the universe? You must go back. Where's my free will? Did you lose it? I will look around for it. This is awful. If you think that's bad, take a look at this. We located the 1963 crash while you were away. It is likely you will go tomorrow. How are you on the idiom and history? I know it like the back of my hand. Who was the U.S. president? Johnson. No, wait, uh, he was assassinated by... Vito Corleone? [chidingly] Louise. [zapping] [garbled whirring] We've talked about quarks and antineutrinos, but what about people? It's quite a step from demonstrating that subatomic particles can travel backward through time, to saying that people can. What would be the result of people travelling in time? For one thing, paradoxes become possible. Say you build a time machine, go back, and murder your father when he was 10 years old. That means you were never born, and if you weren't how did you build the time machine? It's the possibility of paradoxes that make most people rule out time travel by human beings. Still, why not? If you were careful you could do it. You would not go back to kill Adolf Hitler, much as you might like to. Because it would change history. The time traveler would have to be careful, but he could do a surprising number of things. He could observe, for one. Find out once and for all who was on the grassy knoll that day in Dallas. And he will know what we can only guess at, that we are destroying the planet we live on by complacency. He will have to live with our legacy of pollution and acid rain. Our negligence today is producing a world in which our children's children will be barren, and the human race heading towards extinction. He could also take things, providing they wouldn't be missed. A cup of water from the Pacific Ocean, a stone from the Grand Canyon. This may sound pointless... but sometimes very small differences can be crucial. The difference between a dead man... and a man who's alive can be very small. What about a man who is about to die, a man no one will ever see alive again. [Woman on P.A.]: Stage three alert, all sections go. This is the hard part about looking for time travelers. They don't want to be found. You must look for them in places where no one is, or where there are people no one will ever see alive again. [foreboding music] [Man on P.A.]: All personnel stand by for departure. Go, go! [startled cry] [P.A.]: Gate attendants, pick up new arrivals, pick up new arrivals. [Pilot]: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is your captain speaking. We are cruising at an altitude of 31,000 feet, [stunner zaps] at a ground speed of 460 miles per hour. If you look out the right side, through the clouds, you can see the Finger Lakes. Our expected time of arrival is on schedule at 4:30. So sit back and relax, and enjoy the flight. [stunner zaps] Alright, send the others. Everything's nice and quiet. Let's keep it that way. [Man on P.A.]: Gantry operators prepare for arrival. Extreme radiation danger. May I get you a pillow, sir? Sure. [stunner zaps] Prepare holding pens for arriving passengers. [whirring and buzzing] [stunner zaps] I'm through up here. What's up? Well, there's a guy acting funny. He's watching us too close. - Get up, hey! - [screams] [screaming] You're gonna take me to see the captain. Sir, you can't shoot that. If you depressurize the cabin you'll kill us all. Nobody gets hurt if I see the captain. [gunshot] [screaming continues] You stinking son of a bitch. [loud zap] Oof! Hey, wake up, get in there and cork the crew. You know the flight plan. Keep it steady. Alright, Squad Martin, fast and dirty. This one's falling apart. [suspenseful music] [alarms blaring] Did that man shoot her? Don't worry, honey, it's gonna be alright. When she fell- I want you to sleep now. [stunner zaps] [P.A.]: Attention, attention, initiation phase has commenced. All recovery team personnel stand by. [Coventry]: 63 flight in force field. Holding, all systems engaged. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats. Ladies and gentlemen, please move toward the rear of the plane. Excuse me, would you mind telling me what's going on? [P.A.] Please step onto the raft, Walk quickly to the bottom, and follow instructions. You will be taken to a safety area. Let's get you out of here. You idiot, that's the survivor. Buckle him in and come and help me with Susan. Please step onto the ramp. Walk quickly to the bottom, and follow instructions. You will be taken to a safety area. Please step onto the ramp. Walk quickly to the bottom, and follow instructions. You will be taken to a safety area. Please step onto the ramp. All substitute bodies will be placed strictly according to the passenger list. Passengers now in transit. Prepare to activate holding pen force fields. So now we know a hijacker caused this crash. We know there was a survivor. We know when it crashed. We just have to duplicate it. I stopped it. I stopped the bullet. You saved us all, kid. Hang in there, you're gonna be all right. He must have fired his gun in the cockpit. Have Djakarta attach a 5K bomb to the wind screen. That should duplicate the effect. I lost it. What, Susan? what did you lose? Stun. Stunner, I lost the stunner. [ominous music] [alarm blaring] Look out! Stop it! Hold the gate! Stop her. Baltimore, get out of there, get out! No time, Louise, no time! Louise, there's a bomb. [explosion] One of my team was shot. In the confusion, a stunner was lost. It was too late to go back and get it. [Man]: You know the prevention of paradox is more important than individual lives. Blame is secondary at this point. The first stunner you lost in 1989 ended up briefly in the possession of Bill Smith. He knows what it can do. Then you went back to 1963 and lost another stunner. The computers estimate it wound up in the possession of Arnold Mayer. If he learns what it can do, he might be capable of learning how it works. The council has decided to risk another mission to 1989. You must meet Smith the day before you saw him in the hangar. You must prevent him from going to that hangar the night he saw you there. Since he knew your name when he saw you, he must have met you previously. Therefore, you did go back. Must go back. Seems I can't get away from you. I would be a poor personal robot if you could. I lost a very good girl on that plane, Sherman. And what was the council's epitaph for her? "Preventing a paradox is more important "than individual lives." Susan knew that. She accepted it. I just... [sighs] I couldn't leave her. It is not necessary to destroy your soul in this job, Louise. But a certain amount of violence will be done to it. You made the wrong choice. It is easy for them to make cold choices, Louise. They are hardly human anymore. Am I so different? We're all dying, they're just a little further along. You are different. You have feelings. [inspiring music] They want me to go back again. You have to go back. He must be kept out of that hangar. This isn't a job for me, Sherman. You want somebody bashed in the head, I'm your girl. You will have to learn new methods. You can do it. I know you can. Then let's go do it. [Bill]: Somebody's got these guys working harder and faster than I've ever seen. [Keane]: Well, that DC-10 was pretty public. Spread itself over a field not half a mile from the interstate. Right. They didn't want people gawking at their... What was it they called that crash in Florida? Involuntary conversion. I think they made a profit on that When the insurance paid off. Well, they sure are busting their asses on this one. Take this coffee over there, would you? Look at that, they even got the ticket agents serving coffee. Put that down, just put that down! What do I do with this stuff? Did I tell you you could touch that? Excuse me. Hey, how about some coffee? Hey, wait a minute. [Pilot]: Declaring an emergency; we hit another aircraft. Looked like a 10. [Engineer]: Three and four shutting down. Cutting fuel to three. [Pilot]: We are going down, repeat, going down. [Copilot]: How much of the wing is gone? [Pilot]: Ron, get back there. See how much we have left. [Engineer]: Right. Would you like some coffee, Mr. Smith? after the senior prom in high school. [Pilot]: Still going down. Is there any place to land? [Copilot]: I'll check. [recording shuts off] Alright, Sherman, he's seen me again. I think he's interested. What next? What now, Sherman? Think of something. Take him to dinner, someplace romantic. [Louise]: How do I do that? Pick him up, my dear. How? [Sherman]: Drop your hankie, wiggle your behind. You're the woman, Louise. You figure it out. Just be subtle. Louise is about as subtle as a lead pipe. Thanks. These should be appropriate to the era, as well as stimulating to the contemporary male. [comical music] Sorry about the high heels. [cheerful music] [Woman on P.A.]: Standby passenger D. Lawrence, report to Gate 17. D. Lawrence to Gate 17. [romantic music] Standby passenger D. Lawrence, report to Gate 17. D. Lawrence to Gate 17. I keep running into you. If you're not running away. I had to get out of that hangar. I thought I was going to be sick. I guess you get used to it after a while. Oh. [chuckles] Excuse me. Well, we could be stuck here for hours. Maybe we'd better get acquainted. [gasps] Taxi. We could take my car. What kind of car do you drive? What kind? That's mine. Why don't you get in? You got the keys? Keys? [rapid beeping] [lock clicks] [engine starts] [tires screeching] [Bill]: Whoa! Tower clear you for that takeoff? [energetic rock music] So, do you know Minneapolis? Nah, I've only been here- Watch it! [horns honk] ...a couple of times. Oh, I know a good place. Any place is fine. Something wrong? Just watch it, Jesus! [car horn honking] You really drive this thing. Are we almost there? Another two minutes at this velocity. How long have you had this car? Oh, uh, forever. You must be the luckiest woman in the world. [horns honk] [tires screech] [Man]: Hey, what are you doing? Idiot! You alright? I feel like I should kiss the ground. [sirens] [relaxing music] [soft conversation] Wow, can't get that anymore. I'll have another one. Forget the water. Can't get it anymore? It's old, but it's not that old. Oh, I mean I can't usually afford- Are you ready to order now? Bill, would you order for me? I can never decide. Okay, the sole, and tossed salad, and Italian dressing. That's the first time I've ordered for a girl since... after the senior prom in high school. Did I act improperly? No. No, it's just... haven't you ever heard of Women's Lib? The suffragette movement, 19th Amendment, Rosie the Riveter, bra burning, Gloria Steinem, ERA, the battle of the sexes. Who won? I think it's still being fought. We might call a truce for tonight. I'd like that. Who won? You have a strange sense of humor. Sometimes it's like you grew up in a foreign country. I motel in Hermosa. They recognised the photo, but said he left two days ago. So we're sweeping the room for DNA and fingerprints. We're pretty sure he was on the phone with her when she was killed. He heard his wife being killed. Which means he's not our assailant. - And yet now, he's gone. - Someone's trying to set him up. Which means they obviously knew about the relationship. Her murder can still be linked to the fatwa or legal cases. People that worked with them and know they were a couple. - It's hard to keep that secret. - Who's motivated to frame him? Her family, to restore honour. Or somebody she was prosecuting. Both could have accomplices in Southern California. So we're back to hundreds of suspects again. Well, no. Because I took the 112 names we came up with yesterday and applied social image typology to generate a more targeted list. A list of possible murderers. Now we pose the question, who's most likely to commit fraud? Fundamentalists believe God is behind them. They're not gonna shift blame. We can eliminate them. - This wasn't a religious killing. - Can you be sure about that? The most likely group are career criminals. Because she was killed here and not in Iraq, this is an opportunity for someone here. She was prosecuting war criminals hiding outside Iraq. And, you know, that's been bothering me all along. Why would anyone go through all the trouble to set up an international murder when you don't have to? Some of these names are in her legal cases. The ex-Baathists, Saddam's men. Professional criminals with something personal to gain from her death. There's 18 names on this list. That's still a lot. So we're gonna leave Karnes to the Army. Saida. Wait. We know that Karnes is innocent. He's been gone since the murder. I'm gonna posit that he's probably out to avenge the murder of his wife. If I'm Karnes and I'm trying to attract the killer but avoid the Army, I'm gonna need cover, a place to work out of... A sympathetic ally. - Daniel Ratchet? - Who's asking? I'm Special Agent Granger. This is Agent Johnson. FBI. You and Joe Karnes, you enlisted together and served in Iraq? Yeah. So? Have you heard from him in the last few days? - No. - Look, man, I just want to talk to the guy. I don't care that he's AWOL. What do you want, man? I haven't seen him. Look, I served in Afghanistan, CID, the same as Joe. - I just want to help him. - Sure, you do. We know that Joe is innocent. We're trying to find Saida's killer. We want the same thing Joe does, but I need to talk to him before he does something crazy. If Joe kills somebody, I can't help him. Now, that bag, is that really yours, all the way up there? - How do you know he's innocent? - Mind if I come in? Go around the back. The back. Joe, run! Karnes, hang on. I just want to talk to you, man. Out of the way. Out of the way. FBI. Look, I just want to talk to you, man. Okay? Who are you, man? We need to talk. Just calm down, man. I just want to talk. They killed my wife. Who did? Her family? Was it them? An honour killing, because she married a non-Muslim? An honour killing, maybe. Not because of me. They never knew we were married. So, what do you mean, then? Saddam's son had his men go to schools to pick up girls for sex. They raped hundreds of girls. Everybody knew about it. They were just too terrified to speak up. - Except Saida. - She was one of the girls? She was gonna testify against the man who raped her for the war tribunal. That's why we came here, so she could give a deposition. - He slit her throat because of it. - Just tell us who he is. She was my wife. I will handle this. We're not gonna let you just go out and murder someone. I have to do this. You know I do. You are making stupid decisions right now because you're emotional. Look, I'm just gonna lay out your best option for you. You work with our team, we find this ass and put him in jail. We'll do everything we can to help straighten out things between you and the Army and get you back to your life. - I don't have a life. - Think about this for a minute. You are AWOL, which means you're going to jail. While you're sitting there, the guy who did this to Saida, he's gonna be getting away. Ask yourself what she would want you to do. Can you square it with the Army so I can go to her funeral? Yeah, I'll try. But I need to know who she was testifying against. A Republican Guard named Qari Qassim who worked for Saddam's son. He raped her when she was 15. Now Qari is in Iraq, but his cousin, Sami Qassim, he is here. It was Sami who did this. Sami Qassim, who was on Charlie's list. Baathist war criminal, Republican Guard, missing since 2003. We haven't been able to locate him. Well, we have hair and DNA samples from the crime scene. If we can find him, we can match it. But this guy was able to hide himself in his own community. There's a good chance no one really knows who he is. Or they do and they support him anyway. Is it worth reaching out to this imam again? There's no way he's gonna turn in Qassim. Unless we can prove Qassim isn't a sincere Muslim. How are we gonna do that? Nasreen says she and her cousin were like sisters when they were kids. My guess is, if she were raped, Nasreen would know, right? And she could tell Saida's story to the imam. What happened to Saida disgraced her family. No one cares about what happened to her. The imam may even hold her responsible. - Yeah, how do you know that? - I grew up in this culture. The imam will never deliver this man to you. Not on the word of a woman. But I think I can. I think I can make him come out of hiding. What do you mean? What if we had a memorial service for Saida and let it be known that I'm going to name Qassim in public? You know, shame him. - No, I don't know about that. - He is evil. I am tired of being afraid. My entire life, I have been afraid of men like him. How do you know you can even get the word out to him? The imam. They will send an e-mail to the community, letting them know about the service and saying that I am going to speak out, name names. The imam will want Qassim to know that I am accusing him. - So, what time's your flight? - Four o'clock. - Four o'clock. - Yeah, and I should run. But I wanted to see you before I left. You know, I have a standing invitation to lecture at Cambridge, so, you know, I'm thinking of taking them up on that offer and then we can really see each other as often as we'd like. Charlie. You know I adore you. I just... This has been lovely. I see. Okay. Oh, I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - You're not married, are you? - No. - Not engaged? - No, not really. - Not really? - Yeah. Well, we started seeing each other a few months ago. He has children, whom I like, amazingly. I probably shouldn't have... with you. It just... You know, it felt right. - I have no regrets. - No? - No. - No, nor do I. I just hope I didn't mislead you, you know. I do adore you. I... Let's get you to the airport. Sami Qassim. He was a leader in the Republican Guard under Saddam. This guy's brutal and he's got nothing to lose. So we want to stop him before he even makes it into the mosque. Remember, our first priority is to protect Nasreen Kafaji. No matter what goes down, you stay with her. Qassim could have accomplices we don't know. - All right, let's do this. - All right, guys, let's go. Let's hurry it up. Colby, we're about two minutes out. - How are you doing? - There's no sign of him yet, Don. We got guys in the surrounding buildings, on the ground, and two agents by the entrance to the mosque - to escort her in when she arrives. - Right. And we swept the mosque for bombs. It's clean inside. Right. Copy that. See you in a minute. Heads up. So when we pull up, two of my guys are gonna escort you inside. Let them guide you. Don't go off in the crowd, - even if you see someone you know. - Okay. I'm scared. You'll be fine. We got agents all over the place. You with me? All right, here we go. Here we go. Everyone in position. It's a go. Keep those people back. They're too close. Keep them back. Shots fired. Target hit. - Let's go. - FBI. Everybody get down. - Get down. - Get down. Get down on the ground. What about inside the mosque, can we go for it? Get them out. Get back. Get back. Sierra Team leader, do we have eyesight on the shooter? Colby, on the outside. In the grass. Get down. Get down. What's the status? He's dead. - You okay? - Did we get him? Yeah, we got him. Are you all right? You sure? She's gonna be sore, but she's gonna be okay. - I'm so sorry. - No. No apologies. You saved my life. The man who raped Saida, he's still there. He's still going on with his life and doing God knows what to who. I'm going back to Iraq. - That's pretty brave. - I won't be alone. Saida will be there with me. - What happened? - Oh, I don't know. What do you mean? You're sitting right here. - Dad, those look good. - Oh, well, next time you're the cook. That's not a good idea. You know that. What are you moping around here? What's going on? Leave me alone. I'm watching the game. All of a sudden, you're interested? - Hey, Don, what's happening? - Hey, Chuck. Where's Susan? She flew back to England. If I were you, I'd make up some excuse to see her. Because that girl was worth pursuing. You know what, I don't want her to get the wrong idea. What do you mean? What's the wrong idea? I'm really not that serious about her. I'm sorry. What the hell does it take for you to be interested? Amita is beautiful. This girl's a stunner. What do you need? - I think he wants to be cutest in bed. - Shut up. You got a neuroscientist with a body like that... Who's winning? I don't know. Apparently, not us. Speak for yourself. I've got a date tomorrow night. - Oh, yeah? With who? - With whom. - All right, with whom? - I'm not saying. - The caterer. - I'm not saying. Don't want to jinx it. You have the worse luck with the opposite sex. - I'm not gonna jinx it. - I resent that. I don't have bad luck. You have been on a pretty bad losing streak. What do you mean, Charlie? Look at you. I got them coming out of the woodwork. I want to know, when do I get grandchildren? I mean, you try doing my job and having a relationship. You try. Woe is Don. "Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims." And yet both my ex-wives live on. Ahem. Morning. - Morning. - Uh-oh. Tsk. Not again. Please, not again. Ugh. Thank God. Always in the last place you look, huh? Uh-huh. Have a nice day. You too. Phil, it's Charlie. Put me down for a grand on Detroit tonight. What's the line now? Well, excuse me. Don't you think if the gambler is awake, it behooves the bookie to be up as well? All right, well, call me when you get off the can. Are you aware that your sleepover buddy was packing heat? Oh, yeah. Any hotter and she'd have burned my pubes clean off. Charlie, a gun in the house? Relax, she's a cop. Or was a cop. Or is wanted by the cops. I know she mentioned cops. Unbelievable. So this was another one-night stand? Unless she comes back for her handcuffs, yeah. Boy, how much satisfaction can you get from that? Handcuffs? Not really my thing. But she probably did some stuff that might not have been her first choice. No, I mean, how can you possibly get any satisfaction from an endless series of one-night stands? As the words come out, I realize it's a stupid question. Forget I said it. She's married to a cop. I hate to see you wasting your life having drunken sex with women you don't care about. Well, who asked you to move back in and watch? - You know who was good for you? - Don't go there, Alan. Mia. She was beautiful, she was smart, she got you to clean up your act. I'm telling you, letting her go was the stupidest thing you've ever done. You're going there, Alan. Just saying, you had this fantastic woman who was willing to marry you... You wanna know why I gave up Mia? I'll tell you why I gave up Mia. - I gave her up for you. - Oh, for me? Yeah, yeah, for you. She wanted you to move out so we'd have the house to ourselves, but I said, "No way. I am not throwing my brother out on the street." Wow. - What a loving gesture. - Oh, bite me. And you know what you did? You married Kandi and moved out anyway. You wanna know why I let the best thing that ever happened to me get away? So the worst thing that could ever happen to me would have a place to live. Oh. "Oh." Well, I guess it all worked out for the best, huh? - How do you figure? - Well, think about it. If Mia had been living here when Kandi kicked me out and I came back, heh it would've been a very awkward situation. Oh! Aah! - Charlie? - Huh? Oh, yeah. Awkward. Phil, Phil, Phil, you're my bookie, not my psychiatrist. If I wanna bet every game in the country with money I don't have that's my business. Thank you. Now let's talk boxing. Really? There's no fights anywhere tonight? Okay, well, how are you and your wife getting along? What? It would be a fair fight. She's got like 50 pounds on you. Hello? My luck. I gotta have a bookie who's afraid to fight out of his weight class. Aren't you worried that this betting might be turning into a problem? Alan, if you don't bet big, you can't cover your losses. And if you can't cover your losses a large man with a tire iron puts your address into MapQuest. You have to sneak across the Mexican border dressed in women's clothing. - Now, that's when you have a problem. - Well, you know best. You hungry? I- I made your favorite sandwich. Turkey, ham and pastrami. Heh, gooble. No, thanks. Okay, how about something sweet? Key-lime pie. Yummy, yummy. Look, Alan, I appreciate your sucking up but you can't fill the gaping wound in my heart with deli meat. And pie. Yummy. Can't we just leave it alone? Can we not grind on and on about the stupidest thing I've ever done? Okay, okay, I'm sorry I said that. Giving up Mia was not the stupidest thing you've ever done. It wasn't as stupid as when you came back from Rio with that model. You know, the one with the Adam's apple and the really big hands. You know, I'm gonna give you some space. Maybe go for a nice drive. Forgot my keys. Ahh... Oh. Huh. You know, they must have slipped out of my pocket and into the couch. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Found some change. Ha-ha. Oh, look, look. Is that a quarter in your ear? Ta-da. Very impressive. Aaah! Yeah! Bab-em-stab-em-bab-em-bay-uh-dye - What is that? - Steven Tyler rented the house next door. The - The guy from Aerosmith? I lost my virginity to him. Well, you know, his music. Thanks, I was confused. He's apparently getting ready for a tour. So, what's-? in the box? I went out and picked you up something I thought might put a smile on your face. Alan, the only thing in this box that could possibly put a smile on my face is your severed head. Good one. Zing! Go on, open it. - A hat? - A very expensive hat. Since when do I wear hats? Well, you don't, but I saw it and it seemed so you. You know, cool, rakish, yet forgiving. - Okay, fine, I forgive you. - Oh, thanks. Thanks. - Aren't you gonna try it on? - No. If you really forgave me, you'd try it on. Oh, yeah. That is you. Let's - Let's try tilting it a little bit here. Oh, baby. Ha-ha. You gotta see this. Come on inside. We'll take a look. Charlie, you coming? - What's going on? - You should leave, Alan. - Why? - Just trust me. All right. Hey, Tyler, take a pause for the cause. Oh, sorry, man. Thank you and good night. - Hi, Charlie. - Rose. How cool is it that Steven Tyler moved in next door? I lost my virginity to him. - You mean his music. - No. - Nice hat. - Thanks. Boy, you look like hell. Well, that's strange, because I feel like crap. How long do you think you can keep it up? What exactly are we talking about? The excessive drinking, the obsessive partying the compulsive gambling. Oh. Hard to say. I try and take it one day at a time. You do realize this is all just an attempt to avoid feeling your feelings. Let me tell you something about feelings. Feelings are like your mother's breasts. You know where they are, but they're best left unfelt. Interesting analogy. May I point out that a mother's breasts are a source of nourishment and comfort? Yeah, well, my mother's breasts were a source of silicone and Russian vodka. Not good for child-rearing, but she was a big hit at parties. Charlie, I know how much it hurt you to give up Mia. And I know you don't like that feeling, but the more you try to get rid of it the more it's going to come back. Oh, yeah. Perfect fit, like somebody measured your head while you were asleep so when your brother called, she could tell him the size. Hey, Uncle Charlie, guess where I'm finally growing hair. Come on, man, I'm eating. Right here. I'm growing a 'stache. Oh, yeah, look at that. Hey, cool hat. Whose is it? Yours. - Really? - Yeah. It looks great with the 'stache. It just occurred to me that I've been feeling guilty because you called off your wedding so I wouldn't move out. But then when I did move out, you didn't call her. Yeah? So? So you know why I think you didn't call her? You didn't call because the "I don't wanna throw my brother out" business was a convenient excuse to get out of the marriage. - That's what you think? - Yes, that's what I think. - That's what you think? - You heard me. - That's what I think. - Yeah, well, think again. Admit it, I've been beating myself up, buying you pie and hats, for nothing. There's pie? There was. Berta ate it. And why is he wearing your hat? - I gave it to him. - I bought this hat for you. - And I gave it to Jake. - You can't commit to anything, can you? - It's just a hat. - It's not just a hat, it's a symbol. - Of what? - Of... Okay, it's just a hat. But the point is you have nobody to blame for your miserable existence but yourself. Drink, gamble and hump all you want. One day you're gonna have to face that fact. Drink, gamble and hump. Yeah, well, I don't have to face anything I don't wanna face. And I don't have to feel anything I don't wanna feel. That includes Mom's vodka knockers. Who is this Vod Kanockers that you speak of? Eat your dinner. The name's Kanockers, Vod Kanockers. - Charlie? - Shh. - You okay? - Just dandy. Would you close the blinds? Come on. Let's get you inside. - It looks like you had a tough night. - No, the night was great. It's the morning that's killing me. - Hey, Alan? - What? You were right. I can't keep running away from my feelings. - Well, I'm glad you realize that. - You're a wonderful brother. And this is a beautiful hat. Thank you. - Charlie, are you okay? - I'm fine. The hat's not so good. Hey, Berta, wanna see my armpit hair? Only if you wanna see mine. - Hey. - Hey. - You know that's my juice. - I know. - You could at least ask. - You could at least pay rent. Touché. If that's a bookie or a woman, you know what to say. Harper residence. Sorry, he's dead. Interesting. No one ever calls back to find out where to send flowers. Touché. How's it feel to go a whole week without booze, broads or betting? It's actually kind of a relief. I never realized how much effort it took to avoid feeling anything. - Yeah? What are you feeling now? - So far, mostly nausea and boredom. Touché. - You don't know what that means? - Not a clue. Hey, if girls with big boobs work at Hooters where do girls with only one leg work at? IHOP. That's just cruel. Actually, it's kind of funny. Yeah, because they got one leg. They have to hop. Right, IHOP. Tipping your waitress takes on a whole new meaning. - It's not that funny. - I know. - Then why are you laughing so much? - I don't know. Dad, something's wrong with Uncle Charlie. What's going on? Hey, Jake, tell your dad how one-legged girls work at IHOP. Oh, no. I gave away the joke. I'm so sorry, Jake. I've ruined everything. Is he okay? He's fine. His feelings are coming to the surface. Oh, like when Mom gets PMS. Well, kind of. Hang on, Uncle Charlie, I'll get you some chocolate. - What's he making out there? - A lanyard. He's got a lot of free time now so I gave him one of Jake's old hobby kits. You know, so he'd have something to do. I'm surprised he's not making a vagina out of macaroni and bottle caps. Over, loop around around the block and then downtown. Over, over, loop around around the block and then- Yo, dude, some of us are trying to do crafts here. - What? - Can you lay off the harmonica playing? Hey, a lot of people pay to see me play harmonica. They pay to hear you sing. They tolerate the harmonica. Sorry I don't measure up to your musical standards you lame-ass jingle writer. Let's see how you play harmonica out your other end. No, no, no, let's slow down here. Come on. Let's see what you got, jingle balls. I'm gonna rip off your big lips and use them to kiss my ass. Charlie, please, you know your emotions are a little bit frayed now. Right, right, okay. Okay. I'm better. - That's it. - No, Charlie. Charlie, wait. Charlie, don't do this. Come on, Tyler. You want a piece of me? Well, the dude may look like a lady, but you fight like a little girl. Did it ever occur to you to help me out? Yeah, but once you were cowering under his picnic table I figured the worst was over. Though quick thinking, squirting that bottle of sun block at him. I was hoping it would get in his eyes and blind him. All you did was keep him from getting a burn while he beat the crap out of you. Please, Alan, I'm begging you. Okay. It's not right to kick a man when he's down. Thanks. Too bad Steven Tyler didn't feel that way, huh? Heh. You were right about Mia. I got cold feet, so I used you as an excuse to call off the wedding. I am so proud of you, Charlie. This is a real breakthrough. And doesn't it feel liberating to finally hear yourself admit the truth? Well, I feel something. But since I'm also hearing a high-pitched whistle it might just be a concussion. - What are you making? - A needlepoint sampler. - No kidding. - I find it very calming. And the message helps center me. - "God bless Vicodin"? - Mm-hm. - Pretty good, huh? - You spelled "Vicodin" wrong. That's the great thing about Vicodin. I don't care. Hey, is Charlie here? Uh... Who may I say is calling? It's okay, Alan. - Hey, Chazz, thanks for the gift. - You're welcome. - So no hard feelings? - No. You? Why would I have hard feelings? I'm still picking pieces of your ass out of my boot. Good one. - Okay, well, good luck with the tour. - Thanks a lot, man. Who's the sponsor? Metamucil? - What was that? - Nothing, nothing. I just wanna say I'm a huge fan. - I lost my virginity to you. Heh-heh. - Really? Well, you know, there's a lot of the '70s I don't remember. - Isn't that the hat I got you? - Yeah. The hat you threw up in? I had it cleaned. But I'll always know. Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims, and yet both my ex-wives live on... Morning. Morning. Not again, please not again... Oh, thank God. Always in the last place you look, uh? Have a nice day! You too. Yeah Phil, it's Charlie. Put me down for a grand on Detroit tonight. What's the lineup? Well, excuse me... But don't you think if the gambler is awake it'd be who is the bookie to be up as well? Alright, well call me when you get off the can. Are you aware that your sleep-over buddy was packing heat? Oh yeah... Any hotter and she'd have burnt my pubes clean off! Charlie, a gun in a house... Relax, she's a cop. Or was a cop... Or is wanted by the cops. I know she mentioned cops. Unbelievable, so this was another one-night stand? Unless she comes back for her handcuffs, yeah. Boy, how much satisfaction can you get from that? Handcuffs? Never really my thing. But hey, she probably did some stuff last night that might not have been her first choice... No, I mean how can you possibly get any satisfaction from an endless series of alcohol-soaked one night stands, and even as the words are coming out of my mouth I realize this is a stupid question so forget I said it. She's married to a cop! I hate to see you wasting your life, having drunken sex with women you don't care about. Who asked you to move back in and watch? - You know who's good for you? - Don't go there Alan. Mia. She was beautiful, she was smart, she got you to clean up your act. I'm telling you Charlie, letting her go was the stupidest thing you've ever done. You're going there Alan... I'm just saying you had this fantastic woman who was willing to marry you, and then you just threw it away, and for what? OK, you're there! You want to know why I gave up Mia? I'll tell you why I gave up Mia, - I gave her up for you. - Oh oh, for me? Yeah, yeah, for you! She wanted you to move out so we would have the house to ourselves, but I said "nooo way, I am not throwing my brother out on the street". - What a loving gesture. - Oh bite me! And you know what you did? You married Kandi and moved out anyway. So if you want to know why I let the best thing that ever happened to me get away, it's so the worst thing that could ever happen to me would have a place to live. I guessed it all worked out for the best, huh? How do you figure? Think about it: if Mia had been living here when Kandi kicked me out and I came back, it would have been a very awkward situation. Charlie? Oh... yeah, awkward.. Episode 4x02 "Who's Vod Kanockers?" Transcript/Synchro: Porkepick Corrections: Bouliii Phil... Phil, you're my bookie, not my psychiatrist. If I want to bet every single game in the country with money I don't have, that's my business. Thank you, now... let's talk boxing. Really? There's no fights anywhere tonight? OK, well... how are you and your wife getting along? What, it'd be a fair fight, she's got like 50 pounds on you! Hello... My luck, I gotta have a bookie who is afraid to fight out of his weight class. Aren't you a little worried that all this betting might be turning into a problem? Alan, if you don't bet big you can't cover your losses. And if you can't cover your losses, a large man with a tire iron puts your address in the map-quest, at which point you have to sneak across the Mexican border dressed in woman's clothing. Now that's when you have a problem. You know best. You're hungry? I made your favorite sandwich. Turkey, ham and pastrami. Gobble, oink, mooooo. No, thanks. OK, how about something sweet? Key lime pie, yummy yummy! Look, Alan, I appreciate your sucking up. But you can't fill the gaping wound in my heart with... Deli meat. And pie. Yummy. Can we just leave it alone? Can we not grind on and on about the stupidest thing I've ever done? OK, I'm sorry I said that, giving up Mia was not the stupidest thing you've ever done. It certainly wasn't as stupid as when you came back from Rio with that gorgeous model, you know, the one with the Adam's apple and the really big hands? You know, I'm gonna give you some space. Maybe go for a nice drive... Forgot my keys... You know what, they must have slipped out of my pocket, and... into the couch. Excuse me. Sorry... Found some change! Look... Is that a quarter in your ear? Very impressive... What is that? Steven Tyler rented the house next door. The guy from Aerosmith? I lost my virginity to him. You know, his music. Thanks, I was confused... He's apparently getting ready for a tour. So what's... in the box? I went out and picked you up a little something I thought might put a smile on your face. Alan, the only thing in this box that could possibly put a smiling on my face, is your severed head. Good one. Zing! Come on, open it! - A hat! ? - A very expensive hat. Since when do I wear hats? Well, you don't but I saw it and it seemed so... you. You know, cool, rakish... yet forgiving. - OK fine, I forgive you. - Thanks! Thanks... Aren't you gonna try it on? No. If you really forgave me, you'd try it on. Oh yeah! That is you. Let's try tilting it a little bit here. Oh baby! You gotta see this, come on inside, we'll take a look. Charlie, you're coming? What's going on? You should leave, Alan. Why? Just trust me. Alright. Hey Tyler, take a pause for the cause! Oh sorry man... Thank you and goodnight! Hi Charlie. Rose. How cool is it that Steven Tyler moved in next door? I lost my virginity to him. You mean his music? No. Nice hat. Thanks. Boy, you look like hell. That's strange. 'Cause I feel like crap. How long do you think you can keep it up? What exactly are we talking about? The excessive drinking, the obsessive partying, the compulsive gambling. Hard to say. Trying to take it one day at a time. You do realize this is all just an attempt to avoid feeling your feelings? Let me tell you something about feelings. Feelings are like your mother's breasts. You know where they are, but they're best left unfelt. It's an interesting analogy but may I point out that the mother's breasts are a source of nourishment and comfort. Yeah, well my mother's breasts were a source of silicone and Russian vodka. Not good for child wearing, but she was a big hit at parties. Charlie, I know how much it hurt you to give up Mia, and I know you don't like that feeling, but the more you try to get rid of it, the more it's going to come back. Oh yeah... Perfect fit. It's like somebody measured your head while you were asleep, so when your brother called, she could tell him the size. Hey Uncle Charlie, guess where I'm finally growing hair? Come on man, I'm eating. Right here, I'm growing a 'stache. Oh yeah, look at that... Hey, cool hat! Whose is it? Yours. - Really? - Yeah. It looks great with the 'stache. You know, it just occurred to me that I've been feeling guilty because you called off your wedding to Mia so I wouldn't have to move out. But then, when I did move out, you didn't call her! Yeah, so? So, you know why I think you didn't call her? You didn't call her because the whole "I don't want to throw my brother out on the street" business, is was a very convenient and noble excuse to get out of the marriage. That's what you think, huh? - Yes, that's what I think. - That's what you think? You heard me, that's what I think! Yeah, well... think again. Admit it Charlie, I've been beating myself up buying you pie and hats for nothing. There's pie? There was, Berta ate it. And why is he wearing your hat? I gave it to him. I bought this hat for you. And I gave it to Jake. You can't commit to anything, can you? - It's just a hat! - It's not just a hat, it's a symbol! - Of what? ! - Of... OK, it's just a hat. But... the point is, you have nobody to blame for your miserable lonely existence but yourself! And you can drink, gamble and hump all you want, but one day, you're gonna have to face that fact. Drink, gamble and hump! Yeah well, I don't have to face anything I don't want to face, and I don't have to feel anything I don't want to feel, and that includes Mom's vodka knockers. Who is this Vod Kanockers that you speak of? Eat your dinner. The name's Kanockers. Vod Kanockers. Charlie? Are you OK? Just dandy... Could you close the blinds? Come on, let's get you inside... Looks like you had a tough night! No, the night was great. It's the morning that's killing me. Hey Alan... What? You were right. I can't keep running away from my feelings... I'm glad you realized that. You're a wonderful brother, and this is a beautiful hat. Thank you. Charlie, you're OK? I'm fine. The hat's not so good. Hey, Berta, want to see my armpit hair? Only if you want to see mine... - Hey. - Hey. You know that's my juice... I know. You could at least ask... You could at least pay a rent. Touch�... If that's a bookie or a woman you know what to say. Harper residence. Sorry, he's dead. Interesting. No one ever calls back to find out where to send flowers. Touch�... How does it feel to go a whole week without booze, broads or betting? It's actually kind of a relief... I never realized how much effort it took to avoid feeling anything. Yeah? What are you feeling now? So far, mostly nausea and boredom. Touch�... You don't know what that means, do you? Not a clue. Hey, if girls with big boobs work at Hooters, where do girls with only one leg work at? IHOP! That's just cruel. Actually, it's kinda funny. Yeah! 'Cause they got one leg, they have to hop! I hop! Tipping your waitress takes on a whole new meaning. It's not that funny. I know. Why are you laughing so much? I don't know! Dad! ? Something's wrong with Uncle Charlie! What's going on? Hey Jake, tell your Dad, how one legged girls work at IHOP. Oh no. I gave away the joke. I'm so sorry Jake. I've ruined everything... Is he OK? He's fine, his feelings are coming at the surface. Oh, like when Mom gets PMS. Well, kinda... Hang on, Uncle Charlie, I'll get you some chocolate. What's he making out there? A lanyard... He's got a lot of free time now, so I gave him one of Jake's old hobby-kits. You know, so he'd have something to do... I'm surprised he's not making a vagina out of macaroni and bottle caps.

Hey, a lot of people pay to see me play harmonica. They pay to hear you sing, they tolerate the harmonica! Sorry I don't measure up to your musical standards, you... lame-ass jingle writer! Alright, let's see how you play harmonica your other end! No no no no, slow down here! Come on... Let's see what you got, jingle balls! OK, I'm gonna rip off your big fat lips, and use them to kiss my ass! Charlie! Please, please... You know your emotions are a little bit frayed right now... Right! Right, OK... OK. I'm better. That's it! No, Charlie, Charlie! Wait! Charlie, don't do this! Come on Tyler, you want a piece of me? ! Well the dude may look like a lady, but you fight like a little girl. Did it ever occur to you to help me out? Yeah, but once you were cowering under his picnic table I figured the worst was over. Oh, good thinking squirting that bottle of sunblock at him. I was hoping it would get in his eyes and blind him. Yeah well, all you did was keep him from getting a nasty burn while he beat the crap out of you. Please Alan, I'm begging you... OK. It's not right to kick a man when he's down. Thanks. Too bad Steven Tyler didn't feel that way, huh? You were right about Mia, I got cold feet, so I used you as an excuse to call off the wedding. I am so proud of you Charlie, this is a real breakthrough. Doesn't it feel liberating to finally hear yourself admit the truth? Well I feel something... But since I'm also hearing a high pitch whistle, it might just be a concussion. What are you making? A needlepoint sampler. No kidding? I find it very calming. And the message helps centering. God bless Vicoden? Pretty good, huh? You spelled Vicodin wrong. That's the great thing about Vicodin, I don't care. Hey, is Charlie here? Huh... Who may I say is calling? It's OK, Alan. - Hey Chazz, thanks for the gift. - You're welcome. So no hard feelings? Nah... You? Why would I have hard feelings, I'm still picking pieces of your ass out of my boot. Good one! OK well, good luck with the Tour. Thanks a lot man. Who is the sponsor? Metamucil? What was that? Nothing, nothing... I just want to say, I'm a huge fan. I lost my virginity to you. Really ? Well, you know, there's... a lot of the seventies I don't remember. Isn't that the hat I got you? Yeah. The hat you threw up in? I had it cleaned, but... I'll always know... My name is Shake-Zula The Mike Ruler The Old Schooler You want to trip? I'll bring it to ya. Frylock and I'm on top rock you like a cop Meatwad, you're up next with your knock-knock.

I love all people. Hey, you know what a walrus and Tupperware have in common? They're both looking for a tight seal. No takers over at that table, right, ladies? Ha ha ha. But seriously, I'd like to bring it down a notch. ? I see your face your rosy, rosy cheeks ? ? And I mean your buns those squishy, mushy buns... ? I wasn't always a superstar. I used to be a boring old cup. Why would anyone make a show about something you'd throw away? But things changed, my friend. Money rolled in like waves lapping on the shore. And if you've got talent, well, they'll find you. But, listen. Let me speak to a supervisor. Because you were very rude to me! I will fly directly to India tonight, and I will see your face in my face! The TV ain't working. What? Hey! What's your name? What is your name? ! Give me your name! Hey, who you talking to? I am about to find out. Yes, can-- [dial tone] Hung up. Let's see if he fixed it. Did he fix the TV? You tell me. Well... Yeah. Let me tell you about these people. And they grow these shows in India and they're my favorite shows--and they know that. And since I've produced them, they won't give them to me for free. Hey... Let's watch the TV, see if you starring in another of them movies. [clicking] I swear to God! A whole night of TV has been ruined. Thank you, India! Hey, you remember that one show? Roid-away, apply directly to the roid. Roid-away, apply directly to the roid. Apply directly to the roid. That's a good show. Yeah. That was good. Well, you don't think it got nothing to do with that thing out there, do you? Well... No. It's the Indians and their barbaric ways-- yogurt runs down their faces and boobs flapping around! Hey, you ever hear of a bra? ! I've seen one. Hey, man. What the hell is this tower doing here? Oh, that? It's pretty sweet, eh? This dude's giving me 40 bucks a month to put it here, and I ain't gotta do jack! Except rake in the jack! Ha ha! You know what I mean? Yeah, Carl. 40 large! What's it do? Well, it'll mess with your telephone and your television, too. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely does that. But mine comes in great. I mean, you gotta check this out, dude. I got great picture here. You ever seen this show? No. I don't think so. It's insane. Nothing happens. But I'm addicted to it. Is this a show? Yeah, no one gets it but me, you know. It's exclusive to Carl! Huh. Ok, so... What's it about? Well, you know, it's pretty boring, really. 'Cause whenever I look up, they start pretending to stack stuff. But, hey, I got all day to do this--now that I got an outside source of income! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 40 big 'uns! Damn, man. Do your eyes hurt? Last couple days, they have bothered me. They feel like they're growing or something. But, hey... If you pop some Aspirin, I'm good to go. Oh, gross. Nah, don't worry about that. Ugh! Just tilt your head back. Just tilt your head back! That's right! Oh! That's what those guys told me to do-- and it worked. How's it look? Keep going. Further. It's getting--oh--it's getting clearer. A little more. A little more. Ok. Clear. It's getting definitely-- it's getting clearer now. Getting better? Roger. Keep going. Further. Getting clearer. Perfect! Ok, stay right where you are! Do not move! Whoa! Sweet! Great. Now it's snowy again. [door opens] Ugh! What's wrong with him? You need to watch what you're doing to him. Ow! Frylock, you know me. My love for him is beyond any... Rivers. Look, we gotta do something about that tower. I'll show you what a man does with it. [buzzing] Shake, no! Ok, look. Just let me climb it and see what the deal is. Just do me one favor and don't destroy it until I get down, ok? Ok. Oh, my freakin' head. You need to tilt your head back, Carl! You must keep your blood... oh! Further! Further! it's really hurting. Further, further! Yeah, see, I--if I do it any more-- Tilt your head back further. I think the blood's coming out of my eyes. Put spoons over them. Aagh. Carl? ! What? Someone climbs the tower. You know what you must do, Beast Man. Yes, master. Hey! Get off of the tower! No! Uh. He won't come down. Then we shall tell him-- in our own little way! [laughing] Send voice-over artist George Lowe. Yeah! George Lowe will force him from the tower! What's up, Fry-Lam. Who are you? Captain Beefy, Georm Loam. Hail Geebonla Forever. So, what do you-- God bless you and all you do for television, Frylock. You know, our children are learning from you. So you-- you look tasty and heavily salted. Ok, ok, ok, look-- my ex-girlfriend-- man, look! Can I stop you for a second, ok? Another joke for another time. So, why are you here? The home office in Grand Rapid sent me down to get you off the tower. Uh... It's affecting the morning show--you being here. The morning guys can't do their thing--the nutty bunch-- Larry and Eric. So, wait-- can you get me a regular gig? What? Ha ha ha. It's a joke, for God's sake. Ok, let's start this again. Ok? Who are you? George Lowe. I've been hired by aliens to tell you to get off the tower. I am the voice master. George, I'm not getting off the tower. That's fine, Aunt Crabby. I still get paid. You just stay right where you are. Seriously! I got 40 large to do this gig. Wow. $40, huh? It's all in their currency, but they say the Yorlok is very strong in the states right now. And mom agreed. So, here we all are. She's like, "you're getting how many Yorloks for this?" I said, "oh, don't you worry, baby. Enough to crank the generator back up another week or two." George-- the Yorlok. Isn't that that new bag that seals in freshness, the Yorlok? George, please. Hold on a second. I want to try and give you some Mason Adams here. Yorlok... George? It keeps your food fresher longer. Earth to George. A product of Ching Dowdy Doodoo Industries. George? ! Why you? I was available. They couldn't afford Lafontaine. Yeah, Mr. $30,000 a minute. No way! Mr. Big Shot. In a world... You smell that? ...Where towers rule the universe. Is that smoke? You're telling me that ain't the same? ! Seriously. That's the same. George! I smell some folk art burning. Folk art? ! Where? !

Oh, hey, better yet, go to the William Morris web site-- New York demos voice talent under Radio Imagining it's at the New York site though, not the Beverly Hills one! [thud] It didn't work! You need to tilt your head back, Carl. I can't tilt it back any further, dude. The waves are very dangerous. But we pay you handsomely. I know, and I appreciate that. But, uh... I mean, look at that blood in here, man, I gotta run a wet-vac through here or something. No, you will stay, and you will watch us stack. Ok. What about the tower though? Oh, let him come. And we will crush him with out mighty fists of rage. [laughing] What are you two doing? Aagh! Don't touch us! Leave us alone! Aagh! Carl, wake up! No, I'm awake. I'm up, I'm up. What? ! This isn't a cell tower at all. This tower goes all the way up to their planet. They were gonna climb down it and attack us. [metal clanging] Whoa! What the hell was that? ! [whirring] [grunting] $20 for an autograph? You are out of your mind. Daddy gets 25 for a sketch. From who? Shoot, boy. For that much, it ought to come with a hand-job or something. Oh, it does. Will you please keep it down while I'm trying to saw? ! [cell phone rings] Hello? Shake, don't cut down that antenna. Give me one good reason-- besides the fact that you asked me nicely before you went up there. You know, shake, they-- they get every TV show up here. I mean, even Pay-Per-View. Stay there. I'm coming up. [grunting] All right. Where's the TV? You are the TV. Well, where are the shows? You are the show! Let the entertainment happen! Begin! Wait! Where's-- where's--where's Frylock? ! Shake, it's a trick! They used me to get to you. They want to you to entertain them forever. Yeah, I told them it was a pretty good idea. So, I helped them. Well, where the hell you going? Oh... I was acting. You know, like on TV. That was pretty good acting. Here are your 40 Yorloks. Use them wisely. On George Lowe's autograph. You can get two for that. Or a sketch and a hand-job! [lounge music playing] All right, hey! Well, we've been having some fun. And don't go away 'cause we'll be Right back with the Master Shake Show on every channel. George? We're global, worldwide, every channel. George? All the friggin' channels, all the friggin' time. George? Same little cup yapping away. George? ! Please! Well, I can do that. It's what I do. And they got this weasel knocking down 6 figures every Monday. He's taken over The Internet, you know? I had a 6-figure deal with The Internet. Now it's gone. They're holding him hostage, George. It's different, ok? It's not different when he's a star. I mean, they took my picture down at the barbecue joint, Frylock, and they put his up. Hey, Frylock, what's a hand-job? 'Cause I'm about to get one! - Hey, man. - Hey. You okay? Lina and I had our first date a month ago today, and I want to get her something to celebrate. I want to get her a trumpet. Really? I usually get'em flowers or drunk. But if you score with the trumpet, you let me know. On our first date, she told me she always wanted to play one, but they're so expensive. Hey, you know what's not? Drug store vodka. Ahh. I love a gift that makes a girl say, "Where am I? What happened?" Heads up. Oh, was I supposed to-- What's with the balls? Memorabilia convention. And I'm running late. So I need you guys to sign my name on 'em. Cool. I don't see anything unethical about that. Is that sarcasm? 'Cause I do not get sarcasm. Which is surprising, because you're so smart. I know! Where's the convention? Atlantic City. Oh, man, it's a sweet deal. I just spend an hour chatting up the fans, and then it's all the free drinks and free food I can shove down my cake hole. You're charming. I appreciate you saying so. They actually pay you to eat, drink, and get your ass kissed, wow. You want to come along? Are you messing with me? Messing with him about what? Oh, Dunc's coming to AC with me. I'm gonna shove free things down my cake hole. So it's a fancy trip. How about you, champ? You like Atlantic City? I've never been. What? You've never been to AC? Well, that's it. You're going. Red's coming. Um, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure, what's up? Thank God you're going. I need you to do me a huge favor. Yeah, anything. You gotta make sure Yonk doesn't gamble. Yeah, I'm not doing that. I'm begging you. He's got a huge problem. The last time he went to AC, $23,000. He won $23,000? Yeah, that's my problem. My husband is a compulsive winner. Please? Will you at least try? For me? Yeah. You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. Thank you. - How are those balls coming? - Great. Just knowing I'm helping you get richer makes the time fly by. That's the spirit. I could do that all day. Mommy, somebody's ready to show you her costume. Oprah! Ta-da! She's a...blind girl drinking juice. Hello! Audrey Hepburn. Breakfast at Tiffany's. Oh! I love it. Oh. I don't get it. You don't have to get it. You just have to sell it. Absolutely. I'm leaving right now. Guess what? Steve Martinez just went into rehab. Yes! I'm gonna cover his spot on the midday news today, and it's between me and Sandy Tanaka to take over as weekend anchor. Oh! Oh, my God. This is our moment. I know. Weekend anchor! Weekend anchor! Okay, all right, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Sandy Tanaka is gonna be tough to beat. Oh, yeah. With her Asian demographic and her big fake boobs. Oh, you've noticed them, have you? Oh, honey, relax. You know I'm an ass man. Okay, come on, you've gotta go change. I'm thinking the black Von Furstenberg with the new Jimmy Choo's. Oh, no, I can barely walk in those. They're so tall and spiky. Can I just wear these? Black suit, brown shoes? Sure you can. "Hello, Sandy Tanaka. "Get your big fake rack down here. You got the job." You're right, you're right. What would I do without you? Clash. That was so awesome. All those players I grew up watching. All those legends in the same room. You know, I couldn't help thinking, "They got so fat." You know, how I keep it off? I only eat meat. Well, that's not a heart attack waiting to happen. Well, let's hope you're right. Right, let's hit the tables. Oh, we're gambling, huh? Oh, I'm not. I promised Nic I wouldn't gamble. But it's Big Rick here's first time in AC. Thought he ought to have a little taste of the action. Oh, I don't need to taste the action. I assume it tastes like chicken. I'll tell you what I do. I'll spot you 100 bucks each, all right? Just as a thank you for signing my balls. How you doing, darling? Danny, I'm gonna do a walk and talk along the fence there. And make sure you're wide enough to see my shoes. Jack said he wanted you in there with the animals. Actually in there with them? Well, if that's what Jack wants. Hey, guys! Hello, little fella. Oh! Aren't you musty? All right, Dr. Doolittle. We've live in 3, 2... Halloween is one again upon us. And here at the Upper Darby Autumn Festival, there's a petting zoo your little goblins won't want to miss. Already the festival's attracted a record... number of... Oh! Oh! Get a hold of yourself, sweetie. Now say it again. You did what? I impaled a bunny with my shoe. Oh, my God. Okay, honey, I'm coming to get you. Where are you? Boys, please keep it down! My wife is very upset. She just killed a bunny. - A bunny? ! - His wife? ! It was so horrible. Oh, honey, I know. But it's gonna be okay. And it's a holiday. Maybe not that many people were watching. And Halloween got a little scarier today at a Philadelphia petting zoo. We should warn you. This footage may not be appropriate for children. Here at the Upper Darby Autumn Festival, there's a petting zoo your little goblins won't want to miss. Oh! Aah! Holy crap! I know. It's already online. There's a petting zoo your little goblins won't want to miss. Ugh! Guess who I am. Old-timey lesbian? Here's a hint. Uh, what am gonna do about World War II? Oh, no, I can't believe I've got Polio! Have you met my wife Eleanor? She's got a face like a boat. Whoosh! Greetings, citizens. So what does the S stand for? "Seriously"? I think you can pull it off, Superman. Thank you... wheelchair transvestite? So, Superman? Really? - What? - Oh, nothing. It's just kind of nice knowing I could kick Superman's ass. Excuse me? Ignore her. She's all hopped up on candy. Yeah, I ate so many Skittles I peed the rainbow. Wow, you're actually claiming that you could kick my ass? You guys, can we please go to this party? I'm really sweating in this suit. You don't think that I could? Uh, well, I'm bigger than you. I am stronger than you. I wrestled in high school. Oh, a wrestler, huh? Mm-hmm. Well, then it shouldn't be a problem if somebody were to- - Hatcha! What the hell was that? Sorry. What I mean to do was this! You are out of control. Face it. You can't beat me. I've got special powers. Oh, look out, Superman! Ow! Ow! Let me go! Let me go, let me go! All right, but first admit I am the Man of Steel. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Fine, I've got nothing but time. Okay, let go, come on. Not until you say I am Superman. Hmm? I'm hot. Place your bets. Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I keep the money... That's it. Come on, man, you gotta play. Besides, it's my 100 bucks. You know, you just keep the profits. Okay, okay. Hit me. And...not my money. It's to you, Rick. Want a card? I don't know. How do I do this? You gotta get a higher number than the dealer. But you can't go over 21. Okay, I have 14. What do you have? I can't tell you that, sir. Well, this is a nightmare. Ask for a card. Can I have another card, please? 21. 21 is 21, right? - Yeah, man, it's 21! - I won? Oh, my God! I won $10. You having fun now? Yeah--not with the ring. - Hi. - Hey. We were on our way to a you back. Casey, please. This is Sister Peg. He could be assaulting her right now. Do not make me the bad guy on this. I'm not the one who just violated someone's constitutional rights. This is Sister Peg. She testified for you on the Hector Ramirez case. And I would do anything to help her, but no judge in his right mind is gonna sign off on a search warrant without probable cause. Look, I was there when he met her. Fireworks went off when he found out that she was a nun. Liv, he was in your precinct the entire time. Which means that he has to be working with a partner. They killed Kaley. The same thing is gonna happen to Sister Peg. Oh, so you're psychic now too. What? I'll be right there. Patrol just picked up the Ballentines at an all night car wash, hosing out the back of their van. Is it okay with you if we bring him in for questioning? Now, you're gonna drop the ESP crap right now. Where is she? Well, make up your mind. Do you want me to use my gift or not? You know how dumb it was to go after someone I know personally? How could I have gone after her? I was here. Okay, smart guy. We know who your partner is. He talks, he gets the deal. I don't work with anyone. My business is very solitary, actually. I'm a one-man show. Carlene, you were helping him tamper with evidence. Well, how was our van evidence? You don't think it's a little strange to go to the car wash in the middle of the night? Oh, no. Henry J. threw up. Daddy can't stand that smell in the car. We're looking for a friend of his. Can you tell us who he's close to? Henry J. and me are everything to him. If he's not with us, he's working. Does he have a business partner? Me again. I mean, I don't have any special abilities like him. I just make the appointments, take care of the books. Whatever I can do to help. They being cooperative? No, and it's not looking good. Sebastian is too sharp to slip, and Carlene is almost too dim to exist. We found a witness. Ballentines were at the car wash at least a half an hour. - Destroying evidence. - We worked out a time line. Good news is they had to go straight there after they left the Precinct. Meaning, he hasn't seen Sister Peg yet. Let's hope his partner is waiting on him to get there. How many patient rapists do you know? None. Luckily, I know a judge with a drinking problem. - Come again? - I stopped by his favorite watering hole... and I assured him that my search warrant contained sufficient cause. And he signed it without reading it. Now this gets you into the van and the residence. Go. Hey, I fixed this, you fix the door. What door? You find anything? No sign of violence. Place is immaculate. A diary too much to ask for? This guy didn't leave a paper trail. I haven't even found an address book. I've got one. He keeps it electronically. We're looking for the guy he's working this with. This is mostly women. They all seem to cross-reference with his appointment book. Those are his marks, I need his partner. The names are all set up as URLs. What's that? Let's click and find out. Ingenious. - He's searching them all on Link-It. - What's that, like Google? This is a more sophisticated search engine. It pulls up public records. Home addresses, mortgages, driver's licenses... Social security number, court filings, criminal records. Was his last search Kaley Sellers? No. Olivia Benson. You telling me one click and he knows anybody's business? Even a cop's? If he pays for it. Search before hers... - Elliot Stabler. - Oh, he's going to kill Ballentine. This program isn't registered to a Sebastian Ballentine. - Who's it registered to? - Henry Palaver. That's gotta be his mystery partner. Give an address? Yeah. In Canada. RCMP tells me Henry Palaver was a guest of Bordeaux Prison in Montreal from '92 to '97. - Sexual assault. - And abduction of a minor. But no murder charge. Henry doesn't kill his victims? Not on this occasion, but it's probably the only reason he was caught. Girl was 14, memorized his plates. 14, another virgin. So this Henry Palaver is Sebastian's fellow virgin hunter? Nope. They're the same person. Son of a bitch. We ran Sebastian's prints. No criminal record. AFIS doesn't include Canadian prints. Looks like the Palavers have only been in the States for six months. Living under the name Ballentine. The wife took on an assumed identity. She's got to know something. - I don't understand. - Well, it's simple math, Carlene. Your tenth wedding anniversary is coming up next month, but your husband has only been out of prison for eight years. You had a jailhouse wedding, so you had to know what he was in for. Didn't that bother you? You don't know him. Henry's the smartest, sweetest, most charming man I've ever met. He was doing time for sexual assault. How did you two meet? Through a pen pal program. With inmates. Can you imagine anyone more in need of a friend? Poor things are completely cut off from society. Yes. That's the point of putting them behind bars. You think that will make them better? Sweetie, did you think that you could? Yes. But you didn't make him good. He made you bad. That's a mean thing to say. He's raping and killing virgins. And you're helping him. No. We found the search for Kaley in your computer. You printed out directions to St. Anne's on MapQuest last night. We found traces of blood in your van. It's over, Carlene. I'd like to talk to Henry, please. Why would you go along with this? I was afraid... he'd leave me if I didn't. I thought if I could just prove to him how much I loved him, he'd stop. How many girls were there? Maybe twelve. Who were they? Usually hitchhikers. Up in Canada. They thought nothing of getting into a van with a nice married couple. Carlene, Sebastian was here when Kaley was killed. You did that. I had to. I couldn't let him go back to jail. Not when it was my fault. How was it your fault? Yeah, Henry. How is it her fault? I wouldn't have had to rape virgins if she'd been one. What? She completely deceived me. She swore to me that she was untouched when we met. He wasn't allowed to have conjugal visits. So our honeymoon wasn't 'til two years after the wedding. So you were unfaithful? Never. I was a virgin those entire two years, but not before. I thought that would be enough. I knew the second I tried to... - consummate... - You couldn't perform. No. I could read her face like a book. She was used goods. What is it about this virgin compulsion? Afraid you're not gonna measure up to other men? No, no, no. I'm more than adequate in bed. But the expression on a girl's face her first time is... incomparable. These girls weren't having sex, they were being raped. Their faces were palettes. Shock, confusion, panic, fear. And always... just a soupcon of pain. Why'd you come here? You know, if you hadn't, you might've gotten away with it. Well, I had to see what I had set into motion. Your expressions were priceless. This place was like a beehive that I poked with a stick. And also I just... I like to help. Tell me where Sister Peg is. How would I know? Henry was here with us when she was abducted. That means that you had to have taken her. - No. - I know this wasn't your idea. He told you exactly what to do, didn't he? I need to talk to Henry, please. Where is she? - I'd just like to see him. - Did you hurt her? - No! - Carlene, where is she? Sister Peg? Sister Peg, hold on, we're here. Sister Peg? Sister Peg! I see a gash on the side of her head. Her head's been split open. I got a pulse, I got a pulse. Sister Peg. Sister Peg! Hey.Hey. It's okay. It's us. You have to save the baby. What baby? A woman said somebody left a baby in the van. - Relax, the bus is coming. - It was freezing. He was in there all alone. He was naked and screaming. I crawled in to get him, and I looked back. Last thing I saw was this woman swinging a tire iron at me. It's okay. She set you up. It was her baby. - No, no. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got her. - We got her. - The baby is fine. - He was never in any danger. - He was. He was. On the drive here, she was... she was yelling at him. Said, uh, it was his fault his... his... his daddy still needed to cheat. Said, uh, she must have picked a bad baby. Carlene, tell me about your baby again. - What about him? - Six months ago in Montreal, Dannette Lancour was eight and a half months pregnant. Someone cut the fetus out of her. Now, six months, that's how old Henry J. is. - That's when you fled Canada. - No, Henry Junior is ours. We checked. There are no birth records for Henry Junior. We can't find anyone who remembers seeing you pregnant, who thought you were pregnant. Because you weren't. I couldn't stand seeing Sebastian with those other girls. I did everything he asked. It was never enough. I thought if we could be a real nuclear family that would fix everything. But it didn't. You can't have children of your own. Sebastian knew I wasn't a virgin. He couldn't touch me. You've never had sex with your own husband. No. If I go to jail, will they let Henry Junior come visit me? He's going back to his real father, to the grieving husband of the woman you butchered. But I'm the only mother he knows. You stupid, dizzy cow! - I'm sorry, I love you. - Let her go, Ballentine. Are you happy now? That's what I get for associating with a filthy slut. Let her go. Take the whore away. - Please don't say that. - Get her out of here. Henry, please... You said if I did all those things for you, you'd never leave me. You promised me. I lied! Well, this was fun. Best sex I ever had. You know, they're looking to extradite your sorry ass back to Canada. I'm gonna make damn sure you stay right here. I believe you really mean that. I kinda grew on you, didn't I? YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL Northeasterly winds... Armstrong finished strong... Bernard, in the beginning, you didn't even feel sick? Not at all. I lost a little hair. But I wasn't worried. A year later, I had a stiff neck. That was unpleasant. I should say, I'm a cab driver. I thought it was all the driving. It wasn't that. Not at all. Then I got vision problems. It started very gradually. It was very debilitating. Thanks, Bernard. Back after the news. Enjoy your lunch. Now the weather... Clouds in the north, throughout the Channel regions... Huguette! What do I do with a vegetarian niece? 4 pounds, 14 ounces. She's against killing animals. Like my son says, "Can't eat them alive!" - He is something, that guy... - Out the head off? That would be nice. Eats only vegetables! I said maybe the carrot suffers when you yank it. What do you know? Just cause it can't talk. Nothing! We know nothing! So guess what? She stopped eating carrots! Twelve pounds, six ounces. That's 30 Euros, 5 cents. I don't have the 5 cents. Change a twenty? I'll let it go, but... Youki, get out! Youki, I said get out! Shirley, just tell your boss your lover's taking you to paradise. And I have only an hour to pack? It can't be done! All you'll need there is your bathing suit. Come here. Oh Shirley, I love you. What do you mean, vacation? ! With who? ! I don't know, sir. With Peter MacCollough! I'll break him. Call the World Center. Right now, Sabrina! Let's go, Panpan. Come on, buddy. Shit. Look! I found sea urchins! Hey. They sting! Your 7's look like 1's. Cross your sevens! It's not a hard to cross a 7. Five cents missing. The Lochet woman. No change. It's a matter of principle. They lose respect for you. At 5 cents, your respect is cheap. You watch too much crap. All those American soaps. They go to your head. Then you start talking fancy. You think you're Pamela Anderson? Panpan weighs the same. He eat? Never stops! You let him run. He's so fat he doesn't run, he rolls! What did you feed him? Me? You're going to tell me what to feed animals now? Today, it's mashed potatoes. Go on, act all American! The cows are waiting. The meat's in the pan and I took the cheese out. Two Blue Lagoons. - To the two of us! - Two? No, Brian. More like the three of us! - You're going to be a Dad! - Oh Jesse! It's cold! That's the best gift I could have! Married under community property, and having stipulated the surviving spouse inherits all, there should be no problem. Once again, Mr. Pigrenet, my condolences. If you need anything, don't hesitate. I can't get by alone. Oh, I'm sure you'll weather this. Weather! Two more weeks before it rains. The crop is ruined this year! I meant you'll weather the storm. In time, the wound will heal. The wound? You get over it. Huguette's over what? No. You'll get over the hurt. - Your grief will fade. - Oh. My grief, yeah. I can deal with the grief. But the work. On my own, I can't do it. What I need is... A woman? I'm sure one day, Mr. Pigrenet, you'll start over. Well, in Montbouchard, women are not a bumper crop. In the meantime... Great thing about women is they do stuff men can't do. The housework, laundry. But they're hard to find. You have to get out. Out? I'm done work at 8. I go out, everyone's home already. If you really can't find someone, you could call a matrimonial agency. A matrimonial agency? Right. When you get over the shock, I have a good referral for you. Be brave, Mr. Pigrenet. About that referral, while I'm here... I know, I'm in shock, but for when I'm less shocked. Who died? Huguette, Mom. It really must have hurt. Electrocution? You feel no pain. Not a whiff. More than a whiff of barbecue. 220 volts, you'd smell too. You're doing the trifecta on the day we bury Huguette? Yeah! What's the date? Working nights now? You here? - You OK? - Yeah, fine. Antoine will help you tomorrow. Keep your son, I don't need him. Can't you stop whining, for once? I can get by on my own. Only place you'll get on your own is next to Huguette! Foam supposed to be here? Cat supposed to be there? Love For A Day, Love Forever Heavy weight, huh? Heavyweight? Being alone is heavy. First you feel you'll muddle through, but no. No, you just can't. First time? That I lost my wife? Yes. Oh, you lost? I'm sorry. A long time ago? Well, almost ten days now. But hey, I'm in shock. My husband died 11 years ago. I got a dog. But the truth is, even a nice dog is no substitute. Did you try getting a pet? Animals I got. And solitude doesn't go away. Wake up alone, go to sleep alone, eat alone... One day you wonder, why eat? Why wake up? Why get your hair done? My hair... We used to order one dessert with two spoons. Then one spoon goes, you don't order dessert. That's the beginning. The beginning? Of the end. But don't lose hope. You'll see... It comes back. You'll get dessert with two spoons again. Route des Vignes... Montbouchard. There. Now, do you like classical music? Sinatra, stuff like that? Right. But also Mozart, Chopin. And going out? You like that? Theater, movies. Well, I saw Dr. Chicago once. No, Zhivago. Doctor Zhivago. Maybe. But it was long! Boy was it ever long! You don't like much, Mr. Pigrenet. You need to find someone who shares your interests. So I need to know your interests. Well, mainly I have animals. There! A woman who likes animals. One who can take care of them. Someone strong, in good health. Athletic. I got land. She wants to jog, she can. Oh, another thing. The washing machine. She has to know how to use it. It was plugged up with cat hair but now it works again. Well, that's secondary. I have nothing to wear! Right, so scratch the theater and the classical music. - Yeah, maybe. - There. And physically? Do you prefer blondes, brunettes? Well yeah, with hair. Let's try another way. I want to be an actress, or a model. I love France. It seems shocking, but since you're in a hurry and, obviously, the emotional side matters little, this looks like the best solution. I love children. I love coming to France. They'll come to France? You have no idea how they live in Rumania. Yeah, but they have nail polish. They're... They couldn't work. It's a farm. They'd do anything to come to France. Go for a weekend, bring one back. It can go very fast. You realize what this is? - Buying a woman! - Buying? ! God, how horrible! You don't buy a woman, you save her from poverty! You're a savior. A savior... You save her life. What do I tell people? You're visiting relatives. Relatives? Mine are relative strangers! Precise as by hand, and quicker. And these babies never need repairs. Sold 2 just this morning. I'm telling you. What I really need is an electric milker. It's German. The Germans do it right. At home, we got all German. Even the corkscrew! Next week is the Eurotier Show. Me and my wife never miss it. I'm telling you. Heard of it? Agricultural show in Germany. It was on TV yesterday. It's in Germany? Love For A Day, Love Forever. Oh, Mr. Pigrenet. About this Rumania thing, I might be free next weekend. Fly there? I'd rather take the train. It's longer, but not as high. What happened? What happened was, I happened by, thought I'd say hello. - Not warm tonight. - No. Had dinner yet? - Who is it? - It's Aymé! Who am I? There. King Kong. Let's go, come on! Ask a question. Am I a famous man? Am I a ladies' man? What, no? He did loads of women! Never heard of the Eurotier Show? In Germany. They make incredible milkers now. German engineering. You in Germany? I have to beg to get you to the café! No milkers in cafés! Am I dead? Who's dead? I might go next weekend. Next weekend? Antoine, the disposable camera. Who's dead? Bring me back some pictures. I'd love that. Of what? Of Germany! She had a boyfriend there. Jurgen. One of those phony-looking guys, fake blond. Fake? That was his natural color! - Curly locks... - Enough! Who died? Napoleon! Napoleon died! It's easy. It's automatic. Can't make a mistake. My turn. Am I an animal? Am I King Kong? You cheated! In 2 questions! Cheated? Me? Aymé, did I cheat? Where? I quit. You're both liars. I'll make coffee. Mom. Aymé, where in Germany? Hanover. - Bring us sauerkraut! - A big dinner! - And lots of sausages! - Don't forget the pictures. And beer! Relax, you'll be fine. Take some, for the ears. They're big. You thought they were for... God that's funny. It's candy. It's for the air pressure. It unpops your ears. Catherina! Telegram! Hang on, I'm coming. Elena, a Frenchman! A Frenchman just got here. A Frenchman? We have to rush. First interview at 2. Hang on, I have to mail this. No, I'll do it. How touching. You wrote to yourself. I never got a letter from abroad. You could've sent a postcard. No frills. It's just for me. Silvia, it's your turn. Good luck. Thank you. Hurry, Silvia. What's he look like? Does he really have money? What's he like? Bald. What does he want? I don't know. He has a farm. He wants you more in the field than in bed. Bad news, I'm telling you. You mind? Could I borrow your sweater? - This? - Yeah. Please. She likes sports. And she loves to ski. Only likes disco. I love Moulin Rouge. She likes windmills. I love France. I think you're so handsome. Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysées... And I think you're so handsome. She speaks fluent Japanese. Won't help me. She's a nurse. - She cares for people. - No farmer. I dream of becoming a singer. And dancer. You're so handsome. You're so handsome. Again? Why do they say that? What do I care if I'm handsome? Tell her she's not obliged. - Explain I'm not handsome. - She can see that. I mean... She sees. She sees you. I don't have to explain. If she thinks you're handsome... Maybe by Rumanian standards. Me, Elena. Me, Aymé. Me 28 years old. Me have farm. Big farm. And you have cows? Chickens? Rabbits. Rabbits? That I got. I love that! She loves rabbits. The country, farmland... I think you're so... Handsome! Handsome? No. - Don't go overboard. - No. You're so lucky, work on farm. Elena. Excuse me, sir. Do you know where there's a store to buy sauerkraut. Varza acra. Sauerkraut. Excuse me. Could you take picture? Picture of me. It's just, press this. One second. Wait. Oh, this is good. - You want eat here? - Yeah. Then all of a sudden, no TV, no milker... no Huguette. Huguette was my wife. Never very solid. Broke down twice already. Twice in six months. Elena, never buy a used milker. You get me? Never. I'll not buy. - Swear it. - I swear. If you want, me stay with you... in France. Shake on it. You don't rather kiss me? Oh look! A German Shepherd! Sir! Picture? Can I? The dog. German Shepherd. Souvenir of Rumania. Angela... I'll be back. I'll send you money. You'll have your dance school. You'll open soon. Together! We were supposed to do it together! - You'll wake Gaby. - So? She'll see her mother's gone. It'll be all right. I'll bring her to France. She'll come live with me there. Before Christmas. Tell her. Don't forget to tell her. Who is this little girl, walking around without slippers? Back to bed. You'll catch cold in your feet. You'll be sick. She's such a good little girl. Kiss! Take it, for the ears. Not to put in the ears. You eat it, it unpops your ears. You thought? That's funny. I'm laughing, but no offense. You're not used to airplanes. Nine isn't made up yet. I have 18, but it's shower only. Elena, is a shower OK? Here. So you come when I call you. That's my address. Don't lose it. You'll take a taxi. For the others, you're the daughter of my brother's godson's... No. My wife's godson's daughter's brother. I'm his brother. No, forget it. The best way is you don't speak any French. Shit. Shit! How was Germany? Lots of Germans. Lots of people, cars... you know, Germany! And the show? The show. Like France, but there. And overpriced! I'll get my milker here. You got some haul. I'll have Françoise cook it up. Hey. A letter from Rumania. - Who would write me from Rumania? - The sauerkraut... My heavens. Who could it be? I know no one in Rumania. Here or at my place? Who could be writing? We have the sauerkraut here? Yeah, but who writes me from Rumania? Open it. Save the stamp for Antoine. My heavens. "Dear Aymé, "life is hard... "Our daughter... " Right. Elena is my wife's godson's brother's daughter... It's complicated. On my wife's side. "Internship on your farm! Thank you!" Oh, the nerve! Here, read it! What am I, a youth hostel! ? What is this? No way! No way she gets through my door! Like I don't have enough work already? Enough troubles? And I could just see what kind of girl she is. A little teen, never saw a cow, and the nail polish... No way. No Rumanian girl will live here! Have a heart. Let her come. Oh, all right. Oh yeah. This is really something else. Not just sauerkraut. Yeah, you can taste it's... a sauerkraut that's... Not a sauerkraut like just anyone. Germany, I'm telling you. Funny... I can't decide. I do think it's... Well... I sort of agree with you, Sylvie. I mean it's... - It's not bad. - Right. But it's nothing special. Right, exactly. Talk about pearls before swine! Next time buy canned stuff, they can't tell the difference! I say one word... Where will she sleep? Haven't figured it out. Is this your first time in France? Is this first time, you in France? She's Rumanian, not deaf. Pretty something. Coming in the middle of the night, not a word of French. She looks like she can manage. Why didn't your wife's brother's godson teach her French? He died when she was born. Who died? Her father. He died when he was just a baby. Horrible. He didn't die a baby. It's her. She's dead? You drank too much. He's not the only one. If she can work like she drinks, you won't have much left to do. She can't understand a word. Maybe she's stupid. Enough! You're putting her to work? She came to intern, so she'll intern. And then... The ideal woman. Young, pretty and doesn't talk. Lucky stiff. They can talk with their hands. Well. She's caught someone's eye. I got a feeling this girl is the beginning... Of what? Of your headaches. Tomorrow! I said to come tomorrow. No more money. With what I gave you? Shopping. Spent much! Spent? Here we go! - What is that? - Your bed. "Clic clac!" Right! Doesn't clic or clac! Throw money out the window, and this won't work. I hope it's clear. You're here, but nothing is permanent. Why won't it open more? I have specific needs. If you're not right, then, frankly, it won't last. For you. Gift. It has flowers. Flowers. I can see that. Waste money on flowers! White ones? Yeah. Even white ones. You know tree? It's a "Guard-Elena. " No! A gardenia. Gardenia? I thought, Guard-Elena. No, it's nia. Nia means nothing. I'll guard it anyway. What are you doing? Too much noise? Seen the time? You always... Wait. You always whine? So I'm whining now? I don't do dishes at 2 AM. It's not you. It's me. Yeah, well. Never mind. Careful, it'll fall! This... apron. Like this. You... handsome. Handsome? Before, you said I wasn't. That was before. And now? Now what? I have no towel. Eat? Shouldn't have. I got a sandwich. Sandwich? Not good for... You like great music? Classical music? Love it. I can't work without classical music. Mozart or... the guy with the piano. But especially Mozart! Mozart is really beautiful. Mozart is very musical. And he wound up deaf. - Mozart? - Stone deaf! Tomorrow, I look for work, in town. Work? But there's work here! Antoine will show you what to do. Need money for family. If you want, I'll pay you for the work you do on the farm. 500 a month OK? 500 Euros? That's a lot! Many months work at home. So 200? No, 500... It's very good. And also... Sleep with you. Sleep with me? Why? Well... I mean... Look, Elena, right now... That must be my electric milker. - Antoine? Did you eat? - Yeah, he ate. Antoine! You better come along. We might need you. See you later. Think I have a pot belly? Enough, he'll be back tomorrow. He never talks to me. He talks to no one, never has. Maybe he has nothing to say. You'll get bitten one day. Why no name for dog? That's the way it is. Never call him, he's always here. We call him... Ciufut. What's that mean? It means "whiner". Very clever. It's not a him, it's a her. I'm hungry. Restaurant? There's food here. Don't be idiotic. Ciufut. Let's go to a restaurant. Decided on dessert? A peach melba. You sir? No thanks, I'm full. Yes. With me. No, Elena. One peach melba. - You children have? - Can't stand them. They yell, always on your back, can't understand. Later, maybe. About 12 or 13, they can help on the farm. If you get a boy. Girls on a farm are a catastrophe. You have children? No, silly me. Silly? Why? If you did, you wouldn't be here. There you are. I brought you two spoons. That way... Two spoons? For us two. You never did dessert with two spoons? Never. We're going to win. Right, Panpan? 13 lbs., 4 ounces! Oan you imagine, Elena? BIGGEST RABBIT CONTEST Let the winner through. One, two... can you hear me? Roland, it's not a stadium. It doesn't work. See that? They're all watching Panpan. Look. All dying of jealousy. Antoine, you take care of Elena please. Hi, I'm Pierre. This is Nicolas, Oédric. Elena, who can't speak French. Look. They're after the Rumanian. I don't get it. She's plain. Men prefer plain women. We have too much personality. It scares them off. True. I've often been told I was scary. Lucien Hubert. Six pounds ten. Thierry Lucet. - Let me. - All right. Seventeen pounds, six ounces. But he's dead. Wait, your rabbit is dead. What do you mean? He was alive two minutes ago! Who's dead? The rabbit is dead. It's a heart attack. He's eliminated. Eliminated? This really sucks! Got a nerve. Entering a dead bunny. Last contestant. Aymé Pigrenet. Six pounds, ten ounces. Aymé Pigrenet is the winner! Elena! Look what I won! A barometer! ...the poet died... On the day that the poet died... Carrots, grass... I did the same and boom. Look. May 24th, 1976. So you play 2, 4 and 5. Get it? Doesn't the winner buy a round? What'll it be? Champagne all around! Don't get crazy here. Look, isn't that sweet? They make a nice couple. Like peas in a pie! In a pod! Not in a pie! Elena, let's go home! Hey, she can stay. We have work at home. You'll die on your tractor. Like Moliére. Like Moliére? Drop it. Let her relax. It's Sunday. Sunday or no Sunday! Don't forget Panpan. Here. Who's dead? The poet! The poet died! - Let's go. - Let her live. Enough, pea pie! - You angry? - No I'm not angry. But you with that skirt... I never saw such a skimpy skirt. What means "skimpy"? It means your legs are showing. You saw I have legs? Hello. Congratulations! He earned his medal. Panpan is pretty. How cute. See? We even scare widowers. What is that? You'll start a fire with this crap! - It's pretty. - Pretty? Look at this room! Perfume? It stinks like a polecat! Polecat? - Like cat? - Like a cathouse! What's that make-up? Have you seen yourself? What's this? A night gown? This is a night gown? Get out of this bed! In Rumania, they raise whores? ! What are you doing? Elena, what? Where are you going? I'm fed up! Fed up with everything. Fed up with everyone thinking I don't speak French. Fed up with being the brother's godsend. Godson. Where are you going? Wherever I want. I'm not your wife. Keep this up, you won't be! Fine! I know you don't want me. I'll find someone who wants me. At this hour? So that's it? You want to find a French husband? Anyone. First one you see. Yes, first one I see. The first one you saw is me! I came and got you. I came first. I'm the first guy you saw! No, Carmen. I'm coming home. But he hates me! I can't stay here. Leave me. I don't want see you more. Never! I'm sorry. I was angry, it was silly. The guys in the café, taking you in their arms. They took me in there arms. Not my fault. No, it's not your fault. The fault is mine. They take you in their arms because you're no one's woman. That's how people are. If you belong to no one, you belong to everyone. And you say, they raise us in Rumania this way. Whores. I'm not this. I didn't mean it. It just came out. You were there on my bed. So beautiful. You were waiting for me. For me, you were waiting. The more I saw you, so perfect, the more I saw myself, so... I felt old all of a sudden. Not in the right place. Like the foreigner was me. I yelled at you, but I meant myself. You see, I was angry at myself. I'm really sorry. You're sunshine, Elena. Real sunshine. Sunshine. I know you pity girls like me. Pity? Look at you. How can anyone pity you? You even light up the night. Since you came, I see things I never saw. I see them, but here. On the inside, where your sun shines. So now what do I do with it? What do I do with what's in here? Pity? Pity me. I didn't mean to give slap. You hurt? Not anymore. Up already? Here. They're still warm. What's this? Birthday, my... my sister. You have a sister? I didn't know. Her name is Gaby. For Gaby, from me. No, she's too little. - How old is she? - Six. A real little sister. Still a baby. I go. Now? Post office is closed. I have my horses. Yesterday almost win. No, you had one horse. For the trifecta you need three. That's what I said. Almost. Blow out all the candles tomorrow. You have lots this year. Six candles! Have you been good? I sent you some presents. Lots of little presents. What? Gaby? Why do you say, "Thank you, Ma'am"? Don't say ma'am. I'm your mommy. Don't say that. Don't cry. My sweetheart, my own little darling. Yes, I'm coming back. I promise. Mommy will be coming home very soon. I promise, I'll come home. ...gathering slowly over the northern regions... should yield afternoon finishing third in the shot up 53% to... Shit. Shit! Pain in the ass! Not staying to eat with me? A lot of work. No, Antoine. Don't feel like. What are you doing? Stop, that's not comical! That your Rumanian? She doesn't sound bored. Elena, a letter for you. How did you make her laugh? Come off it. She hasn't laughed in days, now she's hysterical. What did you do? Stop it. Stop, you dope. Stop! That made her laugh? Elena, we're going to Paris. OK? To Paris, for the weekend. OK? A ride on the Seine, in a boat. And the department stores. Did Antoine give you that? He gives you gifts now? True, he's a good friend. Wonder what you two tell each other all day. Lots of things. What do you talk about? We don't talk. How long ago? About two months. In the name of Aymé Pigrenet. Right, here it is. I know that. That's Bucharest. Bucharest? In Germany? No, in Rumania. Look. The Ceausescu Palace. That and the Great Wall of China are visible from the moon. Well? The pictures? They're all dark. All of them, can't see a thing. Right. When Antoine does it, you crack up! When it's me, you start crying? I'm sorry. I get all upset. She's been this way for days. Doesn't eat, doesn't talk. I toss eggs, she doesn't laugh. What's wrong with her? She's homesick. Well if you saw her home... Well... I imagine life in Rumania isn't... That's why guys go there. The girls will marry anybody, rather than go on the way they are. Sure, but her... She's here for an internship. If the guy doesn't marry her, she'll have done it all for nothing. Sure, but she's an intern. And that's dishonest. Or else... he doesn't love her. Yes he does. How long is the internship? I don't know. That long? Your gardenia's going to croak. - I take good care of it. - Not good enough. Did you know the Ceausescu Palace is visible from the moon? Well, on the other hand, who cares about the moon? We'll never go. Hello... Pigrenet. Aymé Pigrenet. - I'd like a ring. - What kind of ring? For a finger. Yes, of course. - For a young woman? - Yes, very pretty. I have no doubt, sir. An engagement ring, I imagine? Yes. Engagement. Elena, I hope you'll wear this ring because diamonds are eternal. Well, real diamonds are. Because, just so you know, it's a real diamond. Better be. That's not... I want you to accept this ring which could be an engagement ring if you will marry me. No, to get engaged. You'll get a wedding ring too. No, that's not great either. This ring is just a simple ring. Only you can make it an engagement ring. Yeah, that's good. Elena, it's up to you to make this an engagement ring. Yeah, that's very good. Very good. Did I scare you? Sorry. Yes you scare me. Well... Elena, I would like, well, how can I put it? You always come in behind. You scare every time me. Forgive me. But recently you've had earphones on all day and night. It's like you're not there. Yes, I am here. But I have no place for me. Nothing. I have nothing here. I'm like a stranger. Don't say that. Not even own room. In bathroom, my stuff on the ground! This is not my home. I want my home. I want to be home. I'll see to it. You'll be home, I promise. Parinti... Parents. Féricità... Happy. "Dear parents, I'm not happy... " "here. " "Now I know I made a mistake. " "I shouldn't have left. " "I long for you. " Oh, she longs for you. "I miss you terribly. " "I'll be back before Christmas. " "I won't anymore leave you. " Or, "I won't leave you again. " "Ever. " Mr. Pigrenet, she wrote you a beautiful letter! Believe me, she loves you. Thanks. Elena, I'm going to town. I'll stop at the TAB. I got your ticket. Sorry, nothing. - You won. - I won? ! Your horses came in, straight up. I got you cash. I won? I won how much? How much is it? 15,650 Euros. Mine? Yes, yours. It's the happiest day of my life! I'm rich! I'm a millionaire! - Millionaire? - Yes! For us back there, it's lots! Back there. I go to buy dresses! Many! And also, gift for you. And also, champagne. Must hide it. It's lots! I'll take care of it. - Want me to come along? - No. Alone, to buy dresses. I'm so happy. Thank you! - Not my doing. - Yes! 12, 3, 5. It's the day you... you bring me here. I'm taking the scooter! Valence-Bucharest. No direct flight. You change in Paris. One tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - No? Later? No, tomorrow. Champagne! Have to put it on ice. You think it's pretty? Very. And gift for you! This keep warm you. And this is for Ciufut. See you tomorrow. You'd go without saying goodbye? Look at this. It won't fit all scattered. And it'll get all wrinkled. It's all scrunched up. You'd have missed your plane. Taxis get lost coming here. I'll drive you. I got you here, I'll take you back. And you'll save money. What'll you do with the money? Open a dance school. A dance school? That's nice. Surrounded by little rats? Yeah, but little ones. Not real rats. It's just a thing we say here. There you go. I try to make you laugh, you cry. Plus you haven't slept. So naturally... We got a few hours. Get some rest. We call them little rats because long ago, at the Opera, they put kid dancers way upstairs. In the attic. That's what they said on the radio. When they were toe-dancing, they'd go "tick, tick, tick. " Like little rats' feet when they walk. See? But why they call a tutu a "tutu", that's a mystery. Maybe when they walked they went "too, too". No reason why they should go "too, too". You're sleeping. Get a window seat. Nothing much to see, but... at least there are clouds. Flight 315 to Paris is now boarding... You have to go. You're the last. Goodbye, Elena. I'm not going. What do you mean? I'm staying. You've no business here. Yes, I have business. I have chicken coup! You don't even tend it well. I have to back you up. It's double work with you here. You weigh me down! And plus now you cry all day long. That's not true. Like it's me? You see me crying? Miss? Newspaper? - Yes. - Which? Doesn't matter. - What? - Isn't this the Mousquet farm? No, on the other side. Left on your way out. I know. It's not left, it's right. Asshole got our hopes up! Right foot forward. Careful, Gaby. Good. Change feet. Thank you. Have a good day! Thank you! See you next week, children. You look hot like that. Not here. Mom, did I dance well? You were wonderful. You know what they say, oysters are hermaphrodites. Aphrodisiacs, I knew. But that. Yeah. They can change sexes right in your plate. In my plate? That's disgusting. I have a present for you. - For me? - Well, for the dog. What is it? - What is it? - A coat. Oh, a coat. Animals get cold, too. Like humans. Good new year for him. He'll be happy. Should we kiss? Well, it's not midnight yet. I messed up dessert. Terrible. Come with me, please. The mistletoe needs hanging. Seen Aymé? Can't be far. Did you know oysters change sexes in your plate? Sure. Go easy on the booze. They'd still change sexes. Come here, you. Ciufut, come here. Happy New Year. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Stop fooling around and come... Where'd you get that? Get away, you! Look, look what you did do it! The scarf! My grandmother's scarf! On her deathbed she said, "Give the little guy my scarf. " "Little guy", she called me. Even when I was little I was little. That's why it's special to me. I know it's silly, but... I want my room there. That's the kitchen. I'll sleep in the kitchen. Fine, sleep in the kitchen. Watch your step. Elena, the dishes. In the china closet, or in the kitchen? The French newspaper. From the plane back. Your Frenchman again? "Ecologists "demonstrated yesterday "in the streets of Paris. " - I don't get it. - What? It's not the numbers. The numbers? My horses didn't come in. It's the wrong paper. No. It's the right one. May 11th results. I played that day. Then you didn't win. Of course I won. No, you lied to us. You killed the old guy, stashed him in the stable with the cows, stole all his money. His money... Of course, it was his money. What's winning the trifecta? Winning the trifecta? That's... when someone loves you very much. Well I'll be. And I thought it was a goner. See that? Sure, what do you care? What are you doing here? What's your name? Gaby? So you're Gaby? My name's Aymé. I am Aymé. Gaby! Where's your big sister? Where is Elena? Momma! Subtitles by Michael Katims Subtitling by Vdm - Paris Oh, now come on. Come on. You have got to be kidding me. Luke, come down here. This baseboard's not level. I can tell just by looking at it. Tom told you. It's a work in progress. Disaster in progress. This baseboard belongs in a fun house. Luke, going up there is like busting into an operating room in the middle of a heart transplant and getting mad at the surgeon because the guy's heart is on the outside. And you're like, "hey, his heart should be in his chest." And the surgeon's like, "dude, I'm not done yet. "Get out of the operate room. I got to check the bathroom fixtures. Hey, uh, help. Fire, fire. We're on fire down here. Help. Flames crackling, marshmallows toasting. Save us. What are you doing yelling "fire"? You can't do that. No, that only pertains to movie theaters, crowded ones. If you're watching a wednesday matinee of "Deuce Bigalow", you can yell "fire" all you want. Hell, you can start a fire, and no one will complain. So, how is your project going? Like gangbusters. Looks like it. You're getting rid of a ton. No, no. Whoa, there, mister. Those are the keepers. These are the ones I'm tossing. There's two videotapes in there. Every journey begins with a single step. This was your idea, remember... use the remodel to purge yourself of useless stuff. Yeah, useless. I'm keeping what I need. You need an episode of "Magnum P.I." from 1986. Of course not. That tape is mislabeled. That's a "Knots Landing" from 1981. All the women are held hostage at gunpoint during Ginger's baby shower... classic. "21 Jump Street"... season one. You do not need this. I need my "Jump Street." So buy the DVDs. It'll save you a ton of space. No, the DVDs won't have the commercials on them, the original commercials, which is half the fun. Spuds Mackenzie, Clara Peller, "Nothing comes between me and my Calvins." I mean, they don't make them like that anymore. You're gonna be one of those weird old people who hoards empty film canisters and laundry measuring scoops. Uh, gonna be. Hey, I've been looking for this. Check it out. "Riding the bus with my sister." Rosie O'Donnell plays a retarded woman who's obsessed with riding the bus, and Andie Macdowell is her uptight, big-city sister. - Sister? - Yeah, and it gets better. In the ads I saw, the Rosie character was calling herself the sheriff and bragging about her sex life and buying toilet seats. And Anjelica Huston directed it. Maerose directed it. Okay, fine. Watch it tonight after I leave. Then you can dump it tomorrow. You kidding? You don't just sit down and watch a movie like this. This is a friday-night special. I'd have to have takeout, pizza, red vines, mallomars... the works. Plus, there's no way I would watch this by myself. This is exactly the kind of movie I would watch with someone... Someone else, you know? Yeah, right. Well, at least try to pare this box down a little, please? I'll try. I will. I promise. Good. If you promise not to go upstairs again. I just got to check on one thing. Oh, look at that... "America's Castles," the special Florida edition. Seen it five times, keeping it. One thing. Oh, "The History of Paper, "a documentary by Ted Burns, distant relative of Ken Burns. Oh, seven hours, dull, dull, dull. Keeping it! I'm not going up. Good. "Please don't eat the Daisies," seasons two and four. I've been looking for this. Come in. Good morning, miss Gilmore. Good morning. Oh, wow, need help? No, thank you. What's that for? Mrs. Gilmore instructed me to help you with your summer things. My summer things? Mrs. Gilmore says that autumn is the time for sweaters and wool, not for sundresses and flipper-floppers. Oh. Well, I don't really dress seasonally. I just sort of go with the flow. That is what Mrs. Gilmore would like to correct. Oh. Hello? Hello, Rory, it's your grandmother. Grandma, we were just talking about you. How are you? How's Helsinki? Cold, unaccommodating, a population of walking dead. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. The cab driver from the airport was a thief. And the cuisine isn't fit for a stray cat... kippers and cabbage rolls. And the weather... it snowed 6 feet last night, and apparently they can't fly under those conditions. Can't or won't, it's hard to say. I defy you to read a finn. Yeah, they can be pretty stoic in those northern climes. Uh, excuse me, but I actually use a lot of this in autumn. You know, light layers. Anyway, your grandfather and I are going to be delayed a couple of days. I'm sorry. That stinks. I'm in a real bind. I've got that mixer with the girls I'm hosting tomorrow with the curators of the Gilbert Stuart exhibit. Oh, right. I wear it with tights. But here I am thousands of miles away, stuck in a land of reindeer stew, and I'm loathe to cancel because there's nothing Constance Betterton would like more than for me to slip up so she can destroy my reputation, run me out of the D.A.R., then jump in the air like a cheerleader and land doing the splits. Uh, wow. That's... the splits, huh? Um, whatever I can do to help, grandma. I wear white after labor day. - Rory? - I'm a rebel. Just go with it. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm still here, grandma. I was wondering if you could possibly fill in for me. I would be so grateful. - Me? At the mixer? - It's all ready to go. The menu is set, and these new caterers I found are fabulous. All you have to do is smile and make sure everyone's cocktails are replenished. Well... Just picture that snake doing the splits. Um, okay, grandma. I'll help you out. Oh, bless you. I'll check in a little later and give you a briefing about some of the canapés. Good, because I'm rusty on canapés. Call you later. Okay, bye, grandma. Stay warm. Maid? No, this is not going to work. Maid? ! A bath? A baptism is nothing like taking a bath! I'm not saying it's a bath! I'm just saying if you don't believe in the religious aspect of it, then it's like a bath... as simple and as brief as a bath. - Coffee. - It is so not like taking a bath! When you take a bath, there are candles and water-warped entertainment weeklys to read and soap. There are not people standing around praying over you, at least not when I take a bath. Who's getting baptized? Oh, our kids are, because apparently we're suddenly super-religious. No kidding. Would you guys mind moving over just a little bit? Thanks. Sookie, look at the baptism as a bargaining chip. If we give my mother this, then it'll soften the blow when she finds out that we're not having any more children because of the vasectomy. They'll want to stay at the house if we have this baptism your whole family. We'll just have to make room. How? The house is barely big enough for us and the kids. We'll end up sleeping on a leaky air mattress in the kids' room and getting horrible creaks in our neck while your mother blasts her "flatt and scruggs" CD. And your cousins are gonna be picking their teeth with my paring knives. Oh, like your family is so easy! What about the time we had to see your stuttering cousin Odell in the worst production of "Nicholas Nickleby" known to man? ! That was like nine hours of pure hell! And did I get to fake a heart attack during intermission? No! I'm sorry. There is a difference between nine hours and three full days. There's 48 hours plus 24, whatever that is, minus 9 hours. What does that equal? 48 and 24, so that's, uh... eight and four... and that's two... and 10 over. Whoa! Whoa! Sookie, don't do math. You know that hurts your head. Ow. Hey, I have an idea. If you're gonna have the baptism and you've got three days of family in town, how about if they all stay here? At the Inn? Yeah. Just give me the dates. We'll work it out. And that would be okay? Sookie, you're part owner of the place. Oh, yeah. That would really help. So, cool. I'll take care of the arrangements. Sookie, you just deal with the post-baptism party. Oh. I didn't know anything about a post-baptism party. You didn't tell me anything about a post-baptism party. I didn't know myself. I've got some late-summer salad recipes I've been wanting to try out. Oh, perfect. Okay, well, just let Michel know how many rooms you need, and I'll see you guys later. - Thanks, Lorelai. - Yeah, thanks, hon. I just need the invoice signed for the zucchini and I'm off. You think I'm taking this zucchini? You ordered them. You stressed them out. - Don't point that thing at me. - Guys. I can tell. Get them out of here. No, you give me the invoice. I'll just have one of my guys get them out of here. This isn't about the zucchini. This is about the baptism. Well, I christen these vegetables sucky! Oh, hello, Sarah. Thank you so much for coming. Excuse me. Hold on a sec. This tray is half empty. Should we fill it up to make it look less sad? Uh, this is the last tray. What? Oh, no. Oh, boy, there are only eight trays of salmon puffs allotted for the whole night? This is not good. This is really not good. Do you think I should have staggered their release? I should have. I should have staggered their release. Okay, well, just spread them out, and then push the shrimp. Okay, you can circulate now. Circulate. Uh, excuse me. There's garnish on this tray and there shouldn't be. My grandmother hates garnish. Here, I'll just, uh... there you go. Okay, go, circulate. Circulate. - Hello, Lana. - Hello. Nice to see you. Carole, hello. Great dress. Darla, does the pearls council know about you? Fabulous. Everything all right over here, ladies? Everything's perfect, Rory. This is a lovely party. And those salmon puffs... insane. Aren't they, though? Eight trays, and they're almost gone. I might have to go grab a pole and do some fishing. Let me know if you need anything. I like the way he paints Washington's hair. It looks so luminous. If Gilbert Stuart were alive today, I would absolutely commission him to paint a portrait of my Henry. Well, Martha Washington had the same impulse. In 1796, she commissioned Stuart to do a portrait of her husband along with the one of herself to hang at Mount Vernon. Henry's not Nora's husband. He's her springer spaniel. Oh. May I freshen your drink, Nora? Well, thank you, Rory. That's awfully sweet of you. Vodka tonic. No ice and light on the tonic. I'll be right back. Isn't she just darling? Excuse me? Hi. The woman with the red hair over by the paintings, could you get her a vodka tonic, please, A.S.A.P.? Thanks. No ice and light on the tonic. Oh, Rory, perfect. Maybe you could help us with something. Absolutely. We're admiring this plant here... this one with the waxy leaves... and yet the name for it has gone right spot out of our heads. I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what it's called. But I promise to ask my grandmother and let you know. Let me just get your phone number here. Oops! Garnish. You just can't get away from it, huh? Um, excuse me for a minute. Hey, I didn't know you were coming. Yeah. I forgot you had a thing today. Oh, it's okay, because now I get to show you off. Nancy, Lucy, I'd like to introduce Logan Huntzberger. Logan, this is Nancy Osgood and Lucy Faxton-Field. How do you do, Logan? It's such a pleasure to meet the young Huntzberger. Hey. Uh, Logan, I think I've told you about Nancy. She's the one who insists I look like Clara Barton, which I'm still not sure is a compliment. Oh, it's a compliment of the highest order. Um, well, if you'll excuse us, I think I promised Logan one of the coveted salmon puffs. So nice to meet you, Logan. Want some coffee? With your scotch? Sorry, I'm just not in the mood to deal with this type of thing right now, these type of people. Why? Did something happen? So how long do you think this thing's gonna last? Um, an hour, hour and a half tops, and then 15 minutes for me to pay the caterers and make sure the cleaning staff knows what to do.
