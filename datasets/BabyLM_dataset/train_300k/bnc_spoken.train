, General Manager of the Entertainments Section, without management and dedication the would not have survived to become the major force in British theatre that it is today. I represented the Council at Mister funeral service. Would members please rise and stand in silence in memory of Mister Thank you. joined the Borough Council as Chief Assistant at Museum in 1965. At Local Government reorganisation in 1974 he was appointed as the Field Officer to set up the innovatory Biological Databank. Since that date, under his leadership, his team have established an outstanding reputation, providing an ecological consultancy service to Local Authorities, Water th Water Companies, the National Coal Board and private Companies. Its work ranges from soil analysis to Civil Engineering firms, to drawing up green plans for Local Authorities. Now renamed Ecological Advisory Service, service has been recognised in the Birthday Honours List by the award of the M B E. His service can be summed up in his own words. It gets me closer to my ultimate goal, doing all I can to enhance the environment we live in. Mister is here with us today and I am sure that members would want to join me in extending warmest congratulations to him on his well-deserved award. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the two South Africans who are attending tod today's meeting of Council. and are are on three months' placement with, on a three months' placement with the Authority until the middle of September as part of a six months' training programme organised by the South African Advanced Educational Project. The overall aim of the programme is to provide high level training and work experience for black South Africans with senior management potential, in order that they can participate fully in providing Local Government services in a post-apartheid dem democratic South Africa. hear hear I hope that you enjoy the remainder of your stay in . The Lady Mayoress and I were honoured to have y have the pleasure of your company when you visited us recently. Thank you very much. And finally, not on the green sheet, I will tell you, to put you all out of your misery, that tea has been arranged for six thirty. Six thirty, tea. A deadly silence at that. S'alright. Ha ha. Item five, inspection of internal documents. I call on the Director of Legal Services. There've been no complaints against restrictions Lord Mayor. Item six which are petitions. I move the petition to be presented from persons requesting the Council to provide facilities for a community centre and youth club at the be received. Is there a seconder? All in favour please show. That is carried. Will the p petitioners please come forward I would welcome you to the meeting. You sp can speak for not more than five minutes. However, take your time. Please start when you're ready. Thank you. Lord Mayor, members of the Council. I and my colleague thank you on behalf of the people in for this opportunity of presenting our case for acceptance of this petition. Past occurrences, however, make us sceptical about receiving a positive response from a body who, on past performance, have been negligent in the provision of services and facilities for the community of . Contrary to public belief, is not a suburb of but an expanding community in its own right, devoid of facilities and services afforded to others under your jurisdiction. Consequently, in the limited time allotted, I will endeavour to emphasise how important such facilities and services are to the community. The teenage element of the community have one inadequate youth club which does not have the facilities to provide the required range of activities and no amount of proposed refurbishment will entice the majority to attend a club which is badly situated and of dubious reputation. has a youth problem. Drugs, glue sniffing, under age drinking and the like are very prevalent amongst the older teenagers and their influence on others a cause for concern. Certain residents are continuously subjected to unnecessary loutish behaviour and areas of the village frequently vandalised. Complaints go unactioned and complaints are . Whilst this is obviously a concern, it can be acted upon, but the influence on others, who have nothing else to do, far more damaging. The other end of the spectrum is the equally large population of elderly and retired people of the village who quite simply have nothing. The , part of the estate, purchased by the then Village Council in nineteen hundred and five for the benefit of the village, would provide a home for a community centre and youth club which, properly run and organised, would be a considerable asset to the village. Proper liaison with schools and other groups within the village and the utilisation of other premises would enable these problems to be resolved. The premises are currently occupied by the Community College who, by their unwarranted eviction of the ideal non-political Club for gentlemen of the village, prompted this action. The Local Council, in nineteen hundred and four, had the courtesy to call a rate payers' meeting to discuss the proposed acquisition of the estate and, with the approval of the meeting, proceeded with their purchase. The college, apparently with your approval, are proceeding with the eviction of the club against the wishes of the members, Local Parish Council, Community Council and the residents of the village. Rather than lose a small but integral part of the community, the petition was raised to obtain facilities which would be of benefit to the community. We suggest that the eviction is an unsubstantiated, politically motivated, empire building exercise of no benefit to the village. The college have stated that they require the room to facilitate the attendance of disabled students and or aerobic classes. The facts are, aerobic classes are not on the syllabus, facilities for the disabled are highly commendable but not practical in premises where most classes are held in upstairs locations. The was occupied, against the wishes of the village, by the college, with no improvements to premises considered unsafe and too dangerous to be continued to be used as a public library. The proposed courses for the next term confirm that the college will be only using fifty percent of the available time and space for eight months of the year. Would you accept this situation when your village is desperate for facilities and services to enhance community activities and lifestyle? The college cannot justify the use of its facilities, let along expand its activities, as it has neither the resources or required support facilities. It is highly likely, also, that the majority of courses will continue to be under-subscribed. The Council should emulate its predecessors and, without political prejudice, serve the best interests of the communities under their charge, and take the following action. Close the college, try and absorb the classes into the adequate facilities or re relocate elsewhere in the village in Council-owned premises that are more suitable, have been extensively refurbished and, if required, facilitate the expansion of the college curriculum. Two, rescind the eviction of the club. Three, permit the grange to be used as requested. In conclusion, it should be obvious that the people of the village oppose the erosion of its community facilities and that their needs are far greater than that of an insignificant empire builder. Thank you. Thank you. Does any member wish to move the subject matter be referred to the appropriate member body? Seconded, Lord Mayor. Item seven which is membership of committees.

Thank you Lord Mayor Call upon Councillor to move amendment A? I'm sorry a seconded by? Ok. Call upon Councillor to move amendment A standing in his name. Seconded? Seconded my Lord Mayor Call upon Councillor to move amendment B standing in his name. Is there a seconder? Item nine which is Health Service application to become a National Health Service Trust, call upon Councillor to move the recommendation of the Socialis Social Services Committee. Moved Lord Mayor Is there a seconder? Now then, we'll move to the speakers. Councillor . Thank you Lord Mayor. In 1942 at the Labour Party Conference they adopted a motion moved by that gave, and I quote, the right to all forms of medical attention and treatment to a National Health Service. This was finally achieved on the fifth of July 1948 when the Labour Government implemented the Beveridge Report. It's worth recording that the Conservative Opposition voted against a National Health Service Bill in fa February 1946. The birth of the National Health Service was also the birth of the Conservative opposition to a free health service. hear hear The only difference between then and now is that in 1946 the Conservatives were more honest. Now they hide their intentions regarding the Health Service behind the word reform. Reform of the Health Service has been rejected by the British people. Every poll, every questionnaire, has proved this. In a recent questionnaire on a Hospital Trust in , ninety percent of the medical staff, the medical staff, voted against the implementation of a Trust. Conservative Ministers have explained this by saying that the questions are loaded. However, the newspaper asked a simple straight-forward question, are you in favour of a self-governing Trust? The response was three to one against. The Government know what the people want. They are choosing to ignore it, just as they did with the poll tax. hear hear The public's lack of confidence in the National Health Service is in direct proportion to their lack of confidence in the Government's promises. They know that yet another public asset is about to be hived off, with more promises of greater efficiency and better public service. The same things that were promised for the gas, electricity and water, but in rel reality the only section to gain are the fat cats at the top who have recently been given it's obscene pay increases. hear hear Talking of benefits, the benefits said to accrue from a Trust can be achieved under the present arrangements. Those are not my words, those are the words of Mister , who made a presentation to Social Services on behalf of the Trust. In his view it would not happen as easily or as quickly but the key point is, it could happen while maintaining the status quo. When Mister presented a case for the Trust, the main point of the proposal seemed to be that the application is only being made to prevent being swallowed by the or Trust. He freely admitted that if the present Government continued, would be completely swallowed up by 1993. At a time when is moving nearer to empowering the people and devolving decisions, the implementation of a self-governing Trust is moving policy in the opposite direction. It's putting a power into the hands of faceless Directors, picked by the Government, just as they pick their friends to head up the privatised National Industries. Councillor has been very vocal about a select committee. He has said there is no need and his group is against the proposal. Well we would expect his group to be against it. His group are against accountability. His group are against area panels and neighbourhood forums where k people can be heard and their views taken into account. His group are not for listening, they're for telling people. Something else, therefore, it's for selling, especially public assets, and they get two pluses in that. They gain the money but public accountability for those services. Once facilities are transferred to a Trust the ability of local communities to influence decision making virtually disappears. Previously Health Authorities were required to consult over the closure of any facilities. This g this safeguard disappears once the facilities are managed by a Trust. It is that gap that the select committee will fill. We'll not allow these unelected faceless Tory supporters to keep the public in the dark. The select committee will be a focal point for patients, potential patients and their relatives. As I said at the beginning, the National Health Services was born in 1948 through the efforts of the Labour Party, the first comprehensive free health service in the world. For forty three years it has been the jewel in the crown of the Labour Party legislation and for forty three years the Labour Party has defended the National Health Service against all comers. by the British people, we will continue to fight any attempt to send the Health Service the same way as the gas, electric and water. Lord Mayor I so move. Thank you Lord Mayor. I suppose I ought to start by saying, what's up doc? Because I think the first question to ask is, just what is this all about? What is this Trust status all about? Why is it being pursued? What's the reasoning behind it? Now, if we are talking about Community Health Services, let's just examine what those words actually mean. First of all, services, the last word there. Well of course you can make profit from services. The private sector makes a lot of profit from a lot of different services provided, but that's not my idea of what public services are, or should be. And don't forget we're told time and time again, almost ad nauseam, that this is to remain a public service within the National Health Service. So just tell us, how does that fit in? How does it all tie in when you look at the requirements stated in the document to actually make a profit on the provision of health services. now, to make profit on the provision of health services, to some people may seem immoral. To me it seems particularly loathsome and, when you look at the experiences in countries like America where it operates, you'll see that we want no part of it in this country. But the return is required, it's on page twenty seven of the document, and how is it to be achieved? Well, if you look at the document, it refers to the bureaucracy, the elimination of the bureaucracy, and how is it going to be done? Four point nine of the Trust submission, well it's gonna be limit eliminated because the Trust will be accountable to the Secretary of State. Now he's gonna be a very busy man this person, if it is still a man, who's going to make sure that all these Trusts are acting in an accountable way and eliminating all this bureaucracy. If he does it without any help I shall be totally amazed and I think that it's simply a facility to assume that there're gonna be reductions in bureaucracy simply by centralising because the record from the past shows that the reverse is the case. So where else are the savings gonna come from? Well, if you look in the document again, there are some wonderful euphemisms in here, er these changes will be implemented throughout the services, page eight, and it will result in increased flex increased flexibility in staffing arrangements and in the general relationship to their employees. Now, what does that mean to you? I know what it means to me. Jobs down the road, that's what it means to me. Now the next word is health,because I've seen no strong reasoning, no strong convictions, that there's gonna be any advantages in health terms in ter er as opposed to directly managed units. I am worried that some people will see this as a mental health trust and I am very disappointed that the emphasis has been placed there and not on services such as the district nurse service which gets scanty coverage within the document. But lastly I'd like to come to the word community, about which I feel so strongly. One of the advantages so called did not involve the appropriate bodies like Community Health Councils or the Trade Unions. It's conclusions, we're not subject to consultation but we're instead given wide and extensive publicity in a series of elaborate video roadshows, with information cascading down. But no notice was taken of information or opinion cascading up. The changes that're taking place, whether or not hospitals opt out, are changing N H S culture. Managers will no longer concentrate on the provision of good quality care but will in will br but will embroiled in the nightmare of contractual agreements and a preoccupation with costs. In those hospitals that opt out, there will be even more pressure to drive down costs and with it the loss of quality care to potential loss of employment and poor returns and conditions of employment for those still employed in the Trust. The Trust makes no commitment to improve the serious levels of low pay. For years, local managers have hidden behind a national agreement, privately agreeing that pay levels or poor, that they have no influence on the decisions made at national level. The staff are now not convinced that with the freedom now offered to managers to negotiate local pay bargain, that these historic low levels of pay will improve. Instead, it is feared that harmonisation of conditions may level down and not raise up. The Health Trust application has no mandate from the public it serves, nor from the staff it employs. The decision was made by senior managers and Health Authority members, none of whom now have any local accountability. About twenty to twenty five percent of the senior cl clinicians opposed the application and the percentage figure amongst other disciplines will be far higher and, as has been said, the main motivation to seek Trust status, is based upon a financial squeeze on with it's neighbours and also seeking Trust status. For to remain as a directly managed unit would place a question mark on it's future. The self interest of the senior managers has promoted the interest in the Trust application and not to a commitment to provide and maintain high quality care. Reference has been made to planning, that er the five to ten year cycle has er proved inadequate. That hasn't been because er Authorities recently have been unable to assess medical and clinical needs, but through a lack of resources. In future I believe that planning will be worse because there'll be no sort of overview, and that it will lead to an over provision of the profitable services and inadequate provision of services like mental illness, the elderly and those with learning difficulties. And the Trade Unions don't regard the N H S as a an employment exchange, but what we do expect is consultation and involvement in those changes. And what we do oppose, what we do oppose, is not inefficiency, but what we do want is quality care. In the recent experience of private contracts in the Health Service is no doesn't foretell of any great quality in the future. And itself has been a victim of that poor quality when private contracts were employed in the domestic service. So I suppose that really to say that we're not er involved in that we're not against efficiency. Choice will be limited in the future, as opposed to being better for the patients, since contractual agreements will be dictated by the purchasers and by the G P fund holders. There's no greater choice for the patients there. Just to conclude, I share the view expressed already by Councillor , that just as the issue of the elderly persons homes brought about the loss of control for the Conservatives in , be sure the Health Service will bring about the downfall of the Conservatives in White Hall. Thank you. Lord Mayor fifteen B I move the vote now be put. hear hear Seconded carried forty nine thirty six. We'll now proceed to vote on the on the two motions. Remember that while we debated them both together, the vote will be taken as separate items. Equally, I want to remind those who have declared an interest, that they should not vote. The first vote is on item eight Community Health N H S Trust. Will those who are in favour of amendment B moved by Councillor please show Those against. Well, it's obviously a lot more, so I declare it . Will those in favour of amendment A moved by Councillor please show. Those against. I think it can be safely said that that's lost. Those in favour of the substantive motion please show. Forty seven Those against Thirty, thirty two yes That is carried. Forty seven votes, thirty two against. We now move to item nine which is the Health Service application to become a National Health Service Trust. Those in favour of the substantive motion please show. Yes Ok Those against. thirty two That is also carried. Forty seven votes, thirty two against. My Lord Mayor, can I just point out, I didn't see Councillor hand going in the air. He's got an interest. he's disclosed an interest He's disclosed an interest N item ten on the agenda, building a better . I call upon Councillor to move the recommendation of the policy and resources committee. I so move my Lord Mayor Seconded my Lord Mayor I call upon Councillor to move amendment C standing in his name. Lord Mayor Seconded? Ah, the poison chalice. What sweet draft. Fourteen months ago we were told by all and sundry, particularly the media that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to recover from the despair and the destruction of the era and yet, here we sit today, with a Labour majority of sixteen, the biggest Labour majority since this Council was formed. What a complete condemnation of the Thatcherite policies that were attempted to be brought in by the controlling group opposite. We have turned this Council round, reflecting as closely as possible the values that the community expressed in the local elections of May 1990 and May 1991. The five themes that we've adopted in building a better will build on the progress we made in meeting the challenge and making the change. Improving the quality of life. This year will see a visible improvement in the quality of life of people in the district. Providing fairer shares will see the building blocks of the anti-poverty strategy being brought into action. Empowering local communities, that's what really frightens the Tories, because what it means is they'll never be able to come back with those repressive and regressive policies that they brought in two years ago. Creating positive partnership. The private sector breathed a great sigh of relief when the Labour group was returned to power in this city. And supporting the social charter, moving towards 1992, rejecting the negative approach of the Tory Government towards social reform within the community. Members of Council will know that the objective of changing the culture of the Council has gone because we've largely done the job. We've won widespread support both within the Authority and outside, with the voluntary sector, with the private sector and with other agencies, for our approach to regenerating the city. But what of the opposition? Where've they been? What a lame excuse for an opposite. We understand that was de-mob happy for quite some time and erm I know he's been disappointed recently with the Tories losing control of the local Council down down in the happy glades down South but the pink gin and pink knickers approach of Councillor is becoming a joke. There's clearly, there's clearly a no turning back group being formed on the Tory back benches with those Councillors who feel aggrieved after the night of the long knives. The opposition though feels nothing more than a tickle with a feather boa, obviously a pink one. Even officers are sniggering behind their hands as Tory Councillors pass by. One, because they were duped by Councillor and his attempts to further his own ambitions and two, because of the complete lack of direction which they have shown as a group under the leadership of Councillor . That lame approach is mirrored in the amendment that we find before us today. Stopping to personal attacks, my my. Using information with no relevance to , in my Liverpool home. All I seek is to be judged on my record and the record of this group. I will deal with problems to the best of my ability and I ev have every respect for all other leaders who try and do the same, particularly , the leader of . The opposite is so limp that I'm becoming paranoid, I'm developing a twitch, Councillor . I wonder what it could be? It must be the G B H tactics of your parliamentary candidates. Despite Tory attempts , despite Tory attempts to darken the skies over , we have emerged into the sunlight, with building a better we will build a brighter future and I move the recommendation. Councillor Thank you Lord Mayor. I certainly won't be controversial. I will end up on time. So I drink pink gin. I actually drink Tetley's bitter if preferred. What I don't do is pretend to be a socialist, organise five hundred pound a head er ticket dinners as Neil Kinnock does,champagne and then have the gall next day to go to on the nineteenth of July, on the very day when saw what the Labour Group are doing to this city. When Councillor and his Party showed the care and concern they have for our staff, when sixty members of our staff on that day attended a committee meeting of this Council to see the Labour leader open it and shut it without any debate whatsoever and walk out of the room. hear hear Quite shameful and showing what Labour Party has achieved. I think it was a pathetic spectacle and what the papers we have in front of us that the Labour party have prepared doesn't say are their achievements, I am not surprised they have tried to hide. Labour Councillors vote for a hundred and seventy four pound per couple increase in community charge, one of the biggest in the United Kingdom. Labour Councillors charge community charge payers an extra seventeen pound each for those members of the public that they have urged not to pay the community charge. hear hear The obscenity, the obscenity of a Labour Councillor, Councillor in , saying his principles mean he won't pay the community charge, but his principles do not extend to not claiming over fifteen hundred pounds worth of expenses, paid for by those people who are paying the community charge in . Labour Party say they want to tackle crime in and we have, and I hope we will debate later on this agenda, the situation where a Labour Chairman of the Police Complaints Committee turns up a public meeting urging er law- breaking and support for people who are not actually gone to trial an a the circumstances of the events really does not concern us but it's the fact that leaflets are now circularising this city, printed by our old friends, the resource centre, urging people to join the Defence Committee, which is supported by the University Labour Party , is supported by the West Labour Party and is supported by the Police Complaints Committee no less. Now Councillor thinks that it was just an accident and people will understand. People will not understand that. I am shocked. Labour Party have crippled Not a vote already Yes, Councillor , will you keep to the subject under discussion and not involving a lot of personal abuse. Of course I will Lord Mayor. I didn't plan to deviate from it at all for the rest of my speech anyway. Well you have up to now. Not drinking any of my gin Lord Mayor Labour Councillors in have crippled Social Services, have reneged on their promises to the people of when one of the biggest lies we've seen on any political papers in was that they would defend and not close elderly persons homes. Labour Councillors have set up over a hundred new Council Committee meetings, an extra six hundred meetings a year, and the hundreds of thousands of pounds that is gonna cost the people of , not the community charge payers, not the community charge payers, but those people, the elderly and the handicapped who are looking for services from this Authority, which the Labour Group will say, we can't afford to provide cos the Government doesn't send us enough money. And so, Kinnock goes to . I'm glad you brought in the subject of , the leader of the Labour Council er in which means I am not deviating, and saying that Mister and saying that Mister is now running a moderate Council. Last week pickets stopped ambulances taking mentally handicapped to schools in . Last week, adults waiting to go to a school for the adult mentally handicapped were taken there three hundred and fifty and only ten teachers were allowed into the school. At childrens' hall, which was picketed for two days, picketed for two days, by this now happy band of Labour people in Coun c c Councillor I'm responding to the No you are not I am You're now talking on anoth on a subject of the Authority which is nothing whatever to do with us this afternoon. Please come back to the sub matter under discussion. I certainly will Lord Mayor Be impartial sir A o one tends to get confused Lord Mayor. If Councillor wants to go and get a G B H haircut it tends to confuse us on this side of the er as to exactly what we are debating. Councillor says he has turned this Council around. The Labour Group have certainly turned this Council around. They've turned it from a Council that was determined to tackle the social deprivation in this city, was determined to tackle the disadvantaged, such as racial disadvantaged, by supporting the C T C, which gives a unique opportunity to Asian children in this city for education. We are pleased to see that at least the Labour Party now are deciding that they can at last work with the Government. The Government's new City Challenge Initiative, which we are all hoping will be accepted er on behalf of, that they are willing to look at social partnership with firms, although we have reservations about some of their proposals er in that area. Yes, they've turned this city round. Yes, they've turned the people in this district round from the way they were heading. There is now problems on the streets of , there is anger in the outer areas that through your postal code politics people are not getting a fair deal in the outer areas of this city. hear hear And what more, what more should we expect from a Party that is led nationally by a man who, in 1983, says, there are no circumstances in which I would order or permit the firing of a nuclear weapon, which leads somebody to say, Kinnock's lust for power is so great that he's prepared to ditch any principle to get it. And that's not from a Conservative, that's from the present Chairman of C N D, and wasn't a spectacle that was last week. And we have a nuclear basement, before you stop me, what a spectacle that was last week. He hasn't even the decency to announce it public himself. He sends a runner, Kaufman, to announce it. That's guts. That's Labour politics. hear hear Lord Mayor on a standing order A fifteen B I now move the vote now be put. Councillor , my Lord Mayor, in accordance with standing order A seven B and D, I propose to Council that the debate on agenda item eleven, percentage for out policy and agenda item sixteen, notice of motion number nine, people disabilities, be combined with separate votes at the end of the debate and that a provision of the order A eleven J and A fourteen K be amended to limit the number of speakers on the combined debate to three from the controlling group and three from notion parties. I so move, Lord Mayor. Seconded Those in favour. That's clearly agreed. Councillor Councillor to move it I call upon Councillor to move the recommendation So moved Lord Mayor Is there a seconder? Seconded Item, I call upon Councillor to move amendment D standing in her name her name I move Lord Mayor Is there a seconder? Seconded Lord Mayor Item sixteen er people with disabilities. Call upon Councillor to move the motion standing in his name. Is there a seconder? In accordance with standing order A thirteen C, this motion will stand referred to the Policy and Resources Committee for consideration and report unless the Council decide to deal with it at this meeting. What are the Council's wishes? Get it over with at this meeting Lord Mayor Seconded? Those in favour? Clearly carried. I am going to call upon Councillor to move. Mhm? Well, Councillor I waive my right to speak to Council members. Ok. Councillor ? Hello. Lord Mayor, people with disabilities detest being patronised. They also detest being called the handicapped. hear hear What is more, we hate being used as political footballs by cynical politicians. It's the ultimate insult when that politician belongs to a political party that throughout twelve years of Government has washed his hands of any responsibility for the rights and aspirations of people with disabilities. Lord Mayor, I really do not have the time to speculate in detail why Councillor has made this mistake. One should say, however, in fairness to him, that he's quite a shrewd politician, for a Tory that is. After all, when the waves of Thatcherism threatened to roll up the M one and drown Local Government in We stayed in that house till I were eight year old and then we were went on to where I lived the rest of my time and that would have been from nineteen twenty to oh a couple of year ago. What was it like on Wyre then was it very different? Oh entirely different from now. The pier and the hydro and the telephone made a big difference to it. But erm other eighteen inches or two foot to a jetty to land it. All the feeding stuff and there were a pile of feeding stuff then for the hens were all and cattle were fed and all the feeding stuff had to be imported. And sometimes it landed in a gay sorry mess and it really wouldn't there just a couple of feet a couple of stones high just the height of the jetty. And we've had many a soaking landing the stuff. Steamer sometimes anchored off and sometimes it didn't anchor there was too much wind I guess the anchor didn't hold too well when it was a rough day. How often did you get the steamer? Oh it varied from time to time. In the winter time they'd come out on a Monday morning and came back on Tuesday from Kirkwall. And then the summer time they come out on a Monday morning and gone back at on Monday night. That was the the first one I can remember. The shipping company supplied the boat for bringing the goods ashore. There's usually a old salmon coble they'd pick up from down the coast somewhere. Very flat on the bottom and turned up to the bow and that's what the salmon fishers used in the in the rivers for pulling their nets in and fishing salmon on the . Why choose one of the was it cos they were suitable or cheaper? Well they were suitable and cheaper they were too blooming cheap for the they were usually condemned by the time we got them. They lashed alongside and they lowered the stuff right onto the onto the coble To start with we rowed it ashore with a couple or oars or maybe four oars and took off the cattle and that the same way just. Or they put a sling round them or made a canvass and two supports on the side of it and the sling to be too hard on the cattle's sides. Like a sort of hammock . And er put that on and tied them back and front and up on them tied them to the sides of the coble and and usually towed it with another rowing boat. It was all done by oars then. Were the cattle and all ? Oh they were not too bad for that we never had any real disaster . Just had one jumped over the side from us once and swamp ashore again and we caught it on the on the land again and put it away. I'm having to swim them off the steamer and tow them in a dinghy to get our put the slings on them before we left the beach and just pushed them into the water and towed them off and hook the hook the into the sling and up them to give them a good wash before they went to Kirkwall. It's funny how an animal like a cow or a horse would swim you would think it would be Well they can they can swim like fish. For I remember us doing a flipping er a family came to Wyre once and we were on the same old coble we were er doing the flipping and we thought we had nothing to do but take the rope off their heads and push them over the side of the coble onto the side of the small jetty. And instead of going up the jetty they went down and they were going to go right back to Rousay again. And another instance of that was well this was not so long ago when we had a loan of a barge from just a mini landing craft sort of thing where the front of it folded down. So I flipped some cattle from the farm of and right between Egilsay and Rousay just a short distance, oh maybe a quarter of a miles or thereby, and oh did the shipping perfectly well and and went home and by the time I got home the message had arrived back before me that the there were two old cattle among the younger ones that the fellow had put there just to feed up and the last we saw of them was going up over the island and that was okay we thought everything was okay. So the message was that the two old cattle was back in Rousay. They swam that strong current you know and landed back on Rousay again. Just imagine it. You'd think it would be totally alien for them to go in the water like that. I know. But they will do it. Were the cattle in Rousay and Wyre and Egilsay were they used to that kind of thing? Oh no really no. Well you see Egilsay and Rousay had piers that they could land at and they were never used to be in the water. But I've seen in my time coble to ship cattle with to swim them off. At it was on a nice day it was all right. I suppose when they got in the water they enjoyed the dip. What about other animals? Sheep can be very sort of skittish and excitable . Oh oh oh yes. There's sometimes there's a job to handle them. I've seen them taken to the sea too and er have a job to round them up. And the horses well they they're the worst to ship some were really bad and they had to be severely tied. Some use to keep pigs too but not very many in Wyre. We had a job to handle them. The screams on them more than enough. What happened in in the depth of winter when it was really bad and stormy as far as supplies and things went? Oh it could be stormy right enough but well the steamer might call at Rousay at that time and they would land the goods in Rousay the perishables for Wyre and when the weather abated we would get it from there. It was just about a half a mile of water to cross. What happened with perishables because you said there was no power no electricity no fridges no freezers nothing . Nothing no I've seen the bread coming out on a Monday morning warm and landed at from the big houses and that was before the days of the cooling of the bread. They have coolers now to take the steam away from them. And the boxes would even be warm when they landed at Wyre down in the hold of the steamer. But the bread soon turned green in this time of year and there was quite a lot of penicillin about hence.. Did folks still have girdles then or was that going out? Oh yes I guess they'd girdles Oh I suppose when the hens failed the girdles were possibly thrown out. But the hens when was the hurricane there about finished them. about at their height about the hurricane time and was it fifty one I think. What was it like? Oh terrible. I thought I would never seen the next day. The stacks were just simply not there. It just lifted the roofing from the base of the stack and hen houses just scattered all over the place. Just hens laying here there and everywhere. I remember me gathering the hens up that night late oh about ten or eleven o'clock at night and we had our own power you see by that time. Just our own lighting plant and the hens would even come out and meet you in the dark they knew knew you were coming. And they'd come along cattle there just contented as could be and then they got their supper and we'd give them a wee while of light still to eat their supper. And the first was a twelve volt but then we came to a hundred and ten so I just strung it down along the two top wires of the fence and they were live and oh there were about six or nine hen houses attached to the fence with those wires for electricity. But the next morning there was nothing left. On this night you said you'd gone up to feed them? Yes. Oh well I gave them and went home and went to bed. And the wind got up in the night and pretty strong and we had a hut a twenty by twenty five foot fourteen eighteen war hut in the middle of a square and there was a shop and a storeroom besides. And there was nothing left but the base of that. Whole thing just went like a matchbox. And I got up and I was gonna tie her up like but and by gosh I thought I'd better make for the door again. And there was a lot of space between the hut and the door and the wind took me and flung me right up against the tank and I went down to the ground and crawled on me hands and knees. I didn't go out again. I remember before that the wind changed pretty suddenly from southwest to nearer west I think and I'd made a new hen house I thought indestructible. And we had sixty pullets at the point of lay in this house to be moved out from the house to a field. And we were standing on the end of the house and I thought I had nothing to tie that down with but there were concrete blocks there I had a pile of those in the corner and well it took the whole blooming thing. And minced the hens up with the blocks. Oh it was terrible. And it let an old house alongside with nothing in it and hardly a door on it and that stood right alongside of that one and it must have been like a comb it just must have gone in strips the gale for that house was now twelve foot away from the other one. And why did that one stand and the blocks in in this one and the hens and everything. So that was disaster. Were you married then? Mhm mhm. Did you have a young family as well? Yes and we took the whole thing down to the kitchen for the upstairs rooms were just going like this. And when we were down in the kitchen the partition between the butt and the bairn as they called it was going like that inside of the house in the gale. And it ripped about a quarter of the roof off before it finished and the slates but er still good. Oh it lifted huge stones you know it wa it was incredible. Were the bairns frightened? Well some of them I suppose slept over it. What? Yes. But I certainly did not. And when it daylight came the next day next morning you could hardly believe it you could hardly see Rousay for the foam that the gale kick up like a thick fog. The had risen in the air and I never want to see the like again. It must have done an awful lot of damage everywhere else too. Oh it did that all right. And some of that hen houses blew right on the sea. Not our our owns but erm other people and they could see them the next day when the steamers went to the north isles for the er the cockerels or the hens sitting on the top of them. And they could do nothing to save them. Did the steamers go the next day? Well yeah the wind fell but I'm not really sure whether they went the next day or the day after that I can't remember. Oh it took some sorting out on the next morning. And you see all the crop had vanished over the night. And they had to import hay and straw and goodness knows what. Did the Council have to set up some sort of emergency system? Er yes I think they did but er we reckoned we lost about eight hundred and fifty pounds worth of gear. fifty or sixty pound worth of that but which was nothing. Were folk insured for that kind of thing then or Well no really some of them were not. What about livestock would they have been in at that time of year? Oh yes. Oh some of the roofs sort of and that were peeled off no bother. Was there any loss of life? No funny to say. Had it been in the day time I'm sure there would have been lives lost for they wouldn't have stayed in to seen their stuff go under. Going for the wind. Thing about boats you know you were speaking about the steamer coming back and forth to Wyre, but what kind of a boat service was there local boat service. Cos if the steamer only came once a week that wouldn't have been enough. Oh that was about the lot er we had. If you wanted to go to Kirkwall you had to cross to the Rousay pier and then either hire a car or walk to and get across with Tom . Erm that was in the early days Charley and Tom did the crossing there for the mails and early in nineteen fifty one no fifty five that we took over the mails. And we before that we made quite a few runs to Kirkwall with a that was a small one that we had and erm you had to get the bus from Evie of course to Kirkwall and back the same way. Back along with the back to what you would call the sea crossing er to and get on to the Rousay pier then and get a dinghy or something and row across to Wyre. Did you start doing a passenger service when you got the mail contract or did you to the mail just on its own first or did you No we did we did passengers before the mails. We used to run direct to Kirkwall via and erm it was then that the post office caught hold of us and wanted us to take on the mails. So How did you work that was it er sort of round like Egilsay or did you No no the first mail run we had was just merely from to Rousay to collect the Rousay mails and dump them at the Rousay pier and they were sorted in Rousay for Egilsay and Wyre besides that. And as we were coming home from Rousay pier we met the Wyre post boat coming across for the mails that we already had dumped in Rousay. And Egilsay crossed to the school just there yes . Er they crossed there to for the mails for years and years. And You said you met the Wyre post boat coming back so you didn't As we went back to Wyre home to Wyre we could meet the Wyre post boat coming across for the mails that we put to Rousay. They had to go and collect the mails. Well you see they had the mail er contract on Wyre long before we start. But it finally ended up that we had the whole thing Rousay Egilsay and Wyre. So did you do a passenger service direct to Kirkwall calling at Egilsay and Rousay? Er yes just er no really a service it was more hires than anything else. Just er for the business. Oh so that so the passenger service it it wasn't actually a a daily passenger service like it is now then? Oh no no no. Well we went every day on about the mail so it was a passenger service that really started off in nineteen fifty five but we bought maybe in nineteen fifty three or fifty four. We had to run direct to Kirkwall quite a lot then. When did the bus service start to then? Oh it was a while after we start. Actually it not that long ago. But a few years now. Well what did folk do when they got to then? Oh well Bob had a mini bus that he went with and picked up the passengers. And of course he died and I think There was no bus then? No. They only thing they could do was to go walk up to walk up a road to and contact the Evie bus but it didn't come down along for years and years. And then er Tom retired and he used to run the bus long after we start the mails and then he retired and er the bus service to come down along and pick up the passengers and that was how it start. There was Tom running a passenger service at the same time as you were doing the mail? Mhm and he lost the mails in nineteen fifty five. He packed up the mails and er tackled the to have a go. And we were not too keen on it at that time but had been all right. So are there two boats going every day then? Well yes there would nearly two going every day indeed. Did you take supplies and things as well then? Mhm. I took our tin of bread across for donkey's years. What happened in the days before freezers I mean well like going back to this you know when folk didn't have power. Things wouldn't have kept what you would have had a totally different kind of eating habits? Well I suppose more salted meat I mean more home home butching and erm making bread I suppose or the womenfolk were likely baking every day. It must be totally different now I I know that in places like Hoy that just used the freezers all the time. yes mhm. Even with our daily transport Mhm. Oh yes we yeah we use a freezer too. We took in and for and still use it. I thought plenty believe in fresh meat and that. I suppose fresh meat is better but you're only suppose to keep a certain time anyway even in the freezer. What about fishing? When you were younger in Wyre, how did folk make a living? Oh plenty of porridge and milk and er oh there was no much money to be made I mean and there was a lot bigger population then than what it is now. You said about the hens making a lot, how did how did they work that as an industry with the eggs and things how did they collect and work? We had a oh nearly a dozen cases of eggs dozen sometimes for some farms. And it was a big business and tons of feeding stuff. For every ton of feeding stuff then there maybe a hundredweight now coming ashore. It was What happened? Well imported eggs I suppose. Irish eggs and goodness knows whatnot. Oh and there's factory farming this er big business. I guess it flawed the lot of it. You could always tell a deep litter egg. Oh absolutely. It stank and it was dark orange. Yes. You could tell a broiler what they call them er fowls. That was absolutely white compared with a fully range fowl. I mean that's the meat. Oh that's just no so good. There must have been a big business even when the deep litter started cos I can remember the farm next door to us working a deep litter. Mhm. And they had hundreds and hundreds of hens in deep litter and they seemed to be making a lot of money out of it. Oh they would yes. Oh they and I guess it set a few farmers on his feet. But it didn't last. What happened with the egg packing station? Oh well it just packed up you know no eggs and that was that. There were two packing stations at one time. One down at here and er where was the other one or the down the road here. That was a fairly big one and I think there may have been one at Stromness too. Oh it had washing machines and goodness knows whatnot auto What's automatic feeders and such likes. What sort of prices did folk get for eggs then? Oh I can't remember that. Mm. Was it the the women's business really? Well up to a point indeed but er the men would er help out I doubt. I always seem to recall the women up to their elbows in freezing cold water washing. Washing eggs? Mhm. Oh yes. And plenty got this egg wash you see. And just filled a net basket of eggs and put it down in the in the water and the water flowed through it kind of. Possibly possibly with a pump I don't know. But it would be better if it did not need washing. The egg was actually the eggs would keep better washed. Oh why's that then? Well I think it broke the seal in the wash and er which was good get them as they were laid they were okay. Keep the nests clean but that was no good to do either so. Sometimes the hens would start eating them and break the eggs oh what a mess. When they changed the deep litter did it erm I've heard folks say that it actually affected the hens that they that they went cannibal and Oh yes oh they would do that all right. They started pecking one another and it was a job to get them stopped. Yes it's funny to think of hens having feelings but I suppose being cooped up like that it did affect them. Oh aye it must have done mhm. See they got on the lights so long of the day in the winter time and made them lay just like as if it'd been summer. Well that was the idea of the Mhm. deep litter. Mhm mhm. Old one old ones just used which was at the bulb in every hen house and it was free range and I think there was nothing better than that. And they would lay just when and collect them eggs that night afore the gale. It was I just heard about Now I'm ha I'm handing round a summary of last week's lecture, which I hope will make more sense of it, and I have here, if anybody wants to borrow it, a Xerox of chapter three in Dorkins' book where he explains the Blind Watchmaker, and the manual for the disk. Now for copyright reasons, if you want to do the Blind Watchmaker, and I'd very much like you to, you've gotta borrow the disk from me, okay? So if you want it, my advice is take the Xerox or read the book. When you've read it come and ask me for the disk and I'll lend it to you. Erm, I've also got a rather smaller number of copies of ev Evolvematic notes if you wanna do Evolvematic, which I also demonstrated briefly. So if you wanna do Evolvematic I've got the notes for that Ya, explained in the handout that's coming round, okay? Thanks very much. So everybody got a handout did they? Right. I've also got more copies of the reading list which I've forgotten to bring with me but which I have got er upstairs and they're pinned to my door, if anybody needs another reading list, okay? But I forgot to bring those with me. Erm, let me remind you that at twelve o'clock today er I've booked S O one eight. Who's coming to S O one eight? Erm, for fun, you have a story and you're allowed to play Alright then. Er, I'll tell you a story and I'll let you play a game. S O one eight. Okay, that's at twelve o'clock. Now what I want to do. Let me just explain, if you can't make it, or if you don't want to do it, I will er re-do it all again in the lecture next Friday at eleven. Next Friday at eleven I will go over it up with Polyfilla! Erm, we did tell him that obviously he'd That might help Yes! He also fitted it at the top end of the door. Now, if you've got nowhere else, erm, at the bottom end of the door to fit it, that's fine, but as a matter of a preference, Crime Prevention like to see them fitted a third of the way up the door, that is where our thieves put the boot in, and thieves will work to pressure points, to leverage points they come equipped, or most of them don't come equipped, because obviously if they're walking along the street and a police officer sees them, you know, pull them over and start to talk to them, most of them will actually er use the tools from the back garden or or things they find lying around to help themselves in. Now that's all very well having one of those, if you've got a nice solid wood door to fit it to, but if you're looking at the new replacement P V C doors erm, afterwards you can't fit that type of lock because the actual structure of the door won't take it. So how do you secure up one of those doors? Any of you got that problem? Yes. Well well actual fact, unless it's done, the security's fitted at the time of manufacture you can actually serious damage the framing. And I wouldn't suggest you, you tamper with it, er, because if you do damage the framework of it you've got no redress from the company. Some aluminium doors will take extra security device. But that is where you need to get a a specialist locksmith in to actually assess the framing of the door. Cos on the new P V C doors, most of the security is down one side, you've got what I call multi-locking surface. Some of you, you might have seen them, where you've got a number of bolts that shoot into the top from the side of the frame and the whole thing operates at the turn of a key. It's very good if that, that's in place, but you have to also make sure that the, the screws on the hinge side are fitted correctly as well. Cos I had an occasion where I had a, a replacement door it was my own house and they ripped off half the screws. And if you think of a the main fabric of them, they're quite flimsy. And there have been occasions now where our local police, certainly, and that er frees areas and just knock the back of the . So, do choose very carefully if you're thinking of having replacement glazing and doors. Every house has weak areas you can probably identify them yourselves, and so can burglars. If I was gonna break into a into, you know, my house how would I do it? And there are obvious points to watch isn't there? The back and the sides for instance. Burglars like to work unseen and unheard. They like the coverage of foliage to, to work at night. As I say, they will use the things that are in your back garden. So security extends not only from, the home, but onto the garden shed as well. If you've got a flat roof for instance, if you've got sun loungers in the side, well you just stack those up to the level of, levels of your . And one of the most common entrances into houses is by a small fan light window. As soon as they can get their head and shoulders through, they're in!double glazing conservatories is one of the best deterrents. . Security is like a game of chess, and our thieves are sort of like one move ahead of us, or vice-versa as the case might be. The window locks, which there are many, many different types to choose from are now not the deterrent they were. And if you have, are sort of screwed on and they're put underneath erm, until you sort of,type locks cos anything else . But how do you be really , how do you not scare yourselves from going out?gonna return to your homes and that everything's going to be left as it was? It's a question of having to deal with the truth. Making it as difficult as possible for them to come in by setting up barriers doing things, perhaps a at night, putting like some timer switches in the rooms that you're likely to be sitting in. You'd be surprised the number of people that will leave, still, just the one singular light in the hallway. Nobody sits in their for eight hours of an evening! So put it i , put a light on in a room that you will actually be in. Adjust the curtains. You cannot odds against the free newspapers coming through your doors, they're a pain to all of us! But we as crime prevention officers regularly meet with erm the newspaper people to say can you make sure your staff push them through the letter boxes and they assure us that the er, the next thing on their list to prioritize but it doesn't happen. And you must have gone through in your own neighbourhood where you see papers sticking out of letter bo boxes, milk left on the front door step. They are the tell-tale signs that the someone is not in. An extension of that is good neighbourhood. Are any of you involved in Neighbourhood Watch? Mm. Yes Offer that to you, do you think they neighbourhood work, watch works? Er before, before they set it up really. Yes. You might get the o , the odd one or two that are always looking out their windows and lo , they would do that in any case. No I, I don't really se That's a good idea I don't necessarily think it does. I, inadvertently went out of the house to go to , shut the door and realized I'd left my cars in the house. The only window open was at the back , so I had to break into my own house through there, I managed it. And, full expecting at any time perhaps to hear the er siren, sort of police car, but there wasn't any. No. Erm alright perhaps somebody said, you know, what's going on there, I wouldn't be surprised Cos you were Yeah. But I I'm I was rather disappointed that nothing had happened. Unfortunately Neighbourhood Watch is only as good what people Yeah. doing about it. Erm, that is joint effort, not only with yourselves, but for the police as well. And when you've got a good Neighbourhood Watch this is so, and you'll find that they are very efficient. We've had some good successes with them. It's also, depending on how much information you get because it should be a two way er communication. Most Neighbourhood Watches should supply regular news letters and information via local beat officers. And if that doesn't happen in your watches then that's something that needs to be addressed. Er, on an average here we sent out a newsletter once every month and we have things called a crime line which is an answerphone service updated every week with all of our crimes on it. So people have rung in on this direct line to find out what's going on and things appertaining that could be useful to them. And we found that it's starting to erm pay dividends. But it took us a long time to actually get to that stage because er, the police are at fault, the police launch these schemes and they go away and say get on with it and off we go And no follow up. no follow up. And it's a fault that we recognized. So if I can just break it down. The best deterrent against house burglaries at the moment is an alarm system. But actually, even with an alarm system you must have gone through where you've heard alarms ringing all day and nobody's been . Er if it's at night time it annoys you, cos if all ring your neighbours they're not gonna be so friendly if your alarm's ringing forever and a day and you know, it's disturbing your sleep. It's important if you consider having an alarm you cultivate your neighbours. You don't have to tell them your business, but what you do have to say is, I've got an alarm system, an audible system, so bells only, if you hear it going off can you ring the home station? It might be a bit more than that and can actually scare off. If you don't tell anybody nobody's going to react to that until it starts to annoy them, because most people think that everybody else is going to do something about it. It's like the car alarm, isn't it? You hear them going off. The only time we really react to them is when, perhaps, it's on our car we don't them to disturb anybody and you're trying to fumble about with your keys and switch the thing off. If you've got an alarm which is faulty and repeatedly goes off then, nine times out of ten, you ought to switch the thing off in the first place. And I think there was a local radio article er a couple of days ago that said that car alarms do not work any more house alarms do providing you've got good neighbours to respond to it. The prices of alarms, as well, you'd be quite surprised they do not range from a thousand. It might cost you a thousand pounds if you live in a a huge detached house and in the back of building you've got lots of rooms. But the average of hou , price for a house alarm ranging from about two hundred and seventy five pounds. Now if you had to have all the locks changed in your house, that probably come out on an even . A true locksmith is quite expensive. But, the responsibility for your own house is down to you. It's something that not a lot of people take notice of, as I say, until they become a victim of it. Or it might be your neighbours have become victims of crime and you suddenly see it could happen to you. Yeah, sorry I was going to ah er do, do you find that er the criminals are not taking notice of alarms off now because they know that people will be House alarms or car alarms? Er, house alarms. A , the house alarms I mean a I think thought initially that maybe maybe alarms, okay you can come and go, but erm Yeah. Most thieves are not in that league. They would rather go and burgle a house that isn't alarmed, erm because they don't know what type of alarm you've got there. Mm. Yes they can erm, distinguish between what I call a do-it-yourself alarms and th the recognized companies. Yeah. But at the end of the day they aren't in that league cos most thieves are opportunists they seize a common opportunity that is presented to them by or it could be they've actually just watched her go out and more of a chance . But if they set it off without, without noticing that you've gone like . They are That's likely to be, they're not gonna go, they're gonna, say the people next door, they're not gonna take any notice of it. No. Most Not most of the time That's right. Most of the time actually, if they do set them off, they scarper. They don't want to be around. Erm they don't want to draw attention to themselves. There are many different ways that they operate. I mean, one of the commonest things we have in this area is with the bogus officials who pretend to be something they're not. And none of us like to thing we've been conned. It happens so easily. You know, the water board er er it's all the same ones that we hear on th on the television, and it still happens! They still get away with it. Now, the classic example is from water boards, they'll have two people and they'll say, can we test your water pressure please? One will stay with you all the time watching what he's doing and the other one goes upstairs , while he's left alone, and in that short space of time they can actually . And . They nab easily saleable items that they can push out through boot sales, that type of thing, where they can really make the money. So how can you, what can you do to protect your ? Any ideas? Well I I think one of the greatest deterrents that one can have is the copper on the beat. You never see Yes. one! No. I think we're talking about We never see our own homes. Well But we It is a deterrent really. Well I know but I'm talking about, with break ins, I mean, people are a a I think are getting on with it and there's no deterrent for the A lone beat officer, as you call it, I think it has erm a cosmetic effect to be honest with you. Oh I think it does! Erm people tend to relate back er and think that in theory it's a nice welfare thing, and it's nice for the community, and they do sterling work, don't get me wrong, because I think they are a vital part of a community but, how much of a deterrent they are er, we are, we are unable to measure. And i it's not where, you've got the case where beat officers before erm, used to be able to clip erm people round the ear and things like that, they're not allowed to do that now, those days have long gone. But I, I think And erm there's a psychological as aspect in some so much that if they think that a policeman is gonna walk round the corner er, they're not so keen on doing it. Yeah. Well But I mean, we we've got a situation where we are, I mean, our estate's quiet, very quiet and and, you know, you get the impression that, you know, they can do it without fear or favour, you know,th they know that no one 's going to disturb them it's very quiet there Mm. and we we've always thought that, you know, to have a beat officer that was going around that could perhaps turn up at any time, would at least be some deterrent in so much that Yeah. the people think that they can do it undisturbed. Okay. They do, and that's what they, I mean, but they could also wait until he went round that corner and then go and burgle a house. Right. That's the other thing, they'd quite often would work to what we call But I mean,su surely that that's better than none at all? It is. Unfortunately, and it, perhaps it's the wrong choice of words, but beat officers are in actual fact, a luxury at the moment because if you call the police Yeah. you want a police to come as soon as possible, and you want to, to deal with it because it's a priority to you. Now police forces have to grade their to to things, we get the immediate response, the nine nine nine calls, and then so on. Where beat officers come into play is where you've got the non-urgent, what we call, the traffic, the non-urgent jobs, erm, where people can afford, maybe a couple of hours, it might be that they have to wait until the beat officer gets on duty could be a day or so's time and they they do do an awful lot of work, and it's an ongoing thing. Erm if you just liken it, I mean I was a beat officer here for eight years and the sorts of things that you'd come on duty erm to see, are you may, you might get the nutty woman, who who er, you reoccur and you have to go and see her and you ge , erm, but all the shift members can then pass that to the beat officer. It might be the domestic disputes. I, I take what yo you say because I I'm in favour of beat officers, but Yeah. most people want a quick response, so they would want then, the police officers in the cars that can get there within half an hour, at the latest to deal with their parti , particular problem. And as I say, it's it's not measurable to find out how much of a deterrent they are. I mean, they don't just sort of walk there, they have school visits and things like that to do, as well. So they are in touch with their community and they do for the most part, know what's going on, on their beat. But I mean, we have got nine beat officers for the whole of the Harlow Town area and just th , this area this is the start of what we call our beat eight this is the boundary along Southern Way, and that goes down as far are familiar with the area of Staple Tye most of you? It's quite a distance. All this side of the road is one officer's area that they have to cover on foot. See we we have an awful lot of problems, I mean, not only the question of breaking into one's home things like, car parking or things of a very high accident risk whereas, if we had a beat officer, at least we could set up some sort of local liaison, in so much that we could tell him about our sort of problems, and perhaps between us, resolve them. But we haven't yet But have you found out , have you got a beat officer? No. I've never seen one. But have you found out whether you've actually got one? They reckon there's supposed to be one allocated, but no one 's ever seen him. Why don't you ask to speak to him? We'll have to. Mm. We'll have to. See, it also takes members of the public to phone in. Yeah. People are quite often scared and think they don't want to bother the police we are human beings, we only bite on Thursdays, we're regularly fed and watered erm but, at the end of the day we But, there i there is a general consensus of opinion that if a, a policeman a happens to venture onto our estate, the instant reaction is, quick! Get a camera! Yeah. I mean I'd be a very rich woman And it's a general , it's a general consensus That's right. of opinion It is. unfortunately, nearly everybody says exactly the same. And we all believe each and every one of us, that if there was a, a much er, stronger police presence,i if I mean, a bobby Yeah. it would help a great deal. At least it would give us some sort of contact. We have got a ludicrous situation in our estate because it is very quiet. Whereabouts do you live? Up at Shenfield Right. Where, unfortunately, ladies er, won't go out of a night time because they're frightened whereas, we're looking for a little bit of a reassurance. Someone we can speak to, you know. True, I take your point, I mean I, perhaps I could dig a little bit deeper and find out what the Dickens is going on, you know! But we never ever se , we never ever see a policeman. But that also is the case, I mean er er, a lot of time th the actual design of our houses doesn't lend itself for us to actually look even if you're you're permanently looking out the window. I mean I can , have to say It's true. Our our our living quarters are on the back At the back. Yeah. That's right, so you wouldn't see anyone. Our bedroom's are on the front. You know. So Neighbourhood Watch really goes out the picture. The only thing that we do, and we've always done it without Neighbourhood Watch, we always make a point of telling one another when we're gonna be away for any period of time. That's just an extension from that, although it is basically neighbourhood watch Oh yes! Same sort of thing really. isn't it? Same sort o , but it is difficult when you're allied to a neighbourhood watch, when the living quarters are on the rear of the the accommodation. That's right. And it, it is, and We can't see what's going on there. because be being separate from all of you, and to make sure that your you know, because your problems are gonna be your neighbours problems. Yeah. Let's face it, we're quite selfish in the fact that we want to ensure that the area that we live in is safe for us and not too concerned that three or four estates down the road unless it starts to affect us . We don't want the problems on our own doorstep cos when the chips are down, we like to go home, and we like to feel safe and if somebody's entered your premises as an intruder then all of a sudden your security been taken away. It takes an awful long time for you to regain that and to feel safe in your own homes. Mm. So, if you do nothing else today, I'd like you to go home and assess the risk areas on your own individual houses. And have you actually ? If you haven't, then, you ought to phone your local beat officer and get him to come along and give you a survey I , I, I have phoned the police on numerous occasions and I must say, there isn't a great deal of response. Will, oh, it's all the response I get, we're far too busy we haven't got the manpower you know, er Well eventually they will have. a and this, this happens, you know. And that's the time to tackle it. I mean, I could come up I've even, I've even with the same excuse as that. I even sat on the local erm committee wi with the police authority, you know, and er we've got all sorts of promises but nothing that has ever materialized. When we query it, lack of manpower, lack of resources, lack of money. Well, we've got more police officers now than we've ever had before, we're not gonna get any more because, I mean, Essex Police Force, is quite a a rich one but I think, sort of, on recruitment, they've alre , probably due to get about fifty extra officers but that's . Which doesn't sound a lot from, er such a rural county, erm, but I mean, you know, obviously erm that is quite a lot, in terms because you are the people that are having to pay for it. Yeah. Do you think perhaps the problem is that, through no fault of their own, they spend far too much time in the police station doing other work perhaps, than going out on the beat? They're trying to cut that down, I mean, we have now, what is called, station officer's assistants and most police forces have them where they're civilian employees who do certain jobs to relieve the P C so that he can go back out onto the streets. Yeah. Compiling reports and goodness knows what else! Unfortunately , every thing you do in police force has got to be Gotta have reported. Yeah. And, that, it hasn't changed, in a very long while. Well I mean I'm er that wasn't meant as a criticism No. that was meant as, as a bit sympathy if you like, you know th But erm yeah sort of, the things that they have to do apart from fighting crime! Yes, but then Then I mean, you know there are things that we need to address in-house, to make sure that we give you er, an efficient service. And, like you say, if you're not Yeah. getting the response, if you're getting that type of excuse that comes out, then that's when you need to go back to them and say, well hang on, this is not good enough! I want a response! Alright, I'm prepared to wait depending you won't wait on a, a nine nine nine call, if it is Mm. an urgent call because that's got to take priority erm, but for other responses, then follow it up, don't just Yeah. accept it. Well I, I, as I say, I did follow it up and in fact, I even went to a committee where I sat and spoke to the er the police face to face and they made all sorts of promises but nothing materialized. Oh well, you'll have to stake it out again. Now I did bring a film along for you see and I'm hoping that it's going to work. But it just highlights some of the points erm it is humorous, so I hope that you enjoy it. And, it just shows you how easy it is to leave signs for the thief to tell him that we're out. This is where the technical bit always goes wrong even when Now is that done, that's tuned it right? Yeah. Try channel three. Going to switch it off . It's normally eight. . . That's right. I don't think we should put them through. Course it's a , talking, the only thing I can say, what you're saying about your erm problem in your area that, do you know if there's any crime actually committed on your estate? Is there a lot of crime Oh no! No! We don't get a lot No. really. I think we've, being a target, we've lived in which is since nineteen seventy three, I think we've had about three break ins. So no It's quite small really. which, which goes to show that maybe the officer, er saying maybe, I'm only throwing suggestions over there, cos I don't know Shenfield Yeah. that well, maybe the officer, the local beat officer has got a problem estate that he has to pinpoint and has to be there, or an area where the crime is being committed to try and deal with He's probably up in our estate! that, or, prevent that, whereas he knows that little estate round the corner, I know they look after themselves. Well why, why leave it totally ? Well, I'm probably You know! that's only a suggestion. The only trouble is I'm only saying that but yes, I I I take your point, er, as I say, I'm currently er a neighbourhood beat officer, I'm gonna become the crime prevention officer very shortly but I can go on estates like and they say, I haven't seen you for ages! I said but there's been nothing around here Quite honestly I monitor it Mm. by looking what the crime ra , who's But I I'd around I'd love someone like you to come around so I can come up to you and say this close is, er hello Geoff! You know Well yeah I If you've got a problem we we're . I'm very human , I do , and that's how I And some old dear old lady fell out, off the edge of the kerb That's right! because someone's parking right up the pavement. Over a cu , over a cup of tea, I could get a lot of information from you by saying But there is, there is, there is what's happening and various things. but there is literally no one that we can talk to like that. Yeah. I mean, if we've got problems with, with with house protection, you know. Yeah. But there's no one we can talk to, you know. Yeah. Cos you must have a local of crime prevention officer. There must be one somewhere. Well we have got one but I don't believe I've ever seen him. All you can say is could I make could I make an appointment to see you? And he says leave that to the local station, and say, can you leave a message with him to phone me back please. It doesn't, it doesn't happen. I don't ever, you see I'm I'm erm It doesn't happen like that ! I've I've I've phoned on numerous occasions. I er, I'll give you a classic example, I erm and my wife was with me Aha. for many years and I wheeled her around in a, in a Yeah. chair for that five years and, there were constantly people parking on the pavements, which necessitate you That's right, yeah. once or twice she were nearly no ,ne or the pair of us nearly got knocked down! Anyway, I phoned up the station and I said, you know, I've never seen anybody on the station, is there anybody could come and have a look at this because I'm sure we're gonna have a fatality before long, because, in my case it's my wife, it could be children who are playing there! Oh sure! And they said, well I'm sorry you know, er take the numbers of the cars, they want me to go round and take the numbers of the cars, phone them back and we will see if we've got someone that we can send down there! Well that's not the sort of liaison Well, yeah. that I want! Yeah. That's very poor management I would say, I'd be asking that bloke spoke to? Yeah. But this actually happened! Yeah, I dare say it did. Ah hee. Well yes. That's, that's how well he's talking to I don't think it doesn't look like we've managed to sort to that out so I'll move on. The other way, I mean, we can could actually try and help is to postcode your property I don't know if any of you have done that? But by simple erm, use of an ultra violet pen, using your postcode, followed by the door number or an abbreviation of the house name er,i that makes it identifiable. The postcode is broken down into, obviously figures and numbers, C M's, denotes sort of the Chelmsford area, or for whatever it might be in yo in your area, then you'll come down to either twenty, eighteen, whatever that is. It actually comes down to then, a more local area could be eighteen to twenty into Harlow, and then as you break down into the other figures, that then comes into a road and a postcode will actually go down to about fifteen houses in total, by putting your door number at the end of it, it makes it identifiable to your premises. That is the recognized form of marking for property nationally. All police forces will be able to check erm, if they, sort of find your video in the boot of somebody's car, they'll be able to check if it's marked. All you do, is you mark it on an item if you're gonna do the television do not do the screens, because every time you turn on up will come your postcode. Nor, do the back, because that can be removed you put it on a surface, the side or underneath that cannot be removed, and on a surfaces that's not regularly dusted and polished because eventually it will wear off. The other thing you cannot mark is compact discs Yeah. because they scan on ultra violet light and as one our P C's found out to his cost, he ruined a hundred and fifty pounds worth of compact disc cos he got rather carried away with and of course, it can't be cleaned off! We know that one as well. Okay? So don't mark compact discs. But it is an easy way of making your property identifiable. And as you're doing that make an inventory of sort of, items that have got serial numbers erm, so that if you do lose anything you've got a quick reference there for your insurance company. Most insurance companies now will specify, if you've had a burglary, the types of locks and they are now getting quite hot on it and they want good basic security of homes. So you've gotta go away, think like burglars, and think how easy is it, would it be for me to break into my own home? And if it takes you a matter of seconds, you really need to address your security. Well the er, the about that, when you said mark pieces of property Yeah. ya,, it, it's probably gonna be stolen anyway! The thief doesn't know whether it's been marked, cos usually they take in practise, what could the police be able to do? Well what we do is, if we if we know you've been burgled Aha. we then we, we regularly scout sort of all of the market stalls, the boot Oh. sales and we go over things. If we find property that we're, we're not happy with then all we've got to do is get it under ultra violet because all police forces do that and up will come the post code. Now most people can struggle to know their postcode, but you know might know yours. Mhm. I know your , but er, they ought to and therefore, you know, that is how we trace it. Th the one mark that we can trace. Some property you're not gonna get back. You see, on programmes like Crime Watch U K, where erm they've got these Aladdin's caves on all these stolen items that can never be returned to their owners, it's very, very difficult to sort of mark silverware and things like that without devaluing it? Ultra violet is one of the easiest ways. If it's jewellery it's harder, it will show up, erm if you're marking things like engagements rings, then the best thing to do is actually take photographs of them with a ruler or some sort of erm comparison of the size of the item cos if you do like a a ring on a photograph it's gonna, it's gonna come out like a , so if you got a ruler to say, you know, it's only sort of one and a half inches in width or whatever, then we can actually get a clear picture of, of that. But with that, I have to stress, do not snap away merrily at all your valuables and then take your film into Boots or Supersnaps or whatever with all your details on it, because you don't know who works there and who's going to pick up that and . And just,. You'll either have to use a polaroid instamatic camera and, or, go to a re a reputable photographer and make sure you get the negatives back. The sort of larger items the police have property marking kits that they're quite willing to lend out to people, or alternatively, you can hire them out on your library card, and you can dye stamp those or engrave them. And if you're going to do thin metal objects or a sort of aluminium frame, do not use the dye stamps on those. And all that is is a hammer and stamp and er and they have a habit of buckling because we regularly, erm postcode cycles erm, with the introduction of the mountain bike we found that on the weaker frames we were buckling them. And a mountain bike is quite expensive to replace! Erm, because they range from sort of anywhere from two hundred and fifty pounds erm, in excess of a thousand, so we now, as a matter of course, always engrave them. But it's exactly the same you just use the postcode. Do you, do you think the N P stickers that go on the doors or windows is a deterrent to burglars? N P, do you think it deters them? At one time it did displace crime. I still think that neighbourhood watches does what we're doing is we're pushing it out to Hertfordshire and the Metropolitan area and they're trying to push it elsewhere, and then, you know, we're just Yeah. pushing it away. But it won't deter the real erm Thief. professional thief. But those are few and far between. Most of them are opportunists, most of them come from the local area they'll know the housing estates and whatever happens . They've already chosen their set routes. They're familiar with the ground. And there are many contributing factors as to why er somebody turns to a life of crime, er, which is another argument, which I'm not gonna get involved with. Mm. Erm but, we are getting more and more opportunists lately. You know only as I say, it's made easy for them. It's like, sort of thefts of motor vehicles, we can reduce the theft of the actual vehicle, because there are security devices now to do that, to make it harder and you cannot odds somebody coming along the street, throwing a brick through a window and grabbing your cassette out. It takes a matter of seconds, and by the time the police have actually received the call, they're on route, they've gone. Most people are also scared to get involved now, because of the reprisals if they've actually reported some, to er, to a crime and you can a , understand that. I can understand that they don't want to get, to to go through the rigmarole of court. But the o , other thing is, you know, do you let these people get away with it? It's a matter for you as individuals isn't it if you witness something? But we haven't got a crystal ball, we don't know what's going on, unless you tell us cos we are relying on members of the public telling us things, saying that they've witnessed things what you saw. And that's a very difficult thing again, because most people's idea of description is different. We have a di , a different picture, and we make up erm pictures like you see o on these crime programmes, the videofits of suspects, you've all seen them where th , you know got the lines between the nose and, and the mouth they are made up of the information that we've gained from witnesses. As I say, but if there's I mean, how tall do you think I am sir? I dunno, about five foot seven, eight? Five foot eight? Well that's very flattering. Five foot five? Five foot five? Yeah. Five foot three to five foot four, five four. Right. Some of you might have taken into consideration the heel on my shoe. I'm actually five foot four I can't see that. so you're all wrong! I said five foot four! Erm It's only a foot! Yeah, it's only a foot. That's right. That foot ! And in , when we look for distinguishing marks on people Yeah. hair colour changes, size change, and you know, we'll say well what did the person look like? Well he had brown hair! Well there's many different shades of brown, you know. What was he wearing? Jeans. You know! What was he wearing on his feet? Trainers. White. Can you imagine, we have to try and make out a picture of that! Yeah. Oh could you? Mm. But, surely, coming back to the a highly say I didn't do it. I knew a chap on the police force and pretty irritant and pure walking around the like each day, trying to see if there's any . Well they can Yeah. but individuals have a responsibility for crime as well, because the ownership of, of crime problems is not just the police, it's down to the community in which that the people live. And this is probably the hardest Well surely we're trying to do this in the way of neighbourhood watch That's one of the ways, certainly. Couldn't you have a yo yo say And with with you want more more they want it both sides of the coin don't they? you see the officer walking, walking around in pairs continually, not and if you're gonna be paid extra for it, do it that way. If the police can't do it then somebody else has got to! I must be Right! said! To try somebody of a trainer er . Yes it's still I tell you yo That's right. I don't want my house broken into in the first place. I don't wanna be told that somebody and some remote things, like which was mine, and somebody would say, well he saw it and he saw the policeman ah they would come, they've never catch them! No. But this is, well this is You know, I don't blame you for that. This is the starting point isn't it? Rather than at all, where would you be I don't know. then? I don't know this afte , well it's it's a pretence to the You have a responsibl , bility Mm. of your own premises don't you? And how to secure those up. Yeah. Because at the end of the day you don't want somebody coming into your home. No I don't. No! Well tha that's really a fro market isn't it, once everybody That's it. takes reasonable precautions And that's all I'm asking you to do. to the best of their ability , but I mean, I take our friend's point of view, if they're marked, I mean, what's the chances of someone breaking into a home, what's the chance of er, them ever being er captured? Quite a lot in actual fact! I I would, I would have thought that there's Yeah. there's many more get away with it than there is actually captured ones. There are. But sooner or later they, they're going to start making mistakes bad mistakes, and that's when they, they come on Come a croppers. line to to be caught. Yeah. And then, we then we have to trace. I mean, police stations regularly become full of stolen items and we've got nowhere to put it, and we have to have these displays erm, where we try and and trace the owners, it's a, a very difficult job, it's a very time consuming job Yes. by marking your property at least it gives us a starting point especially if it's personal to you. I mean I, what you're saying's quite valid I mean,i if you've got a situation where you have been successful and you've got an accumulation of stuff that's been recovered from robberies, at least it gives you some method of returning it to it's previous That's right. owners. But we're relying on you to put it on there. But, it's it's not really a deterrent, that's the point we're making isn't it? It's it's one way because they don't want Yeah. identifiable property Mm. because it makes it harder for them to sell. Oh it does . Mm. Who's gonna sleep at night . They won't, but we will. Just, we just put our sign across it Yeah. that's the beauty of that. You can visible marker your goods, but that's even less attractive, but would you want an engraved mark across one of your prize possessions? Well actually, I think they're more suitable like that as though the insurance companies certainly don't ! They will Rather than, it's it's the sentimental value a lot of things, a lot of things . You normally client cooperation . I like that ! , you might the money back. That's handy, but Is it okay? Shall I ask? Quite a lot of people don't want them back Yeah. they've done well out the insurance ! They, they'd rather have the money, yeah! told though that the film is going to to actually work now so Don't be silly! They'll take it now, you know what I mean? Yes ! Can you hear that? Right. Okay. Something else I'd just like to, I was actually I was erm aware that time is passing us by. Who made the comment er, about people walking themselves at night ? Would that be safe to say that most of ? It's becoming sort of fairly topical erm where there, and it is, more perhaps related to the fear of crime than the actual crime itself, where, people are afraid to go out for fear that they're going to be personally attacked, whether it be you know, answering the door at night in their own homes, or actually, you know, going to their cars. None of us like to go in poorly lit areas, it automatically raises our fear level doesn't it? Or we feel unsafe. And we've all been in situations where we've walked into an area, whether it be, sort of a car park is poorly lit, or you've gone down a lane that's perhaps been overgrown by bushes and things like that we generally don't feel as confident. And it doesn't just apply to woman, it can apply to men as well. It's not something I particularly thought an awful lot of until I came on crime prevention, because before that I was in police uniform with marked cars with the radio, although half the time in Harlow, the radios don't work cos we're getting . But it, it didn't worry me and I liked to think I can go about my daily life and not be frightened, and I am not gonna be frightened to go out at night. . But on crime prevention, I'm for most part in plain clothes, I use my own car work and, I'm not in a marked car, I don't have a radio because my job, as I said from the beginning is very varied and therefore it's not practical for me to have a radio. So I'm out and about and quite often I go and visit people in their own homes out of the back and beyond of nowhere cos I just called out as a result of that and I suddenly thought I I'm highly vulnerable to them I could be subject to attack like anybody else, how will I protect myself? That was going to be erm , well I thought well I really haven't got the answer to that. So I immediately started to look into these things, which are personal attack alarms and it is a very basic er deterrent value. Many different types on the market, but when you actually start to look into them, erm, they reveal a few things, you can see by this one it's a fairly old one, but it is for for demo purposes only, this is one by Polycell, it's battery operated in a plastic cases and it's handy because it's got a torch but when you actually put the alarm on it goes my gadget's not working really. Oh! As you can see, the battery runs out! So I don't think they're very good. Erm as well as that, if you drop that, that's going to smash as one of my colleagues discovered. I thought well, I don't favour that, I'll go and have a look at cylinder type. This one is called a walk- easy very effective, particularly good for people with arthritic hands because erm it doesn't take an awful lot to actually press down the top. But how effective is it? When you start to discover this one actually does travel through walls, the sound of it does actually does travel through walls, but as I say, it's only a temporary measure to buy yourself a little bit of time she says. That's one on it's way out really so But that sound would be continuously repeated. It does. Yes. That one actually locks on. The one that I tend to use most of the time is this one not least, because it only three pounds, and it's quite affordable but a , again, it's got a loud sound to it, and I found that if you carry one of these with you and somebody does approach you, you've always got this in your pocket and you can actually aim it them, cos they don't know what you've got in your hand. If you actually put that up to near where he is it could even . Is it ! incredible isn't it ? I like the cylindrical type. I like this because you can actually Aha. clip it onto your clothes It's an idea, innit? Yeah. Yeah. it's handy to keep in your pocket if you're walking the dog at night. That's a nice one. So I thought well I'll carry one of these for when I'm going out in my car to which, you know,and if somebody does come up to me I can use it in a positive manner while in a split second time for me, hopefully beca , cos of my range of work Mm. to get out of that situation. I'm not a black belt in karate, and I'm don't suppose most of you are. Okay? There's a whole group on me then I'm not gonna stand about erm , but if it's a one on one I might stand a chance. So I think that is certainly worth it, if not least for the ladies to consider. It's an idea. But I want to bring something Mm. out which doesn't include the men. You've probably all been in situation where you seen people zigzag across the road because they think they're being followed the ladies will do it because she thinks a bloke is following her and the men are probably thinking does she think I'm following her? And carry on down the road. It's a very difficult situation because nobody knows how to react. Now, some men think right, I'll walk across the road others will think well I'll stay behind because it might be safer cos there might be somebody lurking in the corners none of us know quite how to react to that. And you'll find that the it's normally the woman that takes the initiative and crosses the road which she's unsure of. The idea is though, that you don't put yourselves in risk situations in the first place. You don't go into areas that are poorly lit if you can help it, you don't take a short cut through the dark woods because it'll save you five minutes on your journey, stick in well lit,we well lit areas. How many of the ladies here are drivers? Right. On the back er table there there's a brochure called Women at the Wheel, it's a Vauxhall er application please do take a good copy, very good application. Who knows the break down,el , the procedure for break downs on motorways? What you should and shouldn't do? Come on gents, you should know as well! Whether you stay with your car or not? That's understandable. Lock yourself in. Stay in the car stay with the car and put these erm, motorists lights on. Stay in the car? Mm. Any advances on that? Anybody think any different? Have one of those things in the car and you speak to the R A C or the A A Yeah. clearly But if it's lady,cos I couldn't afford one of those ! Yeah ! I know. They are expensive. Actually I think they're they're well advertised for what they are. No, actually, no don't sit in the car. The nearest phone. If you're on a motorway it's, it's maybe it's before you, every mile on a motorway there is an S O S phone box okay? When you pick up the rec , the, the hands it will actually take you through to the nearest police control room area now, if it's on the M eleven then most of the calls will go into Chelmsford, our police headquarters, once you cross over the borders and go into Metropolitan area, then that goes up to the Scotland Yard in their control rooms. Every telephone box has a unique telephone number, once you pick that up, it actually flashes a little signal, we can pinpoint exactly where you are. Now they're not the easiest things to speak into because the noise volume of the traffic is quite horrendous so you have to shout. Has anybody broken down here? Anybody been through this experience before? Yeah. Yeah. It's a horrible experience because the the through traffic goes so fast erm, so anybody who actually doesn't know quite what you have to do. On the marker posts that you see, the next time you, you travel past them at ninety miles an hour if you get time to see them, there is actually, a picture of the telephone headset and a number under that headset there will be an arrow pointing you in the direction of the nearest emergency telephone. If you get a post with two arrows it means you're exactly half way and you've gotta make the decision for yourselves. If you break down and you can drive to the nearest one, then do so, it i if it's something like a, your wheel, or your tyre's gone down, then drive. Yes, you're gonna damage your wheel, but you'll be safer that way. If you've got no choice but to get out and walk then you are gonna have to do that, and that's all very well being a day like today, where it's not pouring down with rain er, you're not walking in a pitch black area, but if you do suddenly change that and you put it into those sort of, well that sort of scenario you'll find it's very, very, frightening. What we have to say is, straight from Essex Police if that happens to you, get out, wherever possible on the passenger's side of the vehicle and then go to your nearest box and then you pick up the receiver and get through the police control room and they will ask you a series of questions, have you broken down? Are you a member of a national breakdown ? And are you a woman on your own? Cos women on their own, or with young children get priority. You know,. That all erm came about as a result of the Marie Rivers case Mm. And so we do try and give priority to, to ladies on their own. Given, obviously the fact that you've broken, and if you are a member of a breakdown organization they will call them out for you. If you are not, and I have to stress this very carefully then they will call the nearest available garage and the garage will come there very quickly and they will tow you off into the nearest exit and there they will leave you and that can cost you probably, in excess of ninety pounds. So it does pay you to be a member of R A C, National Breakdown, A A or whatever because at least most of them provide a service where they can take you to your destination and or arrange further transport for you. So, bear that in mind cos it wi , even if it's just sort of fifty yards up the motorway, that's where they'll drop you then you're on your own. Once you've made your call, they might ask you to stay by the phone erm, to to contact you back it might be that they ask you did you want anybody contacted to tell them that, that you've broken down, they will do that for you. You can ask them, if it's urgent, then they will do that. Then, we ask you return to the area of your car, but do not get back in because you run the risk of being injured erm, through cars ploughing into the back of you, far more than you, as much for a personal attack. So that is why, being a good boy scouts, and girl guides that you are you are gonna put things in the car so that you're, you are prepared for wet weather, or cold weather erm, such as an old blanket or something to sit on er, because we like you to sit upon a bank as far away from the traffic as possible Hello. Hello. Do have a seat, right what shall we do with you today? I seem to have done something silly with my shoulder, it's awfully stiff and Which one? This one. Right, but you can't think what? Well we were at a venture park on er Sunday and I reckon I probably did something on one of the rides without realizing it. No. Cos it came on sort of about middle of the day. Right, you haven't been from anything, or pulling anything too hard or? N other than carry my daughter, Mm. since she's a bit of lump nowadays. Now, you don't need to take anything off. Can you lift it up, right up? Yeah. Pretty good, can you get it behind your, get your hand behind your neck? Turn it ro er okay. Can y Can't feel it can you turn it round and get it behind your back? Can you put your hand behind your back like that? Turn it round. Good okay. Can you, can you actually do that? Can you swing it right round so you can do that? Y yeah I can. You're not allowed to use that one . Okay, good. Okay. So you've got a good range of movement, okay. Yes , yeah. What happens if you lift something or pull something? I get a sharp stabbing pain. If I'm br even Yeah. when I'm breathing, Yeah, I can feel it in my, in my Yeah,okay just relax. What I'm going to do is to examine now I'm going to go up the collar bone first over the shoulder pad,T-shirt with a shoulder pad . I know, they went out with the ark, didn't they? You okay over there? Yeah. Over the top? Good that's fine. Are you okay with the front of the joint, in there? Yeah. Yeah. It's only in articulate areas, I in the side of the joint there? Is that okay? It feels a bit tender, but Yeah. it's okay, yeah. Well yeah. Over the top? Yeah that's fine. Under there? Yeah. Now if I come round, just sit forward slightly for me, that's right. If I come round the shoulder blade muscles, round there. Anything? No. If I was to sort of pinch the muscle at the back here? If you can find it, that's huge muscle. Is that tender at all? No. Okay, can you point to where you get most discomfort? Right, in Oh. the centre there. Right in there? Oh okay. Mm. Is that tender to press in there? Oh yes. Yes. Is that hurting there? Yes. . That's fine. I'm . Now this isn't your s shoulder directly, but it is the muscles that hold and support and turn the shoulder blade, and of course whenever you do anything with your shoulder the shoulder blade moves with it. So it will tend only more so, I would say, because the, the other powers were more, were even more prostrate than is, is, is the situation today. So for a while, the President of the United States effectively had world power, there was no other power in the world who could stand up to the U S, er, after, after, World War One for one argument anyway, and I think Freud's er, defence disposition would be, Woodrow Wilson was the man who came to Europe, saying he would bring a just peace for all, and went away leaving a total mess, and, and, Freud's er argument in his book is, told us was, well, the mess er, was really Wilson's own doing, and if it was his doing, what was it in his character that allowed him to er,si to on some Lloyd George, who bullied him into getting most of what they wanted. So, that would be Freud's defence, now, I suppose you would have to know a lot more about modern history, to, to know, if this was really true or not, but erm, the the er, question that Freud was really asking himself, really was, why did Wilson let us down, because Freud admits that he regarded Wilson, when he came to Europe as a saviour. You know, here, here was somebody coming from outside Europe who would bring, you know, peace and justice for all. Let's hope, I quoted the American Constitution correctly, did I? Erm, you know, perhaps the kind of way people look on President today. You know, which is only day one of his inauguration. We'll see what happens to him, President . But erm, that would be for its, for its er,defence, I suppose. Is it fallible I mean how do, how do modern America let's ask er and erm, er and . How do modern Americans see Woodrow Wilson? Erm What's your image of him? er, I don't know, I think he forgot you know, Yeah I don't, I don't I remembered him having in my school library Mm. he was regarded as a very very smart man Mm. and er, one of our most intellectual presidents. Yeah. And I don't think, I don't think most people considered him vulnerable, very vulnerable. I mean, they know that working Yeah. But I don't think most people, er, would necessarily consider it than now on the European side, they might consider . Erm, but you know, but I think they did. I think it marks the beginning of the United States their first real world power. So I think that's, that's how he was I see. Mm. So people don't blame him for the consequences of Versailles? I don't think so. No, no. To answer my own question, I did. I mean, I think Yeah. No, that's true, that's true. What about er, European history, who's studied this period in modern history at school? Have you? Yes. What question do you go to Woodrow Wilson? frankly, he was a I see. No. everything he wants. But the things is, he wanted to a lot of things about came up like in the middle Mm. ages before the war you more you think about it, Mm. Yes. I see, yes. Anyone else got a view on this? He was a very odd man, though Mm. as Freud said, that at fourteen adult life Good one, doc, yes, And erm, I mean er, the last eighteen months of his presidency he erm, settled with Mrs Wilson because he would be incapable Yeah, the, of course, er, Freud had one advantage here, and that was Bullitt. Erm, as we know, Bullitt was a member of the delegation and an intimate of, of Wilson, so the book is er co- authored, so in a sense we should know as we're paying for, for all of it, because er, obviously, he relied on Bullitt to give him all this biographical information, and er, consequently what you see Freud doing in this in this book is, is er trawling through, as it were, the things that Bullitt told him, that, that Bullitt had found out, to erm, draw a kind of psy psychoanalytic portrait of Woodrow Wilson, that erm, tried to explain his problem, why did he not deliver the goods as it were . And the if you put the character of Woodrow Wilson aside, the, the central theme which comes out of this book, which is I think why it's important, worth reading certainly the introduction is worth reading. There is a three or four page brief introduction er, to the book, which is presumably by Freud himself, because it's about psychoanalysis, and I don't think Bullitt could have written it. Erm, what's worth reading about that, and it comes out strongly in the introduction, is that this is a kind of case stu study of a particular kind of person. Er, er, a man who grows up under the shadow of his father, as it were. So it's quite an interesting, whatever you think about Woodrow Wilson in the First World War is quite a interesting book, in drawing a character study of the kind of person who Freud must have seen many times in his practice. The man who grows up idealizing his father, and whose relationship with his father is a largely passive one. So he tends to regard his father as a kind of ideal he can never equal, and tends if anything to identify with er, with his own mother, and play a kind of passive role to his, to his father. And this is how Freud explains Wilson's inability to stand up to the other men, like Woodrow, like Cle Clements or Lloyd George, who were rather aggressive, and er, were, were kind of pushing all the time, what they could out of the, out of the peace settlement, and what, er the book shows, is that Woodrow Wilson would have confrontations with them and say a lot of fine words, and then the next day, he would, he would give it all away, as it were, he would, he would be ill or he'll backtrack, or when the actual agreements came to be signed, he, he wouldn't do what he said he would, er,wh what he did. So Freud has to explain this weakness of Wilson, in the face of erm, these much more dominant aggressive men he was up against in these very hard er hitting negotiations, about what to do about the world after, after World War One. So, Freud's view is that he was, this passive erm nature of, of, of, retiring er nature of, of Woodrow Wilson, which explains his inte intellectuality as says, erm, Wilson was a very intellectual man. He had a great fondness for speeches and oratory. Apparently, in his childhood, he'd give speeches to an empty barn, er, had, would stand in the, in the family barn, erm, giving lectures to the hay, you know, and he, he, he loved this, and he, he was, he had a great erm sense of grandiloquent language and, Freud and Bullitt's interpretation is that, Woodrow Wilson, in a sense, was a typical politician. Very good at words, not so good at, at, at actions and actually delivering the goods as it were So, why, why do you ? Well, er I asked this, because erm, when I was having my house it came up, and I and I pointed out to her th the astonishing anomaly, I said, look erm, everybody knows about manuscript, Ernest and his biography of Freud mentions it and says he read it and reports rather well of it, actually, was really quite impressed with it. I said knew about it, erm, you must have known about it, erm, that standard edition of the complete psychological works of Freud, that's its title, and you're one of the editors, one of the editors, I said, there's no evidence that you ever intended to include this book in it, even though, you know, I understand that it couldn't be published as long as Woodrow Wilson's family was still alive, but erm, you know, why wasn't it published in the standard edition? And said I don't know. Now, she could have been lying. I don't think she would have told me a, a lie. When I asked her things like that, she didn't want to tell me on other occasions, she said I know that I can't tell you. Er, she was an honest person. I think that's what she would have said. If, if, if that had been the case, she'd say, oh, I do know, but I'm afraid I can't tell you. When she said, I don't know, I think she was telling me the truth, she didn't know. Erm, the fact is, she didn't play a dominant part in the standard tradition, although she was one of the editors, of course. Er, she was mainly one of the editors because she was erm, her father's, you know she even inherited her father's estate. So, so that was in her share of the management . I don't think she'd taken erm prominent role in the day to day planning of the standard edition, this was done by erm, calculable spreadsheet. So erm, I think when she said she didn't know, er, she was telling the truth, and when asked her if she could explain to me, the very point that just asked me, again she said she, she couldn't explain, she had, she she'd agreed, agreed it was a paradox, that she didn't really know erm, why the book had never been published, or until nineteen sixty seven erm note, note that it, that it had been taken. Erm, my only view is that, er, the reason is that, by the time it saw the light of day, because remember, the manuscript was in the, the manuscript was physically in the possession of the Bullitt family not the Freud family. Erm, when the Bullitt family sought it to published it, it was published, but by that time, the kind of changes that I talked about at the beginning of my lectures, had already occurred in psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis had evolved into a highly therapeutic undertaking, which was very very and institutionalized for therapy, and the black books had already been blackened, as it were. People were already tending to ignore these very works we're looking at,theomonoism we'll be looking at next week, gonna tell us about that, aren't you . Yes. Another very black book, er, Civilization Discon these kind of books were, er, generally er, at, at er best ignored, at worst disparaged, by the psychoanalytic establishment. So when this book on, on Woodrow Wilson appeared, I mean, it gets even blacker. Er, particularly since it was only half right, or you couldn't exactly tell which half, not very clearly, so if it's half by Freud, and er, it was a book erm, on erm, a controversial figure arguing over very controversial pieces, and I think the psychoanalytic study didn't want to have anything to do with it, and er, er, one of the reviews of the psychoanalytic journal that said that this is the kind of book that gets psychoanalysis a bad name. And er, on the other side, the, the people interested in it in the social sciences, erm, didn't particularly like it, because, at that time, they were heavily dominated by er, Marxist and people on the left. I mean, I myself, for instance, after I'd published my first book on psychoanalysis in nineteen eighty was summoned to the House of Commons by and given a dinner, in the House of Commons Restaurant, which isn't very good actually, least it wasn't then, and effectively I was told by this great man was, noticed, had a very high opinion of his own ego, that erm, you know the left was in charge of psychoanalysis in this country, and had better conform or shut up. My views were not politically correct. And would I please stop publishing on psychoanalysis and leave it to my elders and betters. Like . So I er, I politely told him what he could do with that, well, I was eating his dinner and I couldn't be too rude to him, but erm, you know, when er when, when confronted, I don't give ground over that kind of thing. I said, you know, I'd every right to resume my own research, erm, if the Labour Party thought it owned psychoanalysis, I'm afraid I have, have to differ. So we, we parted on that note. But erm, the people like and the left, didn't like the book either, because it didn't tell their particular interpretation, as kind of left Marxist er, interpretation as someone has it, was so popular at the time. And so the book was just kind of, ignored I think, and left standing, and now it's out of print, and we've discovered this week, it's not even in the university library. Erm, it must have vanished, there was a copy there. Er, so it's, it, it's one of these strangely anomalous works, it, it's, it has spawned, I must admit, some very unfortunate literature, and I think 's own book is the worst example, but it's not the only one. There's a whole area of psycho-history. Has anybody read about psycho-history? There's a whole school of psycho- history mainly in the United States, not many followers here, and er, I must admit, I, I used to have er a class on psycho-history on this course, and I dropped it, and the reason was, I think students didn't find it very satisfactory, and the literature was of such poor quality. It really was er of the sort, you know, if Cleopatra's nose had been half an inch longer, history would have all been different, you know, that, that kind of trivia. Erm I think you can see that the problem with this kind of biographical approach to history is it can degenerate into trivia. Of the kind that himself wrote of . Which I think is, er, is one of the worst examples of trivial. Because, because clearly, you can see that in the social sciences, there is a big problem. If you think that individual people have a big role in history, like and Woodrow Wilson, I doubt if he did, I mean everybody would admit that these were important figures obviously, but the question is, how important were they, compared with social, political and economic factors, possibly beyond their control? I mean this is the big issue, isn't it? I thought, like, I mean, isn't the basic idea of psychoanalysis is that, you know that, that these people are repressing something and that's studying, and the question is how well, can you arrive at what they were repressing, by just sort of secondhand, you know, I mean Mm. wouldn't you, I mean, not as so best way to figure out what they were repressing, but just, I mean wouldn't you need to really have the whole life in front of you You would. to figure out? I mean, we urgently certainly we can psychoanalyse a group, you know, the group psy the group psychology, because we all understand how groups act, and we can say, oh, yes groups act like that, you do act like that, that makes sense and that can prove it, you know. But with, with a man, I mean, you really need to have every single incident in his life, to, to really know what That is absolutely true. Yes, this is another big problem I think you put that very well, that people forget, of course, that in clinical psychoan analysis the analyst has a vast amount of data, because the patient is going five times a week, or in Freud's case, six times a week, for fifty minutes every day, six days a week, nine months of the year, often for several years and er, the, the sheer amount of data that the analyst gets, is absolutely immense. I mean, I can well recall in my own analysis with , of course, for the first six months she said nothing, and I used to get very frustrated, and say, look, what do you think of this? What's your interpretation, she would say, oh, we don't know enough yet. She said I'm not sure. We'll have to wait and see. And for about six months, I didn't get anything. When interpretations were offered to me, she said so and so, and I said, why, and then she was ready. She said there was this female, that the other thing, and there was a whole long list of things that pointed to this interpretation, and it was all part of a, as you say a great mass of data, that erm, is, is quite mind-bogglingly large, if you actually erm, see it in words. Erm, it's very difficult, of course, to er, well it's impossible actually, to turn that into er written accounts. Because of course if you were to tape record analytic sessions, it would change that nature of the, of the analysis. And er, one of the big scientific problems with psychoanalysis is that privacy and confidentiality are prominent, as obviously in other areas of science, you can er, the demonstration has to be in public, as it were . I mean, other people can do the experiment or repeat it. Trouble with an individual psychoanalysis, it can never be. So one of the big problems with an historical figure, is that erm, you don't even have that much data to go on, the data you have is gonna inevitably be, be selective and limited. Again I think if Freud and Bullitt were here today, they'd say, well look we did, in fact, have quite a lot of data, because I, Bullitt knew Wilson intimately for several years and worked with him, and er, Freud had rarely the stuff in erm, in all papers of Woodrow Wilson in the library of Congress or wherever they were, and he had a great deal of data. But even so, 's point is a good one, that there isn't, there's seldom if ever enough this is a small problem in psychoanalysis, I myself hope to put right to some extent, and some of you may live long enough to see this happen, I hope you will. Er, that's why I'll tell you all, I even tell young people. There's no point in telling old people, because they'd be dead. But erm, there are one or two interesting exceptions to this, and one exception is myself, because er, I started analyzing myself through maybe to nineteen sixty nine, and with one or two small exceptions, like when I was being analyzed by and I didn't like it, with any doubt, my entire analysis was being written down. Erm, I guess now in fact, erm er, last few years is all er, is all er entered in data on computer. And it's my intention to keep up this analysis, er, for as long as it takes, probably to the end of my life. And that er, on the centenary of my birth, which will fall in two thousand and forty six, my heirs and executors will be free to er, release it to the world, on condition, however, that it's published complete and unexpurgated and unedited. In other words, if you're gonna have personal , you're gonna, it, you can't allow somebody to edit us out, as it were. And er, if and when it's published, there will be millions of words, I mean there are now, and I don't how large it is now, it's impossible to tell how large, erm, but just a couple of years, for example, amounts to over a quarter of a million words, so if you run that back to nineteen sixty nine, you see it is going to be one of the largest books ever written. And it maybe, if it's ever published, while we're still here in two thousand and forty six, and my executors do as I hope they will, erm, you know, it will be a book alongside Samuel Pepys, and Casanova and Saint Augustine, it's that length. My guess it's as least long as Samuel Pepys' diary, or will be. And I hope that, er, you know, this, all this data will be published, and people will be able to see just what the complete data is. And if that's the case, then in the middle of the next century, more will be known about me, than has ever been known about any other human being. Because I have faithfully stuck to the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis. I have not held back anything. It's all true and it's all right. Of course, my own reputation will be the first victim of this. I will be universally despised. But that's okay, I mean I'm not particularly, I'm not so impressed with the human race that I, I, I think much of their opinion of me anyway. But erm, the great pity of course is, that Freud didn't do this. It's, I mean, Freud we know, did do a certain analysis. My guess is, he must have written an account. It's a great pity he didn't preserve any detail, and he looked, er, like all his other papers had been left in the library of Congress until two thousand and twenty five, and then they will all become public. Erm, that would have been er, really worth knowing . But as I've said, it will, it will be preserved in my case. Erm, it's my great contribution to science, unfortunately I shall be long dead, and many of yo some of you may, I don't know how many of you will still be alive in two thousand and forty six, but if you are, you may see this day. I won't of course. But it's a, it's a problem that, that you've put your finger on, and this is why I personally think that a lot of this literature is of such a poor quality. And certainly this stuff, I mean, when a person's still alive, how can you possibly know enough? You see, Woodrow Wilson was dead, Bullitt had access to a lot of private material that er, perhaps there's still,I don't know whether it's ever been published. And of course, Bullitt had directly observed the man and interacted with him during the critical time at, at the Versailles conference. And the whole book is really about er the Versailles conference in a way, isn't it, and about why he behaved the way he did at the time. So there's a kind of critical period here, that we have got a lot of information about. And in a sense, the book is very one dimensional in that it follows just this one aspect of Woodrow Wilson's character, the critical one. Now of course, in a, in a complete psychoanalysis, if Woodrow Wilson had been going for analysis, then all kinds of other aspects of his life and personality would have opened up. And you wouldn't get this concentration on one, this one kind of character defect, which er, admittedly, is a, is a problem with the book and, and can make it look as if it is a kind of character assassination. character assassination of Wilson? Erm, yes, perhaps. Mm. Yes, but Freud does er justify this er meaning, that this is why to form a psychological That's Because of his limitations I was gonna further say that erm, you know, beside lack of information itself,information of repression, information into someone's life I mean, repression necessarily I mean the, the thing that someone does in their lifetime might necessarily strange and distracted, and the purpose of the thing Well, yes, that, that's true but I think the, er, by the nineteen twenties, when Freud was writing this book, was it nineteen twenty nine, twenty eight, twenty nine, Er, well,certainly, yes. They started it, yes. Right, so they, sorry, the early nineteen thirties, when they started it. By that time, Freud certainly had moved on a bit, from the earlier, perhaps rather narrow concentration on the repression and he was moving into the second er era of psycho psychoanalysis when there was an emphasis more on the total personality on the ego and its mechanisms of defence, to quote a title of a famous book by , and I think this is more the kind of thing that Freud is doing in this book, where you, you see not just the repressions in the unconscious, but the whole personality, and you understand it, in terms of its various defensive erm, structures, and the way which it carried out its repression. In other words, you concentrate not just on what's repressed in id, but on the structure of the ego as well, and the superego, and the course of nature part of it comes out in the book as told us that Woodrow Wilson had a tremendous superego in the form of his identification with his father, who he further identified with God, I mean, if I come over very critical indeed, and therefore, his own ego was identified with Jesus Christ. And this, for example, I mean, whether we believe this or not, this Freud says, or thinks, explains why Wilson could come to Europe as a saviour, the saviour of mankind, but then failed to deliver the goods, because of the passive nature of his identification, you know, Jesus got crucified. Which was a pretty passive thing to do, in some ways, erm, and similarly, you could say Woodrow Wilson ended up crucified by the, by the allies. A certain fourteen points for cruci everybody must have that . And, erm, so this, it was, in a sense it was not so much as what was repressed in his ears, the structure of his ego that led to this unfortunate consequence. Does that answer your So it's part of this larger view of psychoanalysis that was emerging in the thirties. Where you could have more of a character study, rather than just the kind of erm, capping the unconscious, as it were Since like what you say, psychoanalysis was now, I mean, is it mostly centred on the ego? I mean, one , since you can't go if you don't Mm. would you say that, you know, in modern psychoanalysis presumably just not the, like the structure of the ego, and then they know Wh what, well,I, I wouldn't say just looking similar, I would say additionally looking, but, but in the, in the early days the erm, and I'll be saying something about this in the, in the lectures,bu but just briefly, that you could you could say there were phases in psychoanalysis, the early days, before both of us were born you were here, the, the aim when the method was , the aim was to release the unconscious, bring it to the surface, and that was regarded as more or less enough. Analyses in those days were short by modern standards. There's an example in my book, with one that only lasted six weeks, for example, which is astonishing by modern standards. After World War One, and especially by the nineteen thirties, the, the purview of psychoanalysis, as it were, had, had enlarged to include the ego, as we saw, and so, so what happened then was, the structure of the ego was explored and not just the repressions. In other words, it was the agencies that carried out the repressions that were analyzed, as well as the repressions themselves. This is a much more like a, a kind of total dissection of the personality. It means that psychoanalysis takes a lot longer, because you are looking at defences and ego as well as at, at the . You get a much more complete picture. Analogy I used in my book, was actually suggested to me by , although this is a ana a kind of metaphor that, that her father was very fond of. Erm, was with archaeology. But in the nineteenth century, archaeology was a kind of treasure-troving erm, explorers, a kind of raid on, on the very past, to discover the treasure. That's what psychoanalysis was like in its first days. We raided the unconscious, as it were, to, to liberate the repressed and, and, and understand what was in that. Modern archaeology is much more scientific and it's, it tends to excavate entire layers, layer, by layer and every little thing is relevant, you know, they, the little pot shard, erm, even bits of excrement, apparently are very interesting to archaeologists, because they're sure people were eating, and things like this, er, you know, remnants of fire was charcoal, everything. All of this is, is just good as well as bits of gold and er and, and you know metal objects, that have always traditionally been interesting to archaeologists. And that's rather like modern analysis, everything is interesting. It's not just what is repressed, it's the structures of the ego that bring about these repressions, the identifications and so on. So it's a more complete er picture, of, of, of the personality, and of course it lends itself to this kind of historical portraiture . Because as says, er, the unconscious is, as a sense, is always hidden, so how do you possibly find out about the unconscious of historical figures that are dead and gone? Well, the answer is with very very great difficulty. But if you were looking at their egos as well, er their whole personality had its defence disrupted, then of course , you may be able to see a bit more, because you are now looking at areas which are co both conscious and manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways. Does that answer your, your point? Yeah, I suppose I was thinking, I, I always get mixed up when you say psychoanalysis Mm. I just want to you know modern days was just confusing me and er, all this sort of thing. Whereas I think it easy, you know sometimes I get confused about what's what Right. So, when, when I talk about psychoanalysis in this course, I mean mainly Freudian classical, because it's Freud's writings we're looking at. Admittedly, another aspect of the whole thing, as you rightly say, is that there's been a burgeoning and a lot of different schools, and of course different schools give emphasis to different, different kinds of things. And that's a further complicating factor, of course. Well, it's just coming up to eleven o'clock, who haven't we heard from, er, right, you've been very very quiet there. There. Have you got anything, any comments you want to say about this? I mean, I didn't read the book. No. No. Er, I must admit I point Freud makes,slightly arrogant erm, I mean it, he's, he's, he's a Yeah. Mm. His father's you know there's peace conference in nineteen eighteen Yeah. Did you think that, that, that, that their approach was arrogant and their, the, the affect was trivializing? Well, not really, no. that weren't the impression that I got. The actual book, arise that book anyhow, mm. But it's certainly er, certainly a valid question. Yeah. Woodrow Wilson Well, that's what Freud also subject on. But I know that such a talented writer. You know, I mean, I was convinced that there was no such thing as religion after I'd read the book I mean, anything I read about, I immediately say, oh yes, of course that's true, you know. So. Well, next week, will be telling us about another one of these very controversial books, won't you? Yes. In which we shall be looking at, er another famous figure, but, but, er an even more remote and one, some people might say,mytho mythological one, namely Moses. So having done Woodrow Wilson this week, we will do Moses, next week. We'll look forward to that. Is anybody Jewish, by the way? Right. Well, one year, I must admit, somebody in the class stormed out. The person started to read their paper on Moses, and I thought she was doing a good job of it, this guy suddenly got up and said, I'm Jewish, I'm not listening to any more of this, and stormed out. Oh, I don't see that. Erm, what is the most, Right. Er, that is in,that is in er, Hampstead,. If you wanna get there I'm just the easiest way to do it, is to take the underground to Finchley Road Station Finchley Road Station. Mhm. And when you come out of Finchley Road Station, it's in a place called . I may be able to give you a thing about it actually, if I've still got one. You can visit it, it's open it's best to phone up and find out when they're open, because they're not open every day. And they interesting? Well, there's I mean it's interesting, erm, it's Freud's you know, collection of, of classical and antique . They, they give the impression that the house is the way it was when he lived there, but it's not quite true, actually, it was earlier on. Erm, it's, it's certainly a lot smarter than could remember when lived there. Erm, and now let's see I used to have a file on this, but I might have passed it or given all the stuff away Is it? Yeah, it probably is. Yes, that's, that's the kind of place you would find it. Erm, that is the kind of place you would Alright. Well, if you suddenly find it, you know Er, don't despair, I haven't finished yet, erm Ah, here we are, Freud I knew I had it, I knew I had it. They used to write to me quite regularly Here you are. Great. Thank you. As I said, check the opening hours, they've probably changed. Okay. That tells you where it is, and the phone numbers. Great. Thank you. Erm, Yes to make an appointment. Yeah, the reason is, we have to discuss your erm, your reports and so on. Erm, what were we going to do today? A lot of Right. Okay. Well, let's make an appointment, then. When would be convenient? Well, I finish at, about, about twelve on Tuesdays, and work on Wednesday. Right. Won't be here next Wednesday? What about next Tuesday? Could you, what's on at twelve,twelve thirty. I'm showing a film at one. I mean, you are in in the afternoon on Tuesday? I might, yes. Yeah, the trouble with that, I'll have to make you wait till four thirty, is that too long? Erm, well, what about Thursday? Thursday, yes, no no, next Thursday's easier. What about next Thursday, what time could you ? Erm, between You've got a lecture? Erm, I mean one and two. Between one and two? Or after three. Or after three. Erm, yeah, let's make it at three. Can we make it at three next Thursday, after the lecture? Right. So after next Thursday's lecture, twenty eighth, at three o'clock. Right, Okay. Yeah. See you then,. Thanks very much. Bye. Okay,, come on, come and sit down. Well, I was erm, I just heard, you wanted me to come in, erm, I'm doing a, a paper on Monday. Oh, that's right. That's right. But erm And you were going to you wanted me er, to give you a run through of it. Well, well, I su I suggested that this will be helpful, which it will be, will it? Erm, well the thing is that I still erm, in the process of doing research and reading and gathering a Alright. I mean, we did reports, we did those, yeah lot of ideas about getting an idea about did you, am I in the class just now? I went to erm, the registration Yeah. it says I haven't been put on the list. Am I on it ? Er, well, they hadn't notified me, but they probably, you told them anyway, did you? Yeah, Because that's the important thing. Erm, yeah the important thing is that they know. I mean, I know, I've, I've written it down myself. Erm Okay, you say you're still Right, yeah You're still doing this I didn't think the question that erm, the question culture was the same as our culture. Right. And erm,read about the book so far, and I'm going through erm, Okay. Why? Well, there's no need now, I mean, I only suggested this erm, to help you, er, and I wouldn't want to make you write it out er, just for the sake of writing it out. It don't think it's a good use of your time. And I mean, if you think that just presenting it in the, in the class is er enough send it down to use yourself, but to be able to carry that through and to, to go on to, to be sincere, and I respect that it's important to be sincere. If you, you know, talk about people moral values and to be able to do that, and just majority of anything you need to you need to have a that allows you to do that without Yes, yeah. Yes, it's very important to remember that both in, from this direct point of view and from Freud's findings, you shouldn't just assume that it was a watertight compartment between two areas, as it were. One conscious and un it's not like that. I mean, in fact, what, what er, what Freud found, he says is sometimes, you get erm, this is in fact a kind of continuing from conscious and unconscious, and there's a big gradation in between, and very often erm, things are erm, unconscious, not in the sense that they're totally lost, and you are unaware of them, but for example , they're, they're isolated. They, they, they exist erm,princ a very common finding in psychoanalysis is that things will, will, will exist as word representations, with no feeling representation, or they won't be connected to, to er they'd be completely isolated. You know, a very good example of this, that always sticks in my mind,telling me erm, that once she was analyzing a woman and er, a lot of the analysis was concerned with erm, conflicts, erm, relating to masturbation in childhood, and constantly felt that this was what the analysis seemed to have done , because the woman consistently denied this had ever happened. Absolutely denied, she'd ever done that. Then one day, said she described something she often used to do in childhood, habitually did. And she had a special name for it, I can't remember what is was now, but it was an innocuous word, like erm erm, kneading, or something like that, something you do with your fingers. Erm, and said, okay, that's what you called it in childhood, you called, say kneading, if that's what it was. She said, now, supposing you had to look up what you just described, you know, in a dictionary, and find a word that everybody would associate with it. What word would you find? And she said, the woman thought for a minute, and suddenly she gasped when said that's masturbation, isn't it? And said, yes. And she said, but I've always known I did that. And, you see, she'd known it, but it had been entered under another word, in her mind. As she didn't connect it with what everyone else calls masturbation. You know, er, that's a horrible thing that other people do. She had her own term for it, and as long as it was purely associated with that term, she never connected it. And that's quite a typical finding. That things remain unconscious, not because you never knew about them, but because they're never brought into the relevant connections with other things that make you conscious of the thing in the sense of seeing what's in it for Mrs you know,reports. So we're not saying it's a question of conscious unconscious, or rigid demarcation where we are actually talking about subtle gradations of consciousness, from complete self conscious awareness at one end, to total loss of all memory of the thing at, at, at the other. And everything in the between, and most stuff is in between, as a matter of fact. So I think you're right, it's a very very important, erm, and, and often in life, you can find people switch from one to the other with astonishing speeds. I mean, some people have kind of butterfly minds, with butterfly behaviour, and they switch from being one type of person or another type of person almost minute by minute. You just can't keep up with them. I mean what does this, you know, what is, is this? I mean, do to have this astonishing capacity of switch all the time. You just don't know, know where you are with them. Well, that was interesting, it was interesting discussion, er, thanks to an excellent paper, we're, we're, we're delighted, and that was first rate. Who did I say was next week? Right. We look forward to hearing from you next week,. Sorry I've got to throw you out on time, but I've got another appointment at four. Er,, did you see him about that? Erm, yes I did the only problem Yeah. You don't have a Ah, well, keep our fingers crossed. Tell me if there's anything I can do. Okay. Yeah. Well, what did you think of the film,? Had you seen it before? I hated it. It is a bit, is er is er is a bit odd. I suppose you liked it? Well, I must say I liked it, er, I mean, I showed it because er suggested it. I thought it filled in the, the kind of, some of the biographical kind of things we don't have time to do in the course. was interesting. I mean, the general, I mean Yeah yeah. You think I should show it in the future years? Perhaps not. Er, it depends Yeah, yeah. Fine. The sexual aperitif. Yeah, it did. Er. Yeah, yeah, have a look, hold on. Thanks for the book. Alright. Oh, you sure you can spare it? Yeah, I've no more lectures until your one on Thursday. Well, can I give it to you back on Thursday? Yeah, that's wonderful. You sure you won't need it till then? I'll keep it under lock and key, many thanks. Ah, right, so how are you? Oh, I'm fine, thank you. Put that save. Make sure I don't lose that. Okay. Right, so, and you're going to the, what's the seminar at five is it or That's right,oh, yes, I received this letter. Yeah. I don't know if you've heard about it? No. Erm, well, I was Yeah. and I mean, I considered myself to have been like, er, frequent, or erm, whatever. So er, on the last seminar, they all talked about sending out letters to all the students who weren't there the attendance was very low, and I received one, but Right. enough. And er, I was also asked why I had offered to and I'd already spoken to the students' secretary about it. Yeah. So I wrote back to and Mm. Yeah. I'm not giving the paper for health reasons. I have been Right. I will, I will mention, I didn't know they were sending out such a letter, otherwise I would have er, told them in advance. But I will I'm on the street for the moment I, absolutely, I'll, I'll speak to everyone, don't worry. I mean, don't worry So are you, are you be going to seminar? Yes. Yeah. Yeah,I have to . Thing is I, I just I can't work . No. I go sick No. somehow I haven't been able to work No, okay. because I'm really worried Mm. when I think about it I think I just can't work, it's like, I've lost interest whenever I find some I feel I'm able to keep up Mm which is something I Mm. I mean want to I have considered going back to er, training and cancel this Right, I see, what dropping this altogether? Er, no, I'd like to come in. Mm. I mean I don't particularly like Mm. Yeah. and perhaps after that come back to Right. I really Well, the, I mean the, the thing about the end fill is My Fellow Tablers, I will never ever forget how proud I was to say those words, Fellow Tablers, my first as a Tabler after being inducted some thirteen years ago. That same feeling of pride and excitement is here today and I use those so so meaningful words to greet you as your National President. Fellow Tablers I thank you most sincerely for the honour and opportunity you have given me to become your sixtieth National President. Round Table more than anything else is about people. It is people who make things happen, it is people who bring that special ingredient of fun and fellowship. It is people who give you encouragement and support to turn ideas and dreams into reality and it is people who become friends. In this regard I couldn't have been more fortunate. And my enormous thanks go to my own Table, Chester seventy six, very very true friends indeed and the same for the whole of my own area, Area thirty six Wirral and the Marches, where nothing has been too much trouble and they are here today as you've just seen in some considerable strength. They have been absolutely incredible and I would like to publicly record my deep affection for everything they have done and are continuing to do. My P L C under the Chairmanship of Chester Tabler Mark has been wonderful and the encouragement I have received from seeing the enthusiasm and commitment of the very young Tablers as I purposely invited twenty year old Tablers to be involved in the P L C has given me considerable optimism for the future of Round Table. Most importantly there will be one person affected more than me in the year ahead. She's the glow that keeps together our family life my business life at the same time has always been supportive of my involvement in Round Table. Glesni, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your willingness to share thirteen years of Round Table and the twelve months of Presidency ahead. Fellow Tablers I will never ever forget my first A G M in Manchester. Raschid who is here today was President and I attended with my own Table Chairman at that time David who not only encouraged me to attend my first A G M but encouraged me to get involved involved in ri in Round Table right from the very onset. He helped to get me hook, Round Table did the rest. Raschid that day and Dava late and David later when retiring used the immortal words, Please take care of my Table. It is now our responsibility in the year ahead to care for this movement which is so dear to our hearts to those who have gone before and to the young members who with our encouragement will be involved in the future. The membership issue now has the profile it deserves and demands at Table, Area and National levels and this must be continued. If the answer lies anywhere it lies in the hearts and minds of Tablers. All I'm gonna do is add to what Keith said earlier today and encourage you fellow Tablers to use your hearts and minds over the next twelve months in this direction. There is good news from the tax man our deregistration on subscriptions has been accepted and we are due a refund. This could be a substantial amount of money and it is important in the year ahead that we debate fully how this should be invested in the future of R T B I. The Forward Planning Committee will be asked to seek your views and bring the proposal to the A G M in Skegness. Round Table Day is made for Table and Table only and has all the best features which are inherent in this movement. Each Table or Area doing its own thing in its own way and as an Association moving powerfully in unison. It will be a day which will be inevitably based on fun on fellowship and on benefiting others. Whilst at the same time improving our public image and increasing our awareness. I would very much therefore like to think that Round Table Day on the nineteenth of March nineteen ninety four next year will be the success that you wish to make it. Focusing our energies and our efforts externally. I promised in my five minute address last year that I would be a listener and I've already listened to many of your views over the last twelve months and indeed today. I promise you that I will continue to listen and where I can I will do my best to respond to the wishes of the ideals of and the aspirations of this movement that I hold so dear. The opportunity to serve you and to meet you over the next twelve months I look forward to enormously and while I'm not conceited enough to think that I can move mountains in the year ahead, or naive enough to think that I can please everybody fully, fellow Tablers I promise you I will not let you down.

Oliver said he wanted to go to nursery today because I got some yellow cards you know they're Daffy Duck Oh yeah! from Marks and Spencer you know different shapes. Yeah. be far more counsellor, I, I would of thought she, she would of had counselling anyway before they go to stage of operating, surely, I mean, er don't they look in into sort of psychological aspects of it, it's usually a On the concept yep more than just physical reason I, I mean a lot of people are grossly overweight they, you know, people usually say oh it's the but now apparently in most cases it's very rare with that so it's gotta be too much eating and why do people over eat That's right it's usually too much eating or lack of exercise you know, I mean, there must be compensation for something mustn't there? Yes it's er I must record that Wildlife on One on er, tomorrow night, so I'm in Wales Oh yes Have you read any of your letters about the poems in last week's Observer? No They're not very flattering they didn't er, you weren't rated very highly I'm afraid I think er you tried to get away from the traditional type of Oh I see these one that they send in Mm Yes I er by the thousands I don't go a lot on them myself Oh poetry some of those poems that Bon had in her Touchstones book, especially the ones, the war, about the war, I read some of those and it made me cry, it was so sad. Oh the, the er the ones by erm what's name about the gas and that Oh to be honest I can't remember the Mm, very poignant Mm, but er anti war what was the one about the erm oh it was about the assembling of the gun Oh yes, oh do you remember that? And it's all about the parts naming oh naming the parts That's right yes and er Oh yes that one's come back to me that one now Mm horrible. There's a chap going on about the, the fake and the furniture of these two chairs Mm which are supposed to be erm Come here seventeenth century come here scallywag They said to this, the er, the shape of the stretchers going from side to side where you, where you can put your feet usually Mm you've got all this wear on them you see and the bow of these stretchers said that no one would a able to get their feet on and the guy that's faked it has done all this as he thought, authenticate it What, what they call it, stressing it don't they? Stressing it, yeah stressing it Mm and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable contortionist, it says here oh Mm but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of Well I mean to the untrained eye with a , this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish Yeah which it turned out to be wax Oh to simulate old varnish you see? Oh So then he started looking Yeah They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers Yeah I mean it's, it's so clever really isn't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that. I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you can't possibly think what's things that are in there, it's astronomical.

Off the lead and it was er, so boisterous up and down like this, well he didn't like it straight away he got the old aggro blade up his back about two inches wide then he was watching him like this then he ran Away from it or ran away from it you see and then when he came back he came to us and he growled a few times at it, so, but erm, backed off you know I said he he doesn't mean any harm I said but he's a bit nervous, hoping to god he didn't bite the, bite the other one Spaniel , yeah. he said in all that, we got two he said the other one cut itself badly this morning on er a piece of glass obvious he said managed to come back to me you know being on a lead all his leg was cut so he sort of been down to the vet and had two stitches Stitches so he said I've had to, they'd have to keep him in for ten days or more you know Mm stop him getting dirt keep going in it or whatever Yeah Yeah , erm, it's worth waiting to I saw Mr Bentley Mm. and er he hasn't got any stuff there of course No. but er, he said oh try the guy Try? the chap in Mold, whatever his name is Robert . I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well Mm. so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the Yes I thought he probably would. You were nearly at the end of the tape as well weren't you? I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and won't be able to turn it over. Mm, I don't think so but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all Nobody's interested no, it's a shame said er , they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the Yes What is it? What do they call it that hall? Hawkesbury hall Hawkesbury hall, yes by the school, yeah but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe. Is it? Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it Oh oh they've just locked but er locked it up because er he said they've er So did she say she could get some? Or Said she'll ask, said she knows she's got giving an errand to take out to the place you know because er if Well it's dangerous stuff to handle I suppose Mm but as you say wanted a tiny amount anyway so it's a joke isn't it? you know Mm several of us at college oh well she'll know by tomorrow night, you could her a call you would think tell me that much Which pub? at the college? well yes it's only a small amount for you, but er how many students are there? Well that's the thing yeah You multiple that by getting in a little bit however many there are There's about six I think Mm, even so I mean he, he's still got to buy it ain't he? Even so, yeah So er Oh they've probably got this much you know mm, I mean has he recommended that you use that he, he got or are you Oh I just taken it in out of the book? No that's what you've gotta, you, he showed us Oh said the stuff you're using is Rubbish old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off? Mm You know that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing? And that, and this, you kept getting this er Oh no you, you can use this, but you oil through don't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says don't even use that. Oh His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can Mm put, and then wax you see, now this is what we haven't seen yet So just use wax to build up the polish waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see Mm but you can that's what he does, but, if he want, I don't know, he have to Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in? That's already done innit? Well, cos with him being on night, I don't suppose he got up till about He started just after me, yeah one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he didn't want to bother, but I thought afterwards that'll be each one of those holes, he He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the yes or well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand he will but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that Oh easily concrete and that's got to be one mix each time isn't it? Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water And water erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole Yes so if you just put the well the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere Yeah I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work isn't it? Where's little tiddly gone? Where is he by the way? Erm I said to you he's on the settee Hello, hello, hello if he's on there just shout at him will you because oh he's in here he's by the radiator aren't you beaut? He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal aren't you? Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it. I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document Yeah to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along Personally I would of Well of course that's what vitamin C is isn't it? Well acetic acid is you know the chemical you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see Oh which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that oh my god, well that's the stripper then really isn't it? You're only, you only Well you only put putting that much in Oh in this, in like a pint Mm, so you only want a small amount then really don't you? That's the trouble, I don't need a ruddy gallon Mm and the other of course is the eight eighty ammonia which is only half of five mil, two and a half mil teaspoon. Which chemist did you go to? Bob's Oh, and neither of them, no E T will you stop it you two, you see Aye get in your basket this minute I thought, I thought the other one had got it go on , go on. When you think of it, these chemists to date, no wonder their wives are on a low wage and the moaning all the time because they're not bloody chemists, they're just getting pills out of a box Yeah, that's right , yes, yeah you don't see erm doing this but, well after that, I mean and er, well years ago they had all these bottle of potions on the back shelf I suppose they were mixing up all the time, it's all antibiotics now and isn't it tablets or Mm bottles of already, ready mix There's a jar already done, you just pour it in Yeah, I suppose and mostly to erm, medicines are, are in tablet form aren't they? You know you don't get that many liquids it's usually for children isn't it? Ninety percent probably The erm you get The only liquid you get are probably cough medicines and stuff like that and Yeah which are all, er what they called? I bet they don't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter don't they? Oh their own, yes I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty so where you do it so well where you gonna go for that? Where else can you try? Er well I was gonna ask for when he comes, gonna ask or ask At the college do you mean? They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area and the chemist Mm he's an old fashioned type Well why don't you try Mr Bentley I mean He's bloody finished now Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than to get it, I mean he's very obliging. He lives over the shop still doesn't he? Or at the back of the shop. He's a proper character isn't he? Mm But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out Look in the pockets you great pi , oh I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you Oh jesus, Maggots I caught a few there might be a fiver in one of them You've got no chance of that Hey did you know this Yes oh god Muffin you're not going out again you're covered in mud. I suppose they get fed up stuck in all the time, don't they? Yeah, and they're only out for a few minutes and they're fed up out there as well, and backwards and forwards like a fiddlers elbow go on I want to put those lupins in today, somewhere never mind, no, you're not having any more biscuits you Right I erm, I see it's ten past eleven, I want to get this ball washed, so, er, let them go in the wash Right I'm going to work in the workshop I'll tell you what, I get the erm, I get the battery of the, the other one, you can try it. You want to try it don't you if you're going to have it? Well this is it, it might be knackered now those two Has he been in the, in the loft in the workshop? Or No. Well you, it's not corroded or anything is it? Let's turn that down Can't turn it out. Power isn't it? Yes, but you won't get the same connections will you? I don't know Use your Fantastic that pause I'm looking for something somewhere Yes, well it appears to be working, but whether it's working correctly I don't know oh Ray, there is provision here for the headphones, you, you said are you supposed to use headphones with it, mind you it sounds pretty audible anyway, I don't think you need headphones, I mean I'm not sure there's a No See how she goes. Erm Thing is I've got to try by turning those volts down on some of them Yeah it's just that find out if there's any nails in the, in the wood. Possibly have stones You're not likely to get stones em embedded in the Oh I mean whether, whether that one is, is good enough for enough Mm, and it the nails in the wood that's all Oh yes it's, it's, how long ago was it when Robin bought that? Eleven or twelve wasn't he? Near that Say this er I think mm Have you actually got a plan drawn up with measurements, devised to the top and the base as well or are you going to do that when you I got the height of the base, you've seen that yes, yes Use that for the base obviously Muffin be quiet, what the devil's wrong with him? it's that much bigger so, you know just see how the top one goes and then I can copy that to the bottom Yeah, well you're going to do the base of it bigger aren't you? Yes Erm er the only, I'm not quite sure yet how the sides are going to and the door , the glass door he wanted it erm like the lead glass, oh similar to these Yes I know he wants it erm you know glazing bars Mm there's no way we could use it either of those, panels that were the glass panels that we've got in the garage, no, separate them, I mean it, they're not, they're not solid glass, they're two panes, which could be separated whether of ingenuity and What re-cut you mean? Well no not, not, well we could get them, I never thought of that Cut them they wouldn't be the exact size yes, ah that's a point now, I could take them down to erm, what's his name down the road and ask him, he's very obliging, ask him to cut them I don't know it depends er I was just thinking rather than having plain which you'd have to pay for anyway a plain piece of glass and, and er putting lead on it yourself I think that's a brilliant idea that. Well the idea is, is it's not so much the lead it suppose to be the bars, I don't know what they look like without old, old er it's a diamond , it's a diamond pattern isn't it for Yeah as opposed to the, but, but some cupboard doors are diamond pattern, Muffin will you be quiet have we any more bones cooked for them or have they had them all? No there's some there Cooked? oh that's what I mean, erm, well listen we'd better try and just, practice somehow and see erm what do you erm Are you gonna left that battery on well, well only temporarily, I only want this it's alright it's just this unit thing, when connected to right erm, just erm It just drops in there doesn't it, hanging oh I would of thought there was a rest for it surely, no? Do you think so? Just down the bottom Just down the bottom Right what you're going to have to do is erm Get a piece of wood with a nail in it Yeah, yeah I tell you what get a hold of that and put something underneath it. I don't know, it don't seem to react to that, that's a bit, mind you there again there's only going to be that there isn't it? Er, well, put it on the floor Go in your basket go on Yes, I cannot give it much more re-allocated, I might be able to get the two sides on, but I'll need more, obvious have some more wide bolts for the er top and the bottom So er, what you actually got to have it cut now, what have you? Those four Mm to that section of the oh these are about two inch are they or some, didn't say it wouldn't split in half went for it and Twelve inches across are they? That way They seemed quite wide to me when they were leaning against the wall. Wouldn't Sue do them? She hasn't got a hasn't she? I bet she had, I bet she had er no I know she's got a You really want one with a three I thought she had a band saw no I was gonna say you wobbling all over the place aren't you? And what about Duckman Peters wouldn't they do it for you? Er, mm, the other time I took stuff down there huge, to that their costs mm I'll have to pay mm you've got to pay for the teeth and the saw thirty pound a tooth Yeah, god worse than erm mm, how many have you got to now cut? and you mean to tell me with all that equipment the machine that they've got at the college, you couldn't get it done there? I haven't got anything that deep, the only goes to about five inches What can you do, can you do half at a time, can you No Why? at one time you could of done, but now, you've got to take the guards off To reverse them and turn it over Well I don't see how, all you've got to do is turn it upside down, you could still run it through the same way To make your first cut Yeah you have to take the guard off and the knife at the back of the saw, they, it is a bit dangerous, erm where's the guard goes at the top Mm just wouldn't go in would it, unless it's being stood right down Mm cut turn half way, the first cut, then turn it over with, you've got to have all the, just got a bit of the bare blade on the bench you see Yeah without a guard on it without a guard and they won't mm, mm allow that on this stand No I can understand that I suppose but there again it's only hand feed, you've, you got to have a, a machine that can feed on to take this tubing Something to grip it, mm We would have to like pull the wood through you see what about that erm, what about that other place that er timber place on the way to Kilkern erm we went there, you, oh you went in to ask about some walnut, do you remember when er Well er that's the same, that would be worth thinking this you know don't think you'd be very happy you know I mean you wouldn't wanna pay no be only worth a fiver to cut it, to them it's not worth Damaging them, saw, mm Well at least we've had a look at the whether we right OK, so we've eliminated all that have we? Well I mean What are you gonna do? I don't know It's impossible to do by hand No not impossible with a good saw Yeah and about ten irish navvies One down below and one above huh mm Try to get some er old door casings rip down from me you know, now, I was thinking of going to North Wales but I know what they'd say cos it, the ones that I got from our Rob's you know the they're quite clean but of course they've had nails in the, you know, the head like I made the cab some cabinets you know. I want them split down that road Which way? On the deep Oh on the deep two or three gorges Oh you want to fetch it down to a board technic That's so I can get two out of the one you know for the sides, erm, sides and Oh you want them to deep, deep, deep I don't think I'm gonna get that much joy myself, cos their reluctant aren't they to do anything that's not new. I thought there might be somewhere where they'd have an old circular saw you know, probably got a bit more chance with help, but they do a bit of rough cutting do you know what I mean? Yeah, but you won't get two out of it will you? But Well they're only for sides, you know, I'm, I'm doing them like er I the sides are coming out er like this you see those, those are already you know like that their fortunate with those I, I like them but, but I haven't got enough you see Yeah but er you won't get two that size will you? You reckon not, not with the cut, it's, well not that I know it's, it's got two it is a good er about one and five eighths Oh I say, yeah, you, well, you'll get one, you'll get a second one there, full one there Get a full one, get it doesn't matter really and I get one that width out of Yeah, yeah here you see and it'll all be joined up. It's, it's a band saw really that you want to put down Mm, they're not really safe Yeah, a band saw are you now are you? I got the old metal detected on, but, of course it could always be a bit of grit in it couldn't it Yeah or something like that. I know they don't like it No, er, no especially with a band saw, cos Oh hello Hello Margaret, well twenty years ago and, and, and they really had to and the whole band saw gotta to be resharpened he said and they go to a place in Most of them don't do their own now do they? No We used to have a shop you know, a saw doctor shop I when I had the time, did them all tension and set, you know, but erm, as you say now, they probably cost you about fifty pound a go every time they go away Yeah it's a I don't fancy doing by hand Well, even that little one of mine No I mean even with a hand saw, you know, I've done it before You had to wait, wait about twenty eight before you went on top I believe I don't know Yes, yes, oh yes and er all his brothers ev , every one of them went, they served their time and and er, it was er, the others were by having the lads and getting the trees down, er the extra wood that they got out of the er, out of the tree they lost so many with, with the thickness of the blade Oh I see, yes, yes, yeah, yeah that's right, yeah I think bloody hell, that must of been hard work that, they must of been at it all day Yeah, yeah How did they keep, how did they stop the flaming thing from snaking them all, you know? I don't know It must of had a good iron in it. Must of had terrific arms on them, oh dear me Yeah and I used to see them many a times in and what they'd leave them to what, then to, to dry wouldn't they at least? Oh I, yeah They'd take a long time to dry wouldn't they, then, on the sticks and that stacks of it and my father was in the woods before the war and they, he, he looked after the woods and cut the trees down and everything and then they were sent to Oh no, slowly, dried slowly you see Slowly to dry it was always as, as he went up to about a for pupation, yeah I'd like to seen how they did the, the ribbon book out of the heart Oh yes used to do a lot of drawer bottoms out of it yes must of had a knife or something to it, sliced wasn't it? Mind you I'm going, I've got a pub Nice to see there, there was a certain way of cutting the tree this is going back to get the figure into it I, a cut on the diagonal Yes you see, a diagonal, the raise so you've got a lovely figure in the, on the oak, Yeah but expensive that was yeah that's right cutting waste with it, as I say the ribbon stuff it must it, the georgian furniture you usually see that in Yeah this wide drawer bottoms you know, beautiful oak that's been sliced Yeah because that, presumably the heart was easier to cut, I don't know, very hard I wouldn't of thought so, it was I wouldn't of thought so the I'll have to find out of this where, where I found more so were that's the oldest part isn't it? That's the oldest part That's right on the knife and the er whether the grain was straighter, maybe that was the answer and the awkward thing was to hack a wood in the centre Yeah that's right, yeah, yeah An American oak is not too bad But the English you can end up doing a lot of scrapping for your finish Mm and it's just only because of the climate, there's er Cold weather, the, oh, is that what it was? That's right, yeah, he's, he's Mm, mm, funny there was a lad here this chap was here last week he bought this pine table up, got his key, and he'd been working for three years in Norway Oh yeah as a joiner Yeah and he was saying, told me some of the different names, you know, other than pine, I suppose their name for whatever these pines were, the timber there was beautiful Yeah the er all the knots, very few knots, just lovely yellow pine and er and they make all their furniture out of these pieces, so, he said that's what set me off on making furniture he said say that the cost of living there tremendous, tremendous ten years ago now they took out these tremendous mortgages because their wages had trebled, it, it about a ten year period, you know when the boom was on Yeah a few years ago, and he said er there was a lot of repossessions there. It's happening everywhere you see. You could buy a house very cheaply then, but er we, we didn't know what was going to happen that's not all you can do now is blame the Labour Party, it's incredible now. One of them said er when they start bringing the yes, yes that's right, lower lowering the taxes Everybody come here, this is the place to run a big business Yeah cheap labour Yeah you can fiddle all you want, get away with it, er I Well Nor you can't help me on this me old son Er it's a shame really, no he bought about erm I'm not even gonna volunteer to do about erm ten of these and then the head So apart from those three we said what else is there Ma No, well he's got a catalogue and we can send No, that, that catalogue he had I rang them and he sent me one Beeswax was it? Pure beeswax, what else? I bet that was a It was pure restoration materials Yes I've forgotten now I'm sure that's where he said he got it from the wax He said he got his waxes fifteen years ago and he's still using them Oh I think he gets all his stuff from that guy at, he got the brochure didn't he from somewhere up North? Yes, well Molly's just said she's rung them Well yeah, well I've got the brochure Oh I rang them up, it's, it's Bolton, but they don't do wax, they do all the other waxes Bury isn't it? Well I'd try Time and Bury the one? They caught , I don't, yeah actually the address I had Yes. Oh well I'll, I'll look, I'll ring I didn't actually ring I'll find out anyway them up and ask them and actually you know this Time Chemicals, they, they deliver you know, they come here with the stuff. Do they? Just ring them up, oh yeah, they go anywhere. What is the recipe I Bury ,, Bury Mm That's a good one isn't it, dear me, that's er Oh no, but, they, they will post it Post it, but then they're gonna charge aren't they? Oh yeah VAT and for a small amount it's not worth it really One of the dogs gone down there? I am sick and tired of picking up the mud Hello Ken Oh, we're trying to see if any pick up the nails in the wall, you know those boards trying to get them split down you see to make some, you know, shelves and that No, not really Does it work? It's got the battery in it Well I'm not sure really it didn't seem to go to good on the cast iron nails you know the long ones Yeah It's alright on the on the erm Well I don't know until the, when it comes to college you've got a hand one That's what I was gonna say Yeah it's a, it must be a sensitive one you see but er Yeah But erm, not reliable enough on that anyway So anyway Norm mentioned about going to this one at erm Old Tammy, that one on the Old Road Yeah he said try there, they've got some old wood he said, well perhaps they're used to cutting all stuff Oh oh dear then you will be whether you'll get that rate You're not very choosy money for them sort of things Yeah that's the way I look at it. There's no other way No, no, no, he does so many days Ken Is he full time or what? What? Is who full time? He can't be full time otherwise he wouldn't have enough to do would he? I don't know perhaps he does, I don't actually know Ken, I thought the way he was talking though that this chap No, it's, it's so many days that they work innit? had actually taken him on that he used to know years ago and had finished the Oh he's finished the I know it's a couple of years ago before he came here Oh but this chap he's known for years mention the name he gave him a job, er erm, but I mean I, I was given to believe he was full time he never said oh it's so many days cost I think that Let's have a look Now there's this place up, remember that French polish it's got a big order right, erm , where's this beeswax? They're all in one together er It's the same one, is it, are the, is that an update? That's the different prices Oh these are, I see, yes, yes, yes Brunches, no, ah it'd be a That's three seventy eight for five hundred grammes, and five hundred grammes is just over a pound. Five oh, oh that's not bad. It is low, it's a pound and a tenth It can't be right fourteen pound a pound can it? That's wrong A kilo's five fifty Perhaps he meant five hundred pounds you think or whatever Don't know erm a mahogany cost so much more a mahogany, oh gee whiz Yeah but she said that they were the same price Oh no but erm, she's got mixed up good grief what is that I wonder? I don't know, fifty pence gee, grief, that's six times as much , you'd have to have something for brown stains wouldn't you, you couldn't just use them er hand like, but, but is brown mind you but erm Pittance What about the erm,be you know beeswax, beeswax have you got that? yeah it's in here There you are, oh that's a one that's made up Here we are Oh yes I said the grey colour is alright That's the one we want is it? Yeah That's half a kilo, six eighty but we found that the yellow was purified, you know, it's, it's What about the oth the erm , what is it the pure beeswax He just says beeswax doesn't he in his yeah yellow beeswax Yellow is it? I see, yes, yes er and, and what about the paraffin? And the paraffin ones , little colour That's cheap Yeah Oh well oh well I think that er would be a good proportion to er Morell's, but then we got to, anyway, excuse me I must go somewhere. Hello you Lucy-woosy, hello there Lucy-woosy, yeah, ooh, you're a lovely girl you oop Right I want all that lot cut up for Right so all you need is a good saw and a ha , ten Irish navvies. Ah I done this I said I said to Norm I cut some walnut not, not that long of course from the deep Did he do it? He didn't do it No, no He, he had a lot of machinery actually years ago he, before he moved here he sold Oh Norm yes at his old place, he had er He sold er most of it three machines a great big saw and because he didn't have the room for it here and all this but er he had a business Well when he had it He's got a lot to do now you see when you've done it all, I suppose you could get a bit further with his yeah but he's got to the stage now as if yeah he's not gonna do a lot, whatever he did before at home I'm not sure but er he's done all his windows and stuff like that but I think then again he can do a lot at work you see. Yeah Cutting and all this Yeah there's the machine, he done it, bring it home and assemble it so, not too much on the heavy side. Yeah, but I mean he's done all his windows hasn't he, he's adapted all his windows from that er Yeah, oh yeah from that frame he's bought, so he's done quite well really Yeah eh we could have a ah? with you underneath I'll hold the saw, I wouldn't push it oh one of those pits yeah There's no need for the pits, we can have a series of trestle Yeah out in the fresh air and have to Yeah had to blow the dust off you I well, and Margaret could even go Yes, I'm good at that every time I done the down stroke Yes Sounds a bit like that idea? Eh? Do you like that? I like that idea of that, but er get somebody else underneath Get another volunteer Yeah Dogs get the dogs there's a system there with a, a bone, every time you move that you'd move a bone and they'd go down They'd have to go down to the the one on the top they keep pulling back up, you wouldn't have to strained any energy going back up Have you got your grandchildren Easter eggs yet chaps? Er, I sent some money down for Bethan and Kaylie Yeah er I just wondered if you'd remember, you know when I sent Bethan her birthday card down there, I sent some money for her Yeah and I sent some money for, but I mentioned it to Peter Yeah before they went back, and er, I can't remember whether I told them to get one or whether they should be up for Easter. Well they could, they're moving up here aren't they Yeah, so time, so I tell you what I can't do, I can't find, I can't find Charles' birthday on me calendar Oh, well I said This is the other thing you've got to start remembering innit Marg? when we were at Carrie's at the weekend I said you must tell me all the birthdays again, because I can't find them.

I was cleaning it up, I mean it dropped off there and it didn't break So have you still got it have you? I was cleaning, cleaning it up and of course I was tapping it with a hammer wasn't I to try and get all the putty you know, try and break the putty and most of it came away and I just tapped this one little One last fatal tap one little piece came Mm I wonder what erm stuff for the cars do Ken? As it happens Yes What Great to fill it up to fill put a lamp on either side you know and put some in a crack, a lump either side You can buy all kinds of filler now it should do anything, indoors or outdoors I was surprised can't you? I mean Oh well this is for different kinds of metal you see They do? I know down at Evans I've noticed quite a few things in there, there are different mm you know for, for different jobs For who? For you, it's easy for you who to say Yeah, but er, this is usually you've got to work on top of course you've gotta Eh, no I mean I've gotta dark that Oh you've got it off Oh it fell off didn't it. Oh I see. So it's been in the garage for years? No it's only, it only came off doing that, putting that wire round for the aerial. You should ruddy well call them back to get it they caused the damage or failing that, claim on the insurance mind you they'd probably say well you must get in touch with the company that did the job. Well the trouble is you can probably get I mean if somebody replace a whole puts an aerial on your roof and they knock a hole in your roof then presumably they're liable for the damage Oh yes yes, third party isn't it? having said that it's getting them, getting them back isn't it to do it what was I gonna say before I started saying something did you What's that? oh did you see that film? That was it, did you see that film Blocking It with erm Dennis Weaver McCloud Weaver Weaver, he played McCloud about the chap that couldn't read I thought it was Dennis Weaver not Dennis, I thought it, what's his name McCloud. No we, he played McCloud Oh it is the same one yeah Yeah No, I, I, no Do you want to borrow, well it's on two tapes, well I've still got it on the tapes if you want it, it's quite a good quite a good film yeah, you, you, oh you taped it when I was here it's quite a good film Is it? Yeah, so I mean you'll have to find a spot on the film where it It's a good castrating because it used to be a bit of a this is a film You, have you ever had what's is name back, did I give you what's is name back? Yes, yes What's that? the erm Dances With Wolves Wolves, we did enjoy it erm Bob thoroughly enjoyed it I think that's the first part and I think it's ready to go on there, erm So that's er the one with the photograph on yes That's right and the other, the rest of it is on the end of that, but I've wound it almost back to the beginning, that's Fantasia at the beginning of the tape Oh I don't want to see that which is about two hours long so I don't want so you'll have to fast forward it and suffer the last hour Well it was once , once, I couldn't see it again, but the music was beautiful of course, but then Fantasia? whether you want to listen to I mean as you say the music, yes, but the, all the props in it, no You scalpel It was great, but it was I mean, I, I have to watch it because I'd never seen it before ain't you? Eh, mm and I thought I'd watch it now I saw it as a kid Did you? I, I don't ever remember cos I couldn't Yeah, it might be, yeah, it could of been a bit overpowering I think. Did Kelly's kids watch it? Yes they have seen it, yeah, I said to Carrie have you watched it What do they say? What did they say? Did they pay Cos I much attention to it or did they, distract er well I didn't go into details see it's not their scene but er I mean they wouldn't want to listen to the music I don't think I think er she said some of it was a bit you know slow and dragging for them Yeah I mean er there was some of the music which wasn't our Oh some of the music is a bit heavy too. yeah, and You know out of your seats especially I mean ob , obviously the er, the lights of spring and the er dances of very nice oh there's some lovely music in it. We all know this but but er the sorcerer is some of it is very clever some of it, the effects and when you think back to nineteen forty one whichever Oh yeah, oh it was marvellous, but I mean it's You'd never get away with it today It was popular in the cinema's wasn't it? you couldn't make it today and get away with it oh, it just wouldn't at all well I mean and of course you'd, you watch it over sort of sentimental or what have you, but I, I couldn't watch it again I don't think. I can listen to the music Well that's why, that's why I said well we would I was gonna say I mean, yeah keep it on tape because I haven't got some of the music but yeah that's true we've got them on record , but erm, no it's erm It's not And of course it was Stokowski was the conductor you see Yeah he was a big name at the time, Laepol Stokowski Yeah but erm, I imagine what's his name wouldn't do it, Walt Disney Oh good heavens no, I mean Walt Disney the M B C Mind that plant behind you. Oh it was very good. What's this one about erm Well I, I hadn't heard of it on the telly, I with you yesterday, Jessica Tandy, erm Green Tomatoes Oh yes, yes Cafe or something yes Look at this, it ain't very good a peculiar title Oh she's How, how old is she, she's about eighty isn't she? Private, she's eighty odd She's ninety two she is now, ninety two Is she ninety two? It's incredible I heard her on the radio, she sounded very allusive She was before the war Yeah she was in the The Birds, wasn't she that film called The Birds That's right, yeah, yeah only a small role in that but she sort of had a late arrival But she's the what's it, what, said like she was the toast of America for years Mm in the, in the, on the stage Oh on the stage, yeah, but in films she came in later and only had small parts and never made yeah, yeah much impact until this, one about the chauffeur did she Yeah Driving Miss Daisy Yeah Driving Miss Daisy yeah, have you seen that? I have Have you seen it? I enjoyed that, yeah Did you see it at the cinema or on video? No on video, I, I saw that Oh it's er, I, well I enjoyed it I was gonna say it has to vary to It's, you know I mean it's a bit predictable and all that really, but Entertaining, mm it was er She's in that wasn't she er Kelly Maguinness about the Macarthy business that She said the play is erm The House on Carol Street was it? Yeah Oh er, The House on yes I think it was Carol Street wasn't it? she was the old lady that sort of let to read to her That's right she goes to read to you, yeah mm, then again she didn't have much of a part in that She didn't, she's no in a play isn't she? A play What in London now er, a It's on er one, either this one or somebody else, being interviewed no she was sit in this what play is that I'm sure she said she was in a play Well I, I know she said while she was over here, she's just Oh she was er, in a, in a promoting a film perhaps, I don't think she's in a no she didn't, it was promoting, I don't know whether she was in the television one, but I'm sure she said she's work, she was working, you know she was over here to work Mm, I know it, she was with her husband because erm whoever it was Yes, it was who interviewed her How old is he? I can't remember who it was now, but they said have you been, have you seen this, have you done that, which she said no she hasn't, I think she'd only just arrived some, some time last week didn't she? Yeah But er, mm but er I wouldn't of thought she She's got very severe though hasn't she, you, never comes over erm a sympathetic character, she's always playing the The more austere types Like that one in Carol Street that was a type she played that one Yes that's her role in always thought of rebuking the girl, so Mm the slightest thing and Yeah very little humour But then that was the role she played obviously Well that's it Well she's a bit like that in Driving Miss Daisy I think isn't she? I've no idea. Mm, well I'm only going by cuts I've seen, but same type of role I suppose. So what have you decided to do about these damn boards? I thought I would go and take one of the head ones and journey along down to that place and so, you know, is there any chance you slipping me down a good four long ones and if he says no, think again? Mm, see how many Well and Aaron had a bit of a er an argument at one point , Oh. and it was a pain cos When doesn't Whit have an argument? What were Well they arguing about this time? Well they were being Whit was being unpleasant about Aaron, which is calls made from non-local phone calls In fact local c phone calls as Whit t to you know to make comments Yes. about his appearance or whatever. But it was because Aaron said a mildly humorous comment about somebody in one of Whit's photos who turned out to be one of Whit's very good friends. And er Well so what? She does look strange cos she's got bright white hair and purple lipstick on.. Oh right. Sorry, but it's true!. . Erm yeah. That's getting off the subject a bit but never mind. Okay. Anyway yes, Whit's going to us at some stage and I will wander round town while he's doing his talk and then transcribe it Right. so I only have to once . Can erm one of you look in this week's Advertiser, and any sort of talks and things that are on this week if they've got a phone number to contact, give them a buzz and see if they mind us recording it. Derek? There are some talks happening this week. Is it It's the Advertiser that have the What's On section. That was it. Erm Unfortunately that's last week's.

Erm I don't know when They they they play it about quarter past er no about quarter to seven Mm. and then they I think they play it earlier than that as well. That's . Erm It's best to find them ahead of time because that gives us a chance to contact them beforehand. Yes. Yes. I think it's unfair to anybody to show up with a tape recorder and ask them on the spot cos it puts them on the spot. Yes. Erm I don't like putting people on the spot if I can possibly No. avoid it cos you know you lose goodwill that way. Erm Erm but But the Advertiser does have quite a lot of What's Onies. What's Onies? What the hell's a What's Ony? . Erm . Sorry. Just for the record , Yes. is that I E S or I S? I have not the remotest idea David . . I'm so sorry. . It's probably E S actually cos it was it was me trying trying to find a plural for Ah. What's On.. I I th I thought I thought it was I S actually from the way you said it the first time, but that was just a guess. No comment. Not a guess it's Well how do you say erm the plural of bus? Buses. Buses, yeah. Sounds like an I S . Busi. Octopodes. . Octopodes,yes. It's the correct plural of octopus. Eddie found it out one time. It thought it was octopi. You just went past it. I did? Yeah. Yes.

I'll I'll get my a disk to you and some Right. notepaper and stuff. Right. . Actually erm But I should probably do that when I can come and see you and show you where it Yeah. needs to sit in the printer and things like that erm so you don't you know Right. end up fiddling with for hours on end to work out . Okay. I I will be home erm I'll be home at my house as opposed to here erm tomorrow afternoon as from about four o'clock I would imagine. Right. You're on Road. Lane. Lane. Lane?

What's I can't picture it, so what's the address? It's thirty eight Lane. Thirty eight Lane. Well why don't I pop round tomorrow? Sure thing. At the end of If I w wait until the end of the business day, so Mm. around five or so. Er Yeah. Between four and five you will definitely find me indoors, and I will be at home. Right. Okay. Well if I say I'll come at five, cos that gives me a chance to do all the sort of phoning Yeah. of businesses. Great. Right. Erm Okey-doke. . And if you can remember to bring me some headed notepaper as well, so Th er I haven't actually Yeah I'll bring you some headed notepaper but you shouldn't actually need it except if people want This person is doing this on behalf of. Right. Erm all the other stuff I've just got a little header set up in the file on Right. on a template. Yeah. The you know the the little header. Mm. I'm going to have some headed notepaper as soon as I can get the laser printer printing out things that I tell it to rather than printing out Courier Ten. I'm having a bit of trouble with Spike's laser printer at work cos it's not a real It it says it's a Hewlett-Packard Two Plus but it ain't. Oh. Mm. So It's actually a Panasonic something and I haven't got the printer driver for it. Okay . And I can't phone up WordPerfect Corp and say Mm. . Can I buy a printer driver for this? because they'll say What's your registration number? they'll say What's your registration number? and I'll say I haven't got one yet because I can't afford to buy er a non-pirate copy of WordPerfect until next month. Sorry. . Mm. But er anyone who feels like making a headed notepaper and getting it laser printed is welcome so to do. Alright. Well erm Well when we've got a company logo we should do that. I've got a company logo. It looks like this. There is a company lob =go. It's dead pretty . Lobo? Here we go. Company lobo.. Lobo, yeah. . Let's get one of those. . Sometimes I feel I could do with one . . Yes. Aha.. Mm. Oh it Lovely. it's just that it's the It looks sort of Erm what we really need er . Erm But there there's no The problem is we can't use the can't use the CompServe one. Er you could you could print one off. Erm We'd only need one . For a start erm the typeface we wanted It looks something like that. The type face we wanted isn't on the the whatsit laser printer. I'd also like it in shadow . if at all possible. Oh, yeah. Er the other thing is So i i it's a standard you know dinky little thing like y you us you use You know the with their little twirly thing and er the you saw the Oh no. Productions with their little red triangle and dots thing . No I think I think the word is quite adequate actually . Yeah. That's great. Y Fine. the fancy letters the M and the T really need a powerful pack like CorelDraw. Yeah. Which . Eddie ! Eddie! Erm Who doesn't have a laser printer. Yes, No, but but he can do the But does have CorelDraw. He does have CorelDraw and erm CorelDraw would use P Postscript erm which we can import onto the P Cs and dump onto the self-service laser printer. Erm And a partridge in a pear tree. . I assume you understand what all that means . At the university. . . I know what it means. Erm Erm Well you've got But it does require me going to see Eddie. Erm I'd like to see Eddie cos I didn't get to see him this time or last time . Well we could we could arrange to drive over Well Eddie's going to be And see Eddie. Yeah Eddie is going to be busy the whole time Aha. because he's working for his course. He has Mm. er course work to do the whole time. But erm I can phone him er Have you got his number as well? Mm. Right, okay. Well you could phone him if you Mm. wanted. Erm and we could say We we need a company logo done. Cos i if we said we we needed it in order to get some of this money Yeah. that he's going to get some of then erm that might more of an incentive for him to Well he might for instance let us come over and and play with CorelDraw for an hour in one evening or something like that. How long do you think it would take you to do that on CorelDraw? Erm Our resident CorelDraw expert. I could I could do that in an hour. I could d I could do a complete letterhead and just that just that logo as an E P S F that you could stick into WordPerfect. Mm. Ooh. Erm Right. Ooh. Ooh. Er Then all I need to do is to find a printer driver for Spike's laser printer at work Erm well er if it was E P S F you almost certainly could use . That's true. . . Which that isn't. But But the University have Wor WordPerfect don't they? Online. Yes. The university have WordPerfect Yes. on the machines. Yes. So This could work couldn't it? Could work . Yes. Okay. It's a cunning plan. It is actually. I have a cunning plan My Lord . Let's get let's just get it on though. . Erm okay let's get Eddie Erm I I reckon I reckon I could do it in an hour. Erm The thing is if we can get that erm and We can al we could also put it on business cards is another thing . Mm. I can go and get a run of business cards done at some point. Mm. Ooh that's something Erm else I have to do is find a somebody that'll do cheap photocopying. Get like an account with somebody. u w Erm I mean it really requires a P C and a copy of CorelDraw. Erm however I've got A P C. You have a P C. Erm But I'd Er however I'm running low on memory now . . Yes. Erm And I can't yet afford a P C. Erm Mm.. I can't afford a new copy of CorelDraw. However I might be able to get erm the copy that I Eddie's copy isn't entirely legal erm and I got it for him. I might be able to get another copy of it. . How big is it? I mean is it a massive program? I imagine it'd be quite huge . Erm it it was compressed onto six disks. . But that includes three I think three disks were full of erm Sample stuff isn't it. clip-art. Which we don't need. Mm. Erm Yeah. we don't need any clip-art. Erm Which means it's on three disks . Can it run off the disks? Can it run off No. It can't. Be Because it's compressed. Because it's compressed. Erm I mean how big But you don't need to keep it. Well, how big will that decompress into? Erm Well the total amount on three disks is what, two meg ? If I have it I'd wanna keep it. You know what I'm like. I haven't got two meg of memory. I've got about a meg and a half. And that that fills up my hard disk. Well that Aha. So that Right. you couldn't use it. It fills it up Yeah. too much to be used. Right. Erm And that's including my on-disk compression thing that that erm Oh dear. Oh. fiddles around with Dear. all sort of crap. Right. Erm Well that Actually that's on my disk cos we did have two the the disk partitioned and it's my half of it that's got a meg and a half left. I don't know what Spike's half's got left. . But er probably not very much . Knowing Spike not much. . Knowing Spike it's probably not much. . However Okay. I'll speak to Simon. I'll speak to Simon erm about borrowing his P C at work. Doug has a P C. Right. Okay. Doug has a P C. I will Go get Doug, see what he's Yeah. Just see how much space he's got. Erm And tell him it's temporary. Yeah. And I'll see if I can get a copy of CorelDraw. Because it will be a lot easier than going over to Bradford. Erm Yeah. Although it would be nice to go over to Bradford. Yes. And it means that we could make changes if we needed to. That's true. Yes. Er Er now, the source was at university which means that he's gone gone home. He's at Court, he might not have gone home. Not Court, erm House. Might not have gone home. I thought they were planning to er make term time only. . No idea. I don't know. Erm I'll see Erm I know that Richard has a copy of that and Eddie has a copy . Mm. I'll see what I can do. Right. Erm I will buy a copy of it when I have access to a P C. Erm erm How much is it? The new one is about two hundred and sixty pounds . for the big one. Er a hundred and ninety five for the smaller version which doesn't have a . It's a bit excessive. But it's the best package in existence. Mm. They've got it at the Law College and I've I've spent some lunchtimes fiddling with it and thinking I want! I want! I want! It's very easy to do pretty things with it. Mm. Did you did Wasn't it CorelDraw that you guys used to make the erm badge for our Cop Two Thousand game? Erm yes. Eddie did that, yes. Mm. Yes I've still got that somewhere. Erm In fact I may even have them be in here. . No they're not. They were really good. Doug's P C isn't suitable because the monitor's crap. Steer's . P C would possibly get it . In what sense is the monitor crap? Er it won't do colour, erm It doesn't need to. It's a black and white logo. it it it it it's it's it's also got a erm er It's got no mouse for the computer. It's Anyway Steer's might get it running, Okay. er but there're some really nifty ones in the Chemistry Department which cou Doug could borrow for an hour and a half of an evening. So. I'm not a fr free in the evening. No. We need it Yeah. er when Derek when But David's free. But weekend? Maybe, yeah. Yeah. Cos er an hour and a half on a Saturday evening. We could manage it. Mm. Erm We can get a P C If we can do this ourselves I'd really like to . Yes. Erm cos Er I I definitely don't wanna pay you know somebody Yeah. like sixty quid just to make a logo that we can do ourselves. Yeah. Yeah. Th there is no w er problem whatsoever about getting a P C which is of suitable capability. Right. And we just need Doug to be around t Well. If erm Or if Simon can bring one home from work . Doug's Doug's machine has reasonably high graphics doesn't it? It's not C G A? Er no, Doug's machine is crap. Steer's is quite good as far as I can tell. Er erm . I've got a V G A. bloody space. I dunno, I could I could back up and remove WordPerfect, which frees about another meg and a half of memory . Erm well it it was on It was compressed onto three disks, so I guess it's probably going to be about four meg. Mm. Well. Doug's machine has four and a half meg free. It doesn't need a mouse and it will run on a C G A. Erm Well, I think it might work then. But I can't guarantee it. Suck it and see as my Grandmother used to say to me.. Indeed. Okay, Pardon? I'll chase that up this week cos it won't take . What did she use to say? Suck it and see. . Don't tell that to Spike!. . Bless him! . Erm . Moving quickly on.

Erm Er in fact it would take an entire evening to go out to Keighley. It's a bloody long way. Whereas it's Yeah. it's a lot more convenient . could come round here Mm. . Mm. Erm I mean it'll take a while to install . Mm. Waiting for the program to install. Right. Well I'll leave that with you to see what what comes out. But I mean in the meantime we're quite happy quite happy carrying with with the silly little letterhead that I've got cos it says Yeah. who we are. It's just I'd like something printed . What about the P Cs in the P C room in Langwith? Erm All you need's a Vax account. Yeah but they don't have very much memory in them. They don't have enough memory in them to load up very much. And you can't put it on c you can't put it If you if you network them you've got hardly any, and even er unnetworked I think they've only got two meg. But you can't do something clever like dump it all onto my scratch quota for example? No. Erm Okay. Ah well.

Birmingham Polytechnic offer all their facilities absolutely free of charge to us so get yourself down in the entertainment bar in Aston. Er make full use of all their fields as well as their indoor gyms, leisure centre, swimming pool etcetera. Birmingham University don't let us use their stuff free of charge. Er it's thirty six pound a year to be a member there but if you are a keen sportsman their facilities are well worth using because it's a very very good sports centre indeed. Aston University haven't got an awful lot of good stuff in the way of indoor facilities. They've got a good seven a side outdoor astroturf pitch which we can hire fairly cheaply. But er I wouldn't recommend that too highly . Sporting teams, you all look a sporting bunch to me specially that chubby chap there in the middle er I've got contacts with not only all the local football, rugby, cricket clubs etcetera, but also the teams that sort of how do I put this represent people in er the city on, on a, a good sporting level, I E Mosely Rugby Club, Aston Villa Football Club, so whatever your standard is in any sport come and see me and I shall sort out exactly what you want. Of course the college has its own teams as well. Er football, rugby basketball are popular ones. Er any team that you do want to join, there is also a team available. If you actually want to set up the society yourself, find ten little friends, come along, ten people giving the number you need to form a society one pound each for membership, I shall give you all the er relevant data and you can start up your side in whatever it be as long as it doesn't contravene union policy on sexism, racism etcetera. And I'm sure you wouldn't. Er that's briefly enough on sport, I'm gonna move on to entertainment facilities now. The bar, the guild bar downstairs currently not open at the moment I grant you, but hopefully, with a bit of luck, tonight is the grand opening tonight. And what a wonderful place, what more can be said about the bar? Free with your guild card which you will carry with you everywhere I know, cheap beer, brilliant atmosphere, incredibly good DJs erm we're always looking for people to come along and have a go so if you wanna put your name down you can have a Saturday night and spin those wheels. excellent atmosphere, friendly barmen He's alright your friend there. He's just a bit grumpy, he's a bit grumpy at times, excellent barmen er I'm usually down there s sampling the, the Diet Coke or some such wondrous thing like that. Er and you will definitely get to know lots of people down there and it's a good focal point for the Guild. I must point out about isn't just the Guild a lot of people think it is but it is a good focal point to find out what's going on and meet people. Er on a slightly bigger scale entertainment again as we're only a small college, we do tend to liaise with the bigger education establishment in the city, I E Birmingham University, Central England University formerly Birmingham Polytechnic and Aston University. They have fairly regularly staged, what you might call bigger bands who play the university circuit as such and they're always, you know, dying for people to come along so there'll,th there'll be lists published at what time, what events are on at these places if you wanna go and do that and if you wanna go to the top notch bands, Birmingham's a good venue for that with the Leisure Centre, the M I A the N E C, the K G B etcetera etcetera all that stuff there so there's always plenty to do, don't, don't feel restricted just cos we're in er the middle of the city centre in this college and there doesn't seem a lot to do, there's a lot going on. A free legal service is offered by the Guild. It's a, a firm of city centre solicitors, they're very very good indeed er I recommend it thoroughly. It er doesn't have to be a problem related to college, any problem you've got er come and see me, it's as well to take advantage of it cos those of you who have been involved in legal wranglings before will it's quite an expensive business, so I mean you'll have to come and see me about that because it's fairly confidential so but they are very very good. Er what else can I go on about? Representation. Now there's a long word for you. Erm my job, I, I'm employed by the Union of Students which you have all paid your subscription to so therefore, in effect, you're all my bosses. I'm here to represent you basically as, as your voice with any problem you have, as I mentioned at the beginning. a problem is a, a lecture, a lecturer, other students, anything of the college er I'm the person who takes your voice. Now you're you're welcome to register a complaint yourself but I, I'm a representative on the Board of Governors, the Academic Board Committee etcetera etcetera so I can get these points right up where they belong. I can also, if I erm come across the same problem a few times I could hopefully work on that and then probably eradicate altogether. So do come and see me if it's a problem you've got that you think needs sorting out. Er again on the national level, if you think there's a, a campaign you wanna be involved in or wanna get started I'll put that on to the area N U S who will, if it's a credible case, will put it forward to the National Executive. But I'm really the person to come and see and I liaise with all these bodies as such. The annual general meeting our A G M is next week where, where we, we elect all the officers, the Guild officers, who will serve with me, and help me on the forthcoming year. There are eight positions up for grabs which are vice president, sports officer, entertainments officer publicity officer, welfare officer, women's officer and minorities and overseas officer. If you're interested in standing for any of those or wanna put someone forward to stand for one of those, come to the elections in room six two three, six two four Friday the twenty sixth at two fifteen twenty third, I'm sorry, at two fifteen and er not only will you get all the, the general info about what I've done so far this year, what I intend to do, what next year's budget's going to be etcetera, that's when those elections are actually held. So do come along to that. I'll leave it at the moment, I know you've now got a very busy day ahead of you lectures to attend and such things like that but er has anybody got a question or two they'd like to ask me concerning anything? Don't all rush at once. This man here. What's your question sir? Do the Guild offer a typing services? Not free of charge. There are, though, numerous students on certain of the third year and degree courses who are trying to earn a little extra income shall I put it and far from the majority of traditional methods they are to do it legally and set up little typewriting agencies etcetera and if you keep your eye on the notice boards you'll see various . For instance, you know, contact Carol H N D three F er for typing servi they're not free,th they're dirt cheap, about twenty P a page for A four. That's quite a bargain. Why, don't you like typing? No. rugby. No. Where can you play rugby? I shall, shall get in touch with Mosely Rugby Club for you. Thank you. It's taken me long enough god knows but I'll get in touch with them for oh dear I'll get in touch with them for you. round the corner no doubt I'm sure. Indeed.

You may have already saying that Mrs attended recently. She has a black and she asking about . turned septic. She's quite worried crusting and discharge but she's having . In fact been treatment with antibiotics and cream . However, she . I feel that she would Yes. Well I was born, born at in nineteen eleven. So it's quite a long while ago and I've travelled round quite a bit since then. My father was a Methodist minister. So we moved round every three or at the most four years, and er we we've been up in Scotland and er Yorkshire, Lancashire, and down East Anglia. And er it wasn't until he came up to a, er in the Skegness circuit when I was eighteen that's when I started nursing. And erm I ca I came to in the first place because it was the best teaching hospital in the Midlands at that time. And er it was near home as well so I, I should be able to get home for days off. That was the, the main thing. Oh was that, that was nice. Erm could you tell me about your father being a Methodist minister? He was, was he just moved on from time to time, or were they voluntary moves? No er in the Methodist er ci circuits they move them on, they're, they're invited for three years. Least they were at that time. And then at the end of the three years you were either invited to stay an, an extra year or s you were, you were sort of er you had an invitation from some other circuit. To go there. They used to send the stewards round and er you you'd suddenly see two new people in the congregation and they'd come to hear the minister preach to see if he was a good preacher and then they'd go back to report. A and then he would either have an official invitation or should hear no more about it . But that was very difficult from th the children's point of view. There were, there were two erm boarding schools for Methodist ministers' children. There was for boys and for girls. Er and you could go to a boarding school but if you didn't you were moved round every three or four years at the most to a different school. Er and my brother went to a boarding school but I didn't. And I've, it was always a big handicap because the syllabuses at different schools were different. You'd go to a school where they'd been doing French or Latin for two or three years and you hadn't done any at all. It was very very difficult. So I, I can't really say my school days were the happiest days, they certainly weren't. Mm. Was there any reason why your brother was sent to a boarding school but you weren't? Well not really. Boys in those days they were always given the best education. Girls it wasn't nearly so important that they should be er er an and also I, I don't think my parents thought I was really worth educating . They didn't think I was very bright or very brainy. I was a very er quiet child and er very little self confidence. I think that was a lot of it. And they didn't expect very much of me from my school reports and I thought, well if they didn't expect I you know I wasn't capable of it. And it wasn't really until I left school and er went into nursing that I thought, now this is something I'm starting on ev even with everybody else. Er and something I really wanted to do, and really enjoyed. Th that's where I, I really started in and sort of showed what I was made of. I could come out top in my exams then when I never did at school, I never did anything much at school at all. Do you think this was er special to your family that you were treated as you weren't a brainy one or do you think that was the way girls were generally treated? I, I think it was largely the way most girls were treated. Th you know it was just the sort of it, it all changed after the First World War and completely changed after the Second World War. Before then you, you were sort of, you were a girl. You stayed at home and helped in the home until you were old enough. Then you got married then and that was sort of the sum total of it. And it wasn't really until after the First World War when things really sort of er got started and er women sort of carried on and, and they do take jobs and occupations er that they sort of really came into their own. And certainly during the Second World War where they kept things going an and could prove that they were as good as any man . But even until ooh when, I, I can remember my daughter when she er was going to university. There were certain subjects that they said, keep off, because it doesn't matter how clever you are. It doesn't matter how good a degree you get. It will go for nothing. If a man applies and he, even if he hasn't got as good qualifications as y as you've got, you won't have a, stand an earthly. The man will always get the job. Well that has changed a lot now and I think it i it, it is a good thing as well. Do you think you were conscious as a child at the difference between the way your brother was treated and the way yourself? No. I think I just accepted it. He was younger than I was. Er he was a delicate baby and I was always the sturdy one and I was always expected to give in to him and sort of coddle him an an he, he, he was always sort of put first. I never minded at all. No. It didn't bother me. I think most people were the same in those days. Did you have to help around the house when you were a child? Not a great deal. We, we were expected, we did, we were expected to keep our own rooms tidy. And make our own beds but not, not a great deal. You see in those days i people i servants were so you could get servants so easily ev even if you didn't have somebody living in er you, you'd have a daily person. They saw to all the washing up. Er and that sort of thing. But no we weren't expected to do a lot in the house. Mm. So did you generally have a, a daily lady to come and help or Yes. We did. When we were about nine and ten and a half we had somebody living in because there were an awful lot of evening meetings that my father had to go to and usually mother went with him. Which meant we'd always got somebody in the house, sort of baby-sitting really. That, that's her main, she used to sort of look after things and baby-sit for us in the evenings. Ha have you got any particular memories of your earliest childhood? Not a great deal. I, I can remember we were at in Lancashire. That was during the First World War, I should be I suppose about five then. Er we er my father was chaplain to a big military hospital there. And it was always sort of open house and the nurses used to come in when they were off duty a lot. And oh the, the soldiers, the wounded soldiers, they used to come as well. You could always tell who they were. They had sort of er er rather pretty blue er suits they used to wear with white shirts and red ties. You could always tell they were, they were er they'd been wounded and, and they were i in hospital by their dress. And they used to come in a lot. An and I think of course we were made quite a fuss of too. Er and I, I don't know whether that was where I got my first idea of being a nurse. I never wanted to be anything else but a nurse. It was the one thing I always wanted to do. I never wanted to do anything, it never entered my head to do anything else. Er so whether I unconsciously got it from there, I, I don't really know, I may have done. Yes. Were there any other family infu influences at all in this line? I know on your wall here you, you have a lovely portrait of your grandfather and grandmother. Yes, yes. Th they influenced my life a, a lot. My mother died when I'd be about eleven. And er course summer holidays we always used to go and spend them with granny and granddad. They had retired and they lived down at Lowestoft so it was a lovely place to go for summer holidays. And we always used to go there. Er and they did, they influenced, they influenced er me a lot, a lot really and I suppose they did my brother as well. But er we, we could always ask granddad if we wanted to know anything. How babies were born or, or anything. We always go and ask granddad. And he'd never tell us, he, he'd never, he'd always tell us as much as he thought we could accept. He was very modern really for his age,fo for er the time he lived in really. Cos in those days they didn't. I mean it just wasn't talked about. You, you, you, you, girls used to get married in those days, and they were extremely innocent, they'd really no idea at all. And yo when I look back an and er and think of even when I first started nursing a lot of the girls we used to get in, they thought if they kissed a man they were going to have a baby. They were very innocent. But er things have changed a lot these days . Yes. What kind of job did your grandfather do? Ah he was a, he was a headmaster at a Methodist school at in Yorkshire. And er he'd worked his way up as a teacher, then he, he was a headmaster. And even then I, I would have sa thought he, he was very up to date. He used to have very definite ideas of, of er how to treat children. I don't know whether the psychiatrists would have agreed with him. But I know I could remember being taken round his school and in the main hall he'd got a glass fronted cupboard, and he'd got all sorts of well really and truly they were just pretty pebbles. I don't think they were anything much more than that. But they were all for certain things and I, I, I remember one er was for anybody who stuttered. And he'd got a boy who did stutter and he always used to go to granddad before er he when he came to school, before lessons and he'd give him this pebble and he'd say, now you can put it in your pocket. But always hold it, keep it and if you're holding that stone you won't stutter. And he didn't. And he got so he could gradually do without it and he never stuttered again. Most amazing thing . Did he Probably, you know, lack of self confidence or something like that. But it did the trick. Yes. Did he have other pebbles er which had other cures? Was this what the pebbles were for? He may have done. I really don't know, but I do remember that one. I remember him telling me about that, that stone. Mm. You said that your grandmother played quite a part in your upbringing after your mother died. Yes, yes. Well she taught me to knit and she taught me to do a lot of embroidery and that sort of thing. She did certainly influence me in, in that way. But erm I still do, I still do a lot of knitting. I can't do any embroidery nowadays but I do, I sti I'm never st er I've never er stopped enjoying knitting. It's always been a hobby with me. And then she did a lot of tatting. You don't hear that these days. Erm and we never knew how she did it, she never had told anybody how she did it, it died with her I'm afraid. But everything she, everything she did always had some embroidery on. She never did anything jus just plain. It was amazing really and even, she was eighty two when she died and even then she was knitting her own jumper suits. And embroidery. Even the canary cover had an embroidery on it. It was amazing . She'd ge nothing everything she did she had to sort of beautify it and put some embroidery on it. I, I take it that she didn't have a job as well. No. No. No. In those days women didn't seem to take part time jobs or jobs at all. I think if they did anything it, it was sort of charity work. Er and they did a lot of sewing for bazaars at church and that sort of thing. But er I don't really remember erm people going out to work much ex except, I suppose you'd call them the lower classes, or not really the working classes because er, but the lower classes they would take in washing. Er or they'd go out doi charring and go you know work the we used to have a woman come in once a week to do the washing. She'd come in and do the washing in the morning, and if it was a nice bright day she'd iron in the afternoon. For the whole family. Er and other er women would you know you'd take it to them an and they'd do it in, in their own homes. And it would come back already done. But other than that I don't think, women didn't do much I mean even in shops, the men were the shop assistants nearly always. So you didn't get women going out, nothing like, not like they do these days. And when you went to school, can you remember what wh that was like? Well I was never very happy at school. I never seemed to be sort of up to the other scholars at all. But er it was, the discipline was very much stricter than it is er today. Er nowadays so many things are just accepted that in those days they wouldn't be. I can remember one, one girl, I mean the great sin was to steal anything, and er they'd found in her, her satchel somebody else's pencil. Now whether it had got there by mistake we never knew but there was no question she was absolutely just dismissed on the spot. Sent home and that was it. But er any pinching or anything like that ooh it was erm it just wasn't accepted at all. It was a terrible crime. Whereas now I mean it's a case of if you lose anything it's your own fault for putting it down. It's, it's a terrible state of affairs really. It's not improved at all. And of course the discipline in the classroom er it was very strict. There was neve never any talking in class. I mean it was, you, you were sent out of the room. Did you as children think that that was fair? Oh yes we did. Yes, we went to school to learn and we were told not to talk. If we talked well we, we expected it. Er there wasn't anything like the, well not to the schools that I went to, the corporal punishment that there seems to have been since. Er it w I don't ever remember anyone you know getting the cane or anything like that. We did have lines, hundred lines, I must do not do this or something like that which was very negative really. Be far better if they told us to do something sensible . But er i it took your time up when you know when you might have been enjoying yourself. But, but erm no we expected, we accepted the, the discipline. We were told not to do a thing, if we did it well you, you knew what you were up against. Er I think far more than they do now. They don don't seem to take notice of what the teachers said. Er and I think perhaps teaching I don't know whether it's different today but they seemed to instil in us the love of, of poetry and the, the love of literature and that sort of thing. I've always been grateful for When we prepared for our next visit to , the secret camera was hidden in a jacket, the lens behind a badge in the buttonhole. Relaxed and expansive in his office, explained how he used a local policeman to obtain details from 's criminal record on the police national computer. So is that off the the P N C ultimately or all from his local? No that's that's off the the P N C it I mean it's obviously through his local police station but it's off the the the national computer. Right. But our guy very I mean basically what happened is our guy waited till a senior officer went into the the screen Mm. erm when he was asked about and stood over his shoulder and trying to take mental notes . Yeah, yes. If there's a lot there, hard to take the note I suppose Yeah. I mean it's cos it's not of course as we know, it's not a secret that he has one, it's just a question of exactly what it is, it's the Yeah. erm. That's it. I don't know, I mean these are definitely the sentences. What we were told about that your criminal record is that you had convictions for armed robbery and aggravated assault, is that out of the record that you were aware of is that correct? Yes, yes, I'm that is correct, yes, but th th this is just amazing to me, that er this th this can happen, you know what I mean? But there are companies who advertise in Yellow Pages that they will do investigations on behalf of employers of future employees. And when you talk to them they will say we can find out whether they've got a criminal record or not, how can they offer that service in the public domain without having access to your computer? The service which is provided by those people is in fact questionable, and indeed we ourselves would be interested in how in fact they obtain that information. But it wasn't only criminal records we were interested in, we said we wanted 's medical records too. His health record, for someone that does this sort of work, his health is terrible. Without the knowledge of 's G P, obtained information from his medical files. There's a reference there to you being referred by her to Greenwich district Hospital. Yes. Erm for a certain treatment in October ninety two and ag also more recently, is that correct? yes, that's that's that's that's that's correct, yes . That's correct, and that the further down, I mean it says that er there is a er it says that the reason you've had been the reason you've been sent for this treatment is because of er a particular condition you've got. Yes. Yeah, that's correct? Yes,straight. And the la I think the last paragraph which is er refers to some advice that has been given to you. Advised by his doctor to give up,straight,to give up smoking Yes. and give up drink yes that's right yes. So all of that information matches ? Aye yeah that's that that that I mean I've went to that doctor and and it's like a doctor's surgery surely is should be sacrament yo you shouldn't, know what I mean? Medical confidentiality you're you're just sitting there with bloody a private conversation we that I went for treatment with my doctor, and and the recommendations that she's given me in, well well what's the point er what er what's going on? Now why I mean do you think it matters that these things are so that these things are so, that these things which we thought were in, you know private to you, and not available to other people so easily, why do you think it matters that they actually are apparently in return for mo payment, are available to anyone? It's scandalous, scandalous, that means that people in this country have got no privacy at all. None whatsoever, they can can't even have a confidentiality with a practitioner. If that's the day they'll be telling me they can get documentation now from priests in the confessional, that'll be the next bloody thing you'll be telling me, I can't under you know what I mean, what's it all about? Although 's G P herself did not release the health records, getting hold of such data seems to be an easy task for the private investigator. At the beginning of September we asked Robert to investigate our fourth target, Sarah . And I don't know whether her health records will be of relevance or not really, erm it's much more likely the health records of her daughter who's called Flora. Right. Erm and Flora she's called. Mhm. Erm would be of, you know, could be of relevance. Okay. Yeah? No problem. It should have been a problem because the personal details of Flora are meant to be secret, under the terms of a high court injunction granted in the middle of last month, Sarah is not allowed to discuss anything about her daughter with anyone, other than her legal and medical advisors. They have information about daugh about my daughter which I do not, I cannot imagine how they have obtained it, I am absolutely appalled. I spent the past nine and a half years doing everything I can to keep everything about my daughter secret. They have the name and address of the school she goes to,I, goodness, this is monstrous. I had my daughter treated under an assumed name until she was five, to try and prevent the press from finding out things about her, and they have the secret name that I used for here in here. It is believed that this surname is used by her mother to divert attention from her. The names of my G Ps and their address, when I was last seen, or when Flora I suppose their talking about Flora,Flora was last seen, by our G P. Outrageous, this is wicked, it's monstrous, but I'm absolutely appalled, now I'm not allowed to speak about her because that's going to be harmful to her, but any Tom, Dick, or Harry can get information which they have no right to about her and about me, about anybody else, and can flog it. seems to have got most of his information about Sarah from the data held at her local Family Health Services Authority in Bristol, registered under the data protection act, it holds a large amount of information on patients within its area including the name and address of a patient's doctor. One day in September, Flora's doctor received a call from someone who claimed to be from the Family Health Services Authority, asking for details from his files, suspicious, he gave nothing away. I then rang the Family Health Authority er myself, and they'd never heard of the person and had no trace of of the name I gave them. Erm told me that they had a lot of or a lot a number of people ringing purporting to be someone asking for information, and they like to keep a log of these bogus phone calls, I then rang the patients mother and and told her what had happened as quickly as I could. What is the thing about this that concerns you most of all? The implications for my daughter's safety and security, and and mine and the rest of my family's, because there have been a number of occasions over the years when I've had to turn to the police because of my anxiety about that when there's been a lot of attention from the media and when the press have published our address and so on erm and we've had I've had specific death threats particularly against my daughter on one occasion. So it's that is very alarming to think that erm somebody putting it about or happy to make available to others information about my domestic arrangements and my habits. And of course the pro the information about Flora is the is the thing which concerns me most. Er, anything else? Erm, yes there is one other thing about the program, er which you might be interested in. Mhm. The program's about you. Erm it's about how people sell personal data er for money to other people erm and erm you're quite er you will be quite a substantial part of the program. Hmm. Naming us? Yes, that's right. I just wondered what your response to it was, seeing as er what you're doing is getting information to which you're not entitled, and selling it for money to other people. Ah, I'm sorry I can't comment. Thanks. Well don't you think that it's really rather improper for you to be doing this? After all people are entitled to some secrecy aren't they, about their You don't feel that there's any need at all to give any explanation of your behaviour? You don't think that an explanation is due here? This information after all should have received confidential and does belong to other people, doesn't it? What I thinks embarrassing is that And you're just stealing it you're just stealing it so that you can make money aren't you? Do people have a right to have their health records confidential do they not? Have you got nothing to say what so ever? 'Fraid not, no. Robert is not alone in selling personal information from data banks. Many companies, using only the most casual euphemisms, offer these services, so we spent a day on the phone talking to detective agencies listed in Yellow Pages, asking them what they had to offer. We said we were a research company thinking of vetting a future employee. Before they came we removed all trace of our connection to television, rearranged the office furniture a bit, and hid a camera in a bankers box. The bank enquiry line If they're clean. Okay. Yeah. To obtain overdraft facility, current bank balance, and comments on how the account has been run, Yeah. that would cost you fifty pounds for that. Right. Plus V A T. Right we can supply bank information for instance we can supply you with the balance, erm we should be able to let you know what sort of standing orders there are, erm but that would be charged at an extra rate because Yeah. we would have to find out Yeah. about the bank and that's not easy. It's a grey area, and everything that we do is totally ethical and professional, but obviously what were talking about is obtaining information. Yeah. There is a hell of a lot of information er at at mm the Fraud Squad Yeah. I E associates and that sort of thing Yeah, yeah. which I can have checked, you know what I mean Yeah, yeah. you throw the name Bill Boggins into that Yeah. and it'll come up that he's and that's probably the sort of person your going to get somebody who's is a smell about rather than Yeah. do you know what I mean? Yeah. And so that's why erm you know we we only use certain contacts who we know are very reliable Yeah, yeah. erm and in a position really where where they wouldn't be challenged Right. but of course they they want to be paid quite well I Sure. hasten to add. To ascertain s criminal record hundred pounds, to ascertain that. If it's got a full criminal record if their known er that could be it could be as cheap as fifty pounds, for a criminal record I can't make any guarantees on that Right. Because the there's only one way of obtaining somebody's criminal record and that's getting a police officer to do it. To do the enquiring? Yes. Right. Basically we have erm access. Not official access, but we do have access. Yeah. I know people in this sort of line of business who will sit here and tell you all sorts of crap. Here, here. Excuse me er anyway it's bu really there's no, we haven't got a crystal ball you know. Yeah. Yeah. It's about grey matter and tr and and a bit of, you know, ducking and diving and a bit of erm cun and it's it's who you know and not what you know I mean really, excuse me one moment. He's a good lad. Yesterday we got five tracing agents to come into our office, all of them offered to get details of people's bank accounts, Mm. details several cases details from the er the police national computer, er for sale at prices varying from sort of fifty pounds to a hundred and fifty pounds Mhm. and we've just rung these people up from the Yellow Pages, I mean this does suggest doesn't it that there's quite a f quite a a big market out there for this stuff ? Well it may well suggest it, I mean I have no no reason to doubt the statement you've made or even statements made in newspapers, they've added to my concern from my own investigations. What I cannot do is go around and do a full enquiry to find out what the position is, an enquiry indeed might be difficult, because you may have found these people but actually pinning down er to who does it and what actually happens may be more difficult. It is not clear why it should be that difficult, routinely, every day, enquiry agents are used to discover details of employees and customers financial, health, and criminal records. Very, very large solicitors firms, insurance companies, and very large multinationals, these were just some of the customers of which the private detectives who visited us boasted. And they will never be short of custom until the government acts. We asked the Home Office to appear in this program, but they refused, instead they sent us a letter full of encouraging noises about how seriously they took the question of data protection. However, serious action to close the loopholes in the law will have to wait on the parliamentary timetable and the European legislation, until then, with more and more companies wanting to know the truth about their employees, competitors and suppliers, and with more and more information being put onto computers, the trade in personal data looks set to thrive. In the security world everything is a compromise, as there are no absolutes erm you want an absolutely secure health service, don't have a health service, don't let ever give any information out, erm if you fall ill away from your home er you're called into a hospital, you would like the thought that er the hospital can ring up your doctor and get information about you fairly quickly you don't want to have a whole bureaucratic erm apparatus saying no that information isn't available. It sounds as though it's going to go on forever then. It could well go on forever unless one of two things happens, unless everybody guards themselves against giving information away, which as a matter of practice many will do, and many probably won't, or secondly that some legislation is brought about to make this an offence, and to treat it seriously. There seems little doubt that legislation would reduce the extent to which confidential personal data is sold. But as those who want the information get more cunning, we may find that our personal privacy has been eroded forever. My own feeling is that er er as against someone who is er reasonably determined and reasonably methodical there is very little privacy, there is more privacy if you are extremely rich and can afford to have bank accounts in Liechtenstein and can afford to hire lawyers to prevent stories about you appearing in the newspapers, but for th for the majority of us erm there is very little privacy. What what was the story about the witch again? Well she l she lived I think up on the hill above here. Millfield land somewhere. And she was supposed to be a witch right enough and the men from all round about here er had a meeting about it and they I think met at the barn of Dale. Where was that? Dale's the farm just over the hill. And they all had their flails with them. So they went to the Kildingy Well which was s supposed to have some kind of magical properties you see and er I don't ken if it was a a holy well or exactly but it certainly was reputed to have some kind of properties that could cure supposed to cure any disease save the black death. So they went to the Kildingy Well and dipped their flails in the water. To sanctify the whole operation. And then they and took this poor old wife and they beat her to death with the flails. And er they couldn't bury her in the in the Kirkyard. You see in consecrated ground so they buried her in this bit of wheat land at the Muckle Water there. The Millfield Gupps. So they say. And she was reported to have er have said when they when they took her out, that there would be nothing nothing grow on the site of the house but runcho And I don't know the they were awful hungry for land in that day you ken and there was quite, there was more than one occasion there was old folk just putting up with the house just to get the land that it stood on. Mhm. So whether the fact that they thought that she was a witch was maybe kind of half an excuse just for getting her out of the house I don't know. But they they'll tell you that you can still see where the house was because there's a runcho grows there. There's different stories about I know that long ago about men being put out of their putting out of their houses just to and they just er demolished the house you ken and Mhm. just to get the land it was. There was a man that used to that worked in the mill. His initials is carved on a stone above the the kiln fire. And I think it's eighteen sixty six. Peter and was a house just up the road hereabouts. And he was just terrorized out of his house. Mhm. And they . Put hens in his bed and he come in one night and there was a s a man a stray man you ken an effigy of a man like and it was hanging by the neck from a rafter in the house. And I think they'd just been hounding him for a while and that was the last straw. And he came down he would have been working for he would have been at that time my great grandfather maybe or and he came down and he lived in lower Millfield after that and just as soon as he was out of his house, they just had the house demolished. Blew it up. Mhm. and then divided up the land. Mhm. You were telling about that witch story afore, is that something that your father told you? I think it must have been indeed. Mhm.. They are oh I don't ken when but they must you ken obviously a long time ago story. Mhm. kind of story Er well story about the man from Rathlesholm. It was the harvest time and they were going to brew. Which they I you ken they were all all the houses would have about harvest time. And you ken and all their friends and neighbours came around to help with the harvest they'd have this home brew. So this man I think he came from Rosevale. Which is out along the shore in Rathlesholm. And he was going to somewhere in North End I think it was Huip to get barn to make this ale with. So he got the barn and he he had it in a peedie pail you see and he was on his road home and he was coming by this that hillock at Yensetter there. And he heard this awful grand fiddle music. So he stopped and he listened to this and went to have a look, see what was going on. And this was the trolls having a celebration of some kind. And so er whether the trolls keened he was there or not I don't ken but he he was watching this all the all the dancing. And listened to the awful grand music. And he stood and listened to this for a while and then he thought he was delayed long enough so he set off home. When he was coming along the road, the they were sawing. And there was a mark on his finger where his the handle of the pail was just sunk into the flesh of his fingers he was stood there the whole Winter listening to this music. I've heard one like that, I've heard about the one where the man goes into the and and is there for years. Mm. You know listening. slightly different I think. Can you tell me about the one . Erm There was a there was a man from Greentoft in Eday supposed to be. It was Gre he was out at the Caithes and it blew up a a gale a Westerly gale and blew him across to Norway you see. And he was likely in poor shape by the time he got to Norway. But he survived it anyway and there was er folk found him there and kind of looked after him. And nursed him back to health and whatnot. And he was there but there was no way of getting back. And he was there for quite a while. At nights he used to go down to the shore and look out across the sea you see and he wondered what was happening back home at Greentoft and fairly homesick. And this had gone on for some time and he was down on the shore anyway one night and looking out across the the sea and thinking long for Eday and he met this man. And the man was asking him what he was er looking so mournful about and what. He said he told him the story and he said if you could just get back to to Greentoft, he says, I would give you the best two cattle out of my byre. If I could just get back to Greentoft. So the man told him to be down there the same time next night and he returned . So the next night this m the man comes down to the shore and here was two men with a rowing boat. This man he was spoken to the night afore and another one. With a rowing boat. I don't think he was just too impressed with this set up but it was the only chance anyway so. They got him in the boat and they he had to lie down in the bottom of the boat and they and they covered him with a tarpaulin. And he couldn't look out. So they got him settled in the bottom of the boat and just as they were putting this tarpaulin over him, and getting ready to set off, the one man He heard the one man saying to the other, he says, Right, forty miles a wee stroke of the oars. So they set off anyway and just in no time at all they were coming into the shore below Greentoft. And it didn't seem very long to the man anyway. And er he was just delighted to be back of course and first thing he did was up to the house and had a he had a look round and he was in the byre and had these two awful grand . And he was awful proud of them. And they were grown apiece while he was away and they were better than ever and the deal was been that he had was gonna give them the best two cattle you see and this was this was the best two animals he had. He was very loath to part with them. And he did kind of consider taking the two the next wasn't fairly so good. Mhm. But he thought, Well that was the deal. So he stuck by it so he loosed these two and them down to the shore. And as soon as the the first ones forefeet touch the deck of the boat, the boat just disappeared and it was the trolls that was taking him home. And that was the last he saw of them? And that was the last he saw of them. And he didn't have to part with his cattle after all. But what would have happened to him if he'd not taken the cattle down I don't know. that's another story with a an unusual ending cos I'd have thought when you were saying that he wasn't that he didn't give them the Mhm. And some something the nice ones and something happened . terrible befell him but. are there any more that you're about trolls or whatever? I don't think so Agnes. I've really ne you don't hear many stories about trolls at all. Mm. I mind them they used to say too when afore having a boiled egg, you know just peedie . Insisted that they pu put the eggs the shell. When you were peedie. Which I don't think mum entirely approved of cos she seemed to think it was just quite proper table etiquette maybe but. And it was so that the fairies wouldn't sail away in the eggshells. Mm. But you Well it it was this this old wife had a a fairy that lived with her and apparently it wasn't an uncommon thing. And the fairies was boat you see but they were kind of wandering kind of things. And this fairy was it was found an eggshell. So it'd got this eggshell in the bottom and they used they would work a a mast a sail on it. And they'd got this eggshell in the bottom anyway and away it went. And it sailed off to a island that it came to. And there was just a whole loads of fairies on this island. And the peedie fairy was just delighted to start with but soon realized that there was something kind of fishy going on and it wasn't a very happy place. And it turned out that there was a big goblin that lived on this island and he just ate fairies. And he used to come around everyday and kind of size them up and pick the kind of fat juicy ones. And he would tell them that when he was going back to get gonna be his next meal. And er of course the fairies was kind of gradually disappearing. So it wasn't a very happy island right enough. But this peedie fairy anyway, it was wandering about one day very disconsolate at the prospect and found a sparrow with a broken wing. So it kind of nursed this sparrow you see and got its wing bandaged up and whatnot. And er and the sparrow started to get better and er it was starting to fly a peedie but again and was just getting its strength back. And this goblin came along one day and says to this peedie fairy that like he was coming to get her in the morning. So tearing off to find the sparrow. And er the sparrow thought he would maybe make it back to the mainland now so the peedie fairy climbed on his back and the sparrow flew it back to the mainland. And the peedie fairy came back and lived with the old wife been afore. And it never wandered any more after that it was seen enough of the big bad world outside. But the old wife always put he egg spoon through the bottom of the eggshell when she had a boiled egg after that. I've never ever heard of that before. Is that something that other folk on Stronsay know or is just something you I don't know. There's maybe not enough folk knew it because I don't know that there's very many fairies around . No. . Where there never many ghost stories speak about some of them but Och I don't ken. there's not very many black stories here that you've heard . and then came back and took a woman back with them as their servant . Are there many in Stronsay that you've heard of or not? that happened in Stronsay. Did it? Mhm. Tell me about that then. Erm well but the the descendants of them still here. Is that so? Mhm. I mean it's happened all over but But there's no ghost stories or No. anything associated with it. But I believe it did did happen. Mhm. ghost stories Ah I don't ken there's not really an an awful lot of ghost stories. There's Lower Millfield's supposed to be haunted. You see and it's likely one of the oldest houses on the island. You ken it's Well among the oldest houses on the island. When you say that, roughly how old do you think have you got any idea how old it is? No I haven't a clue. The mill has been I don't ken how long there's been a mill on the site there but the mill as it stands at present 's been there from eighteen sixty. Mhm. Eighteen sixty one is the year it was heightened and extended and whatnot. But there's there was a peedie single story building there Mhm. before that. And you can see on the gable end just here, you know where it's been heightened you can see the the old gable end And there was a there was two water wheels. one where the water wheel is now. That was fed by the . But there was another wheel at the other end and there was a loch that the the f there were hill fields up between . The toft mill at the other end. And as I say as I say I don't ken how long it had been there but that see that likely about the same time as the as the mill was heightened and er the kiln would've been putting on. You see there wouldn't have been a kiln at the mill before that I think it every house had their own kiln and they dried their own you ken. Dried their own grain afore they took it to the mill. But so about the same time as the mill was heightened, I think that th land was drained. For my grand uncle could mind the man that dug the ditch that drained it. You ken, he was an old man then . Mhm. So that in about nineteen sixties. Mhm. Sometime. Mhm. And that bit that comes right . Mhm. That's right. Mhm. That's right. And You don't have any idea No I've never heard of the mill being on anywhere different from where No. it is now. No. So I would think it's just always been at that that site. What what was what was the ghost story ? I don't ken, nobody ken's where the ghost came from. Or who it is really. I think I've heard that that it it it was er it was the doctor's house some time. I don't ken how far back that is. But er there was something about a servant lass that got pregnant. And committed suicide to avoid the scandal. Or something. So it's possibly her that Aha. that haunts the place. Mhm. But it just manifests itself very very rarely. Have you ever heard it yourself? No. No. But mum has heard it. Maybe twice. And dad had heard it. And what form did that take? I mean if they heard It m it makes an awful racket sometimes. And always at night. Terrible bangs and things that there's just no explanation for. But No no. Just noise. The the last time that it happened was er on it must be maybe twenty year ago or so. There was a beautiful night in the Summertime and the house was just full of women. There was mum and her and my grandmother, her mother. And Eleanor, sister. There was a friend of Eleanor's from Austria in the house and Kathleen. Yeah there was five women and dad was away and I was out at the fishing just for the night. And I came home about I don't ken, maybe eight o'clock in the morning or something a beautiful morning. flat calm. And here all these women was up And er the ghost was surely been performing that night. They'd heard this awful racket you see and they'd thought it was me coming and falling or something on the stairs. But you ken, very early in the morning. Mhm. And they all, they got up in the morning and I wasn't home still And must have been the ghost. Eleanor heard it as well. Aha. Yes I'm sure Eleanor was there. Mhm. I don't know, it's not a very malicious ghost anyway, just Unexplained noises. Just the sort of unexplained noises thirty year or so. Were you speaking to about another ghost story or was that the one ? No I No. I don't ken . There's not really many ghost stories on the island I don't think. That was the one that I'd heard about . What about any other stories linked with characters around about here that you've heard? Old characters that maybe you don't mind but you've heard spoken about. I Revelation. And I looked to behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death. David Koresh, like Jesus Christ, died aged thirty three. British followers of Koresh are facing trial for murder. Tonight Panorama has new evidence about the Waco tragedy . For the great day of his wrath is come. David Koresh was an uneducated product of Rural Texas. He liked rock music, cars, guns and teenage girls. But to the Branch Davidian Sect he was the Lamb of God. Today there is dispute about how far he caused his and his followers deaths, or they were victims of a needless tragedy. The American government has just brought out two new reports providing fresh evidence about the life and death of the man who called himself the sinful Messiah. Koresh lives on in the hearts of such Branch Davidians as survived. Two of them revisit the site of the Mount Carmel centre, their former home outside Waco, that Koresh renamed Ranch Apocalypse. They've come to look for their belongings. Janet had been a Branch Davidian for years before Koresh came along. There's not much left is there . Just a heap of rubbish, hard to believe that there were over a hundred people living in there, is there? Her husband is in jail in Waco with the other men, soon to go on trial. Sheila lost her husband and four of here seven children in the fire. The site was bulldozed immediately afterwards. Last week the Justice Department's report reaffirmed that the fire was deliberately started inside. Most survivors dispute that. If the cause of the tragedy is contentious, the scale of it is not. Eighty four people died here on April the nineteenth, of whom at least twenty were young children. Twelve of the youngest were found still wrapped in the charred bones of their mothers' arms. Of all the dead about twenty four were British. And of the Adults who left during the siege, or who managed to survive the fire, three Britons will soon go on trial for conspiracy to murder the federal agents who were killed or wounded in the initial shoot out. Many of the Branch Davidians seem to be educated and articulate people. The question remains. How did people like that come to finish up in the holocaust that happened here? The Davidians split off from the Sabbath Day Adventist church in the nineteen thirties. They take the book of Revelation more literally and believe the second coming of Christ is imminent. Among the wreckage here are the belongings of families who came from Britain and from all over the world. I like to have the memories of them Yeah I don't. but you hate to think at the same time what happened how they were burning you hate to think of Yeah I I those things. The government calls them a cult because of their devotion to David Koresh. Their spirits are with us and that we got to keep on going. and their loyalty remains. Having lost your husband and four of your children, you don't think that David Koresh might have been er a unwise leader? A misguided figure? No,no, no. He's he's always been very kind, very considerate always very mindful of our sins. I don't think so, no. Don't you ever feel that he dragged your family in to this terrible holocaust unnecessarily ? No sir. No sir I think that we were all there we all stayed because God would take care of us. We still believe that there's going to be a kingdom over in Israel and that David Koresh is going to come back and be the head of that kingdom and that it's going to be a peaceful place as prophecized in the Bible. It talks about the heathen being astounded and being envious and jealous because they are going to see peace and harmony and happiness and this is what we are looking forward to this is why we're not mourning, why we're not you know all upset because we know this is going to come. Three British Branch Davidian men are in Waco jail and will be tried for murder soon. I spoke on the telephone to one of them Livingstone who comes from Nottingham. This is no different to the Christians that lived back two thousand years ago. It was either the system or God that's what er the position of the F B I put us in. We did not fear death at all. The thing about it is that it is not death of the body that is important to us, it's the soul. David Koresh grew up in the Bible belt. He was born Vernon , the illegitimate son of a fourteen year old girl. Brought up in the Seventh Day Adventist Church he would later be expelled and join the Branch Davidians. His mother, now Mrs Bonnie , knew young Vernon's vocation was to be a religious leader. He was a failure at school, but as a teenager he became obsessed with Christianity. He would pray for hours and memorize large sections of the Bible. His mother remembers his growing talent as a preacher. I knew it had to be a gift from God. And all a prophet means is a mouthpiece of God, it's nothing he's just a man you know but I felt that God was leaving him I really did. He amazed me, it was awesome. He described himself as the sinful Messiah. Mhm. What does that mean? Well he he he was a sinful person, as we all are erm, I think he did not as the way I understand it, you know Jesus came perfect in everything but he had a he had a a message to give and he could give it better, I think because he had experienced so many things. The sins of the world and all this kind of stuff. Waco sheriffs officers close in on Mount Carmel, not this year but six years ago. Vernon was arrested for leading an armed attack on the then Branch Davidian leader one George who'd thrown him off the property. Shots were exchanged and firearms seized. In a bizarre leadership contest had dug up a dead Davidian and challenged his rival Vernon to bring the body back to life. In court the jury concluded that was insane. Vernon David Koresh to be, escaped conviction because the jury couldn't agree on his guilt. The vital evidence was removed from the Waco courthouse and guns were returned to him. George had been toppled as Davidian leader. Vernon returned to Mount Carmel with his young wife and a handful of followers, the undisputed leader of the sect. To consolidate his power he needed new members and his recruiters fanned out across the world. Koresh's closest aid, right up to the end was Steve . He flew to London in nineteen eighty eight. He headed for the Seventh Day Adventist College, New Bold in Berkshire. had been a student here back in the seventies before he was expelled for getting drunk. came as in the Christian community would say a wolf in sheep clothing. No one knew of him coming, hardly anyone knew who he was. The first thing he did he made friends amongst the young men in the college. He was a latter-day John the Baptist preparing the way for David Koresh. A former Adventist himself, he was well equipped to give the students he met Koresh's new slant on the book of Revelation. I've pondered over a couple of the things. Good. You know as an Adventist do you know what it says in the book of Revelation? Yeah Revelation fourteen and lo a lion was standing on the Mount Zion and with him a Hundred and Forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the Earth. Any man that worships the beast and the image the very same shall taste of the wine of the wrath of God. He took things out of context and everything focused on Armageddon, the end of the world, apocalypse. Koresh zeroed in on this and tried to bring it closer to where we are to make it more real so it was uppermost in the minds of all his followers. When Koresh himself came to Britain banned from New Bold he had to hold meetings in peoples homes. God in the flesh, do you know who I am? God in the flesh. New Bold college couldn't prevent its students from going along and some young Seventh Day Adventists were predisposed to be receptive. After all Koresh's apocalyptic vision, his talk of the seven seals that only the lamb of God can unlock, sounded like refinements of what they already believed. Dissatisfied with mainstream Christianity they were impressed by his apparent certainty, but he persuaded his potential British followers with more than just his Biblical knowledge. What better sinner knows a sinner than a godly sinner, ha? Gradually the meetings got longer and longer until eventually they began, not in the evening, but they began in the morning and they lasted from perhaps ten in the morning until the early hours of the next day. Course people were very tired. The the evening I was there there were about twenty five people in the room and people were falling asleep. But what's the point of holding a meeting that goes on for more than twelve hours? Well I I only see one point and that is to try to confuse somebody, to brainwash them. But those who accepted Koresh's teaching deny they were being brainwashed. Every sin Isaiah says, I'm guilty of, I agree. I'm perfect to give you this message. As a recruiting exercise the meetings were a success one who joined then, now a nurse, was Janet . We were not spell bound by David. You know we were intelligent people who asked intelligent questions. Now remember we all of us came from the background that, you know this world was going to come to an end very soon. That God was going to do something catastrophic, Okay? Erm exactly what, we didn't know, we were al we all knew a little bit about the seals, however we had studied about the seals in a different way and it didn't make sense and we were young people who who were searching. As well as Janet, four students at the meeting became Branch Davidian recruiters in Britain. One was her brother, theology student John who recruited in Manchester. He was to die in the fire. Livingstone from Nottingham was a former Seventh Day Adventist pastor. As we've seen he's now in prison. Cliff from Derby was another New Bold student, a gifted artist he too would die in the fire. And Diana , John former girlfriend, and a psychology graduate. She had two brothers and two sisters at home in Manchester. Manchester South Seventh Day Adventist Church. The family used to come here. The father Sam , a builder still worships here on a Saturday, the Adventist sabbath. All five children were musical and destined for academic success and professional careers. John was able to convince most of the family to follow the sinful Messiah. Diana returned after her first visit to Waco to go about recruiting Manchester Adventists using her father's church membership lists . Hello it's me. How are you? Her father was the only member of the family to reject Koresh's teaching and the only one still alive. The fire in Waco killed Diana, both her brothers, both her sisters and her mother Zilla . When she decided, with the rest of the children, to go to Waco Monday and they told me the Sunday. Just a few hours, I would say before, less than twenty four hours before they went. That they were going and that nearly killed me, that nearly killed me because I knew then this was serious. Very serious. This came as a shock to you? It was more than a shock I put my head in my in my hand and I remember kneeling right at this spot and just crying my heart out. You are a bereaved husband and a bereaved father. Definitely I am. In in in this situation, have you apportioned blame for the deaths of your family? Whom do you blame? I The main There are two persons whom the Devil used as instruments in the destruction of my family, equally. And one is They call him David Koresh, and the next is a woman in London call Vicky . I think that's her name. Why do you blame her? Because her home was a headquarters for Vernon in Britain. Victorine is vacating her flat in North London. It was never a headquarters as such, but David Koresh, the self-styled lamb of God, stayed here when he visited London. And here he held Bible meetings that convinced Vicky , and over thirty others, to come and join him in Waco. She was allowed to leave the Mount Carmel centre halfway through the siege. Speaking for the first time Vicky is now disillusioned with the man she once thought was a prophet and is writing a book about it. I still believe that that someone is to come by the name of David and setting up of God's kingdom but but But it's not David Koresh? No it's not David Koresh. Vicky was filmed at the Mount Carmel centre, last year, by an Australian cameraman. She lived here on and off for three years. Conditions were primitive. There was no sanitation. Life consisted of laborious work, punctuated by lengthy sessions of Bible study addressed by the prophet himself . I will the Lord has said unto me thou art my son. This day have I begotten thee. Ha. Someone's the son of God, someone It would become clear to Vicky that Koresh's contempt for the outside world, that he called Babylon, included contempt for some of its laws and for normal standards of behaviour. Someone is going to rule whether the big world likes it or not. Thou shalt break them with the rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. The guy's tough. He's got more than guns. He's got God. Sometimes his Bible meetings are very interesting and another time it can be very boring. He would tell us about his love affairs and things what he did. You know just raw, you know. What he did, how how he'd do it and things like that. And you know children, men and children would be there and he just don't care. Sorry Wh what How would you mean, what he did? You know, how You know how he make love, he would tell us. The Mount Carmel compound in the Texas countryside outside Waco, had a despotic leader. Once his followers, many educated people, were convinced that Koresh was a prophet, a mouth piece of God they would do anything he asked of them. Koresh had married Rachel who was the fourteen year old daughter of another Branch Davidian. Together they had three children, all of them would die in the fire. But Koresh believed himself entitled to all the Davidian women. David established that erm in Isaiah, two twenty two, it says Seize Eve from man, and this is one of the prophecies that that David showed us that er shows the man, or the women, that they have to leave their wife or If it's the woman, she has to leave her husband and her and her boyfriend and become his wife. So he used a verse of Isaiah Yes. to justify sleeping with all the other mens wives? Yes and all the men give give their wife to David. So how many of them got pregnant? Many many of them. So how many children do you think David Koresh had? David had many children. So so that if any of the women were pregnant at Mount Carmel, David Koresh was the father. Yes because all all Every every man give their wife up. Even Koresh's closest aide, Steve , had to give up his young wife Judy to the sinful Messiah. She had Koresh's baby and called herself Judy Koresh. The whole harem was known as The House of David. But Koresh didn't just take Davidians wives. He demanded their young daughters too, and most parents consented. Koresh was discreet about his sex with underage children and they left his room in the early dawn. But one Branch Davidian, who later went to the police, was a witness to what went on. He came to me He had a problem,he and I were good friends and he said that erm that this one girl s erm Michelle , was his favourite wife and that he had been with her since erm she was twelve. The problem that he was having was that she was his legal wife's sister and there was some rivalry or jealousy developing between his legal wife and er this other girl and he wasn't sure what he what to do about it. What did you think about David Koresh sleeping with twelve year old children? Well I think it was terrible but the parents agree with it. Both mother and father, they agree that erm that David should do that because, you see, David established that he is the only he is the only man on this Earth who who who have er holy seed in him. Holy seed. Yes and That's what he called it? Yeah he call it the holy seed and that he could have righteous children. If Koresh broke the law, it was the County sheriff who should have intervened. The Waco sheriff habitually turned a blind eye to Koresh's activities. But when Mark defected and made allegations of child abuse sheriff Jack eventually sent social workers to visit the Branch Davidians. There was really no evidence of er of child abuse. There was only allegations and and again I say today that we have not ever found any any proof of any child abuse out there. That's not to say there wasn't child abuse now, I I have my own thoughts and in my own feelings feel that there could have been some child abuse especially ch sexual abuse. Erm, but we could never prove that. Wayne was David Koresh's legal advisor, but took his turn in helping construct the flimsy wooden building. Thinking himself safe from the law Koresh committed more excesses. was one of the so called mighty men. King David of the Old Testament had mighty men to enforce discipline, so did David Koresh. There was a paddle with which Koresh beat his followers and he intimidated them by openly boasting, in crude detail, about even worse brutality. Upon Julie who feared for her young daughter and wanted to leave. What I am saying here now is not hearsay, this is what David telled us in his Bible meetings. What he did. He took Julie upstairs in his room and he he push her he push her on his bed and he he raped her. He said to us that you know that is dick was so hard and he told us everything of what he did to her, he push his dick inside of her and he said he was very very rough with her and she was crying and crying and crying. For entertainment Koresh forced the Branch Davidians to watch violent and horrific videos, usually of films about the Vietnam war, to instil a militant and defensive mentality. Koresh had guns from the beginning and he made his mighty men in to trained marksman. His weapons were part of his his message. You see if There is going to be a war, and God's people had also to be warriors and so there was that element of religion as well that that we had to be trained as warriors for the Lord. On several occasions they had er displayed guns where people would back into their driveway or er show some indication that they were going on to their property, then guns were revealed, people coming out of the the buildings out there with guns and what have you. There was some reference to it as being their country. I I would not go out there on to their property without letting them have knowledge that I was coming to their property. But of all Koresh's dubious activities it was gun dealing that would bring him in to conflict with authority. One of his members had a dealers license and drove to cities like Houston to buy and sell at gun fairs. Koresh financed his sect by trading in weapons. A common place enough business in Texas. This was Koresh's business premises. A building near Mount Carmel called the Magbag. Here Koresh took receipt of mail order fire arms from all over America including machine guns, like the A K Forty Seven, the simple kits that convert semi-automatic weapons into automatics and even hand grenades. Fully assembled they are all illegal. Only when a package burst open did the sheriff receive a tip off from the postal service U P S. Er U P S er called us one time on some hand grenades hulls er the kind that you would use sat on your desk for a paperweight. A box of them had had er they were delivering had erm They had damaged the box and some of them had fallen out. And they called us to go out and look at them. They were not the illegal so we couldn't stop them from delivering them. Then we received information, black powder and and er other er types of er conversion kits for semi automatic rifles to convert them to automatic rifles, and that kind of thing. All of this information we were giving to the federal people, A T F, who are responsible for investigating and control these kind of activities. As a result this house opposite Koresh's compound was occupied in January by agents of the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms bureau, the A T F. An agent called infiltrated Bible classes and a log was kept of Koresh's movements. Warrants were issued to arrest Koresh and to search Mount Carmel for illegal weapons. Koresh used to regularly drive into Waco in his black sports car, he had no fear of arrest. Last week a government report said that if the A T F had arrested Koresh in town, all the mayhem that followed need never of happened and those who died might still have been alive. Instead the A T F decided to mount its biggest ever raid. Over a hundred armed agents set out for Mount Carmel. The raid was meant to have speed, simplicity and surprise. Speed, the A T F were transported in cattle trucks that were visible from miles away. Simplicity, the raid was preceded by three military helicopters that were fired upon before the cattle trucks even got here. Surprise, the raid had been talked about in Waco for days. The news media were alerted and were following the police convoy. One television news cameraman got lost near here and asked a postman for directions adding, there's going to be a big gunfight with those religious nuts over there. The postman thanked him for the warning and drove back to Mount Carmel. He was David , David Koresh's brother-in-law and one of the mighty men. Withering fire from the Davidians automatic weapons greeted the A T F men when they tried to enter the building. Last weeks report shows that not only was Koresh forewarned of the raid but the A T F's undercover agent had told that to the raid's commanders. The report says they should have called off the operation once the element of surprise was lost. With both sides suffering dead and wounded, Davidian lawyer Wayne , put in a desperate call to the deputy sheriff, Larry who he knew. Against a background of gunfire the call was recorded. Yeah this is Lieutenant may I help you? Yeah, they're shooting at us in Mount Carmel. Mount Carmel? Yeah, tell them there are children and women in here and to call it off. Oh man, I can hear the bullets. God almighty I knew this. Wayne? Tell them to call it off! Who is this, Wayne? Tell them to pull back! What? fight to the last man They started firing first. cease fire . Oh shit. What's the matter? They're What do you think they're doing all this firing on us right now. Alright, I'm trying to make contact with the forces now, standby. Why do you think such extreme violence was used against law enforcement officers when they arrived to carry out their duties? Well, er because it was provoked. Because the A T F provoked it. Violence begets v violence and when the A T F assaulted er those people, they defended themselves. When you think about a hundred plus people inside of a compound with all of those weapons, you need a a mass a large scale operation. The important thing was that it go forward only with the element of surprise. Unfortunately the element of surprise was lost and the operation still went forward. Ronald report concedes that with four A T F men killed and sixteen wounded the raid was a fiasco. But there could be no let up now. Koresh was confronting not just the local sheriff but the government of the United States. Federal officers were dead. A tragic justification and so on. And he places his hand, as he said, on his Jane's shoulder and says this is i this quiet girl standing there, this is what I wanted and look what I've, you know Mm. can you blame me when you see Yes. what I've got? Mm. And, she is not terror stricken, she is not horrified, she's not cowering in a corner, Jane I mean. No. She's just standing there Really quite strong. Yes. taking it in. Mm. And she says later sh you, you're too cruel, to Rochester, you can't blame her for being mad. Mm mm! And so, what could have been a really Gothic moment, isn't. Mm. And it seems to me, quite deliberately isn't. It's made a moment of er, dramatic moment er, a compassionate moment Mm. but not a Gothic moment. But even the fire where, you know, the first fire, don't they, when she burnt house down erm that isn't made as terrifying as it No. could have been. No. It's quite funny actually. Yes. Yes. Because he wakes up and, and Yes. says is there a flood? What Yes! That's right . are you doing drowning me in my bed! You know. Yes ! Cos she's thrown all this water over him. But I mean that's a terrifying thing to have found him in Oh yes! flames and er And then there's one little sort of almost erotic flicker really, when she says I'll go and get a candle and he says, don't go yet. Yes. Yes. Wait till I put something on. I know. Erm and er, you could pass it. You really could pass it. Erm and it's, you know it's, part of life isn't it? I It's couldn't help thinking if it was modern day a woman that's manically depressed dreamt that, dreamt she had, she was definitely mental, she would be stuck in a a mental home and just kept under with er Drugs. Exactly! drugs. Yes. She certainly wouldn't be roaming round. And you know,won I wonder whether She wasn't, yeah. whether it's kind of him to keep her there Mm mm. because she's quite well looked after. Well Exactly. Yes. Yes. Mm mm. Yes. But there must have been cases weren't there? Oh yes! Yes, but that's to that would be terrible if you had this! Yes, but that's then, I mean, perhaps Rochester was kinder. Yes. So, in case that does happen. Yes. Yeah, absolutely! He, and then Yes. he didn't want anybody to know, but I think in he did that in the kinder fashion. Mm. That is possible actually, that he would want to keep it from his neighbourhood. Yes. Mm. True. That he were married to a mad woman. But if sh she was in care They would put her somewhere else though wouldn't No. Qui quite possibly they wouldn't. So he would have been safer No. wouldn't he, actually than Yes. put her in a mental hospital or a Mm. or a mental institute. Yes. Mm. Somebody in authority would have known that he was married though, but, probably not anybody who could have done anything about preventing another one. No. Mm. Yeah, but we wouldn't have had the story would we? Well No, quite! Er er, in some cases they were beaten and tortured! Oh! That's right. Yes! Oh! Dreadful, yes. I think you just can't Yes. Yes. Yes it was a duty of them wasn't it? Mm. To beat the devil out of them. Yeah. Yeah. Most dreadful time! And left abandoned there weren't they? Oh Yes. yes! Yes. They were. Nasty! Some are still. Depicted in film erm, er, in that Tchaikovsky film, whatever Oh! was it called? The Music Makers. Oh yes. Mm. Erm, with Glenda Jackson. Yes. Mm. Mm. Absolutely incredible! That, oh! It was awful! Did you see it? No. Oh! It's, it's it was absolutely incredible! I think early in the eighteen twelve made it forever . Really? Mm. Mm. Oh Lord! Well we had the Quakers Yeah. to thank for improving the law on prisoners. Oh yes! We did. And the mental , that's right. I think Yeah. they were wonderful! At least prisons er What they did Yes. Absolutely! Yes. was amazing Yes. and wonderful really! Well that's right. Mm. Mm. Yeah. All the Erm Have we said all we want to say about St John and his er, secessionism? Oh yes. I think so, yes. Cos partly, I expect, his trouble was repression too. I think that he was was such a fanatic erm, religious Yes. because he wa he was obviously a very repressed man wasn't he? Absolutely! Spiritually and . Yes. And, and emotionally, he had repressed his Yeah. desire for Rosamond hadn't he? Yes. Mm mm. Yes. Erm, and that is the way that And spiritually. erm yo I mean he says at one point, as a positive statement, he thinks, that he bend, he's bending his nature out of its natural course Mhm mm. Mm. in order to serve God. Mm mm. Yes. Whereas Jane sees that as unnatural. Mm mm mm. Yes, like Wasn't it that . a typical religion though, that in that day and age when you were made to flagellate yourself, you were made, the whole time, to recognize your sin, and anybody who was masochistically inclined Yeah. was going to become a Rivers. Mm. Yes. Afraid so. And inflict it on others as Mm. well. As well. Yeah. And be a sadist as well. You know Van Gogh er, he had a hired woman, and er he definitely thought that was what he should do to actually put all his energies into his painting Mm. and Mm. and, well he didn't mind. So it's best not to have . Well that means Freud accepts that is one channel in which Yes. any unused sexual energies will go. That's right. It goes into creative. Subjugating it Yes. isn't it? Yes. Yes. But erm Rivers didn't exactly subjugate it did he? I mean, No. evil came out of it. It was a and also was doted on by his two sisters. Mm. Wasn't he? Yes. Although they recognized that Jane's lot with him in, I mean, they wanted Jane Oh yes! to marry him Mm mm. but once they knew it meant going to India Mm. and that she didn't care Mm. for him, then erm they, they supported her. Yes. Oh yes, but Well no, they didn't. er they did dote on him, you know, rather spoiltly. Yes. But, It makes you wonder why. So I think when we have these He was good looking. erm er portraits of, er men you have to take i it that erm we could argue Charlotte Bronte was very critical of the men she knew and, the men she thought she might know, and didn't erm, you have to look at the women who feed into the making of them Mm mm. don't you? As you say, you have to look at Mrs Reed That's right. and Mm. the making of John. And, perhaps the sisters, and the making of St John. Mm. But the men had the power didn't they? They erm Yes. they, they had all the power. So, women had, well what else could they do but kind of Mm. Well the women were chattels weren't they? In fact, you know, they, they just belonged Mm. to the men and Yes. either their fathers, or their husbands. Mm. Yes. But Mrs Reed's children, er, three of them, all a re a reflection of her wickedness. Mhm mm. Mm. If you can put it like that. Mm. Mm. Yes. Cos the two er, girls Mm mm. who are, were extraordinary Mm. and they didn't fit into life, did they? Well Into the world. Well, one was to No one became a nun didn't she? Yes. Yes. One was to, one should have married St John Eliza. Yes. That's it, yes. Eliza and St John could have bored each other rigid! Yes. Yes. Erm Some Murdered each other actually. Yes, probably ! And the one that was indulged Georgiana. was was Yes. completely useless! Yes. Absolutely hopeless! She was pretty. Er, she was pretty, she was Er, she'd been ruined hadn't ? she was lumpish All curls. Yes. she went sort of, she just sort of spread and got lazy didn't Yes. she? You know, in everything she did, er physically, mentally, you know Self indulgent. Yes. Absolutely. Er, and John just went wild. Mm. Yes. I mean, erm What's your explanation for Mrs Reed wanting to see Jane again? You know, where she, she finds her Ah! That's an interesting question. I'm sure she went to heaven or thereabouts. Yes. Yes. Yes. The extensible answer is to try and clear her conscience, to tell Mm mm. her about this uncle Yes. who wanted to leave her money. Yes, yes, that's that's a wasn't it? Erm, it's the go I mean you, you can or not er, decided whether you're going to believe in a woman who is so vindictive that she's going to allow them er, prevent her having her rightful Mhm. erm, legacy. Mhm mm. Erm because, she is of an equal status Mm. with her own children. Mm. Mm. They are cousins. Mm. Mm. Yes! Erm, and obviously the fact that she's sent to Lowood shows that it's Mm. her education's being pa paid for at the cheapest possible Mm mm. er, rate Yes. by Mrs Reed. Mm mm. And, and that's only because her husband were on a promise from her. Mm mm. Mm. Erm I think it's, er an original mark of the book that they don't make it up. No, they don't. No. I don't think they should make it up. No. I think there are some gulfs which cannot be bridged. Mm mm. Mm. And if, Charlotte Bronte had had reconciliation there I think it would have Oh! It would have been er awful Yes. wouldn't Yes. it? It would. And she No, she just turned away from her didn't Yes. she? She did. After she'd It's a deathbed confession to Mm. exculpate her her Yeah. her wrong-doing That's right. but, no way did she have any affection for her then. Oh, well Mrs Reed's nasty! And contin died hating er Yeah. Jane didn't she? She did anyhow. Oh yes! So that was on her Mm. But it had served the purpose of making Jane know about her uncle Yes. didn't it? That's right. This uncle who was also presumably the uncle of er, not only the Rivers' children, but would he also have been the uncle of Re Mrs Reed's Yes. children? Yes Oh! Yes! he would, her brother's erm mm. Yes. husband's brother wasn't he? That's right. But he also gives you a feeling that she was trying to show the difference good and evil, in other words, Jane refused to hate her but she did hate her. Mm. Mm. You know what I mean? Yes. Mm. All the way through. Mm. Hate gets you nowhere. Yes, she felt sorry for her. There is, erm, a Victorian literary convention also, being slightly worked against here, er, if anybody knows David Lodge's novel, Nice Work. Yeah. Mm. Anybody know Nice Work? Mm mm. Erm, features er a female university lecturer who's who says of the Victorian novel that it comes out right by marriage, er either marriage, legacy, or I can't remember what the other one was, there were three categories. And Jane certainly gets her legacy. Yes. But she gets her legacy, erm, in order to be able to show that she doesn't need it. Mm. Mm mm. Mm mm. In order to be able to, not give Yes. it up, you don't have to No. give it up But she did share it. but,yo er she did share, yes. Yes. And, and to be able to if you like, bring it as a dowry, but it wouldn't have mattered if she hadn't a penny. Yes. The sim the same with Helen Huntingdon. Oh yes. Yes. Quite. Mm. And you may as well have it if it doesn't matter because Mm. then you can show, as an author, that it doesn't matter. Mm mm. If you haven't got it then you could just, er other people just could be nice when they marry you and say that it doesn't matter that you haven't got it. Mm. No. But if you've got it and it doesn't matter, then you can really show it doesn't matter. And bearing in mind that anything that she had would automatically become Rochester's. Mm. Yes. Yes. Er, you know, because anything belonging to a wife belonged to her husband at that time. That's right. But he would also, in the spirit of their marriage, they Mm. they pooled everything didn't they? I mean, it was obvious that it was going to be erm, well, I mean, she'd been married, she's married, ten years Mm. by the time er the book ends. Yes. And this is a question that always occurs to me and I've read this novel several times, at the end of it why did she write it? Not why did Charlotte Bronte write it, why does Jane Eyre write it? Why does she write this story? Do you think? Because it's a long road from sad des desolation, being orphaned to true happiness. It's a love re really. Yes. It is a love story. It's also a spiritual journey and a, and a movement It's this to belonging and journey of fulfilment isn't it? Yes. Having some some fulfilment through adversity. Yes. Really. Why would you need to write it if you'd had the journey? To get it out of yourself a And exult to make the beginning Possibly yes. yes, to erm rational well to erm explain the beginning, you know, to, to get the hatred and the erm, sense of injustice out of your system.

The legal and political context within which they operate has changed dramatically with more legilay legislation. Since nineteen seventy four over two hundred separate regulations have been introduced and increased European influence has seen ov over thirty new sets of regulations and amendments currently in the pipeline. As these regulations come into force, shop stewards, safety reps and members place extra demands on the specialist providers of the union's health and safety service. But to our disgust, and as Nigel mentioned, also that we have seen a demise of factory inspectors, and this is borne out by the fact that figures at the present time show that an average workplace can be expected to be visited once in eleven years. There can be no doubt in anybody's eyes that the failure of the H S E to enforce the law along with unscrupulous employers, exploiting low inspection rates, mean that the role played by G M B safety reps and those who provide our backup service, are more important than ever before. With increased accident rates and the ever increasing development of small workplaces, with little health and safety protection where, where our members are mainly women, part-time workers, in addition to the growth of sub-contracting and competitive tendering, and the increasing number of home workers, mean that we have to re-evaluate our priorities, and as such our health and safety service must be equipped to provide all the necessary support and information to underpin our activities in these vital areas of recruitment and growing sections of employment. The introduction and distribution of safety representative kits is an important factor in the role of G M B members at local level, and I'm proud to say that in my own region, ninety three percent of the reps receive their kits. And it should be used not only to enhance the role of health and safety standards as well as business performance. Throughout the review which is clear that the un where the union's information and the role of the regional health and safety officers secured a high profile, then we were successful in getting across the message. We, in the Midlands, support the role that the Health and Safety Review document puts forward, and in concluding, President, I would just like to pay tribute to my regional committee and the work that they did, in getting the review off the ground in the first place. Colleagues, to all of you I would say, support the Health and Safety Review, come back next year, let's do a good job throughout the next year. Thank you Thanks very much Ken Tom President, er Congress, Tom , Liverpool, North Wales and Irish region Congress, it is well known in the trade union movements that the G M B is the leader on health, safety and environmental issues. In the scale of unnecessary occupational accidents and disease, we must ensure our service support effective activity at the workplace. At work, every week in the U K, there are around eleven people killed, six hundred seriously injured, and there are around ten thousand reported injuries where people are off work more than three days. Figures from the nineteen ninety Labour Force Survey estimates that a true figure of one point six million accidents occur every year. These accidents result in over thirteen million working days lost through work-related injuries. The survey also indicated that around two million people per year suffer from illnesses that are caused or made worse by their work. At the beginning of this year, new regulations covering the management of health and safety, all work equipment, manual handling, workplace standards, display screen equipment and personal protective equipment were enacted in the U K. These resulted from European Health and Safety Directives. In November last year, at a conference held by the G M B we highlighted the priorities needed to deal with these regulations. The scale of death, injury and disease in the U K and the implima implementation of new regulations should demand priority action from the government, yet their actions look set to attack health and safety standards. They've cut the Health and Safety Secretary's budget for this year, they're looking to privatize many of the H S E's functions, they've set up a review to identify health and safety legislation that is a so-called burden on employers. They will eliminate the grant for safety representatives' training by nineteen ninety five, how will any of this improve health and safety at the workplace? Congress, it won't. The government don't insist employers comply with the law, they encourage the law to be ignored. Such is the U K's contribution to European Year of Health and Safety. The government are failing in their duty to protect people, the employers are failing in their duty to protect people. The G M B must continue to fight for the best health and safety standards at the workplace. This special report provides a base from which we can develop our health, safety and environmental service into the next century. It will be needed when we consider the challenges to workplace standards that exist. On behalf of the Liverpool, North Wales and Irish region, I move in support of this special report. Thanks very much Tom. Congress, thank you very much indeed for that debate. It seems to me that there're just one or two points in which Nigel er needs to respond, so I'll ask him to do so briefly. Nigel. Thank you Mr President, just two points. Erm, there was a specific point raise re raised from Lancashire region, regarding briefing sessions for branch secretaries. That is our intention, er we are organizing briefing sessions for officers, and taking an approach which we want to get the information distributed to the workplace and that is clearly an area that we wanna develop. Erm, in the point that was raised from the London region, talking about resources in dealing with er regional health and safety officers and their time, part of the er document itself, is looking at consultation, so that the resource implications and the necessary action that we have to take in identifying priorities, deals with those things and those things are now opened up to discussion, er by accepting the report, and we'll be looking at that over this next year. Thank you. Thank thanks very much Nigel. Colleagues I put the special report to Congress, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Thank you very much. I now call motion two five eight, Cancer screening to be moved by the Liverpool region. Mentioned earlier, colleagues that erm, there are a number of motions, so if the movers and supporting speakers could come down to the rostrum, it would be er helpful. President, Congress, Theresa , Liverpool, North Wales and Ireland moving motion two five eight on cancer screening. It is a national disgrace, the U K is the only country in Europe to deny this facility to its citizens. Employers are prepared to spend millions of pounds on new technology, new machines, at the same time, not one penny on our members' health. Do these employers not realize these machines need us to operate them. They need our hands, our feet and most of all our minds, colleagues, what we are asking for is not a lot. The right to time off with pay for cancer screening. Colleagues, what we are speaking about here is death. The death of a member, the death of a person, the death of a mother. Colleagues, I move. Do you want some steps Maureen? Thanks Why did you say that? I'm sorry I'm gonna pay for that, and I'm sorry about that Maureen. President, comrades President, Congress, Maureen , Liverpool, North Wales and Irish region seconding resolution two five eight. Conference, hundreds of young women could be suffering from br breast cancer with little chance of it been detected. Startling evidence that the National Health Service cancer screening programme doesn't go far enough was revealed last November, with the release of shock figures from Action Cancer in Belfast. They found that two thirds of women who contracted breast cancer were outside the recognized screening age bracket of fifty to sixty four. In the past three years some nine hundred and thirty seven women have died from the disease, a hundred and forty six of them were under fifty. More than five hundred of the deaths were in the sixty four plus group. Under the present system, women aged between fifty and sixty four are routinely invited to be screened by the Health Boards. Action Cancer screened seven thousand three hundred and forty women at its Belfast clinic from January ninety one until March ninety two. Of these fifty five percent, fifty five percent were under the fifty were under fifty, another forty one percent fell inside the N H S brackets, with the remaining four percent sixty five years and over. The incidence of breast cancer detected is at odds with the government's claim that its programme has sufficient safeguards. Of the under fifties, it was found fifteen had breast cancer, compared to sixty in the fifty to sixty four group. This means that only a third who were found to have breast cancer would have been detected by breast screening. Conference, these statistics have been proved in one small area of the United Kingdom, the results if the same exercise was carried out across the length and breadth of the country would be frightening. But maybe if we did this exercise, countrywide, and enough people exer exerted pressure, then possibly we could force this government to do yet another famous U-turn, and start to inject some real money into the N H S. Just think what we could achieve with enough investment. Doctors could buy the much needed equipment, they wouldn't have to work such long hours, there would be no need to close down wards, aye or even hospitals. There would be no need for patients to be turned away through lack of beds. Congress, support the resolution, I second. Thank you Maureen. Colleagues, on composite motion thirty two, Toxic Shock Syndrome, I notice a number of colleagues went to the, the meeting that was held in the Conference Hall at lunchtime, and certainly for a few minutes, I had the opportunity to listen to some of the discussions that took place. Erm, I'm bound to say to Congress, that under normal circumstances, we don't take additional supporting speakers on resolutions, er and the reasons for that is very obvious, it's because of lack of time. However, I've got to say to Congress, that I consider this particular resolution and this particular matter very serious indeed, and I do know in fact, that there are certainly delegates, who're actually suffering today er from this particular er disease. So what I would like to suggest, on this, on this one occasion only, and without any, setting precedents for the future either at this congress or future congresses, that we make an exception, and that in this particular deb debate we take additional speakers. I hope that Congress would support that. Is that agreed? Thanks very much indeed. Kevin President, Kevin , Lancashire region, in the light of your comments, I must admit I don't expect anything less or more of G M B than what it always does, and that's put its actions where its words are. Today, the eighth of June, should have been, in Manchester, in Urmston in fact, for the family, there should have been a birthday party. A young girl, Alice, would have celebrated her seventeenth birthday today. Sadly, in that household today, there'll be no party. Let me tell you Alice's story. Alice , she could be your daughter, your girlfriend, your wife. Alice, in November nineteen ninety one, twenty fourth, the Sunday, she had a headache, wasn't feeling too great, during the evening she was able to watch television, but she was a bit sick during the night. Although very pale on the Monday, like many of your sons and daughters now, she decided it was more important to go to school to sit her mock G C S Es. So she went off to school. She was sent home after a short while because she was suffering what it looked like, a flu symptoms. She came home, went to bed. That evening she still wasn't feeling too great, but nevertheless was able to talk about the television she'd missed, the programmes she'd missed on telly. She took another aspirin, went to bed. At seven P M, she started to talk about the evening things and went to sleep. At ten P M she didn't seem too great either, her temperature had gone up a little bit, but nevertheless, she slept on. The next morning when her mother came to talk to her to see how she was, Alice's breathing was very shallow, and she had a very high temperature. The emergency doctor was called, the doctor phoned for an ambulance, and for Alice to be taken to hospital, but when the ambulance staff tested for her blood pressure, it was so low they hardly got a reading. She arrived at the hospital at nine A M, and her condition was diagnosed as toxic shock syndrome or meningitis. She was transferred to intensive care, her breathing gave great concern and therefore she was put on a br ventilator. Sadly the strain was far too much for poor Alice. Two heart attacks later, she died at one P M. It took less than forty eight hours for Alice to die. That's the reality of toxic shock. On my way to conference this morning, I went in and bought a packet of eight tampons. On the back is a warning, if you've got a magnifying glass that is. They finally put it on after pressure from the campaign. Inside you take the leaflet out, after you've taken all the other tampons out of course, because they block the removal of the leaflet, you get a leaflet like this. It's in eight different languages. In fact, it's in English down one side here. I'll tell you what you need even better mike er magnifying glass to read it. Toxic shock, the symptoms. I'll tell you what, me eyesight isn't great, but nevertheless I struggle with that. It's there, it's that little section in all of that. That's the safety warning. That's what we're calling for. Alice's parents didn't know about toxic shock, and the fact it could be related to using a tampon, but also the parents of some other children, other women didn't know either. Their daughters also died. It's caused by a bacteria that's on many of our skins. In fact you find it high up in your nose, remember that next time you pick your nose. In thirty five percent of women it's found in the vagina as well. The use of the tampon creates the right atmosphere for that bacteria to breed, and they very quickly start to attack the immune system of the body. It enters the body in the bloodstream through the vaginal wall. It attacks vital organs. Those who have survived this horrible, horrible illness, in fact, have often lost vital organs, have been left with a legacy that will last for their lives. One parent described the condition of her daughter in hospital, when she saw her, who was also suffering from toxic shock. There was a brown poison oozing from her eyes, nose, her ears, her gums. The smell was unbelievable. Lauren was rotting away in front of me. That is toxic shock syndrome. We're asking that you educate people about the symptoms. Thank God it is rare, but sadly attacks those who are young. Often, they're most at risk, and yet the manufacturers promote their products quite extensively in many hous of our schools, up and down this land. All we're asking for is a sense of balance, all we're asking for is for the facts put in there, so at least if the symptoms are made aware, then at least people are aware to do something about it. Because as I've described, time is of the essence, because if people don't realize the symptoms, then often the opportunity is missed. We're asking for a union campaign, and I've got to applaud Mick and APEX at the APEX conference, we are at the forefront of this issue, we've worked hard with that family, Jenny and Peter to bring this issue to the, to national attention, through that, our Euro M P, through Denise there, Denise has brought it into Europe. Today at the fringe meeting where seventy odd people attended, I've been inundated by people who've come forward and said we wanna raise it, we wanna put instructions on the machines that dispense these. You've heard the talk, the family their son, her brother, has helped to produce a video. He is nineteen. There'll be no birthday party in Manchester, but please God, Alice's memory will live on, and please God, maybe somebody else's daughter will be saved. Conference I thank you. President, Congress, Sheila , South Western region, pleased to second the composite. Delegates, can you see what I'm holding. Some of you probably can't, it's small. But this is a tampon and as I said, it's small. But the danger that it threatens is no small matter, and conference, it doesn't only affect women, because if you lose a child or a partner, a cousin, an aunt, or a sister, then brothers, it affects you. Toxic shock syndrome, T S S is a very rare complaint, linked with the use of vaginal tampons. It is a deadly and a serious one. It has killed three young women in Britain, in the past three years, and put many more in hospital. Deaths have also been reported in the United States, and if recovery is possible, then vital organs such as the liver, kidneys and lungs are badly damaged. Conference, young people especially need to be informed, as free samples are being given out in schools and colleges, and often the family of these young girls are unaware that their daughters are using these products even doctors and hospital staff fail to ask the question when these cases are admitted, are you using tampons? President, the under twenty fives are thought to be particularly at risk. Whilst there is no way at present to test whether this bacteria is carried, or if immunity to the toxin is low, awareness of the problem can minimize the risk, or the decision to use the tampon can be taken. Conference this motion calls upon Congress to organize a campaign to provide legislation to regulate all aspects of manufacture, coordinate research, and to raise awareness throughout the G M B membership, and also the general public. Please support the composite. Dorothy , Birmingham West Midlands region, supporting composite thirty two, speaking without the support of my region, but only because we didn't get around to discussing it, but we will, we will. Eight years ago, no nine years ago, I lost a three year old grandchild from something very much like T S S, and that was erm streptococcus septicaemia. Twenty four hours from onset to death. And because of a very mild T S S infection, it's very unlikely that my daughter will ever have another child, so I wholeheartedly support the composite motion, but want to emphasize what we as individuals must do. Yes, we do need new legislation. It's bad enough that unlike razor blades, which are zero rated, sanitary protection attracts seventeen and a half percent V A T because it is not classed as a medical necessity. Try telling that to a woman who bleeds five days in every month for thirty, thirty five, forty years of her life. Now we learn that tampons are not classed as medical appliances and therefore not subject to the same stringent government legislation on manufacture and sterility which applies to say condoms which when you come to think about it are destined for the same anatomical region. Yes, we do need a union led campaign to reach our members, but that is not enough. We all have a part to play. Just look at the T V hype on sanitary protection, especially tampons and see who it is aimed at. According to T V ads women do not menstruate if they are thirty, or forty, or fifty. We know they do. They don't menstruate if they're fat, or plain or disabled. The T V image woman does not push a buggy or a vacuum cleaner, or a lawnmower or a shopping trolley. More importantly from our point of view, she does not operate a press or a lathe, nor a welding machine or check-out till, nor a typewriter or computer, or an industrial sewing machine. She is not a home help or a hospital ancillary worker, in short she does not work, she is not in a trade union, so she will not read our journals. She is young slim and beautiful. She leads a glamorous, active exciting life. Indeed, if I used Tampax I might go hang-gliding this weekend. No, the image is aimed at the most vulnerable. Young girls eager to break into the heady delights of adult freema freedom and excitement. Who can't be bothered to read health warnings on cigarette packets let alone tampon packets. We have to reach them, but how? If you're a school governor or a member of a P T A or just a parent, you must demand that the real facts of life and death are part of sex and hygiene education. If you have daughter or a granddaughter, or a niece, you must speak out. If you are involved with a youth club, or guides, or venture scouts or whatever, anywhere you can reach the ears and minds of young girls you must speak out and tell it how it really is. Tampons are not smart. Tampons are not glamorous, they are truly bloody dangerous. Congress, delegates, please support, and please remember, and please, please act. Go on Joanne , Lancashire region supporting composite motion thirty two. President, Congress, I am a sufferer of toxic shock syndrome. Late last year I was getting terrible stomach pains. They started at the beginning of one week, by the Thursday, the pain and the sickness were so bad they took me to hospital. There, they gave tests and examined me. They could not find nothing wrong for why I was so ill. The doctors firstly thought I had food poisoning. They asked me personal questions that I could not even repeat here today. Finally after more tests, a nurse, not a doctor, asked if I had used tampons. I said yes, so she informed the doctor, who ordered some more tests. By this time, my temperature and blood pressure was so high I could not even be given a proper anaesthetic. I underwent the most frightening time of life, and all this was because of ignorance. We need to campaign, to urge, no urge is not strong enough, to insist that tampon manufacturers clearly highlight the symptoms and risks to users. I was told that my chances now have been greatly reduced of ever having my own family. At twenty five this is a very hard thing to be told. What future do I now have? I hope that by telling you my personal experience it will help to save others. Congress, please support this motion. President, Congress, Denise , from the South West region. Firstly, thank you very much Kevin, for the tribute, but there's a heck of a lot more people need their names included in that list and I think one of them's just joined it. I like to address this Congress very briefly, and I'd like to address the men. Please don't be embarrassed about this subject. I know it's not something that most of you are used to talking on a day to day basis, and if you go back to your workplace and you happen to be in a very male dominated workplace, it's not necessarily gonna be the easiest thing to broach with your colleagues when you get back. A little while ago, we heard about something called AIDS, and it's something that's terrified most of us in one way or another. When I first heard about it, someone said to me, within the next ten years, one of ten of us will know of someone who's died from it. That was about six years ago, I heard that, and I've heard of one person already that I've personally met. We've all come to use the word condom in public conversation and nobody gets embarrassed about that any more, and that's what has to happen now. Condoms are something that everyone uses every day. Tampons are something that only women use, but it's something that must become part of our voc vocabulary if we're to save lives. By avoiding this situation and pretending it's not happening means that we can actually be risking the lives of one our friends, one of our family. Please think about that. The legislation that we're trying to put into progress, through the cam campaign is obviously gonna take a long time to achieve, so word of mouth is absolutive absolutely vital. Please, I'll pass on the information that you've received, contact Kevin or myself for the details that are on the leaflets we've put about. If you want the information. The video is available. Please get your branch to buy a copy, ten pound is hardly any money at all from branch funds, so that you push this round and get it shown. As has been suggested by earlier speakers, please pass it on through schools, colleges wherever you might be active within the movement, or through children in local schools. I'd lastly like to say a thank you to Kevin, because I think, as a man, it is obviously more difficult for him to broach this subject, and he's been pursuing this through APEX through for a very long time, and has worked extremely hard, so I'd like to say thank you to him, and thank you to you now for taking the message back home. Hear, hear. Before we vote, I'll take one more speaker, Ken. President, Congress, Ken , Midland and East Coast region. Congress, I've come to the rostrum today because, some weeks ago, as Chairman of er Grimsby Constituency Labour Party, this leaflet arrived on the desk of our office. It somewhat shook me rigid, and through my colleague, Peggy who received a gold award this week, we got some of those leaflets, that were sent to us, and Peggy wrote a letter, around to the workplaces in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, and as a role, as trade union liaison officer with Grimsby C L P, she sent it to the workplaces within Grimsby. When I raised it as Chairman at the General Management Committee, I was disgusted to find that people laughed at the very subject that was so important to women who've come up here today to let us know the consequences of what was happening. I had to bawl those people out for not having due consideration to the effects of other human beings and the problems that they have. But from that meeting some good came, because thanks to Peggy , and the rest of the lady delegates from the G M B on the executive of the Grimsby C L P which amount to sixteen, I've managed to get two thousand toxic shock syndrome forms around United Biscuits, Ross Group, S G M Chemicals, the whole of the Humber bank, and everywhere else that we can get it into. I've also instructed the secretary of Great Grimsby C L P to write to the Education Authority, to get us into schools and colleges and when we received a reply from the Education Authority, to my dismay, they didn't know anything about it. Conference, I think you can see that we in Grimsby, have done a little bit, we would like to do more, we support the composite, and we support the lady speakers that've come up here today. I support. Thank you Ken. Colleagues, motion two six one, hormone replacement therapy, to be moved by G M B Scotland If the seconder and also the mover of two six nine from Yorks, would come to the front as well, and the Midland region who are moving comp six along with the C E C speaker Sue , we'd be very grateful. Time's moving on, colleagues, now. President, Congress, I'm Morag , G M B Scotland, moving motion two six one. It's hormone replacement the therapy, it's better known as H R T. Congress, the woman worker is often low paid, and suffers from the menopause symptom and has to pay the full prescription charges for a treatment of H R T. Every woman at Congress will sooner or later suffer through the menopause. Colleagues who suffer through the menopause sometimes can't afford to pay the high cost of a pre-paid prescription charge. It's about fifty pound now there somewhere, this is unfair of this Tory government, who by the way doesn't agree with women in the front benches. Virginia Bottomley, she'd get more sympathy to the women of Britain and give the treatment free of charge. Mrs Bottomley do you suffer with these symptoms of the menopause? I wonder. I would have this country,con congress, to support this motion for the health and welfare of women members of the G B M B trade union, I move. Thank you very much for listening. Seconder for two six one , Chair, Conference, seconding motion two six one. H R T contains es oestrogen, which is highly beneficial to older women at the change when they lose their natural supply. It gives them energy and helps them in general physical and mental health. It's also good for the skin. Above all, it strengthens bones and prevents brittle bone disease. Hip replacement operations are gone with it. Think of the cost of these on the National Health Service, it's costing a fortune. H R T will avoid these problems for most women. Some sources argue, it slightly increases the risk of breast cancer. What doesn't nowadays? Free H R T could save the National Health Service millions by keeping women healthier, happier and active. It also means women workers having less time off sick, having more energy and more strength throughout the menopause. It costs more than a normal prescription, two or three times as much, one charge for each hormone they contain, yet means the difference between health or serious illness and peace of mind for you and your partner. I second. Motion two six nine, Yorkshire. Maureen , Yorkshire, North D Derbyshire region speaking in support of motion two six nine, Working Women's Safety. There has been a marked increase in the number of women working in isolated areas and the G M B has been campaigning for improvements in safety on public transport, a campaign which must continue. Employers must also real realize their responsibilities in ensuring that their employees do not work in fear of attack. If employees, employers put the same importance on the safety and security of their fav female employees as they do on the security of their property, there would probably be an instant improvement. Women who work in community are particularly at risk, housing wardens and particularly home care assistants, who work in some of the worst inner city areas are very often called out at night to attend someone who has been taken ill and yet no thought is given to the potential danger they could be facing in carrying out their job or what, to or what preventive measures can be taken. Whilst we appreciate the financial constraints being faced upon the public sector, we must not accept this as a reason for doing nothing. The importance of women's safety at work cannot be underestimated, and we need to pursue this issue in the workplace, in the community and at local national level. Safety represen representatives should place women's safety on safety committee's agenda and it should remain there until improvements are achieved. Further pressure should be brought to bear through local and national negotiation ma machinery. Lobbies of local councillors for improvements in street lighting should be organized, campaigns organized in conjunction with trade councils would raise awareness of the general public and we should also involve the transport unions. And last, but not least, everyone in Congress has a responsibility to go back to their workplaces and communities and begin the campaign, not next year, or the year after, but next week. Congress support. Thank you very much seconder for two six nine Linda , Yorkshire and North Derbyshire region seconding motion two six nine on Working Women's Safety. President, Congress. Rapes, murders, assaults, kidnaps and muggings are reported daily in newspapers and in the media. Violent crime is increasing at an alarming rate, and more and more of our members are at risk of becoming victims. I work at a distribution centre, where there is continuous shiftwork, which means that women and men are walking home at all hours of day and night often taking short-cuts across playing fields and waste land, totally unaware of the potential dangers. If we have our own transport, our car is in the darkest, remotest area. I'm sure this sounds familiar. Isn't it strange that the well lit, easily accessible car park is reserved for managers? Many regions have produced guidelines on personal safety, and have advised branches where personal attack alarms can be purchased at a very reasonable cost. This should clearly demonstrate to employers that the G M B takes this issue seriously and negotiators at all levels should be encouraged to approach employers to purchase personal attack alarms for their employees at risk. My region and the G M B are very concerned for our members' safety. Employers should also be concerned. There are several ways in which employers can take a positive lead in, lead by organizing awareness training. Assistance can be sought through community police departments, who will usually provide a speaker to talk to employers and their employees about all aspects of risk. Employers could also provide extra lighting in car parks and on paths on their premises, and to consider providing free transport to and from work, particularly for evening and night workers. The cost of these actions would not be prohib prohibitive, and would be offset by the savings achieved in increased morale and not having to subsidize violent crime through sick pay schemes. Congress support. Composite motion six, to be moved by Midlands, seconded by Southern. Peggy , Midlands and East Coast region, moving composite six, Harassment and Bullying at Work. President, delegates, harassment has been clearly defined, and c can take a number of forms. It can be sexual, racial, physical, verbal or bullying. It can come from various sources, bosses, colleagues, customers, clients or the public at large. Harassment is perhaps the most widespread problem in, in Britain today. Managers con who constantly pick on individuals sometimes resulting in sudden and unsupportable dismissals. The more vulnerable the person is at their place of work, the more often harassment takes place. The victims of harassment are reluctant to make a complaint for a number of reasons. They are embarrassed by the conduct, and don't want to talk about it. They fear victimization especially if the harasser is their boss or someone senior to them. They hope that if they ignore the, the behaviour it will stop or they don't believe their complaint will be taken seriously or that any action will be taken at all. President, colleagues, as most of you are aware I work in the food industry, in, in this industry the majority are female. Some of the horror stories that I hear are horrendous, but I want to tell you three issues that I do actually know about. I know of a young female who had to show a leading hand a tampon out of her pocket, to prove that she needed a toilet. I know of a manager who seems to get great pleasure by bullying females and male w and male workers. I know of a female member of this union who was sexually abused by her male colleagues, who I might add, are members of the G M B. She made numerous complaints to her manager, who happened to be male, what did he do? Nothing, nothing at all. He ignored her complaints. What did she do? Who could she turn to? She turned to the union. The G M B, who have taken up her case, which is still ongoing today. President, colleagues, this harassment has got to be stopped. There must be hundreds of females and males out there too frightened to speak out in case they lose their jobs, because let's not forget there have been many cases in which males have been harassed or are being ha harassed. Conference, I was pleased to read that British Gas has implemented an employee harassment policy and procedure scheme, to help employers deal with this issue. Since it started in December nineteen ninety one, two hundred and sixty nine workplace counsellors have been trained to help employees with this problem. In most cases, problems have been resolved informally. To date, four cases have gone through the disciplinary procedure. Conference, you have the composite in front of her, in front of you, you've heard the facts from myself, please support the composite as it can and it will affect you all. I move. Will the seconder from Southern. Formally seconded. Thank you very much indeed. Call Sue to put the C E C position. Sue , speaking on behalf of the C E C and it's nice to be back, and it's nice to be feeling well again. In respect of these erm motions, I'd like to make a couple of points on each one. The cancer screening, everybody must remember as Kevin said on the toxic shock erm motion, that it's your wife, your sister, your daughter who needs the cancer screening, the same thing applies to the toxic shock syndrome. It applies to health right across the board. As far as ho erm the H R T is erm here we go you see, this is post-natal illness this is right, we need one on that as well, but what we need to know, and what we need to be aware of, is that the discussion has to be actually put out through the members in the same sort of way as Ken and Peggy have done in the erm Midland and East Coast region and also on Working Women's Safety, it needs to be taken on board that we are absolutely fed up , sick to death and absolutely running out of patience at having to hammer home this thing about equality. There is no need for us to actually have to drill into people, that we don't want to be bullied, pushed around, and that nine times out of ten, the violence or the bullying is male to female. It's not always that way, but we are absolutely sick and tired of it and it's about and sisters, that whenever we come across it, we make sure that those people don't continue that type of harassment. With apologies for not being a perfect speech, but without any apologies for the symptoms that I'm suffering too, because you all need to know about that as well. Thank you. Colleagues, the C E C are supporting all the motions that have just been debated, and I propose to take the vote. Motion two five eight, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Composite motion thirty two, all those in favour Against? That's carried. Motion two six one, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Motion two six nine, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Composite motion six, all those in favour? That's carried, anybody against? Er, colleagues, health and environment, composite motion five, to be moved by Midland, motion two six four, green issues in the environment, Lancashire region to move, motion two six five, noise pollution to be moved by G M B Scotland, motion two six six, Birmingham personal injuries disclaimers. Motion two six eight, alcohol in the workplace, Birmingham to move. Comp seven, Lancashire region to move. Now, that obviously means, colleagues that we're, we're going over for a period of time, but we're er slightly behind this afternoon, so certainly need to be trying to pull some work back. as I'm aware there are no references in any objections to the wider question of whether or not the village should be washed-over or be inset. I have therefore to agree with both the councils, that the comments you have just made and which you make at some length in your proof on this point, amount in effect to a late objection. Neither council wants me to deal with this as a late objection. It is therefore a matter which lies within my discretion as to whether or not I take it as a late objection. I am not convinced that special circumstances apply in this case which override the which is advice given very clearly in the P P G Twelve, that, in general, late objections should not be entertained except in most exceptional circumstances. I should however indicate that to understand properly what is the appropriate position for an inset boundary, I have to look at the reasons for there being an inset at all for the village, as, as you correctly indicate, it lies plainly otherwise within the general extent of the greenbelt. It may, therefore, be necessary to examine why the two councils did not adopt the alternative approach of washing-over the village. You are, however of course, aware that this background to insetting was discussed at some length yesterday, in the context of another village. There would,therefore in any event, be no need and no advantage for me, in repeating all that was said then. And this is of course, as if I agree with the view that you expressed yesterday in a general context, although it was made specifically then in relation to one village, any recommendation I make in relation to that village, if it is based on the general principle , must apply by analogy also to Skelton, and I would have little choice but to recommend to the councils that they may wish or indeed they should, reconsider this question of washing-over or insetting elsewhere. I think I hope that that is clear. It i it is I appreciate er a difficult er course now to steer between approaching head-on an objection which is a late objection and dealing by er reference to obliquely perhaps to matters that have been dealt with elsewhere to the question of washing-over, but I'm sure that you can steer this particular course or cross this particular tightrope with success. Sir, we are much obliged to you for your consideration upon this matter, and I assure you that I shall do my best to avoid in the evidence which I shall give and in my other remarks apparently proposing a washed-over status for the village as a whole. However, it may incidentally erm come into the words that I use that erm er I'm referring to the washed-over or other status of these two sites. I shall endeavour to avoid that, and I ask your indulgence if this happens, since to a great extent one cannot erm select particular sentences erm that have not already documents. Sir, if it is your wish, I will now open the case. Please, yes. A are you going to be reading from your summary? Er when I give my expert evidence, I will read from the summary. Sir it is my wont to open er a case of this kind with a quotation. In nineteen fifty three, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government issued their Design Town and Village manual and because of difficulties attending design concepts, the manual was made up of essays by eminent planners on various topics, with the full imprimatur of the minister. A contribution relating to the English village was made by the late Thomas , and he had this to say . It has sometimes been claimed that the village is a peculiarly English invention. Whether that is so or not, the English village is, I believe, among the pleasantest and most places that men have ever built to live in,and certainly it has a physical character and appearance that is strongly its own. Whatever may be its points of similarity to, or difference from, other countries' villages as social institutions,it has very special qualities of picturesqueness, not of course to be confused with quaintness. I do not think that these qualities arise wholly, or even mainly, as it is so often assumed, from the character of its buildings and the beauty of the natural forms, such as trees, which stand in juxtaposition to them. I believe that they lie as much, or even more, in the form in the ground plan which the buildings and the natural objects together make. Sir,you have heard the virtues of various villages around York extolled at earlier hearings in this enquiry. You have heard in response to a direct question put by yourself to an expert for North Yorkshire County Council, that he regarded the village of Flaxton as making a contribution to the historic setting of York, that it had a greenbelt function . You have heard of the historical circumstances attendant on some of the villages, and you have heard of the beauty of them. We have ranged wide. Thaxton, Flaxton, Sand Hutton, Upper Poppleton, they have all come before you. Sir, today you have before you what I believe is the most important village still existing close to York, which has, over a considerable part of its area, extant at this day a medieval character and feel. Skelton is a very special village towards its north side. Sir, Skelton has made its contribution to York's housing problem in the past. An inset was at one time created for Skelton, and it resulted in a considerable amount of building on the south side. That building is not in character with the main part of the village to the north side. It is quite obviously a twentieth century excrescence, however good it may be in itself as such. Sir, Skelton has taken all of that that it could possibly stand, without destruction. To envisage any modern development at all on the north side would be catastrophic, having regard to the very special properties which there exist, qualities which contribute, undoubtedly, to the historic setting of York. Skelton is a village whose residents are proud . They are increasingly aware of their heritage. The Village Trust is a respected body which has been in existence for many years. learned contributions have been made, and in that connection, I need only refer to some which are part of the appendices for the case before you today,notedly the contribution made following recent research by Mrs on archaeological matters of significance to this particular area. I could go on for some time sir, but I will now proceed to the technical planning matters . I'm a Bachelor of Science in Estate Management in the University of London, and a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. My first main appointment subsequent to the War was in the Planning Technique Division of the Headquarters Technical Directorate, in the then Ministry of Town and Country Planning, St James's Square. During the later part of my career, I was University Estates Officer to the new University of York from the university's inception in ninety sixty three until my retirement. Skelton is a village with a long history and an attractive character in the area of the church . It is here that William the Conqueror is said to have bribed two friars to help him gain access to the City of York after he had besieged it unsuccessfully. In eleven sixty six one David le , the Keeper of the King's , was granted an allowance and certain rights here. The church,which is a gem of early English architecture, and which with the green is the focal point of the village, was built about twelve forty seven, aided by the treasurer of York Minster. There are many stylistic aspects which are reflected in this . The coverage of the conservation area, which is one of the earliest created in North Yorkshire, dating from nineteen seventy two, not nineteen seventy as written,is limited to that part of the settlement which has notable village character and contains listed buildings. It includes the present D thirty nine site, near to the sixteenth or seventeenth century Skelton Manor House, and it has important archaeological and nature conservation interests as described in reports . Skelton is well within the general area of the approved York greenbelt, and is a small free-standing settlement that was washed-over by the greenbelt in the draft Southern Ryedale District Plan of nineteen eighty one. This plan underwent the full consultation stage and was employed for over ten years for development control purposes. The Greater York study did not designate Skelton as an area for expansion until two thousand and six, and no proposal exists in other plans for the making of an inset into the greenbelt on the basis of the need for expansion. Sites D thirty nine and D forty are in any case not located within the built-up area of the settlement in terms of Greenbelt Plan Policy Four. Sir, in making reference to erm policies which erm have relevance to the question of the status of the two sites we're concerned with, I will start with those which are part of the statutory plan, that is to say the North Yorkshire County Structure Plan approved by the Secretary of State, and then proceed downwards to the more recent documents which do not employ . So in paragraph six I start with the C S P . The north side of the village could not accommodate additional development without detriment to its basic form and character in the terms of Structure Plan Policy H Three . As mentioned in paragraph twenty three of my proof, an appeal decision relating to land immediately east of D thirty nine referred to the unsuitability for development of that area,Since the character of the village would be seriously harmed . Policy H Four of the approved county structure plan precludes any development which is more than small- scale. Structure Plan Policy E Four, and er erm that is a correction sir, I have E Five down there, Thank you. Structure Plan Policy E Four provides that conservation areas will be afforded the strictest protection. Can I help you Mr ? What what are you looking for ? Thank you, I do apologize sir. Erm Right. Is it E Four you're looking for? Er no sir, er E Four I will take as read. But we now have erm following research by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust in relation to the document that I have described as appendix eight. Erm the reference on page two of erm the Conservation Officer's er letter, Mr 's letter of the fourth of February, a reference to Policy E Six of the County Structure Plan, erm which in his expert opinion, very firmly covers sites like this one. Er I think that er I will not read any more of that letter at present, but er certainly it's not only E Four but E Six er of the C S P which applies here. I would be grateful if at some point Mr you were to deal with er Doctor 's er most recent comments on the Greater Crested Newt, since of course I've only just had those er more or less on coming into this room, and I haven't had a chance Yes. to read it or think about it. Yes sir. Erm I will in fact deal with that now as an aside, a very necessary one too. Could you start off by telling me which pond it is we're talking about? Yes. Because I just want to be sure. There are two ponds of course which are shown on There is the much larger pond Yes. to the east of Oakwood, and the smaller one west of Skelton Manor Court . Yes. We're talking about the one within erm the er area known as D thirty nine sir, I thought it might be . er which is immediately west of Manor Court. Erm sir, I don't know whether you and my friends erm on the bench opposite had an opportunity last evening of erm having glimpsed at Tomorrow's World, but I fear not, I was too busy reading your proofs. . Oh thank you sir, I'm much obliged for that. Erm I lighted on it almost by accident, and er it was very interesting in that erm the Great Crested Newt was featured, as a result of the action of the Secretary of State in refusing an application by British Coal for open-cast coal mine. And the reason was that er part of the area at a pond near the was erm an ancestral home of the newt. Erm a reference was made er by the by British Coal to erm er their erm absolute willingness to provide ponds elsewhere. The Secretary of State was not convinced er that er a habitat would be taken up er elsewhere. And sir, the letter which you have before you er dated twentieth April from Doctor , is very much on that tack. We noticed that as one of Mrs 's appendices er there was a reference to a willingness by one of her clients to provide other ponds,were development to er proceed on the area known as D thirty nine. And erm er Doctor has looked into this matter, and you will see in the fourth paragraph of his letter of the twentieth is obviously highly selective and . You can take a newt to water, but you can't make him swim. . Thank you sir. Er sir, I will leave you to read the rest of that letter. Alterations have been deposited to the County Structure Plan, and erm that took place before this hearing er before this enquiry opened. Policy E Two of the proposed Structure Plan alteration number three applies to all land outside existing built areas and countryside outside the greenbelt. And this policy would therefore preclude the development of D thirty nine and D forty . , could you just er wait for a second? Well I I think probably I can compete with the Tornadoes now by raising my voice. Right, thank you very much, that's . Yes? Thank you. Erm and Policy E Two provides that development in the open countryside will not be permitted. It goes on in more detail but that is the basis of it. So that erm would appear to preclude development of D thirty nine and D forty in any case, no need having been established. Reserves of potential development land in such locations are not provided for in any policy. We now turn to Southern Ryedale, sir. Southern Ryedale Local Plan Policy C One Three would preclude the development of D thirty nine as the development of that whole area would not enhance the character of the conservation area. I think it's worth actually looking at that policy. It reads,In conservation areas, permission will only be granted for developments including changes of use, especially from residential from residential use, providing that they enhance the character of the existing buildings in terms of design, scale, grouping, materials, and will not cumulatively substantially increase the generation of traffic, parking and other activities, beyond the environmental capacity of the conservation area . Sir, it is my opinion that any development in area D thirty nine, which is wholly within the conservation area, would have those deleterious effects, and the same applies for D forty two D forty two. Continuing with the Southern Ryedale Plan,Policy E N V One normally precludes new development outside the existing built-up areas in the absence of exceptional circumstances. It reads,New development will normally be permitted outside the existing built-up areas only where it is essential to the needs of agriculture or forestry, or there are other exceptional circumstances . While as settlement within the greenbelt, development could not normally be permitted on D thirty nine and D forty, as these are outside the built area in the terms of Policy G B Three, which we have oft considered at erm this enquiry. Policy H Seven applies in the event of Skelton being an inset area when any development would have to be within the settlement, and no more than small-scale, precluding D thirty nine and D forty. It is submitted that the whole of Skelton Village should be looked at as a unity,that there is extreme environmental value over its north part,and that were the village inset into the greenbelt, the inset boundary should be precisely as shown in the deposit copy of Southern Ryedale's Local Plan. Thank you very much. Mr please. Mr , you're probably aware that the deposit plan inset boundary for Skelton is the same as that was shown in the consultation draft of the greenbelt plan. Er yes I am. And you will probably be aware that at the consultation draft stage, which shows the same boundaries as are in the deposit plan, both the Parish Council and the Village Trust supported the inset boundary as shown drawn in the consultation draft. Were you aware of that? Can I be clear what you mean by Mr ? When you say Supported, do you mean they didn't object or do you mean they No. actually supported ? They made representations supporting the proposed inset boundary for Skelton, both the Parish Council and the Village Trust. Thank you. It's er it's page one hundred and three of the consultation draft, report on the consultation. Do I have that document? I don't think I No you may not Not at this stage in the enquiry sir, I'm not going to produce any great er any any documents . Were you aware of that er Mr ? I was not aware of that. I came into the Skelton case at a much later stage. Erm I would say however that there has been far more consistency about the view taken of the need for greenbelt protection on the part of the bodies and individuals I represent than has been shown by the two planning authorities judging from all the changes that they have propagated. And at the deposit stage,erm Mr , Skelton Village Trust made objection to site D thirty nine? Having previously supported the site D thirty nine being within the inset? Do you know when they changed their mind? No. Do you know why er the Parish Council made no objection to site D thirty nine being included within the inset at the deposit plan stage? No. Do the Parish Council object to site D thirty nine being shown within the inset? As instructed, erm I present a case which is unified on behalf of all the bodies and persons I represent. There is an objection to the whole of D thirty nine and D forty not being within the greenbelt. Well y you'll appreciate why I've asked the question er Mr , because they supported it, they made representations in support at the consultation draft stage, they didn't object at the deposit stage, and yet today, as I understand your evidence, you're telling us that they do object to site D thirty nine being shown within the inset. The objection, I repeat, is a unified objection, but I have no doubt that earnest consultations will have taken place not only by the bodies I represent in the past, but also by your own authority. I'm a little concerned here Mr . It it does seem to me that the Parish Council are of course an an elected body, who will if they have views on this subject no doubt have formal minutes which will set it out one way or the other. I'm wondering whether this might be an exceptional case, where er during cross-examination Mr might take instruction from his clients to find out what their minutes actually say. It must be a matter of record. Well i i indeed. So that was going to be my next question, I apologize Mr . as to whether or not there were any . Er as to whether there were any recor if there are any record or minutes as to when er the the change of mind occurred, er because plainly there there has been a change of mind. Now Er well th er th members of the Parish Council if there are any present as I imagine there are, will have heard my question. let's proceed and perhaps erm at a convenient moment we could take instructions as to er what resolutions if any have been made in this regard. Sir I will take this on board, but I think it comes rather badly from an authority in fact both authorities which have so shown so many confusing changes of mind about this area in the whole process since the first plan was issued, that the er details of the consideration by one of the constituent bodies of this erm objection er should be er examined er in such detail. Erm we don't know the details of the consideration that has been given by the authorities, what we are concerned with is what they are now proposing. What I believe you should be concerned with is what the erm persons I represent, bodies I represent, now wish to see happening with regard to these two sites. I think Mr what I would like to see, I don't want to go too far into the history, but I would just like to be sure that er bearing in mind this complex history given on behalf of those you are representing, that the views you are putting forward are the er current views of the Parish Council as expressed in their formal minutes. I w that is all I want to know. Yes sir. As a matter of fact I'm sure . . Mr , you and I have debated in the past er in this room er whether or not exceptional circumstances are necessary to define an inset boundary for a village which in the sketch plan of the greenbelt to have been shown as washed over. We've had that debate before haven't we? Yes, we've covered various subjects er more than once, er so much so that er I would be much obliged if you would er focus on a particular instance that I could then have an opportunity to recall . Well Mr , your memory appears to be very short. We debated it yesterday. Right, I know now what you're referring to. Er you I take it you haven't changed your mind and you still maintain that exceptional circumstances are necessary, because that is how you view, how you read paragraph nine of P P G Two? Yes, and that is because we have an approved structure plan which indicates the general extent of the greenbelt, and we're not talking here about an inner boundary or an outer boundary, we're concerned with a pre-standing settlement. You erm understand I think, or will understand Mr , that if these sites are not included in the greenbelt, that's to say if they are shown as part of the inset, so far as the greenbelt local plan is cer is concerned, they have no other designation, that's to say the greenbelt local plan doesn't purport to er allocate or to designate the land for any other purposes. Correct. It's simply the conclusion that the land doesn't serve any greenbelt purpose. Yes that would be your reasoning, yes. Now the questions we have to address here today Mr , er are whether or not er this land, these two parcels of land, serve any greenbelt functions or not. That's the principle issue between us isn't it? Not entirely. I would not exclude a consideration of the greenbelt functions served by the area, but it is not for us to question the correctness of the approval by the Secretary of State for the Environment of the general extent of the greenbelt for York. A general extent of greenbelt within which this area lies. Therefore, unless excluded from the greenbelt by a particular process, all land in this area must be assumed to have a greenbelt purpose. Well Mr , that would apply to er any land lying within a six- mile radius of the city centre. Apart from the considerations which I mentioned a few moments ago, it would indeed. Well is er Mr the issue which the inspectors ought to be er addressing themselves whether or not this land serves a greenbelt purpose, or not? I said a few moments ago that I would not exclude consideration or the need for consideration of the greenbelt purposes served. What I attempted to tell you was that there is essentially no region that in respect of any land which lies within the general area of the statutorily approved greenbelt, its mere existence within the greenbelt must be taken to mean that it has a greenbelt function. But y you a are asking the inspectors to proceed on the basis that all land within the six-mile radius of the city centre serves a greenbelt function? Unless, under some process, it has been excluded from the greenbelt, yes. And it would be excluded from the greenbelt because it didn't serve a greenbelt function? It might be excluded for various reasons. Well what's another reason? The most obvious is that er an area had been inset because of the need for expansion of a settlement. That wouldn't serve a greenbelt purpose? It would not in the future as a result of that subsequent building . That is your Haxby-Wigginton case. You do recall our argument yesterday. Haxby-Wigginton, which has been allowed by Ryedale District Council, as the result of Or its predecessor , as the result of the creation of an inset, to develop to the size of Malton. One of the er matters that er one needs to apply one's mind to in considering whether or not this land serves a greenbelt function or not, is to look at the land and assess whether or not it is more closely associated with the village or more closely associated with the er agricultural open land beyond the village. No. There is no necessary requirement to do that. And although it may be one means of looking at the site, it is not an essential part of determining greenbelt function. Is one of the matters to which the inspectors ought to be applying their mind whether or not this land is more appropriately regarded as countryside or part of the village? No, for the reason given in my last answer. Is one of the matters to which the inspectors ought to be applying their mind Would development of the site these sites amount to encroachment into the countryside? Indeed so. Well how can you decide that, without first deciding whether or not this land is part of the open countryside or part of the village? It is not necessary to incorporate the concept of being part of. It is simply necessary to ask whether the matter the whether the land is open land or not open land. The issue is whether or not the land is open land or not open land? It is essentially as simple as that. And all open land therefore Does it follow from what you say that all open land necessarily must serve a greenbelt function? I would never in a planning matter, readily make an absolute statement like that. In nearly all matters of physical planning there are exceptions. But I would say that the way to look at this site is to ask whether it is part of the built area, in other words whether it is built on, or whether it is not part of the built area, in other words it is not built on. Well that was the question that Mr asked you a few minutes ago wasn't it,er Mr ? Sir, at that stage, the emphasis seemed to be erm a connection er whether the connection was principally with other land outside or whether the connection was with the settlement, rather than the nature of the land itself. And my answers were in that sense. Do you regard Er so sorry Mr . I'm sorry sir. Er forgive me interrupting, but I I I don't understand the word that you're using Mr . When you say land is built-up, presumably you do not mean simply that there is a building that there has to be a building on the land. Er to a greater or lesser extent, land within the curtilage of that building er can also be described as built-up . Is is that correct? In general terms yes sir, one would look at the curtilage of a building, yes. . But if on the other hand the curtilage were particularly large, erm then er it it were otherwise unbuilt er it would not of necessity form part of the built area of the settlement, if the situation were on the periphery. What I'm trying to understand you'll appreciate Mr , is the difference between the test that you are putting forward, er which is whether or not it is part of a built-up area, and the test that Mr is putting forward, whether or not the land is part of the village. At the moment I'm not entirely clear what the difference is between these two forms of words. If you can help me more on that, er that would I'm sure assist my judgement. I would say sir that my approach is neither. It is to look at the characteristics of the land itself, rather than to associate it of necessity with the land on one side of it or the land on the other side of it. When we look at the characteristics of the land itself, do we have to decide whether it's countryside or not countryside? You do not necessarily have to decide that. Well what are the characteristics of this land? These sites are small fields. One's a paddock. A paddock is defined in the nineteen ninety concise Oxford as a small field. Therefore a paddock. I don't think we need to particular distinctions. . Your The site C can you look at appendix two of er Mrs 's er appendices please,Mr ? While you are finding that, could I make a general request of the counsels. It would greatly assist me er if I could have a copy of a one to two thousand five hundred plan showing these lands without any er heavy lines on them. I'm having some difficulty working out where fences go because they're obscured by these twenty foot wide er lines. Sir I've got one here . Ah. I if that could be copied er perhaps er that would be of great assistance. Thank you Mr . Er Mr , could you just repeat I er appendix two Er Mrs , yes. Right, thank you. In order to focus in on I don't think that's er Mrs 's appendix two, but i i it It it's the bigger it's the one with the bigger scale, yes. Presumably nothing turns on which plan No I I don't think it does,i save that one makes reference to features on a particular plan Er yes I think it may help . Right, yes. You've got it, have you ? Do you s you can see where it's indicated on the plan where topic area D thirty nine is? Yes. You you see the land to the er generally to the east of it where there's the large pond? Yes. A substa substantial area of open land which is shown there as being within the inset of the village? Yes. That land you obviously regard as being properly included within the inset? I've not made any comment about Skelton Hall. Do you want to make any now? Can you assist us? Do you regard that land as being within properly included in the inset or not? I've not had the benefit of walking round the grounds of Skelton Hall. And the er the boundary to the north of topic area D forty nine, indeed to the north of topic area You said forty nine. Thirty nine, I beg your pardon. Thirty nine, and topic area D forty, you'll be familiar with those boundaries? Yes. Trees, hedges, trees, and there's a track on the northern side. Indeed. And the boundary along the western side of topic area D forty is the A Nineteen Yes. and er the the vegetation alongside the A Nineteen . Yes. And those are perfectly satisfactory boundaries for greenbelt purposes aren't they? Yes. Defining greenbelt purposes. One of the points you make in your er evidence erm Mr is that because topic area D thirty nine is shown as being within the conservation area, that it ought to be included within the greenbelt. That's right isn't it? On that point, I would say that there are a number of considerations which arise as the result of that site being within the conservation area that militate against development in themselves, and this is in general well recognized on your side, and by the er er by the City Council. And you're on you're supportive of the conservation area and its boundaries? Yes. Can you look please at your a appendix one,in your bundle of appendices? Yes. And if we turn er to the last page of the first appendix, we can see the boundary of the conservation area. Yes. It's shown by the erm large dotted line, and we can see how it er follows the boundary of topic area D thirty nine. Yes. Would you turn back one page please, and look at Two pages I beg your pardon. Turn back two pages, and look at paragraph four of the report which we can see is headed Description of Conservation Area . Have you got that? Yes. Can you turn over the page again now, I want you to direct your attention to paragraph four point six of this report,which reads The boundary proposed for the conservation area is limited to that part of the settlement which retains its village character . Yes. Do you agree with that? I have no reason to disagree. Yes. Thank you Mr . Thank you very much. Mr please. Thank you sir. I shan't detain you long Mr . Mr , erm paragraphs twenty four er to thirty of your proof draw our attention to the existence of the conservation area which was being debating a matter of moments ago. Yes? Yes. Paragraph thirty one you deal with access difficulties. Paragraph thirty two and thirty three you deal with proximity of listed buildings. Paragraph thirty eight you deal with er ecological interest, and paragraph forty, archaeological interest. I think that's a fair summary of paragraph . That's right. None of those factors, er I hope we can agree, have any relevance at all do they to the issue of whether a site performs one of the five greenbelt functions? The answer to that is not straightforward. You started with paragraph twenty four, which deals with the conservation area. Yes. The characteristics Er this is a general observation. The characteristics of a conservation are are usually characteristics of special quality in environmental or building terms, and as such they are likely to promote a contribution to the quality of the setting of York where they occur within the greenbelt area . And that of course is the prime purpose of the York greenbelt. I must have been misguiding myself for a very long time Mr . I'd always understood that land should only go into the greenbelt if it was necessary to be kept permanently open, by reason of it performing one of the five purposes. Now again, where do I find in any government guidance a suggestion that the fact of the existence of a conservation area is directly relevant to the determination of whether or not land performs one of those five purposes? You have heard my opinion that in general terms, the existence of a conservation area is an indication of the likelihood of a contribution being made to the special character of the settlement and therefore to the setting of York, which is the prime purpose or the prime function of the York greenbelt. Well,as far as one is concerned with the A Nineteen, er isn't it fair to say that the northern and western boundaries are so er constructed with hedges and trees that in fact while er er one is travelling along the A Nineteen one doesn't actually have any meaningful view of the conservation area in any event? Mr , it is not necessary for a passing motorist to be able to appreciate the qualities of a settlement that he is passing. It is sufficient for the quality of that settlement to be such as to inherently improve the setting of the city . Can you see York from within the conservation area? Certainly . Yes. Yes. We'll deal with Mr 's answer if you don't mind. he can erm answer for himself. Mr , you've taken issue with the conservation area. Of course I dealt also with a large number of other factors , highways, environmental considerations, archaeology. I take it from the nature of your answer that you would in any event agree that none of those other factors which you concern yourself with have any relevance as to whether or not the land performs a greenbelt function? Certainly listed buildings do. As regards highways, they do in this case because the nature of the road pattern in this part of Skelton is such as to contribute materially to the characteristics of this ancient part of the village. I would refer you to the late . Erm it is a contribution by those er road patterns and the characteristics of the lanes, Church Lane in particular, Northfield Lane, that contribute to the quality of the environment. And we are talking about this environment, and the contribution it makes to the city of York. We are not talking about whether one can appreciate the city of York itself from here. The quality of Skelton is what we're talking about. Well I have your answer Mr , but I don't think that continuing this national . You remind us in paragraph twenty three of an earlier decision letter. And in that you er remind us of the view of the inspector that er this area has a strongly rural character. Yeah? You have that? Yes. Isn't it fair to say that that in itself does not justify greenbelt designation, what is important is if the site forms part of the countryside and makes a contribution to it? Here again I think that you're in danger of drifting from the essential feature, which is that in the absence of a requirement to take land out of the greenbelt, the whole of the area er within the general extent of the greenbelt as approved by the Secretary of State erm has a greenbelt function. Well I know you'd love to debate that with me, but we devoted a whole morning to it yesterday so I'm not going to . With regard to the inspector's decision to which you refer, it should be borne in mind that he was concerned with the effect which development would have, and where development would be suitable or unsuitable. And he said that he did not consider that Skelton should be allowed to expand so far northward. He was speaking of the area around Northfield Lane, north of Oakwood, which was a new settlement concern within the buildings themselves . Yes. Mr as I read your proof,you presume that by excluding D thirty nine and D forty from the greenbelt, that these sites will be developed. You make that assumption and it's it's essential to your case, is that is that fair? What I would say is that the power of the local planning authority to resist development on these sites would be materially reduced were the initial negative presumption against development afforded by greenbelt status removed from them. Well that is self-evidently true. Er I can't hear you. That is self-evidently true. One accepts that. The simple fact is you presume, do you not, that these sites are going to be developed? I do not make that presumption. My presumption is that there is a suggestion that development would be facilitated rather than hindered by the removal of the greenbelt protection. Well it's just as I read your paragraph fifteen point two, you say To exclude sites D thirty nine and D forty from the greenbelt presupposes the expansion of Skelton on its northerly perimeter . Nothing ambiguous about that is there? You're assuming it is going to be developed along its northerly perimeter. The movement of the boundary which you seek to create is possible only under the terms of Policy E Ten. Policy E Ten requires that the boundary be moved only if a need for expansion can be established. I hear what you say, and you know why I'm not going to debate that with you again today. You say in your proof, paragraph forty three, this is really the last point I'm going to deal with ,that the amendment to the deposit copy erm ignores several of the policies in the Southern Ryedale Local Plan. Do you have that? I have paragraph forty three. Erm C Forty One is one of the er policies which you say is ignored by the suggested amendment. I'm sorry, C Forty One? C One, sorry. C One. Do you have that in front of you Mr ? I have C , yes. C One is a development control policy, is it not? It is. Can you e please explain to me how a site's exclusion from the greenbelt in itself breaches a development control policy? Er it certainly doesn't do that. It is simply a case as I said in my summary that er er C One is a policy that is applicable , because it's a conservation area. Mm. But of course there's nothing in national policy which creates erm a prohibition upon development either in or proximate to conservation areas, is there? No, but what I have done is to give you my expert opinion that any developments within the conservation area er within the D thirty nine part of the conservation area would be likely to be destructive of the character of the ancient part of the village. I hear what you say, what you're aiming to do now, without ever having seen any form of proposal. But what about D forty? D forty is very closely associated with D thirty nine. You see, paradoxically, C One little one and C One little three in fact give a strong measure of protection to the er character of the conservation areas do they not? Yes. E N V One is another policy you say our modification offends. That's page sixty two of the deposit. Yes, I have it. Mr . Er E N V One. Again, how does exclusion of a site from the greenbelt offend E N V One? You use the word Offend. Er could you refer me to a place where I have erm er Well you say it ignores several local plan policies. So let's put it another way, how does the exclusion I I think su surely Mr the next sentence makes it quite unambiguous. The proposed change would be contrary to this policy , Mr says. Yes. My answer to that would be that er since the only permissible reason for pushing out this inset boundary would be a need for expansion, expansion involves built development, and built development would not seem to be within er the possibility of er Policy E N V One as well as within the possibility of er other policies E N V One O one moment. Mrs , I I c Mrs , I can hear your evidence as clearly as Mr 's at the moment I fear. E N V One applies to land that is perceived as forming part of the countryside. You're aware that on this side of the room Ryedale have stated in terms in their proof that they do not perceive this land as being part of the open countryside. The reference is four point two point seven . There's nothing inconsistent is there, in Ryedale's position, having made that judgement about these two pieces of land? I'm not criticizing er the erm view of the planning authorities on the grounds of lack of consistency in their interpretation of policies. I'm merely saying that their interpretation of certain policies is not coincident with my own. You refer to Policy E N V One. Mm. The reference in that policy is to development outside the existing built-up areas. Mm. I regard open land of this size as being outside the existing built-up area of Skelton. That's a matter for judgement isn't it? And the inspector will have to make that judgement in this case . Yes, I have given you my judgement on it. E N V Three is another one that er that might be offended. You say our modification is contrary to E N V Three. Yea, E N V Three as I read it is er a pure and simple development control policy. How do you say excluding this land from the greenbelt is contrary to that development control policy? Well, E N V Three is basically a damage limitation exercise, and I think that erm the qualities of this area are so great that er it would be im impossible to envisage So if I a situation relating to a new development under which there would not be damage. So if I short er short circuit the rest of my cross examination on these various policies that you say er we're in erm we're in some measure of conflict with, your answer would be in in relation to E N V Eleven and E N V Twelve which you also cite, do I put it fairly your answer would be this? Look I cannot conceive of development taking place on this land without coming into conflict with those policies. That is the essence of your position is it not? Before I answer that, I must er address myself to E N V Eleven, which relates to ponds, Right. and E N V Twelve,to habitats. Mm. I think that the summary which you gave is fair also in relation to E N V Eleven and Twelve, yes. Can I be clear please I I'm sorry Mr , can I just be clarif clarified as far as E N V Eleven is concerned, which pond this is in terms of names? It's not it's not. This pond is not listed under E N V Eleven. Er it isn't either of the er ponds No. listed in there? I think that's right isn't it Mr ? Yes. Erm I think that the exercise on ponds is not of very long standing. It's an ongoing exercise, and er we have produced er sufficient scientific evidence to show that this pond is of tremendous value. Doubtless the not prohibit development? I rely in this matter on the evidence of experts in er wildlife conservation, and that is . I don't really think there's anything to be gained by any further questioning. Thank you Mr . Thank you very much Mr . I think we'll take a break now ladies and gentlemen for fifteen minutes please. Thank you. or the Open University Yeah but the Open University ones cover all of the material and they're what I actually wrote the lectures from erm but there's six of them which is why the o the only advantage of the other one is that it's one not six and so but I mean the material is all covered text of which there are three copies of most of them in the library one on short loan and one on sort of a general loan so you Yeah. What's the other one like? The Tha that's quite good for, for the biological stuff, it doesn't really contain much sort of useful for the last three or four lectures, it doesn't contain much on sort of ocean circulation and the physics, you know but it covers the biology interactions quite well. And also it's quite useful for the Right then we, we'll leave some of the physics and stuff that we've been doing behind now and just spend one lecture looking at some chemistry which I know will be equally popular. Oh good. Most of the ninety two naturally occurring elements, that's leaving aside the, the elements that have been created artificially in particle accelerators and things, have been found in sea water and it's quite likely that those that haven't yet been recorded from sea water will be recorded as our analeti er as our analytical techniques get better. So basically you can consider sea water as being a solution containing salts of all of the naturally occurring elements. Can you just copy that down. Would I, would I do that to you? Mhm You will probably be relieved to hear that you're not expected to memorize that table and to regurgitate it in the exam. What you should be aware of though is which elements are the most common in sea water and you'll not be too surprised to learn that sodium and chlorine, as in sodium chloride, as in common salt are in fact the two most elements in sea water followed by magnesium, sulphur and calcium. Now there is inherently a problem in carrying out any chemical analysis of sea water and that is the fact that sea water contains lots of lumpy bits. These particles, this particular matter is generally given the sort of generic term seston some of those particles are mineral particles some of them are colloidal aggregates as the iron tends, iron, iron, ions tend to come together to form colloids in solution and some of them are particles of biological origin. So there are a whole range of different origins to these particles but they're all floating around in the sea water. So if you come to try and analyze sea water you first of all have to separate the er aqueous base and those things in solution from this particular material. For no real reason other than tradition samples are normally passed through a forty five mu sieve or membrane filter. Is that seston or sestron Seston T O N So sea water analysis then is carried out on the water which passes through the forty five mu filter. Typically in the open ocean situation sea water contains thirty fives parts per thousand of salt, usually expressed as that symbol, sometimes you'll see it written as parts per thousand P P T and what that means is that there are thirty five grams of salt per kilogram of water and that's usually given the symbol S and is referred to as the salinity. We can divide the components of sea water into three erm categories firstly those things which we can consider to be major constituents these are substances which are present are concentrations greater than one part per million. So if you look down your table you've got your concentrations here in parts per million and you can see that everything above fluorine would be a major constituent and everything below it would be a minor constituent. Major constituents account for ninety nine point nine percent of the material dissolved. Minor or the trace constituents then are present in concentrations less than one part per million they obviously count for less than point one percent of the total salts They are useful as chemical tracers of particular waters. If we know a water has a particular site of, of origin then we can often use minor trace constituents as a marker of that water to follow its fate and its path through the ocean, okay? So minor constituents are often useful as chemical tracers. Our third category then is substances which are, are nutrients, and this is nutrients in the widest sense. These cut across the major and minor boundaries in that some of them are in concentrations greater and some lesser one part per million. These are substances which have biological significance. The principal ones are nitrogen, which is present as nitrate, nitrite and various oxides of nitrogen phosphorous which is present as phosphate silica present as silicate which requires silica? And carbon present as carbonate which is used in skeletal material or as carbonate or C O two or H C O three minus which are all used as substrates for photosynthesis. Because these are biologically active compounds, they don't follow the simple chemical processes of the other elements in the water, their concentration at any given time or place is a function of the biological activity and history of the water. So for example in a region of high productivity you may find very low concentrations of carbonate because it's been stripped out and converted to skeletal material being used in photosynthesis. Substances whose concentrations are not affected by biological activity you'll often see described as bio-unlimited compounds so you might come across that in your reading. Right? So that's substances whose abundance is not influenced by biological activity, okay? So that's the opposite if you like of those nutrients. In addition to salts, ocean water contains dissolved gases. All of the gases present in the atmosphere are also present in surface waters. That occurs simply by physical processes, primarily gas being trapped as bubbles under the action of breaking waves. Carbon dioxide is the most soluble of the gases because as it dissolves it doesn't just go through a physical solution it goes through a chemical conversion such that carbon dioxide dissolving in water forms carbonic acid which, in water will dissociate into a hydrogen iron and a hydrogen bicarbonate iron which can further dissociate this is why I've got a nice wide blackboard and you've only got a piece of A four paper so you end up with a carbonate iron two hydrogen ions This system is a dynamic equilibrium. If you put more C O two into the system the concentrations of all of these go up, if you take carbonate out, for example for conversion to skelet skeletal material, it will pull material in this direction through the, through the s through those equations. The actual point of the equilibrium, where the balance occurs on each of these, is a product of temperature and pressure. Topically this system is extremely important. If you measure the atmospheric rise in carbon dioxide due to fossil fuel burning, you'll see that it's only about one half of that predicted if all of the coal and oil that had been burnt since the industrial revolution had gone into the atmosphere, we would probably have er an increase in C O two double what we can actually measure. The rest has entered this system and has been absorbed by the oceans. Okay? So we know that so far about fifty percent of our anthropogenic C O two has been locked away in this system in the ocean. And at the moment there is considerable er research effort being directed to try and work out just how much more carbon dioxide the ocean will continue to absorb. What does anthropogenic mean? From human sources. For example can we continue burning fossil fuel and will half of it continue to be absorbed by the ocean or is the ocean reaching saturation such that these equilibrium terms are being reached and future increases in C O two will be reflected in atmospheric build up, and it's only atmospheric C O two that contributes to the greenhouse effect. So the exact er nature of this balance and how waters between contact with the atmosphere are being mixed into the deep sea, cos remember this equilibrium can only be occurring in surface waters cos only they are in contact with the gas phase how that turnover of deep water's occurring affects just how much capacity we've got for absorbing C O two in the oceans and therefore mitigating the greenhouse effect. How can we work that out? What's that? How can you work that out? Well that's what they're trying to do at the moment by measuring rates of turnover of deep to surface waters Mhm which is actually poorly understood, we'll talk a bit more about that in the next lecture. Okay? But you can see if this lot gets converted to carbonate and then that water then gets mixed down to the deep water, it will be replaced at the surface with water which has a low carbonate concentration which will suck more C O two out of the atmosphere. So it's quite critical as to how that rate is turning It's then oxygen surface waters are saturated, in fact they're often super-saturated with oxygen. In part this is the result of photosynthesis which is pumping oxygen into solution but again primarily it's down to the physical saturation due to breaking waves and air bubbles being mixed in to the system. Below the photic zone oxygen is consumed by biological activity so immediat from immediately below the photic zone you tend to see a decrease in oxygen with depth reaching a minima somewhere between five hundred and a thousand metres depth Re reaching a what? Reaching a minimum. Below about a thousand metres oxygen concentrations are fairly static down to the a minimum between five hundred and a thousand metres depth so they're fairly static. That's in the open ocean in enclosed basins, for example the Black Sea, many fjords and sea lochs, the deep waters are not renewed by water masses moving in from other areas in the way that they are in the open ocean and there anoxia can occur in the deep waters, that is the oxygen can be completely removed by biological activity particularly in degradation processes of organic matter, bacterial respiration so anoxic conditions can occur in isolated deep basins but low oxygen concentrations are actually very rare in the open ocean. Why is that? Why is it erm well yeah er le less of a level of oxygen at erm medium depth Yeah? now surely it's far more difficult to get oxygen down deep? Yeah. It's because that's the sort of trace you get with an oxygen minimum around eight hundred metres. The photic zone is, this is percent saturation of oxygen fully saturated and what we're seeing here is oxygen being utilized by respiration. In general biological activity decr decreases with, with increase in depth so you see er respiration using up this material. But when you start getting down here you've got low biological activity Yeah but sh sh but you've also got water masses which are being moved in which are rich in oxygen. The reason they're rich in oxygen is because they were formed at the polar regions, alright? Where, because the water is very cold, it will absorb an awful lot of oxygen. We'll look, we'll actually look at the processes of deep water formation tomorrow, so you'll actually see how the waters are formed, but the reason why this is high is basically it down, get a photograph of it. Colin, get that photograph of that Porsche, blow it up and stick it at your work-station in your branch. Funny you should say that. That's what he's done is it? No, but it You've got it have you? No I had a Group Manager who actually introduced me to this, I erm, I work out with him, but, he brought a, actually what turned me on to this was the fact that erm, where he is, he's thirty six now, and erm, he's got no mortgages, he's got a, he paid eleven thousand pounds for a, a Kawasaki Z Z eleven hundred R super bike, worth that is Motorbike And he's, he took a photo Motorbike yes, he's took a photo of him sitting on the bike so you then he just had to pin it up on, on my thingy, and it'd say, you know, you'll never have this, it'll give you something to, to go for. Yes, yes, and the same yes? So that's good. So write it down, get a picture of it, it's like a car salesman, what does he do when you go into a car showroom? He sits you in it, would you like to sit inside? Because once you sit inside, you're quite right, you're driving it aren't you. Live the dream. Where do you want to be in two years' time. Again it's personal to you. It could be, that you want a house, you might currently be in rented accommodation and you want to get on the property ladder. Get your young family and yourself into your first property. Now the fact that it might be just a little two up, two down who gives a monkey's because in, next year, two or three years' time, you're walking with the removal van into this house, how will you feel? Good. The fact that one of the guys in the branch has got a great big five bedroom mansion is an elephant to you. That's five, six years down the road, maybe. Yes? But you're in there. It could be a damn good holiday. It could be that you've never taken your family abroad on holiday, so you set yourself a little objective, that in two years' time, I want to take them all, even if it's a damn package deal on a flight to Tenerife, do it, will you feel good, will the family enjoy it? You see these things are important aren't they? These are the things we're doing it for. It could be a car, like we've just said, but then again, I've never had a new car, it could be, are you with me. So it might be, just the fact that I have a new car. The Porsche might be here, but initially what I'd really like is a new car, and what I'd like to do is get up at midnight on the first of August, and drive around in my brand new car in the dark. Why do they do that? Eh, first of all they give them champagne so they all get caught drinking and driving, How do the police know? Why do they do it? I don't know, everybody driving around at nig , you, you go out first of August, at midnight. There's all these cars driving around, going beep, beep, ha, ha, look at my new car. What? Now, but it could be a new car. Let's say, let's say, let's say that Graham, who's a bigger hitter than me, and got more influence, and more influential client bank than me, his idea of a new car is a new X J S, a nice Jag, me, my dream car, I've never had a new car, is a nice Lada soft-top coupe, with G T X heated rear window, Okay. And it comes to the first of August, and Graham gets his car, his new X J S, and I get my new Lada, and we've been out at midnight doing all this, but we come to the branch in the morning, and he parks his X J S there, and I park my Lada next to it. I reckon we both feel the same don't you? Because I've achieved what I wanted, and he's achieved what he wanted. It's, it's what's inside you that matters isn't it? I'm going, well I've got it, it's important, do it, yes? First a little story. One of my objectives was to buy my wife a little car. At the time she had Ford Fiesta van, a blue van, which was alright, first time started, about four, four years old, five years old, good little road condition, but the children used to get in the back and as she went round bends it was like ten-pin bowling, dum, dum, dum, dum, went round another bit, dum, dum, dum, dum. Well A this was obviously dangerous, and B it was illegal. So you know, we couldn't do that, I mean it was great, the kids loved it. They had er, a little carpet at the back and their stickers all round it and inside it, it was a fun van if you like. So she was, she was into Volkswagen Polos, she's always liked a little run-around, she'd like a Volkswagen Polo, and . So what I did, I went round to tell the guy, John he was the sales guy at the local Vo , Audi-Volkswagen place, and I said, John, I want to buy Barbara a car. She's looking for a decent second-hand one, and I actually want to buy her a new one, and she doesn't know about it. So let's do the deal. Part-ex and all the rest of it, did the deal, negotiated, and said right what we want to do, is Saturday morning, she thinks she's going to come down and look at a decent second-hand one, and I want you to take the part, take the brand new car off and all the rest of it, and then say take that one for a test drive, which is mine, all taxed up and gassed up and all the rest of it, and we'll disappear in the moonlight. You're on he says. So Barbara, meself and a couple of the kids came along,, a couple of the kids were in on this, backing away sort of thing, and of course she went on this used car lot, and she's looking at these Volkswagens, and John was doing his bit, I believe you like Polos. He had about five or six Polos there, and of course they're all nice and shiny aren't they? Tyres are painted black. All clean inside, valeted and Barbara's going ooh, ooh, this is nice, the lights work and things like that you know. Okay. And John was great, and he showed her round and he said, well look, why don't you take one for a test drive. She said, ooh, yes, can I? He said, well take that one there. She said, ooh, it's a new one. He said, that's alright, take it. She said, alright, gets into this, and off we go down the road, the steering's all stiff, I tried it myself,, alright, all of sudden she got all excited at the indicators. They work, this little light goes on and off. She's doing all these things really thrilled to bits, and I say, well look, you like this don't you? She said, yes, I said look. John won't mind, let's keep it for the night, and take it back tomorrow morning. Well, B L didn't like this suggestion at all. You what, don't be so stupid we've got to go back and tell him, we can't do things like that. Of course we can, he won't mind, we know him, just let's go, we'll stop out for the day, and let's bring it back tomorrow. Don't be stupid. I said, look pull over, let's talk about it. So we pulled over, you see, and what we'd got, the kids at the back had a big card. They said, dad thought he'd give you this big card. And they handed to her, and it just said, Congratulations, you now own the Volkswagen Polo. I was alright that night! In fact it was demanded of me. Now there's a there's ha, ha,. There's a little story, but do you see what I mean, what working for yourself could give you? I mean, I actually , and she's still got it. A little D reg. Polo, she's still got it, she's not done twenty five thousand miles yet. It's in mint condition. Why? She loves it to death. It's been the best investment I've ever made. She won't get rid of it, because of the thought that went into it, it's great, Okay. But that's the sort of thing working for yourself can do, because. So please, think about it and do it, and get that enjoyment out of what we're offering. Longer term, well I don't know it, it could be you want your bigger house, your detached house, it could be that you want erm, status within the company. We've got er, associates and then we've got financial advisors, we've got sweet financial advisors look, and we've got What do you do for a living? Will you have Yes, I love it We've got executive financial advisors, and you name it. Which others, it's the status within the company I suppose if you want to put income against that, I mean I'm only guessing. Probably you're talking the thirty thousand plus, these are the forty thousand plus, and these may be the seventy five thousand plus a year guys. In five years' time, you sit yourself where you want to be. Now some of you in the room, believe it or not, will be happy to hit that and sit at that. Get yourself a nice little city financial advisor, a good client bank, get your five hundred clients. Good clients that you can go and see, and you can service regularly, you can go on the conventions each year, and you're quite happy. The top five percent will go for that, I hope you won't, you're not five percent, but some of you , you're all find where you want to be, isn't it, where you want to see yourself. Ideal , if you want to be down here, from there downwards, you're probably better going back doing what you did before. Your objective should be being at least there shouldn't it? Otherwise what's the point of going through the agony and collecting all these notes? Is that a fair comment is it? So if you like your original objective was at least get to there, then you can take stock. I think that's fair comment. Okay. We do that, then what we've got to do, we've got to plan the route haven't we? Now the good news is, this is where the company come in. Yes? Because you're sitting down with your partners and we'll give actually literature which your managers will give you. Which you, you'll go away with your partners and you'll discuss this, and you'll discuss what you want out of life. Inevitably, inevitably the pound sign will pop up won't it? The old pound sign. X amount is going to be needed to help me achieve my objectives. I'm sorry to say this, but the people that say money isn't everything, are the ones who've got it, aren't they? Yes The ones who haven't got it and say money isn't everything,Well they're on a different planet really, if you think about it. Of course it's everything, if you can't afford to feed your wife and children and look after the house. It's important. When you've got none, it, it's sad, but it's going to be everything. You know, so let's look at money in a sensible way, money is a means to an end for us to achieve our objectives and the style of, the standard of living that we want to spend our life and our partners and our families and all the rest of its lives together. It's the quality of life that we're going to have on this planet, it's going to be determined by that. As long as we've got that and peace of mind we can perhaps do things outside of what money can bring you. But you've got to have that peace of mind to be able to do that. Yes? Is that fair comment? You can always say if you disagree, it's just a general comment. So eventually you're going to have to sit down with us and tell us how much you want. Well, this is where we as a company will help you, to help you plan that route and monitor that route. So that on a monthly basis we will tell you if you're on target, checking your watch, you're below target, you're above target. But we can constantly monitor you. Would you like us to do that for you free of charge? or would you prefer to pay one thousand five hundred a year to a management consultant? Free Settle for free would you. Would you like that? Well you're not going to get it, you'll have to do it yourselves. Alright? You're going to have to put some input in if you want it for free, that's all I'm going to say. Is that a deal? A deal Because it would co , cost you a minimum of one thousand five hundred pounds a year to pay a management and business consultancy firm, to do this, what we're going to do for you absolutely free. We'll provide all your statistics, all your activity data, all your ratios and everything on how your business is running every month, absolutely free of charge. We'll send a copy to your manager, and a copy will come to you, so that you and your manager can sit down every month and discuss your next month's business plan. So you can actually say I need help, and he can actually say I'll give you this help, I want you to be doing this while you're doing this, I'm doing that, and we'll do that on a regular monthly basis. Initially you'll be doing it probably on a weekly basis, you'll be doing that. Yes? Would you like us to do that? How many people in the room have been introduced to er, Managing your Practice, before you came on the induction course? This thing? Business Planning? Yes Yes, Okay, you have, one. Right that's just determined to the level at which I can go at this stage then. Don't worry if you've not been told, it's very new, and the managers actually over this week and last week have been before the Group Managers effectively having the last bits of training done and workshops before we really launch it to the field. The people who've been going through the induction courses though for the last six months or so, they're probably up, more able to speak to it, and you're going to be better off actually than the, the old boys if you like and girls, because it's going to be old dogs, new tricks, but as you won't know any different and you do this, then you'll have an advantage over them. So much so in fact that they'll be looking to you to help them actually. This is it, Planning your Practice, this is what the subject's about. And, have you had , have you had a go at this yet? I've done my own, my own on this. So you've started looking at it, and it's got mapped out pretty much what we're saying here isn't it. Yes, he's left the business side to people. Yes, well all I'm going to do is introduce it to you, and when you actually get back he'll know more about it probably. We're actually get , sending him some software out on the computer so he can start playing and start understanding what the computer does. Yes, yes. So what that booklet does, is do the bit that we've just been talking about. And this is the bit where I said you need to sit with your partner and all, and really think about what your objectives and write them down. Then, you get that booklet and then you come and sit with your managers and you discuss it. And he'll tell if it's an elephant or not, he will won't he. He'll say, well I can understand that, but let's. But what's good now, is actually you can go onto a computer, and the computer will all say, also say, whoa, that's a bit unrealistic, that doesn't marry with that, that doesn't match that, no, alter your plan accordingly. We will do all this for you, and every month produces a report. But we've got to ask you to do something. If you go into that weekly han , that session hand-up booklet, that one yes, if you just hold it up Alistair, so everybody can see it, I know you may have put it away sorry, I think it's good practice isn't it? Yes, the back page is this thing here of that blue hand-out booklet, right, if you can just, if you can see one or somebody else's, instead of rummaging through that'll be fine. Is it in here? Yes, sorry it's in the back page of that. Just, that's it. Are you sure? All got it? This is your bit. This is your bit. From next Thursday night, when you do your telephone session, you must go live on this form that you'll be filling in the names that you are going to contact, right? And what actually happens is, there's a description of it in there, and I'm going to give you some more literature for you to peruse and get used to it, and you'll actually going to be working very closely with your management on this, right, is that you will record all your activity every week. How many approaches you've made, how many first interviews you've made, how many referrals you've got, yes? How many closing interviews you have, how many actual sales, because you might have a closing interview and no sale. Right, all the best. It tells you how many sales were agreed. What the actual, how many cases were written and what the estimated C C S A is, commission credit sum assured, I promise you, you will get to know that very quickly, because that's the basis on which you get paid. So just mentioning that at the moment causes confusion, you don't know what it is. It's called commission credit sum assurance, and the basis on which you get paid. You need to have a thorough understanding of that from your management on how your going to get paid, and what your financing levels are, Okay? Any policy delivery visits, number of referrals, total daily approaches at the top, and then what actually happens is, is you complete this, and every, this branch what they do, the people that do it, every Monday morning, they all come in here and have training sessions, and then there's computers around the branch. They actually just feed this information, it takes about three minutes on average to input the data off this into the computer, and it goes straight into the mainframe computer. You'll have your own password and everything. So it's all confidential it's covered by the Data Protection Act if you're worried about anything like that. And it goes into the computer. And we say takeover from there. But why do we need to do this? Well let's have a look at it from a simplistic point of view, Okay. I need to earn X amount, and I'm working in a town where I don't know anybody. I've been working abroad for the last twenty years, I've just come back to the U K and my family's all died, and I don't know anybody, and I'm going to start off working here. I don't know anybody. So the only way I'm going to start my business is, cold. Just as an example, because we don't like talking about cold, but just to give you a very simplistic example of how it can work. Your manager might say, well to earn X amount from the branch statistics and company statistics you actually need to, but you'll actually get this information off the computer, so I'm a for telling you that. It says, it might say you need to make erm, fifty calls. Pick up that phone and make fifty calls. So you, off you go and you make your fifty calls, and you make four contacts. But immediately monitoring is coming into play here, if I was your manager, but the computer will do this by the way, but your manager will spot that and say, have you made those fifty calls. You'll say, yes. Who are you ringing? Well publicans actually, because I used to be a publican, and I thought it would be a good idea if I, it's a good idea to ring people you've got empathy with. What time are you ringing? Oh lunchtime? No, No. Because what are publicans doing? Their staff are laid off and they're pulling the pints at lunchtime aren't they? So no, ring them, in fact ask one of your publican mates, you were one yourself, when was the best time you would have been contacted. Most probably about ten, ten thirty in the morning when I was you know, stocking up and things. Okay, so he rings at ten o'clock, ten thirty in the morning. He makes forty contacts. Ah, that's more like it. That's people picking up the phone. You make forty contacts, right, and you get one appointment. That tells me, what are you actually saying? Give us an example, make me appointment. Hello, is that Alan, is it Okay? Well that's not bad. Do it again, is that, yes, yes,, no me accountant deals with that. No, we need a little training session to brush up on handling the queries and objections that you may get, it's like we did yesterday afternoon. So what each branch has got is a little training room isn't it? Or it could be part of the training sessions, let's have what we were doing yesterday, skill drills, but you've got to practice it and practice it, until eventually from those forty contacts using a ratio of ten to one, we get four appointments. We go off on the appoint and we make no sales. Well what are you doing? What's your ice break like? Show me. What ice break? I'm not creating a report, Okay Are you painting the pictures when you're asking the questions?if you could, fine, good empathy, you doing a good fact find, right let's do a presentation shall we, let's see erm, ooh, you don't know how to ask for the order do you? You're not asking for the order, let's do some training on that. The monitoring process, until eventually I work out that I get my two sales. From two sales, if you do that, will earn you that guaranteed. So it works. But this is all going to be do, done far more sophisticated than that, so it's going to produce for you each month, one of these things. Okay? And this is a ph , like a photocopy, so what you'll have is a nice printed version with Abbey Life blue, purely for you to get a feel of if you like,, and in this, we're very quickly going to go through on the first sheet it will have activity and production and it will have your data there. Your key performance indicators, there's several indicators, if you like, indicating that your persistency is maybe going down, indicating that your product knowledge, you need a re-enlightened on certain products, if you like it's warning shots across the bow, hey or it's drawing your att , your attention to a certain area, yah? You may have a, a compliance issue outstanding, or whatever, or there's been a complaint against you, it will show up in here, it's very rare, but it's indicating that there's something that needs to be looked at. It's going to be . Personal development, your commission income, your review business development plans, it's a pity it's not available, it's coming in yet, the client bank and quality of business. The idea of the front page is a summary of the whole lot, yes, where you sit down with your manager on your one to one meeting, he's got a copy, you've got to meet, and you discuss these points. And if there's any areas or warnings of concern which you feel that you've both got, because he might think, he's got any, he's concerned about an area, but you don't see it as a concern, and you allay his fears. What you're concerned about is something totally different. You understand what I mean, that's management meetings. But what that means, is you can actually write an action plan, where you agree to do something, he agrees to do something, or she agrees to do something, and you work out your action plans. The data and information behind all those subjects is contained within. Which probably, I think because none of you have been introduced to it, would be too heavy to go through to any great extent. But actually, just look, turning the page, it tells you activity and production, right, how many days worked this year, forty days, how many weeks, eight days, and all the rest, and then if you see we can get this is based on your data, that you're feeding into the computer every week, and there's absolutely no purpose in putting false data in. In fact of course we put failsafe systems in because we've got so many statistics and everything, because if you start putting false data in, it will be identified. The computer will say, this ain't right, and come out and tell us. So don't lie, if you're having a bad month, or you're having a bad week or you haven't had any sales, put it in the computer, because that's going to be identified, it comes up on here, so that your manager can help you. He can't if you put in, if he thinks everything's rosy here, he can't help you, but in fact you're going down the swanee, you're only fooling yourselves. But it'll tell you how many first appointments you've had, how many fact finds you did, how many subsequent presentations, how many, how many sales you did in September ninety three, week, all the rest of it, and right at the bottom here it's got the ratios, right, how many approaches to sales agreed. You had to make twenty seven approaches to make one sale. Well if I was his manager, what would I be working on? His approaching techniques. His straighter, that's far too many, let's have a look at what you're saying on the phone, let's really, really home in on that, and practice, and practice, and practice. we're beginning to see sales technique you need to, you look at. It's not sales technique until he actually gets the appointment, he can't present anything. Sorry,appr , approaches, He's had twenty seven. That's for the month, mind. Yes, yes. Okay. Are you with me? Now on the next page, it's all about C C S A, how much you've actually earned, you're not interested in that. Sh, sh,and it continues to go through this, and I say, you can see, it's very, very comprehensive, and very, very detailed. I assure you all the information in there will become second nature to you. It does, it might not seem it at this moment in time, but eventually you will understand everything that's in there, and what it means to you, yes? Now we're going to provide this for you absolutely free. As a monitoring system, yes? On the computers very sure, this is already in the system this, and already being used, we are just, it won't be of any benefit unti , until you actually start working on true data. But in the meantime we will work on company averages for you, until you've started building six months' data. From six, so if you give us data every week for the next six months, and as I say, in six months' time, we'll then be working on actuals, but until that time, we'll work on company averages for you, so that you've got a plan to work to. But with this individual plan, does it say somewhere, erm, go about commission status, somewhere near the back, Commission earnings, current balance, for commission potentially, it's got in July of ninety three he earned seventeen thousand three hundred and seventeen pounds in the bucket potential commission. That doesn't mean he's going to draw it, he's actually drawing on average this guy around a thousand, hundred pounds, one thousand two hundred pounds he's been thousand pounds, but he's actually drawing one thousand two. Why's he doing that? To build up his To build up his pot, because he might have a bad month, or he might want to go on holiday. If you go on holiday for a month, you want another pay cheque going in at the end of the month. If you haven't done any business, you've no income, so he's left it in the pot, so he can draw another one thousand two hundred. You see how it's working? Yes, of course. If it's left in the pot, is there any interest on it? Erm. No, because it's not actually yours, it's just an advance? It's, it's, it's an advance, but no, it's not it's, honestly I can't oh, I mean, this is all to do with interest plans , you can't answer the question, I'm sorry, sorry. Happy with that, are you happy with that, Okay? That's that, there's a guide to managerial practice, I'm going to give you, you'll be saying Oh, my God, all this information. I assure you, just hang on to it, start glancing through it, start getting familiar with it. The important thing I want you to have is, is start on that activity data sheet, get in your discipline of writing everything you do on that sheet and inputting it every week, so that you're getting actual data as soon as possible. It will be to your advantage. Okay? I think that's a good time for us to have a coffee break, yes? I'm trying to go as fast as I can. You have actually got one? Yes, it's an executive briefcase isn't it. It's an It's just It's only a hole in it, he said oh, no it's I didn't make a bad job. Yes, it looks like it. It's alright, Bob, we'll tidy up later. Urgh, how's your breakfast sitting. Very nicely thank you. see if I can get this in focus for you. Can everyone see that? Okay? First of all, who are we? We are the largest independent manufacturer of high speed diesel engines. And the horsepower range we work from is from seventy six, to two thousand horsepower. And that is in fact from four cylinder to twenty four cylinder engines. Er you'll see further on in the presentation, the product we produce at , which is the ten litre and the fourteen litre engine. And this actually goes down to about a hundred and eighty horsepower in some applications. And in fact we're now approaching the five hundred horsepower in the fourteen litre. This is Incorporated Internationally. Sales in nineteen ninety one was three point four billion dollars, and in fact the figures for nineteen ninety two are just published in May of this year, is four point seven billion dollars. We produce annually, two hundred and eight thousand engines, in fact that's now approaching two hundred and fifty thousand engines. We employ twenty three thousand people worldwide. Our annual research and development exceeds two hundred million dollars. in the U K consists of Engine Company Limited, and there are three manufacturing sites that manufacture diesel engines. We've got which I'll go on to expand in a minute about. We've got another plant at Darlington that produces a smaller series of engines. Erm eighty to a hundred and forty horsepower. And a plant at Daventry down in the Midlands that does the big ones, two thousand horsepower. A few years ago we bought a company called who manufacture all the filters that we use. Erm oil filters, air filters etcetera. We actually bought them over about seven or eight years ago. We now own them. located at , actually reconditions engines which are ten or fifteen years old. There's also a market there for people who can't afford to buy new product, and obviously still the engine's still got life in it. So with reconditioning, and new pistons and new liners etcetera, you get another ten years out of the engine. So you've probably seen them if you've ever been up past . On the motorway heading for . They're on the right hand side. , again located in the Midlands down at Wellingborough. Are actually our distributer. Who go out in the field and do field service support for our customers. were a separate independent company up till about three years ago, who produced nothing but turbochargers. Erm turbocharging in diesel engines really came on about ten years ago. It's fairly new. Er although most people think it's been there for a long time, it hasn't. Turbocharging really only took off about ten years ago. This was a private company set up to produce turbochargers, which again, because we were one of their biggest customers, we eventually became partners and then bought them over. is a n a new company to us. Er I'll go on to explain in the product range one of their new products we're introducing this year. Is an electronic engine. And this company U K has developed the new control systems for it. Er and Holdings I'm sorry I know very little about. I know they remanufacture components for us, but I know very little about them. As far the United Kingdom's concerned, nineteen ninety one almost five hundred million pound sterling turnover. Producing thirty seven thousand engines. With almost five thousand employees. And as at the end of nineteen ninety one, we have almost two hundred million investment in the U K. The first plant that opened outside the main plant in Columbus, was at . And it opened in nineteen fifty six. Er there's various reasons why it was located at . One of the main ones being which we know now as . But er were one of our customers, buying engines from our mother company in the States. Er the company was also at that time, looking to expand anyway into Europe. Erm and I think Margaret had quite a lot to do with it being located at as well. So for various reasons, we actually found ourselves at . Nineteen fifty six. The plant itself erm now worth thirty million pounds. There was a seventeen million pound extension built in nineteen Started in nineteen eighty one, finished nineteen eighty five. We currently employ just over six hundred people. Although when I joined the company fifteen years ago, we had only fifteen hundred people. Er six hundred and fifty thousand square feet. Almost, and as I say we do fourteen litre and ten litre engines. The ten litre engine is actually a metric engine. Er it was introduced in nineteen eighty three. Brand new engine, introduced in nineteen eighty three, and we decided at that time to go metric. Er a hundred and eighty to now we've gone up to about three seventy horsepower with turbocharger. And in some cases we have a double char tur turbocharger. There's a photograph of the product. Erm this here's the turbocharger arrangement. The fourteen litre engine is an old imperial engine. And when I say old, that was designed and developed in nineteen thirty five in the States. The basic engine has not changed at all. Er sure there have been some improvements in the materials that we use. And that's just material technology advancing. But the basic engine design has not changed. On both products, what we are now going to is an electronic engine. We currently have a pressure regulated fuel injection system, developed by . own patented design. What we're now going to is electronic fuel injection. It gives a much better fuel economy. And again, that's a photograph of the fourteen litre engine. Our main markets. well you can see from that, the main markets are actually the world. We are very heavily into South Korea and China at the moment. Erm about ten percent of the product goes to Africa and Australia. Again, we're getting heavily into the Middle East. And that's mostly for generator sets and pumping station equipment. Er the European Market is mostly either on or off highway. There are only really two main markets in Europe and that's either the trucks or the excavators and the diggers off highway applications. Er a typical example of an application, an E R F thirty eight tonne tractor unit. Erm that one in actual fact has a ten litre pardon me engine in it. E R F currently produce about six trucks per day, and they're all powered. So every time you pass an E R F on the motorway or it passes you, it's one of our engines from that's powering it. Er a company called in Finland, who are the biggest truck manufacturer in Finland. Er and it's mostly fairly heavy lorries that they produce for as you can see, forestry work. Erm I think that's their principal industry in Finland is the forest. Again we are the the sole supplier to them. These are various other applications. You'll recognize this one here. This is the local Sprinter class rail car er diesel rail car which runs on our local railway network. They are all powered by , throughout the U K. Er something like four hundred and seventy five of these units running, all powered. These are standby generator sets. For all sorts of applications. Hospitals, pumping stations whatever. Off highway applications in terms of diggers, erm and power equipment. And we do some marine not a lot of marine erm For some strange reason, our design of engine does not lend itself too well to marine applications. Er we there's a lot of cast iron and steel in our engine and marine engines don't like that, they prefer brass. . Er typical example of our technical investment,Nineteen ninety one, we were round about a hundred and fifty million. This year, the plans for nineteen ninety three, ninety four are two hundred and fifty million. Reinvestment in er in new equipment and research and engineering development. An aerial view of the plant. When we came here in nineteen fifty six, this was the original building. And in fact it was an old woollen mill called the . From nineteen eighty one to eighty seven, we expanded into this. Erm it's a simple flow system, raw material comes in at one end and flows through the plant, through the machining areas, through the assembly, and the new product, the finished product comes out the end. The other building you see in the top left here is the Hilton. That's the present . Er a typical view down the assembly track or the beginning of the assembly track. You can see the engine block. Very little built on to it at that stage. And the main things that we point out there are we have a nice natural flow system. We have material feeding in from each particular station at the side. operator doesn't have a lot of movement, minimum movement. Erm there are twelve stations in that particular piece of assembly track. The track is continuously moving, and it pulses every ten point six minutes. So every ten point six minutes, another engine comes off the end. Er a view of part of the machine shop. Just showing the general layout and what we are trying to do in terms of housekeeping and cleanliness. Machine shops and engineering works tend to be regarded as very dirty filthy places. And I'm afraid the nineteen nineties, that's not the attitude we want to adopt. Er we pride ourselves on our housekeeping, it's a selling factor for us, and we have customers come round and look at the plant and they always commend us quite highly on our housekeeping. Again another general view of a machine shop. You can just imagine, this place is cutting cast iron and metal all day, every day. So it looks quite good. Er the finishing end of the assembly track, and you can see the engine is almost in a completed state. Sixteen stations on this piece of piece of track. Again pulsing at ten point six minutes. So again, a completed engine every ten minutes. And just a wee Some of the achievements we've had in the last ten years. Eight occasions, we've won the Queen's award to industry. So we can't be doing too badly. Any questions gentlemen or Yes. Yo you mentioned the fact that you had increased your capacity, but decreased your your er employee Yes. Erm in so that it's our fault really that we can't give work to our our er people. Is there no way you can adopt a a a more way to to utilize the men rather than. There are There are various ways to that. Obviously it's quite an emotive subject when as you say you're reducing putting people out the door. Putting people out of work. The counter argument to that is, if you don't become more efficient, then you will lose the business anyway. And your competitor will take over. And all your people are out the door. So it's a cleft stick. And it's difficult, very difficult to strike the balance. Erm, what we have tried to do at , there are You've probably seen or heard in the last five or six years, the influence of Japanese technology. And you can't transpose totally Japanese technology into the Western hemisphere, but they have some good ideas. Er and and you have to pick the ideas that you think can apply to to your application. And we've adopted two or three of these. One is what they call,cising or continuous improvement. And as you continuously improve an area, the people that that frees up, the additional labour, go on to do additional improvement work. So you can still support those people, and still get the benefit. So you're still reducing the cost of the product all the time, er and you can still retain the people. Now there's obviously a saturation level. Where you have more people that what you have improvement work for them to do. Erm how far down the road that is, we don't know. But we've been honest with our people, we have not paid anyone off, in the fifteen years I've been at , that didn't want to go. It's all been voluntary redundancy or voluntary termination. But yes it's a very very difficult situation. It's survival on the one hand against moral issues on the other hand. Difficult. manufacturing cars you know, and it's all these robots they're doing all the work. Could the robots er take over er diesel engineering? Is it not a possibility? Well there are some other slides I could have got which We have a conrod line which manufactures the conrod, right? And you can imagine the conrod in your car is about this size. Four of them in your One in each cylinder, goes up and down. The one in the diesel engines like this, you can hardly lift it. We have a conrod line that manufactures them . And in fact we manufacture conrods for other plants in the corporation. Er the cost is fourteen million pounds for that machining unit for conrods. And it's six cells of about five or six machines in each cell. And they are fed by a robot. Traditionally we had something like eight five, eighty seven people working in conrod manufacture, we now have fourteen operators, supported by six technicians. And the robots are doing that. So yes, we took on board robotic technology if you like, to reduce costs. In terms of engine assembly, no. Er that will always be done by hand. There are alw there are always applications that you cannot robotize. Erm and we pride ourselves on the skill and the quality that we build into the engine and you can't do that with robots. Robots'll do whatever you ask them all the time, but they don't think. Erm and because of the way of things, you don't always get the components the same way every day. You always get one reject . So the robot would pick that and use it. Whereas the man will pick it and discard it. So there are applications you can use them and some you can't. Your continuous improvement in in the factory a lot over the years. What is your relationship with the unions in the in the plant? Erm initially,initially very bad, I have to say that. As I say, it's a very emotive subject. But if you are honest and up front with them, and tell them exactly what you're doing and why you're trying to do it, eventually over time, you get them And we started this in nineteen eighty five, eighty six. And I would say, Now we are starting to see the fruits of that. And it's taken that length of time to break down the seventy or eighty year barriers that are in existence between workers and management. Erm and i think there will always be, for some time yet, a wee bit of distrust there, on both sides. Erm quite a lot you just have to be honest with people and tell I mean we've got It's unfortunate we can threaten people if you like, it's the wrong word to use. But you say to them, You know, look at , erm one week they announced, I can't remember the figures, twenty three million investment. Four months later they closed it just like that. again, they closed and then reopened. So there're examples in the area where if we don't pull our socks up and and actually start working, then it could happen to us as well. But no, it was very difficult at first. It's still difficult at times, erm there is nothing forced into them, it's all through mutual discussion. Erm there had been one or two occasions where we have to be the management if you like, and say, No I'm sorry, that is what we are doing. Erm we've had enough discussion, we now need to go that way. But those occasions are very few and far between now. , where does the material come from for ? For the the engines themselves? The componentry ? Erm we produce about thirty percent in house. And that's from U K sources of raw material. Like castings. We do a lot of machining of castings. Er of the other seventy percent, er about twenty five percent of that will be from bought in finished material, from companies in the U K. Pardon me, one or two in Scotland but not too many unfortunately. The remaining forty five, fifty percent, is actually bought in from America. Remember we have got seven manufacturing site in the States that manufacture the same product for the American market. They therefore have bigger buying power, than one company in Scotland. So they can buy as seven companies at a much cheaper rate and ship it across to us, and the sea freight is still doesn't add to the cost that much. Er so unfortunately, fifty percent of material comes in from the States. How many of your What percentage of your staff on the shop floor are tradesmen? Erm very few. We have most of our maintenance staff are time served fitters or electricians. In the actual machine shop and the assembly operators themselves. They are I would say, ninety percent semi- skilled. we have trained them in er in fact in the operations they're doing. You have to remember that was on old coal mining area. And again, I think one of the main reasons round about nineteen fifty six, that went there, was the pits were closing, and there was obviously erm government attractions to pull companies in. Much more then than there is now. So we have a lot of ex-miners. Erm but I would say it's mostly maintenance trades. We have gone slightly the other way with obviously robotics and the electronic age and this sort of thing. A lot of our machine tools are C N C, so we need to employ the skills there. Erm but these are mostly technician people. I would say in the majority, it's semi-skilled. And a supplementary question going on from that. Do you employ apprentices? Yes we do. Erm unfortunately not so many. We've taken apprentices every year since I've been there. Erm when i started fifteen years ago, it was an intake of about twenty five er lads at a time, we're now down to about unfortunately eight or nine craft apprentices. And I think about three technical apprentices. We have erm one female apprentice who's time was just out there last year. She's a maintenance technician, and she actually won the Scottish whatever it is, Apprentice Award. So we're quite proud of her, and she gets on great with the guys. And she's the only female on the floor. We have girls in the offices and women in the offices obviously, but she's the only tradesperson if you like, on the floor. But yeah, we're still taking them on but not in so many numbers. Alec, erm do you have er company comparisons. You've got seven or more plants in the States elsewhere er you know on criteria such as erm quality and productivity, cost and so on. If so, how do make out in the company league table? Right. We have, we started again, nineteen eighty nine, we decided taking on board some of the Japanese ideas which we felt we could use. And discarded the rest which we felt did not transpose. We erm developed what we call C P S. Which is the commons production system. To functional excellence. And there are ten measures within that production system. Erm and these measures are criteria for every plant worldwide. Now we have plants in India, Brazil erm we now have one in China, we were about to open one in Russia but it burned down. Part of the deal, I don't know if you tread about it in the paper. Six hundred and thirty million we lost. Erm and it's the same criteria worldwide. We have corporate headquarters obviously dictate policy. And you have to adjust that policy at local level. Because some of the ideas and and and beliefs in America for example, don't hold good up in . And vice versa. But the basic top level objective policy is set plan you know, worldwide for each plant. And against that, these ten measures are measured. erm in fact housekeeping in one of them would you believe. Housekeeping is one of the measures. Erm out of the ten, I would say, we have got about seven above target, and three below target. And the ones that are below target funnily enough, are productivity, which is still measured, and I don't agree with that. Productivity's an old fashioned measure. What you could actually measure is delivery to your customer. But we still measure productivity. Erm and we are slightly below target on that. We are above target in quality. We are above target in housekeeping. So in a sort of worldwide league table if you like, we're well above average. And you're right because these are the things that when when your vice president and you president come every year, as they do, on their annual visit, and they go to Gleneagles for their game of golf first. Erm they are in the plant I don't know, maybe four hours or six hours. Two or three of those hours are spent reviewing the financial results. Obviously we still need to make money. That's why we're in business. The other two or three hours are on the floor. And it's that three hours that's the impression that they take away with them. That's the only chance you get in that one whole year, to impress these people. So when they're sitting in their corporate offices, making decisions about, Well where will we send the work. Well last time I was at it was dirty. Guys were hanging about, standing all over the place, not their backside. That's the impression they have of . And this is the m the message you have to get across to the people. And we are we are getting there. We're getting there. And one of the things we did this year for example. Which I find very difficult, is we actually went no smoking on the first of January. Erm and that was after we put out a referendum around the plant and we got a seventy eight response saying, No smoking. So there's a mass exodus to the car park now at lunchtime. Anything else? In the you mentioned smoking. What about the standards of lavatories and that? I'm not sure I understand your question . Er are the toilets kept up to a high standard? Well I'll let my son answer that, he's actually been in the plant a couple of times and What's your impression of the place? Er they're alright. Yes it's fine. I mean it's In actual fact the the number of people I've had in and One thing I should say, if you feel you would like a visit one evening, to the plant, then I'm more than welcome to try and organize something for you. But the number of people that I've had in erm both customers and visitors like yourselves, that have been so impressed by the standards of housekeeping and cleanliness and tidiness, for an engineering facility. Erm it really is quite outstanding. And we are not the best. There are people better. what about future development. Everything seems to be on a big scale, there's no question about scaling down? Well in fact, what happened erm last year is we reduced the size of our machine shop. We lost twenty three thousand square feet last year. And this was mostly because of old machine tools being tossed away. Erm for example we have a flexible machining system of six machines that replaced forty two. So that obviously reduces your floor space. And what we are trying to do is attract other business into that floor space. Erm we started a contract a year and a half ago with M O D to produce a power pack for a fighting vehicle. Called the A S ninety fighting vehicle, built by ship building down at Barrow. We're doing a hundred and seventy nine of these for the British Army. A big big contract worth a lot of money. Erm there's a repair programme for South African Railways, to repair erm all their tractors, big things. Er again we're hoping to attract that in maybe next year. So no, we don't want to scale down. We want to increase, we want er we want to be at for as long as we can. Provide employment for as long as we can. For as many as we can. What about scaling down the engine size? What about getting into the car market No. No it's we're not we're not in there's there are people who are more established at that Bill, better at it and longer at it than we are. We are high speed diesel manufacturers in the big range. In the range that you saw. Erm we we there's a company called . erm American company who have a big holding in Germany, who produce combine harvesters and this type of stuff, agricultural equipment. We got into a partnership with them to develop a small engine a couple of years ago, for their application. It was down round about the forty two, forty five horsepower mark. But no, we just we couldn't get the cost right. We just couldn't compete at that You need to produce thousands and thousands of these things, to get the economies of scale. And er we just couldn't do it. And we d actually from that. Okay, well. er and in any, in any event there are a number of things I tend to miss altogether if I want to er keep to timetable which I and I, I'm sure you're, all the, the audience or group or whatever you like to call it that will welcome an extension of the talk. I usually mention briefly on going into business on your own account, working for yourself, but I'll develop that later that that's one of the things I can dr drop out altogether if w depending on the type of group I'm with. So okay, well we'll make a start and then we've got but my first remarks were a little bit, bit so there we are. I did mention that er I'm a retired tax inspector and I'm very long retired, I've been retired for thirteen years, thoroughly enjoying it, hope you too but your first questions w must be what the devil am I doing thirteen years retired tax inspector talking to you on a technical subject, why on earth can't you get the real thing? The short answer was that when I was working as inspector of taxes I used to give these talks, I was required to give talks . And the revenue got mean and decided it couldn't afford the time of serving officers and it left pre-retirement council and other bodies with a gap to fill er the only other people who are er professional if you like, who could fill it, would be accountants and they weren't available. So they had to pull pa back people like me from retirement. Which is fair enough because one of the things I mentioned about the benefits of er or the things we should try to achieve in retirement or secure in retirement, is that if you've had a challenge in life whilst you're working then for goodness sake don't drop it when you retire. There is still the need for a challenge in life and a sense of responsibility or whatever you like to call it. And I find this challenging, these talks, which is why I wasn't at all sorry to be asked to do so and why I continue to do them and I enjoy giving the, I enjoy meeting people, I meet an awful lot of, of nice people. And I learn quite a lot myself I've had my hair done. Yeah it looks nice. So I see. Yeah, she only charged me two fifty today. It's nice. Mind your fish darling. I know. She's already had a little bit. Yeah, I'm gonna I I'm gonna let her put her out Stuart because you gotta get any peace when you're eating. I'm just wait till I finish this few stitches then I'm ready You don't want me any other time, do you? Eh? She's been in a funny mood this morning. She's been jumping about and going all larming And I don't know why no reason. She's been hiding behind that chair and mm jumping about. It must be spring coming or something. How do you feel now, any better? Mm. A bit better. I went out for a walk yesterday. Well I went along to get my . It was shut weren't it! I didn't realise what Oh Wednesday! Course.

Well sit there then. You can annoy him. Well she is annoying. I've had it. You sit and you try and eat your tea and you can't. She nearly has it off your plate. When Bruce and Sheila were here the other night we had fish she was on the table. She was sitting on the chair with her head Oh. I mean that's not right. I don't agree with that myself. Here you are Ann. Look at this. Lovely. It it's taking taking shape. I've I've just look I've just got the neck now to do. Which I'm doing. Hope I've got it right.

Behave yourself or a smack on the bum. What time you going down to Vera's? Some time this afternoon? Yeah. Yeah. Be nice.

Somebody left some coffee, you know that man comes with the coffee Stuart? Mhm. He, they left the er they'd gone said leave it in the conservatory, then he went out and and and and er shut his conservatory so they couldn't leave it so they asked me to keep it for him. Ann, don't let her do it. She's a bugger isn't she? Ah . we we we've started. What? All the house and the, it's all all in motion. What was the letter then? I don't know. He hasn't opened it yet.

And he's applied for his job so. Has he? Ooh. New house new job. keeps saying to me new house new job new baby. Baby that's right. No, not possible. That's right. That's what happened with me Ann. Oh. When we bought Devon Road. I wasn't in there long until I was pregnant with Sheila. Mm. Yeah I forgot to do my football pools. You know I am going funny. I put the dustbin bag out on the Wednesday and it and and and it should have been Thursday and . And when he came I said what are you doing here?this is Wednesday. I'm in a right muddle. Better not look at your numbers then. No. He would have stayed and while I did it but . Right what's, what do you want? Taking your fish now. Mm? You'd think she was starving wouldn't you? Oh I know she is cos she told me you don't feed her properly. Oh lie lie! They got in touch with the solicitor for you then Stuart? They've done all that. Yeah. Have they? We just had to go up and see him and What, the solicitor? Yeah he's been to solicitor as well. Oh you've been to solicitors this morning? Who's your solicitor then? Pat . Who? Pat . Oh aye.

You're gonna have to see Stuey now cos Ann's eaten her fish and he's got . Go on cat. It was a lovely bit of fish. I never had one bone in it, have you? Where did you get it?? Yeah. Up the road here? Mm. Yeah. We don't have it very often. I suppose you appreciate it more when you Yeah. We cook it as I say I mean but I don't often go up the chip shop. Well how, how much was that? If you don't mind me asking. Your fish and chips. What, altogether? Yeah. Eh? Three quid. Well, Sheila brought some fish round here on Tuesday. Admittedly . And it was four pounds. Mm I know. The fish! I know. On its own! Well the last time I bought some then it was three pound something for me and you. Yeah. I mean I give Bruce the biggest bit you know Admittedly you get more don't you, for four pounds. Oh admittedly. But it was four pou it's three pound something a pound Ann. Yeah. That's what I paid. Cod. Just cod. I just had just over a pound Yeah,isn't that dear? of fish and it, it was three pound something. Isn't that dear? Mm. I mean admittedly you don't get that much fish in there do you? No, cos there's a lot of batter There's a lot of batter. round it. Mm. But that's what it cost, the fish itself, four pound. I know. It is expensive. Yeah. It used to be a cheap meal Ann. You see we moan about paying three pound a pound for meat but you pay it for fish. Yeah. It's no different really is it? Yeah. Yeah but I mean fish we we used to consider fish Oh it was cheap. as a cheap meal weren't it? Yeah. No wonder people don't buy it and now, you know I mean the fish sales have gone down. No wonder. meat's cheaper. Mm. I mean that was cod. What did we have last time? That wasn't nothing special. Just cod, ordinary cod. Whether we had haddock or something, didn't we? Yeah. Or plaice, was it? Well it it's not that much dearer now than the Plaice I think we had didn't we? Something like that I know Salmon's a bit salmon is Trout's the cheapest and Yeah. That's what I'm saying That that's ever so cheap, trout isn't it? You could get a nice It's only two pounds a That's right. You could get a nice pound of trout for Mm. two bits of trout for might as well get trout. Mm. Don't forget you're gonna get a lot of if you have a whole trout you've got skin and Oh yeah, but not that much. Not that much. You can eat the skin anyway. That's it. I like the skin. Mm I do. Only the head and the tail and the innards Yeah. and then the rest's all edible. Yeah. Do you want erm an apple crumble? Do you want Ann to go and whip you up an apple crumble? Not today. There's a bit of cake there. Bruce didn't have any cake. Is he alright? Yeah. Or is he a bit, still a bit Oh I don't know. Oh. I didn't ask. Try not to talk about it . Well he doesn't talk about it.

Well Everyone waited for Stuart to start and he wouldn't . That's right. He wouldn't, he wouldn't start the conversation off. said to him, say something. No, let them say something and nobody said anything at all. We, they went in the end. some tea Ann? There's some skimmed milk there. Semi-skimmed I should say.

You know last night it was funny I watched the telly. I don't know what time it was. Thanks Ann. It was about eleven o'clock, you know? Time for bed. Thought well I had this fire on so, I gets up to go through and make myself a l you know a drink before going to bed and I put my 'jamas on and dressing gown. And she was on the beanbag.

Well yeah. It's gone gone twelve o'clock. By the time we got here and started cooking something it would be rushing to get it eaten so. Yeah. Go on then. In you go. Do you think you'll be working weekend? I doubt it. Not the way things are You doubt it? at the moment. Oh. It's so quiet. Is it? Oh dear. Done half of tom half of today's work last night. Eh? We did some of today's Half of today's work last night. You haven't have you? Oh you're not gonna be laid off are you? Oh god that'd be terrible. And you've just bought a house. Never never known ever to be laid off in five years. No, I think it's just I think they plan well according er to John yesterday they planned it this way. They planned it this way? How And it was quiet and it it's quiet. The they haven't taken the orders for this week and so they can next week it will get busier. So that we're all caught up ready for the christmas rush. That's what he said. Oh I see. They didn't plan a big order book these few weeks before christmas so that everything could get caught up and we're all You're all ready. all straight ready for er Yeah I see. extra orders the week before christmas. Yeah I see. Cos I said to him I've never known it as slack as this in, in the few weeks before christmas. He said oh this year it was planned like that. They've done this deliberately so that you can Yeah. Yeah. Well that's alright then. Cos other years we've been two days behind with orders you know and Have you? rushing about and everybody working all hours god sends and Yeah, yeah. and he said it was planned for this lull beforehand. Oh well, that's alright then. See what more money they want out of him he'll scream. Or cry. Is he, is he getting I don't know. upset already? You'll have to get used to signing your n n name on ch Oh shut up. That's an interesting conversation. Isn't it? Mouthful of biscuit. You're having biscuits is he? How about Ann? You haven't offered her one. He knows I wouldn't have one. There you ares, that's it. I'm all ready just to do a few more look Ann. Just a, just a dear Mr thank you very much for That's the wool I've got left. That's all. Good heavens. And you said you didn't have, you had loads of wool left . Surprising isn't it? That, that and then that bit there. That's all the wool I've got. That's only just gonna do it isn't it? Yeah. That's what I thought, I thought oh my god. Oh, is there gonna be enough ? And I thought yeah. just about, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. I mean I, oh By the time you Oh yeah I've had do the neck and cast off. Yeah. There's only just gonna be enough. Yeah. Just to say we've er So that's worked out very well. You you didn't, you bought one less didn't you? Mm. What's that ? Oh you're not telling us. Not telling us. I told you! I read it to you. You didn't! He's a cheeky It said what? Give it to Ann. It's private so You let Ann read it. It's just bumph basically. Just saying you have put Put in an offer for this house. You've agreed to buy this place. Your this is something something something Yeah well you keep that Ann. We hope Keep all these bits of paper because you're really, I mean We hope it goes satisfactorily You want, you want a file. Have you got one of these file things? No, we could do with one to keep everything together cos contracts and that you have Do you want one? keep safe and solicitor's letters and that. Do you want one? There might be one in the desk or out in the, in the there used to be . Let us see now if there's something you could keep them in. You don't want a ring-pull, ring one, you know. You where are you then? Are you there, you being good boys? So it's now sold subject to contract? That's what it'll have on it. Nobody else can have a look at it now. No, that's what they put on them now. Nobody else can have a look. Can't they? I thought there was still time to have a look at it just in case it falls through. I don't think that, they can't put a better offer in can they? When it's sold subject to contract. Well I dunno, but I mean They can't gazump you at the last minute cos it makes But I mean if that goes if that goes through if that falls through somebody might be interested and and somebody might erm I dunno. Like you say, probably they put subject to contract on and Here you are I got it Ann. Have that. I've I've gotta find that's usually what they write on them isn't it? Sold subject to contract don't they? Here you are It erm you can have that. I'll, I'll probably find Yeah. Well that will keep everything together. you a better one but Sunday. No that's fine. Mm cos you've got to keep all the bits and pieces together. Yes you do. You do It just says thank you for your you have applied to par apply for this house subject to contract and that's it. You're subject to contract now then? Yeah. Like I say that's what they will put on the thing isn't it? Sold subject to contract. Contract yeah. It's a matter of, what what are you waiting for now? To see if you've got the mortgage? No. You've got it? You've got the mortgage? As far as I know. You have. You don't need a Well he said a telephone call will just will tell him that won't he? Oh. If you come in Monday the tel You don't, you don't a telephone call will tell you whether you've the papers won't be drawn up but they will be able to tell him on through the phone whether it's okay. You don't need to have a medical? No. Doubt it. I think , he had to give his doctors how long and what illnesses Yeah but I just wondered he might need a medical. Dunno. Doubt it. You doubt it? Don't see any reason why I should not that they've had nothing wrong He's had no illnesses or I've had nothing wrong with me. I don't suffer from anything. I know, I know but that's not the point. You know, they you the you might have to get in touch with. Well we give his name didn't we? I mean really anybody can say anything if you don't, if they don't look into it. No that's I could say I've never had an illness in me life and whatever can't I? Anybody could s That's right. Yes I think they'd have to do, they will do. Cos otherwise you could say anything couldn't you? Yeah, course you can. Course you can. You know I mean anybody could say anything. I could say no I've never had an illness. I mean it wouldn't be the truth but you, if they didn't look into it you could say it couldn't you? That's right. And no doubt some people who would try that kind of thing isn't there? Oh yeah. Yeah. If they think it spoils their chances. Although does your, does your health Yeah because this is a pension mortgage you see. Yes. Yeah. You might have to have a medical. But you don't think For the pension purpose, for the pension plan a medical is not needed. That is, doesn't matter. Oh well. Oh. The only thing that I might need a medical for is my thirty thousand pound life insurance. Oh. Well, that's what I mean. I mean it's the same kind of thing isn't it? That's the, I won't need, if if I just did the pension You can bump him off now you know, from the fifth of January cos you get thirty thousand quid if you bump him off. Do we? You do. Oh well I won't, if y You're his beneficiary. If you put the glass, yeah I'll So once he's paid the first payment by the fifth of January . If you, if you do the bumping off Ann if you do the bumping off Ha we'll share it? Yeah. We'll go fifty fifty, how about that? Yeah. Alright. You're you're you're the beneficiary of his er hi hi his f thirty thousand pound. Yeah, alright. Fair enough. You do the bumping off and I'll We'll go shares we'll have a I'll have to see if I can get some banana skins put on the stairs. Bahamas. How about the Baha what do you fancy the best, You you wouldn't mother! No mother! Bahamas or or Australia, we could go to Australia. Yeah, we could go via Bahamas couldn't we? Mother. Yeah.

Shut up. if if if I'm bumped off that thirty thousand pounds go off to, goes to pay the mortgage. Yeah, well then we could sell the flat. Oh well we'll flog the f flat then. So we'd still have the money. Wouldn't we? Well you'd have to sell the flat then. Oh well Yeah but I mean we'd have a a flat without any any mortgage. It would be completely owned by your mum. So therefore she could do what she wanted with it. Yeah but I you you put me down as as as er next of kin you see You can name he said, who do you wish to name? Yeah. And he put your name down. I mean it doesn't say But it has to be your parents. No, it can be anybody I suppose, couldn't it? Yeah I suppose it could. I don't know what He put your, he he just put your, you down and that was it. Oh thank you very much. Oh well, definitely So that's it. Mm. Bahamas, yes. Hawaii yes. Yeah we'll go that way round. Mm. To Australia . Visit to Australia cos we might as well have a long cruise . What, yeah yeah. Mm. Better watch your step next time you drink whisky That's what few things on the stairs that's what er that's what you used to say er er er er you should never ever be worth more dead than alive. It's dangerous . He used to tell me that! Didn't you? Yeah he used to always say that. You n don't ever get yourself erm what do you call it? Worth more I'm worth more dead than alive. We all are aren't we? Most people are if they've got property aren't they? Eh? Yeah. Yeah I'm worth more dead than alive. Never mind. Well I hope I hope you're gonna be very happy. And I hope you've done the right Yeah, we are Here you are. That's all I I'm hoping I hope you that Stuart's done the right thing. It's him that's signed it. Well why? Why shouldn't he? Well He's done it with you, you're, he's got he's got you with him. Yeah. Hasn't he? It's not just him Ann. Well at least he knows with this m mortgage and that, he knows what it's all about. It's not like one of us going in and not Yeah. understanding and just signing papers. Yeah. At least he knows and he What you're doing. questions and he, he understands it all. Yeah. Which a lot of people would, say they go and sit down there and they say blah blah blah sign here and It's not fair but that is what happens. It's what happens because you don't understand all the No. terms and the things they use. You don't know what they're on about. No you don't. I mean even today he'd made a mistake on that thing and you spotted it where I wouldn't have done. Oh my god. He must be He didn't take tax relief off. Cos Stuart will get tax relief and he hadn't put that down. But Stuart noticed it straight away. I is he much cop, this bloke? I think I mean, it's something, a pension mortgage is something that doesn't crop up every day. No, not many peo you've got I don't know why. They don't know how to cope with it. I don't know why it doesn't crop up because it's cheaper than an ordinary one, so why it doesn't Because they don't want yeah well you you'd better tell your mates at work that. Why it doesn't I don't know. I don't understand that. And not only does Is it cheaper than an ordinary one? Well it is as mu it's it's worked out a few pounds cheaper. It can it can be yeah. It can But not only that at the end he's also, as well as the house he's getting a pension as well instead of just the house. Well that's what I mean. That's what I mean. You get a pe just an ordinary pension, thing, you know mortgage. You don't get a pension at the end of it. You're gonna get a pension as well. Well that's it. Well that's not bad. Well er I'd never heard of it. I'd never heard of it. Not only that you see alright the mortgage rates might go up but I mean if you're working your wages are gonna go up Stuart. Aren't they? You'll have a pay rise and and you're gonna still be paying s you know? So as the years go past Pay an average amount of your wage, whatever. As the years go past I mean if the wages go up as they have done, you know, regularly your mortgage is gonna gonna gonna be smaller. Yeah that's that's what happens with people now. Yeah. People who are paying seventy eighty pound a month mortgage who've had them for years and then Years. That's right. And the same thing will happen to you, see. And then you'll be pleased. Yeah. You've started. I mean I know it's hard to start with. Isn't it? It is difficult. But we've got all that side sorted out haven't we? It's difficult. I mean we paid eight qui , eight pound a month Er er and that was a hell of a lot of money. Yeah well that's it, if your wages are only eight quid a week if you're paying a month's wa That's right. one week of your wages out it's We were. I remember that. Halifax Building Society. Used to, I used to have to pay it. has to come out of his bank. Every month. It'll just be took automatically Yeah well they didn't have them in these days Ann. out of your bank, won't it? Direct debit. His money his money will be gone and we'll live on ours, mine. So I mean it's just the same whatever isn't it? That's it. You can survive. Oh yeah we'll be alright. As I say if they took my wages into consideration they would have let us buy next door even. Yes. They would. I mean it would have been a hell of a lot of I think nice as this next door here. Well it would have been a hell of a lot of money. How about that one across the way? Well that's it you see. But if if I'd have, if we'd have gone joint we'd have had enough Wouldn't you, if if if if you had Ann if you had the choice of these two what would you rather have? Seat-y belt on Stuart. better put her seat-y belt on then hadn't she? In case mister police-y man decides to stop us and say why haven't you put your seat-y belt on Mrs M Mrs woman? Sorry, sir. It's your responsibility to ensure that your passengers have got their safety belt on. Cos that would be nice wouldn't it?

I've now got there's now in the bank, after I've paid me poll tax and paid me , yeah. paid me poll tax, paid me s search fee and got a little bit of cash out for readies and s , there's now at this moment in time, there's four hundred and fifty pound in there. And there will be another hundred and twenty go in today so that's six hundred and six hundred and seventy in there at the moment. So there's a few hundred in the building society What do you mean, crossed fingers? That's what there is and It's not gonna come up to any more than anything . That's what I was sa , that's what's in there at the moment. I thought I'm making you destitute aren't I? Like me . I've got three hundred and We'll we'll be starving in our garret together darling . And a few hundred in the building society. And I've still got my unit trust thing but I know it's gone down. I don't want to touch it if I'll leave and leave it if I can. It, no, I mean that was always my plan if ever you need the money Okay alright. Hallo Mr . Hallo Stuart. How are you? I was alright till I see you. Cheeky bugger. I was gonna be nice to you today and all. Yeah as I say, that unit trust thing I was I know it's not the safest investment but it never was the safest investment. It was a at the time it was a I'd got the money and it was a bit of a speculation. But unfortunately it's not quite worked out to plan. But I mean if If it, if if I mean even with the market being depressed there's still gonna be eight hundred pounds in there. So it's that's mak but that's mak making a loss. I mean I'd rather leave it if I can until it does Yeah if we absolutely If we're absolutely desperate then We'll have to do it. Is it hard getting them out? I don't know, or I can't remember. Few few days. Phone them up phone them up. Find out what You don't want to make a loss if you don't have to. find out what the price is and if the price is you know whatever then you take them out. Just say right I'll cash, take cash and you and they will send you a cheque in the post more or less. But as I say, yeah unfortun unfortunately I mean if I'd left it where it was erm would have, it would have been better. So say if we have to we have to. You know, I'd rather wait until you know till Until it's taken out. till then. That's right. Until the market picks up again and I mean it's not a good investment is it? Speculative. yeah yeah but the when I was It's alright when I was advising Well well well that's it. when I was advising people on unit trust things it was always the price of your units may rise and, as well as fall. Er I mean there's safer investments. That's what I meant. Oh yeah I mean it was If you wanted to at the time, I mean it it was It didn't matter so much to you. Didn't matter so much at that particular time. And the market looked as though it was gonna be quite buoyant. I wish I'd have took them out a long while ago when they were higher. Mm invested them somewhere else. Well yeah, but like you say you don't know do you? No. That's one of the things that you don't know about. Say I don't know what the latest price is on them, but They're being rude up that end. Are they? They're being rude. No! And you wouldn't be? No no. No as if you would! Yeah.

So er as I say, we won six for eight, so so erm they're gonna play our next time. So we're still hoping it int the bottom, bottom playing all the chip shop there. And all Yeah. . Er er I'll want this conversation I know. We're having a conversation though. You got plenty of tapes. So far the bleeding . No because my I've got erm a letter don't know whether it was Friday or Saturday now, on from Tamgrams. Have you heard of Tamgrams? And it was about Tampax . In in you know, internal Mm mm. sanitary sort of, asking you what you use what size ha you know, how comfortable did you feel with them, you know, did you wear one at night? Did you wear a pad? Did you wear a pad when you were er heavy? Is there anybody else in the family, you know, a daughter, sister Mm mm. all that. So I put Lianne's name down and what she used for her age. Anyway, it said er you will receive free samples soon and then er er incentive bonus. So I thought well, I'll fill it in and send it back. And I thought well, even if it was a voucher for pads or owt, I mean, they'll come in for either Lianne Mm. or me she said. Oh but I said, oh owt for nowt nowadays Lianne. So that'll be stood here looking at my jacket, it wants washing, and Andrew's does, and our Lianne's does . Seems a bit silly washing mine and Andrew's today don't it? And when er . Have to get a mo a move on and, oh I must ask her Well my, my, my line's just about full of jumpers. I must see Daphne today. Well I've, I've seen her today but she said she'd er get me some socks and that calculating the correlation coefficient. It's not very nice. It's in your text books. There's lots of different formulas for this by the way. You take whichever one's most appropriate . I suggest you use this version because it's one of the easier ones to calculate. They all end up the same way but you do it by different ways. For example, you could actually work out all the Z scores but this equation you don't have to, but you could if you wanted to. You could actually work it out the longhand way, the way that we've described it Yeah I think you'll find that that's meant to be X and X The B's are supposed to be Y's. I do apologise, I nicked it, the B's are meant to be Y's and the A's are meant to be X's. I thought I'd got rid of them all but I hadn't, right? W you've got two scores, X and Y, for every subject, yeah? X X Y, now the B's should in fact be Y's It's what comes of talking about it in A's and B's and then changing to X and Y's. I mixed it up when I wrote it down If you find something in the text books looks about right and similar to that, use the text book version, I might have written it down wrong. This is not an X, it's a times. That's actually a times, multiply, so what you do is that N times that bracket times N times that bracket and then the whole lot is square rooted I'll come on to that shortly Another way of thinking about erm the product moment correlation is that what it's doing, it's putting the line of best bet through the data. It's finding the best straight line through the scatter plot. Now it's another way of thinking about it. That way of thinking about it will become very useful for things like linear regression, which we may touch on, and erm for the notion of variants accounted for, which we certainly will touch on shortly Now, there's different sorts of correlations. There's, somebody's mentioned Spearman's Row, I'd already mentioned it before I think. Erm, this is known as Pearson's and there are certain assumptions regarding it. Have you written that down? Yeah? Okay Assumptions for Pearson's are It assumes that there's an n an approximate linear relationship between, in other words you could cos what it's trying to do is draw a straight line through it. If it goes all over, if the relationship is curvier linear then you have problems with Pearson's, so it's gotta look like there's a straight line relationship in the first place. Approximately that now I've it's very y'know woolly, most people don't bother but you should really do the scatter plot to see whether a relationship is linear as opposed to something like that which would be curvier linear . it's a repeated measures design. Now it doesn't have to necessarily be the same subject but in some way it's a repeated measures, that's where you. It assumes that the scores have been derived from random samples. It assumes that there's interval level data. It assumes that you've deri derived the samples from normal populations and it assumes there's a home between the two . So what you're doing is making assumptions about the population from which your samples were drawn, so therefore this is known as a parametric technique Nearly there Now, another interpretation of Pearson's R, or the correlation coefficient generally, is variants If you square the correlation coefficient it equally the proportion of variants in X accounted for by Y. Now that is actually a very good measure of how good a correlation is. If you get a correlation of about point seven, it means that you're only accounting for forty nine percent, less than half, of the variants in the other var the other sets of scores Think about it, if it's a positive, if you've got a correlation coefficient of one, what it means is that you account for a hundred perc or or sorry, if you're gonna make convert it to a percentage, you times it by a hundred, it's the proportion there. So, if it comes out as one, one squared is one so you've accounted for a hundred percent or all of the variants in the other variable which means that if you know X you automatically know Y, or if you know Y you automatically know X. When you're doing a correlation study, it's very hard to work out what's the dependent and what's the independent variable because by it's nature you don't know. Little aside. Very last overhead, and you've only got to look at half of it. We're gonna do Spearman's next week For those of you who want to, what you can do, you can take the correlation coefficient. I've called it R P to distinguish it from Spearman's which we're gonna do next week, but you can convert the value of R to a T score and if you've got a T score you can look it up in T tables to work out whether it's significant. Most tables, though, in fact already give you correlation coefficient. So what we're saying is that you can take the correlation coefficient, multiply it by N minus two divided by one minus R, square root it first, and you convert it to a T. R P is the correlation coefficient ca calculated by the way we've j that that's just a little squiggle has no meaning as far as I am aware. That's where I fell asleep probably . And next week Spearman's rank order I'll stay behind for about five minutes if anybody wants to ask any questions Don't forget, some of you've got a lab class n erm from five til six last Monday That's right, did you miss the start of this? No, I just came in when you were saying That's right yeah they'll be about all night Oh right, that's alright then Okay do you mind if I get the stuff for perception Er is it? Yeah I mean I'll bung them in to you at some point Yeah, that's alright yeah It's one of the non-urgent jobs unfortunately Are there any absent friends who're sort of gonna appear imminently? Oh, here's one Have you just had a lecture? Just had a lecture? Oh right, just had lunch? Breakfast? Is there erm here? Did you get a copy of the,, that's what, I don't know what's gonna happen with that because nobody's got back in touch with me at all Oh right but is I went to t I said to them, d'you wanna scrap it yeah? I said there's y'know it was a couple of minutes late and they said erm it had to be processed through the proper channels. Waste of my time for an hour, waste of whoever's gonna have to sit on the committee for even more, ridiculous. It's a w new way of the system I'm afraid. It was a waste. I just went over there and said it was okay,th I'd put in a letter and they still couldn't just take it off. They said it all had to be processed so it's gonna have to go bef but I mean I will get very angry if that gets taken any further cos it's ridiculous, isn't it? Is there a course work deadline today? Fine, just in case I'm running over a little bit. We don't want to cause any body some distress. Okay, H P only. It's alright, I'm just checking. Apparently last week there was a course work deadline, I didn't realise. Erm Schumann psychology first years erm, that you isn't it, H P one? You're the only ones who have to do the essay for perception. Combined honours don't. That's my understanding from the book. Is that correct? Okay well H P one's on your notice board you've got four titles of possible essays. You can pick any one of those four. You can pick more than one of those four but the second one won't be marked. Yeah? Anybody else gonna turn up? No? Right Can I borrow a sheet of paper off someone just t . Front row's packed today Well you turned it off there Okay we started off and we was talking about the fact that when we perceive things they start off in origin as energy signals in the environment and we detect those changes in the energy and somewhere in the process they get converted into our experiences of perception. We perceive the objects, or patterns, or whatever. In the handout pattern perception is synonymous with object recognition. Object recognition is a case of pattern recognition I suppose. Now, we talked about attention as being a process whereby we could explain how it is that, with all the information that we receive, or our senses receive, that we only process part of it, and we saw that within the information processing model. Now in, is it Matlin? Matlin? Maitlin? Maitlin erm you'll notice that it concentrates on spatial frequencies which is a particular interpretation of the type studies where you look at the responses of the brain to particular stimuli. Now, as I said in one of the quotes that we were talking about, a psychological explanation does not need to rest on physiological causes. In other words you can have what goes on in the brain at the hardware level does or at the level of nuance doesn't necessarily have to correlate with what goes on at a high level description. So, leaving aside the hardware involved, is feature analysis one of the processes involved in object perception? Now what we're doing is a sort of historical sidestep. We evaluated erm the neurological feature detection, the work of grandmother cells and we said that in fact that probably wasn't what was happening, we were looking at spatial frequencies instead. Now, when their findings came out that the cell there were cells that appeared to correspond to feature detectors in the real world, a number of theories immediately popped up which tried to take this into account. So a number of theories of perception erm came on to the market as a response to the work of people like in the fifties and towards the end of the fifties we started to get theories of perception which were based on feature detectors. Now there's loads of these different theories. There was a whole whole sort of I don't know, what's the word, clutch of them, that came into being. Er I'm gonna talk about a couple because it'll give you a bit of a flavour on perhaps some of the more popular works that you'll find in some of the text books. Now the first one was Selfridge's Pandemonium model. Pand it's actually pan dee mon ium which is quite interest I couldn't work out what it really meant, pan demon, across demons, well that doesn't make much sense but you'll see why it's called pandemonium, in the conventional sense, model. There were two key components to this, there were things that er were labelled feature demons and there were things which were labelled cognitive demons. Now the feature demons corresponded to feature detectors. So, for example, what you find is that they're a number of features are detected by the feature demons, such as straight lines, which are either vertical, horizontal, at an angle, angles that intersect at ninety degrees, half circles, small circles, so they it was hypothesised that there were a number of feature detectors that erm were detecting features early in the pr the perception process When these features were detected or, well when these features were detected, this information fed into cognitive demons which started to respond. So if y there would be the cognitive demon which was the letter A and what would happen is, it would start looking at the features that were coming into the system and it would say, are they the ones associated with A? And if some of them are, then the A cognitive demons start shouting that by analogy and that's why it's the pandemonium muddle because many letters share similar features so that there would be lots of different little cognitive demons jumping up and down saying, hey it's me, as more features become apparent, or more features are detected. The decision demon, which is this one over here, which is p is a cognitive demon, looks at the cogit the output from the cognitive demons, sees which one's shouting loudest and then decides that that's the letter. Now, as you can see, that maps quite well with the sort of hierarchical feature extraction. You start off with a stimulus, which is here, there are the various bits that feed into the feature detectors. The feature detectors fire, higher cognitive demons start selectively responding to the features that're fired. The more features that're fired, the more likely it is that you'll get an out or the higher the activity level of the cognitive demon and then the more likely that the decision demon will decide that that's the appropriate character. I think that was fifty nine, Selfridge's model, that was the year it was published. It was at the end of the fifties, fifty eight, fifty nine Now, I don't know whether you've done language yet. I'm n have you done anything on language? Erm you'll find that there's something known as the Logagun model, which was proposed by John Morton, which is analogous to this which is a feature detector for sound. It's when it's it's known as word recognition. It's for recognising words rather than features or objects, visual. This i was taken to account for visual in particular of word recog letter recognition through the visual system. Morton's model was concerned with how we recognise wor auditory words and that was an a sort of analogous process to this. If you have a look at it, it's quite sophisticated and you'll come across it certainly by the end of your second year. And that was the Logagun models For about ten years feature models were quite popular in perception. Erm I'll talk about one of the later models, which was Gibson's, E Gibson as opposed to J J, which again was concerned with letters and whether or not we construct letters by recognising features from them. Can I take this one off? Okay Although I'm referring to Gibson's work, I mean this was typical of the time, there were a number of other researchers who were using similar ideas and notations. Erm, the idea is that letters are uniquely sep specified by different combinations of features, but certain letters would share more features than others So the idea is that you might consider that the letter X is made up of two features line going that way, whoops, yeah, and a line going that way, which when they're viewed together make the letter X. The letter Y is made up of a line going that way and a line going that way. They are holistic features, that is one feature that is detected. Now we're not su we're not sug er Gibson didn't suggest that that was the feature that was specifically detected by erm perceptual cells. It's just that we can think that that is a feature that is detected by the perceptual system. It wasn't said that there were cells that actually corresponded to those features, not but nonetheless the output from the system could be thought of as a feature detection system. Now the ideas was that if you presented the letters X or Y very quickly that people would tend to confuse them. If you present the letters very rapidly, just so they could only just be detected, erm you'd find that sometimes X and Y would be confused, whereas X and P were very rarely confused. Now they used something called a tachistoscope, I'm not sure about the spelling of that, which you don't come across these days, it tends to be computers that're used. But a tachistoscope was a bit like an oscilloscope or a screen where you could flash a word up for a very shore period of time. There's a lot of work done on tachistoscopes in the sixties and the seventies. By and large they've been replaced by computers now. But you often hear the expression, tack iss stock ope, tachistoscope as presented by a tachistoscope, right, there you go. Some letters were found to be more often confused with other letters and these letters were deemed to share similar features E G, B and P were often confused whereas B and X weren't so you'd be flashing either a series sequence of letters up, some of which shared features, some of which didn't, or we thought shared features, and then we saw whether they were confused or not, and this was taken to support the idea that features were extracted from the input, or that's how we constructed the letters or characters that we were perceiving. Interestingly enough, when you come to language, we'll find that that's a far more complicated topic. Erm, how do we recognise letters and words and you'll come into a lot of other factors influence that. But one of the earlier findings which began to cause problems was that the sound of the letters, as well as the features, determined whether or not they were confused so B and D, for example, sound similar therefore they tended to be confused. You could also find some letters that were confused, they didn't share common features but they sounded the same and they tended to be confused as well There was a lot of enthusiasm from the work of the neuro-psychologist th with the discovery of cells which appeared to be sensitive to particular features. Erm, that over a period of about ten years, began to wane and by and large now I think feature analysis per se has been abandoned as a as a model for understanding human perception. Interestingly, it does feed into some of the later ideas that were associated with computational modelling, I E using computers to recognise objects on model processes, in particular perceptual ones. The rip there're a number of problems with feature analysis and you can read books on them. Erm, I'll try and summarise them A perce an understanding of perception, whereby we say that i features are hierarchically extracted, is unable to deal with ambiguous input. If the input information is slightly ambiguous then a feature analyser would be confused and unable to deal with it, a pure feature analysis. For example, if we take those words there, I I hope that most of you can work out that that says, the cat, right, some of you can be difficult and say that you can't but I should think that most of you can. But if you look at the H and the A's, they're in fact, feature-wise, identical but you're able to work out that one's er an H and one's an E based on the context. So any feature analyser would have to deal with context so therefore they started to look at the role of context and we're gonna look at contextual effects later on, probably next week or the week after. So the way that we process or extr it cannot just be we take a we take the information an and build up the letters by extracting the features from it because if you did that then the H and the A would come out the same both times but they don't. So there're other processes that're going on. Right, in a simple sentence, contextual influences are not easily accommol accommodated by feature analysis . When you look at certain letters, you can see that they've got exactly the same features involved in them. Take the B P and D. You often see that the P's, the D's du du and the B's share similar features. They've each got ideally a circle and a line so they have identical features but they're different letters so clearly, I mean it's quite obvious, it's not only the features present but also their relationship to the other features that're present that determines what type of letter is recognised So any model of perception would have to take that into account . Another thing, when you look at how people recognise characters, it's not a the features that they pay attention to, but the overall shape. Quite often when you're looking at people's handwriting, you can tell by the overall shape rather than the single features. So, a feature analyser would also have to take into account the overall shape of the letters so it's becoming a bit more complicated already in terms of the model that would have to account for it. Now, all of those criticisms come about on the work that's been done which has mostly been done on the recognition of characters and letters. Erm,wh most of these criticisms would become far more exaggerated or far more relevant if you considered what happens in the real world. What are the essential features in the real world? So these problems and similar ones to them are generally led to an abandonment I suppose, or a lack of interest in feat in a pure feature analysis view to how we build up and recognise objects . The next topic we're moving on to in a way w is is erm speaking in terms of time, precedes the work of the feature analysis, the feature analysists. Erm it dates back to the twenties, perhaps a bit earlier than that. We're gonna look at psychology and what they had to say about, or the school had to say about perception. They were far more interested in how the whole image, or the whole perception came about. Rather than being concerned with the minor details being elaborated into a more complex picture, they were just interested in how we come to group erm features together for want of a although they weren't thinking about them as features. Most of you have probably come across the saying, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Now to some extent what that's acknowledging in the role of perception is the fact that perception isn't a bottom-up driven process. Th it's not a case of everything's contained within the stimulus that's coming in and we elaborate it into whate the object. Er we bring ideas er concepts and knowledge, which are very important in interpreting information. So they were in a way acknowledging th that sort of work or approach. Now this psychology, there's absolutely loads of stuff on it so and the Maitlin book's got quite a good coverage of it, so I'll go over it quite quickly, alright? Generally it falls, although I've used as the sub-heading, I suppose the overall title of this area is perception organisation, the way that erm things become organised, how we perceive them as an organised whole. Okay, with objects are perceived as structured coherent wholes rather than as discreet component parts. So they were quite interested in that process Most people are probably aware that the school produced a load of laws that were associated with perception. Interestingly, they also influence memory. I don't know if you've covered the influence school on memory, have you? In your memory lectures? Is that a yes or a no? No. What lectures did you say? Oh. Well anyhow the had something to say about memory as well erm which is quite interesting. Most of the ideas, or the laws that were were derived which erm pertaining to to the school, derived from something called the law of, now would anybody care to pronounce that? Pregnence, pregnance? Anybody here do German? No? Does anybody here actually speak German? Okay, what does that mean? Pragnance, any idea? Progna I s to be quite h I've forgotten, it used to me it means something quite interesting and I've forgotten. So thirty five of several geometrically possible organisations that one will actually occur which possesses the best, simplest and most stable shape. So that's the guiding principle of the view of perception. Most of the other laws if, in a way, follow on from that one You'll notice that I've sort of spaced the writing out today so you haven't got to do so much. Same number of overheads to keep me happy, but you've gotta write less to keep you happy, there you go. Now the sorts of laws that they came up with were things like the law of proximity, the law of similarity, the law of common fate, good continuation and closure. Right now the I mean there's loads more as well if you wanna look them up. They're the more common ones, or the more popular ones . It's a very sad sight y'know to see all these empty seats. It's quite, I'm sure they were fuller at the start, alright? I mean is this a general tendency in most lectures, or just mine? I've noticed . You can be brutal Koffka K O F F K A Okay? Can I take this one down? A picture that you'll find to sort of try and ex give you an example of some of the l a the text books have got some great pictures on these particular sorts of examples of the laws in practice. we have here, well, what do we have here? That's an interesting question, eh? Okay, what we actually have are a selection of dots arguably, those little well sort of funny looking dots, elongated dots, there you go. Yeah, dots. We have those sort of things. But in fact the dots are seen as lines due to the laws of proximity and similarity. They were looking for the principles of organisation, how it is that we organise things like dots into a meaningful whole Why is it that we tend to see two lines crossing in the middle rather one two than two V's? Law of good continuity Then you tend to get things like closure where, instead of seeing four separated lines, you tend to see a square or a rectangle or whatever. The law of closure. The books are full of good examples. They've also got some lovely illusions erm figure and ground illusions wh ambiguous figures. Y'know, the old hag and the young lady as Victorian sort of principles . Now when you look at the stuff it looks qui it's plausible, it seems to describe what you see in practice. It seems to be a good account of it. But when you start to think about it in terms of erm sort of psychological explanation as you're becoming used to, then it becomes perhaps not such a good way of thinking about perception Matlin's got some very examples in it of this of those sorts of things By and large were concerned with people's experience, self-reported experience quite often, of the phenomena saying well tell me what you see when you look at it rather than being based on the sort of lovely stuff that we love, good solid empirical data, yeah? So being psychologists who can't get enough of it, empirical solid data, we tend to erm be a bit dismissive of the methods that were used by the Although these laws tend to describe what th what's happening, they don't actually tell you how they're achieved. W what mechanisms, what processes underlie these laws of perception? It doesn't really tell us very much about those at all. They weren't concerned with that, although they did come up with some electro um electro-static field, or electro magnatic magnetic fields in the brain or something. It wasn't really erm a very satisfactory explanation and it lost favour quite quickly There's lots more Matlin lists a load of problems. These are sort of a summary of them erm I may have missed one of the minor ones out. The laws, whilst they're pretty good at applying to things like erm visual illusions and two D and dots on pieces of card, they're not very good at really applying to solid objects. It becomes very difficult to apply the laws to solid objects. Surprisingly, considering a lot of the illusions that were provided, in fact rely on contextual information. What I'm gonna say may seem strange but they don't allow for certain contextual influences. Now y'know you can come up with a description of that as an ellipse but in exactly the same shape, in a slightly different context, yeah, you know it's actually circular and it's a hoop and your perception of the object is different. They don't really give erm much of an account for w how it is that erm similar objects which're grouped according to their laws erm can be perceived differently in different contexts. For those who came in late, the essay titles are up on the first year notice board. Essentially the four areas are computational modelling, what contribution a don't write these down because they're not the same as the ones on the board, but it's looking at the role of computational modelling in perception, although you could start off with a broader definition of it within cognitive psychology. Erm, we're looking at the modern approach to th or modern evalu evaluation of the approach. Looking at visual illusions and perceptual errors and I ca what was the oth oh and the role of attention in perception. They're the four areas. Some of which we haven't done yet, some of which we have, so it's up to you. You can either do what we've already done or you can base it on stuff that we'll do in the future. Either way it should be helpful Now, interestingly people, more recently, and by that the late seventies and the eighties, have attempted to actually operationalise and measure the principles and they've come up with some fairly ingen ingenious experimental designs to take tha to explore these avenues. Er I'm gonna give you one here, although there are several more which you'll find references to in text books, okay? Now this is a lovely quote I think. It really gets over . Percepts I think are sort of breaking things into their sort of components if you like. them on the floor and watch them shatter into natural pieces, di dum di dum di dum, in the absence of such a direct technique, more indirecti more indirect alternatives must b must suffice. They're saying is, it'd be nice if you could take something that's a holistic perception and fragment it into the component parts. But of course that's very difficult. the notion of getting hold of a sort of re a perceived object and dropping it on the floor and watching it split into it's component parts is quite appealing If you take a, if you imagine, you could take an object that you're perceiving, yes? And you could break it into its fundamental component parts, yeah? It's just what I said before. Yeah Now Pomerance, who's one of the people in the quote, has done a lot of work recently er by that in the last five six years, looking at how we can investigate the, or objectify, the measures that w or the laws that were used by the . I'll talk to you about one of his experiments to give you a sort of flavour of it, although other people and himself and others have done a lot of interesting work that's similar. Right. Let's have a look at this. What've we got? If you, in case A, if you imagine that you're presented with with a piece of paper or card and it has two symbols on it, right? It could have it like those, like those, like those, or like those So that would be one deck of cards that you'd be given and they'd have the four types of symbols on them, separately of course. Now, the alternative deck of cards in B would be those four. Your task is, regardless of the symbol that appears on the left, to sort the cards into the four shapes, right? So you ignore that symbol and you just decide which deck to pu pile to put them on based on those f the four first symbols. Now, in deck A it was argued, or proposed, that there is the symbols are similar, whereas in group B the symbols aren't similar. So, Pomerance argued it should be easier to process just the right hand signal if they're not grouped together, if they if the processing system doesn't tend to group them as a single entity. So the it should be qu easier to sort these than it is to sort those. Sorry, the other way round. It's quicker to sort those rather than those because what tends to happen is that you process them as an entity rather than as single figures. It's a very difficult task when you come to do it, if you want to have a little play at home. You can even entertain the kids. Okay, the task was to ignore the right hand bracket and to sort cards based on the left hand bracket In fact you'd sort them into two piles, not four. He did a load of different experiments, this is just an example of one of them. They're all very similar He, or they, manipulated the notion that similarity, they manipulated proximity by varying the distance between the two brackets, the two pair of brackets. So how far away did you have to put them before you no longer saw the interference? What Pomerance and others are attempting to do is to operationalise definitions for proximity, similarity, closure and those type of measures and then they're seeing whether or not they're using visual processing time or decision task or attention task to as v as ways of investigating the similarity or otherwise Take this one off or? Now, another notion, we talk about the idea of bottom up versus top down processing. Bottom up processing is where you start with the input information, whatever that might be and then you, based on that input information, you extract or inp or extract more meaning from the input until you end up with whatever it is that you recognise. So the process starts with the data and it's totally determined by the contents of the data, right? An it's a notion that you'll come across again and again in cognitive psychology. The alternative notion is the idea that you impose meaning on the input, in which case it's a top down process and it relies on contextual information and information that you already have i on previous knowledge. In perception, you tend to find models of perception that're based on top down or bottom processing. Now the feat hierarchical feature analysis that we've done so far was predominantly a bottom up data driven process. Whereas most of the models today that we think of we regard them as a mixture of the two but with a he and, depending on the type of or the piece of perception that we're working on, we have either one the other. We tend to have, but they never, they very very rarely occur in isolation. There's always a little bit of bottom down and there's always a bit of top up, regardless. So you th this distinction isn't a pure one. There there's no idea of a pure bottom up or pure top down process. By and large most cognitive processes are a mixture of the two and in fact it depends on the context that you're operating them in, we tend to be able to split from one to the other. Now, in perception, as we've we've mentioned that you've got bottom up and top down driven processing but what you've also got is something called global versus local processing. Now, this isn't a very good impression and I think you'd go to the doctors if you had something like this. The idea is, I'll present it you and you you can I won't try and astound you with it because it is hard to do that under these contexts. What we've got is a shape here and a series of shapes there. Now isolated they look fairly meaningless and it's very hard to work out what they are. That might be a letter or something. What you've actually got if, if you bung them together, well you've got a sort of face. If you had a face like that you'd be down for plastic surgery tomorrow wouldn't you? I mean, look at it. But er yeah rhinoceros man, mhm? Down? There you go. I think you c well you c that's it. There's only global versus local processing above that A and B only make sense when seen together. A provides a context for B but B serves to provide context for A. These are known as local features, and that's known as a global feature. Within perception you quite often get erm a local processing going on simult apparently simultaneously with a global processing and the two sort of mutually influence each other. So, that's distinct from top down or bottom up. There's another sort of notion of whether you process the global feature or whether you process the local features and you attempt to find out they it dep vary between processes and which one they use, but it's another way of distinguishing the sort of processing that goes on. I've only come across this with perception. You don't tend to get it in memory and problem solving, although you get the forest for the trees in problem solving so I suppose it's there in a way. Do you pay attention to local features to build up global or d the other way round? Well it seems that the two interact. It's hard to say it's one or the other. But it's another way of looking as processing. You could describe it as global or local . Next we're gonna look at the role of context or computational modelling. I'm not sure which one is better to present to you first. Ah computational modelling is easier for me to present to you but then the role of context might become more important so you can appreciate it, in which case I shall give you that first. I don't know, I'll have to think about it. Normally I do the computational modelling first then context but I might do it the other way round, right? So it's one or the other next week. I've run out of things to say Thanks a lot By scientific revolutions How're you spelling kuhn as well? K U H N? Yeah that's fine Erm, long report, can you do the short report ? Yeah Yeah? That was easy wasn't it? if anything can be done to say one of must take those steps are needed to be taken up . Thank you Miss , Mr . Thank you Chairman I am interested from Charles who was saying recession, what recession, you were reminded of er an unfamous Tory jokes did when he came back from er, er crisis before saying . crisis what crisis in respect of this bloody . . that's quite right have I do, one part I th I, I think we should spiff up on, I've said that erm that er London er L B A were er did say that employees would be relocated in British Aerospace. The question is, don't mention a word of it, it says and I quote, every effort will be made to assist employees as they seek alternative employment. Well they all say that, don't they? Er every, every employer who has laid people off has mentioned making er strident efforts to er replace people alternative employment, some they already have but, in many cases of course they have not. The point that seems to be forgotten what Charles is that there was a meeting last month . Now members of the Labour group of transport probably, it, it, it's the question over lossing airport came up there and one came up now. I think you may find that there'll be a different decision made. Er as to existing policy, we're elected to change policy, existing policies were to an extent rejected to a large extent rejected by the electorate here to, er so that the electorate should do. The point that this motion makes is to try to make action, the facilitating attitudes over there is gonna lead to five hundred people losing their jobs in April. Now if the Liberals wish to vote for five hundred people to lose their jobs because they're allowed to do all well and good and our press release afterwards will make sure the people are aware of this. Erm this is an effort to do something, the last, I am sure the sterling efforts have been undertaking by Welwyn and Hatfield District Council in this consortium, you know where's the beef, where is the evidence that somethings been done, this is merely asking to look along this line to see if anything can be done. We are not suggesting any solutions, we want information with that information then er, a judgement can then be made by this Committee and something can be done to accept those jobs and to create employment for an unemployment . Thank you Mr Mr . Chairman, erm erm I am misses erm . . in my earlier advance. One one of the many reasons why I don't want to accept this Labour resolution er, I would like to support my own member, is that er we have very, that there will be appoint a member of the involving members from Welwyn and Hatfield District and St Albans District and County Council at that appointed meeting with officers will be considering the outcome of the consultation process. Joint officer reports coming from County and District and that is another reason why I I actually urge this County Council not to accept that resolution. Could I also say that Mr as perhaps inadvertently misguided us, there's a hundred and forty two people work for L B A. I have seen the letters from the Chief Executive of L B A, Mr , to the Chief Executive of Hatfield in which he categorically states, people will be redeployed where possible within . Has he made that statement in public?, because his public statement says does not Mr Chairman I believe I have the floor and I would also say that contrary to what we've just been told there are people employed by what was called and three to four hundred people are employed, they're not effected other than fifteen people, fifteen people were not effected by this statement and there are some hundred and eighty people who still work for and connected with the project. So we talk of five hundred redundancies is totally wrong and I think erm in the circumstances calculated to give the wrong impression I hope I will urge that you do not accept the resolution and that we accept in . Thank you Mr . Miss Yeah, I've got a question, the meeting of the various District Councils and the County Council is it going to take place before or after the redundancies have taken place at Hatfield? sorry, sorry I'm, sorry I missed that, which meeting, where?. Right the meeting for the various District Councils and the County Council, is it going to take place before the redundancies occur on the first of April? I should think there's a very high probability that it will because as I said to you earlier, the,yes. . Thank you, Mr . I'll say one thing now about a question. As say that your answers from the people at that in fact certain jobs are safe and being redeployed. All I can say is that in a period of two years erm of five, in that time there was five sets of redundancies at erm Hatfield, there are two occasions we were told that they went through it and agree with the unions that there'd be no more for twelve months and one occasion there was another chap in three months, so if you believe anything that the P A E people there, you know, you really want to wear dark glasses but could I ask you a question, I understand that there is something going on at work with Richard at and my guess is, is, erm that sort of job which we are, there is some form of development plans going forward. Can I just say, what he's really saying between the lines is, are we really saying that these few hundred people might be a necessary sacrifice to produce a greying plan to redevelop?. Because that's where I think the difference between us comes. That there's an attempt here to trying to save as many of those jobs as possible and I don't take the insurances of the gone through the system now, but exactly true you're saying that it is . Thank you Mr say for shall I put the er, Mr 's amendment to erm to the late resolution . Yes ca can I just check with, with, with the movement that the resolution is as follows? Er does each Government pass in, in, er is passed? And at the end does these all words are to given to and insert the redevelopment site for long term employment . Perfect. Thank you. Well can I see all those in favour of Mr 's amendment to the Labour resolutions? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Can I see those against? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Can I see then all those in favour of the resolution as amended? Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Mr . In order to I need to prepare my resolution. second it?. Yes. Thank you Mr . Agreed. . . Okay now move on to item number nine-four. Mr . Mr Chairman thank you for inviting me to speak and I think there's a preliminary for what to get a member of the Committee to propose the resolution and second it. Er Mr Chairman I beg to move that the member of that panel. Thank you. I've said that Mr Chairman . Thank you Mr Chairman, it's a pleasure to report that the was marked by a maximum of co-operation and a minimum of it and, at the risk of offending people by er designs of the factory, people or groups of people. The first of them is the group thank you to all of them for assisting the panel sometimes working on the computing. The second group, that most of them would of been since the report and each of them. The third thanks contain some risk, contains some risk of other on the part of the direction of law and administration, who is going to hear me behave rather like a Captain Hook and raising the crocodile. The crocodile in this case being Mr John . And I hate to take that particularly because if you are bored with this book . which is the report, you can go and see the film. . There're are complicated members of the terror act and it's not an entirely frivolous suggesting because if you have any doubts that the performance of this County Council in it's for duty to maintain the rights of way network to a standard appropriate for the traffic, then go and look even at a small part of John 's film. Mr Chairman I am going to be brief within the er triscale and resources we have available to us we may, I think, a reason of what an attempt to get back in current idiom, back to basics. Now don't take that too literally, certainly in sub zero temperatures and I think the first of December and to do so would I think er have er maybe with some risk of being in 's phrase stark raving bonkers but by that you may think I mean that I think we made a fair attempt to deal with the three principle issues which have caused so much annoyance to user groups, there's a backlog in modification orders. A very large number of obstructions and particularly season er seasonally obstructions and the visitors or should I say invisibility of many of the files in the network. In respect of the proposed problems, I think we have come forward with clear, simple and positive recommendations and therefore I would like to support the acceptance of all recommendations in this report and finally, though it's not my place not being a member of this Committee to comment on the budget you have agreed earlier. It is my understanding that the principle proposals at least in this report can be accommodated within the budget that you have agreed and therefore I suggest there is no barrier to the acceptance of the recommendations. Thank you Mr Chairman. Thanks a lot. Okay and I'll then move on to er Mrs 's resolution. If the, if only my with the er the resolution, I would like to compliment Mr with the handle of work and I think really it work and I need to find the problems in saying in what needs to be done, er County's work in this department. Erm we are making more money in favour to them and our resolution is to ensure that even a, a profile of work to be carried out, so that it's quite clear what's been done, the time scale, the er the amount of resources that is going to be needed. Not only so be the monitor progress in the work so we don't get ourselves bogged down as we have done before and not managing to carry out the work that's needed. We also going to identify at an early stage the financial resources that will be in next year in order to meet our obligation with identifying worthwhile all the time and then by a course of are reserved er to, to support Mrs . Before we accept the motions sir can I just speak. er Miss . Er thank you Mr Chairman. I would like to say in general Mr I think that as a Committee we should welcome this report which does, it really does er has done a very thorough job and ha a a and provides us now with a s understandable framework and and time scale work when you've got target and when brought forward or shown to any member of the complex that that erm I think provisionally with the backlog of what is now ready to tackle the result onto our and commissioner is grant er, er grant,erm there will be, it will be like an enormous benefits not just in those areas that John has taken us to but in general atmosphere which kind of be very tense and competition and I think we'll be, be seeing the action in this token er within it will be er target time, erm real pro real progress will be this I think the feeling of that will going, come by will, will, will be a lot of ruling er in this area and maybe even start to er leave the question from er as a result and the signal to the users of our serv , of the services and erm would go out of here in a planned way and in answer to er fairly speedily and you know what or reduce the erm the aggro. I would also like to welcome the milestone approach. Erm there is publication that, these are be asked for be sent a copy to every mem member with it's er in a way a milestone initiative in in the middle of work. Erm and although they do er acknowledge it, it is it will be er, it will be seen helpful systematic way of er assessing where the Council is perhaps sort it out and then in fact we will prepare with other authorities. Erm and will save probably eighty, will, will in some areas er will, will job. Erm I mean looking at the, er the only solution, I feel erm another poor factor of this committee is probably er erm unnecessary and if I look at appendix four which lists the possibles, if I can find, erm it isn't actually necessary to have rules all like this, er next years erm, next years priority will be dealt with next year. We have er instructions and it is it says on your instructions until health care prosperity can be committed within the erm, within the erm department so that'll be taken care of in it's place. It's not possibly to be obvious to say you write an estimate of financial communication, but the first year against the should say this is brought up for review. So I mean do think that perhaps you still got a lot, a bit of unnecessary and indeed and we er will not . Thank you Miss Mr . So, I'll be brief erm we welcome the report, we think that there's a number of very valid points, we hope that funding has been agreed today er allow er the major parts of that go forward and now, we are commissioners route, further a funding group as for future years, so they will be accepting er the second Labour amendment. Thank you Mr er Mr . Er Chairman, er yes my understanding of rights of way issues was er, er significantly enhanced by receiving and reading this, this report. There are one or two areas where I remained confused but I'm pleased to hear from Mrs that we're going to get some more information on milestones and growth because I looked at appendix B and thought well, yes, that tells me something but not a great deal. Erm I would welcome er more information on, on that. I wonder if I could just raise an issue on item two three D on page four referring to horse riding because there is a concern about a, a lot of walkers, that horse riding on footpaths creates problems for them erm in, in terms of chewing up the path in, in such a way that they're difficult to walk on, people even wearing boots. Erm so I would hope that the further consideration of the issue of horse riding on, on rights of way obviously that relates to bridleways but the issue of the use of, of, of, of footpaths should be addressed and indeed where there are er bridleways one would hope that there was space to er make available room for horses and room for walkers because if there isn't room er there are a lot of considerable er difficulties where horses, particularly where horses are, are, are regularly being erm ridden in, in, in, in places where th where the walkers wish to go. I would hope that would able to be er taken on board. the I mean with refer to footpaths you are not allowed to ride a horse on a footpath. But they do. . But they do. on bridleways to horses and walkers and . Thank you, Mrs . Chairman while though it's being recorded perhaps I could take this opportunity to add mine. As er Chairman of the last countryside forum that met on the twenty ninth of April ninety three, it's the week before the County Council elections. We recorded in the minutes that rights of way resumes high priority in the next cycle that a report on the subject be for submission at his first meeting June ninety three. I would like to record my thanks to the members of all sites who have given such enthusiasm and interest to this problem, this topic and that the erm County Council is now resourcing rights of way in a way which we felt was necessary and I would thank our staff for their persistence, patience and their continuing efforts with great er verseatue we I am grateful Chairman. Mr before we Yes I was just going to respond to Mr because we did actually discuss horse riding er o on the bridleway network along the footpath and er well I do hope that what Mr has said felt that he had has considering condoning people riding horses on the footpath are breaking the law. Er but the one point that was I want some explanation Chairman . challenged, one point of personal explanation, that's exactly what I didn't say, I said we had to ensure that walkers were able to use the places they can walk where horses can are, are also using that er, er, er route as well. It it's obviously wrong that where they have had access, lawful or otherwise, that the that they shouldn't be interfering with the rights and the ability of the walkers to walk along that route. Yes I know what Chairman yes of course the bridleways and bridleway then you expect to find er the horse has been along That's right. but the point I'm trying to make is that the person who made the presentation er o o on er for, for the best of riders, I think he's rather missed the point because he was talking to you about the, including, more information on er within the T V P and we did discuss, er we did like to make it quite clear during our er discussions that riding of horses on the highway is a matter for the T V P, riding horses on bridleways is a matter that we will have to deal with in basic in time. The two really are quite simple. Mrs could you start us now? Well I would speak on the way that resolution number one er that's the report we brought back to the committee about timing and implementation. I do feel that this is necessary because we are allocating or just allocating our proposed budget er a substantial amount of extra resources through the rights of way which I am thoroughly in favour of but I do think we need to know how that money is going to be used and which of the items which are to appear in the report are going to be covered by that money and which is still going to need to be addressed next year when we have to book in time for it for next year. I also think that having to report back would assist with dealing with the many, many people who have complained about the state of our footpaths network but individual complaints and with user groups and we're off to see representatives out of County Council, they're not here today but they're off to hear it at our Committee meetings and I do think that having an officially report back to the Environment Committee would assist in meeting their requirements would be good P R. Thank you. Thank you Mrs . Mr . Yes, yes Chairman and I think all this is red? Yeah. Oh what was that that fell off? Like that. Yeah. So all that can be black and that can be red yeah? But where would you take the black ? Well all that His head's gonna be white. That wants to be black? Yeah black. I've never varnished any clay before. All I've done is use because we couldn't have any at school. gonna be black down to there? Yeah. But I'm doing his head in white. What the back of his head? No that's gonna be Well this wants to be red. Red yeah. Then there wants to be a white band like it's collar. See he doesn't really want much brown on him he just needs a coat. Don't like this colour now. Well I'm not putting it, I'm putting other colours on top of it. Oh that's alright then. Purple and that. That's red. That's black. That's yellow. Yellow. Do you see what I mean? Yeah. Unless I mean this hedgehog could have been done if I left it couldn't it? Okay? Yeah. That's black Okay? Yeah. And what colour's his hat gonna be? Probably red. Okay. black with a red band. If you like you could open one of those little wheels if it, especially a difficult one like yours Emma. It might be a good idea. I'll go and get you one. Thanks. Sorry did I get you? No it's alright. I just wiped it all over my . I was just about to say I expect you could really make a mess if you tried and then I realized I was covered in and I'd better shut up. As long as the fire alarms don't go off I don't mind. Oh twice Again. Well Wednesday when I was in, I teach up until five on a Wednesday and kept coming up and saying that all the lights were gonna go off. That the electricity board was doing some work so not to get the class started. Well no-one ever knew that the fire alarms were going off. No-one at all. I think someone was just taking the mickey and kept setting them off. Well they went off twice. I think they must have done Right. Well from here I can see all sorts of bits so I suggest if you get Yeah I know. Let's put erm a piece of paper How am I gonna ? on there and then you'll be able to sorry Emma I didn't hear what you said. How am I gonna paint under that black Very carefully without getting the red red and the red Well if you hold a piece of paper there. Yeah? Get a small piece of paper and hold there as you do it. Thing is every spike's gonna be changed a different colour anyway so. Yeah but you want to make sure you haven't got any under here. Right. Before you finish doing that just lift it up and paint in round under here look. You've got a Got a line. bare bottom. That's the sort of colour you want for the top of your isn't it? Yeah. Right. If you want to use another colour just check round and see what other people have got, alright? Cos it's pointless keep making up loads of paints when other people have already mixed the colour up. And share the colours. bits. As my children say. You must co-operate. Watching too much Sesame Street. Co-operation Is that from Sesame Street is it? Yeah. Oh right. I think I was probably watching too much Sesame Street as well. Oh. I'm getting his eyes. There we go. Right. How do I paint in there then? What do you Right. There and there and there and underneath. My frog is called Basil. get a small piece of paper What about the hedgehog? Harry isn't it? paint that side you see. And then it won't go on to this side. Are you with me? Yeah. Basil the tree frog. Okay? So you can get the brush in goes against the paper. Yeah but the thing is I'm sorry Emma it had to be done. Well you'll just very carefully. I mean if it's right at the back it doesn't matter if it's black or red. It's just gonna shadow anyway. Yeah. Okay? Oh my god This is not gonna be fun all his spikes. I'm just going to wash my brush. I think you ought to put flowers all over him. Daisies. Yeah why not? Lovely colour Big pink ones. Go for it. Orange. Why not? Be creative. Look at my hedgehog. He should be brown but he's not. Go on Eva. Be a daredevil. It's lucky it's not actually a boy now. I was gonna say if you had flowers on it it'd be a bit bit . Ooh. That's nice! Mm. Basil the tropical free free I keep saying, tree frog. He's gonna have some colours on top of them . Thing is I bet you the spikes that goes exactly next door to him I'll paint yellow. What colours are frog's nails Pinky. Pinky red You could have flowers all over your frog as well. We could have a real hippie parade couldn't we? Hippie frog. Oh no. I've got black on it. This is the last lesson this term isn't it? Is it? Yeah. Oh we've got next term haven't we? How many lessons have we got after term? Four I think. Emma. Can I use a bit of your glue? Just a teeny bit. Emma was that? What do you want? Can I have a tiny bit of your glue. You may. What are they to finish painting and do a bit Inside? Dark green? Do some Or pink or red. Er it depends on how much you want to make it stand out. I think I would probably do it dark green. Dark green, mm. Sort of colour Emma's that that colour without being altered is is fine. Yeah. Do it with a small brush. Alright. Or you know sludgy sort of colour like this I think I'm gonna do it dark green. This is gonna look well weird. I need a brush with a bend in it to get under here. Yeah. That's what I need too. I love this hippo. This is really . I love the shape of his legs. He's lost a tooth Has he? Ah! He's been to the dentist. Well you must stick it, you must stick it back in there. Right so let's have a go. This has got to be red. Yeah this is gonna be fun. It's gonna be like a jigsaw puzzle. Keep your brush wet Fiona and then the colour will sort of flow in there. He was nearly a dead hedgehog then because he nearly fell off the table. Yeah do him as an old hedgehog. We got a hippie hippo. An old hedgehog. What makes brown? Green and? Don't know. Don't know. You might as well just get a brown. No I want to make it. Green and yellow makes brown. Red and black. Not red and black. Red and black make brown as well don't they? Subtle colour. When they find out yours is broken though. What's broken? Quite, quite a few of them but I mean Caroline's blew up. Caroline's blew up . Poor old Caroline. He had a happy life though Caroline. Yeah. Met with a grisly end, but I don't think so actually Sarah. Yes I did as well. Yeah. I was choosing to ignore it. Right. I need to get under his No I can't get this bloody thing done. I don't care I'm just gonna paint it and go over it. I had enough . I just painted it and I'll go over it with the black. Does this paint smell of or is it my imagination. I haven't really smelt it yet Fiona. Yeah it does. Yours does. There you go. Oh it stinks. Oh no. No no no no no. Quick give it a mix if you don't mind. This is your white here look. No god no. Got me brush. You might as well use me paint. Only joking. put red in his mouth. Yeah but don't give him rubber lips. I'm gonna rub powder paint in all over it and see what happens. She didn't recognize her erm owl cos it had shrunk. Oh isn't it tiny? She remembered it as being bigger. Oh oh Oh it's really tiny isn't it. Oh it's really dainty. Oh right. What colour can I do now, brown? You can do whatever colour you want . Mine's a tropical free trog. Free trog. I've said it again. Free trog Where's the palette things or whatever you call them? In that cupboard over there that's open. This'll look quite nice when he's shiny though won't it? Yeah, I'm gonna do mine shiny. Frogs are wet aren't they? Mine's not. Mine's gonna be You gonna do yours brown then? I don't know. If I do him brown or put in white all round You can do all round there. You can put, do brown and put colours on the top or you can do him any colour and then put any colour on top. powder paint on the top. You can rub it in. Rub it in, yeah. brown and then I'll do all round his face white. Can I borrow your paintbrush ? Yeah all the paintbrushes are over here. You've got my little brush I want. Oh sorry. I might do this last actually the eyes and I'll go back and do them when they're dry. Do you want the black? Yeah. Okay that's got black Oh that's looking lovely. I'm gonna do the eyes when it's finished because the white went all splodgy cos I couldn't get the brush in even though I had a tiny brush. Right. paint in his nostrils? Yes. And I'm gonna paint red in his mouth as well. Now this. Where there's lines that just lends itself to having a dry paint rubbed down it. Yeah that's what I'm gonna have put on. I want to use that little bit of gold as well to just sort of Yeah. Shimmy shimmy shimmy. Shimmy shimmy gold. All the powder paints are in the cupboard next to the sink in that room. Right. Okay. Alright? Now careful as you pick the packets up because some of them are so old. Ugh! Now this is where you really must wet cos then it flows will not go green. Oh I found a . Let's do him green. You done any little fleas on it yet? No that's gotta go green cos this has gotta be green. You're gonna come on Saturday aren't you Michelle?

I don't like it like that though, so I dunno. I'm being fussy I know but Paint him a bright colour and then But it's just weird. I don't like it at all. If I paint a bright colour over the top of it then that'll go sort of weird won't it? Yeah. So I'll do it like that. I might use purple actually, I like the purple. As long as it doesn't go black. But I don't wanna use it . Well make a different orange. Bright orange. I'm gonna do a bright orange dragon. Let me go and put this back and then He's gonna get a complex that, that dragon . what I'm gonna do now. Erm Eva, can you pass me the persil please? Do you want this brush? Mikila? Yeah that's fine.

Good morning Vincent, I'm enclosing copies of faxes received this morning from New Zealand, and certainly the rate quoted is more realistic, then drop down a line and put eighteen by two point nine five pounds, oblique kilo, equals fifty three pounds, ten pence, next line documentation, twenty pounds, next line customs clearance etcetera, thirteen New Zealand dollars, I'd say Irish pounds, three point three, O, O equals nine pounds approximately and total it up, eighty two pounds, ten pence which is approximately a third less as you see David suggests you lean heavily on Air Lingus and point out at the same time that Challenge Seeds have no intention of paying this exorbitant rate, also what is a consolidation rate? It seems to cover a multitude of sins. Look forward to hearing from you, best regards, Sam. Hello Sam I, I want to talk to you about er the conversation I had with Alec yesterday, he seems to be inundated with having to get details about on his er, all his paperwork and so on, and he seems to be inundated and he sounded a bit low, quite frankly, to me yesterday on the phone that he was getting inundated with all this Mm, mm work. I said I'm quite sure there must be something that could be done computer-wise Right but he sort of pooh-poohed it and sort of said well you know, we're getting a bit to old for all this modern sophistication of computers and so on, well I said well quite frankly I am not totally in agreement with you, because as you probably know Clyde was looking into a program which will could alleviate a lot Yes I know, I know of the work, that I do, but I yes it's on the would tell you right here and now, er I'm still retaining my bible you know the book Yeah, yes, yes that I have downstairs, because it's, if it was to be computerized, it would be a massive great bloody great volume Yes and I would be carrying this around and it just wouldn't be feasible Quite, right so he said that apparently whenever he came back to B S H he was told by Neville roughly about eighteen hundred acres would be sort of his target Target, right and it's, it's multiplied by about three or four times that you see Oh right, right, right so consequently he's getting inundated, he really is apparently under pressure Mm, mm, right so this is why I raised the very conversation about it Right, right and er, I said well look I'll have a word with the erm, with and see if he can think of anything that might Yes alleviate the point all things in mind that are possible on er, on er, on er computer, and he said that he hadn't much time to think about it and said well look, maybe over Easter Mm put down on a piece of paper what essentials you want done Right and what things that you're liable to get asked Right, mm, mm so he's going to do that, so I said well look, do you mind if I had a wee sort of prelim talk with him Right see if, if it's a possibility Right What he's looking for is certified numbers, field numbers That sort of all this sort of information right, well the, the, well there's good news on that front because in our, in the actual new version of the seeds package which we have now Yeah erm developed and it's gonna be released in the next few months Right there is er, a very complex and detailed er section for a oh and indeed keeping the history of fields and so on Right oh I see in that and I know Alec has seen the previous version of this package Right and er it was certainly er then, a very primitive Yeah, yeah erm package and it has been developed now to quite, quite a high level of sophistication Oh good Now that certainly should cater for all his requirements, the only problem that Alec will have to go through now, is that actually get all this information Yes, right keyed into the system Yeah, yeah erm and since the volume has increased quite dramatically Yeah he's heavenly gonna need outside help to do this Well that's when I said to him, I said have you any outside help, and he said well really, no It's just him it's him I, you see that, that, that, initially he is gonna have a problem You see he's so Yeah and then he's coming back to this mass of work He has to get it done and er, and, and, he feels look, well I'm caring with it now but some time Mm four eyes, as he calls it, is gonna get Uptight about it, yeah No, no, he, he'll, well, no Alec is going to get uptight about it Yes, yeah and the last person I want to see leaving is Alec Would be Alec absolutely cos I I think what he needs to do er is to say right, well there's a problem here, go to Netherlands Alec, they need help here to get things set up That's right because I'm ab I'm absolutely convinced having seen the package Yeah erm Sam, it does produce er you know tremendous information Yeah and it's easily updated because er from what I've seen now you can actually key in sort of the acreage and then update the crop inspecting reports Right and each time you go out and look at the crop update Right that very, very easily Oh I see and print out a variety of reports on that Yeah and then erm it will as you go along, as the crops are actually growing in the fields, you can change the yield on it so as Oh, aye as, as it gets near to the harvest you can come to Yeah, yeah quite a close estimate of what the Estimate, yes, yes the harvest is gonna be Oh that's excellent because er I said, he said oh I don't want to be lugged with a big computer sort of thing and so on, so I said well you might, you might be able to get It's a little portable thing that can Yeah go out with you and you, you can push a button and it'll come up with a standard form That's and click on the informat information that you've got already on it and whenever you come back home, or not, into work, you plug it into the master and it it boots in That, that is certainly, you know, it, that can be, and, and it's something which we'll probably look at a wee longer term Well what, what sort of made me say that was because er across the crevy well at least all these travel ones are Yes all these little little manual things, yeah hand held terminals, yeah and they go out Yeah and they can do all the measurements and the trial grounds and so on Right and then come back in Right and push it into the big and download it into the system Yeah Yes that, that's certainly something which I know computer applications Well are now currently looking at must do erm, but the one other area which I'm sure Alec would find useful for as well, this new thing, er it's trying to find as many benefits for them Yes that's right as possible to make it easier for them to set it up, is that we're hoping to develop within the next er few months in fact, a certification form Oh system yes so in fact what will happen is, they will have all the details about the fields and so on Yeah and then they will be able to generate all the certification forms for the Ministry Right so Alice, er what do you call, Alec at the present I wonder does Alec time, he does all that manually I wonder does Alec been told about this? I don't think he may have been told about that, now he himself if he knew about that, that might be sufficient digging him over this hill That's right, correct because at the other side of the hill he can see well, life's gonna be a lot easier You know Alec er , Alec comes up and informs me and I always say well Alec how are things, urgh, do you want the good news or bad news first sort of thing Yes, so it's not easy, yeah. No well that's alright, maybe if, er you are talking to him, I don't know whether you do talk to him Well I don't, Alec's probably er one person who I don't speak to a lot really Yeah, right because er If you are Yes and you get talking about always see if I am Aye mention that, yes Aye, aye mention that and say that you Yeah you have Mm possibly something that's coming along in the Yeah pipeline that would alleviate his problem. I think it's always the problem Sam where people have used a manual based system for so long Yeah, that's right and that the new technology coming in, there is, in the early stages of a lot of to you work put in to actually set up the system Yeah but once they've gone through that pain barrier Yeah and got it set up and running Yes things then start to taper down again Right, okay er, but there is a very steep learning curve Yes to go through right and a lot of people do fight against it, and I, I can understand it er, it's so different to me Yeah, well he sort of said oh we're, we're a bit old for this or something, I don't know what Alec is, I thought he was only early forties or something I think he's probably mid, mid, mid late, mid late forties probably could be forty something, mid forties mid late forties, yeah I thought it was rather strange er I admit, but I, I sort of, I think I've got him round Yes that he's going to sit down Right over the, over the, over the holiday period holidays and look at it and just, is it all you have to do is jot down what you want from the terminal Yeah or what information you want on this thing and what generally information is asked of you Mm, mm from maybe Neville or me or somebody No cos I mean, that's what prompted all this cos I was getting some information from my right ninety one harvest So that's it, okay Well he should have that all on the system That's grand okay Okay Sam thank you very much indeed Pleasure Is that two O three one N? Zanussi two O three one N is correct a Zanussi two O three one N with a remote control I tell you what you can find out about them is Well I, I, what I'll do is I write off to them, and say what I do is, can't remember where, where we bought it, I think it was Comet There's no er, no you don't Comet they're chosen they're terrific er No, well they're closing down for the, all the more reason they must have a big stock big stock Well right, well then, how long has, how long has that been going? Er, that's a good question, four or five years, more Must be more four years and er, er, oh it must be ten next, ten been here eight We had it fixed, we had it fixed before Christmas Mm, mm and it just went and we had to get these guys who, who did the washing machine Right they were somewhere out in the North Road Mm, mm on the North Road Aha but they came out collected the set, we managed to borrow a set from elsewhere Mm, mm and it was bloody and erm This was at Christmas? this right at just oh god you know? Yeah Couldn't of happened at a worse time Worse time and erm they had it back within a week and it cost twenty eight quid Oh that wasn't too bad and they gave a list of what they did Yeah that wasn't bad was it? and they cleaned it and everything Yeah and, we must say it was very warm Yeah, right, oh that's good. I mean, most is labour and we have to when you think er A call out today a call out is twenty quid twenty quid it's thirty quid here That's right Some fella told me that only a couple of weeks ago, but the greatest rip off of them all, have you heard the greatest rip off about Betty and the, and the roof? Oh yes she did Oh she told me, I, I felt sorry but er I told her before, I said he was a con I knew, it's so easy I said er, you wanna make sure like er Get a price get a price before he climbs up er is thirty quid okay? Well he climbed up on the roof and he came down again and whatever he done, there was nothing wrong with the roof for a start That's right and then he charged it and er she if, she know, she couldn't do anything but pay him Mm, mm och oh she was conned but when he came, he came back for the money he came back she told them that, that's mine, she told them that I didn't think much of this and I thought it was a rip off and he had the nerve to say that is the first time I've ever been said about it the first time ever he, all he did, he kind of Cemented something No, no he, he unstuck er a drain and then said he did something on the roof Mm, mm there was nothing wrong with the roof, the roof was all heavy fixed, for Mm, oh well we all learn by our mistakes Yeah, I tell you, even Ian now is very about paying bills and, and Barry I say hit the roof when he heard that one Oh these people that I don't have people that call at the door, I want somebody I get them That's something, that's something I must He did a couple of things on the roof that's something, but this thing reaches publicity stage, which it could in a couple of weeks time, appear in a paper, you'd have all sorts of weirdos What, what's this? cold calling, once they've put the house on the market as such they start the advertising of the house Yeah, yeah, yeah Are they going to advertise it or are they not? Er are It's in the Irish Times like on the property section I know that, but there are ways on a Friday there are ways of doing that they don't do that, you know there's a thing I well they may just put it, a photograph of it in their offices, they may not put it in the paper Mm and then your man also told me, he said, this is something you have to watch them, John says they've already paid that for doing all the advertising Mm, mm and I said well why did you pay them before they, the job had been done Yeah oh that's the way we did it and we got it something off, this guy also said which some auctioneers like who are highly recognized Mm you can do a deal Mm, mm whereas they will work on a lower percentage of the house sale Mm, mm than what is tendered Mm, mm and you can do a package deal as such, but you incorporate all the advertising they do, but you'll have to get in there and kind of knock a deal out Mm, right you don't say I want my house sold full stop, cos they'll make you that Well we have , yes that's right, they could do it er, and you say, you said you have to watch them Er what you're saying then is that the house then is being, gonna be put up It's gonna be put on the market, but that Aye doesn't mean it's gonna be sold, after,af supp supposedly after Easter Oh that is when the so called, which is another point I don't agree with, the so called tide comes in, that people are more interested in buying houses Well that actually is true Yeah well that is The general it is true but Yes Yeah in this particular area you sell a house any time Er I, well in this particular area well if people have money if the people have money Well they do, look, the rich people can buy a house any time they want Mm, mm and the rich will buy a house in this area, like you have Embassy people Mm who, who buy, have fixed up staff in Dublin, where did they fix them up around here, I mean er, so many different Embassies are understaffed Well you see somebody who's who's if, if they buy it they're going to say well they have to do this one Yeah, yeah, yeah want to make that all different there, the kitchen all in one and the utility room have They also want to sell their own house as well probably Well if they had a house to sell if they're moving Yeah there'd be people come along It's more likely you'll get somebody that's Well you'll get people coming along surely out of curiosity And you get the one And they're the ones you need to watch and you get the walkers as well saying I'll give you er No, if it's strictly by Oh yes only view by appointment only and it happened the first That doesn't cover, see after the first night they don't give appointments to any I know the time, you've got people who stay, who stay I understand this, the selling of the house will not take place here at all, it'll be taken away from the house No it's the appointments to view , we're talking about and also there be no auctioning out furniture in the house or any other Oh yes, yes No, no , no but they'll, they'll have to people that view it they know that, people to come to see the house you can, you can state the time to go what somebody comes to that, tomorrow and knocks at that door and says look I've been sent here by you say good bye, good night, good luck nothing has been said to me, I know nothing about this And you have to be firm and not let anybody in Once you have let anybody in they'd chop you up and put you in their next stew Oh aye certainly yes oh I can believe that, that's quite true, but you get a lot of deal, I mean even that, when we were selling our house, there were people a lot of people Oh knew, knew the minute walking, walking in, that they were only just coming in just to see Yeah how the live Yeah, but in fact, in Betty's case you can see the difference in Betty's, in Betty's That's why I don't want to have any placards out there, no way Aye, cos we even had people where, where, where the placard you see, people'll say oh that house, I wonder if they'll let us have a look at it now as they're passing And they annoy you and they come in and, and, at your meal times Yeah and had one on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve or place the most successful jockey in the history of national hunt racing Peter Scudimore. He polled eleven percent. Runner-up the ever popular Willie Carson. Willie received seventeen percent of the overall votes. So who did you vote for? Who's the nineteen ninety three Channel Four racing personality of the year? It is Mary Reevley who polled twenty percent. Just as successful on the flat or over jumps I think this is a very very worthy winner our congratulations to Mary Reevley and I'm gonna get her on the show and present the prize to her. If we get her on the show that really will be something cos I know she's shy but well done. Ling Dell can be proud of her up in North Yorkshire. Charity bets twenty five pounds and we came down in the car from Newmarket she had the she had the post out the light everything, now what's what's it going on? Exactly. I've not, Alastair accused me of being topical because of a member of the royal family this week this is not the reason but I've gone for Leotard in the one twenty five at Cheltenham. Could a lot fitter than it did ah I love it. Oakes what are you going for? Mm. Ballasarly I'm going for. Ballasarly? There's a slight I mean over hurdles there's a doubt about his stamina Mm. but erm he won at a huge long was it the er Queen Alexandra Yeah. at Royal Ascot erm so that I'm confident he will stay and Mr Pipe is not dead yet. That's true. And Alastair what do you fancy? What's your ? Er Front Street in a small race at Nottingham. Small prize big chance. Cor blimey. I haven't heard of that one.

Alastair's going for Front Street at Nottingham number five in the two twenty, Thomo's going for General Pershing in the two o'clock at Cheltenham. Picture puzzle. Picture puzzle. Can you work out today's picture puzzle? This horse is running somewhere today. Okay I wonder where? I promise three extra ice creams a day now will you please come on the set. Something to do Miss er Sara Lingfield I wonder where that's running today? O eight nine one double nine double one double four win a hundred pound do you win a copy of this book? This is the William Hill racing dates. It's a smashing book that Graham Sharp's brought out. What's the date today chaps? November the thirteenth? Peter Niven rode a five timer at Ayr in nineteen ninety two. Eighteen eighty nine the Foston selling plate at Derby was declared void after the whole field got lost in the thick fog covering the course and ended up running round the back of a cricket pavilion. Have you been round the back of a cricket pavilion recently? No. But there was a one day in which Frenchie Nick Nicholson erm brought all the tail-enders across and had been told the one thing he shouldn't do was be last he was thinking I'm not last and behind you then he came in in front of him and he was last. I love it. Lovely story. Anyway that's it from the morning line. I'm off to Windsor they're off to Cheltenham and everywhere else. We'll see you next Saturday. We'll give you the result of picture puzzle then. Till then from all of us bye bye. See you next week. We regret the use of the word genocide in the motion since it is quite out of proportion erm as well as being offensive to many. Motion three three eight calls for full implementation of the content and intention of the European directives. Congress, G M B has been to the forefront of the campaign to ensure that the laws of this country are brought into line with European legislation. It is ironic that a government that talks so loudly about law and order should subvert the rule of law by blandly disregarding its obligations under international treaties. This government is subversive in the true sense of that word. G M B has brought cases under the equal pay directive and the enquir acquired rights directive. We are lobbying hard both here and in Europe to ensure that directives are fully implemented but any revisions to existing directives do not weaken their impact and that new directives are as strong and effect effective as is possible. We have alerted the T U C and European Commission to the danger to workers in insolvent enterprises if the acquired rights directive is watered down. We have done more than any other union to help prepare the T U C's complaint to the European Commission that the abolition of the Wages Council is a breach of the U K's obligations under European law, and London region has recently won a test case on the application of the acquired rights directive to the opting out of schools, and potentially of sixth form colleges and hospitals. The C E C also, also wi wish to make a statement on motion thee five two. A widespread myth among personal, personnel managers is that they can change terms and conditions by simply giving notice of intent. In fact they have no contractual right to do so any more than we can give twelve weeks' notice to increase the pay of our members. Unless the contractor expr expressly says otherwise, employers need the consent of workers or their union to any change in terms and conditions. Our difficulty is that the contractual position is clearer than unfair dismissal law so employers can sometimes, though by no means always, achieve the same result by issuing notices of dismissal and offering new contracts of employment. However, the new Trade Union Act applying a European directive will require employers to consult with trade unions before issuing dismissal notices in such cases. Such consultation will have to be with a view to reaching agreement. A requirement which will strengthen our hand in erm holding employers to their contracts. They may not find it, they may not find it impossible to change contracts but it will become increasingly harder for them to do so. Congress, please accept motions three three eight, three fifty, three five two, three five three, and three six five, and accept the motion three two three with a qualification, thank you. Thanks very much indeed . Put the motions to the vote. Motion three two three, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Motion three three eight, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Motion three five O, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Motion three five two, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Motion three five three, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. Motion three six five, all those in favour? Against? That's carried. I think, colleagues that's as far as we can go today. Just one or two announcements. We've had sixty nine speakers in total today, fifty two men, seventeen women. The important point is there's been fifty eight regional speakers and eleven C E C and officers. Can I remind conference that there'll be a collection for the Burnsall strikers, that's being taken at the door, immediately you going out. Tonight should be pretty lively, political rally, we all know what the subject's gonna be about. Seven thirty to nine o'clock. John Edmonds, John Prescott, Claire Short, chaired by Tom , should be very interesting indeed colleagues, try and get there. There's gonna be yeah sorry that's here, yeah, he left his notes the Banqueting Hall at the Guildhall. Cambridge anti-apartheid sponsored walk John from the London region, he's trying to get sponsors, he'll be circulating er leaflets to that effect. Colleagues, don't forget, conference tomorrow morning doesn't start at ten o'clock, it's nine thirty. Please be on time, conference stands adjourned till nine thirty tomorrow morning. Have a good night, thank you. a very low base, and that is going to be used by the Home Secretary when, when he, he, he puts the cash limited budget together next year. We are going to suffer as an authority for many years to come, from that low budget. I actually put forward an amendment, to the police authority, whereby we take that er, million pounds o , of pensions, and by a certain amount of slight of hand, it be put back into county balances, and then re-allocated back to the police authority for this year, and that would have added an extra million to the base budget and it would not have cost this county council one extra penny. And that in fact was, produced a split vote in the police authority fifty fifty, and it, it was chucked out by the chairman's casting vote. That is absolutely correct. Erm, now as as this so called generous funding in fact, the police authority are facing a straight deficit of three hundred and twenty-eight thousand, they are facing a further deficit of four hundred and twenty-five thousand because they have only been given one and a half percent for pay, where all the information we have been given from the Home Office, you can shake your head as much as you like Chairman, it is in fact true, and in fact, in fact as reported in the Guardian,on , only the day before yesterday, yet again the police bill is to be, almost certainly four percent, not one and a half. That amounts to another four hundred and twenty-five thousand, the total shortfall is therefore seven hundred and fifty-three thousand, and that's without any projection costs. I mean they've gone out the window. Erm, Now erm yes or it's zero based budgeting. They, on the contrary, the police authority have a working party which had four very long and very detailed meetings and went through their budget line by line by line, and these are the figures they came up with. There was no argument about it, that, that, that was passed by the working party and main authority. So erm, don't let's have any of this nonsense about being, having privileged funding. Erm, the er, I refer to the er, freeze on police officers, in fact we need sixty-eight more. But we're not going to get them now, because this county council won't provi won't pay for them. I certainly support er Mr 's amendment, and totally reject what is here in this democrat , er, er, proposal. Mrs . Thank you very much Mr Chairman. Er, Colonel is erm, doing a very good job over there in trying to make our flesh creep over the whole police situation, but I can tell by some of the remarks that have been erm, given from the body of the chamber that not everybody agrees with him. I would just like to answer one or two things, erm, erm, he, he, one of the things he's saying er, is that erm, oh dear I've forgotten what I was going to say now, and I haven't got it written down, got it written down, can I go on to something else erm, the Home Secretary does seem to be in some disarray over the proposed bill. I'm glad to say it got a thorough sort of leathering in the Lords, and so I think it's rather premature for him to say that by fixing a budget we have belighted the whole police service in Wiltshire, for the next er, eight or whatever number of years he said, I think that certainly is rather premature. I have hopes that this bill will very much, will be very much amended, er, when it comes to the Commons. Erm, Mr mentioned about erm, the new provisions would cut down the paperwork, work and put more policemen on, police on the beat. But erm, the Chief Constable himself, and I have heard him say this, has no confidence that the paperwork will be reduced and that any er, more constables will be seen on the beat. I'm also very worried, and this has been mentioned erm, by Mr , that the er, the Home Secretary seems to regard the police constabulary as a mere crime busting organisation, whereas really, the preventative work, the crime prevention, the work in the schools and the community work is absolutely vital if we are ever to solve, erm, we're ever to stop, the er, if we're ever able to stop the rise in crime, and this really has to be done hand in hand, I feel with local councils, and I'm glad to say that there are some initiatives around, one of them in Mr 's own district, which is making erm, some very important steps towards that. Erm, one other thing that I want to make about erm, the victims, erm, I am very much er, involved with erm, victim support Wiltshire, and one of the problems with victim support Wiltshire is their work is increasing all the time because the crime rate goes up, and every time there is more crime there is more victims, but the, the Government has not yet said that they will put the money up that they erm, that they er, the grant up that they give to the victim support. If perhaps the Government were to fund victim support properly, Erm, Mr who was burgled and has never got over it might perhaps have had a visit and some counselling from a victim support worker, and that would be a very good thing. Thank you very much. Mr . Thank you Chairman. Colonel really can't have it all ways. Er, in his er, comment just now he er, referred to the enor , the enormous er, amount that it was costing this council to er, fund the special protection service. Erm, when I drew attention to this, one of the first things I did when I got elected to this council, erm, we get papers back which seem to suggest that in fact the Home Office are funding it at a level which, dare I say suggests that we might even make a small profit, er and I have in fact recently been approached by colleagues from Gloucestershire, asking us how we manage in that er, er exercise, because they're concerned about the high cost of er, protection for certain royal establishments in their county. And they're most interested on how we er, achieve this exercise. The fact of the matter is, that the police are getting more money, and they do need to er, manage their resources most carefully. And yes we did argue, I think there were fourteen meetings of the finance working party involving hours and hours of consideration and we were er, treated to four meetings lasting fourteen hours, fourteen hours, in total. We were treated to the long diatribes of detailed considerations about the cost of paper clips and God knows what else. The fact of the matter, at the same time, erm, as you yourself have said, Chairman, we are in a situation where we have four communication rooms coming down to two next year hopefully, I personally think it should come down to one, but lets recognise that they're costing the police authority one point six million pounds, they're tying up forty-one uniformed police officers, and something like fifty er, civilian officers on those exercises. So lets be quite clear that there is still a great deal of slack in the police budget,whi money that could be used to er, put policemen on the beat. Mention has been made to the paperwork, I think that it's worth reminding ourselves that a lot of the paperwork that has been generated, is a direct result of Conservative government introduced legislation, particularly cri criminal justice er, legislation, which requires a considerable amount of paperwork, erm, to be completed by officers, quite often in long, in longhand, and not making use of technology, where in fact they er, a great deal of time and effort could be con , er could be er, saved. Members, other members have referred to the crime prevention exercise, I'm very pleased that this council has actually grasped that nettle and is going to fund a crime prevention co-ordinator at some stage in the near future. I notice it's not coming out of the police authority budget, it's coming out of publi , er this, this er committee's budget. But, we, we really need to er, put the cart before the horse, or the horse before the cart as you may say, I mean, we are now being told by the leader of the Conservative group, that er, we're going to, we, we should be supporting the idea of amateur parish constables. I look to the day when the, to see what the tabloids make, when one of these individuals gets clobbered over the head er, in carrying out their duties. I think this is policing on the cheap, and it is something profoundly to be regretted. I would much rather see more emphasis placed on er, enhancing the special constabulary, er, because I think that is a, a far more er, productive initiative. I mean I am totally opposed to vigilantes on the street, and that's what I think a parish constable service er, runs the risk becoming. But at the end of the day, there simply is no point in punishing criminals if you can't catch them, and I think it is absolutely critical that we should be devoting our attention er, to policing that catches criminals and prevents crime, and I entirely support the, the points just made about the er, initiatives within the community particularly in the schools, because I think it is absolutely critical that we er, promote a society where crime should not pay. Sadly, in modern Conservative dominated Britain, crime pays. Thank you Chairman, I, I, I'm rather amazed actually, at Colonel 's er, comments because er, in Stratton St Margaret there has been a sixty-one percent increase in crime, and a four and a half percent detection, decrease in the detection and prosecution of crime, and I was absolutely amazed when he come out with the figure that there's going to be a seven hundred and fifty- three thousand pound shortfall in the police budget, when on the radio, in my car this morning, from a very reputable source of Wiltshire , there was a police officer on there this morning, saying how good they were in producing a freebee newspaper for distribution to every household in the county, to show the police offi , the Chief Constable's report this year. My question is to, that er, police officer or to the Chief Constable, or to anybody who can answer, how much is it gonna cost that, for that paper to be produced, and would it not be better spent in putting a police officer in Stratton St Margaret, where there hasn't been one on the beat for the last six months, to help us reduce the number of er, of crimes committed in Stratton. I would like an answer to that. How much is it gonna cost the police authority to produce this freebee newspaper? Mr Thank you Chairman, I despair sometimes when I listen to, to everybody trying to make points out of a discussion like this. I mean, what we're talking about is that throughout the whole of the world, there has been a tremendous increase in crime, whether it be in Britain, in France, in Germany or wherever. What we're also talking about, is elderly people being able to go out at night and not be too frightened to go out at night. And the only way round that situation, that may not even amount to crime when they're put in fear, it may amount to yobbos on the pavement, or people er, cycling on the pavement or just being their usual threatening loutish selves. At the end of the day, the only way to do something about that is to put more men on the streets. I mean increasingly we see that we're, we get more constables here more constables there, but they don't ever appear to be actually out on the streets, and until we can get more men on the streets with the deterrent effect that their appearance has, let alone anything else, we are not gonna get much further. Our, most of our rules and most of our laws are made by people who are frightened of losing their property, and not the sort of people who are frightened of being mugged at night. If they were the sort of people that were frightened to go out, up to the newspaper shop or something like that, our penalties and our, our priorities would be slightly different. And my plea is, apart from all the politics that's going on, and all your wrong and I'm right, etc, etc, etc, if we've got sixty-odd police constables available, then, somehow or other we ought to try and find the money to resource them. If that money has to come out of the existing budget, then we should, or the Chief Constable, or the Police Committee ought to look at the priorities again. But the number of police constables that we can have available, would make a big difference to the lives of the very ordinary people, and that's where we should be looking at first. Thank you. Miss . Thank you. Yes, well, I mean I'm very happy to be able to agree totally with that erm, people who make the laws aren't the people who suffer from the the physical , and matters might be a great deal better if erm, they paid a bit more attention, I do hope that he would agree however, erm, that police officers who are female also have a good effect on the streets, because he was acting as if erm, it was only the male person who were any use, and I'm sure that is not so. Erm peo , people can't have it all ways, there hasn't been any cut in the police service, in the police budget, I'm sorry, erm we have for many years funded the police in a very generous way. This county council has funded them more than social services erm, for, I don't have the figures in front of me today, but for a long time, erm, this is unlike the overwhelming majority of county councils, who spend more on social services than they do on the police. So as a proportion of our budget, they have been well funded by Wiltshire, and I don't think anybody could dispute that. It, it's possible that the, the, the manning per hectare in this very rural county is lower than in central London, I wouldn't be at all surprised. But erm, you know, it's, it's like erm, if you talk about erm, funding per head or funding for the, for the overall spaces, you know, if it's Mr , he always wants to be funded by the, the mile of roadblock for the population, because we have rather a lot of one to the other, and I think there may be a similar situation with the police. Erm, I don't see how anybody can possibly say that the police are not privileged. Every other committee, or part of this county council has, with the exception of probation service which we did today, social services and libraries which we did at budget revue, have been funded at last year's cash limit plus one and a half percent. The exception to this is the police, who have had by far the largest addition to that, they haven't lost money when they lost S S A, erm, we have been ge , extremely generous to them, far more than to any other committee this year, erm, and although we haven't given them money for, to pay awards because we don't know exactly what it is. We've never given money directly for pay awards anyway, because if you do that, that's what the claim always is, you know. There is sufficient money in balances to pay our share of that, if we need to do so, and I think making scare stories about it doesn't do anything towards what I hope we all want, which is an efficient, effective police force in this county, protecting us erm from crime, and helping to prevent as much crime as possible. I, I urge you to support 's motion. Mr . Thank you Chair. I think has summed up quite well there I think, which, what everyone's aims is, which is that we want an effective and efficient police force, which everyone has got confidence in to make sure that it protects citizens against crime in this country, and nothing could be, I don't think anybody who is erm, civilised in this county or this country would want anything different. But I think that there has been some interesting arguments put forward this morning about the act, there's more policemen, or sorry, should I say police officers available to Wiltshire. But if the Home Secretary feels that we can have more, er, er, police officers, why doesn't he give us the money so we can employ them. I mean it's as simple as that, and I Colonel 's comments, saying how hard done by Wiltshire police constabulary could be next year because we haven't set over the odds budget for this year so that the Home Secretary can take it on. If he, the Home Secretary feels that Wiltshire's so badly funded next year, if he's a caring and considerate Home Secretary, then he'll put more money into Wiltshire and provide more police officers for Wiltshire. It makes a change that the burden of more want is put on the central government instead of local authorities, because too often in the past, central government has said, in many issues, oh, we think you should have that, but the responsibility for paying for it comes from the local authority. But we're not going to give you any more money. So it'll be nice to see the tables turned, and Mr start, keep rather quiet about the number of extra policemen, sorry, police officers needed in this county, and other counties in the country, because he'll have to pay for it himself won't he? And that'll be a t turn up for the books for him. But what does amaze me, is the reason why this motion came forward in the first place. It was quite obvious Mr thought he had something up his sleeve to embarrass the Labour party and Liberal Democrat parties of this, this council. He thought, when this Lieutenant Colonel came back to him and said, oh my God the police budget's in problems, we've got em here, that they put something onto the council agenda. And he's had it slapped in his face, because this council has provided an adequate budget for the police authority, it has pr , treated it fairly and squarely like every other council committee, and made sure that the service they provide is adequate for the people of this county. It's funny that he flags at the interests of the party of crime. I think nowadays we all know, that the flagships of the conservative party, crime is no longer a thing they can fly high. We're on about taxation this week, well the- they're in trouble over that now. The party of low taxes, the party of high taxes they failed on that. I won't mention back to basics because I know that's really embarrassing for them so we- not, we'll go over that very quickly as possible . So we have had a failing government, we've had a failing Tory administration, and the people who are interested in looking after this county and all it's services within the budget set by central government, has made sure that we have got a good police force, which it will not receive cuts in it's services, cuts in it's er, it's, it's er, forces, and make sure that other services, like education, social services, libraries, highways and everything else will also be adequately funded in this county. Right, well I'm going to reply to the debate, and then I hope we can move to a vote, ah, oh I didn't see your hand earlier Mr , I'm sorry. Thank you Chairman. I think enough has been said regarding this today, in relation to this, I think we have supported our police force, we have a fine police force in this county. We're very supportive of it and have been. Unfortunately, as was earlier on, central government has led the attacks, it's led the attacks through Sheehey right the way through, and we were supportive of our police then, I think not only of this county, but of all counties, and all county police forces said the same, and we will support our police force, and certainly this budget recommends itself to that. If central government wishes to increase those expenditure levels when they go over, that is down to them. They've been trying to get the police on the cheap for too long, and blaming us, and now I think the tables are very reversed. Thank you. As I say I think I'll sum up and have a vote, and then I intend to break for lunch on conclusion of this item. I think what I find most unfortunate, is the intellectual dishonesty of the Home Secretary. He's a very bright man, Michael Howard, but it's quite clear that he's much more concerned with grabbing the headlines and finding scapegoats, than with taking action through law that will actually improve the chance, both of preventing crime and of detecting crime, and then even more so, deterring people from re-offending, and it's most distressing to see that when research showed that a particular non-custodial method of punishment is effective in perhaps fifty or seventy or eighty percent of cases, whereas prison is not, he goes for prison, he goes for picking on squatters, he goes for picking on the defendants right to silence so that we can see more people like er, jailed when they were innocent. But I've left that sort of civil liberty out of this motion today, because we can't deal with all the, because we can't deal with everything all at once, but perhaps it can be tou touched at council, because we had Colonel , who also doesn't like to be confused with the facts, trying to tell us that next year the, or the year after next, budgets will be cash limited, but I've got news, they already are cash limited. They are trying to suggest that erm, somehow this year we're cutting the police budget, he seems to have forgotten that last year when he was chairman of the police authority, a three hundred thousand pound cut, a genuine cut was made in the police authority budget, budgets were cut to make up to make up to that three hundred thousand, at the discretion of the Chief Constable, and to the credit of Mrs , and her other colleagues in the police committee, virtually no attempt was made to make political capital at that time, instead of which now, when all we've seen is a request for the Chief Constable to defer proposed new spending, all of a sudden this is presented as a cut. Now reference was made to the police finance working party which met for a long period of time, and unfortunately made no progress whatsoever in zero base budgeting. There's obviously been a misunderstanding there, a lack of communication or whatever, but whereas some departments have got to grips with the issue, unfortunately police wor finance working party just stuck to the traditional way, rather reminiscent of Mr 's old budget working party days, which doesn't get to grips with the real needs and the real costs. Now Mr referred to a two percent clear up rate, I'm not quite certain what figure that is, I know in Wiltshire it's much better than that in the thirties and forties. But nationally the clear up rate has fallen under the Conservatives from forty-one percent to twenty six percent, and there is no excuse at all for a freeze on the number of police officers when we were promised an extra thousand. Ah, but you're going to be getting some extra police officers by taking them off er, paperwork, er you're gonna get two thousand three hundred I see in the press, well that as shown, that of course will be twenty three, but if anybody here thinks the Chief Constable's gonna produce twenty three new police officers through reductions in paperwork and through the other initiatives the Home Secretary has announced, well I don't believe them, and we shall have to wait and see. This council needs to take seriously crime prevention and crime detection and most of all fear of crime, and that's why it's become part of the policy committee's concern, and I think that's with the police committee's agreement, for years they've been trying to tell us to get involved in crime prevention, and from next year we're going to do that. Crime prevention is not just about retribution, about making the little buggers pay. It's about preventing crime, because people who are burgled would rather not have been burgled in the first place. Hear, hear. And of course the deterrents that we've had, over the years, when they they've been of the emotive and knee jerk sort, and I remember the short sharp shock for instance, under Whitelaw, they didn't work, because they weren't thought out, they were just to make them clap at the Tory party conference. To his credit, Lord Whitelaw having been forced to bring in the short sharp shock, dropped it when it was proved not to work. Everybody hopes that we've forgotten about that, but we haven't, and we're reminded of it because of the courage of Lord Whitelaw and his advanced age and ill health, getting on to the T V last week and saying the Home Secretary is wrong to nationalise the police. Hear, hear. In fact , Conservative opposition in the Lords is proving very important, and if Colonel is concerned about the future level of the police budget, why doesn't he do a bit more to stop this nationalisation of the police going through parliament at the moment, and I just want to quote the, the words of Conservative Chairman of the Sussex police authority, over the years from nineteen eighty-two to nineteen ninety-three, four of them, and the most senior of course, who led the Association of County Councils for the Conservatives. These ill judged proposals present a dangerous step towards a politicised national police force. They are irrelevant to the battle against crime, and the improved efficiency of the police service which we all support. I can't put it better than that. And finally, the criminal injuries compensation scheme, to cut the amounts paid to people who are victims of gang rape, to cut the amount paid to people who are victims of child abuse, that shows just how much the Home Secretary cares about the victims of crime, and his other measures show that he's far more concerned with his own career, with pleasing the Conservative party conference, and with trying to do anything, anything I mean he's brought in whatever it is, twenty-seven proposals, one or two of them are bound to work, if you throw enough stuff at the fan, some of it usually hits the target. But we've got to take the issue seriously. Mr is still moving a motion which refers to the party conference proposals which have now moved on to bills before the house. He might be more constructive if he cared to pick which items from that he agrees with, we might even find a measure of agreement on one or two of the issues, because they're not all rubbish. But I move my motion, and I ask for those in favour to please show I'm so sorry, Mr 's amendment. Those in favour of Mr 's please show Those against. That is lost. Those in favour of the substantive motion please show those against That is carried. adjourn for lunch and be back at two. Welcome back. Item twenty-one, regional representation on the European Union Committee of the Regions. I er, move the motions set down in the order paper and, does anybody else wish to speak on this? Those in favour please say aye. aye Those against. Oh, That is carried. That doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong. I don't think it's, I don't think it's an essential office motion, otherwise Cornwall would have done it by now. Item twenty- two one budget review sub-committee minutes, I move to receive the minutes from the budget sub-committee those in favour say aye. aye And against that is carried. Erm, twenty-two two the recommendations not yet dealt with, the first is the review of the County Farms estate, and I will move paragraph nine one, that is to say the recommendation of the property services sub-committee okay, here we are,which is a recommendation to this committee to adopt option one as set out in the submitted report namely to maintain the County Farms estate at around it's present size, and to manage it in accordance with the nineteen eighty-eight review of the estate. I will say in moving that, would I note that the property services, the property sub- committee I should say, is receiving a further report on recommendations on how to preserve the long-term viability of the estate, which I consider to be the right priority, erm, the long- term viability of the estate is essential for the value both as an estate and for the value of it er, to us should we need to dispose of any of it for development land in the future. Erm, Mr . Thank you chair. I wish to move an amendment which is erm, that we defer any decision on this until the property, the director of property services has made his report to the property sub- committee on the erm, future, stroke to the organisation, which is th , the subject of his next report to property sub- committee. Seconded. Yeah, I think that we need to look into more depth the issue of the County Farms estate, we agreed from the start it was something that could not be rushed, and we had to, the principle question that needed to be answered was that was there a viability for County Farms or role for County Farms in the nineteen nineties. I think that that question has been answered, and I think the role of the estate has been answered in the report put by Mr . But since the initial motion was put forward by the policy and resources committee the question of local government review has become more prominent within the minds of this council and other councils across the country, and I think that issue needs to be addressed before we make as a cou , a council our final decision on the County Farms estate. Can I just clarify then, how far do you imagine this being deferred, that is to say are you awaiting the outcome of the local government commission report No , I do believe that Mr 's report is coming to the March property er, sub-committee and then it will be the subsequent meeting of the policy and resources committee which will be at the end of March. er, any debate discussion will be deferred until the report as described in nine one two has been reported to the property committee, this is a report to the next meeting recommendations on how to preserve the long-term viability of the estate. So what happens to the resolution that, woolly resolution that came from property at the bottom of the budget page four, resolved? To that's that's dropped, that's all deferred is it? Right, I'm the chairman of the meeting, so I'll try and tell you what I understand Mr has moved. He's moved that this matter be deferred. He's made reference, in his mov motion, to a report coming to the next property services sub-committee, and I recognise that report as referred to in nine two of these minutes of budget review sub-committee. Erm, and I understand that to be the position. Any other report, erm, such as to request the director of property services fully to explore all options for the disposal of all or any part of the County Farms estate for the maximum financial benefit to the County Council, that sort of report for instance has not been requested by the property sub- committee nor by any other committee with erm, er, as I understand it. According to Mr 's motion. Right, Mr . Yes Chairman, we we did have this debate in er budget review as I remember it. Erm, if we are asking Mr to look at the long-term viability and the ways of preserving that, those options may be other than option one which was what you moved, and I think it's rather premature to actually go down a road that says we preserve it in it's present form with some disposals, when, we are asking for a report for it's future viability, which may mean complete disposal, or may not, and I think, that, that's why I've seconded Mr 's amendment, because it's right we should wait for that that report to come to property, know the full facts, and then we can make a decision as to which option we want for the County Farms estate. So it's only a matter of two months and than I think we can make a long-term decision, not the short-term. I there is a worry of course, that, er County Farms if we happen to end up in three unitary authorities, could be said to be not a core activity of those three new authorities, especially the core of an urban one, and it may be that if we're not careful the County Farm estate can end up in the hands of the residuary body for sale, and I think what we're looking, asking Mr to do, is to find ways of, of moving it forward, without ha falling into that net, which may not be what we want. Mr . Thank you Mr Chairman. I'm just a little bit concerned that if we do delay it while discussions are going on about the unitary authorities and such like, we'll put restrictions on Mr running it as a commercial enterprise, and I think we have got to make sure that any long term deferral on this, we don't inhibit him rationalising selling off the odd cottage and this sort of thing, and the farmhouse as we go along, and amalgamating ones because I think it's, he's got to be able to run it as a commercial proposition during the course of deliberations. Mr . Yes, Chair, I'd be very sad if, if anything that was passed here meant that Mr wasn't fully exploring all avenues as described in the terms of resolution passed through budget revue. And I take this opportunity to say that, erm, I had, I moved this at budget revue, and my intention was to move erm, pretty much the wording that Mr moved at property, but I was unable to obtain that wording by the time of the meeting, so I put this forward, erm, knowing that it obviously was different words, but but with that same sense, that we do have to address some very real issues about County Farms and not to pussyfoot about it I think that er, any comparison between the County Farms and a commercial enterprise is a coincidence of terms, but I can't see how we can have forty million pounds worth of estate, as it's valued on the free market, to be making two hundred and ninety-one thousand pounds a year out of it, and think that that is commercial. I can't see how we've had a revue in nineteen eighty-eight which has recommended a very specific course of action, none of which appears to have been implemented, I don't see how we get a report which describes er, the intention of the county council as maintaining the ethos of the County Farms, whatever that is, as I, I don't recall any decisions like that, and certainly if we've made one, I'd be interested in being party to changing it, I think wha what we have to say is we've got a lot of land, are we using it to the best interest of the people of Wiltshire, and that is one thing it's addressing, not a, a way of preserving the County Estates as they are, not a way of keeping a hundred and twenty farmers and their families erm, as tenants of Wiltshire, I mean they're not gonna be out of jobs are they? I think there are many purposes that the County Farms should have, and we need to look at what is the best value financially, that we can obtain for the people of Wiltshire, so when everybody talks about they'd like their country schools maintained, they'd like this that or the other bought, they'd like Corsham station purchased, we could buy it easily if we sold a County Farm couldn't we? And the only thing that seems to stand in the way of doing anything commercially sensible with County Farms is that every time we deal with it, somebody says, ah, but it can only exist as an entity, let's keep it as that, let's pass it on to a trust, let's safeguard it, let's do this and that. Well I'd like to see a very open report, and that's why I Mr , and I'd like him to look at all the options, we're deferring this so that we can see what's possible, you know,, perhaps Hanson Trust would like to come along and offer us fifty million pounds for it, that'd be a fair deal wouldn't it, perhaps somebody else would do that. Perhaps erm, the Duchy of Cornwall would like to take back the land that we rent from them, in order that we can rent it on, lease, well we lease, I mean, same thing isn't it? Erm, we rent land from the Duchy of Cornwall, perhaps, er well you know long leasehold, we bought it this way, and we pay low rent. There are things around this, that I wonder what on earth we're doing and what is the best way forward and I would like to see that kind of report come back to us. And the reason I say it, and the reason I labour the point, is that I think amongst the problems that we've encountered particularly in budget review is to have chief officers and their staff producing reports in which they have a very clear vested interest. Not least in their own jobs. And I think it is a great pity, that this council is losing some of it's capacity to produce reports which are independent of the departments which are the most affected by them. I think the great sadness of the report coming forward on County Farms is that it's no doubt going to be produced by Mr , a further report, and erm, what, what can we say if he comes forward saying it's a wonderful institution and he wants to keep his job running it. Am I going to say oh, I think that's a very fair, free, independent thinking view. It may be it may not. I think that I would like those considerations borne in mind by Mr when he's doing his report, and I'd like us to have a very open view about what we do with the County Farms. Well I'm going to disagree with Mr on a number of issues. He does seem to suggest, that if you're directly interested or if you have a direct interest in something you can't take an objective view, and I would say that actually,members have shown their ability to erm, to achieve something different from that, the way they wear different hats at different committees, Mr comes to mind where he will argue for the D S O's, at the D S O managing board, and for the client at Education Committee. And I actually think it is coming close to a professional slur on Mr to suggest that he can't take an independent view. And what leads me to that conclusion is the distortion that Mr brought in, in suggesting that the estate is worth forty million pounds. If you read the report at paragraph seventy, you'll see that it has an investment value in the region of eight million pounds, it's only worth forty million if you kill all the tenants overnight, which is rather drastic, vacant possession in other words. Now you might achieve vacant possession over a period of seven years. Vacant possession can't be er achieved er, er overnight, as you appreciate but if the Government's agricultural er land tenancy, hey don't keep interrupting. If the Government's agricultural land tenancy reform proposals go through, which I rather hope they do, it'll be a little while yet, we could well see a change in the security of tenure issue, which might make it easier to achieve er, vacancy and vacant possession. And it comes down to a basic difference of approach to this. Either you consider that the County Farms are playing a role set down by law and supported over the years of an, which no other authority and no other body in the country can provide, and which is a socially valuable role, and that is to provide the first step in farming, and clearly they do. Or you think that all they are is another piece of silver to flog off like Mrs Thatcher flogged off the nationalised industries. I don't consider, I don't consider that the severity of this county council's financial position justifies this, in the flog it off at all costs approach. Now, what Mr has moved is to defer the matter, and I'm in mind of to accept that. But I would make clear to Mr if he looks at the minutes of the budget review sub-committee, that the suggestion of the director of property services wastes his time fully exploring all options for the disposal of all or any part of the County Farms estate, for which he probably asks for a large amount of money, since it involves an enormous amount of wasted time, is not been agreed, it's a non-delegated item, it was a recommendation of this committee which has not been moved at this committee, and it was a most unfortunate and woolly form of words. What's been moved Hear hear . is to defer the matter pending the director of property services report which the property sub-committee properly called for at it's last meeting. I'm happy to accept that amendment, and I would put the motion, as amended, to the vote. Those in favour please show those against that is carried. Did you have a bad lunch chair? I had a lovely lunch I just thought I'd try and get my own way for once. Chairman in your haste to get your own way for once, I mean, I had my hand up for about ten minutes and I thought that er, er our friend on your right had appraised you of that, because I think that you gave just as much a distorted view of what the real problem is, as perhaps Mr did, and I think that the way you railroaded that one through does you no credit at all . Yeah,Ch cha chair, it is possible for Mr by moving a, another small but you know, perhaps relatively insignificant motion on, on this same item, as we've not moved to the next one, and I will, I will happily second it, in order to enable him to speak to it, erm, to actually express the views, and very valuable ones, which he does hold. He is actually one of the few amongst us, who is probably quite expert on these matters. He would, he would be worth listening to, I think. Chairman, is that to be the case. Chair, chair point of order, you don't, point of order you, Mr doesn't need to move an an amendment or anything else, you can still accept debate on any item on the agenda until you've called the next agenda item, irrespective of the motion on the table. I know you do Chair, you know what you're doing but I'm saying it's a waste of time us having to move one. Chairman, what a let down this is gonna be. You asked for it. For what it's worth, my opinion in property, and my opinion now, is that we need to retain if we can, a viable unit for County Farms. In other words, a unit which comprises several farms which is big enough for us to move tenants about, and big enough for us to retain a management structure. What we don't or shouldn't do, is to regard every County Farm as a sacred cow. There are opportunities for development in the Swindon front garden, in the Chippenham front garden, the Devizes front garden, wherever, and it is my belief that since this county council originally purchased those farms, and have since maintained them, that if there is going to be a development windfall, then that should accrue to this county council and not to Thamesdown or whoever else it happens to be. The, the problem is, that nobody will ever take, and I suppose it's possible that I don't take, a balanced view of this. Everybody's in their own camp, and it, it, it's only when you come to consider, and I mean my group is nowhere near behind me on this, because we have farmers who, who again think that anything to do with County Farms is sacrosanct. But until you consider the amount of money tied up in County Farms, and the return it gives us, and the, the subsidy if you like of so few people, and you think that school can't have toilets and things like that, then these should all go into the decision making melting pot, and this council should not blind itself to the various options that there could be, and in those circumstances Mr I think should be allowed to explore the possibilities of the market. In as much as, if we are suddenly told, divest yourselves of County Farms, then we will be in a much better position to make a balanced decision, and to maximise return from those County Farms if we had that information available. I do not myself think, that Mr ever produces a biased report on anything, and I would think that, erm, on reflection Mr may think that he overstepped the mark there, er I feel that we should, if we can, defer this in it's entirety, which also includes, the note at the bottom, that would allow Mr to go out and, and, and explore the possibilities. That's all he's gonna do, this council retains the final decision, and we wish to make that decision with the benefit of all the knowledge that is available. And if somehow or other the, the, the whole of that er, erm, number nine, including the can be deferred, and I believe it should be, then that is what I would wish to happen, I would wish Mr to continue to have the freedom to see what the options are for this county council. Right, now there's one, we've made a decision to defer consideration of this report, but because both Mr and Mrs had indicated they wanted to speak before I took the vote, I'm prepared to take the speeches, but I don't know that there's very much of a motion that can legally be moved. Mr Thank you Mr Chairman. Er, I moved the original motion, and the thinking at the time was, after a lot of discussion, that eight one as it appears on the agenda, to maintain the estate at around it's level was the correct decision. And then we added eight two, which asked the director to explore the long-term viability of the estate, now we made that, and I said so at the time, the answer to that could be either positive or negative. This left it to Mr , to come up with sufficient information to enable that decision to be made. Thank you. Mrs I excluded you from the speech after you asked the question Erm I hope two sentences, thank you Mr Chairman. One is, is really, I felt I should reply in support of Mr concerning some of Mr 's remarks. I don't know whether he's read the County Farms Estate report, but it was actually option two, was one of the proposals we had to consider, which was to was to dispose of about a third of the estate, reduce it from twelve thousand acres to nine thousand acres, which was actually rejected at erm, the property sub-committee by all parties, including Labour. Thank you Mr Chairman. Right, next item twenty two A, twenty two two B,commission application for additional funding. It's a recommendation from the budget review sub-committee at minute six. Er, I move to note the decision of the budget review sub-committee. Miss oh, Mrs . Thank you . I'd just like some clarification of what, what this resolution from budget review actually means. Does it mean that P and R today are actually supporting the establishment, establishment of those posts, and we are going to go and get the money, or what? Thank you. I, I, that, that is the answer's in the negative, we're not setting up those posts or funding them today, but they've enabled us, they've prompted us to carry out a revue, I think, I wasn't present at budget review it. Mr . In moving these matters from commissioning in grant A erm, to this committee, erm, even if Social Services had had the money available, if they would have still been moved to this committee. The purpose of that, or the reasoning behind f behind that, was that, over the last few years erm, this type of expenditure has been charged not to Social Services but to the section one three seven account. Which the treasury is responsible for, and this committee is responsible for. Erm, so that the, the purpose of bringing some of these corporate activities back into Policy and Resources where they can perhaps determine how that erm, is going to be managed in the future. And it was the reasoning behind the erm, the resolution at budget review. There's just one point I'd make on erm, the first one, regarding the, th, Wiltshire and Thamesdown Racial Equality Council. Erm, the director's report under statutory responsibilities, does say that under Race Relations act, local authorities have a duty, erm, it's a little bit stronger than that actually in the act. Well if I could have a bungalow the same as I' ve got now I wouldn't care. I'd be happy in a bungalow I be happy now. It's Cheltenham Gold Cup week, the highlight of the national hunt racing calendar. Our reporter Tim Musson is at Cheltenham with all the news of today's racing and doubtless some tips for tomorrow. Welcome to Cheltenham on the first day of the national hunt festival. You know when racing folk talk of the festival they describe it as three days of magic and madness, glory or grief. We'll be taking a look around the scene here in a few moments, but first let's see how the people and town of Cheltenham prepares for the biggest invasion of the year. Martin Dawes reports. Well it's Tuesday the fourteenth and the start of Cheltenham's three day hunt festival and just in case you hadn't heard, you can keep up to date with all of the latest racing news and results here on Severn Sound. Top trainer Martin Pipe will be fielding eighteen horses with champion jockey the Cotswolds' Peter Scudamore saddling two of them. Cheltenham prepares for its festival like a bride. It's a Cotswold marriage between sport and money where the organist flips and plays an Irish jig. It's a firm favourite with the racing set. A good place to be seen. Make sure you're noticed. The gathering hoards are a headache for the police. There's pick pockets about and thousands of cars. When you put those eleven thousand vehicles with the fourteen thousand or so vehicles that travel the roads around this course every day, that is a difficult problem. erm the roads are really not, not made to cope and so we have to try to get people coming in from different areas and different directions so that we don't get everybody on one road and nobody on another. Bet you wish they'd come earlier. I wish they would, yes. If only they would come an hour earlier, and erm spend erm a pleasant time in their cars erm on the car park having a picnic before they go in, they would save themselves an awful lot of, of, of hassle. Cheltenham festival is loved by the Irish. At their traditional headquarters for the duration, the going is already getting heavy. I'd sooner come to Cheltenham than to go to a holiday abroad. I mean, I think it's a fantastic meeting. We meet great people. English, Irish, Scots, Welsh, it doesn't matter. Come down here, we have a good time. We all mix up together, and we've erm, it's a fantastic meeting. Well basically it's the people, like we get on so well with the English over here and as they say back home the . The beer is cheaper, and erm the women are pretty over here as well. I hope the wife isn't watching tonight. Cheers. Each year it seems to get busier and busier. I'm not quite sure where the people come from, and where we're going to put them. What kind of people actually come? Are they your usual clientele? No, slightly different. I think one thinks of Cheltenham as refined ladies drinking tea and retired colonels. These are professional punters and professional drinkers. In that order I think. The crowds are here, the atmosphere's good. The only question-mark now is the weather. Today all roads have led to Cheltenham. Forty thousand people, eleven thousand cars and nearly five hundred coaches have piled in here to Prestbury. The first race was off at two fifteen but on race day Cheltenham is up and running at first light. The Irish have been so busy praying for the winners that they must have forgotten to ask for the right weather. At dawn it was grey clouds and rain over the racecourse, but there was no lie-in for the true racing fan. They huddled together on the gallops to watch and assess today's runners. Finding a winner is a science. Binoculars and the latest form forecast are compulsory. The first to rise on the racecourse were the chefs. The ovens were lit at five o'clock. Thirteen thousand meals take some cooking. On the menu are cold salmon, roast fillet of beef with béarnaise sauce, erm supreme of chicken with a crab and lobster sauce, things like that. Cheltenham has to cater for everyone from burger to banquet. This year eight tons of prime beef, four tons of fresh salmon and four tons of fresh strawberries will be gobbled up. To wash it down, fifteen thousand bottles of champagne, twenty five thousand bottles of wine, and a quarter of a million pints of beer. Whatever the weather Cheltenham always looks good. The local nurseryman was finishing off as most started their day. Ten thousand flowers and a hundred trees have grown overnight. The wintry weather rather spoiled the opening day's fashion parade. Too cold for frills and fancy dresses, more a time for furs. As race time approached, people poured in. The cars queued but the helicopters beat the jams. On budget day and in pouring rain, nobody had the blues, not even the bookies, as the favourites fell. The chance for a local winner came in the second race, the Arkle Challenge Trophy. David Nicholson from Condicote near Stow-on-the-Wold was saddling Waterloo Boy, with another local man, Richard Dunwoody in the driving seat. The race turned out to be a battle between Peter Scudamore on and Waterloo Boy, number thirteen. It was lucky for some as Dunwoody squeezed home a twenty to one winner. It was cheers all round in the winners' enclosure and for Nicholson, the man they call the Duke, it was time to feel like a king. Unbelievable, I mean I've always looked upon the horse as a nice horse not as the winner of an Arkle. And he did it the right way, he did it the hard way, always in the first two, always having a cut at and jump, jump, jump, you know. And some celebrations tonight? I always go berserk. You do anyway but we shall. In the big race, the champion hurdle, the favourite,was well beaten. The winner, a fifty to one outsider, Beech Road. One horse that stands proud and wins year in year out is old Arkle here. I wonder whether any of today's winners will ever be as famous. Tomorrow the highlight and the big race is the Queen Mother Champion Steeplechase. Her Majesty will be here to watch and present the trophy. Who will win? Why not join us again here at the Cheltenham festival on Central South tomorrow. Now, we continue our reports from John Kane and the army in Northern Ireland with the padre's tale. Not every regiment can boast having a padre. The Gloucesters are lucky. And the Reverend Steve Parcell is with them for their tour in Northern Ireland. Captain Parcell hasn't always been in the army. He used to be a vicar in Bournemouth and before he got the call he was a salesman. Eleven o'clock on a Sunday morning and the Reverend Steve Parcell is tending to his flock. as we look for his coming in glory, we celebrate with this bread and this cup his one perfect sacrifice. Accept Steve Parcell might look like any other vicar but to the Gloucesters he's Captain Parcell and a man of the cloth. I'm the padre chaplain with the Gloucesters here in Ballykelly. How can a man of the cloth equate being a padre with the army? I think very easily. I think that the first thing that one would have to say is that we work for the Ministry of Defence, and not the Ministry of War and therefore we are about defence, we're about the maintenance of peace, erm this you know maintaining of justice etc etc. If anything it's very easy for a padre to slip into that slot. He's a man that anyone can talk to. The soldiers can talk to. He's not directly in the chain of command. I mean, obviously we pride ourselves as officers on our man management. But on the other hand, a soldier wants someone who he can talk to in complete confidence and I think the padre fulfils this sort of, if you like, avuncular, presence in the battalion. My main job as I see it is that I'm the exactly the same as a vicar in a civilian parish. My job is for the spiritual welfare of the people in my charge. Let us therefore confess our sins in penitence and faith, firmly resolved to keep God's commandments and to live in love and peace with all men. The padre believes in getting about to see his flock. Today he's hitched a ride in a Wessex helicopter with a group of soldiers who are doing random vehicle checks. The padre goes with them as they leap out into a very boggy field. So, as he's an officer, does he carry weapons? Not at all, no padre in the British army is allowed to carry arms by the Geneva convention. So when a chaplain goes to war as he did for example in the Falklands, he goes with his men erm and he's erm not armed at all. The sea crashing on to the rocks by the Giant's Causeway is the only similarity for Steve Parcell with his last parish, Bournemouth. Striding over this beautiful coastline, it's hard to believe that Belfast and its atrocities is just an hour's drive away. So, can the padre of the Gloucesters offer any explanation why some of the Irish are hell bent in wanting to shatter the tranquillity of this land? Well of course that's not quite true. Most Irishmen are very proud of what they have here, of the Giant's Causeway and all along the Irish coastline. It's a very small minority of people who just feel they want to inflict their political will upon others. And how can you as a Christian perhaps forgive them? I think forgiveness is extremely difficult and I think you have to have something done against you to be able to forgive. I would find it extremely difficult to forgive somebody who killed deliberately a member of my family. The vast majority of people here, Catholics and Protestants, want to live together side by side. There are a lot of religious people in Ireland but there aren't perhaps so many Christians. Tomorrow night we bring you the army wife's tale. Now, if you were out and about at about ten o'clock last night you may have seen a greenish glow in the sky. And you probably wondered what was on fire or were the spaceship had landed. But it wasn't anything calamitous or extra-terrestrial. It was actually the Northern Lights. Scientifically known as the aurora borealis, the lights, as their name suggests are normally only seen in very northern areas. The photographs which show them at their most dramatic were taken in Alaska. Well, Dr Jim Crawford, you've written a thesis on the subject of the Northern Lights. Is it very unusual to see them down here? This far south, yes. Very unusual. The display we've seen over the last night would have been quite average for Scotland and Northern Ireland but this far south in Oxford it was quite spectacular. Why did it happen? Well, the aurora's caused when particles from the sun interact with the magnetic field of the earth and are deposited into the atmosphere and they bombard the atmospheric gases and cause them to glow. So for experts like you, is it something you could have expected last night? erm for people who are getting information from various centres, yes, they would have known erm quite a long time in advance. But for the man in the street of course or anything doesn't give you any such a look ahead information. Well now, you're an expert, on the Northern Lights, but you live in Oxford. How often have you actually seen them yourself. Well, I always look north on a dark night and I think that twice in the last twelve years. And this was a good example? This was and excellent example. Well now, a lot of people will have missed them and heard a lot about them today, is there any chance at all that they'll appear again tonight? Well it's raining tonight, but if they keep a good look out over the next year, because the sun's particularly active now, then they may get a chance of seeing another display. Right, but that that may have been a once in a lifetime thing. Those who saw it were very lucky. Thank you very much indeed. Well, there's little chance of a sight of the Northern Lights again tonight because there's a lot of cloud about. When we run the satellite sequence, you can see all the cloud that moved in from the west overnight and the good news is that the back edge is not too far away. So, that cloud will move out of the way but yet another lump of thick cloud is just appearing on the left of the screen to pose more problems for tomorrow. This evening's heavy rain will clear away with the winds dying but it will stay pretty cloudy with the odd shower. Not too cold though, with the temperature down to four or five Celsius, that's about forty Fahrenheit. Still plenty of cloud tomorrow morning, with a chance of a shower but a little bit of sunshine. There'll be thicker cloud moving in from the south west. And that looks like bringing rain along for the afternoon. There won't be much wind but it will be cool with a temperature near eight Celsius, forty six Fahrenheit, and possibly cold enough for some sleet on the Cotswolds. Well, the Chancellor's budget was fairly low-key in general but there were significant changes aimed at helping the labour shortage in the region. Yesterday on Central News we met Graham Cooper, the managing director of a major printing company in Wantage, and one of the employees, Vic Marshall. Well, today's budget means that Graham will be around six pounds a month better off. Vic, however, will be better off by about twenty pounds a month. With me now to discuss what the budget means for more people in our area is Paul Sampson from Deloitt Hawkins and Sells. Paul, erm, are there any specific advantages to this sort of area? Well, as you said, the area got problems with labour, shortages of labour and the Chancellor has done something to help that. In particular he's helped with the National Insurance and what we can the income trap or poverty trap. At the lower end of the scale for unskilled labour there is now an incentive for those people to do more part-time work. Also pensioners, there's now more of an incentive for them to come back on to the labour market. So, that's at the unskilled end. At the skilled end, people who have more experience, he's done a lot to help erm companies give shares to their employees and companies that are prepared to be innovative erm there's quite a lot in this erm for them. Mr Sampson, thank you very much indeed. okay. And if you've just come in, here are the main headlines from the budget. The basic and forty percent income tax rates remain unchanged. Road taxes for car drivers are also unchanged. But the tax on company cars goes up by a third. Corporation tax remains unchanged at thirty five percent. Unleaded petrol will be fourteen pence cheaper per gallon than leaded. The tax on two and three star petrol comes into line with four star. There will be no change in taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. Income tax thresholds and allowances go up by six point eight per cent. The single person's allowance goes up by a hundred and eighty pounds. The married man's goes up by two hundred and eighty pounds. Age allowances go up taking sixteen thousand senior citizens out of the tax bracket altogether. Duty on life assurance policies is to abolished from the beginning of next year. And that's it. Well leave you now to go home, or stay at home and sort that all out for yourself and try and work out how it affects you. That's all from us. We'll be back tomorrow of course with more news from Cheltenham Gold Cup and with our second, third report from John Kane in Ireland. Goodnight. Goodnight. Licence to sell. Rover's big drive to convert sterling to dollars. A mother's campaign to prevent more road accident. And a fence too high. An MP is judged to be over the limit Good evening. The Rover car group which employs more than twelve thousand people in the Central South region, has announced its best results in ten years. But the company said tonight there'd be no reprieve for Cowley's South Works. It's still due to close in the nineteen nineties. The company, which is now owned by British Aerospace has made a spectacular recovery from the heavy losses of the mid-eighties to announce pre-tax profits of sixty five million pounds last year. That's a rise of two hundred and thirty three percent of the nineteen eighty six figure. This report from Kim Barnes. The Rover Group's success, largely due to the high-tech Cowley-made Rover has contributed to heavy profits for its new parent, British Aerospace. The astonishing pre-tax profit of sixty five million pounds is the best in ten years. The Group says, production, home sales and exports have all been outstanding for Austin Rover and Landrover vehicles. They've now got the quality right, they've got good models and it' a very good sales and marketing strategy. I mean if you go round the motorways, every other car is a Rover car. So, it's all coming good. World-wide sales are dramatically up at five hundred and twenty five thousand units, the highest in ten years. At their lowest in nineteen eighty one sales dropped to four hundred and thirty five thousand. The Group says the results are due to better business strategies over the last three years, new models, better use of plant and good labour relations. But the plan announced last year to close the South Works at Cowley in the nineteen nineties will not be withdrawn. In the light of this, reaction at the plant to today's figures was mixed. I don't think anybody's taking much notice of it. disgraceful. It just a joke. It's much more improved. Obviously you've look as though you've got more of a future, hopefully. But parents, British Aerospace, say no change of heart. The new technology requires less space really. And as a result of that we really have got overcapacity which we've declared publicly so, you know, we're not saying anything different today than what we said when we first purchased the business in July and August. It doesn't seem at this moment in time that a reprieve is really on the cards. The South Works employs fifteen hundred. The company said today that the number of redundancies isn't yet known. The successful Rover eight hundred range will be made at Cowley's North Works. Meanwhile, hopes are high that plants at Cowley and Swindon will benefit from links with Honda which the company says it will build on. Part of the reason for the Rover Group's success is its record on exports. But far from resting on its laurels the company now plans to make major inroads in the American market. It's about to launch a Hollywood-style marketing campaign costing millions of pounds. Wesley Smith has been to the company's American headquarters to compile this special report. Austin Cars in North America are thirty million pounds into advertising over the next few month. They've even bought the rights to the James Bond theme for T V advertising. The company imported eight thousand nine hundred cars in the eight hundred range from Britain to the States last year. But they the Prestige Sterling as it's known over here could have been more successful. The Group brought in a new President at its Miami headquarter to coincide with a massive publicity launch. One thing really is erm absolutely essential is that you do have a consistent and uniform marketing plan. One of the problems that we've suffered from in the past was some level of inconsistency which we've now put to bed. We've researched our forward marketing platform over the last seven months. We've it, researched it and what we've found is that there is a niche for the best of British. The cars are built in Cowley and sell at up to fifteen thousand pounds each. They used to be marketed jointly by Rover and a company called Brayman who own sixty percent of Rover's American outfit. Rover bought Brayman's shares so that they could have total control. They claim their new car, launched this month, the eight two seven, is the answer to winning over the Americans who were unimpressed by problems with service and with getting spare parts for the original eight two five launched two years ago. The new car comes in a basic or super luxury version. There are also seven hundred and fifty limited edition cars. There are three hundred improvements on the old eight two five. They include a two point seven litre engine and a new transmission. Rover have faced very tough competition from other European manufacturers like B M W which can be seen for sale alongside the Sterling in some areas. There are also scores of other companies, especially American and Japanese who are pointing to the dollars. Basically, erm it is a very demanding market. It's very competitive. There's a lot of erm different manufacturers over here. Also, it's not just one market, essentially you have to treat it as fifty, fifty one markets. Each individual state requiring different things under state and federal law. The typical American buyer will live in an area which the advertising world calls the American smile which stretches from New York via Florida and Texas to California. The Sterlings are aimed at middle aged male high wage earners who are willing to pay for the status the British luxury car can bring. We've got to deliver the right product, a good quality product. And they're not forgiving from that point of view. It's got to be competitively priced, you've got to market it well and you've got to position it well, and then you've got to service it well. We've learned a few hard lessons in this market. It teaches you a lot of hard lessons but erm if you recognize those and build on them erm then you can succeed in this market place. A Gloucestershire man has appeared in court charged with murdering his wife. Thirty two year old Richard Schofield from Prestbury remained in silence throughout the short hearing at Cheltenham magistrates court. The prosecuting solicitor applied for Mr Schofield, described as a departmental manager, to be remanded in custody. No application was made for bail. Mr Schofield was arrested on Tuesday after walking into a police station in London. As a result of what he told the police, his wife Caroline's body was found in their home in The Burgage in Prestbury. She had been strangled. Schofield was remanded in custody until April the fourth. A woman has begun a lone traffic patrol in her village after her best friend was killed and her son badly injured. She's warning that more lives will be lost because cars and lorries are racing through the main street at up to eighty miles an hour. Simon Harris reports. Lesley Taylor isn't a natural protester. As a mother of two she has more than enough to do without standing around. But Lesley has seen two of her friends killed. Both lives claimed by the A 48 at Ulvington near Lidney in Gloucestershire. A main road where there are no street lights and no pedestrian crossing. Just a forty mile an hour speed limit. Well, I've been complaining about this for about three years now and the county council continues to think the forty mile an hour speed limit is perfectly alright. But as I said, they haven't lost anybody. Isn't forty miles okay? Yes, if they went forty miles an hour, but they don't. I mean they're going at seventy and eighty miles an hour. Hazel Guest was Lesley's best friend and the mother of five children. Now she's dead. Her husband John is still trying to come to terms with what happened three years ago. We were both crossing the road from the public house and erm had the wife by my side and I didn't see it What affect has it had on your family and your life. Lesley Taylor's son David is one of the luckier victims of the A 48. He survived being knocked over, but only just after fracturing his skull and breaking a leg. You're obviously more cautious than you were before, and erm a lot of kids now they tend to stand back for a while just in case 'cause you can never judge how fast they're really going to go through there. Lesley Taylor is prepared to brave any weather to make her point. With like at stake, she doesn't think it's asking too much for a reduced speed limit, crossing and street lights. So far Gloucester County Council has said it will investigate the points she makes. In the meantime she fears it won't be long before Ulvington is again in mourning. In one of the biggest about turns in city politics, six thousand council house tenants have been told that their rents won't after all be going up by forty five per cent, and their homes won't be sold to a private landlord. Tim Hurst reports. Gloucester City Council reversed its most radical decisions on council housing at a marathon session dominated by the casting vote of a solitary independent councillor. The Tories lost control of the council when they lost the by-election, and last night they lost their housing hopes. Rents will go up by almost ten percent instead of forty five, and houses themselves won't be sold to a housing association. I'm very pleased about it, definitely very pleased. I'm glad it's all, you know, we've won. we've finally won and got what we wanted. We can all just about afford ten percent, but not forty five percent. Would you have voted in favour of the sale of the house if you'd been given the chance. No, definitely not. We don't want our houses sold off, do we? We want council to keep them. And rents are going up terribly. People just can't afford it. It's a bit too much, forty five per cent. But you can manage just over nine percent? Yes. Just. The Conservative plans for housing were beaten by a coalition between Labour, Democrats and the independent who now has the casting vote on all council business. The Tories say they're philosophical but not angry. Anger doesn't get you anywhere in this world. erm disappointed, but as I said at the beginning it was almost inevitable, erm with the results of the Westgate by-election, which were very disappointing. erm I don't deny that for one moment. erm no doubt there'll be lots of inquests as to why and what and everything else but we did lose that and we lost it badly and from then onwards the outcome was pretty inevitable bearing in mind the erm views of the independent. Rates in Gloucester were due to fall under the Tories. Now they're going to be pegged at last year's level. No great hardship according to Labour. Quite clearly what it meant to the average rate payer was seven pound a year. That's what a rate reduction meant in real terms and that had to be weighed against the vicious cuts which were being posed in order to achieve it. Protesters at last night's meeting fighting to save the city's law centre were also successful. The centre's hundred and ten thousand pound grant will continue in spite of Tory opposition. Swindon's Conservative MP says he's feeling got a because planners on the local council have discovered his new garden fence doesn't have planning permission. Thamesdown council is Labour controlled. MP Simon Coombes says he's suspicious the issue's surfaced now seven months after the fence went up. Martin Dawes reports. The new fence is just eight centimetres higher than the previous one. That was rotten, now Mr Coombes feels there's something rotten about how it's been picked up by the planners. He's a Tory who's criticized Thamesdown council over its finances and about statues they've approved around the borough. He described them as quite unbelievably unattractive. Not wishing to come down on either side, the planners say it's a nice fence but high fences near roads need permission. We have a very record in Thamesdown of treating every application on its merits. And what we will do here is give a erm totally objective analysis of what the fence is. It is erm on a highway and we have to be very sensitive to the erm not treating anybody whether erm it be a member of parliament or a councillor in anyway which would not to the authorities. The MP says his suspicions are aroused because he's recently in the Commons criticised Thamesdown's finances. Is this a witch-hunt? Well it certainly isn't a witch-hunt. And I would think it's perhaps rather foolish of Mr Coombes to actually raise this issue. erm With regard to the finances of course that is a totally different issue and record on financing. Mr Coombes isn't at home but says if there's a technical breach he'll apply for permission. Thamesdown say there shouldn't be any problem. A fifty bed cottage hospital is under threat as G Ps have been told to spend more time in their surgeries. They say they may have to stop working at the hospital and it can't survive without them. Simon Harris reports. With a busy practice at his surgery at Stroud in Gloucestershire, Dr Gordon Horner finds himself working a fifty hour week. Not that he complains, most G Ps earn over thirty thousand pounds a year. But despite his workload he still manages to spend two afternoons a week at Stroud's cottage hospital. Without G Ps like Dr Horner, the fifty bed hospital would grind to a halt. It has no full time consultants and now the G Ps are warning they may be forced to give up the hospital work because the Department of Health is planning to put them all on new contracts from next year. The proposed new contract for general practice is trying to force general practitioners to spend far more time sitting in the surgery waiting to consult with patients. It would, for most G Ps, mean several more hours a week in the surgery and that time has to come from somewhere. In Stroud it has to come from hospital time. The role of the visiting G Ps at Stroud isn't underestimated by the full time staff. There are patients here looked after by their own G Ps especially on the medical side and of course they know their G Ps. The G Ps know them and their backgrounds and their relatives can come. But it's more than just a question of who the patients prefer to be treated by. If there aren't the doctors to run it, it's not much of a hospital. Stroud has a potential seventy thousand patients in its catchment area. If the hospital closed, most would have to travel to Gloucester. erm it's a terrible thing to do. ' these people that use it. Well it's very close to us, it's very convenient. It's a nice friendly hospital. erm James was born here and it's it's just very convenient. I just don't want it to close. Temporary classrooms are being built at two schools in Stroud for children who at the moment don't have a school. They'll provide places for nearly three hundred pupils whose classrooms were destroyed by fire. The first rooms are being installed at Green School. Others will go onto land at Primary School destroyed by fire last week. Two men are awaiting trial accused of arson. Elizabethan musicians and dancers have been taking to the streets to publicise a meeting between queens from the sixteenth and twentieth century this weekend. The Oxford story is a heritage project which tells the story of the University through the ages. Oxford's Lord Mayor, Queenie Warley will travel through time to meet Queen Elizabeth the First accompanied by the dancers and musicians. Now, Harwell laboratory is best known for its contribution to nuclear research but the scientist there have revealed a secret life. They're keen bird-watchers and their best sightings have been from the laboratory windows which overlook very special conservation areas. Nuclear physicist Mike Wilkins gets a breath of fresh air in his lunch hour and scans the tree tops for the latest arrivals. He's a keen bird watcher and can indulge his hobby anywhere on the seven hundred acre site. There are over three thousand mature trees within the five mile perimeter fence and they are literally the only trees for miles around. Large scale farming has ripped out hedges and woods to make way for arable crops, leaving Harwell as an oasis in the middle of the fields. I think it's rather an island in in the middle of the ermerm cultivated land so if you stand on top of the Ridgeway and look down you can see the Harwell site standing out as a a green treed area erm compared with the corn all round it. And how important is that for the birds of the area. I think it's very important. The largest rookery in Oxfordshire dominates a high security storage area, and owls are moving into nesting boxes around the sight. The perimeter fence keeps out predators and limits the spread of chemicals the farmers use on the surrounding area. Now Harwell has decided to help nature along with an active policy of land management for wildlife. Grass, which used to be mown, is left to revert to meadow, and native trees planted between the nuclear reactors and the accelerators. Growing schemes take account of the seeding of wild flowers. These rare bee orchids will look like this in the summer. Head groundsman Ted Neville has relished the challenge of working for wildlife. Well, we're gardeners obviously trained to provide a nice working environment. But erm along with that I'm a naturalist and erm the place is big enough, we can we have scope for leaving area to revert to nature, which we're tying to do. But while Harwell's bird-watching boffins revel in the habitat around them there's just one snag. Because it's a high security area, they're not allowed to use binoculars. Good thing there were no restrictions at Cheltenham race-course because today all roads have led to the race-course. There thousands of people have led into the gates of Prestbury Park. Joining us from there with the story of today's action is Tim Russell. Welcome to Cheltenham on day two of the national hunt festival. It takes a year to organize this grand event and it says something for the racecourse when the only thing that went wrong yesterday was the weather. Today I'm glad to say it's been dry and we've even seen the sun. Today we've had great racing again and first we're going to have a look again at the world away from the races. radio. You've found us on 1584 kilohertz that's 189 metres in the medium wave band. We're broadcasting to you between ten and twelve every day this week, Thursday erm being our final day of course. Gold Cup day tomorrow. erm today the feature race is the Queen Mother Champion chase at This is the other Cheltenham complete with its own radio station. Alongside the last jump stands the largest tented village for any annual sporting event in this country. The racing festival is now bigger business than Wimbledon or the Open golf championship. And here hospitality is the name of the game. You can dine in comfort and watch in luxury. The who's who of the business world is in town this week and many a deal will be struck between races. Chris Coley from Cheltenham is one of the main organizers of this part of the festival. The caterers told me yesterday that they've got thirty thousand people being wined and dined here in this tented village over the three days. And at nine thousand today with tomorrow being the big day. So tell me, how much does it cost somebody to come, a businessman to bring a party or On average the cost here would be, in this particular marquee, it's a hundred and ten pounds a head for a party for the three days, and that's exclusive of drink. Apart from the hospitality tent the festival has its own shopping arcade. What can you buy? All the kit you need for a day at the races. Hats are part of the uniform here. For the real enthusiast there's riding equipment and for those who are happier watching from the grandstand a pair of binoculars. A for those lucky ones that hit the jackpot at the festival there's plenty of goodies for him and her. There's quite a gala atmosphere at Cheltenham this year with one or two circus acts doing the rounds. The winner wins a lovely little mahogany table down there. No, I shan't be endeavouring to win it. sir? The arrival of the Queen Mother heralded the racing proper. And Her Majesty was in the parade ring to assess the runners and riders for the big race, the Queen Mother Champion Steeplechase. For Gloucester jockey Peter Scudamore a few moments of solitude and silence. Money was piling on for his mount . Could the champion jockey do it? In the first circuit he was leading the field and looking good. But as they came into the finish it was the seven to four favourite,, running home to victory. The best local winner of the day was former baker's roundsman Arthur Whiting from Dursley in Gloucestershire. His horse,Lad, won the first race. So, just one day to go but what a day. Tomorrow the glittering prize is on offer, the Cheltenham Tote Gold Cup. Can Desert Orchid the champion bring the house down and win. And can Gloucestershire champion jockey Peter Scudamore do it on ? Can the Condicote team of David Nicholson, Richard Dunwoody and last year's champion do it again? If you can't make it, join us for Central South tomorrow. Two hundred wives have gone to live in Northern Ireland to be with their husbands serving there with the Gloucestershire regiment. For the women it's not a pleasant posting. Certain areas of the province are out of bounds to service families because it's too risky. And their which are guarded round the clock. On day three of his reports from the province, John Kane tells the wife's tale. Being a soldier's wife here in Northern Ireland is definitely not glorious. The Gloucesters have brought with them over two hundred families and although they're not confined to barracks there's certain areas of the province which are definitely out of bounds. They live in an area which is heavily fortified, guarded by soldiers with armed weapons. For Sue Poole, whose husband Nick is a Sergeant, living here is somewhat different from the family's home town of Tewkesbury. She does her weekly shopping not in a huge supermarket but in the camp's NAAFI and in an effort to actually go out and meet people Sue has got herself a day job. Gloucesters, can I help you? erm Monday through to Friday, nine to five Basically we're a shop for the soldiers to buy erm clothing, any sort of items they need for everyday life in the army. Is it bad for the wives here. It is really yes. erm they feel isolated. erm they're frightened to go anywhere just in case something might happen. The Gloucesters are half way through their two year tour. Sometimes the soldiers can be away for up to five weeks at a time. Living in quite appalling cramped conditions often working up to eighteen hours day after day. So why did Sue and her three children come? I came to be with my husband. I didn't want two year's separation. But do you see him much? No. Most of the company wives don't see their husbands for about sixty five per cent of the year, which is actually a very long time when you're living in these sort of conditions. If they were living in England they could probably cope a lot better. But living here with all the dangers and the threat and everything else, it's very very hard for them. As two of the three Poole children return home from school, they pass the armed sentry, a grim reminder of the ever present threat of terrorism. But does their mother think they get a hard time at school from the locals? I think they do to a certain extent, but the teachers try and erm brush it away, they try and forget that they are soldiers' children and try and help them mix in with the civilian children. Is there rank in the wives? Yes. There is to a certain extent but it's, I think, I hope it's starting to die out now. I think there probably is, yes. I think it comes from below rather than from above. I think perhaps the younger wives feel she's a sergeant's wife, can I go and talk to her? Really? erm it certainly doesn't come from us. I mean would you have the C O's wife round for coffee? I would invite her. I don't know if she'd come, but I'd invite her. Have you been round there? No. I mean would you have a sergeant's wife round for coffee here? Yes, yes, quite happily. And I do. Would it be embarrassing for her if she invited you back? No, I don't think so. No, it certainly doesn't worry me, the rank structure at all. But I think it probably does worry some of the other wives. Well what all the wives do agree about living in their fortified compounds guarded round the clock is that the end of this tour can't come soon enough. Most are counting down the days. Tomorrow night the soldier's tale. Well, this morning's satellite picture shows clearly yesterday's nasty weather out there in the North Sea and as we run the sequence through the day you can see a lot of showers coming towards Scotland and there's some more threatening cloud coming across southern parts of England and Ireland. This should stay to the south of us though. Any showers will soon die out this evening as clearing skies with very light winds will lead to a widespread frost overnight. Some icy patches are likely on roads as temperatures drop as minus two Celsius, twenty eight Fahrenheit. So a cold sunny start tomorrow morning with only very thin cloud about. And there'll be a few showers coming along in the afternoon and there'll be plenty of sunshine about and it should feel reasonably pleasant with temperatures around nine Celsius, forty eight Fahrenheit. The Chancellor has rejected criticism from health groups who wanted cigarettes to go up in the budget. A Wiltshire vicar's three young daughters died in a fire at their home in Chilmark. It was probably caused by an electrical fault. An American diplomat has been expelled from Moscow. The Russians say he was spying. A Muslim school in Yorkshire has been refused state funding despite staff protests that Christian, Catholic and Jewish schools are funded. The FTSE index is down four point two at two thousand one hundred and twenty one point two, and the pound is worth one dollar, seventy two cents. Well special report on tonights programme from Wesley Smith, we erm have got also some other reports coming up later on in Central South from Wesley Smith in America. Of course tomorrow's Gold Cup day at Cheltenham and this time tomorrow we'll be back with the results and of course all the highlights. That's all from us for now. Goodnight. Roof-top confrontation as protestors try to save a hotel. The Mappa Mundi getting into millions but there's concern about a share plan. And the mile-high fuel club topping up over the North Sea. Good evening, first tonight demolition work on a Cotswold hotel has been halted after fighting broke out between building workers and demonstrators. Attempts are now being made to get protected status for the building. The hotel's owners are furious that they weren't told it may be listed. Simon Harris reports. The police were expecting a peaceful demonstration, the demolition contractors weren't expecting one at all. But when they arrived to start pulling down the George hotel at Nailsworth in Gloucestershire, they were confronted by two hundred angry protesters. The front door blocked, the men climbed onto the roof and then things got out of hand. The demonstrators knew something the demolition workers didn't. That the local council was attempting to get the building listed. For several minutes the rooftop scuffles continued. The police called for reinforcements but by then the workmen knew they were outnumbered and decided enough was enough. The police said to begin with they were powerless to intervene, until disorder broke out the only offence being committed was trespass. I was told as it's a generally responsible bunch of people and I'm afraid that erm today wasn't, in my view, a very responsible action to take. There's been an inn on the site for more than two hundred years, though the present George was only built in 1938, more than anything else it's a landmark. I think by the demonstration this morning that people are not prepared to see the building fall down and I think that, erm if necessary, people will do everything within their power to prevent the erm the contractors moving in. But the police say you are breaking the law in doing this. erm yes, obviously it has to be an individual decision on people's parts, how you know whether they feel they're prepared to do that. With calm restored the police and the protestors were left waiting. The next step is in the hands of the hotel's owners, a construction firm from Halesowen, which wants to build an old-peoples' home on the site. Eventually a senior official arrived for talks with the police, somewhat annoyed that he hadn't been told of the attempt to list the building. They're awaiting further information on the planning situation and until that is made clear we will suspend the demolition work today. Stroud District Council say they believe the hotel is of little architectural importance but they've agreed to see if it should be listed because of the public concern. They say they didn't tell the owners because it's their policy not to do so. It has been known for developers to move in virtually overnight to demolish a building once they find out attempts are being made to list it. Whether the hotel is spared from bulldozers should be known by Wednesday. For the moment the protestors have only won a temporary stay of execution. A lawyer says he is prepared to go to court to force an enquiry into the water contamination still affecting Swindon and South Oxfordshire. More than a hundred victims have now approached him for legal advice and doctors are still seeing new cases six weeks after chryptosporidium was first identified in the Farmoor reservoir. Martin Doors reports. Claims lawyer Leslie Perrin is wading through more than a hundred cases of people who say they've fallen victim to the virulent chryptosporidium bug and he believes that's just a small percentage of the number who could eventually seek damages. Doctors in Swindon alone have now seen two hundred and sixty cases, people like six year old Ian Humphries; he's suffered extreme stomach cramps and diarrhoea. He ended up on a drip in the Princess Margaret hospital. After the illness, Ian weighed just three stone. The people coming to see Leslie Perrin are angry. I think, for the future, people are very confused. They don't know when they're going to be able to drink their water without boiling it again. And they don't really know what the effects of what they've drunk is going to be. Looking back into the past, people are eager for an explanation to be given to them by Thames and I do think that people don't feel that's what they've had so far. You've had about a hundred people come to you, are you looking for damages? Ultimately I'm sure that's something that people will want. erm I have to say that people are just as interested in having a proper explanation brought out and one that's brought out from independent questioning of Thames's explanations. The bug was traced back to the Farmoor treatment works which only started supplying Swindon from last August. Thames Waters say the organism occurs naturally, the damages claim said a spokesman would be like suing nature and that, he said, was an interesting idea. Well, it's not one of those things in any other water area, as far as I know. As far as I know, the Farmoor system of water is the only area where a substantial problem with chryptosporidia has ever been erm experienced anywhere in the world. There's a lot to be done if cases are to be taken to court, but the last thing Thames Water will want during the run up to privatisation is a long, drawn out damages claim where the point at issue is the safety of the water in the tap. An all-party delegation of MPs from the area met transport minister Peter Bottomly to express their fears about traffic chaos around the new M 40 link. Their concern follows the announcement of a twelve month gap between the opening of the northern section and the completion of the remaining route, the Wendlebury to Waterstock section, was confirmed last week. The MPs talked of an impending disaster of total traffic chaos. They urged the department of transport to complete the motorway as a matter of urgency. They also asked for footpath improvements to protect pedestrians and other measures to minimize disruption. A spokesman for the department said they were studying the consultants' report on new signposting, highways improvements and restricted access to prevent motorists taking shortcuts through residential areas. Well, the M 40 extension from Oxford to Birmingham is supposed to solve most of the region's traffic problems. But now motoring organizations are warning that the congestion and traffic chaos will get much worse before it gets better. The AA says fourteen thousand extra drivers a day will be using the existing motorway and its link roads by 1991. That's when the final Oxford end of the new motorway, the Waterstock to Wendlebury section, opens. Many hundreds of Londoners have moved out into the central south region, opting for a cheaper home at the cost of the long journey to work. But do they realize just what they're letting themselves in for. Martin Graham- Scott joined a commuter who travels each day to London from his home in Long Crendon in Buckinghamshire. The distance is just over fifty miles but it can take him three hours to get there. Tim Clifton starts his day at six o'clock in the morning. With a quick breakfast and already with thoughts on the work ahead. Tim is the director of a London advertising agency, he commuters there each day on the M40 from his country home at Long Crendon in Buckinghamshire. He's been doing the journey for fifteen years because he says he loves living in the country. This morning he's on the road by six-thirty hoping to be at his desk an hour and fifteen minutes later, at seven forty five. The erm the first part of the erm the journey which I take every morning as you can see even on a nice spring morning fortunately, half past six, nothing on the roads. I can't promise it will be like that for the rest of the journey. London, here we come. Let's see what little mysteries we have. Having driven thirty miles and for fifty minutes, he is forced to slow down for the first time. The M 40 reduced to a crawl. Roadworks near Denim. We are now coming into a situation where at the end of the motorway the three lanes are now running into two purely because of the roadworks on the right of the Uxbridge roundabout. After twenty slow minutes he's clear. We're now beginning a fairly and relatively trouble-free run erm because there are now a series of under and over-passes until we get back to nearer London. But before long traffic clogs up again at Hanger Lane. It's now ten past eight, he's been on the road for an hour and forty minutes, increasingly late. No matter how much you speed up the entry into London at some point in time you are going to have to create a jam. I think what is going to happen here is that you're just going to get one mega-jam round about this region from about Hanger Lane onwards because there's nothing really you can do about it. Tim's destination is New Bond Street. He eventually gets there at eight forty-five. Two and a quarter hours after setting out. He admits he's already exhausted before starting a twelve hour working day. It's getting worse every Monday and conversely every Friday more and more is going out of London. And a full day's work ahead of you now. Yup, till about seven or eight o'clock tonight. And the same story tonight? And the same story tonight. Tim will be making his return journey in the next couple of hours. Tomorrow at six-thirty it starts all over again. The new city of Milton Keynes is to get its second aqueduct after a gap of one hundred and seventy-eight years. It will carry the Grand Union canal across a new stretch of road at Stonebridge, the concrete structure will cost Milton Keynes Development Corporation nearly two million pounds and should be finished by mid-1991. The first iron aqueduct was built at Wolverton in 1811. The supermarket firm, Gateway, is taking legal action against a Northampton firm which it alleges is selling fire-damaged Gateway foods. Thousands of pounds worth of tinned food was sold by loss adjusters after being damaged in a fire at the Gateway supermarket in Wheatley in Oxfordshire last month. Now some of the tins have been sold in Northampton still with Gateway labels. Gateway has issued a writ because a condition of sale was that all identification should be removed if the goods were resold. Fewer women in Britain return to work after having children than in other E E C countries. And one of the reasons is the shortage of state nurseries. A new survey by a firm called Nurseries at Work also says that with booming European trade, firms are having to consider providing child-care for working mothers. Oxfordshire County Council is trying to encourage companies to do just that. The company creche at Spencer's corsetry is a shining example of the work-place nursery. Mums pay fourteen pounds a week for their two to five year olds to be cared for by trained nursery nurses in a sunny room just next door to the main factory. Spencer's, who were established in 1927, now employ just over two hundred at their factory in Banbury. Eighty-five percent are women, all highly-skilled sewing machinists. It was in a desperate attempt to woo them back to work two years ago that Spencer's established its nursery. Our offices had expanded very rapidly from 1986 onwards and we had to increase our production capacity here and we were finding it very difficult to recruit trained sewing machinists. It is actually financial viable for the company? Oh, it's been extremely cost-effective, yes. erm we decided from the start that erm the mums who have their kids in the creche should make some contribution towards the costs; we're providing them with a benefit erm but the company picks up the major part of the bill erm but in terms of the output from the additional sewing machinists that we've got, it's very, very cost-effective, yes. With the prospect of increased trade after the lifting of common market restrictions in 1992, combined with labour shortages at home, British employers are having to re-assess their attitude to women with children. And in response to a growing shortage of skilled workers in Oxfordshire the county council recently held a seminar for employers to discuss child-care at work. We'll certainly be putting firms in touch with others so that they can learn quickly from other experiences as quite a network of firms grew up at the seminar. And also with our under-fives advisers, we will be seeing that specific advise is given. There's no financial help, however. Certainly working mums at Spencer's find arrangements there ideal. Before we had we bought a house and so I really had to come back to work because we needed my wages and erm the creche was just being brought out so I knew there was a chance of coming back. When I was ill or anything like that then your on hang cause they just come over, well they phone over, and off you go. The county can already boast eleven work-place nurseries. If attitudes change and, with the need to attract people back to work, they may have to, then company creches could soon be as common as canteens. Four hospitals in the central south area are to carry out a pilot study in running their own affairs, a first step towards opting out of the National Health Service. The Radcliffe Infirmary and the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, the Northampton General and Milton Keynes General are among fifty hospitals which will test out new government proposals for independent hospital management. The idea is to give consultants the chance to run their own departments and to be in charge of their own finances and staffing. It's being seen as a first step towards opting out of the N H S. Oxford Regional Health Authority is already one step ahead of the government. It's been running a similar pilot scheme at the Radcliffe Infirmary for the past eighteen months and says consultants are enthusiastic about the results. Well, in the studio tonight is Andrew Moss from the Oxford Health Authority. Andrew, how far exactly has the scheme which you've been running gone? Well, we've been going for, I should think, about eighteen months in hospitals in Oxford, looking at ways in which we can give better information to consultants to help them to be more in charge of their own destiny. I think I ought really to say that it's not something that's particularly associated with opting out, it's something we were already doing anyway as an aid to better management. And are you now going to take that any further or are you going as far as the government wants you to go as this stage? Well, what the mind that I get awfully frustrated. I find it I, I think this is going to be a very difficult one cos there's a lot very near the same shade but Yes Mm they are shaded How many pieces? How many pieces? One thousand five hundred. Summer's come! Summer's come! Well let's hope it stays! Yeah. It came about a month ago, didn't it? Although we shall be grumbling for water, shan't we? Yeah. Oh we've had plenty of water for the time being. Be grumbling for water. Oh I don't think so not for what they, what they, they want. No, no. I'm just not dedicated I'm afraid. I just let the garden go Well it's a, I'm afraid it's just getting So many other things to do! too much. I, I really jiggered myself this morning and I was only out about half an hour, you know, and I used to be able to do a full day! yeah. No you can't. and er there's enough to do at the front and the back . The front has got to be tidy I did a bit last night when I went out. Can't you put gravel in your front? I don't like gravel. Oh I don't mind! I think it looks quite nice. I've seen two of all these houses I walked round at Bridlington, I thought all the gravel looked quite nice, you know, with the odd plant and and things through the gravel. And er did you enjoy your tea yesterday with I didn't come because er I thought Yes! Yes! Thank you I might go back and get er, get me grass cut Yeah. They were silly little coffee cups that came round and and part of that is it's a long walk back from the It was, was a long walk, yes. I should imagine Yes. I mean you've such a long walk, haven't you, haven't you? So I thought right, I'm gonna give that Well I yes, I got a bit tired out because erm somebody mentioned table tennis and I said oh I've been wanting a game for years! I, I got sick of asking around and gave up Ooh! er somebody said well the, the table's, we'd been to French in the morning and I hadn't realized that the table's Yes, in the youth club. in the youth club Yes. and erm they'd sort of asked and said, you know, it's possible. So there are two tables there. So we were talking about this and Erm, no I'm what's her name Mrs erm was there, Margaret and she said oh I have a table! You can come round now and have a game. I said oh no, not then! She said well come and see, she said, and then any time any of you want a game come, I thought that was very sweet of her! Very nice! I mean we wouldn't want to keep traipsing through her house every time Where does she live? Er Land's Park Oh! just round the corner! Yes! So we went round then, oh that was lovely too and erm cos she made How many tea but I didn't stay how many er is interested in the table tennis? Well, there was about four of us. Mm cos I found I'd try, well the works had er, erm table and I, I remember the last time I played before I left and I said come on, I'll Mm. Not for me No. it's too energetic and too, you've got to have to, got an eye You've got to watch that ball. Yes, yes and it was always the picking up and the speed of it and so I thought well I, I Yes, oh Ah! so no don't say Yes that. Well no, it's frustrating because that's how I I make the best of it, but er I felt all these years that I Mm, mm hadn't had enough and now Yeah and erm well, of course, then somebody suggested oh what about Scottish country dancing? Cos the so erm I said oh, I'd love Scottish country dancing! You are going to get some bread, are you? she ever will do! I don't think she wants to go home! No! I got home and I felt that's it! If I can do table tennis and Scottish country dancing, nothing won't get me away from that. So I, I spent the night thinking oh dear, have I done the wrong thing now? But if anything comes of this table tennis and Scottish country dancing that'll be Well, it'll be nice if you get a club going at the youth club, because they won't use it in the morning That's right! not the early afternoons, will they? That's it! I'm, I'm coming to your house next month. Yeah It is a long way, isn't it? I don't think I shall be there next month! Well, you, aren't you doing some teas?

No! How much did she charge Thirty pence. Well it wasn't that much thirty pence, but I mean we, it was, well they'll have to buck up their ideas, But Joan won't they? yes, but Joan asked at the end, didn't she, if it would be possible for us to use that for history and they said yes Oh did she? as long as we just pay for the I see Oh! and I said to we could use it so Rather than go to the school?

Well I studied an art class in the school and it took me twenty five minutes to walk from my house. It is for you, yeah. It would do! Except we reckon half it's even further an hour when we're going to school. Yes! And most people had lifts yesterday to the French on the way up Yes, mm, oh yes. You could arrange a lift, but that's in case you can't get a lift, that's how long it takes you. It is a long way up to that school I know, when, you know by And then there's the int it?

Because exchange of contracts So what nineteen thousand paid? mm mm could prove difficult but how can you pay that much off?does if, I suppose if they I think we have, I think it's done as a, as part of a new mortgage I think. what's there to put, took an extra twenty thousand on from the beginning? So are nan and granddad totally for the idea and everything and moving now? Yeah say so. Er we going to have a look round the house one more time? No Richard, not before we exchange contracts and we actually move in I don't think. Why? Well we might do, might too, full contracts signed just to get some measurements. The measurements are already there No, not accurate we don't know the size of the windows and curtains do we? Ah, can you imagine trying to curtain that big room, the dining, the ballroom bit Drawing room Drawing room, whatever it's called, it's huge, it has windows all the way round, it has bow windows innit? No it's window er blind window with a bay window at the side. You have to keep the erm,, what's the name of the stuff? Er floor tiles down, wooden floor tiles. Not floor tiles, they're wooden flooring What do you mean wooden floor? Floor tiles. Not tiles So what are they? They're wood strip flooring Are they expensive? the actual flooring They expensive? Well If you polish those up we can keep them I'm going to so we're not having carpets down? no, rugs, large rugs Well, then, exactly that's not going to cost much is it? Er yeah, yes Cost less than carpets No Nigel looked, looked at er, er rug and it was erm sort of like ten by six and that was three hundred and fifty pounds Yeah, expensive, but you get that from work Not a lot of it it's not a great deal, hassle, but the garden's gonna look good when we've finished it, get in the straight first day in we'll hack down the back tree. Nanna wants to have all the er plants picked out of the greenhouse and erm have them all in the trays and up to us by the end of May before they go away on holiday. Where they going? Erm forgotten now, somewhere rural Spain Oh god you know it's not, not, it's not like Benidorm or anything like that it's it's somewhere like, it's about seven miles away from the sea, but as I said they Seven? Well they don't want to go to the sea, erm Ah they've got, they've got a swimming pool so that's all they need I suppose so and lots of nice walks around, things which How long are they going for? Dunno, about a week, ten days I think Yeah, that's not bad. but they want to go, bring all the trays of plants over A hundred, hundred odd before before they go, so, so the greenhouse is empty so all hundred odd? Oh, they have more than that I think. So in other words they're gonna bring its new place? Mm, well if we move, hopefully we wou would of moved by then. So how we gonna get hundred a hundred odd trays down to us? Have to hire a van? No, nan and granddad can bring one lot up and my mum and dad can fetch a few bits and then just keep bringing bits back, I mean Yes, I suppose so it's not that much of a bother, the pain is having to dig them all in that's the trouble Has he done loads this year? Well at least they haven't done as many as they did, they did last year but they, it looks a lot to me Oh, why haven't they done as many as last year? Probably because they had quite a lot left over and didn't They didn't, we used them all I know but we'll certainly be needing them this year, cos the garden's bare. Yes, we went round up to the manor house God it's expensive there I know, they've got some lovely things aquarium are Oh we didn't bother going in the aquarium Oh erm it's nice there was some really nice things, there was erm, some of those lovely erm variegated erm, what do you call them things? Plants Weeping figs , weeping, weeping figs, we had one at er Hertford Road and it died It died , oh that big thing we had outside? No, the one that was, no not that one, that, that's another nice one, but, no it's er, in the side of the erm Mm the fireplace, you know the, where the planter was I, I know the one yeah that one there and it died, mind you it didn't get enough light that was really why Probably cost a fortune all the plants at Ruxley, Ruxley is not a good place to go Oh there's some smashing things there though Yeah, but look at the prices though Well I know but it cos they, that's the only good garden centre around that's, that's why they cost so much No Pole Hill's nice No, it's not as big there we were gonna go down there, but erm nan and granddad had been down there about a fortnight ago and they said they hadn't got a lot out yet, they said they wouldn't be out for about another three weeks, so about Mm next week, but Ruxley had quite a few seeds out and erm, Nana was gonna buy some and then she said er, she, she'll leave it, she'll go down to Pole Hill first cos they said they'll be out and they're, cos they're slightly cheaper and then if they haven't got any next week then she'll go back up to Ruxley and get them there instead. She only saves a matter of fifteen P and gets it all back on the petrol Well, er, this year instead of sowing their tomato seeds right from, from seeds Well that's stupid she's not going to this year, she's erm, in Ruxley there, there was a little pot of seed that had been sowed and they were ready for pricking out, and er one little pot I think was ninety eight P, but there must of been fifty plants in there easily Yeah, but she had that many last time Well er I was gonna say we don't need, we she had five hundred sort of flowers don't need that many, whereas last year she had so many tomatoes and tomato plants, she didn't know what to do with them We don't even eat the damn stuff thank you, so erm she's going to erm she'll just pick out some of these then, erm watch it, the ones that she doesn't, the plants that she doesn't need she'll give to Dave, his erm school, his spring fair whatever you call it Oh, he always gets extra priorities doesn't he? Little David, her apple Oh yes in her eye No, she's, he's not the apple of her eye, at all. Did she miss me? Caroline apparently asked erm Nana if the boys were coming up Ha but Caroline's half term is not until the week after next Week after next? it's David's the next week and Caroline's the week after Oh cos she's only got about four weeks before, she goes back and erm Well she hasn't she's got different it must be three weeks since she exams time, date, I think we're having it the earliest of the lot, for some stupid reason because Mel doesn't appear to be having them till late either. Why when's hers? Her's is late May, they start You'll find quite a few of yours will be May No the majority of mine will be finished by May the twenty fourth I think, I think you're kidding yourself I'm not, it's only over a two week period, they're jammed in, I'm getting in several days, all I have is three exams I still think you'll find you'll have some in May No, no Well you'll have to wait and see won't you? No, not many at all but, yeah, that's ridiculous Caroline's down then But it means that she, she has a, a week's holiday and I think she's back for about three weeks and then breaks up again at school Mm er Easter, so and then she'll have I think three weeks Easter Mm and then I think she's back for, erm I think she gets back, she misses one Monday this Bank, Bank Holiday, that's, that's four days and then, she does, I think she's got another two, three weeks and I suppose she'll be, well she'll be doing GCSEs anyway Mm so she's hardly going to be there Mm it's a funny way of doing it really Well Mel, Mel's been er holiday is this week, next week coming Mm, got Dave's in next week? erm off today as well, so that's why, but that, that's I suppose is late as well Well erm quite a few of the London children were off Mm, there's a lot of people who've erm, I mean a lot of s all the T V companies are putting programmes on for next week Mm for people, kids being off, so it's obvious the rest of the country's off that week, and so it's probably only a few limited schools Dorset , Dorset always has the early is a pain in the arse, warm in here Mm innit? So er it's stupid well there you go, what's for dinner by the way? I haven't decided yet Mm, cos Morris is coming down isn't he?

What for? I can't just ring up and say hi two of my, well a friend and an acquaintance are doing this, this thing, can I do it? Let's face it we all do Well do it the same time because we're in the same class and speak to all the same people and we'd get all the same results So what, you get twenty five quid for it It's not a that's what I'm gonna do, stupid I reckon that you'll get mega bucks because you're I reckon you'll get mega bucks because you're a Oh god all that chronic jargon for you What for? This is the erm, the er, the, the choice of Don't mention the name of, of the, the no it's not, mum says you've got to fill in a form and say who's talked and how old we are and Yeah that's, that, but doesn't realize who it is when No Did you have to sign the Official Secrets Act? No My name is Tamsin Dad's not allowed to take it to work unfortunately so Why not? Cos he can affect some, all the stuff is secret ooh It's a pain it's the same with dad then isn't it? Do what? Dad couldn't take it because it's confidential Yeah, right Mm Ah Louise here comes the star of the show Hello The star of the show, the idiot of the place come in please then You're looking very smart No she don't she's right repulsive Richard just because the tape's on doesn't mean to say you've got to lie I wasn't lying Richard you're a liar Are you leaving all this mess I'm not leaving any mess I've not left any mess, don't look at me I'm not the messy one Mess Bye Chloe I've got to go mum Oh, I start doing a different language then chance will be a fine thing What? Mum can you get my I go never to return Are we off now dad? Off? Off? Absolutely Here Now then Richard, by the way tape this person no I didn't When they ring this erm these chats or whatever Yeah er quite a lot of the time we cause so much fuss the blokes are ringing here. Well dad that's the best way of doing it Well it's not because, because I object to the phone being taken out of commission for that length of time Oh yeah so yeah so do I, oh exactly I think that's downright rude And it is a problem and er, and er other people can't ring in, they just give up if they Yeah you, if you try once or twice fine, but you just give up. I must of tried probably fifteen times last night to get through. Well that's, that's just, just can't predict and, to have it going on time after time after time, it's bad, bad form for, for the phone, and the bill and all concerned Yeah but to me it's just, it's just slack behaviour as far as I'm concerned Yeah if you see each other several times during the day Exactly I think, then what on earth does he want to be on the phone for that length of time for. Oh I agree Okay if you want a private conversation well go and have a private conversation, but borrow, borrow the code of silence from or get smart or something Exactly, yes, true Mm oh yeah, yes, I agree, if for too long it does add up It gets up my nose I'm not altogether surprised, but I do it every now and again, I want a private conver conversation with one of the, one of my colleagues No question you're doing, exactly needed but I mean you I erm You have to it is your phone unfortunately that, that, tends to be therapeutic, I, whereas, well they've just got these, these business like these, these two silly blokes who erm You've got Jane as well What? Jane and Clare now is it? No Jane's not, but she well She speaks to her friends quite a lot they start to ring their friends up when they've just left them during the day, fine Well that is stupid if you want a bit of information, if you want to find out what page you're supposed to be doing your homework from or It's alright if it's a three minute call like you say Fine, I don't mind Yeah but it just goes on and on and on, over what did so and so said, oh no Yeah dear, dear exactly just natter and natter all the time I don't start doing it , I, well don't blame you, yeah. You see I get erm Well just downright rude I think it's ridiculous of Alistair but he, it is his business, you see, I'm gonna use the phone a hell of a lot when I get mine going, but I will But in that case if you're going to have that, then you've a right to have two lines in the house Exactly and use one as a business line Exactly and one as a pleasure line Exactly and that's what I'm gonna do, exactly if there's anything you can do Yep, I agree, exactly and that's the only way you can do it cos then you, you don't get any problems that the call's been er interacting Yes exactly, it's the only way you can do it and I wouldn't do it any other way, because I don't bel I don't, I don't think it's fair, if I was using the phone continually I'd get rather annoyed, I mean that I'd, they'd have a right to be annoyed, but as I don't I think it's ridiculous so I'm not hardly surprised at all, so I think it's stupid as you say, but there you go. Er perhaps put a pay phone in, but of course Oh, why don't you put a pay lock on? Well because er Mum and dad have threatened that regularly Well I mean the trouble is that Watch I went round,wha wha wha what's all this front seat driving? I would of seen it by the time I'd got to the next one Exactly , so what were you saying? You do er, what? I forgot what I say now, it's all this intense recording that's putting me off You were saying about the phone, you were, you were thinking about doing whatever I went to see a patient, a, a, a woman who's husband had died they're a pa a pain because you want to ring nine nine you've got to take the darn lock off, there's er trying to Yeah but would you need that? Why not keep the phones such as the main one downstairs and the other one as open, I mean as closed and have your own personal one upstairs, in your room or whatever well I, as I say I've got a, see I'm, you have this You've got to have a phone that, that's going to ring, ring through with the erm the patient, need to be on the er there, don't we? Yes, that's, that's the, that's the way to do it The only reason we've got several phones is that we, because if you don't, you don't hear them or why don't you have erm, get the girls to pay a percentage of the bill, get them to note down all the calls they make and work it out, that's a way of doing it What with? What do you mean what with? What with to pay with? Money Oh money oh you take it out their pocket money They don't get any Fine you take it out their bank accounts, you, that's the only way you can do it, we don't give them pocket money, that's the only way you can do it, That's the way that mum and dad With all these phone calls, we're out of pocket See we've got four phones in our house and it does add up Oh I believe we've got four phones in our house in operation Well the the system only takes four so we've got that and so I, er, I'm gonna have to, how much does it cost to put your own line in? Er, your own line in, I thought you weren't allowed to do that? I mean there's this line Oh I don't know this is all things I've got to consider when I'm starting this thing It'll cost a bit It's gonna cost me a fair bit to get lines to the house I want so I've got, er I, the problem is with, as dad was saying this morning, the majority of people when they're starting their business they go to the wall because oh they're going in for the, oh it's gonna be a quick sale Mm and we're gonna get quick turnover and we're gonna start making loads of money easily Yes, that does but you don't it all starts off very slowly Exactly and if, if you can break even in the first two years you're very lucky Yes and that's what I'm gonna be aiming to do, if it, if I break even in two years I'd be happy cos I've made money back and then I'll be making profit after that, and you won't make it back in the first year, no way Don't forget you're only putting, you're only part time, you're pushing to do your work hard Well mum will be doing, mum'll be the secretary and then I will have someone in to do it Oh I'm paying someone, I'll pay a Y T S guy to do it and that Oh so that's why I need this summer and part of er working during the week, week days to get money to pay for it Oh cos er, I, I'm selling the fish tank for a start, for a hundred What? I'm selling the fish tank to get some money Really? for er, I'm selling that for a hundred and thirty No so, yeah I'm getting rid of that to get some Mm I'm selling my, erm remote control car to get money You mean you're selling your fish tank, you can't sell a fish tank Mm, yeah, I'm selling a fish tank No Yep, to get rid of that Oh my god so that's going for a hundred and thirty pounds who's buying that then? Dunno I, there's a friend of mine and I'm selling it in the pa have to advertise in the paper as well so that money's going to it, I've made, I'm having a word with the bank manager for business facilities and then opening an account with him at the bank to er basically get some extra, a business account going which I don't touch, er I need to get credit facilities done on the bank, accounts and stuff, dad's gonna look through it completely with me and work everything out, but for the next six, seven weeks I'll be too busy with the school work to really concentrate on it, cos exams start at seven weeks time now Yes so I'm going to be very busy doing the evenings, doing my work. Absolutely. Well I don't know I'm gonna make this work, I'm not rushing into it, I'm, I rush into a lot of things I noticed that but I'm not rushing this time, cos I'm, if, I'm putting, I'm spending two and half thousand pounds on this, I'm not wasting my money Yes cos it's a lot of money to be perfectly honest Right, well we've recorded this for so long, can you use some bigger words now please? Bigger words? Yeah, you need bigger words if it's going into the dictionary Some bigger words, what kind of thing, er supercalologilistic Er yes it is really, it's a bit too long for me that one though Erm, protocol, that's a good one Only three syllable though Mm, er what to think, oh I can't think of any words, oh we're going to go off for an interview now anyway. Mm, looks very nice Yeah? Yeah, he's done a great job Will won't he? I like the bit where he's er wrapped the little bits all the way round Yeah, they're brilliant Well they were there only, they were there before you see Oh it looks very much mm snazzy now but er oh of course, I mean, er all and nice, clean and varnished, oh good Well he did varnish it, didn't he? Of course he did, yes So it's worth it for twenty quid innit? Twenty five Or twenty five It's good, yes So well excellent are you going to get all your like that? Well I don't need to like that. So he obviously thought it was worthwhile doing that Not really I just made him do it Well I liked it we gave him the bread and we did it Exactly, so he's a What? Sorry? It needs to be in the dictionary, bread Your definition of money of course, er, eh, well I suppose so, but well, there you go, so. No I think it's You send these people twenty five tips full of science, which I normally speak it's what I Oh well what they say then? I don't know, I suppose you've still got your voucher, I get the voucher next Friday, so What about it? They pay you to do it What in a week? Yes, a week You mean a week I've only got a week to do them Cor so I get paid twenty five not long is it? pounds for doing it Really? Yeah, it's not bad for a go. So where are these coming? Kent, I've dr erm I've written to them so he's gonna send back a erm How do you get this then? price list , well I'd of sent for them, they'll post them to me by Securicor What by post? Yes, it's only a, an hour Oh they post them straight or I'll go and collect them. They won't go through a letter box I'll be at home, idiot, or er, it's in Kent so I can get dad to pick them up for me That's true so I'll get, I'll get all the prices whatever, he's got like thirty six inch coin er Mm Japanese, it's a massive one, one er, it's a thirty thousand gallon erm pond and it's got, and it goes through a filter box and it's four and a half tons of erm four and a half tons and that is a lot of I should think it is, what is ? is the stuff that I've got in a little bag, got little bag full Oh yes and that's where the that you've got in your pond Oh that's how much four and a half ton of costs, just ever so slightly, it's more about Yes er, so it's a bit expensive Absolutely but erm, so I'll order them, I'll pay for them when I'm there you can pay back when when I get them You won't get them anyway Of course I'll get them there are, they don't sell Well why do you think they've advertised them? Yes, but they're going and then they've got them in the ponds, they've got them all in their ponds, so they're obviously okay, they're for ponds so it, I think if we probably get ten, fifteen on the, cos I'm gonna be so used to seeing them, cos I'm gonna be ordering those, I'll order all the carps and you've got as well Oh nice Yes so I'll get hold of some well, if you can get on with doing that thing, sit down and look through those magazines with me and I'll show you the prices that I can get them at retail I mean at trade, all the prices cos I've got that two and a half thousand gallon job and that is only seventy quid, so I'm just gonna have one of those, I'm gonna have that with a U V A filter and eight er eight watt U V A filter which is fifty quid, that then, which is for one of those tanks which is for three hundred and fifty, but that's not, I've that's Oh retail I haven't worked out trade yet. So that's basically lost about five hundred quid a set Oh thing and that's without a pump, so to set up it'll cost me probably a thousand and a bit and I want and then I'll need to have the rest of the money left over to survive Yes do it that way, but I'm not rushing into this, I'm doing it very, very slowly cos it ain't worth it with that much money To be perfectly honest. Seemed to be going down to south coast of the river Yeah he is isn't he? Wake up mate, get out the middle of the road. I've got sore wrists again today Well you shouldn't play tennis on, on er on squash probably it's probably been slapped pathetic, it's ridiculous I really do. You see, well, you know, I think the trouble is what do I say now? You tell them what you damn well think. I think it's absolutely, I think it's perfectly, thing is I think it's blooming awful I really do. You don't have to be careful, you obviously have to Yes you do watch their fees, but they haven't watched yours for crying out loud it's quite obviously, but I think it's, it's ridiculous, because you're looking at doing it that way, the other, it's ridiculous Well I mean the erm, I had some bins and all stuff, buy some bins and stuff for the office, she's ordered all sorts of things I, I had, I, I Yeah, but it's not gonna go back and get her blamed Well this is the trouble you see it's erm, it's, it's not fair. If she's gone without asking anybody then, anybody fine, then maybe, maybe reasonable to she's asked you but then again I don't know the ins and outs of the practice or but I just think it's unfair the way they're treating you. I, if I was you, I'd be extremely pissed, but then again I've got the temperament where I won't sit down and take something if I don't like it. Well I've made it not to if, if, if I, if I, if, if they'd ordered, been ordered on my say so, I have made an autonomous decision, well you, there's so many people in that place making autonomous bloody decisions, why shouldn't I do a few? Exactly Aha it's, it's, it's ridiculous I just think it's very unfair that they regard you that way. You go for these people and ask for a board and this sort of thing it's just, it just gets to be demeaning, the practice manager should have, should have within a reasonable area to order the things that she feels she wants for herself Mm I'd better go and warn her now I suppose Yes, it's only fair yes I would ah there you go, ah that's gonna ruin her weekend innit? But it sounds as those, those two probably have the same feelings as you do, when it comes to the crunch they don't make a note It's up to the wimps when it comes to the crunch Exactly, they know, exactly , so why the hell should you be quiet all the time? It's not fair if you said how, what you feel, then maybe they'll change it but they're not going to do anything without them knowing you, because they don't know them until you've told them do they? How can they change it if they don't know what you're feeling? But they probably do they're too bloody erm, insensitive to bother The problem here is, if, if, if, if, the, what's, what's happened is if, if that, if anything gets bought there in the practice, that then is taken out of our remunerations, so if we spend six hundred pounds on the stuff in the prac in, in, in the reception area Yeah that then means each partner is then a hundred pounds less for, less pay at the end of the month Right so then they're gonna quibble about it, do you understand that? Yes, oh yes There isn't so much for the expenses and so on, so, they're gonna sort of start grumbling Mm er, all I've got to do is to get ev every single part ev every single partner because they're a hundred pound less and then I then, I'm up a, up a creak aren't I then? Mm Curses, curses and heavens to done nothing today again, as usual We're not doing bad I've got all the bits and pieces I card off. And it's Eileen's anniversary as well today. Oh bugger Eileen!

You know, I told you that day Ju I saw Julie walking down top of Broadway? Mm. Her car had broke down. Oh oh! That's what I got now. They've just had it brought back from whatsername's?haven't they? Who? Who? Julie! Well they got a Sierra she's on about a Fiat. I were gonna say it, it's checking Fiats . Which Fiat? She's got a , and she's got a Fiat. She's got a Fiat Strada. Did she? She's had it ages! But her dad's got well Stu's dad's got a Sierra ain't he? Mm. Mm. And Sierra's are if something jerks it cuts the fuel line dunnit? Mm. It stops it and you've got a button somewhere on your dash what you press to release it. Well they didn't know and they to it were towing Julie's car and the tow belt snapped, and of course when it jerked this car forward it cut the petrol off. Or what Shouldn't have done. Well it did. And he couldn't get no petrol for it and he had to call A A out. So she had to walk home and he walked home ! It shouldn't have done that. Not on, not when they're, when they're already in motion. Set off with the towing Julie's car and the tow rope just snapped in two, and it jerked both cars and it cut off the fuel. Well he should have just zoomed off! It shouldn't have jerked his, should it? Yeah, but you've got your feet down and you're towing summat, and then suddenly it releases, it just goes er forward a bit dunnit? See that bit in That doesn't paper about that Robin Reliant and he's done it all up and it does hundred mile an hour! Hundred and eight! I wouldn't fancy going down no bloody motorway, hundred eight in one of them! I tell you some of them Robi I bet , I bet it's I know! he had a Honda Civic engine in it! Oh, oh dear ! I shouldn't think anybody'd insure it! I'm surprised! Then that bloody prat towing down motorway at hundred mile an hour! Towing? Yeah! Towing a Car! towing somebody down motorway. And they're going hundred mile an hour! He had a new Fiat er what were it? Don't know. I just know that it The next one up from ours. Oh! The one that er oh! Oh! The Corona? Corona. Coroma? Coroma? He had a new Coroma two litre and he's towing this bloke on motorway at hundred mile an hour ! Have you seen ? Well Terry came down last night. Well Will you have any exams this year? Got loads! I've got about twelve. For what? Everything. I've got I've got one in March for definite. What exams? Yeah. I don't know. I think I've got one in April. You don't pay for them though do you? I hope not. Ah! I hope not and all ! I have one in April two in May And what are they all on like? three in June or two in June and then when we go back we've got about three in September and we'll have some more at Christmas. They're not mock exams are they? No. Proper exams. I've got my Red Cross in stage one, my R S A part one and two, stage two. I've got shorthand Pitman not Pitman, R S A, shorthand Teeline shorthand Teeline again at end of one, end of year. And I've got another one in word processing, hopefully. I've got my audio. My audio o transcription medical and I've got my Teeline medical. Oh! Mhm. And then after that I've got er that thing in for my exams. My proper diploma exams. None of them, there's only two of them that are to do with my diploma. All the rest are at fortunately. How long will you finish this? Middle of next year or end of next year? It'll be July when we take the exams. That's when the course will actually finish. What, this July? No! No. That's right. But I don't know how long it is before I get my results back. But you can get a post as a medical secretary in a hospital or a G P without having your full diploma. If yous let it, cos to get the full diploma you've got to get your two skills which is medical audio, and medical shorthand, you've got to have them two skills to get the diploma. And you've also got four papers ethics and etiquette you got an English one, a medical aspects one, and a clerical skills one. Not a clerical skills one, but, office procedures. And you've got to pass all them, plus your two skills to get the diploma. But you can resit any what you fail the following year. Mm. Mm! Teresa says, the only one what presents any difficulty is usually the medical aspects one. Well why should that present anything different? Because it covers such a wide area. It says the English paper you only need, you only need seventy five percent for your erm it's seventy five percent pass rate. You've got to get above seventy five to pass. Yeah, it's That's quite high that, you know, seventy five percent! Well it's got to be ain't it? The office procedures, she said, is simple anyway, and yet, ethics and etiquette is a, she said, and your teacher works you that hard and it just drills in anyway! No, but, seventy five percent is a high pass rate. Well I don't know who she is that sends letters out to your nana, but she's bloody useless! She misses more words out than she gets in! And she just writes over them in, in pen! If it's her computer though, they might just erm, thingy it and change it to suit them. Well it wouldn't be on word processor. You don't know. Cos it's,the you're supposed to that's what it's for so you can check all your spellings. A lot of them letters that come out are already done and you just delete Gonna say that's they're all on word processor that's what I'm saying. Eh! I got a pass, oh I got a distinction for, we did er like mock exam for word processing, I got a pass. Whatsername her in, her the launderette were asking me er she was, she were on about I, ain't you got a job yet? I said, I think I'm too qualified to get a job! She said we she said, well aye, you might be. She says, int your daughter i er a nice girl? I said, well aye sometimes! ? She's seen you in there. She says what's sh what's she do? I said, oh she's at college. Oh! Really? I says, she says er what she's studying? I said, well she's er she's going in for medical secretary. She said, well where does she get her brains from? I sa I said well who do you think? I says, I'm over- qualified for work, I says, and it looks like she's gonna end up that way if you're not careful! She says, oh! So she said, I think she's ever so pretty! I says, aye. Said, pity her manners don't blink er mannerisms don't match her looks ! Teresa's on about erm a she were asking me if anybody'd be interested into going on to higher er education after this? And I college yet! Yeah, but you get, you don't get no grant for that. What college? . But if it's only a part-time so you can actually work part-time that's the difference. Yeah. Fantastic salary if you get qualified! It's alright if you can get day release from your work to do it. That's what you want to be after, day release. Yeah. They're trying to make our course into a three day a week. Erm, nine till six at night. It's a long day though. That's what I said. I mean, you get we get a mental block after three three o'clock us ! You do. I mean, doing shorthand for four hours a day, it's too much! It's far too much! Well, just think, when you're working full-time you'd be working nine till five. I know, but it's different when you're concentrating Mind you on studying and when you're concentrating on working. Billy , er Billy 's one of Billy 's daughter-in-laws, she, she does it part-time. What, medical secretary? Yeah. She's er Good money at part-time! I know. That's what erm that's which one of them, who were it telling me? Er I don't know whether it were the young lad that comes in, or whether it was Jes that were telling me. Mhm. I can't imagine it being Jes. I think it were Jes what were telling you . Well it might have been Jes cos I don't know tha well they've got, I think they've got two children. And she were doing it full-time and then she went she had children and then she went part-time. But I don't think she's working . That's one advantage of being medical secretary I think she's just had another baby or summat. cos if you get in a big organization like N H S, they provide a creche. Mm. And thi I mean, you don't have to pay for the creche cos it comes in the, it's part of your Well thingy. part of your job innit? It's like nurses at hospital innit? And they've got a hospital. Mm. Well that's the creche what you get into. . That's why a lot of people will go into medical secretary who have children. Has Sue got a job at all? I don't know. She's not interested. No. I think she'll be married shortly. I can see her marrying him. Yeah. But he's one of them lads where she'll never have owt, cos he don't do, he won't bloody work will he? Well he's doing taxis. Yeah but Ah! It's only a pound a it's not . pigging hour! He's on dole! Well I'm gonna report him! Mm! And he, he's getting one parent benefit! He'll be getting all sorts for that young girl! As soon as he gets a house she will leave home. Yeah. He's not so sure of that. What's happened between other one? Have they had an argument like? No. I just don't know. She's got two men. I know, but always nice to know. Bit of scandal now and again. You're getting worse than a woman you, now you're at home! I know, there's nowt from men though is there? They say women are bitchy but have you ever heard a conversation betwe No. conducted by men? They beat us easy. That back door wants rubbing down I think don't it, before you paint it dunnit? Yeah. Yeah Oh! Oh! You are listening then? I am listening! Are you? I were just thinking where my sander were. It's, Mick's got it. I must fe Mick's got it. Mm. Did you clean that cupboard out I asked you to do? No, I forgot. Which cupboard? That one where oil's kept cos it I, the last time, I cleaned it out last time and put a some kitchen roll in in a plastic bag on top but it's all over again. What it wants Have you see how that unit's all cracked under sink? Mm. I can't understand why it's cracked like that. It's what? I ca It's all cracked! Mhm. I, you don't know why it's cracked? That one where we used to keep rubbish bin. I cracked it when I put it in. Oh! I knelt on it if you remember. And broke it. I can't get over that ruddy idiot in ! That what? That idiot in . Moving all that stuff into, a washer, a cooker, in middle of floor like that! The cupboards are nice! I didn't like them. Well they're fairly nice tha They're alright. They're alright, they're passable. It don't matter if they were . Yeah. Nice aren't they? Yeah. I think they're too alike but after saying that, they're quite nice and he made such a bugger of them ain't he? By putting Put them in the wrong places ain't he? I mean what he's do I, I know why he's done it. They didn't what he's two metres square by about two metres high with er on the top. Er basically we call this area and the area here we've got er and for the actual set up. Er the problem with the job is it's very tight inside there so we've had to use cranes and basically poured concrete er ours is being done by a separate sub-contractor. Er few problems with the job before we started or during the job er,come back to us for a six so far so we have to What we will do is drop them down and Er another problem with the job is we're about three week's behind er arranged for them to come in on Monday. we had to pull forward it's not due so we've got er so we've given them three days to You see when we worked out the numbers for the we were given all the, the allowances, the rates et cetera, et cetera , we worked the forecast through and seen huge amounts of time given for which the assumption is that it's all done by hand, the job these cranes so the resources how much money had been spent. Here, the concrete Yeah that but we haven't got the resources to do it yet We've just got a couple of assumptions At, together at the beginning The tractor and trailer is generally helping moving between cranes loading back and forth, so many areas So,unless you want us to go through this literally point by point, it's question time. Anybody got any questions? One problem very small area that's why working at the same time. Er another problem we had as well is we had all going at the same time in a very close area as well. Er, when it comes to the wall shutters seven metres high er top and bottom That's right. That's right. erm do you identify Erm,basically what's in the programme but Erm, in your plan you, you seem to have like two objectives One was Yeah. and the other was, which I don't think you said Did you find that a particular problem? Yes we had to get them all into the tanks otherwise Okay. Right, thanks very much indeed Sir, when I do present to each training do you think that's I, I think it would give erm I, what you would probably do would be to put those three things Yeah. Oh, but that's all right with you here's your work, get on with it but I, I do understand what has happened here. Okay, thank you very much, I, I like that. Two, please? Erm, good morning ladies and gentlemen. My name is Alan and this is Terry and we're Group Two. We're going to talk to you about er Farm project and its basic problems which we had to put a programme together and er make the job Erm you've seen this before so our construction but the only to get there we had to squeeze through a gap this way and come round Now we just have a couple of minor problems to start with. Here we go and that is that, up to now, erm we've only made six beams, we've got to reach, for these tanks, we want to make sixty and the problem is we're on stop now redesign the whole thing and going on the present rate of production we're going to go up to about week twenty-eight. Twelve weeks over the time that is allotted in the programme and to do that we're gonna have to produce the twice the rate that we're doing now. So, that's just a little summary and Terry will fill you in more. Er, what we can do If the figures are worth eleven and a half days erm seventeen, seventeen days. That's for the We actually calculated them by using the unit quantity Now, ow! We decided one of our first things we had to do was decide on a sequence of construction for these tanks. We tried to keep it as logical as possible and er, there you have it. unless you have a base to work off of started to do, once we started doing the er, the walls take the scaffold down out of the way and to release some area off our stock pile we decided to back build so that by the time that we'd done six tanks we'd got half our area taken up by all that material excavated and just flip back to the drawing here what's going to happen is that stockpile here. While we're down this area and we've got the cranes sited in here to do these tanks this way and the pipes coming in this way and the tanks construction going on, we need to release this sort of area to be able to get everything so there's more work to do. Now, what we've decided to do on the formwork for the tanks is to construct er a square frame into formwork er into one hold everything in place while we pour the concrete Onto the programme oh there it is. Erm just er presentation of the programme of the way and the, the way we tried to get into everything. You know at the beginning of er week six? I mean, sorry, week er thirteen that er base six had been poured and therefore so the first thing we did was to get base six as soon as possible. Erm we also know that base five formwork is up so we started on base five as soon as we can, put as many resources into it as we can we mentioned earlier that er having five hundred people in there made life quite congested but we decided the more people that helped in there the better and er our objective was to get the er wall steelwork up. It was gonna take quite a while so erm we got the base five as quickly as possible so that we had as many hands on the job at once and er we had some formwork getting spare so we decided to make them useful and it's a case of we'd got six tanks to do and if we had a breakage we can't afford to stop the programme so as a er, a standby, just in case, we may never use these we might three or four uses out of but if we do have a breakage we want to be able to replace that straight away so have a spare set and you've got nothing more to do and er get the walls, get the er, the back build operation right at the very end, ongoing, till you've got the waterproofers in er get the waterproofing up to the five meter level and er get the back build in as quickly as possible. We tried to keep the scaffolders er occupied, doing their scaffolding bit accurate but safe everybody's gonna be climbing down on that. We've allowed a day for safety checks somewhat excessive but er there's always something that you find on scaffolding that's not quite right. You're not allowed to work on it and er that's about it really, our programme, we've decided to er start the pipe at the first position away from the tank construction and we've, we've set out, we employed a concrete layer and to lay out the pipes while we're doing nothing and continue on with the so that while this gang is actually laying there's only er six people in total. Two actually doing the pipe-laying, quite heavy pipes er that's it really. Thank you very much indeed. Any questions from anybody? Well, what we've decided to do is er know what to do and er this, this is the gang this is maybe exaggerated if you don't have three people on the bottom if you get Any thing else? Erm the, the frame that we've, that we will have on site You'll have one frame? We'll have, have one frame on site to start with, with the er steel er around about What we've er planned to do is site the crane and then we can do all the formwork and shut the in these a bit nearer. Erm delivery for the steel will come in and we need a crane to offload and a crane when we're offloading onto the tractor trailer Erm, well it is a mobile crane so er One crane will be pretty much fully employed and er if it's busy down here we can always bring the, the mobile crane Still mobile though Yes. Yes, yes it'll probably take quite a while actually. Erm here we go. It takes er one and a half days to do the base and er eight, eight days and eight Mondays to er to do the walls but two hundred and four, four days in total can't stop the concrete. Very good. Thank you very much. Yes, okay. Don't cheer at once. Do you want the main programme? Chris, do you want the main Yes I do. programme? That one? Yeah. Okay. Do you want anything else for that er Just a layout that's all. A layout. This one? Yeah. Okay. They've gone off! Right, morning everyone. We're Group five. We're, working on an hotel project I think and we're up to week thirteen on the programme and I think you might be able to see on week thirteen and given the information we've got at the moment as well, it means we're gonna be working on three floors at once so it was the first thing to identify. Working on three floors at once we decided to we needed to continue work on the seventh floor before moving up to the eighth and so on to the ninth by the information given us in the er we calculated that the men that were to get onto the programme by the end of the week calculated the production rate for various gangs to see how fast so that's how it was looking. Starting work on the seventh floor and allocating gangs accordingly. But you can see, you can see already that the production rate is no where near good enough to meet the programme and if it's only on the first part of the seventh floor, bearing in mind we've got to be working on three floors at the same time, we're only on the first part of the seventh floor and already we've got overlaps on day Granted, it's a major problem. If you carry on I'll show you the situation worsens as we've attempted Carrying on on the seventh floor, all the, all the other gangs are still employed working in the previous area. We haven't got enough Nice to get some work started on the eighth floor because of the different activities But then again with the activities that are carrying on on the seventh floor we can't By the time we get round to the ninth pretty desperate. We've only really got work for the the labourers in the form, even labourers aren't employed up to the ninth floor cos that work's already been completed. meant to be moving onto the tenth and eleventh floor it only takes them a short time to save time on that or, or cut down on your labour as usual. There's no need for them to be but there again it's a desperate situation That's it. Okay. Thanks very much. Yeah. What sort of gap? Yeah we put the got it tiled got these, sorry? Have you got it all tiled up there? Wall tiles there now. Is it? How do we know whether you We've assumed, we haven't got any information given to us to tell us where so I've made an assumption we've made an assumption that and we're, and then, and then I'll start in, in room one on the seventh floor. Where are they going? Where are they going after that? Yeah. Are they just So, on the seventh floor the floor tiles are next and the next job they're doing is on the eighth which is more floor tiling. What they're doing before or what they're doing afterwards? Both. Wouldn't be able to read it. The wouldn't be able to read it. Well I'm not going to. I'm not going to. But I can show you, I can show you the eighth floor and show you where the gang where is the eighth floor? three, four, seven, Yeah. and go on to four, eight, three. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, but they can't start, we can't start But we don't know, we haven't that information. We've got to make, we've got make some assumption. Yeah we don't know which numbers. Yeah. I, I don't know No it's erm, on, on Monday , on Monday morning they could've been working Another room? Yes. Yep. But it couldn't be working in the room if we had control of the numbers though. Couldn't be working in the room if we had control of the numbers. It would've been best with a bigger piece, bigger programme because then we could've it was easy to see where we were slipping If we had started on week one, where if we'd had complete programme information up to week thirteen when, that'd be more complete wouldn't it? Well that's it, yeah. Yeah. No, they're, they are complete up to programme by Wednesday dinner time. They don't do anything more than the, than necessitation to, to Well they can do. They can do if they want or they can progress onto other rooms to get time back that way, but anyway, can't you?we have er a target to meet on the programme of X percentage time and they will meet that far Wednesday afternoon so we haven't continued and shown I take your point. In reality they would be, they'd be moving onto another area. But then we don't know which other areas are ready, do we? Right. I like, I like that Any other questions? No? Thank you very much indeed. Good. Group four next? This was Ian by the way. Yeah, morning, everyone. We're Group four looking at the er, the hotel complex which has been explained before hand. Erm we approached the first project we were looking at the information we had available er, looking at the strength of the work a lot of information As you can see the er and, and looking at the er a definite lack of comments? Yeah, sure. No, we've had the main update they should know what Fine. Fine, okay laid anybody else off? No, we've managed to keep everybody else in er, in work. Yeah, yeah. My eyesight is not what it used to be. Er where do they go? They go up to floor eight Why can't they Good. Any, anything else? Everything else Yeah we got, we got all four hours a night. Sorry? Where did you get from? Er, from the information we was given. Erm the It depends how narrowed it down a bit So you just Yeah Yeah from other jobs we've done. Yep, that's good. Pardon? thank you very much indeed. Group Three Hello, Everybody Well, what we did was we what we did was we erm found the alarm system to try and calculate some reasonable output rates erm but what we found was the output rates seemed incredibly low using based on the completion that they have got So what we was we erm took the nine week's work that they'd done and erm plus they'd obviously based our output rates on that erm just for a little example, using the allowances we haven't got whereas actually we'd been calculating it on what they hadn't worked so, that was basically what we So moving on to the actual short-term programme Okay. Rather than looking at the proposal we decided that it was so that's what we did really and that's why, if you have a look down there right, so all we're doing then we're working through the resources and allocating them room numbers erm and then when that's done so that's what we did for each of the little rooms. Yeah, but basically from, from that programme all, all the er, you can see all the resources were really being used all week and, but I had a problem when we came to do the bedrooms that er, you can there, we ran out of work for the decorators to do er removing this thing, once you've removed and then I managed to squeeze in, but where the second decorator's erm up to room twenty-three but rather than erm have just one gang than, and not, not using as many as the resources as we possibly could I let them gave the second gang a few rooms that they could actually squeeze in without interrupting I've let them do up to room twenty-three and then and then basically the carpenting and they have to come in after everybody else has done what they Monday morning basically we just decided that we really needed more resources the earlier sequence of events to, to get so we were getting to so whether we've been given I did the erm it's a bit tricky to describe where with the active areas because you haven't got room decorators. Yeah, we hadn't got time And we didn't do this Too tricky! Is that it? Yeah. Thanks very much. I thought about that On the basis of our calculation Erm, could I, could I on, on the er diagram concerned Well, you can have a look. Right, we've got erm Wednesdays Sorry, Tuesday afternoon. from three to er twenty-eight. Have you got your purse? Well the erm, oh. Saved by the bell! I think, I think in fact you're, you're not having the problems that we're having where it's very difficult so you've got er a really nice representation but haven't quite gone far enough. Cos we did actually, we went to before we went, putting the things together making sure that we weren't starting the next activity until the, the rooms would be finished. However, when we decided this morning to change the whole way of presentation, yeah, I was just getting along to that. Erm, is it probably that the numbers All right, I, I accept that, but basically Yeah, well if we had, if we had of had more time we could've, like, written each individual room but really I just put the numbers down quickly just to, to demonstrate There was one Is it the same sort of thing? I wanted to Okay The resources were broken down also into groups er, a gang per room. Whereas really, then if you have bathroom, they might as well be working in that same bedroom at the same time, whereas we had two separate gangs. Where do you think I mean bearing in mind that all the resources were broken down presumably the were separate gangs we couldn't really make Erm. They were definitely coming, weren't they, for the electricals? Electricals Yeah. Good. Thank you very much indeed. Thank, thank you everybody, very well done. Erm, do you want to get a coffee before we start again? Yes. We've switched the recorder on so we're gonna start. Thank you for those presentations, I thought they were very good. I thought that the thought of, er, the thoughts gone into your erm plans and your presentation was much greater than we've had on previous courses. I think you've been a lot more conscientious and got a lot er, potentially a lot more out of it. I'd like to spend a few minutes now trying to pull that together and then go onto how we evaluate these plans, because you've all produced these and wouldn't you like to know how good they are and how bad they are? Can you tell how good they are and how bad they are? Er, quite often on real projects people produce these plans and they get out and work to that and never had to pause to think, this is a good one, this is a bad one. Can we improve it? Does it need improving? Electronics was never my strong point. They hadn't invented electronics when I was Still had one? Wireless. Wireless? Yeah, still had wireless. Could I take er, a minute and, and just try and look at the steps that you've gone through and I, I tried to write down as you were doing it, giving your presentation, the steps which I think everybody eventually went through either formally or informally and I think if we look at these steps you'll agree yes, I needed that and I did that or, we didn't do it formally. Er, step one, I think, is assess the current state. Where were we? And some of you had difficulty doing this erm, I think one of the hotel er groups said to me, I didn't know which rooms had been done. Well, we needed to know which rooms had been done. Another group just said, they were rooms one through ten, and er one of the tank farm group said, we didn't know exactly where we were but this was I think the assumptions that Group two told me were er, were about that. Is that right? I can't remember. So we have to assess the current state and if we didn't know then in our particular example, cos if we hadn't made the room numbers had been done. Er and thi this lead us to a list of things to do. Is that right? No, you may have said, ah, I've got room this to do, I've got this base to do, this base formwork base, erm,thi this wall er reinforcement to do. So in, in both projects I think we had to do that first step. Er, we had to get the number of resources. If only I could spell resources, number of resources. Now, everybody had to do that. Er, there you said I'd got three formwork gangs or four formwork gangs six a gang er and here you said I'd got so many so we had to do that. They weren't any good by themselves er, these things because I the other thing which you had to get from somewhere was output rates. How good were people at erecting er wall formwork or fixing base steel? How long did it take er, a plumbing gang to do first-fix plumbing? The questions are identical I think. They were just slightly different types of work which were being done. In, in this one it might've been slightly easier because everything was spelled out you had to do you had to do carpenting, you had to do electrical. In this one it wasn't quite so er, straightforward in that we, we hadn't given you the actual activities to do. We'd given you the activities to do there so you could find the output of them. In this one we hadn't told you that you had to strip formwork, that you had to er, make the formwork, that you had to fix the steel, you had to know this from your own knowledge. Yeah? So you had to know that in order to, to pour concrete you had to have something to pour it into and you had to put the erm you had to have er reinforcements as well. Bu but basically the output rates were, you had to do. You had to think of a method and the method was particularly difficult, I think, on the tank farm one where this is the sort of method that I am thinking here of how, how on earth am I going to build it on, on the hotel? It wa wa was very prescribed. You didn't have much choice in, in what you did. Yeah? You had a, you had a choice in sequence of doing things but you didn't have a choice in method, whereas in the tank farm I think you had a choice of method. You, you could say, I'm going to do all four walls together or I'm going to do one wall at a time. Yeah? Erm and it, it was quite interesting but I, I think that the two groups that presented actually did, had chosen different methods. Is that correct? Yeah? So you had to choose that er, you have to do that and the fifth thing that I wrote down here which I had to do, a sequence er, of work. Now there are two sequences here I, I think erm in, in all these things. You have to do the detail sequence er so for the tank farm this is, here I've got to do the formwork before the reinforcement before the concrete or the other way round, I've got to the reinforcement before the formwork before the concrete. And that's an on-going thing wherever you do it this is the detail sequence. On the hotel the sequence was I've got to do the first-fix plumbing before I do the second-fix plumbing. I've gotta do it in this order. Yeah? And so for each one of them you might've started by, having got all this, what you could do then is write for each individual element, a tank base, a tank wall a bedroom or a bathroom, you can produce, I would suggest, a little bar chart which might look like that, for one unit. And this is a chart where this was activity down here and time along there. So this would be a little bar chart for one bedroom, one bathroom, base, wall, whatever it is. And that brings together all of these things here. The number of resources, output rates, the method, the sequence. Okay? So that, we've got, there you've got to do lots of different concrete and excavation, slightly different thing, here you've got to do lots and lots of these. You've gotta do thirty-six on one floor, thirty-six on another floor, and the next thing that you got is all the information together where all you've got to do is put that, lots of those together and it's er, it's er a shuffling around procedure, isn't it? Yeah? And you know they can't go, this one can't go earlier than that one because we've got the sequence and so if we got through these steps, I think that those steps are the same steps that we go through on any project. And indeed when Bill, yesterday, asked you what do you need to do short-term planning? If you go back and look at your list I wouldn't mind betting that your list includes, we need to know the sequence, we need to know the number of resources, we need to know the output rates, we need to know the method. Yeah? I wouldn't mind betting that Bill's lists that you gave him actually contained all these things and only then can we actually put them down in order. It's a great shame that when we are presented with er a problem, when we're out on site, we actually forget all these things and, and I think that probably it took you an hour or so yesterday to actually recognise, oh yes, I need this and I need this and I need this. Once you've got them yeah? The problem actually becomes much more manageable. Would, would you agree? Yeah? And I certainly think the results that you've produced show that the, the problem is quite manageable because I think in the end you've actually produced a very good programme for work. All of them! Because you've had to make different assumptions and you've er decided different ways are different. But I think your, your thinking has gone along these lines which is fundamental to any planning programme. Now when you're out on site some of these things you have to do each week. Some of them you don't have to do each week because they're there from previous work on, on the site. So you would know the output rate, or you think you'd know the output rates but you only know those output rates if somebody bothered to collect them! Somebody might not have collected them, so you might have to And as work changes it would er, then the method. We would hope that that has been defined er by somebody of the hierarchy but, if we're moving onto new work areas, it might not The sequence maybe self-evident but it may not be and it would be nice to have it written down. I think especially in the, in the hotel project it's useful to have a little bar chart saying this is what goes on in a bathroom. Yeah? Even even, okay, even if we the the reason that we need the output rate was to find the length of this bar. Yeah? If you wish that to send things out to subbies first of all you've got to have it reasonable, but you still need the length of that bar. That's what I'm saying And so you're assuming the output rate in order to get the length of that bar. Erm you, you might do, Chris. I, I'm not arguing with you. I think that it is sensible, even when you send stuff out to subbies, to make sure that you've got a reasonable plan, especially when you send out to subbies, because they're very hard to control anyway and you've got to make sure that you've not sent unrealistic targets, either too high or too low. And I think there's a lot of goes on here. Er, in, in, in the real world where people say, you do it, it's yours. Whereas in reality I think people have got to take responsibility and say, this is a reasonable time for you to do it in and we will control that reasonable time. Yeah? But I do take your point, of course. Ah, right, right. We've got to get the things to do but quite often if you are, we've got to have those things to do you've got finish by a particular time. If I told you now that we needed another five gangs of floor tilers or whatever it was which you hadn't got enough of, it won't be floor tilers something you haven't got enough of, everything, could you get them by Monday? As short-term you can't, at medium- and long-term you can and that's where we've got to recognise in order to muster the resources onto site. But really at short-term I still believe that we are doing this and this is what we're, we're, we're aiming at this. Use the available resources but maybe the wrong ones because somebody in the position of authority hasn't recognised or he hasn't got enough to finish the project by the client required date. Yes, to attempt to achieve it. using available resources to attempt to achieve it But you see, what we've got is a set of fairly standard steps here which you got through no matter what the project and I hope that er, you've all had a bit of practice at that. What I'd like to do now is reach for another er set of notes and er, talk about, change, change direction a bit and talk about checking erm short-term programmes. sorry If we get one of the main problems that I find is that, I've already said, is that people produce short-term programmes and they get issued. Nobody actually knows whether they're right, whether they're wrong or if there are any problems with them. I think that whenever there's a programme it ought to be agreed above and below er a hierarchy. So, what do you think of this? Is that alright? Is there a problem with that? Is it doing what we want? What sort of things do you think should be checked in a, in a programme? Feasibility. Feasibility? By that you mean the order of things we ought to think about so Well I mean, I'm really saying can you actually Oh, we've got lots of things to do. Er can I, can I take a few of those er an and try and separate them. Yeah. you've gotta break it down. I, I want to break it down, yes. I really want to break it down. Erm one thing that you said there having all these people in there, in, in, in the room. What, what, erm what do we call that? I think, I think there're, there're a few things erm, I think you asked the question er, Peter, about having eighteen people on one base all got to work together. I thought, the not that I made there was safety. Yeah. Yeah? And er this clash might be, give rise to a safety aspect. It may not be the first thing at the top of our minds when we're, when we're checking the thing but I think it ought to be checked for that. Erm okay, then I, I think that er what we'd got er, what you were talking about there was clashes. Yeah? Erm and if I may er use that geographic clashes, you know, we've got all the people in one room or we've all the people in one base. It may not be of safety but it maybe er not the sort of thing that we want. Erm so, geographic. What other things are we going to check? Sequence. Yeah, we, we really ought to check the sequence. Have we, what do you mean? Er, have we really drawn our programme, we've got a very complex programme for the, the, tank farm which we did, have we shown ourselves putting the reinforcements in after we've poured the concrete? Because in fact It certainly should be. Yeah? It Somebody some I'm, where are you handing it over to? Well I, I thi well if, if your boss checks it, what should he be checking for? Aveline, I'm not even checking for figures there I'm just looking through, just scanning through, erm I'm I'm, I haven't said how we're gonna check these. Yeah? I think that it ought to be self-evident, erm if we've done our programme in a way which er, is clear or if we've presented it in a clear fashion, then I think sequence and clashes er and safety, to a large extent, become self-evident. As they indeed they did from, I think it was your er programme Group er two, where you'd actually drawn out quite boldly bearing tank five, tank five, tank five or whatever tank it was. Yeah? There was, you know, your judgment was, this was okay. But somebody else's judgment might have been that this was a geographic clash. Yeah? Er and they may have thought it was not acceptable from that point of view but you felt that it was okay. Er the sequence, I think, has also got to be done. I think that the sort of sequence that erm I can't remember which group it was You need a sequence indeed, yeah, erm, just a minute, I, I've made a not somewhere. Erm on, on yours in fact I couldn't check sequence erm on the programme that you'd given me because I didn't, I, I had know way of telling whether we did get a clash. I think we discussed room twenty-eight or something, didn't we? So I, I couldn't actually check that but somebody's got to check it. It's got be feasible! Now you said that you'd actually presented it in another way and were just, and, and had just changed it. Yeah? Yes, yeah, yeah, well indeed you yeah, yeah. which Indeed, you had, you had thought about it and so it would just have been a case of saying, yes, this is obvious. Yeah? And so that's all, all that's necessary. But I think it is necessary. Yeah? What other, what other ones? Go on, tell me some other ones. Continuity? Yeah. Once again that's another one which is just a glance at the, at the programme if it's presented one way and very difficult if it's presented another way. Yeah? As, as, as somebody pointed out, I mean that the floor by floor was great for one, from one point of view, wasn't it? In that you could see what was happening on the floor but it didn't show continuity of work which easily I'm not, I not arguing with it, yeah. I'm not arguing with it. Yeah? I'm, I'm just saying that one way we can see things easily and another way we can't, and we do want to check it, we do want to be sure that there is continuity. It might be it might be, it, it might be. We, we have some interesting pictures of what's on site and er, so yes, I agree it might be. I'm not saying it is. Yes. Because there are, I don't know how many sites Tarmac run, but there must be at least the number of sites that they've ever run divided by two standard ways of planning, Tarmac. That's a hell, a hell of a lot of standard ways of planning. Okay, what else? Yeah, like that! Erm shall I put finance? Now that's, that's a bit more difficult to check from these, from these diagrams, but I think it's very important, don't you? You know you want to know and I would've thought that the higher the management the more they want to know the implications, the financial of it of any plan which you're going into. Yeah? So I look at the short-term programme and er see, yeah. No, we couldn't because what happened was the But we do know that some people have done within Tarmac. Sorry? Well I don't know where. We'll have to look in John's thing, yeah? There isn't, you know, there isn't one thing is that we need to, with the short-term programmes we didn't do it work out the financial we need to go one stage further identify where the labour is I'm gonna look a financial implication because it's something which, I reckon, having had practice of this, you can do in if we, we'll give you an example. We'll let you do it on your example. You could, you've gotta talk, exactly, it will ta It's one it's very, very simple and you can and usually It's usually, it is it isn't there but it's terribly important so we're gonna have a look a that. Okay. But before we go to that Check resources Check, in what, in what way, Tom? Somebody's got, somebody's gotta make sure that they're there next time, yeah. So, yeah, resource considerations. I, I, I think so. Now it may well be that that is actually looking into a slightly longer term. You're now beginning to use the short- term plan to muster resources and that's very dangerous because er, you've only got a very small snapshot of what's going on. Er, but it can certainly indicate that er, more things are required. Yeah? Yeah. Yes, indeed. Yeah yeah. So, so, could I er, the sort of realism of the outputs yeah? Is a, is a, a thing which you're commenting on as well. Yeah, yeah. I, I think realism of the outputs I, I think what you're saying is, look, these might be okay but this one isn't. Yeah? The others you might not have argued but, you know, you might say my experience is that it, I could do it in eighty percent of that time. But your experience on, on one thing, I think, was, I can do it five times better than that. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. The only thing you could do to this programme is Okay. Yeah. Well we've got the resource. I, I've put, I've put both. I, I agree. Yeah? Er, what else? We need to check for the Yeah. So we've got to check the objectives, haven't we? Yeah? Yeah. Er yeah, I, I think very much so. Yeah, very important. So somebody's got to say, is this you've got a problem. Yeah? Which he may not be able to do anything for that week but it will ring a bell loud and clear the following weeks. Yeah? Okay, I agree there and, and objectives, so we might say er, future work which might bring in the, your point er, Tom. That okay? I, I agree, yeah. All these things have gotta be checked. Anything else that's gotta be checked. Er, yes, I think we're looking at objectives there as, as, as being programme, yeah. In what way? Quality Quality? Ah, right. Now quality. Well indeed,qual quality, quality is a very different, I haven't written quality down. I, I think quality is a very difficult one. But you can guarantee if you're trying to force people to do things in er, unacceptable ma methods then you're gonna have a problem meeting quality. So the acceptability of the work pattern will affect the, the quality and so if you want a general thing there, I'd rather put down yeah, I'd rather put down for acceptability of work pattern. Yeah? But er, all these things should go towards that. Yeah? There, there's still something else I, I, I think that ought to be there. Perhaps two things. And I know that you've considered it er, in, in, drawing up some of your, your, programmes and Well, yeah, well try to expand a little more on that, Chris, when you, when you say coordination. Yes. Okay, now, now I think, I think you've said, getting all the materials down to one end er, so you've got two things there, I think. You've materials and you've got access. Yeah? Have we considered materials at all? Are the materials available? Are we gonna be able to get them into the right place? Are we gonna be able to get the people into the right place? Yeah? And, and those are really the two last things that I had on mine, on my list. Now these, these tend to go fairly well together. I think access was a particular problem on the hotel. Yeah? We had one lift to get everything up and down. Yeah. So so somehow they've got to move there, haven't they? They've got to be moved and I it's, it's, it's a tremendous time You only had lift three, yeah. Yeah. No. So you've a got a real problem and this, this will very much affect the work method. Now you had a very similar access problem, didn't you, which, was it Group two that referred to particularly? Did you, did you talk about it? Some of you, one of you Yeah. Once again, you know, you'd have thought in a green field construction site that you wouldn't get access problems and in er, a restricted area like a city centre building or er, a you would get access problems. But I actually think that you've got access problems in both of them and they have to be considered because the do really affect severely or they could severely affect er the success or failure of the programme, and it's these list of things which you think, now I've thought about that or I haven't thought about that. Quite often in, in reality they don't get thought about and it's quite often these sort of things which cause programmes not to work, because on site people work round them. Oh, I've gotta do that, I've gotta do that. You're continuously working round and taking people off doing what they ought to do simply to move things around and you, you've talked of that. There's a tremen oh yes, yeah, there is a limit, so maybe what you're doing is just assessing is this going to give er problems or have we got put a gang on specifically moving things around. Yeah? Right. Right. Yeah. But at the time Yeah. You've definitely got to think about it at er long-term er, very much so, Chris. But I do think you've got to realise that it's going to affect your production rates. Simply having er an access problem is quite severely going to affect your production rates, whether you like it or not! You know, if, if somebody's got to move a twenty-two R B even three hundred yards, they don't do that any more, do they, they move it metres. Yeah? It's gonna take quite a long time. Yeah? If you're in a restricted area and you want somebody to do something you can't get to cranes in there, you've actually got to say I'll do that one and then I'll do that one. So this thing of having the crane doing this and the crane doing that, I was actually a bit concerned about that. In the hotel, once again we've gotta get all these, we've gotta things into a room which is obvious, but you've gotta get things up through the lift and you've got this bottleneck. Yeah? Just like the crane, in fact you've gotta transport in a bottle, an access bottle. Erm, could I go on and look at er, the finance which I've starred here. Somebody, somebody said finances, I think it's very important and I'd like to look at financial implication and see if we can do something about it. And I've got er, I've got a printed overhead here which is nice so I'll use my printed overhead. Er, and I want to talk a little bit about er finance and I, I've got to recognise to start with that not all money is controllable at the site level. Sorry? You will get you will get some notes on this. Cos, cos, cos it's printed it's in my notes somewhere. It's, it's the things that I've written down quickly. Not all money is controllable at site level. Would you agree with that? At different sites different things are controllable. So, on some sites you might say, no, I, well I can control the labour costs and I can control the er, plant usage, but I don't buy the materials myself the only way I can affect them is by altering the wastage. Yeah? Er, but basically somebody else in head office somewhere orders these materials. On another site you say, no, I order all my own materials. It, it will vary very much from contract to contract but not all money is, is controllable and how much you all contribute to erm Brian B M W from your projects, I, I don't think you have any control over do you? Precious little over them. Precious little? Well somebody contributes it, don't they, cos he's got a B M W. And he hasn't bought me a Renault er, I, I think, I, I'd like to make the, the comment that in general the money which can be controlled at site level is that related to labour and plant. So if you might say, no, I can control materials erm but labour and plant, would you agree? Right, but er if, do you have er, er, a choice over what price is paid? Some, some sites do, yeah, some sites do, but some sites will, will use the central buyers. Yeah, that's right The, the central buyers will do it, yeah? And so, and so whatever, whatever the buyers have agreed they, you will pay that price! So you can't con you can control when it comes but you ain't gonna ch you're not gonna control how much you pay for, for, for almost anything, I'm afraid. Some sites do. Some sites can actually go and order everything. Some sites can go and order everything up to a thousand pounds. Some sites can go and order er things up to fifty pounds. Yeah, sometimes, it, it depends very much on You can do Well you can, but not everybody can. Yeah? Erm and it's different from site to site, but I can, the things that you can normally control are the labour and how they're used and the plant and how it's used. You may not be able to I, I, I haven't, I haven't put sub-contractors down there. Well they might be, they might be er labour-only sub contractors. They might be erm proper sub-contractor. They might be all sorts of sub-contractor. Yeah? I'm, I'm just saying there at the minute and, and if you'd like to argue no, we can control the sub-contractor sometimes, then fine. Yeah? And you can do sometimes because some of the sub-contractors you'll come on, they'll come on and they'll act more or less like your own labour on some sites. Yeah? Yeah, yeah yeah. So, I, I, I agree there but subbies really could come on I think you've got a very, very narrow view here, here. You've got a very narrow view of life. Yeah? An exceedingly narrow view of life. Yeah Yeah. Erm how about this one? The actual income and expenditure for the project will probably not be known by the person carrying out the short-term programming. Yeah? Because you've, absolutely, it's all under wraps. Really a pain, innit? Isn't it a pain. Yeah? All too late! Because it, as you say, you hit the nail on the head there you've spent too much, they're on your back for spending too much. Isn't this the best thing to do with a lock them in their office? Great! Let them do that. Let them do that. No, let them do that. Let them do that is what I'm saying. I, I, I don't give a hoot what do. Yeah? I couldn't, I, I would, if, if, if the company weren't so refined I would say other things about them but I don't give a hoot. Not on tape. Oh yes, I'd forgotten that! Erm I the actual income and expenditure of a project of the project will probably not be known by the person carrying out the short-term programme. What, what I would like to say, I don't care. In order to control things properly we don't need to know. What we do need is the equivalent of what we've got in the documents which I've given to you which is some sort of allowance for every bit of control of the thing. Now that allowance would be nice if it bore some relationship to what was allowed in the estimated er, figures. Yeah? But it's actually, surprisingly enough, isn't essential as long as we can agree on an allowance. Let's, let's say we're gonna be allowed so much and then let's measure off those against that allowance. Somebody else can measure that allowance against the actual price that we've been paid, but from our point of view let's accept an allowance. I'd like that allowance to be related very much to how much everybody thinks the work's going to be er, going to cost which is initially worked out by the estimator. And you've spent some time doing this, don't you, Adam? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. You know, this is what, this is what your life's about. You, you actually, the estimators do think about these things, believe it or not. Yeah? Or they have a little book where they can look it up. Yeah. But you, but, but I do think er, right, what I er, what I think we've got is an allowance. So, if I pass my er printed overheads for this one an allowance er, is, and you were talking about it really, you were using this as though it were going to be er, your money that you'd got to spend for doing each one of those activities or each bit of work within the, the project. And, but what you were actually spending was the money on the resources. Whether you appreciated it or not, what you were actually doing when you were assigning resources and things was you were actually working out an expenditure er on resources. And these two should be comparable, shouldn't they? And that's the sort of thing that we want to compare. So, this one is sort of comparable to income, cos we're always comparing income and expenditure. Somebody said, did it mean we were making a big profit? Tom was it? Are we making a big profit? Well we, we don't whether we're making a profit because we don't know where, how our allowance related to the actual money which we were going to earn from doing the work. Because only the locked in their little room by Phil, Lucky you're on opposite sides of the room. But only the or the project manager would know what we were actually going to be made. Yeah? It might, it might've been, you, but you didn't care where it was from, did you? You just thought it was an allowance. There's nothing wrong with that. Now I assumed it was, it had come from somewhere else. So erm . where did I, I'm not sure whether I ought to be getting into this but I will. I, I, I think we've got a bill of quantities. Yeah? Which is actually broken down into several headings erm now people break these bills down into many different er forms er, for example, in major projects, I, I know that for any bill be able to tell me er how many were involved in pouring er, concrete er, on any base. Did you know this? How many er they, they know, they, they actually assign there's er, there's er a computer system which er allows you to build up the rates for doing work. Holiday stamp? Yeah we need some holiday, we'll have a bit of that in there. We'll have a bit of this type of We'll have, have a bit of that tying wire. So how much tying wire is involved in the base of the tank? No trouble. It's all there. Er, I don't know what do. I know major projects do, are able to do this. It's the estimating package. No, the estimating package, I don't know what it's called. Yeah? Yeah, it's, it's the standard one which er lot use. Chief Estimator for Estimator Director for major projects. Erm now, I'm not really into that sort of breakdown. I, I'm not really interested how many ounces of tying wire are used in the base of er, a thing, but I, they, they do have another one which groups some of these together and er will give me labour plant materials, and it's surprising how many contractors have this same breakdown er, from er, contractors might have materials and temporary materials er er, sub-contract erm what else are we likely to have? Overheads and profits. Yeah? And risk. Yeah? These sort of things five or six breakdowns. Now, and, and all these go together to provide a bill rate which is what we actually get paid, isn't it? Now, the relationship between how much labour there is, how much it's actually going to cost with labour and plant to do something, and what the bill rate is can be anything. People might've messed around with it by putting this overhead profit to risk, they might've put a negative er element in there, er they might've put a high-cost element in there, they might put nought in there, so it's very difficult to recognise that, that bill rates er from the labour, or the labour from the bill rate, there isn't a standard relationship, nowhere near. We don't what this. Yeah? It's irrelevant to us. This is how much we're paying towards Brian B M W. Sorry, Brian. Yeah? What, what we're interested in, sorry? If you've heard my comments about the knows who it is. Er, what we are interested in is what the estimators have thought we're going to do for labour and what the estimators thought we were going to, it was going to cost us for plant. So we're interested in two elements here of this multi-element We're not interest in the materials we're only interested in controllable money which I've decided that at the minute will be labour and plant. I take, I think it was your point, Alan, that we could something with sub- contractors as well. But let me just deal with labour and plant at the minute and we'll see, we can do a similar thing. So I'm only interested in that. If I can get these, that's great. If I can't, then I will have to make up my own in order to control the, the programme to work. But er those things are available on most, not all Tarmac contracts unfortunately, but most of them. Where am I going? What I'd like to do now is how do we compare the allowance and the expenditure. There's one thing we can do is take one from t'other. Yeah? Because we should be able to get our planned allowance and our do so many cubic metres of concrete this was the allowance for it. The figures that you were actually calculating, weren't you? Yeah? Some of you actually calculated those. We're doing so many er bathroom first-fix er plumbing, this was the allowance for it. A planned expenditure, I'm using these Yeah? Er, and these resources, I think, are going to cost me er, X pound for a day. So I ought to be able to work out the difference between them. Say look, I'm gonna make a profit or I'm gonna make a lost. This profit and lost is not real profit and lost it isn't real profit and lost. Well I, I, think they should be, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It might well of been. Well, no I, well, I, I'm not sure whether we have. Let, let me just continue for a minute and then, then ask a question later. Yeah? What I, what I'd like to do is, we can say that we're we can make er a profit or a loss and we can give the figure, so this might have come out at seven thousand two hundred whatever. Let's call them pounds because we're working in England. Yeah? And er, my expenditure might've been erm oh I don't know, something that I can do the sums on, five thousand three hundred. Yeah? Er and so er, look I'm gonna make a profit of nineteen hundred. My allowance is higher than my expenses therefore that's jolly good, isn't it. Yeah? If the allowance had come from somebody who'd put in a lot of thought to this our estimator here. It's nice to have an estimator represented on the course because I think that you'll admit that people do put some thought into this and the, the rates that you use for labour and plant, you try to make realistic. Yeah. Cos you're actually trying to estimate the true cost of doing the work. Somebody else can fiddle around with the figures when they tender for it, but you're trying to get a true cost of doing the work. Yeah? You may not believe this and then so it's nice to have Adam here to say yes, that's right. Yeah? Yeah. And, and, and you deal very strongly with that, so if he's saying, having, given quite a lot of considered thought to this Well, a fair amount. Fair amount. Seven thousand two there at Isle of Wight that there isn't here? Palm trees. Mm? Palm trees. Oh. There's no palm trees in Isle of Wight. . Pardon? after I'd got back. There's no palm trees in the Isle of Wight. . there are. Where doe where do they think they're going to, the Canary Islands or something? palm trees at Torquay aren't there. . All down the front at Torquay. Yeah but you know what I mean dad, it's only a seaside thing isn't it? . No but I mean it's it's no better than the seaside I mean . cheaper. Well no but I do I shouldn't say . certainly not at this time of the year. If they want to be on their own, they could go book a chalet down on beach. Yeah that's an idea But I mean, the Isle of Wight if they went straight after the reception they wouldn't they wouldn't get there till Sunday . You can't think about they don't want to be on a station come here in Newcastle. . but they have to be told. say, alright but just say yes or no. they don't er be having her fainting and taking her to into Wig er Isle of M Isle of Wight hospital. It's gonna cost him enough what for cars and the wedding and what have you. And he'll find he's not so much change will he dad? . don't come cheap. And I said you want a I said you want an usher. And he looked at me gormless I know. and Angela said, an usher's to tell people where to sit. And I said you want a groomsman. And that hasn't been talked about yet. What's a groomsman. I d well he didn't tell, what's a groomsman, but his face did. Cos he didn't know. I said,people that knock at the door and say, the taxi's ready the taxi man doesn't come and do it. Ooh. I said, Richard we're not pushing and nosing but we want doing right. We don't I thought you'd mentioned that to him Arthur. Oh I have. No problem. to keep the children quiet. Well if there's no usher, I shall do it meself. Yeah you could do that mum couldn't you. I can't be doing groomsman. Oh no. You might have to take over last minute. . Well no it can't Angela ask him somebody ask him, he can't just arrive and start doing things. It's all got to be done methodically and be too nervous . Mm? He'll be too nervous. There's nowt nervous on knocking on somebody's door and saying I Are you ready? Where's the nervo er well .. Oh no he knows and that he's still shy mum. Well there's nowt there's nowt to be shy ringing somebody's bell and all he'll be ringing, he'll be ringing here. And where else will he be ringing? Wh to fetch in s his folks are coming in their car which he says they are. Anyway I'm not bothered about their But what if it's a taxi? folks so long as Angela and Arthur get there and What if it's a taxi taxi man . Does he heck. No no. No he has a have you been married? no I mean if he's booked for the day. for the wedding. Does he heck. No no er no the groomsman . No I don't remember much mum cos I was probably with me dad remember much about it either. Well No it's the t the taxi driver never gets out . Does he heck.. Well tell you what Richard's gonna find out how many taxis there needs to be doesn't he. Of course he does. whichever. He'll have to know who's coming but as I say, I'm not bothered so long as Arthur and Angela's there and and dad . Usually usually what they do, they have one taxi for the bridegroom's people and one for the bride's people. Right. That's all it and Right, so many journeys. And er y you sort of make your list of who has to go and where they've to come from, take it into the office, and they organize it. So that it works like clockwork. Well they should Angela should be doing that lot shouldn't she. Well you don't know who's coming yet so they're can't do it can they ? Oh yes, they've got them all written down Well you can't can you till they reply. If you don't know, you can't do anything. So it's best if they go off January and then they've got time to send them back haven't they. Oh yes, January at the latest. And they can all come down. got to be done properly. could knock at somebody's door and say, Commander are you ready? Well gonna have to . they don't know . They're on about erm perhaps she's got a new outfit.. For her own for her own daughter's wedding . Erm Angela's on about nipping from the army across into West Berk. If it's a nice day, it'll be much better. Mm. what's if it's pouring down with rain? running taxi and it'll take her to reception. at the reception. there. He's a professional isn't he? Who? The photographer. 's supposed to be yeah. . She said he was a professional didn't she Arthur? What's that? . Yes. Yeah. doing er layout photographs. He's doing it as a wedding present. He's not er charging them anything like. . That's a I says, What can we give them as a wedding present? he says, I'm giving me daughter, that's a wedding present. Ee. . What? You'll have to give him a present . Wedding present. No no Great. I mean you're doing the cake for a wedding present. You're not for a wedding present or are you giving here a present? . . What? Didn't she? What the we the cake as a wedding present or are you giving her a present besides. I've told her dad to sit because people might get the same thing. I was asking her if they had a a stand for a cake, she said yes . Eh? A stand. We haven't . A what? No you. No us . No the the hotel? Ah. Have they? I should think they will have. Well you'll have to find that out Yes they usually have. Well if they haven't we'll just have We didn't Well if it they haven't it doesn't matter I'll I'll just stand it on table. have a stand when we were married. I know we didn't. They didn't have a stand when they were married. It w you used your No but if they if they had one it er it serves . It was. No it weren't No it weren't No it was on thick board. Oh yes. Oh it was lovely wasn't it. And Three tier and the basket. Have you still got your pillars. Oh I've still got me pillars yes. I've got the ones that tried to eat as well. Aha. . Thought it were icing. It were lovely that cake. I'm saying I have, where are they, do you know ? I don't know where they were. I know where they were. Perhaps Nicodemus has helped hisself to 'em. They were in that top cupboard weren't they? They were in the top cupboard at one time yes. there.. I wonder it'd cost to buy those today. . It won't be worth get cake from you. Seven and six they were. Aye. I say I don't know where she's gonna get cake done yet you can't ice a i ice a cake if you haven't got one . Have you seen mum,. cake stand, it's at the back, it's on a poster. It's a big three tier cake. And t'other week I were up there and I I was just asking woman just as a matter of interest love, I said, how much . You said, you're talking above a hundred pound there. Well over a hundred pounds. Yeah . Yes they are. Yeah. Well She says in fact, you're talking nearly two hundred pound. One cake, two hundred pounds. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Well we worked it out roughly, at about sixty pounds. Yeah. To make it. To make it, yes. Yeah. That's without decorate and icings and what have you Oh no that's the that's cake complete Yeah. apart from the ornaments. Yeah. Yeah but you're her grandparents aren't you? I mean she wouldn't get it for that cheap would she. Oh would she heck . that one outside. When what do you call 'em were here, had to pay three three sixes are eighteen, that's a hundred and eighty pound, two hundred pound . A hundred and eigh A hundred and eighty pounds. It's be. And and and if er . well he did one for Yes. They did one for somebody Even less. and they were to charged them two hundred pounds . she charged them two hundred pound yeah . Yeah. And that were only a one tier. That cake that was in the paper, there was a cake in the paper, a big square one. Yes. Hang on and it was three hundred pound. . You know, square. I'm telling you, that one that's in Co-op where cakes are, where you get your cakes from. Yeah. There's a picture of one there, I was asking woman t'other week, how much are they, she says nearly two hundred pounds. Ee. But to me it's a waste of money, nobody wants any. I've told your dad, I says,make some concoction somehow or another, a wood a wood thing and ice it, that's all you want, just the icing to look beautiful. Well I know one person as'll eat it. He loves it. Don't he. Who? Well who loves it? three tiers for three tier wedding cake for him . No but who loves it? I don't know. David. Oh aye. . He loves it. like they used to be, I don't know what to do. You're not paying two hundred pound that's a certainty but I don't know what whether to make one or not. I don't know what to do.. I know one thing I'll . Well I've told you what it is darling. Mm? You're using . I know one thing I'll not be eating at the buffet. That quiche stuff whatever it is. quiche but I don't like it. You'll have to cut down on your eggs. . I think that's the problem. I don't mind doing one in there Anyhow we'll we shall have to experiment before we start doing it. To get the recipe just right. Mm. See the fruit's dropping at the moment. Aha. But in a when you harden it, you do it upside down. And then you'd be alright. upside down. But I don't know what to do because as I say, you don't want any, I don't want any, your dad doesn't want any. No but all the other guests might like it . June reckons she doesn't li June doesn't like it. You've can't make a a wedding cake with no cherries in. Well that's one, two, three, that's four of us d didn't, that's five, Richard doesn't that's six. So why bother? Doesn't he like it either? No. Oh. Well piece of 'em but if you're only gonna be eating a piece it's not gonna be big . What's that . Sixty sixty pounds for a cake. . Educate this daughter, what's a vol au vent? I am not thick A vol au vent? Well you know what vol au vents are. I don't mum. Well it means wind in the sail. But it's a little . It's a little er Just by somebody talking I don't know. pastry. It's puff pastry round puff pastry . And you scoop the middle out and you fill it with whatever Prawns or Oh well Salad or Well. Some people put jam on them. if somebody said that to me like dad's just explained, I'd know. Well you know, you've seen them . posh names . in a lot of . No . forgotten I think. . Can I borrow this. I borrowed this one last time. . . Vol au vents are like pastry . like little cases aren't they. Mm. Little cases yeah. Yeah. You can buy them ready made. But I'm saying, you don't want any cake, I don't want any, Arthur doesn't want any, dad doesn't want any, Angela doesn't. Oh er what else, who else is there . I like wedding cake. But do you heck, you don't like you said you don't like it. I do like wedding cake but the only thing I don't like in some cakes is ch But you don't like them cherries. the peel. No you don't put peel in but you say you don't like cherries Oh I don't like glace cherries no. Well you can't make a wedding cake without glace cherries. No but you can pull them out can't you . Oh yes I'm gonna eighty pound for a cake for folk to put cherries out. say make a wood'un and ice it. And then they'll all have a shock when they don't get a piece. Or have a plain one. No you can't ice a plain one. You can't ice a plain sponge mum no can you. I mean that er A big one . at thing that was alright. It was firm. There were a recipe in for Queen's for Queen Mother's birthday cake. But it was plain . Oh the Queen Queen Mother's birthday cake. Aye that was a plain one, she must And you could put some she mustn't like fruit. And there again, she doesn't like butter-cream so w No. what do you Well it'd be unique not to have a wedding cake wouldn't it. But you can't er I'd rather have the money. You can't er fresh cream. There's really a lot of people who don't bother about wedding cakes. It's all a farce. there to see, Yeah. done on a wood wood piece, they wouldn't bother whether they got any or not. No she seems to be looking forward to Well she wa she's not looking forward to cake, she's she's looking forward to the beauty of seeing it isn't she ? Yeah. Yeah. Because er while I've had wedding cake from people and and they give you a little bit and I've said to you haven't I, well I wouldn't have bothered giving anybody this. But by when I've just had a little crumb I've said they can have the rest back. It's horrible isn't it. Mm. . It's like sawdust. yesterday I haven't for four for five years. Oh. They're getting married next year but they're not having any children for three years. Oh no. They won't have any at all if if they're sensible. But she doesn't want to say that she's not having any for five year. Cos she'll look silly if she's having one in nine months. Has she told you about Mandy? Yeah. Mm. like M like Molly John's wife, she weren't having any and then she had one and she she weren't having a any more and then another Aye last night Well I'm gonna tell you. Last night I j well David come round in afternoon and he l he'd got some tapes . So he says will you go and pick 'em up dad. So I says, aye I mean fair enough. So this one, wait at bus, she says. Well I'd just got there, it was just between quarter past and ten past and twelve were there. Well I missed it. So I'm stood standing it were twenty five to to seven before I m before I left Dock. I got five hundred, gets up to top of 's stepped off, who should be at bus stop, our Angela. What you doing here? Oh there's no meeting, I'm going up to Mandy's. Oh I says, right fair enough. No they . and walked off. Anyway she's shouting away, Dad dad dad. So I says, what? She says, hang on, I said why? I'll come with you, I said, I thought you were away to Mandy's. No I'll come with you, so she wents into town with me. And this were what would it be, about twenty to seven. . Yes it would be something like that. Yeah, so I said, I thought you were going to Mandy's. I said, anyway I said, I thought you'd fallen out with Mandy. Oh yeah, she says, but erm w w I've no sympathy. we're back friends. I says, Aye, I says, well you needn't bother fetching her to our house. to do with you. Aye, she says she were doing. Well she can't be much cop if she'd open her legs to a first date to a Dutch s sailor. That's all I've got to say. So anyway she er she got in the house and she never went out again Did she not go then? No. Oh well I said to her She said she'll see you tonight at . I said to her, Angela I said, don't you pushing your nose in asking you to adopt it. And you'll be saying yeah. No I mean she knows right from wrong she's no business to have one there has she. Well I knew where she were heading that night that day she came to our house . I mean she's only seventeen. And she were on her about and sailors and what have you and I thought, aye, I'll know where you'll end up lady and she has. I've no sympathy. no. No. No sympathy for anybody like that, they know what they're doing. They're not much cop when they can open their legs like that. And I really got angry with our Angela. I said, I don't know what you're bothering for. I said by heck you've some good friends you have. I lost me rag didn't I. Well I says to her, the way she slagged you off, I said,nowt to do with you. Ah well she says, I'm not like that dad, I can't do that to her. Well please yourself that's vicarious that's it is Yeah . But you see, as I I said to her I said, no Angela it's alright is that I said, but I said No we tried to talk her out of. she had no business to do it, she knew what she were doing and they had no business to do it. It's like abortion. Nobody saying oh what have I to do if I want an abortion. You don't have to have an abortion, there shouldn't be one there to have an abortion for should there. No. No. Anyway. get on her high horse over abortion. Oh aye. I mean be thankful she's not like that. I don't like abortions but to me it depends on the circumstances. Like an ordinary married woman or something like that, if it's a matter of life and death. No Cos there are cases aren't there where a like that and the think they're being clever. Well let them get on with it. But if there weren't any money for 'em . One parent families, there shouldn't be any one parent families. . Yes. . No. Well alright then. It won' be long before it finishes it's only Ee I tell you what Get a get a paper and write what you say most. I said what would be. First thing in the morning you say, Ooh, don't you? When you're getting slowly getting out of bed. Ooh and then you say, Oh dear oh dear. Ooh oh dearie me. And then I stand by his bed trying to crack me ankles you know I'm going Oh dear. on the wall with . She knows. And then I'm hobbling along into the bathroom. oh oh dear. oh yes. Aye yet. I should get a cup of tea now shouldn't I. It's usually me that does it. now. Aye. You get your Arthur first before you start cup of tea every morning. He does. Don't you. No. Yes you do. how he can sit there and say no. Get your teas made he doesn't get tea he gets coffee he likes coffee . Well you can put coffee in. And then er Just the same. I give him coffee. And then . Oh it got kicked into touch did that cos it too loud. Well. . That goblin. The goblin when it's ready. No it buzzes while it's on. Does it heck. Well not till it starts to do. going round when its going round. getting rid of this thing I'm not having this. Does it heck. wrong with it then. I gave it to Angela. Well there's something wrong with it them till it's running out. And then it switches off. She says it's a start she say, our teasmade and our other coffee maker with the mug. Mm. Well . And she's a she's a Jug kettle. jug kettle. Aye, she thought she hadn't got it, I says Angela I'm sure it's I'm sure your nan's got a kettle for you. Of course she has. And er and she's still got that crystal dish. Aye and Auntie Auntie Elsie's got er She said she gave me three mugs Mm. and four. So she says, er one's for Angela and one's for you. So I I said, right. Oh this . . . . And er well she gave us some towels . And she gave us these so I said, well I've given her towels, wait and give it her for next . Whatever comes on. . So she says, Right well do as you like, she says, er but there's a four and there's a three, I couldn't get two fours, so I said right. So I thought, well if they get three, that's better than none, but I'll keep the four cos there's always somebody coming here you know. And er but then I thought, no I'll give her the four . But I I'd said to Angela there were some a while back but I'd not sh shown them her. So I says, oh I says,saying what they were and she said, oh, she said, and I've got some mugs Auntie Elsie bought you and a bit after and she said,she said, there's them four mugs for Angela. as if I was stealing a mug you know. I could have cracked her. But oh she's as excited as anybody isn't she. She says she has a carrier like a like a a Christmas parcel won't it . She's getting a a carrier and putting things in for her. you don't think you want a dishcloth and you don't think you want a pan scrubber, you don't think you want which you don't I told her to get But she said set of saucepans. I mean er what else is there, oh don't just think about she says . . You're always afraid that somebody buys the same presents. Well what's it matter, they don't eat anything. Well we told her yesterday Peter, you're teaching a very interesting course to first year students called ‘Energy and Applied Physics’. Is this taken just by physics students, or other students in the university. It's taken essentially by all the engineering students in their first year, which are over a hundred students, and approximately fifteen physics students plus some overseas visiting American students. What's the idea behind the course? Is it just an introduction to university physics? It's an attempt to Do you want me to ask a different question? No, no. It's a first year course which is attempting to teach the necessary basic physics that engineers require. I mean it's really trying to make up for the differences in the coverage that students coming into the university have had. They've had different syllabuses at school and masters have in fact omitted large chunks of the syllabus to get better results in the parts that they concentrate on, so you cannot assume that everybody has adequate abilities. So we're trying to bring everyone up to a certain level in certain selected topics — aspects of mechanics, heat, wave motion. Now this can be rather boring, as for some students it will actually be going over material that they have met. Of course one is teaching new material as well, but it's the repetition of certain subjects which can be boring, so we're trying to combine this with material which sees it in application, and in fact for engineers their whole orientation is towards applying ideas and not just to learning how and why nature works — that's the question that science asks, but engineering aims to apply and harness natural phenomena. What are the sort of basic principles you teach on this course? Could you give me an example? Well, one talks about mechanics — Newton's Law, I mean is where it starts from, and the nature of work — forces moving, doing work, and the use of energy when forces operate. At the same time, one introduces the idea of thermal energy, heat, and in many situations the requirement is in fact is to start from energy in one form, such as heat from burning oil, to satisfy a requirement for energy in another form, in other words mechanical energy — the turning of a shaft — so somewhere there has to be a device which converts the heat energy into mechanical energy. That would usually be called an engine, and in a car the engine just burns petrol and produces the mechanical energy in the shaft which turns the wheels, so the course is learning about the nature of mechanical forces and energy, thermal forces and energy and of the conversion of one form of energy to another, and in the process you learn that there are fundamental scientific laws — in particular the second law of thermo-dynamics — which says that you can't necessarily go form energy in one form with a hundred percent efficiency to getting it out in another form, so this limitation on your ability to convert from one form into another without waste in fact comes into many, many processes and every day processes. So the students in fact do calculations concerned with real life situations, involving cars and engines and so on? That's right. I mean we look at the motor car and see that as a energy conversion system it's approximately eighteen percent efficient. Most of the energy is thrown out of the exhaust pipe and in heat loss from the radiator, and in a erm small losses in friction inside the engine and gearbox, but most of it is lost in this conversion from heat from burning petrol into the mechanical energy of the rotating energy. Is that a question of bad design? Could cars be designed to be much more efficient than the eighteen percent you quote? If you could burn the fuel at a higher temperature, then the second law of thermodynamics says that the conversion can be more efficient. That would mean perhaps engines might be designed of ceramic materials so you could, conceivably see engine development along new lines, and in fact there are some designs already which do incorporate ceramic materials which will withstand the higher temperatures. In ordinary cars the higher temperature is produced by having a higher compression ratio and one is used to having high performance cars which have a high compression ratio and need special grades of petrol to avoid knocking and pinking and other effects detrimental to the car, and of course that leads to the need for lead to be added to petrol to stop knocking. Yes, why aren't cars more efficient? Is it a question of economics, because if they were more efficient, that is if they used less fuel to get a given mileage, is it a question of the companies involved being unwilling to put the money into the development costs, or would cars that are more efficient cost a lot more money to buy? I think it's a complicated situation, and in fact this is one of the ideas of the course. It's to say that there maybe some rather simple scientific idea behind some idea, but in practice there are so many other constraints and limitations, but all these have to be taken into account. Now for a motor car I think you can say that the practical desirabilities of a car, and the acceleration and performance and looks are very important, one could also say that the fact that many people have their cars bought for me by the firm they work for means that they will therefore buy a larger car than they would if it was their own money that they were spending, so the market for cars is perhaps not one which is determined by energy efficiency or even optimum efficiency in terms of people's and prestige is coming into it as much as these other factors and it is determined by who pays the money. But we're trying to, in the course, give engineers and physicists the opportunity to see something right through from a fundamental simple scientific idea, the scientific concept, to its application and to the limitations which are imposed by the scientific theory and by practicalities and economics, and of limitations on existing techniques. There's a danger that in a science course one concentrates purely on how and why nature works, or in an engineering course one concerns yourself only with how to apply and harness phenomena, not to understand sufficiently the nature of the phenomena and what are the inherent limitations. This course is trying to put science and engineering together, and at the same time tackle a broad field of energy which spreads through industry into the home, into transport, and to see how everything goes together — science, engineering, economics, social and human questions — they all come in. You talked a bit about cars — how about trains? Are they equally inefficient? Yes, certainly, the original steam engine, as designed, the Richard Trevithick engine, was probably about one percent efficient. The modern steam locomotives, used until they were superseded by diesel, were perhaps ten percent efficient, and the reason that steam went out and diesel was introduced was because diesel engines are more nearly forty percent efficient. So the history of train transport has partly been a history of striving for greater efficiency and lower fuel costs — one percent at the very beginning to forty percent now with diesel. In fact electric trains are themselves very efficient, but they draw electricity from the National Grid which is produced perhaps at something like thirty percent efficiency on the power station distribution network. Is there any prospect of us having a workable electric car? We keep on reading about these, but they never quite seem to get onto the market. I think that's the same situation as with nuclear power, which has taken perhaps fifty years from its discovery to its application on a large scale. Electric cars have been with us as milk floats for many years. There they have been exploiting the advantages of low pollution, the ability to stop and restart every few hours — sorry, every few yards — and electric cars may be introduced as much for their ability to produce low pollution, low noise, and as petrol becomes more expensive and electric cars become more widespread and better engineered and more efficient and cheaper, and more socially acceptable, then I think we will see electric cars. You said that it takes a long time for development between the first idea being mooted and a workable application of the particular physical principle, and you cited, what, fifty years for the development of a nuclear power station — is there always that time lag in technology? There seems to be. I think it's quite well known. We have been seeing this from the development of the transistor to its becoming very widespread now, being replaced and developed in the form of integrated circuits so now we have the microprocessor chip. This represents a continuous stage of development, from the original discovery of the transistor. I think we will be able to say that in ten years time the microprocessor will really be with us. It will be part of everyday life and that revolution will have been completed, and I think that's maybe forty years, but it's along time from the original discovery of the transistor. There's a lot of effort being put into various forms of energy transfer and energy production these days. We are all frightened that fossil fuels are going to run out in the foreseeable future, and I wonder if i could ask you about one or two possibilities. One is nuclear power stations. I suppose in the nineteen fifties we all thought that was the answer to energy production, but there seem to have been a lot of problems over these since then. Are we going towards a greater nuclear power age or not? I would expect that we will use nuclear power, but you have to get it into perspective. At the moment, nuclear power contributes approximately three percent to our national consumption of fuels, a small figure and even if we multiplied it tenfold that would be thirty percent. That would, in fact, be a huge increase in the nuclear power programme. More, I believe, than would be acceptable to people, so that nuclear power in itself will never be the solution to our energy problems. It has inherent difficulties. At the moment nuclear power stations can't be turned up and down to meet fluctuations and demand, and the fluctuation from the morning and afternoon peak demand to the middle of the night trough in demand is at least a factor of two to one, but nuclear power stations cannot be turned up and down to match that. They supply a constant load, therefore, so the user, the electricity user, has to be persuaded to even out his use of electricity, so night storage heaters are sold to people, just to be switched on at night, in order to provide a smoothing of the demand load. And of course heating your house in the middle of the night is not what everybody wants, so there has to be an attractive price to persuade people to do that and to invest in the storage heaters, hence the half price electricity. I see. How about solar energy? Any prospect of that providing a significant amount of our energy needs? Well, yes, it can provide some need, but the simplest way in this country would be use it to provide domestic hot water. Now, because of the seasonal variation, it can provide a lot of your hot water in the summer, but not very much in the winter and over a year, with a rooftop solar panel installation, you could perhaps expect to heat half your hot water by solar energy. If you then assumed that half the houses in the nation were converted to solar water heating in this way, you found find that you save one and a half percent of the primary fuel. Solar water heating may contribute one and a half percent to our total fuel saving requirement, which is very small in itself. Any chance of some of the wave energy schemes being developed to useful proportions? We've read a bit about these recently. Wave energy is attractive because the energies involved in very small distances of coast line are huge, witness the destruction of the Devon village by waves, with big boulders being flung up and destroying houses. That shows how much energy is available, and it is very attractive to try and harness this, but since the turn of the century there have been over a hundred patented devices to extract energy from the waves, but we still don't have a single commercial one operating. However, there are a number of attractive and promising schemes under very active development at the moment, but the sea is such a hostile environment — it's corrosive, force is involved for anything sitting on the surface as they are exposed to the force of the waves which is colossal, and if they are on the sea bed then perhaps there are maintenance problems, and getting the electricity ashore has not yet been solved. So I think we can say that it will be many years before we have a workable wave energy extraction scheme. Not so many years ago the country was covered with windmills. These are all gone. Is it a possible solution to go back to good old wind power in our energy search, or is that not on these days? I think wind power is perhaps one of the alternative energy sources which is erm nearest to being able to be applied and utilised immediately. However, if you consider one large modern power station, that would require approximately one thousand windmills each the size of the largest electricity pylons we see these days, and since the best sites for wind energy are on hilltops, where the wind is strongest, or around the coast, where again it's strong, this would require placing large numbers of windmills on the best hilltop views or beautiful coasting situations, and I think that would be as unacceptable as would an explosion in nuclear power stations — sorry, I don't mean a — expansion in nuclear power stations. Of course, windmills could be placed offshore, then perhaps there might be something attractive to seeing these structures out at sea at some distance — they could even be beyond the horizon — but they thought that they are whirling round usefully providing our energy I think could make them acceptable, and there is no doubt that the worldwide research and success in windmill research at the moment would suggest that wind power is within sight, but the economic investment and the problems of siting certainly mean that it will be only introduced gradually. We should do that one again . Do you want to talk again about windmills? Maybe we should do if you want to ask the question again. Are you sort of winding them down? No, no. I think it was just that one. I just got a bit erm mixed up in it. Okay, well shall I do windmills again just as Yeah, unless you want to go to another one then just come back I'll come back, I'll come back to windmills. erm Incidentally, erm have you got enough on the course itself? I erm possibly, have you got a lot more to say about the course? There's one thing that I — whether you want to discuss the seminars, I mean this is something The teaching method? Yes, something to do with whether science is fact or not and the need for discussion. Okay, I'll slot that in and we'll do that. What I was going to do is to go on and talk about, bring out electricity again as something which crops up. I would say something along the lines of you've had several, talking about several ways of energy production, but once you start talking about energy transfer and storage one seems to get to electricity fairly quickly and do you want to say anything about that? erm yeah, we could do, we could do. Yes, I mean certainly storage, I mean is important. One can say things about that. We've talked about various types of energy production, various methods of producing energy, there then is the problem of energy transfer and energy storage, where we seem to be talking almost solely about electricity. Is that the only reasonable way of storing energy and transferring it around the country for example? Storage is quite fundamental. Transport, for instance, requires that every car or lorry can carry its fuel with it, and petrol is in fact probably the most ideal fuel from almost every aspect. In terms of the weight you have to carry around, it is a light fuel. In terms of the concentration of energy, it will occupy the smallest volume, and I don't think it's and accident that we use petrol. So transport requires stored energy. Electricity for transport requires batteries. Lead acid batteries are just at the moment very heavy compared with petrol, but there are many alternative types of battery being researched. Quite exotic in some cases, but I have not doubt that some of those will ultimately be used and be commercial, but energy storage comes in every aspect of use of energy. We have at home our coal store, or our central heating fuel tank. These are our personal energy stores. In the old days factories used to have huge coal heaps outside in their yards. As we've in fact transferred to oil, those coal heaps in many cases have actually been cleaned up and build on, so as oil runs out it perhaps will not be possible to reconvert back to coal use in some factories simply because the space for storage won't exist. In houses for heating it's conceivable that you could have a huge hot water store in the basement, or a store made up of round pebbles, heated by hot air, which you could then use by circulating cool air through them to produce hot air at other times. That, in some cases, that has been explored for the storage of heat in the summer which you would then use in the winter, but everywhere one comes back to storage nuclear power stations cannot be turned up and down quickly at the moment, so either with electricity you have to have a uniform demand for electricity, or you have to, say, burn gas to provide an alternative way of generating electricity which can be turned up and down at will. In fact, gas, of course, is such a valuable fuel — it can be piped to people, in other words it's easy to distribute — it can be stored, by compressing it in tanks — in fact the national storage of gas at the moment which helps you to meet fluctuations in demand is the thousands of miles distribution pipeline, some six feet in diameter at sixty atmospheres in pressure, full of gas, and the volume of gas stored there is quite adequate to meet the fluctuations in demand. I suppose a couple of centuries ago most of the commercial production of energy, if you could call it that two centuries ago, was via windmills and perhaps watermills, but why don't we go back to wind power? Surely we could get rid of some of our fuel problems by setting up some windmills? Yes, I think erm windmills are on the threshold of being reintroduced. Much worldwide research has been quite successful, so that amongst all the sources of alternative energy wind power is perhaps the nearest to being exploited commercially again. However, if you want to replace one large electricity power station, you would require approximately one thousand windmills, each the size of the largest electricity pylons at the moment, and the best situations for the location of these is where the wind is blowing strongest — that is on hill tops or around the coastline, and there would be obvious social objections to putting large pylons, or windmills, on all the best scenic locations in the country. They could, in fact, be located offshore in shallow water, and lying on the beach watching these large structures with their whirling blades in the murky or hazy distance might be quite satisfying thought that without doing anything they are just providing the nation's energy, or some of it. However, there will be a time lag. It's not they have not yet been developed to be wholly reliable, and there are problems to be solved to do with the fluctuation in the wind power, but I think perhaps some of those are exaggerated. It's very rare that there is no wind over the whole country, and to some extent when the wind drops so does the demand for fuel. I mean there is extra heating requirement in buildings which are cooled much faster when they are subject to high winds, but I think we can see these coming up in the next ten, fifteen years we will start to see these. The aspects of energy that we have been talking about this evening erm are part of your course, are they discussed in this form by the students taking your course? Well we do have erm some discussions seminars where between ten and fifteen students are able to discuss matters relating to the course. Some of these are scientific matters, and in fact their skills in the use of these scientific matters. Some of them can be issues relating to these energy matters that we have been discussing, and in fact one of the aims of introducing this form of discussion is that science is often seen as a very factual subject — that you just receive and learn the facts. If, in fact, you ask fifteen students for their version of the facts and their interpretation, on most occasions you'll get about fifteen different answers, so in terms of the learning process there is much need for discussion for and a better understanding. If you've ever tried to explain something to somebody, that's a very reliable way of revealing to yourself that you didn't understanding something that you thought you did understand. Trying an idea out on somebody is a very good way of exposing flaws in your argument, and in fact if we look at the present energy debate, so much of it is concerned with interpretation which one would have thought, taking a simple view of science, were just factual matters that we realize that this discussion of science is perhaps more difficult than people would imagine, so there is opportunity in the course to try and help students to become more fluent in scientific discussion, discussion of scientific ideas between themselves, and of their own ideas about science. And of course energy is a very fertile field. It's not yet at a very developed and sophisticated level for ideas like wind energy, solar energy. That's all in its infancy and therefore is very suited to discussion of what might be and what will determine what scientific matters will take place. I think that this course is a very attractive one. I also know it's quite a popular one, because as you know, Peter, I have taught some of the students involved in the course and I know that they enjoy debating these issues mhm very much indeed. Thank you for telling us about it. Thank you for asking me. Thank you. Ken Okay, it's all yours Mike. Ordinary cars seem to be rather inefficient, but what about the possibility of electrical cars? Well, we have seen electrical cars in the form of milk floats for many years, and of course they're particularly suited to intermittent use, stopping and starting every few yards. So, it's quite clear that the electric car is a technical technically feasible form of car, however if you ask why do you want an electric car there would could be different reasons. The milk float requires a vehicle suitable for intermittent use, so does the fork lift truck. It will perhaps be, in certain parts of the world, that the need to cut down pollution is the most important factor — witness Los Angeles, San Francisco — and there electric cars are non-polluting and therefore would be appropriate to use there. If it's simply a matter of producing a vehicle which uses less fuel, however, the electric car, surprisingly, does not really offer any advantages over petrol cars. Though an electric car itself may be an inefficient machine, with a battery, electric motor and transmission system, all of which are individually efficient, the car requires electricity from a plug in the garage to charge up its batteries and the Electricity Generating Board and Power Stations are themselves inherently inefficient and they perhaps introduce a fact of only thirty percent into the overall conversion of primary fuel, that is coal, oil, gas, or nuclear, into electricity. So the efficiency of electric cars is, in fact, comparable with petrol cars. With regard to nuclear electricity, however, if we have nuclear electricity, which can't be turned down conveniently, then electric cars mostly would be sitting in garages overnight recharging, and that is when the natural trough in consumption of electricity occurs and therefore the use of electric cars could help to smooth the demand for electricity. The present batteries, lead acid batteries, of course are very heavy and mean that before you start the electric car has a very heavy load to carry around. If you have very few batteries then its range is limited, if you have a lot of batteries then the weight of the load is too great, so much work and research is being devoted at the moment to the development of alternative batteries. Some are quite exotic, requiring to be operated continuously at high temperatures. However, there is no doubt that these will become commercial in due course so that we may see electric cars, especially for local running. Then for long distance use we may require garages where you can simply exchange a battery pack for a fully charged one which you slide into the car. That would require considerable reorganization of the garage and energy distribution network to provide a widespread network of battery exchange stations. So it remains to be seen whether we may have such a network, or perhaps even assuming that nearly all the cheap oil runs out, whether we might in fact manufacture petrol artificially from wood, coal, or gas, simply to provide the excellent fuel with its wonderful storage characteristics for long distance transport. We've talked We've talked about various erm We've talked about various methods of producing energy. One we haven't mentioned so far is hydro-electricity. Is that still a viable method of energy production? In this country it can never be a major contributor of energy. Worldwide, on the other hand, it is a major source, especially of electricity. However, we do have the Severn Estuary, which is one of the world's best sources for the harnessing of tidal energy. In that you allow the tide to come in and then effectively close her down, so storing the water at the high level of the tide and you let it out through turbine generators when the sea is low, and the water running out, therefore, generates electricity. You can elaborate the scheme so that the electricity can be produced when the water is both flowing in and flowing out, and you can have extra divisions to ensure that electricity can be produced at all hours of the day or night, regardless of the condition of the tide. However, if you ask how much energy would damming up the River Severn to make a tidal energy scheme how much energy how much energy would that contribute, then it would probably only contribute three gigawatts the equivalent. Yes, how big is a gigawatt? The equivalent of about three large electricity power stations. So our potential for hydro-electric and tidal power is, in fact, limited. It is, however, used at the moment in North Wales and being considered in Scotland near Loch Lomond, as a method of storing energy. One takes a high level reservoir and if there is more electricity available than the demand requires, then some of that can be used to pump water up into the high level down. Then at peak hours the water can be allowed to run out through hydro-electric turbines to contribute to meeting that peak demand. So much of the hydro-electricity around the world is, in fact, used as a storage of energy, and at present there is a scheme under discussion round Loch Lomond for building a high level dam and storage system with power station in a region of particularly scenic beauty, of great importance to the Scots. So one sees how the simplest idea of a very clean form of fuel can still have environmental disadvantages, and I think there will be a considerable debate as to whether that Loch Lomond hydro-electric scheme will be built or not. Is the energy demand in this country still increasing, or has it levelled out nowadays? The domestic energy demand has remained constant for very many years. The demand industrially of course, has to some extent followed the fortunes of the national economy. In electricity, the shortages of the sixties led to a considerable investment in new power stations, so that at the moment we in fact have far more electricity power stations than we need. Of course if there was a sudden upsurge in industrial activity and demand, that situation could be reversed, but international trends clearly don't suggest any dramatic increase in industrial production, so we have an excess of electricity demand at the moment. Transport, of course, is tending to increase all the time, but there could be, and almost certainly will be, a trend of smaller motor cars to make better use of fuel by having less consumption. I'm just thinking now. There's some very interesting figures you see about. In fact domestic demand is quite interesting. Though we feel ourselves to be much more comfortable now than we used to be, there has been very little increase in domestic fuel demand over fifty years or more. In the old days we used to have very inefficient coal fires, burning in open grates, which to produce a reasonable heat used a significant amount of fuel. We replaced them by closed stoves or by central heating boilers, which were so much more efficient that they essentially have used the same amount of fuel and we have simply become more comfortable in the process. We don't require much more energy for cooking than we ever have, because our demand for cooking is essentially determined by how much we can eat. On the other hand, as we have changed to electricity, because of the inefficiency of the electricity generating process this has reflected an increase in the primary fuel consumption by the nation for domestic purposes, and this is true of most western countries that the consumption in the home has not increased, but changing to electricity increasingly has led to burning more oil and coal nationally to produce this constant home demand. Peter, as you know, I've taught this course, tutored some of the students in it, and I find it myself a very challenging and interesting course if only because the students are always unearthing new facts and figures about energy which catch me by surprise. Quite apart from the fact that they find it very interesting, I think that people outside the university would be pleased to know that a course of such down to earth practical is taught in a place which they sometimes regard as being rather airy fairy. Thank you very much Peter. Thank you, Brian. Thank you. Stephen you're doing research at university into processes of comprehensive schooling. I wonder if you could tell me something about this. Well what this has involved me in has been a long study of a single school. I spent two and a half years working with a single comprehensive school, looking at the change in that school from a system of streamed teaching to a system of mixed ability teaching. Because of the way that the school changed over from having a system of streaming in its first three years to a system where mixed ability is introduced year by year from the first to third year, I was able to follow two groups of pupils through the school, one lot of pupils in their streamed classes and then another lot following them on in their mixed ability classes, and try and discover something about the differences in their experience of school in the two different modes , in the streamed and the mixed ability classes. What were your general conclusions? I think the general point would be really a favourable impression of mixed ability teaching. There's a lot of worry, I know, among parents and also advisers, local authority people, about mixed ability teaching, about its impact on standards. I think the one clear thing to come out from my study is that with very careful preparation and with adequate thought about teaching reference, that a school can successfully go over to mixed ability teaching without any necessary impact on the standards of performance of the pupils. And this has really been justified recently in the ‘O’ level results of pupils who have now been through the mixed ability system and finished their ‘O’levels in the school, and they performed well — in some areas better than the streamed pupils did previously. What about the brighter children? Don't they suffer? Well again this is certainly a worry that is often talked about in terms of mixed ability teaching. The school was aware of this and specifically created a post of responsibility for the brighter child and gave this to a senior member of the staff, and that member of the staff was responsible for looking at the effects of mixed ability teaching on specifically identified brighter pupils, and I don't think the school would say that they totally solved the problem of what to do with the brighter child, but I think it's a problem which exists even in streamed classes, because the sort of pupils we're talking about are pupils who are exceptions in their own right — we're not talking about whole groups of pupils who previously have been in top streams, we're talking about half a dozen/ten individuals in any one year group and they are equally as difficult to deal with in a streamed situation. In some ways mixed ability, with its orientation towards individual approaches to learning, provides the possibility of focusing more on those children than even was possible in the streamed situation. So I think the school is in a position of wanting to think more about the problems of the brighter child, but they were not unaware of it and were attempting to deal with it. Yes, your conclusion is based surely on rather a small sample — two classes from one school? That's right, although the examination results were taken for each cohort. I looked at one, well in fact two classes in each year group in detail because I really wanted to focus very closely on how the pupils experienced the school in the different modes of grouping. What has happened previously in a lot of educational research is that large samples have been taken. We know something numerically about different systems, but we know little about them experientially, we know little about what it feels like, what the impact is upon individuals in the two different systems, and I really wanted to swing to the other type of research and look in more detail at how different pupils would respond to the stream situation, not simply in terms of their performance measured in tests, but in terms of their attitudes to school, their attitudes they want you to hear But how do they vet it? Do they just say bad things, or do they just say good things? No they show only what they want to show, so if there's something they don't like they won't show it Mm so you don't actually get a true version of what happened So, no you won't know that we're trying to get the two pilots out of er Libya Libya and the only thing they would, they would tell us about is what's happening in Iraq, there Did you know that erm, who was missing Arrorat Arafat they actually sacrificed their lives didn't they? They died didn't they? They dived into the sand didn't they, so he would survive at the back of the well when the, the UN people, was it the UN people, were trapped in the raft Oh yeah he wasn't going to let them go, I mean we weren't told any of that on the news, there wasn't a word of that, it only be that from the papers that we'd got there's no problem there, erm, but because we don't actually have a radio that gets us the World Service, the people didn't know what was going on, the only thing that we knew was that the air, because Riyadh is a military city Mm and there's a big air base there, where the big spy, the A W A C spy planes come in and out all the time and they worked constantly and the were going in like and there was a lot of military aircraft to be stocking up again because they thought they'd have to go in Did you get you don't actually it's just all goes up and it goes down, no one actually tells you but you can tell from the amount of aircraft and they train all pilots there as well so yeah I think so if I put those on there would you like to pass them out and then I could refill that's right Dolores a little more red? No thanks I'm fine John a little more red? Just a drop, lovely it's a nice blouse Penny Thank you is it Marks and Spencers'? No it's erm What do you do? So that it's like erm, a dough Yeah what you break off pieces don't you? It's not it's sort of Oh you cook and then you break them off the rest of them Well no, you, you sort of mix it all up and it's like a, a piece of dough, it's like, it's like a pastry Yeah inside it rather than and you just break really, oh no I'd never thought that would work cos I thought that would You don't believe have to be a very low heat you know for microwaves Yes yeah I mean tt meringues it's amazing not that I'm a meringue fan of course, but erm I like the pastry, shortcrust no, I'm not a bundle on I tell ya, I just, I just had this sort of yearning for chocolate, ooh no I'm not no when I am I can't eat anything, if I was like that I just couldn't bear to be even in the same room as anybody who's eating, so no the urge of chocolate is possibly to do with fat we did the technology this morning anyway Oh were you alright? Well, the end results you can't get blood out of a stone can you? No I could hardly believe that there's nobody on level three mm and you see we done the Easter eggs and they can't join in, I have to say no, it's a shame you know the and I can't even help them with that It's very hard for one or two of my small ones but it's alright if you're not doing the yeah that's right I just give them a little you know er some of them they did a five piece jigsaw easter egg things that when they take them and an envelope to send them off to put it in, so when they take it home and fit it together it says happy easter. Katie cut hers up into five hundred pieces More detail and I said you'll have to fit it together again and she said I can't they were all identical squares with squiggles on oh what a Put together yeah don't worry John I feel fine famous last words I think it was just a bug and I think it was caused by There seems to be an awful lot of people in this staff room today how much wine did you have? Julie but she's It's still gotta be the yeah it's so diffi I mean, alright we're, we're gonna be okay because we're and we've, we've a steady occupation etcetera etcetera, but we just turn er, er, you know we're just blind to these people who've got nothing and there's more and more people have got nothing Yeah and we don't see it and it's disgraceful that for another five years they're going to get even less and less I know, but we don't see that do we? No, I don't know how some of them and you know, I mean I know I'm a Geordie, Geordies are hard workers, I mean they're noted for their hard work and it's, it's horrible because they've always, they always suffer Yeah when there's any recession they're the first ones to lose Yeah out. the North East they've always, they've always They've always been a precarious, yeah, I mean me dad used to work down the shipyard and you know you'd live in fear for when they would close the yards down Oh yeah and it happened so regularly all the yards being closed and you'd just be laid off and no keep going back to mm You'd have one sense but when William the Conqueror came I think it was What windows? when he became the gaffer Yeah, do you want the windows closed? but most people Do you want a window open? Anyone because erm the North East was so far away I think they was oh no I've never heard that, no Yeah, er and was certainly he, cos he was a and er, you know I always thought that you see when the, er Normans came and you had the yeah they could and enter Scotland and a lot and then a lot came back from Scotland down to North and there was That's right relatively lush compared to London and Scottish Oh yes, aye the Normans and I think you've gotta I think there's lush and they've always had this complete divide, personalities apart from anything else you know Yeah mm, oh think that's got something to do with it mm, yes, maybe exactly like well you can be on another planet you know Yeah maybe North of Watford and you've had it couldn't you? Yeah It must be worse for the Scots who thank you Nationalist, they blame Labour for that for taking their votes away, mm they did very well in Scotland from what I've heard well did better than they thought they would Yeah I think I despair of the society if voted come I'm gonna emigrate now Hmm it's just, this lot have voted for them again, I'm going what are the red ones? erm, do you think it would, the company provide a photocopier at their school, they have an stuff on it and they have to have a pin number, so you put your pin number in and then it tells you exactly how many copies your pin number has copied That's what I was trying to tell you about It only costs a thousand pounds to get me it would be a lot easier Yeah if it was a machine and you can only use your own pin number you see to do everything I have enough trouble trying to remember my Nat West one do ya mind? You'd be putting in your Nat West one do, do, do, do, do sorry no money left Mrs or you might be tempted to put if it's just one, one to ten or something, you might be tempted to put the wrong number in Pass them round again so I can try one of the other ones this time The little ones this time that was nice this one falls out of your mouth you just need a couple of days to Dave and Julie have got this incredible new kitchen Yeah which, Julie still cooks everything straight from Marks and Spencers on it, I mean you only dirty the bowl, I mean you don't even dirty the microwave Oh that's a good idea, fine by me Mm Who's making your kitchen? I've got my kitchen, it's in my drawing room it's a Martin kitchen Martin goodness me he's a They've expanded If you, if you can visualize it's a long, as you're going in towards me, you pass the hotel then you come to the shops, on the left hand side about the third shop along Oh is that it's in there Mm, scrubbed pine? It's, it's maple Oh it's solid maple, it's got no chipboard inside oh the cupboards are brilliant it's just the fronts are so dated and the man in these reports in the house said erm, kitchen is satisfactory but it needs updating and it was only about seven years ago it was brand new, no, not seven, have we been in then, no eight, so nine or something, I know the fronts need sorting out. Get new doors for that I know, that's right, there's nothing wrong with the casings nothing People who live diagonally up the hill when we moved into and we could because the backs come together we could see the kitchen which was it was quite a nice one Mm and everyone has changed kitchen Has changed kitchen has taken it out what a waste of money,sa sa this guy was saying who did, who did the kitchens said he said all the actual boxes are identical and they're really good quality made and you can tell it's, it's a that was the fronts, I never liked them when I moved in Elaine how many erm film, how many film slots are on this film? Is it thirty six? Cos we're onto number thirty one now It's alright so have you got another film or shall I Yeah I've got another film I was going to try and take a photograph of er lot of 'em so I'm gonna try and yeah maybe I could get two on a film, oh, eh, I don't need to use every single one do I? I just need er, some that I think are on level five and some of them I think are there all the children went there, I said it was kind of insulting wasn't it? Oh yeah I felt insulted actually she's going Oh it's a nice school Self control A couple of weeks ago The day we were going out Oh the day of the trip going out to erm Derbyshire oh is she still going on about it? She, she really feels very vehement about it about it, I think it's because Steven lives across the road, do you not you know the boy in her class er in class that used to come here Yeah er Mr said to me he said if you don't behave yourself lad you'll go straight back to the it's funny erm oh what a classic child, yeah I've never, ever My, my little room, my box Well erm, what do ya realize when you actually get your own badges and have a look at it, it's something like eighty five percent of it is taken up with and there's nothing we can do about that. Which was really what Len said originally wasn't it? There wasn't enough money that's actually worth arguing about There's a little tiny bit to tinker with, but it's not if we were to, we, we're canvassing at pressed about altering the length of the lunchtime break to break it down from an hour and a half and an hour and a quarter to an hour and a quarter to an hour which is being we would save some money on not paying our Mm, well the government might get in our way now, that they've all elected back in Mm to er have an after club er school activities where Monday sixteenth May Monday nineteen eighty three. Mr Tommy Inverness. Can I ask firstly Mr when you were born? August the sixth nineteen twenty nine. Now was this in Tormore? In Tormore House er by Lochassynt. In Sutherland ? In Sutherland. That's correct. And how long were you in fact there? Well up until the time I would be about eight years old when my father decided there was a change in the estate then and it was off to Argyllshire Dalmally that Sir Douglas and Lady as she was then decided to go and wanted my father to come with him. But him being from up there and my mother also and their people were still alive which was my grandparents on both sides they were very reluctant to sort of go. But when a job came he he would be wanting a diff different shooting ground in in Argyllshire comparison to the hard rocks of Sutherland. Mm. Pine pastures green to the tops of Ben Dorain and and up Black Mount where the Craig estate took it was it was in their estate. So therefore my father was very keen to go too. Mm. And that's how we decided to go. So Dalmally I should safely say was my first schooling. Even though I was about eight and a half. Mm. Now your father was the the stocker at Tormore is that right ? Yes he was the stocker at Tormore. Who was he employed with then? Well the estate er er er the Duke of Sutherland had the whole of Assynt and then h General Stewart who was born in Nedd and worked and made his fortune if it was as you would say in Canada on the C P R. Canadian Pacific Railways and he was able to take a lot of people from the place he was born in out to Canada. Mm. What d'ya recall of your early days with your father at Tormore? Pardon? What d'ya recall of your early days at Tormore with your father? Well he was a very active man my word he would soon go right from the house to the top of as you would say because we had sheep then. And if he saw a sheep that shouldn't be where they were and the gentry about to come within days he would soon get them down. Mm. Without a collie dog. And well I remember hearing about it and and saw it probably as I grew up myself. So he was and it had it's Tormore House was really a lovely place. Did the did the gentry come fairly frequently to the estate? Yes. Oh they came up with their servants all servants up from the south by train to Inverness and then a charabanc or vehicle of such that was in it then because it was only metal roads we had then. But they were good metal roads that took all the traffic. Well I remember at that time the steam roller that was just doing the road outside Tormore House and many's the day I was trying to get on it with a very good friend of ours that's now dead. A Hugh . No relation but a great friend of ours. He was a steam roller driver. Mm. And were the gentry in er Lochassynt Lodge or was it Tormore? No Lochassynt Lodge. That's right Lochassynt that's right. And my mother er went to help them in the lodge in the season time also. Fr from that time can you recall any incidents which er your father may have mentioned to you even as a young boy? Well Or stories about the the people that were there or Well passers by? ah well yes the passers by will will remember being on the road side the famous tramp. Aha. The gentleman of the road. My word and me just as a little boy of eight years. I was no fear of being frightened of them because they were part of the establishment. And well did the gentry know that too. You mentioned that you were perhaps more scared of er ministers. Well yeah ministers er. When I think of it nowadays and I see children so very going round to the various churches that when people used to say about ministers well. When you heard there was a minister coming I was just afraid and looking to see would you see that dark black clothed individual coming. And even that seemed a but thinking of the old tramp and he was in a a sort of all belaggered looking way. My word but you weren't frightened of him because you were told that he was an old man and one of the road men of the road. And there was no fright to be taken from him. Is it correct to to say that the tramps actually used to make a special point of coming to to see your father ? Oh yes. Made a special point of coming there because they knew my mother would give them a bowl of soup or what was ever on. She was baking fresh scones hot cakes anything that was going. And my word they enjoyed it well. They wouldn't come in they wouldn't come into the porch even. They would sit outside wait in that days we had a seat out in the and even if was a seat for sitting outside they would sit on their own way or on a rock. No they just had their own way of life and you wouldn't change it and they had stories to my father. They would tell sing where they came from and who they saw and all the way up they came. And they would be looking for a bed for the night and it would be in the old hay shed that we would put them but there wouldn't be a problem. It was in the winter time so it was full of hay but they would be very careful and we would ask them that they had no matches in case er there was no cigarettes much and that but pipes they were pipe smokers. Old clay pipes with black twist. But they would soon tell that they would have their before they would go to bed and thanks er very much when getting the bed and you could er vouch for that they would never. But the odd one yes we saw the odd one but they were very odd. Aye they were very odd. Y you refer to them as mile stone inspectors. Mile stone inspectors and gentlemen of the road. Mm. And there's a story about the late Duke of Portland when he was travelling up to to estate where his lodge was. There was many's a tramp that would have taken the A nine then but this one in particular and he was very very fond of him and he would ask when he was around to that he would get over to see him. And when that poor tramp perished out on the roadside one severe winter or spring time the Duke found out where it was and to this very day there's a little mound and a stone put on it. That was the er Lord of Caithness I think Tommy that the stone was. Yes yes that I'm referring to yes. The Lord of Caithness. I cos I can't picture another stone you know on any other roadsides and I've been on plenty that and I travel and no and I can never know of another st stone that was put up to a tramp. Anywhere in the north as far as I know. But that one was and I heard a year ago but I never saw it till the bus driver I went with some years ago up to John O'Groats. Mm. And going up to to John O'Groats and right into past Castle May where the Queen Mother has and into the church where sh where the royalty goes when they're living up in up in Castle May At er well er Johnnie Groat is buried there too. There's many a person Johnnie Groat to my name. From these young days that you spent in Tormore can you recall how the tramps actually looked? Oh they they How would you describe them? Erm the tramps? Well fearsome looking wild looking as you would say it now. But but the very opposite to what people would er er th think of them as regards people now. And that's ordinary people. But but they looked wild because they would have long hair beards a and and all oh my word they were wild looking but er. And probably it was cold weather they would have two or three coats er you know. And jackets probably below and their little bag of stuff. Whatever they were carrying. They they generally came all year round? Yes oh yes generally came. Ah but they always watched th they would be in some place over bad storms you know. Er er er you know if there was a bad storm somebody would oh you better stay here today too again and he might be there three or four days. So he would still stay there because he was told about the weather. And he would know himself. Mm. You see it's not what er anybody else would say that it was good weather. He they knew that they had a great sense of the weather themselves after being out in it. Did they ever mention to you or your father that they in fact got caught out by the weather? Oh well sometimes yes they would be very wet when they would come. And when they would offer to no no they wouldn't they would have their own way of drying it in in their bags they would have another clean or or you would say clothes to put on but we never ever heard of them doing a washing . Mm. Or whatever. Well they would be discarded. It's it's like I I better not say say this but Irishmen over that when when I when I used to work with Irishmen my word they was good Irishmen. Very good friends of mine. But they would work they would never see them with dungarees. They came with a good suit on and they would go to work with a suit double breasted and then and they would work there and make a lot of money and when the next thing they would do they would hit into town and get all rigged out and then that was them from top to bottom from their hat right to their feet and then they were hitting the road then. Yes I could say that that's true about Irishmen. Mm. The the tramps never mentioned some of the places they were actually forced to stay whether it was under a road bridge or? Oh oh yes they yes they would stay under a road bridge too because you would see the er er if you would look a a bridge and they would say oh there's a tramp there's a place there if you could tell me and you would see the rocks put up and where the bed was always above water level oh yes. Mm. Below the certain bridges. Mm. Depending how far away a house you see was and how they would be. But never two of them meet together. We we you never know that. They would be always er passing. They didn't go round like that they were very loners as you would say. And what happened say They would never were there ever occasions when there was one or more in your hay loft? No no I don't think ever I can remember. I th well I think er there was once or something but he he passed he didn't know that this er was so then they passed on. Mm. You see one stayed but he was there before him and the other one carried on. No they would never they would never blend together. Mm. Like whiskies blend . No no they would never. They were they were very very fine people. And and the tinkers that came there. Mhm. Er wouldn't want to but from from there was there was one lot. And there were and the women folk would have their haberdashery and the men were tin smiths. They would make pails and basins like you were being requiring in your sc er scullery or in the milk house as you would keep milk there. So they were all and very industrious looking. But they had for the winter time they their houses to go to. Mm. And they were just coming round in the summer. Mm. And their horses and my word they fairly looked after their animals mhm. Did the crofting people have any special name for the the tinkers? Not really no. You've never heard the term summer walker? Er er no no I could never say that. Or mystery folk or? Er well Celts. as the years came on they were beginning to get mystery fo folk but er not in my time. Well that sort of people that was coming. If ones came as in little wee pi pickups we called them the little lorry things you would sort of keep your eye very much because you didn't know they were looking for scrap and if you told them you had nothing they might go away with your iron gates or something. This was during the mid thirties? Oh yes I would say that yes that was coming more that way yeah yeah. Coming more that How about the individual er tramps? Did you ever have bye-names for these characters? Well th th there was one Joe Wrench. Er but I don't know what's that. But somebody so told me aye and I said that was a funny name or was it else's then. Well I said I remember a man called Joe Wrench and but er oh I wouldn't er but one said oh Joe Wrench is very black looking. Well the bugger is just coming on and he was cleaning the car down hosing her car so he says I turned the hose on him. Well the hose landed on him alright but it landed on his parcel and it the whole thing fell out on the road. So there was a bit of Mm. among the few people that saw that happening. But er he was quite a character the man that did that. Did you ever have an opportunity to to see what the tramps actually carried with them? No well I could never say I I was kept well away out of the but my father probably might have seen Mm. in his bag. Well I think it would be a change it's when they're when they're when they're jacket would be wet they would have another Mm. jacket in the bag. So whatever he and if he was dumping anything oh er er they would ask the father said er just er to dump that. They wouldn't be left with a whole pile of stuff or er. No oh no they or they would dump it in a place where nobody would see it you see. And when they were coming along Lochassynt were they making for anywhere in particular? We we well er er see they were on their rounds and then they'd be going round by Nedd and and probably Scourie they were just doing their circular. Aye they had their places for. Yes it's amazing aye. And did you have ever a chance to gain some sort of insight into their backgrounds? Who they were in fact? Where they'd come from? On some cases yes because I was always told this man he that used to come and he was so clean looking and that he was a barber. Well that er er er an Englishman that he was trained as a hairdresser. As a man's hairdresser. But somebody er whatever he no he didn't carry anything to to do that no. But that's what he's he told you? Oh yes but he told somebody that he was a hairdresser. And you would see that they were very some of them intellectual people. Mm. Too and who knows how they went to the road. Mm. Did they fail in their exams or something or went to drink or. It's said nowadays about drink but I don't know. They they were quite er learned men they weren't numskulls you know. Mm. So something just peculiar at that very time put them to the. Did they ever do any form of casual work? S some of them did yes if they came in the springtime and then in the ar in in the harvest time. Yes oh some would w w work but some wouldn't. Er and if if they would work they didn't want money for it but they would stay a while with you so that they would get their bed for the night and they would get their grub. Mm. What type of work did they ? Well they would take in er er er they would er er and they would put hoe potatoes you see when that was coming on that time. And they would help to lift potatoes and they would er stack corn and hay. Oh yes and that's those only that would do it but you wouldn't get the ordinary man taking any he would just be on his rounds. And you wouldn't say oh I think it's going to be wet today John you better stay. Not him his his mind was made up on going and that was it. And were you visited by the peddler the pack-man character Yes. who sold goods Oh oh yes er er who who sold. Er there was one chappie that er erm I can remember of him and he had a suitcase and well he had a shaving soap I suppose cos people used soap then with your shaving brush and and that and proper shaving brush and razor blades probably that quite. Yes but I remember right a . So it was things that wasn't too heavy to carry but things that was always needed in a house and that you could run out of. When we were er were living all on the road so we were expecting to be supplied by vans. Mm. And my word there was plenty of vans in them days. Both getting butcher meat. What even in the thirties? Yes oh yes er er when we had a wee baker's van coming up from the Nedd to Lochassynt when when Lochassynt Lodge you see. So these people that had little private shops in them days did well because when the people came to the lodges it all the commodities were bought to as well as them. It's not like nowadays when people has big fridges Mm. buy their stuff away down south and take it. But no they would buy it there aye . So provisions were bought fairly regularly in those days. There wasn't the same er bulk buying that you see nowadays ? No no there wasn't the same. But only well we would get it buy it in bulk ourselves supplied by er Hamiltons of Glasgow Mm. and it would be coming on the steamer McBrayne's steamer and Up to Lochinver? Yes to Lochinver yes and that same steamer would be calling in Kinlochbervie and all the villages and this traveller for Hamiltons would be going round beforehand and you would be getting a hundred weight of sugar and tea it would be in a big tea box er er probably er er Ceylon coming from Ceylon but you the whole or you could buy a small quarter. But oh yes you would buy all that stuff in bulk. Mm. But that stuff that was in bulk but you would never er no perishables no peri Mm. Can you recall in those days Tommy how people kept perishables? Well er er there were it was big caverns that'd be underground. If there was a big bank at the back of the house they would have a hole just dug out and er built up with flagstones Mm. and therefore it was when when you would go in there it was quite cool. Mm. Even in the Summer? Well wonderfully cool. They would they would watch where they would where they would excavate this thing out Mm. from. But yes it was wonderfully cool. Mm. And the produce was salmon ? And the prod it was it was sort of kept as within a reason of time of course it wouldn't. But er and of course stuff was salted. Venison Venison of course. you you buy er salt it away in barrels in boxes and and work on it until it was through. Now was that your father's own particular task the the salting of the venison? Oh oh oh n no really I can't say that. Er we only probably did it when ourselves we got venison beforehand on the last shooting and to keep. But no no er there was so many hinds having to be shot in the winter time and and and it would be sent away you see. But not away what they're doing now or but it'd be sent down to their premises down in the in the shooting lodges in the south. Mm. And that and to their friends. And there would be always a beast or two cut up for to be given to the village. Mm. Oh yes that was one thing. I always remember that. So where did the venison actually go to? Well it well ah but ah but they never they never killed it in that quantity as they're doing it now. Mm. To make money. No no there was no money made of it. It was just for their for their own use. Mm. And haunches of venison that was the best part in the they would be sent away to themselves the haunches. But the other parts with the ribs and all that'd be cut up given to the and the lodge itself for the. And all the estate men first of all would get everything. And all the crofters then that was paying rent. In those days how many people were actually involved on the estate? Well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths. They had to keep the river streams all flowing and if there was any deluge of rain and stones they would have to keep all the pools in good order and they would The pools? Yes the pools. That's the salmon pools Mm. you see. And they would have barriers going out so that they could so that the gentry could go out to stand on that ladies and men. To cross the the Yes just yes you see the streams . it still on the the rivers. But now it's made of stonework or or concrete. Mm. Now and that cos that's the only thing that could stand Mhm. to the weather. But er that's the way. And the and the paths repairing at the riverside and all the bushes round the lodge. And the gardener there was always a permanent gardener but he was he had enough to do but the estate men would be sent up to clear that. And painters and joiners they would have themselves. All self-contained? Yes self-contained yes. There'd be a joiner and he'd be engaged in a Right just Right, first thing, We'll make a list. I lost me prescription when he gave me, and we've been away. The, my eye I got some drops from the chemist cos my eye was bad. And it feels as if there's grit all in it now. Yeah. So you hav t haven't actually had any Eyecron No I had, I had of the chemist in Chapel because it came Yeah. so bad. Yeah. So you really need some Eyecron don't you? Yeah. I think I do with this. You really need some Eyecron Yeah. I wouldn't go to a doctor there because of this malignant thing so I just managed till we came back Yeah , well I Getting better but it's just this gritty thing in the back of my eye, I mean I Yeah. was Just er look up for me. It still looks rather boggy doesn't it? Mm. It's terrible. Er the other eye. That one Mm. doesn't look too bad but that one Just look straight at me. Yeah I, the front of the eye looks quite, Mm. It just feels horrible. Yeah. It's nothing to do with hay fever is it, this, do you think? Yeah. Cos when I blow nose, this thing,pops. It's ever so queer. There's a drainage tube,th I've always suffered with my sinuses. there's a drainage tube that goes from Yeah. this corner of the eye, to Yeah. the top of the nose. Which is Mm. why, when you cry, your nose runs. Okay, and Mm. Mm. if that is a little, that keeps blocking, Mm. when you blow your nose it will tend, it can go the Mm. other way as well. Yeah. But are they okay with leaving it for another week will I? It'll be okay with Mm. leaving it. I hope. Well I hope the Eyecron will actually get it to settle down. So, you said that was the first thing, or were, was it that were both it No that was it. I wanted to be honest and say I'd Yeah. lost a prescription. Then we went away you see? And I thought, well I'll just pop in chemist and I was hoping it would clear it up, so I wouldn't Yeah. have to confess. No don't wor But it's not. Still gritty? Yeah. So we'll see what the Eyecron does. If it still remains uncomfortable, then we, then we need to have a closer look and we may need to get the eye specialist involved if it's refused to settle down. But you can still see clearly? Yeah. Yeah. That's good yeah. I a lot of pain at the back of my eye though Yeah. while I were on holiday, it was terrible. Well it's bit brighter at the coast, and Yeah. Well we'll, we'll see what happens with the Eyecron I think that'll turn it off, but doesn't then we must have another look, very important. I'm very Bye bye. Okay. See you. Bye now. Can I give you those? Mm. there's not much on the table. Sorry. committee meeting was held on the sixth of July at two P M, the President Mrs was in the chair attendance as per register. Minutes of the previous meeting were read, confirmed and signed. The August outing is now to be to Westcliff, cost two pounds sixty, seventh of August leaving at nine thirty A M payments to be made at the July meeting. The hall maintenance erm should be commenced soon. The whole management committee of four, we decided five didn't we?. Well I should leave that because that would be right for the time. It's to be formed, so far Mrs E Mrs have volunteered to be on it. Mr was put in two new lights one fluorescent and one bulb, he was paid five pounds and costs. July the thirteenth is a coffee morning for the raffle. Due to a number of circumstances Amy feels she should not be treasurer for nineteen ninety one. Mr is to be asked to do the floor after the kitchen is finished. Twenty three leaflets or booklets are to be ordered from value for money, that's that funny one you've got there. County have sent us five draw books for a doll's house. A letter from County informing us of that nineteen ninety two subscriptions are to be nine pounds. A thank you letter received from St. Clare's Hospice for a cheque given for two hundred and eighty pounds. And a new auditor needs to be found. Four new tables received from Gopak cost two hundred and eighty five pounds. Payment for the holiday to be paid at the July meeting. Help is needed by Gwen on the thirty first July at the Victorian Fair. The meeting closed at three forty P M. . Bit wrong. Thirty first of July will be. That was a coffee morning. It's the seventh of September.. It's the eight . Oh it's the eighth is it? Sorry. Yeah . Margaret the . We'll get it right in a minute. Wonder why I put that.. Oh yes, it's the treasurer for the nineteen ninety two Margaret, not ninety one, I'll alter it. Can I file it otherwise? Thank you Matters arising, the outing. In spite of all I said I enjoyed it, thank you very much .. It was very good actually, the weather could have been a bit better but erm thanks very much for arranging it, it went very well. The tide was in. we were lucky cos it didn't start to rain did it till we got back in the coach? so that was well planned. Yes. Thanks very much Janet. The hall maintenance, well I don't know whether you've all noticed we've got a new sink out there, looks quite smart I think and you all agree the ones who've seen it? Er, I've had a word with Jeremy about decorating, oh Florrie I must apologise I did try to ring you, I think I managed to get everybody else, erm but you weren't there, in and then I, I left it I regret to say, erm but we thought perhaps we ought to have the kitchen re-decorated and I've had a word with Jereminy, Jereminy, Jeremy and he says about two hundred pounds and I did get permission from some of you and I've gone ahead and asked him to do it and he said about three weeks, but before we can have that done, in the meantime, the roof leaked again out in the kitchen Erm, so I've had a word with Peter who was going on holiday and he should be home this week and he said he will look at it as soon as he's home, so I'll give him a ring, I'll try tomorrow night, I'm out tonight, I'll try and give him a ring tomorrow. What is it again then Rose, is it the tiles off or something. Well it was off before and, and he put it back and it seemed to be alright didn't it Joan? Yes, I thought it .. You see we really need it felted underneath. Yeah. And it would stop all this problem, but I don't think we've got the money for it. No. We'll have to look into it to see if we can't manage it. It didn't go off on itself did it Rose? It's that bit in the front which I gather was an extension, am I right? Oh I don't know.. Well I think it, I think it was put on after this bit. It was built after this bit, from, from what I can make out and this is felted underneath the tiles but that bit isn't and that's why we get the problems out there, but he put the tile back but it slipped. Yes. Yes. Whether it's slipped again I don't know but he said he'll look. So we've gotta do that before Jeremy can start. Mm. Yes. Yes. Erm, then after that we'll have to look at the floor, but there's no point in doing the floor until the decorating is done is there? and the roof sorted out. Erm, Joan and Sheila very kindly volunteered to wash all the curtains in here and they've been done. I've volunteered to take the stage curtains to the cleaners and I haven't done it yet I regret to say , so my apologies, it will get done eventually, er I hope. But you won't be able to get those down Rose will you, all on your own? I mean they're heavy things aren't they? Well perhaps we can manage it on a chair , then I can take them up the Stow and put them in the cleaning machine. But he charges you doesn't he as though it's a private . Oh yes, yes . Where as at the Stow the machine only costs five pounds and you do it, you just wait for it and so we'd get these in two or three, but he'd probably charge us a lot more along there, unless someone likes to enquire what he charges? Erm. Well I'm going that way. Well I won't be able to do it till after the, the end of September, cos we've got the Victorian fair, the flower festival and Well, we'll leave it till then, then sort it all . then I'm on holiday for a week. So I'll take them then. Okay. Mm, mm. I'm sorry I didn't get round to doing it, but I did have the flu for quite a while. Erm, I think that's all the decoration and the hall maintenance. The hall. Now Edna said, didn't you say that the all the sideboards coming . Lillie , Lillie , we was playing darts on Monday, came out from the ladies toilets' and said You ought to see that skirting board, it's all coming away and rotting . She obviously uses it each week, so it's all rotted all coming away at the back of the pan. You see, I think our next priority must be that bit out there, where we, where we've got no damp course.. Because the erm, jumble sale room's in an awful state, isn't it? and Rentokil said it it went along in, into there. Mm. What does anyone else think? It's either that or the roof, we've got to do something. Well I think the roof is an emergency. Done first.. The roof has got to be done hasn't it? Mm We start getting bad weather and then we're gonna be in trouble aren't we? Mm, and I don't think bodging it up it seems to be doing the seems to be doing any good. No well I feel in the long run it's probably wasting money because erm we keep bodging it up which costs money, we might just as well see how much it is to get it and do it, and do it erm . Mm, mm . Yeah, we did have that quote, but there were other things on it. Yes, yes, I. Well perhaps we can get a new quote, you know, just for the roof and . Yes, I'll speak to Peter about it, see what he says and what is essential. Okay, will do. that's almost half the battle isn't it? Mm. Yes. Mm, mm. It saves a lot of bother I can tell you. Our Peter. How long ago was it that we paid six hundred pounds didn't we to get our roof seen to, doesn't seem all those many years ago. Yes, but that was when it was satisfactory . Well I don't know , we've had problems ever since six hundred pound and that was years ago, probably be six thousand now.. . I think the total quote he he gave us before was about four hun thousand wasn't it? but it included I think. Between three and four wasn't it? It was more than three quite definitely, ah but that included some other bits and pieces, I think with that it was over four thousand, and I don't think we've got four thousand spare have we Amy? Well we've got that amount we have got that amount in the erm building society, yes amount . Oh, we're better off than I thought. Don't want to run it right out. Oh no no. Anyhow, I'll ask him when we get a new quote. Refelt, or felting. Erm. Cos the last time we had it going up look certainly wasn't satisfactory was it? Wasn't it? It's always been a problem hasn't it? I. . What about your man? Gwen's just having hers done, she's in the throes of having hers rebuilt.. And I've got, we've got three very handsome young men in swimming trunks on top of my roof . What you complaining about Rose. And she won't send them over to me.. They're working ever so hard and I must say they were good, you know, erm, cos they haven't finished the job yet, but erm, I think they know what there about you know, and they've certainly got a lot of energy and it's a hard job.. Taking all their their er time, that's the biggest job, it takes their erm. The tiles? The top ones you know. . And, and they're all sort of preserved and they're all to bring down clean . But er, I could ask him. Well I think we'll have to get some other quotes, because Peter isn't the the roofer, he gets someone else to do it, so I think we ought to have some other quotes. Mm. Mm yeah. Yeah definitely. So will you ask them Gwen? Yes. And er, I'll come down and show them if they like. Yes, I will. Lovely, thanks very much, and Amy's just showed me our balance at the Bristol and West and it's six thousand four hundred and forty one pounds sixty five pence, so we are a bit better off than I thought. So that's lovely. Hall management committee, are there any more volunteers. I said I'll go . Will you Sheila, ah thank you, lovely. Thanks very much. Sheila will call. Sheila will go on, so that's lovely. Erm, and we had a a little meeting Margaret, Joan and I, just to go through the agenda for today, and we thought that, we th perhaps five was a better number, erm, because we thought Maisie would be on as she does the bookings, but we wouldn't expect you to do anything else, Maisie, yeah. . So, erm, and also as Joan pointed out if you've got four, if two of you want one thing and two another, there isn't a casting vote, so erm, five might be better. Does everyone agree or not? Mm. Did you get any response from the May meeting Rose? Well I have I didn't because I said that I would just tell them about it and then I would speak again this month and see what er, they say. Because we've also got to talk about erm officers and committee members. So first of all Amy you still want to resign? Yes, please. Erm, have you had for thoughts Joan? Thinking. Joan is thinking, that she might take over from me. Really. Oh. I might, I never said I would.. It's only a thought . I'm praying hard, so will you all join me. . May, may I say that when you dictate it, you did it all . Ah, but then you see Rose had written it all out . Well I'm sure the writing out of the agenda is, I, I'm not just saying it, the agenda is not difficult and I do everything I can and I will write any letters you want. Oh . So, you know whether I'm on the committee or not, I, I'd be quite happy to do that. So there wouldn't be anything from that point of view. I'm thinking.. Jolly good Joan Erm, now does anyone else feel they can't come on the committee? Me. Edna, one, two, three. Will you be on the management committee Edna? I, you know I don't mind, I enjoy handicraft but I find I'm out Monday playing darts, I'm out Tuesday doing handicraft and I look after a little boy who's got Cerebral Palsy four mornings a week and comes three in the afternoon and it's quite a lot. Mm. And you know in one week, but I'm quite willing you know just to get on with the handicraft, but I just can't be committed. So you'll do the handicrafts, I mean if, if, whoever is. Yeah, if nobody wants to do it , president I would just carry on and do it. Mm. And that, as long as they didn't expect me to turn up to every committee meeting. Mm, okay. Pardon. I'm sorry. Well, would any one like to be treasurer here? Or feel they could do it? Brenda do you think you could? No. Betty, anybody? . Margaret? Well I'm still treasurer at the bowls club and I don't feel that I want to take on two . Well I'll ask at the meeting, but I'll have to talk about it. If the worst came to the worst and we did get another president, I would do it, but I'd rather have a break for a little while. Erm, but if there was absolutely nobody else, I would, but I don't want that to get any further, because I don't want to stop somebody else. Mm. I do want a little break really and truly, but I, would do it if there was nobody else. So it's Edna, Marion and Sylvia, well thank you very much for all your help anyway. Well,. only too pleased to give it would I? I don't mind helping . Don't want to make any commitments . . Well you've got your husband and er, and. . Teas.. Yes. Thanks every so much all of you any rate. Mm Amy would you be on the committee? Yeah. Lovely, thank you. Erm, oh the raffle coffee morning I'm sorry I couldn't come, but I was laid low erm how did it go? I gather you had . Wednesday it went very well indeed, yes, I, we made forty four pounds, twenty nine pence on the day and then Betty went to Sawbridgeworth with some cushion covers and managed to sell them off for another five pounds so we got . Oh lovely . All jolly good, yes. Erm we don't feel you've got to spend all that raffle prizes, erm because we don't usually raise much more than sixty to seventy do we on the raffle? I don't think so any rate, so you know bear in mind when you choose your prizes. . Okay, lovely. That's very good though. Erm, the floor. I think we will happy we've had plenty of help you know . Mm. You know, everybody rallies round us,. Well actually I always think, Win always say that the W I runs itself because everyone gets on with things and they don't need to be told and, and when it actually comes to it no nobody wants to become president or officer.. But when it actually comes to doing work they're ever so good. It, it does sort of organise itself. . Mm. So were very lucky really. Oh I should've mentioned about the maintenance erm, we won't do anything about this floor until the rest of the things are sorted out, I think this is the least of our worries. Mm. Mm. Erm, the County draw, you said you've sold all the tickets Margaret, that right? What for the d doll's house ? Doll's house . Oh yes Good er the nineteen ninety two subs. Well I've written a letter which I'll read out to you, I haven't posted it because I think I ought to read it to the meeting and get their approval erm, or otherwise, erm,Dear Miss ,this is the General Secretary, W I subscription nineteen ninety two. I have been instructed by the committee and members of Harlow W I to write to you making the strongest possible protest about the increase in the W I subscription to nine pounds. I set out the views of the membership below. One, many of our members are elderly and managing on very small incomes and any increase in the s in the subscription is likely to mean that we shall lose members. This is particularly true in this area where we have to compete with the Townswomen's Guild which has a lower subscription and also with numerous Council-run activities, many of which are free or at a low cost for pensioners. Two, our institute has its own hall and as this is now about seventy years old and was not particularly well built in the first place, you will understand that it costs us a good deal in money and effort to literally keep the roof over our heads. We therefore have to ask our members to contribute to the upkeep by way of fund-raising activities and this increases their spending on the Institute by many pounds per annum. Three, we fail to understand why it is necessary or desirable for such a large proportion of this subscription to go out of our institute to County and National Funds. Three pounds fifty for our institute and five pounds fifty for County and National. For a large proportion of our members the activities of both County and National are completely irrelevant and all that matters is how good is the programme that is provided at local level. We appreciate the County put on an interesting programme of events, but since we are situated some distance from County Headquarters and public transport is virtually non-existent, we are unable to participate in very much. Also the cost has increased considerably, which is another obstacle. As far as national activities are concerned we have the greatest difficulty in getting a delegate to attend the tri-annual meeting in Birmingham this year and many members thought the money spent could have been put to better use. Whilst we realise that if we belong to a national organisation, there will be some additional cost to individual Institutes. Our organisation does seem to be top-heavy and in need of radical overhaul. The vast majority of members are recruited at local level by word of mouth and very, very few by the image-making publicity generated at national level. Please let us keep more of this subscription at local level so that we can provide the service that is required. We apologise for the outspokenness of this letter, but it is felt that if we are to continue as a national organisation of good standing, we must put our house in order before it is too late. Yours sincerely, Rose , etc, etc. That's great. Mm. That alright? Have you sent that Rose? I haven't sent it because I thought I must read it to the meeting. Oh. Erm lot fresher. You can take a journey of three hundred miles if you like. One guy's a bit of a teararse. Pushing on, pushing on. The other guy takes his time. . The difference in the overall running time will be negligible. All the guy who's pushing on has done is got from one holdup to the next holdup quicker than the next feller. I think that's fair to say that, do you not? One guy's got there thinking Cor! Let's go and have a fag I need something I've worn out, had a hard day's work. The other guy will rea really get out of his cab and think Well well we've got here now, go and have a cup of tea. All goes over his head. Do you think there's any value in that? Just like to show you a couple of videos now. We're talking about attitude. Now th the first one is erm What is the first one Stan? . This is er . a personal carrier. Oh no. The first one is a bloke wants to overtake. Lorry in front, car in front of him, and he's number three. And he's so desperate to overtake. And the position he goes at. You could be a lorry coming the other way. Again it's attitude. You see the lorry up the front? You see the one just pulling out? Now that was Now look at the vehicles coming the other way and there's a car in front of the opposing lorry. . What a plonker. Now he went completely blind didn't he? That lorry braked as well. The one coming the other way. Yeah. . I think he's passing two. I think he's passing them both on the same time . Mm. . Three of them. . Look at this. Now this is a van,load it's a it's a personnel carrier. A load of schoolchildren going on a day out. Now he starts to overtake, and you'll see there's a sou sign on the left, a roundabout sign they're approaching. He's go no hole to get into and pr looks there the person not letting him in. So he stays out to the centre. So again he's approaching the roundabout and he wants to go straight on, so he's completely in the wrong position. And what does he gain? Why didn't he just stay where he was behind the vehi Everyone else was taking their time. Now watch as he goes round the roundabout. . Now he's on his way now, yes let's get through here, we can't hang about here, let's get through and away. . Now as he comes out of the roundabout he starts overtaking down the offside of those vehicles. Which throws him He's got no view there has he? No view whatsoever. And as you'll see in a moment he's completely on the wrong side of the road. Now what if something had been coming the other way? Another lorry? Agai overtook completely blind. Attitude? It's gotta be hasn't it really? Mm. Just an aggressive pushing attitude. Now you'll see the speed in the bottom left-hand corner. Now this guy is er out for a little afternoon run on his motorbike. . . Now the thing is, you'll see in a moment there' some lorries. You'll see some lorries up the top, one of the being an N F T lorry. I think you might find one of the lorries is overtaking the other one. And er he's being followed by an unmarked police car. And you can see What have got up to? Oh we're just just getting into four gear now I think. . Now there're the lorries, and the see the N F T just up there going round the bend . must be going . . No that's a policeman. His hands er s he's a bit worried. . . Now he he's gotta find somewhere to go so where's the only p place that's clear? The hard shoulder. . Now as he comes in front of that lorry back onto the carriageway, if the one that was over taking suddenly decides to pull back in his mate having flashed him, the value of a nearside mirror? Mind you, you'd have to be quick wouldn't you? Cos he'd be . Look and he's gone, up through there. . Now er See all the flashing lights of the vehicles there, they're they're so incensed they're flashing their lights all over the shop at him er as he goes Mm . through. But he actually went through between those two goods vehicles. Came up and shot in and then went round. . And, additionally, there's an intersection there. You know an exit. Mm. Now you s there's a situation where that was attitude absolutely stupid. The num amount of vehicles which were around. Now this one is speed in itself. Not the erm complication of of vehicles to the extent we saw with the motorcycle film just now, but this is erm again The the police car is staying well back cos he's following this vehicle you can see a hundred and thirteen, well the speed's gets up to about a hundred and forty in a moment as you'll see. . It's a s a straightforward er an M R Two. . This is a S er Opal Senator or a Vauxhall Carlton with a Senator engine. And he's following er a Toyota M R Two. And er th th this guy . has got his nine-year-old son in the car and he's showing his son how fast his new car's gonna go. Still not making a lot of impression on this guy . . Where is it? H h he's just he's right in the distance. In fact the camera can't quite pick him out. As I say the Now what was he going at that speed for? Just to show his son how fast his new car's gonna go. Er but how long was he doing it for? Well look er Th this was more or . less shows you the whole of the chase. But th that's actually they followed him for about ten miles . So he's done that for five minutes there. So anyway we I've got it here somewhere. So er just a just a few instances o of of actual film of things which happen on the road which depict attitude. Any comments on what we've got there? Now they're sort of things that you've probably seen yourself quite frequently I would think. So the other The main thing we're thinking about then, with the defensive driving technique, one of the most important things is attitude. So naturally we'll be looking to see the attitude of a guy when we're sitting there . . That's it, thanks. What was that one? That's the erm car in the A and the double white lines system, We'll show you this one in a minute, and coming the other way you will see there's an overtake. And th I'm sure every one of you have been in that situation where somebody's suddenly popped out and committed themself to an overtake and they've got nowhere to go at all. And that's a prime example of it. And you see the accident with the car driver when the brakes come on. But watch where the brakes come on. In other words, if the bloke hadn't have got back there would've been a f a total impact. Cos he wou his reaction time, understandably, cos he wasn't expecting it,ce happened like that and hi his reaction time was too slow to compensate for the stupidity of the bloke coming the other way. But you'll you'll all recognize the situation. . After this one it runs into one with a car er car transporter. The attitude of a lorry driver which you can have a look at . Here he comes look. Watch the bloke coming up there. Now here he is, look, see? Now see how the brake lights? Ooh. Now phew! the brake lights are that there. far too late, cos he he didn't couldn't And I'm not criticizing See the van dri the fact just a a question of the bloke didn't have time. You know, didn't have the time Mm. to react. Completely overtaking against th o over the double white line in all that traffic. There er here's a situation with this er er rather aggressive attitude of a car transporter driver. Now he's overtaking because he can't see but nevertheless Look at the gap there. The slightest movement with those . three lorries and there's a real shitcart isn't there? What's the safety margins there? Think of the turbulence between those vehicles there, you know the air displacement as they pass. It's thirty seven miles an hour. Not fast, but it's fast enough for that sort of distance between each oth I bet shitting themselves. . . He found out what colour adrenalin was when he got home. . Now you'll see him in a moment, he this guy driving he wants to go off on a slip road. And it's one of those slip roads where you off and other people join at the same place. But he's not g Cumbernauld. He's not intere Er yeah, Cumbernauld's a typical example of this. Aye. But he's not g no give and take with this guy, he's just taking advantage of his size. Er and he's going You watch in moment the way he S see there's the one trying to come out, look. Look. And he got straight in front there. There now watch and see the how he misses the central reservation, those bollards. Now if that car had pushed on and didn't brake when he did, that driver would either have taken car out or the keep left bollards wouldn't he? His speed was such he didn't approach it at a speed where he could erm er l lay off and er let something happen. So they're just examples of attitude gents, which And it's attitude which causes the problems. If you have a more considerate attitude one where you're going to sort of give way to people, show a little bit more consideration to other road users, I think you'd find that it's gonna it pays off. Right very briefly, we've been here a little while now, is erm we're just gonna a little talk about the other aspects of what we call a defensive driving technique. Have we got something on there Stan? No that's the fog one . The erm? Fog. Yeah thanks. We'll show that in a minute . Yeah. So what a el else are we gonna to be looking for? When we're talking about defensive driving, attitude plays a big part. The other thing we're looking at of course is your technique as a driver. Now the technique that you employ driving your vehicle is divided into two parts. How you control the vehicle and how you read the road ahead. Now controlwise, we can look at various things, and I think last year we had various discussions on different things, but, naturally, you're looking for smooth, positive control of the vehicle. A nice balance between clutch and throttle. Now I know that now you've got or two erm splitter boxes, yes? And clutches not necessarily all the time? But nevertheless, a nice balance can be obtained by giving that split time to get in. If you rush it too much you can very often find you're in a false neutral can't you or whatever the case may be? Then you've got to start again to try and get it. Invariably it's done through bad timing or trying to rush it. Not always. It does a little bit of technique to get used to these things, I ag I agree. But So we're looking for a nice balance between clutch and throttle, that you're not being jerked and the not clutch is not bloody flying every time that you take let your foot to engage a gear. Nice balance of steering. The steering should always be smooth, progressive, and accurate. It's gonna get your vehicle where it wants to go. Now steering on its own can very often be complicated by other aspects such as your correct speed for the situation. Co that can affect your steering can't it? If you're sort of travelling a bit too fast, you've gotta rush your steering, things might not be right. But your er basic style of steering, and naturally we come from a training establishment, we think and we practise the push-pull method. We think that is the best method. Because it's the most accurate, it's the smoothest and you're always in a position to respond should you want more or less steering. If you go over the top, underneath or palm, you are not. Er plus the fact your hands could slip off the wheel or or whatever. So we er advocate this. But we we s we know that people have their own styles. You might have been driving for years by going over the top of the wheel as a lot of lorry drivers do. So although we think that our method is best, we fully realize that you've got styles, things th which you've built up over many years. And providing your steering is smooth,positive and accurate,then we accept it. It's no real problem. So we realize we're not gonna be here to change the habits that have built up over a lifetime. You can't change habits like that b in two or three hours. But if there was an aspect of your steering like erm Right now listen folks. sh sh sh sh sh. Can I remind you please if you're answering a question can you please put your hand up so I can select . Some of you know Now way back a couple of weeks ago when we were doing the group seven the one that's spelt F C L B R I A T. Hands up who can remember what any of those stand for without looking on er You forgot the first rule put your hand up. Right fluorine is the actual element fluoride is the stuff that's in? Toothpaste. Toothpaste very good. You never put your hand up. Right C L Please sir is chloride Chloride is the is when it's joined up with something chlorine is the element. And what do we get chlorine in? Swimming baths. Swimming baths to? To take away all the nasty To kill the germs. Well it doesn't exactly kill them kill the it's got it's own smell which sort of tends to mask the smell but it's also basically to kill the germs. B R? Bromine. Bromine very good. And I? Iodine. Very good excellent. S so what I want you to show you this morning is how we can actually make the chlorine. So the people at the front yeah if if you come up a little bit closer. Now sh sh sh sh. Please Now I've got erm a bottle which is actually contains some chlorine here but it's not called chlorine liquid. I'll scratch this. Hydro Chloric. Chloric. chloric acid and it also says C O N C. Conc what is conc short for? It's short for a word yes. It starts with C O N C. Anybody? Conc is short for? Nose No conc er it's the beginning part of a word. If you use the word conc you're just meaning your nose . Conical. Ah now we're getting a bit more scientific. Conical if it was conical it would be C O N I conical. But it's conc. Now can you think of a wo c think of a word that describes the state of this liquid. And I'm going to hold the top while I show you. It's rather oily and it's quite a a dense liquid. Is it dangerous? It is dangerous yes. I'm gonna get some goggles on in a minute. What do you call liquid ah I'll give you a clue. What do you call a liquid that's very very strong? Concentrated liquid. Thank you concentrated. Now I Goggles on time folks. Now in this particular case I'm using a tap funnel Tap funnel just as it's it's Erm the concentrated acid you don't just sort of pour it in and run away and leave it to it. Let it in a little bit at a time. Just slow Slowly let the acid in. Then turn it off. Right now so the tap is to control the speed at which the acid goes in and if there is any gas that's in there it can't escape out of that pipe again it's got to go down the other pipe. So it's a safe it's a safety feature and it helps control the experiment. So we control the speed at which the acid goes in. And once it's in there it prevents the gas from escaping. Now at the moment the black chemical that's in there is not doing a great deal. The black powder's just sort of gone to a a sludgy paste . The powder's just gone it's dissolved a little bit but it's not really doing much on its own. So in order to speed it up a little bit we might need need to heat it up. Who said that? Me. Well done. Now who's going to go next door to get the gas switched on? What? Right Listen again sh sh sh sh sh. Done it. Sh Now in order to help this black powder to split up the acid. We're going to have to heat it up a little bit. Now again I'm treating it carefully I'm not just sticking the bunsen underneath and blasting away at it. I've got the Graham wanted to well unfortunately Graham this one's a bit dangerous so I'm having to do it so if anything goes wrong it's me that gets it and not you. Well because I've got all the dirty chemicals Sh. Please. Erm How will we know how will we know if there's any gas escaping? What. What's this paper? P H paper. P H paper. So I'm going to moisten it. Because of the gas that's drifting around in here What? The gas can you can you set fire to it? No it's not a flammable gas. But it is poisonous so if I start smelling it I'm going have to switch the cupboard on to suck the fumes away. Lorraine. Now this P H test I've only had it a few seconds and already look what it's done to the paper. Where I've wet it what's it done to it? Turned it yellow. It's turned it yellow and where it was dry it's now going what colour? Red. Red. Red means it's An acid. an acid. And because this takes what do you call something what do you call something that takes the colour away? Bleach. those are old pieces of paper. Come on somebody what do you call a chemical A what? Not a neutralizer. Andrew? We call a chemical that takes that takes Now you'll see it. What colour's the gas? Green. Right it's a green gas and it's also what it does it to this paper turns it acid to start with and then takes the colour away it is a bleach. Bleach gas. Now because it was frothing up I've turned the bunsen off to control the reaction it's slowing down again now. And you can see the colour. What colour's bromine on that list? Black. Black. What colour's iodine on that list? Black. Blue. Not it's not blue. Purple And they're all poisonous and they will bleach this the be this is probably the best bleacher. This is highest the highest up up the list that we can do. We can do reactions from F too dangerous. Now sh sh sh sh sh sh. Now this one I'm going to show you this one this time. Karina? Mm? Why do we use the tap funnel again? Cos we've got a tap funnel. so if there's any gas Yeah right it can't get out it has to go down the pipe. Sir? Stop shuffling. Sh. Can anybody oh I bet you'll never guess this one. Why have I got a conical flask instead of a round flask? Here's the answer. The round flask is broken. Erm I've go some purple crystals believe it or not. now this one's a bit more powerful this purple chemical. Shouldn't need heating up. If I put this white if I put the white paper behind the flask, can you see the gas that's in there? Yes a yellowy gas. Yellowy gas right and Sir? Yes? Is that flammable? It's not flammable it's poisonous it's acid and it bleaches. It could yes in the in the First World War er they used It would But how long would it take? It depends how much you got into whether you had asthma or not. You might you might have after you've s had some of this. Now can I explain this part over here look at this. Sh sh. Er right I've got this contraption upside down leading into a a trough of water. Can anybody guess why? There's something else that this gas does in water. If you'd got enough gas it would make bubbles. But we've only got a small supply remember. It may do . What do what do things normally do in water. Sometimes they move yeah. Anything else if you just put some Right they sink or float. What else do they do after they've either sunk or floated? Rust. They might rust yeah. Or turn to a well what do you call it when they turn to a liquid. What's the word? They what? They liquidize. Liquidize. They liquidize but you can liquidize things by heating them up that would liquidize them but in this particular case you just mix them with some water what's the process called? To turn it into It's called what? If you stir some sugar into water. Dissolves. It dissolves okay. If this gas if this gas dissolves too quickly it'll suck the water back up the tube and into this flask. It could be dangerous because if you're sucking water into acid you could have problems. So Lorraine I've got this upside down funnel and that prevents the water from being sucked up. How do I know I've got some chlorine in the water. Well look what's happening to these test papers. They're not acid any longer what's happened to them? Mark what's happened to that that test the P H paper there? It's all gone white. It's gone white what's the pr what's the pr what do we call it it's been? Bleached. Bleached. So I've got some bleaching yeah smell you can smell that bleach. I've got some bleaching chemical. Wave it past your nose you don't sn Don't don't just I'll just wave it past your nose. You don't want to much cos remember it is er poisonous. Anybody else want no? You want a smell? Right. So sh sh sh sh sh let's just sum up. What was the liquid we started with? What was the liquid we started with? Erm oh that conc Concentrated hydrochloric acid. It's got chlorine in it. We used a black chemical to start with but in order to that to help that we needed some heat. And this one works on its own this purple chemical is more powerful and works on its own. Adam can you go and turn the gas off? Right now I don't know Mr. 's trying to book some. What? Erm science trips. Where to? Somewhere in The Science Museum in London? No no no erm somewhere in Yorkshire. Somewhere where? Somewhere in Yorkshire. Er yes a gas gas gas fired power station . Right can you go back to your places. Right now Sir have s have you seen Pride and Prejudice and the telly? Can you look after those folks. Well well did anything happen when I put the acid in? Did any any of you three see what anything that happened in the first one. so we had to put some a bit of heat in. Nothing happened acid on its own. Now we got . Let's Right excuse me. too small. Erm does anybody know what this M N O two business is? Have a look on your your periodic table and see if you can work out what M N O two. You should know what O O stands for. M N O two anybody? Nitric oxide. Something oxide yeah. Part way there come on M N have a look on your page one of this module. Work look up what M N stands for. Anybody worked it out come on M N O two. Magnesium. Very close but not quite right. Not magnesium. Have a look look very close it's not mag it's No oh that's capital N this is a little N M N. That's it right. M N Oxidizes Go on read it what is it? Magnesium. No have you looked closer. Manganese. Manganese manganese oxide. Please. There you go. Manganese oxide erm the back row decided. Manganese oxide. Erm Excuse me sir thanks sir. universal liquid. Or a piece of universal paper or . What does K M N O four stand for? What does K stand for anybody work that one out on your periodic table. K for anybody remember cos we've done this group. What's this paper paper called? P H. Yeah that's P H. Yes it is. No not chrome. Anybody what's K? Potassium. Well done. Yes I know because it's come from an old an old word an old . Er K potassium yes. Erm then we've got a manganese K M N O four. It's got two metals . How which one's got most which one's got most oxygen in it the K M N O four or the or the M N O two? M N O two. Why? That's a guess. Well look at the numbers. M N O two K M N O four. Oh I thought K M N O four. Yeah why? Cos it's got number four. It's got four oxygen atoms and that's only got two oxygen atoms. Well done Michael. So K M N O four's got more oxygen. Erm what does this word property mean in number four? Property. Now you're gonna tell me a property is something that you can Yes something that's good about it very good. So what's what what are what's chlorine got that say no other gas has? It's a germ killer yeah anything else? Er. How would know it if I brought a jar full into the room? Smell it. Smell it. Right erm what else. How would we know a jar was full compared with an empty jar. Just to look at if the lid was on. You can see it. Why? You can smell it. No we've the lids on this time. Sir it was oily and you can see it. No that was some drops of acid that you could see We're trying to work out what the properties of this gas if you're not listening you won't be able to do number four. It's smelly it's yes it's poisonous yes that's a property good. Another one? Mm that's a use not a property. What colour It's yellowy green yes How we doing folks? Good. Sir I've finished. Right goo you know that erm acid thing you were doing this one be finishing that off. I dunno I can't remember. You marked it. and have you done a key Yes. Well a key should have a little bit at the bottom to say what what's it stands for. Oh you've done that red ones, yellow ones, where's your yellow ones Your key doesn't match your chart. You've put green ones and they're the metals . Your green ones are the alkali earth metals. You've got this all all wrong. Tell you what I'll get you another one. How are we doing ladies okay? Number five oh Can anybody tell er on number five why we got the upside down funnel. No. Now come on this is a check of who was listening Why have I why have we got that upside down funnel? Sh sh sh sh. Sh sh er no. What does the gas do to the water? Mark Mark Mark. It does but it might also do the gas might do something else as well. Turn the water green. How could it turn the water green what would it have to do in the water? Bubble. Come on we're going back to this shove it in water business again. Oh it dissolves. Dissolves stop it from sucking the liquid back again. dissolves to the stop the liquid from being sucked back into . The gas dissolves. the gas starts to come off when I just put the acid in. Yeah so you've got to heat it up . paper some P H erm Darren Darren sit down please. that funnel right now how did we control the speed at which the acid went in. With a tap. And then once all the acid was in if you left the tape open what would happen to the gas? It would just escape so we sh close the top and the gas has got to . Down the tube and into Yeah down the other tube and into the what's the thingumajiggy? What do you call it that tall cylinder thing? Thingumajiggy? You'll never guess it's for collecting gases so we call it a Gas . Gas jar. Not far off. Oh. Now come on. Speed it u yeah cos the black powder wasn't powerful enough. Can anybody tell me why the black powder's not powerful enough. Look at the shorthand for it M N O two it's not got so much? Oxygen. Very good it's not got so much oxygen. So you've got to give it some heat to help the oxygen to work. Now if anybody's finished and is wondering what to do check through and make sure everything is up to date. And then I've got some work here for those who thing everything's up to date. So don't start this work until everything else is up to date. It's on the end of this . And if anybody's been away and has got or has got missing sheets I've got spare sheets down here. Question sheets Don't forget your acid posters by the way. Or you getting another one. It's Right I would. The only problem is I haven't got many colours. You'd you'd do better to use your own colours if you've got . How are you doing okay Dean? Oh right well you need Oh not again. Right who can tell yes go on Michael. To let the acid in. To let not out to let what in slowly. The acid in slowly right. It lets the acid in slowly and once the acids in what does it stop next? Carbon dioxide So whatever's in there can't get out up there it's got to go through another pipe it's got to go through the other pipe. Two two reasons. To stop the gas from escaping and to let the acid in bit by bit. Sir? Yeah. Er you could put P H or universal or any antacid indicator. Sir Properties who can tell me a property of this gas. Look at it in through the in the fume cupboard I can see one from here. Green. It's green right good. It it's a bit misty alright fair enough that's a property. Anything else? If it can fall down out of that pipe into the jar it must be? Very good be heavy. If it erm sucks the water up if you're not careful it must. How can it suck the water up by? It hasn't actually done cos I put that funnel on the end to stop it from doing it. Yeah it would cause a vacuum as it dissolves. So it dissolves obviously. Have you got the smell one have you put the smell smell one down. Smells of? Swimming baths or bleach or You can put some universal indicator or erm P H paper or To stop it from sucking because it dissolves too well It's like you in there drinking drinking er coke out of a straw if you you suck enough It'll all end up in your mouth. If you just put a pipe straight in the end of the liquid it would suck the liquid up. Right Darren if you've finished the qu To s stop from sucking up Now who's finished? Number three you could on the filter paper I've out some of those P H test papers. You could put universal, P H, litmus anything. Oh yeah probably we don't stop just cos you're not . Are there any I've got the index out here if you want one. I'll thank 'em all very much then. Oh fine you want to thank them now. Can I thank you all very much for being cooperative. Come in. Good morning. Hello Doctor. Now stranger, what can we do for you this morning? a long time. A number of years. Aye, it's a long number of years. You've got spots . Mhm . I was told it was chicken pox, but I haven't Mhm. been to a doctor. Aye. I've had this for over a fortnight. Did it just come on all of a sudden? I think what happened it started on my legs, here. Right? Oh deary me . Now for a while, before I went to, I went to . That's turned into . Right. It's okay. we'll get that cleared for you. I thought it was Yeah. like that. No. Four or five days and it should all be starting to I hope it's not turning . A germ, there's a germ that floats about in the air and if it gets onto the skin when it's broken. It Was it? Was it originally . Well it looks as though it could well have been originally chicken pox? like chicken pox. Yeah. But that's all it takes, it's just the skin to get broken, and underneath the skin and it just spreads and it's And you haven't seen my arms. Same. Alright. Okay. My arms are really bad. Let's get that sorted for you. it was chicken pox and I'm saying to myself it's very infectious. What about , is that infectious? Yes. That's contagious as well. And the funny thing was I've Mm. only been off my work for about er seven days. I was at my work for a couple of days, Mhm. when this started. Yeah. So I must have passed it on . Aye. Impetigo isn't nearly as easy to pass on as chicken pox. In fact it's, it's really You have to be living in the same house as somebody who's I was ask asking myself . Aye. You, you've got to be using that same towels, you know, that sort of thing. Aha. You know, actually,mo all more or less direct contact Aha. before you can pick it up. Mhm. So there's no terrible worry in that way, that you've passed on to anybody. And that, I wouldn't worry about that. get that thing? Ah, you could get it anywhere, I mean even, see the likes of that, that wee cut in the back of my hand? Aha. Well it could start off in that. Just just . See I always wondered because er it seemed awfully slow in spreading it, it was there that's right. and a couple of days with nothing happening I'm saying, well, at least it's started clearing up, but then And then it moved somewhere else. it moved somewhere else and I'm saying I'm looking at it That's right. the only place I've not got it is my abdomen and my chest. Right down the front. It had nowhere to go. Aye. And it started on my back quite a bit, three of four days ago, well it's not just as bad but my arms are real bad. Right. Let's see if we can get you turned into a human being. Oh dear, and I'm saying to myself it was chicken pox Aye, but I don't think I've heard of that impetigo Doctor to be honest. Yeah. it's years and . It used to be quite a common thing. Yes. Correct. Aye, I remember. Ah, but it's y you still see it, I mean we still see it about once or twice every week. Mhm. But I mean it used to be every day Aye. we used to see it. So, it all cleared up okay? It won't Yes. Och aye. leave a lot of marks? No? Well, I suppose it . hopefully not. No. No. No. Now not nowadays, not with the, not with the stuff we get nowadays. Now. Now. Now. And what I've noticed is I've seen my bed linen. It's been weeping at night when I'm sleeping. That's right. That's right. In your sleep. That's right. most of this is drying up but the skull must get It seems to Right. weep. That's right. When the skin when we ju move around in the bed, the skin cracks open Oh that's it, it's all cracking here. Aye. Mhm. And the same with the crusty bits Oh aye. , when you move around at night it's the crust cracks open Mm. as well and you get this weepy, sticky Aha. yucky er yellowy green That's correct. Aye. coming out. That's right, isn't it? That's it. That's er here you are young William and that should get rid of that for you no bother at all. Right and er two things, you've got a special stuff for during the day and a different stuff for bedtime. Aha. I is it is it oral? Or what is it er? Tablets. Both of them's tablets? Both tablets. Both tablets to take. Aha. And that'll get rid of that for you. So I can get in ? What about work? An anything. I can go to work? Yeah. I feel a bit, I feel a bit embarrassed . Aye. The only thing about work is are you working with oil? I do work with oil, aye. Ah well, no chance. No chance cos that I'm working on Thursday so I'm Aye. but I work with turbines and it's Aye. No. It's for your own sake, because the o if the oil gets underneath the skin it can irritate your skin. Aha. So you're better er out the way of that for a week ? or so. Yeah. How are you keeping yourself, Doctor? Me? Fine. Oh, good. . Don't have much choice. I would say I've been pretty lucky recently myself . Oh, that's a good way to be. It's a good time to be a stranger in here. a bit guilty, you know? Right. See if we can keep it that way for another twenty years. Aha. Right. Thanks Doctor . Okay. Right. Much obliged. So, what will I gi things right now. give it another week? Give it a week,oh, within the week it should be a big lot better. So that'll be the following . Let's say a week on Monday. Back to work a week Aye. Monday. A week Monday. Great. . Aye. Thanks very much. Okay. Right, Bill. Right? Look after yourself Bye now. now. Bye. Thank you. Come in. Come in. Come in. mix up there. Aye. Well. She shouted, Mary , and two of us rose up. I said to the other one, are you Mary too? She said, aye . I said, which one ? Oh dear. . Well now. What can I do for you today? Oh it's just it's not getting any better. You're still having trouble? Aye. And er last time I came it was Doctor and he changed Yes. the tablets, and it's even worse now. And he put me off the Mhm. and I don't feel the same for off of that. I feel as if I have to use my spray more. I seemed right doing, alright drying my feet now and not my . You shouldn't have to use your spray more Mary because that's Mhm. Well I seem to be all tight Right. here. Right. Aha. I know how it is? My chest. Aye. I know how to do this. We'll Mhm. get you sorted out. Aha. Even just, usually I used to maybe just have it once. Sometimes I didn't even need it at all I could walk about shopping and everything. Aha. And this I've had to take it twice while I've been doing some shopping now. I feel as if my, it's funny it's not a pain but it's like my, I'm just going like that Aha. Right. Aha. And he put me off of that the other ones you gave me with the, what was it? Hexapol or something? Hexapol Aye. And you Yes. I, with, with this Monit Aye. that he gave you Aha. that would have fought with the Hexapol There would have, there would have been a reaction between Aye. the two Aha. so that you you're safer without that. Without that the ma without the Hexapol And you're better I've a taking the Monit Aye well the Hexapol with me. it wasn't doing me any good because it was It wasn't doing any good. still sore but it was still the same even with that. Even with that. Right. Mhm. Let's put you on this stuff and that'll get your circulation . At least they have spray now had a spray I don't know how long it is I've had it. And that's how I'd be You're I mean I never went through it much, but this last fortnight This is your . I've been using it all the time. get another one ? Yeah. No bother. No bother at all Mhm. that. It's usually in after you go I was never near the doctor myself . Well that's And this way he gets him a good life. If they hadn't had tha the accident to his Yes. it was on the er the femur? his femur that's Aha. right. And that's er bosses are after meeting and this is the one that's er That's going away. that's sore. That's going away. Well let's I feel that though I'd been dawdling it wouldn't have been so bad . let's cure you. Let's cure you. Ah. What do So stop, stop, stop, stop your Monit Stop the Monit Stop them altogether. Aha. And what about And s the Batol Mm? No. Don't touch the Batol No. Aha. These are pink tablets yo you start Mhm. taking them one in the morning and one at teatime and one at bedtime. Aha. That's three times a day. Three times a day. Three times a day. Aha. And, and come back up and see me in in three Aye. Aye. weeks and and they'll you know that er they've got ? No. You stop Wee, wee pink ones? stop that. Would Deborah need to then? I've been taking them all the time. No. You can stop them now. Stop the . Stop, stop the now. Mhm. Yes. Mhm. Stop that altogether. And I've got all these other pills I meant to bring them out and hand them in at the chemists Ah. First time you're passing. Aye. the chemists even? That'll do fine Mary. Aha. the aches the aches have been all I all got, I all got, no. I used the last of that er Minit or whatever you call it,Monit but I've got in the house and I've got Aha. Well first time, first time you're coming up to the supermarket, drop it, drop them in I just drop them in here ? Aye. Drop them in. Aha. No, no harm done. Because I say it's stupid you know to destroy them or fling them away Oh aye. or that. Oh aye. Eighteen pounds for a box is Aye. I know. Aha. expensive so throw I meant in fact to put them in my bag when I was coming here and I forgot. First time you're coming. First time you're coming up. No bother. Thank you. Thank you. But that should do the trick Mary And I and it'll settle it'll settle this as well. And will I come back again or will I? Three weeks. Three weeks? Do you work? You know back here to see how Aye. you're doing. Because it's alright doing my round the ankle and all? Yeah. Well we need to Sore. get skip ropes for you. I need to I need exercise. Right Mary. Right. Thank you. Okay. Cheerio now. Cheerio. Feeling blue? What do you do? One hundred women have an idea or two. Talking about depression is not something we do much, which is odd really because everybody gets depressed and vast numbers of us need help from time to time. Though because perhaps we feel guilty or embarrassed about the whole area of mental health we're not tackling the problems when they come up nearly as well we might. So we're going to try and start to change all that now. Let me ask the one hundred women here, have you ever been depressed? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And perhaps the only surprising thing about that result is that, is that seven people have said no! Ninety three have said yes. Let me ask you whether you would regard yourself a depressive person? Would you say are depressive rather than simply get depressed? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And there, only sixteen say they're depressive er people, eighty four no but the great majority here have been depressed from time to time. About what? I mean th a great variety of things are depressing but can you identify what makes you depressed? Lack of money. Sorry? Lack of money. Lack of money. And that's something, that must be a very Aha. common one? Aha. And then that your, your household is well, the sort of er, someone's lost their job, you know, you start what are we're gonna do? You know, how are we gonna manage? Mm. Etcetera. Who else? Ya? After a baby. Baby blues. Baby blues. Did you have baby blues? Yes. After my last one. Just after one? After the last one. What's it like? Absolutely terrible! Horrendous! What did you I , well I just didn't realize it was anything like that, I had I've had four children and the last one there was thirteen years difference between them and it was really, really terrible! He was about six months old and I didn't know what was wrong with me. How long did it last? About three months before I finally, I was husband made me go to the doctor or go to the doctors for me and that's when I realized it was depression I didn't know anything about it then. Really? Had you not been warned? Had you not No. read anything? No. Yes? Sometimes you don't need anything to make Mhm. you depressed. Mhm. Sometimes you've got a depressive illness. You know, a manic depressive or a schizophrenic or whatever. Yeah. Beside you. Living with somebody depressive has made me depressed on frequent occasions and th th the feelings of helplessness that you have in dealing with the person's depression. Yeah? Erm, one of the things that depresses me, is probably the main thing that depresses me is not being valued for what I am or what I do and I think many women suffer from depression because their strengths and their creativity are not recognised and valued. Mm. Anna? Being a single parent. Is that depressing? Yeah cos there's, on your own all the time and you feel you've got no time for yourself and that can be fairly bad at times. Yeah. Er, it's not just single parents, I think er, married couples as well cos I think Yep. society expects everybody to cope well and they don't. So I think that can become quite depressive as well. Up there. I think from what everyone's saying being a woman in Scotland today is that in itself er, a cause for depression. I think trying to exist in society at the moment is extremely difficult. And there's wi wide er, spread unemployment and there's the stress of being as that lady said, a single parent, erm, for women who work and have families they have their old conflict between what they're doing, doing at home and what they're doing at their work and who should have a priority. So I think erm, just a combination of trying to get through the week can be a sort of depression for many women. How do you cope with it, the ninety three of you who get depressed from time to time, whether it's severely or or or or not so severely? I think it's a matter of giving yourself time of accepting that maybe you're feeling low or I fe , when I'm feeling low I say right, I can't cope with things I've got to give myself some time where nothing's gonna bother me, if I can manage it, an hour, half an hour, just doing something for myself that I really like and that helps me once I accept myself as being depressed then it helps alleviate the stress involved with it. Is that something you think would work for everyone. I think it's worth a try. Doing something you like, if you can give yourself half an hour, or an hour, you know just say this is for me, and for me only. Mm mm. I think with erm, I I was brought up in a household where it was com , completely legitimate to admit to being depressed and that you would just have to cope, I think cope perhaps my most Mm. least favourite word in the entire language! Women coping all over the Mm. place with Mm. all sorts of terrible stresses and the only sort of legitimate reason for collapsing is to allow somebody else to cope beautifully with your collapse. I think with er, it's very interesting that people are actually admitting that they feel depressed and they have strategies for dealing with it. I'm sure it's re relatively recent. It probably is. It'll be useful Mm. to hear more of the strategies. Yes? I think it's important to get a listening ear and know that there are other people around who will give you support. You have to search that out. I'm not su , absolutely convinced, in terms of saying Mm. having an hour away from it is enough, I think there are a number of women who need to look and get support from somewhere. Is that hard to do would you say? Erm I think well I think it is, at times. I think in terms of people knowing, in terms of women knowing where they actually can get that support from. And also actually getting them there, themselves there in the first place is very difficult. Where's the yes? I think it helps if you can identify whether the the erm depression is just caused by erm the circumstances round about you which can be alleviated by changing them or if it's caused by eating habits or erm or erm hormones or chemical imbalances in, I've suffered, I think, from all them as well! Say like erm th stresses we're all under will cause depression, but after my had my children I suffered from reactive hyperglycaemia, low blood sugar, and we , that was glucose intolerance and I think an awful lot of women erm, suffer th from this and it's not erm found out and knowing the glucose intolerance I can understand how a lot of children erm, suffer from er problems with eating habits because I think this is being discovered more and more Mm mm. and I think society should be erm, trying to get to the root cause of like, chemical imbalances and eating problems rather than just putting people on tranquillizers. Well I wonder how many people here, I mean ninety three people say they ha , they th they occasionally do get depressed, I wonder if you ever have taken er, mood controlling drugs such as tranquillizers? Have you? Button one for yes, button two for no. It's erm it's regarded as er as an increasing problem er amongst women. Thirty nine have. Now we're talking about how you cope, the thirty nine who have do they work? Don't they work? Would you recommend it or wouldn't you? And obviously everybody has a different experience of this. Yes? Er, I actually had two stillborn babies, one one year after each other and they put me on Valium and it didn't do me any good at all! And my little boy was he was only about three at the time and I used to be used to angry at him and my neighbour used to come in and take him. And I was married to a soldier so I didn't have any family round about me at the time so it was it was pretty hard. And coming off valium was a lot harder because you don't realize that when you're on it you can't get back off it again. Did you, did you get help coming off it? Erm Well you were obviously, well you prescribed it in the first place Well that was supposed to be help. it was, it was actually there was a programme on television and my husband took me to the doctor and he said he felt I'd been on it too long, I'd been on it about six months and when I come off it, I come off it pretty quick and I ended up erm I didn't know what was wrong with me and it ended up I've now got epilepsy, and they didn't know if it was caused through erm I took a stroke about three four month after that and then I got the epilepsy as well, so they don't know if that me coming off it Mm mm. straight away, I just stopped it. Down there. Erm, I was erm, put on just for in ninety seventy three and your question that you're asked was and from nineteen seventy three till three years ago erm I know took my causes, I trust, put my trust in the doctors and erm over all those years I didn't realize that it was actually the tablets that was causing me the mental illness. And saying that, in the last three years I since discovered, and it was quite difficult to, which I did find, that there was alternative erm therapists, which was lots of groups that were going on and once I got into it erm the , it opened up a new, you know I ne I've never saw the light at the tunnel that is shining brightly now! Has anybody had the opposite experience with er with the kind of the drugs we're talking about, whereby they have been helpful and th , and they, and they would recommend them? Yeah? Er, I think anti-depressants can be helpful for a certain length of time but not for over a prolonged period of time. Erm and I think there's a big difference between them and tranquillizers and people tend to get the two mixed up. I think tranquillizers can be useful as well for a very short time limited period. Erm, but I certainly found anti-depressants helpful. Mm. Yes? Yes. I just wanted to say that speaking as a psychiatrist Mhm. valium is not an accepted treatment for depression and that we have excellent anti-depressant drugs, particularly ones that have come just in recent years that are very effective for depression, and I think bringing a great deal of benefit to depressed people. Well Ray say,i i I mean it's important that we yo you find out whether you are depressive, whether you have er ag , oh, something clinically wrong with you, whether you're just feeling a bit down. But perhaps we don't really know enough and we don't know where to go for information, I mean I don't know er I, I I'm not an expert but there are experts here, how would you assess the services available to people who feel they do need help, or for people who perhaps don't know they need help? Yes? Yes I think the situation in Scotland is very poor! I'm, I'm an alternative medicine practitioner and I tend to get a lot of people who are depressed coming to see me, people who have been through the normal routes Mhm. gone to their GP's, and often have been given some sort of medicine for their depression but haven't had the counselling side of things dealt with and they've just been given re-prescriptions, not necessarily seen every time for a re-prescription. Behind you. I think there are a number of counselling services available, but I also think it's very difficult sometimes for women to get there Mhm. and it's it's something about the shame around depression that we don't actually come forward for counselling and there's certainly not enough free counselling services in Scotland. There. I'm also an alternative therapist and I do find that this is one of the major problems, that ninety percent of my patients who come to me suffer from stress and depression, and really what has happened in a lot of cases is that they have been put on valium and drugs, they find the side effects are horrific! And actually really in a last resort in many cases they come to you. Mm. Mm. I went through a period of depression erm I'd been attending the doctor I'd been told that I was suffering from various illnesses, but nothing helped. I was given anti- depressants, that didn't help and it wasn't until four years later when they actually admitted me to hospital and then an ulcer and the depression disappeared once it had been diagnosed. But all the time I'd been attending the doctor I'd been told, first of all it was gall stones Mm. then it was something else Mm. then it was something else and I honestly thought the doctor thought I was cracked! There's nothing the matter with me! And I was taken into hospital and it was an ulcer and the depression disappeared after that. Mm. There. I think speaking as another psychiatrist er the medical profession do have to look very carefully and perhaps how a lot of the damage has been done er with how women perceive whether they can ask for help or not because a lot of the women here have raised been giving tranquillizers and my colleague across there has pointed out that tranquillizers are not an appropriate way of treating depression. Mhm. And diagnosis is very, very important that, if you have a medical, clinical state of depression try as a service from other churches outside the membership of the World Council and also to cope with the press. Unfortunately, in this country we were badly served by the press! And it had, it'd be true to say that whatever you read in your newspapers er, while we were in Canberra, I would advise you not to believe half of it! Or a quarter of this! Because what came back to us was very much tittle tattle gossip that people picked up in er, Canberra! And, it is true to say that that did not represent the what really went on in Canberra! Because, above all, it was an experience experience of meeting people from different churches wi experience of meeting people of different cultures experience, too, of listening attentively and worshipping with people of different church traditions of your own. And that was something to er an experience to cherish! The World Council Churches on this occasion reviewed the work accomplished during the seven and a half years since the last assembly in Vancouver in Canada. It rec , received a report therefore, from the Central Council of the World Counc , Council of Churches which meets I think, once a year Noel can correct me on this once a year, or a at least once every two years. And then we have a member from Wales on the Central Council of the World Council of Churches, Miss Carole who er, although she is from Wales, member of the church of Wales she now lives in Belfast. But er, we were not successful in putting up an er and er to have a member of Wales elected on this occasion to serve for the next seven years unfortunately! And er i , it, this caused a great deal of hurt, if I may say so? And then the er Council also set guidelines for it's programme in the years ahead. It also chose presidents, it also chose, a hundred and fifty members to serve on the central committee, or the executive committee of the World's Council of Churches. It also made statements on pressing issues in the church and the world. And these, above all else included the Gulf war because this war was on while we were in Canberra. And this really owed a great deal of tension! We er, the we, we have also to make statements on the indigenous people and land rights because we were confronted with the position of Aborigine people in er, Australia. And we were concerned about their land rights or in other words, their human rights their natural human rights. I'll speak about that in a moment or two. We were concerned too about internal conflicts in certain countries and especially in South Africa. But all these statements revealed the desire of the assembly to pray more ardently for the spirit of unity to reconcile people. Indeed, this was a very rare opportunity for all delegates and visitors, as I said, to meet to listen yes, and to hear it first hand about the life and witness of more than three hundred member churches throughout the world in a hundred countries! It was certainly and opportunity for the churches together to look at the world situation in conversation together and thus, to deepen the faith which have to proclaim at arriving at a common understanding of the situation. It isn't the you are not expected, at least, I was not expected to to see the Council producing masses of pages for our reading afterwards and this report, by the way, is worth reading. Sounds of the spirit. If you had read this I shouldn't be here this afternoon! But are we going to inflict that on you? But, can I say this that what mattered most to me was the fact that I have been in conversation with so many people and to be able to allow that conversation to affect my faith and a faith that I have to proclaim day by day and Sunday by Sunday from the pulpits of my church. As previous as in previous assemblies worship wasn't central to our activity. Besides, morning worship there were midday sermons and in sessions together with evening worship. What I missed most at this occa , on this occasion was the opportunity for bible study, but I think getting pe er, a visitor of another kind there was able to visit some of the bible studies each morning. The daily pattern of study and discussion work was divided into two parts in the morning, participants met in small groups in the afternoon, all members met in session sessions reports from central committee and also er, reports on developments in the World Church. The main theme of the assembly, therefore, was the prayer come holy spirit renew the whole creation. .Appertaining to a to infuse through dramatic presentic presentations the main theme by the or aboriginal of Australians telling about their life and struggle. Other Ecumenical topics presented were the life and history of ecumenical movement you retain and justice and peace ecumenical sharing. and indeed, the recent programme justice, peace and integrature of creation featured very prominently in our discussions. And no doubt, it will continue as a very important theme for the future. Some themes of the assembly therefore were giver of life sustain your creation spirit of truth set us free spirit of unity reconcile your people Holy Spirit transform and sanctify us. What about the background, therefore to the assembly's discussion? But first of all the global situation in the Gulf. This marred the peace situation! Plane flights had to be diverted so, by the time we got to Canberra we were very conscious of the destructive element of the Gulf in our prayers and in our discussions. Secondly, we were made aware of the effects of what can be described as liberation thinking and liberation theology not only in South America but only, also, in the Pacific regions Asia, Japan and Korea. Then there was the influence of the third world, or the two thirds world the churches the politics and the cultures. And then fourthly, more and more the orthodox churches placed, played a very significant part in guiding the port of as far as as the assembly was concerned. Significantly to, there was the abstinence of Roman Catholic church influence and dominance. Some of us, some of us tried to make a plea and I hope we will try, still try to make a plea that there should be a significant Roman Catholic er, element within the membership of the World Council of Churches in the future. So we were presented, as it were, with a partial membership of the World Church. As far as I'm concerned two things set the assembly in context firstly, the sense of space. For many Australians the desert which covers much of their country means a vast emptiness solitude and the struggle to survive in hostile surroundings. But, for the original inhabitants of the lands the desert is the familiar place that provides nature and gives meaning to life. It was natural, therefore, that the assembly should take up this kind of understanding. It was not too late to realise that space should be given in the programme for a proper consideration of the perception of winning in relation to the whole team of the assembly. Winning space therefore assumed a significant part of the assembly programme. Again, as I said, the Gulf war brought the peace question very much into the arena and accordingly there was always the pressure for prece , reconsideration of the peace under the general heading of peace space. And, can I suggest that we need to bring that very much into our discussions and into our prayers constantly in our churches. Significant that we have been challenged by our master to be peace makers how real is that in our churches? And tomorrow will be the real test, won't it not? That we are really praying for peace and identifying ourselves with peace struggle in Ireland. Secondly, there was also the context of the Aborigines. We were reminded of their plight at the opening service of the assembly. One thing I forgot to bring with me this afternoon was a tape of the assembly worship I'm sorry about that, but I don't think you've got a tape recorder have you? That upsets me! We were reminded of their plight of peace, as I said, at the opening service. Outside the marched in the aborigines had their fire of gum tree branches to purify the atmosphere very much like the flames of fire which appeared on the first whit Sunday. The twenty sixth of January seventeen eighty eight the British established a small prison community at Sydney Cove on the east coast of Australia villain read the declaration and hoisted the Union Jack claiming the east coast of the entire Australian continent for the British crown. And that meant quite a effect as far as the aborigines were concerned they had lost their territory! The aborigines were not consulted or compensated! European occupation of land gradually extended through most of the continent. In more remote areas reserves were set aside for the igi indigenous hab , inhabitants. They were sa , put aside, they did not count! But by the end of the nineteenth century there were six British colonies in Australia! On the first of January nineteen hundred and one they formed a federation and most adult aborigines were vote in the process for deciding on the federation. The culture of the minorities of indigenous people that was given providence at the assembly. And this was expressed in a very imaginative presentation by Professor a young in her keynote lecture when she called for three significant changes. The first was that for our generation we must learn how to live with the earth promoting harmony sustainability and diversity and, therefore, creation, spirituality was the keynote of the address. Secondly she said there must be a change from the habit of dualism to, what she described as interconnectialism We must see a relationship between things. In many parts of the earth, she said, the organised life in accordance with a sense of dualism body, spirit, man, women, black and white, poor and rich we must try and see them, in Christ coming together. They all make sense. The third change was from the culture of death to the culture of life. What is happening right now in the Persian Gulf, she says, shows the best example of the culture of death! She urged the assembly to use the energy of the Holy Spirit to tear apart all walks of division and culture of death in separators. Let us participate in the Holy Spirit of of life fighting for our life on this earth in solidarity with all living peace. Have you noticed if you listen hard to your radio tomorrow morning and you will hear so much about suffering and death and very little about life! I think we had better try and influence that as churches not that we should about the suffering that goes on about the death that goes on, but I think we ought to give all this another dimension in churches. That one would be thankful of the fact that Christ has spoke and talked about life. Now, this approach was criticised by the Orthodox church representatives as merely criticism an attempt to unify different faiths. But many of us saw it as an approach which emphasised the need to allow the faith of Christ to be incarnated within particular culture and Sir Paul , the former Archbishop of New Zealand took the same stand point as a Maori, in his own address and called delegates present to speak and act as people of hope and to respond sensitively to economic and environment progility and isolation, not only in the Pacific but wherever they are. Now then who do we assess with the assembly? May I make one or two observations and then I'll finish. On the whole, the assembly gave us and understanding of the worldwide church which was struggling to achieve reconciliation and to promote peace and justice. If we belong to the World Church then we must be in with part of this worldwide process and we shall never be ashamed of it. Secondly, moreover, it was an experience a and an opportunity to meet Christians of other churches. Differing traditions and those of other cultures and be in constant dialogue with them. We never have that opportunity in this country do we? Unless we ask people to bring in people, for instance, from the Afro- Caribbean churches to join us in our worship and to lead our worship. Can I also say that, er yes, we were badly served by the press but I think that er the onus now is on those of us who went to Canberra to be able to share with others and we have been going round to tell others about Canberra to share with you and with others the experience of being present in the World Council of Churches in Canberra. I would hope that by the time we come to the next assembly where there is going to be that there will be an opportunity for the churches, er, at home here to take part in preparing for the next assembly. Also, that the churches at home, of whatever church or denomination we are to be they also can own, not just in the World Council of Churches. At present, I do think that there is that kind of willingness to be er, engaged in this kind of preparation. I think, we ought to be taking time to try and prepare, well for the next assembly and in doing so to own what goes on there and to say, yes as the previous speaker said we are the World Church in a very real way. Now, moderator I've taken yes I'm only five out of the programme! Er, can I say that it's been a great pleasure coming er, to you and to say that erm that there's far more to say, of course, about Canberra er, but I hope that that taster will help you to try and appreciate what went on there. Thank you very much indeed. Can I thank you for sharing with us the the example of the concentration, that you put so much in such a short time. A good example for the rest of us! We've got the rest ! We're grateful for your taking the time to be with us. We're grateful to your commitment to the ecumenical life of churches in Wales particularly. Last week we met as a team, working with and next week we will be meeting . So it'll be Hollywell to get , it's a good way of ! And for your your time and your energy and for your fellowship as well. It's very kind of you all Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes. You're willing to, you're welcome to stay for as long as you wish or to leave when you wish to leave. to us. We ought now to think briefly about . is never to show any interest in anything because, if you do you get landed with what I've got to do this afternoon! And it was my concern that churches should know the implication of the children act as it's related to the life of the church that I'm landing in front of you. You should of all saw the last Synod papers received this. How many of you are familiar with it? There are a few hands. I've got a red and a blue, I'm sorry I haven't got yellow and green but I couldn't get the political parties. It's not electioneering er, they're just in different coloured paper to please the eye. Er, if you have not had a copy of this sent to you what I have said to them, by what I say afterwards erm it will be worth purchasing. My question ha , again another question, how do you make the Lord interesting? Shoppers creche that must er, registered. What does registration mean? It means that when you go along to the social services, register and it's above board children's work that you are doing. But they have a right within the law to carry out, to check all persons who are offering help in caring. And registration may be denied anyone who has been convicted of any certain types of offense. It's the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that all those leading groups are people of good standing. The church must make every effort to achieve the highest standards. And the church as bible road to fame in alerting us to our responsibilities. Now there's one thing that I have to alert us all to the rest may not have been important, perhaps only to some of the larger churches but groups are advised and churches are advised to make sure that in buildings that are used ah, for many different groups that young children under the age of eight do not come into contact with any casual people who may be using that building. Now that is quite an implication when you think about it! There is need to emphasise the importance of encouraging people to re , receive some sort of training when they come forward and offer to be involved in the work of our under eights and young people. I don't think there's any need for me to spell out any more at this point what that may mean but the responsibility in as churches to ensure that we care for the under eights. I will, in fact erm answer any questions afterwards. Thank you Nanette. An introduction that is important. There are a number ar , of areas in the ma state legislation that have been aligned to the church, or will affect the running of the church. One is the children act one will be something on on on the preparation of food, another will be one affecting the way in which charities have to keep registered accounts er, financial accounts which means that an example erm is responsible for registering the accounts of congregations by law. And another will be erm the responsibility to er, the minister, the alterations to listed buildings which might be landed on the, on the churches. What Nanette has said has been an important introduction and if yo , if what sa you have prepared altogether is legible then perhaps give it to Eileen and it can go out in the Synod papers that will be helpful. Erm, and in the faith and life department of URC we'd better preparing a pack on the children rights. Other information on whatever . We move now we move now to er, faith and life is on we're on page thirty five. moderator and friends of faith and life. In the very short space of time that we have available this afternoon there are three subjects that I need simply to bring to the attention of Synod. The first the little report under the heading of faith and life, on page five of your reports the second is the report of the provincial advocate which is on page six and the third, the report of the Youth Secretary which is on page twenty. Erm all those because subjects come under the general umbrella of faith and life, and I think er, moderator, probably the correct thing is to do is to be formal and to begin by er, proposing that these three reports be received for discussion. Then I'll receive the reports of faith and life and the Youth Secretary and the new secretary for discussion, yes. Thank you. Er, to take then first the report which you will find on page five you will see that faith and life on this occasion has concentrated on one subject and that is our weekend that we are arranging this summer as we have done annually for a number of years. Er, there is a a little orange leaflet which has been placed on the seats during the day that many of you, I hope, already have er, for anyone who hasn't may I perhaps place these on the front table, there's a the , there's another supply over there and, could I please ask that some responsible representative from each district would please take a few more of these away with you so that they are distributed in district meetings in the near future, and attention drawn to them there er, if there are not enough copies er, then I'm sure the provincial office on receiving a, a request from you will make sure there's more that passed on to you. Now, if you had an opportunity of glancing at the leaflet already you will have seen that the leader for this July's er,weekend is is Mr Henry and, I don't think I can do any better than to spend two minutes of the time that we've got in asking Henry if he would say a word or two of introduction to the theme for this year. Ignatius of Loyal er or er, more properly known to me in church history was the scourge of the wrath of the, of the council of reformation and inside of consumism but I think regards some years ago in on Ignatius spirituality of bibles which I'm delighted to see John has mentioned in his prologue for the er for his introduction to Holywell the the the association's there came to discover who Saint Ignatius er, helping to sort of tap greater spiritual depths and er resources and consequently trained as spiritual director er in Ignatian things. The spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyala have once, were once described as a sort of a spiritual from which people of past men, put together again. Erm that is not the aim of Trabecca Er, to start off with they do the full spiritual exercise of Ignatius Loyal all takes thirty days in silent retreat with a with an individual er under individual guidance with a, with a, a director or it could take anything from nine months to eighteen months to do in er day da da da living in open sort of retreat. What I hope to do is simply to share with you the life of Idigo and in experiences and to walk alongside him and also to help us reflectively to look and examine our own journey where are we with God? Where's God in our life, where has he been and where is he directing us? And so it'll be a gentle, I hope and er, reflective type of weekend and er using some of the tools of Ignatius and other tools, cos Ignatius was very er, adaptable er, you know in in methods of prayer and reflection and contemplation. I,. Thank you. And I I, I hope that I, I hope there's a good variety of people will again, as you always have done will turn up er, this year to share fellowship a , on this theme which er, is is a refresh theme I think for, for many of us. Now, the other two subjects I'm really only dealing because the people responsible are, are not here in the flesh this afternoon but Alyd the provincial advocate and I I think of Bill that's also gone too, er yes he he has, he has had to leave this afternoon. Erm, so what I promised to do in er er, a moment or two if people are to ask specific questions or comments to make arising from either of those printed reports on page six and page twenty erm, if you would make your point or ask your question now er, it will be recorded and transmitted to the officers responsible and they will take any necessary action or give any reverent replies to those questions. This doesn't preclude any private questions in conversation with those people at any stage during the life of the church. So if, if there are any formal concerns that anybody would wish to bring formally before Synod and erm to either Alyd or Bill then perhaps state them. Right. Right, yes I shall happy to convey to the moderator that Synod was er totally satisfied with the reports that are here before me and give them one hundred percent support in the work . Thank you. Bill is is erm with the group of young people who are having a weekend in . Er, those were the people that walked in and walked out! We come now to the final committee report which is on page thirteen of the page thirteen. Did you want to stand up for a minute? Yes. While you're stood up while you're stood up have a second and well each worship, right? Come on stand up! Stand up! Up! Erm is Benny here? No. Well it's very simple, who knows the Peruvian Glory? Woops! Will you please come here with me. Erm, who else knows it? thank you. Anybody else know it? So this is how it goes. I think so! I think it goes I'm not sure. Have we got an organ in here? Yes, I think . Okay, sing that. Glory to God, Glory to God Right. That's glory in the highest. glory in the highest The next line is to God be glory forever. To God be glory forever And then le lastly, line halleluja amen. halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen Are we there? You know it? Yeah. Okay and for the closing worship you will be the Oh! and the rest of you will be the people. Okay? So the sings the first line erm you know, Glory to God glory to God in highest and then you respond and then you sing to God be the glory, to God be the glory and you respond. And then you sing halleluja and we all sing halleluja, halleluja, halleluja okay? Glory to God,Glor Five seconds. .Erm Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest Right. Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest to God be glory forever, to God be glory forever, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen . Once more bit faster. Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest, Glory to God, glory to God, glory in the highest, to God be glory forever, to God be glory forever, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen, halleluja amen . High notes! Very good! Well I must admit I'm gonna have to present a finance report which is received by an overture. And first of all before we er we put the reports we , there are a number of er, there's one alteration and a number of er, additions obviously alteration or I should say a a an amendment is something an important place on page fifteen er, at the tope of the page referring to December nineteen ninety two I've put, which is agreed by GP committee with the exception of young these representatives, that we ask them to bring thirty pounds towards the cost that should be twenty five. That's the actual figure. Erm one difficulty with with giving a financial report is so many things seem to happen quickly and a erm apart from the fact that there was a, a major finance resources comes from we , as well you see that I have to tell you now these have been done on the red letter assembly side and you may want to alter one there er according to reform I see the cost per erm person attending is not a hundred and twelve pounds, but a hundred and fourteen pounds and that means that we have forty representatives we've got to try and find four thousand five hundred and sixty . Now, I hope I've got these facts right and I'm sure that not, that Eileen may correct me that er we have er forty hundred pounds in the budget,budget for this er the erm South Wales congregation has, has kindly erm given us grant of a thousand pounds and I understand from the secretary of con , Cardiff congregation , and he's also offered a thousand pounds I don't know whether we've got that yet? But then That will be, it is thousand so that's er that's three thousand four hundred short of a four by sixty. And what the difference is that er, we thought that you could have one young person per district and that they only have to pay thirty two pounds each, but I think these are only purely Yes, er, I have them for those who received that incorrect information from me, I must apologise erm young people who are going as delegates as representatives of their district must be treated as adult representatives and they have to pay full price. Er for , for people who are going to group and and, for any young people who are going observers there are special arrangements to be made which doesn't relate to our official represented district, I'm sorry about that! So that means that er, in th the total we do have to pay in some way or another, is four thousand pounds with sixty but we'll say we've already got three thousand four hundred, if all the for , forty people go and they pay twenty five pounds each, that's another thousand, so we've got a I think I've got it right,a , we're only a hundred and sixty short. Fairly reasonable! I hope we get that from somewhere. So er er that that is if we're up-to-date on the financial . Now, the most er, serious business the er, Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety two and the Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety three. At the meeting er, of the Financial Resources Committee that I attended on Wednesday the first thing we discussed was the er the giving so far, up to the end of February from the various provinces and we, by the end of February er, the total was up to thirty thousand pounds less than we required er which could mean that the end of the year it could be a hundred and eighty thousand pounds less than required but er of all the all the provinces, bar one have balances which could be used to make that up, so the money is fairly short and we're bear er, for pains, the ten and a half thousand from the first of July onwards for this year. Now erm i i in Wales, and I'm sorry to say, our figure er, we should of produced ninety thousand pounds and we provi , er, produced er, eighty three thousand two hundred and nine that means we are er, six thousand eight hundred down in two months! Now, we have a balance as it already tells you er, in er earlier in the paragraph of this paper that that we had a er balance of sixteen thousand pounds a , in the ministry last year so, if we knock sixteen thousand pounds what we're likely to be short of it seems to me we could end up being twenty four thousand pounds short at the end of the year. Now, there are quite a number of reasons for this and the good news, I think, that I bought good news again this morning is that presentations both about budgets er, and about what we do wi with the small churches is, er, could be some of our salvation. Question of budgets our I was almost said halleluja! If only, all our churches could do that we would really be getting somewhere! The biggest problem of all is that we can't look forward and that a lot of the problems, being problems are happening now, and happened since the er the first of January that should of happened they should of happened in th , in th , in the er at least the three months before the end of last year, if not more! So, er, we're getting people saying it's impossible to pay this even though they were asked if they could pay it at the the the time it was given sometime last July. Well that's one the other reason, of course we have got a large number of chur , very small churches in fact, looking at our mai , ministry figures nineteen ninety there were thirty churches that didn't pay anything to the maintenance and a lot of these, I think, maybe that both Gethwyn and Russell sorted out er who up on on those extremes that you get in a group that, that maybe feel they re that they really have nothing to, hardly anything to do with us they've don't receive ministry and why should that be, and after be asked each year, has to go up? And they see o I just wonder whether they just pile letters in the wastepaper basket! And therefore, if it can really come to this possibility of ministry a sort of, Young Farmers Club idea of getting themselves about that could be a a a a, a, a marvellous boost. So, the, the other thing which is er erm, a real problem, partly because of that, is, is when one talks about an increase in in giving, increase in percentage i , or a contribution of the church is in er, we were talking about twenty percent la , twenty one percent last year that would be alright if everybody gave twenty one percent! Those who did nothing, they can eas , easily increase their giving by twenty one percent, it's still the same! It means that the other people have to give more that's why some of the churches, I think they've found that their er, requests for their er er their er contributions, have gone up enormously! So, er, those are the pro , those are a lot of the problems that we are, we are facing now, will we really er will we end up at twenty four thousand down at the end of the year? That i , all I can say is that my, that's my best guess at the moment. We know there are some churches which er, will probably only pay quarterly, so they haven't paid yet, so that's money that's coming in. On the other hand we know there are some churches that are finding great difficulty in meeting er, what they've said they can and are doing their best to do it. So that's on the down side. So er, at the moment they're saying all I can see is that er, we would have to use up the whole of our balance, that's sixteen thousand and the twenty four thousand arrears. Now, that as the picture er, leads me onto the next er, stage which is what in ministry, er what can we do in nineteen ninety three? Erm a letter was sent to all district secretaries, who I think in mo , most cases sent these round to churches to see if we could get some idea from you as to what sort of increase in contributions could be possible for nineteen ninety three. That's quite difficult to do because where there's so many churches not being sure whether they're going to make it this year how can they say what's going to happen next year? On the other hand er, if we did what our friend from Cheltenham is doing we would have lo , we would be looking forward like that all the time we would have some idea. Now, I'm pleased to say we have had quite a number of of er replies from churches on what they think they can d , do. On the other hand, some of these er are good re positive replies and some of them, some are negative! And, it seemed to me that when I, as the er your representative on Provincial Finance Committee is asked to make a co , commitment for this, for this for er for nineteen ninety three I could say no better than what we had as out target this year and that was hard! Cos clearly we've only er reached something like five hundred, three thousand, four thousand er then it's gonna be a a big jump to get to the five hundred and forty! Now, nobody er er,a at this stage at the er Financial Resources Committee er, challenge us on this figure, I think we will just stage of of doing arith arithmetic of adding it up, but no doubt that the staff will be comparing what going to be, er what within a but have prepared for next year with what we're supposed to do this year and ours is an increase of another percent. We look at all the other conferences, the lowest after that was the Northern Provence which is in a very similar position to ourselves and they were offering a five percent increase. Er, a few others were offering seven to nine and most of the others were offering between ten and fifteen percent. So we're way down on all the others!so, that then falls three hundred thousand pound short of what is required to er, give ministers an increase to twelve thousand next year. There seem to be our two groups er, in one of our provinces and they say that the rich and poor but the rich er er are not so rich and others . That, in fact, er there are three provinces who are already now contributing more than anyone else that, they feel that the churches should go forward to try and raise the minister's to what was proposedly that the assembly last year, they should be paid thirteen thousand two hundred but in order to do that see another six hundred thousand pound raised and it is likely that this will be put as a challenge to the churches at assembly. Now if I could just remind you of what's happened at the Lyndford Haven er er, Synod, last March erm, the Financial Committee have suggested that we should go for a target of five hundred and ten thousand but er, this is we are not gonna be able to even start looking at the eleven and a half thousand if if er all the provinces do it for months and more and we, I think very bravely or foolishly whatever way you li , look at it, proposed that we should got to five hundred and forty thousand and it looks as thought we're gonna end up certainly nearer to five ten than five forty. Erm, but if we er are are going to en ensure that ministers can get er, at least twelve a of twelve thousand next year then we have to er erm there has to be further offers from provinces. As I say, there are three provinces who'd like to go further and than that be even er, more increases. Now, I have put down reports about the finance committee er as it were but I think the responses from the churches and districts sort of calculator will be there, we think that it would seem as though we should only offer the same amount as last year. But, I think if we have further discussions with churches and districts that we might see that we can break that a bit further for that reason when we come to er, come to the resolutions I would advise you er er propose a minor amendment with the second thing. But I think that er . We can now receive this report for the . Any questions or comments on paragraphs that are not erm relating to those ? So any questions or comments on paragraph one on page thirteen? Or paragraph two or paragraph three or paragraph five or paragraph that's it! Yes. So, if there are no questions or comments on those paragraphs erm we move to the other resolutions. be amended ? I think so, yes. Yes. Er, what I would like to propose the erm a a that resolution two of course, was put down at the time it had to be put down er, and is clearly going to be affected by, that it happened at the th the financial services in March and what I have suggested is that you might prefer this be a a a second resolution it is or and turn to the to add on the end of that resolution thus urging local churches to through their consultations with district treasurers and finance committee to increase their contributions to the Ministry of Mission Fund in nineteen ninety three in such a way that provincial commi , commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two . But th , the thing is that it looks as though it is going to be a fairly ongoing thing that's going to it may be well on certainly er a beyond assembly when we have to come to a conclusion, and therefore we ought to know the picture er, of, within reform churches far more clearly in giving more time. But, clearly we need to have the authority that the that er to having discussed to a form of . And, If I understand this now Mm. er, we have a choice the resolution before us,endorse the action taken by the provincial treasurer in the level of commitment he has made to the MMF fund in nineteen ninety three on behalf of the . And that commitment which Alan has made, I'm right Alan? Yes. Is a nought percent increase It's nought percent. over our commitment. Erm would you like to take that resolution first and make this a sort of a, an extra resolution Right, okay then. I think that will be that will be clearer. First of all if we debate now whether or not the Synod endorses the action taken by judicial moderator Treasurer. in the level of commitment he has made to the MMF fund of nineteen ninety three on behalf of the provence and we now know that that's a commitment, was a commitment of a nought percent increase. We'll debate that first. It's gotta be done first. Mm? David? Can I just clarify Stand up please! David , can I just clarify that this resolution now supersedes what is said in the report? No, er we're proposing that we just do, take this reso , in other words, if you endorse the fact that I say I I sa committed the But what do you say about Yes. the ones you've written down? Yeah, that's right, yes. The, because this report has been written three or four weeks ago before Alan was able to vet all the information. And in view of the information he had when he went to London for a meeting last Wednesday and that was when he consulted with other people deciding that he should offer a nought percent increase. Okay? So that's right. Erm, one can then . perhaps cure the provincial credit brought to us . And following that recommendation we accepted a rash amendment on the floor of . Increasing the commitment with the treasurer and not to be rash with it but the people understand people who are mostly killed in churches and and either way should not pass to amend a resolution for the Council . You're not with it ! at the er the ministry but maybe the ministry er will be . Could we not have er I think procedure is could we not have the er er resolution for the at first and now that a ministry is in motion? Erm I think we need to endorse the action taken by the judicial treasurer and then if we was then to go onto second bits, which is urging the churches to give five percent more than that in the past you could debate that se separately. Investigative procedure will follow and we keep the two things clear we're making the the treasurer is erm suggesting that this provence of the URC makes no , makes not to increase. There's no to increase over this year 's commitment. That's what we've proposed. Er Bob? I've got a question on Bob! does that mean that the assessment for each church will remain the same for a couple of years? Is that the er, is that the implication? Erm But does it still need, somehow No, I can't or other if the assessment will increase? It will vary because er erm er we we ac remember that we have a formula which will expose to what your er erm, nominated income was in previous years what the membership, you know, these have all changed so it could be i I wouldn't like to say it's exactly the same could be a bit of a problem! But also there you can ministers because minis er churches they count for more than two years stop being central funds and therefore, if we had too many churches that entered a third year of vacancy next year that puts more of a burden on churches with ministers. Mm. So i i it just depends on Thank you. May I ask one more thing? By, by very special Oh! ! Erm in order to meet a commitment which is the same as this year commitment then last here increasing last year because this year's commitment we will not reach this year therefore, we'll be into deficit! Therefore, to pay that commitment again the churches must be asked to give more and ask the treasurer to make a further commitment and the churches must find more again! So it can't be the same as in churches even if it stays in the profit? Any other comments? Keep them coming! to say from what we . Right. Cos I don't mind taking this action erm, I think the the thought is that I would like to propose that we have a word with the government. Because I think that they and that we can only say the same again next year when our own , everything goes up and, I think it's very sad that the church can't ! Is that a formal amendment? Yes it is. Is there a seconder to that formal amendment. Does anybody want to speak for that amendments now? That we add the words with sadness to the resolution? Could I, say also with sadness that in that that, yes things are going up but one thing isn't going up and tha , that's our membership. Yes. Mm. And that is as one of the members of, we have a I think we can afford to have member on the finance of churches who are called at the assembly of the URC who er Good, yes! in fact, erm anybody that says a lot of sensible things and says look if people are asked to er, to er increase their giving by nought percent that me , it probably means the church might have to be cos the membership has gone down! Mm mm. Thanks. Mm mm. The amendment to add the word with sadness to this resolution number two on page sixteen is before you those in support of the amendment that we add the words with sadness to the resolution please show. And those against the amendment please show. The amendment is carried. So the resolution before us now is that the Synod endorses english grammar writing ! Synod endorses with sadness the action taken by the provincial treasurer in the level of commitments he has made to MMF in nineteen ninety three. We'll be making that resolution. If there are no other further comments or questions set before you would you show if you're in favour of resolution two of page sixteen ? In favour? Those against? We now move to the erm sort of, two A which I will now as and this will be that Synod urges local churches through their consultations with district treasurers and the finance committee to incrus , increase their contribution to MMF in nineteen ninety three in such a way that the provincial commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two budgets targets sorry! Targets! I'll read it again that we, that Synod urges local congregations through their consultations with district treasurers and finance committee to increase their contributions to MMF in nineteen ninety three in such a way that the provincial commitment may be increased by fi , by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two targets. If anybody would like to speak. Could I just say a ? Yes. I think I should while you're putting the words in such a way so it wasn't a er, it wasn't thought that everybody just increased everything by five percent. But as I say the the people who did not five five percent er, therefore, others may not have given more! Others may give less because they've got a lot of members so that therefore it's so that the provence as a whole could be advised. And I would have thought us giving five percent and, and there are other provinces that are giving more will ensure at least the the on twelve thousand we pay next year and therefore, starting with eleven and half thousand we paid this year and that provinces and in ourselves went further than that it is possible . Not very good! Surely, John erm, at home would like today off fishing! . How much longer moderator can we in the Welsh provence accept being the poor relationship within the denominations? Indeed, how much longer can we expect the other provinces to continue carrying us? We are no poorer than some of the Mm. noble provinces! No. Because we hear great erm shouts,cackulations of joy from those provinces that can afford to increase their giving shouldn't allow us to sit on our morals! I think it's a great tragedy that Wales considers itself to be the poor relation within the United Reform Church and the answer can only lie within Wales! I can't come en , elsewhere we have to support this motion too! Any other comments? The motion is before that Synod urges local churches through their consultations with district treasurers and the finance committee to increase their contribution to MMF in nineteen ninety three in such a way that th , that the provincial commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two targets. For those in favour please show? And those against please show? And that's carried. So we move to resolution three on page sixteen. I think erm er I know there has been some discussion of I I about er and I put er, in this report I think all the documentation that the ministers and ministers that had already seen it and I've explained that the big issue is that er the URC, I think a weekly account o ah of all other informations has er, worked out very on the basis of five thousand and I was been tugging you pay your car off to get that and . The church in Wales er and and from a a survey of one church in Church of England in Hemel Hempstead, I discovered that their rate seemed to be about thirty two P per mile. You've got to work it out on the basis of ten miles not on the basis of five miles. I think also er, and this er, it may be that the er er URC does not want to be pushed round er, we got up er, to how many ministers this applies but I do know there are quite a number of ministers which who need their own cars a and a a at the church that pays the er, insurance, the road license and even something for the maintenance. Now, clearly if you were paid say six hundred pounds for that and you only did twelve hundred miles, you're getting fifty P a mile anyway! And they've got, I think the odds are that people are giving more perhaps er and that er, if they were paid at fifty four P per mile and and got how that would affect the churches er contributions they make? And therefore, er our proposal is that we should adopt the figures at the bottom of the page which are actually those which the the er er, Inland Revenue have recognised in ones where you don't have to er, put in a tax return for.. for . So resolution three isbefore you for discussion . Peter? I know I'm a ! Reading for our , I mean er, I supply my own car, my church has recognised that whether I'm probably if I pay the tax and the insurance erm and I just thirty two, thirty five that's but when I'm in business or I'm in provinces and I'm allowed to pay what, ten fifteen Fifteen. pence a mile? Fifteen. And I do not or be subsidised, you know a a I mean I think that's consistency. Well I I shall leave you to go through the questions for a few minutes. from from , erm I'm rather concerned about what the er, provence here is intending to do! Erm, I've worked for ten and a half years within this county of Clwyd as a social worker, regarded as an extensional and every year my employers er, who are based in London would like the county to know what were the remec recommended mileage rates for the reimbursel to a business car mileage? Now, if Clwyd or Gwynedd or any other county for that matter, within Wales or in England er, decided that in themselves that they would not implement the national recommendation er, then there duly would be all hell to pay, and rightly so! And certainly now that of course, ministers don't have a union unfortunately! Er No. they would allow me half now erm I've been looking at one particular church, one denomination er, which is the Methodist Church, although it has been said already here this afternoon, or this morning rather there are an overall erm joint style with Methodist and with United Reform Church and erm I have personally the Methodist of last year, last September where it gives and also erm, mileage recommendations. I'll be viewing the Methodist Church in quite a different way, but I think it's very important for us to be made aware of how they do it erm for example, if you have erm a a or or and I don't think any church has, are provided within that and gets alike. In addition to that you get depreciation of one thousand one hundred and forty four pound per year which, by my reckoning is ninety five pound a month in addition to that, as a Methodist Minister you get a standing charge of five hundred and twenty eight pound per year which is forty four pound pe er, per month and then you also through i in the year if you have a major repair needed on your car you get a hundred and eight pound now, if in fact, I had , I have a Vauxhall Nova, and let me take these figures as you are at twenty four P a mile, or twenty four point five P a mile and if that's all we are recommended, recommending, in other words, there's no lump sum at all er, that would mean that I would be getting forty nine pound but Methodist , this colleague in Llandudno if he did Perhaps I shouldn't do this yet cos we haven't agreed it! But we have a new secretary. Er, if you agree it an and report. And I'm gonna ask Catherine to stand up so that you can all see who she is. We're involved in bringing things together, we're involved lots of things and At the back in black. there are lots of things At the back in black. committee, if you go downstairs you will see on the notice there a display of various things that we do, and on the windowsills there are various pieces of information free sheets that you can pick up and take away it will tell you about all sorts of issues! The way in which society imposes an agenda on us asks us questions in the churches. I think we're not too bad in doing that. But what we need to do as well, is to listen wha to what the churches are saying as they address these issues. And I want to erm ask you please if you have any comments about the work of The Old Church and Society Committee, the work we do fo fo for Synod and in the provence please make those comments known to Catherine or to your district representative! We need to hear from the local churches, from the district councils what's going on wha what the issues that concern you are so let's as well the ones that you see downstairs, we may already be addressing so have a look down there have a look at the, the information but if there are any issues you feel we ought to be addressing then please let us know so that we can put them on our agenda. That's all I want to say except to er, who, that Synod received the report of the Church and Society committee? I'm assuming you've read that report? Have you received it? Yeah. Yes. Does anybody wish to make any comments or ask any questions about this particular section? Don't think that's a lack of interest, I think it's matter of discipline! Oh Good! Okay then.. Thank you Peter and thank you Catherine erm we will give the view in due course. We move to the DP committee report which is on page seventeen. I'm gonna go very speedily and ask that we receive this report for debate. Good! Yes. Any comments on any section that is not pertaining to the resolution that was on page nineteen? Erm one from Mike Mike? and is that , I always feel threatened or paranoid I just want to make a point on on paragraph seven the rule in which to review the is that my understanding that review will be about the role and of the rule in which the . We will note that in a minute. Right. Er I just wanna refer to item one which is to do with the Synod . That's actually a different resolution. Is it? So we come back to that. Well Do you wannit Ah! ah! Right I would say Sorry! Sorry! Any other comments about any other questions not pertaining to the resolution there? We therefore come to resolution two in which to make it to paragraph one You're so gracious John! So it's just simply to er comment about the the future work that's gonna be done by Glanmole er, the work of investigation as I understand it at the end true. Then you and said right Yes . It's not just the cooking, I mean he can cook, but you need somebody else to say, what are we going to have and either go and buy it or this and that and They don't think about it . It's all that. What about the clearing up when they have, when they have cooked. Oh yes. The use three dishes and bowls for everyone Oh yeah , you've used. oh absolutely, absolutely . It's horrendous . Yes, they, it really is extraordinary. My son in law's, one of them is not too good Good morning . but at least he does decorate, good morning, he does decorating and things and he helps like that , Henry bally please . and he will do a bit of washing up, they don't want to use the washing up machine. Henry bally, come on bally down, come on Ginny . But my middle son in law is absolutely marvellous. He wants, he wants to . did he come out off?,. I don't know. Watch him Henry, watch him . His mother had two sons, and she said they're not going to be helpless, you've lost it stupid. . They both went into the Scout's and the Rangers and Edie made each of them do their own bed, do their bedrooms on Saturday's Oh. and now, I mean, Debbie, Debbie has well Debbie is And somebody somewhere is reaping the benefit of appreciate all Debbie's got this horrendous pregnancy having lost two baby's you see Yes. she's got this horrendous pregnancy . now, and Richard is working all day and because Debbie's been told she's got to have bed, bed rest Yeah. Erm, he'll come in in the evening he's done the shopping, he cleans the house, they live in a converted barn Mm. so you can imagine how big it is. don't. He vacuums, he cooks her a meal Oh god To try and tempt her appetite because she's throwing up Did you say she had two son's?, is the other one married?. Two sons , the other one's dead. Oh shame . Yep. That's my sort of chap. Yep. I'm afraid he er Yet there are some around . he was one of the sixties products who got onto all the drugs and things . Yep, and had a stroke, a brain haemorrhage . Oh lord . Mm. But you know honestly, the mother's like Ken, who do their children absolutely no, no, they're now the proud owner's of three sons all of them, well John's on his second marriage, Ken's on his second marriage and will be on his second marriage Yep. and quite honestly, I think they not only do they not bring them up to do, I mean useful like that, but I thought Ken's his family never showed any affection any warmth, any caring, any love, and I would do anything for anyone if they just say thank you, but with Ken My mother in law, was just, that, the other way round. She was drooling all over him Oh . in his fifties, it was my baby boy. Oh . It used to make you want to throw up sometimes. Believe . I couldn't believe it when I first, first year of marriage and when I got pregnant, er, we'd walk into her, well it's her daughter's erm sitting room, she'd struggle up out of an arm chair and I'd think oh gosh, I know she mustn't get up for me, got the tummy out here , Yes . and the baby have this chair, not her pregnant daughter in law, but her baby boy.

Well I worked, he took me out Yeah, but, I had to take over, where she left off. I know, it is alarming isn't it? I, it took me a long time, time to realise that one can be for a mug. otherwise the place was a tip. Oh yes, I used to live, we used to live in a three bedroomed semi in before we moved to our present house, and one Christmas Ken said why don't all our family to us, which was his mother, his father, his elder brother, his wife, two little girls from them, Tony, Karen and their little one God. grandmother and I think there was an aunt, and I said Ken were living in a three bedroomed semi, oh they won't mind for Christmas. They won't mind. And they rang up, and they said were sending you a list of what we expect to be available in the way of food at Christmas because we always have the same thing. Yes. , and I ended up virtually people in a fish tank. Yeah. And they all said now look is there anything we can do and I said no, it's not, if you're coming to me as far as I'm concerned I will do it, you need anything and I will cope. not one of those females worked Oh no. they were all at home all day I was Oh no . the only one who worked full time, they came on Christmas Eve with reluctant, because I said look I'm sorry but I have to work Christmas Eve lunch time, and they said right we'll be there at five past one, and I finish at one, there were there at five past one, they finally left two days after Christmas because I said I'm sorry I have to go back to work today. Yes. Oh, oh, well we'd better go then, but we'll come back next year because that was good I said no I'm sorry you won't actually I'm going I've done my little bit for a while, no one else . my daughter's now . And I thought what a fool, none of them work No. and I spend the whole bloody lot slaving all Christmas You should have said so and so could you come and do so and so love, my daughter's now do Christmas for me Jesus . because one Christmas about four, . four years ago chain saw? I think so. Henry, Lucy Lucy, oh she's such a rat bag, hang on to go and get her over here. Come on, come on, it's a horrible noise isn't it? Oh yes, it's just under growth. You know we were saying about erm Foxes and rabbits Claire and Yeah, oh great. . Great. But I found that But erm , now, I mean my girls used to come to me with boy, boy friends as they grew up and then husbands, but they always help, they always yeah , helped with the bedrooms and things like that you see, now that's what I the family would do. the clearing up, they always gave a hand, but even so, they, they didn't realise that the three weeks before hand The sheer graft of trading round the shops, getting it all in , humping it all home, The lists, the planning, the food . packing it all away Yes , yes, and all the rest of it . and all the rest of it . Oh my god. My husband's eh, never bought the Christmas presents, he buys one and usually he'd only get that from one of the girls, what shall I get mum can you do . So he doesn't actually go out and do He doesn't have to do anything, but about four Christmas's ago I had the whole lot down, I had nine of us for the whole Christmas week, erm, Boxing Day I went in the kitchen, two of Diane's friends had arrived, who lived in London and I went in the kitchen, I'd had a bad dose of the flu virus that was Oh , going around and I'd worked right through it because of all the Christmas preparation we don't have another option do you? and I went into the kitchen and I fell down, first time in my life, I've never passed out, not That's right , even in pregnancies or anything mm. next thing I remember was being undressed and in bed with Debbie standing there with a boiled egg on a tray, saying mummy were so sorry you'll never do Christmas again, you've done it for us for forty years, we shall do it for you now. Oh, bless her cotton socks. And they have ever since. Oh bless them, and let them keep on doing it .

The longer you throw, the more , good boy, it's so well hidden in the leaves, it's exactly the same colour that's the trouble this time of year, but no, life is a funny thing, and I find it personally very hard to believe that only two months ago, I mean what is it nine weeks ago, and I suddenly had an enormous view Yes, and yet here you are , It knocks you on your heels doesn't it?. absolutely . I can see it, it knocked you back on your heels . But you find that you can do things you've never dreamt of. Yes. You find out who your friends are. Yes.

No, yes, I think it's . Even for their injections every year you know, and the, their worming twice a year. I can understand if they take time on a stray dog I often wondered if they realise He was , he was in the rescue. what they're walking into, Yeah. the pet rules, were saying whether it's a pedigree . Oh well I've it because I've had two pedigree's Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't be horrible , It's alright . don't be horrible. , right. I think they were only talking.

I put on my old trouser's and welly boots this morning, it said it was going to be so messy . Well I thought of my wellies and I thought, I was just worried about falling of the pebbles, mind you,safe as these. I can only wear short ones otherwise they catch on the back of the driving seat and I don't like that. It's horrible. Anything that makes me,im impedes me, yes. normal progress. Yes, just happened at the wrong time. Well this week I have to fly up to Liverpool on the early morning shuttle Yes. on Thursday, we go on a book buying expedition, every year, June and me, we choose a lot of books of , but it's a lot more fun to go and actually pick the things off the shelve Oh lovely . and there's a library supplier, advertised to a box shop up in Lytham Saint Anne's So it's all paid for. oh yes,shuttle Ah? oh you'll love it, on the shuttle with the representative of Midlands, the firm get's us the other end and drives up to, we spend all day hacking around . on the shelves there . I didn't know they had a big library. Oh, yes, it's a three million books, it's called Help Jackson, it's one of the very, very old and that, I literally Oh so, the public is nothing . three million books on the shelve, and we don't have time going properly at the price so we go anything you want, bung it on the trolley and soon as the trolleys full it's taken away and another one given, and you poke around and then in the evening, you stay in a hotel overnight, and then the following morning, they get and you just sort of send up the money and they just shout up the money as we go, then,every time I get to a thousand they say one, two, and you say right, tell me when I get near three,and I've got this erm, I'm dreadful at maths, I failed maths O Level three times and I don't think about prices, I've never been more than fifteen pounds out . Carry a computer . I can't, you haven't got time. No. I've never been more than fifteen pounds out, at the end of the day which is unbelievable. Well, very good . It's just somewhere. This is what the Government pay for? This is all for provided for Broadmoor. For the, for the inmates of Broadmoor? Yeah oh yes. They have a, a life of Riley don't they? Well, the trouble is that they've got a closed Think about it . population, whereas in a public library there are people using the , some of for life so therefore you can't even send year in and year out they have to constantly changing Huh, you have more sympathy for them than I do. aha, ha. My first sympathy is with the people that they're in there because of, if you see what I mean? Hello love, I mean if they, if they were in cells without any books to read or televisions to watch I wouldn't have that much sympathy, my sympathy is with the little girls Yes. who've been left Oh yes, I can understand that, but it's in the same way as assaulted in bushes , you don't hate someone, because they have to oh no I don't hate them. you don't hate someone cos they have Leukaemia, you can't really hate someone Oh no , who has schizophrenia, they're, they're because they've no , done something, because of the illness . I feel sorry for them there, but for the grace of god, does anyone of us? If they're sick in their heads , if they're sick in their heads and they have to rape little girls. Mm. But my first thought is for the little girls Oh yes, I . and I would stick a needle in their bottom while they were fast asleep, so they didn't wake up any more, just like you would with an animal that does that. Mm, it's very easy to think that, until you know them as people, I must admit, there are , Yes, I can see your point , there is a hardcore, see, it's not necessarily what they've done, but when you meet them there's something instinctively repulsive about them yes. and not in, not necessarily the most seriousness, something the way they look at you Yeah. that to me is a hundred per cent unacceptable Yes. and you just think yuck and you have to try and cover over, you can't say, god you're vile aren't you?, but erm, Well I remember, so I used to talk to the nurses quite a lot when I walked Roxanna, my other German shepherd, in Wellington Yes. and quite a lot of the nurses used to walk their nurses, I mean they're er war trained and unarmed combat and they're wardens, let's face it, they're not nurses, and one of them was saying to me, oh we had a fellow in the other day, he'd, he'd a, fallen up the police stations steps I think erm, he said that he'd been to see the do gooders, he had this interview Mm. and he convinced them he didn't need an operation, he was, he was cured, he'd had his treatment,psy psychiatrist that seen him and he was all right thank you, he said, and they're so clever they can convince anybody on the outside Oh yes, yes . Yes we ask a psychopath now why Exactly, and as they took him back to his room, not his cell, but his room, he turned to my, my mate who was with me and said er, I don't want an operation I like having sex with little girls, he said now I've got two little girls and I had to turn and walk away mm. I said I can understand, he said I had to turn and walk away because my fingers were itching Yes, I find it a lot easier actually not to know what they've done, when you start work there you tend to come over these cases, which to do Yeah. as much as anything, but it's only cos you're writing a letter, and you say oh hello you writing a letter to mum, he says no I killed her to come here, you don't put your foot in it a big way, but after a while because you know nobody there is nice it really makes a lot of difference people . you don't think oh here comes a rapist, here's a sex offender, he's a whatever, just to take them as they come as people, because you've got to treat them all the same anyway Yes, but this fellow you see, I said to him erm, you had a lot to do with that fellow, he'd, he'd been down to collect him from someone on the South Coast as well with a police of course, and I said what happened to the little girl? he said oh she's been in psychiatric care, care for four years oh yeah. and there's no chance of her, and she was shattered, her, her life was ruined . Oh their life's can be totally wrecked, I don't doubt it for a moment. But I didn't have much sympathy for the man who was There, there are those who it gives a going out and Who's got a cigarette ration and his television , you think, oh my god, you know, I'll put loads of money on him,. yeah, do you remember the one, two or three years ago who talked to do gooders, that he was, he was fine and he was let out and first, within twenty four hours he'd gone down to the South Coast and killed his mother and his girl friend Yes, oh yes. just like that. Yes, there are those who . I mean I would, I would I'd stick a needle in their bottoms just like I would for a dog that had gone b , gone bad, I'd say poor creature can't help it There are some, but then you see Ginny there's a girl in there . I feel sorry for the victims There's a girl in there killed her daddy, but whey did she kill daddy, she killed daddy because Cos dad , he'd raped her and abused her from yes , the age of six and a half well she shouldn't be in there . Who's, who's the wrong one there?. She shouldn't be in there. She needs help. She shouldn't be in there. Exactly, but I mean I rest my case, there's, when you know their entire story, some of them, it makes you wonder who's more sinning against than sinning it's a strange affair. I think she had every right to . Yes, so do I,. Just to fight . But then future is hatred of men, she's likely to go out and kill every other Yes , man she comes across. yes. Your duties then is to protect the outside world and her from her health. Yeah. So I mean it, it's obviously a lot more sort of complicated as it seems on the outside . take everyone individual . Henry, come back you silly thing. . . Come here and sit. What a lot of walk for your fuel wasn't it? Can't you get your van down? It's a long walk. . You like suffering be honest, you like suffering. You drove past me the other day when I drov , was it you? When I I did drive the other day, yeah . When I whipped him , when I whipped him into the side just down there. Yeah. I heard this, this, a range rover coming ever so, ever so patiently behind me at walking pace, I suddenly realised there was something behind me. Was that a Sunday morning walk Ginny?. a bit busier on the Sunday . I think so, yes, yes. Walked all around yesterday lunch time, didn't see a soul in the pla , I saw one, was it you, on the back meadow? I wasn't there yesterday . There was one chap in the green thingy, yeah. Oh you're so butch and Henry, bye, bye Don't work too hard. I'll see you, phone you one day in the week, I saw the post lady coming up the drive and I said to Henry who's that, he threw himself against the top window so there was indeed someone coming up the drive, tore into the dinning room, picked up his tennis ball, raced back to the window and wow, wow, wow , with his ball in his mouth, and I said Henry you're really going to frightened off intruders with a ball in your mouth, I said . Oh no , honestly he would, if there was strangers. Yes, oh I'm sure he would, but I mean,. Wow, wow, wow is enough , yes, he goes mad at the post, he drags it all across, all across the hall, all through the lounge. . Oh yes, I would too if they had one . , ring up the and say sorry my dog ate it. Yes. . Yes, oh Rocket, for the first few months I had him, after he was rescued, and he was so protective of me, because I'd given him a good home and never, never hit him in the face . It's so , take sides No he goes up, he puts his , Is he yours?. no put's his paws on Keith and wags his tail and says, hit me. I'll take it. I'll take, that's what he was got used to you see Really . Can't bear angry voices, first he used to go underneath the rocking chair And hide. and hide, now, even if Keith's arguing with the television, which he would, Politician, he'll still go up and put his paws up on his knee, wag his tail, and bury his head and say, hit me instead , Here I am , oh I'm, I'm the punch bag Oh painful. and I'd call him Oh , and then give him a game and take his mind off it, and take him in the kitchen give him oh poor Rocket , a, give him a chew or a treat or something you know. poor Rocket, god how awful. Roxanna if ever, er god forbid, if ever he's raised his hand, Roxanna would have had him I think Though she never did with you really because that, I Threatened her once or twice . out the door like that I'd put them out the door just like that . yes. You've got to . Oh yes, oh yes, now he knows better. Good. Dinda's er trained him along,, well, a very good self defence. Mm. And she's had no hesitation, she'll . Mm. Absolutely. Unbelievable. She would knife him if she had too, and then of course she'd end up in Broadmoor,. We'd love to look after her you see. Yeah. I use the word love very, very loosely, like be honest I don't think I love, you can feel the that love Yeah , is not one of the emotions. I think there is sympathy erm for the people who are sick of course I can . I think some, some of the illness are so devastatingly terrified, that you can only think thank god, not to have that, because it must be so frightening, unlike some of these schizophrenia are hair raising Yes, but there are undoubtedly Yes, is the good, bad and the ugly in there Yes, and there are some who are on a very trip from here to jail Yes. because if some of ours were in jail, they'd be killed. Of course. Sex offenders, and rape little girls, hurt policeman, they're not liked . They always get beaten up . They would never survive Yeah, especially when it's their own little girl never survive, their own little children. but some of them are repulsive Yeah I won't kid you, and it's very hard to say good morning John how are you, when you're thinking , and you're thinking you stay your side of . hand full always from the back of your , back of your necks going. in the you think please god don't let Joe Bloggs come out this morning, good morning Joe,first one out .

Oh I am, I'm , Enjoying your job , I'm not letting the bugger get me down that's for sure. and, and if ever you think of it, just think Ginny would give her back, back teeth . Do you know, it's a most peculiar thing, a number of people who said, erm, one of our really made me laugh, a couple of Friday's ago, came and said to me, typical , Christ, he's done you a big favour hasn't he? What you mean? He said, it's bloody wonderful you said, it's taken years off you and I said thank you . It has, it has , it has. It's not all bad Ginny, it really isn't, and a number of women who think, Christ is alarming,you know. Yes, yeah. But now . Well to be quite , to be quite honestly sweety, I mean, I look at him and I think I'm not unfond of him Mm. He's the father of my three girls Mm. who's in my life, Oh yes, yeah. and if it hadn't been for him I wouldn't have them, Yes. mind you, I'd have somebody else's. your girls are your daughters Yes, but you know for years, when they were growing up in their teens, I was the the tennis net between him and his daughters, where's she going, who's she going with, who's bringing her home, is she wearing eye make up, why's she wearing nylons and not ankle socks , Oh no , I was always the buffer between the two, I used to say I agree with you dear, I don't want her to wear nylons, that's not the point, all her friends are wearing nylons and she's not going to be the that's right, do you want odd one out. up on her own? She's not going to feel the odd one out. Mm. It doesn't make much difference to us, we're not that hard up, that we can't afford So you're really getting it all along the line aren't you? until they left home, first of all it was I break his bloody neck taking advantage of my daughter, cos they each lived with their Oh yeah. boy, boy friends before, they married them, they weren't sleep, if they'd been sleeping around then I would of said something, then I would of said something to them , Something else, oh yes, yes . but it was one man and they stuck to him, and they, they lived with them first and then they married. Do you, honestly in this day and age I don't think that's a really bad thing, because until you're with someone all the time, who knows what, you'd never have got in, you'd never have gone in would you?. Only too, god if I lived with him first, I would never of married him, no, no, no way No. No way, if I'd known him. . The whole courtship was a tissue of lies, you know. Mm. Where he lived, where, when he was born, where he was born, what his parents did Really? Everything was lies. Can't believe him I really don't . Complete lies , yeah. . Any way we'll continue this merry saga and put Yes . the world's to right weekend. And now I had a lovely fellow I'd grown up with in the same village, the same sort of background, we'd known each other since we were eleven, twelve , Oh dear, where's he now? he's still in love with me he says, in eh, working in Birmingham, living in Bristol. . Phones me up now and again, oh yeah, I'll have you. Still dreams about me Well you never, ever know Ginny . one day I'll tell you a story. Met him in Stratford last summer when Dinda and I had a cottage , tell you a story , Dinda and I had a cottage in Stratford last, we made sure that father was going to Plymouth to Debbie's for the week, he said he adores it down there yeah. he didn't really like it, but he had a lovely week, but at least we didn't come back to a house that's full of Oh absolutely. full bedclothes and dirty crock. Hello, hello, hello,. . She had, she had so many warnings And I thought oh god But he looks bright. He went yesterday, I was gonna come up this afternoon and tell you when Peter came home, can't leave him, he was so naughty yesterday, he licked , Atten , he licked that, although yeah , she said he mustn't lick it. yes he'll have to have a collar on . I only went upstairs to get sort of washed and dressed, after the weekend, you have nobody around and er, oh eh, it started bleeding. But it's natural for them to lick a wound. It is, but it opens it up Yes. You see as it's quite nasty. Cos normally they aren't stitched, they have to heal by nature Yeah. I suppose. He erm What a good boy aren't you? and I thought oh what she gonna say, because he went yesterday afternoon Yes. and she said, I told you he had been licking, she said oh, even with the licking, that's excellent I'm very pleased. Oh really has healed nice . And she said he's not out of the woods yet, but, I'll give you a collar, if he's naughty, very crafty,and then I looked through the crack in the door and his looking . But how can he reach it with the collar on? Well I You've got the collar on back to front. I know, because he can still reach it the other way round. Oh, it should be . Yes, I did, I put it on that way And he could reach?. And he could, see he's got a little . It's so long isn't it?. Yes, this is it, you see, I don't think she thought of Cos it's a . Yeah, and even if, even Got long under carriage, haven't you darling. mummy he's still licking,I thought what am I gonna do? So, I put it on the other way round this morning and he hates it, I've only just done it Oh they do hate it. and he, he can't get round there . At least he can see , I mean Roxanna Yeah , had to have one for a short while, she was quite young and I, we'd only just moved here and I took her to the vet the used to be in Sandhurst, they said it was a bee sting, they put purple stuff on it oh. It didn't get any better and somebody told me about and I took her down there, oh Mrs she's picked up mange, I said mange, I know she said you feel just like when your child's got nits in their hair Yeah don't worry, it's, it's in the grass and she's just picked it up in the heat wave. So to stop it cos she always used to clear the foxes from the top garden, but er, because she worried it, it was about there on her patch Oh yes, a niggle . a bald patch , yes, so she had wear, actually we had to cut down a plastic bucket cos she was a big dog Oh yeah. cut down a plastic bucket and fixed that, it was great she had a bucket round her, round her Oh she'd only do that when thing . I sort of popping upstairs, when I'm here, I'll take it off him, but just now he, he was walking along like Let him get used to it. as though he could walk, but when you came to the door, here . Yeah, yeah, he'd forgot all about it, didn't he, he was putting it on you see. , yeah, yeah, this is it. They don't half get you at it, don't they? They do, they, they could wear you out. But he's eating well going to the loo alright. Good, I, I thought of you following him around watching what he was going to do. Oh my dear I was, it, you sort of feel exhausted with the worry of it don't you? Yes and the And the strain. Of course you must of emptied his lower bowel, when she did the operation Yes. so there would of been nothing there for him to go for, you must of been ever so worried following him around watching him . I was , because I, I felt oh, if it all comes to pieces it's all gonna bleed Yes. but he was alright and he didn't strain cos he couldn't go Mm. . Was there any way he And he's eating it alright. Oh good. I, I just put it on his dinner, cos there's no way that I squirt it in his mouth, I'd probably choke him. Yeah, yeah. I just put it on his dinner and he, he's licking all his bowls clean Oh good. so, that it's working. So he's not off his food, that's a good sign. No. He's certainly alert, that's why I didn't want to ring the bell , Yeah , so that he wouldn't upset himself by barking, that's why I tapped on the window when I saw you. . There Herbie. What a good boy. Yeah, you're still not having he says , What a good boy , but he's quite bright eyed . he's aged , he's aged round he's eyes. Yeah, ten and a half years old. Your .

I mean before he was all loose and baggy That's right, he was. Were erm, where he had . And then of course he hasn't, he hasn't got testicles any more.

Well it wouldn't be for you would it? Well not really. It depends on doesn't it? Those Ercoles that we got, those wing they're too they're too low for me. I think they are Surprising, yeah. inches.

Well she convinced me to start off with foam, you know webbing on the foam and I said well Yes. she said it's a lot cheaper and easier, so I hadn't got the springs at that time No. You re , you really but then er somebody said don't do that you've gotta think what the value That's right. of how it's Definitely! supposed to me. See, I did it So once in the end I persevered when I first came when I first came, that was the one thing that I was like that was the fact that that I might be pushed that way whereas I only Mm. really nice he's thinking that I mean that, he couldn't never lift the seat up. Oh it's gorgeous! That's why I love the sprung hair and the horse hair ideally, you know I love it! I mean, do you know Now that'd be better for me better for you but then I as I say, you don't cater for every height on the Whe chair do you? When I went to Noreen's if I make that to be used with a cushion or without Mm. she can always put the cushion over the Yes. and then take it off the chair . Well it , ah well, of course the other thing you'd have to do to do that is put a top Oh I'll do that in there. Oh that's what you're doing is it? I've got enough material. Oh well! I've got enough material. So you're gonna give this a top stuffing? Yes. No, I'm gonna give that a top cover for this . Yeah. That's what I want. I see, just one, I see yeah. That's right. So all you want is a bit of erm on the side you know, piece of wadding Wadding. I've got the both types. Well that's great! I've got the narrow and I've got the thick. That's great! So she can please herself can't Mm. she? And you can make I think the that loose. Yeah, and then Good! she, if she wants a cushion she can put it on, and You're happy! Joan's happy! That's right. Everyone's . That's a good idea that! That's, that's got one. You've got in effect, a dual purpose Mm. chair haven't you? I if I set it up there It's too low is it, for you? Well I see yes.

Oh I bet there's . Still And and we accepted it. Did you? Yes. Because we went b I think I wasn't er a very well child and the doct when I left school the doctor said I left school at fourteen and he said I had to erm find a job out of doors. Now where could you find a job out of doors? So I went to work to the old market place in the high street when it was an old market an open market you know where McKays is now, McKays whatever. Oh yes Yeah? When it was an old fashion open market and erm I went to work there on the fruit and vegetable stall. And I think our wages were about twelve and six a week and then it went to fifteen shillings a week. I think I ended up by having just over a pound a week or something like that. And of course a all that was given to my mother, I us I never used to get nothing back. The whole of it? The whole of it yes. So she was getting oh I'd say about ten bob from my sister in Liverpool and my wages and my sister Mary's m money. So erm and she didn't have him to keep so she was better off that way you know. After the a er after the time when when you began to support your mum Yeah. did you notice any change in her ? Oh she was a much happier person then. Oh yes she was. She was much happier person because this this she'd threatened to do for a long time. That when we grow up grew up to help support the home sort of thing. That she would you know throw him out so that she could just couldn't tolerate him any more. And of course we agreed with her. So because it er as I said it was a relief to her i were a relief to us as children because then we weren't living in in terror of him coming home and you know causing the bother. Do d do you think your father was unusual in Hirael at that time or or was that kind of behaviour by men accepted? Oh it was accepted in them days. Was it? I'm sorry that I was unable to get, well two things went wrong first of all the date of the exhibition's changed Gaugin and his friends in Brittany, due to circumstances beyond our control. But in this programme you'll appreciate this planned months, its planned, when did I first contact you?, oh February wasn't it, right, so we thought we'd have pictures here and Sue would be talking in front of the pictures. I didn't know at that time what the content of the exhibition was because Sarah who organised it all had to write to lots of people and arrange the loans and you know it is fairly recently that we discovered for example the tate would lend, their pictures because its very rare that they do, erm, and, so we thought the next best thing, when I discovered the change of dates would be to have slides of the pictures that Sue was using, but erm oh dear then wonderful that Sue was using a another book and this term allocated and I wasn't able to get the slides she picked, it was my fault that they're not on slide due to the amount of time that we had to do this. Therefore I'm afraid were going to have to pass Sue's book around , we'll leave the lights on and erm she's changed the scripture of her talks so that she will be describing the picture why'll its been passed round and could you please sort of pass it fairly quickly, I'll be at the back and then I'll come down into the front again, is there anyone who's a poet? I know I enter the poem when there is one not every picture has its some of these kinds telling you about how they write a poem, if I was going to Right but erm, we'll, we'll spend start the whole questions again when we get to the next one and we do have, some of this slides which, I'll show at the very end, alright, but it means it er, erm, the first part of the talk we'll keep the lights on and then could I ask you, you know to look and then pass it around like school nobody looks back and I rush oh yeah right I'm pleased pleased to introduce to us, er, er against all these difficulties and the nearer you are at the front the better, there's all stuff here look I'm sitting at the back anybody at the back would like to move nearer then sit here yes, ok, is that alright? Well I think I'll start off by telling you a little bit about myself erm, I'm a writer and I live in Durham, my work is here and I've also work abroad, if anybody can't hear me please say No you can't hear me, right, ok, I'll try and speak up a little bit louder, erm my work, I work erm here and I work abroad and I live in Durham, er I'm a writer and erm one of the things that I'm most interested in is using art as an inspiration for my work as a, as a writer and I'd like to be able to show you by this talk, how I do that, erm, I have a few publications, my work's performed by a local group actually based in Newcastle and I'm a member of er a group called Another Story and my work's been put to music by a composer and er a play and the play and sing that, that the pieces of erm another area of my work is as I er writing workshops, the writing workshops are very different from the normal writing workshops there based at galleries and they take groups of people round an exhibition recording their comments on either one particular picture or the exhibition as a whole and then with my help we put the comments into poems that are then displayed along side the exhibits, erm this work I do with erm all sorts of people with children people with special needs, disabled people and, and that's really where my interest in art erm comes in and I find that its a great leveller for people who would like to express themselves and have perhaps have difficulty by aiding, by looking at paintings and being able to see perhaps emotions or images that they, they feel themselves, so in all areas erm I find painting in my areas of work, painting influences me and has done for as, as long as I can remember. Sometimes erm given me the questions and sometimes answering the questions for me, its always informing me and over the last few years I've erm, I said that to try and understand erm, how to use this information in my own work as, as a writer, and I see, I see parallels in all forms of art, communication is of course one, erm and the need to recognise and respond the plight of others is, is another area and the area that as a writer I'm particularly drawn too. Physically and erm emotionally writing can be very isolating and so, for example a few years ago, I was writing a huge piece on Africa about Africa and I found emotions growing that I actually didn't have names for, erm and it made it impossible to finish the piece I was working on, and then I, I went to see an Afro Asian exhibition of art and I saw portraying some of these paintings the same emotions and it, it didn't give me a name for the emotions but it, it made me feel an awful lot less isolated seeing that erm other people have also, have also felt this. So I was going to rummage through these slides and we don't have them, erm so I'll have to, I'll hand the, the, the book around in just one minute, erm the poems that I'm going to read to you, very few of them are actually complete, most of them are sketches erm ideas and images of erm, that I've got, I've, I've got them from the paintings. Sometimes when I, I write a poem I want to create a particular mood erm giving the piece erm a shape, a, a definite shape or just a shadowy shape erm and the overcoat in er Bon Jour Monsieur Gaugin, I found very, very expressive and the starting point for, for this particular poem I'll hand this round to you know, with the name of the, the front, right I don't, has anybody, if you already know this picture, does anybody actually know it already?, no I start with the overcoat obviously erm very expressive, not just because it was, people wear over , overcoats in cold days, but it was the size of the coat and the shape of it and, and it gave me a weight, I felt, er I felt a very definite mood erm about this picture because of the coat and it was a, er a ejective mood that I, that I felt from that, and the stick in the erm hands of the women over the bridge gave me the sound for, for this poem would you like me to read as the, the thing being passed around, would that be ok? Yes ok, this poem's called erm A Pause In A Moment Worn out days dressed in damp wheat, heavy coat pulling at tired shoulders, memory pushed back, brought forward in the click of a stick, pause in a moment, sunset reflected in eyes offering the warmth of recognition , so that poem started with the overcoat and that was the mood as I say, that was the mood of rejection erm and there was something about the way the old girl was looking at the women on the bridge, almost as if there was this recognition and, as it brought back memories that perhaps went or as black as the overcoat, erm the next er painting which I'm going to read to you about is erm have you its the Four Brettan Girls and does it, do any of you know, I'm sure most of you, some of you have heard that erm when I was looking at this, this picture of the, of the Brettan Girls, I erm, I was really particularly struck by the bo , the mild head of one of the dancers and the fact that she was rubbing her, her heal, erm and it gave me a voice for, for this poem, I was also drawn by the dismissal, there's a goose in the painting, there's four, four geese and one of them is dismissing the, the, the winner outright and erm I found his look very, very interesting and, and I couldn't help but compare the lies of these four dancers with those within erm from the later period as the eye that, that, that Gaugin painted later on. This, this poem's called Dancing Feet Time found hidden in a hard day, dry earth becomes a dance floor, audience of three fowl, the fourth along with a reaper turns it back, wooden shoes meant for mud, rug on dancing feet erm and, if you, if you take, were oops trying to pay particular attention to, if you can see the geese in, in this one here, there's a fate, there's a, there's a forfeit which is missing, what's going on and er, and the reason well in fact er which, which was er very much a vocal point for me in, in that painting I think its got to be better if I hold it different. It is, but then you won't be able to compare the, the details against the Well could you, we pass it round twice? Yes, yes, you could pass it round twice, that's ok with everybody Yes Erm, how shall we do that?, as its going, read it again now? Yes Ok,Time found hidden in a hard day, dry earth becomes a dance floor, audience of three fowl, the fourth along with a reaper turns it back, wooden shoes meant for mud, rug on dancing feet Erm the next one is the still life on, on with three puppies, while I was looking at Gaugin's work I couldn't help but notice he's constantly struck by the fact that he use set of three symbols through out his work it seems, and very, very often three caricatures erm or lines of three or three objects and I found this very interesting, more point of view that something that I, I wanted to incorporate in my own work, but I wanted to find a line or a phrase to use in the same way, erm, all of my work starts as one or a series of visual images and, and I then turn them into characters, repeating a word or repeating a line would be a way of erm emphasising characterise erm and the puppies that are in this painting erm, they delighted my children so much, I don't know if any of you know, do you know the painting of the three puppies its going to come round at you in a minute, so I'll talk about it until it gets to you, erm, it delighted my children this particular painting, erm and I decided to put my sort of analytical approach to one side erm and do something with that later, so this poem is from my, my children's point of view and one of the things that are very interested, they were really worried, that, erm, I think it marks the height of the table and the fact that the puppies might fall off and do themselves some harm, that, I'll read it while its going round and then I can see then, that, so this is, ok, from my children's point of view this poem, its called Threes,Table laid and waiting, milk place in bowl not to high, they lap and swirl, played and roll, paws distance from knocking and breaking goblet, made from clay . There's something else the children were convinced that the goblets weren't actually clay, the goblets that were on the erm, the table as opposed to would you like me to read that poem again?, would that be helpful?, right, we were with the, of the erm, the picture, Threes,Table laid and waiting, milk place in bowl not to high, they lap and swirl, played and roll, paws distance from knocking and breaking goblet, made from clay . The next one is erm Van Gogh's sun flowers, that's it, that one, its erm, well its Gaugin, Van Gogh's sun flowers ok, I'll talk as its going round again, if that's alright with is that alright? Erm, putting images into words is not always easy, a colour in a painting can give you a way in and the brown of Van Gogh's jacket erm affected me with this one particularly and the sun flower I felt was inappropriate misplace, in a vase to, to small, erm and it gave me an image a very strong image of suffering and this poem is in its very early stages and its literally just a list of images and I wanted to be able to show you how I start off which is with a series of images and then I have to put some filler in and open them up a bit and, and make them more accessible and understandable, but this is just a list form. Sun flower limping, water less vase, suffering eyes, desperados in caged , so from, from that painting I had a tremendous feel of something undergoing tremendous suffering and seem very desperate about the situation, and I didn't just see that in, in the picture of Van Gogh, but I could see that in the sun flower, so as, as a writer its images like that, that I would look for and open up and turn into characters or a way of portraying a particular mood, erm, the next one , were doing very well Its exhausting. I suppose this is erm, a caricature, a self portrait this little, I, in fact I was, really actually hilarious as I felt that, I, I, don't actually know an awful lot about Gaugin, but if, if I knew nothing about him at all, I would of thought he was having a bit of joke of himself with this, but er, being the person that he was I can't image that he had that quality, that, I don't believe he would be laughing at himself, erm, erm, the symbolism erm and conflict of this painting its dazzles me more than, than the colour or at least as much as the colours in it, but there's a, there's a half eaten, well it isn't half eaten, but there's half an apple at the top and, and that was the, the way into me finally, for, for writing about this, this again is a shopping list, I call it a shopping list, this is just visual images that, that will be opened out at some point and turn it into something, and my images were erm Shoulders of the matador smoking snakes, dare to bit an apple, see one half gone and still I wear a halo intact , that I'm sure I've completely wrong about him as a, a person, but as the painting that's obviously something else, erm, I found that one of the things that were he's, I, I think probably that everybody who writes is that you'll come to a point when you can't write, you stop writing, you haven't got anything you want to write about, or your frightened of writing, and I devise exercises so that , that doesn't happened to me, I think writing is like any skill you have to keep doing it to be able to do it, its, you, some of it is a game and the rest of it is hard work, and one of the exercises I, I delighted using erm a portrait of a woman erm, its about erm the er still life, its the back one, yes this one here, I have, I, I hope to use this as a writing exercise I found the, the maths in this and the colour of the piece of fruit in the background, very interesting because most of the colours to me seem a, a lot less vibrant then many of his other paintings, and so they, they attracted me and have a, a strong sense of erm, er a hidden desire in that and so it, to use it as a writing exercise which I intend doing, it will be able about a situation of character's with erm something that's hidden, some desire, I don't, the, not even spoke about to themselves or, or generally, erm I like to sort of say that came from those two little, just this amounts of colour which seemed to be saying such a lot anything I do if, erm while this is going round you have any questions, now would be, now would be a good time to ask them if you have any, there will be time at the end to talk, you can do Have you check to see if your well erm, sort of in that erm, I was asked to come and do this talk, and so I, I organise to make sure that I had access to some of Gaugin's work and then to write poems about it, erm, so, erm, only in as much as that it was a waiting to hear this talk, but a lot of my work is through commissions and so I find myself writing about things that I perhaps don't have any interest in particularly, erm, or I find actually in a waiting, asked to write about anything is quite er exciting and actually using my skill I think it should be, as a writer I should really be able to write about everything. One of the things I was asked to write about this week I think was a radio, to, to write about er what I felt about radios, you know, er, erm, so anything could be thrown at you, and obviously I have my areas that I particularly interested in and I think sometimes I get a bit complacement and I'm writing about a, I find particularly interested in and a bit lazy, so its quite good to be stretched. Erm, the next one, we'll shall go erm, go to market will do, yes that's right, no No you've got the wrong one , I was gonna say this is definitely not going to market Yes, no, she's not going to market This one, are you sure your not going to market This one, I, I, this is one of my favourites, I love this painting. The movement of this reminds me of er stage set and the figures on the bench could almost be actors and actresses and with the figure at the bottom here, the male at the bottom, well its not quite at bottom, tucked away at the side there, he, he, he looks like erm, like a harlequin figure, maybe a mischief maker, er I, I felt there was a lot of fun in this painting and a lot of erm, er gravado and, and stage specs, that kind of thing, so this poem is called for obvious reasons People Of The Nile, and I'll read it twice, probably be the best way Ancient people drawn on a vase, tell a tale, warn a friend, man dressed in red holds back a curtain, over hears and tells, they are gossiping people, playing Chinese whispers , so I, I, I quite wanted to give that er a, a contemporary updated feel, erm, I read that again for the people who may of just seen the picture at the back People Of The Nile,Ancient people drawn on a vase, tell a tale, warn a friend, man dressed in red holds back a curtain, over hears and tells, they are gossiping people, playing chinese whispers , erm, the next one , we'll have to put you on wheels I think Your this is erm, this is a bit like I went to an auction at erm Chesteny Street, and all the exhibits were brought out by hand, by, by the erm keeps watch, I'm sure this is a, this side of I in fact I've just been shown a different copy of this, Gwen has just shown me a different copy and the colour's is totally different, its a very, very poor erm print and, when I was looking at this through my book, the background was very strange and I felt that almost had been painted by a totally different artist, but having seen Gwin's, er Gwen's is much more of a go down in colour, erm so I think probably if I'd seen her, er prints I maybe I would of approached this erm differently, erm it gave me a very immense voice about crowds, erm, very, very different from the front of the picture apart from the alarm registered in the eyes of the, of the old woman erm, this is called Even Paradise Has Its End, sorry Even Paradise Has Its Price, sorry Ours in the night laying between sleep and arousal held in balance, fragile as dust on a scale, night spirit's sit easy, in no hurry, even paradise has its price , would you like me to read that one again? Yes. As I say all these poem's are very dense and erm if I get round to, to completing them they'll probably have at least another verse, certainly extra words and rhymes, that open it out and make it a bit more plausible Ours in the night , no I've got it wrong, sorry, I've moved on and I shouldn't've done That's it This is right,Ours in the night laying between sleep and arousal held in balance, fragile as dust on a scale, night spirits sit easy, in no hurry, even paradise has its price . The next one is not working, this one here erm the light framed split here erm falling on the ground is the curse of the, of the male's aunt People and animals portray in this, in the Tahiti painting, never seemed to be in a hurry, erm, even when always relaxed even when working and I wondered how much of this was cultural and erm, how much was due to the large amounts of erm drugs consumed in most paintings at this, this period but that I suppose I'll, I'll never know for sure about, erm with this painting I found in the background, er there's a figure, that's looking in on the situation and I, I for myself think's its probably Gaugin, as he portrays himself as Christ, which I think he did quite a lot to me in, in, in a few of his paintings and so this painting gave me tremendous sense of being looked in on and this figure in the background, was the person that was doing the looking in. This is called It Was Good In the afternoon when the sun half close his eyes, ants can be found not working, dogs in their cool places, vandal wall slice through heat, hold and let go of light in rays, in the afternoon when smoke curls like the back of a cat, people lean and braid hair, someone dressed like Christ looked in and said it was good . Would you like that one again ,In the afternoon when the sun half close his eyes, ants can be found not working, dogs in their cool places, vandal wall slice through heat, hold and let go of light in rays, in the afternoon when smoke curls like the back of a cat, people lean and braid hair, someone dressed like Christ looked in and said it was good now we have the dug out how food is presented erm can say so much, at least it does to me and, so that, so that the beginning of this poem became from er the food, piece of food held in the hand of the mayor in this picture. Paintings erm have the power to take you back in time, I can look at a painting and remember something that's happened yesterday or years and years ago and as a small child, looking at this painting I remembered as a small child seeing for the first time erm the sea dipping into er, sorry the sun dipping into, into the sea and being horrified I was convinced that the heat of the sun would boil the oceans and the world dry and it reminded me for an awful lot of my childhood and I'm sure if I'd seen this painting years ago it would of persuaded me otherwise, erm this is called In A Days Work Satisfaction in a days work, chosen not given, eating the laxed food, face turned to steer a sun, making cloth into a gown and giving colour to the side of a boat What is it called again? In A Days Work,Satisfaction in a days work, chosen not given, eating the laxed food, face turned to steer a sun, making cloth into a gown and giving colour to the side of a boat erm we know come to a here comes the last er picture in my, in my talk this is erm, this is going to be exhibited here on the twenty third of July, ok, erm, two, two of Gaugin's pictures, this is one of them, and several other artists er of the same period, and I think this is going to be the only venue in, in England, I don't think there coming, sort of worth seeing, but unfortunately I shall miss it cos I'm, I won't be here, erm this is a poster of I find this very difficult to erm, to relate, to relate hard work to the women portraying in, in this, we've got the postcard of that one, erm it must of been hard work and very tedious, but I think every now and then the moment breaks away and shines through at the back, and I think people like, like Gaugin erm captures those moments and then releases them on the canvass, and I hope that erm by, I hope I've been able to show you how I use art as a voice erm and a friend as my own work, even though we've maybe had to do such a sort of hand fist way, hand fisted way, erm, but, I, I've recently started to re-visit old favourite of paintings and I found that the story they tell sometimes has changed dramatically, maybe sometimes when your very little that, that, you know, sometimes dramatically as well, erm, but I, mostly, most importantly its, its still, I still find them, all of them compelling and challenging and, and something to stride for in my own work, erm, er only time will tell so I'll finish with the, the last poem which is erm comes from the postcard what's going round which is harvest, its called Patterns In The Grass,Wheat cut and falls, making lion head patterns in the grass, sickle shaped women bend and bow as a naive dressed as a dog steals the evening meal . I'll read that again Wheat cut and falls, making lion head patterns in the grass, sickle shaped women bend and bow as a naive dressed as a dog steals the evening meal . thank you very much for being so its been very difficult for everybody and I do hope you've managed to, you get something out of, out of this talk, if you have any questions I'll be very happy to, try and answer them. I'd also like to er I attend, I've got a performance tomorrow night in Durham so if any of you want to come to that it would be very nice to see you , erm, if there are any questions please feel free to ask. Have you done many No I, its not my speciality, I have tried and I, I really can't, I can't cope with the discipline of it at all, it, it er ruins the activity that I have, I know some people, one, one woman I was on the course with, it wasn't you was it Phillip?, it was somebody, was it you who worked, no somebody else that er we were doing a course with who had a tremendous skill with high and said so much into the there's some woman I admire, but I can't think what her Is seem to focus in or, or in art, and you go for art by visual means, rather than say a piece of music and subject. I don't know, do you write Erm, yes I do, both, my, my husband is a composer and a musician and erm just recently you, well I'll show you, basically that, we exchanged skills and erm I interpretations of his music erm, I, one of the things I would love to do and I'm hoping to do next year is to do something related to art using a dance and words, I think with three mix, mix well actually, mix it with its exciting, but that's one thing I really would like to work with I was asking you cos I'm always having arguments with the I, I, myself, I can see it as well Yes and I think its I was just wondering what you very much the same its, the page is so important, yeah, very important and this is what I think myself, but lots of people yes, yes that's right yes, yes but I mean it depends also I suppose erm, when your aiming for is the market, and I, I, I would like to have my work published but I also like to perform it and its got to be attractive to be looked at, in the first instance in, on a page its not known, er, there is, there is a lot of debate at the moment about using erm pages for poetry and some poets have actually starting using, writing from the wrong side and, and, and, and writing in the shape of a poem, for instance, if, what poem I was thinking off was a, was a waterfall so it was cascading the words cascading, you almost have to pick,ha ,ha , have a choice of, of words that you want to fit into a particular thing, erm I think that's had its place, but I think it can be a bit off putting as well, yeah, but it exciting, yeah definitely. Do you try any other Oh yes varied, and there interesting, with, with children, particularly if they erm if I'm doing workshops er with art and writing workshops and we come across an abstract picture, the children music, and,we , as a way into their vocabulary which isn't as large as their, their writing skills, and there'll, there'll decipher an abstract picture, wonderful language and I like doing that you know I'm thinking the abstract art Yes, yes express yes, oh yes, and erm, going back to somebody asked me earlier, erm, about how it, I feel I have to be able to write about, just about anything, erm, and so if I was given commission to write about any one thing I would have to put myself in a position to, to be able to do it. I think this idea of, of writers shutting themselves away and writing has gone, you know, very that is a luxury I think erm to be able to do it, if you want to write and earn money, which I do as well as, as socialize while I'm working erm you've got to find ways of, of, of doing that and erm just writing books and poetry just wouldn't, I, I, I couldn't survive on that, I really do have to find other ways of, of earning money which is enjoying more and also uses of my skill and erm I would think you'd need to be in contact with the situation rather than you not knowing, being able to write about that. Do you say whether you, identify the picture only on Erm, that was very er, er, I mean that, yes then they confront both of the the visual image and the written words I'm sorry what Do you identify the artist, do you Oh I see, yes, yes, I, huh, yes I would do, I, I, I would say in quite definitely that these words are inspired by such a such artist and, make it quite clear that I'm a writer and not a, I, I, I don't study art or I just don't understand science and painting and, and its my responses to that, yes. Just seems that it, it to me must be wrong, that it didn't identify them because a particular picture anyway, the reason why I find difficulty in making Absolutely, yes way for them the, this, this is just one aspect of, of my writing and I write about all sorts of things and erm, erm the shows that I do, we use two artists that's erm, I, I've written erm two, two poems about erm, er Darren and, and erm Stanley er you you've heard and erm, and I have assumed wrongly that most people will know the work of their and luckily that the, the song that we did was funny and so people enjoyed it, but they didn't understand it and they didn't have a visual image of the artist's work, so I now have to take erm a couple of pictures, er prints with me if ever were going to read it and we sing those songs but not everybody does, and then they do become excessible you know, they can see, you know, that erm, yes erm if it, if I was going to publish a book of poem I, it would have to be stated that this related to this picture and presumably it'd have to be, it would be with it, with it if anybody would be interested in doing. Does when you've finished the poem you read it out? Yes That's right, yes . That's right, yes it should, erm, these, these aren't completed, but even so the ones that we, we, I have done that too I've opened out, having performed them, you still need to have a little bit of an idea That's right of the artist yeah but as a, as a piece of work in it, yes that's right yes and I hope we, we did achieve that Yes erm because they enjoyed the, there are a few funny lines in it you know and they enjoy the, the visual amatory of these people performing it, but to themselves to actually understand it they need to know which artist it was, yeah and you know yeah, that's right yes. Do you think colours with emotions are Oh very much so, yes new devotion, size, erm, it, it in one or two of these erm they gave me a definite feel and to a, to a, it new I was trying to write I think Von Gogh was well yes absolutely yeah, and, and shapes I feel as well, you, you, particularly erm, and one of things that I did find in Gaugin's painting of Von Gogh was that erm, er, erm, depression really, I, I could see it there and the des desolation very much as if he was looking in on somebody who was in that position er, although at the time I don't thing Gaugin and, er Von Gogh himself knew it No I, I don't, I'm not an expert for poet, I, I, I feel about it, perhaps didn't Did you hope to show the slides that you've got?, I mean is Yes, would you like to see, there's about three . You need the lights off? Where's the light switch?, erm Do you not fear that if you, if there is and another, especially if your contracted with powerful paintings, that the approach you make suffer as the result of the artist's vision, or I think that we can and see each other and also my interpretation yes would be different from the reputation of, of the as I was holding on a particular images and create and then become those energy right rather than doing it direct, erm conscription of the painting right its my responses to it, that would be a very different approach, because of familiar with a, I mean with the postcard that was past around, familiar with that picture then looked at it one, I feel that about it. When your reading I closed my eyes and I got a different feeling Yes from your and I can visualise, something totally different But is that what it should be? Yes, that's what, yes that's what I hoped for because I, I feel everybody's interpretation yes is different, and you need an original yes and you maybe miss something, from this you have your own, that's right and its somebody else teaches you another angle then there's possibility for ex ,ex , expanding possibility yes which I find exciting, but, but interesting in it. You seemed to take it with your poems Yeah, I, I do and I think I went down to most people to say they can't, but when you point out something to them, they say yes I can see that, look there's this as well and I think culturally er were led to believe if you don't succeed in it, erm but in actual fact I think that you all do, but perhaps I think the books do, either assess it and give it value or, or still allow it to happen Mm, somebody I feel it did, I strongly feel it, feel that, but I'm also sure that its an awful lot easier than, than most people think , but its not going to work for us is it? Its a shame we didn't have the slides, I think we'd see more Have you got the If you'd like to hold a torch for me I can its erm, I think Sue Yes, ok I'll just, I can, I can do it winding up So this is called A Pause In A Moment Worn out days, dressed in damp weeds, petticoat cling and tired shoulders, memory pushed back, brought forward in the click of the stick, pause in a moment, sunset reflected in eyes offering the warmth or recognition Threes Table laid and waiting, milk place in bowl not to high, they lap and swirl, played and roll, paws distance from knocking and breaking goblets, made from clay . Can I just point out that something here, erm, was, I think I mentioned about my children it was the height of the table and its just so little that, that they indicate their in height in this picture, but it is there and, erm, that, I found that really very exciting and as I say the, The Threes, it, the three goblets, the three apples the three puppies, so often I've, I've found that there is three sets of, three objects and in I haven't actually got a, a poem for this, I was saying to you that I would use this, I intend using this as a writing exercise, because the, the colour of her mouth and the colour of the piece of boot in the background, just stands out to me, it says, its about to me hidden desire of some sort, either the artist's or hers or mine I don't know So, none of those pictures would be in the exhibition that you have? No. But this is our picture which This is erm, yes I don't have a, I don't have I have got a poem for this, which we were, its been to Pam now that would be interesting Thank you very much you fascinate, battling against others. Thank you very much. Evening. . What can we do for you tonight? I'm up to get my ears syringed. Your ears? I went er for a hearing test er last week and they tell me that my left ear's a bit full up. Sit yourself down. The right one they say but the left one is Too much. So they said I had to come in and get it syringed. Mm. We'll give it a nice gentle run through. There we have it.

Next Friday morning. Okay? Rightio. Thank you. Right. Cheerio now. Cheerio. Your wedding is the happiest day of your life no? Well, what is it then? Getting married is something that most Scottish women do at least once in their lives, and most Scottish men, which means that most of us have planned a wedding and that's what we're talking about tonight, weddings. Where you have them, who comes, what you wear, what you do, what it costs, and what you think about it later. Now, if like me you've yet to attempt this big production number you could pick up a few tips here, after all, we've a number of professionals in this hundred, hoteliers, dressmakers, cake makers, photographers, and video makers, registrars, ministers, but above all, we have a lot ex-brides here, and let's start off by finding how many we have. Have you been a bride? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And, in this hundred we have sixty nine er ex-brides thirty one still to make the leap. Now wo er erm, I can't ask you whether it was the happiest day of your life because only sixty nine of you would know. We well was it? It's the only day, really in a women's life where everybody at her and she's made to feel like the most special person on this earth, so I'd highly recommend it. Was that your experience? Yes it was, yeah. You're the only person there wearing the ball gown, you're the only person there getting their photograph taken a hundred times over so you're made to feel the most special person on the earth and I think that makes it worth it for a lot of them. Did you like it so much you you'd you'd you'd do you would do it again? Possibly not, no ! But it worked? I mean, for you that big day, cos I mean it is, it's a, it's a nerve wracking occasion isn't it? Yeah, it's it's it's the build up to it as well, there's a lot of excitement, I mean, most people it takes about six months to build up to the big day, and then finally it's there and it all happens and, I think that makes it a lot , exciting for a lot of women. Now, was that the the experience of the, of the other sixty eight of you ex-wives? Yes? I think a lot of people get carried away with the occasion and it's actually supposed to be a very romantic day, and, you know, that's what it was for me. So it was everything you hoped it would be? Yes. But I think people do get carried away with traditions and the occasion and this grand affair and really, it could be a very small low-key affair, but it's, it's meant to be a very romantic special day for two people. Yes? Behind you. I I think erm i it seems very sad if we can single out one day to be the most important in our lives. Mm. And it's a very special thing if you're going to join forces with another person, and good luck to you, but I think erm it seems that, there maybe down forever after that , if it's the most important day! Er, have you been a bride? Yes I have. I've actually been a bride twice actually ! Aha. Erm and, and very enjoyable days they were, but erm I think if I were to plan a big party, or an anniversary or something like that, and I'd hope those would be jolly enjoyable days too. Mhm. Yes? I would like to get married all over again, to to the same person I might add, but so that I could actually enjoy it more this time because it's in , so much of a blur when you get married the first time that you're caught up with it and you don't really see what happens, I would like to get married all over again. What did you do? Well I was actually married in England because I'm E , I'm English, but one of guys, erm, for instance, he wore a kilt and he showed all the English what he wore under the kilt and I missed it! That, so I don't know what a man wears under his kilt ! I, oh I can't believe that ! Well, I haven't been married but I have, did recently graduate, and that was a very important day for me Yeah. and, personally, I'd much rather have er, people looking at me for what I achieved er, rather than just looking pretty on a day, I think that's more important to me. Sian you're a florist Yes. now, er supposing weddings disappeared would that affect your business? Weddings are a very important part, and a part that er, we all enjoy but erm we, I wouldn't say it was the major part of a florist's business, there's quite a few other aspects. As a florist you're dealing with most important days in peoples' lives, very often new babies, weddings, funerals, erm but no, I wouldn't say if weddings disappeared we'd all be you know, in a terrible mess as a professionals, but it's a very important part and an enjoyable part. Fiona, what about you? It's the same for us really, it's not the main part of the business Well you better say what your business is. in cake decorating and associated things, people have cakes for all occasions and erm wedding cake's only one of them. But erm again, it's it's good fun, kind of a good laugh with the wedding cake, at least with a wedding cake you're spending money and you're getting fed and everybody's getting a bit of it! And do you do a er,do as far as the cake goes, I mean er, is there a variety in er in the option? Oh certainly! Yes, yes. I mean you we, we have made, you know, black wedding cakes for people that feel, something like that, we've even made divorce cakes, so you don't have to get married to have one! What, what, what, what's a divorce cake look like? Mm. We had a bo , a broken heart A broken heart, aha. with sort of a trail of red blood coming out the middle! Oh! Roberta if weddings disappeared a large part of your business wou would go wouldn't it? Again, I think, like the rest erm Mhm. we evolved from the general fashion side, which is still as important to us, but the reason that we did probably evolve in in the the wedding side is because of th the need for us, it wasn't us who pushed it from our end, more and more brides came to us, so therefore we grew. Mm. Sort of My wedding wasn't an ordinary wedding, I was married on top of Arthur's Seat and erm You were married on top of Arthur's Seat Yes, at sunrise on Christmas Eve four years ago and, it was important for us to do exactly what we wanted because erm it was a second wedding for both of us and it was also erm we wanted to have something that represented sort of the aspirations of love and so, sunrise erm, and on the top of a hill did that for us. And, if you can find a minister that's willing to go wherever you want to go! In Scotland you can, can do almost anything. Aren't you a minister yourself? Yes. So have you, have you performed any un unconventional weddings? Yes, erm well I I've not done a wedding in a church actually yet, but then I've only done three weddings, and, but the most interesting one was in a Brock in Glenelg and erm, that was quite exciting because the couple really thought about the service and they had selected that sight because it meant something to them, and involved the whole community and thereabout, and it was great! Mm. Do you mind if I ask you about, about your own wedding o on the top of Arthur's Seat on Christmas Eve four Mhm. well Christmas eve was it? Yes, Christmas eve, well Did you have many guests at sunrise? Well we, we had about sixty erm, people that trudged up to the top of the hill including erm, one who didn't know there was a wedding, he was a runner, and then he and he had tagged the top of Arthur's Seat and was astonished to see a crowd there. What do you wear to a mountain top wedding in the middle of winter? Well you wear an anorak and a woollen skirt and walking shoes. Is that the most unusual wedding we have in this hundred tonight? I mean, has e ,ye yes, yes it seems so, yes! No ones, no ones gonna do anything crazier than that! You touched on church weddings, now lots and lots of people do get married in church, although many of them aren't er aren't necessarily church-goers, now Chrissie, can I, can I pick on you? You perfo yo as a Church of Scotland minister Aha. you perform weddings? Yup! If people aren't church-goers do you, will you still give them a church wedding? Yes. Why? Cos not all ministers will will they? Well I think it gives them a link with the church, erm and they don't just come in and say oh yes, turn up on Saturday and you'll get married, there's some meeting before that Mhm. so that we don't all meet as strangers on the day. We found that a lot of young couples that because you don't go to church on a regular basis but erm, to go along with their parents' wishes too, rather than going through a big church wedding in a church, they go to a hotel and they have the erm, wedding ceremony and the reception all in the hotel, and are married by a minister. And that So there had to be Yes. A minister will go out to a ho hotel. Yeah. Have you done that Chrissie? Have you ever Yeah I have. Erm, I don't like it er, not for particularly any religious reason but for the fact that the church is purpose-built for weddings and a lot of hotels aren't, so you get the girl with the ball gown, spent hundreds on it, and she's squeezed up sometimes and nobody can see her! But erm I prefer to marry in the church. Angela? We were married at home, and one of the reasons why is because we bought a very old house about three years ago and on the top floor it has a, a large room which used to be the ballroom, and we did a little research and we found that the last wedding that we know of in the house took place in seventeen fifty eight, when apparently it was very common in Scotland to get married at home, it was more uncommon to go to church. Mm. We did some more research and we found out that in return for doing this you had to pay the minister a fine, so we found a minister who was very excited by the idea of marrying us in a seventeen century house, and in fact, on the morning of the wedding he was more worried about what he was wearing than what I was! And erm, it wa , at the reception afterwards we actually paid him the fine er, a contribution to a a, a fund his church had for a painting they wanted to buy. They pay the minister a fine? Yes. But it's not convention of course, to pay the minister anything is it? I mean, Church of Scotland Ministers don't get paid. No. Er, it's different in other churches I think. Some, I think some people sometimes give a gift,I've never, I don't think I've had a gift ! Mhm. I'd been, a few weeks ago I'd been to a wedding, and it was the most boring ceremony I ever been in all my life! I get married about eleven years ago, it was four of us, me and my, the groom and two witnesses. It was a special day but every day of my life it's a special so it's nothing, I would not do it again, you know, just to but er, I think most of the time the wedding in here is much more geared for how the bride look like and photographer, it is all the time for four hours, how you stand, it's nothing normal,noth nothing natural, nothing Mhm. nothing happy, you ju just to stand there, you can't laugh properly and you can't do this, and you can't do this, it's worse So you think people are forced into conventional modes because they fe It was awful! How often do we, we really feel that the bride and groom are the people who make the choice? Mm. Is it not the parents Mm. who are inclined to impose their choice on the bride and groom in a lot of cases? Is, was that your experience? Not me personally but I have known a few people who've wanted perhaps, a very quiet wedding, just in a registry office, and finished up with a large church wedding. Mm. You talk about Brides' magazines, or any of the other magazines that are there, it's all set out, it's all hyped up and, I think a lot of people feel they ha , really have to get married in that way. Hannah? I was just going to say that being a photographer, we find that more and more people come with their mothers instead of the fiance whenever they're going to get married, and it is all the time, the mother has a big say in it you know, instead of the couple. Well now, there must be some mothers here who er Any mothers who've married off their daughters in this dictatorial way, saying you must have this dress! You must allow No. to spend seven thousand pounds on you! Yes? Expectations just went too far! For instance, I mean er my boyfriend,excuse me, I've been er living with him for are quite a number of ministers which who need their own cars a and a a at the church that pays the er, insurance, the road license and even something for the maintenance. Now, clearly if you were paid say six hundred pounds for that and you only did twelve hundred miles, you're getting fifty P a mile anyway! And they've got, I think the odds are that people are giving more perhaps er and that er, if they were paid at fifty four P per mile and and got how that would affect the churches er contributions they make? And therefore, er our proposal is that we should adopt the figures at the bottom of the page which are actually those which the the er er, Inland Revenue have recognised in ones where you don't have to er, put in a tax return for.. for . So resolution three isbefore you for discussion . Peter? I know I'm a ! Reading for our , I mean er, I supply my own car, my church has recognised that whether I'm probably if I pay the tax and the insurance erm and I just thirty two, thirty five that's but when I'm in business or I'm in provinces and I'm allowed to pay what, ten fifteen Fifteen. pence a mile? Fifteen. And I do not or be subsidised, you know a a I mean I think that's consistency. Well I I shall leave you to go through the questions for a few minutes. from from , erm I'm rather concerned about what the er, provence here is intending to do! Erm, I've worked for ten and a half years within this county of Clwyd as a social worker, regarded as an extensional and every year my employers er, who are based in London would like the county to know what were the remec recommended mileage rates for the reimbursel to a business car mileage? Now, if Clwyd or Gwynedd or any other county for that matter, within Wales or in England er, decided that in themselves that they would not implement the national recommendation er, then there duly would be all hell to pay, and rightly so! And certainly now that of course, ministers don't have a union unfortunately! Er No. they would allow me half now erm I've been looking at one particular church, one denomination er, which is the Methodist Church, although it has been said already here this afternoon, or this morning rather there are an overall erm joint style with Methodist and with United Reform Church and erm I have personally the Methodist of last year, last September where it gives and also erm, mileage recommendations. I'll be viewing the Methodist Church in quite a different way, but I think it's very important for us to be made aware of how they do it erm for example, if you have erm a a or or and I don't think any church has, are provided within that and gets alike. In addition to that you get depreciation of one thousand one hundred and forty four pound per year which, by my reckoning is ninety five pound a month in addition to that, as a Methodist Minister you get a standing charge of five hundred and twenty eight pound per year which is forty four pound pe er, per month and then you also through i in the year if you have a major repair needed on your car you get a hundred and eight pound now, if in fact, I had , I have a Vauxhall Nova, and let me take these figures as you are at twenty four P a mile, or twenty four point five P a mile and if that's all we are recommended, recommending, in other words, there's no lump sum at all er, that would mean that I would be getting forty nine pound but Methodist , this colleague in Llandudno if he did Perhaps I shouldn't do this yet cos we haven't agreed it! But we have a new secretary. Er, if you agree it an and report. And I'm gonna ask Catherine to stand up so that you can all see who she is. We're involved in bringing things together, we're involved lots of things and At the back in black. there are lots of things At the back in black. committee, if you go downstairs you will see on the notice there a display of various things that we do, and on the windowsills there are various pieces of information free sheets that you can pick up and take away it will tell you about all sorts of issues! The way in which society imposes an agenda on us asks us questions in the churches. I think we're not too bad in doing that. But what we need to do as well, is to listen wha to what the churches are saying as they address these issues. And I want to erm ask you please if you have any comments about the work of The Old Church and Society Committee, the work we do fo fo for Synod and in the provence please make those comments known to Catherine or to your district representative! We need to hear from the local churches, from the district councils what's going on wha what the issues that concern you are so let's as well the ones that you see downstairs, we may already be addressing so have a look down there have a look at the, the information but if there are any issues you feel we ought to be addressing then please let us know so that we can put them on our agenda. That's all I want to say except to er, who, that Synod received the report of the Church and Society committee? I'm assuming you've read that report? Have you received it? Yeah. Yes. Does anybody wish to make any comments or ask any questions about this particular section? Don't think that's a lack of interest, I think it's matter of discipline! Oh Good! Okay then.. Thank you Peter and thank you Catherine erm we will give the view in due course. We move to the DP committee report which is on page seventeen. I'm gonna go very speedily and ask that we receive this report for debate. Good! Yes. Any comments on any section that is not pertaining to the resolution that was on page nineteen? Erm one from Mike Mike? and is that , I always feel threatened or paranoid I just want to make a point on on paragraph seven the rule in which to review the is that my understanding that review will be about the role and of the rule in which the . We will note that in a minute. Right. Er I just wanna refer to item one which is to do with the Synod . That's actually a different resolution. Is it? So we come back to that. Well Do you wannit Ah! ah! Right I would say Sorry! Sorry! Any other comments about any other questions not pertaining to the resolution there? We therefore come to resolution two in which to make it to paragraph one You're so gracious John! So it's just simply to er comment about the the future work that's gonna be done by Glanmole er, the work of investigation as I understand it at the end of that first section. Really, two things brought up investigation to consider the first is with trusts the very important piece of work that's done by trusts on behalf of the provence another provence may or may not know that there are the trusts have now been er, between trusts erm South Wales trusts erm Monmouthshire North Wales trust and Monmouthshire have now all been amalgamated into one and we're working through the implications of that. And we have had the trust secretary who has been working on our behalf voluntarily for some time now. I don't think anybody appreciates just how much, and I would like to put it on record, how much George does on behalf of the provence a very considerable piece of work! If you were part of the trust meetings and saw the degree of work that he does do regularly on our behalf it is quite considerable he doesn't do it for nothing! I can't imagine that George is gonna continuing doing that forever and it may well be that we'll be faced with a possibility of, of what we do in the future to have that piece of administration done will we be able to assume that it could done voluntary in the future? Or will it be part of the administrative task of the church? So I'd, I'd like that to be er considered er, when this whole investigation is carried on. And the second point too, is to say is to ask, at least to consider, whether then in some centres the work of the Synod ought to be trimmed down to match the particular work that is being done. I mean tha , is it all, you know, do we need all the time to have erm extra administrative help and in in, and in terms of which we've been talking about before, I know they might sound like two conflicting issues but one of the ways of ensuring we get the work done is do we trying too much at the Synod? Should we be thrusting more work down to districts and th , and they'll to do the job rather than always assume it should be done at this level? I think, I'm not going to encourage debate on that I think we've heard what Kenneth said particularly about the trusts the working done by the trust and would suggest that we ask Granville to take that on board as well and be within the presentations too. And I think some would be the less about the too much work perhaps being done by Synod and not enough by districts. I think it is something that we should encourage churches to talk about, the districts to talk about speaking of the district secretary I ! But there we are I I think we'll just take that on board like that. Erm, resolution that Synod appoints Jo , John as Synod clerk for a period of up to three years to commence at a date mutually convenient to him and the present Synod clerk. Those in favour of that resolution? Any against? Right,. I think erm we are not going to say thank you to Eileen now because she is not finishing as Synod clerk and that's a conscious decision. It may be that er, Eileen will be Synod clerk this time next year as well we don't know. Synod will divulge a degree of flex no, quite seriously, a degree of flexibility and we're grateful both to Eileen and er, to John for allowing that degree of flexibility to take place. And Synod will of course will be informed er, when, when Synod clerk has changed. But we're grateful to Eileen for what she is doing and will continue to do and we're grateful to John for what he intends to do erm for three years at any stage wha at any stage in which they choose. thank you. Then resolution three that Synod appoints the Reverend David , Henry and Nanette as the rep , as representatives on the Mission Council and this pertaining to paragraph two. Firstly, I think I should say that straight away one hopes that these three erm, and that's regrettable! But the background is that of fifty letters were sent out to a variety of people er, lay and ordained whatever that means! Erm asking for permission to put their names forward and from the, the few letters we had the, this was that we thought was the whitest knights in terms of Geography in terms of sex in terms of I wouldn't say intelligence, perhaps I should try to impress them! Erm are there any comments or questions ? Those, those supporting that please show? Against? Erm now this present report is no longer necessary erm because paragraph three is now no longer accurate erm, because a change that took place in the General Assembly Executive Committee last the week before last. My feeling is that it wouldn't have when there's a been a change perhaps there could be no from the the secretary and as semi-executive now does not apply to this I would suggest that somebody, unconstitutionally, intervenes the Synod advocate and ignore this resolution and continue with the second Saturday of March and the second Saturday in April. Can you agree? Yo Yes. Agreed. Yes,. Does Synod accept the nominations in section ten? These nominations are do , clearly written. Yes, if we could make a comment please the thing about in July? Yes. Could it be looked at? Well it's erm and the see if you could another appointment erm for when he has got . That's okay. Those in agreement with resolution five please show? And when we come to resolution six er, there is only one district council which has a made a nomination for the erm moderator for general assembly for ninety three, ninety four? And that was Mid-Wales district council. You will all find yellow sheets of paper if wondering why we're reading about the . Mid-Wales district council erm I think unanimously wish to put this nomination of reverence in the past erm and the nomination for moderator of general assembly from ninety three to ninety four. They have read it was proposed and seconded by the Reverends erm Mike and Gethwyn and if there any questions I am sure that they are to answer questions rather than ask them to speak to us. , thank you. There was quite a lot of discussion in the Mid-Wales District Council about this nomination erm it wasn't , that reminds me yes it was all members votes voted in favour of it. Erm so it had been thought about quite seriously. Is Synod willing to take this for the general assembly as a nomination for erm if she agrees to nomination for moderator general assembly. Yeah. Could I, could I just ask what particular element she has for Wales to nominate, why why, why was Wales nominated ? Any, you know particular reason for that, having got David here ah I I I've decided to go through actually. But how? But I I of course felt the of giving me something that he would be known by everybody in Wales. Er a and therefore, I would of thought that was a everyone but I'm just wondering why it is that now what of Wales? Are there any other questions to refer to district council? No. Can you answer? Well I felt one of two ways, firstly when we're looking for a moderator of the URC we're looking for a moderator for the whole church. And secondly, in terms of Liz Liz is someone I know extremely well and have worked with in various functions and committees over the past. We have someone always there for those who have er, society those who are poor er, women er, many of the issues that we feel very strongly and here, here She had no sort of cultural historic resonance with the nation of Wales but I'm sure her and the way she approaches her whole ministry would mean that she'd have a lot of than those of us here in the URC in Wales. The resolution is, comes before you from Mid-Wales district council, those in favour of sending er, Elizabeth's nomination forward, if she agrees to that please show? Those against? That is carried. We've come, I think to the end of our business, which is good! You will have tea at half past four which is which is er splendid! There are a couple of things I would like to say one is that you will find people have asked regards the paper which David mentioned in Northern Ireland that has been distributed it was pinned to another sheet of paper erm, headed The Last Attempt and there are more copies available it's simply to know where to find that . We must have three minutes of relaxation before beginning Synod. Before beginning . Thank you for before yo , before you start the please please we haven't quite finished! Before we actually have that three minute break erm, I think we should formally thank the Church of England of Holywell for its hospitality laid down . Ooh! Ooh! Erm Would like a cup of this er Mm. Sorry, now that's ? No, no I didn't! . I knew these pews were hard! Ooh, I didn't realise they were that bad! I feel sorry for my poor congregation! Hello! There's a cup of tea there. Ooh how kind! Thank you You very much. you're standing in the door. Thank you What have we got here? Thank you . Well it's the Hello Arthur! Erm Owen was told we'd got to . John! He's upstairs. Is he? Oh! Oh sorry! Day before it. Shall we settle down! Shall we settle down! you have to say. Who? Steven. And could you please put your hand up if you haven't got Oh I say! an order of service. Yeah and they've been given out? Erm. And we begin our worship and begin our worship with a period of silence. So even if you're standing could you stand quietly! Can we keep quiet please! We all stand. You are the comfort.

There is quite a lot on at the moment cos I've got a church meeting this evening at Flint about er ministry Mhm mhm. and an elders meeting at er Kevenmour tomorrow Mm. about ministry ! Mm. Oh! Have either of them got erm anyone in view? Erm well Kevinmour well no, the Wrexham group have got have, had a minister came last week and this week Mhm. with a view. Oh yeah. Aha. But whether they're going to you know get him talk about or not I don't know. How many are there in the group? Four. Oh yeah. One is very very weak! It was er I think I'll try a bit of your cake if I may? Yes i take it at your peril I'm afraid! Well if I get home safely I'll be alright! But the other thr three are a reasonable size are they? Erm well Salisbury Park's got sixty odd members erm Kevenmour twenty odd Wre er so Johnstown ooh a dozen or fifteen something like that and there's a se , and the fourth one,Bareala he's down to next to nothing! So er In fact, we're wondering whether it's going to be possible to keep it up but the trouble is it's in an area where in the last ooh, over over recent years forty chapels have closed! Really! And we sort of, don't want that to be the forty first ! No! No! Gosh! It's and it's quite near the Brumrose steelworks which means of course there's a lot of unemployment there!closed. Mm. There, are there, is this a a rural area on the whole or that so many have closed, chapels? Er well it there's you see we've got Wrexham is a good sized town! Mhm mm. Erm and from Wrexham down to Cherk is sort of almost an urban development. Mhm. That, as soon as you get a a bit to the west country. Oh! And that's the area where the chapels have closed? Well no, you see erm across where actually Songs of Praise is coming from this evening Mm! is a is a place where ooh there, there used to be any number of Welsh chapels Mm. that I er, now well there's hardly any now! Really? Yeah. Excuse me a sec I just want to I was just letting the water er, the radiator was a little bit Oh by all means. low and I just want to make sure that it's erm Yes I know her.

You might have a meal on the, the Thursday but er Yes , I'll let you have it. John said you were there. interrupt my speech, I can't come next Sunday I've got to go to Wrexham. But you'll be here next, oh! Yes, I Yeah, will you be here or or er at a , Sally Yes, yes yes! if er Excuse me! . I've got . Cos I'm gonna ask her to erm speak about the . I think it might be . Herbert's in the way! Yes, alright I'll move now! I've got her address, whether I've got her phone number? I don't know whether I've got her phone number. I'll I'll I'll see if I've got it then. Yes. Yes. Well I don't know whether you can get out yet. I think I've, I Herbert's blocking I everybody in! I had to park at The Three Pigeons I couldn't get in! Oh ! If you remember the . Yes, yes, and I . Oh you won't need sixteen megabytes even if you decide to improve the let's unpack that thing and then we'll see how much space we're talking about how much of that's padding and how of that is real thing,. I was taught that when I worked in the grocery warehouse. If you open a box with a penknife always do that. So that you have to So get it to go all the way. Cut the end that's for . Do the contents the world of good! Mm. Oh! What's happened to this . Yeah. Yep!get it out. Whatever! Right we're on to this roll now . Oh! Right! Right! Can you pull that off? That one. Right! Before I realised I've got mine. Okay ! It is slightly bigger than the other one isn't it? Quite a lot bigger actually. Mm. Oh dear! Yes, it's got more back to it. Oh the screen mm, about the same size. It's a little bit bigger I think you'll find if you put the tape measure on it you'll find it's a little bit bigger. Right. Right. Presumably this is the power supply for it? Yeah. Woops! The main colour monitor operating instructions in here. How many spare points you got? Erm one at the moment, but I can pull out the radio without any problem. Oh fine. It's a No, one of these spools Full wear If I can crawl under here I Yes, I just wanna have a look at yes you can crawl under there to your hearts content! You can unplug that for the moment. I'm not really worried about it. No, I just, thinking it's easier if I take it down this way. Oh alright. Then I pull it . Now,. Ultimately er they might change the lead on the end of that monitor. What's the matter? I was wondering where the socket is. Oh I see where it's gone! Right! I should have . Oh there's plenty of wire. Oh yes. Right. Now if I'd have been sensible Yes. which I really am I'd have brought over my Oh! what's his name? My monitor. Why? Well if I'd swapped monitors with you can pro and I don't suppose you'll wanna get rid of your Amstrad today No. and you'll probably want to keep it for a little while? Yes. Oh hang on, moving leads and things don't stand up! Not just yet anyway. Right. Erm I could of taken the black and white one Mm. and then I could have shown mine to this lady, cos I mean the only difference is is the black and white isn't it? Er, yes. Er I'll have another lead for you in just a sec I'm afraid. Hang on a mo just screw this in. Right straight under there there is actually a power outpoint on this so if we can get the right kind of plug Yes. we could actually drive the monitor off the box and you'd only need one socket. Well it doesn't really matter because I got and unused socket here. Yeah but I mean if you i in some ways it's easier cos then when you turn it off, you turn everything off. You see what I mean? Yes. Er erm there's a white plug have a seen a mucky grey, a white plug? I'll lower it down here. I've got, yes. Got it? Yes. Fine. It's here. Right, it's in! That's in? We need the keyboard now. I got a er find out where that plugs in. At the back somewhere usually. Then we can turn it on and see if it all works. Can you hold that for a mo ? While Yes. I hold the lead. Yes. There's a Oh ! That's got the vacuum on the top. Ah! Anything down that hole? Have you found it? Aha. Oh Just seeing it's twelve I didn't realise that went in there. No, and somewhere or other I have got for you a copy of the long string the long you know? The erm the long trip card to work gently. Oh I see! Right there you go! Have you got a ruler? Yes. Yes, that's fine. Yes, you see that screen's twelve inches and that's screen's over over an inch bigger, nearly fourteen. Mm. Do you want to turn it on? Is that the on button? Aha. It's, just rock it. Don't push it properly. Oh good, it's the go , it's the good DOS! Yeah. It's a good do , that's a very good erm files Oh! put out. Mm. Oh that's interesting! Let's have a look. Has it got a DOS directory? Two DOS directories! Old Do , DOS and old DOS. I got version five. Well that's the latest isn't it? Yeah, except I haven't got all the things. Well if it's on this hard disc could we copy it over? We could , we could we could keep it. An E Cos it's I R C and that's that's like oh no, we can have it, it's all set up this will save us a ag , ages of time! Good! DOS. Goodness, a lot of files on there! It would of been better If you'd done a P. No, sub-directory slash P Oh marvellous! I think we'll call it that. .Let's ring . Erm how do we get it to load high that's what I want to know?. Mm. just erm erm I haven't got his work number on the memory so I'll Right. have to look it up. Er I should know it but No handbook, but I suppose we can buy some DOS five handbooks? Well I was thinking that. It would be worth copying all that off. Yes. Before we lose any of it! Er perhaps it's not ! I know, work . I wonder if we'll get him? Ah, well if not we'll try the car. No. Oh right. . this one goes straight through to his office doesn't it? Ya. Good morning! How are you? Ooh fine thanks! We just want a bit of information about setting up a computer. Da , er David'll talk to you. Hiya Rob! Erm these things have come with DOS five on them er but no books or anything! But never mind. Erm in the ah or to accept dot that, no,config si , how do you get it to load high? Have you got a pencil and paper ? Er Oh right. I'll get you some . I mean you got, I mean I've got the rest config sys sorted out. Will do. Aha. Yes. I mean, I've put files equals twenty yeah but I'm DOS equals high with a H I G H, yes. Right! That's all I really needed to know. I don't need much else. Apart from busy sitting there thinking erm yeah, well I usually leave command dot com in the root directory. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It should give yeah, I just need country yeah. Do , does it help if DOS is high is near the beginning? Oh well it doesn't matter. Fine, that's alright. I'll just add it to the end, that's all I was thinking. Sometimes the they make a fuss if you put them in the wrong place. No not at the moment. Yeah. Yeah, ultimately they might wanna end up with erm a mouse driver high but it's alright. Yes, I mean it does it for you doesn't it? Basically. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. I used to always load anti sys but I, then I found out there's nothing I ever I really needed it, so I took it out! But I suppose you've got more complicated setups than me? What? Yeah. Mm. Okay, thanks very much Rob! Bye Yes, right. Now let's find out something! Just check that that boots properly. Control alt it's deleted segment but we don't really need that. We'll let it just setup isn't really that e erm you can do fancy things! Er that's a I think what we'll do is we'll get used to it. Mm. So I'll just put that there. Would you be turning that round there ? I can do that sometimes but I don't Erm no, soon as you get an ordinary chip dot bat file Mm. erm it will it reads the clock automatically. We'll just have to set it once but it hasn't done it. It's no good setting now because if there's no alt dot bat I it won't keep it? Yeah. Mm mm. Oh! Right. Er, I need a copy of Xtree Er I want to have a look at the Erm, my is I'm always carrying it. Here it is. I'm always sorting out people's computers for them. Ah? I said I always carry Xtree, I'm always sorting out people's computers for them. I see! A chair would help wouldn't it? Yes, why not have one? Er would you prefer the chair or the stool? Have what you like. It doesn't matter one can have one. Ah, interesting! Aha! I wonder what's in old DOS? Read me now! View. Oh I understand! That's fine, you can delete that. Aha! That's fine. Now then er I wanna get back onto your computer. Right. Cos I want to that you need to put somewhere safe that's the disc driver for the card. Oh! This is a So that's backup is it? Yeah write protected if you wouldn't mind? Oh. Before you get anywhere else done. Erm Right. Mhm. Right. Where did I, where did I put that piece of paper I had? Here you are. DOS equals high that's high. Drive five, one one that's There we are ! Right! Ooh! Take the Xtree out there what's that's ? Oh that's funny! What's that? It goes the other way. That'll take a bit of getting used to that!. How do you mean, it goes the other way? You turn it it's on the other side. Feels funny! Oh it's done! Do anything different, you still turn it the same way to lock it down it's just Oh it's just the shape of the thing? Just feels different! You can get used Mm. to it quick enough. Er and that one and that one how's that one ? Er control copy all eight files as they are to the and that should do it!say on there. Actually Doesn't take long does it? No. Right! Let's have a look, look see. There are! That's assist what's this? Six. How do you get in this one? In there, oh you don't! Yeah, this is a windows thing. You don't need it. Lovely! Oh that Here? Win eight twenty is? Yeah, so if you'd have been running windows on it. I'll check it. Files read only. Oh well it doesn't matter. Oh! I wouldn't worry. Okay. Oh, by the way you'll only have one det well it you've got the whole lot on this thing. Right. You mean I don't need a C and a D? No. It runs the whole the lot! Oh! Don't matter. Well that's more what I'm used to. Xtree's more pretty in this isn't it? Where's the directory? There's er what's sub-directory known as? Handle?and then sub-directory in D-base! I think the sub dire , we don't want the Gem. No. Cos I haven't sorted them out yet! Mm. Er I'm gonna sit down quietly and do it one day erm it's and make a sub-directory. That's for storing. Can you scroll that down a bit? Oh! Hang on! Further? No, just as bit more, yeah. Leave your sub- directory as utils. Yeah, and I want to make the sub-directories so that can . Make a sub- directory as . Make as sub-directory as WP papers. It's gonna take as long as I thought cos I have to format it and install it. Make a sub-directory as Wordperfect fifty one. Actually that is that a sub-directory or a main one? It's a sub-directory of the root directory it's alright. I see! And that's it! And you've got a sub-directory which says DOCS. Yes, what? Have you ever used that? I don't think I have used it. Well you can always make no I don't need to make the rest because erm oh yes graphics! Make a sub- directory as graphics. Macros? Do I need one for that? Oh yeah! You have macros don't you? Yes. Just wanna call them the same things as you're used to. Printers no print , yes printer will be the same won't it? Speller. You call yours speller. It's now Yes. on. Right! Yes, that's the end by the look of it. Pardon me! Oh well ! Right! Let's take that out. No, that one was brown that was. No, and that one was brown. I tend to keep them in the originals cos then I if I need to . Mm. Now let's boot it and see what happens. No is it switched on . Take that out otherwise it'll boot all the disc drive. Okay. Should be alright. Good! Er Right can I have your erm all your bible ones? There's some . We've had those! They're all Ah! over there I think. Yes, here they are. Oh don't really need this! Never mind! Is this the order you put them up in? Yes. Oh, so you'd like those in order, put back in there?. The only thing is, I did wonder whether the two What? there's two files at the end which I thought maybe ought to be at the beginning. Where are they? In there. Er They're all in one big directory, DOS These two doesn't care! You see those two are right at the end, and those I don't know whether those ought to be together before XX. Well it, they're So all in one directory. It doesn't matter? It doesn't care! I see! It's called Bible isn't it? Yes. Copy mm perhaps it doesn't like Oh, that's the only thing! You're gonna get used to that. The se there's no second star. In that er, Bible. Oh! That's cos I made a mistake!if I did I forget to do a word there? No. Star Oh! So that's drive B is it? Yeah. Star . I haven't bothered to make a label. No, I don't blame you. Take them long enough wouldn't it? Alright? Mm. Right! I will get used this drive sooner or later! Boring this innit? Yes. Still it has go , got to be done. Well you could leave those couldn't you? No, it's alright! I like to check that it all works you know? Get a few things on it and check that it works . It won't take long. Right you are! How many discs did you say this was? Twenty one of them. Mm. Er this one, yes I think we'll put that . Yeah, no I'm putting them that way on top of each other. That's right! Hopefully another coffee? I've just put the kettle on. Oh! I thought you might be ready for one. Actually they spend more time changing discs probably than the Than the actual copying, yes. Well you can't help it when you copy Well look at the speed it takes a disc onto the hard disc! Watch! Now is that a file? That's a whole file! Oh yes, it takes long , spends longer reading than it is ! Oh yeah! Much longer! Yeah. Well it's longer, it's about ten times as long! Ha! Oh because that's the er That's a slow floppy innit? Mm. Floppies are, that is terrible! I'm up to book fourteen . You what? I'm up to book fifteen! Oh! Oh I'm more than half way through! Only nine left. Good! Suppose I could of put this out there ? What are doing? It should be going down. Fortunately this'll be the biggest job of all! I suppose actually loading Wordperfect will be the slowest job of all. Always takes a bit longer doesn't it? Mm. It's er there's not so many discs to load though. No? There's not so many discs. No, but er I can't just do this with it! No. Where are you going? Just wanna look at those. .I mean Autoroute's only about three files. Only got Yeah. three discs so that won't take very long. D-base is what? Five at the moment. You know it says book forty, do you have to know which books you want to go into? Yes erm er, it's on a file somewhere. Oh! No, is it? It's not the easiest thing to No, that's one of the reasons why I've made little use of it. Erm Never mind! I could probably re-name them? To make it easier to remember, except it maybe it refers to it, maybe it uses book something to refer to them. You might have to write the whole programme again to do that. Oh well, maybe I'd better not try then! There's some coffee here. Sorry, I've nearly finished this. I'd like to get it done before I Yes for the, you know printing the leaflet How much notice do you require? How quickly do they do it? The same day. Ah. Only, I could take it to work, you know, Mm. Er now then bring it on Friday and show it to G to Granville. I'll I'll get another copy. I'll leave that with Kenneth for now Mm. and I'll bring one on Friday with me. I did ask, I did mention it to Granville on Saturday. Aha. Because, you know, he said what it was gonna cost him in the future. So if we can save some cost Mm. But it's once you get more than twenty copies Yes. and that makes the copying quite reasonable. Oh I see, it's not an ordinary photocopier? It, it Oh yeah. But they've got two. This one's called an, an offset Mm. printer. You you've got an ordinary photocopier and an offset. The ordinary photocopier works out a bit more expensive. Mm. But you see, using the offset that case be I don't know what's Well he'll generally want about seventy copies. Yeah. In that way it works out much better. Mm. Because there's an example there, you know, hundred two hundred, whatever you want. There's an example there. Mm. Like, I just really that we could reduce the scale of costing. A little bit. Well why not? You know? It's gonna help my school and it will help us as well. It will do two things won't it? Oh it's the school do does it? It's the school does it. Erm because we've got a printing system for the school th they're, they're now letting out their printing services to others in the community. Mm. Erm so i if you like it's, it's officially done because therefore they're advertising it in our last newsletter we send to every parent Mm. this advert went on the back of it. So if anybody locally wanted . So basically all I would have to do is take them with me and I'd bring them home on the same day. Mm. So it's done there and then. Apart from that I've got all the information we want here Certainly you can. We have an open door. Well yes. the the whole of the I thought but I thought it was erm I mean you haven't Er no it's, it's no we haven't had two sides If you have two sides it'll be quite a few won't it? And sixty copies will be three pound. Cos some of these places in town, people have to charge you VAT as well don't they? Which is Oh yes, yes. what pushes well if you go to somebody it pushes the cost up doesn't it? Mm. And a lot of the commercial ones charge you about ten pence a Oh some of them charge you ten plus VAT don't they? Mm. Which is what adds it up you know, really. So it would Well run out now because I've got all the information I want. Oh well You wanna leave it with me Alan do you? For Friday. Er I doubt if I, I doubt if I'll see Granville before Friday. At least no if I do it will only be Friday morning. And I've got a funeral Friday morning I think. typing letters and that minutes a new typewriter No she's learning how to use it Oh yes. Erm they've there's all the different amount of things you've gotta learn I mean it's even different from a from a computer isn't it? You know it's And a computer you've got a spellchecker. Well she's got a spellchecker on this one. got two capital letters It's what? it's got one small letter and two capitals. ? No. Oh it's a, it's a, it's a good one. We bought it from Smith's on Saturday, it's a Brother. But they were making an offer, if you brought your old machine in they'd offer you thirty pound off. So we thought we may as well take it. Mm. Yes I I've been busy today. David's been helping me set up the I've, I've just bought myself a three eight six. Oh. Well I've got er an electric typewriter. Originally my son had it and he went over to a printer. Mm. A computer and a printer, mm. A wordprocessor? A wordprocessor, yeah Mm. You see the beauty of the beauty of the computer or wordprocessor compared to an electronic typewriter is you can finish your document and then do your spellcheck. Yes. Whereas with the electronic typewriter you've got to do it er Oh yeah. Yes . It's really a better, faster ty ordinary typewriter in a way. Mm. . Otherwise they're pretty well the same as an ordinary typewriter. But er with a wordprocessor The four governments are also resolved to cap their financial liabilities for this programme. So negotiations are in progress on revised prices for the development phase. These have taken somewhat longer than we anticipated but we are at last making good progress towards agreeing prices for the Eurojet contract and we are expecting to receive more acceptable price quotations from Eurofighter very shortly for their part of the work. The changes to the programme also require a new memorandum understanding with our partners. The draft for this is almost complete but it can't be finalised until the costs of the revised programme have been agreed for each of the participating nations. All being well this new M O U will be ready for submission to ministers by the middle of this year. Turning now to the development work itself in general, the development work is going well. There have been no fundamental technical problems. There has been a very considerable delay to the first flight but this is now scheduled for April this year. The delay has been due mainly to the need to be absolutely certain about the integrity of the flight control system software before the aircraft takes to the air. While the delay to the start of the flying programme has been much longer than anyone would wish, much more progress has been made in the ground and rig testing than at the comparable stage of any previous project I have been associated with and we are very satisfied indeed with the results that have been obtained so far. There is assessment in the wind tunnels, for example, is complete and the results are good. The structural test programme is also making extremely good progress and the results from the engine test programme are ex very encouraging indeed. The performance of the engine, on the bench, already meets its full specification for thrust and fuel efficiency and even it exceeds it slightly in some respects. So overall we remain very confident that the Eurofighter two thousand will meet the full operational requirement. So now turning to the point which er I think you asked us to address. Can we quantify, or explain, the areas in which we have made some relaxation and I'll ask Group Captain Granville White to answer that. Well the specific question I asked is whether you've quantified in percentage terms erm perhaps Group Captain you could give us an indication of how it has affected it? Yes certainly, yes. The point about er relaxations and what impact it would have on its combat capability. I think the important point I'd like to make at the outset is that when the review of the requirement was carried out it was carried out both nationally and on a four nation basis, the ministers, once that was complete, the ministers decided that and stated publicly in December ninety two, that we will continue with the existing airframe and engine combination and that each nation er based on a family of aircraft concept could decide from a menu which equipments it would fit according to their individual requirements and their budget and we looked individually at each of the items to see what impact it would have on the operational capability if we were to remove them and what erm was decided in the end and the requirement reflects this, was signed last month by the Chief Surveyor's staff, is that some nations have decided to remove certain items of equipment but for the U K we felt that it was necessary to keep all the major items and therefore as far as the U K is erm impact on the operational requirement is concerned, there is no significant alteration in its operational capability and therefore in overall percentage terms there is no decrease in the capability at all. Now individual nations who've decided to do without a particular item of equipment, clearly that will be developed into the aircraft and therefore they have the option to if they wish to d decide later on to fit it in. Thank you. I'll I think at least four particular areas where the United Kingdom has decided not to, as it were, take the full specification. Er, can we have a look at those or or at least, has accepted specific changes to those specifications. Can we have a look at those four and if you could, I'd be grateful if you can tell me what change in the security situation, as envisaged by the government, has led to our acceptance of those changes. Now the first one, which was mentioned by the minister in the R A F debate, er is the reduced requirement to operate on damaged runways. What change of perception in the security situation has led to our accepting that diminution of capability. Yes the there are two aspects really to that, one is the length of runway operating er and the other is the surface, erm, if I could take the first one. When the requirement was originally written erm and agreed in nineteen eighty seven all of the nations decided that erm we required a short take off and landing capability and that was based on the sort of the then cold war situation where the prospects of runways and airfields being very severely damaged in a sort of central European type of scenario, and therefore the possibility that there might be only very small operating strips available from those runways and that was the basis for the particular length that was decided at the time. Because of the changed security situation and that type of er conflict not being envisaged in the same way now, what we felt was important was to be able to operate er apart from main operating bases, but also from sort of general purpose erm strips, flying clubs and those type of smaller airfields and therefore rather than looking at the damaged runway situation, we looked at the smaller strips and took a length that we could sensibly operate from erm and took that as the yardstick but clearly notwithstanding that, there is the prospect of damaged runways and therefore the slight relaxation would also apply to damaged runways but perhaps damaged to a lesser extent. I think perhaps if I just add a point to that er although we have as four nations agreed on the revised requirement there, I believe it's true to say that development has progressed to such an extent that probably we will have the original requirement in practice, even though we've no longer specified it. That's very encouraging. For no extra charge. Can we then look at the reduced engine thrust erm this presumably would have a significant impact on combat performance, er why is there any change in the security situation that would warrant such a a relaxation? Yes the particular item that was deleted was known as the combat override facility which erm was really a trade off erm to provide extra thrust against the reduced life of the engine and clearly if one operates at the top end of the engine spectrum in er hotter conditions and higher er R P M then clearly the life of the engine will be reduced. Now we had originally had this extra facility available er so that we could trade off life against the extra thrust in an emergency but there was clearly the possibility erm that that might be used er when it really wasn't necessary and we would end up with extra costs, extra life cycle costs, shorter engine life and it was felt on balance that with a reduced threat overall that it was sensible to take out that facility and to accept a longer engine life, but not, there's no reduction in the total normal thrust but its merely its override combat facility. I it doesn't speak very highly if I may say so Group Captain, for R A F discipline if what you're telling me and telling the committee that you think that pilots should be using this facility, would be using this facility when they're ordered not to. No I wasn't suggesting that Mr Chairman. Well why would it be used in circumstances when it was not needed otherwise? I was only thinking really of erm particularly extreme situations erm and I would expect it to be used for example in normal training or anything like that and er certainly all the studies show that the normal thrust, full thrust that was available was sufficient to meet the threat and this extra capability really was a a sort of an extra that was added in early on and really wasn't felt on any of the combat modelling to be necessary. I think I would actually like to pursue that point Group Captain but I I think I'd rather pursue it in in the closed session than an open session. Now can we move on to the reduced quantities of role equipment. Can you tell us what role equipment items have been deleted. Yes, it was not so much a deletion as er a reduction in the numbers because we were very mindful erm in going through the requirement erm and not making significant changes as far as the U K was concerned and we needed to make some savings in cost if at all possible and therefore we carried out a very comprehensive review of all the items of role equipment such as drop tanks er pylons, explosive release units and those type of things which had been provisionally earmarked for a very high intensive and fairly long running conflict and it was felt that if we were to make some savings then it was a sensible balance to reduce those numbers on the basis that we could save some money in the programme but at the same time many of these items could be bought later on at relatively short notice, clearly not within a conflict but in the years to come. on that point. Erm as far as the drop tanks are concerned, does that have any impact on the range or are you just talking about the numbers that you will have spare? They're purely on on the numbers, the same er stand, the different sizes would still be available, there would merely be fewer of them in total stocks. But would you envisage that the numbers er of aircraft actually kitted out with these things have been reduced or are you talking about having spares in case they get lost or damaged? No the the very name, as the name implies, in many cases we would er jettison the drop tanks before entering combat and er therefore there is an agreed rate at which we would expect to use them so that they are a a usable stock in operations . and in training presumably do you drop them in training or do you not? No, not normally, no. So it's only operational. Yes. And can you give an indication of how quickly these things could be ordered in an emergency? Perhaps I can take that one er Group Captain. Once the erm drop tanks have been developed and have entered production in most of the lead time one associates with providing a capability has er has actually been avoided so we could re-order probably within a year. Very reassuring Mr Gordon, I, we're not necessarily gonna have a year's warning that that we're going to need these aircraft in the event of war. Well, that of course er may be true but er as the Group Captain has has said here in the reduced er spec position which we now face and judgement was taken as to how much we should invest in stocks of reserve drop tanks at this point and the option exists to order more. Can I ask it's absolutely meaningless to me, do you mean a month, three months, nine months, eleven months, eleven and a half months, what do you mean? No what I mean is that er once the item is in production if you wish to order another hundred drop tanks or another thousand drop tanks if you make that order then approximately one year later you would receive deliveries of those tanks against that order. Now that would be the normal peacetime lead time if we could accelerate that in industry and find some way of doing it then it may well be possible to do in quicker time than that. So in approximately one year you might be fourteen months or fifteen months? I I'm er quoting a hypothetical situation here that we have entered production with er production line for drop tanks maybe producing two, three thousand tanks against a projected usage for the next ten years and sometime during that period we decide you want to order an additional thousand tanks two thousand tanks then you could adjust the rate at which the deliveries occur, you could adjust the the the total quantity and with about a years notice industry can get in the materials and produce the goods for you. Does that answer your question? If er there was a crisis and there was a need for a rush order er one would be talking of weeks for something that is predesigned to start coming off the production line. experience during the Falklands war and during Gulf war indicated that once an item was in production tremendous acceleration is possible in the real war situation. Yes. I was discussing a year for a normal peacetime lead time. Presumably drop tanks aren't lost very often in peace time, it's operations that you've actually jettisoned, is that right? That is absolutely right, correct. Bruce George. Thank you,i do you feel a little uneasy at changing operational requirements based on er an assessment of a threat in nineteen ninety two, ninety three, which I presume would have to remain valid until two thousand and twenty. So how confident are you that potential adversaries will not have the capability in two thousand and twenty to make a mess of our runways as the Soviets would have done during the er the cold war? Erm I'm asking this question to e satisfy myself that these changes and reduction in costs are not the result of political expediency as opposed to er a genuine assessment of what the risk in the change environment is likely to be. fine. That is precisely the background to the study which was conducted by the four chiefs of defence staff, they were asking that kind of question and I'll now ask the Group Captain to respond. Yes er I think perhaps the point I'd like to emphasis is that the increase er in runway length is really quite a modest one er and therefore it hasn't had an enormous impact. Well the answer is yes but of course landing and taking off on a road is one thing, being able to operate is another one because clearly one needs er fuel, weapons, ground crew and the like but landing on a road in itself is is not difficult. Peter My I move to er questions about the er comparison between the erm Eurofighter and other fighters it might find itself in combat with. Well Peter I'm sorry but the notice only said once,Winston is meant to lead us into that I'm sorry. Right I'm sorry . Winston Churchill. When you updated er the combat analysis using the latest data on Eurofighter did you again compare er Eurofighter with alternatives such as an updated F sixteen or F fifteen er previous combat modelling showed that an alternative aircraft er apart from the F twenty two, did not approach the capability of Eurofighter. Did the latest modelling confirm this and what is the next best alternative in terms of capability. Right, Group Captain Granville White. Yes wh when they reported to the committee two years ago erm I explained that there was combat modelling going on at at the time and indeed that was completed by the end of nineteen ninety two and it showed that er of all the alternatives available then Eurofighter two thousand was the most cost effective solution to the R A F's requirements and yet it would it would not be able to meet up er to the F twenty two but other than that it was superior to all other aircraft. At the moment erm because of the extra time we've got available because production investment has been delayed because of ministerial decisions, we've set in train three further studies and they will look collectively at alternatives, comparison in combat modelling and also in the numbers and if I could describe those three very briefly because I think they're the they're relevant to what we're talking about. The the two, initially there are two studies which will look into numbers, one of those is a top downs study which is based on scenarios and will look at erm a variety of different situations around the world from an analytical point of view. The second one is erm a bottom up study which is based on today's commitments but projecting them forward into the timescale in which we will have the aircraft and looking in that way to see how many and and in what way we would need them. The third one focusing in specifically on the combat modelling is what is known as a C O E I A which is a combined operational effectiveness and investment appraisal and this work is being carried out at Farnborough and we're comparing in single roles and multi-role Eurofighter two thousand against different aircraft. So for example, in the specialist air defence er side we're looking at alternatives would be the F twenty two erm the current tornado F three and also an upgraded variant of the F three. In the ground attack side we're comparing it to the jaguar that it'll replace, the harrier G R seven and also the tornado G R four and then in the multi-role arena for air defence, air superiority and attack we're comparing our aircraft against the French Raphall the American F eighteen E which is the the future variant of the F eighteen, the F fifteen E, the multi-role but primarily air to surface machine and also the F sixteen C. Those are the ones we're currently looking at. As the cost of Eurofighter increases does there come a point where like the F twenty two i it becomes unaffordable and by how much would the performance of Eurofighter have to be degraded before it becomes equivalent to the nearest alternative? I wonder if I could answer that in a in a different way because clearly rather there's the option, rather than reduction the operational capability which was really the er initiative that had begun in nineteen ninety two, there is the option of course of er adjusting the total numbers and that would er have an overall bearing on the total programme cost but cert because certainly the judgement of the er the chiefs of staff was that er as far as the U K was concerned then we we should retain the operational capability as I explained earlier an n and not decrease it in any significant extent because if we did that then we could end up er with an inferior capability against a potential threat. During the last year erm when we were working on the requirement, we carried out a number of erm comparisons descoping or aircraft in various respects. For example taking out the forward looking infra-red, infra-red search and track, taking out the the M I D S, the multiple information distribution system and certain aspects of the er defensive aids, to see what impact that would have and we found that if we removed any one of those erm then we would either come down to parity against potential threat or possibly er inferiority and that was really the supporting evidence to retain the full capability. But Group Captain are you saying that as er a platform it has not been degraded at all, there's basically no change in thrust, in turn rate or in airframe G loading? Yes, that's correct. Thank you. Peter was your question answered or not? No in the air superiority role I didn't hear a comparison with the S U thirty five or the Fulcrum M E twenty nine S er are there any other aircraft of er perhaps comparable capacity with which you did not compare Eurofighter? What we've done,won one of the points I think that is worth er making perhaps is that on er over the last few years we've seen a complete change in world export philosophy where not only are the Russians exporting all over the place but clearly er there are a number of western aircraft in different parts of the world and therefore what we have also done is to, in comparing er our aircraft against other western ones, we've also looked at them as potential threats because it's possible that er erm western aircraft in certain hands could end up being used against us so we have also compared those. But the question that young pilots would want to know the answer to is this, erm are there aircraft anywhere in the world with which you have not made a comparison in terms of air superiority? No, there are none. So you have compared with the And the S U? Yes we've compared with everything and specifically the ones you've mentioned, the S U thirty five and the which is an upgraded S U twenty seven and the M I G twenty nine S, yes we've specifically compared against those two. And you've been reassured by the responses? Yes. Thank you Chairman. Thank you, Michael Colgan Yes Mr Chairman I'm not clear erm about something that Mr Gordon said in his opening remarks that I'd like clarified and that is that he gave the committee the impression that there were er certain of the of the partners that were accepting erm a lower specification in other words, omitting from the what is the British best if you like, erm certain items of of equipment in order to reduce cost of the aircraft, both in development stage and at the production stage, final cost of the aircraft, unit cost. Erm we asked the question about the aircraft's reduced operational capabilities as far as Britain is concerned, we were told that there was no reduction, erm there was no percentage figure that could be produced but w now what about the other countries, I mean, which countries are asking for what to be omitted and by how much is the percentage, in percentage terms er is the performance of the aircraft reduced in those cases and further on from that, picking up something that that Wing Com er Group Captain Granville White has just mentioned which i is the question of sales. Yes. Erm it does obviously have a bearing on sales to the third countries when the er aircraft is in production. Do I get the impression that we're basically building a a basic aircraft with optional extras, or are we building an aircraft which can be, to some degree, sanitised because obviously there are some parts of the specification of the aircraft we may not wish third cra countries to have. It's a well known fact that aircraft are sold all around the world, this can have a bearing on the capability and also a bearing on their cost and therefore saleability. Perhaps, from those remarks, it's hardly a question but perhaps you could just clarify Yes. my er thinking on on the on what you said in opening remarks which don't make it clear to me whether we've got a basic aircraft with optional extras or a fully specified aircraft from which we can dat deleted certain items of equipment. Erm, well I think I can reassure that it is the latter. The development programme for the aircraft will provide the broad range of capabilities which was asked for by all four nations originally and er the fact that one or more nations may have deleted its requirement for a particular facility doesn't remove the need for us to complete the development work er because we still have at least one or two customers for that facility. So it's definitely the latter, we are developing a fully capable Eurofighter two thousand aircraft and if erm any of our four participating nations do not want a particular facility then we will make provision for them to leave that out in production and if an export customer does not require the full range of capabilities we can also remove them for that export customer. But by how much could we degrade the aircraft and still be capable of erm competing with erm other aircraft in in the market? Well I I I would prefer to perhaps follow this one up in the closed session later but erm. we we'll pursue that er in private. Neville Trotter. going to go into service in the next century, it's going to be around till well into the next century. Very briefly what would it do that the present generation of aircraft won't, how is it a quantum leap ahead? Fine, I will again invite the the Group Captain to answer that. Perhaps I could er answer that in er I think there are probably four points that er come out to my mind erm the first one in the airframe engine combination, a very high degree of agility. The ability to be able to pull nine G which is er generally accepted to be the physiological limit for pilots, which is more than any of our aircraft can . What can we do now by contrast? Er, none of our aircraft can pull more than seven G, normal aircraft. There's also a close correlation by not just the erm the size of the number for G, but how long can it go on pulling that G given the thrust and the aerodynamic capabilities of the machine and we are essentially building this aircraft so that it can sustain nine G and we are providing the pilot with the sort of equipment he requires to be able to survive in that kind of environment. Is this for a dog fight? Yes, yes. . Th it has er a considerable negative G capability as well. Would it be able, er pulling that erm G to compete with the with the harrier using the technique? Erm Group Captain Granville White. The simple answer is yes. Er so I think the first of my four points is the is the airframe agility, clearly the the ability to m manoeuvre. The second erm is is and perhaps is related in a way er in the air to air weapons where erm in older missiles have had what is known as sort of bore sight capability where they go in the direction of the aircraft. Clearly to have the combination of an off bore sight capability for a a missile such as A S R A A M, the er advance short range air to air missile, the combination of the agility of the weapon and the flat platform together has been shown to be really needed, you can't have one without the other and that somebody who has only agility in the aircraft or agility in the in the weapon, will lose against somebody who has it in both. So I think that's the probably the sort of related point. Moving on into the sort of sensors and the electronics side, erm for survivability erm the defensive aid sub- system will be er very complex, very sophisticated but also integrated so that it has a complete system of protection for the aircraft, erm an and finally moving on on the sort of electronics side then clearly with different sensors such as the radar, the forward looking infra-red, infra-red search and track the er multiple information distribution system and also certain aspects of the er electronic warfare suite then by having sensor fusion which enables the best information at any one time to be correlated into the system as a whole then that will provide a very good capability and far in excess of anything that we have at the moment. Thank you very much. I'll ask Campbell to take us on into the question of the role of this aircraft. We understand that some new weapons, not previously in the specification, are to be included. Are you able to tell us in open session what sort of weapons are envisaged? Erm perhaps I can invite my colleague from the office of management and budgets to speak to that one. Erm chairman yes we hope to to erm, excuse me, to erm that E four will be capable of er sorry E F two thousand will be capable of handling all our erm planned weapons er which are already in our programme the er conventional er, the C A S O M, the conventionally armed, stand-off missile, the er anti- armour missile er twelve thirty eight and the future medium range air-to-air missile er whatever that happens to be er as a result of er competition. What about the low level laser guided bomb, is that also included in this? Yes it is. Erm does the fact of erm using the aircraft to er provide a platform for these systems, er tell us something about a change in view about the role or operating concept of the aircraft? Erm Group Captain Granville White . thank you Erm not not change erm with envisagement . Widen Wi certainly broaden, we've we've envisaged from the outset that the aircraft would be both will be multi- role capable and that erm all that the primary design driver will be the air-to-air air superiority role but the air-to-surface role would be almost an equal, clearly one has to have a a prioritisation and those particular weapons in the air-to-surface side, the conventional armed stand off missile along the low level er low level laser guided bomb and the future anti armour weapon, they clearly erm really take the weaponeering side into the next century. We will still have the ability to carry today's weapons such as the the L seven five five cluster bomb unit, the thousand pound bomb erm and the C R V seven rocket and things like that but clearly as we move forward into the century it's important that as the platform progresses then so does the aircraft. Are the any weapons er which the aircraft er would not be able to , for example the J P two three three closely associated with the tornado, er is that a system which you would anticipate Eurofighter two thousand to be able to carry? No, it it's too large and too heavy and really that is a different role that's more the role for the tornado G L one, G L four. And I think you mentioned thousand pounds bombs. Yes. Is that the, is that the limit could anything heavier than that It's , no it's not the limit er the limit of weight, it can carry er heavier ones. You may not wish to say in open session . I think probably as you . in closed session. Yes, it's probably more appropriate. Erm I was rather interested by the comparisons which you explained a little earlier in the evidence erm if you've got an aircraft which is er going to replace, as I understand it the Jaguar and the Phantom which has already been retired,er against which you've been comparing the F three er and the G R four of the tornados and the harriers, then er that gives rise in my mind to the possibility that this is an aircraft which might replace all of these, in which case will that have consequences for the still er publicly declared intention to order two hundred and fifty, might we order more for example? Mr Evans. Erm as you say Mr Campbell er the plan at the moment is that the F two thousand will replace jaguar and the tornado A D V F three aircraft and the scope er of replacing other aircraft er remains under consideration, er provisional off take of two fifty er was declared at the d the start of the development phase and of course our work share in development is based on that number. Before we seek authorisation for the production phase, it will be necessary for each nation to restate or modify it's planned off take and that will be done very firmly on the basis of the studies which er Group Captain Granville White has already d described which will factor in er against our military tasks, which is,y you know we define now fairly clearly, er exactly what aircraft are needed to undertake those tasks in what scenarios and in the future er as you say, there may well be scope for er adding additional aircraft types to that. Well I think I understand that answer to be an affirmative, that if this aircraft is capable of replacing, if you like, the suite of aircraft we've been discussing, then er that may well result in orders for more than two hundred fifty. It could do because obviously there are a number of other considerations, not least affordability er within the defence programme which erm from my point of view is a very important consideration. But of course if one wants to continue to have the capability into the next century, which the present er range of aircraft provides, er then Eurofighter two thousand may be the only available platform for those purposes. Indeed and I think the er the point about Eurofighter is that it's a very flexible er aircraft, it's a multi-role aircraft, it's a cost effective aircraft and therefore it er, as you say, may well be able to cover quite a large spectrum. Can I ask you about er the medium range surface to air missile because er, you won't be surprised to learn, that er the committee's received a number of submissions on this matter er which suggest that er er t to proceed with Eurofighter two thousand without the medium range surface to air missile er I mean to be put rather bluntly to us, that it makes little sense to proceed with the aircraft without a replacement for blood hound. What's your response to that? Well I think perhaps I can start that and the Group Captain may want to come in. Er I think our position is that we provide as you know, air defence through a layered system er of air defence aircraft and missiles and the simple truth is that in the light of the changes in the strategic er setting, particularly er as it affects U K air defence, we have decided that the provision of a medium defensive layer, that is the M sound system to which you refer, is not a high priority at the moment and the programme is therefore being postponed and I have to emphasise it's not been abandoned. Well erm if I were then to ask you when what was your best estimate to when the programme was likely to be commenced. I fancy you would not be able to give me any more precise an answer than one you've just given, isn't that right? Well programmers tend not to be precise in this, in this kind of er context er Mr Campbell. But certainly we er as I said, the essential point is that we are looking, looking at the capability across the board and taking into account the strategic requirement as we see it in terms of the direct threat to the U K in particular, which is obviously dramatically declined as a result of the collapse of the Warsaw pact. We believe that certainly for the time being, the combination of the fighter aircraft and rapier will provide an acceptable level er of air defence with a much reduced air threat to the U K er which now exists. We will continue to look at er the future programme er we will also as you know, look at ballistic missile defence which is another element to this and that must need to be fact facted in as well but I think clearly we are not talking about in the medium term er and longer term, we are talking about er a fairly late stage of the programme. I mean how do you protect Eurofighter two thousand in the absence of the medium range surface to air missile on the, I think you you told us about er the aircraft themselves as it were providing their own protection but what else? Well as I've said we we have as you say y y yourself, you have the aircraft itself, you have the er the existing er air defence aircraft, you have rapier and in in our view, er in certainly in terms of the U K's threat er that is er an acceptable er er suite of preventative measures in the light of the threat which we now have. I think I have to make the point to you that we are planning to roughly double the size of the er airforce equipment programme er between now and the end of the century, a very substantial chunk of that is E F two thousand and its er associated weapon systems and, you know, one has to frankly, take er a view on priorities er in the light of the strategic requirement and given the er extent of the threat as we see it, the possibility of using er of taking part in out of area operations in coalitions, that kind of thing, that was the judgement we took er the medium term priorities were such that we couldn't afford the first er stage of A M S A M. W was that decision to any extent er influenced by, if I can put it rather er ineptly, the state of blood hound when it was taken out of service. Well as you know I think the committee looked at this erm in nineteen ninety one and er I think it is fairly true to say that by the time it was taken out of service blood hound did not represent a very high level of capability erm and the gap, there is a gap obviously between blood hound it'll it'll now be a rather longer gap between that and any A M S A M replacement, er but blood hound itself was judged to be frankly not worth having. I remember Mr Alan Clarke who was then minister of responsibility saying rather elliptically in the house of commons that the removal of blood hound did nothing to degrade Britain's air defence. I would not wish to disagree with Mr Clarke. Well I wouldn't offer that as a general er proposition. Neither would I actually, in this particular case . perhaps we should confine it to the specifics we're talking. One last matter please erm, so far as I understand that you've not yet drafted the separate staff requirement for reconnaissance, I beg you pardon, reconnaissance equipment for Eurofighter two thousand. Are you able to tell us what the timescale of that is? Perhaps I can ask Group Captain? Yes. of the four nations in the programme, the U K is the only one that has a requirement for reconnaissance. Erm, and at the moment we are carrying out some studies which er are nearing completion, to decided exactly what the R A F's future requirements are for tactical reconnaissance. As that work comes to er fruition, the staff target will be drafted and in fact work is already begun on that, erm but because the reconnaissance capability won't be required until fairly late in the replacement programme then there is no particular hurry to get on with the work. What we hope to be able to do is to complete the requirement the staff target this year and set in train some industrial studies to see what the various options are and then once we enter the production investment phase then that would be the time that we would er look to doing the development work. Are these costs included in the overall estimates which have been given to us f for the reconnaissance. reconnaissance. Er, yes indeed they are. They are many thanks, thank you. Neville Trotter. from what you've told us, it would be possible for this aircraft to be so multi mission it could replace the whole of the front line er R A F fast jet strain, could that be true? Group Captain. I I think the the the point I would I wish to make is that in whilst er its multi role capability would have enabled it to replace a number of roles and possibly a number of er aircraft and er as Mr Evans said earlier, that's still being looked at. The one role that it won't be able to carry out is, as we were talking earlier, about the er J P two three three, runway denial weapon and also er nuclear. So that that,those two roles er clearly cannot be covered by it. I I was also thinking o of Veestol and and er the weapons going on and the mistakes anyway on on the developing a harrier replacement, is the R A F still interested in that as a feature a short take-off vertical take-off? I think the R A F would would clearly be interested in in keeping in touch with what's going on there, of course the states themselves er the picture is not entirely clear er about er what kind of types are going to emerge in the longer term but we would certainly wish to keep a a close view on what was going on and of course there is a Navy dimension to to the harrier replacement as well. Coming back to what you said about the load carrier, we are supposed to no longer be in the nuclear game in the airforce, isn't that right coming out of the nuclear role? So that would no longer be a consideration. I think I think erm it's a question, Mr Trotter, it's the long range penetrator I think which erm is is the distinction, it's the ability to get through low level, longer range and carrying greater level of ordnance than either . Wh what about er runway lengths, obviously depends on what it's carrying but er how how does it compare with existing aircraft for that? Erm, it's very much shorter because as we were saying earlier on the the short take off and landing capability, erm with er I'd prefer to talk about distances perhaps in the closed session but the er the simple answer is very much . Only one crew member with all the technology in the world, some of us still think that it's a comfort to have somebody in the back watching the systems. Well that particular subject of course is er er still a matter which is discussed with great heat er in the crew rooms all over the Royal Air Force. Especially the navigators. Exactly and er we are buying er a two seat version of this aeroplane er our two seat version is aimed primarily at operational training but er we have examined er time and again whether we believe the er the integration of the avionics which is possible in this aeroplane and which is planned for this aeroplane er is going to be able to reduce the pilot work load to such an extent that one man can comfortably do the job and we have arrived at the conclusion that he most certainly can. The er work which has preceded at er British Aerospace in the the cockpit, to bring together all the information, displays and controls erm has been tested on er a team of eighteen pilots from, drawn from the four nations, to see whether they believe they can cope with that sort of pilot work load in in simulated operations and they're content that this kind of cockpit is ideally suited for the task and they can cope. So we are convinced that it is er a cheap one. What about spare aircraft. Do you set out the sum, er you must set out some calculation of how many you are likely to to lose over the life of the aircraft, is there a percentage figure you could give us for that? Erm, Mr Evans er will reply to that, obviously we we do plan for certain levels. Yes I think it's fair to say at the moment that, that, that is being looked at Mr Trotter, together with er the broader range of issues on the er the operating concept er for E F two thousand but it is of course standard practice to buy not just the number you need for the front line but to buy sufficient aircraft to keep that front line in field for about twenty five, thirty years, whatever the life of the aircraft happens to be, taking account of er attrition, taking account of training requirements and engineering needs and support needs and all that kind of thing and all that work er is, has been done, is being done at the moment and er final figures will be put to that in in due course. Thank you, Mr Colgan. Mr erm bearing in mind it its multi role capability and the fact that the U K is likely to be engaged in more and more out of air operations in support of U N er has any consideration been given to a maritime variant. Would that be er a practical thing to do or would you have to start redesigning a new aircraft? Er by maritime variant do you . I mean from air, to fly from aircraft carriers. The short answer is no. Not at this stage. Is that because of technical difficulties, or for some other reason. Erm er it's basically that there is no stated requirement at present from any of the four nations, for this aircraft to operate on ships er back in the early days of the programme when the the French were involved er we looked at the possibility of designing an aircraft er to provide the whole spectrum of capabilities from air defence er ground attack and also maritime operations off ships and er we we certainly experienced some difficulties in reconciling all those things in one design, which was adequately capable in each of the areas. Thank you Campbell. There's an ambiguity I suspect it it's a in my mind rather than yours about the nuclear role, did I understand you to say that Eurofighter two thousand would not have the capability of carrying for instance the W E one seven seven, we know that the is not going to be er taken any further according to recent announcement but will Eurofighter two thousand have the capacity to carry W E one seven seven? No that demonstrated the point I was making, it will not. So it, in the absence of the Tasm and in the absence of the capability then it's not gonna have a nuclear role. No. Thank you very much. Winston Churchill. Would there not be merits er at least putting in the requisite wiring in case at a future date, that a C A S O M for instance, became dual capable? Er, perhaps I could make er one comment, maybe Mr Gordon will ma wish to make a a technical comment on it, but certainly when we began the programme and we discussed with the other nations in the early stages of of the collaboration. erm It was really one of the guidelines, it was the, if we considered doing that then I don't think we would have had a four nation programme or certainly a five nation programme at the start, I don't think we would've er stayed together, it was really one of the basic requirements not to have that capability. But is it not an add on capability er to a large degree if the basic wiring is there? I think we'd find Mr Churchill that it it's rather more complex than that and and the requirements for delivering a nuclear weapon and you refer to the possibility of C A S O M being nuclear capable, one has to be fairly careful quite a, there's a degree of difference between a missile needed to do the two jobs and I think it would be rather more than wiring which would be er at issue here, there's the payload and all the rest of it which I suspect would cause very severe problems with that. Er well we always start from what does the operator of this aircraft want to use it for. This E S R D really is the bible and we have specified the aircraft to meet that E S R D and not anything extra, er obviously if one of the four nations wants to build a nuclear role into the aircraft that becomes a very big political question first and foremost and we have just not considered it at the technical level at all because it's er it's not in the requirement. Is it a big technical problem or is it very straight forward. Er I don't think I'd wish to speculate in in open forum. It doesn't require a great bite of imagination to see that the Germans for example would have been extremely reluctant to have been involved in a four nation project with a nuclear capability available as part of it. Well I I I wouldn't er pin point the German attitude on this one, I mean after all we did collaborate with Germany very successfully on the tornado which has a nuclear role but the the four governments must first of all decide if that is what we want to build into this aeroplane and they decided that they did not at that stage. I stand corrected. Fine. If I just er end this this particular item in two brief questions. From what you said about reconnaissance equipment it rather sounds to me as if the tornado D R one A is likely to be replaced by in this reconnaissance role. Is that right? I think as a Group Captain er explained y'know the the operational staff have really got to complete their study into what kind of tactical reconnaissance capability they want in the next century. The D R one A is currently an excellent er tactical reconnaissance aircraft, all weather, at night etcetera and er it will go on well into the next century so there's no great hurry to to make a decision er one of the first points has gotta be decided is whether we carry the reconnaissance equipment in a pod under the aircraft replacing some of the other weapons or whether we try to build it in and er but taking first things first we have to get the requirement sorted out. Thank you and as far as the jaguar's concerned I noted that the jaguar is not being phased out now until two thousand and four, that being a three year further delay. Is that related to the delay in production dates? Erm, Mr Evans. Er no I don't think it is Mr Chairman. And do we know what the reasoning behind it is . Well we do or we'd, it had already been envisaged that er the jaguars would run out at er roughly that time. I think it was three years earlier though wasn't it? Well er the I mean there has been a slight complexity with the replacement er programme of course because er er E F two thousand was originally envisaged that it would replace the phantoms er as as as as well as the jaguars and now that er has altered with the decision in options to er get rid of er the phantom squadrons, we've er been able to adjust the replacement programme such that er the aircraft E F two thousand will replace er the erm er the jaguar and some of the F threes er and the programme will be adjusted such that we get er the most cost effective er mixture of replacement of those two types and there is no problem with keeping the jaguar going until that stage and it may well be it is, is being judged to be cheaper that we should er do some F three replacement at the same time, again partly for cost reasons because it's gonna be more cost effective to do it that way. like the jaguar really be able to go on that long given er that er there's an awful lot of errors in the Gulf apart from anything else. Well obviously that factor er was considered carefully by the Ministry of Defence before our Secretary of State agreed that we could safely defer the in service date for Eurofighter two thousand and adjust the the er replacement plan er back in December ninety two, so we have looked at what is the current rate of consumption of airframe life on the jaguar er what can be done economically and sensibly to keep it flying safely and effectively into the next century and er we have come to the conclusion that we have a viable plan here which can tie up with the planned rate of delivery to service of Eurofighter two thousand. So are you gonna have to restrict training in er operational flights jaguar at a stretch just to stretch out the hours? We understand that that is not necessary but erm my colleague may wish to. No . But it does sound from what you're telling us now that it is actually directly related and to recall my original question, was it related to programme to which I had the answer no, erm what you said . Well I I apologise we're not trying to mislead you er Mr Chairman in any way. Clearly there is a connection, if Eurofighter two thousand was available earlier then they the plan for replacing er some of the aircraft in the R A F's front line er could be adjusted accordingly erm but it's not a sort of direct one for one er if the part of the programme slips a year the jaguar must go on an extra year because within the R A F's overall plans for its er fleet replacement there is a certain degree of flexibility an and precisely which point the jaguars get replaced is er a judgement between them and their three. I think I know what you mean anyway, thank you. Neville Trotter Two er requirements for the future that er seem to be er er desirable are stealth and what could be stealthier than the present generation of aircraft and secondly to prevent you having to go over your target you're likely to be shot down so that you need a stand up weapon capability, er if the payload is somewhat limited can it still carry stand off weapons that are effective? Er, Group Captain. those yes, yes. Erm perhaps I could would it, I wonder if you could just expand on stealth exactly what the er Have actually already covered them another time and I don't want to get deeper in the stealth now than that, there's a limit on the time now available this morning. Can we deal with the weapon question, the stand off weapons. I can answer that very briefly Mr Chairman er yes, there will be the capability to carry stand off weapons the conventionally armed stand off missile for example will have a good stand off range. That will be carried by . That will be carried and er with a shorter range but the advanced anti armour weapon, that will also have a stand off capability and that will also be carried. go on into the development timescale and costs. Yes it's now going to take two years longer I think than was originally er contended, to what extent is this due to technical difficulties and to what extent is it due to one of our partners and Germany one's thinking of in particular, wishing to slow the programme down for fiscal reasons? Well erm it's a combination of both those factors er as I've mentioned at the outset the development programme has moved ahead a little more slowly than we would wish, the main reasons for this were associated firstly with the delay in selecting equipment er and that took longer than our contractor ha had imagined. Secondly the deliveries of the equipment from the equipment suppliers who had been selected er generally fell behind the promises which they had made, so the main reason for the technical delays has been lack of equipment of the correct standard to proceed with the integration programme erm the erm the problems which beset the programme in nineteen ninety two after the German minister started questioning its future clearly had a direct bearing on that because many of the equipment suppliers, particularly those in Germany, suddenly began to think hey this programme is not going anywhere, why should we invest a lot of effort and and money into it and they slowed down so that has had a knock on effect in in terms of delaying the total programme and erm the result of all of that has been that the current development programme schedule which we have supplied to the committee is probably about as fast as the programme is capable of running. First flight still going to be in April? We are confident it will be in April, yes. And will that aircraft be less capable in its first flight than you'd originally hoped? Erm it has always been planned that the this er release of the flight control system, will be phased through five steps and the capabilities at first flight are more or less what we had been planning er right from the outset. The cost is going to be some three thousand four hundred million I think to er to the U K. That's er gone up by about thirteen percent, four hundred million roughly, er over the original estimates, half of that is due to programme re-orientation because of the extension of the programme by two years as I understand it. Can you spell out what those costs are and are we having to pay more because Germany wants to slow the programme down? Perhaps I can ask Mr Perry to er fill in the details on costs? Yes. Erm Mr Trotter er that er apportionment of the four hundred and fifty million between er the effect of programme re-orientation and other factors. Can I just say that I had figured four hundred million, it is in fact four fifty. Four fifty million sorry. Four fifty million, erm between programme re-orientation and other factors was an apportionment we made back in the er first half of nineteen ninety three and in the light of later information I think we would revise that now erm we are still negotiating with the contractors on did you move from there? We went into Street for a few years and then we came up here in nineteen twenty eight. Erm why did they move to Street, your family? Oh it was a bigger house, better house altogether ah that was a very nice house, a very nice garden as well. Was that sort of house typical of the area? Well it was a question in those days whether you got a bay window or a flat window I mean erm the houses down Street are better quality I suppose really er all property around there is rented, I mean no one bought the houses at all not even up , I mean they were all rented houses. Er and I remember, I remember Street West, when the right hand side of Street west going from Road, every house was empty before the First World War and they gave somebody er somebody who lives in the end one and they were rent free if they keep all the rest clean, and always you see house to let where wherever it was in every street there was houses to let, and the price of the house in Street must be about eight shillings a week in those days, and then if you went up to I mean you'd get in the twelve and sixpenny bracket and down in, those houses down in the that they were ten and six or something like that er So would you say that that was the smart side of ? Oh yes yes, yes you'd say that was the smart side of Caldmore, but er What ways did the families differ then that lived in those sort of houses to the families that lived in the terraced houses ? Oh I I think, think that they differed in as far as they were a tiny little bit more ambitious and wanted a sort of erm a a little bit better life, but everybody even in the terraced houses they were all very respectable people, very respectable people I mean er I Were any of the families considered rough? No, no I can, I can honestly say that I don't think there was any, any what you can call rough families as I can remember. Now you take all those, take Street and Street, they were all very respectable people and er I don't think you could say there were any slums about at all as far as I can remember. Now you go to Road and Street and round there, probably that wasn't quite as er as nice but Street and Street they were very nice people, very respectable. So some streets were considered better than others? Oh yes yes er I should say that er Street er Street then you get into Palfrey now you see Palfrey was a little bit less due to the fact that there were a hell of a lot of railway men at work down there, I mean really all belonging to some department on the railway, you get er drivers and all the men and the permanent way of being in Street I mean a lot of people from Palfrey lived down lived in Palfrey was working in the permanent way in Street, so it was a really, Palfrey you could say was a railway community. Now if you come to Caldmore, you'll find out then that the majority of the married ladies had worked in I mean I should say that erm I know my mother was very snooty she'd been an apprentice to some dressmakers in Street and work for one year for nothing she always used to tell me, and she was quite er toffee- nosed about these girls that used that er that used to go, well they were very respectable people, and when I was a kid when I growing up in my teens a lot of the girls I used to know were in the offices at er it they employed about fifteen hundred people at in those days you know I mean coming out of at night it was fighting your way against the crowd if you were going towards it, and the same thing going through the square for people who have worked in when they left that's why all those shops in the square used to do reasonably well, it was the people walking through to go up the other side of Walsall, but there was a crowd of people I can, I can always remember as a kid a crowd of people and then there'd be well you can tell it was along Street in those days I can remember fruiters' carts where the girls used to go and buy apples, and that all sort of going along there you know people used to wait for them coming out, these are my impressions as a kid I mean I can remember the, the er and the men of course were cutters and various people and a quite a lot of my father's friends were, were er had er skilled jobs at as cutters and managers of the cutters' department and that sort of thing. Then, then of course there weren't no traffic signs in the middle of the road, it was a sort of er certain people from went and started that up and er they were all wor all worked in Caldmore it was almost as though the tailoring Caldmore was full of tailors in a way then there were people starting up on their own making clothes, but er there was quite a lot of tailors around er I know there was he'd got a shop on Caldmore, he was a tailor and er shall we go through all the shops? Yes. Well we'll start off at the top of Road and on the one side there was the furniture people they used to make furniture. Did they make it on the premises? Oh yes they made it Miss has just died erm then coming down there was the Post Office with old Pa and the, then the Miss , they used to keep the Post Office, then there was er well there was a gents outfitters and then there was a beautiful shop I always used to think, it was called, another , but it was confectioners, but it was all most delightful old oldy-worldy sort of shop and my mother often used to go in there then you'd Tell me a bit more about that shop then. About that shop. There was a Victorian air about it somehow there were, there were quite ladies who'd kept it, almost the same sort of thing as you'd find out in the country, country Ye Olde Elizabethan Coffee Shop type of thing you know, they they'd be the er there was that atmosphere about it and you'd buy lovely cakes and things like that. Then coming on to the end of Street next door was a milliners, now that nobody knows what they are today Miss the name was and then coming across Street to the other side was which was a drapers, and next coming down was Smiths the butcher's shop, and next to that was the grocers, following on down there was the ironmonger, then there was the newspaper, and you come down to the White Hart erm then we come to the White Hart Do you remember anything about that? Oh yes er I think somebody kept it around father's day, a chap named , but it was a beautiful old place and he always, because my father always used to erm start off about seven o'clock in the morning to walk down to Walkers and er call in at the White Hart because they were open at six o'clock in the morning, for a rum and coffee for about tuppence or thruppence, then he always used to er go to his mother's for his breakfast and er he used to go down and see all the men start off and then, then slip over to his mother's, she lived on the Road and er she, for years and years this went on that he had his break he never had his breakfast at home he'd start off going down there and come back to his mother's, but he always stopped at the White Hart for his rum and coffee Did many people go in ? Oh yes yes oh well yes for a rum and coffee yeah, and I'm afraid it was very acceptable on a winter's morning, but erm now we come, we've come on that side of Road, we'll now start at the top of Road again and come along as far as er what I call Street I believe it's now where St Michael's church is, and you come to Sammy the butchers. Now Sammy was a character in himself he was a bachelor and his wi his sister was Fanny the elocutionist er and, and er there the women used to, to go into old Sammy's shop on a Friday night simply to be entertained by all the wisecracks and nonsense that used to go on in there, and somebody would say I suppose you're off this weekend and he'd say yes I'm off to my little widow in Wales, he hadn't got a little widow in Wales at all now but it would the start of the conversation going. My mother's been up there and she didn't come back for two hours and she came back we kept well he'd sold a lot of meat in the meantime. The next three shops was which was a er he become I think in the finish but it was a toy shop and then you came to er the fruiters, on the other side of Street, and you came down to er little pawnshop. I, I shall be seeing the you know in a few weeks time the daughter she's a, she's er Rene that was erm Eddie , who were very big pals of mine and we go to the anniversary lunch together so we're all over eighty but erm you couldn't the bread shop, was another confectioner's shop, and then turning round the corner you come to another shop, up two steps, which was and that was another type of confectionery and shop, then you get as far as the corn and seed people er they used to have a shop in Street as well, and then before the First World War there was the butchers and they sold foreign meat. Fourpence ha'penny a pound this New Zealand lamb was I remember. Mother wouldn't have anything to do with it whatsoever, don't you bring anything, any of that stuff into our house, I mean of course it be this New Zealand lamb had just arrived on the scene before the First Word War, I mean nobody was, anybody dare have it I mean they'd be standing on the pavement at eleven o'clock at night almost giving it away on Saturday night, but anyway that's all changed now, we all eat it. Then you got to er the picture house er that happened just before the First World War that was put up as far as I can remember, I know I used to go there and see erm the Broken Coin which was a serial picture and it was you know er where somebody was up to their neck in water one week and it would say that the continuation of this picture would be shown in this theatre one week from today and you . what was it like inside? Pardon? What was it like inside? Nice, very nice, you went up a long hall toward, as soon as you got er through the doors it was very nice really, quite, quite something for Caldmore anyway. Then on the corner of Street and Green was the tobacconist shop. Then coming along Street you come to the picture frame people and then the Conservative Club, then there was the big house further on towards the top of Street and that was owned by somebody named Winnie , was my second wife's she went to school with her they used but her father lived there, and on the other side of the road you got the toy shop and er the draper's shop on the corner of er Road then there was the newsagents and one or two people kept that, but that takes you from the top of Street straight the way up to Caldmore. Now on Green, now we go, we've come along from the top of Street right along Road, the toy shop then you get to the Kings Arms and on the other side of the road there was another pub and I can't remember the name of it, then there was the fish shop and then the Liberal Club then the pork butchers you'd think they were all full of meat. There were a lot of butchers. Butchers and er then there was the butchers and that was on the corner of and er and and then cross over there towards Street you've got the stores, then you come the, the er drapers, then er Tommy the butcher who was my first wife's uncle and then you come to a shop which was owned by one or two people, which was a sort of er general store and then my mother-in-law's shop a cook's which was What sort of shop was that? Which was a bakers and confectioners, they used to er bake at the, they got the er the bakehouse at the back and they used to make confectionery and high class bread. And what sort of shop was it itself was it a large shop? Oh quite a nice shop, yes very nice shop. Would they display the bread? Oh yes, yes in the, in the window yes I think and many and many a ticket I got when I first got married to my first wife I used to do my mother-in-law's little tickets for all the various custards, and, and Eccles cakes and four for thruppence ha'penny it doesn't of course I could print right you see she said, being a draughtsman I always could print right so I used to do the four for thruppence ha'penny. How much are they today? Well I bought, I bought three custards the other day and I think they were about fifty three pence. Have you got any special memories about any of these shops at all for any reason? Any that you used to go in a lot that you can tell me about? Perhaps for instance. Oh yes I used to go and fetch the er erm I used to go into every week, oh there was the maypole next to as well. I used to go and fetch the, the butter from don't bring margarine my father used to say we put better stuff on our machines so er I used to go to for my father kept foul, I used to fetch a peck of, bushel of this and a bushel of, you know all the various things that, bran and stuff for the foul yes, yes and I believe a lady, she has, she's only recently died and but she kept it for a long long while Elsie her name was. And what was it like inside were ? Oh yes, sacks of other and they used to have a proper corner seedman's shop, which you don't see about today the er Garden Centre has knocked all that on the nut hasn't it really? What about chemist. Whereabouts was that? That was er coming down from Street you come to then you come to the grocers and was next- door there that's the only link with Caldmore as it used to be and Caldmore as it is now Maybe because it's still there. Yes probably yes. And what sort of shop was it in your day when you were young Michael? Oh quite a nice shop. I used to know, I used to play at tennis with Bay , the daughter and er the eldest daughter she married another chemist and he ran the place afterwards I think, then there was Jack but er I, I used to know, I used to know quite a lot of the er people on the, who kept these shops. Was it the sort of chemist that erm was it the sort of chemist that you'd go in if you'd got something the matter with you and rather than go to the doctor, they would sort of dole out something for you? Well I've never had the experience and I don't think my family have, I er no I shouldn't think it was really, they might, I suppose somebody, they used to have a reputation at one time these chemists was doing minor, giving you something for some minor ailment, but I wouldn't care to sort of er, I'd never think of it, no there were quite a lot of doctors about you know, there was er Doctor at the top of Road and there was Doctor , Doctor oh there was a lot of doctors about. Were you sent to Sunday School when you ? Oh yes rather. Which one did you used to go to? Well my mother was one of the pillars of the Palfrey church and er she er oh I went, my father never used to go, but she used to go and of course I, I used to be an altar server down there when I got a bit older I did for a week or two to the erm do you know anything about an Anglo-Catholic Church I mean where they swing the incense and there is this little boy with the boat? I was that for about, I soon got fed up with that job. How old were you when you did that? Oh about eight, seven or eight, but when we first went there the honourable S G W was the vicar, fourth son of the Earl of and er, oh you he was there then afterwards er Father came, and I used to do altar serving oh I was never interested in it you know I was forced into it. Who forced you into it? My mother I remember there was a sale of work going on at Palfrey church once and bef I had just been made apprentice at Wolverhampton and of course I got amongst the, they, when they came the, the Derby day they were all having a bet on it so I, I said to the give them half a crown, so he said you can't have half a crown and he said what do you want it for so I said they're putting it on a horse was on this horse it won, so of course this sale of work was in great progress when I gets off the train at station and thought well I couldn't understand in er Palfrey Church Hall, so she was there in all her finery and I said we've won, we've won she said shut up, shut up she said but erm no I think the biggest character in Caldmore was Father . What do you remember about him? Oh I don't, I just, I remember that er if you walked down er Road at night you'd see him with his mortar board on and his curate by his side coming down to to post the letters, and then when all these ladies were in Sammy shop one night being entertained by Sammy erm Father and his curate went by, and old Sammy turned round to the audience and said well if dressing up will get him anywhere they'll be on the first row in heaven. I was there that night I was, sometimes when I was a little boy I used to go with my mother you know to, for the ent I didn't know whether, yells of laughter used to come out of his shop. I'm trying to explain to you that there was a different atmosphere about it, the whole situation, I know they were hard times, I know that some people had some really rough times but it didn't show very much, and when I come to think of all my parents' friends I don't remember anybody having a wife bashing episode or they all seemed to be very contented with their lot somehow except one, and that was a little bit dicey when I was a little kid, but the man died and the Observer the next week the er obituary notice was put in the paper and underneath they'd got, with Christ which is far better and my father said and they she couldn't have said anything better words Do you remember anything more about Father ? Yes oh I ee I, I'm led to understand that he, he built that church and I'm led to understand that at the same time he started, he came as a curate to St Matthew's and then he came to Street into a house and he had a little, he started a little church down there in a private house and then he built the church. He very wealthy, but oh dear dear he was a, he was a, tyrannical I should call him, I know for a fact that he used to before the choir walked in at night he'd have his watch out in his hand and they'd start at exactly the same time. I remember when he always used to read out during the service before the sermon the previous week's collection and it used to consist of the collection last Sunday consisted of one pensioning note, twenty ha'penny half crown pieces, forty florins and he'd go all through the coinage down to the last ha'penny but erm oh I believe he was, he was er very aristocratic, very aristocratic, but er Father , cos he used to come over our house quite a lot when my mother was on the parochial church council, and er he had a curate that was quite leftish and he got himself on the old Board of Guardians and of course he used to sort of er go into the Labour Club and was quite of er father, he said to old Father one night he said erm he's a funny chap your curate he said well he , he's the son of a farm labourer he says and I'm the son of a country squire and that's the difference. So that was the attitude hey, but erm they'll have me up for libel here. Tell me about some of these other characters around, can you recall anyone? Well old was, was er absolute er you'd never think anybody'd would buy anything out of his shop, er my father went in for something once and he, and he said you can see them hanging up can't you, I mean er salesmanship was on unheard of as far as he was concerned they were there, why ask him if he'd got any, but erm course you must remember I was only a little boy I mean I can remember all this, I took it all in but I wouldn't say that I knew them er I knew Miss , from the grocer's shop she was a Sunday School teacher, and er the Sunday School used to be at Road School we used to have a Sunday School there and a Mr used to take this. He was another character er there was er I remember they used to have a lot of socials and things at the church you know, it was very well attended I suppose in those days. Don't know what it's like now. What about the Conservative Club and the Liberal Club did they, were they more social clubs? Oh yes, er yes they were, they were er of course there was a great divide there I mean between the Liberals I mean they were the only two parties in those days. The Conservative Club was there before the, the Liberal Club. I think if the Liberal Club was only like First World War it wasn't there it hasn't always been there but the Conservative Club was there as long as I can remember. Do you recall any of the activities that were associated with either of them? Did what? Do you recall any of the activities that were associated? Well I was in the tennis club when I was a er they used to have a tennis court at the back. Which club was that? Conservative Club, and my wife she wa we were both members there oh and there was a, I tell you another shop that probably I haven't mentioned, just before you get to the White Hart there was Thompsons the butcher's shop with er they got three or four er daughters I remember. Why do you think there were so many butcher's shops? there was a lot of meat I suppose really I mean erm answer. I mean were there sort of different quality meats being sold all the rest were No difference No of course one or two of them had slaughter houses at the back of them you know. I see I mean er Which were those? Well Tommy used to slaughter all his cattle and er you see my father-in-law's bakehouse and his slaughter house were next to one another an open yard at the back of the shops and er How did the cattle arrive? Oh driven up from the station from the, from the goods yard oh yes. Was that in Street Walsall or ? Yes a long street or somewhere around there, and yes I mean many oh many a time I've, you'd see ca every Wednesday night you'd see the cattle being driven up. Always the same night was it? Yeah, and one got stuck in the, there was an entry between my father-in-law's shop and the next one and one of these cattle ran down the entry and got stuck in the entry, you know it was only narrow and the they had to shoot it, but er oh yes it was a, that was a thing you never hear of today and you never hear of people putting tannin down when people are ill do you? You see Walsall being a leather town there was a lot of this er bark tannin as went and when anyone who was ill so they wouldn't hear the noises of the horse driven vehicles going by they used to, for about fifty yards each side of the house they used to put this stuff in the road to deaden the sound. Do you recall this being done? Oh yes. And what, where did this happen that you remember? Oh I've known it happen all over Caldmore. So it was a regular happening? Oh yes they put this, this tannin down it was like a bark I don't know what it was cos I'm not in the leather trade, I, I don't know much about it except that it was some by-product from the of the er tanning process, and they used to put this stuff down when people were ill. So with you mentioning leather then it leads me onto another question erm was there much done in the way of leather work in the Caldmore area? Oh rather yes, out-work, people used during the First World War there were no end of people were sort of er especially if they'd had a bit of experience in the leather industry like harness and saddlery and that sort of thing, especially the harness and er other work attached to leather cavalry and er revolver holsters and that sort of thing, they'd do them at home you know oh yes there was er now Walsall's divided isn't it? It's got leather and, and iron and steel, now you come onto the Road and you wouldn't think there a leather factory about would you? Because from top to bottom it was all connected with iron and steel the whole lot all the way down. You go from er Hopeworths, Mason and Burnhams, John , Gill and Russells, Walker Brothers it was er a terribly industrial, well you could fi Road used to be all granite sets in the road, there wasn't the, because there was so much traffic went up and down er it was all made of granite sets when I, when I was a kid, but my, shall I tell you what I used to do when I was a kid for my Saturday morning? Well first of all I'd go down Street and up Street West and up to the top of Street and there was some puddling furnaces, the new side iron works and I'd watch those men they'd produce wrought iron and during the process the metal boils up and I'd have to get a big rubbling bar and rubble they'd call rubble into a ball, there's a little wagon put underneath the put under the wagon and off he goes to the steam hammer, now I used to be fascinated with this and Saturday after Saturday I used to go up there and watch one of the heats and as soon as they'd finished doing they used to go into the Forge and Hammer for a drink, I mean it was such hard work so they'd do a heat go up the Forge and Iron and come back and then do another heat when I'd How long would it take to do a heat? Oh I should think it would be the best part of an hour and er then I'd go along Street down into Walker Brothers call in my father's office. Can I go in the rolling mills? I used to go into the rolling mills and watch them rolling steel sheets and over about half an hour there, this was Saturday after Saturday after Saturday I used to do this. I'd come along Road and up Lane into Street to a shop that had got rabbits in the window. I used to walk along there to see these rabbits I think the name was and they, it was a barber's shop that had got these sold all sorts of pet things and that I used to, then I used to come home that was my Saturday morning, but I always used to go in up to the news line. Now the funny thing about it, when I took metallurgy I got, I, I got all this process I knew all about it you know, and er I had it the theory explained to me then, but er I was in the Bell one day about twenty years ago and an old boy came in and I started talking to him and he says, I bet you don't know what I am? I said no I don't, he said well what I was anyway he said I'm retired now. He says you'll never guess. I said well what was it? He says I was a puddler. I said, were you? He said you don't know what that was, that is do you? I said I do a bit, so er he said, well do you know anything about it? I said a bit, and I never let him know, I thought I'll wait a little bit until he go so he says to me, he says I bet you don't know why they put the damper in just before they'd put the, bring the ball out do you? I said yes I do, he says you know? I said course I know I said to put some of the carbons from the smoke back into the, into the er wrought iron, he says how did you find that out? And I told him that er all about it, but I said do they make, do they do this puddling these days, he says yes at West Bromwich they still do it, but er they used to do it up on Do you recall what they used to wear? Moleskin trousers. Were there any protective gear of any kind? No no just the used to wear like a, a pork pie hat. Did he wear anything in par No no no no not that I know of. Did you see them load the furnace? Oh yes they used to put pig sc iron and scrap in it. Pig iron you know er pig iron was what they had I've seen them pouring furnaces pouring it onto the pig beds, and you know when I was a kid when we lived in Caldmore from about half past nine at night all across West Bromwich, Wednesbury all over that area, you'd see the sky light up and it was due to the pouring of er pouring the pig iron. They open up the these blast furnaces and the, we'd all be in the open air and the reflection there used to be quite a reflection in the sky all round there. Did, getting back to Caldmore. Erm were there any small workshops around doing odd things you may recall, sort of small set-ups? No I don't think there were, there might have been one or two, yes I do know one that used to make some form of er something for the saddlery trade and you know those houses opposite the alms houses in Road, there are some alms houses on the one side, then there's some houses that lie up steps on the other side of the road if they're still there. The back of there there used to be one or two people who used to have little outhouses where they used to sort of make things, and my grandfather up the Pleck, he was a good locksmith and he had his shop at the back of the house and he cou he could watch the Walsall races going on, which is now where the Road is, from his workshop before Street was put and any of those and he could stand in his workshop and watch the races. And when would that be? Oh oh in the eighteen nineties I should think eighteen eighties, eighteen nineties. And did he have any men working for him or did he work on his own? Yes he er he had a nephew for part time but he was a now he was a Wolverhampton Grammar School boy. His two brothers both died with smallpox cos one was, they all three went to Wolverhampton Grammar School and they were a Wednesbury family and they died with the smallpox but I thought they were putting the youngest which was my grandfather for the best trai one was going in for law and the other was going in for medicine, and the youngest was go which was the same as engineering is today I suppose, and he went into the gun trade, and I can remember him, he was a grand old chap and er he used to come and bring the springs that he'd made and to temper them he used to throw them in the kitchen fire, and they'd die out and get them all out of the ashes in the morning, and he used to take his week's work in his waistcoat pockets and his day out was to get on the tram at the Brown Lion, and go straight through Wednesbury and right through West Bromwich up to the Constitutional in Birmingham to Greeners or Wembley and Scotts and he'd got these gun locks as he'd made during the week in his waistcoat pockets. They were very small then? Yeah. That's interesting. Yes and er my mother was frightened to death of guns because, oh he was a bit of a boy at heart I mean you can just imagine everybody used to bring the sporting guns to be repaired and there was guns floating about all over the place, and my mother was scared stiff of guns right till the time she died er, and he got mixed up with all these sporting connections you know like go off to shoots and various things and I think he did a bit of cock fighting in his day as well, but I've, I've got the exercise books that his two brothers. Do you want to see them? You can show me? I can show you afterwards aye you can have a look at them and see what you think about them. Erm yes aye that's the Pleck that's not Caldmore you know. Yes yes but very interesting all the same. Yeah oh yes he oh and he was erm being better educated than the majority of people in the Pleck he used to stand outside the Brown Lion to read the newspaper out to them cos they couldn't read, and he attended all the weddings, all the funerals and er made the wills out and he almost was the father confessor for the Pleck, and when the old steam tram came off the lines down in the Pleck, when there was a steam train coming through there, he was the man who put it on the rails again. What was his name? John . Tell me about transport through Caldmore when you were a young man. Do you mean public transport? Well both sorts. Non-existent until about I shouldn't think there was an a bus did come to the bottom of Road, I can't remember what was, it must have been about nineteen twenty I suppose something like that, it used to go to the bottom of Road and turn round there, but I never er my mother always used to say you'd ruin the trade, the trade down well I don't believe it did really er now I think the lack of transport now you've hit something there, lack of transport there encouraged people to shop in Green rather to go down the town cos you could get anything off Green you know, you just think you'd ju you, you smiled about the er butcher's shops, the grocer's shops, the cake shops, you could get the gents , you could get anything on Green the ironmonger shop, you needn't go anywhere else but, when they started transport er yes I think the buses had quite a bit gradually cos things that, you don't think get things happening in this country overnight I mean, they grow on you don't they? I mean you get a bus coming as far as Road and back I don't suppose it has half a dozen folks on what's this thing coming up here, nobody I'd er I've walked into Walsall all my life and but gradually the whole thing changes doesn't it, and then the thing gets off as far as West Bromwich, and in, then, then there's through traffic and then how far and the Green's not big enough to take the turn around up Road then they change the direction, and it's all done on bit by bit by bit and so Green's got eroded it's er So they took bits of Green away then? Oh yes they did for, for the increase in traffic I mean that er that er went on over the years gradually creep, creep, creep on until the whole atmosphere of the place was er I don't know improved should you say or not I don't know whether it's er well it certainly hasn't improved but erm it changed, it was such a lovely little place really, and of course you could run across the road whenever you liked I mean we used to play in Street of picking out in a sweet shop window er a name be Cadbury's or chocolate or something you'd be standing across the road and you'd be running backwards and forwards backwards and forwards, there was no sign of anyone getting run over cos there was nothing about, and when I was a kid going to the Bluecoat School I'd run across that bridge every morning without looking right or left, because if anything had hit me, well nothing used to be coming you could see a tram coming but oh there was nothing else at that time in the morning oh no it was, wouldn't like to run across today. What about private transport in Caldmore about this time, how was, what was that? Do you mean somebody who owned a er some kind of vehicle, tradesmen some of the tradesmen did but not many that I can remember, no I don't think there was too many of them. Would private individuals have their own transport? No no no no there was nobody, now er probably up at the top of Gallway there though one or two would have er stables I should think, one or two of those houses, but by and large no I shouldn't think so. Now there is another, another part it's very nice and that is round Lane and er Road and all round there used to be very nice at one time. Do you know it? Er I can't er Were there any open rural areas? Oh yes. Yes my playground. Go up Road, and from there turn down Follyhouse Lane the continuation of it and you'd come right to the Dales and nothing at all from there to West Bromwich, and you could see, if you go over one stile from one field then onto another and then brook that now runs through the Road there, that used to be a little country brook that run across the golf course and there was a little stile over it, a little bridge and a stile, then you go straight up to Dells common and not a house in sight. Was it open farmland? No , cut straight across it. I mean that's what cut straight the way across that it was, it was all and my aunt she used to live by All Saints West Bromwich, we never used, we never went to see them we used to walk it down the road past the Boars Head onto the Navigation Inn, and up by the Sandlow and she used to live opposite er All Saints Church in West Bromwich, and erm coming back we should come back round midnight you know and er have you ever heard of the Whirly Gang? Yes. Has that come up in your er in your well we were coming back there one night from my aunt's and er there were quite a lot of policemen about and I was only a little boy, it was before the First World War and my father said to one of these policemen, what's happening so, oh we had a tip-off he says that er there's these Whirly Gang folks and in the morning we saw somebody'd been maimed or killed, but er that was another bit of interesting news around, and I remember down in Caldmore one day there used to be some ladies who used to come from, well they used to be, one of them used to call them the salt ladies, they used to come with blocks of salt on a, on a I think they used to come from and I saw a horse there as a kid and I, it had got a long gash right across its body and I said to this lady I said, what's happened to this, she said oh the Whirly Gang and er I was in Paris in nineteen twenty two and er we got to this hotel and there was another Englishman on this trip and he said to me he said where do you come from? I said Walsall he said oh the Whirly Gang You just mentioned these salt ladies coming round. Yeah. Erm tell me a bit about that. Well all the way from, they used to come from and they used to have some sunbonnets on, I always remember they used to have the, I'm not a dressmaker but you know a la they don't like frills down the back that used to hang down the back and the I remember them coming round selling blocks of salt. Horse and cart? Horse and cart and of course milk was never delivered by, in bottles in those days. I mean that was always a milkman used, there used to be er James was one of the milkmen down Palfrey, he used to come . they used to pour it out of a can you know, it's a wonder we didn't all die of tuberculosis but we didn't. Did anyone else come round the streets selling things? Oh yes the watercress man on a Sunday afternoon and er all the various things were s fruiters, fishmongers, all used to bring their stuff round. How did you know they were in the street, did they have a call? Shout, they'd shout something but er well since we've been living up here, my mother used to give, the man used to come for the order for the grocery, the baker used to come round, the milk used to come round, they all used to come round at she'd ha she didn't have go out for heavy loads of stuff to bring in it was all delivered, but when they started some new technique of er of ordering by computer, it's going to come back to square one again you know, they'll be delivering stuff in the same jolly old way hey. Could be yes. Yes don't you think? Could be yes, yes. Give it fifty years and I'll bet you that the baker and all the rest of the folks, it'll be coming from a supermarket, but they'll be delivering stuff that you've put on your computer. That's right that would be interesting. Hey er well, during, just after the war they started these concerts in the Temperance Hall. Now the Temperance Hall was a very very nice hall er balcony all the way around, it held five or six hundred people er candelabras and all the rest of it, a lovely stage and these travelling concert parties used to come round on a Saturday night, and I should imagine they'd be doing the seasides during the summer and then they came back in the Walsall and various areas during the er winter months, and we used to get concert parties like The Roosters and The Bonbons and all those sort of people come along and they were real and of course fellas my age, I mean eighteen and nine we used to take our girls there I mean it was full of young people er you'd perhaps have been to the pictures one night and it's another way of entertaining really and it was really a first class entertainment. Well my pal and myself we took these two girls and we sat in the middle of the Temperance Hall and he said come on let's sit over on the balcony he says and put up my clothes by the radiator he says it's been raining he says and it will dry them, so we moved, and exactly from were we moved was where the women got killed, just candelabra dropped on her and er when it happened the fella on the stage the comedian was singing, a hundred years from now you won't be here, and I won't be here and from the corner of my eye I could see something gradually dropping like one of these candelabras and I thought hello that's part of the act you know, it was just gradually coming down and all of a sudden, whooosh and the roof came straight in oh and I don't know sure I'd I, everything went dark of course I mean it was all in blacked-out all the chairs were loose, so as the folks wended their way towards the exit doors they took the chairs with them, so they politely threw them back in the crowd that stood in the hall so you were dodging chairs as well as trying to get out, where we were, where we were seated the firemen were hacking at the windows thinking that it was a fire because all the dust had gone up in the air and the reflection of the light from the market I suppose and that would give the appearance of smoke, and he was, I said to this fireman I said there's no fire, he says, he says there is I said there's no fire in here, anyway we eventually got out but I took these girls back home to and I really, it was, properly unnerved us both and as we came on that old tram we were, we thought you know everything seemed to sort of upset us and when I got far more upset on the Sunday morning when I went to have a look at it, the whole roof had come right in, but there were fifty people got injured you know and about, oh there was one lady killed. I knew one of the girls and er she never got right properly again. She got injured in her back somewhere, but er it was national news, I mean it was in The Mirror and all the papers and it became a, for a day or two it was er it was in everywhere, and the theory is that er it was this erm very very dry summer and a very very wet autumn and a bit of dry rot in the timbers somewhere, but it was it was another How long did it actually take you to get out of there? Oh, half an hour. Quite a time really? Yeah, yeah, oh yes of course a lot of the people were, that were in the we were in under the balcony but they were up to their knees in plaster and goodness knows what that had come out of the roof they couldn't move it all dropped round them. So they had to wait to be dug out did they? Yes I've Good gracious, was anyone trying to organize the ? Well you can't in the dark can you really? You can't really, you see we came out into a side door into the old square. I don't know what happened to the front entrance, but there was a basement underneath there and my first wife was dancing in Harvey Martin's dance hall underneath, her pal and herself she, they'd gone to this dance it was a dancing lesson on a Saturday night it was famous in those days Harvey Martin's dance class er yes I Was, was there any damage down ? No no no. In the basement, it was just on the Just on the top yeah on the top of it That's about all I can tell you about that, but er it makes you wonder whether I hadn't better keep out of Street, doesn't it? Ken, welcome back. Could you introduce er the people, your team, particularly as I think one of them has a different name to the label in front of them. Yes, I'm afraid Mike Kirkham has been delayed in Prague for today, so Nigel Spackman, who's a member of our Committee and is a deferred pensioner is taking his place and Les Taylor is the Secretary of our Maxwell Pension Action Group. And you are Ken Trench? I am Ken Trench, I am the Chairman of the Group. Ken, we've you've given us er er er a document in re response to er the Good Committee and your views and so on. We've got a number of questions we want to ask you, because er though you're pivotal to all of our erm activities in this enquiry, we are also looking to a report which is hopefully going to be influenced the Bill the Government brings forward. So we will er if we may er not ask you to introduce your document we we'd like to get on with the questioning. If at the end you feel there are points we haven't covered and I forget to invite you, would you say you would like to make a concluding statement. Yes, by all means. Very good. Jimmy? Well Ken, obviously everybody was abhorred regarding this national scandal of the the Maxwell er pension fraud that er the Committee who were making enquiries obviously were implementing the fact that we should have a report and Goodey was set up and the recommendations that have been laid down as far as Goodey is concerned in order to strengthen the pension scheme so that these frauds can happen again, now have you read the report? Yeah, I've read I don't think I've read every thousand pages of it, but I've, I've I've done quite a lot of of it yes. Mm, having read the report and possibly being on the end of the complaints from the pensioners in the Maxwell fraud er what was your view regarding the proposals that are being made? Well, we feel that there's it's obviously quite a lot of points that are, are very good in the report, but we really feel that it's concentrated very much on the administration of pension schemes, rather than security and I think that whilst if everything that, everyone of his recommendations had been law, I think it would have made it more difficult for Maxwell, but I don't think it would have made in impossible for Maxwell and I think that what th what we see the problem is, is that in many ways the, the Maxwell problem was brought about by two major, major factors I think. One was the failure of the self- regulatory body I M R O and the second one was really the fact that he was able to change his financial year end from April ninety-one to December ninety-one and during that period he was able to do things with those erm those funds in his accounts and er and really there was, there was no check on that, and I don't see that the that was in er Good would have changed much of that situation at that end. It would have made it more difficult, but the way that Maxwell used to involve himself in bulk transfers, you know and move, move two hundred pensioners from there to there and er no money followed and this sort of thing, I think that er that he could of quite frankly done exactly the same thing and we really feel that the, that the role of the pension regulator and the and the opposing role with I M R O that, that you really if we're not careful, we're going to put in another layer of bureaucracy and have a pension regulator who's got the task of of checking a, a hundred and twenty eight thousand pension funds, when really there's probably out of those a hundred and twenty eight thousand, ninety-nine point five per cent of probably being very well well run and, and quite safe and what, what we can't really see in the report is a is a method of identifying the determined fraudster at a at a very early stage, you know and we're just terribly disappointed that er that Good has just thrown the whole of, of the matter back at I M R O who we feel have proved to tha that I don't think they're up to the task, I think that the that the whole question of er of the power of a self regulatory body which to us works on blowing the whistle, you know the whole the whole effect of a self regulatory body is that it's members that it, it's really like a club isn't it, you know and we're all members of this club and if one of us er is gonna do something wrong, then the rest of us are gonna have to pay for it. Well, in the in the question of I M R O as far as it's erm occupational pension scheme members are concerned, er there's no there's no compensation responsibility and I think that that means that you get no, no whistle blowing and in I mean there's, we've got, I mean one of the points that we, we heard of just last evening was that one of the of the banks involved ended up er in its arrangements with Maxwell of asking for a hundred and sixty per cent of shares for every hundred per cent of loans that it made to Maxwell. Now to me that means that that, that city organisation must have been very doubtful about the whole future of the Maxwell organisation when it was getting to that stage, and if one looks through the, through the Writs, you know which now, now number about the same number of pages as the as the Good Report, you know you will get an er a feeling of what Maxwell was doing and how that was all all being happened and with leaving all of that with I M R O we just don't think it's going to er er we don't think it would have saved the position. Ken? Well I think if I M R O I think if I M R O members had had a compen a compensation responsibility or er then I feel that the members would have would have would have allowed certain things to happen. I mean when one starts to, to scratch the surface, let me just give one example I mean we feel er I M R O fails on on its membership I mean the fact that you had Bishopsgate Investment Management which was the beneficial owner was an organisation in Liechtenstein. Now I M R O asked er we understand for the be the management of that organisation to give accounts for that for the c for the senior company to I M R O prior to its membership about a I think was about eight working days before I M R O approved that membership. We we've asked I M R O if they actually got those accounts and what they learnt from the er from the Liechtenstein company and they've told us they can't, they can't tell us it's er it's private correspondence. Can we actually pause there cos you've done a good bit of digging on that one. Er David Shaw on this very I come back to you Ken erm y you've asked some questions, I've actually seen the I M R O letter and can I say that there are two questions in the I M R O letter to Mr Maxwell and Bishopsgate, which quite categorically asked for accounts and also details of the ownership structure coming out of Liechtenstein. I haven't seen the re final reply that went from er the Maxwell organisation to er I M R O but I did see a draft reply. The draft reply contained one threat to report I M R O to the Securities and Investment Board for excessive enquiries er and for an unreasonable attitude and the other er bit of the reply was effectively a form of covering up presenting full financial information and disclosure to I M R O. Those replies were drafted by people inside the Maxwell appraised by, who will appraise them then? Well if it it'll be Julie, Neil or Alison. Right. Just one? Were any of the adult careers officers including the Harrogate one?actually fitting them in you see. I c er I can't remember. No. Er Deborah did a sheet with everybody on, who was going to be appraising who. But I can't think, what she said about the adult team. I mean the b with the training but I mean Yeah. they weren't Well I mean she No I don't know no. But I imagine it'll all be people on that list who were involved in training, I can't remember. Cos if it was as long as three hours, then I'd expect Julie would have had to program them in for it wouldn't she . Mm. Although I did ask Deborah to include . Oh well perhaps she did then. I'm sure she would. Mm. Okay? Anything else that's missing? Can I just go over the page onto the number six, that says what we've already done. Where it's already got A C G just after, is that the C O C T one, Jayne or just a careers officer one? That's just careers officers. There's a separate one for career's teachers. If you remember it means Yeah. paper. I haven't seen anything sent out about that careers I've got it with me. teacher one. Has it gone now? Oh the caree Has i has Jim sent it out do you know? I don't know, I sent in to him. Yeah I know you said. Cos I haven't done anything with it, cos you said you'd send it him, and I couldn't decide whether I was supposed to send it ahead or he was . No it was going in the book. He said it was going in the level two book . Ah Right. I've got the information about the C Os one, today. So you Right. can send it out. Right okay. Erm We're seeing Jim a week on Tuesday aren't we? Well we were. Oh. Unless we can shift it up here. Because I know have to go to Dorothy 's provincial council. Regraded, as the expert witness. Let's let's get Cath up. Let's get Cath up and erm we'll er Where did you think it was then, Allen, that meeting? York. Oh did you? Oh right. if that had've been Cath, that would have been a real turn up for me wouldn't it? Can I borrow a tap a minute,. Okay, smashing. Thanks. You don't know the trouble we've had actually getting this. This coffee. I though the Bird's Eye coffee . I think it broke the filter. Morning Cath. Morning. Morning. Liz has got some stuff for you. Hang on. Oh right. That's what I'm just looking for, hang on. One of the things Cath's working on, for us, is the training records system. Erm h how's that getting on Cath? Training records? Erm halfway. Which half? The top half or the bottom half? Well er I don't like to say, I don't really know. Erm maybe about three quarters. Computer writing it? Yes it's going on to to word processor. Yes Mhm. yeah. Yeah it's a slow job . Er let me just check So is that is that last year's training? For all the years. From when anybody started, the training goes right through up till the last bit of training they've done . Right. So it isn't really an upgrade Yes yes At the moment it's er But you don't have it? I don't but it's lying it must be lying on my desk . Very time-consuming. Dorothy could perhaps fax it up, cos I I had it typed out yesterday so we could, do it. Shall I do that? Shall I give her a ring and ask her to fax it ? Well Cath could do it. What's that. Could you fa could you ring Dorothy. Yes. On top of my desk there's a ha there's one of these. One of these, inside it, it says, To go out to go out To go out today. And it's it's about the C Os C E D software training. Oh right . And there's three pages. And you want it faxing back here? Yeah. Right okay. I bet it's not there. Sorry. Mm. It's alright. Right so maybe, before we go any farther, with this er if we just, just before we do that. There's nothing else to add. The paper that went to er C C S M T, erm was really a similar one but just partly with a bit more erm details. And where we were with investors in people. Erm so that we may well have to link in to the training programme and go back and check, for instance in three where I've talked about the business plans. Have we actually got any training for those nine points there, that say, you know, Are we doing something on produ I know the product specification's developing. But do we Yeah. need any training for that? Do we need any training on consumer evaluation? Do we need any training on erm If we change the line management of the adult's team, do we need any training on next? Picking up after T two M. Erm anything on career's libraries, and anything on reviewing the C E G framework document. So we'll have to I think keep going back to these throughout the year and saying, Are we erm are we doing it I mean some of those some of those are already done aren't they. I mean the marketing our guidance, is the product specification one. That's on the list, already. Where's that? Marketing our guidance. I think that relates to Oh right. the product specification. And Yeah. there is evaluation plan for this year is meeting on the fifteenth of September, so for C Os there's some work on consumer evaluation. In sc with s the school. Clients. That school and college clients. But perhaps not with the other groups there. Yeah. The next one, it really depends what changes we make, but any changes will potentially have training implications won't they so Mm. That's right. Next we could probably I mean Deborah's looking after that one isn't she. Yes. there there's been a She asked us to do something in relation to employer awareness campaign. Yeah. You could describe as training. Did you do anything on your marketing, employer awareness er On that, No. Mm. Is that worth repeating, that course do you think? Oh I think it is. Yeah. It seemed to go down very well. Yeah. If you can afford another four hundred pounds or whatever it was. You were on that were you . Yes it was really good. I thought it was useful. Don't let's go there again though, cos I spent all day making coffee. You won't get Bill there again. You won't get Bill there again no. Why what happened to him? He got his car stolen. He got his car stolen. Got his car nicked, from . It made the news local news actually that Did it? I h well not h personally Bill's robbed car was used in a robbery. But the actual erm carry on they'd had with it. Yeah. Apparently was on the local news Cos they had a bit of a chase or something didn't they ? Mm. Yeah they they used it to get away. Why did they choose Bill's car I wonder? As in It's probably old No it's not no it's a erm Vauxhall Astra. Or Belmont or whatever. Yeah It's quite it's not that old. It was a leased car so it's only a couple of years old . Oh it's a lease car is it? It's not he'd just bought it . Oh it's not a lease car. Mm. Just changed from a leased t Anyway we'll have to, I think, revisit those nine points as w as we go on because that's Yeah. part of the the thing. Obviously then we need to pick up the appraisal system, and I think what I'll have to do with that, is as the targets kep co start coming in, erm we'll have to set up some sort of system, preferably I suspect computerized. That will actually I'll be able to put the targets, or the ideas of the targets onto computer, and pick up any trailing training from that. Do you Will you get the training from the targets though, because certainly from I mean onl only talking about two appraisals so far Mm. that we've actually talked about training needs as part of the Mm. appraisal. But that's not really what the targets are focused on . Very true. Mm. Mm. The fac targets are focused on things that are within that own persons control, that they can do something about themselves, straight away. Without any sort of training implications really. Mm. Mm. I don't know. But anyway the idea we have to fix up some sort of system that picks up the the targets from that. Yes maybe. Mm. Erm Going through that four. Erm the document we're gonna look at in a minute, talks about training entitlement, so we can maybe, maybe pick that up. We s talked to Cath a minute or go about the full training record system. Erm that should mean that everybody'll get a a copy of their own team's entitlement. Whether you I mean a the problem with that is keeping it up to date on Mm. to u on more than an annual basis from this end. Erm but you know we'll we'll obviously try and do that. Erm four point five talks about I mean we talked about everybody charging all over the country doing various visits. Four point five. And the competence checklists came from that training course I was on, that's saying everybody,as well as having a job description, you've got to have a competence ch checklist, for that that er helps you to develop the training for the job, depending on the competencies you need. And that's gonna be a a bit of a er challenge I think. But we obviously have to do it, just for the the levels of job. Erm so we've maybe got a dozen to do for the service, and I'll have to look at that and and go from there. And then when we had the brainstorm, as I said. And then the cost benefit, evidence of need, I I drew out a f a paper. Erm on the back I think for each course we'll we'll have to try and fill in. But again that's I noticed erm looking through the particular about the organization er sheet, is actually there's something in there about that as well. So maybe if we could just flick through this, before we go on and start to to pick days and who's gonna do what. From that. That's right Investment in People limited. In conjunction with Heart of England Training and Enterprise Council. .No it's this one isn't it. Okay. Now one of the things I think we need to do, And I I I put it in there and it's pa it's part of my appraisal system, is to do some work on actually entitlements to training. For people. And do we say to everybody who's in the organization, erm, You are entitled to X amount of training each year. Somebody was telling me that. Thanks Anne. Somebody was telling me that erm some careers service It was Steve I was talking to in the car the other night. Some careers services er they have twenty days entitlement to training each year. Staffordshire. He was saying, they're entitled to twenty days training each year. I think until I actually get the records system up and running, and do a check on how much our people are doing, erm it's difficult to say what our, if we have an entitlement, what it is. And I think it's a fairly you know, suck it and see. Mm. Stick your stick your finger in there, see which way the wind blows . Is that twenty days pro rata? Well yes. I mean th this is the problem with part Well probably yeah. time staff. Because erm They need as much training. Yeah. They need as much training to do the job effectively. If they only have ten days, that's er not very much. Mm there's also the fact that some people need If you include more training than others isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know whether I like this word, entitlement anyway. Oh I'll go and tell the boss he can Oh Jayne put it in my appraisal. I don't I mean it's sort of like you know, everybody has a right to this. Well I don't think anybody has a right to anything in particular. Are we trying to get I know I know I I know and I appreciate that's it's a you know maybe a bit of a controversial view, but I I I think entitlement's a bit of a Well strong word. i i perhaps in terms of if you think of it in terms of like the employer of the day, Well we've paid an external trainer to come along, it's actually costing us quite a lot of money. There's all the additional costs in terms of people's salaries and travelling expenses Mm. and so on. I can understand that obviously we've got to be cautious about that sort of thing. But in terms of induction training, to make sure someone can actually do their job , Yes yeah. I think they're entitled to to things like that. Yes. Yes. But maybe not entitles Cos I think we've got a responsibility to make sure that we give people Mm. the support and training they need . But that that's because it fits into what we want people to be able to achieve. I it means that we're making people. Erm we're giving them the appropriate and suitable skills to be able to do their job . Yeah. Yeah. But I don't see that as being the same as an entitle But that's what all training should be really isn't it. I mean all training should be towards the aims of achieving the business plans . I think it's the word I'm unhappy with Sue. I'm not I'm not sa ent yeah entitlement. Ah it's not someth you know, it's not s something that I'm prepared to stick my neck out and say, Look you know, I I don't think that word ought to appear anywhere. It's just it's just a a view that's all . Mm. I think it's from the organization's point of view, from our statement of purpose, business plan, yeah, we do want people to achieve certain things, and therefore we provide them with the training to be able to do that. But looking at it from the other point, that's the you know the word entitlement comes from you know, I I think I'm entitled to twenty days' training, but whether I need twenty days' training to be Yeah. able to do my job, I might need thirty days' training . Mm. It's just just the word that's all . I thought you were gonna say, It's it's derived from the Latin I think what what you're really saying though, is that it's probably a mistake to actually look at it in terms of a number of days. And I think that's a very good point, because you're actually i the what you've actually said is, You're entitled to training to enable you to do you job competently. And I Do your job. Yeah. think that's much more sensible approach. Yeah. I suppose there's a certain amount of personal investment as well. You know I might want to do some training which is n doesn't necess Mm. isn't necessary for me to do my job, but because I have a personal interest . Mm. And I think sent me on that course you know. Yeah. But erm i it's I I think it's the word entitlement, the fact that it's anybody's right to have this Right. or to have Mm. that. I think it's a bit strong. A and and to say twenty days when somebody might need much more than that, somebody might need Mm. less because it's the type of job that they're doing. You know, Mm. such as f er for example a word processor clerk or may not saying, may not necessarily need so much training as But doesn't doesn't it often work out though that the people who erm need more training, often are the ones that have resisted going on training in the past . Oh well that's up I think that's up to us because it fits in with in our aims and objectives. You say, Yeah. You need this training to do your job . Mm. Yeah. S I mean t y you see, what you could work more towards is almost a sort of an agreement wi with individuals isn't it ? Mm. Mm. And although you know whether we use the word entitlement or not, it could Mm. actually work both ways. Cos I I can understand if we didn't handle it carefully, it could mean people would be more demanding and say, I'm entitled to go on this training . Mm mm. Whereas if we're very careful about how we put the message across, it could actually do the opposite in that, people see that they're entitled to a certain basic level if you like, to enable them to Yes. And every time they put themselves forward to go on to a tra on a training course, they've actually got to think through, and maybe justify to their line manager, Mm. Erm this im this training day is gonna help me be better at my job, in this, this and this respects. Or your line managers I think can say to the individual, This training course is gonna help you do your job better in this, this Because and this respect. And then that can be reviewed afterwards and so on. Mhm. Mhm. So it could be helpful if it's Mm. handled properly. Yeah. Mm. And I think that it is it would be a mistake to look at in terms of a certain set number of days. Cos it will One one thing that personally And also what's available in the year. Yeah. I mean it might be one year you want Yeah. thirty days training and then the next the next year ten Yeah. I find that people tend to not put themselves down for training courses. I don't know if this is the same in other places. But erm careers officers particularly put themselves down for visits, to Mm. colleges and you know, different places. And and the visits seem to be more popular, and often quite a few careers officers will put their names down for that. And I think in terms of justifying that, if we had that you know, if you're saying people have to justify why they're going, I think they'd all more or less say the same. You know, that often sort of getting some first hand information is the Mm. best thing to you know, boost your You know how then how do you decide that And a one person needs it more than another. And anot in a careers officer's view the other day, that seeing as though they'd worked there twenty years ago, they wanted to go back and see how it had changed. Mm. Mm. As a reason for going. Yeah. I mean I think that in terms of visits They could have thought up something better than that couldn't they ? I think in terms of visits, that er an entitlement might work, with visits for careers Yeah. Mm. officers , but I think in terms of other kinds of training courses, that they're slightly different. And more an individual basis. I mean technically we do have an entitlement to visits in that Janet was was reminding me the other day that that we said, when Deborah was here, that everybody was entitled to four visits a year. Erm two to H E I didn't realize this, two to H E, two to F E. And I think that was on the basis that we were insisting that everybody visited the local F E college or you know sort of Yorkshire, Scarborough, Harrogate got got their irregular updatings and S and Selby when whatever. But that that we took the view that you know people were entitled to go to an H E institution, and and keep up to date with what was happening there every year. Erm I mean I I have some concerns, like Cynthia, about the number of careers officers who suddenly appear when you say there's a visit to, Hull University, and we've got people coming from all over the county and it's costing us a fortune. What But you say something like, the employer marketing to employers, and certainly the the employment officers We had quite a number on that course didn't we. It was mix like Erm it was a mix yeah it was a sort of erm a half and half. Was it? mm. Yeah yeah. I know the first lot of bits I got in were all employment officers and I was thinking, Hang on a minute where's There were a number of careers officers I though that it was really Yeah. Was a bit mainly Particularly aimed at employment officers cos that was where the lack of confidence was coming from . Yeah. In the original request. I think it was I think it was really Yeah. Sue yeah. Mm. Had an interesting discussion at a staff meeting on Wednesday though. Some const constructive criticisms to help us rationalize the college visits. They were Mhm. actually saying there should be less visits. Mm. Fine. And that m some colleges didn't need visiting every year. Mm. And s some suggestions that I said I'd put forward to Janet about streamlining nominations and so on. Oh God. Can I just just just move on cos I think the first thing we're gonna pick up on this is this entitlement business again. So if we look at module objectives. Which is sort of the the first page in. Second page in, keep going, keep going. Mm that's it. Right. Right I mean this tells you what the You've past it Jayne. I can't find it either. The first page . Front page. It's just before unit one. That's it. Left hand page down. Oh there. Right I've got it. Right. Mm. I mean this talks about what this particular booklet does, and and why we're saying, it would have been useful to have had this probably for our last meeting really. But erm it doesn't really matter. So this talks about putting together the comprehensive training and development policy, and training plan, that we need to get to get I I P to demonstrate. And it talks about writing measurable objectives for all training events. Something I don't think we particularly do. Erm and introducing regular training and development planning throughout the organization. Which is is what we said was one of the key key areas we need to do for I I P. And then defining the business benefit for all training events. There is one there is another one on evaluation that I think, erm I'll give to Ray because he's doing that evaluation thing He's doing that now. Yes. and then get him to Mm. take us through that the next time we have a Mm. a group to get together. Which I suggest is after that workshop. Sometime if we can spare half a day. Erm sometime in July Erm is it May the nex May the next one ? I I The one he's going on to that I can't go, it's the third week in July. Oh right so maybe plan the meet again after that. Or . Okay so the first bit then is actually the the policy. And they talk about, on page module three, unit one point five. There. Actually writing out to our members of staff and saying, This is the policy that we will have. So you know, saying, We s fully support the policy that erm the line manager's gotta resp share responsibility with the individual. Taking Sue's point, all new staff get the induction programme. Erm we're linking with the relevant staff association, erm just some general er points about how we identify and evaluate erm and put together the training plan, And and settling once and for all about the national recognized qualification. Saying what we'll do for that. And then over the page it actually then, puts through gives us the quite nicely, erm a document that we could use just to send out and and do. If we wanted to pick this up and said, This was an idea. Now I've actually done this in the past. If you remember a couple of years ago. Er three or four years ago for two or three years. I actually put out a quite a thick document that I think could be classed as a a Mm. training and development policy. But we haven't done it for the past eighteen months. It was good. And it it strikes me that this is er a starting point. For the beginning of that document almost. Now what it actually says, I think Jayne, in the erm No it doesn't. No er. We if you go to back to that first page, under induction it says, A training has a mandatory contact Yeah. content, but it can be expended extended to meet special needs. Why what does that mean? Well I think it basically means everybody does does wha we've asked them to do, which is the work shadowing content of the first week. And after that if you've got special en Oh but if you've got special entitlement . Okay. Sorry what page are you on now. Well I've just I've just quickly gone through it and said, the the documents that are blue in this this copy, Black in Black in most of them. Actually give you something that we If we decided to to put out to our members of staff, seems to actually cover the erm the needs of er the I I P. Can I just ask about the evaluation. Are you saying that that's in this next workshop? Yeah. Is that the thing that's in the next workshop? Yeah. So we don't really need to consider that at this stage . Yeah. Do we want a five minute break. Yeah shall we have another coffee? Good idea. Yeah. That's what we'll d to try and finish for half past twelve if we can. Fine. Cos we've got this thing after that What time is that? Well Ray's coming about half eleven he said. So he'll be joining Oh is he? this and then we can pick up. Erm Good, cos I'd quite like to be off for Well half past three. I'm thinking we at the latest we can Great. Brilliant. finish if if possible before that. And they don't the T Q M stuff'll be er I don't know what we're gonna do with that. Right. So we've got the I think that to to fulfil I I P requirements, we've gotta put out some it would be useful to put out something like a training and and development policy. We'll have to look again, it's interesting with the nationally recognized qualifications and records for life bit, that we already do some of this. But it actually formalizes I think saying that you know, We'll we'll give so much funding where they're wholly related to the business, and then whatever. We've said in the past it's been fifty percent full stop. For those people who bothered to get in touch with me. Mm. So you've had some haven't you for seven three six O or something. Did you not get that Did you not? Oh right. No. Anyway we're back we paid everything from Open University to word processing courses over mine. Oh well they don't do advanced degrees. No that's too advanced Cynthia. But we don't If you're that advanced you have to pay for yourself. Mm. the support as well I'm thinking of something like Mary's P G C E, that Alison's her sort of mentor for that , Yeah. and she's doing other things through work that you know, I'm I mean it in theory it's sort of giving some support to. Well more than in theory I suppose . Because she's using her work as evidence for for getting through Yeah. Yeah. and so on. I want this in for when me and Jayne do this management training at er at Grammar School. This year it's it's gonna be a two hundred percent funding cut. For me. A hundred percent funding for more than fifty percent of the day you know. So I mean I I I am suggesting that this appears to be a ready made useful document that that forms part of a at the right time, we put this out to back up the the rest of the er the document. It maybe maybe might be appropriate Jayne to go to the next staff staff consultative committee as the the next er Unless I can manage to be off sick again. Yeah you managed that Yeah it was quite pleasant. Thank you very much. It was quite a nice meeting actually. And you you did discuss libraries. In that didn't you? Very briefly they did in the end cos everybody else m jumped on the band wagon. Yeah. So you shouldn't feel alone in that. But they'd had a pre-meeting when they'd tried to drop it out. Yeah. Erm Joyce I think had had tried to drop out the things that were only relevant to individual officers out . Mhm. And erm but then they'd all Margaret and erm everybody had jumped on the bandwagon and said,. So it'll come up at the next C S N T . Yeah. Deborah did actually say to me, she thought that Harrogate might feel I think it's to do with priorities for the Yeah. librarians isn't it. Yeah. So I've just made a note, the next C S N T, I'll in the report back from the staff consultative committee, there's two or three things we need Yeah. to pick up. We need to pick be clear about the erm allocation of time for librarians, for the careers guidance agreements as well. Mm. That was mentioned. The other day wasn't it That's right. Yeah about time you got skills to pay really isn't it? Funny enough there's a course just coming downstairs about schools. How w how organizations can identify what schools will pay for. Mm. Mm. I've just put it to the boss to see if he's er Mm. thinks we ought to go . Anyway so that's the first stage of that. I think we we need to actually go back to erm or develop the stage one thing and and increase what we've done. Unit two talks about training objectives. And I know one of the things I picked up off the course was it? No. No. No. No. Erm one of the things I picked up off the course is, technically every training course that we have, should be written in a way that that identifies erm Unit two point four I'm on to at the minute.. Nearly there. The erm actually says that every training course should have some sort of objectives and performance and standards and and measurable objective that presumably we can then pick up in evaluation. What was That's an area that I'm a bit unclear about. Yeah. Are we suppose Yeah. Mm. Are we supposed to be using the pre-course questionnaires that I've seen a couple of times, on all course? Well eventually I think we'll have to get to that to that standard. Erm er I mean er technically it should be something that's done centrally. And I'm trying to I've tried without success. And I'll I'll probably have to look at a you know s Cath and I have to sit down and say, Look for every course, this needs to happen. There needs to be a Mm. pre-course questionnaire goes out. Whoever's running the course needs to fill in this particular form . Mm. Mm. For you to then add the rest of it, Mm. and then after the course there's gotta be a post-evaluation form fed out. You know the the the Mm. line manager does an evaluation on the day, but then back at base we do an evaluation for the the line manager. I've just made a note for the employer's thing Jayne. Yeah. To send out er a form to each member of staff, so they go and talk to their line manager about it and share what's gone on. Erm and try and get Cath to do that for every course. Mhm. That's Erm that's what I was thinking because Mm. in terms of the evaluation that we already do, it tends to be about the course itself. The sort of content Mm. as it with a view to actually altering the course next time . Yes. Erm But we don't actually do anything to I mean sometimes you get comments about the way that it's helped people. Mm. But it's not exactly measurable even then. No. So I mean technically I think, what you're supposed to be with every course . Erm is almost to go back so that I don't know who's on the course but Jayne's course for example, Clare. Clare, erm would go back to the office, you you or Phyllis or Joyce I mean preferably Phyllis would sit down with her and say, Right, Clare, what have you learned? Blah-de-blah-de-blah. In six months later or three months later would then diary date to say, come back again. Alright what have you done, in the least three months, that says that you've used the course, benefited from the course, that sort of thing. Now I think we do that irregularly. Mm. One might one might say one might say rarely. that with Mm. all the courses that that Yeah. that we do and the courses that everybody goes on, I mean you'd you you'd just be spending all your time sort of Evaluating everybody. checking up on people and evaluating Well that's why I say, I don't think it has to always be, Sue, No mm. me, Cynthia. I it's got to be you know somebody within the organization . Admin assistants for for employment staff. You know, seniors for whatever the A D Ms, and yourself and you share the depending on what the course is, you would share the load out. If every course er made such an impression as that one the other day we'd be Well that's right I mean I I think it's like a lot of things isn't it? It it seems a n and this when I saw this, I thought, Oh my God, you know, the I I P gets bigger every time I look at something Mhm. different. Erm but I I suppose once it gets embedded in the system, it's maybe not so bad. I mean were we talking about you know, I suppose a quick five minutes feedback but then you know, five minutes in three months time. Cos the key thing with Clare is, she's don she's obviously gone back doing a lot, but who's gonna follow it up in three months time, to see Mhm. what's got embedded. Yeah. In the system? Yeah and and Yeah. It's a cultural thing isn't it really? Getting people to change their approach and expect that with training, expect to have to analyze what they what they thought they're going to get out of it, why they should be doing it. Mhm. That's right. And I don't think we do it so much with the erm careers service training, but with the careers teachers often we've got them doing action plans and things Mhm. at the end. And you get the feeling that they'll sort of go back to school and college or wherever Mm. Nobody'll actually sit down with them and go through it or review it Mm. at a later date. We also tend to write objectives more for those course. At least we did for the longer Yeah. courses didn't we. And presented those at the beginning. That's right. Which you tend not to do so much for the shorter ones. Which is what this is all about really trying Mhm. to to say to people, If you're coming on the course this is what you're going to get. Talk to your manager about personally and and you know corporate objectives and and go from there. So I think that's something that we we're going to have to. And it may well be that that we'll have to you know make sure everybody who's running a training course, gets this particular and and tries to fit in Mm. with it. With regard to action plans, one course I went on, I think it was with Theresa, ad er it was Adrian Is it Adrian ?name. The one with I know who you mean yeah. Bruce's men. And er we all had to do an action plan at the end of the course, and then three months later Mm. the action plan was actually sent to you in the post . Mm. Yeah. Yeah. You know with the idea that you sort of should look at your action plan and say , Yeah. Mhm. Well have I done this? What have I got to do Yeah. now? sort of thing. I think that ha has to be in on if you're on a slightly longer course than that a day you Mhm. know. Yeah. But I I remember that happening Yes cos Theresa's was two days. it it was it was really good. It made you think. It made you think didn't it? Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. So I mean I think we've got to go into this for all the course. Erm and then er you you know using this particular this particular module. Perhaps we should decide that it's a high priority to actually do a proper job, like this. And therefore be slightly less ambitious about the numbering range of courses we're going to run. We're more likely to achieve this Well if we are slightly less ambitious . Yeah. I think the only other way of doing it isn't it is to say we won't do it for every course initially. We'll we'll give it a go and we'll Mm. you know, some Mm. whoever's you know whoever's running the next Yeah. Yeah. the the careers course Yeah. for for the Yeah. erm software one which which could possibly have You know, we'll ask Liz or Yeah. we'll ask Liz to do it, and give it a go and then talk through it. And then Or we'll we'll say if we get a facilitator in, I don't see why we shouldn't ask Graham. Mm. You know it would be interesting to get Graham, when he does the next T Q M thing, to do it. So I agree it it may well be a pain in the neck, but it it may not fall No but it will be. Obviously Obviously interpreted your er But I think we'll have to work towards that and I I agree Sue I think there's two ways either saying, you know, we don we do it for everything, or Mm. which I think is a lot to answer for w we do one Mm. or two and have a look at it. And see how easy it is. I mean the idea of course is to try at some stage and run a trainer trainer's course, so that we expand the number of people who can who can do the training. Which we've got . You know the fur the further we get away from the trainers course, the less inclined I feel to be able to do it . But. But Su are you going on this one ? I'm supposed to be. Yes. I've not Oh jolly good Sue'll be the most up to date one. November you said. Now I Yeah, that's right, November. Cos there was one in July and I suspected it would clash with holidays, which it probably does, so the November one I'm trying for. I'll ring them up and see if they've got any places left. Well Cath can do it for you. I've got the booklet with me actually. Will you let me go again on the basis I made a cock-up the first time round . Mm. Erm When we we but we already do quite a lot of this anyway. I mean the whole Yeah. thing about objectives. I mean you you can't run a course I always try to write objectives. No. But I I think the things is isn't it, to a certain extent with the I I P it's formalizing it ? Mm. And it I think the evidence And having and having a procedure and a policy. And it's the evidence that a you've got to produce to say that I've got to demonstrate that the training that we do has objectives, so that they can go back and say to Cynthia, you went on that course in whatever, what were the objectives for it? Mm. Can you identify why you went? What were the objectives? What did you learn? How was it The next section goes on to analysis section three I think. Unit three. Yeah. Mm. Unit three. Module three, unit three. Have you got it? Sue? Yeah. I'll speak to Cath before she Yeah yeah. goes and see if she This goes on to measuring erm training needs analysis. Now is you remember last time we said we wouldn't do this at the minute because we erm we've got erm a It's appraisal. checklist. But it it goes into picking it out of er I and I think maybe when we do decide to do another training needs analysis. After we've got We said we'd get the appraisal system up and running didn't we. Yeah. Mm. Er We'd do that with that. So unit four talks about how to plan erm how to plan it which is where we're at at the minute. Really and the type of documentation that they're that they're on about. Actually can I digress back Yeah. to er the training objectives. What page? What's your page ? Er module three, unit two dot thirteen. And there it's got about erm measurable objectives and it's saying, Ensure all managers can write measurable training objectives. Organize a workshop or training session if necessary. So I'm wondering if we need to have that in the training programme . Well I think As a sort of starting point after Yeah. the workshop, you know, th next I I P workshop, You were saying about having a meeting then. If that should be in the form of Yeah. well what I'd like I think I'd like people to do is go away and read this and see if it makes any sense when you've actually sat and studied it. Erm That remi you've C Cynthia saying that reminds me of the other thing that came out in feedback. From appraisal and the the training that you did the other week , Mm. is training in target setting. Mm. Mm. Which you could link in, target setting and objective setting and so on. You could put together as a package couldn't you ? Mm. It's the measurable ones and training that I'm just not I don't know what that means. Well I think it means, in the sense, if you look at the example they've given here. Well an objective is always measurable. Yeah. If you've if it's smart. If it's smart. Yeah it should be. If you look at the on sheet unit two point seven , At the bottom, and the measurable objective here is is reducing the number of complaint escalations by fifty percent within three months. Yeah. That's the sort of thing I mean. I think it would be very difficult to do that sort of thing . For us to do. Well it may be. But it may well be, with something like Jayne's workshop that she ran with with Graham , Well I didn't it was Graham's workshop. I didn't do anything. Well Graham's workshop. That the measurable objective might be that that that people who are on that course d go out and do X. Which is why you s when you set it up, you've got to say, Well what are people going to do at the end of the workshop, that demonstrates that they've learnt something from it? Yeah but then how do you va if one of your objectives is, that staff should be more confident in erm in their employer work. In things like cold and How do you actually measure that. I mean the only way measure it I suppose is by talking to them. You won't have any sort of numerical. I wouldn't have thought that you'd have any numerical erm But you could say that, whereas at the minute, because people are frightened the don don't go out and do it, they now you know, will go out and do it. Yeah yeah that's wha but I mean But would you then it' not numerically or Mm. No. You're not gonna say visit fifty fifty firms after this. No. No. Cos I mean you'd have your employer plan for the year anyway really . But there are some staff that we we assess their competency of employer visiting. Okay only people in their part two, but Yeah. you could actually measure an increasing competence. Could you. If some i Well well you could I mean if you went out with someone and you thought they were pretty naff talking to the employer again six months later and say, Oh they're a lot better . Oh right if you were measuring them yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's true yes. Yeah. But then that would mean that you'd have to have assessed people in whatever it was they were going on the training course before Yeah. they went on, so you could then actually it's easy with part two people isn't it?cos you're measuring them and assessing them anyway. But how many part two people were on that course? I you know if we took that course as an example and wh what would I don't know. be the measurable objective? There was a part one person on the course. But not I don't whether there were any part two. Yeah. You see a this is what I feel is Yes I don't disagree, it may well be we want to talk to somebody like Adrian. And say, Come in Or Graham even. Mm. Although we have to pay for hi we have to pay for Adrian you see. I mean Adrian's two hundred pound a day. Is he. And that's internal. He's quite good at it But yeah I mean I might talk to Adrian and say alright come and do something on on measurable training objectives for us. But but we do it from Here. Er er Yeah. We do it in the aims and objectives don't we Cynthia. You know, the three year plan. We say, These are these are the objectives. This is how we're gonna measure it. Yeah. Mm. But a lot of the training doesn't actually have a definite something that's sort of a number because it's actually getting people to do the work that they're already doing in a slightly better way or to feel more confident Mm. about it. Yeah. Yeah. Erm That's still measurable. It's not easy but measurable. H but how I mean how would you For example l like the the interviewing further interviewing skills for the performance . How how would you go about measuring that other than talking to people afterwards about how they feel about interviewing others. But there is no I there anything wrong with that as a way of measuring. Time consuming. Yeah. But you could say, the measure would be, have they gone away and done it ? and their line manager Well they've got to do it anyway. Yes. Well no they don't Well yes they do but But if the line manager if in theory the line manager is taking feedback from them on immediately after the course and then going back to them after three months or six months. And actually talking to them, reviewing it. Then you are building up evidence. And maybe that it is in line with some of the the central targets of their appraisal. That you're automatically gonna be reviewing at six monthly Mm. or ye at least yearly intervals anyway . Mm. It's just gathering the the evidence isn't it really that's difficult So so if it if it was But then that has to be fed back to Yeah. If it was sort of part of the But then information from appraisal is being fed back centrally anyway. If if part of the appraisal was to look at what people had been trained in over the you know, the intervening period. Mm. And to make sure that that was recorded I mean, how they felt about you know, how that had helped them. Then Mm. you know, that could be a sort of central way of getting that back couldn't it if if it can be that sort of you know comments about being more confident, being able to get on with it. Yeah. That sort of data. Yeah cos if there's Cos you might not record that normally. No but if we sa But if we made sure that was recorded, somewhere. I don't know. I still think maybe maybe we shouldn't be doing as much, and we should d be doing a small amount better. Well could well be. The problem is I think if you actually m measure what we do do, Sue, I think the part My observation is, that there's too few of us doing it. Mm. Therefore it falls on all of us, all the time. Which is why I say we run the trainer trainer's course. Mm. And then you can you know, I mean, technically we have expanded cos if you look in in a couple of years there was me and you doing it wasn't there? Mm. So we've now got you know, five of us round the table and Ray and Karen and and whatever. And I think, what I want to do next is actually go through the list, and just check who's gonna, who's gonna run it. And then see how that that comes from there. But I don't think we ought to do this for every course. No. Initially. I think we I think you're right we probably do need to run a workshop. Maybe with somebody in to just just give us a go at it. And then introduce it. And I think by the time we get to Mm. this time next year, yes I think we'll be doing it for everything. But Mm. we're gonna have to build up to it. wonder as well, whether some of us should be putting as much energy into training teachers, and perhaps we should stop doing that and just concentrate on our own staff. Well I thought it was interesting, the boss said yesterday at partnership board, and I suspect he been saying with David , that erm you know, the gap in provision for careers education and guidance in North Yorkshire, is training teachers. Mm. But I don't disagree with you. I think it I I Oh no. said You know my views on that. Mm. That the burden for this falls on us, Yeah. almost totally. Mhm. And I think that's that's wrong. That we don't get any L E A assistance to actually er to do it. Yeah it's always a really isn't it? Well the advisors do nothing do they? Other than sort of do a bit of admin . Mm, So I I don't disagree with that statement. Especially when you're trying your people . I mean . Right. So point noted Cynthia I think, on that. But I'd like people to go away and read this Does it record body language? Right so as I said, Point taken but I'd like people to go away and read it. Yeah okay. And and erm we'll follow that up. Duly noted and warm fuzzy sense in your direction. So That'll now appear in dictionary. As a as a colloquial expression What's that other word that Allan used? Fantabbidabbidosy. I was wondering will that appear . Yeah. Slightly too many syllables there I thought. So the next thing's the trainees analysis that we said we'd we'd pick up on at a later date. Erm but it does include, on module three, unit three point eight. The er the team competency matrix. Sorry can you say again? Three Unit three unit mode module three Module three. unit three point eight. The team competency matrix. it's upside down. There it is. Oh it is yes. ways up . That we have to develop at some stage. I don't think I quite understand this Allan. Well it's a training needs analysis Jayne, so that everybody, you would say, first of all you would look at the job of a careers officer, and say, Right what competencies do they need to use that job. So you would then. Oh right. You would then list the competencies down the The top. the top. Along the top. And then tick off what they've done in the gaps. Oh I see . At that individuals gaps. So you would link all your employment officers in there, do that, and you would see form that whether all your team can er had induction for instance, and who hasn't, whether all your team have erm can do interviewing. Er you know, are competent interviewers, and if they're not, whatever. Mm. P I think that'd be that's really useful actually. Mm. It's interesting that team briefing thing on there, because that's come up a couple of times recently, people have mentioned about erm team briefing as a sort of management system. Have you come across that? I don't really I think I might have come across that before once when I was doing my placement on actually. But erm I know a student who was at B H S, near she was saying how she'd had training for er delivering team briefings. You know it was something that B H S had you know, Mm. gone into and everybody had been trained in this sort of team briefing system. And then at Betty's the other night you know, the was saying about team briefings too. I mean, I mean, we have office meetings you know, But I was thinking if we you know, if I knew sort of what the sort of philosophy was behind it I might be able to incorporate that into, the office meetings and say we were having team briefings. Well anybody want to interpret Well my understanding of team briefings, very quickly, is is to give you an example, after C S M T, what we should do is one of us should actually write down the key points from C S M T that you want to communicate to staff. That is then dished out to line managers. Who then deliver that team brief, in the same way to all members of staff. So that all members of staff get, key elements of communication at the same time. In the same way. mm. Rather than as we probably do at the minute, is you may go back and have a staff meeting whereas Sue may go back and brief Bill, to go and brief, whereas Jayne writes out to all her her senior officers. And you do it six different ways. The idea is that there's one sheet of paper produced, with the key information that's delivered. At the same time preferably to all people within the organization. The other different thing I think is that it's more of a one way communication. Not exclusively No. but it's very much passing information down . Well actually Yeah. when when I first heard about this it was at 's Engines mm. where I did my placement. And they had a system where erm they got this information and they It was that they I think there there was something about the time element, it had to happen at a certain time Mm. on a certain Mm. day. And this information was fed to them. er but then everybody in in working at 's had the opportunity to feed back Mm. to the managing director, who was available at a certain time. Mm. So you know there was this Mm yeah. sort of system for feedback as well. Mm. And questions. I came across I can't remember where it was but I came across somewhere where there was a freephone and people at a g on a given sort of in a given week could all just go and use this freephone number, and ring up and they'd hear a tape recording . you know, Yeah. and have a whinge you know, be available for people to phone you. An oral newsletter. Yeah something like that. I'd go back to this though Allan. The erm Sorry fine . No yeah. Andy 's coming along to the next C S M T Right. to brief on the team briefing method they use in Wakefield. Oh right right. Right That's what he did on his management. I but isn't Wakefield one of those authorities when they're all in a pretty central place. Or is it one where They've got three offices They've got three offices. Mm. Anyway. got our friend. Be interesting to fi to look after their I I P. well I sent you the report didn't I? Mhm. Well I sent you the the initial report just to show you what Yes. what rubbish quality. But I've got the full report. Right. Which is better. This I I can't help thinking with this Allan that we've talked about doing this competency thing and we've perhaps perhaps been a little bit dismissive of it because Mm. we know it's a quite a job. Yeah. But I almost wonder. Er looking at this, if it's actually a lot more central to what we ought to be doing. Because I think if we did this and we actually thought through what competencies e members of staff needed to have, Mm. it would help us rationalize the training provision a little bit, and No! The income tax The VAT and about they come and get it wherever they want. Yeah. And they can go through your books like that! Yeah. And walk in and expect to see them all in order. Mm. Right, any more there? And if you're not And if they and you if, if they get you on erm and they don't they don't bet it's a than they are . Sorry? But it's just VAT, it's a, just a tax return to them isn't it, VAT? Whether you've got accountants doing it or not. Do you like his curly hair father? I dunno. Innit smart? Yeah. He's real smart! Yeah it's nice. I'm glad someone does ! Very smart. Ha ! I'm gonna sleep tonight. You think you will do you? Yeah. Want us to go now? No, you're alright. Are you sure? If you wanna get You can tell us to go if you want. but you must do. Can you get a box tonight? Yeah, I'll find some I, I've got one at home I think somewhere I'll have a look. Yeah but not to not to cos you No no not a Glenfiddich? No, it's only wine that I want. Well I'll get a bottle of wine in as well. Okay? No, just a glass. You need a glass. No, well one for the nurses okay? And, and And wo a wo and one for the erm alcohol one. I mean we can wait but they won't mind which is which. Yeah I'll ask which one it is. And then I'll keep the other one. Course ! Did you finish your crossword after? No, I ju I just had a look at that I couldn't do anything. You haven't done any more! Oh you have, you have!

No, it's a, an R in it, it's about drawings. Mm. No, it's an L like the letters. Well change that L. That's right. What's the L Nobody's gonna look at it anyway! Number sixteen is something like gleam rings or no ? Plead means a place rings R A N C E what about R A N C E at the end? No space. No spaces, no. Something R A N C E like tolerance see is a Mhm. What on earth's up? Pamphlet there's only two letters missing out of pamphlet, two out of out of five we've got three first one, the middle one, the last one. I reckon that's tart where is it? Which one? T A R T. T, what about that letter? A R Oh no, can't be that. We'll have to make a word Pamphlet. up there. Pamphlet. Make a word up erm T, oh no that's difficult without a T. Mm. The T's us usually followed by a vowel. Mm. T E T and that. T and taste taught You must capitulate the word so yeah, surrender's right. Where's it say ? Trying to capitulate . Well if I only wanted to know the crossword and every single one is What time do you want her in the morning? If you name a time just so as As soon as you can troops together. Okay. Now that doesn't mean eight Eight o'clock does it? No, any No. time after ten o'clock. Any time after ten. Yeah. Right did you hear that Paul? Sure. Any time after to ten. Oh. So she leaves about ten she'll be here some time after ten won't she? That'll mean that gives you plenty of time to get up and get moving And it won't take long the to move those wardrobes, only about twenty minutes. Oh it'll take us a couple of minutes! It won't take twenty minutes! How many wardrobes are there? Two. Two? Yeah. And I say if you get on your hands and knees Get behind them and push them. and just pull and push on the bottom Mm.

No. That's that's how you . Must have been an Ovaltiney! An Ovaltiney! He, he mixed it with hot milk? Ha does you good! It's good for you! See at least once during the day you have a milky coffee and that's a pint of milk . Mm. And then cereals in the morning, that's another pint. You see. That's the two pints gone. Yeah. That's why the necessity for a full pint. That's why you end up with nine pints is it? Why don't you just get another two pints, why not have three Ah pints a day? because she about three pints, the pints a day the third pint cost you thirty five P and right, a four-pinter cost you a pound and two pence a pound and two pence, now work that out. Twenty seven P. Twenty seven and a half P. Mm. You save seven and a half P a pint. You save seven and a half P a pint ! That's not bad! Four pints you save thirty P, you see you've nearly the cost of your Yeah. Yeah, your third pint. Yeah but then that's taking You see yo in petrol by going to the shops That's right. and time Yeah. Er, you like the milkman the milkman I mean absolutely stupid I thought because he kept putting milk up it was thirty P when we went there first Mm, yeah and now it's thirty five. now it's thirty five or thirty six I mean they put it up for the er crisis Do you know di it didn't come down again it, it went up tuppence for the crisis. What crisis? There were a crisis! Which crisis? The oil crisis. We haven't had an oil crisis! We have! When the we Have we? when the Gulf war was on. There wasn't an oil crisis! Yeah there was. It's a heck of a it's, it's thirty four pence a gallon it was. It wasn't a crisis! in fact it costs The oil excuse! and they're laughing at Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah! What they what they should do the, the milk I'd say your first pint cost you twenty six thirty six Yeah. all other pints will cost you thirty. Mm. Did you know that the people who sell the milk, the dairies that sell a bring it round to you did you know, not many people know this! Did you know Did you know it's about twenty P . No. That they are allowed to sell it to shops to shops cheaper than they are allowed to sell it to you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a minimum charge they can sell it to yo individual customers Yeah. but they can sell it to shops, a crate of it to shops cheaper than than they can sell it so that means And then the shops, the shop bu the shop sells it the same price as the No, no the shop could use it then as a as a loss leader he could make say, a penny on it an ge so if he buys it at, you're buying what, thirty five? I think they can buy it at twenty eight. Right. So if he sells it thirty, just, he won't even cover his overheads on that but it means instead of having it delivered you go down to Joe's shop get it for thirty P save yourself five P. Yeah. Now isn't that crazy? Yeah. Now, the regulations that control that, that decide that are absolutely barmy! Yeah. Because they're encouraging the people who are providing the business to go out of business. Yeah. Yeah! Aren't they? Yeah. Yeah. Then actual consequence of it Why not have three pints every other day? Because I object to paying that much for milk! Yeah. Even it, even if you Have four e i if every four if days. if the shop, milk shop was across the road to afford that delivery price No. Yeah. Er right? Because the . Mm. You should start your own milk round. So do you ever, do you have any delivered? Yeah, two pints a day. At thirty five P a pint? Mm. Well that's Because if there's any And you get your er price and you get your other milk from the supermarket Yes. when you go shopping? Yeah. You should get one a day then there's six pints of milk. Get two two a day and it leaves er four pounds ninety. But it's when you're built up to nine pints it makes you Why don't you get say, two four-pinters on a Monday or whenever you go shopping Will you shut up! And yo and then you get you get, keep your own because if there's any time she can't walk down to the bottom we've always She's got got a contact. Ah. She can put a little note in there and say she wants some a taties and some, some bread and then it's delivered. Oh he delivers those as well does he? Yeah. Ah? He delivers those as well? Yeah. So you're paying for a service really aren't you? Yeah. Mm. You're not just paying for milk. You're paying for the two things you're paying for the opportunity No! you're paying for the opportu by that chap coming round Yeah. and doing that you're paying for the opportunity of having erm other services Yeah. like bread Yeah. I think you may yoghurt like if you left a note for the postman he'd drop it through the door Oh it's like that is it? Yeah. Right. Fish and chips!

He was fortunate in that he had the right doctor at the right time in the right so hospital But he didn't have the right expertise around him. Oh yeah! He hadn't had those how they Do you think if he'd been sent into hospital earlier he wouldn't have been in such a It would have depended on which hospital he'd have been sent to. Really? Erm if he'd have stayed at Southwold Hospital he would have died! They couldn't have coped with it, no! What they've done with him there is remarkable!

No. No. Well, we'll see what see what Tony says. Then if you both want to go to the hospital you can't somebody will have to be either graciously accept to go over and get the bedroom sorted Or? or ungraciously have to toss a coin! That's a Oh it's the red button on that recorder Yeah. but black the orange light's shining on the red button made it look black. Have a look at it. Don't press it but just have a look. Oh, this light here. Oh yeah! See it? Yeah. It's like if you, if you look at the on that Mm. and then you look at the normal lights Mm. they look really yellow, they look, don't look as yellow as these lights. Because the lights are Ultra violet er they're Ultra violet? Yeah, that's the colour of the light. And Whi a bluey white? No, it's the actual, the colour of the light is ultra violet and the colour of the those normal lights, I think they're red or something. But isn't ultra violet blue? A blue light? Erm, erm not . But the lights aren't blue. They've got a blue hue to them, a blue tinge to them but the lights aren't blue lights are they? Yeah. No they're violet. Does it still look like a runway to you then? No, not any more. I used to be down a straight road here. Pardon? I used to be down a straight road.. Everything that I do The other night when we came back the streets were deserted. What night you come back? The night of the F A cup replay. Was it? So people who'd either gone to the football or Watching it or listening to it on the or watching it on the radio or television. Was it on, I think it was on Sky or something It was Sky, it was on Sky. Sky T V so they were either watching it on their own or being very neighbourly with their neighbours or listening to it on the radio or as you say, up in Liverpool. Rather not go there! Pardon? I'd rather not go to Liverpool ! It is a pity though winning two one, being being up two one and then Were they ? Yeah! And then losing three two. That's a pity. Yeah. So who scored? If only, if only! I think Des Allan, Yeah but erm he was going out with erm Nathan's sister. Who? The Was he? Yeah. For how long? I don't know how long it was. Said they were going out it's just that that was ages ago though . Pardon? It was ages ago.. Pardon? I just remember. this nuisance right. Say that again! I remember about. Did you know that if a man Jumps off, I know. jumps off the top of Big Ben Yeah, I know. wearing a tweed jacket he he'll hit the ground in eight and a half seconds! Did you know that this one? Not many people know that! That if you jumped off Big Ben wearing a s sto sto sto sto sto sto a wearing a wearing a leather jacket Mm! your top speed would be two hundred and seventy two miles an hour! Not many people know that! That's right. Nah it's right innit! Ha! You know the fastest speed of one is two hundred and forty miles an hour something like that. It's thirty, it accelerates at thirty two feet per second Yeah. per second But it can only reach doesn't it? a certain speed but in fact Oh yes! as you Yeah. fall you slow down because you ca there's more, there's more air friction towards the ground. Yeah, so if as you're falling from a great height. Yeah. Okay if the theory is, if you dropped a feather and a penny at the same time from the same height the theory is that they both should reach the ground Equally, equal time. at the same time but the feather there's a lot more of but in fact they don't the surface area to . Yeah, so if to collect the air there's a on it tends to float down a bit. Just hold on to your seat belt I've got somebody right up our backside! Oh he's dropped back a bit. I thought we were going to have a visitor in the boot. He's right He's still there. right up behind us. Hit your fog light then. Well never mind. He's trying to get a bit closer. He just got a lot closer than that. Blimey A lot closer than that that's he's a Ford and at a guess is it Ford? Ford Escort or something. No it's not. , it was a Ford. It wasn't a Ford it was Japanese It is a Ford Granada. I, I read I read the, I saw the . It's a funny shaped Ford Granada that Paul! I thought we were going to have a visitor coming in through the back door. This door. Yeah he was close I don't know why. He was very close! Here we go! It's a nuisance that, isn't it that? And you don't actually know it's going off do you? It's only happened, you know when the windscreen went all the bubbles appeared Yeah. on in, in, in the laminates alright well when they took the windscreen out and replaced it with this one it's only since then that repair Really ? that this has started to creak and crackle. And one good crack with the back of your hand sorts it out for a couple of minutes. What's in the bottom ? Pardon? It's in the back there whatever it is that's bouncing around. Ah it's this tape. Pardon? It's this tape. Shove! Beep, boo! Faster and faster. Nice to be in the speed limit . Did you see Tomorrow's World? I saw bits of it, I was talking with your grandpa today about that. The bullet. Pardon? The bullet the fastest bullet. They they were experimenting to erm reproduce a space what it's like in space when erm debris since the space shuttle and then er Oh that's why I came up wasn't it? You know You know and they were they were erm firing this bullet at seven kilometres a second Yes. that's the speed and she's tearing into about erm five five strips of sheet metal . That's the bullet? Yeah i it's all done with hydrogen gas cylinder compressing the bullet. The most Those powerful gun in the world so it was shot by compression rather than explosion No , no no it's an explosion Yes. sent this little erm sort of tube sort of cylinder through er the hydrogen gas and then Explain it again you've lost me already. There was a it's gunpowder Yep. that shot this Why was there gunpowder? in the end, the gun was a the gun was about It was an actual gun? Yeah but it's it's not a An ord hand gun A rifle? No! A gu a gun about erm forty metres long. Forty metres! Yeah, it's a gun. So it was a gun that was only, you'd only find it in a building? It isn't an, an actual gun that you'd see Oh no! somewhere? No, it's the only one of its kind! So it's ju it's purely No it's experimental? Yeah. And they were er and the gunpowder when, when it was ignited this It exploded. yeah, it's the bullet moved away from it no, no, not the bullet! The, there was a erm send it down right, and that got sent down this They shot a cylinder away? Yeah. A solid cylinder? Yeah. And this, and this cylinder But a cylinder is empty! Yeah, oh it's you know I mean a er A ce it was cylindrical but it was solid? Yeah. Yeah. And it shot it went down shot it through this barrel and inside was hydrogen gas and as it went through But it, but as it went when it went through, through the gas, yeah? it erm the gas just pushed very hard So the cylinder fixed tightly inside the barrel like just as if No! it was Yeah. a bullet? Yeah. And then this hits a plate and on that plate Now what hits the plate? The gas or the bullet? The both at the same time I think Okay. the er What's the point in putting the hydrogen gas I'll explain that. Go on. Okay. And then on this plate there's a, there's an actual bullet no a and it, it, it looks like a bullet, I don't kno I don't know what it is and it's like that if you hit something Yep. if you hit something twice as big to what you're hitting it'll go twice as fast as it does with a snooker ball. But a snooker ball isn't twice as big, you know when a snooker ball hits something the other ball goes away quicker than the ball that's hit it yeah? It gains, it gains momentum. Yeah. So it, it ga it went twice as quick as that ball's going. Mhm. And then this went down the barrel and you know, hit whatever it wanted to hit and each shot cost a thousand pounds! In setting each one of them, to get it all ready cost a thousand pounds! But they they, that wasn't accurate because it has to go up, to have fifteen kilometres a second. And they've only got it to seven? Yeah. But they do that, they reckon it won't take long. Do they think they can get it up to fifteen? Yeah. And what's the purpose of it? To try erm make a material that withstand if it was hitting it. At fifteen kilometres a second? Yeah. Because of the danger of space things in space being hit by debris and the the debris is travelling at fifteen kilometres a second? Yeah. Yeah? erm a flake of paint hit a spaceship windscreen and it cracked it, just a flake of paint! A flake of paint? Yeah. No metal attached to it? No, just a flake of paint. Just a flake of paint. Is, is, yes it's, it's, that's doing it. So how much junk, garbage, rubbish I know whatever is up there. I know. Is it in one particular area or is it just scattered No it's anywhere. That's stupid isn't it? Oh it is. Why don't they collect it together then? Well it's just like the ends of space rockets you know. Mi you know the really old Russian ones,when they I remember when they shot the rockets up and then the bits of them just get left behind in space. This is crazy! It's waiting for an accident to happen! Yeah. Because if one of, not just a flake of paint if something bigger than that Yeah, and when a piece of a rocket or and when tho when that a bolt or a nut or something and when that hit whatever it hit it would really damage it wouldn't it? and when that hits whatever it hit that's gonna explode and that's gonna send . Oh my God! So, are the plans afoot to collect this rubbish? No, just tha I don't think they're gonna Are we go ar are we going to have dustbin men orbiting the world? Yeah ! Ha? Yeah. Waiting for a Christmas tip! That's a thought isn't it? Yeah. Maybe there's an industry in the fu er, for the future there Paul? Seriously! Refuse collection Have to have some . Orbital Cleaning Services! Refuse refuse collection of the world world out of this world, we're out of this world! We're Di did grandpa say he could drive back? Oh, said he could drive back, I don't think he might be able to but I do He I think it would erm that would set him back Paul that really would. Oh yeah! Don't play around I think with that! he's in high spirits isn't he? That he's coming out. Well it's good that! It's Yeah. it's important he's feeling he wants to do things. And what's this about a light switch? When the wardrobes are moved it could be that they will hide the wall light switch and he's not bothered about that one little bit! Because it doesn't, as he says he doesn't use the main light in the room he uses the bedside lights okay? Aha. And if he really needs Good! to put it on he can just put his hand behind it. Ha,dark. He just doesn't want it on! So i it doesn't come into it that! Okay? Aha. Right . It's such a small room that one. Pardon? It's such a small room. Small room? Mm. Yep. Out tomorrow! Hasn't he done well? He's been very lucky! That's right he . Pardon? He he's the only person out of that in that whole Ward Mm. the only patient that probably hasn't got cancer he's the only one. But the others that have got the cancers I think you'll find that what they're doing with them ar a lot of those cancers will be cured. Oh yeah! No, all they have to do once they've found one new cure for cancer Yes. the they'll have it for everything! Cos they're all generally the same cancer so Well, if you find a universal cure for something that's what it Yeah, I mean means! No, if they find one cure for it. If they find a cure for say, lung cancer they'll just have to chase just a tiny bit and they will do cancer. I don't know. Cos all cancer is your cells erm Ah but that's the simplistic I know. side of it, er all it is is that That's all it, yeah. It's what triggers it and what causes it to keep triggering and moving that and Mm. going out of control. What and if we can find out what it is that does that You go to people and say and then antidote and then find that sort of thing. and then find what it's what we can do to stop it triggering and carrying that reaction on and on and on and on or turning it back. If that makes that happen that way what makes it go the opposite way? You know, what makes it reduce? In safety, that is. Cos you might find you give somebody something erm which counteracts that Yeah. but then because it's going into the body it's also counteracting so many other things that you don't want it to counteract. What lu like chemotherapy? Yeah. Mm. Ah! Right, come on then. Can you bring in all those things out of the back? Aha . Please? The sweets, the books the lot, everything he's just given us. Go and shut that door. That's it. Don't leave anything behind. Have you got the lot? Yep. Three carriers, whisky and wine that was it. And wild, wild women! Close the door properly. Three carriers bottle of whisky bottle of wine. Bottle of whisky? Bottle of wine. Here's his sweets. And what do you want? They're his thankyous. ? He's getting ready. You saw didn't you? Leave them!

They've got all his tablets sorted for him for coming home. You know, what he'll have Are they ? dosage, frequency so on. And he has to contact the doctor?
