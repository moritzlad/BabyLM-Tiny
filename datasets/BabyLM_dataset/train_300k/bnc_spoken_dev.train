Actually I didn't fucking know that one You still didn't get it well which, what was the they rang for a good twenty to twenty five minutes and we just erm, we, we all huddled together in the living room, and erm, anyway about half an hour went past, and then they finally went, we saw them, we live in a flat, and we saw them from the window, we saw them going back to the station you see. So, my dad says oh, thank goodness for that, anyway, erm, we, we sort of relaxed after that. About two, three hours later, after lunch, there was another ring on the doorbell, I went to answer it, and of course you can guess. There they were, they, they'd gone for a walk round London, and er come back. They'd come all the way from er, Southend, as I said,, and erm, Oh. I didn't know what to say, and they said, well where were you, well er, I said we were all standing on the balcony and we, we didn't hear you, erm, it was ab I mean looking back now, it's funny, but it was ludicrous at the time. Well indeed, and er, having got in, I suppose they proceeded to entertain your father with the music he didn't particularly want to hear in the first place? That's lovely. I feel a bit sorry for them, having come all the way from Southend, to your place, and er, being left ringing the doorbell for half an hour. I suppose a lot of people would say he got his just desserts, they did in that family, because they all came back for, three hours later, and er, gained entry. Doris from Ilford, good morning to you. Oh, hello Doug, yeah I wonder why you're so jolly in the morning. I mean, when I get up in the morning, it takes me four hours before I come to, you're always so jolly. Well, I think you know, I'm a naturally optimistic sort of person, and I, I'm not er, sort of blowing my own trumpet here, I, I, I erm, look on life with a great deal of optimism, er touch wood, I've been fairly lucky in my life. I've got a job that I love doing, and er, I also take the view that if I came and did this programme and moaned away at everybody, and er, moaned away about everything, nobody would ring me up, and nobody would listen. So, you know, I, I don't want to be too jolly, because er, er that, that, that's er, as bad as being morbid, isn't it and miserable, but I try and strike er, a happy balance. Okay, can I talk to you about the televisions? Yeah Well, I've got one in my bedroom in c cos, when I was in, ill, you know, erm, it's er, nice to, but I've got one downstairs, that's two, that's two. Now, for a long time, because my children have grown up, and I don't see them being, being young men, when the young men get married, you, mothers don't see them, so I'm on my own, and it's, erm, I can't rely on that for company at all. L B C is on day and all night but Wonderful. the thing is, erm, I don't think that the, the standard is good enough to warrant paying eighty two pounds for a licence. Oh, so far from paying any extra for a another television set, you are not happy at paying what we're paying at the moment? I'm going a step further, Doug. And I've got some friends, who are very affluent, I'm not affluent at all. Mhm. Er, you go in their home, it's black and white, because they refuse, they don't think it warrants the eighty two pound licence, and I'm gonna get, er black and white, and er, that's what I'm gonna do. Okay Doris, well, far from paying another twenty quid for her extra television set, Doris is very annoyed she's got to pay eighty three quid for a colour licence, and she's gonna now go to black and white. I forget what black and white is, it's considerably cheaper, isn't it really? But, erm, a lot a people are now saying that the quality of er, the programmes on the telly isn't very good. Er, if you want to er, develop that part of the argument, then by all means, let's do so, after the eight o'clock news. It's now three minutes to. Right, exactly sixty seconds to go, then I'll bring you the eight o'clock news, then after that, we'll continue our conversation on the main topics of the morning, according to you. Families with more than one telly, could soon be paying twenty pounds extra for their licence. It's to lessen the burden on hard-up viewers, but most of you this morning, feel that to pay the existing licence fee is far too much, so I'd like to hear more views on that please, and also I'd like to hear from Spurs fans especially, and football fans in general, your memories, your tributes to the late, great Danny Blanchflower. Right the eight o'clock news coming up, on this radio station. Right, I'm sure that er, many people will know by now, but I'm gonna say it anyway that at the end of January, we will be on the Breakfast Call, broadcasting to you live from Sydney, to celebrate Australia Day. Now here's the interesting bit, in the next few minutes, I'll be telling you how you can win the chance to travel with me on an all expenses paid trip. Stay tuned for the Dougie Down Under competition, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline. The time now is nine and a half minutes past eight. If you've just joined us for the eight o'clock news, as many people do, welcome. We're discussing this morning, and I'll run briefly through the subjects that we have been discussing this morning for the er, new listeners. Families with two tellies could soon be paying twenty pounds extra for their licences, to lessen the burden on hard-up viewers. That is the proposal from MPs on the Commons' Heritage Committee, do you think it's fair? That if you have a second telly in the house, you should pay twenty pounds extra in licence money for it. And it may be, that if you have three tellies in the house, you'll have to pay forty pounds extra. I wonder if that is fair, even if it is going to ease the burden on hard-up viewers? A lot of people are saying this morning, that er, the existing licence fee of eighty three quid is far too high, given that we er get repeats from the B B C for most of the summer. Well, a lot of er talkers there, and er, if you'd like to give me a ring, it's . We've been discussing the release of the three British hostages. Saddam Hussein has made the most of it, hasn't he really? Getting himself photographed shaking the hands of our mediator, and negotiator, Sir Edward Heath. I wonder if that erm, really did revile you seeing a leading British politician shaking Saddam's hand? Do you feel a deal has been done there? And, er if indeed a deal has been done, is it worth it, to get those three British people out? . We've been discussing guests coming to stay at your place over Christmas. And there's a fascinating article in this, the current edition, the January edition it is now, because they go so far in advance, of She magazine, which says that er, it's a desperate plight sometimes, when you have people coming for Christmas who fall into several categories like lazy slobs, who do absolutely nothing, and misers, who turn up with a stale box of chocolates, and never take you out for a meal in return for your hospitality, and the amorous couples who er, embarrass you by er, er, noisily retiring to their bedroom, if I may put it that way, and then the guests who turn up in mid-row, and bicker systematically over the whole of the festive period. So, how do you get rid of or avoid coming, of the unwanted guest? And I'd like to hear your tribute, perhaps your memory of the great Danny Blanchflower, who so sadly left us yesterday. One of the great footballers of er, his age, or perhaps any other age, and it's sad isn't it, that in the same year, we've lost two, Bobby Moore and then Danny. There's also another story, I'd like to er, throw into the conversation, if I may? The residents of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, are,th the dismay, of British Telecom at the moment, because, about thirty five percent of B T's sixty thousand customers in Tunbridge Wells, are not in the book. Well that may surprise you. Keeping out of the book, in fact, has become increasingly popular, with the national average of twenty five percent, being one of the highest in the world. In London, believe it or not, B T tell us, that forty three percent of their customers are not listed, while in south west Essex, the average is forty percent, and in west Middlesex and north west Kent it's thirty five percent. Now, er, I don't know er why you might want to be unlisted, ex-directory, not in the book. If you are, then give me a ring and tell me why. Melvin from Hendon. Good morning Melvin. Good morning, Douglas. I'd like to pay my tribute to Danny Blanchflower. Yes? Er, he in my view, was a rare spirit. A spirit, that it seems to me, has virtually gone from em, certainly English football nowadays, and I think, in many ways, English sport in general. He was not only a fine footballer, he was also a gentleman to the Nth degree, and he told the story, I remember, he started his erm, professional football career in this country, with Barnsley, and he was transferred from Barnsley to Aston Villa, and at the time there was some haggling over the fee, and er, he was taken by the chairman of Barnsley, to meet the chairman of Aston Villa in the chairman's Rolls Royce. They went down to Birmingham, and while the er, two chairmen negotiated in the dining room, over a, an extremely affluent lunch, Danny Blanchflower was em, pushed into the kitchen to sit with the servants, if you like. That was the way of things in those days. Yes it was, yes. He was erm, unusually for that time, indeed, unusually for now, a university graduate. He graduated from St Andrew's University, and to, in many ways, he was infinitely better educated and more intelligent than those who ran football around him, but nevertheless, erm, he never showed that, in erm, a sense of being superior. Never, he was a remarkable footballer. He gave Tottenham Hotspur the title, I think, of the greatest club side ever in erm, British football, and they won erm, the double as everyone knows, in nineteen sixty one, the first English team to have won it this century. He led them to the er, first British title for a European trophy, and erm, eventually er, he also was a member of the Northern Ireland team that actually reached the quarter-finals in the nineteen fifty eight World Cup. And Northern Ireland's a very small country against all of the others. Yes. I d I know that, there's that phrase you know, we will never see his like again, I think we probably will, but it will be a very long time, and I cannot tell you the infinite feeling of sadness erm, that I felt when I heard of his passing. It seemed to me, an age had gone. Melvin, thank you very much indeed for your reminiscences. Jeff of Streatham. Good morning. Good morning, Douglas. First of all, all the best next week. Oh, thank you. Er, secondly, the hostages. Yes? You know, the ones being released today. Mhm. Erm, I er, like everybody else, are very glad to see they're gonna get their release, but do you know Dougie, erm, I for the life of me, cannot understand, and we don't know the full circumstances, how these people wander into a country like Iraq, which has a terrible reputation, and they don't like us very much, you know, how does this happen? Wouldn't you stay about five mil at least five miles away from the place if you were, if, if you were, if you er, wandering out there I certainly would Jeff, I couldn't agree more I mean I can't understand, yes yes I'd stay about five hundred miles away from the border if I was them yes That's right, yes, me too. Erm, you know, this is what I can't understand, we haven't heard this. An interesting point. Thank you for raising it, and er, we might get some er comeback on that one. Er, it's all very well saying er, these people were apprehended, what a bit of bad luck, but what in God's name were they doing, straying around the border of a country like Iraq? Cos I say, I'd steer well clear of that place. There are many other places I'd like to visit, Sydney is one of them. I'll be telling you more about that in mo. Do you know, I'm getting quite attached to that tune. In five minutes it'll be the Dougie Down Under Competition, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline. We'll be bringing the show to you live from Sydney, Australia, at the end of January, to mark Australia Day, and we're looking for two couples, they can be husband and wife, mother and daughter, father and son, any combination you like, even a couple of friends, we're looking for two couples to come to Australia with the show, and to act as roving reporters. We want you to travel round the country at our expense, all expenses paid, needless to say, and we want you to tell us, by phone, live on the programme, in Sydney, what you're seeing and what you're doing. Sounds an exciting trip, really fabulous trip, and it will mean of course, seeing you will be li live on air, that we have to give you a little audition, so the finalists, have to be prepared to do an audition with me, live on air, just before Christmas. Okay. You must also, of course, have a valid passport, and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of January. Okay. So I'll ask you a question in about er, three or four minutes' time, which could result in you're going out next month with Dougie Down Under, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline. Beverley of Hampstead. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. What would you like to talk about? Well, it's about why I've been ex-directory for the last, er, twenty years. Oh, right, why then? Well because I'm a single parent, Mhm. a single mum,an you know, started off with two small babies, living very, very fast, and er, it's sort of safer. I think, you know, a woman living alone, Mhm. in this day and age, erm, is sort of erm, not a good thing, to sort of, advertise your name in a phone directory. Mhm, and you don't find that that gives you any difficulty at all, er with people who genuinely want to find your number? Er, well, erm, they could sort of do it, erm, I mean, when I leave er, a place that, house that I used to live in, I leave a forwarding address but no, I make sure, with the people that erm, take over the house, but they don't actually give out my phone number. Mm. But they can, if they're serious, they can do it by writing, you know. Mhm, so you're ex-directory, Beverley, and you've found that it's er, a great benefit as a single mum? For security reasons, yes. Beverley, thank you for your call. Larry from Chalk Farm. Good morning Larry. Hello Doug, how are you? I'm very well, and I know, er, that it's your birthday today, and said No. That's right isn't it, are we right? No, you're not. My birthday is February the tenth. Oh. And in fact you're probably going to be invited because everybody seems to want to give me an eightieth birthday party. An eightieth birthday party? Is it, are you eighty in February? Yes, February the tenth. Oh right, I thought Now th it was December the tenth. We got er, the wrong dates, we've got you down in our list as December the tenth that's very odd no, I'm going to give you a list of parties, you can choose your party. I would, if I were you, I'd take the one in George studio. Alright, that's, you're on then, in February . Right, okay, well a happy birthday when it comes, and er, welcome to the show. Now, the reason I called was, that I have always been out of the phone directory ever since my name got well known in showbiz. You get Sure. an awful lot of pressure if your name is in it, but I got a special pleasure when I organized the reading from Salman Rushdie's book. Oh yes, well I suppose it would be I organized that at Conway Hall now, in most reference books my agent's name is listed, and my agent got a call saying the minute I began to read from that book I would die. Oh. Well, my agent got terrified, and she closed up her office that day, and they all went home. You're still here. I'm still here. They, they, they did get me, and I don't know how they got my number. They called me, and they said again, if I read the book I would be killed. And I said, look why don't you meet me in front of Conway Hall and kill me then, it would save so much time. Larry of course, with er,w w being a famous personality as you are, I mean er, if you were in the book, it would be awful wouldn't it, cos people would just have to, to er look up Adler, L and they Yes. they'd get you wouldn't they, really? Well, you, you see you get of every kind of, of a charity application, begging letters and so forth and it sounds cruel rather Yes, I can understand that. to say that you don't want to read all those letters. You cannot get interested in so many things. Larry thank you very much indeed, and erm, well have an extra birthday on us. Happy birthday for December the tenth as well. Eight twenty five. Right time for the Dougie Down Under competition, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline. Two couples must win an all expenses paid trip to Australia with me, when the show comes live from Sydney at the end of January. Hope I'm back for Larry's party. We've had four questions already this week, if you missed any of them, we will be repeating them next week, but now here is the final question. I think it's the most difficult actually that we've er, brought you this week. What is a baby kangaroo called? What's a baby kangaroo called? Now as soon as you have the five answers, and if you haven't heard the other four questions, then there will be a chance, as I said, to hear them again next week, when you've got the five answers, I'd like you to send me them on a Christmas card please, this is very, very important send them on a Christmas card please, to the following address. . Answers on a Christmas card, to and the Christmas cards please, with your answers, to be in by first post, next Friday, the seventeenth. Then, we'll keep you posted as to what happens next. Eight twenty seven. Right, the search is on for the person in the team who told me that Larry Adler's birthday was today, and not February the tenth. Anyway, er that apart, for your views on the news. The news coming up. and when I talked to Derek Thompson an hour ago, he's been in good form has Tommo. He's er, three winners out of four days, and a second, and er, he's going for a couple at Cheltenham today, in the twelve thirty five, number four, Book of Music, and in the two fifty five, number two, Flashing Steel. Twelve thirty five, Cheltenham, number four, Book of Music, two fifty five, number two, Flashing Steel. Pam, most of the morning papers of course, have had er, glowing tributes, quite rightly so, to Danny Blanchflower, we've had a lot of people on this morning saying that we'll never see his like again. Er, er, it's dreadful isn't it, that we've lost two of the outstanding footballers of this or any other age in one year. Bobby Moore and now Danny? Mm. Bobby Moore, yes, and of course, er, you know, it, it has been a, a very sad year, you know if you couple it together with, with Arthur Ashe, the Wimbledon champion and Of course, mm. of course, erm, James Hunt, but er, yes, it's rather sad as well that, you know, the last few years of erm, Danny's life were, were, were, he was so crippled with Alzheimer's and, and really not er, er shade of the sort of happy, er person, that, that he had been. But I think that's how we will remember him of course, when, when, you know, the sadness er passes away. Well, one of the great gentlemen of football, wasn't he? Now maybe there's no place for gentlemen in football now, I don't know, but er Absolutely well it does seem, it does seem a, a football of a, of another era certainly, but erm, I mean, I think he brought a breath of fresh air into football at the time. I mean even, even myself as a young girl, I'm not, I'm not th you know, that, that erm, that young yet, but I can remember him the er, you know, streak of er, lightning across the old black and white screen. But erm, Mm, yes. indeed, he, he's been revered as an intellectual player, erm, he, a thinking player, a shining example, and of course, that, that shows up in, in statistics when you read about what he's achieved, and you think, you know, fifty six caps for Northern Ireland. Mm. He got Northern Ireland into the quarter-finals of the World Cup in fifty eight, and again at club level. Cup double, cup and league double in sixty one, F A Cup the following year, and erm, the first British club, Spurs in nineteen sixty three, to win er, to win the European Trophy, the Cup Winner's Cup, a five one er, victory against Athletic Madrid, I mean, that is tremendous, that all speaks for himself, and, and I gather he's a very great rac raconteur, and a much, much loved er man, sadly missed Mhm, mm oh yes indeed, yes, indeed, indeed, a great after dinner speaker too, tremendous er, tremendous Irish wit. Well, he graced Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, of course, well placed for the World Cup draw, aren't they? Yes, quite interesting because er, they've been named er, in group two er, of the seedings, which have been er, released today. The draw will er, be er, a glitzy affair in Las Vegas, with er various Hollywood stars, and rock stars, next week Elton John and Rod Stewart will be turning out, and Julio Mhm, I can imagine well they know a bit about they know, oh, the, well, Julio of course used to keep goal didn't he? For er, a club side in Spain wasn't it? Yes, I can't imagine it, and again of course Rod Steward, and Elton John, we all know, how er, well connected they are, er with the game, absolutely, so And they're very good footballers, or they were, mm. there's gonna, so we'll need quite er, quite a turn up there, but erm, Republic of Ireland are seeded er, in group two, and in fact above Holland who are in group three, and Norway, in group four. If you think they were, they were two who did better than England. Sure. But I mean, poor old England, erm, it's R I P I'm afraid. Yes, poor Er, group one seedings, just to let you know, United States who're in that seeding group as hosts anyway, Germany as the holders, and then former winners, Argentina, Italy, Brazil, and Belgium and it's all, all based on their, their results of the last three competitions. So. Right, Rugby Union, more concern about er rough play, Bath accused of foul play. Yes. Getting a bit much, isn't it? It is a bit much when you think, you know, hot on the heels of Will Carling's erm, you know, accusations about the All Blacks, and, and what they're er, er, alleged to have got up to on their tour of England and Scotland. Er, now, erm, Harlequins have complained to Bath, there've been allegations er, during last weekend's er Courage League match, which Bath won incidentally, of gouging and biting, er and Bath officials now have agreed that they will look at a video recording and take appropriate action, in quotes, if anything erm, needs to be done. I mean Harlequins actually, erm, alleged that it wasn't just an, an indiscriminate boot or a punch, this was quite er, yeah Calculated stuff, yeah and er, talking of fracas, a lucky escape for Ayrton Senna, in his disciplinary hearing in Paris. Yes, he, he's erm, escaped with a two race suspended ban, this was for erm, his fist meeting the face of er, Irish driver Eddie . Er, at er so Nice way of putting it. This was er, the, the er, Japanese Grand Prix in October. Erm, he didn't actually admit at the hearing that he had hit, erm, but erm, the disciplinary panel agreed that he had perhaps been provoked er rather more than er, had been necessary. So the, the upshot of it all, is he's banned for two races, but this is a susp suspended erm, ban over two months, er er, over six months rather, so it means that if he's a good boy over the next six months he won't miss any races at all, so he has had a lucky escape. He has, he has. Well known for his temper. Yes, indeed so I believe. Pam thank you very much indeed. Er, Pam Dixon er,step stepping in for er, Dominic , is the er, bearded man back on Monday? No, I, I gather he has taken a long weekend, I don't know where he's whisked himself off to, but I'm afraid I won't be here, er next week, I don't know, quite know who will be, but er, Dominic's taking er, a well needed rest. Right, yes, I might say that, right, Pam, thanks very much indeed, it's twenty minutes to nine. Seventeen minutes to nine. Gerald has rung me from East Sheen. Good morning Gerald. Good morning Mr Cameron, and er, many happy birthday returns for er, Larry Adler. Yes in February. No doubt he will, er,re reciprocate, because it's mine on Monday. Oh, is it? Twenty s I'm not sure whether it's twenty six or twenty seven. No comment please. Never mind, happy returns, many happy returns er, for Monday. Anyway,th thank you very much, and, and, I hope you do well when you go into hospital on Monday. Oh thanks, nothing, nothing to, very minor thing, on Monday. Well it is it's still, it always causes some concern though, for those around you. Anyway, it er, this business of erm, twenty pound increase on the T V. Yes. Quite, my goodness me, we er, surely the people must be sick and tired of this lot. All they seem to do is target the ones at the hospitals, the police, the fire brigade, everything. Even the heating, and now they're targeting invalidity benefit yes mm Well, when you say this lot, actually, it, it's not er, actually a government body, this, in fact er, the Commons' Heritage Committee, er these are the people who are announcing this price rise, in the proposals yesterday, they're, they're actually led by Gerald Kaufman, who's never been a Conservative in his life. I know he hasn't, I know he hasn't. But even so, the government are still the people in charge, and they're the people who should er, make a final decision or not, er, er, isn't it? I mean, it's, it's t Oh they will yes, indeed er, it will be up to the government. I mean, I mean they are, they're, they really are you know, we're so complacent in this country, Mr Cameron, I, I don't know, do you know, they're just hitting us in every direction, my goodness me, you, you know, you'll be afraid to breathe without they'll want to target that. Okay Gerald, thank you very much indeed. Gerald obviously feeling er, very, very bad about er, this scheme to make us all pay twenty pounds extra, if we have a second T V set in the house. It's a proposal, nothing more than that at the moment, Derek from Barnet, good morning. Mr. Cameron, I'd like to pay tri tribute to Danny Blanchflower Yes. er, because I saw him play actually in the nineteen sixty two final against Burnley. Oh yes. And, er, and my father actually looked up the year before and found he knew the S H M, an old school chum, and he sent us a ticket. So I've only been the once, Yes. and he really was a marvellous player. Er, he never any, you know against him, and his skill and his performance was absolutely immaculate. I wonder how he would have done in today's game, do you think there would have been room for him today? Yes, absolutely I think so Mr Cameron. You see, he's got such skill, his footwork, and he's always in the right position, and he really was, I can't pay a higher tribute. It's very sad, the news, of course. Mind you, he'd of probably been hacked down, wouldn't he today, before, that's the problem nowadays? Er, well, that's the point what a marvellous draw Barnet's got Mr Cameron, against Chelsea in the Cup? Oh yes, that's right, of course, you're a great Barnet supporter just an ex Absolutely, I went to see at , we had to trouble at , not of our supporters Well the way Chelsea are playing at the moment, you've got a very good chance of winning. Well, we've got this runner you see, younger brother Carl, he does a lovely job at and of , there's a bit of spice added to, to it. Derek thank you very much indeed for your call. Thank you Mr. Cameron, bye-bye We must move on, because we've got to have a commercial break, and then we want to check on the traffic. It's fourteen minutes to nine. Countdown to the stars, here he is, Mr Murray. Good morning. Good morning, how are you Douglas? Not bad at all sir, thank you and you? Has it stopped raining? Not yet, just a, well that's it, I don't know, it's pretty dismal. Horrible isn't it, but I hear it's gonna be a bit better this afternoon. Yes, I think it, a little bit better, but much colder at the weekend, with a touch of sleet, by Sunday evening, we're told mm. Oh, sleet on Sunday, oh dear. Never mind, you can all warm us up with your, your programme this morning. Well, we start with the morning talkback, and the hour between ten and eleven, er, it's erm,, and the Vocational Guidance Association, helping people to find the job they really want. Er, between eleven and eleven thirty, Mike and Mark will be joining me, they're the authors of the official politically incorrect handbook. And between eleven thirty and twelve, Eddis who's the author of London, Under London. We'll be talking. Some fascinating things happen under Yes, I'm sure. And then between twelve and one, it's sport back on talkback with Tony . Mm, right. That's it. Right, right, I think you'll get a lot of calls on er, Danny Blanchflower this morning, a lot of people ringing up, remembering him with er great fondness. Yes, I'm sure we will. A terrible thing that he, he had Alzheimer's Disease for so long I mean, he was only, you know, sixty seven when he died, terrible. Mhm, yes, yes, yes, yeah, but a wonderful, wonderful player, And one of the most intelligent, er, footballers, I've ever met, right yes, mm, yes, yeah. Well, I think we'll get a lot of calls, and people remember him with great fondness. Pete thank you very much indeed. Pete Murray, between nine and one. Nine minutes to nine is the time now. On we go to the birthdays. Saw Dennis Law on T V, and he says that when he first played against Danny, he kicked him all round, all, all over the park. Dennis did? Dennis said that, yeah he said that Dennis was a fairly, let's put it er, as mildly as we can, a fairly competitive player wasn't he? I think he was. I think that's er, perhaps, er, enough to be said about Dennis Law's game. A brilliant player, played many great games, but erm, very competitive. I must say, he said that he regretted it now. But he was young probably. It was the first game he played against. But erm, and the other thing is, er, going back before er, Danny Blanchflower we had a goalkeeper Yes, Ted . You remember him? I do, the cat they used to call him, mm. That's right and I believe, well I think he was the first goalkeeper to throw the ball out. I never saw a goalkeeper before him throw a ball out to erm, you know, a player. No, I don't know Alf, I can't remember if he was the first goalkeeper ever to throw a ball out to a player but, er if you want to ring up, tell you what you want to do, you want to ring up if you're around, between twelve and one, and discuss that with Pete Murray, and Tony Lockwood, for, when they have the sport back on Talkback, and er, that of course, is the specialist sportsperson's hour, and er, they may be able to throw a bit of light on that. But I can remember Ted very well indeed. The cat, yeah, he was one of the er, first goalkeepers to er, make a habit of catching the ball, rather than punching it. Anyway, Alf, thank you very much indeed, er, for your call. Rebecca of Poplar. Sadly the last call, I think we'll be able to squeeze in this morning on our programme. Rebecca, good morning. Good morning, Doug. It's in regards about the television licences. Yes? Well, I'm eighty four years old, Mhm. and I pay full price, eighty three. I heard a while ago on the radio, that they were gonna put it up to eighty four fifty. Now, in regards about that, what I don't understand, people who live in sheltered accommodation, some pay five pound a year, some pay nothing. So I say, if it's good for one pensioner to that, why don't they allow other pensioners to pay it? Yes. Or, even make it a little cheaper? Well, I would have thought so, and I think that's what the I don't mind paying for it, if they could even reduce it a bit Yes, I think perhaps that is what may happen. I don't want to raise your hopes too much, Rebecca, but I think what, er the idea behind this, I er, thing is, families with two tellies, paying twenty pounds extra for the second set, and perhaps for the third set, another twenty pounds, it's to try and lessen the burden on viewers who genuinely can't afford the existing licence fee as it is now, and Rebecca, I would have thought that you would've fallen into that category. So, er, help may be at hand in the future. And er, on that message, er, it seems, er good enough time to say that's er, all we have time for as far as the phone calls are concerned on the Breakfast Call this morning. It's three minutes to nine, we'll have a break, then we'll have Rob back with the latest traffic. Are you er who have you got then? Okay who is it? Get real Okay. Cos I've got one tonight haven't I? Anywhere you wanna sit lads. Next to each other ideally should moving around now. Right Where you gonna go?my seat. So who's gonna go first out of you two? Yeah I'll go first. Right. Give us your form then er and in your own time and your own pace. Just gonna get a quick little refresher. Just a quick refresher , I dunno what page it's on. ? That would be a good refresher for you. No it's alright I've got that in my head, okay I'll, it's alright Hi Mike. Hiya. How you doing? Very well thank you. Okay. All we've been through this evening Yes. are you quite happy with it? Yes, quite interesting, yes. Quite interesting? And you're happy, ah right. Yes. Okay right that's good. Do you remember when I said er as we were going through I said there were one or two things that you perhaps could help me with? Yes you did mention that, yes. Yeah? Well I'm, as a matter of fact before that I actually said that er this, all this that I am doing on your behalf is completely free of charge You did. I did didn't I? Yes. Well it's a bit of a lie actually er there's a fee involved in all the preparation and all the work I've done er and what do you think the fee's worth? How much do you think it's worth? Well I don't know you didn't mention this earlier did you? Er that's true, as I said I, I lied a little bit, I, I failed to tell you the cost of the fee. How much do you think it's worth? Well I don't know. You don't know? Alright let me tell you it's not actual money, the help will come in the form of er recommendations. ah yes. Yeah? Er I would appreciate it very very much indeed Mike if er you know you could recommend me to one or two people you know, open minded like yourself who I can sit with, take a couple of er half an hour of their time like I've done with you, show them what the services are. Well I don't think I know anybody that would be interested really. Yeah? Erm as we were going through and we talked about a will, you said there there's somebody you knew who would be able to, you know, who you'd like to carry out your wishes if you were not here to carry them out yourself er I think it was, was it er John? Oh yes, yes. Yeah? You know have you got his phone number? Er yes okay I can give you that, yes. Great that's okay right, and is your, is your brother-in-law ? Yes my brother-in-law yes. Right right right right and does he live locally? Yes but I'm not sure, I think I'd rather phone him first if Ah in fact I'd appreciate that very very much indeed Mike, I, in fact I'll tell you give him a ring, tell him that you've given me his, the telephone number and he should expect that I'll give him a call in the next week Okay then, yes okay then. That's terrific. Okay. Erm is there anyone else er as open minded as your brother-in-law? No I can't think of anybody at the moment. You can't think. You play cricket don't you? I've been known to have the odd game, yes. Right and er ? Er there's about twelve other guys. Right. Course naturally as in the service this, this cost, this for yourself ? Perhaps er they could take up services. the guys you play cricket with, what are their names? You want all twelve do you? I wouldn't mind! I'm a greedy person as you can see, look at the size of me. I, I'll speak to them first and I'll, I'll er when, when, when you come back with some details I, I'll let you know then. Sure so at least you'll know when I come back I'm gonna ask you, thank you very much indeed. Okay. Okay? I thought you were a bit pushy So did I! prospect erm and also at the beginning there y I you, you did it in your own way, not, not, not following the script er that may be, well be previous experience you know, that Yeah. you, you, you're relying on, but you didn't really sort of go back and say, I mean I, I would use a phrase like erm you know, regards to planning your future I'm sure you found that of benefit to you tonight and get re and actually dig a bit deeper in that and say what was it in the, in, in that actual form that, that interest in your eyes. that was the one that interested you most. Yeah I was just looking for a memory jogger here, I just couldn't remember what it was Erm I didn't get anywhere that you actually reminded the prospect erm or pe potential client here why you're actually asking for referrals. Yeah. If, if he if he was open minded, I think he's happy with open minded he's happy, er said are you happy with all the preparation that we've done You didn't remind him t by not using the script you didn't Yeah. get into the point that like earlier on in the conversation I actually found it I know me and you have discussed this earlier on and I, I, I didn't find it I found it confusing to be honest with you. You did? Yeah, I, I found that you suddenly put you suddenly put me on the spot asking me for money. Yeah. That, that threw me completely. I don't know where you got, I mean is that previous, where you worked previously? No that's it I mean, look er the scenario's this Yeah? you get, it's that er in a normal conversational piece, yeah, I open my, okay it's not an Abbey Life Right. set piece Yeah the only thing no it's it's Right. so I walked in his house or her house or their house, you know, and I've said to them blah blah blah blah blah but this is what it's all about Yeah. Yeah? There's no fee involved, it's a completely free service, all I'm here to really do today is to have a chat with you, find out what you're interested in and see if we can situation, is that alright? Pursue all that pursue all that Sunday, yeah? Right. Yeah, but is that alright so he'll say yeah it's alright. I mean I thought you felt uncomfortable Mike. I thought you felt uncomfortable. I did. Yeah. Yeah. Okay fair enough that's the feeling but you the first bit, I'm justifying the Yeah yeah I mean I'm trying to give you a score here He's trying to justify it Yeah, so yeah ah you're alright so you'll say yeah course I'm alright,there's no fee, so eventually I get to the point where I said look I did say there's no fee involved but I'd, I, that's a bit of a lie because there is a fee for all the work I'm er but it comes in the form of referrals, in the form of recommendation, not actual money. No. You know I asked you to commit yourself, how much do you think it's worth for me to do all this kind of work and he's, you're confused because you think I'm actually talking about money and I take the weight off your shoulders by saying no it's not actually money, it's in the form of two or three names, people open minded like yourself, who I can sit down and discuss the whole situation with Yes, yeah all that all that part was okay erm but from the point of view of the script th th that we'd asked you to learn last night y you didn't do that now that may well work for you, the way you're actually doing it, but from a training point of view we, we're trying to look that you're actually following the, the script there. Erm so on that one that's, that's you didn't use any slang, the belief in the way you asked I think that came out, I was trying to be a prospective client rather than be the trainer cos I could see that Mike was uncomfortable and I was trying to, well okay, how, how would I well I think yeah there was a belief that you had there, I think he was er reasonably attentive, Mike, to your response? Yes. All be it wasn't, well th th th the, the response, and you didn't actually, you mentioned his brother didn't you? Yeah. At the time. He gave me his phone number But again, see again cos we're not following the actual script, the picking up and pinpointing people mentioned in earlier conversations, which you would've done if you'd've gone back to the planning the future. Yeah if I Mm. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen you've got fourteen which actually still gives you, would still actually give you an A in the real world. Right where's Okay that's gonna be a a C. Stick that in your locker when you go back in. Alright boss. Okay Mike it's over to you now then to Right. to your situation now, so imagine you've done the old planning of the future like we said, yeah? When I said to you earlier erm there's several ways in which you can help me now the main way you can help me is erm is er the way I do, the way I prefer to do business is by personal recommendations and you've seen the service that I can give you, you've seen, we've been through your, your personal situation, your financial situation, have you found that of benefit? Mhm. You have? Yeah. And, and that's you found it of interest to you? Yeah. Right, now what I'd like to do now is ask you for some of your, some names of friends of yours who, who I could go through the same process with them and, and establish their financial security for them too. Can you think of anybody offhand? You mentioned earlier you, you, you work with, is it you work with? Er yeah yeah. Yeah? Could you, would you like to give me his number? Well I don't actually have his er telephone number. Okay, can I contact him your place of work? Yeah you can Yeah. cos you've got the telephone number. We also was discussing earlier on that er you play squash. Er I don't actually it's er cricket. It's cricket is it? Yeah. Right. Erm have you got any, any er people there from the cricket team that I could er contact? Yeah I know er one or two persons. Yeah? You, you mentioned one was, was Steve was it? Yes. It was Steve, yeah? Steve . Yeah, Steve ? Mm. Good. And his, his phone number? Er yeah he's a good mate actually. I does he, is he a batsman or a or what? He's a bit of an all-rounder He's a bit of an all-rounder. Is he any good, is he better than you? He's a bit of a Quite good is he? Yeah that's good, good. You also mentioned that you're erm you're involved in scouting, is this right? No I'm not. Yes you are . Okay then er right, fine. That's it. Oh! That's it. Well you didn't actually revisit planning the future properly No. right? Erm remind er er and again your phraseology Mike like, well can you think of anybody, Yes I re I said that and I realized that I'd said it and I shouldn't have done. Th that, that Yeah. you know, you Yeah I er whereas if you had said positively that I'm sure you can think of a number of I asked him a question and he could answer no. Yes. But I realized I'd said it so I tried to dig myself out the hole Right well you didn't actually get any objections so you couldn't've handled them, you didn't mention about the prospect contacting the referrals prior to the being made er at the end you did actually bring up didn't you about the, the cricketer, is, is he a batsman then said he was a erm said he was a er all-rounder so you know I'll, I'll give you that You, you did actually say that I only work on, yeah Alright okay. The idea of finding out about the, the batsman was what he did in the cricket team, so that when I mentioned that I could say I don't, I don't think there was a lot of belief in the way you were actually asking Mike. I've got scripts, no enthusiastic well because of above, no. Alright, not use slang, show belief in the way he or she asks for recommendations going first which is probably not the best thing to do, be attentive you, you were reasonably attentive. Pick up and pinpoint names mentioned earlier well you did it cos you, you when asking for name and telephone number eye contact, alright there. You, I mean you weren't pushy enough I didn't think. No probably not. Yeah but again I think it all goes back to the script doesn't it? That's right, but I've also got a thing about being pushy you see. Well sorry, pushy, I mean we got push not what's the, what's the, the, the, not pushy's not the right word I'm looking for erm asking in a confident manner Yeah. that was missing, right? But the confidence comes with practice. With practice, yeah. Practice, practice, practice. ten which would actually give you a B in, in, in normal circumstances but as you know we're only allowed to give you a C. Right and there's a few notes in there as well, did I'll tick your box on your one. Do what? Er I dunno, which box is that? At the front on the front. At the top. Requires further on the job training? What C? I've ticked C have I? At, in, in the four boxes at the top Yeah. I've ticked? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, okay then. Alright, okay lads erm first is always the most difficult as I think you'd appreciate Yeah. if you wanna sit in on another couple of guys There's a queue formed, there's a queue, right okay. Now don't forget because these boys have forgotten it, you've gotta make sure you mention the planning your future document Yeah. gonna revisit it and, and it's standard cos it all hinges, if you look at that script, what happens next all hinges on what you've actually got on there, right? Who wants to go first then? I'll go first. Alright give us your, give us your seat then and I'll Cheers. Fine, now just imagine I'm not here now for a moment. Okay. Erm so you can see actually from this fact find, from the planning the future document, there are, there was, there is a particular interest to you erm are you, are you quite happy with the figures er sorry was it erm was it that you were more or less interested in? Was that the er particular interest Yeah er cover was the one that, after we'd been through the document, I did find of be of particular interest Yeah. because er it's obviously gonna fill a gap in my financial planning that I'd not thought about in the past so I did find it particularly helpful. Y you're quite happy how we achieved those figures? Yeah. You, you're quite happy Yes I thought the explanation was er was pretty good and clear and I was happy with the way the er the premium's worked out. That's good, I'm, I'm pleased about that. Erm yeah I did mention earlier actually there was one or two ways that you could perhaps help me er one was erm I hope, I'd like to think that obviously my service has been of value to you erm I'd also like to think that you can perhaps recommend me to people you know er you did actually mention earlier erm was it Peter you work with, was it Peter who works, yeah I don't know whether yeah Peter yeah. I'm too happy about sort of passing on er you know friends' names and addresses er I don't think it's really appropriate. Yeah that's, that's okay it's just er I mean I would like to feel you would introduce me if they actually knocked on the door and came in this evening otherwise they'd think wouldn't you, I mean Well I s yeah I suppose I, I suppose I would when you put it like that, yes. And so it's Peter from? That's right, Peter he's er he, he just started work in my department about three or four weeks ago, yes. And was it Peter ? Peter, Peter That's right. Peter . Peter that's and does he actually have a home telephone number or so can I Er I'm not too sure where he lives cos he just, I think he's just new to the town but if you give him a ring erm on the 's phone number and use the Right. same extension you used to contact me originally that would find him. Okay that, that's great. I would like to think you could perhaps mention to Peter if you see him in the next couple of days, I don't know whether he pops into the office but we, it would be nice if you could if you could mention our meeting and I'll probably see him er back at the office tomorrow, I, I will mention it to him when I see him. Yeah, yeah you could certainly point out the areas that have been of interest to you and perhaps I could follow up with a phone call to er to Peter in the Oh certainly. next couple of days. Yeah. Er Jim across, across the road, is it Jim you play on a Thursday so That's right. Yes. Yes certainly give you his er Right. phone number, yes. Thanks that's great. It's er I'll just, I'll just get my little book out and I'll tell you what it is. Right. It's er Darlington three four five six seven. Great that's smashing. Also the same if you're playing football with Jim on Thursday you could also just mention to, I'll leave you a couple of these er these leaflets which do explain a lot of the areas we've covered tonight, erm perhaps you could give one to Peter or Yes I'll er try I'll do that if I remember. Yeah that's okay. Erm does erm does Judy, I know your wife, she goes to yoga class doesn't she? She, she goes to the She does, yeah. classes, yeah. Do you think she knows er do you think she er I know she did mention the girl Kate she, she goes to yoga with, does she pick her up She did didn't she? that's right she picks her up cos you're out on Wednesday night so yeah do you think I could er perhaps get erm the number for Kate? Yeah well I'm sure she'd be interested, I think she has children I think doesn't she? Certainly when my wife comes back in I'll er I'll mention it to her and I'll get her to give you a ring. That's great, well you've, you've got my number and you can always contact me that would Yes. would be great. Okay that's, that's very kind of you, thanks very much. That's, that's good so thanks very much John, I'll leave you now Thank you John, it's been a pleasure thanks very much for thanks very much. Terrific except for one think, you didn't actually ask for the client to contact the referrals prior to the approach being made, number five I did. I said could you mention it to him. You didn't. Yes he did, asked er I said er I'll be I'll be seeing him when I go back to work in the morning That's right said perhaps can you mention it to him, mention Yeah, sorry, you're right, you're right. Okay. Erm number one asking for the completion had been worthwhile, very good there, reminded er John why, yeah that was excellent, thought you handled the objection well, you know, about if the person walked through, that was good, everything else was tick tick tick erm sound pretty enthusiastic there, that little extra note, excellent voice, quite enthusiasm again controlled but not appear too pushy, it was very controlled I think so, yes. erm you know, I put down here that you're a natural, Very fair. I can only give you a C. Tell me John I'm pleased that we've er we've managed to get business completed this evening, I think it's gone very well, I'm sure you agree, er do you think that er did you find the, the exercise of completing that planning the future document was of benefit to you? Yes er I did er I think my wife and I both agreed that er the, the was, was quite Was that the ar was that the area that you felt was of the most of er benefit to you? Yeah certainly. Why was that specifically do you think? Well that just er to be honest with you I mean after, after looking at it we, we couldn't believe it really that, that amount of people could be affected by that, we obviously thought it wouldn't happen to us but after seeing that, at the age we are, I really think it's a super plan and I'm sure we'll feel a lot better It is quite surprising how many of my particular clients do take out that particular plan and they do tend to mention the same type of er of benefits that y that er that you just mentioned there, it is er I think it is a good plan, universally appreciated. Tell me when, when we when we s started our discussion of the planning the future document I did say that er there was one or two things you could do for me and er one of those of course was to ask you if you could, during the more or less where the builders finished off, this was about the last house they did Yeah And our front garden was a rubble. All the rubble went there . Yes th as I remember they did the other side of first. Right yes. Mm. But erm I remember er we used to play in the houses as they were as they were being built . Yeah. It's a great game isn't it? Half built houses. You had to be careful that the builders didn't catch us. That's right yeah . Yeah. Throwing throwing balls of putty to each other and a couple of them went through windows and Oh well you had a good time. Do you want a fire retardant one or just in interestingly enough, the ones that have got price offers on them aren't fire retardant. I think probably supposed to have fire retardant things these days. when you get to a window I don't know other than t the curtains won't be fire retardant will they ? No they're not are they? You know. I'm not sure what to tell you about that one. Well I'm just thinking about what's round the windows anyway. I'm quite sure that material isn't fire retardant. No. And I'm quite sure the wood isn't. Given the amount of treatment Well there you are so it's got in it. it would seem to be rather a waste of erm Mm. whatever. I'm sure it's more expensive. Do you want a pure do do you want a pure white or Right. Mm. And the only other thing to do is to look at the at matching it . But I mean that's an almost perfect match isn't it to the furniture. This is erm quite a wide window could you Yes sure. If we start at the top Right. about erm just about midway point at this Yeah. side bit. Right then is we go down about halfway. That's a little bit wider and then er the bottom as well please. Then it's back up to the top one more time. This is a cr critical measurement. Yeah. Two three six point four. Okay. Well that's defeated me cos I measured it in in feet feet and inches. Yes we're entirely metric apart from erm Yeah. in these louvre sizes. Oh. These are these are three and a half inches wide. Oh I see. And we do another one which is Yeah. five inches wide. Ah. Well quite a mixture. Do you want the curtains moved back a bit or No I'll be okay thanks. have me little pocket calculator out and . It should be about eight by five actually. Mm. But it's very critical when you're erm Oh yes. When you've got to fit things like blinds and Especially this time. Is it very uneven? Erm today. It's erm not too bad apart from just at this end. It's that end is it? Yeah. What Erm where where the wrinkle is It goes off Yeah this last bit, Yeah? it goes up by about erm Oh yeah . by about this this amount. Which would mean the headrail Yeah. it would be air-packed. Oh I see otherwise it's not going to hang you'll have to have a couple of washers Yeah. into it just otherwise it would it would bend the headrail up Yeah. which might sort of Well also the rest of it's going to look a bit weird at the bottom isn't it? It wouldn't That's right it would it would pull pull the bottom Yeah. bit up as well. It probably w probably wouldn't er run properly if No. if it was bent. Mm. Right. Which end do the controls normally come? On the right end? Er whichever whichever side you'd like. Cos you could sh I mean we've got the curtains sort of left handed, it might be an idea to have the blind pull on the left hand end as well. Yes it's a bit more difficult to get at Another thing erm to tell you is erm the blinds, they can either erm bunch in the left hand side, Mhm. Mhm. right hand side excuse me, or it can be split. Mhm. Oh I see. There's not difference in the cost on that one. Mm that splitting sounds nice. Splitting It's a good idea on a window this size . Mm. Cos it's it's wide isn't Yeah. Yes it is cos otherwise you end up with a big big Yes, on this window, if you had them all bunched at one side, it would be Take up half half one of these this sort of windows wouldn't it? Yeah quite a bit. Mm. As opposed to two like that. Yeah which is obviously better . Yeah. Were there any in particular that you liked? What well mainly what what is the I mean, these thinner ones, presumably they would do the job as well as I don't know I mean, it's keeping out What I want to do is to keep out the sun. Yes. From the furniture so They'll all they'll all keep the sun out, Mhm. But what will happen however is erm when the sun is directly on them Yeah. it'll sort of erm light them up it'll be very Yeah, Mhm. You'll have a glare. It'll very yeah, very white Mhm. erm st quite strong white glare Mm. will will come up the blind. But it will actually stop the direct rays of the sun so you know Mm. Mm. for to protect your furnishings That's right yeah. It w it'll take erm roughly about erm it'll perhaps stop about half the light Mm. coming into the room. Mhm. Erm when the when that's when the sun's directly Yes yeah cos it's really only the the worst of the sun in the middle of the day in the Summer I think that does most of the damage. Although the light does light rots anyway doesn't it. Yes. But er mm. Well it's got to be one of the pure white ones whatever. And can you tell me anything about the materials that are actually cos they don't Yes I can Are are they better heavier than light or Erm I think it's just it's just personal erm preference really It's choice is it whatever you the l the look rather than Mm. I just wondered is any of them were were going to do a better job than I think w I think when it comes down to s durability they're all Mm. pretty much the same. Mhm. Apart from there's erm there's one at the back of the book which is er machine washable. Aha. You can actually put them in your washing machine. That sounds like a nice idea. Does it? Unless erm you've got sort of Mm. a problem with a heavy smoker or Mm. a coal fire or that kind of thing. There's not much There's not much point is there ? They should go they should go for quite a number of years. Yes yes. Witho without any maintenance. Mm. Erm you know these these are the various fabrics, you know, this is what they're made from. Oh most of them are polyester . Oh they're made polyester . Mm. So they're in fact they're virtually all polyester aren't they. Yeah. If they do need er cleaning, the advice is to use erm a a very mild detergent and erm a damp cloth. Mhm. But only just damp. Yeah. Mhm so you don't soak it. Yes because they've all got erm a stiffening agent Right. Yes. in the fabric. And if they get too wet they will wrinkle. Mhm. Yeah. Mm. Well I don't know. Difficult to say isn't it. I hate being pressed for choices. Just as well to give you an idea, erm they come in they come in various price Yes. categories. Mhm. Erm with the headrail that you were looking at, it's this one and they come they go from er one to six. Erm for instance, the cheapest one, the one that is is that one. Mhm. That's erm price category one. Yeah. Er this one for instance,is er er here we go. Yeah that's the most expensive. Mhm. And so fifty percent off on this one is going to work out more expensive than thirty three percent off Mhm. Yeah. on that one. Mhm. Mm. It's difficult to work out why some of these should be so much more expensive than others isn't it ? What about that one? Spice? Mm. Mm. A lot of it A lot of it is just is just down to erm marketing Yeah. I think and erm Yeah. Mm. I think erm most most of the people who do blinds, do some sort of system like this Yeah. And erm I suppose it would make it would be a lot more logical if all the blinds were just the same price all the time . Yes and you chose. Y but yes but we're by doing some form of sale Yeah. people see the the word sale Yeah I know They feel more inclined to buy them. And er actually it's just it's just unfortunate if the one if you the one that you like doesn't happen Yeah. to be in the sale at that particular time. Mm. You know, in three months or six months time It might be. Yes. Mm. Some of them are definitely denser than others aren't they. Mm. you know. difference I don't suppose actually got the direct sun on it. Mm. Yeah m my erm I live on Road, Yeah. so my er this in my house this is a patio window. Right. And er w we've got the seating along that wall Yeah. and that one and so erm what I do in the Summer as you said, when the sun's sort of at two o'clock Yeah. one o'clock, it's over there, and I angle my blinds in this direction and so Yes Yes yeah that's it and you can do this still can't you and you can still see out. From from the the seats we can still see out into the garden but it keeps We've got the television over in this corner And you can still see It ke Yeah we can still see the telly. Aha. Also it keeps the sun off it. Yeah. And keeps it off the carpet as well. Yes. That's right yeah. Mm. I quite like that one actually. Spice, mm . Mm. Just not too plain, it's got some some Yeah that's quite a popular one that is Mm. A lady at 's just erm ordered one of those this morning. I think I like that one actually . Yeah. What do you think. Well I you know I Doesn't make a I know. It doesn't make a lot of difference really. Once they're up they're up . Once they're up they erm up you you're not gonna notice really after a while Mm. what it what it is. Some of them erm the pattern But I Yes that one I think . shows through more than others. Yes. If you want to take them out of the book Mm. and just hold them up to light you quite welcome to do so . Mm yes well I can actually see you know That that's got a sort of a You've got a line across there which I think's quite attractive. Mm. How l how long are they supposed to last, things like this? Or is that a stupid question? depends on I don't know. your house and what you what you do in it Yeah. I've got erm a fourteen month old baby Mm. Mm. and er erm I've only got one vertical and that's on the patio and of course it's within his reach yeah. We've got the er chains on the bottom that interlink the louvres so grabbing hold of those Yeah. and giving them a good pull. So how long the blinds're going to last I don't know. Mm. Perhaps about another six months we did know somebody erm down on actually who had a a vertical blind and several of the chains had broken or disappeared on the bottom of that Yeah. the the blind worked alright. But that's probably not gonna happen along there there won't be anything else on the windowsill . That's it was it was as you say over a patio door, it was actually being used as an entrance door as well Yeah. so people were constantly sort of shoving this aside and walking through. little dogs as well tend to er get tangled up Yes. in the bottom Yes. of blinds . Or cats in her in her case it was cats, yes . It was cats in her case. Had to replace one erm er Close Mm. the other week Mm. and that was in a right state. the lady's had it about ten years but she's got a little dog as well. Mm. And erm there were hardly any chains left on it. Yeah. Well I think it is They ought to last a fair time they I mean it's not gonna be abused really is it at those windows ? No Shall I work you a price out Work it out for that one please . Yes please. Right. Got some lovely colours. Mm. I don't really think Be a bit heavy there wouldn't it I think. Mm. The thing to bear in mind with the colours is erm Well I wasn't gonna say that Well that I was thinking actually with that colour. You might do I do erm red one might fade a bit I don't know . Mm Generally w red erm red cars sure they fade. Mm. Yes yes. I've made made that mistake in the past. Mm. I I buy white now. Yeah. Or Yes. No I think white for here is best cos the sun is quite I mean you get quite a lot of sun don't you on on on this side of the house. Ah! we're going like one, two, three down oh I love 'em. and then gin and tonics till they were flowing out our ears then me and, me and er Claire decided to go back early Is that like when you erm got off with Matt?

She said it was sneaky the way he did it. Oh. If he'd have turned round and said, Look I'm putting this in the kitchen I'm gonna be listening to what you're saying then she wouldn't minded . Oh well wouldn't have been saying anything then would they ? Yeah but she wouldn't have minded. if she's not satisfied with it she should tell him. It's no But good telling everybody else. But they could've been talking about something personal and we would've heard everything they said. Mm. D'ya know what I mean? Well no if first in reverse isn't it? Yeah. Well you don't speak up do you? No. If you you think it's gonna be recorded and you don't know. Well you just It is just like a baby alarm. Well any anyway personal you know don't talk in a crowd You can hear them but they can't hear you. do you if it's personal No. er connection with that because with the assumption that males generally don't give any parental investment what really benefit them to you know biologically can, can support the offspring themselves short period of time why can't they then go you know to have their own I mean Right, right Yes, I mean you put your finger on an important problem here that we need to discuss and that is that if you concentrate on human beings in general, and this is true on our own society but I, I think it's true of just about all societies and it's emphatically true of primal hunting adult societies then men do make a lot of parental investment don't they? I mean you think about primal hunting adults like the bushmen or the Australian Aborigines, the the men do the, do the hunting for erm for meat and women do the, do the gathering for and the point is that er meat is very nutritious and it's an important part of their diet and men go hunting and they come back and they share food with their wives and their relatives or someone and male parental investment is terribly important So women for instance if you ask David McKnight who's a world authority on the Australian Aborigines and has spent many years living with them, say what do women look for in the traditional society, what do women look for in a husband? His answer is immediate and emphatic a good hunter, he says you know what a woman wants in a, in a husband is a man who can you know bring home the bacon literally, er it's not smoked of course, but it's fresh! But you see the point, so in our species and of course in most societies this is true men are breadwinners whether in an agricultural society or an industrial society erm you know one often feels that if you're the man in the family you earn all the money your wife spends it on most of the time erm it certainly happens to me er I spend most of my time working while my wife spends most of the time shopping but erm she certainly spends the money, but erm but the, the Well I think you know you've gotta, gotta speak up for us poor husbands sometimes erm the er but you see the point I'm making, in our species males do contribute. Now, this contribution is not direct, it's indirect in the sense that males, a male for example who is provisioning a wife who is pregnant is not directly invent investing in the offspring clearly you can't do that she has to do that, cos the offspring's inside her body, but indirectly he may be feeding his wife, protecting her and providing for her in, in a way that is absolutely critical to her reproductive success too. So it's important to notice that in many species and certainly in ours, although males need not as you say make any contribution apart from their genes in principle, in fact males are heavy investors in offspring, albeit indirectly, so that must be important mustn't it and that must But the thing is that it seems that we're a cultural the way the system is set up Yeah I mean to begin with then obviously the female livelihood they depend on that primal investment it's, it's a situation the way that that it's divided up Well presumably the reason why the men do the hunting is that they're they figure they're more aggressive and are not gonna be pregnant or incumbent to children. Well,i i i i in that sense it's logical that they're the ones that do er the hunting and I guess the way it's set up logical I think Mm but I don't see, I'm trying to make it like a genetic connection or something I mean or some kind of like you know I mean to me it's just set up Yes, yes sorry Katherine? Erm I think well the which is erm which is directly extrapolated to like what happened now Mm. and there's this thing about I mean you know that there that we may be behaving, there may be erm ways that we behave that aren't actually functional th the, the society we've got now might not actually be functional because of the technology we've got Yeah well that's the problem Yeah. I mean Yeah then but when that becomes No, oh no, certainly not, but, but I mean before we get to the prescriptive level which is quite er a, a long way down the road, at the analytic level I think, I think Anne-Marie's point is she's trying to understand erm just what the the significances of these difference in parental investment are. Er the point I was making to her was erm in her paper which er was excellent by the way, I forgot to say and I think you put it all very clearly and very nicely,y you, you very nicely set out the basic idea that the consequence and that in principle a male need contribute nothing more than his penis. Th th the point that erm we were then discussing was that in practice of course males may,m ma may contribute a lot more an and, and the question was is this er something to do with the adaptions of our species or is it just the this was the question you, you asked me wasn't it? And Katherine's point was what the system today of course is quite different than what and that is of course completely true. Erm, the, the question remains however I mean er you, this is, this is your point really to what extent other other characteristics er may erm may be part of the same erm of the same thing for example if, look at sexual dimorphism. Human beings as we know are sexually dimorphic and tha that figure seems to fit the er the, the pattern, but erm women have a lot of characteristics that are peculiar to them, like for example erm more youthful looks, women will retain more youthful looks longer than men do and it is normally regarded as important and a lot of women spend an awful lot of money in the modern society on trying to remain erm looking er looking youthful. Now why is that? Could that be for example because males with resources would want normally to acquire youthful wives, or perhaps it might in other words it could be couldn't it that if males provide resources to females that they can use for primal investment, this would then have selective effects on females who will want certain things in order to get erm the investment and one of the things they might want to do is to look youthful. I dunno it kind of figures doesn't it or not? Alex looks very sceptical. No I don't, I'm still thinking about what you said yesterday about premature ejaculation Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. and younger men Th it all fitted together did it oh I oh I see I was sort of like more light-hearted sort of er like er got plenty of money, but it's crappy pay. Oh yes, I like the joke you know er er where one women says to another how could X possibly marry him you know Yeah he, he, he's Got a nasty cough, providing disorders you know he's short and ugly an and the other lady says to her but er you should see how tall he is when he stands on his wallet. I mean Yeah and he starts premature ejaculation Erm I mean it could be or it could be the reason why er why younger not Yes, I mean it's generally true isn't it I think of all societies I can't think of any o of, of any exceptions that it normally is older males who have more resources. I think in all societies I can't It can older males that Well gonna say you know yeah There's an interesting study in the book printed by Bergahoff, Moulder and so on all those you know there's four, thing, thing and thing erm human reproductive whatever it is, it's on the reading list, of Kipsigy Payments now that's, has anybody read that? Well that's interesting the Kipsigies are er traditional people who live in Kenya and if they have , in other words er men have to pay a certain amount to the erm you know, woman if they're gonna marry her and what they did was they study the and related it to the, to the girl that was actually getting married and what they found of course was that it fits the predictions of our theory er just as you'd expect, given that the cultural things you have to allow for like, like for example in that most traditional cultures they like er women to be plump as we'll see in the, in the actually fat is critical to female fertility and er so they might not have been plump, so what they did was they simply weighed the girls and they compared their, their, their weights with, with the, with the and sure enough strong correlation the fatter the girl, the bigger the . In a way they were and they had two they had two disabled girls, there are two girls who were erm you know physically er disabled, I forget what was wrong with them I think one had a clubfoot or something an and they were almost free they weren't completely free, but they were nearly free because of their disabilities and Yeah, exactly, so if, if you look at it in terms of the Kipsigy you know system, you can clearly see that what they showed was youth and plumpness were the critical fac an an and attractiveness, if the girl was young, plump and attractive she got a high and if the girl was older erm, if she had something wrong with her or she was skinny, then the less and that's, so it's quite interesting Did they find that the older men ? Well, yes now in fact we know they have not in that study. Now that doesn't the Kipsigy was just the study of the erm you know it's a good statistical it's good hard-hat social science you know with distribution and everything it's all good stuff, erm they don't say that, where we do know this is something I have researched myself very carefully, the Australian Aborigines erm we have rich data on this and I've read an awful lot of it and I compared notes with world authorities like David McKnight and erm erm what's his name erm Shapiro authority on this, and they agree that er that's definitely what happens. In Australian Aborigines the young, the young girls go to the er the older powerful men . Of course, if you think about it the consequences of that is these guys die and when they die, those wives that they married as young girls are now middle-aged women or possibly younger, anyway past their youth, but th th they, they may not be . Certainly they're re-marriageable and these are societies where every woman is married but no spinsters, so they're redistributed. Very often they have a bit of a say in it, because you know that the young girl hasn't got, but erm interestingly enough they tend to get recycled to young men and it's the older men that get the young girls from their older male and it's younger men who get . You can sometimes get a situation that occurs where a man is married to a woman who is in fact his grandmother, this can happen. This leads to horrifying you think that if you work if you, if you think about it, in other words he has married a woman who is the mother of a wife of his father who he calls mother. I happen to think this is the key to Australian classificated kinship society very stressful . What is really going on is they are rigging a system to hide that kind of it's clearly anonymous to marry a woman who's your grandmother. Yes, in the sense that y y i it can happen and apparently sometimes does that the young man will receive a recycled wife who is in fact the mother of a daughter who has married his father and so he calls her the daughter-mother, her actual mother is his wife. I see Absolutely and this is why I think they get round this, they've solved this problem by saying okay folks, we will adopt a purely erm classificator or in other words fictitious, rigged system of kinship and we won't call there and that's what they do. What effectively, I think, I mean I've never actually sat down because it would be an enormous mistake and nobody would thank me for it, but my guess is that those enormously complex classificated can be understood as a method by which old men rig the system for their own benefit and hide this kinds of ridiculous anonymous and the anomaly basically is the young men end up with old wives When they get older Right, that's what happens you see. When they get Could it be also that erm children I mean I dunno how they, the children are reared and what sort of situation . Could it be that er evolution in sort of Aboriginal societies are more harsher than that allowed for a more experienced man to teach a young child how to live as opposed to, it, it's beneficial for Yes experience That's right. Again that, that is, is very clear and it's representing initiation rituals. Because what happens you see in these societies and Australian Aborigines are with no exceptions is that if you want a wife if you're a young man and you want a wife you first of all gotta get initiated. There's no way you will get a wife until you are initiated. In fact you won't get any sexually mature erm er woman to have er any relationship with men, unofficial or otherwise if you're not initiated because they'll just say you're a boy and, and er and er an adult woman would feel it was demeaning you know to sleep with a mere boy, she'd insist you've got to be a man and to be a man you normally got to be initiated and that normally means being circumcised. Now the, the initiations are controlled by the elder men who have all, all the wives and if you don't behave and join the club and conform to what th the crown elders expect, you won't get initiated and i if you don't unless you say you won't get any wives and the guys who are doing the initiating the initiated are the very same guys who have all the daughters. So a young man really has to get initiated and conform to what the elders expect if he's going to have any reproductive success at all and that's exactly what happens. So these guys undergo these horrifying initiation rituals to prove you know that they want to join the club band and i if they pass the initiation test then they're joined in and then they're given a wife. In many societies David McKnight tells me the man who does the circumcision who actually chops off the foreskins as it were, owes you a wife for it and he says in many of them if you give a man your foreskin then you've got a right to demand a wife. He says he knows cases where wives weren't given, and there were then very serious er conflicts broken up, because the man who didn't get the wife then thought he'd been cheated and apparently his complaint was you know er wife I give you my foreskin. Apparently they talk like this. David McKnight says this is the language they use you know. Australian Aborigines are very direct about this so they, so they do expect something back for the initiation an and it's a kind of reciprocal thing where okay, you initiate me and I'll put up with all this crap from you, but you know, you give me a wife, you've got daughters I want a wife and er if I don't get it, there's gonna be real trouble and this is how the system works. So you're quite right, the elder men have a tremendous control, not over on the over-supply of women, but also over the younger men. How can that be beneficial I know what you're saying but Well I think the answer to that is you've got to remember this kind of hunting is cooperative and cooperative hunting does rely first of all on having other men to go hunting with you which is, which is important and also or so I'm told by people like David McKnight and Warren Shapiro an awful lot depends on information, we want to know where the game is, who saw what where, what did they catch you know, was there rainfall over the so and so ranges and so on, and you need to know that information if you're gonna be an effective hunter and you need good communication with other men. Er very often Australian Aboriginal societies you meet men the corroborees at these ritual gatherings and if you're one of the club, then in the ritual they'll tell you, they'll say hey, you know, you know you know you say where did you get all these kangaroos you know oh we got them over at the so and so ranges or down at the so and so water hole that's where they all are this week, and this is very important information for man. If you're not a member of the club and you're not accepted the rituals and people don't like you, they won't tell you and as a result you won't be an effective hunter, you won't be able to support many wives even if you wanted them and if you have wives what they needed, because if a man doesn't feed his wives they, they, they all eventually get up and go, they'll say two fingers you know, you can't feed us. This is one of the things I want you to se see today and this wonderful film I was gonna show today and I hope I'll show next week, third time lucky, they actually interview the wives, the polygynous wives of of some erm erm guy in Africa, some African erm and they to them they actually ask the wives, why do you, you know why are you married to this man and they say well he feeds us, you know th that's why we're married to him, he gives us food and he's apparently got five this particular man they interviewed, three of them were active and two of them were elderly, and the three active wives are quite open about the fact that this man's a good provider and therefore they stay with him, but they, they wouldn't in the case of Australian Aborigines, they wouldn't stay if they didn't get fed and they only get fed because he's a good hunter and to be a good hunter you need to go on good terms of men and that's how it works. But of course it's, it's a very tough deal for women, I mean women in erm in a way really get the raw end of it because that to some extent they're at the mercy of the whole system, even though they can if they absolutely have to. It's not easy and where's she gonna go? You know she's gotta find someone else to go an and live with because by and large you can't survive on your own in the Australian outback certainly not if you're a woman, hardly if you're a man. So it, it's as you say it's a very tough, hard life and in order to survive, people really do need the help of other people and that's why you've really got to conform to a large extent in the society and you haven't got a lot of choice about erm you know wh what you'd like to especially if you're, if you're young and female and not much men not if you want to get any wives that is. So the erm but as, but as Katherine reminds us, I mean if, if that's the kind of life our emotional parameters are my, my guess is that that, is that that's probably the truth, certainly a persuasive argument . Then when you look at the other range of human societies, then you have to say well you know how is it, how is it working out in other in other types of societies where all the basic erm conditions of life may be different and that of course is one of these big erm big and small problems that we still, we're still really at the at the starting point fact. I mean does anybody think that parental investment theory is relevant at all to modern industrial society or is it completely irrelevant ? Matthew you're a, you're a sceptic and a, and a, and a and an independent thinker what do you think? I don't know, I'm not very sort of convinced one way nor the other That sounds judicious. Dean? Well, I'm, I'm a supporter of it, which you know erm it, it strikes me being far more effective than other forms er of er explanation. How much ice does it cut in the modern industrial society? I think, I think it think it must cut quite a lot because I mean there's certain I don't these biological constraints. How would they show themselves I mean? What people to look you know in the modern society women don't have to rely on men or don't have to have traditional sex roles, this is a point of view isn't it? Well I think er I think, well I think you have to have, I mean I don't really parental investment and stuff like that gestation period. I think, I think that in any, I mean in, in, in, if you wanna, if you wanna look at it in terms I mean I think labour it it's always gonna have to be there and I think the biological constraints put the you know, sharpened device Well there are ways aren't there I mean even in traditionally, I mean what of wet-nursing I mean that's an example isn't it where a woman gets another woman to do the job for her. Darren is that, what point were you gonna make? Well I think, like I said two ways one is erm Mm Or if you look at it another way that is men and women are equal and we haven't yet got round that they are very different but they are equal. I dunno, er you know you can put woman staying at home having the child for instance when there aren't enough children to fill the schools realize that having children is a very important in economic values what with nations increasing staying at home Yes I must say I, I personally sympathy with that I mean I think that erm, women's er role is er very much despised and disparaged it should be because if you think about it they're having the children and bringing them up, well this is one of the most worthwhile things to do society you can't going to survive unless you have a woman back in the having the kids and we might see that as a you know you laugh when I say that, you know Well he doesn't survive, he might survive Alright, alright this is what I mean yeah, yeah but you know it's really difficult discussing this topic without people sniggering and getting all upset . It's that they have equal decisions, really so you can't say . It's only how we of behaviour Well but they are really equal because without one another, they're not gonna I don't think, I don't think it will, I think erm certainly from a cultural point of view the questions that comes up of erm in that type of society they think sod this I'm going hunting, but the fact of the matter is the men . I mean time of physiological difference and strength needs of their strength that they could just about fire a and he couldn't even pull them back and so they you know, fine if you wanna go hunting use the boat Yeah the arrows, but the Yeah, yeah and, it's but then it's a question of where a woman a woman could, but you know is it that easy to jump out cultural you know cultural investment provided by that and er you know y y y you and if a man is slightly stronger other way round so he can collect, collect more food and another argument which is that Yeah, it's the, it's the with the word natural isn't it that er you know people often use the word natural to mean good and right and therefore something you should do, but of course no not always I mean if I said to you death is natural, nobody here would think I was advocating suicide or that er we shouldn't have hospitals to try and save people's lives I mean er when you say death is natural, what you mean is death is one of those things that we just have to put up with, we'd rather we didn't but we're all gonna have to face it in the end, some of us sooner than others er but erm but there we are. However if you say erm oh well you know erm boys will be boys that's natural,tha that sounds as if you're kind of making excuses for them and condoning them, so I think you've got to be very careful about how you use the word natural and clearly it raises the whole question of how far you can, you can push erm cultural ideals against natural constraints an and what really is the issue. You see it may be that Dean's right I must admit I think I, I agree with Dean I think he is right that the real problem is that natural selection may have fitted us by, as it were, rigging our emotional system. It may be at a, at a truly rational level we can all perfectly well do all kinds of other things rationally on a truly rational level, because there we have this this er high degree of that comes with rationality, but at a deeper, kind of gut level,the emotional feelings we, we find that it's, it's much more difficult, and at that point if you don't try and change things and do things that are unnatural, you find you're kind of going against the emotional grain and er perhaps some people find it easier than others, but perhaps everybody will feel a certain erm tug as it were, certain erm discomfort or a certain emotional alienation from themselves which er perhaps is because we're trying to do something more basic we just weren't designed for. I don't know I mean this would Would you sympathise with that Dean? Yeah, yeah question so, so we're, we're saying that the difference between male and female roles in this disruptive selection. Sorry remind us what you mean by disruptive selection again. Where, well where er disruptive selection i i i is very huge differences between men, male and female and this was then accentuated over a period of time Oh I see what you mean yes, fine, okay. Okay, so are, so, so it's just tha tha tha that along with this a psychological context, so you got a biological and psychological going hand-in-hand simultaneously. Yes, I mean this is the point I'll be developing later, later in, in, in the lectures, I'm currently spending a lot of time kind of researching and thinking about this, but i i it's ultimately the question of genes affect behaviour and more and more I come to the to the view that they probably do so erm through what we call our emotions, that our genes kind of erm guide us to do so and things through various subjective feelings like when we're hungry, we, we know we're hungry and it's a subjective feeling of hunger. What is actually happening of course we know in that case what is actually happening, because nerves erm er neurones in, in the base of the brain are actually sampling the blood flow as it goes through with sugar level and when the sugar level drops to a critical point, some of those neurones start to fire and as they fire gradually the message is passed on up to the higher brain centres and eventually you get the feeling you're hungry. Now, you, you're, that's a subjective feeling, you don't actually know that there are neurones in your blood sugar level, but you, you certainly know when you need something to eat and it, it's a kind of subjective feeling and it's not farfetched in the least to claim that our genes have rigged our brain in that way to do that because obviously we'd like to have more reproductive success if you know when you're hungry than when you don't and it may be that a lot of, in a lot of other ways genes affect our, our behaviour through similar erm effects, that is subjective feelings we have, often of an emotional nature to make us want to do certain things and an an and dislike doing others, and it may be that we, we're really kind of lumbered with that. Why is it in the genes why is it people are able to adjust their diets Well, oh yes, I'm sure I'm not saying that's the only thing that controls people's food intake I mean clearly there are things cultural some cultures, the Japanese seem to love eating raw fish, I mean how they can bring themselves to do it I do now know, I mean the raw is I don't think I'd want to eat again, but er erm not always if they were cooked either, but erm the, the er and certainly if you look at the Australian Aborigines even though we take the Australian Aborigines as our kind of primeval people, they have astonishing food taboos, I mean their attitudes to food are very very culturally er effective to, to a quite extraordinary extent, some so that somebody somebody discovered that eating a tabooed food by accident, they'll get very ill, a kind of psychosomatic illness. So I'm not saying th th that there aren't these th the important other inputs, but, but what I am saying is that if you ask yourself where the kind of gene behaviour interface really exists is clearly in the human er in, in the human mind and it may be that the basic kind of parameters erm have, have been set for our emotions and I really don't see how we can change those. I was thinking for instance when you have generation of young men how do you, what's the time left to something extreme can be done culturally and people can be sort of you know convinced that they're right and that they go out there and get machine guns can be done culturally, whereas Well it may be of course that that kind of thing has always tended to happen gather of society skirmishing goes on and young men are expected to go and find very often Yeah, yeah, more immediately, but I mean when they're sort of it has Well then I agree, then I, then I think you do need a fairly sophisticated psychological theory to try and explain er how that could come about. That's one of the reasons why I'm, why I'm also interested in er in Freud because I think Freud provides that, I happen to think that Freud's studies of, of crowd group psychology actually explain that, although it takes time to you know, certainly not at five minutes to four, it takes time to explain, but I think there is an explanation there and I think you c y y you can claim that there are certain emotions to do with identification and idealization,th that our genes have a programmer which things like erm nationalistic erm, erm er kind of jingoism can exploit in a modern culture which in primal cultures would have primal cultures people identify with their, with their local kin and their local culture and that's that might ultimately promote their reproductive success, but that in modern cultures, this identification occurs with erm on a completely different level and with lots of people will not merely because you need so many more people modern cultures you have much more erm much bigger groups and you just meet many more people that, than you were ever th there is some interesting research, research recently published for instance which shows erm organizations seem to have a critical size and that people are not really able to track more than about two hundred and fifty other people, in other words you can have face-to-face relationships with up to about two hundred and fifty others, but once it gets beyond two hundred and fifty it's too much and you start forgetting somebody as if the brain was primed to an optimum group size and once you get above that you just can't keep . Have you read about that? That's right, I would say so Yeah That's right, yeah yeah. Yeah That's right yeah. Is there also something to do what's happening in Eastern Europe . They say you know Swiss Well you see the, the, the great Soviet experiment is a good example isn't it of, of a whole civilization was based on a o o on a kind of great social experiment was based on ultimately on erm unsound principles and then a part of the scenes. Er and I suppose the great you know lesson of social sciences in, in some ways if it's, if it's for anything it ought to be to try and avoid that kind of disaster, because erm if we understood ourselves better we might you know in the future try and avoid that thing because we just wouldn't attempt if, if that wasn't an attempt to be . So erm I mean the justification for this kind of course I would claim is ultimately to try and make people more realistic about what is possible and er the, because th th the advantage of knowing what's possible is you can avoid impossible experiments that ultimately result in disaster for everyone. Well sceptical silence, but that's what I'd like to think that we, we were doing. Well yes. Drug, anti-drug legislation may be another thing. Of course drugs is, is one of the wonderful examples that the very thing that Katherine was talking about, something that wasn't there in the beginning and that has been produced by modern technology and is now a big problem, but is not a problem to Australian Aborigines because they don't have any drugs er to speak of, of course now they do and alcohol is a terrible problem with Australian Aborigines I talked to David McKnight about it. Absolutely awful . Well the Australians are at least trying to didn't have much success apparently Really? and they went loco Folks it's four o'clock erm just a second erm just before you go let me remind you next week it's Laura. Okay? And Darren we gotta, I'll see you in just a sec. Hello. Ah really? Erm, who, who gave you the message? Oh er, I, I don't think I ra I don't think I rang you actually, er I wonder if the message was from someone else. Erm, I do need to see you some time erm let me just just see erm, but I've got your erm your last term's report here that we need to meet to discuss. Er, could, could we make a date? Erm, as I said it wasn't me that phoned originally, my guess is that there may be somebody else at the school who is trying to contact you, but while you're on the line, let's just make a little let's just make a little date. Erm what about, when would be convenient for a quick tutorial? What about Thursday? Right. What about next week, what about Monday? Right y your day off, well that means you don't want to come into the school? Okay next Monday, what time would suit you? Right. Right. Could we make it at erm two P M? Right, that's two P M next Monday the first February, okay. See you then. As I said I didn't phone, I dunno who it was. Erm, it might be an idea to try and get hold of him whoever took the message cos it might be something important, but anyway I'm glad you phoned. Thanks, bye . Right now, sorry to keep you waiting for a minute. Erm, now did we, did we do your reports? No. Right, let's, let's do that first cos that's important. Erm, I'll have to sign the form. There we are, right. Right I got all four here of course I didn't bother to write a comment cos I'm delighted. I've given you an A for participation B plus for written work and that gives you an average of B which is good or excellent. So that's alright there's no problems there. Now Mr 's philosophy Aha. has given you A for participation which is good, C for written work which is satisfactory and B minus for assessment, so it actively participates er gave a paper for the class, but no second essay. Does that mean you owe him an essay or something? No,essays, you got both you've got two essays. Well, right he's, this was probably written before he got the second one, because they would have done this last term They were handed in on time, handed in on time. Well, perhaps you ought to bring that He marked them both. I should raise that with him He's marked them both Has he? Yeah. Right. I mean I got pretty bad marks I find it difficult, find it very difficult. Really? Well, it's frustrating the hell out of me you know. Why's that? I've never done any ooh well.

I now it's putting it on I thought the long fingering of man should was a lovely expression Where was that, you said that? Isle of Isle of oh Isle of and they sh what she went on to say is erm I hope to redress this in the shortly in other words she's shortly going to but I must say I like the expression long fingering you know bloody idle you know. Mm. So you haven't got it back? No, no she said she's gonna redress the balance very shortly. Erm when I find my glasses I Now I've got to leave at three thirty. Okay well we'll Okay Kath, right. Erm let me just see if I've got a I made a whole page of notes here dunno whether any of its important. Erm I've got the Observer Ghost Story winners we can leave that for another week. Erm the talks erm Gillian Thornton is gonna speak to us on the 23rd of February just to remind you and I've actually prepared some notes on play writing which we can fit in some time during this sort of session. Erm homework I'm Come and sit down Janet. Ann Hello, Well let me just say quickly we're being recorded there's there's someone er who's gotta er a project organisation by the Oxford University Press who's interested in our spoken word Right and he's going to ask each of us to sign a a permission form in the end, because we have our we all own the copy right you know our own spoken word and er in order that this man can use what we actually speak today, is showing to want us individually to sign a form. I don't think there's any sort of danger in it it's it's in fact for use in constructing a dictionary really. Erm so it's they're really interested in our use of language. Erm I told you about that chap Michael Bell who wrote to me about using my book as play, I'll read you his letter some other week. Erm John's Dream the National Playwright's Network actually wrote back to me and said they're quite happy to read your plays for a fee erm but I intend to re-write that before I put it in er for a reading erm Oh,I I sent a poem called Pleasure to Woman's Weekly in June last year and I suspect they were actually planning to use it but they've had a New Year's clear-out and I got it back yesterday. Erm Foxes in the Garden with the R S P C A photos I had rejected yesterday as well, so that was a good day. Erm I brought in the old flurry tape,I 've I've taped I taped our when you've read my play for me, I erm I taped it and I made a copy for Dave I you know, erm Cybil makes a good effort in that so eventually I'll lend you the tape. Yeah that's eventually I'll lend you the tape for that erm we can pass it round. Erm Mr. Parish I mentioned, sorry your name is Jim? Jim Jim did you say? Jim and he's proposing to listen to the group today with the views to joining. Jim has written, like myself his background is in technical writing for a living and he's gotta particular interest in American writers and the use of American language er I gather. Right well I'll start today if you don't mind and we'll go round in the normal way erm when we come to Pat. Pat has got five thousand odd words to read to us, so if we can scoot round fairly quickly today. Well we'll leave him till last if he's got Yeah well that's, what I was like that yeah In other words you know you What I was Pat is five thousand words is really too bit a bite you know if you really want people to criticism off it, you wanna break it down into sort of two thousand word chapters really. I couldn't get to the first part again and yeah that's right Even though you you feel it's off your back you've written, you can still read it out I could go er that wouldn't be a bad idea, because part of it would make sense to finish. Yeah well if you like. Yeah. You know five thousand It is quite a lot to read I mean I read a short story last week. Two seven . It was Two Seven and that even seems quite long you know to That's right It's quite long in the reading five thousand is as Yeah as Cybil mentioned you know I mean if if we want to criticise your first ten words it comes a bit hard up to five thousand you know. something that makes sense to carry on Mm Okay Can I just mention that nobody's read that but you'll see the last sentence says that whatever you put on that tape the dictionary keep the copyright you see and that's all right when you're on conversations, but if you were to to read in an and it was a short story, if that's you know i if they reserve Very observant yes, yes but Jim makes the point he said that if if if when you sign a declaration you say Er yeah exclude your short story, otherwise it could mean on you know it could be taken out and sold somewhere and then in interest you would sell your own for selling your own word you know that could be a possibility. Well nobody's really saying in case when any of us sign it, we must sign excluding the written work yes, yes, yeah read out and if you exclude it, I think if all us do that the best thing is to read something we've already had published. Well I think it's something like that Oh, the one that keeps up to date and updates the Oxford English Yeah, I think Even so, I think as David says, it would probably be wise to exclude your exclude your written work. I mean by the piece I'm reading you today, I've already submitted to the B B C and if I sell it if it's something that's If if they they take it, then I've sold the copyright to the B B C and I'm not in a position to offer it to anybody else anyway erm So will the tape last for the whole two hours? Yes, apparently. B B C. Yes. I don't want any of your bad language Janet . Right well let me just surely . This this is I I I'll start off as I say I've I've written a covering letter to Bank and Mitchell of the B B C and I I thought I'd read you the letter as well, because the letter does what we've often said about setting the block plan. Erm I say I enclose a short story for your consideration. In this story the principal character is a grumpy old house with a malevolent sense of humour. It is newly occupied by a young couple. In the first conflict situation the house launches a minor attack on the wife whilst possibly saving the husband from real harm. The couple settle in. Minor conflicts occur with the couple trying to pacify her, this continues up to a black moment when the house relents and saves them and then I say and this is important I think when you write for a radio, I have marked one paragraph with red brackets. This paragraph is optional depending on the reading speed. Without it, my version occupied a few seconds under fifteen minutes. The play is written for a Hertfordshire accent or similar and then you know I enclose and I say return if you don't like it. Incidentally Janet, did your piece ever come back or erm Yes Oh, it's come back. Came back. Oh. Oh Was it the Black Dog? No, that came back after all that time erm,no this this was the call called The Birthday it was about a split in the future where she erm Oh yes was a little girl on her fifteenth birthday and has it it's like an M O T Certificate, only it's an M O L Certificate for life that you have to do after your sixty five. Well I sent it to the B B C, I sent it to Duncan but I also sent it to the the Lady a shorter version to the Lady their competition and I said their competition was gonna be on the eighteenth in their issue they would give the names of the of the winners, but I had looked in the Lady yesterday in Smiths and there was none of nothing about it, but I don't think I've won anyway because it said you'd be notified by post so. that they run late on Yes it does. I've had one away five months to but I I I No, but this has been published It's been published December the fourteenth and I haven't had my copy yet which was in Central England. Oh,Central England. Yes Yours was sent to sent on to the charity work. Oh, you did do it and I didn't. Very important. Right I'll read you this piece and you'll have to forgive my facsimile of a Herts. accent. Home sweet home my Roy Ramsay. We fell in love with the cottage at first sight. It was snowing the January day we moved in. The cottage was old and grumpy, she didn't make us welcome. Cottage means small house. This house was large and had four bedrooms. She didn't like her name, she didn't like anything. I was a young man, I was virile and vigorous. She didn't like me . I well remember our first night with the aid of father-in-law we spent a long day moving ourselves in. He was in a van and two estate cars we made many short journeys. We'd loaded and unloaded furniture, tools, books and crockery, the contents of house and garage, greenhouse, garden and shed. The cottage had solid brick walls, none of your modern self-insulating cavities. The ancient boiler had sat in sullen silence for ten days, a drifting cave under a mountain would have offered more comfort. The rooms were too chilly for the youngsters, so we left with mother-in-law. I bought some coal and lit the sulky boiler. Four hours later the cottage had allowed the temperature to rise a degree above freezing. We made a last cup of tea on the camping stove and retired midnight. We lay awake all night startled by strange sounds. We was too cold to sleep, to exhausted to search out extra blankets from unlabelled tea chests. Holding each other close we wondered if this was a senseless move from a tiny cosy semi. In the morning the fire was cold and the cottage once more below freezing, she burst a boiler. While I was making some tea there was a tremendous crash. Me wife screamed. I flew up the stairs to find a huge hole in the ceiling, at the foot of the bed covered with plaster and ice. Water ran from the hole. Of course at that time we didn't realise she'd done it on purpose. We had just finished finding the wife some dry clothes when there was an explosion downstairs. The camping stove had blown up. At least I was upstairs when it happened, no-one was hurt. We waited, tea-less all day for the gas man to connect the cooker. We had fish and chips from the local chippy for lunch, dinner and supper. The fire had a good appetite too in the cold, we burnt exactly one ton of anthracite in that freezing January. Life got back to normal, we picked up our bearings. The back of the house faces south, an avenue of giant elms and a few old oaks lay over that way. The house on our western side had been empty for years. It's back garden was a jungle. Among lots of small trees was seven fifty foot black it's front garden held two mighty elms. I loved the trees, but having this forest next door, made sure our garden only saw the sun as he moves from east to west early in the morning. The rest of the day we never saw him. We loved our home in the woods down in the lane. She didn't love us. Outside, the cottage walls were a horrible battleship grey, the woodwork was depression brown. The interior was dull and decrepit with lots of layers of ancient wallpaper. My wife and I loved a challenge in those days and we could see what it might become with hard work, but it was a real challenge, no mistake. We tackled the house bravely enough, we started with the childrens bedrooms. Next we did the kitchen and breakfast room where we fits an efficient gas boiler. We battles on in dining and sitting rooms. We found out that the sitting room had a timber panelled ceiling which had been papered over and given lots of coats of whitewash. Father-in-law and me soldiered six weeks to restore it looks now. We papered and painted two big bedrooms, bathroom and toilet. We installed bigger radiators everywhere we went. We began to win the temperature battle. Lastly, worst of all the landing hall and stairs, all those doors, all that white paint. Several times the cottage tried to throw me from the scuffle boards, one night she succeeded, I got a badly twisted ankle. I told her you won't defeat me. Next year my wife starts in earnest on the gardens, driving back to Blackberry and Elver, while I experiments with the outside colour scheme. All the walls I gives three coats of brilliant white stone paint, easier to say than to do. Black and white seemed a suitable work, the front door was painted long yellow. As I say, the back of the house faces south, the summer sun was on the upper frames all the time. He soon blistered the glass in black. With a fight the frames were changed to white and yellow which reflects the heat rather than absorb it. Time passed, we improved the house. I hoped she'd begin to feel grateful. We fitted new carpets, lamps and staircase. One summer I changed both sets of French windows for doors with Georgian frames. I give myself one hundred and twenty new panes to varnish round, who says we grows wiser as we grows old. The house grinned. The owner of the near-ruined house next door came and had his forest felled to sell the property. We gained a sunny outlook and some neighbours to enjoy. The house smiled. The let in some afternoon sun which burnt the still black paint on the front paint work. I saw what she'd been smiling at. We settled for yellow and white all round. The two boys shared a bedroom, the spare room was our office, the boys were six years apart in age. In a few years their needs were very different, the young one needed to be in bed and the older one wanted to play music with his friends. Then my wife had her brain wave. There was a wide space beside the staircase, the stairs rose up to the boys' bedroom wall, then turned left to join the landing. On the landing the first door on the left opened up a walk-in cupboard. Why not, my wife says, knock a hole through the boys' bedroom wall, pinch a three foot six strip off it and make a new landing passage and extend the walk-in cupboard, forward to take up the old landing and sideways to build a space out to the main part of the stairs. It was brilliant. When the work started the house was furious, she put every possible obstacle in the way of the builders and arranged for it to rain as soon as the slates come off. She made sure all the plumbing and wiring was in the path of progress. Every hole drilled in the walls met a stone, she blunted every tool. When everything was finished, the younger boy moved in. For weeks we bumped into strange doors whilst making our way to bathroom and toilet in the dark. The house chuckled. At last, to pacify her, we fitted a new bathroom. That magnificent cottage suite with gold- plated fittings should have pleased her. She showed no sign. To prevent her playing nasty tricks on us we had all the old lead and iron pipes taken out and the rust galvanised tanks replaced with trusty burst-proof fibreglass. We thickened up the insulation in the loft to deaden the midnight sound of her dropping chips of toil on our bedroom ceiling. At last, I thinks I seeks her problem. In the dead of night I crept down to the breakfast room, the nerve centre. Listen house I says, you are not a small house, the cottage never was suitable. We are going to change your name, we are going to call you the Wallering Remember Christopher Robin, his wise old house spelt his name Wal We're going to name you for the elms at the foot of the garden. In a fit of temper she arranged for all the surrounding elms to catch Dutch Elm Disease and quickly died. This drove out the tawny owls. She could be a nasty devil in those days. Suddenly I was struck down by an illness. When I was at me lowest me wife beat me, she excelled herself and managed magnificently when the family's happiness depended on it. I went blind in me right eye overnight. At first I could find no cause, I panicked, if I could go blind in one eye without a cause, perhaps I could go blind in the other. I could become a burden to me wife and family, not only that, if I couldn't pay the mortgage they might throw us out of the cottage. I started two schemes, first I increases the monthly payment on the mortgage, then I starts a separate savings account. Gradually the mortgage comes down and the savings goes up, but there's still a gap. Then, bugger I down dead if she didn't get me. I was painting the back of the house one Saturday, when she shook me off the ladder, I got a compound fracture on me left leg. Well, I'd had so much time on the sick, they put me on half pay. I couldn't pay the mortgage. Things got very black indeed. The bank was hard, they them pay for crimes their family had committed over the last sixty years or whatever. So in actual fact they, they they, they, they didn't pay it back they give up their land Mm. and so it was just another way of Right. during rent reduction ? Yes. Was it, during accounts it was. Was it? During Mm Bu bu bu but why why is that happening? Because wh when, when we were looking at, at, at the I mean sort of things the implication to me seemed to be that, that this in itself is a successful policy, rent reduction, interest rate reduction methods improving er productivity, increasing input, in themselves are satisfying the demands of the peasantry and you would not need to go beyond that, I mean well didn't need to, he isn't the ideal, but he didn't need to go and he, he was doing very well out of it. S so, so where is this radicalization coming from? I mean is it that the rent reduction interest rate reduction is not working and in order for the peasant to get enough for themselves, they needed to go further? Or are they just greedy and saying well we're doing quite well out of rent reduction, but if we, you know if we the landlords, we're gonna get some more? I think the fact that the Japanese had surrendered must have something to do with it cos then they probably had a chance to attack the people who'd er collaborated with the Japanese. Right. they wouldn't just accept rent reductions from Right so after nineteen forty five there cer there certainly would have been a momentum towards this in the areas where there'd been a strong Japanese presence because there would be more collaborators and there would be some more obvious targets. Mm. But in the old liberated areas like say around i i i in theory none of this should be necessary, very little of it should've been happening. Yeah. But it might also be happening where the Communist Party have provided some sort of secure physical presence and where if, as a result of past exploitation, there was a substantial degree of antagonism towards landlords which, it would be that that was carried out. But it, it needn't necessarily be erm the kind of direct material gain in terms of well we need to go beyond rent reduction because rent reduction is not, hasn't given us enough, because in theory rent reduction ought to be giving you as much you need. Maybe the erm peasant er their desires are just growing and, you know, reduction I, I want a bit more. Right. A subtle change in psychology. Yes. They also had I just think it was a momentum that was caused by some villages feeling safer from the nationalists as they got further and further from the front and therefore more and more people a bit f erm being willing to sort of talk again, shout up against the, the landlords and as they saw, as they saw that their neighbours were getting land, all the others decided well they're getting land, we might as well talk to, have a talk about them the problems and the harsh treatment that we've had in, in years before. So what's happened to our moral economy? cos you're an opportunist. Yeah. Mm. Just, just like that, almost? Yeah, I think Well you've got a lot of nationalism as well cos er a lot of them article forty seven when they, they said that the problem of the nation was the result of the landlords, and so there's all this sort of nationalist and there's also Mm. party erm line saying that, identifying anyone with any power in the community as er well you can identify them so therefore you've already got that directive and then you've got Yes. you imply that it's er I mean quite easily Right, yes. Yes. But if, if we, if w we accepted the moral economy, which was that the peasant has a, a view of what is right and fair and once that fairness is established for him, that's it, he doesn't want to go any further than this. What we're, in effect what we're saying is that for a a number of years the Communist Party has provided, has made that moral economy work i in a s and made it work very well because rents have been reduced more than the peasants would expect erm er interest rate is extremely low. The conditions of the moral economy have been met, okay the landlords have been forced to if one accepted that was the way in which the peasants saw the world they would not have gone beyond that. I i in a way, way th that they're going beyond it not because the Party's encouraging them to do it, but because they're doing it themselves. Now does that call into question the, the moral economy at all? Does, does it call into question the fact that that was really what the peasants did think and believe, or were the peasants opportunists, and if they felt they could get away with anything they would get away with anything? Isn't it more the case that it's not so much what they're trying to get away with, it's just that how what was happening the peasants did see the world that they were in but with the Communist Party and the revolution that the idea is to change the way the peasants see the world and how they view themselves Right. which is what Right. So they're changing the way structures, their possibilities I mean at one stage they would have been at a certain level hadn't got a landlord their income but that's within one particular moral economy, now the idea here is to break that down, you know, just get rid of the circle altogether. But also the moral economy low rates so presumably means less of the sort of loyal so presumably, you know, with all this in the earlier period that erm people are gonna be, you know, have less ties towards with people, traditional ties, it's much more , so they would just see people who were higher up in society with more other people with, with, you know rather than Right. Yeah Within, oh sorry. Within the moral economy there was potential for them to be revolutionary though because erm you had this sub-culture which was Yes. very much part of, which ran alongside this moral economy Mm. and so when the system clearly wasn't working, the peasants would form their own collectives and Yes. erm supporting agencies and stuff so it's not necessarily running against the the idea of a moral economy, just that moral economy developing its revolutionary potential Yes. and that's what Mao saw in nineteen twenty seven. Right. Yes. So obviously there are a number of one is that i it may be that the old moral economy worked because the peasants recognized that, in a sense, that was the way they w well they, they could not stand up and criticize the landlord th the, the most they could do was to try and get the landlord to behave in a reasonable way, and that within that there would then be the sub-culture, the counter-culture of, of beginnings of mutual aid and what is happening in is in part that the communists are making them think the old moral economy work, but in part they are picking up on those sub- culture bits because the, the, the whole of mutual aid idea is, is coming from existing peasant cooperations. But what they're doing which is more important than that, they are beginning to change the way in which the peasant sees the world. Er that they are changing a whole range o of non-economic variables which allow the peasant the world to see the world doesn't have to be like this we can actually question the landlord and not only can we get away with it but we can get something out of it. And once that has begun to change, the peasant is off because he, he, he, he's begun to see a new world that he can realize. How widespread now is erm the education movement now in you have much more schools, now is this spreading? Erm tt yes but not er er w w once, once the war education finishes, we are talking about the, the whole of north China right the way through Manchuria Right. erm I E you've got an enormous area where sometimes you're moving in very quickly, and particularly in Manchuria y you're trying to get there extremely quickly, and you, you haven't got the time to build up that kind of infrastructure, but that is gonna come later. So I, I don't think it's there er and it can't be created quickly enough. Mm yeah. Also what struck me was now that they they're not fighting the Japanese erm they're not required to make the sacrifices of war that they were so perhaps they're going to think right let's see what we can make out of this, I don't, I no longer have to pay X tax because Right. there are no more soldiers to maintain Yes. what can I do, well I mean the there are, but I mean well they're not, it's not as expensive is it, once your The, the Party's not gonna reduce its tax but it's, it's fighting the at least as expensive as fighting But surely the the, some of the burdens on the peasants surely gotta be less now that they're no longer fighting the Japanese as well. But then why would Mao in nineteen forty five say that how that they'd made a major concession to land to the tiller but that this is a correct one and they're going to, that land reform has to be taken in stages and they're going to first of all reduce rent and, I mean er Yes, that's what you're implying is that how that they had a radical policy in mind but because of the war it had to be moderated but I, somehow I tend to believe the reverse, that how that they may have continued the moderate policy but was forced into it because of circumstances to, forced to erm into radicalizing their policies. The they certainly moved back to radicalization much more quickly than Mao had, had expected Mm. erm and that presumably in, in part is because there is this radical groundswell from the peasants in, in part because it would need a new policy after nineteen forty five wouldn't you because not just on, on the financial side but er er a lot of your mobilization has come through,a as you say, nationalism now once the Japanese are defeated, that's finished. You've also lost your easy targets in terms of up until that point you could always very legitimately attack Japanese collaborators. Now you y you, you've gotta find a substitute for that. Don't you also attack the church? In effect you, you, you, you, you've got the church, you've got erm you, you might sort of move from collaborators with the Japanese to collaborators with the Kuomintang, I E the counter-revolutionaries. So you would still be able to identify targets but those targets may become a bit more general, I E because in the past the landlord as a class had always sided with the Kuomintang then i it gives you the opportunity to go back and attack them, almost the landlords per se in a way you couldn't during the Japanese war because clearly loyal landlords were fighting the Japanese. But, but you need a new set of targets anyway, and somehow you,y y you've gotta and the May the fourth directive, by returning to land reform is beginning to open up those as possibilities. How widespread were the accounts described by ? I mean that's just one village, or one county that he's described but how widespread throughout the north Yes. it's almost a bit No I, I think there is, there is a lot of evidence that this is happening in all of the villages Right. er and in some villages they went a great deal further than they did in, in Right. erm but, but certainly the, the er er the period has given the Communist Party er quite a large number of trained cadres which will be able to go out into the villages in a way that they hadn't been able to in because it would, that was all too soon. But through, through erm the period, particularly after campaigns in nineteen forty one, forty two, you, you, you've got a l a lot of people coming into the Party, then they've all been instilled with the spirit, you can then send them out into the villages. Erm they are going into the villages, they're making contacts with individual peasants erm it's those peasants that, that they get to stand up and make the first accusations, it's those peasants who join the Party erm and the process can build up in, in a way which was more difficult before then. So, so you, you, you have got this basis for mass mobilization together with some of the education Mm. Okay shall we s stop there and have a ? We'll go on to the, the itself. Right. Okay so we, we, we've the May the fourth directive, er we, we, we've now got the May the fourth directive operational. Tt erm and the, the next thing is the outline agrarian law, so let's, let's have a look at this. First of all what what is the outline law saying and secondly why is tho those particular provisions necessary? What's, what's the outline er agrarian law all about and what's, what's ? Well in effect it says that how that it's now the Party is sanctionalizing absolute egalitarianism, the aim that landlords, K M T officers, everyone's going to get equal distribution of land. It also erm pr it's protecting commerce and industry and that ess essentially i it's, absolute egalitarianism means that everybody within the village or the Mm. the , everybody will acquire the same land and the same quality of land. Yes, and that no gonna be given to C C P cadres or to, or to landlords Right. it's just Is, is, is that different to any other land law before, is well is, is this a new idea or is it just picking up on other equalizing quantity and quality, that's, that's an old idea isn't it? Yeah. Mao's policies Right. Is, is, is it any different at all from, from that land law of Mao's in nineteen thirty? In, in effect. Was this erm differences in quality to be made up by more land? Or was it the same amount of land ? Erm i in, in in theory if you, if, if you balance quantity and quality everybody should end up with the same. But with Mao's law it wasn't complete erm egalitarianism because landlords erm rich peasants were to receive less, they were meant to be penalized weren't they? No not within, that's, that's within the nineteen forty one law. Surely in, in the nineteen thirty law Mao's Mao's policy was, was in effect absolute egalitarianism in that everybody within the village,in including, depending how you read those definitions, Mm. but including possibly landlords or at, at the very worst their families would have a share of land. Mm. So i i i in a sense this has gone back to one of Mao's early views, except that, that there is a difference now in that er the land is being redistributed for ownership whereas for Mao earlier it was, it was for your use. Although it's it's slightly unclear to me you know because if you take article two it's land ownership rights of all landlords are abolished, but then you're distributing land back for their ownership so it's not quite clear what's happening with that. the way to do it Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it's their past rights over Yes. Right so even, even landlords, within this absolute egalitarianism policy, are now to get land. So ev ev everybody in the village will end up with the same amount. few exceptions. criminals. Right. Yes, fair enough, yeah. Okay. So It's, they have it for ownership instead of state owned Yeah. because of their erm desire to increase production. The Right. Communist Party thought that how that by giving peasants their own land it would give them the incentive to increase production which Yes. they needed to Right. And as, as you said, the one exception to all of this is industrial and commercial property. Mm. So anything that a landlord or a rich peasant had owned in terms of industry or commerce would be left alone and i it would still be his. So you, you were in a sense equalizing land ownership but you were not equalizing incomes. You were not equalizing assets. In, in many ways there's, well there's as well is that repeat a lot of the things that are said Yes. word for word but just sort of changing the vocabulary isn't it? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Right. because landlords were seen as progressive and they might want, they di the erm communists didn't want to get rid of them as a class but in their feudal capacity. Right. So this is very much part of the mass line. Th th th this is, it is a mass line at work,th th th there's very little in here in terms of class antagonisms. Erm i i it's more about landlords sort of being reintegrated into a new mass society. Isn't it, well I mean, isn't it more about just keeping production up? Mm. I mean that's what I thought this movement towards egalitarianism isn't, doesn't actually reflect any change in ideology at all. Right. Yeah. Okay so wh why then do we go from the May the fourth erm directive into this specific idea of, of egalitarianism? What, what, why I mean Well i i i in a sense it is a, it is a shift to the left because under the May the fourth directive erm rich peasants in particular would've been left out of it altogether and there would still be some landlords who were, who would maintain their property but, but now he's shifted to the left and this, this does represent a further attack on landlords cos, cos everybody comes down to the same level. Well I think you can look at it on two levels and one, one reason is to change the Party structure shake them up a bit, cos there's, there's evidence that they were erm you know moving to the right and allying with er rich peasants and landlords, and the other, on the level is actually having a policy which would get mass support and this obviously would require incentives in the form of land to peasants. Right. So that, is the basic drive behind this to provide a greater incentive for the, the majority of peasants to support, actively support the Party? Mm. Why, why is that needed though? Wh why is Cos the military situation that it er well from er says you know they realized, apparently, that it was gonna take at least seven years to win over the nationalists so they Right. might need more support. And this Right. was one way of getting it. Right. So th th th there's, there's a heightened need for support because of the the nature of the civil war now, and, and they are under quite substantial pressure and therefore you need to mobilize the population behind you and to get that mobilization you, you've got to offer more struggle fruits to the peasants and absolute egalitarianism is the way to offer them the maximum. But their two aims conflicted because on the one hand they're trying to protect production and to allow erm er capit private enterprise and capitalism to develop but on the other hand they're erm trying to redistribute all the land er because the May the fourth directive wasn't going far enough, they, they needed to be more severe upon landlords Yes. and erm and so it appears, if you just take this document at this time, that how that they're placing less emphasis upon production, I mean if their aim is to, if their primary aim is to mobilize mass support that how that production was going to decrease because it was gonna infringe upon rich and middle peasants. Right. Right. So but w w w why is that you need absolute egalitarianism? Why, why have you got to go for equality? Cos that's one of the communist . Perhaps I mean it's, we don't know in nineteen, October nineteen forty seven whether the Communist Party actually really did think that absolute egalitarianism might be able to work. So so It was only the events afterwards that proved that it didn't work, but they weren't clear at this time So it's ideology which is driving it. So that, that, that we are now back into socialism, we, we're sort of now back into our communist ideals. Well that's a possibility. Right. It certainly wouldn't be against the ideological er ideas of the Party but I mean that it was an ideological , it was more practical cos it was, it was related the purification campaign of the Party, cos we know they're having these campaigns Right. Yes. the May the fourth directive, after Right. and they found a lot of, you know, serious crimes going on in the Party and stuff Yes. like that. Right. It could be both, it could be pragmatic but also erm furthering the communist cause. Well why did they just, why was it rejected Right two months later then? Because it was shown to not work. Yeah exactly. Well in other words the pragmatic consideration's far more important than the ideological one is. Yes. But we're looking at it with hindsight, we can't just say that because of this this that and the other erm that pragmatism did overrule at this particular point in time. Oh I dunno, I dunno. I think Mao was quite keyed up on the whole situation, I think he realized that to win the war they had to erm adjust the mass support very carefully, and I think that's basically what this I think that's why two months later they er they er gave up this document cos he was worried then they'd lose the middle peasants' support. Is, is, is, yes, is there another element to this though, that what in, in your new more difficult military situation you need to mobilize the mass of support behind you, which er essentially means mobilizing the poor peasants is it possible that within the May the fourth directive, although the poor could have done much better, they need not necessarily do very much better. I E th there, there is no guarantee within the May the fourth directive that, that the poor do significantly a as a group all do well because th th they, they, they, there's nothing to guarantee that they all share properly in the fruits of struggle. No. No. after they had come forward with this Right. directive. Right. But that's, but the, this actually sets out that everybody will get the same, it doesn't, it has absolutely nothing to do with people coming forward. So it's a guarantee that everybody Yeah. will get the same you haven't had In effect they are, they're appealing to the, the, the poorer peasants hoping to get more mobilization Yes. but I think two months later Mao realizes that this is harming Right. S so the position as of say the summer nineteen forty seven when, when you're, you, this law was being formulated the reports coming back are that although there is the opportunity for the poor to do better, as a, as a matter of course they're not all doing better. Now that's a bit of a surprise to you in the sense that you believed that ten percent of the population owned eighty percent of the land and therefore this, this kind of erm a a attack on, on the rich was happening through the May the fourth directive , that would've produced enough to bring everybody up to a reasonable middle peasant status. And it doesn't seem to be happening. Now if, if you accept the ten percent owning the eighty percent, there must've been enough but the poor are not getting it. So why weren't they getting it? This is one of 's questions isn't it? When he says that erm that sort of, that's what the C C P leadership thought and so they thought that if they weren't getting the land then something must be going wrong with the policy Right. and the thing that was going wrong was this erm was this problem of the operation of the cadres. They Right. were basically erm inflicted upon and this sort of er all the landlords and rich peasants corrupting the whole process. Right. S so it's, it's, it's either that the cadres are being rightist, they are protecting the landlords so they are keeping too much, or the problem is that the cadres, what we looked at earlier, the cadres are getting in themselves and they are taking too much for themselves. Mm. Right. So the, the May the fourth directive is not working because it's not guaranteeing that the poor get enough to bring them up to the middle peasant status which is, is the aim. Mm. So th th th the, the outline agrarian law is simply a means of ensuring that everybody will come up to a middle peasant status. No But surely that's not possible? it must be possible But if, if, if you accept this ten percent and the eighty percent that it Yeah. is possible. Must be possible. Mm. I mean if, if, if you've got, if, if, if you've got that much land there must be enough. Yeah. But argues that how that in actual fact by this time land reform had already taken place and there wasn't enough, any more land to be redistributed. Th th there's going to be some. Yeah well some but not as much as the Communist Party Right. expected so although Right. th there were cases of cadres being rightist and taking too much land for themselves, the Communist Party actually exaggerated this problem and that the main cause was erm the very low lan land ratio. Right. So a a a a as you say that the problem is that erm as this process gets under way and er i i s so, I, I think it's, it's not just absolute egalitarian in that everybody will get the same, I think there was an assumption that there would be enough for everybody becoming up to a middle peasant status. And therefore i i i it wasn't just the poor s saying well I want the same as everybody else, I want as much as a middle peasant. Now wh what were, in your introduction w were you saying that there, there simply wasn't enough land for that to happen? And therefore in the process of trying to bring the poor up to er some of the land of the middle peasant had to be taken and that's a problem isn't it? Oh very much so because I mean all through this er through this period the communists are making, they, they want to unite themselves firmly with the peasants Right. and so that anything which will possibly infringe the middle peasants would be, would be disastrous. Right. So at the point where it becomes clear that absolute egalitarianism is going to encroach on the interests of the middle peasants, you need to stop it? But But it could also be used to their advantage in that how that erm absolute egalitarianism would speed up the process of land reform and eliminate feudalism whereas a moderate policy would just take ages for this to happen, so Yes. Right. it was an expediency at the time. A justifiable one? Mm. So the outline agrarian law policy was the right policy? I, no I, I get the impression that, you know, everyone just everyone just kind of freaked out end of nineteen forty six forty seven and they were just, oh God what are we gonna do now,wh what can we do to get some more support, oh excellent, yeah, let's go for equal distribution, what a great idea and then all of a sudden they think oh no, it's not, you know, perhaps it's not such a good idea after all. I really, I really get the impression that there's, there's , it's incredibly sort of nobody really knows what to do, you know, there's this big turbulent thing just happening and people are very confused about the whole thing because the M May the fourth directive isn't particularly er it didn't give anybody an absolute guideline, guide to erm what to do. In October nineteen forty six Mao says to the cadres look, get land reform sorted out, don't worry about the war, just get land reform sorted out! You know and they probably went well yeah, what do we do? What, what exactly are we meant to do. Can't blame them with the K M T knocking on your though. What? Well you can't really blame them that much with the K M T knocking on the door. Well I dunno, I mean on the one hand in nine in nineteen forty five I think it was, they were saying you know well in order to do, have s s s successful land reform you need three conditions, they said the same thing in nineteen forty eight, they said you need this, this, this and then we have to be militarily secure but then in nineteen forty six they're saying no, don't worry about it, just get the land reform sorted out, just do it. And I, I really get the impression that, for a while, you know there was, there was just this incredible rush and they just thought oh we've got to do something, and, and tha that's what and this idea that you've gotta be right But why was there an incredible rush? I mean What? where was that incredible rush coming from? The war, I reckon. Yes. I reckon it starts with the war. Yeah. No they all of a sudden really need support. They saw that, you know the, this wa wash your face campaign and all of a sudden their cadres were pretty unpopular and they thought goodness me, we're really doing something, we're just doing something wrong and we've got to try and mobilize support, we need a radical policy. Right. Isn't,i i this is back, Simon they have,th that they need sort of a radical policy to mobilize support erm when all the oth all the other radical policy that, that do you it, it's this sort of catch twenty two between erm land reform and mass mobilization. Do you need mass mobilization in order to get land reform or is the only way in which you can achieve land reform to have mes mass mobilization? Well I th I get the impression that there's sort of a, there's an assumption that the communists are making is that, you know you get land reform sort of like give these people a bit of land Yeah. and fight for me. Have you got a better idea? Well no no there is no better way, but er the problem with that is that, you know okay, you might get, you might get some peasants who say well we're really grateful, we'll go off and fight but some of them might just say no look, we've got some land I'm not gonna leave it, But they should put in little sort of qualifications like er er they gave people land and if they went off to fight then it would be guaranteed that the land would be tilled. I think that's very important. Right. Because I think one of the most worrying things that for the soldiers at the front was will their family be looked after and will their land sort of be alright when they get back Yes, yeah. Cos it was quite a respectable position as well wasn't it? And also I think not everyone was accepted in the army, they sent a lot of people back. Yeah. That's right. yes. Because of what? Because they weren't fit enough physically even mentally ill I should imagine will be sent. What, cos they weren't committed enough to it? Er now w w w we've got this position during the course of nineteen forty seven and it's, it's, it's really the first half of forty seven which I think is the crucial one when the launch its offensive erm it's, it's a very big shock for, for the communists,th th they, you know,itself is overrun and Mm. th th they defend that against the Japanese and then in, early in forty seven the come in and take it over so it's an enormous psychological shock erm and they recognize that erm they, they, they do need to er they recognize that the way is through mass support, they think that's what they've gotta get, and they've gotta get it quickly. In a sense they, they were back now in, in the situation that they, they needed support from the peasantry quickly and surely the way to do that was to offer them land, to give them land reform because rent reduction interest ra interest rate reduction is not enough. You've got to go the land reform. And if you go for the land reform, if you promise the peasants the land erm and you're moving towards a position of,y you, you you're still thinking exactly what your policy is but under that might come a a realization that absolute egalitarianism is the best way of doing this, look th th there is enough land for us to be able to do this, this is the simplest process which will guarantee for middle peasant status, it will bring their, their living standards up to acceptable levels. I if we go for land reform we will get mass mobilization. I mean i it's, it's a fair enough strategy isn't it? I think that's what, I think Yes. in the end of the speech about, you know if, if agrarian reform is thorough Right. You know I think that was very much what they had in mind. Yes. mobilize people Yeah. But it's all based upon their assumption that land reform was the erm the solution to the agrarian problem. They saw that how that, they saw the Chinese problem essentially as one of exploitation and that how that as soon as, that they saw it as the land problem Mm. erm now if they, I mean they didn't even consider that how other options which might have increased the living standards because land reform Right. would enable them to get into power Yes. and that was what, I mean if they had erm decided to take more te point of view and to increase production through improved methods of farming and so on, that prob erm I mean we can see that that would've created higher yields and that, because we've assessed the situation now Yes but how long would that take? That would take ages so they're having land reform as a means to an end and that how that it's improving living standards of peasants so that they get mass support, land reform was the only political option they had. Right. Fine. But is, is, I mean w w what we've said so far is that the problem with this is that there isn't enough land and therefore it encroaches on the middle peasant and, and that's the problem, that's the reason you had to change your policy. But was that the only problem? What, what about the poor themselves? You know y y y y you're a poor peasant and the Party's coming in in conditions of civil war and we say right erm we've gotta get land reform and the land reform process is being done, not by the Party coming in and imposing it, it is very much done by the Party encouraging and enabling the peasants to, to take the moves themselves, to stand up and begin the criticism. Ho how can you, going to be, to do that, I mean right you're a poor peasant and I explain to you all the benefits of land reform, what are you gonna say to me? Well it depends, you know, it depends if I expect erm my landlord to come back and chop my head off or something. Right. I mean that's, that's very important, there was a lot of suffering, I think it's about the people who, I can't remember returned to the villages Yes. Yeah. and they meted out some terrible retribution of people who Absolutely, yeah. communist. Yes. So Especially if the K M T Exactly. So if, if you are a poor peasant you are thinking hold on the Party expects me to stand up to this landlord and accuse him of this this and this, actually point a finger at him when there is a chance that, you know, the Kuomintang is, is twenty miles away and they, I know they've come into other villages as they come back, m of land to peasants.s in the form of land There must've been with erm in forty seven was it the encirclement campaign where they allowed the nationalists to sort of drive through the, I don't know the defences, they must've been fairly certain of their support in certain areas by then. Because they actually allowed the, the nationalists to, to sort of drive a an attack through into villages and take over erm and they, they assumed that they would drive too far erm Yes. so they must've been fairly sure of their support to allow them to come into an area of villages. they acknowledged as a mistake later on didn't they? I mean in a sense they were just sacrificing peasants for that strategy. But, but, but once, once the, the stories get around that the communists have not created a strong enough military base to guarantee that land reform will hold Mm. and you know what happens, I mean I,and therefore you er there, there might be a problem within in that you might not get the necessary mass mobilization support from the land reform because of the, of the possible consequences. Well it did up the stakes somewhat didn't it? Yeah. If you were gonna go for it, but then they, they changed it didn't they? When they had their sort of semi liberated areas and stuff. Right, okay so out of this comes a Yeah they realize that a different set of policies but but as of forty seven the strategy is we need to mobilize the masses quickly behind us now, there must be enough land to give the er peasants enough. Th the only reason there might not,i i i if they're not getting enough it is because erm ei either too much land is being held by the landlords because the cadres are , or the cadres taking the land. Now er er out of that comes the view well maybe this is maybe we've got to guarantee security first and then go on, and secondly a realization well maybe there may not be enough land. And therefore more protection for the middle peasants. But, but, but that would ex at least explain why the outline agrarian law takes the form that it did and what was the thinking behind it. But we're saying if you look at, right, these two factors, one is the you've got land reform er on absolute egal dunno what you call it grounds, the other is that you're getting the peasants to do it themselves Yeah. they're just simple really measures of the urgency of the situation. Yes. Yeah. otherwise erm what did, how did they mo mobilize enough er forces then? Because we decided that they didn't have a, a strong enough military base er w w w what erm gave the peasants the incentive to, to join ? Well er er quite a lot of peasants did join because they, presumably they were motivated by land reform, er it's clear that that did happen Mm. and i it wasn't in all areas that the came back, I mean in some areas there was enough security but you wouldn't know which area was going to be secure. Right. But it was er er I mean i it's clear that the policy was, was successful in that they do mobilize a lot of peasants and, and they the nationalist offences so I mean that bit of it worked. It's just that the costs involved in a lot of peasants being killed and you then begin to encroach on middle peasants. So y y you're, you're weighing the gains of, it's a success, it is successful in terms of mobilization, but there are costs involved. Oh. I would have thought it's, it would be harder and harder to, to mobilize the peasants. I mean, weren't they getting quite tired of these land reforms?years. Er mm I don't think so because the, the, we, we are with all of this we are still in north China so this was the first time land reform has come. Erm and therefore the, the, the peasant wasn't yet in a position where, my God this is not another land ran land reform er I mean I, I don't think that had begun to build up but yes I mean that, that is coming to be a problem. I mean er and if you go through it goes on and on and on erm and the changes in policy come to be a problem. Erm one thing before we move on do you think there is a distinction or a difference between the outline agrarian land reform which is essentially 's creation, and the speech that he gives at the end of the conference? Do, do they conflict at all? In that i i in the speech isn't recognizing some of the difficulties, isn't he recognizing the need to protect the middle peasant? And, and, and, and, and, and are, are there points in, in the speech where he specifically says you, you must protect the interests of the middle peasant Mm The speech was written before the er which speech are we talking about? The speech concluding the national land conference. Yes, but, but the national land conference approved the outline agrarian law erm and then it be it became formal policy in October so it is after, but, but it was the land conference which actually ratified it. Yeah is, what you're saying is that on the one hand he was saying right let's have absolute equality of distribution but at the same time he quite clear that peasants. Right. So i i i Yeah. I mean i i i in a sense I think he was, he's been criticized unfairly for, for this because he he, he copped all the blame for absolute egalitarianism, whereas in fact if, if you look at the details behind it he was aware of the dangers of encroachment on the middle peasant and was warning against that and saying look this shouldn't happen. So if if the cadres had taken the law and 's speech there shouldn't've been the sorts of problems that, that we came up against. I E the, the middle peasant shouldn't have been encroached upon. But then if the middle peasant wasn't encroached upon, the poor wouldn't've got enough. Mm. So that y you, you, you couldn't win either way. Right. So the law was, was implemented, it became fa clear fairly quickly that, in the process of that implementation, it did lead to encroachment on the r middle peasant. At that point you have to call a halt to it. Well what you consider the er middle peasants to be and obviously the erm Right. communists er placed a great deal of importance cos as, as a class they were a great body Yeah. cos as land reform's more and more successful then presumably more people were becoming middle peasants. Right. They made up almost forty percent of the army Right. erm I think there was, there was erm, they definitely made the decision by then to sacred cow and they can't harm the middle peasants Right. Yeah, Mao said we support the peasants' demand for equal distribution of land in order to help the masses of peasants speedily to abolish the system of land ownership, but we do not advocate absolute egalitarianism, whoever advocates absolute egalitarianism is wrong, such thinking is reactionary, backward and retrogressive in nature Yeah. it's a pretty nasty criticism Yeah, the whole, whole basis of then he goes on to explain why And this is in nineteen forty eight is it? Yeah. But at the same time so presumably he would've supported it. Yeah the l that's the laughable thing as well, he tries to criticize it on ideological grounds Mm. Right. which they admitted work cos it was a load of rubbish. Right. Yes. But what about when, I dunno i it in his speech he's being very honest and saying well look we really need the support blah blah and the and then tries to put this er bit in about erm Marxist Leninism that's life and is er well wh what's all that about? I think he's trying to do a number of things here Yeah. and this is the problem an an and as you get into them they all do begin to conflict. But in terms of the change of policy, does this fit with the, the kind of Maoist view of excesses? That is to right a wrong you need to go to excess. No I don't think so, I think there's a difference because the other excesses were on the peasants' part now it's okay whatever the peasants did, you know, it's not terrible it's, it's fine to let the peasants do that, and also erm into the war period the peasants are gonna but mustn't do it, this time it's like okay, now we're the party that's saying let's go as far as we can. Right. It's the party actually saying that we should promote rather than allow. Who's er who's doing the excesses? Who's taking ? Well it's It's the poor isn't it because they Yeah but it's on the instruction it's on the instructions of Not, no not Cos the poor they can do what they want sort of bits, I've got a bit here and it says all landlords may be liquidated immediately you know right. Yes. So so the, the leadership Right. did get it all wrong and Well but e bu bu but that i is inconsistent with what is telling us,th there's nothing in 's speech which, which whi which condones that kind of excessive violence. I mean if, if you take his view it's fairly moderate. You're quite right that a number of er statements are coming out which, which do really give give erm legitimacy to this kind of violence bu bu but basically the violence is still being created or led by the poor in their attempt to, to get more. Now No but that was a result of the er lan land law in itself wasn't it? Yes. Well i it, it, certainly it, it allowed you to do that Yes. but I think one one might still see this in terms of, of Mao's ideas on excesses that, that clearly the situation was not right in the first half of, of nineteen forty seven. The May the fourth directive hadn't gone far enough, you needed to go beyond that. Y y you needed to right that wrong. Now in order to move yourself forward you might need to go to excess, you might need at least to tolerate excesses. Once you've gone too far, and I think this is where the centre is crucial, the centre has got to, to say we have gone, this is the point where we have gone too far and we need to stop. But you then ended up somewhere which was better than where you started off from. And in order to get from A to B you needed to go to excess. Mm. Well yeah but the reason I think you can condemn the excesses is because it's middle peasants to waver Yes. er Bu bu bu but but er but you're not unhappy with those excesses taking place because th they may be necessary in order to move you forward. more and more saying look and let's try and kill a few less people. Ah but, but only when it's realized it, it's gone too far. Yeah but w w too far because it's affecting the middle peasants. Peasants. That becomes your criterion? Yeah. Mm. Yeah he didn't really care he wasn't too bothered but at least that's what he said at one point But if, if you've got that idea of what Mao's idea of excess is you know that you can have excesses then you go f forward and then you come back there Yeah. that in itself is the Party saying we should do this. I mean it's not just letting the excesses go which I think understand it when you first said it, so that idea in itself is a Party idea, it's not just letting the, the peasants do it and say well okay what you're trying to say now is that okay that we have got this strategy, we'll let the excesses go and then we'll stop it, we get to about stage B and stage C and move on and move on. That in itself is a Party isn't it? Er yes, the, the, I think the one bit of it that is not Mao's is that, is that you do unfortunately in a sense sense have these statements from the, the various bureaux and this is a,th this absolute terror is okay. Erm er I mean if you go back to 's view,i it is, it's legitimate for the, for the masses to commit excesses, it's not legitimate for the Party to promote them. Now I think in 's view those Party s those bureaux statements were excessive and, and I think you wouldn't probably have gone along with them, or at least he, he oughtn't to within his own terms of reference. Erm but without that as long as it's the masses who are committing this it's, it's okay because you, you need that in order to create the When it's gone too far, when it's counter-productive in a, not for the individual middl poor peasant because he's doing very well out of it, but in terms of the movement as a whole, you begin to stop it. And who makes that decision? It's Mao's. How much, how much erm by a landlord cos I mean they didn't even attend the conference. Apparently. I, I, I find it difficult to believe he would not have known that. I mean for Christ sake it's a conference lasts three months erm I mean o okay it's, it's a difficult area but I, I just don't believe the communications were that bad that he didn't know what was going on and wasn't in a position to say look this is wrong. I, I think he knew about it, I think he was happy with it because I mean as, as, as we've seen th th one can build up a, quite a convincing rationale for it Mm. erm if, if, if you, if you, if you take this view of excesses you're not unhappy for that to happen in order to move it forward as long as you maintain the control necessary to stop it when it's gone too far, which is exactly what he does. I mean as soon as it's clear that the middle peasants are coming under pressure December nineteen forty seven, he begins to issue statements, we must protect the middle peasant and as, as said the, the, the nineteen thirty three class documents are reissued er which make it very clear that, that middle peasants must be protected. So do you think that erm when this law was erm pushed through in nineteen forty seven that er perhaps Mao you know well I think there's been a bit of excess now, I think we'll do some we just need, we just need a bit of a rush now just to take us through a bit and then we'll stop it in a few months time. Mm. Mm right. It's either that deliberate or a, a sort of er one stage back where well if it leads to excesses it won't actually matter because we may, it might be necessary and we can stop it anyway. Mm. It's like giving the appearance of the Party following the peasants but in fact the Party's got a good idea where they will probably go anyway. Yeah. Erm a very subtle, very behind the scenes But, but if, if you followed Mao's speech it, there shouldn't be much in the way of excess anyway. I it, it's, you've got these other statements now I think the they're the real problem, those are the ones which, which really do lead to not just condone but support and encourage the excesses which are the problem. Cos I mean, I mean I think that, that there is, there are two things, one is the excesses in terms of, of landlords being killed, and the other is, is the encroachment on middle peasants er er er they are different things. There's the t the violence of it and the excesses in terms of, of the effects on the middle peasant. We, we'd better stop there. Can, can we, we'll pick this at this point Quickly that if what you're saying is true that how that erm they wanted to er that they, they didn't care that this could lead to excesses because they could control of the situation, wasn't that a bit damnable because supposing they couldn't? Yeah This too, they left until the end of the meeting in er, in part two. Part two. Sure, do you mean paper B or do you mean the whole of item three? The whole of item three the whole of item three. You agree? Agreed There is a problem with magistrates courts and things like that Chairman, and I don't think there's contention about that is there? They are, there are in parts. We make it. Are they? As I understand it Chair, what you're saying is, that there are, at three there is a, a request for an exclusion of press photographers, but the convenience of press photography we're saying that instead of taking immediately so that we'd have to call them back here for the even later, we're asking you for it to be taken at the end with the rest of exclusion That's correct. But Chairman, that refers to item three two, not the whole of three Yes, but I mean, it, it is erm, three wild parker, presumably, so that I, I, I would assume Mr Chairman if we do have to maybe you'll be sure that he, the with three, two agreement? Yes, Three two, yes, it's only three two. The others don't come under those sections. It's difficult for me, yes. Okay, you agree? Three two Yes On the budget And three three On the? No Yes, there seems to be some database with what we're We can't, We can't, we can't take C before B really, we'd have to discuss C before B, we can come back into public on C if you so desire, at the end Mr But B will be erm, but B three will be in section in three We're talking about B three Captain, B three is open to the public press, unless count county solicitors propose a good reason why it shouldn't be. But we don't want to discuss that before B do we really? We've got to make a decision on B before we can finalize C. Thank you. Alright. Yes Chair,th th that's right, as I understand it, there is no reason why C should not be discussed next session, indeed it's probably right that it should be, but it's a matter for members to decide whether they can usefully do so before considering B. We can go back into public after B if you so desire. Yes, yes Are we not allowed to defer B until the end of the meeting? But we can't take C Mrs , until we've taken B. No, oh, right, I see. I will, I will second you that we Agreed, yes We can do three, four Chairman. We just agreed it. Three, four? Three, four's only for report. Three, four is only a report. We haven't had the opportunity to decide the recommendations there. So, I mean the recommendations are finally complete, have you submitted to Policy and Resources Committee? Read, read over Chairman, can I ask what, what your intentions are with, with the budget, Chairman and there's great public interest in the budget. Is it your intention to enter a statement part erm, at the end of the meeting to the press and so on? If the press are here they can safe safely hear the items, if they're not here it doesn't matter. They're not here We'll deal with that when it comes, we're to it yet, anywhere near. No, no Er Can I propose we move on to four. Yes, we'd better just approve the minutes of the meeting process, of the last meeting first of all, hadn't we lads? I've completely overlooked it. Yes Agreed? Yes Item four, Trace of Deeds. Mr . Erm, I don't really wish to add anything in particular to this if people would like to ask questions, then I'm prepared to answer them. The, just note there is a short article note on the Waterprice situation overpage. If anybody wants to expand on that or anything else I'm willing to do so. Okay, anybody want to question Mr on any of the points? What's the feeling about B S E Mr Chairman, where're our feelings, put them down or what? Er, yes, Mr Chairman, nationally it is going down, locally we're, we're going along on a plateau, erm, and in some areas it is actually go the incidence is going up, but this is basically like Scotland where they haven't got many anyway. So the, the overall figure is going down, and this really reflects the way outbreaks have occurred, in that some areas have a lot early on, they're dropping off. We had a quite a number at the middle of the outbreak, er, that continuing been upstairs in a house before you see we'd been brought up in a bungalow and we'd never ever been upstairs and the thoughts of going upstairs to bed, you know, was fantastic Mm and, all, all we kept saying on the train coming down Bob and I oh I hope we can slide down the bannisters Bannisters And could you? No cos they bent round and we had a tie, we did but it was only a little bannister you know, we tried it What do you think was so particular about having stairs? I don't know, it was just a novelty, we'd never ever, I remember an, an aunt of ours that lived in Plymouth near us, she had a house with an upstairs, but she had a downstairs toilet, so we never got to go upstairs you know it's just one of those stupid things I suppose, I, I thought it was great and another attraction was I think one of the main reasons you got us to really want to come to Harlow was the fact that we'd have a television Yeah we'd never, like I mean, I can remember in Plymouth dad saying when we get there, erm we'll buy a television, we'll have a television and we didn't know what he was talking about and he said it's a wireless with pictures, you know, and our minds were boggling we just couldn't understand it, and then of course that was another bit of bribery got us to come. Anything you remember when you first saw a television? Yes, yeah, when you had one delivered, that's the first time we'd ever seen one wasn't it? Oh yes we'd sat there and didn't mum have a new cooker? Mum had a new cooker yeah Yeah , yeah Was it gas or electric? Gas Gas it was Yeah, she was over the moon with it though, wasn't she? What? She was over the moon with it Oh yes, aye she'd never seen anything like it, but I think we had quite a lot of new furniture didn't we? Yeah quite a bit We'd brought some with us odd things, well of course bed linen, a lot of bedrooms and that to furnish and Well tell me about the furniture that you brought Oh we've got You've still got your suite haven't you? Pardon? Still got your three piece suite We've still got the same and the dining one and the dining one and the sideboard, yeah When did you buy it? Nineteen thirty seven, thirty, thirty seven, bought it in Plymouth and our dining room suite, I'll always remember this, cost twenty eight guineas, not the dining, I'm sorry the three piece suite Three piece suite twenty eight guineas, and when we got to Harlow I had it recovered by firm in Sawbridgeworth, twenty eight guineas To have it recovered, mm yes the same price But it and we still use the same dining table, sideboard, chairs, dining chairs, mind you they, they that kind to of thrown out, reluctant to do it They wouldn't, no they we had a lot of affection for it really and, I mean we've had it so long and it was the first furniture we had when we married You wouldn't do that now, would you? And er what else Do you remember when we we've got a bedroom suite as well apart from the gentleman's wardrobe cos we had them during the blitz and that, burnt all my wardrobe Mm and side of the bed, but we get In Harlow? No No, no this was in Plymouth Oh and during the, I was away actually I wasn't there, but er, it was all burnt so I did away with that and we managed to do the bed up somehow Mm it's still going, we've still got the dressing table the big wardrobe Can you remember what the make of the furniture was? Well I don't know what make it was but it came from the house, the furnishing company of Union Street, Plymouth I can't remember the shop. Do you remember when you got rid of one of your armchairs last year or the year before, they bought two new fireside chairs and one of the armchairs nearly had it We had to get rid of them they were nearly collapsing and the men came, delivered the new ones and erm, one of them, er oh you said would you take the old one and they said, yeah, fine you know, dad said well it'll take both of you, oh no, no, I can do that, he couldn't even lift it you know cos they were so solid and two of them had a heck of a job didn't they? Yeah Getting it out and that was just an armchair don't know what they'd do if they had to move the settee, but erm, that's the difference in Well we had to higher, higher seats really, well these, these are alright but when you get to my age Can't get in and out of them so easily have a job getting out of them and er you know more or less the higher chair's Mm better for us And the dining room suite is it oak? Oh it's veneered, veneered oak Mm it's not er solid oak, it's veneered, mm, it's oak yeah And when you came to Harlow you said that you bought some new furniture Yeah we bought a new bedroom suite I think that's about the first thing I had a new bedroom suite didn't I? Oh yes and that cos when I got married I took it with me didn't I? That's right Do you still have it? And then my mother and father came down in the four bed when we moved to ninety five in the four bedroom yes, they brought their bedroom suite down with them. And did you buy the bedroom suite in Harlow? Erm, just trying to think where we bought it Sheratons? Er what Sheratons in the Stow? No I bought my dining room suite, this Ercol dining room suite in there, I've still got it, yeah that was a long Oh yeah the shops have changed quite a lot in the The Stow haven't they? Yes when we came of course the Stow was er you know Yeah it was just a little had a little trees weren't there to make The Stow. We thought it was quite something when we got the shops weren't it? I remember it happening, but I can't remember somebody came to open it, did somebody come to open The Stow you know Forget now somebody came to open I remember there were invitations given out to go to it, sherry party, I had an invitation but I didn't go for some reason Mm I was working or something, but erm, two of Mr went, you know that neighbour of mine Mm So when you bought the bedroom suite, erm, can you remember if erm, what the purchase tax was on it then? Oh I couldn't, I'm sorry Can you remember, it, obviously it wasn't rationing any more, there wasn't utility No, no any more at that time was there? No I think utility had more or less finished then It finished at the end of fifty two Yeah, I remember, I remember having a ration book for sweets That went on for quite a long time Oh yes, oh yeah, oh yeah but the actual rationing on furniture ended, at the end of nineteen fifty two but they brought in something called schedule T We must of bought that suite before then Before then, yes, we must of bought it when we moved in cos I, I mean I wasn't without a bed We did, we bought it as soon as we moved in because er You must of had Must of had one straight away, yeah Yeah you, I'd of told you mum should of come up, she wouldn't come would she? She'd probably remember She'd remember things like that I tell you yes I'm very interested in that particular period just before, just, when you get the after maturity of when they had this strange very schedule D and er the tax, the purchase tax Mm Mm and all that sort of thing and how it affected people buying furniture because there was a very high luxury tax That's right highly expensive furniture Mm sixty six and two thirds Yeah but the single bedroom suite I remember that I wouldn't know that And you can't remember where you bought it? It must of been fifty one, June I bet mum's still got the bill somewhere it must of been at the end in the autumn at, at least of fifty one I wouldn't be a bit surprised, I'll try and find out for you I wonder if I know sixty one weren't they? Mm, mm You know and the stuff we had that, cos we've changed it all. Can you tell me about the light fittings that you bought when you first got married. I'm trying to think I got, oh god, that was Pennymead cos we lived with mum and dad for three months until we got a maisonette in Pennymead Mm, mm erm, I can remember the three piece suite it was that uncut moquette stuff, you don't see it now do you? It was grey and, and mustard, it sounds revolting but we, we were a bit, I suppose it was the time we had a purple carpet, we had an orange wall, do you remember that living room? Yeah You needed sunglasses to go in it, erm oh you didn't really actually it looked, it looked alright but it was very modern, my mum and dad didn't think it was up to much you know we thought it was great. Why did you cho why did you want to have modern? Well I don't know it's just what we liked at the time you know, we liked anything that was considered a bit way out then, you know Mm and we had er, I mean we had a bright orange swivel chair and when that came out it was called the Orbit or something, something really weird and it had a big back on it and we thought it was great I mean, I think it's awful now, some of the things we had, I'll have to try and find some photographs cos I've got a case full of photographs upstairs Yeah I've got a lot of I've got lots of them inside that maisonette you know when That would interest me very much with my er eldest son's nearly nineteen Oh yes, you've got those cos when he was a baby we took loads of photographs inside. And you said that you had an orange wall, only one orange wall? On one orange wall, yeah Which wall was it? I can't remember what was on, it was a plain, well, we, we had er french windows with a balcony, it was an upstairs maisonette and the wall that end was orange and my father-in- law made us the cocktail bar, do you remember that cocktail bar That's right, yeah you made us with white quilting on the front, oh it sounds awful now, but did, got rid of that about a year, twelve, eighteen months ago Oh and I had sort of marble on the, formica marble contact, that contact stuff on top, purple carpet, er mustard and grey suite, that was an odd shape that suite wasn't it? It had sort of round chairs Yeah you know those round chairs with, everything had those legs, those screw on legs, everything the coffee table didn't it? The suite, everything had screw on legs and we bought erm a radiogram, that was a Pye, beautiful thing it was, it was ever so expensive then, I might even have the bill for that somewhere, we bought that at the town centre in Laytoners was it? Erm Yeah, Laytoners that was my twenty first birthday we bought that on, so that was before Gary was born and er, that had black screw on legs as well, the televisions had black screw, oh we didn't have a television we had a second hand television about a year after we were married and I remember Coronation Street starting, that started about when we got married. What year did you get married in? Nineteen sixty one, er, our anniversary was a few weeks ago, twenty one years we've been married, but er Have you er we were, we were furniture made, you know, all we thought about was the home and in fact once we couldn't afford any wall paper we were decorating so George painted the wall white and we got saucepan lids, and even the dustbin lid and with er, er, a black pen, felt type pen I suppose although felt pens weren't out then I don't know that I don't think but that sort of thing, but he drew black circles and triangles all over this white wall it looked, I've got a photograph of that Was that that looked fantastic and everyone said oh god he's so artistic you know and he's a butcher he wasn't really but we just used to sit down and think of all these ideas you know Where did you get these ideas from? Well they, er nowhere, we didn't get them from anywhere we just used to think them up and everyone thought we were potty didn't they? I bet John liked it John, George's brother George's brother, yeah, he's quite a bit artistic ain't he? Yeah, well I think George is actually George is I mean when he does his window displays you've never seen anything like it, you know,so, I think he's got quite er, he's quite good at things like that, but erm, we've tamed down a bit now. So you were considered daring were you? Oh yeah, yeah, where the furniture was concerned yeah, we only liked it if people came in and said oh my god what have you done now,you know . What kind of curtains did you have? Oh, I, I can remember when fibreglass curtains first came out we bought some of those terrible things they just went in holes, you know if you touched them too much they just went in holes. They were brittle? Yeah Mm and if you washed them you mustn't put clothes pegs in them cos the pegs would make holes in them Mm fancy having stuff like that Was it a sheer or a solid material this fibreglass? I don't know what you mean Was it like a see through, like a net kind of curtain, no Oh no, no , no it's the big curtains, I think one we had great big green leaves on Mm do you remember those? Terrible Well I liked them when we bought them Mum and I used to go in and say why it looks alright and when we got outside Ain't it awful ain't it awful living with that and then when we got rid of that purple carpet We got we brought a bright orange carpet, do you remember that bright orange er , when that first came out? With the, with the erm that big white cat on it, what make was that? They used to advertise it with a big white fluffy cat Not Sue and Lord Oh it might of been Mm don't know, but we had this bright orange carpet, mind you even we couldn't live with that for too long. So that was after the purple carpet? Yeah oh we loved all the gold furniture and, that's all we used to do was walk round looking at furniture and things Where did you buy the furniture? Oh mainly in Harlow Mm, mm I can remember we went to erm, oh cos we moved out of Harlow didn't we when Nick was eleven months old so that's about fifteen years ago and lived in Hatfield for three years, so, and we used to go to Welwyn Department Store then and, and look at stuff. I can remember one standard lamp we had, it was really weird and people used to say that'll be alright if you were landing a plane cos it had spotlights, I mean now, they, erm, in fact you can still buy the same sort of thing, but then it was so way out Yeah it had sort of round shade with a bulb and the bu but it looked like an eye you know because the bulb came out and you moved these three things around, you can still buy them now, but er, then they were a bit way out. And this was when you were living in Hatfield? Yes So that would of been that would be about fifteen years ago Yes, nineteen sixty eight or so Mm A very nice house in Hatfield weren't it? Yeah, it was a lovely house yeah but we wanted to come back to Harlow you see, so we did like, well we always liked Harlow, really the only reason we went to erm er Hatfield was the fact that Harlow Council no way would move us out of that maisonette, we had two boys and we lived upstairs and Gary had all sorts of accidents on those stairs, in fact we all had because they were outside, erm so in the winter they iced up Mm concrete stairs and, George nearly killed himself on them one morning, but er, and we tried everything to get out of there you know, no one would exchange a two bedroom maisonette for a house and of course I longed for a garden, but, and er George got a job in Hatfield and they offered this three bedroom house The Commission for The New Town, rent was cheaper than here, so we moved over there, but er, as I say we were only there two, three years and we came back again, we were over here , we used to come over here three times a week, when we lived there didn't we? Mm, mm So we got back to Harlow again That wallpaper but erm what was it called again Francis Henry's in this style Yeah erm, cos Mary that still works in there she, her husband worked for either Mr Henry, I can't remember his name, the man that owned it, and I think, I think perhaps they were brothers or something, she, her husband owns it now it's Freyers or something now Yeah, do it yourself there's new yeah, but we used to buy all our wallpaper At The Stow? in there, yeah They use to sell all the paper and all that business then to do erm wallpaper and we , we loved and wallpaper and you, is there, you couldn't see the book anywhere, er probably in London you could, but erm round here you couldn't, but they had the book down here. Er how did you know about it? Well only because we'd seen it in the shop From the shop Yeah And it was only in Well Dave worked in there, George's friend worked in there as well, yes it was, it was expensive wallpaper for then, it was so way out I mean we had red tartan wallpaper in the bathroom, you know you just don't see, er actually they'd be really nice designs now, you just don't see them now and we had er, a bright blue wallpaper that had big circles on it, do you remember that one? Mm That cost us a fortune well we thought so then At that time Yeah Was that in the living room? Yeah, I'd have to try and er see if I've got any of those bills anywhere, I know that that book's upstairs cos erm, we did that cupboard out the other day and I found all the photographs all our old photographs in a box, but the box had fallen to bits, so Mm I'd put them all in an old suitcase and erm, cos I couldn't just put them in there I had to have a look, they're sentimental and that book was in there so I can definitely get you that, but I wouldn't go up in the loft I'm afraid, I'm so scared of creepy crawlies so er, you know, if you, if you want to come back some time when my husband's here I mean he can tell you more about the wallpaper and decorating, and I'll get him to get that out. Can you remember what kind of paint you used? Oh no, he'll tell you that Yeah I wasn't allowed to touch But did you, did a paint brush I tried No painting the kitchen once and I got into so much trouble it took him so long to rub it all off and start again, he made me promise I'd never touch a paint brush again but he I mean, he would definitely be able to tell you what paint he used and Mm, mm because there was a change over to the emulsion wasn't there? Yeah, yeah Four legs good! Two legs bad! Unless you're a chicken, or to put it boldly, animals have rights too! But exactly what rights do they have? And does supporting animal rights justify violence? The animal rights lobby is a forceful one by various means, some legal, some not, some specific, some violent. Campaigners seek to convince the unconverted that animals deserve a better deal! Which animals? And what's the better deal? Let's find out. And let's start with a basic question, here in this nation of animal lovers, do you think animals deserve a better deal? Some animals? All animals? Any animals? Do they deserve a better deal? Button one for yes, and button two for no. This is a descriptive vote because this hundred er women are not a representative cross section of the whole of Scotland they're invited to come from various places and ninety six of them think that animals deserve a better deal. When you said yes to that which animals did you mean? And what were you talking about? Yes? I think, a lot of people see the stray dogs problem as a big problem, certainly if people have decided to partake of pets, they have a responsibility to look after them and not throw them out on the streets. Okay so And I think problems like that are due to human irresponsibility! So those animals do have a raw deal! Okay, that's one area. Who else said yes, and why? Up, yes? I think animals that are used for human entertainment definitely deserve a better deal, for example, large wi wild animals that are used in circuses, we haven't got the right, as people, to say that they're here for our entertainment. What would that better deal be in that case? The better deal would be, not being transported up and down the country, and not being made to perform tricks that are un unnatural to their own behaviour patterns. Aha. Aha. Any other views? Yes? I think that er concern should also spread to animals that are hunted pleasure as well, i.e. the stags, deer, foxes, hares, I mean, there's there's quite a considerable list that's all done for entertainment. Mhm. Now the better deal there presumably would involve Not chasing them at all! not hunting them at all? No! I mean Okay. let them live their lives in peace without the harassment of chasing them with dogs and supporters and what have you! Okay. Any others that, yes? I don't think animals should be ta , used to be tested for cosmetics Mhm. perfumes or detergents Mhm. different things like that. What about medical research? Well, there again, yes, with reservations because if it comes to the fact that if it's going to save human lives, yes. Yes, and you get all the animals who are experimented on and you sa there's not a week that comes out and you don't an a report saying, oh well this this, this causes cancer in rats or and you, imagine the amount, the huge amounts of the sub , whatever substance it is that had been given to rats to cause the cancer, and there's no knowing that the amount that's gonna be given to rats causing cancer, will give cancer to humans! I mean,i it's just absolutely ridiculous! I'm a trustee for the beauty without cruelty charity Aha. and we would like to see an end to all experiments on animals, for cosmetics, toiletry, household product purposes. Hasn't that campaign been going for Oh many, many years! a long time? Yes! And we're making progress now. How? There are already many alternatives to the research carried out on animals which has been going on for a long time. Erm for example, you can grow human skin in a, in a cell culture and use that as a, as a testing er, medium Mhm. instead of a live animal. We can it can use erm a si similar substance for eye tests erm, to test to replace the Jeyes eye test Mhm. which again has been used for a long time on animals. These tests are very misleading. They don't protect bu su er, er the public, they protect the people who are actually manufacturing the products. Now do you think that the campaign th the th , the campaigns against the use in cosmetic testing had anything to do with the changes that were brought in, or do you think advances and responsible er science would have, would have made those changes anyway? I think inevitably,th the changes would have come because the, the alternatives are better. Yep. They are less misleading. Ah, but I think the campaign, the public campaign and the pressure that's been put on companies have definitely made quite a, quite a difference. Yes? While I agree that there is absolutely no justification for testing for cosmetic purposes at all! Absolutely Yes. none! I think we would have advanced to the stage we are at had we not used animals in the earlier stages for medical research. We're advancing all the time and I think there may came a time we won't use animals at all for medical research, but at, up till now we needed to use animals for medical research. I think you've got to be realistic about this whole issue, that er, obviously seeing the poor furry little bunny suffering for cosmetics! Mhm. Yes! I agree, that is wrong! But, if a test on a chimpanzee would save my child's life I'm afraid I'd go for the test on the chimpanzee. Okay. Yes? Erm I I think that one of the erm, drawbacks in using animals for any kind of testing is that it sort of precludes in some way using alternatives. And I think that, you know people who, they may be trained when they're a studying to Mhm. use animals, and then go onto to work using animals, and erm you know, if maybe alternative techniques were introduced at an earlier stage, maybe in their training, they'd be more likely to them on board. But, it's almost like it's the established pattern to use animals to test Mhm. all sorts of things, and it's gonna take quite a big shifty to get out of that. Mhm. Yes? I agree with what that lady's just said. What I find horrible is that there are so many organisations or or places all over Great Britain, they're all doing the same sort of tests! Can't we collate our knowledge so that not so many tests are having to be done on all these animals? Yes? Yes. Erm, being with the S S P C A, I have seen a lot of very sad pictures of animals, but one of the saddest photographs I saw, quite recently was two monkeys, well they're primates, we are Yep. part of that family too, and they were in a lab awaiting experimentation and they were in cages side by side and they'd stretched their arms out and were holding hands, almost as though, to give each other comfort. Mhm. Monkeys feel pain. They feel happiness, sadness and they also have a sense of humour. Under the nineteen eighty six act Mm. they have stated that all use of animals must be justified and it very carefully policed by the Home Office, as well as locally. I mean, it's it's vets etcetera Yeah. Yep. are always present in research establishments to ensure the well being of the animals, and very often there is actually no pain involved in the research. How, how do you know that? Well I was told by somebody who's involved in animal Right. research! Right. But er, frequently the animals are used for the research and there's no pain involved at that time and they are killed humanly before the research actually takes place. But do we find it acceptable that animals should be used, however painless the event. Well I would rather use an animal any time that my own child! Up there. Er, Switzerland is one country that has banned the use of animals for research, and I think we ought to be going along these lines that, if animals have rights we ought not to be using them for experimentation. Mhm. And if we were to ban the the process,th erm we would devise other means for research, would, we would find alternatives. There. Th there'll, there'll quickly move it somewhere where we can do it. It's quite alright, they move it out of Switzerland but if we can't have it here we'll have it in Pakistan or somewhere where they want the money! So it won't make any difference in that Yes? respect. I do not think that research has gone as fast as it should! Mhm. And it's going to be a long time before it's going to be possible, so therefore we still have to use animals, I see no way round it. Mhm. And I know that they're using cultures and things but I still think that we are a long way from not using animals. Up there. Erm can I, can I move this conversation on to the Yes. th th the, the veterinary side? Mhm. Erm, we've we've covered the fact that animal models don't always reflect the human situation, but if we're going to understand control and eradicate disease in animals, this sort of work must go on. Could I go back to something the lady here Yes. said about the Animal Procedures Act of nineteen eighty six, erm, I know she's been told about the animals are killed painlessly and that they suffer very little pain, where there's any pain at all, but in fact this act erm which is governed by a committee only erm issues guidelines as to what might happen. No matter how serious an infringement there might be of that act they are not subject to any sort of criminal offence. Sh shall we try and see what the er, what the general feeling on this is? Do you think that er the use of animals in research is ever justified? Er, button one for yes, and button two for no. Research there being either on behalf of animals themselves, or on behalf of er, of humans. Is research on er, the use of animals in research ever justified? And this particular hundred are creeping in with their votes but have decided, seventy fo seventy seven of them say yes, all be it th th th , by far the majority, and twenty three say no. Could anyone say what the consequences would be if they weren't available for use in er in the development of human er medicines and treatment? Well I wouldn't be here because a horse was used for a toxin to provide the anti-toxin for diphtheria whe , in my days when I was younger there was no toxins as such, vaccination as such and so therefore the horses were used for research to provide the anti-toxins. So do you think people who would like to ban the use of animals in research are in, are in cloud cuckoo land do you? Yes? Would any of you twenty three like to defend your position? Yes? Erm, I'm just not sure why any any person would think that they have more right to life than animals do. I mean what what gives you more right to life than an animal does? Anyone wa Just because we have, a so called civilized nation that we live in that destroys the world, that destroys animals that destroys the environment we're living in! You know, where's our right to life come from? I think you can far too sentimental about it! Erm humans are more important than animals, you you cannot gi equate an animal life with human life. We are the intelligent order. Being intelligent, we hope we won't be cruel to animals, but you can't say that we are, animals are just as important as humans. Mhm. Wha , why do you think we are more intelligent than animals? Well, for a start You know , because we can have television we could studios? No! We can reason with each other, animals don't reason with But other. We have conversations, animals don't have conversations! We are, we are living in a world , we are living in a world where constantly there's violence, does that happen in the animal world! Yes of course it does! Of course it does! Of course it does! To the same extent? They're horrible! Animals are terribly cruel to each other! N no well Yes? I can't accept that! Surely if intelligence is the answer, you know, what about mentally handicapped children? They're, they're not intelligent, does that mean they're just the same as animals? If intelligence is the criteria, then an awful lot of us in this room would be used as test animals! Mhm. We have a choice if we want to be involved in research Mhm. whereas animals don't! They have no Mhm. choice, they have no say. Mhm. There, yes? How do you know that erm animals don't reason? Like, how do you know what goes on, like with, dolphins, with whales, with all sorts of species of animals, like we don't know, well we're so dense we can only see things like this! We don't know what goes on there, we've got no right to interfere with their lives! Yes? I think, I think we're overlooking one erm Mhm. great power that the individual has, instead of being ing , indignant about erm, our views on animals in research, we could quite simply exercise our power, not to buy the products, to ask questions of our Mm mm. of our doctors what kind of drug it is? What research goes behind it? Do to exercise our individual intelligence to examine the facts on no , on the basis of our own conscience, individually to make a decision, and we can all do that! We can buy a different type of product. And there are many Mhm. companies now erm which quite obviously assert that fact, on the doorways of chemists for instance, they do not test on animals. So you're saying the consumer pressure could could change things? Mhm. It it it's every effective measure Mm. of stopping erm, a certain product it simply will go out of production. I would disagree that er, humans aren't used in experiments because I think that we're all being used at various points in our lives, for experiments, medical or otherwise. Mhm. And erm a , a lot of the medicines that are passed er have been passed to a certain degree and then th th the we become the the animal. Are you speaking as a, as an experienced guinea pig yourself? Well I'm a diabetic erm Yes. so to a certain extent th the human that was introduced in the last few Mhm. years has has is an experiment. How do you feel about that? I, don't mind being used as a guinea pig because I feel that it'll help people in the future. Up there. I believe that we have been given the right to have dominion over animals. The point I would like to put over is, I've listened to one or two erm, radio programmes, and television programmes about this and I personally would like to have more evidence of what actually happens to the animals. I don't think us er er public people really realize what is going on and I think then they would maybe stand up and be Mm. and be counted, but I think we've tended to stand back and just say well we know it's going on but what is actually being done to these Mhm. animals? Yes? Yes, we that lady over said there were guidelines, there were people that go in and inspect, but there are not enough, it is a known fact, that there are not enough people to go and inspect all the establishments where animal erm, experimentations are taking place and, I love animals, and alright, yes,yo you can do ex , some experiments on animals but let's not be cruel! That lady up there said that we have experiments, I'm sure, human experiments , you know, experiments, sorry, on human people Mm. but, on human beings, but we're not put through the state that animals are! We Mm. don't have great lumps made to grown on us, we don't go through she , severe pain. And, which company was it that says, to do something about pain you first have to create it. Mm. Ah, I mean that's terrible! I was responsible for researching into the, so called cruelty free products for beauty without cruelty, and it was a real can of worms! I was Yep! I was sorry I got involved in it at one point! Erm cosmetic companies are very devious! It's what they don't tell you that's important. Erm, there is a big problem at the moment with cosmetic labelling, for example, erm just exactly what does cruelty free mean? What does against animal testing mean? These are the kind of things that are actually on cosmetic products. Mm. It could mean, erm, against animal testing but I go along with it anyway. It could mean erm cruelty free, er erm who de defines in that case, what cruelty is? Er, not, not tested on animals might mean, by me by but by someone else! And it all sells products! And, beauty without cruelty has been involved recently in having er, trying to put forward an E C erm, directive on th er, the labelling of cosmetics, but it's very, very difficult! And, mainly because of those kind of problems. Yeah. Yep. What do you mean by erm, not tested on animals? The finished product? The ingredient? Ingredients are tested for other reasons too not necessarily just for the cosmetic and toiletry trade. I think that one of the outstanding erm criticisms that I would make of the whole programme, in research with animals, is the fact that only two licences have been revoked I think you said Mhm. on now, I think it's a bit like factory inspectors, and I talk from experience on this, er th o i me , everything gets cleaned up before the inspectors Mhm. arrive! If you report something you always get the same reply, nothing wrong when we went round! Mm. I'd like to move with th er, I I think tha wi given wi , though we haven't got all that much time, can we move onto another area that was brought up at the beginning of the programme which was erm the use of animals in recreation and er Lisa particularly mentioned hunting, now, she thinks hunting should be banned, do you? Do you think hunting animals should be banned? Various animals that hunted in this country, foxes, in some places deer, hares are coursed er in some places. Well well! There's an interesting result! Seventy nine of you think yes, hunting should be banned. For the minority, twenty one say, no. Would any of those twenty one feel brave enough to say why they said no? Yes? Well I I so , should er be unhappy to see the, the the red-coated huntsmen a an abolished scenario. But, erm I think they could instead have an electric fox, if there's such a thing? Or, a drag and there's no need to interfere with the fox at all. Okay. Yes? They say that hunting's for er er human pleasure, er, I mean personally I've only been to one hunt, and I don't see what all the the, the, the, the trouble's about because the huntsman is only a spectator, it's the hounds that are hunting the fox and it is to keep the foxes down. What's better than , gassing, shooting, poisoning? Mm. What's more humane? So you think hunting's fair enough? From my point of view, yeah. Yes? Beside you. Yes, I I would have to, I'd have to disagree with er, my colleague here. Erm, I, it's not the shooting is, most certainly, as long as it's with a a qualified marksman Mm. it's most Mhm. definitely less cruel than hunting because the animal is chased and er, what it's heart is doing while it's being chased and it's, really is the idea's quite horrendous to me! And actually, hunting doesn't kill all that many foxes, a a hunt probably erm, kills one an, at a meet if they're lucky. But hunting does maintain jobs, and countryside people often say. Would anyone like Mm. to talk to, to to that? Yes? Well coming from a rural community erm hunting and shooting and fishing are very important to the Yeah. economy of the community and to have suburbia creeping in and trying to dictate to what has been the foundation of the of their economy, for many, many years is almost ridiculous! Mhm. Down there. I think the idea of taking a fox and having it ripped apart legitimized by our society is a bad message to pass onto our children! When children nowadays are becoming more responsible to our society, and they see us as one world we have a responsibility to protect ourselves and our world, and that includes the animals in it. The seventy nine of you who voted for banning hunting,a are you all townees, do you not understand th the fabric of er, of the country? Do you have an alternative to offer that would er, that would sustain that fabric? Yes? I live in the country, I live in the heart of the country right next to a sheep farm, and there's no co , no message at all from the farmer that foxes are a pest it's a misnomer put about by the hunt. Fox hunting was started, two hundred, three hundred years ago by the aristocracy because there wasn't enough deer, because the fo the forests were getting obliterated by the same pi , the same people, it was started as an entertainment, it's an entertainment now! And now the hunt are turning round and they're lying about what they're doing, they're saying it's pest control, they're saying, we do it, it's quick, it's a sharp nip in the back of the neck. It's not! The hunt encourages foxes into their land they actually build artificial earths, we saw one of Saturday when we were out protesting, the ar , they encourage foxes onto the land so they can hunt them. A hunt is no good without foxes. They don't want foxes Alright. to be depleted at any way, they encourage them! So you actually go out and do something about Yes. your your your er your feelings? Wha what do you do as a protester? We actually, I'm actually er, in the Scottish Action Against Blood Sports Aha. and we do many things, we write to MP's, we write to councils trying to get them banned off the land, and we've been very successful. We've actually helped stop the oldest hunt in Scotland, in Li Lithgo in Stirlingshire, which ended last year. We were very successful then and we've now progressed. We go out every single Saturday, weekdays if we can, and we try and stop the stop the fo , hounds killing the foxes So peacefully. so so you're proud of having stopped the oldest hunt in, in Scotland? Very! Right. I'd like to disagree with that. Ah. I'm an ex-master's wife from Lithgo in Stirlingshire hunt, and we had to stop because erm the country was disappearing underneath us. We had a new Mm. town built in our country with two motorways, and the towns have all expanded to great extent and that was why we had to give up, it was nothing to do with our friends the saboteurs. It was creeping suburbia then, it wasn't Creeping suburbia. So wha Yes. what do you do now with the, what do the old the old hunt's people do? Well we've, we just have to er, grin and bear it. There is nowhere else to go for us. Yes. I would like to ask the saboteurs how they can justify the fact that they ill-treat hounds and horses? Now I personally have had a horse actually had things thrown at it by saboteurs! I feel this is cruelty to horses. Yes. That's, that's just absolutely rubbish! I mean we don't Well you can't, you can't like er, you can't say that she might have something thrown at her horse cos maybe you weren't there and maybe Generally speaking Mm. erm, I mean people who spend their entire Saturday doing something that they, I mean, I don't enjoy going out every Saturday! I mean, I'd like to do the things that, my hobbies, but I go out there because I care and I see that I feel that it's necessary to, to actually stop these people tormenting an animal for fun and if I'm that concerned about animals, I'm not gonna stoop to to hurt a horse, or or the hounds! I mean I ride myself, I have dogs myself, I mean, it's just another excuse from the hunting fraternity, turn it round, blame the cruelty on the saboteurs when really there wouldn't be any saboteurs if there weren't people to kill foxes purely for fun! Do you want to come back on that? Yes. Erm we ha , we have had horses and hounds and damaged but apart from that I would ask the speaker who i , what Mm. or who is the fox's predator? After all, the mouse has a cat, so what is the fox's predator? Do you know much about fox ecology? Yes. Mm mm . Have you ever, ever looked into I'm willing, I'm willing to listen to you! well the , I think these people who concern themselves very much about dictating the do's and don't of fox hunting, if they were to spend a little more time about looking into the research of, how foxes actually live. Three hundred thousand foxes are killed annually in this country, either through hunting, which only attributes to a small two point percent, shooting, gassing, snaring, all of which happen during the hunting season as well. So I mean, these foxes are still widespread and abundant, they can sustain seventy percent losses, so what human intervention are you doing? I mean ha how can you say that killing fifteen thousand foxes a year is helping to control foxes? Up there. I hunt regularly Mhm. because I breed racehorses, I also am a farmer so I wear two hats, but I've actually seen foxes sit down we move the hounds move in,si sit down and scratch in the middle of a field, and then they think ah! Right we're off! But, in fact from a farmer's point of view they are a su a nuisance, we have a man who co , who supposedly raises pheasants, he traps them, he also trapped my dog and this is him ah, justified, his justification was there were too many foxes. Erm. and so therefore, we don't particularly pretend that they are Mm. that hunting justifies the the end of killing foxes but it does preserve country life. We're going to have to close, alas, because it's been very interesting, and er er er a very diverse, ninety six people think animals should have a better deal, seventy seven think that the use of animals in research is justified at ti , from time to time, and well over seventy Except . think that hunting should be banned. And, my final question to you, just out of curiosity is, are you ve , a vegetarian? Button one for yes, button two for no. I could of said do you eat animals, but I decided that would be insensitive, to those of you who are vegetarians. So, in this, very animal loving assembly, I think er, you would agree er, only twenty one are vegetarians and seventy nine people love animals but they also enjoy chewing on them from time to time. Wo would er any of you animal eaters like to say something about that position? Yes? Yes, I would As, as an S S P C A representative. and and also as a farmer, if I Mhm. might say, I'm a beef farmer, erm I enjoy my, my beef very much, my philosophy is that erm, if we're going to use animals we're going to eat the , their time here should be as humane, they should have as humane treatment as possible, and they should be free from fear, hunger and pain, and when the time comes for them to go they should know as little about it as possible. Yes, but they never do! You might say that about the human animal really, mightn't you? Yes Thank you all very much for a civilized and interesting discussion. Thank you for joining us. Goodbye. Of course. Of course. It wouldn't be the same place if I wasn't. It wouldn't be the same place if I wasn't. . I never should have . What's this? Oh she's . . Give me strength. er it was my stomach.

Still a bit loose in the morning are you? Aye. Still loose in the mornings. That's the worst I've ever had mind. the older you get th y you imagine it's worse. You know? Once it's past twenty one. Aye. Well you maybe think it's worse . in the morning but then after the diarrhoea stopped it was a kind of sickness you know ?

I phoned her and I says to her I says,. She said, well look, go back to your doctor she says. Don't quote me, she says. Mm. I said, if you'd have said what you should have said at the bloody tribunal. One of these capsules after your breakfast in the morning Mm. and after your cup of tea at five o'clock. Right. settle. Will it? Settle the . a cup of coffee that I'm ready to get on. That's right. First thing Yes. make a cup of coffee in the morning you know. Aye. Well that's why you're to take that as soon as you get, as soon as you start morning. this morning what I'd done this morning was just dancing about cos I, I had to go to the toilet I couldn't wait and I was dancing about and I said, I'm not gonna make it. with that cup of coffee and, oh yes you are. Oh She's a bad woman. She's a bad woman. She is. I was purple. That's terr oh that's terrible. Oh that's hard. And that's . Aye. Mm. Right Alec. Cheerio then. Cheerio now . Hello Chris We play games on it though. No Has anyone got a ? I don't think it's, I mean Good communication though. Mm. Try A two see if A two's on it. Yeah absolutely nothing at all. what sort of resistance on that lot? Christina go to your lecture tomorrow Say again? ten o'clock drive down to North Shields with all speed. What's this ? All speed Then you don't need to miss your lecture. Oh no, right. Shame, bad luck Chris. Can you drive over with either Christina or Edward? Yeah Where was that man that wanted Is he willing to pay for them? Oh yeah whooo! Hurray ! Oh well done Lily. Oh I just wanted to ask you how to work the machine but it's done now. Oh right. Good. Oceans and climate, it's not currents it's oceans and climate. Who? We're missing out currents. I might have to steal some more paper later on Mm! but I'll give it you back. Can I switch the lights on? Yeah. The highly productive waters off once supported one of the most bountiful fisheries in the world but in nineteen eighty three the which produced the fish failed and the fishery crashed. Deprived of the which they the marine iguanas of the Galapagos starved to death. Arid equatorial islands were transformed by rainfall but their sea bird populations disappeared. had returned The climatic perturbations known as alminio seemed to occur every two to ten years. The nineteen eighty two to three event was one of the most severe on record and its affects were felt around the world. Large parts of Africa, India and Australia were ravished by drought while the west coast of the Americas was lashed by storms and torrential rain. The nineteen eighty two to three event was also the most comprehensibly observed so far. The changing patterns of sea surface temperature were recorded by satellite mounted sensors and they showed a region of unusually warm water travelling across the Pacific. But why did this happen? At the time a number of instrumented buoys were moored along the equator and were sending back information about the wind and sea conditions. In addition, large numbers of drifter buoys were launched into the ocean off Peru and for several months they were tracked via the Argos satellite as they drifted with the surface currents. You can see the paths of the drifter buoys looking like comet tails thin arrows centred on the equator show wind direction while the thicker arrows show current direction. Watch the buoy drifting westwards just north of the equator, as it approaches one of the moorings it suddenly changes direction with the current. Normally we'd expect these buoys to move west in the south equatorial current under the influence of the south easterly trade winds but during alminio winds become weak and westerly and buoys putting off the coast of Peru seemed to wander about aimlessly. Other buoys previously moving westwards now changed direction. So it seems that the weakening of the trade winds allowed more surface water normally piled up in the western Pacific to flow back eastwards across the ocean. But it's not as simple as that. Sea surface temperature affects processes in the atmosphere ocean and atmosphere form one system. Our work proceeds by trying to model this ocean atmosphere system and initially we made these models to develop an understanding but it turned out that the models worked pretty well to make predictions. Now in order to make a prediction of what say what's going to happen this year I would have to know the state of the system of the ocean and the atmosphere on January first and in order to do that in an ideal world I would have a tremendous amount of data about the ocean and about the atmosphere and be able to put it into this model but this data, by and large, doesn't exist. What we do have are some relatively scanty observations of the surface movements over the tropical Pacific based on volunteer observers on merchant ships. We need the winds everywhere and we rely on people in Florida state to take these very sparse observations and turn them into a map which covers the whole surface of the tropical Pacific. We then take those kind of and use it in an ocean to create the state of the ocean. Now we have the ocean and the atmosphere and we can go and we go forward and, in a good year, if we're lucky, the way the model evolves with the ocean driving the atmosphere and the atmosphere driving the ocean, mimics what happens in the real world and so we can make a prediction. Predictions have value of course because these are things which affect climate and affect people's lives, but also making a prediction is a way of trying to verify whether the understanding that we think we have about how the system works can actually be translated into equations which are put on a computer, and then when you let this go it in fact s does indeed do what the real world does. With increasing success at modelling changes in the tropical oceans, oceanographers are now aiming to predict global changes in the world ocean circulation experiment, W O C E for short. In this experiment we would be making measurements of the entire world ocean looking at essentially a snapshot view of the behaviour of the ocean during a five year period. Crucial to these observations are satellites, satellites have the ability to make measurements at least of the surface layer of the ocean on a nearly daily basis. Also the observations in all parts of the global ocean from ships, from moorings, from drifters on the surface of the ocean and floats in the interior of the ocean. This data set, coupled with extensive satellite observations, will give us for the first time a essentially a snapshot view of the behaviour of the ocean. Understanding how the global ocean works is important if we're to forecast climatic change. Pollution of our planet may already be warming the atmosphere and there's rising concern about what will happen at the poles. The polar regions of the ocean play a very crucial role in the global climate system. It's in these areas that the ocean heat is lost or vented to the atmosphere as this heat vent was carried into the ocean
