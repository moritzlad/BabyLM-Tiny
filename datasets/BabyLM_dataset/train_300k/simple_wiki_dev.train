Francetić was born in Otočac on July 3, 1912. After gymnasium (high school) he went to study law at the University of Zagreb, were he joined the Ustaša movement. Soon after, he was exiled from Zagreb for five years as a result of his anti-Yugoslav political activities. He stayed in Otočac for a short time before emigrating to Italy in March 1933. He took the Ustaša oath in the Borgotaro camp on April 24, 1933, and then spent the following four years in Austria, Italy and Hungary. In Hungary he joined to the Ustashe terrorist group camp at Jankapuszta, under new, conspirative name 'Laszlo'. After the assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia he was interned on Sardinia by Mussolini at the request of the Yugoslav government. After a general declaration of amnesty in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Francetić returned to Croatia in November 1937, but was immediately arrested and exiled to his hometown. The next year Francetić returned to Zagreb hoping to complete his study of law but was forced to complete his military service instead. In late 1940 he was again arrested in Zagreb because of a congratulatory telegraph to Jozef Tiso, president of the newly formed Slovak Republic (1939–1945), signed by a number of Croat nationalists. He was again exiled to his native Otočac. After delivering an inflammatory nationalistic speech at a local school's New Year's celebration in Otočac on January 12, 1941, he escaped to Germany to avoid another arrest. War and war crimes. Francetić earned his only military education and officer rank while serving the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Army. He became a non-commissioned officer in the rank of sergeant. About Francetić's military experience and knowledge, his Ustashe superior Eugen Dido Kvaternik wrote: "He did not have basic military knowledge nor military education, nor did he have any talent for basic military organization.". After establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 he and other 10 Ustašas organized the Black Legion (Croatian: Crna Legija). Jure Francetić became the leader of the Black Legion and earned the rank of colonel in the Ustaša army. Kvaternik believed that Francetić "a born guerrilla and a son of our mountainous Hercegovina" was the reason good enough to put him in the role of military leader in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to consolidate the Ustashe party power, much of the party work in the province he put in the hands of Catholic priests. Francetić's Ustashe took control over the local administration by dismissing all civil servants and teachers belonging to the category of "Srbijanci", as well as those who were Jews. Killings, arrests, and deportation of Serbs and Jews was a regular duty of Francetić's henchmen - based and justified by the official Ustashe policy which demanded total extermination of Jews and murder, expulsion, and conversion to the Roman Catholicism of Serb population in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Francetić participated personally in arresting and interrogations of prominent Serbian and Jewish leaders (Vaso Miskin, Albahari) and ordered the murders of some of them. He even turned his own Sarajevo apartment into the prison kitchen and laundry room. Justification for the slaughter of Bosnian Serbs and Jews Francetic found in " the propaganda of 'the Jewish communist hydra' had succeeded in misleading a majority of the Serb Orthodox population in eastern Bosnia into committing 'criminal acts against the state' "and concluded that "the 'most drastic means' would have to be employed against them." Ustashe's unseen cruelty and savagery applied against Serbs and Jews even prompted the German command to demand that Francetić, as the commander of the 1st Brigade Black Legion, be dismissed. Pavelić defied and promoted Francetić to commander of all Ustashe field formations. In the pre-war times about 15,000 Jews lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina. About 3,000 women and children of this number - were arrested and kept in Kruschnitze concentration camp (Bosnia). Later they will be deported to Jasenovac and Stara Gradiska concentration camps. Additional 7,000 Bosnian Jews will be deported directly to Jasenovac concentration camp. Death. Francetić died on December 27 or 28, 1942. While flying to Gospić on December 22, his plane was downed by Yugoslav Partisans near the village of Močile, near Slunj, which was the Partisan-held area. Both he and his pilot were immediately captured by Partisan village guards and peasants and Francetić received numerous blows with pitchforks. Severely wounded, he was taken to NOVJ General Staff Hospital where Partisan surgeons attempted to save his life in order to exchange him for inmates of Ustaše camps and prisons, but failed. Ustashe authorities were so concerned about the effect of his death would have on supporters of their movement that the news of his death was delayed until the beginning of March 1943. Official announcement of his death came on March 31, 1943., when Ustashe declared eight days of official mourning. Memorials of hatred.

There are three main kinds of rocks: igneous rock, metamorphic rock, and sedimentary rock. Each of these rocks can change into the other kinds by physical processes: cooling, melting, heat, weathering/erosion, compacting (squeezing tightly together), cementing, and pressure. When heated deep under ground, rocks become magma (liquid rock). Above ground, it is called lava. Sediment, the particles from rock erosion and weathering, is the basis for sedimentary rock of the future. Igneous rock is hardened magma, which can happen above or below ground. It can melt into magma, erode into sediment, or be pressed tightly together to become metamorphic. Metamorphic rock is igneous or sedimentary rock that has been heated and squeezed. It can erode into sediment or melt into magma. It is formed under extreme pressure and temperature deep inside mountain chains. Sedimentary rock is compacted sediments which can come from any of the other rocks, plus remains of living things. It can erode back into sediment, or be pressurized into metamorphic rock and can be melted to magma, which forms igneous rocks. These processes can occur in different orders, and the cycle goes on forever. Earth has several processes for changing rocks. Wind and water can create sediment from rocks, and movement of one tectonic plate against another creates enormous heat and pressure which affects rocks greatly. Subduction converts all kinds into magma, which eventually rejoins the cycle as igneous rocks. = = = Herbert Prohaska = = = Herbert Prohaska (born 8 August 1955 in Vienna, Austria) is a retired Austrian football player.

It could be watched form anywhere on the world. That happened on Easter Monday, 25 April 2011. The organisers did that to show that very fast broadband is useful. Very fast broadband helps community groups to upload content to the web. The organisers says Twicket was the first village cricket match ever to be streamed online. Twicket is a made up word. The "Tw" is from Twitter. The "icket" is from Cricket. There were reports about Twicket on BBC television news, on BBC Radio London, on TalkSport, and on Radio New Zealand. It was written about by "The Guardian", and "Metro". It was mentioned on Twitter by Stephen Fry, the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones and Jonathan Agnew. Agnew is the BBC's cricket correspondent. Background. John Popham is a consultant. He decided to show Twicket online after seeing two comments on Twitter. In the first comment, Dan Slee said he wanted to see news about his a local village cricket team on Twitter. Then, Chris Conder mentioned that she was testing a new 30Mbps, symmetrical internet connection. "Symmetrical internet" means that the upload speed is as fast as the download speed. Conder lives in a village called Wray. Wray is in Lancashire, England. The connection was installed in Wray by Lancaster University Wray is one of only three villages in the UK to have a symmetrical community network. Conder told Popham that a special cricket match was going to be played in Wray. The match was part of the village’s Scarecrow Festival. The Scarecrow Festival happens every year. The match was between Wray and a team called "The Rest of the World". Popham said: I'm confident we can do this, because the village Wi-Fi has a 30Mbps upload speed ... It's a bit of fun, but it has a serious purpose too. The serious side is to demonstrate that it can be done, it possible to live broadcast events like this using relatively cheap equipment and a good internet connection. It will also demonstrate the importance of good internet connectivity in rural areas, and the need for fast connections if we are to realise the aspiration to use the internet to enable more people to produce their own content. The match. The match was 20 overs per side. This is called the Twenty20 format. There was an extra rule that said that any batsman who scored 20 runs had to retire. Wray won the toss. They decided to bowl first. After 20 overs, The Rest of the World had scored 69 runs and lost 5 wickets. That meant that Wray needed 70 runs off 20 overs. Wray managed to do that. Their final runs were a six. Wray won in their eleventh over. They won by 8 wickets. After the cricket match, there was a tug o'war contest. It was also streamed live. The rest of the world won. Interviews with some of the cricket players and other people were also shown on the internet. Media. The event was streamed on a website called Bambuser.

It started on the 16th of September 1810 since Mexican-born Spaniards ("criollo people"), Mestizos and Amerindians wanted their independence from Spain. The idea of Mexican independence went back to the years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Martín Cortés led a revolt against the Spanish government. After the Conspiracy of the Machetes failed in 1799, the War of Independence really started with the Grito de Dolores in 1810. Spain was busy fighting for its independence against the invading First French Empire during the Peninsular War and most of Latin America revolted. Beginning. Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, was a Mexican priest and a member of a group of educated "Criollos" in Querétaro. They met in "tertulias" (salons) and decided in 1810 that a revolt against the colonial government was needed because Napoleon I had replaced the King of Spain with a French foreigner. Hidalgo worked closely with Ignacio de Allende, a nobleman with military training, for a battle in December 1810. They were betrayed by a member of the group. Hidalgo turned to his parishioners in the town of Dolores. Around 6:00 a.m. on September 16, 1810, he declared independence from the Spanish crown and war against the government in what was known as the "Grito de Dolores". The revolutionary army decided to fight for independence and marched on to Guanajuato, which was a major colonial mining center that was governed by Spaniards and criollos. There, the leaders of the "Citizens' Army," which was poorly organized, locked themselves in the granary and killed most of the Spaniards and Criollos who were there. That included high-ranking nobles and supporters of the fight for independence, which caused Hidalgo and Allende to fight with each other. Allende no longer wanted to fight alongside Hidalgo and left with his soldiers. On October 30, Hidalgo's army fought the Spanish resistance at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces and won. In January 1811, Spanish forces fought the Battle of the Bridge of Calderón and won. That made the rebels flee towards the United States-Mexican border, where they hoped to escape, but they were caught by the Spanish Army. Hidalgo and what was left of his army were caught in the state of Coahuila at the Wells of Baján. He had a trial done by the Spanish Inquisition on 30 July 1811 and was executed. After Hidalgo's death of Father Hidalgo, the leadership of the revolutionary army was taken over by José María Morelos. Under his leadership, the cities of Oaxaca and Acapulco were taken. In 1813, the Congress of Chilpancingo had its first meeting. On 6 November, the Congress signed the first official document of independence, known as the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America. A long war followed at the Siege of Cuautla. In 1815, Morelos was caught by Spanish colonial authorities. He was put on trial and executed for treason in San Cristóbal Ecatepec on 22 December. Independence. By the early 1820s, the independence movement was close to collapsing. Two of its main leaders had been executed, and the rebels could not easily fight the well-organized Spanish military. Also, many of the most influential criollos did not care any more. The violence of the unorganized army of Hidalgo and Morelos was not liked. The Mexicans wanted a better and less bloody way to get their independence. In December 1820, Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent a force led by a royalist criollo officer, Colonel Agustín de Iturbide, to fight in Oaxaca. Iturbide was famous for the way in which he went after the rebels during the early independence struggle. The fight at Oaxaca came at the same time as successful military coup in Spain against the monarchy of Ferdinand VII. Ferdinand was forced to reinstate the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812. When that news reached Mexico, Iturbide saw it as an opportunity for the criollos to gain control of Mexico. After clashing with Guerrero's forces, Iturbide switched sides. He invited the rebel leader to meet to discuss a new independence struggle. In the town of Iguala, Iturbide created three rules, or "guarantees," for Mexican independence from Spain: He made his troops accept these rules, which are known as the Plan of Iguala. Iturbide then persuaded Guerrero to join his forces in support of the new independence. A new army, the Army of the Three Guarantees, was placed under Iturbide's command to enforce the plan. It was so broad that it pleased both patriots and loyalists. The goal of independence and the protection of Roman Catholicism brought together all factions. Iturbide's army was joined by rebel forces from all over Mexico. When the rebels' victory became certain, the viceroy resigned. On August 24, 1821, representatives of the Spanish crown and Iturbide signed the Treaty of Córdoba, which recognized Mexican independence under the terms of the plan of Iguala. On September 27, the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City. The next day, Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire. On the night of May 18, 1822, a mass of people marched through the streets. They demanded for Iturbide to accept the throne. The next day, the Congress declared Iturbide emperor of Mexico. = = = Joe Sakic = = = Joseph Steven Sakic (born July 7, 1969 in Burnaby, British Columbia) is a Canadian retired ice hockey centre.

In that case it meant not to tell senior government officials about illegal CIA activities. These officials could then defend themselves if the activities were discovered. They would be able to say quite plausibly, and perhaps truthfully, that they did not know anything about it (deniability). It meant that actions of the CIA could not be blamed on the President of the USA. The concept is tied up with the idea of a "paper trail", whereby journalists find evidence of orders or discussions between senior officials and agents doing the forbidden acts. Interceptions of phone messages or e-mail messages may also be evidence of wrongdoing by officials. If there is no definite evidence of wrongdoing by an official, then his/her denial can be taken as sincere. The denial is "plausible" (or, at least, "might" be true). That achieves one of the main goals of public relations: for officials at least not to be caught red-handed doing something illegal. The effect of officials being caught red-handed can be extremely serious: see Watergate scandal. Plausible deniability refers to the denial of blame in (formal or informal) chains of command. Senior people may give indirect and vague orders. For example, Henry II "Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?" or even less direct "Someone should do something about that". The intended message is understood. Later, when the deed is done, the higher man can say "I never intended that to happen". Plausible deniability is achieved when no records are kept of any instructions. It becomes impossible to find out who was responsible for the actions taken. If these activities become public, high-ranking officials may deny any knowledge of such act or any connection to the people used to carry out such acts. It usually means that it has been planned in advance, setting up the conditions to avoid responsibility for future actions or knowledge. = = = Citroën C5 = = = The Citroën C5 is a car produced by Citroën.

It is also very good at holding water so it is used in the soil of plants in pots and helping to grow seeds. Because the Vermiculite grains are spongy (they can be pressed flat and then they open again) but not hard they are used inside cases or boxes to protect articles from breakage when they are being transported. Vermiculite is also used in hydroponics as a material for the roots of plants to hold on to. Because it does not burn Vermiculite is used with other materials in fillings in walls or ceilings (the roof of a room) to stop the spread of fire.

Biography. Peter Le Lievre was educated at Elizabeth College, he never married and lived all his life at 17 Hauteville, St Peter Port with his two sisters. Career. Although known today as an artist Le Lievre was better known in his day as a businessman, and as the Lt Col of the Artillery Regiment in the Guernsey Militia. He did however design two lighthouses for St Peter Port harbour, and some of his works were published in his lifetime. It was only after the death of his sister Mary in 1904 that his works were exhibited publicly. His work has gained in popularity since then. In June 2010 a Blue Plaque to commemorate his life was unveiled at 17 Hauteville. = = = Blue plaque = = = The blue plaque scheme is a way for remembering the links between famous people and buildings by placing commemorative plaques on the walls. The scheme was started by the Royal Society of Arts in London, and the very first plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta placed on the outside of a former home of Lord Byron (since demolished). The Society erected 36 plaques between 1866 - 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the London County Council (1901-65) (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and later the Greater London Council (1965-86) and most recently English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the member countries of the United Kingdom. Outside London. English Heritage looks after the Blue plaque scheme in the London Boroughs. Similar schemes exist outside London, run by each local authority. The system has been adopted outside the United Kingdom too, for example, in June 2010 a Blue Plaque was put on the home of Guernsey artist Peter Le Lievre. = = = Denial Bay = = = Denial Bay is the name for both a small bay on the coast of South Australia, and a small fishing town built at the bay. The bay was named by explorer Matthew Flinders on 7 February 1802. Flinders had hoped that bay was bigger and would have provided better access into the inland of South Australia. One of the first European settlers was a sheep farmer, William McKenzie, who built a house in the area in 1889. The town was known as Mac's Town, and in 1910 the government officially named it McKenzie. In 1940 it was named Denial Bay. = = = Burhou = = = Burhou (pronounced bu-ROO) is a small island approximately northwest of Alderney that is part of the Channel Islands. No one lives on Burhou, and it is a bird sanctuary, so landing there is banned from 15 March to 27 July. The island's wildlife includes a colony of puffins (declining in numbers) and large numbers of rabbits. It has no landing stage as such, but visitors use a small inlet. In rough weather it may be impossible to land. The Guernsey botanist E.D. Marquand called it, "the most desolate and lonely of all the islands in our archipelago." He had to spend the night there, as his return journey was delayed by fog. The 1906 book, "The Channel Pilot" states - The States of Alderney member, John Beaman has political responsibility for the island. Burhou, like many other Channel Islands (e.g. Lihou, Jethou), has the Norman suffix "-hou", meaning a small island, from the Old Norse "holmr". According to Dr. S.K. Kellet-Smith, "bur" refers to a storehouse - "Burhou is just the place where a fisherman would place a depository for his gear". Signs of human occupation/visitation are much older. Flint flakes have been found on the island, and one is currently in the Alderney Museum. In 1847, F.C. Lukis found two standing stones, but these have since been lost, according to the archaeologist David Johnston. The hut. According to the Assize Roll of the 14th century, Burhou was a rabbit warren, and a refuge for fishermen. This would have meant that there would have been some kind of shelter there, as it would be difficult for the fishermen to take refuge without it. A hut was built on the island in 1820 as a shelter for fishermen and sailors at the instigation of General Le Mesurier (The Governor), but was destroyed during the German occupation of the Channel Islands (the Nazis used it for target practice during WWII). The hut was replaced in 1953, with basic accommodation which is rented out to visitors by Alderney Harbour Office. Attempts have been made to raise sheep there. In 1900, a French couple lived there for a year. The soil is thin, and spray often goes right over the island, so the soil is very salty. The island has no fresh water supply for much of the year, and has to rely on shipments, or formerly tanks. Flora and fauna. The island's animals are mainly birds, although rabbits are long established here. The island has many puffins and some storm petrels. Although the latter have declined, they used to nest in the cottage's storm loft. Roderick Dobson in "Birds of the Channel Islands" said that puffins had been plentiful for over a century. The "Birds of Guernsey" (1878) by Cecil Smith states likewise. The puffins have had to compete with gulls, and in 1949, hundreds died from red mite infestation. The rabbit holes on the island make good nesting for them. Amongst the plants noted here are sea spurry, forget-me-nots, scarlet pimpernel, field bugloss, bracken and nettles. E.D. Marquand counted 18 species of plant here in 1909, but by the late twentieth century Frances Le Sueur and David McClintock found 45, which they wrote up in the "Transactions of La Société Guernesiaise" = = = Oscillation = = = Oscillation is when something "vibrates", or repeats the same pattern. Many things in nature move back-and-forth or up-and down when pushed or struck. In time, natural oscillators slow down and stop because of friction. = = = Ortac = = = Ortac is a small uninhabited islet about 5 km West of the coast of Alderney near to the islet of Burhou. It measures about 50 by 70 metres (160 by 230 ft). A.H. Ewen thinks that the rock's name meant "large rock at the edge" from the Norman language "Or" (edge) + "Etac" (Stack). Alexander Deschamps said that the French used to call it "the Eagle's Nest". Geology. Ortac and Alderney, along with the Casquets, are part of the same sandstone ridge. Paul Naftel, a Guernsey artist, drew Ortac, and the drawing appeared in Ansted &amp; Latham's book, "The Channel Islands" (1862). The writers themselves commented - If the sea bottom, which is in very few parts as much as 20 fathoms deep, were elevated 120 feet (37 m), the island of Alderney, the Burhou and Ortac group, and the Casquets would be connected by low land, and form a narrow island around 12 miles (19 km) long. The 1906 book, "The Channel Pilot" states - Between Ortac, Verte Tête and Burhou Island, are scattered many dangerous rocks, and ledges among which the streams run with great velocity. It also supposedly contains a cave known as "the Oven". Victor Hugo. Victor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands says in his novel, "The Laughing Man" ("L'Homme qui Rit"): "...on the port bow arose, standing stark, cut out on the background of mist, a tall opaque mass, vertical, right-angled, a tower of the abyss. It was the Ortac rock. The Ortac, all of a piece, rises up in a straight line to eighty feet above the angry beating of the waves... An immovable cliff, it plunges its rectilinear planes apeak into the numberless serpentine coils of the sea. At night it stands an enormous block, resting on the folds of a huge black sheet. In time of storm it awaits the stroke of the axe which is 'the thunderclap'...""To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost..." Meanwhile, in another work, "The Toilers of the Sea" ("Les Travailleurs de la mer"), he mentions the curious anecdote that Ortac was inhabited by Saint Malo: "The Norman fishermen who frequent the Channel have many precautions to take at sea, by reason of the illusions with which Satan environs them. It has long been an article of popular faith that Saint Maclou inhabited the great square rock called Ortac, in the sea between Alderney and the Casquets; and many old sailors used to declare that they had often seen him there, seated and reading a book. Accordingly the sailors, as they passed, were in the habit of kneeling many times before the Ortac rock, until the day when the fable was destroyed, and the truth took its place. For it has been discovered, and is now well established, that the lonely inhabitant Of the rock is not a saint, but a devil. This evil spirit, whose name is Jochmus, had the impudence to pass himself of; for many centuries as Saint Maclou. Even the Church herself is not proof against snares of this kind. The demons Ragubel, Oribel, and Tobiel were regarded as saints until the year 745, when Pope Zachary, having at length exposed them, turned them out of saintly company. This sort of weeding of the saintly calendar is certainly very useful; but it can only be practiced by very accomplished judges of devils and their ways." Wildlife. Ortac is noted for its large gannet colony. This is of fairly recent origin. On 19 June 1940, Major J.A.A. Wallace was preparing for the evacuation of Alderney, and went there to inspect the kittiwake colony. He found only one gannet. He found none on Les Etacs off Alderney. Now both swarm with the birds. In 1979, a mission with two naval helicopters was launched to remove nets and rubbish used in nests and which were trapped. Airway R41. Romeo 41 is an Airway over the English Channel from the Channel Islands Control Area to the Solent Control Area. There is a reporting point named ORTAC at southern boundary between Romeo 41 and the Channel Islands Control Zone. Its position is 49° 59' 57N, 2° 0' 18W, which is about 30 miles north-north-east of Alderney. This is not coincident with the islet named Ortac, but its name is undoubtedly derived from the islet. Many Standard Instrument Approach and Departure Procedures into Channel Islands airports use ORTAC as part of the procedure. A typical clearance for an Aurigny flight from Alderney to Southampton will read as follows: "Ayline 123: your clearance is to the Northern Zone boundary via ORTAC, on track Romeo 41." = = = 5.56×45mm NATO = = = The 5.56×45mm NATO round, pronounced "five-five-six", is an intermediate cartridge and the main bullet type used by guns made for NATO militaries. It was first used in the Vietnam War as the main bullet used by the US military. Early in the Vietnam War, the main gun used by American soldiers was the M14. Many soldiers complained that the 7.62mm NATO round used by the M14 was too heavy and that the gun kicked back too hard to shoot accurately when shooting in full-automatic fire. To solve this problem, the US military decided replace the M14 and the 7.62mm NATO by creating a new rifle that would shoot lighter bullets with less kickback. That gun would be the M16A1, the first standard issue gun to fire the 5.56mm NATO bullet. Even though the M16A1 had many design flaws that would cause the gun to jam, the 5.56 bullet performed well in battle. The 5.56 did so well that the Soviet Union made its own intermediate cartridge, the 5.45 x 39mm, to compete with NATO. Guns that use the 5.56 include the M16, the M4 carbine, the AR-15, the FAMAS, the G36, the SCAR-L, and the M249 light machine gun. = = = Teatre Sans = = = Teatre Sans is a small theatre in Palma de Mallorca, capital of the Balearic Islands, Spain, that has been opened for more than 25 years.

Later, they also began to offer lectures and talks. In 1984, the theatre company TRIP TRUP Teatre (later Estudi Zero Teatre ESTUDI ZERO ), rented the theatre as a place for reheasals. The theatre company ESTUDI ZERO renovated the old theatre and they are now responsible running not only the theatre, but also the drama school and the café.

In the fall of 1906, it became the first airplane to fly in Europe. Santos-Dumont tried several times before he truly managed to fly in the "14-bis". His first attempt in July 1906 did not work. In September, he managed two short hops. In October, the "14-bis" flew for 50 meters. That was the first flight that the Aero Club of France ever officially witnessed. In November, he was able to keep the "14-bis" in the air for 220 meters, 6 meters up in the air. According to the Aero Club of France, the "14-bis" was 40 feet wide from wingtip to wingtip, 33 feet wide, and weighed 352 pounds. It used an Antoinette engine. It was made out of pine and bamboo with aluminum to keep it together. Its wings were made out of silk cloth. The "14-bis" had three different sets of controls so Alberto Santos-Dumont could steer. Some were tied to his shoulders so that he looked like he was dancing or shaking while in the air. No one knows where the original "14-bis" from the fall of 1906 is now. Experts think Santos-Dumont took it apart and used the pieces to build other airplanes. Some people, especially in Brazil, believe the "14-bis" was the first airplane to fly, before the Wright Brothers' "Flyer". The main reason for this is that although the Wright Brothers flew the "Flyer" at Kitty Hawk in 1903, they did not tell many people about it right away. Europeans saw Alberto Santos-Dumont fly the "14-bis" in 1906 before they heard about the Wrights flying the "Flyer" in 1903. This was because the Wright Brothers hoped to patent their work and make money, so they kept most of their experiments a secret. Alberto Santos Dumont was not trying to make money, so he invited almost anyone who wanted to come watch him work. However, the Wright Brothers did invite witnesses to their first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 to watch and take a photograph. By 1906, the Wright Brothers had flown many of their planes many times, for as far as 39 kilometers.

Peter is just in a bad mood, stingy, and he forbids Lisbeth from helping the poor despite her immense wealth, which is why she is soon considered even more greedy. One day, when Lisbeth is alone and Peter isn't there, a little old man come by and asked Lisbeth for a drink of water. She offers him wine and bread. When the man is about to leave, he thanks her, and says that such a good heart will not go unrewarded. At that moment, Peter returns. He is furious, and uses the wooden handle of a whip to beat Lisbeth. Lisbeth instantly dies from the attack. Peter regrets what he has done, and the little old man identifies himself as the Glass Man. The Glass Man says that Peter has trampled on the most beautiful flower in the Black Forest. Peter blames the Glass Man. The Glass Man gets angry and turns into a monster. Only for the sake of Peter's dead wife, who helped him, does the Glass Man give Peter eight days to thin about his life. Peter has sleeping problems. He also hears voices telling him to get a warmer heart. He lies to the people who miss Lisbeth. He tells them that his wife took a surpise trip somewhere. Also, the things that happened make him think about his own death. Finally he goes into the forest, and he summons the Glass Man. He tells him, that he still has a last wish, and that he wants his heart back.The Schatzhauser cannot help him, because the deal "heart against money" wasn't made with him. He tels him a trick how he can outwit Michel. For a third time, he goes to Dutch Michael. Peter claims that Dutch Michael cheated, and that he did not receive a heart of stone. Michael wants to prove him wrong. As a test, he puts back Peter's real heart. Peter then takes a glass cross that he had received from the Glass Man. He points the cross in the direction of Michael. That way, he is able to keep furious Michael at a distance. He escapes to the Glass Man. Now, Peter regrets what he has done in his life. The Glass Man unites him with his mother, and with Lisbeth, who has returned from the dead. On the advice of the little glass man, he works hard as a charcoal burner and becomes a respected man even without much money. For the birth of his son, he receives four rolls full of thalers from the glass man as a godfather's gift. Analysis. The tale is different from the other tales. It does not start with the formula "Once upon a time...". The first sentence is more like that of travel literature: "Anyone travelling through Swabia should never forget to take a look into the Black Forest; not because of the trees, ... but because of the people." Ottmar Hinz says the story is at the threshold of literary realism. There is a psychogram of wounded, wounding and healing masculitiy. The story also preserves the Romanticism's longing for love and its belief in the good in people. This becomes clear when Lisbeth and Peter find each other again and have a child, as well as in the mother's return. The people who exchanged their feeling heart against a stone, and who have become successful or appear sympathetic through their ruthlessness, probably made the author think of psychopaths. Peter Munk is half orphan. He is a coal-burner. At the time the story was written, only few coal-burners were left. Coal mines and steam engines were able to carry out the work faster. Hauff's father died in 1809. Hauff was only seven years old at the time. The problems young Hauff had could be mirrored in the character Peter Munk. At the start, Munk is morally and psychologically unstable. He also is plagued by feelings of inferiority, he does not have a high self-esteem. Peter goes to the “wrong father” Holländermichel because he has no basic trust in his work sense . Everyone can identify with the common name Peter. Apparently, the Little Glass Man is the conscience. In Freud's words, the superego. To use Jung's terminology, it is the positive archetype of the father. It is the moral compass, what Socrates would have called the "daimonion. It also stands for “bourgeois commercial industriousness and social morality,” while the Holländermichel represents the unbridled “profit-seeking of commercial capital in the first third of the 19th century.” The name Ezekiel comes from the biblical prophet Ezekiel, who said: “I will take out your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.” " At first, Peter is in a state of self-alenatiion. He gamles, dances, and drinks. He wants to get wealth and prestige. Peter is in middle adulthood, at at time where he needs to decide whether to found a family, build a house and engage in social activiies. At first, Peter fails at these tasks. Sandra Kegel's “The Insecure Man” describes the option he made as a “convertible instead of a stroller”. But at the end of the story he holds a “beautiful boy” in his hands as a proud father. The change to the positive comes about through a change in his inner attitude and his evaluation standards with the help of the little glass man, who had given him a deadline of eight days. Peter manages to turn around in a symbolic seven days. Money dominates social practice almost as a leitmotif : in "The Cold Heart", opinions, social interaction, expressions of respect, influence and reputation depend almost exclusively on material wealth. As a symbol, the heart of stone represents the increasingly strong connection between wealth, greed and hard-heartedness. Hauff completed the work in July 1827. This was shortly after an economic depression. The depression was triggered by Great Britain. Entire industries disappeared in southern and western Germany. This was because of the mass-production of British industry, Romatic period. There are connection to the Romantic era. During that period, it was quite common to write fairy tales in prose, and not in verse. Hauff used a legend; Using the legend of the “Glass Man” he depicted the romantic search for happiness . Another sign of the era visible here is the turn towards the mystical, uncanny, ghostly and local legends . The main keyword of romanticism is "Longing". Kohlenmunk-Peter is granted three wishes in the course of the story. What can also be seen is that characters first tend towards self-destruction. Peter becomes wealthy, but this wealth does not bring happiness. It makes him miserable. His longing turns into greed and malice. But Kohlenmunk-Peter does not give up his search for happiness. At the end of the story, he finds it at the side of his wife. Movies. The story has been turned into many movies. = = = Social news = = = Social news is a contemporary phenomenon characterized by the dissemination and interaction of news content through various social media platforms. Unlike traditional news outlets, which are typically curated and distributed by professional journalists and editors, social news platforms rely heavily on user-generated content and engagement mechanisms to surface and propagate stories. This paradigm shift in news consumption allows individuals to discover and share information based on their personal interests, preferences, and social networks. Prominent platforms within the social news landscape include Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook, each playing a distinct role in shaping the dissemination and discussion of news. Reddit, renowned for its diverse array of communities (subreddits), facilitates the sharing of news articles, participation in discussions, and voting on the visibility of posts. Twitter serves as a real-time news aggregator, enabling users to follow journalists, news organizations, and influencers for up-to-the-minute updates. Facebook, boasting a vast user base, fosters the sharing of news stories among friends and family, often resulting in viral dissemination.A hallmark feature of social news is its interactive nature, allowing users to engage with news content through actions such as liking, commenting, and sharing. These dynamic interactions facilitate dialogue, debate, and occasionally misinformation, underscoring the complexities inherent in the democratization of news dissemination.Nevertheless, the proliferation of social news has raised concerns regarding information quality and reliability. In the absence of traditional gatekeepers, misinformation and fake news can propagate rapidly across social media platforms. Consequently, efforts by platforms, fact-checking organizations, and governments have been undertaken to mitigate misinformation and promote media literacy among users.In summary, social news represents a fundamental evolution in news consumption patterns within the digital era. While offering unparalleled access to diverse perspectives and real-time updates, it also poses challenges related to information accuracy, credibility, and susceptibility to manipulation. As social media continues to evolve, so too will the dynamics of social news and its societal implications. = = = Oriente International Airport = = = The Oriente International is the second most-important airport of the Island of Cuba.

The pamphlet supports women and talks seriously about women's writing. It brings a new voice to English writing, showing women's anger.

Stalin ordered Leon Trotsky to be assassinated in August 1940 during the Second World War, who had fled to Mexico in 1937. He was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan and the leader of the Azerbaijan SSR, between 1921 and 1926. He was Chief of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Leningrad, from 1927 until he was assassinated on 1 December 1934. The city Kirov and Kirov Oblast are named after Sergei Kirov. It is speculated by historians, that the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered his assassination, because he saw Kirov, who was popular, as a threat to his rule, and started the Great Purge as an excuse to eliminate all his real and potential rivals. = = = Large-scale structure of the Universe = = = The term Large Scale structure of the Universe refers to the patterns of galaxies and matter on scales much larger than individual galaxies and groupings of galaxies. These correlated structures can be seen up to billion of light years in length and are created and shaped by gravity. On large scales, the Universe displays coherent structure with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on scale(s)of ~1-3 megaparsecs(Mpc) which lie at the intersections of long filament of galaxies that are usually &gt;10 Mpc in length. Vast regions of relatively empty space, known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span in the volume in between these structures. It's amplified to enormous proportion by gravitational forces, producing ever-growing concentrations of dark matter in which ordinary gases cool, condense and fragment to create galaxies. The Large Scale Structure incorporates the notion of all the content in the universe which includes Galaxies —most of them bound in Galaxy clusters and Superclusters,Dark matter and Dark energy. While precise figures are impossible to acquire, it is currently thought that Dark Energy makes up 68% of the universe, Dark Matter follows with 27%, Radiation (Neutrinos and Photons) consisting of 0.1-0.2% meanwhile matter (anything made up of Atoms) consists of 4.9%. Other revised studies suggest that Dark Energy makes up 70% of the universe, Dark Matter following suit with 25%, Free Hydrogen and Helium make up ~4%,Neutrinos constituting 0.3% and other chemical elements constituting 0.003%. The composition and contents of the universe have changed over time,have influenced the Cosmos' evolution and will decide the Ultimate fate of the universe. After the Big Bang and for the next 3 billion years, the universe was Radiation dominated as can be evidenced from the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB).For the next 3—7.7 billion years, the universe was matter dominated and its expansion started to progressively slow down, however, since then, the universe became dominated by a poorly understood form on vacuum energy known as Dark Energy. — a form of energy that has since then accelerated the universe's expansion. Dark energy. "Main article: Dark energy"The term "dark energy" can be used to refer to a subset of all causes of the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. In 1998, two Cosmology research teams, the High-Z Supernova Search Team and the Supernova Cosmology Project set out to measure the universe's rate of expansion which, according to Cosmological methods of the time, should have being slowing down as the immense gravitational pull generated by the Cosmic Web should have dominated over the expansion rate drawing the observable universe's contents back into a singularity as the Big Crunch predicted. Instead, via the measurement of very distant supernovae, Cosmologists deduced that the universe was expanding, and that the expansion rate was indeed uncontrollably accelerating, seemingly caused by an unknown spacetime phenomena now given the term "dark energy." Dark Energy's nature is still unknown, even less well understood unlike the hypothetical dark matter. It is probably in the form of an exotic type of vacuum energy exerting negative pressure on the universe. Its density is also extremely low,~6×10-10 J/m3 or ~7×10-30 g/cm3. Much less than the density of normal matter or dark matter. However, it is dominant because (2.) Its values add up over large cosmic scales and dominates over gravitational energy at such scales. Due to this inherit dominance, it is Dark Energy's behavior which will dictate the universe's far future. Dark matter. "For the full article,see Dark matter"Dark matter is the term given to an apparent hypothetical invisible mass that is currently thought to consist of 85% of the universe's mass. It is thought that every galaxy has dark matter worth the galaxy's mass many times over, primarily situated at the outer edges of galaxies. It is currently agreed that dark matter must be some kind of hypothetical particle unknown to the Standard Model. Background to the discovery of dark matter. Dark Matter's existence was first postulated by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky who hypothesized it's existence based on observations of the Coma Cluster. Applying the virial theorem, Zwicky noticed that there was an apparent contradiction based on the speed of the galaxies which indirectly led him to obtain evidence of dark matter which he called dunkle materie (literally "dark matter"). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that to an estimate based on its brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated the cluster had about 400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravitational effect of the visible galaxies was far too small for such fast orbits, thus there must have been mass hidden from view. Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred that some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitational attraction to hold the cluster together. Zwicky's estimates were off by more than an order of magnitude, mainly due to an obsolete value of the Hubble constant, the same calculation today shows a smaller fraction, using greater values for luminous mass. Nonetheless, Zwicky did correctly conclude from his calculation that the bulk of the matter in the Coma cluster was dark matter. Generally though, it is agreed by physicists that dark matter will not play any significant role in regards to the Far Future of the universe 'Normal' Matter &amp; Radiation Baryonic Matter A baryon is a particle consisting of three quarks/antiquarks (In other words, a hadron). Therefore, baryonic matter can in very rather simple terms be referred to as anything consisting of particles consisting of three standard model based particles. By extension, this includes atoms,groups of atoms(molecules) and the various large scale structures they form such as humans,the Earth, stars etc. Baryonic matter in much simpler commutative terms is what can interact electromagnetically, gravitationally and via the weak force and the strong nuclear force. On the largest scales, normal matter contributes to the Cosmic Web. A spread collection of all the universe's contents in in its sheer volume into a series of protruding structures synonymous to webs. With the path constituent of galaxy filaments made up of Galactic walls which are then made up of superclusters,galaxy clusters, individual galaxy groups and on to individual collections of galaxies. Radiation. "For the full article, see Radiation" Radiation can best and most accurately be termed as the movement of particles or energy through space. There's many forms of radiation from gravitational waves (sometimes simply termed as "gravitational radiation") to electromagnetic radiation (light, also "electromagnetic waves.") However, due to such a broad definition, the universe is full of radiation everywhere, from the billions of neutrinos passing through our bodies and Earth to the light that is being received by your eyes. = = = Jim Iverson = = = James D.

The origin of the colors goes back to the 14th century during the time of an Iraqi poet known as Safi Al-Din Al-Hilli. In one of his poems, there is a line that makes reference to the four colors. The line talks about white representing the acts of people, the black representing their struggles, the green standing for the fields where these struggles are fought on, while the red is for swords. The first time these colors were used together was back in 1916 when the flag of the Arab Revolt was designed. The flag was a simple design involving three stripes of black, green, and white from the top respectively. The red color was in the shape of a triangle originating from the left side. There are several flags with these colors. These flags include Jordan, Palestine, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The brief union known as the Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan also had a flag that used the colors. The Arab Liberation Colors. The Pan-Arab colors continued to be used until the 1950s. From there onward, the Arab Liberation colors started becoming more popular and eventually replaced the Pan-Arab ones. The new colors were almost the same as the old ones with a slight difference. In the new scheme, the flag featured three bands of white, black, and red. The green was not eliminated but it was given much less prominence compared to previous designs. Under the new flag, the colors adopted a different meaning altogether. The black now stood for past foreign oppressors, the red symbolized the bloody sacrifices made, and the white was representative of a bright future full of hope. The inspiration for these new colors can be traced back to the Arab Liberation flag that was in use during the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 (also called the July 23 revolution). The revolution was led by two army officers, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Mohammed Naguib, who wanted to do away with the reign of King Farouk. The new colors appear today in several flags. These flags include those of Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Yemen. Even before Yemen merged, the rival states that made up the larger Yemen, North and South Yemen, both had the colors in their respective flags.

Eta originated from a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 31. The system organized very quickly as it moved west, and the cyclone peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on November 3. The storm started to quickly weaken as the system made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, late that same day. Eta weakened to a tropical depression as it slowly moved across Central America before moving north into the Caribbean, toward Cuba on November 7. Over the next five days, the system moved very oddly, moving through the Florida Keys, before moving into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Reaching hurricane strength for a short time, it weakened once more and quickly moved across the Southeastern United States on November 12. It dissipated the next day. Hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings happened along the coast of Honduras and Nicaragua as Eta approached. At least 178 deaths across Central America have been related to the storm. Eta brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Parts of Southern Florida had to be evacuated because of Eta and other floods. 11 deaths were related to the storm in the U.S. Nearly $8 billion in damages were reported across all affected areas by December 2020. Relief efforts for those hit by the storm were set up in several countries. About 2.5 million were affected by the storm, including 1.7 million in Honduras. Many Emergency Response Units were to help support affected people. About 100 tons of food and water were given to Nicaragua and Honduras from Panama. People left homeless were moved to many shelters after the storm had passed. Donations worth millions of USD had been given to affected countries to help recoveries. Storm history. On October 28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) started watching the Southwestern Caribbean. There was an area that could become a tropical cyclone. Over the next couple of days, the area became more organized, becoming a disturbance, and on October 31, satellite and microwave imagery said that a circulation had formed in the disturbance, and the NHC began issuing advisories on "Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine." Early on November 1, the system intensified into "Tropical Storm Eta", becoming the earliest tropical storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season, beating Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Continuing west due to a ridge, Eta slowly organized throughout the day as cold convection began to form on top of its center. After holding onto tropical storm strength for 15 hours, Eta began to intensify very quickly, becoming a Category 4 hurricane mid-day of November 2, with lots of lightning being observed in its eyewall. Eta begun to slow down and turn west-southwestward because of a ridge over the United States. Early on November 3, a airplane found the system still intensifying with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 927 mbar as it slowed. According to the NHC, Eta maintained its peak winds as it reached its lowest pressure of 923 mbar shortly after, marking its peak intensity as a strong Category 4 hurricane. Even though the storm was in a in a good location, Eta began to weaken six hours after its peak because of an eyewall replacement cycle, which it completed as it made landfall later that day, south of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and a pressure of 940 mbar. Land caused Eta to weaken very quickly as it moved slowly west after landfall with its eye disappearing and its convection weakening. Only a little over a day after Eta made landfall, Eta had weakened to a tropical depression. Eta, barely holding onto tropical cyclone status, began turning northeastward, eventually moving back over the Caribbean Sea on November 6 and speeding up due to a developing trough over the Gulf of Mexico. On November 7, the system started to become better organized, and it became a tropical storm again later that day. Even with strong wind shear, the storm continued to strengthen through the day and reached a second peak of winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a pressure of 991 mbar at 00:00 UTC on November 8. It then held its strength and slowed slightly before making landfall on the south central coast of Cuba at 09:00 UTC. Eta weakened after making landfall in Cuba's Sancti Spíritus Province, but this was brief as it quickly moved back over water in the Atlantic Ocean. Eta began to strengthen again as it turned toward Florida as a result of a low that had formed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea near the Isle of Youth. Eta briefly gained a eye feature before bad conditions removed most of its convection, though the storm was able to maintain its intensity as it grew in size and approached South Florida. At 04:00 UTC on November 9, Eta made its third landfall on the Lower Matecumbe Key in the Florida Keys with the same intensity as its Cuban landfall. It then passed just south of the southwestern coast of Florida as it turned west. Eta began moving southwestward under the influence of a strong ridge across the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and near the US East Coast. This also brought it into an area of very dry air, causing the storm to weaken and its area of gale-force winds to shrink. However, even after its center became sheared to the west of its convection, Eta began to intensify again over the warm waters of the Gulf. Eta than began to speed up north-northeast around the western edge of a subtropical ridge as its center reformed under the convection and an eye formed. Eta then regained hurricane status at 12:35 UTC on November 11, reaching a fourth peak intensity with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a pressure of 983 mbar. Shortly after its peak, dry air rapidly removed the convection and caused the eye to be gone, causing Eta to weaken back into a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC. The system turned further east and made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida at 09:00 UTC on November 12, with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm weakened over land as it sped toward the north-northeast, eventually emerging over the waters of the Atlantic near the Florida–Georgia border at 18:00 UTC. Eta came out with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) before restrengthening as it began its extratropical transition. The storm completed its transition on November 13. On the next day, Eta was absorbed into another frontal system to the north. Readying. Early on November 1, Honduras and Nicaragua put in Hurricane Watches and warnings for the northeastern coast of Honduras from Punta Patuca to Nicaragua and the northeastern coast of Nicaragua from the Honduras border to Puerto Cabezas. Later that day, a hurricane warning was put in from the Honduras–Nicaragua border to Sandy Bay Sirpi, while a tropical storm warning was put in for areas from Punta Patuca to the Honduras–Nicaragua border. A tropical storm watch was also issued from west of Punta Patuca westward to Punta Castilla late that same day. Central America. Nicaragua. Some people were worried that of storm surge along the coastline may happen, so Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega issued a yellow alert for most of the western departments on October 31. They were upgraded to a red alert by November 2. People in coastal towns were told to leave as supplies, including 88 tons of food, sleeping bags, hygiene kits, and plastic, were brought to Puerto Cabezas according to SINAPRED. The navy of Nicaragua helped more than 3,000 families from offshore islands to Puerto Cabezas as people in the city waited in long lines to access cash machines while getting supplies. Just before the storm's arrival, the army of Nicaragua moved red-helmeted troops to Puerto Cabezas to help in search and rescue efforts that would happen because of Eta. More than 10,000 people were at shelters in Puerto Cabezas and surrounding villages to wait out the storm. Honduras.

Costa Rica's National Meteorological Institute forecast lots of rainfall because of the outer bands of Eta, mostly along the Pacific coastline. With flooding starting at the night of November 2, the National Emergency Commission (NCE) put up multiple shelters for people leaving. The agency planned to set up three types of shelters due to the COVID-19 pandemic: infected people, people who might be infected, and non-infected persons. Landslides were expected in many areas due to wet soils. Panama. Although not in the path of Eta, the hurricane was expected to cause damage in Panama. Machines alerted to dangerous swells in Caribbean waters, along with wind gusts up to . The Ministry of Public Works told residents to stay alert for possible flooding and landslides. Road crews were sent to make sure highways remained clear for travel. Belize. As flooding was a major threat because of heavy rainfall, a flood warning was issued for all of Belize because of Eta, as the National Emergency Management Organization urged residents to evacuate. Caribbean. Cayman Islands. Once the Cayman Islands came close to the cone of Tropical Depression Eta on November 5, tropical storm watches were issued for Grand Cayman and all of the other islands. This came after Eta became forecast to become a tropical storm again before brushing by the islands. Government schools were closed in the islands on November 6 due to the threat of Eta. The next day, tropical storm warnings were put into effect for all of the islands. Cuba.

On November 6, tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys and parts of the coast of the Florida Peninsula. The next day, these were upgraded to tropical storm warnings in the Florida Keys and the southern tip of the peninsula. On November 7, Hurricane Watches and Warnings were issued for much of the Florida peninsula and both Tropical Storm Warnings and Watches were extended further north. Residents of small homes and other structures in the Florida Keys were told to evacuate ahead of Tropical Storm Eta as a state of emergency was declared in some counties including Monroe and Miami-Dade. Later, Hurricane Warnings were issued for the Florida Keys. All the warnings for Florida were cancelled by November 9, only to have more issued the next day along the western side of the state as Eta changed directions. Effects. Eta's intensity at the beginning of its lifetime followed by its odd path afterwards bought devastating impacts across Central America, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Florida with heavy rainfall, strong winds, and flash flooding causing most of the damage. South America. Colombia. Despite passing north of the archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, Eta still brought some damage to the island.
