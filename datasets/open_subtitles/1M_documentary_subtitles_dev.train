And first we go north to Preston in Lancashire and Mrs Betty Teal. Now, Mrs Teal, this is for £500, and this will stop us revealing the name of your lover in Bolton. So, Mrs Teal, £500 by tomorrow, please, and your husband Trevor and your lovely children Diane, Janice and little Juliette, who's having a difficult time at school at the moment, need never know the name of your lover in Bolton. What a hunk. Now, a politician, a freemason, an ex-guardsman and a prominent supporter of the English Folk Dance Movement. Well, he's been getting into a bit of a dance of his own. On last week's programme, he had the chance to pay up and hush it up, but he thought he knew better. Well, we've got news for him. He thinks he's at a crack addict's conference in Broadstairs. In fact, he's here backstage at our Blackmail studios. Bring him on! Hey! Sir Norman Barry Castle. <i>Welcome</i> to <i>Blackmail.</i> Well, you elected not to pay up, so here you are now in front of our studio audience of 15,000, our global audience of fifty million, paying the price of our right to know everything about you. Well, your career's in ruins, but the good thing is that your wife is gonna stand by you and she's here in the studio tonight. Is she with us? Can we see her there? Lovely, thank you. Thank you for coming along. Behind every strong man, there's a stronger woman. You bastard. Well, that's what they all say but he should have. - Kept it in his pants. - Kept it in his pants. Well, thank you, Sir Norman. Now it's telephone time, so bring on the golden phone. Last week, we showed you this photograph of three middle-aged car enthusiasts and asked them to send in £30,000 to stop us revealing the name of the two girls from the garage, the make of car in which they did it and the type of engine oil they used for lubrication. Well we've heard nothing from them, so it's time to. - Fill in the puzzle! - Fill in the puzzle! Let's see more. <i>OK boys, you're on Blackmail</i> and it's now £40,000 each. Well, they're either very brave or very rich. Let's see which it is. £400,000 now, unless we hear from James or Richard or. Hello, hello. Hello Jeremy, yeah, how are you? Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm sure you didn't, no, no, no. We don't morally censure, we just want the money. If your cheque's in the mail, you won't be in the Daily Mail. <i>Thanks for playing Blackmail.</i> Thanks. You too, Jezza. Lovely man. Deeply flawed. Now, what is it time for now, Veronica? I'm A Celebrity Or Am I? Your chance to play the game where we bring on a mystery contestant and you have to tell us whether you think he's a celebrity or a mere non-entity, so here he comes. Celebrity or non-entity? Let's start the clock. The famous legs, are those Simon Cowell's legs? Are these legs you recognise? Looks pretty ordinary to me. Could just be an ordinary guy off the street. Could be a celebrity. Five, four, three, two, one. Off with the bag. Oh my God! Wow! International man of mystery himself. This is a great moment but, Mike, Mike. We're both Mike so I can Mike. - Yes. - I can Mike with you. <i>- You're on Blackmail. - Yes.</i> What's gone wrong'? You mean, what's gone right? - Did I? - I'm on stage with you, sir. Well, we want you to confess, you know? Because <i>Blackmail,</i> we know you've been in trouble, so if there's anything you wanna share with the audience, now's your time. I wanna share how incredibly honoured I am to be on stage with Monty Python, the greatest comedy troupe in the history of the English language. And. And. There may be photographs of me with German Shepherds. - Oh wow. - Yeah. He's too nice a guy. Thank you for coming on the show, Mike. That's it? OK. Thank you and thank you all, girls, for Blackmail. See you next week! Good evening and welcome to another edition of Science Today, where we look at science today, and today we have with us Anne Elk, - Mrs Anne Elk. - Miss. - Miss Anne Elk. - Miss. Yes. Sorry. Miss Elk, you have a new theory about the brontosaurus. Can I just say at this point, Chris, that I have a new theory about the brontosaurus? Exactly. - What is it? - Where'? - Your new theory? - What is my theory? - Yes. - What is my theory that it is. Well, Chris, you may well ask me what is my theory. - I am asking what is your theory. - Well done, Chris. - Thank you. - Spot on. My word, yes. Well, Chris, what is it, that it is, this theory of mine? Well, this is what it is. My theory, which belongs to me and which I own, is mine. Yes, I know it's yours, but what is it? - Where? - Your theory. - What is my theory? - Yes. This is it. Here is my theory and what it is too. "My theory, by Anne Elk, "brackets, Miss, brackets." The next thing that I will say will be my theory. Here it comes. You ready, Chris? Yes. My theory begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end and then much thicker in the middle and then thin at the far end again. That is my theory and what it is, and it belongs to me too and it's mine. - That's it, is it? - Spot on, Chris. Well, this theory of yours certainly seems to have hit the nail on the head. Thank you, Chris, thank you. - Next week sees the opening. - Thank you very much. -.of a new wasp. - Thank you. And thank you for asking me to the studio. You're very welcome. Next week sees the opening of a of a new wasp farm near Redditch that is going to. Next week sees the opening. I have another theory. Really? Called, "My Second Theory" or "Miss Anne Elk, "bracket, Miss, second theory, number two." - Would you like to hear it'? - Yes, all right. My second theory states that dentists can make your teeth dance. - Really? - Look. <i>Yes, mothers, it's time once again for Conrad Poohs and his dancing teeth.</i> Come in. Trouble at mill. Oh no. What sort of trouble? One of crossbeam's gone out of skew on treadle. Pardon? One of crossbeam's gone out of skew on treadle. I don't understand what you're saying. One of the crossbeams has gone out of askew on the treadle. - Well, what on earth does that mean? - Well, I don't know. Mr Wentworth just told me to come in here and say there was trouble at mill, that's all. I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition. Our chief weapon is surprise, surprise and fear. Fear as well. Our two weapons are fear and surprise and ruthless. Our three weapons are fear and surprise and ruthless efficiency and an almost fanatical devotion to. Four, our four. The.the. I'll come in again. I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition. Amongst our weaponry, our five diverse elements, are fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope and nice red uniforms. No, I can't do this, I can't say this. You'll have to say it. - What? - The bit about our chief weapons. I couldn't do that. Nobody. Expects. Nobody expects the Spanish. -inquisition. - I know, I know. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition. - In fact, those. - Our chief weapons are. - Our chief weapons are. - Surprise. - Surprise and. - Stop. Stop there, stop there. Good. Surprise, fear, ruthless efficiency, fanatical devotion to the Pope. - Cardinal Fang. - Yes, love? Read the charges. 14 ducats for a complete massage on. No, no, no, the charges against her. You have hereby been charged that you did on diverse dates commit heresy against the Holy Church by word, thought and deed. With full relief, <i>22</i> ducats. Yeah, no, that's enough, that's enough. So.how do you plead? Innocent. - Innocent! - Very well. Cardinal Biggles. Fetch the rack. Tie her to the rack. So. How do you plead? Innocent. Cardinal.give the rack a turn. - I. - I know, I know you can't, I didn't want to say anything, I just wanted to ignore your crass mistake. - I. - It makes it all seem so stupid. - Shall I. - Just pretend, pretend for God's sake. So, old woman, you are accused of heresy on three counts. Heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deed and heresy by action. Four, four, four counts. Do you. Confess? I don't understand what I'm accused of. Then we shall make you understand. Cardinal, take her.to the comfy chair. So you think you can survive the rack. You will not survive the comfy chair. So.old woman, you have one last chance. Confess the heinous sin of heresy, reject the works of the ungodly. Two, two last chances, and you shall be.three, three last chances. Confess. - Confess. Confess. Confess. Confess. - Confess. Confess. Confess. Confess. I confess! No, not you. I have one last weapon in my armoury. If you do not talk. - I will show you.the fridge. - Not the fridge! Cardinal, go to the fridge and get her. A large glass of.cold milk. Whenever life gets you down, Mrs Brown. and things seem hard or tough And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft And you feel that you've had quite enough Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving and revolving at 900 miles an hour That's orbiting at 19 miles a second so it's reckoned The sun that is the source of all our power The sun and you and me and all the <i>stars</i> that we can see are moving at a million miles a day In an outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour of the galaxy we call the Milky Way Our galaxy itself contains 500 billion stars It's a hundred thousand light years side to side It bulges in the middle, six thousand light years thick but out by us it's just a thousand light years wide We're 40,000 light years from Galactic Central Point we go round every 200 million years And our galaxy is only one of millions and billions in this amazing and expanding universe The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding In all of the directions it can whizz As fast as it can go at the speed of light you know 12 million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure How amazingly unlikely is your birth And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space 'Cause there's bugger all down here on earth Now there are many reasons why I find that song scientifically inaccurate. It's pathetic really. The statement that the sun is the source of all our power. Well, take geothermal energy. That comes from the heat of the earth's core. That's generated, at least in part, by the radioactive decay of uranium. Uranium was formed in supernova explosions. Then the statement that the earth orbits at 19 miles a second. Well that'd be OK if the earth's orbit was circular, but in fact it's elliptical, so it's better to say that the earth sweeps out equal areas in equal times. Kepler knew that back in 1609. Then the statement that space time expands at the speed of light. Well, there was a period of expansion, exponential expansion between 1 O to the minus 36 and 10 to the minus 32 seconds after the Big Bang called inflation, in which the I think you are being pedantic. Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving and revolving at 900 miles an hour That's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned The sun that is the source of all our power The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see Are moving at a million miles a day In an outer spiral arm at 400,000 miles an hour In a galaxy we call the Milky Way Work, work, money, money Work, work, money, money Work, work, funny money Funny money, work, work Work, work, hurry, hurry Work, work, worry, worry Work, work, hurry, hurry Worry hurry, work, work Morning, morning, morning Morning Jill, morning Jack Can't complain, keep coming back Morning, morning, morning Morning Jim, morning Fred Work all day until you're dead Money is the root of evil Money is the fruit of sin Money is the root of everything Wear a suit, they'll let you in Morning, morning, morning What's the point and what's the use Work until you reproduce Boring, boring, boring Work all day, earn your bread Till you finally drop down dead Money is the root of evil Money is the fruit of sin Money, money, money can drive you mad End up in the loony bin Work, work, money, money Work, work, money, money Work, work, funny money Funny money, work, work Work, work, hurry, hurry Work, work, worry, worry Work, work, hurry, hurry Worry hurry, work, work Money is the root of evil Money is the fruit of sin Money is the root of everything Pay up or we'll do you in Work hard every single day Work, work, work your life away Don't question what, Don't question why Just keep working till you die Money is the root of evil Money is the fruit of sin Money is the root of everything The Grim Reaper's coming in Life is a silly walk in the park A knife in your throat held after dark Life is a terrible joke, a lark A spoken word then it all goes dark Money is the root of evil Money is the fruit of sin Funny money loot will make you rich Life's a bitch and you can't win Money is the root of evil Never, never question why Money is the fruit of evil Work all day until you die Hello. Good afternoon sir, have you come for an argument? Or would you like a blowjob? Pardon? You've come for an argument. - What was the other option? - Nothing. Nothing. It's just a special offer. So have you been here before? No this is my first time. I see. Well would you like to have just one argument? Or were you thinking of taking a course? Well what is the cost? It's £1 for a five minute argument, but only £8 for a course of ten. Well I think I'll take the five minutes and see how it goes from there. Fine. Let's see. Yes, try Mr Barnard. Thank you. Thank you. Such nice people. - What do you want? - Well I. I. And don't give me that, you snotty-faced heap of parrot droppings. Shut your festering gob, you tit. Your type makes me puke. You vacuous stuffy malodorous old pervert. Look, I came here for an argument. I'm sorry, this is abuse. - You want next door. - I see. Thank you. Not at all. Stupid dick! Hello. Is this the right room for an argument? I've told you once. - No, you haven't. - Yes, I have. - When? - Just now. - No, you didn't. You didn't. - Yes, I did. I'm sorry. Is this the five minute argument or the full half hour? - Just the five minutes. - Just the five minutes. Thank you very much. Anyway I did. You most certainly did not. Now let's get one thing absolutely clear. I most definitely told you. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - No you didn't. - Yes I did. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. No, you didn't. Look, this isn't an argument. - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't. - Just contradiction. - No, it isn't. - You contradicted me just then. You did. - I did not. Never. No, no, no, no, no. This is futile. - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - I came here for a good argument. - No, you didn't. You came here for an argument. - But an argument isn't just contradiction. - Yes, it is. No, it isn't. An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition. Look if I argue with you, I must take up a contrary position. - Yes but that's not just saying "No, it isn't." - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - No it isn't, no it isn't, no it isn't, no it isn't. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes it is. Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person <i>says.</i> - It is not. - It is. - Not at all. - Now look I. Thank you, good morning. What? What? That's it. The five minutes is up. That was never five minutes just now. - I'm afraid it was. - No, it wasn't. I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to argue any more. This is ridiculous. If you want me to go on arguing you'll have to pay for another five minutes. But that was never five minutes just now. This is ridiculous. There you are. - Thank you very much. Very good. - Well? What? That was never five minutes just now. I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you pay. - I just paid. - No, you didn't. - I did. I did. I did. I did. - You did not. You did not. Look I don't want to argue about that. Well, I'm very sorry but you didn't pay. If I didn't pay, why are you arguing? Got you. - No, you haven't. - Yes, I have. - If you're arguing I must have paid. - Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time. I've got two legs, From my hips to the ground And when I move them They walk around And when I lift 'em They climb the stairs And whoo! When I shave 'em They ain't got hairs! I've got two legs with my feet. - Good morning. - Morning. What have you got then? Well there's egg and Spam, egg, bacon and Spam. Egg, bacon, sausage and Spam. Spam, bacon, sausage and Spam. Spam egg. Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam. Spam, Spam, Spam, egg and Spam. Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, baked beans, Spam, Spam, and Spam. Or lobster thermidor aux crevettes with a mornay sauce garnished with truffle paté, brandy and a fried egg on top, and Spam. Have you got anything without Spam in it? Well there's Spam, egg, sausage and Spam. That's not got much Spam in it. I don't want any Spam. Why can't she have egg, bacon, Spam and sausage? That's got Spam in it. Yeah, but not <i>as</i> much as Spam, egg, bacon, Spam and sausage. Look. Can I just have egg, bacon, Spam and sausage, without the Spam? What do you mean. You can't have egg, bacon, Spam and sausage without the Spam. Why not? Well it wouldn't be egg, bacon, Spam and sausage, would it? I don't like Spam. Don't make a fuss, dear. I'll have your Spam, I love it. I'm having Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, baked beans, Spam and Spam. Baked beans are off. Well can I have Spam instead? You mean Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam. Spam! Spam! Spam! Spam! Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam! Spam! Spam! Spam! Spam! Shut up! Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam! Shut up! Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam! Shut up! Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam! Shut up! Bloody Vikings! Racist bastard. Finland, Finland, Finland The country where I quite want to be Pony trekking or camping Or just watching TV Finland, Finland, Finland That's the country for me Spam! Spam! Spam! Spam! Oh, Spam Lovely Spam! Oh, lovely Spam! Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam! Lovely spam! Wonderful spam! Lovely spam! Wonderful spam. Lovely Spam! Spam! Spam! Spam! I wish to register a complaint. Hello, miss. What do you mean, miss? Oh, I'm sorry, I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint. Sorry we're closed for lunch. Never mind that. I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique. Oh, yes, the Norwegian Blue? What's wrong with it? I tell you what's wrong with it. It's dead! That's what's wrong with it. No, no. He's resting. Look my lad, I know a dead parrot when I see one. And I'm looking at one right now. No, no, he's resting. Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, isn't it? Beautiful plumage. The plumage don't enter into it. He's stone dead. No, no. He's resting. All right then, if he's resting, I'll wake him up. Hello, Mr Polly Parrot, I've got a lovely fresh. There, he moved. No, he didn't, that was you hitting the cage. I never. Hello, Polly! This is your 9:00 o'clock alarm call. Wakey! Wakey! Where were we? You say. "And now that's what I call a dead parrot." Now that's what I call a dead parrot! No, no. "No, no" I say. It's stunned! Stunned? Yeah, stunned! You stunned it just <i>as</i> it was waking up, Norwegian Blues stun easily. Listen, my lad, I've. I've had enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased. And when I purchased it, not half an hour ago, you assured me that its total lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out following a prolonged squawk. Well, he's probably pining for the fjords. Pining for the fjords'? What kind of talk is that? Look, why did he fall flat on his back the moment I got him home? The Norwegian Blue prefers kipping on his back. Remarkable bird, isn't it? Beautiful plumage. Look matey, I took the liberty of examining that bird when I got it home and I discovered the only reason it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there. Well, of course it were nailed there! If I hadn't nailed that bird down, it would have muscled up to those bars, ripped them apart with its immensely strong beak. and voom. - Voom? - Voom. Matey, this parrot wouldn't voom if you put 40,000 volts through it. It's bleeding demised! No. No, no, he's. He's pining. He's not pining! He's passed on. This parrot is no more. He has ceased to be. He has expired and gone to meet Doctor Chapman. This. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff, bereft of life. It rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies. It's run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. It has breathed its last. Its metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to Victorians. He has. He has kicked the bucket. This is an ex-parrot. Well I'd better replace it, then. I was listening to the wireless this morning. Very interesting, apparently, the editor of the Daily Mail, Mr Paul Dacre has just received an arsehole transplant. Yeah. I heard that. I heard that too. The arsehole rejected him, I hear. - Oh really? - Yeah. I've been round the back, I've had a look. we're right out of parrots. I see, I see, I get the picture. But. I have got a selection of cheeses. Amazingly enough. A selection of cheeses? - Yeah. - Really? What you have got? You name it, I've got it. Brie? No. - Camembert? - No. - Bresse bleu? - No. Stilton? No. - Lancashire cheese? - No - Red Leicester? - No. - Double Gloucester? - No. Stinking Bishop? Don't you call me names. It's the name of a well-known West Country cheese, you should know that, you run a pet shop. Caerphilly? No. You don't have any Caerphilly? No. - Wensleydale? - Yeah. Well, I'll have a pound of Wensleydale cheese, please. Oh, sorry, I thought you were talking to me. That's my name, Arthur Wensleydale. - Gruyére? - No. - Emmental? - No - Jarlsberg? - No. Armenian String Cheese with cumin seeds? Not much call for it round here, squire. Zimbabwean rhinoceros milk cheese? Cat's eaten it. - Tell you what. - What? You haven't asked me about Cheddar. - Cheddar? - Yeah, Cheddar. You know. Is it worth it? - Could be. - All right, I'm game. Do you have. Honestly expecting the answer "No," any Cheddar? No. Do you want to come back to my place? I thought he'd never ask. Oh, isn't he a lovely little. Oh, isn't he a lovely little. Oh, isn't he a lovely little. Wait a minute, buckaroos, this has gone far enough. No, no, no. Get it away. Get it away. Get it away.

Always look on the bright side of life Always look on the bright side of life Carol! Hey Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Okay. - Okay. - Let's do it. If we go down to this. either end, see, you can get it. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. - Like this, right? - Yeah, that's good. - So we're talking to you? - Yeah. Okay. <font color="#3A9583">Sync by YYeTs</font> <font color="#3399FF">Corrections by Mlmlte</font> <font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font> <i>We have an amazing show tonight.</i> <i>Oh, my God.</i> <i>The creators of the legendary animated series South Park,</i> <i>Matt Stone and Trey Parker!</i> <i>South Park's never been Matt and I sitting there going,</i> <i>"Okay, what's offensive?</i> <i>What can we do that's offensive?"</i> Oh, "herro" "prease." <i>We just are sort of offensive people, so.</i> Red rocket. Come on, dog. Red rocket. <i>You watch all four days of the Democratic convention.</i> On Wednesday night, I had to watch South Park, so. Oh, this is hot scissoring. Scissor me timbers. All right, I'd like to solve the puzzle. Niggers! All the bad in society, it's our fault. You can blame us. Now how about we do some scripture readings from <i>The Book of Mormon</i>? They have a new musical opening on Broadway that is getting rave reviews. It's called <i>The Book of Mormon</i>. Been here in New York for 2 1/2 months. <i>This is opening night in about, what, an hour?</i> <i>South Park seems like a million miles away.</i> But we start into South Park in two weeks. We're really stupid. <i>This was the longest break we've ever had in between runs.</i> <i>It's been quiet here for the last few months.</i> <i>It won't be any longer here shortly.</i> Well. <i>Knowing we have seven shows coming up</i> and we don't have any ideas for them yet. That's typical, but to go back to South Park <i>is gonna be really hard.</i> There's this documentary being made on South Park, so that starts shooting now. Let's go to the bathroom, boys. Bathroom cam. Oh, I probably should, actually. I'll have. Want to get that little mini detail for 75? - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. Just give me the keys. I'll just give 'em to you. What's your name? - Trey. Trey, I'll take care of you, what time you leaving today? - 5 in the morning, probably. - Okay. It is kind of our mission every morning to go in and come up with ideas and jokes. Writers' room is off-limits. I will only bother the writers' room if there's something that has got to be dealt with or answered right on the spot. Man, we got to do seven episodes. <i>We never had cameras in the writers' room.</i> <i>Yeah, I mean, it's a really. It's kind of a safe place.</i> For all the good ideas that we get, there's, like, 100 not-so-good ones. The Japanese Tsunami, which isn't funny at all,but there is, like. <i>every. a couple days, it's like,</i> a new video comes out, 'cause so many people were <i>everyone has a video phone.</i> <i>It. you just. it looks.</i> <i>Oh, it's terrifying.</i> Anyway, so Tsunami video? Tsunami show? <i>- Not super funny. - Real funny.</i> And you got to feel safe to just go, "What about this?" And it's like, people go, "well." You go, "okay, you know, I don't take any offense. You didn't like my idea." And you got to feel like. it is kind of. It's weirdly vulnerable. I've had friends that worked at other shows, and if you say something that doesn't work, they're like, "ah, that sucks. You suck. You're not funny." And these guys, it's actually a very kind room, and I think, like, the worst you get is, "okay." The way that they work is definitely, like, having fun, laughing, chasing that, and never making it, like, a grind. It seems like movie trailers make you feel stupid these days. "Hello, you. "Kevin James is a Zookeeper. Go see it, asshole." That trailer. Ugh. Talking monkey? In a m-m-movie? It's gonna help me g-g-get laid? Kevin James is a Zookeeper. Fuck you. He's about to get married. Fuck you. I'm a squirrel. I can't talk. Fuck you. Pirates of the Caribbean forty fucking eight. Fuck you. <i>You'll notice that a lot of the people that work here,</i> <i>they'll be going, walking by back and forth,</i> and they're always kind of. 'Cause they know, the more we're laughing in there, the less hours they probably have to work in here. They walk by, there's no laughing, and Trey's doing this and I'm pulling out my hair. And it's 3:00 in the afternoon, and we should be done. You know what's getting a lot of traction in the last, like, maybe six months is how fucked up the NCAA is and how fucked up it is that players don't get paid. They're playing on ABC on Sunday in front of, like, 20 million people, and they can't afford to fly their mom to the game. You look in the crowd, and everybody's white. All the athletic directors, everybody's white. All the players are black. Or most of them are, you know, 90% of them are black. <i>And you're like, "dude, you're selling their image,</i> <i>like, on video.</i> <i>You're signing video game deals."</i> <i>When I first met him, we had just seen</i> Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. Matt, like, really hated it, and he was kind of going off about it, and he was like, "it was like a rape." He just kept saying, like, "the movie was like a rape." And then. and while he's saying this, like, Trey's just kind of, like, pacing around, and then Trey just goes, "okay so the boys are coming out of kingdom". And then it was just. it just started. it became. I was like, "Oh, my God. This is becoming an episode." <i>Why are they doing this?</i> They're just taking Indiana Jones, and they're. They're raping him! I can't watch! Let's get out of here, Kyle. Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this? Come on! Let's go! Why are they doing this? Just run! So then what if Cartman starts a lucrative business of getting crack babies to play basketball? And he videotapes these crack babies. It becomes really big, but he doesn't pay the crack babies anything. <i>Stan's mom volunteers at the hospital</i> <i>where she holds crack babies.</i> Then Cartman sees a really great investment opportunity. "The most successful businesses in America "don't pay their labor. - Don't you understand, Kyle?" - "It's slave labor." "I see; You're gonna represent the crack babies against me." <i>"How much money are they paying you, Kyle?"</i> "No, I'm doing it pro Bono." "What? "You're doing it just to get a fucking boner? "You know, it'd be fine. if you were doing it for money, "I'd understand, but just to get a boner, Kyle? Jesus Christ." Just to get a boner. <i>There's on a show on this Wednesday.</i> We don't even know what it is, and, like, even though that's the way we've always done it, there's this little thing going, "Oh, you're screwed. You're screwed." And then I tried to get a diversion and play a little Xbox last night, and a big ad for South Park came up on the Xbox. You know, "Starting Wednesday." And I was just like, "Oh, shit. Just can't get away from it." Let's do this. Let's go till 11:30 trying to come up with something completely new. Then from 11:30 to 12:30, we'll pick which of these shows we're gonna do, and we'll come up with a scene for that, and then we'll be done. <i>A whole another show.</i> <i>Last night, I went onto iTunes,</i> and that thing came up again that's like, "your iTunes is out of date," you know, which happens every time. "God damn it. Here it goes again. I got to download another version of iTunes." <i>How many times have I hit "agree" to that,</i> and I've never even read one line of it? It's like, "Kyle's in trouble. We got to help." He's like, " Fuck Kyle. I don't care." It's like, "dude, he agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions." Like, "Oh, my God. Get him inside." The joke is that everyone always reads that except for Kyle. <i>Even Butters is sitting with him.</i> "Whoa, you.Well, how can you agree to something "you didn't read, Kyle? Never, ever, ever click something without reading it." "I said 'disagree.'" because then Stan even showing up at Cartman's house going, "we got to hide Stan." And then Cartman's like, "why?" And it's like, "he agreed to the fucking iTunes terms and conditions." - "God damn it." - "Did he read it?" I happened to be downloading the new version of iTunes for the 400th time, and it was like, clicking on that "agree" thing. I'm like, "oh, you know, I wonder if there's anything really messed-up in here that I'm agreeing to." <i>Then we had this parody of Human Centipede</i> <i>that went into it.</i> <i>And then you start to. "Oh, wait,</i> <i>this is actually starting to be something."</i> Just draw a little Kyle hat on that second one. There's just Kyle in the middle just getting fucked. Let's just do a profile shot first, just sort of what it really looks like in <i>Human Centipede</i>. Let's see that as the side shot, and then let's also see it basically, like, Japanese guy head-on with Kyle kind of peeking out back here and then her back here, if we decide we're gonna go that route, we'll probably build a walk cycle for it. You know, sort of. <i>So I got them corel'ing the real version.</i> Whenever Cartman comes in, just. It doesn't matter what's going on in the story. He just has to have brought the front guy a huge cappuccino <i>with six extra shots.</i> He just brings him a huge coffee. I've learned that men really super.They dig poo. It's like, the goes in here, out the fucking ass into this mouth. In this fucking ass, up this mouth, up into a cloud. Down in the mouth, out the fucking ass of this person. "Just upload all your stuff to the cloud and then down into your fucking asshole." "Go to shit to his mouth and to his ass." The Japanese man could have to talk for the whole centipede, you know? It's like, "What do you want to do, Kyle?" "He said he want to", you know? "Just whisper into my asshole." <i>You know, generally, like, it's a good idea</i> <i>if everyone in the room is laughing</i> <i>and then Anne Garefino is kind of looking</i> a little bit like, "hmm, really? We're doing that?" And we're like, "Oh, yeah, Anne. We're gonna do that." When they shit into each other's mouths, we're not gonna see feces in the iteration that I have seen so far, but I don't know what's gonna happen at the end yet. We haven't written the end. Maybe. Yes. Maybe we see them being sewn together. Thanks. Happy Easter to you too. Oh, I like these pastels. "More violent on the shake." <i>Just got to match Kyle's head to the butt.</i> And then I got to do the same thing to his butt and her head. In this building, you not only have to be good and diverse, but you also have to be fast, 'cause if it takes you four days to get something done, <i>you can't really contribute.</i> When push comes to shove and we're in production, people just have to be able to turn stuff around. <i>Most studios have a storyboard department,</i> and all they do is storyboard. Then you'll have a character design department, and all they do is character design, and then they'll have a background design department, <i>and they'll all get a couple of days or three days or so</i> <i>to at least do their job.</i> <i>Everybody in here does all that,</i> <i>and in 1/10 of the time of a normal studio.</i> Usually, <i>Simpsons</i> and <i>Family Guy</i>, those shows take, like eight to ten months, and we're doing it, you know, six days. <i>No one does an animated show like this.</i> On Thursday, we get one scene. We jam it through the storyboard departments. <i>We get the boards drawn.</i> <i>We get editorial to build that initial animatic.</i> <i>The guys will go in and record that scene.</i> <i>Trey's the quarterback.</i> <i>We're kind of like the offensive line.</i> If Trey all of a sudden wants to do an homage to <i>Heavy Metal</i>, <i>the animated movie.</i> Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds. Okay. <i>We have to figure out how to do that.</i> If he wants to do guys bouncing on their nut sack. I'm stoned off my balls. It's our job to figure out how it works. <i>But it all starts and ends with Trey and Matt.</i> So sorry, Kyle, but I am starving. Which would you rather I eat? Should I eat cuttlefish and asparagus or the vanilla paste? Cuttlefish and asparagus? Very well. I will eat the cuttlefish. - You gonna do eating sounds? -<i> Oh, yeah.</i> That cuttlefish and. It's so funny. It's so stupid. That cuttlefish and asparagus is not sitting well. Oh, no! Cuttlefish. Cuttlefish is about to come out of my asshole! Oh, here it comes. Oh, it's going to be a lot. Hold on, Kyle. I believe in you! It's just so funny that Matt and I are in our 40s now, and we're still. Like, when that Japanese guy shits in Kyle's mouth and Kyle shits in the lady's mouth, it makes us laugh so goddamn hard, and I know it doesn't. There's, like, a lot of people out there that don't laugh at that shit as hard as we do. But it's just so satisfying for me, especially after going from <i>Book of Mormon</i> and all the. You know, the Broadway and the accolades and all this, like. you know, and it was great. I'm super proud of that, but it's just so funny to come back here and just do a Japanese guy shitting in Kyle's mouth, 'cause it just. it's just back to our roots, you know? Hold on, Kyle! I believe in you! Yeah, just keep him kind of moving and shaking. So he's like, "Oh, God. It's gonna be a lot. Here it comes! Hold on, Kyle! I believe in you!" <i>Even though we're a partnership.</i> And I really do feel that way, that we each bring kind of, like, something different to the table, and it's why it's made us survive and stuff. <i>The way that the stories,</i> <i>either in South Park or the movies,</i> are expressed is completely through Trey. Like, Trey's the chef. Hey, you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one. I thought your family was rich! Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. Flatter on the. "Tom Saltzman says "you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it." - <i>So keep that, okay.</i> - Yeah. Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. Yeah, that's a good one. When we first started getting famous and stuff, "Oh, yeah, Matt and Trey, and Trey's the director. "Well, Matt". And I got calls for, like. "Hey, you can". I mean, I got offers to direct studio comedies, the crap shit that I probably didn't want to do anyway, but, you know, in my head, I was just like, "you really don't know what you're doing." Like, don't you know what I mean? Like, yeah, maybe I could go fool people for a little bit, and maybe I might get lucky here or there with a scene or two, or I might pull off a little bit, but it's not in my DNA. <i>I don't have that competing skill set,</i> <i>so whatever I've got channels through him.</i> Like, it's just like any time that you get a band, you can sit there and be like, "okay, well, it's all Eddie Van Halen." But as soon as David Lee Roth leaves, you're like, "fuck that band." You know what I mean? And it's like.You know, and Eddie can sit there and say, "well, I write everything," and it's like, "yeah, but you're not Van Halen without David Lee Roth." <i>Bring in Matt.</i> <i>Where I can get in and be tough</i> <i>is exactly where Trey's not,</i> and where he can be tough is exactly where I'm not. That's helped us in the business of the whole thing too. Are we talking to each other? - You can talk to each other. - That'd be really weird. You know, you won't get in an argument with Trey. <i>Trey's not gonna argue with you about something,</i> and I'll argue about your everything all the time. Yeah, it's not gonna feel right. I'll tell you. Us talking to each other is not. We don't talk to each other like that. You know what I mean? <i>I'm not trying to throw a wrench in your thing.</i> If you want us to look in the camera and answer questions, we can do that. So this is the camera? Which one's the camera? - The middle. - The middle one. Okay. Trey and Matt's the band, <i>and no matter who does what or whatever, that's the band.</i> We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to. The.There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle. Oh, nope. Here it is right here. "By clicking 'agree,' you're also acknowledging that Apple "may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user." Really broke. They broke at a bar, and so I did this little thing with a paper clip, and see how it's all swirly? People think it's a fashion statement. <i>I was renting a studio apartment,</i> and I had a little futon on the floor, and Matt slept. Would kind of get all his dirty clothes together at the end of the day and sleep on those. Any money we had was to live or get our own thing going. <i>We created this thing called</i> The Spirit of Christmas<i> on VHS</i>. <i>People started copying and copying,</i> <i>and that became this, like, viral video,</i> <i>but before the Internet.</i> It's crazy now to look back at <i>Spirit of Christmas</i>. You're like, "what the fuck is that piece of shit?" - It's crazy. - So shitty. Tomorrow is my birthday, yet all is not right. Your birthday is on Christmas? That sucks, dude. I must find a place called "The Mall." Well, we can take you to the mall, Jesus. Yeah, it's over this way. We'd have people call us and say, "dude, you got to see this thing. I'm gonna send you this thing." And we're like, "that's ours." And then we had people. 'Cause we didn't put our names on it. That was another thing that drove people nuts. We found out people were getting jobs saying that they did it. Dudes were getting directing jobs, commercial jobs, and we just, like, had no job. They're like, "we got the guys that made <i>Spirit of Christmas</i>." And we're like, "we made fucking <i>Spirit of Christmas</i>." They're like, "yeah, yeah." <i>We pitched it to FOX, and we actually made</i> <i>these big things with construction paper on 'em,</i> and I was so proud of it. It was like a school project. The woman at fox at the time was like, "yeah, no. "You know, what people want to see in animation is, "they don't want to see kids. They want to see families." And we're like, "well, we can get into the family. "You know, we've got. Each boy could have their family, and that's". And she was like, "no, yeah, it's just not gonna work." We went to Comedy Central with it. <i>Music from Primus opens South Park, and from there,</i> <i>four eight-year-old boys</i> <i>and other crudely drawn characters will rock your world.</i> Oh, my God! They killed Kenny! You bastard! The highest-rated television show on cable for more than a month. You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! South Park on Comedy Central, <i>an instant cult hit and cultural icon.</i> Screw you guys. I'm going home. Good, you deserve to die, you little bastard! Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your genius. <i>This is all for the pilot.</i> So they'd put this mouth on, and then they'd shoot, you know, two frames of film, and then they would take that mouth off, <i>and then, like, they would dab it like that.</i> That's how sometimes they'd get coffee on the teeth. <i>It took the guys two to three hours to do one shot,</i> <i>and it took pretty much all summer to do the pilot.</i> No, kitty. This is my pot pie. No, kitty. You bad kitty. No, kitty, it's my pot pie! Mom! <i>This is where Cartman gets the anal probe,</i> <i>and it's when that bright blue light comes in.</i> <i>You know, he's laying in his bed right here.</i> <i>It's mostly Trey's style from high school and drawing.</i> The style comes from his passion of Monty Python and the style that Terry Gilliam did in Monty Python. You know, it was still animated, but you didn't have to draw every frame. <i>He'd just draw our characters, and some of the comedy</i> <i>comes from the crudeness of the animation.</i> Wow, this is great. <i>Boy, those look shitty.</i> Like, this is our original panning shot for the cafeteria. Yeah, so the frame would be like that, you know, so we'd pull the camera way in. <i>Depending on what was taped down</i> <i>and what wasn't taped down on the animation side of it,</i> that would bring these characters to life. Like, 'cause as you're, you know, changing the mouths or putting on different eyes, your character would have a slightly different bump and a little jiggle to it. It's still stop-motion animation. It's still someone moving Cartman over and going, "key frame." <i>It's still just frame by frame</i> <i>and a bunch of really talented people looking at every piece</i> <i>of visual art and doing it really fast.</i> Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? So instead of coming from back here, start him here, side view. And he's like, "Kyle, what should I do next?" And he's still doing his thing. <i>"Kyle, wow, what should I do next?</i> <i>"Oh, man. Should I email some friends?</i> <i>Or maybe I should buy some apps."</i> <i>Then turns and then goes this way.</i> So he'll have a little bit of front view where he's like. "Oh, wow. This is totally awesome." Tap, tap, tap. <i>There a season where you made the decision, like,</i> <i>"we're gonna start turning it over in a week?"</i> No, it just started happening where we would do it in two weeks. And then we would do it in. "Oh, my God. "We just did a show in ten days. I can't believe. that was crazy." And then it was like, "oh, my God, seven days." And then it was like, "oh, my God, we just did it." And then it just turned into, like, we just do a show a week, and it just kind of got there. <i>Technology got to the place so we could do that too.</i> <i>15 years ago, we were using $30,000 desktop boxes</i> <i>that were really specialized,</i> <i>and even they were, like, creeping slow compared to now.</i> <i>We just have Macs off the shelf.</i> <i>So basically,</i> <i>the show can keep up with as fast as we can go.</i> <i>Time to kick off the road to the 2011 Tony Awards,</i> <i>Broadway's biggest and brightest night.</i> The Book of Mormon<i> leads all shows this year</i> <i>with 14 nominations.</i> - So happy for you, Trey. - Yeah, it's good. - Congratulations. - It's good. Celebrate by working all day. Yay, fun. <i>I was thinking the chick on the back could be Lady Gaga,</i> <i>'cause then you could put her in, like, a sweet costume.</i> She's the one to agreed to it on purpose, 'cause this is her new. It's her new lipstick. Kirstie Alley. That's pretty funny, right? We're gonna make it an actress, right? Yeah, I was thinking of making it some actress, like. They've said " fuck you" to every celebrity pretty much, which they were doing before the show too. They would fart on celebrities at parties, and now they do it on the air, and the celebrity smells it. Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, all right? You need to come out. What's going on? Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet. Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall. You know, at SNL, it's like, "well, we might want that person to host. Do we want to pick on that person?" Or, "that person is already mad at us because of". You know what I mean? There's all political reasons. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch. <i>All right, I'm nearing her snizz now.</i> What they want to do in being funny is just, like, that's it, you know. Like, that's the priority. That's like.They don't worry about anything else. Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them. <i>Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer</i> <i>and taken several people hostage.</i> Ms. Lopez, we're dropping you from the label. Oh, no, you didn't. Mostly, it's just 'cause that's their personalities, to be like, "fuck everybody," 360 degrees. <i>Trey got nominated for</i> Blame Canada, and so I think I went as your date, right? So it was like, "well, you can go with Trey's as a plus one," and he didn't have a girlfriend at the time, and he was like, "you can go as my date." And I was like, "oh, that's funny." So then it was like, "well, wouldn't it be funny "if I shaved my legs and dressed up in a fancy dress "and tried to pass myself off as some weird-looking, "tall, European. Eastern European model or something?" We talked about, like, big duck outfits, and we're like, "well, if we go in "with big duck costumes, they're not gonna. "Then they have a reason to not let us in, "but if we're wearing what other people are wearing, then they really can't say, 'you can't come in.'" friend of ours had sugar cubes with LSD. That's so crazy now to think, like. That's so nuts. The whole idea.I mean, even to just go, "okay, you're gonna go to the Oscars. Take acid and go to the Oscars." I'd be like, "no, dude, I'm not doing that, 'cause I don't know what I'm gonna end up doing." That'd even be too scary. <i>They have all these streets blocked off,</i> <i>'cause you have to go through the biggest limo line</i> <i>in the world to get dropped off.</i> And it was like, we finally got up to the front, and we were both, I think, going, "oh, shit." <i>If you've taken acid,</i> you know that one of the trippiest parts of when you're on any psychedelics is transitioning, when you go inside to outside or outside to inside. You know, like, that, "oh, we're in a different space." I will never forget the moment getting out of the limo, and there was, like, 60,000 fucking people and every camera in the Western Hemisphere there, and it was like, "let's go!" Right now, we're gonna go downstairs to. Kind of simple and kind of elegant? - I don't know. - Doubt it. <i>Tell us.</i> Okay, talk about a fashion statement. Now, two of you are nominated for best song, <i>Blame Canada</i>. - Matt's not. - I'm not. We said, "we can't say anything about them." - Nothing about the dresses. - No matter what they ask us. So everyone would go, "guys, what about the dresses? Why the dresses?" And we'd go, "magical night tonight. Just all the stars are out." Is that why you're in the dress? It's just such a magical evening, and everyone. It's just, everyone looks so spectacular. You know, we just wanted to be a part of it all. It's a night of magic. Come on. Only thing we could have done a little bit better is, we could have put powdered sugar all over our noses. Just to have been totally like, "fuck you." I also remember, actually, then having to sit there in the actual Oscars, and you're coming down off the acid. So you're simultaneously coming down, and you're having to now sit through the Oscars, which suck. <i>There were people there that were like,</i> <i>"dude, this is my big night.</i> fuck you." That was the funniest thing to us. We're like, "really? "Like, this is fucking bullshit. It's Hollywood. Like, let's rock, you know?" But we don't have any friends anymore. I wonder why. <i>I think that maybe now what we should do</i> <i>is fill in all of the blanks</i> we need.We have to fill in. We are in danger of doing our typical first show thing where we've just got way too many ingredients. We haven't introduced the idea of apps at all or anything, and that's why whatever this thing is at the end is gonna have to be so fast. I'm just worried about time. You know what I mean? And not one of our whole other ideas, but, like, one of the other character's storylines. We just feel like the Cartman being pissed off about not getting his thing. Like, him going home and screaming at his mom, saying, "you fuck me, 'cause now all the kids think I have an iPad, and I've got to show up tomorrow with nothing." "Because everyone thinks I have an iPad. "'Cause I told them 'cause I don't have one. That's how fucked you me." "Cause you didn't get me one!" She's like, "well, we can get you something, "but it's gonna be your birthday present, you know, for next month." And he's like, "that's. okay." Then they're at <i>Best Buy</i>, and he's all happy. <i>And he goes over.</i> Okay, Wi-Fi Plus 3G, 64-gig. This one! This one! Oh, sweetie, $900? And she's like, "well, no, Cartman. Let's get these, 'cause". "Toshiba Handibook? Fuck you, mom." <i>And he gets all.</i> "It's $200, and I'm willing to get you one." He's like, "why don't you just wear a condom if you're gonna fuck me." You want to fuck me, mom? Just say so. <i>Go ahead. Here.</i> Huh? Go ahead, mom. Fuck me. Fuck me right here in the <i>Best Buy</i>. And it just cuts to the car, and he's crying. "I'm sorry." "Oh, does 'fuck' mean something naughty?" "I'm just a little boy." Why did you go outside to a police officer and say, "help, help, my mom is trying to fuck me"? Oh, wait, I get it now. The "F" word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry, mama. If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything. Well, now, that doesn't really have any logical sense, mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad, mama. <i>Oh, wait, I get it now.</i> <i>The "F" word is a no-no word.</i> <i>Oh, wait, I get it now.</i> <i>The "F" word is a no-no word,</i> <i>and I shouldn't say it around other people.</i> <i>I'm sorry, mama.</i> <i>If you're really sorry,</i> <i>then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything.</i> This place is built around them being <i>a completely self-sufficient operation.</i> There aren't shows that have been 220 episodes of the same people writing it, directing it, doing all the voices, watching every shot, <i>every frame, and they also preserve that outsider status.</i> <i>Instinctively, I think that helps you to be funny,</i> <i>is to not have an allegiance to any organization or whatever.</i> <i>I think that's one of the reasons why.</i> It's taking so long to do. I think someone just farted into the P.A. System. And so I guess there's a good chance that was Trey, but I don't know. So it's Monday at, what, 6:10 P.M.? I'm pretty scared right now, 'cause I'm up to 28 pages, and I still have one, two, three, four, five scenes still to write, and so. And each scene's about a minute long usually, so this is gonna end up being about a 40-page script, I think, which just means it just becomes brutal, because you have to go back in tomorrow and start. As you're coming up with new stuff, then you've got to start taking scenes that are there and figuring out, "okay, how can we make this same thing happen in half the time and rewrite it?" And I sort of always call it the rule of replacing "ands" with either "buts" or "therefores," and so it's always like, "this happens, and then this happens, and then this happens." Whenever I can go back in the writing and change that to, "this happens. Therefore, this happens, but this happens". You know, whenever you can replace your "ands" with "buts" or "therefores," it makes for better writing. The only note I have on this week's show is "pussy" and "fuck" and "shit." <i>So do you want to bleep it, push it, have me ask standards?</i> <i>What do you think?</i> <i>I think we should try to see if we can get "pussy"</i> <i>and lose fuck.</i> <i>Okay. I'll see what I can do.</i> "Fuck" is not funny. "Pussy". All right. It's so fucking ridiculous, but that actually is the way we do things. Now, the whole Cartman through-story in this is about Cartman getting screwed. He gets screwed by his mother, by Dr. Phil, by everybody, and finally, at the end, he gets screwed by God. <i>I need my ass lubed up if you're gonna me, God!</i> <i>Or how about you just moisten my ass with your tongue first, huh?</i> <i>How's that, God?</i> <i>Could lick my butthole before you fuck me next time?</i> <i>Standards said, "maybe not.</i> "You can keep that line, but you just got to be a little less explicit about explaining what that is." So I'm just kind of waiting for Trey to rewrite it, and then I have to send it in again. <i>Do you think you could have done this episode.</i> <i>Like, if this was season two, do you think that.</i> No. No. This show wouldn't. no. Like, go look at season two or season one, and it's so tame. It's like yo gabba gabba! By comparison to what we do now. Go home, you little dildo. Dude, don't call my brother a dildo. What's a dildo? We do shit now on the show that we could have never done in the second season. Ah, yes. Dad? Randy! Oh, there was a ghost. There's ectoplasm. We're always surprised, too, by. Sometimes in a week, we're like, "dude, could we really do this?" Just like most women out there, I've gotten into queefing lately. There's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just cut out some paper, like this. You can cut out little stars or little moon shapes. And then jam those up. And then I've got some simple little sparkles from the hobby store. See how pretty that was? "Like, okay. I guess we're gonna do this. We'll see what happens." And then nothing happens, and everyone's like, "yeah, that's just South Park. Anyway". And, like, that's just sort of. And it's just because, you know, the way that South Park was sort of brought into the world and the way it all started, even in its very first season and everything. That's just what it is, and so it's. For anyone to now. and especially 15 years later, for anyone to go up and go, "did you see this thing on South Park? That was really offensive." Someone's gonna be like, "dude, shut up. It's South Park." I hope that shit's still funny bleeped. Like what? All that shit about fuck me and fuck me and. The fucking animatic's hysterical the Dr. Phil thing. Eric, you say that your mom fucked you? Yes, she fucked me so hard. She me fucked on Christmas. She me fucked on my birthday. You know, mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first. <i>Got this massive Death Star that I haven't even taken out</i> <i>of the box yet, 'cause it's gonna be a beast.</i> <i>Sometimes to get my brain working a different way,</i> I'll just sit there and put legos together, 'cause it just. you got an instruction book, and you just sit there, and you do exactly what something else tells you to do instead of you having to tell everybody what to do. And it's just therapeutic. But I did that one last run. And actually, you can turn it on. It actually walks. It's pretty sweet. McDonald's. I got it. Chicken nuggets, and always with sweet and sour or hot mustard. <i>- Big Mac?</i> - Yeah. <i>And how does McDonald's affect your creativity?</i> It doesn't. I just makes me happy for, like, five minutes, 'cause I get. I hate writing so much, 'cause the writing part of it is actually so, like, lonely and sad, you know, 'cause it's just. There's that thing. I know everyone's waiting for me to, like, get it done, and, like. And just that little battle of fighting over lines and, like, trying to figure out what the best way to say certain things are, so I just hate it so much that a little bit. It's just a little sunshine. No, he's not. I'll find him. Okay. The search for Trey. <i>So what's going on with this show?</i> <i>What I'm hearing is, is that there's a bunch to write,</i> <i>so I anticipate that we'll go real long hours.</i> So we need some pretty significant cuts. <i>- Yeah. - Okay.</i> Almost every week on Sunday or Monday, I'm pretty bummed out. <i>I'm pretty much just like, "ugh."</i> And then I kind of get a little better on Tuesday, maybe a little bummed out, and then Trey gets really bummed out on Tuesday. We kind of hit our lulls or whatever, but I'm always like, Sunday, Monday, I'm like, "oh, my God. This, the show, this thing sucks." <i>Terrible.</i> I'm embarrassed for putting this piece of shit on the air. <i>A lot of funny stuff's just gonna have to get cut out.</i> <i>You just can't have a show</i> where "A" to "B" doesn't make any sense. And I'm bummed, 'cause I know, based on what I've handed over and everything, it's not gonna be a 5:00 A.M. day. It's gonna be a 9:00, 10:00 A.M. day. Beginning of act two is that; Then we come back, and that's when it's, "okay, the Geniuses are gonna see us now." And then, act three, we just start with the unveiling of the thing. And then we go to, they're doing the bubble thing, and Gerald flips out, joins Apple. We're back, and that's it. That's great. Yeah, that actually works. Hey, script's here, guys. Hey. Oh, thanks, Rick. To keep the action balanced over here, she's back here. <i>Yeah, right now, we just got. I just dropped in the audio.</i> <i>We're pulling the storyboards.</i> <i>I was in a hurry, you see,</i> <i>and I didn't know what I was agreeing to.</i> <i>I can't even read "Engrish."</i> <i>See.I want to redo these lines all wild.</i> Do it wild. I just want to get 'em again. I just clicked "agree." I-I didn't read it. I was in a hurry, you see, and I-I-I didn't know what I was agreeing to. - Yeah. That's good. - Great. It's okay if he starts out. <i>Well, no, that doesn't really have any logical sense, mommy,</i> <i>because I'm already being punished</i> <i>by not getting the iPad.</i> Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook? <i>No!</i> Well, then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been fucked! <i>Come on.</i> <i>We'll get you separated, little boy.</i> <i>Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh?</i> <i>Oh, no, don't make me "raff." Don't make me "raff."</i> <i>I always feel like,</i> <i>"wow, I wish I had another day with this show."</i> That's the reason that there's so many episodes of South Park we're able to get done, is 'cause there just is a deadline, and you can't keep going, 'cause there would be so many shows that I'm like, "no, no, it's not ready yet. Not ready yet." And I would have spent four weeks on one show. <i>All you do is start second-guessing yourself</i> <i>and rewriting stuff, and it gets over-thought,</i> and it would have been 5% better. <i>Why did you do this to me, God?</i> Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed up before I get fucked! The draft is ready, but that's the only part. Good job. Okay, good job, you guys. Excellent. Thank you. - Do this to the camera. - For the camera. <i>I think it's a good episode.</i> It's really twisted, but Trey can't see it that way. Trey won't be able to see it that way today. <i>Wednesday morning, after finishing an episode,</i> <i>he never likes it.</i> First shows usually kill us, kill us, and this one did, and that will have a ripple effect. I mean, that's good. The first couple episodes, we actually delivered a couple days early. We don't do that anymore. <i>It was a little bit sloppy and reckless,</i> but sometimes, especially after something like <i>Book of Mormon</i>, we just got to get back in that way, and hopefully the shows will get a little tighter as we go. <i>Got 18 minutes to have this tape feeding</i> <i>to New York so that they can begin roll.</i> Excellent. Great. All right. See you again next week. All right, you guys. Thank you. One down. Six to go. <font color="#3A9583">Sync by YYeTs</font> <font color="#3399FF">Corrections by Mlmlte</font> <font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font> <i>Where is everybody going?</i> <i>To the refreshment center!</i> <i>It's everybody's favorite spot for delicious, tasty food.</i> <i>From a snack to a full meal,</i> <i>plus all the extras including gum, ice cream, candy.</i> <i>Make your evening at this drive-in even more enjoyable.</i> <i>The refreshment stand</i> <i>has everything to make your visit here a pleasant one.</i> <i>Why not get something now?</i> <i>This contains 70,000 feet of film,</i> <i>reduced to the most terrifying 90 minutes every made.</i> We were giving the audience what they wanted to see. <i>The most grotesque creations</i> <i>we ever dared to show on your screen!</i> We did not have stars so we had to exploit the subject matter. <i>A tremendous social revolution is taking place.</i> <i>Here, for the first time, is the story of that change.</i> And I full accept the statement we were making exploitation films. Exploitation really is about ballyhoo. It's about marketing. <i>I have here the up-chuck cup,</i> <i>a little item passed out by the management to remind you</i> <i>that if you can't take the current double bill of horror films</i> <i>called Frenzy of Blood, that you better not come.</i> So in exploitation films, if you're selling sex it's, "The girls with the biggest breasts, and the most beautiful teeth, and the most luscious thighs, and you can have them if you come to this theater!" You know, I mean, that's what they're saying. It's sort of like, "Never before have you seen material so ripe for masturbation!" <i>A titillating motion picture of a young girl</i> <i>looking for fun and kicks!</i> The truth is exploitation implies lower budget and second-run. One of the things about low budget is you go where it's cheapest to make movies, and that is really where the Philippines come in. You've got jungles, you've got girls who you can exploit. You've got everything and you get it cheap. So many of the exploitation films made there were made for the United States, Australia and Europe. These were western-style Roger Corman tits-and-ass movies. And Marcos said, "Come on down. I'll give you the army." American movies that were shot in the Philippines in the 60s and 70s and through to the 80s were basically low budget drive-in movies. American companies would come to the Philippines and use it as a backdrop. They weren't sold as Filipino movies. They were sold as jungle action movies, and the fact that they were shot in the philippines was kind of secondary. And you'd think, are they Mexican? What are they? Because they weren't Chinese, they weren't Japanese. The Philippines appealed in several ways. First, it was inexpensive. The cost of labor was so affordable. We could hire Filipinos for about five bucks a day. They have an amazing movie industry. They had studios, they had all of the camera equipment that we needed. We shot with a Mitchell that was so old that the serial number on it was, like, 006. They had stunt people, they had special effects, demolition people. They used to say, "When you're hiring a pyrotechnics crew, just check their fingers. Just make sure they've got all their fingers. It's probably a good sign. Anti-Americanism was rampant all over the world, and we had liberated the Philippines from Japanese occupation so the Philippines was a place that still really appreciated American culture. That was very significant, I think. The Philippines was the Wild East as opposed to the Wild West. There was kind of a lawlessness about the whole thing. You were aware that this was a gun-happy, very dangerous society. The make-up man had a.45. The airline policy was that, you know, you won't have your guns on your person while we were in the air. So they were collecting the passengers' handguns. And you're thinking to yourself, I mean, is something going to break out? Why is everyone armed? Somebody had a gunfight in the lobby while some of my people were there, but that apparently. those things were kind of common. Human life was cheap, film was cheap. It was a great place to make a picture. The period of the B-movies in the 70's, 80's, maybe starting even from the late 60's, you know, is one of the sadly obscure periods in Philippine cinema. Eddie Romero is definitely the guy that created this kind of Filipino exploitation movie genre. I'm not exactly a pioneer in that area, although probably the first Filipino who entered that field. He began writing at a very, very early age and he came to the attention of Gerry de Leon. Gerry was considered one of the best directors we had in the Philippines. Gerry de Leon was the master, Eddie Romero was the faithful and very gifted apprentice, and from there, I am quite sure, you know, the collaboration started to happen. It started with an American G.I. Who had been stationed in the Philippines and he stayed on. Here loved living there. His name was Kane Lynn. We got to talking and he wanted to know if we could get together on production in the Philippines. It was just the perfect set of conditions to start something like this and to his credit Eddie Romero seized it Kane Lynn, Eddie Romero and Irwin Peizer's company, Hemisphere Pictures, was the first company to make real American co-productions in the Philippines. They were making war films <i>like Raiders of Leyte Gulf, The Walls of Hell.</i> <i>Will the American agent reveal the plans</i> <i>for General MacArthur's return to the Philippines?</i> The was films were not popular here and they could barely sell them I said, "Look, I think you ought to get involved with horror films. Forget about these war films." Well, Kane said, "I have an old horror picture." I saw it and I was knocked out. It was a great movie. <i>Terror Is A Man was a spin on The Island Of Doctor Moreau.</i> <i>He knew that the forbidden secrets he uncovered</i> <i>were against the laws of nature!</i> It's a not very subtle one but what de Leon brings it it is sort of visceral feeling of the pain that this creature that's being created out of animals feels. The shots were always striking. They way they were lit, the way they were framed and they way they were composed. Although it's just an exploitation movie, exploitation subject, you really do feel something for this poor creature that's midway between man and monster. Hemisphere put a gimmick in where this bell goes off. <i>A special warning bell has been installed</i> <i>to protect the faint-hearted.</i> <i>When the bell rings, we suggest they close their eyes</i> <i>and not open them until it rings again.</i> .and God knows where they picked up that footage. It does look like someone cutting into meat. I said to Eddie, "It looked very realistic." He said, "Oh, we shaved the pig and they cut into him." <i>Kane Lynn changed the title to Blood Creature</i> and it went through the roof, and they realized horror pictures were the answer. We learned especially in the small towns of the United States, horror films were practically a staple. <i>Visit one of the most mysterious corners of the world,</i> <i>where unbelievably cruel,</i> <i>barbaric customs are still practiced!</i> <i>The Blood Island series</i> were really just American drive-in movies with a bit of action, the suggestion of a bit of sex, some horror happening somewhere, the weird rubber-faced monster coming at you. <i>What sold the Blood Island movies</i> to American audiences was the blood, breasts and beasts. The three Bs. The kind of elements people wanted that went to the drive-ins. They went in the car with a girlfriend to make out, and every now and then they'd hear a scream, and they'd look up, see some-thing lurid happening and then they'd go back to their snogging. And I think that's how these movies are structured. If you went to see a film called Brides of Blood and you came out complaining about, you know, the fact that it was a cheesy movie with some naked Filipino girls being eaten by a monster, I mean, who would have listened to you, you know? What would you expect? <i>It seems that some living organisms on this island</i> <i>are undergoing drastic mutations.</i> They were kind of two-dimensional stories to begin with. Gerry and I tried to flesh them out a little more, but that was very limited on account of the nature of the market. Serve us as simple characterizations as we can, lets create a situation that was very tense, and make sure that people don't have too much dialogue to say because these probably weren't great actors and they might get it wrong. <i>Better go away now.</i> <i>You are making me uncomfortable again.</i> John Ashley was kind of a teen heartthrob throughout the mid to late 50s. A romantic idol among people who didn't know any better. Married to Deborah Walley, they divorced. His way of getting over the divorce in the late 60s was to take a job in the Philippines doing Brides of Blood. It was exotic for him. He loved the people, he loved the excitement. <i>Well you've got to admit he's got style.</i> John was a lover, you know? He had quite a few escapades here. I had a shirt made for him and all his girlfriends were embroidered on the shirt. A lot of embroidery. Ashley ended up becoming a producer on his own there with Eddie Romero. He was a charming person. He was very easy to get along with. He had great sensitivity for the personalities of other people. He was a good friend. Kane came to me because I was doing their advertising and marketing, and he said, "Brides of Blood! We want to have marketing. We've got wedding and engagement rings." Female patrons who showed up to see the movie got cheap plastic wedding rings because apparently they were marrying a monster in the film. "Genuine synthetic wedding and engagement set free." And I had the catchline: "Here comes the bride with a non-human creature by her side." And then Mad Doctor of Blood Island had green blood that was handed out to everyone. I invented this idea of the Oath of Green Blood. You had to take it before you could see the movie. <i>I join the Order of Green Blood with an open mind,</i> <i>and through this liquid's powers am now prepared to safely view</i> <i>the unnatural green-blooded ones without fear of contamination.</i> <i>The green blood potion has been known to passionately affect</i> <i>some people after drinking it.</i> I said, "Well, look, before we give these out I should test it." Well, I took it, I had a stomach-ache the whole night. <i>The Mad Doctor of Blood Island</i> <i>with his supernatural beings</i> <i>caught up in the rampage of gory brutality!</i> I thought Mad Doctor of Blood Island was the best of the three Blood Island pictures. There's at least one scene where someone's intestines are ripped out in glorious detail. The monster in that film is particularly awful. It looks like papier mache. There's a tendency to overuse zooming the zoom lens, and I haven't found anybody that likes it except myself. There were really no rules as to what kind of films they were making and what they could get away with so I think they were testing the boundaries. I don't think we came close to pushing the envelope. A lot of what they did became the standard for low-low budget horror films. The MPAA, the ratings board, didn't see these films. They could care less. So little kids were going to see monsters raping women staked to poles. Beast of Blood was the third film and it was the least horrific of the three. <i>From the world of the gruesome and grotesque,</i> <i>comes your most horrifying meeting</i> <i>with nerve-chilling fear!</i> It had a lot of nudity that Celeste Yarnall didn't want seen. That was supposed to never be seen by anyone other than the Japanese market which for me at the time seemed so far away. Of course now, with DVDs, it's all over the world, and I'm, "Did I do that?" I guess I did. <i>You'll see an orgy of bloody terror,</i> <i>as a mad fiend transplants human heads!</i> <i>Good morning, Ramon.</i> <i>I hope you slept well?</i> The head can talk to Doctor Lorka. <i>The day may come soon, Lorka.</i> Hence the famous line, "Lorka," because that head is going to get Lorka if it's the last thing he does. The conditions were incredibly primitive on that picture. They went back and back into the jungle. I had just found out that I was pregnant, and I tried to confide in them that some of these things were going to be a little bit rough on me. I'm supposed to drop down and be enveloped by quicksand. Well, the head stuntman had a rifle over his shoulder and when he leaned over to pull me out, the rifle swung over his shoulder and split open my face. That picture made a fortune. They found this formula and they stepped it up. They brought it up to a new level of extremity and it worked in their favor. It did well. But I got a little tired of them after a while. I think everyone's affection for those movies is based in tolerance. Sam Sherman, the guy who urged Hemisphere to get into making horror films, ultimately lost patience with them because they did make horror Films, they just kept making the same one over and over again. Eddie Romero was planning a picture called The Beast of the Yellow Night as a follow up to Beast of Blood, and it was a very complex Faustian story. <i>He suffers the cruelest curse ever placed upon mortal man</i> <i>by the Host of Darkness!</i> <i>Condemned to stalk the night with an insatiable lust</i> <i>for living flesh!</i> It was wild, but I felt it was too far out for this kind of a market. <i>Why do you think I keep bringing you back, Langdon?</i> <i>To awaken the latent evil in the people that I come in contact with.</i> I felt that for that type of film, the characters were more fully developed, more believable. <i>Whatever else you might be, you are still a man.</i> It didn't do as well. When the film was released in the UK the reels were put the wrong way round, and when I told Eddie this, you know, he just laughed. He said, "Did anyone notice?" And I said, "No, it probably made the film better." It ended up going to Roger Corman, and Roger Corman was kind of stuck with it. He didn't really like it. It was such a twist of fate, really, that Roger Corman came to the scene. John Ashley recommended coming to the Philippines and said, "You have carte blanche there. You can do whatever you want." Roger Corman wasn't like Kane Lynn or John Ashley. He had no love of the Philippines. This was just a money-making opportunity for him. I first visited the Philippines in 1970, which was the year I started New World Pictures. New World and Roger Corman were really the experts at genre films. Well, in any film that I've ever worked on with Roger there are three main elements that he's looking for. One is humor, which he considers tremendously important. <i>Grand Theft Auto is a love story.</i> <i>with cars.</i> Another is action, which he considers very important. And another is sex, which he considers important but not quite as important as the other two elements, I don't think. <i>This clinic deals specifically in sexual problems.</i> <i>What's the matter? Having trouble?</i> Cinema was really changing, and it was becoming R-rated, and these are low budget movies moving away from the studio films. In fact, if you look from today's perspective, at 1970s exploitation pictures, they look like they were made on another planet. The basic elements of them are things that you couldn't put in movies today and get away with. And these pictures always played at drive-ins where huge screens can be seen for miles around by cars driving back and forth, and the images in these pictures are astonishing. The New World Company built their success on women's exploitation. <i>It's the candy striper's job</i> <i>to make the patient's stay in the hospital more pleasant.</i> <i>This is not what we mean by pleasant.</i> <i>It was pleasant, wasn't it?</i> Our first film was a picture we made in the United States called The Student Nurses, which turned out to be a major success. <i>The Student Nurses.</i> <i>Once you've met them you'll never forget them.</i> New World did a lot of nurse pictures. Roger was just turning them out as fast as he could, making five, six pictures a year. Student nurses, student teachers and then what else could we have? How about young female prisoners? There have always been women-in-prison films. There's always been bad-girls-in-juvie-hall or the dormitory films. The difference between the films is really only how tawdry are we going to get? By the time we started, you could do a lot that was just absolutely unheard of, so that really made the difference, I think. So what have you got in the Philippines? Jungle. The Big Doll House was originally written for the United States, but after I saw the Philippines I thought we could easily switch this to a tropical prison and I could make a bigger picture for less money. The prison films focused always on beautiful women who were imprisoned rightly or wrongly and fought their way out. <i>This way you'll only get killed.</i> <i>Not if we get out of here fast.</i> Women in cages and in boxes and confined. We hear in one of the movies that the women are only allowed two showers a week, but we as the lucky viewers get to see both showers. You've got to have T&A and then a little torture. The person being tortured on the wheel or having fire beneath them and they're all screaming and then in the next scene they're fine. As far as incorporating all those elements, you had to have at least one per reel. I just imagine the screenwriters just saying, "Okay, I've done three pages, nobody's been tortured." And they just write that in. "Strip. Torture." <i>Women guarded by barbed wire and guns in a tropical hell!</i> <i>They call it The Big Doll House!</i> The Big Doll House set the tempo for almost every women-in-prison, women-in-jeopardy situation that came after it. Prerequisite girl-fights and dunking heads in toilets. That was pretty humiliating. I mean, they did it. They took my head and put it in the toilet. I read the script and I thought it was just, just awful. I said, "Oh my God, what am I going to do with this?" Jack was aware that people were willing to see women in these incredibly tense conditions, all being thrown together. What were the pressures that were going to build among these women? <i>Green, scared and pretty.</i> And they're not wearing very much and there's going to be lesbianism. <i>You can bed down over here where I can take care of you.</i> And there's going to be cockroach races. <i>That's it, go boys!</i> The Filipinos got these huge cockroaches that they were able to catch very easily. There were plenty of them around. <i>Come on, baby! That's.</i> All of these elements that ended up making for what he knew was going to be a sensationally entertaining film. Judy Brown strapped to a table naked and then being menaced by a live cobra on some kind of contraption like The Pit and the Pendulum. Silly, huh? Ridiculous. Totally ridiculous. There was a sheet of glass involved there. I'm a bit claustrophobic. Being enclosed in, that was what scared me more. And I was topless. Yeah. All these girls were ready to take on new experiences. They wanted to get their careers going and they wanted to be up on the screens and if it involved cobras, okay! <i>Meet the girls of The Big Doll House!</i> <i>Well, you don't look like a hardened criminal to me.</i> <i>They're young, they're beautiful</i> <i>and they're killers!</i> There were no big stars who came out of those pictures and went on to huge movies. That wasn't the case. <i>No shit!</i> Pam is the exception because Pam is basically Jack Hill's discovery. Even though she had virtually no experience and no training that I was aware of, I just felt she was a natural. And she went over there and she learned to act. They gave me The Actor's Studio, The Actor's Workshop, The Method. They gave me all these great books on Stanislavsky, right? So I'm learning this profound work, and I'm going to do a Roger Corman booties in the jungle movie. So I said, "I'm gonna do it. I don't care if it's a B-movie. I'm goin' in there and I'm gonna kill ya!" She had an intensity, obvious good looks, extremely large breasts and she was smart. She probably still is smart. You don't get dumb. And I think all of that shone through. Who you can talk into to going to the Philippines. That was the trick. My agent said, "Don't you do this movie!" I don't think a Hollywood starlet would be very happy there. It's so humid and so hot. I remember I got heatstroke. I don't remember ever having dressing rooms or honey wagons. My dressing room was a cave, and guess what else that cave was used for? The men's latrine. It was just horrible. You would immediately get a call from the agent saying that they were living in some rat-infested jungle hut. I saw a rat carrying a kitten through the window. <i>I wonder if everybody in this place lives like this.</i> And you would have to say to the agent, "Well, you know, it really is the best of those jungle huts down there, you know? They're really out there in the middle of nowhere." The bugs were enormous. Bugs the size of birds that were flying around. I can remember eating a salad and roaches were climbing out of my salad. I don't recall that there was any health or safety on set, off set, whatsoever. We were using military-trained attack dogs. The director of photography went in with his light meter to get a reading on the dog and the dog ate it. You just want to do the scene and you want to do it properly and get out. There was always a rumor that there was one girl who didn't come back and it was circulated around the actresses and they were all afraid to go because of this supposed girl who had vanished in the Philippines and never came back. Roberta Collins. She was in the first couple. <i>Action, big mouth.</i> She was like a favorite for directors of this kind of film. She had just a remarkable personality. <i>Get it up or I'll cut it off.</i> The audience just exploded with that line, and that was one that I wrote myself, actually. I don't know if I should be proud or ashamed of that. In my family, there was a lot of outrage about The Big Doll House. "What have you been doing, Jane? What kind of movies are these?" I didn't like the film. I thought it had gone a little bit too far with the sex and the violence. It was the most profitable independent picture ever made up to that time. It was just a huge, huge hit. The film cost about $100,000 and grossed something like four million. When I saw the grosses, I have to admit my scruples faded away, and I said, "Let's make another one." <i>Women in Cages!</i> <i>The sensational new motion picture that rips the veil off</i> <i>the dirtiest racket ever conceived by the minds of vicious men!</i> The market was flooded immediately, essentially flooded by us. Women in Cages was Gerry de Leon's last American-funded film. It's a beautifully shot film, but very lackluster in the performances and the plotting. If you like the title Women in Cages, you're going to like this movie, because you know what it's got? Women in cages. So, you know, it's truth in advertising. The next film that I did in the Philippines was The Big Bird Cage, which I did almost as a spoof on women-in-prison pictures. I felt to just do another one wouldn't work so I kind of made fun of the whole genre. <i>Darn!</i> <i>Nothing like that ever happens to me.</i> Jack was trying to appeal to what the audience responded to and we were surprised at how much the audience liked the humor. <i>The Big Bird Cage!</i> <i>A strange and brutal world of men who are only half-men!</i> <i>Don't play coy with me, tootsie.</i> <i>You don't have anything I'd be interested in anyway.</i> <i>And women who were more than all woman!</i> <i>I told you I was gonna cut it off</i> <i>if you tried to pull that shit on me!</i> But still including the kind of ingredients that you need. Being hung up by your hair in the sun? That always seemed to me a bit extreme. The fact is, if you really have a lot of hair, it's not that big a deal, that that can support your weight. I just liked the combination of Sid and Pam Grier working together so I starred them as a team in The Big Bird Cage. <i>Say, when are we gonna have that revolution anyway?</i> <i>Pretty soon, pretty soon.</i> Sid Haig is a lazy revolutionary who gets this wonderful idea of breaking the women out of this women's prison in order to help get the revolution started. Worst plan in the history of movies. Everybody gets killed, and it's supposed to be a happy ending. The Big Bird Cage did not do as well as The Big Doll House and maybe the fact that we played it a little bit too much for the humor hurt it. A lot of the pictures had no really redeeming factors as far as the stories were concerned. They were very bizarre, to say the least. I remember one film we made called Night of the Cobra Woman. I was getting tired of the women-in-prison concept, so we started to move into science fiction. <i>How much longer must I remain in this ridiculous human form?</i> It featured a woman who was part-cobra. <i>Plunging her fangs into warm flesh,</i> <i>she sucks the life from the bodies of men!</i> She's a woman who has sex with men and it extends her life but when they wake up they're like 90 years old and then they die. Marlene Clark had some sort of snake skin, and I remember a scene where she just peeled it off her body. It was a very strange movie. <i>Only the cobra could satisfy her unearthly desires!</i> If there's an underlying theme then it would be: Be careful of women. They're snakes, they'll suck the life out of you. <i>I've sucked the years out of your body.</i> <i>It was only way I could be a human and a woman again.</i> It was filmed in Slitherama, with a hiss. I came up with that, Slitherama. One of the things that made these films note-worthy was the fact that very few people were making films with women leads. Roger treated women in film really as heroes. And that was a departure. Moviegoers were not used to seeing women doing action at all. And even if they were little mousy girls at the beginning, by the end they're toting two machine guns and shooting down scads of guys. Female guerrillas. Machete maiden action. You not only had a female heroine but you also had a female being abused. So you got both sides of the coin and you appealed to the male audience and you appealed to any dates they may have had to bring, which I suspect were not many. <i>Is this how you get your kicks?</i> There are a lot of filmmakers who are responsible filmmakers, but sometimes what's fun are the irresponsible filmmakers who later say, "Well, of course, I was doing this." They were about women being abused at the beginning, but then taking over and having revenge. I think that was very helpful overall in terms of women establishing themselves on the screen as powerful figures and being empowered as women. Women really related to that, and began to love us as heroes. You hear people talking about the crassest, most exploitative, sexist, racist films as liberating and intelligent and I'm thinking, "What are they smoking?" I mean, "What?" <i>You can't rape me.</i> <i>I like sex.</i> Feminism and women taking their power was worldwide at that time, so taking off our tops was kind of a powerful thing to do. It was, to a certain extent, liberating. Look, I can do this, I can still be an actress and I can still be respectable. It's an interesting mixture of feminism because there we were being exploited in a certain way and at the same time, we were showing that we were powerful women. They took control, but they'll show you their tits. All those films in the Philippines, ten beautiful women, naked every single time. <i>Hundreds, I mean, hundreds</i> <i>of beautiful little girls running around bare-assed.</i> <i>And the only guy is you.</i> <i>That's right.</i> I don't buy that feminist stuff. <i>Whatcha talking about?</i> It's a tit shop, pure and simple. Feminism with aggressive women was not going to be palatable in the mass market without tits and ass. <i>Buonos dias, senoritas!</i> Somehow we had to do that in order to get to the next step. I didn't feel badly about it. I saw it as a path. Are we not taking this a little too seriously? Intellectualizing this? <i>This is not a film about the human condition.</i> <i>This is a film about tits and ass.</i> A lot of filmmakers deal with people all the time where someone says, "In your film, when the, you know, mutant woman gave birth to the mulatto monster who tore the head off the Nazi, weren't you talking about the exploitation of colored peoples around the world and their ultimate triumph?" And they'll go, "Yes, I was." And inside they're thinking, "What the fuck are they talking about?" The revolutionary spirit of young people in the 60s continued into the early 70s, so with a number of these films we had a rebel revolutionary spirit to them. <i>The revolution is at hand.</i> <i>The time has come.</i> A lot of pictures with rebels, a lot of pictures with corrupt regimes being overthrown. It was very easy for our directors to get the political content in because I told them I wanted the political content. In his mind, it was kind of a moral balance between the exploitable ingredients that he needed to sell it, and giving him a feeling there was some importance to it. And I bought that completely myself. If you look at Jonathan Demme's The Hot Box, that's overtly political. <i>The Hot Box!</i> <i>Four American nurses snatched</i> <i>from their work in a foreign hospital!</i> We abduct nurses to provide healing and medicine to our guerrilla army. We were doing the whole thing that Roger likes. You know, "Oh no, don't take us!" <i>You will do what you are told to do!</i> <i>If not, you will all be shot.</i> I played a character in the film called Bunny and Bunny was the one who always got hysterical. I hope someday you're on a date and then some maniacs come along and shoot your date and drag you into the jungle and then attack you and then not even tell you why! She wasn't very deep but she really said it like it was. We escaped, only to discover that the military was actually the brutes. <i>Soiled, spoiled and violated,</i> <i>they wouldn't take it lying down!</i> It was the girls learning firsthand what the efforts of the revolutionaries were about. <i>Do you get tired of seeing your sisters assaulted?</i> <i>Your families abused?</i> <i>Paying a fine week after week for trying to sell what you grow?</i> The original title was called Rx Prescription Revolution. One day I get a call from Roger Corman and Roger says, "Margaret?" "Hi, Roger." "I just want you to know that the title, Prescription Revolution is now The Hot Box." His sense of it was that we didn't have that iconic moment. He said, we're going to shoot that scene of the hot box. <i>Plunged into the fiery depths of the hot box!</i> They had some guy kind of spraying us down with hoses. <i>A tropical torture chamber where anything can happen!</i> And we were standing in the corner freaking and screaming, and now the movie was The Hot Box. The girls were treated in a way that was some-what titillating for that kind of audience, and I was really dismayed that the purity of what we thought we were going after was really kind of undermined. One of the great ironies for the Filipino pictures is you have these movies being made about revolution against essentially fascist dictatorships in a fascist dictatorship. 1972, alright? That's when all the TV stations just stopped and then suddenly there was that face. <i>I have signed proclamation number 10/81</i> <i>placing the entire Philippines under martial law.</i> Marcos declared martial law and he called all the shots. He was the ultimate leader. Martial law means military power, and he, as Commander in Chief, was in absolute control of this country. There were checkpoints. You know, militia with the guns and the whole thing. And they were on every corner. You had to be inside at a certain time in the evening. And if you were in a club and it was midnight, the owner of the club just went over and put the lock on the door and you had to stay and party all night till six o'clock in the morning. Okay. And if you went outside after curfew, they would put you in jail and you would end up picking up trash along the streets the next day. When they declared martial law you were supposed to go to some town square. <i>All unlicensed firearms now in your possession</i> <i>should be turned over to the Philippine constabulary.</i> After that time, you know, anybody with a gun, it was a serious offense. Brutality was absolutely a reality in this country. They'd stop somebody because he was kind of shady looking and. oh, there's a butterfly knife! Big offense. And they just shot him right there on the spot. Life was like. You could get snuffed out just like that. State control was almost absolute. And media definitely had no escape from this kind of governance. Artists of all kinds who were subversive were afraid to express any kind of opinion because they would disappear or end up in the prisons. Print, radio, television, and of course the movie industry were all under the control of the state through its various instrumentalities such as, for example, the censorship board. The only problem there with censorship is if you do a film that deals with subversion. In The Big Doll House, Pat Woodell's character has that one line. <i>Before you can do anything in here,</i> <i>a lot has to be changed out there.</i> If that were made in a Philippine movie, that would be stricken out and you'd never hear from the director again. <i>You're under arrest!</i> Somebody's determining exactly what kind of entertainment we're going to have, but the American movies were just out there. <i>So, you are the representatives of the people.</i> <i>Their liberators.</i> <i>And we are the oppressors.</i> Almost as if censorship was not in place. I don't think they had any jurisdiction over us. They had no idea what we were doing on a day to day basis. They didn't read the script. To a certain point that was kind of liberating for some of the Filipino directors who engaged in the production of films for export. If you're making an exploitation picture you actually can get away with a lot more subversive stuff or really powerful statements because nobody's looking. One of the reasons that we were able to get away with films with a revolutionary theme was the fact that we didn't really say in all the films they were in the Philippines. <i>Well, I shouldn't even be here.</i> <i>My trial was a real joke.</i> <i>Those fucking banana republic cops.</i> And I don't think Marcos would look at a character such as the Commandant in Big Bird Cage and equate himself to that. After that, the almost desperate need for the dictatorship to attract business into this country. We were trying to explain production to President Marcos, and we were talking about the various aspects, and the subject came up about below the line costs, right, in which he got a rather puzzled expression on his face and said, "Can you explain about this below the line. Is that something like under the table?" We got all the cooperation in the world from the Philippines because we paid 'em. Almost anything we needed, Marcos was very open to giving us. I asked the army to supply me with three helicopter gunships to be there at nine in the morning and the captain in charge said, "I apologize for being late but we were 100 miles north strafing and bombing rebels. We will now change to blank ammunition." Excellent idea, I thought. The army was very willing to stage the battle scenes for us. And that actually was important, because although we started with the women-in-prison pictures, we very quickly moved to action films. <i>Black Mama, White Mama!</i> From a hellhole of twisted passions to an inferno of flaming death! When Roger called me to invite me to do Black Mama, White Mama, he said, "I want you to know it's the female version of The Defiant Ones." <i>Chains of hate kept them bound together!</i> Two women, totally different purposes. <i>A terrorist and a hooker.</i> <i>You two should have lots to talk about.</i> Out for themselves but in the end finally bonded together. Pam dragged me through the jungle and I dragged her and then I got raped while she was on the other end of the. Pam Grier was amazing on all of these shoots because she was up for almost anything. There I am, hooked with handcuffs together with her, and if Eddie asked her to jump off a cliff she would have gladly done it and taken me with her. Some of that is an exaggeration, but we got along very well. I liked Pam very much. <i>What's that?</i> <i>It's a charm bracelet.</i> The later Eddie Romero movies, Woman Hunt, for example, was a lot sleazier in terms of the way the times had changed and that audiences expected more. They certainly offered a more extreme meal than the early ones had. <i>Pig, ready for the butcher.</i> <i>Come, join the woman hunters.</i> <i>Set your sights on the tastiest game.</i> Pretty basic formulas. Women being kidnapped and sold into slavery. They haul us in there in a cage through the jungle, and they turn us over to this lesbian black widow kind of woman. <i>Do you like to put on a beard when you do it?</i> <i>Do you dress up like Tarzan,</i> <i>or do you pretend you're a woman?</i> .who has her way with us. Another incredible bevy of beautiful women who were being hunted down by these wealthy industrialist perverted guys. <i>We're all pigs,</i> <i>and we're all going to be slaughtered.</i> Roger liked that theme where they were the game, the naked prey, and literally, having to flee for their lives and having to fight the hunter. It was a unique way in which to present a new women-in-jeopardy theme. <i>Hello, lover.</i> In the Filipino films, the best ones are the ones that are trying to do it for real, are trying to make a good movie. Failing miserably, but trying. I would look at making a B-picture for a B-audience with B-elements, but not Eddie Romero. Every picture to him was an A-picture that had complexity of story. I wanted to make the characters and the stories more believable. <i>My own wife, my closest colleague,</i> <i>you never understood. You never understood!</i> Eddie was doing a film with Roger called The Twilight People. We had all these characters that were half-human, half-beast, and one of the characters was The Bat Man. Eddie sent Roger a long script rewrite on how he wanted these characters to interact and so on and develop their stories. Roger sent back a very terse telegram which said, "Eddie, just make the goddamn bat fly." "You make the bat fly and we're in business." Nobody could really take any of those things that seriously, let's face it. So it's a take-off but it wasn't meant to be amusing. You gotta play it straight. I would hate to do a film without any trace of humor. I don't think there were many spots where you'd break out and really laugh unless it was maybe the poor little Bat Man trying to fly. When they decided that there was a limited return that you could get from pictures that were R, then they said, "Okay, we'll make some PGs. We'll make some fantasy pictures." A movie about Atlantis with fish monsters. They were odd-looking creatures, except for Leigh Christian who was a Terrific-looking creature. And also John Wayne's son as the star. <i>What's the pitch?</i> Ashley assured me that they were going to attempt to do something on a higher level, certainly a PG level. <i>A primeval princess</i> <i>leads a people from a kingdom beneath the sea</i> <i>to a blazing battleground above!</i> <i>Beyond Atlantis!</i> That's almost always the kiss of death because people who don't know how to make fantasy pictures for families end up making fantasy pictures that don't work for families. <i>Cannibal fish!</i> <i>We need a rope.</i> <i>I got one.</i> My father and I kept this hybrid society going by having me mate with humans. <i>It is your destiny to mate with an outsider,</i> <i>not to love him.</i> It was, like, highly improbable. You had to suspend disbelief along the way for all of this stuff. I wasn't very happy with the script. We tried to do what we could with it. I kind of, like, got the idea that people cared about it. I'm given a script and I do what I'm told and I collect my paycheck and go home. Eddie Romero got the idea that the scenes that I did with Pam Grier were incredibly sexy. Perverted but sexy. And so he thought that, "God, it would be great if we had him with two girls. That's gotta be twice as sexy, right?" Then we did Savage Sisters and I had four women. <i>C'mon, girls.</i> <i>Line up for your present!</i> I'm going, "This is totally nuts." But I wound up the whole deal by shooting all four. <i>Ha-ha!</i> <i>You needed only one bullet last time.</i> <i>Stinking bitches wouldn't stand still!</i> <i>Straighten your tie.</i> <i>shine your shoes.</i> <i>company's coming!</i> <i>Three little maids from the toughest school in the jungle</i> <i>with plenty of ammunition stacked in just the right places!</i> You couldn't possibly take it seriously. It was really a cartoon. It was full of sex. <i>I'm a dog.</i> <i>What kind?</i> <i>A whipped dog.</i> .money. <i>Greenback salad.</i> <i>My favorite dish.</i> .killings. <i>I guess this is where we blow your stinking heads off!</i> .anything you can think of. I enjoyed doing that, but there were limits to what I can do with the material. <i>You look kind of sexy all tied up like that.</i> <i>Well, I used to think I'd let all of you pee in my face</i> <i>just to see where it came from</i> <i>but hell, not anymore!</i> I don't know if I want to become so descriptive of what I had to do in the movie, but if you could just take your imagination of the middle part of a man's body and have a good time with it and tear it off. <i>Things were a little tense</i> <i>but I think it came off alright.</i> To say that I'm proud of the movie? No. These are not really the kind of films that I've been longing to make. They are the films that I had to make considering what the market had to offer and what the market wanted. Eddie's a very honorable man, and whatever he did he always gave it his best shot and sometimes it didn't live up to his hopes and expectations, but what else is new? He wasn't proud of the films and pretty much disavowed them late in his career. I was always tired of them but I felt, you know, I had little choice. He's now a national artist for cinema and a grand old man, which is pretty amazing for a guy who started with Terror Is A Man. Cirio Santiago was kind of the next generation of filmmakers after Eddie Romero. They saw what Eddie had done and they thought, "Well, we can have some of that." Here comes this maverick director, Cirio, who saw in the Filipino films that they produced, you know, something that was not Hollywood enough. He was making Philippine films when I met him and then he made the transition to working with me. He asked me if I wanted to direct for this market. I said, "Yeah, I would direct for free." He said, "No, I'll pay you $3,000." The first film Cirio directed for me was Savage! <i>Savage!</i> <i>That's his name.</i> "The biggest dude with the baddest gun." <i>He's more than a man!</i> <i>He's a death machine!</i> <i>Now their family's new hero.</i> <i>Savage, they call him.</i> I had grown tired of the women-in-prison genre, and I felt this black soldier of fortune action film might do well. <i>Let's do something to excite the imagination of the people.</i> <i>Something dramatic.</i> <i>It'll be dramatic, alright.</i> That was a time when black films were very special in drive-ins. They were very big. <i>Stronger than Slaughter!</i> <i>Slicker than Shaft!</i> <i>More super-high than Superfly.</i> <i>Savage!</i> Cirio was a good director and he got the army to come in for the big scenes. <i>Fire, all units!</i> So we really had a fairly big-looking film for a small amount of money. Savage! Is still a pretty shitty movie. <i>That's what you call an understatement.</i> <i>TNT Jackson!</i> <i>Black bombshell with a short fuse!</i> The basic idea behind TNT Jackson was to combine the black exploitation concept with kung fu. <i>You want it black, you got it black.</i> Roger called me up one day and said, "We have a script." I had read the theme. It didn't seem to read right. He said, "Well, you rewrite it." It was started by Dick and he got, I think, $500. Roger said, "Well, aren't you going to write any more?" I said, "I'm finished." And he said, "I wanted to get my money's worth." I heard them talk. He said, "Well, for $500 what do you want, Gone With The Wind?" I know very little about kung fu. The idea is to as much as you can on film at that time so you write a good sentence. You write, "The battle begins." That could be, you know, months of shooting and you got it covered in one sentence. It was fast and furious. It starred Jeannie Bell. <i>The name is Diana Jackson.</i> <i>Damn.</i> <i>TNT to you.</i> She was an unknown so I said, "We've got to publicize Jeannie Bell." My wife at the time, Sylvia, came up with the idea of a fake award. The first annual Ebony Fist award as the greatest black kung fu fighter in the world. She was a two-time winner. She was a two-time winner, exactly. Jon Davison, who was the head of our publicity, came up with a great catchline: "TNT Jackson. She'll put you in traction." <i>With that dynamite bod, she's a jet black hit squad!</i> "You'd better treat her fine or she'll shatter your spine." "You know you've been kissed by her ebony fist when the blood from your face stains your diamond necklace." That may have only been used in the TV spots. <i>She's a one-mama massacre squad!</i> This was one of those movies that was not, shall we say, in the forefront of the great even Filipino movies and we had to do a lot of faking in the trailer. We just decided to make up a whole subplot about heroin. <i>Undercover, out to blast a killer army</i> <i>that's poisoning the people with deadly China White.</i> "Deadly China White in black Chinatown where the red dragon rules." <i>Black Chinatown, where flesh is cheap</i> <i>and life is cheaper, and the red dragon rules.</i> Films like Savage! And TNT Jackson did bring a different look to the black exploitation films. They took it out of the United States of America to do black filmmaking, and as a matter of fact, you wouldn't think of that in the Philippines. Black actors in a new environment. It definitely opened up the business. <i>Still want to go home?</i> <i>Where's home?</i> <i>Yeah, I know what you mean.</i> <i>I think we've found our turf.</i> Once Cirio started producing and directing, I mean, all bets were off in terms of product being, you know, halfway-decent. They were usually out of focus. The sound quality was sometimes terrible. There were all sorts of scratches. There was gouges, and you'd occasionally see, you know, what could be claw marks from rodents. <i>Roll 'em!</i> Roger would just get madder and madder during the course of the screenings. "I mean really. we're really screwed this time." And they basically needed to be doctored. They needed new scenes shot. And Roger almost always wants you to add another chase or at least another explosion. You could hear him screaming at Cirio through the walls. "You really screwed me, Cirio!" <i>Break the sex barrier with the stewardesses of.</i> <i>Fly Me.</i> <i>Rated R.</i> I wasn't supposed to be a karate-kicking stewardess, but when we got back to the States they decided that it needed a little bit more punch. Fly Me, which was another terrible picture, had Jonathan Demme direct three days at the Amishira. They got David Carradine to come in for the day and he taught me karate and kung fu in an hour and a half, and then I just beat people up. I kicked the shit out of a lot of people, is really what I meant to say. As the pictures went on, they became a little bit more threadbare, and when Cover Girl Models rolled around it was pretty much the nadir of the period. <i>Authentic Oriental crap is what it is.</i> But what it did have is it did have a lot of dresses because they were supposed to be fashion models, and we said, "They're always overexposed but they're never under-developed." Very important. <i>This is Mark "F Stop" Fitzgerald.</i> If his camera could talk he'd be in jail for statutory rape. It's one of the best trailers we ever made. It doesn't reflect the movie at all. At some point someone is running and fires a gun in the air, and you cut to a helicopter. Now that's the picture where the exploding helicopter came from, and we learned that anytime anybody fired a gun, if you cut to the exploding helicopter, it looked like they blew it up. So later, when we found even, you know, less attractive movies were coming our way, we always had the exploding helicopter in our drawer. <i>They made her a criminal in Jackson County Jail!</i> As a viewer you would see New World trailers and go, "Wasn't that explosion in Eat My Dust?" So I used to look at these things and say, "These are brilliant. In some cases, the trailers are better than the films." Steve Carver did a lot of trailers for Roger before he moved on to directing for Roger, and he came up with some of the more memorable catchphrases, one of which was. <i>They wanted love.</i> "He gave them terror and death." We did push the limits whenever possible. On or off duty, they always come when you call. There were a lot of tricks that I employed learning from Roger, of course, how to distract the rating people. <i>Wow!</i> If something was coming up on the trailer, all I had to do was say something, they'd turn their heads and miss it. <i>Learn the bare facts from the Summer School Teachers.</i> And that's how we got a lot of that stuff by. Jon Davison bet Roger Corman that he could make the lowest budget picture they had made at New World at that time. Welcome to Miracle Pictures, where they make a picture a week and if it's a good picture it's a miracle! I said, "What is the film?" They said, "It's going to be Hollywood Boulevard and it will be a parody of a low budget motion picture production company." <i>Girls, I've called you all here</i> <i>to offer you a glorious opportunity.</i> <i>Look out.</i> <i>It is Machete Maidens of Moracau.</i> <i>Miracle Pictures new super spectacle</i> <i>shot entirely in the Philippines!</i> We were making fun of something that we knew very well. <i>We did this under the guise of a moviemaking plot</i> <i>and the girls go to the Philippines</i> <i>and they shoot Filipinos out of trees,</i> <i>but the Filipinos falling down are from another picture.</i> <i>But we went out to Malibu</i> <i>and shot the starlets with machine guns firing away.</i> <i>Go! Go!</i> <i>I want action!</i> There's a scene where they try to get Mary Woronov to meet some dogs, and it's just because we had this shot of this Filipino guy holding these vicious dogs. And so we just shot a scene that was the other angle. That whole movie doesn't exist except for the existing material. "Why is there a cut to that pig?" "Well, because the pig was in the Philippines and we were here and he was a free pig." <i>Ten days. Two units, ten days.</i> <i>No waiting. Two units, no waiting.</i> <i>Two directors, no waiting.</i> <i>Roger said it was the best 10 day picture of the decade.</i> It did reflect the spirit of New World. As a matter of fact, a number of directors who had started with us and moved on came back to play roles in the picture. Paul Bartel came back as a totally pretentious director of a low budget nonsense picture. <i>You tell the writer, T.G., that we have taken his empty,</i> <i>flaccid, stupid little story</i> <i>and firmed it up into a pulsating, penetrating, thrusting,</i> <i>unflinching look into the future.</i> Now when you look back at it it's kind of a documentary of how New World Pictures were really made. If you wanted a job with Roger Corman, he would like give you a broom. And if you did a really good job sweeping up, he would say, "Would you like to be assistant editor on this film?" And if you did a really poor job sweeping up, you know, you just stayed sweeping. It was an absolutely terrific place to be a young editor or young director or somebody who wanted to direct. <i>I would say that this is maybe the finest moment</i> <i>in my motion picture career.</i> I respect and I admire Roger Corman but he is so full of shit. He's about money. Roger's about money, and because he's about money he has given many, many people their breaks, which means, "I'm going to let you break your ass and work so hard for me, not pay you, make millions, but you'll have made a movie." And, believe it or not, that's not a bad deal for a lot of people. And you look at all the people who started with Corman. But you don't hear Bobby de Niro saying, "Roger gave me my start." He says, "That fucker still owes me money." Roger loves films. You know, Roger loves, in his own way. As he says, "There's only three ways to make films: The right way, the wrong way, the Corman way." You shoot the beginning, the end and the action. And the sex. <i>We want frontal nudity from the waist up,</i> <i>total nudity from behind,</i> <i>no pubic hair, go to work.</i> Everything else, all the dialogue scenes and all of the developmental scenes of the characters, those are left up to the editing and you shoot them very sparsely. Go to your cameraman and say, "How long to make it excellent? How long to make it good? And how long to get an image?" And then get the image. It's nonsense. I mean, I have no idea how these stories come up. From the start of the partnership with Roger, Cirio was able to also produce and direct for other film companies. <i>Ebony, Ivory and Jade!</i> <i>Three foxy mamas with a thousand ways to kill!</i> In Ebony, Ivory and Jade, I play Ebony, and I'm a track star and my rival, Ivory, and my best friend, Jade, get kidnapped by some terrorists. <i>What the hell is this?</i> <i>If you say one word, you die.</i> And we have to karate chop our way to freedom. <i>These sisters got soul they can't control!</i> There's action pretty girls. <i>I'm ready for my close-up, Cecil B. De Mille.</i> .kind of campy dialogue. <i>Oh, stop talking like a martyr!</i> <i>That's all you're trying to be is another black martyr!</i> With exploitation movies, dialogue and acting is always the problem. You want the film to move fast so you have a lot of action. Whatever you do, don't fall down because if Cirio wants to cut you out of the picture all he has to do is cut to a guy firing a gun and you're out and you're home, you're gone. He was trying to do good American films within a limited budget and limited time. He understood that kind of exploitation template with the humor. <i>We got mosquitoes,</i> <i>we've got ants, we've got no can opener.</i> <i>Dinner is served.</i> That's what I wanted to do. This is fun. Don't take me seriously. The Muthers to me, you know. it was what it was. Sexual exploitation in the jungle. <i>Just like every other snake I ever met.</i> <i>Can't leave my tits alone.</i> And the storyline was. We were two black female pirates. The lead pirate, Jeannie Bell, her sister has disappeared. <i>Do you have any idea where she went?</i> <i>When little Sandra gets out of camp,</i> <i>she doesn't leave her itinerary.</i> We get into the plantations so we can take her out and she gets killed. Then we have to find a way to get out ourselves. <i>Didn't you know? There's no way out.</i> <i>There's my way.</i> It's one of the few movies, I know for decades, where four black actresses play the lead. One of the things that we all had hoped for in Hollywood was the opportunity to get into a script where it didn't really matter what color you were. I mean, we're not trying to be black or against the white woman. We're just out there, wanting to get our freedom. It has nothing to do with what color you are. It has to do with survival. The only other parts that were available for me were hookers so I'd rather beat 'em up than be beat up. Firecracker was an idea of Cirio's. TNT Jackson had been so successful, he felt we should make a similar film but make it with a white girl. <i>See Jillian Kesner,</i> <i>grand prize winner at the Black Belt Olympics.</i> <i>She'll mix seduction with destruction!</i> She was a real trooper. She didn't know that much about martial arts at the time but she really studied hard and went full bore. The final showdown was interesting. They said, "Okay, we have these collapsible sticks, and she's gonna jump up and come down and gently push them on your eyes and they will collapse into themselves and maybe some blood will squirt out." And I'm, like, "Really? Let me see them." And they like showed me on a dummy and of course they stuck and the guy's jamming 'em down. I said, "You know, I don't think I want Gillian to push those down on my eyes." So of course they used a mannequin at that point. In the end, when they showed that sequence and she jumped up and, you know, my eyes squirted out, my mom literally almost had a heart attack. At that point, she jumped out of her chair and was, like, "Oh my God!" <i>Firecracker!</i> <i>The screen's first erotic kung fu classic!</i> Cirio lived a dream. He basically, you know, worked on a film every day of his adult life. American films, I did about close to 40. Filipino films, I made about 63. More than a hundred. He had diplomatic immunity for a number of years, which was a good thing considering the pictures he made. <i>Vampire.</i> <i>We are all vampires.</i> <i>We're all dead.</i> <i>And we don't like you very much.</i> Vampire Hookers. Yeah, that was awful. <i>Coffins are for being laid to rest,</i> <i>not for being laid.</i> The catchline was, "Blood isn't the only thing they suck." Imagine that. He used to tell his cast and the crew, "Don't think that we're making a B-movie. Think that we're making the best movie we can make." Cirio was a pioneer. Now we're having a hard time getting into the international market but he was there ahead, although he denied they were done here. I think he was still proudly Filipino. Bobby Suarez was a guy who'd worked for Rank, the English film producer and distributor. The big difference between Cirio and Bobby was Cirio was personally unflappable but Bobby was like a spark. He did the whole film with a cocked.45 automatic in his belt. And every now and then he'd just shoot at something. It kept everybody really nervous and in line. Nobody gave him any lip. He's very proud of the fact that he was a Filipino and he had this opportunity to make a little noise for the country as far as his films were concerned. He was a salesman as well as a film producer so as he's making his movies he's thinking what is commercial and what will sell, what is needed in the western world. The plots always got very confusing. <i>What's going on?</i> I never really knew who the bad guys were. <i>Who?</i> <i>Where?</i> I didn't really understand what they were doing, but they were bad so I killed 'em. I figured no one's ever gonna see this. Money was always scarce. They had car chases. and because they ended up wrecking the cars they didn't want to get a really good car. And they'd do flat out 35 miles an hour. I remember doing one car chase and traffic's passing us by. We were supposed to be speeding along. The breakthrough movie for Bobby Suarez was Cleopatra Wong. She's a fighter. She's a mean machine. It's about a syndicate that took over a nunnery. They actually capture the nuns. <i>Don't tell me that nuns in this country sport automatic rifles</i> <i>underneath their monastic uniforms.</i> Like all exploitation movies, it's got these scenes in it that stick in your brain. The finale, where the convent was blown up, there were so many guys dressed up as nuns and they never seemed to die, you know? They keep on coming, and those scenes were all in slo-mo. And you kind of think, "Well if all of the film was as powerful as that, then it would be some kind of a masterpiece." When Bobby was making it, he didn't think that guys dressed up as nuns were funny. It was a very serious movie. He was always trying to build a franchise, and he wanted to do a series of films using the same characters. That's why he made Dynamite Johnson. That's The Bionic Boy Part 2. Still very similar to Cleopatra Wong. They have this group of Nazi- obsessed people that took over a whole mining camp. I was Doctor Hiss. <i>By this time Tuesday, Hong Kong will be no more.</i> The scientist who had come up with this plan to have a laser that was going to blow up anything he wanted. The mine was guarded at night by a metal dragon. Well, I don't know if it was made out of cardboard but it was certainly made out of something flimsy that was about all we could afford. You know, Bobby had run out of money by that point. That dragon has got twin cannons for eyes, it has got a machine gun at its tail, and when the mouth opened, it breathes fire. The person who was inside working the flamethrower, the thing backfired and he got burned and everyone was running out of the dragon. It was hilarious. He would kind of make whatever he thought he could get someone to put up the money for. All Bobby needed was a film title, a good-sounding film title. He wrote something down. He said, "This will be my next film." And I looked at it and it said, The One-Armed Executioner. I said, "Okay." I said, "What's it about?" He said, "Doesn't matter. It's the title. That's what gets 'em in." <i>Haunted by the memory of a love that refuses to die,</i> <i>he ruthlessly seeks revenge!</i> <i>I'm going to kill every last one of them.</i> <i>So help me God.</i> Bobby Suarez was kind of dragged out of retirement by suddenly realizing or hearing that Quentin Tarantino was a big fan of some of his movies. He started to dust off some old scripts and send 'em 'round to all and sundry, and they were pretty much remakes of Cleopatra Wong and Bionic Boy. Bobby was like P.T. Barnum. Everything was larger than life as far as his films were concerned, and, I mean, they were what they were. They were okay for what they were, but, I mean, they weren't exactly blockbusters, even though in his mind they might have been. I don't think he realized that time had moved on and these movies were being looked at with a kind of nostalgic glow. God bless him for his vision, you know? He wanted to do something better than what was being done and he gave it a shot and to a great extent he did. <i>Here come The Losers!</i> <i>Killers by instinct, mercenaries by profession!</i> The Losers was about five Hells Angels in Cambodia rescuing a CIA agent, taking on the whole Chinese army. The plan was to blow a big hole in the fence. We got there too fast and I would have been blown up. It's too late to stop. <i>Oh my God!</i> I headed the front wheel to hit this post, and I hit it dead on. The bike was in the air and it landed on top of me. Safety issues were pretty crazy. Health and safety takes money. I sustained a lot of injuries. They made me hang from a helicopter 100 feet up without any safety nets. I almost fell during the second take. Bobby said, "Do you mind rolling out of the car at 35 miles an hour?" I said, "Yeah! Yeah, I mind doing that." The fights, it was no-holds-barred. Bobby calls me over. He goes, "Chris, it doesn't look like you're hitting them." I said, "You mean really hitting them?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Well, I'm not." "That's what they're paid for. Hit them!" Kick them!" One of the hoodlums really punched me here. My appendix burst out. Stunt guys there are nuts. They'd drive off cliffs, they'd jump off the cliff themselves. They would just cross themselves and jump. The people they would get to do the stunts they would regard as "Breakables." I said, "I tell you what. Bring me about 20 cardboard boxes and two twin bed mattresses." So they did and I set up a little fall pad. It was like, "Oh my God, we can drop an actor out of a three story window and not kill him! This is great!" Here we have fire suits that protect them and there they just put some fuel on a guy and lit him up and when he got hot he jumped in the water. If somebody got injured to the point where they just couldn't work anymore they'd just stuff a five peso note in his pocket and send him home. There were a couple of times in the films with Bobby where I'd throw a guy through a window. It was a glass window. They didn't know what candy glass was. They saw an American go through a window, they thought, "Well, hell we can do that!" There was this tower. It was supposed to be hit by a truck. The guard was supposed to jump first but he panicked, he hung on. He was killed. In a country where the rich rule and the poor are shit, you can get away with that kind of thing. They would take risks because this is the big American movie. You don't want to look back and say, "Well, that was exploiting." But they were paid their salary. We employed many, many Filipinos. Hundreds and hundreds. You could hire thousands of them if you needed thousands of 'em, and all they had to really do was put on black pajamas and charge up the hill with their AK-47 bad-guy guns and if they were close to an explosion they were supposed to flop over and play dead. So anybody can do that. I mean, it didn't take a rocket scientist. Apocalypse Now, of course, was without a doubt the biggest production that ever came into the Philippines. <i>My film is not about Vietnam.</i> <i>It is Vietnam.</i> <i>It's what it was really like.</i> Coppola was able to use helicopters, tanks, whatever. Marcos gave us just a blanket okay and then it filtered down to military men. Marcos didn't make any promises. You know, he complained that he couldn't get hold of any helicopters because Coppola was using all of them. The Philippine commander would say, "Well, the helicopters are sick today, but if we had a certain amount of money we could make them well." There was always these Islamic rebels in the south. The military would use it all for the time for an excuse. The real war took precedent over the fake war. <i>The Philippine government, the fucking helicopters,</i> <i>they take away whenever they feel like</i> <i>and they've done it three times already.</i> It was a crazy shoot. That's not news. Every time things were smooth and were running right, all of a sudden something disastrous would happen. Marty Sheen's heart attack, Marlon Brando arriving 100 pounds more than we expected. The typhoon. The roofs of major houses were corrugated metal and those sheets would fly off and it was like a guillotine that could decapitate you. When it cleared, it was just this kind of war zone. As they say, "Shit happens." I think Francis was absolutely brilliant on that movie. It's amazing what he got under those circumstances. He expected to get everything he needed and sometimes very often, he expected too much. It was. a little bit insane towards the end. There's a scene where they come in and there's all these bodies hanging from the trees, and they were using real bodies. Somebody said they were in the refrigerator in in the art department next to the beer. My lips are sealed. My buddy told me, "Come check this shit out." "Whoa!" But I never. I never saw that. <i>You're in the asshole of the world, Captain!</i> You're just thinking, "Can we get through this? Can we get through this day? Can we get through this week? When will we ever get out of here?" There was no calendar so you never felt you were progressing or achieving. We would refer to it as "Apocalypse Never." The good thing, a wonderful great movie came out of it. It defied fate. It should have failed, right? To relive it, I can't put it on here and watch it. You couldn't pay me. It was Francis Ford Coppola's big fantasy is what it was. You had Playgirl bunnies and people falling out of helicopters and guys smoking dope and taking drugs. It was a joke, and I don't know one Vietnam veteran that really could watch that movie and enjoy it. It just made us look like simpletons. Made us look like a bunch of total idiots. That was nothing like Vietnam. They were opulent. They overspent. They spoiled people for a while and then they went away and everything eventually got back to normal again. Marcos and Imelda saw that it might create a feeling around the world of serenity and security and kind of make it a little more enticing for tourism. Imelda Marcos was in love with actors and movies and really wanted to promote that side of her country. <i>I said to him, "What is my role as First lady?"</i> <i>And he said, "As President, I'll be the father of the country.</i> <i>I'll establish a strong house.</i> <i>And you make it a home. "</i> <i>So I said, "I'll build the cultural centre of the Philippines</i> <i>to be the centre of the Filipino soul</i> <i>and the monument to Filipino spirit. "</i> She did a great deal to expand the potential of Filipino films. She was the one who started the Manila International Film Festival. The dream was supposed to have the Cannes of the Orient, you know? The Cannes of Asia here. And so they built the modern day Parthenon. In a rush to finish building, a whole floor collapsed on workers. And the story is that Imelda said, "Well, look, you know, we haven't got time to dig 'em out and restart again so let the concrete dry and just slice the limbs off and then cover over it." In that pantheon of the cinematic arts, it's also a burying ground. <i>Which is a big lie.</i> <i>We got every piece of debris and we did not stop</i> <i>until we got each and every one of them,</i> <i>and each and everyone's family was compensated.</i> When it was finished, her dream of putting up the festival became a reality. All the big producers were there. The thing that most of them seemed to be interested in was this character called Weng-Weng. <i>Brace yourselves for the acclaimed international star</i> <i>of the Hollywood Cannes and Manila Film Festivals,</i> <i>Weng-Weng!</i> <i>Who the hell are you?</i> <i>Check it out.</i> He was a midget, but he's proportioned. And he turned out to be this three and a half foot secret agent guy. They used him as a decoy during raids. He could infiltrate a small opening, they'd shove him in, open the doors, you know? He made a whole series of films, as we discover now. <i>This is Agent 00,</i> <i>and he will stop at nothing to get his man in</i> <i>For Y'ur Height Only!</i> Lo and behold, to everyone's surprise, this film became the darling of the market. <i>You're such a little guy, though.</i> <i>Very petite, like a potato.</i> <i>Yeah, let's go.</i> I can see why it may have been considered a bit embarrassing. All of the things that you get in James Bond movies, you know, the karate scenes, the flying jet packs, the daring escapes, and the getting the girl, are all in the Weng-Weng movies. He could parachute using an umbrella. One of the people behind the promotion of Weng-Weng was Dick Randall, and one of his specialities was dubbing of movies. But he had a very peculiar sense of humor, did Dick, so when he got the chance to dub this Weng-Weng movie into English he really went to town. <i>You know sex is like tequila.</i> <i>Take one sip and you're a goner.</i> <i>Shall we get it on?</i> <i>Yes, darling, bare your bod.</i> My husband just adored Weng-Weng. He would sit on his lap, and Dick'd get all excited. "Oh, oh, Weng-Weng's wonderful. We have to." <i>You know, you're making me fall for you.</i> He had his own style. He could be funny. If you find that sort of thing funny, you know, you will be able to watch that film with pleasure for the rest of your life. If you don't get it, you're gonna just not get it at all. <i>Oh, my little head.</i> I didn't understand it. I'd look at it and say, "Oh my God." He was really a parody and we are all just laughing at it, not laughing for ourselves but laughing for America. But I think it's revenge of third world filmmakers to be able to take these kinds of popular genres from Hollywood and slightly subvert them and then send them back out again and just say, "Well, look what we've done, and a big raspberry to you." Hey, take this! We shrunk the goon. It makes perfect sense. This is exactly what Filipinos do. We transform our pain into ridicule. Did Hollywood use us, or did we really make a breakthrough in Hollywood, at the margins as it may be, and use this for our own cultural agenda? Why the rest of the world got it, I will never know. The audience was changing a little bit in the late 1970s. People started thinking, "You know, I'm paying the same amount of money for this as I am to see Star Wars and this isn't nearly as good." What Spielberg and Lucas did, their big influence was to take exploitation films which had always been B-budget and now make them A-budget pictures. The biggest of that type of film was Jaws, and when it came out Vincent Canby, the main critic for The New York Times said, "What is Jaws but a big Roger Corman film?" What he didn't say was, It was not only bigger than mine, it was better than mine. And when I saw Jaws, I thought, "I'm in trouble and my compatriots are in trouble." I made Piranha for Roger and it was an unexpected hit, and of course I was asked back to do another film. I was asked to do a picture called Humanoids From The Deep, which was another American version of Piranha. <i>Humanoids From The Deep.</i> Later on, he did a picture called Up From The Depths, which was the Filipino rip-off version. <i>Beneath these waves lies a horror beyond imagining,</i> <i>hungry for human flesh,</i> <i>and it's coming Up From The Depths!</i> I sent Chuck Griffiths, who was a good writer-director and had done many films for us, to the Philippines. Chuck was dealing very often with the dreck and so he was sent off to do Up From The Depths and the only way he felt that he could do justice to it was to make fun of it. <i>I'll kill it!</i> <i>I'll kill it! I'll kill it!</i> <i>No, you fool!</i> <i>There are people out there!</i> <i>Ow, my foot!</i> And the producer, being Cirio Santiago, wanted to make it a scary, more serious film. <i>The sun's in my eyes.</i> So then it becomes somewhat of a dilemma because you have kind of two films going on simultaneously, and, you know, what is it, you know? Roger didn't mind you making fun of the movie, but he really didn't like it if the movie wasn't as advertised. <i>A living tidal wave of terror is rising,</i> <i>clawing, eating its way Up From The Depths!</i> The creature they built was a little bit crude. It wasn't as good as it should have been. Chris Walas made an underwater monster that was supposed to be propelled by a diver who was holding it in front of him. But the front half was so heavy that when you would start to shoot it, it would just dip down like this. <i>We got it!</i> <i>Jimmy!</i> Anything that mimicked a large budget film like Jaws, if Roger's version were to come out it would be panned automatically. The critics were a big problem and I think critics change audiences. I felt maybe we had made too many films in too short a period of time in the Philippines, so we concentrated on coming back home and shooting in America. Fewer and fewer marketplaces were available to him. The drive-ins were starting to close. The grindhouses are starting to disappear. The big budget films were starting to dominate, so we had to adjust to that. And Roger still continued making pictures into the 80s but the places to play them became limited and they started to go directly to VHS. But that's life. I think we lost that because it's nice to have your film shown in a theatre, enjoyed by people. Sometimes it would be difficult to promote the Philippines as a safe filmmaking site because of the security problems. In the south you have the Muslim militants, who are in constant uprising and they're always shooting people and kidnapping people and blowing things up. Banditry was not a problem when I was shooting there but a little later on when things deteriorated, it was dangerous to go out on the road. People in the congo area they could kill for a bottle of beer. I put my kids in a little Montessori school and there were guys with sub-machine guns guarding every entrance to prevent kidnapping. The political climate, I think, just went a little crazy. Filmmakers just finally got to the point where they were afraid to go over and even if they weren't afraid to go over and shoot their movie there, the insurance companies wouldn't bond us. That was basically the start of the end of filmmaking in the Philippine islands. That is a time in filmmaking that will probably never happen again, ever. I'm not saying that time was better than this time, although it may have been. I look back at it now and really do think of it sort of as the good old days because we were having fun. It felt raw over there. That's what I liked a lot about it. It wasn't anything that was polished, made to appear to be anything more than what it was. It was an amazing time. Exciting, fun, creative. We did have an audience for these movies, which helped the studios go, "Aha! I think I'll have another female action lead." Which is good. Very good. They're silly and in a way primitive but also very engaging and visceral. I think the salaciousness of them and the sexiness is so trivial by today's standards that you can really look at these films and you can say, "Gee, these are really fun." They all did well and they excited us and they were the ultimate guilty pleasures. You know, you can look back on these things and think, oh, it was sleazy or it was this or it was that, but it really wasn't. It was really revolutionary. To have one of those great B-movies in the Philippines under your belt, that's not so bad. To me, it's always an exciting time to be making films. The first time Savage! Was shown on Hollywood Boulevard, I was there for one hour looking at the marquee. The stories that take place on a film set are ten times better than any of the movies, any of the movies. I've worked on too many films where people are like, "We're losing the light! Jesus Christ! Oh, shoot into the. just shoot this! Okay, and run over there, blow that up, action sequence, okay, shit. If this isn't coherent; we'll put it in anyway." And later people are going, "The brilliant direction of" somebody somebody, you know. I've worked on too many movies to buy into this stuff. I don't know. Where do these statements come from? This is one of the weirdest interviews I've ever had. <i>As you leave the theatre, folks, please be careful.</i> <i>Don't let this happen to your car.</i> <i>If you should accidentally pull a speaker loose,</i> <i>please turn it in to our snack bar or box office.</i> <i>Thanks.</i> (Camera clicks) Three, two, one, take two. Good morning. Welcome to Erin Mills town centre. Home of the world's largest, permanent, point-of-purchase video wall installation. My name is Kelvin Flook and I'm your video host all day here at EMTV. I want to take this opportunity to extend a special and warm welcome to the film crew from Necessary Illusions. We've got an excellent line-up of television programming today, so. let's get on with it. So, how long have they been working on this documentary? Gosh, they've been working on it I don't know how long. Every country I show up, they're always there. They're in England, they're in Japan. All over the place. MILLER: Jesus. CHOMSKY: They must have 500 hours of tape. MILLER: Bet they put together a really doozy when they're done, huh? CHOMSKY: I can't imagine who's going to want to hear somebody talk for an hour. But I guess they know what they're doing. So, where are you all from? ALL: Florida. - Florida? ALL: Yeah, Gulf Coast. You all talk like in chorus. We're making a film about Noam Chomsky. Does anybody know who Noam Chomsky is? ALL: No! (Whistle blows) MILLER: Good aternoon and welcome to Wyoming Talks. My guest today is well-known intellectual Noam Chomsky. Thank you for being on our programme today. CHOMSKY: Very glad to be here. I know probably the main purpose for your trip to Wyoming is to discuss thought control in a democratic society. Now, all right, say I'm just Jane USA. And I say, "Well, gee, this is a democratic society, what do you mean - thought control?" "I make up my own mind. I create my own destiny". What would you say to her? Well, I would suggest that Jane take a close look at the way the media operate, the way the public relations industry operates. The extensive thinking that's been going on for a long, long period, about the necessity for finding ways to marginalise and control the public in a democratic society. But particularly to look at the evidence that's been accumulated, about the way the major media, The agenda-setting media, I mean, the national press, and the television and so on, the way that they shape and control the kinds of opinions that appear. The kinds of information that comes through, the sources to which they go. I think Jane will find some very surprising things about the democratic system. BAUSLAUGH: I'd like to welcome all of you to this lecture today. Several years ago, Professor Chomsky was described in The New York Times Book Review as follows: "Judged in terms of the power, range, novelty and influence of this thought, Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive." Professor Noam Chomsky. (Audience applauds) I gather there are some people behind that blackness there. But if I don't look you in the eye, it's because I don't see you, all I see is the blackness. Perhaps I ought to begin by reporting something that's never read. The line about "arguably the most important intellectual in the world," and so on comes from a publisher's blurb and you got to watch those. If you go back to the original, you'll find that that sentence is actually there. This is in The New York Times. But the next sentence is, "Since that's the case, how can he write such terrible things about American foreign policy?" They never quote that part. If it wasn't for that second sentence, I'd begin to think that I'm doing something wrong. And I'm not joking about that. It's true that the Emperor doesn't have any clothes but he doesn't like to be told it. The Emperor's lap dogs, like The New York Times, will not enjoy the experience if you do. Good evening. I'm Bill Moyers. What's more dangerous: The big stick of the big lie? Governments have used both against their own people. Tonight I'll be talking with a man who has been thinking about how we can see the developing lie. He says that propaganda is to democracy what violence is to a dictatorship. But he hasn't lost faith in the power of common people to speak up for the truth. You have said that we live entangled in webs of endless deceit, that we live in a highly indoctrinated society, where elementary truths are easily buried. Elementary truths such as. Such as the fact that we invaded South Vietnam. Or that we're standing in the way of significant, and have for years, of significant moves towards arms negotiation. Or the fact that the military system is to a substantial extent, not totally, but to a substantial extent, a mechanism by which the general population is compelled to provide a subsidy to high-technology industry. Since they're not going to do it if you ask them to, you have to deceive them into doing it. There are many truths like that. We don't face them. Do you believe in common sense? Absolutely. I believe in Cartesian common sense. I think people have the capacities to see through the deceit in which they're ensnared. But you got to make the effort. It seems a little incongruous to hear a man from the ivory tower of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a scholar. a distinguished linguistics scholar, talk about common people with such appreciation. I think scholarship, at least the field I work in, has the opposite consequences. My own studies in language and human cognition demonstrate to me, at least, what remarkable creativity ordinary people have. The very fact that people talk to one another just in a normal way, nothing particularly fancy, reflects deep-seated features of human creativity, which separate human beings from any other biological system we know. TV: Tonight, scientists talk to the animals. But are they talking back? (Chimp shrieks) The Journal with Barbara Frum and Mary Lou Finlay. Communicating with animals is a serious scientific pursuit. This is Nim Chimpsky. Nim, jokingly named ater the great linguist Noam Chomsky, was the great hope of animal communication in the 1970s. For four years Pettito and others coached him in sign language, but in the end they decided it was a lost cause. Nim could ask for things, but not much more. PETITO: I would have loved to have a conversation with Nim and understand how he looked at the universe. He failed to communicate that information to me, and we gave him every opportunity. STEINBERG: Noam Chomsky, theorist of language and political activist, has had an extraordinary career. I can think of none like it in recent American history and few anywhere any time. He has literally transformed the subject of linguistics. He also has become one of the most consistent critics of power politics in all its protean guises. Scholar and propagandist, his two careers apparently reinforce each other. In 1957, he published his Syntactic Structures, which began what has frequently been called the Chomskyan Revolution in Linguistics. Like a latter-day Copernicus, Chomsky proposed a radically new way of looking at the theory of grammar. Chomsky worked out the formal rules of the universal grammar which had generated the specific rules of actual or natural languages. The general approach I'm taking seems to me rather simple minded and unsophisticated, but, nevertheless, correct. Later he came to argue that such systems are innate features of human beings. They belong to the characteristics of the species and have been, in effect, programmed into the genetic equipment of the mind like the machine language in a computer. One needn't be interested in this question. Of course, I am interested in it. The interesting question from this point of view is what is the nature of the initial state? That is, what is human nature in this respect? That in turn explains the astonishing. Try the next one. Fa-cki-li-ty - Facility. - Facility. STEINBERG: That in turn explains the astonishing facility children have in learning the rules of natural language, no matter how complicated, incredibly quickly, from what are imperfect and oten degenerate samples. - Compli. - Complicated. It's a complicated word. Do you know what "complicated" means? It means it's complicated. CHOMSKY: If in fact our minds were a blank slate and experience wrote on them, we would be very impoverished creatures indeed, so the obvious hypothesis is that our language is the result of the unfolding of a genetically determined programme. Well, plainly there are different languages. In fact, the apparent variation of languages is quite superficial. It's certain - as certain as anything else is - that humans are not genetically programmed to learn one or another language. So, you bring up a Japanese baby in Boston, and it'll speak Boston English. You bring up my child in Japan, it'll speak Japanese. And that means that. From that it fol. from that it simply follows by logic that the basic structure of the languages must be essentially the same. Our task as scientists is to try to determine exactly what those fundamental principles are that cause the knowledge of language to unfold in the manner in which it does under particular circumstances. Incidentally, I think there is no doubt the same must be true of other aspects of human intelligence, and systems of understanding and interpretation, and moral and aesthetic judgement, and so on. STEINBERG: The implications of these views have washed over the fields of psychology, education, sociology, philosophy, literary criticism, and logic. RÉE: In the '50s and '60s the bridge between your theoretical work and your political work seems to have been the attack on behaviourism, but now behaviourism is no longer an issue, or so it seems, so how does this leave the link between your linguistics and your politics? Well, I've always regarded the link. I've never. really perceived much of a link, to tell you the truth. Again, I would be very pleased to be able to discover intellectually convincing connections between my own anarchist convictions on the one hand, and what I think I can demonstrate, or at least begin to see about the nature of human intelligence on the other. But I simply can't find intellectually satisfying connections between those two domains. I can discover some tenuous points of contact. FOUCAULT (in French) If it is correct, as I believe it is, that a fundamental element of human nature is the need for creative work, or creative inquiry for for free creation without the arbitrary, limiting effects of coercive institutions, then of course it will follow that a decent society should maximise the possibilities for this fundamental human characteristic to be realised. Now, a federated, decentralised system of free associations incorporating economic as well as social institutions would be what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism, and it seems to me that it is the appropriate form of social organisation for an advanced technological society in which human beings do not have to be forced into the position of tools, of cogs in a machine. STEINBERG: Since the 1960s Noam Chomsky has been the voice of a very characteristic brand of rationalist libertarian socialism. He's attacked the abuses of power wherever he saw them, he's made himself deeply unpopular by his criticism of American policy, the subservience of the intelligentsia, the degradation of Zionism, the distortions of media, and self-delusions of prevailing ideologies. CHOMSKY: Under the liberal administration of the 1960s the club of academic intellectuals designed and implemented the Vietnam war, and other similar, though smaller, actions. This particular community is a very relevant one to consider at a place like MIT because of course you're all free to enter into this community. In fact, you're invited and encouraged to enter it. The community of technical intelligentsia, and weapons designers, and counter-insurgency experts, and pragmatic planners of an American empire, is one that you have a great deal of inducement to become associated with. The inducements, in fact, are very real. The rewards in power, and affluence, and prestige, and authority. Jamie? This came with the mail. Be with you in a second. Oh, God, they've still got their cameras. OK? We'll start. In your essay Language and Freedom, you write, "Social action must be animated by a vision of a future society". I was wondering what vision of a future society animates you? I have my own ideas as to what a future society should look like. I've written about them. I mean, I think that we should. At the most general level, we should be seeking out forms of authority and domination, and challenging their legitimacy. Sometimes they are legitimate - that is, let's say they're needed for survival. So, for example, I wouldn't suggest that during the Second World War. the forms of authority. We had a totalitarian society, basically. I thought there was some justification for that under wartime conditions. And there are other forms of. Relations between parents and children, for example, involve forms of coercion which are sometimes justifiable. But any such. Any form of coercion and. control requires justification, and most of them are completely unjustifiable. Now, at various stages of human civilisation it's been possible to challenge some of them, but not others. Others are too deep-seated, or you don't see them, or whatever, so at any particular point you try to detect those forms of authority and domination which are subject to change, and which. do not have any legitimacy, in fact which oten strike at fundamental human rights, and your understanding of fundamental human nature and rights. Well, what are the major things, say today? There are some that are being addressed in a way. The feminist movement is addressing some. The civil rights movement is addressing others. The one major one that is not being seriously addressed is the one that's really at the core of the system of domination, and that's private control over resources. And that means an attack on the fundamental structure of state capitalism. I think that's in order. That's not something far off in the future. VOICEOVER: Your life work. The alphabet has only 26 letters. With these 26 magic symbols, however, millions of words are written every day. Nowhere else are people so addicted to information and entertainment via the printed word. Every day the world comes thumping on the American doorstep, and nothing that happens anywhere remains long a secret from the American newspaper reader. It comes to us pretty casually, the daily paper, but behind its arrival on your doorstep is one ofjournalism's major stories. How it got there. There is a standard view about democratic societies, and the role of the media within them. It's expressed for example by Supreme Court Justice Powell when he spoke of the crucial role of the media in effecting the societal purpose of the First Amendment, namely enabling the public to assert meaningful control over the political process. That kind of formulation expresses the understanding that democracy requires free access to information, and ideas, and opinion, and the same conceptions hold not only with regard to the media, but with regard to educational institutions, publishing, the intellectual community generally. NARRATOR: It is basic to the health of a democracy that no phase of government activity escape the scrutiny of the press. Here reporters are assigned to stories fateful not only to our nation, but to all nations. "Congress", says the First Amendment, "shall pass no law abridging the freedom of the press". And the Chief Executive himself throws open the doors of the White House to journalists representing papers of all shades of political opinion. But is worth bearing in mind that there is a contrary view, and in fact the contrary view is very widely held, and deeply rooted in our own civilisation. It goes back to the origins of modern democracy, to the 17th-century English revolution which was a complicated affair like most popular revolutions. There was a struggle between Parliament representing largely elements of the gentry and the merchants, and the Royalists representing other elite groups, and they fought it out. But like many popular revolutions, there was also a lot of popular ferment going that was opposed to all of them. There were popular movements that were questioning everything - the relations between master and servant, the right of authority altogether. All kinds of things were being questioned. There was a lot of radical publishing - the printing presses had just come into existence - and this disturbed all the elites on both sides of the Civil War. So as one historian pointed out at the time in 1660. He criticised the radical democrats, the ones who were calling for what we would call democracy, because. Now, underlying these doctrines which were very widely held is a certain conception of democracy. It's a game for elites. It's not for the ignorant masses who have to be marginalised, diverted and controlled of course, for their own good. The same principles were upheld in the American colonies. The dictum of the founding fathers of American democracy that: "People who own the country ought to govern it", quoting John Jay. MAN: Fire! (Gunfire and screaming) (Military band plays) (Gunfire) Now, in modern times for elites, this contrary view about the intellectual life, and the media, and so on, this contrary view in fact is the standard one, I think, apart from rhetorical flourishes. SIKOROVSKY: From Washington DC, he is intellectual, author and linguist Professor Noam Chomsky. Manufacturing Consent - what is that title meant to describe? Well, the title is actually borrowed from a book by Walter Lippmann written back around 1921 in which he described what he called the manufacture of consent as a revolution in the practice of democracy. What it amounts to is a technique of control, and he said this was useful and necessary because the common interests, the general concerns of all people, elude the public. The public just isn't up to dealing with them, and they have to be the domain of what he called a specialized class. Notice that that's the opposite of the standard view about democracy. There's a version of this expressed by the highly respected moralist and theologian Reinhold Niebuhr who was very influential on contemporary policy makers. His view was that rationality belongs to the cool observer, but because of the stupidity of the average man, he follows not reason but faith, and this naïve faith requires necessary illusion and emotionally potent over-simplifications which are provided by the myth maker to keep the ordinary person on course. It's not the case, as the naïve might think, that indoctrination is inconsistent with democracy. Rather, as this whole line of thinkers observes, it's the essence of democracy. The point is that in a military state, or a feudal state, or what we would nowadays call a totalitarian state, it doesn't much matter what people think, because you've got a bludgeon over their head, and you can control what they do. (Crowd chants) But when the state loses the bludgeon, when you can't control people by force, and when the voice of the people can be heard, you have this problem - it may make people so curious and so arrogant that they don't have the humility to submit to a civil rule, and therefore you have to control what people think. And the standard way to do this is to resort to what in more honest days used to be called propaganda. Manufacture of consent. The creation of necessary illusions. Various ways of either marginalising the general public, or reducing them to apathy in some fashion. (Applause) (Woman speaking Japanese) TRANSLATOR: The oldest of two boys, Avram Noam Chomsky was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1928. As a Jewish child, the anti-Semitism of the time affected him. Both parents taught Hebrew, and he became fascinated by literature, reading translations of French and Russian classics. He also took an interest in a grammar book written by his father on Hebrew of the Middle Ages. He recalls a childhood absorbed in reading curled up on the sofa, oten borrowing up to 12 books at once from the library. He is married to Carol, and they have three children. CHOMSKY: I don't like to impose on my wife and children a form of life that they certainly haven't selected for themselves, namely one of public exposure, exposure to the public media. That's their choice, and I don't believe they themselves have selected this. I don't impose it on them, and I would like to protect them from it, frankly. The second sort of perhaps principled point is that I'm rather against the whole notion of developing public personalities who are treated as stars of one kind or another, where aspects of their personal life are supposed to have some significance. Take one in the reception room. WOMAN: You said you were just like us - you went to school, got good grades. What made you start being critical, you know, and seeing the different. What started the change? Well, you know, there are all kinds of personal factors in anybody's life. Don't forget I grew up in the Depression. (Tyres squeal) (Crashing) My parents actually happened to have jobs, which was kind of unusual. They were Hebrew school teachers, so lower middle class. For them, everything revolved around being Jewish. Hebrew, and Palestine in those days, and so on. I grew up in that milieu, so I learned Hebrew, went to Hebrew school, became a Hebrew school teacher, went to Hebrew college, led youth groups, summer camp, Hebrew camps. The whole business. The branch of Zionist movement that I was part of was all involved in socialist bi-nationalism, and Arab-Jewish cooperation, and all sorts of nice stuff. (Whistle blows) BARSAMIAN: What did they think of you hopping on a train, going up to New York, and hanging out at anarchist book stores on Fourth Avenue, and talking to. CHOMSKY: They didn't mind, because. I don't want to totally trust my childhood memories, obviously, but the family was split up. Like a lot of Jewish families, it went in all sorts of directions. There were sectors that were super-Orthodox. There were other sectors that were very radical, and very assimilated, and working-class intellectuals, and that's the sector that I naturally gravitated towards. It was a very lively intellectual culture. For one thing, it was a working-class culture, had working-class values. Values of solidarity, socialist values, and so on. There was a sense somehow things would get better. An institutional structure was around, a method of fighting, of organising, of doing things which had some hope. And I also had the advantage of having gone to an experimental progressive school, to a Deweyite school which was quite good, run by a university there, and you know, there was no such thing as competition. There was no such thing as being a good student. Literally, the concept of being a good student didn't even arise until I got to high school. I went to the academic high school, and suddenly discovered I'm a good student. I hated high school, because I had to do all the things you have to do to get into college. But until then, it was kind of a free, pretty open system, and lots of other things as well. Maybe I was just cantankerous. As a historian, I have read with interest and amazement your long review article of Gabriel Jackson's Spanish Civil War. It's a very respectable piece of history. I appreciate how much work goes into it. You know when I did that work? I did that work in the early 1940s when I was about 12 years old. CHOMSKY: The first article I wrote was right ater the fall of Barcelona in the school paper, and it was a lament about the rise of Fascism in 1939. I guess one of the people who was the biggest influence in my life was an uncle who had never gone past fourth grade, had a background in crime, and let-wing politics, and all sorts of things. But he was a hunchback, and as a result he could get a newsstand in New York. They had some programme for people with physical disabilities. Some of you are from New York, I guess. Well, you know the 72nd Street kiosk? WOMAN: Yes! CHOMSKY: That's where I got my political education. At 72nd Street - where you come out of the subway, everybody goes towards 72nd Street. There were two newsstands on that side which were doing fine, and there's two on the back. Nobody comes out the back, and that's where his newsstand. (Laughter) But it was a very lively place. He was a very bright guy. It was the '30s. There were a lot of émigrés. A lot of people were hanging around there, and in the evenings especially it was sort of a literary-political salon. There were, kind of, guys hanging around arguing and talking, and. as a kid, like 11, 12 years old, the biggest excitement was to work the newsstand. You write in Manufacturing Consent that it's the primary function of the mass media in the United States to mobilise public support for the special interests that dominate the government and the private sector. What are those interests? Well, if you want to understand the way any society works, ours or any other, the first place to look is who makes. who is in a position to make the decisions that determine the way the society functions. Societies differ, but in ours the major decisions over what happens in the society - decisions over investment, and production, and distribution and so on - are in the hands of a relatively concentrated network of major corporations and conglomerates, and investment firms, and so on. They are also the ones who staff the major executive positions in the government, and they are the ones who own the media, and they are the ones who have to be in a position to make the decisions. They have an overwhelmingly dominant role in the way life happens, you know, what's done in the society. Within the economic system, by law and in principle, they dominate. The control over resources, and the need to satisfy their interests imposes very sharp constraints on the political system and the ideological system. When we talk about manufacturing of consent, whose consent is being manufactured? To start with, there are two different groups. We can get into more detail, but at the first level of approximation, there's two targets for propaganda. One is what is sometimes called the political class. There's maybe 20 per cent of the population which is relatively educated, more or less articulate. They'll play some kind of role in decision making. They're supposed to sort of participate in social life, either as managers, or cultural managers, like, say, teachers, and writers, and so on. They're supposed to vote. They're supposed to play some role in the way economic and political and cultural life goes on. Now, their consent is crucial. That's one group that has to be deeply indoctrinated. Then there's maybe 80 per cent of the population whose main function is to follow orders, and not to think, you know. Not to pay attention to anything, and they're the ones who usually pay the costs. LINVILLE: All right, Professor Chomsky, Noam, you outlined a model - filters propaganda is sent through on its way to the public. Will you briefly outline those? CHOMSKY: It's basically an institutional analysis of the major media, what we call a propaganda model. We're talking primarily about the national media, those media that set a general agenda that others more or less adhere to, to the extent that they even pay much attention to national or international affairs. Now, the elite media are the sort of agenda-setting media. The New York Times, The Washington Post, the major television channels, and so on. They set the general framework. Local media more or less adapt to their structure. (Phone rings) World news. DIRECTOR: It's a sound bite, that says there's a beach head. I think 628 is a good one. This is the operative sound bite for us. Got a minute for all the times. I love this sound bite. CHOMSKY: And they do this in all sorts of ways, by. FLOOR DIRECTOR: Two and a half minutes to air. 45 seconds. There is an unusual amount of attention today on the five nations of Central America. NARRATOR: This is democracy's diary. Here, for our instruction, are triumphs and disasters, the pattern of life's changing fabric. Here is great journalism, a revelation of the past, a guide to the present, and a clue to the future. (Growls) The New York Times is certainly the most important newspaper in the United States, and one could argue, the most important newspaper in the world. The New York Times plays an enormous role in shaping the perception of the current world on the part of the politically active, educated classes. Also, The New York Times has a special role, and I believe its editors probably feel that they bear a heavy burden in the sense that The New York Times creates history. NARRATOR: What happened years ago may have a bearing on what happens tomorrow. Millions of clippings are preserved in the Times'library, all indexed for instant use. A priceless archive of events, and the men who make them. CHOMSKY: That is, history is what appears in The New York Times archives. The place where people will go to find out what happened is The New York Times. Therefore it's extremely important, if history is to be shaped in an appropriate way, that certain things appear, certain things do not, certain questions be asked, others be ignored, and that issues be framed in a particular fashion. Now, in whose interests is history being so shaped? Well, I think that's not very difficult to answer. MEYER: The process by which people make up their minds on this is a much more mysterious process than you would ever guess from reading Manufacturing Consent. There is a saying about legislation, that legislation is like making sausage. The less you know about how it's done, the better for your appetite. The same is true of this business. If you're in a conference in which decisions are being made on what to put on page one, or what not, you would get, I think, the impression that important decisions were being made in a flippant and frivolous way, but in fact, given the pressures of time to try to get things out, you resort to a kind of a shorthand, and you have to fill that paper up every day. It's curious in a kind of a mirror image way that Professor Chomsky is in total accord with Reed Irvine who at the right-wing end of the spectrum says exactly what Chomsky does about the insinuating influence of the press, of the big media as "agenda setters", to use one of the great buzz words of the time, and, of course, Reed Irvine sees this as a let-wing conspiracy, of foisting liberal ideas in both domestic and foreign affairs on the American people. But in both cases, I think that the premise really is an insult to the intelligence of the people who consume news. Now, to eliminate confusion, all of this has nothing to do with liberal or conservative bias. According to the propaganda model, both liberal and conservative wings of the media, whatever those terms are supposed to mean, fall within the same framework of assumptions. In fact, if the system functions well, it ought to have a liberal bias, or at least appear to, because if it appears to have a liberal bias, that will serve to bound thought even more effectively. In other words, if the press is indeed adversarial and liberal, and all these bad things, then how can I go beyond it? They're already so extreme in their opposition to power that to go beyond it would be to take off from the planet, so therefore it must be that the presuppositions that are accepted in the liberal media are sacrosanct. Can't go beyond them. And a well-functioning system would in fact have a bias of that kind. The media would then serve to say, in effect: Thus far and no further. We ask what would you expect of those media on just relatively uncontroversial, guided-free market assumptions? And when you look at them, you find a number of major factors entering into determining what their products are. These are what we call the filters - so one of them, for example, is ownership. Who owns them? CHOMSKY: The major agenda-setting media, ater all, what are they? As institutions in the society, what are they? Well, in the first place they are major corporations. In fact, huge corporations. Furthermore, they're integrated with, and sometimes owned by, even larger corporations, conglomerates, so, for example, by Westinghouse, GE and so on. STUDENT: What I wanted to know was how specifically the elites control the media. That's like asking, "How do the elites control General Motors"? Why isn't that a question? I mean, General Motors is an institution of the elites. They don't have to control it. They own it. Except I guess, at a certain level I think. Like, I guess. I work with student press, so I know, like, reporters and stuff. Elites don't control the student press, but I'll tell you something - you try in the student press to do anything that breaks out of conventions, and you're going to have the whole business community around here down on your neck, and the university's going to get threatened, and you know. Maybe nobody'll pay any attention to you. That's possible. If you get to the point where they don't stop paying attention to you, the pressures'll start coming. Because there are people with power, there are people who own the country, and they're not going to let the country get out of control. What do you think about that? This is the old cabal theory that somewhere there's a room with a baize-covered desk, and there are a bunch of capitalists sitting around pulling strings. These rooms don't exist. I hate to tell Noam Chomsky this. - You don't share that view? - It's the most absolute rubbish I've ever heard. It's the fashion in the universities. It's patent nonsense, and I think it's nothing but a fashion. It's a way that. intellectuals have of. of feeling like a clergy. There has to be something wrong. CHOMSKY: So, what we have in the first place is major corporations which are parts of even bigger conglomerates. Now, like any other corporation, they. they have a product which they sell to a market. The market is advertisers, that is, other businesses. What keeps the media functioning is not the audience. They make money from their advertisers, and remember, we're talking about the elite media, so they're trying to sell a good product, a product which raises advertising rates. And ask your friends in the advertising industry. That means that they want to adjust their audience to the more elite and affluent audience. That raises advertising rates. So what you have is institutions, corporations - big corporations - that are selling relatively privileged audiences to other businesses. CHOMSKY: Well, what point of view would you expect to come out of this? Without any further assumptions, what you'd predict is that what comes out is a picture of the world, a perception of the world, that satisfies the needs, and the interests, and the perceptions of the sellers, the buyers, and the product. Now, there are many other factors that press in the same direction. If people try to enter the system who don't have that point of view, they're likely to be excluded somewhere along the way. Ater all, no institution is going to happily design a mechanism to self-destruct. That's not the way institutions function, so they all work to exclude, or marginalise, or eliminate dissenting voices, or alternative perspectives and so on because they're dysfunctional. They're dysfunctional to the institution itself. Do you think you've escaped the ideological indoctrination of the media and society that you grew up in? Have I? Oten not. I mean, when I look back, and think of the things that I haven't done that I should have done, it's. it's very. it's. not a pleasant experience. BARSAMIAN: So, what's the story of young Noam in the school yard? Yeah, another. I mean, that was a personal thing for me. I don't know why it should interest anyone else, but I do remember. - You drew certain conclusions. - It had a big influence on me. I remember when I was about six, I guess, first grade, there was the standard fat kid who everybody made fun of, and I remember in the school yard, he was on a. you know, standing right outside the school classroom, and a bunch of kids outside sort of taunting him, and. you know, and so on, and one of the kids actually brought over his older brother from third grade instead of first grade. Big kid. And he was going to beat him up or something, and I remember going up to stand next to him, feeling somebody ought to. help him, and I did for a while, and then I got scared, and I went away, and I was very much ashamed of it aterwards, and sort of felt, you know. "I'm not going to do that again." That's a feeling that's stuck with me - you should stick with the underdog. And the shame remained. I should have stayed there. You were already established, you were a professor at MIT, you'd made a reputation, you had a terrific career ahead of you. You decided to become a political activist. Now, here is a classic case of somebody the institution does not seem to have filtered out. I mean, you were a good boy up until then, were you? Or you'd always been a slight rebel? CHOMSKY: Pretty much. I had been pretty much outside. STEINBERG: You felt isolated and out of sympathy with the currents of American life, but a lot of people do that. Suddenly, in 1964, you decide, "I have to do something about this". What made you do that? CHOMSKY: That was a very conscious, and a very uncomfortable, decision, because I knew what the consequences would be. I was in a very favourable position. I had the kind of work I liked, we had a lively, exciting department, the field was going well, personal life was fine, I was living in a nice place, children growing up. Everything looked perfect, and I knew I was giving it up, and at that time, remember, it was not just giving talks. I became involved right away in resistance, and I expected to spend years in jail, and came very close to it. In fact, my wife went back to graduate school in part as we assumed she would have to support the children. These were the expectations. And I recognised that if I returned to these interests which were the dominant interests of my own youth, life would become very uncomfortable. Because I know that in the United States you don't get sent to psychiatric prison, and they don't send a death squad ater you and so on, but there are definite penalties for breaking the rules. So these were real decisions, and it simply seemed at that point that it was just hopelessly immoral not to. I'm Noam Chomsky, I'm on the faculty at MIT, and I've been getting more and more heavily involved in anti-war activities for the last few years. Beginning with writing articles, and making speeches, speaking to congressmen and that sort of thing, and gradually getting involved more and more directly in resistance activities of various sorts. I've come to the feeling myself that the most effective form of political action that is open to a responsible and concerned citizen at the moment is action that really involves direct resistance, refusal to take part in what I think are war crimes, to raise the domestic cost of American aggression overseas through non-participation, and support for those who are refusing to take part, in particular, drat resistance throughout the country. I think that we can see quite clearly some very, very serious defects and flaws in our society, our level of culture, our institutions which are going to have to be corrected by operating outside of the framework that is commonly accepted. I think we're going to have to find new ways of political action. (Commotion) (Whistle blows) I rejoice in your disposition to argue the Vietnam question, especially when I recognise what an act of self-control this must involve. CHOMSKY: It really does. - You're doing very well. - You're doing very well. - I lose my temper. Maybe not tonight. Maybe not tonight. because if you would I'd smash you in the goddamn face. That's a good reason for not losing your temper. You say, "The war is simply an obscenity, a depraved act by weak and miserable men." Including all of us. Including myself. That's the next sentence. Oh, sure, sure, sure. Because you count everybody in the company of the guilty. - I think that's true in this case. - It's a theological observation. No, I don't think so. If everybody's guilty of everything, then nobody's guilty of anything. No, I don't believe that. I think the point that I'm trying to make, and I think ought to be made, is that the real. at least to me - I say this elsewhere in the book - what seems to me a very, in a sense, terrifying aspect of our society and other societies is the equanimity and the detachment with which sane, reasonable, sensible people can observe such events. I think that's more terrifying than the occasional Hitler or LeMay that crops up. These people would not be able to operate were it not for the. this apathy and equanimity, and therefore I think that it's in some sense the sane, and reasonable, and tolerant people who share a very serious burden of guilt that they very easily throw on the shoulders of others who seem more extreme and more violent. 12 million pounds of confetti dropped into New York City's so-called Canyon of Heroes. Americans were officially welcoming the troops home from the Persian Gulf war. MAN: It worked out really great for us. It just goes to show that we're a mighty nation, and we'll be there no matter what comes along. It's the strongest country in the world, and you got to be glad to live here. ASAIS: So, tell me what you feel about media coverage of the war. It was good. It got to be a bit much ater a while, but I guess it was good to know everything. In Vietnam you didn't know a lot that was going on, but here you're pretty much up to the moment on everything, so. I guess it was good to be informed. For the first time, because of technology, we have the ability to be live from many locations around the globe, and because of the format - an all-news network - we can spend whatever time is necessary to bring the viewer the complete context of that day's portion of the story. And by context, I mean the institutional memory that is critical to understand why and how, and that's those who are analysts, and do commentary, and those who can explain. MAN: Slug that last piece lTN-lsrael Post War. TURNER: David Brinkley once said that you step in front of the camera, and you get out of news business, and into show business, but nonetheless that should not in any way subtract or obscure the need for the basic standards of good journalism. PRODUCER: Hang tight. Let me give you a lead for Salinger right now, OK? President Bush and Prime Minister Major have closed, or have almost rejected. the Soviet peace talk. peace efforts in Saudi Arabia. The door is being let open. Rick Salinger is standing by live in Riyad. - All but closed. - Yeah. All but closed. Right. TURNER: Accuracy, speed, a fair approach, honesty and integrity within the reporter to try and bring the truth, whatever the truth may be. Going to war is a serious business. In a totalitarian society, the dictator just says, "We're going to war", and everybody marches. NARRATOR: And with this weapon of human brotherhood in our hands we are seeing the war for men's minds not as a battle of truth against lies, but as a lasting alliance pledged in faith with all those millions driving forward to create the true new order- the world order of the people first, the people before all. CHOMSKY: In a democratic society, the theory is, if the political leadership is committed to war they present reasons, and they've got a very heavy burden of proof to meet. Because a war is a very catastrophic affair, as it's been proved to be. Now, the role of the media at that point is to. is to present the relevant background. For example, the possibilities of peaceful settlement, such as what they may be, have to be presented, and then to offer a forum. in fact encourage a forum of debate over this very dread decision to go to war, and in this case kill hundreds of thousands of people, and leave two countries wrecked, and so on. That never happened. There was never. Well, you know, when I say never, I mean 99.9 per cent of the discussion excluded the option of a peaceful settlement. NARRATOR: To Washington's Office of War Information falls one of the most vital and constructive tasks of this war. This is a people's war, and to win it, the people ought to know as much about it as they can. This office will do its best to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, both at home and abroad. NARRATOR: The first weapon in this worldwide strategy of proof is the great machine of information represented by the free press with its powers of moulding public thought, and leading public action, with all its lifelines for the exchange of new ideas between fighting nations spread across the earth. CHOMSKY: Every time Bush would appear and say, "There will be no negotiations", there would be a hundred editorials the next day lauding him for going the last mile for diplomacy. If he said, "You can't reward an aggressor", instead of cracking up in ridicule the way people did in civilised sectors of the world like the whole Third World, the media still. "man of fantastic principle", you know. The invader of Panama, the only head of state who stands condemned for aggression in the world, the guy who was head of the CIA during the Timor aggression, he says, "Aggressors can't be rewarded", the media just applaud it. VOICEOVER: The motion picture industry with its worldwide organisation of newsreel crews, invaluable for bringing into vivid focus the background drama and perspectives of the war. Mobilised too in this all-out struggle for men's minds are the radio networks, with all their experience in the swift reporting of great occasions and events. From every strategic centre and frontline stronghold their reporters are sending back the lessons of new tactics, new ways of war. CHOMSKY: The result was it's a media war. There's tremendous fakery all along the line. The UN is finally living up to its mission. "A wondrous sea change", The New York Times told us. The only wondrous sea change was that for once the United States didn't veto a Security Council Resolution against aggression. People don't want a war unless you have to have one, and would've known you don't have to have one. The media kept people from knowing that, and that means we went to war very much in the manner of a totalitarian state, thanks to the media subservience. That's the big story. (Cheering) Now, remember I'm not talking about a small radio station in Laramie. I'm talking about the national agenda-setting media. If you run a radio news show in Laramie, chances are very strong that you pick up what was in The Times that morning, and you decide that's the news. In fact, if you follow the AP wires, you find it in the aternoon. They send across tomorrow's front page of The New York Times. That's so that everybody knows what the news is. The perceptions and perspectives and so on are sort of transmitted down, not to the precise detail, but the general picture is pretty much transmitted elsewhere. The foreign news comes here to the Foreign News desk. The editor is Bob Hanley. Bob, I suppose you get far more foreign news than you can possibly use in the paper. Yes, we do. We get a great deal more than we can accommodate in a day. Your job is to weed it out, I suppose. This is the selection centre, as it were, and when I have selected it I pass it across the desk to one or the other of the sub-editors. It comes back to me, and on this chart I design the page. That is page one and page two. Fine, Bob. Thank you very much. (Bell rings) - Why do you want to make a film about Media? WINTONICK: Well. Such a nice, quiet town. WINTONICK: It's a beautiful town. We're making a film about the mass media, so we thought what a good place to come. Want to know where they got the name? WINTONICK: Maybe you could start by introducing yourself. Yes, I'm Bodhon Senkow. I'm the main street manager and executive director of the Media Business Authority, and we are in Media, Delaware County, in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania. Media is called "Everybody's hometown". The motto was developed as a way to promote the community. We're a very high promotion-conscious community. When you walk through Media, you'll be treated very well, and you find that people have taken the idea of being everybody's hometown to heart. WINTONICK: The local paper, The Talk of the Town. The Town Talk. - Do you read that? - Yes, I read The Town Talk. What do you think the difference is between The Wall Street Journal and The Talk? Well, I mean, The Town Talk is completely local news, and it's fun, it's nice to read, it's interesting. You read about your neighbours, see what's going on in the district, and things like that. BERMAN: We're in business to make bucks, just like the big daily newspapers, and like the big radio stations, and we do quite well, and rightfully so, cos we work very hard at it. I just wanna show you a copy of the paper here, the way it is this week. It's plastic-wrapped on all four sides. Weatherproof, and hung on everybody's front door. And many times you'll find this paper runs well over 100 pages a week. You have to remember there are five editions. This happens to be the Central Delaware County edition, which is the edition that covers Media, Pennsylvania. What you see here is the advertising and composition department. - Say hello, guys, will you? ALL: Hi. And what we're doing now is we're putting red dots, green dots, and yellow dots up on the map wherever there is a store. The red dots are the stores that don't advertise with us at all. The green dots are the ones that advertise with us every week, and the yellow dots are the ones that run sporadically. Now, we have computer print-outs of every one of these stores, and what we do is we take the print-outs of all the red dots which are the bad guys, and our idea is to turn these red dots into yellow dots, and turn the yellow dots into green dots, and eventually make them all green dots, so 100 per cent of the stores and 100 per cent of the merchants and service people advertise in our paper every week. That way, we won't have any more red dots. I guess there'll always be a few, but I have high hopes there'll be a lot more green ones than red when we're finished. Hi, I'm Jim Morgan. I'm with the Corporate Relations Department of The New York Times, and I'm here to take you on a tour of The New York Times, so. let's begin. MORGAN: So, they're just taking audio in here, yeah. They're taking audio in here. Audio. No cameras, no still. We went over this quite thoroughly. They don't even take a still camera in here. We're in the composing room. This is where the pages are composed. This is the typographical area. This might seem big, but it is average. In fact, below average. Our 60 per cent might include on some days maybe. 20 pages of classified advertising all to itself, where the rest of the newspaper is weighted much heavier news to advertising, but the paper in its entirety every day, large or small, is 60 ads, 40 news. Well, that completes our tour of The New York Times, and I hope you found it informative, and I hope that you read The New York Times every day of your life from now on. CHOMSKY: There are other media too whose basic social role is quite different. It's diversion. There's the real mass media, the kinds that are aimed at the guys who. Joe Six-pack. That kind. The purpose of those media is just to dull people's brains. This is an over-simplification, but for the 80 per cent or whatever they are, the main thing for them is to divert them, to get them to watch National Football League, and to worry about the. you know. mother with child with six heads, or whatever you pick up in the. you know. in the thing that you pick up on the supermarket stands, and so on. Or, you know, look at astrology, or get involved in fundamentalist stuff, or something. Just get them away, you know. Get them away from things that matter. And for that, it's important to reduce their capacity to think. NARRATOR: The sports section is handled in another special department. The sports reporter must be a specialist in his knowledge of sports. He gets his story right at the sporting event, and often sends it in to his paper play by play. CHOMSKY: Sports. That's another crucial example of the indoctrination system in my view. For one thing, because it. you know, it offers people something to pay attention to that's of no importance. - That keeps them from worrying about. (Applause) .keeps them from worrying about things that matter to their lives they might have some idea about doing something about. And in fact, it's striking to see the intelligence that's used by ordinary people in sports. You listen to radio stations where people call in. They have the most exotic information and understanding about all kinds of arcane issues, and the press undoubtedly does a lot with this. I remember in high school - I was pretty old - I suddenly asked myself at one point, "Why do I care if my high school team wins the football game?" I mean, I don't know anybody on the team, you know. (Laughter) It had nothing to do with me. I mean, why am I cheering for my team? It doesn't make any sense. But the point is, it does make sense. It's a way of building up irrational attitudes of submission to authority, and, you know, group cohesion behind. you know, leadership elements. In fact, it's training in irrational jingoism. That's also a feature of competitive sports. I think. If you look closely at these things, I think, typically, they do have functions, and that's why energy is devoted to supporting them, and creating a basis for them, and advertisers are willing to pay for them. WINTONICK: I'd like to ask you a question about the methodology and study in the propaganda model, and how would one go about doing that? Well, there are a number of ways to proceed. One obvious way is to try to find more or less paired examples. History doesn't offer true controlled experiments, but it oten comes pretty close. So one can find atrocities or abuses of one sort that on the one hand are committed by official enemies, and on the other hand are committed by friends and allies, or by the favoured state itself. By the United States, in the US' case. The question is whether the media accept the government framework, or whether they use the same agenda, same set of questions, the same criteria for dealing with the two cases as any honest outside observer would do. ANNOUNCER: If you think America's involvement in the war in Southeast Asia is over, think again. MAN: The Khmer Rouge are the most genocidal people on the face of the earth. Peter Jennings Reporting From The Killing Fields. Thursday. I mean, the great act of genocide in the modern period is Pol Pot. 1975 to. through 1978. That atrocity. I think it would be hard to find any example of a comparable outrage and outpouring of fury, and so on and so forth, so that's one atrocity. It just happens that in that case, history did set up a controlled experiment. ASAIS: Ever heard of a place called East Timor? - I can't say that I have. - Where? - East Timor. - No. Well, it happens that right at that time there was another atrocity. Very similar in character, but differing in one respect - we were responsible for it, not Pol Pot. Hello. I'm Louise Penney, and this is Radio Noon. If you've been listening to the programme fairly regularly over the last few months, you'll know East Timor has come into the conversation more than once, particularly when we were talking about foreign aid, and also the war, and a new world order. People wondered why, if the UN was serious about a new world order, no-one was doing anything to help East Timor. The area was invaded by Indonesia in 1975. There are reports of atrocities against the Timorese people, and yet Canada and other nations have consistently voted against UN Resolutions to end the occupation. Today, we're going to take a closer look at East Timor, what's happened to it, and why the international community is doing nothing to help. One of the people who have been most active is Elaine Briére, a photojournalist from British Columbia. She's the founder of the East Timor Alert Network, and she joins me in the studio now. - Hello. - Hi. One tragedy compounding a tragedy is that a lot of people don't know much about East Timor. - Where is it? - East Timor is just north of Australia. About 420 km, and it's right between the Indian and Pacific oceans. Just south of East Timor is a deep-water sea lane perfect for US submarines to pass through. There's also huge oil reserves there. One of the unique things about East Timor is that it's truly one of the last surviving ancient civilisations in that part of the world. The Timorese spoke 30 different languages and dialects amongst a group of 700,000 people. Today less than five per cent of the world's people live like the East Timorese. Basically self-reliant, they live really outside of the global economic system. Small societies like the East Timorese are much more democratic and much more egalitarian, and there's much more sharing of power and wealth. Before the Indonesians invaded, most people lived in small rural villages. The old people in the village were like the university. They passed on tribal wisdom from generation to generation. Children grew up in a safe, stimulating, nurturing environment. A year ater I let East Timor, I was appalled when I heard Indonesia had invaded. It didn't want a small, independent country setting an example for the region. CHOMSKY: East Timor was a Portuguese colony. Indonesia had no claim to it, and in fact stated that they had no claim to it. During the period of colonisation, there was a good deal of politicisation that different groups developed. A civil war broke out in August '75. (Machine-gun fire) It ended up in a victory for Fretilin, which was one of the groupings, described as populist Catholic in character, with some typical letist rhetoric. (Car horn beeps) Indonesia at once started intervening. SHACKLETON: What's the situation? When did those ships come in? RAMOS-HORTA: They start arriving since Monday. Six, seven boats together, very close to our border. They're not there just for fun. They're preparing a massive operation. SHACKLETON: Something happened here last night that moved us very deeply. It was so far outside our experience as Australians that we'll find it very difficult to convey to you, but we'll try. Sitting on woven mats under a thatched roof in a hut with no walls we were the target of a barrage of questioning from men who know they may die tomorrow, and cannot understand why the rest of the world does not care. That's all they want - for the United Nations to care about what is happening here. The emotion here last night was so strong that we, all three of us, felt we should be able to reach out into the warm night air and touch it. Greg Shackleton, at an unnamed village which we will remember forever in Portuguese Timor. (Gun cocked and fired) (Continued gunfire) Ford and Kissinger visited Jakarta, I think it was December 5th. We know that they had requested that Indonesia delay the invasion until ater they let because it would be too embarrassing. And within hours, I think, ater they let, the invasion took place on December 7th. What happened on December 7th in 1975, is just one of the great evil deeds of history. Early in the morning bombs begin dropping on Dili. The number of troops that invaded Dili that day almost outnumbered the entire population of the town. And for two or three weeks, they just killed people. (Speaks Portuguese) This Council must consider Indonesian aggression against East Timor as the main issue of the discussion. CHOMSKY: When the Indonesians invaded, the UN reacted as it always does, calling for sanctions and condemnation and so on. Various watered-down resolutions were passed, but the US were very clearly not going to allow anything to work. So the Timorese were fleeing into the jungles by the thousands. By late 1977, '78 Indonesia set up receiving centres for those Timorese who came out of the jungle waving white flags. Those the Indonesians thought more educated, or suspected of belonging to Fretilin or other opposition parties were immediately killed. They took women aside, and flew them off to Dili in helicopters for use by the Indonesian soldiers. They killed children and babies. But in those days their main strategy and their main weapon was starvation. CHOMSKY: By 1978, it was approaching really genocidal levels. The church and other sources estimated about 200,000 people killed. The US backed it all the way. The US provided 90 per cent of the arms. Right ater the invasion, arms shipments were stepped up. When the Indonesians actually began to run out of arms in 1978, the Carter administration moved in and increased arms sales, and other western countries did the same. Canada, England. Holland. Everybody who could make a buck was in there, trying to make sure they could kill more Timorese. There is no western concern for issues of aggression, atrocities, human rights abuses and so on if there's a profit to be made from them. Nothing could show it more clearly than this case. It wasn't that nobody had heard of East Timor. Remember there was plenty of coverage in The New York Times and elsewhere before the invasion. The reason was there was concern over the break-up of the Portuguese empire and what that would mean. There was fear it would lead to independence, or Russian influence, or whatever. Ater the Indonesians invaded, the coverage dropped. There was some, but it was strictly from the point of view of the State Department and Indonesian generals. Never a Timorese refugee. As the atrocities reached their maximum peak in 1978, when it really was becoming genocidal, coverage dropped to zero in the United States and Canada, the two countries I've looked at closely. Literally dropped to zero. All this was going on at exactly the same time as the great protest of outrage over Cambodia. The level of atrocities was comparable. In relative terms it was probably considerably higher in Timor. It turns out that right in Cambodia in the preceding years, 1970 through 1975, there was also a comparable atrocity for which we were responsible. The major US attack against Cambodia started with the bombings of the early 1970s. They reached a peak in 1973, and they continued up till 1975. They were directed against inner Cambodia. Very little is known about them, because the media wanted it to be secret. They knew it was going on. They just didn't want to know what was happening. The CIA estimates about 600,000 killed during that five-year period, which is mostly either US bombing, or a US-sponsored war. So that's pretty significant killing. Also, the conditions in which it let Cambodia were such that high US officials predicted that about a million people would die in the atermath just from hunger and disease because of the wreckage of the country. Pretty good evidence from US government and scholarly sources that the intense bombardment was a significant force - maybe a critical force - in building up peasant support for the Khmer Rouge who were a pretty marginal element. Well, that's just the wrong story. Ater 1975, atrocities continued, and that became the right story - now they're being carried out by the bad guys. Well, it was bad enough. In fact, current estimates are. well, they vary. The CIA claim 50,000 to 100,000 people killed, and maybe another million or so who died one way or another. Michael Vickery is the one person who's given a really close, detailed analysis. His figure is maybe 750,000 deaths above the normal. Others like Ben Kiernan suggest higher figures, but so far without a detailed analysis. Anyway, it was terrible. No doubt about it. Although the atrocities - the real atrocities - were bad enough, they weren't quite good enough for the purposes needed. Within a few weeks ater the Khmer Rouge takeover, The New York Times was already accusing them of genocide. At that point, maybe a couple of hundred or a few thousand people had been killed. And from then on, it was a drum beat, a chorus of genocide. The big bestseller on Cambodia and Pol Pot is called Murder of a Gentle Land. Up until April 17th, 1975, it was a gentle land of peaceful, smiling people, and ater that some horrible holocaust took place. Very quickly, a figure of two million killed was hit upon. In fact, what was claimed was that the Khmer Rouge boast of having murdered two million people. Facts are very dramatic. In the case of atrocities committed by the official enemy, extraordinary show of outrage, exaggeration, no evidence required. Faked photographs are fine, anything goes. Also a vast amount of lying. I mean, an amount of lying that would have made Stalin cringe. It was fraudulent, and we know that it was fraudulent by looking at the response to comparable atrocities for which the United States was responsible. Early '70s Cambodia, and Timor too - very closely paired examples. Well, the media response was quite dramatic. (Typewriter ribbon being turned) (Typing) (Typewriter pings) (Ribbon turns) (Typing) MEYER: Back in 1980, I taught a course at Tuts University. Well, Chomsky came around to this class, and he made a very powerful case that the press underplayed the fact that the Indonesian government annexed this former Portuguese colony in 1975, and that if you compare it for example with Cambodia where there was acreage of things, this was a communist atrocity, whereas the other was not a communist atrocity. Well, I got quite interested in this, and I went to talk to the then deputy foreign editor of The Times, and I said, "You know, we've had very poor coverage on this". He said, "You're right. There are a dozen atrocities around the world we don't cover. This is one for various reasons", so I took it up. I was working as a reporter and writer for a small alternative radio programme in upstate New York, and we received audio tapes of interviews with Timorese leaders, and we were quite surprised that given the level of American involvement that there was not more coverage, indeed practically any coverage, of the large-scale Indonesian killing in the mainstream American media. We formed a small group of people to try to monitor the situation and see what we could do over time to alert public opinion to what was actually happening in East Timor. There were literally about half a dozen people who simply dedicated themselves with great commitment to getting this story to break through. And they reached a couple of people in Congress. They got to me, for example. I was able to testify at the UN and write some things. They kept at it, kept at it, kept at it. Whatever is known about the subject mainly. essentially comes from their work. There's not much else. I wrote first an editorial called An Unjust War in East Timor. It had a map, and it said exactly what had happened. We then ran a dozen other editorials on it. They were read, entered in the Congressional Record, several Congressmen took up the cause, and something was done in Congress as a result. KOHEN: The fact the editorial page of The New York Times on Christmas Eve published that editorial put our work on a very different level, and it gave a great deal of legitimacy to something that we were trying to. advance for a long time, and that was the idea and the reality that a major tragedy was unfolding in East Timor. If one takes literally various. theories that Professor Chomsky puts out, one would feel that there is a tacit conspiracy between the establishment press and the government in Washington to focus on certain things, and ignore certain things. So that if we broke the rules that we would instantly get a reaction, a sharp reaction from the overlords in Washington who would say, "Hey, what are you doing speaking up on East Timor? We're trying to keep that quiet". We didn't hear a thing. What we did hear, and this was quite interesting, is that there was a guy named Arnold Kohen, and he became a one-person lobby. I appreciate the nice things that Karl Meyer said about me in his interview, but I object to the notion that a one-man lobby was formed, or anything like that. I think that if there weren't a large network composed of the American Catholic Bishops' Conference, composed of other church groups, human rights groups, composed of simply concerned citizens, and others, and a network of concern within the news media, I think it would have been impossible to do anything at all at any time, and it would have been impossible to sustain things for as long as they've been sustained. MEYER: Professor Chomsky and many people who engage in this kind of press analysis have one thing in common - most of them have never worked for a newspaper, many of them know very little about how newspapers work. When Chomsky came around, he had with him a file of all the coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other papers of East Timor, and he would go to the meticulous degree that if, for example, The London Times had a piece on East Timor, and then it appeared in The New York Times, that if a paragraph was cut out, he'd compare, and he'd say, "Look - this key paragraph right near the end which is what tells the whole story was let out of The New York Times' version of the London Times' thing." CHOMSKY: There was a story in The London Times which was pretty accurate. The New York Times revised it radically. They didn't just leave a paragraph out. They revised it, and gave it a totally different cast. It was then picked up by Newsweek, giving it The New York Times' cast. It ended up being a whitewash, whereas the original was an atrocity story. So, I said to Chomsky at the time, "Well, it may be that you're misinterpreting ignorance, haste, deadline pressure, etcetera, for some kind of determined effort to suppress an element of the story." He said, "Well, if it happened once, or twice, or three times I might agree with you, but if it happens a dozen times, Mr Meyer, I think there's something else at work". It's not a matter of happening one time, two, five, a hundred. It happened all the time. I said, "Professor Chomsky, having been in this business, it happens a dozen times. These are very imperfect institutions". When they did give coverage, it was from the point of view of. it was a whitewash of the United States. Now, you know, that's not an error. That's systematic, consistent behaviour, in this case without even any exception. This is a much more subtle process than you get in the kind of sledgehammer rhetoric of the people that make an A to B equation between what the government does, what people think, and what newspapers say. That. That sometimes what The Times does can make an enormous difference. At other times, it has no influence whatsoever. So. one of the greatest tragedies of our age is still happening in East Timor. The Indonesians have killed up to a third of the population. They're in concentration camps. They conduct large-scale military campaigns against the people who are resisting, campaigns with names like Operation Eradicate, or Operation Clean Sweep. Timorese women are subjected to a forced birth control programme, in addition to bringing in a constant stream of Indonesian settlers to take over the land. Whenever people are brave enough to take to the streets in demonstrations or show the least sign of resistance, they just massacre them. It's sort of like Indonesia, if we allow them to continue to stay in East Timor - the international community - they will simply digest East Timor and turn it into. they're trying to turn it into cash crop. I mean, this is way beyond just demonstrating this subservience of the media to power. I mean, they have real complicity in genocide in this case. The reason that the atrocities can go on is because nobody knows about them. If anyone knew about them, there'd be protests and pressure to stop them. So therefore, by suppressing the facts, the media are making a major contribution to some of. probably the worst act of genocide since the Holocaust. FRUM: You say that what the media do is to ignore certain kinds of atrocities that are committed by us and our friends, and to play up enormously atrocities that are committed by them and our enemies. And you posit that there's a test of integrity and moral honesty which is to have a kind of equality of treatment of corpses. I mean, every dead person should be in principle equal to every other dead person. CHOMSKY: That's not what I say. - I'm glad it's not, because it's not what you do. Of course it's not what I do. Nor would I say it. In fact, I say the opposite. What I say is we should be responsible for our own actions primarily. Because your method is not only to ignore the corpses created by them, but also to ignore corpses that are created by neither side, that are irrelevant to your ideological agenda. - That's totally untrue. - Let me give you an example. Um. one of your own causes that you take very seriously is the cause of the Palestinians. And a Palestinian corpse weighs very heavily on your conscience, and yet a Kurdish corpse does not. That's not true at all. I've been involved in Kurdish support groups for years. That's. It's simply false. Just ask the Kurdish. Ask the people who are involved in. You know, they come to me, I sign their petitions, and so on and so forth. If you look at the things we've written. Let's take a look. I'm not Amnesty International. I can't do everything. I'm a single human person. But if you read. Take a look, say, at the book that Edward Herman and I wrote on this topic. In it we discuss three kinds of atrocities - what we call benign bloodbaths, which nobody cares about, constructive bloodbaths, which are the ones we like, and nefarious bloodbaths, which are the ones the bad guys do. The principle that I think we ought to follow is not the one that you stated. You know, it's a very simple, ethical point. You're responsible for the predictable consequences of your actions. You're not responsible for the predictable consequences of somebody else's actions. The most important thing for me and for you is to think about the consequences of your actions. What can you affect? These are the things to keep in mind. These are not just academic exercises. We're not analysing the media on Mars, or in the 18th Century, or something like that. We're dealing with real human beings who are suffering, and dying, and being tortured, and starving because of policies that we are involved in. We as citizens of democratic societies are directly involved in and are responsible for, and what the media are doing is ensuring that we do not act on our responsibilities, and that the interests of power are served, not the needs of the suffering people, and not even the needs of the American people who would be horrified if they realised the blood that's dripping from their hands because of the way they're allowing themselves to be deluded and manipulated by the system. What about the Third World? Well, despite everything, and it's pretty ugly and awful, these struggles are not over. The struggle for freedom and independence never is completely over. Their courage, in fact, is really remarkable. Amazing. I've personally had the privilege, and it is a privilege, of witnessing it a few times, in villages in Southeast Asia and Central America, and recently in the occupied West Bank, and it is astonishing to see. And it's always amazing - at least to me it's amazing. I can't understand it. It's also very moving and inspiring. In fact, it's kind of awe-inspiring. Now, they rely very crucially on a very slim margin for survival that's provided by dissidence and turbulence within the imperial societies, and how large that margin is is for us to determine. In today's On The Spot assignment, we're going to see just what's behind the making of movies. The director and the crew are shooting a documentary film. Let's take a closer look. Bob, this word "documentary", what would you say is the difference between a documentary film and a feature movie? Well, there are a good many differences. One would be length. Generally speaking, documentaries are shorter than feature films. Also, documentaries have something to say in the way of a message. They are informational films. Also, another term that's used interchangeably with documentary is the word "actuality". PRESENTER: Bob, is this the thing you hold up in front of the camera before each scene? BOB: This is a clapperboard, yes. This identifies on the visual camera the scene number and the take number. And also, as you heard, on the soundtrack, the editor back at the studio puts the two pieces of film together, matches where the lips of the clapper meet, and there you are in synch. MILLER: Before the break, you were mentioning the media putting forth the information that the power elite want. I'm not sure if I understand. How does the power elite do this? Why do we stand for it? Why does it work so well? Well, I think. I mean, there are really two questions here. One - is this picture of the media true? And there, you have to look at the evidence. I've given one example, and that shouldn't convince anybody. One has to look at a lot of evidence to see whether this is true. I think anyone who investigates it will find out that the evidence to support it is simply overwhelming. It's probably one of the best supported conclusions in the social sciences. The other question is, how does it work? - Noam Chomsky? - I'm the. I'm the media guy. What would you like? I got you an International Herald Tribune. Anything in a Western language which doesn't include Dutch. What have you got? - Financial Times. - Financial Times, absolutely. That's the only paper that tells the truth. You get the one where they've been debating back and forth? NRC Handelsblad. CHOMSKY: Handelsblad? - Train to? - Ammerswurth. CHOMSKY: Well, this evening's programme is scheduled as a debate, which puzzled me all the way through. There are some problems. One problem is that no proposition has been set forth. As I understand "debate", people advocate or oppose something. Rather more sensibly, a topic has been proposed for discussion. Er. the topic is manufacture of consent. BOLKESTEIN: It's unusual for a member of the government to debate with a professor in public. It hasn't happened in Holland before. I don't think it oten happens elsewhere. (Bell) Mr Bolkestein, the floor is yours. BOLKESTEIN: Now, we all know that a theory can never be established merely by examples. It can only be established by showing some internal, inherent logic. Professor Chomsky has not done so. Professor Chomsky? CHOMSKY: He's right to say you can't just pick examples. You have to do them rationally. That's why we compared examples. The truth is that things are not as simple as Professor Chomsky maintains. Another of Professor Chomsky's case studies concerns the treatment that Cambodia has received in the Western press. Here, he goes badly off the rails. (Laughter) We didn't discuss Cambodia. We compared Cambodia with East Timor, two very closely paired examples. And we gave approximately 300 pages of detail covering this in Political Economy of Human Rights, including a reference to every article we could discover about Cambodia. BOLKESTEIN: Many Western intellectuals do not like to face the facts and balk at the conclusions that any untutored person would draw. Many people are very irritated by the fact that we exposed the extraordinary deceit over Cambodia and paired it with the simultaneous suppression of the US-supported, ongoing atrocities in Timor. People don't like that. For one thing, we were challenging the right to lie in defence of the state. For another thing, we were exposing the apologetics and support for actual ongoing atrocities. That doesn't make you popular. (Bell) BOLKESTEIN: Where did he learn about the atrocities in East Timor or in Central America, if not in the same free press which he so derides? You can find out where I learned about them by looking at my footnotes - from Human Rights reports, from church reports, from refugee studies, and extensively, from the Australian press. Nothing from the American press - it was silenced. Chairman, this is an attempt at intellectual intimidation. These are the ways of the bully. Professor Chomsky uses the oldest debating trick on record. He erects a man of straw and proceeds to hack away at him. (Bell) Professor Chomsky calls this the "manufacture of consent". I call it "the creation of consensus". In Holland, we call it "Draagvlak", which means "foundation". Professor Chomsky thinks it is deceitful. But it is not. In a representative democracy, it means winning people for one's point of view. But I do not think that Professor Chomsky believes in representative democracy. I think he believes in direct democracy. With Rosa Luxemburg, he longs for the creative, spontaneous, self-correcting force of mass action. That is the vision of the anarchist. It is also a boy's dream. (Ripple of laughter) Those who believe in democracy and freedom have a serious task ahead of them. What they should be doing, in my view, is dedicating their efforts to helping the despised common people to struggle for their rights and to realise the democratic goals that constantly surface throughout history. They should be serving not power and privilege but rather their victims. Freedom and democracy are, by now, not merely values to be treasured. They are quite possibly the prerequisite to survival. It's a conspiracy theory, pure and simple. It is not borne out by the facts. Mr Chairman, I have to go to Amsterdam. If you'll excuse me, I'm leaving. (Laughter) CHAIRMAN: One thing is sure. Their consent has not been manufactured tonight. CHOMSKY: There is nothing more remote from what I'm discussing than a conspiracy theory. If I give an analysis of, say, the economic system, and I point out that General Motors tries to maximise profit and market share, that's not a conspiracy theory. That's an institutional analysis. That has nothing to do with conspiracies. And that's precisely the sense in which we're talking about the media. The phrase "conspiracy theory" is one that's constantly brought up. And I think its effect, simply, is to discourage institutional analysis. WINTONICK: You think there's a connection about what the government wants us to know and what the media tell us? It's not Communism, but I think, to a certain point, it is sensitised. They don't always tell the truth, the way it goes, huh? You got that right. Do you think the information you're getting from this paper is biased in any way? Oh, yeah. I think, by and large, it's well done. You get both sides of the stories. You get the liberal side and the conservative side, so to speak. I don't think you get a very balanced picture because they only have 20 seconds for a news item, or whatever, and they're going to pick out, a highlight. Every network is going to cover the same highlight. And that's all you're going to see. You get what they want you to hear. You think they're biased in some way, then? Nah. Here we go. See you later. Is it possible for the lights to get a little brighter so I can see somebody out there? STUDENT: Yeah, for the last hour and 41 minutes, you've been whining about how the elite and how the government have been. using thought control to keep radicals like yourself out of the public limelight. Now, you're here. I don't see any CIA men waiting to drag you off. You were in the paper. That's where everyone here heard you were coming from, in the paper. I'm sure they're going to publish your comments in the paper. In a lot of countries, you would have been shot for what you have done today. So, what are you whining about? We are allowing you to speak. I don't see any thought control. CHOMSKY: First of all, I haven't said one word about my being kept out of the limelight. The way it works here is quite different. I don't think you heard what I was saying. The way it works here is, that there is a system of shaping and control, which gives a certain perception of the world. I gave one example. I'll give you sources where you can find thousands more. And it has nothing to do with me. It has to do with marginalising the public and ensuring that they don't get in the way of elites who are supposed to run things without interference. KLEINHAUS: In a review of The Chomsky Reader, it was written that, "As he's been forced to the margins, he's become strident and rigid." Do you feel this categorisation of your later writings is accurate and that you've been a victim of this sort of process you've been describing? Well, the business about being forced. Other people will have to judge about the stridency. I won't. I don't believe it. But that's for other people to judge. But the matter of being forced to the margins is one of fact. The fact is the opposite of what is claimed. The fact is, it's much easier to gain access to even the major media now than it was 20 years ago. MO YERS: You've dealt in such unpopular truths and have been such a lonely figure as a consequence of that. Do you ever regret either that you took the stand you took, have written the things you have written, or that we had listened to you earlier? Er. I don't. I mean, there are particular things which I would do differently. Because you think about things differently. - But, in general, I would say I do not regret it. - Do you like being controversial? No, it's a nuisance. Because this medium pays little attention to dissenters, not just Noam Chomsky, but most dissenters do not get much of a hearing in this medium. It's understandable. They wouldn't be performing their societal function if they allowed favoured truths to be challenged. CHOMSKY: Now, notice that's not true when I cross the border anywhere. So I have easy access to the media in just about every other country in the world. That's for a number of reasons. One is that I'm primarily talking about the US. And it's much less threatening. Your view there is that the militarisation of the American economy essentially has come about because there are not other means of controlling the US people. CHOMSKY: In a democratic society. It may be paradoxical, but the freer the society is, the more it's necessary to resort to devices like induced fear. OK, I'll go along with that. Arguably, he is the most important intellectual alive today. And if my programme can give him 500,000 people listening or three-quarters of a million people listening, I'll be delighted. OK, Professor, in your own time. Wartime planners understood that actual war aims should not be revealed. CHOMSKY: A part of the reason why the media in Canada and Belgium, etc are more open is that it just doesn't matter that much what people think. It matters very much what the politically articulate sectors of the population, those narrow minorities, think and do in the United States, because of its overwhelming dominance on the world scene. But that's also a reason for wanting to work here. .what we might call the fith freedom - the freedom to rob, exploit, and dominate and to curb mischief by any feasible means. It's "conclude", not "include". PRODUCER: From the top. CHOMSKY: The United States is ideologically narrower in general than other countries. Furthermore, the structure of the American media is such as to pretty much eliminate critical discussion. Our guests are as far apart on the Contra question as American intellectuals can be. CHOMSKY: If we had the slightest concern with democracy, which we do not, in our foreign affairs, and never have, we would turn to countries where we have influence like El Salvador. Now, in El Salvador, they don't call the Archbishop bad names. What they do is murder him. They do not censor the press. They wipe the press out. They sent the army in to blow up the church radio station. The editor of the independent paper was found in a ditch, mutilated, and cut to pieces. - Don't. - May I continue? I did not interrupt you. Don't you want to put a time value on anything you say or do you want to lie systematically on TV? - I'm talking about 1980. - You are a systematic liar. - Did these things happen or not? - Not in the context which you suggested. You are a phoney, mister, and it's time that the people read you correctly. It's clear why you want to divert me from the discussion. No, it's not. We're getting tired of rubbish. - But let's continue with. - Except we can't. We're out of time. Let me thank you, John Silver and Noam Chomsky. OK. STUDENT: Last time you were here, you spoke about how, when you go overseas, you are given access to the mass media. But here, that doesn't seem to be the case. Has that changed at all? Have you ever been invited to appear on Nightline or Brinkley? CHOMSKY: Yes, I have a couple of times been invited to speak on Nightline. I couldn't do it. I had another talk and something or other. To tell you the honest truth, I don't really care very much. FAIR, the media monitoring group, published a very interesting study of Nightline. It shows that their conception of a spectrum of opinion is ridiculously narrow, at least by European or world standards. Let me tell you a personal experience. I happened to be in Madison, Wisconsin, on a listener-supported radio station, a community radio station, a very good one. It was an interview with the news director. I'd been on the programme dozens of times, usually by telephone. And he's very good, he gets all sorts of people. He started the interview by playing for me a tape of an interview that he had just had and had broadcast with a guy who's. some mucky-muck in Nightline. I think his name is Jeff Greenfield or some such name. Does that name mean anything? I'm Jeff Greenfield from Nightline in New York. We've got just a selection of guests to analyse things. Why is Noam Chomsky never on Nightline? GREENFIELD: I couldn't begin to tell you. HANSEN: He's one of the world's leading intellectuals. GREENFIELD: I have no idea. I mean, I can make some guesses. He may be one of the leading intellectuals who can't talk on television. You know, that's a standard that's very important. To us. If you've got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up. Now, I don't know whether Chomsky does or not. .he's out. One of the reasons why Nightline has the usual suspects is, one thing you have to do when you book a show is know that the person can make the point within the framework of TV. If people don't like that, they should understand it is as sensible to book somebody who takes eight minutes to answer as it is to book somebody who doesn't speak English. In the normal given flow, that's another culture-bound thing. We've got to have English speakers and concision. So Greenfield or whatever his name is hit the nail on the head. The US media are alone in that you must meet the condition of concision. You've got to say things between two commercials or in 600 words. And that's a very important fact. Because the beauty of concision, you know, saying a couple of sentences between two commercials. The beauty of that is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. GREENFIELD: I was reading Chomsky 20 years ago. Didn't he co-author a book called Engineering Consent or Manufacturing Consent? I mean, some of that stuff, to me, looks like it's from Neptune. This is the first time the Neptune system has been seen clearly by human eyes. These pictures, taken only hours ago by Voyager-2, are its latest contribution. GREENFIELD: You know, he's perfectly entitled to say I'm seeing it through a prism, too. But my view of his notions about the limits of debate in this country is absolutely wacko. Suppose I get up on Nightline, say. And I'm given whatever it is, two minutes. And I say Gaddafi is a terrorist, Khomeini is a murderer, you know, etc, etc. The Russians, you know, invaded Afghanistan. All this sort of stuff. I don't need any evidence. Everybody just nods. On the other hand, suppose you say something that just isn't regurgitating conventional pieties. Suppose you say something that's the least bit unexpected or controversial. You say: The biggest international terror operations that are known are the ones that are run out of Washington. Or suppose you say: What happened in the 1980s is, the US government was driven underground. Suppose I say the United States is invading South Vietnam, as it was? The best political leaders are the ones who are lazy and corrupt. If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-War American President would have been hanged. The Bible is probably the most genocidal book in our total canon. Education is a system of imposed ignorance. There's no more morality in world affairs than there was in the time of Genghis Khan. There are just different. You know, there are just different factors to be concerned with. Noam Chomsky, thank you. Well, you know, people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean. "Why did you say that? I've never heard that before. If you said that, you'd better have a reason, better have some evidence. In fact, you'd better have a lot of evidence because that's a pretty startling comment". You can't give evidence if you're stuck with concision. That's the genius of this structural constraint. And in my view, if people like, say, Nightline, MacNeil, Lehrer and so on were smarter, if they were better propagandists, they would let dissidents on, let them on more, in fact. The reason is that they would sound like they were from Neptune. PRESENTER: Then our conversation on the Middle East crisis with the activist, writer and professor, Noam Chomsky. Again, there has been an offer on the table which we rejected, an Iraqi offer of last April. MACNEIL: OK, I have to to eliminate their chemical and other unconventional arsenals if Israel were to simultaneously do the same. - We have to end it there. - That should be pursued as well. Sorry to interrupt. I have to end it. That's the end of our time. Professor Chomsky, thanks. AT&T has supported the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour since 1983 because quality information and quality communication is our idea of a good connection. AT&T - the right choice. - Thank you. - Could you just sit there for half a second? It's just for a two-shot, that's all. Then we can do anything else with that. OK. Yeah, what about the mic? Is that a problem? OK, right. The idea of this one is it's just a shot where I'm seen talking to you. I'll ask you, though, not to speak to me or move your lips, so I can be seen to ask a question. The reason for the shot is simply this. OK, just don't talk to me and I'll keep going. The reason for the shot - I'll explain it because I find that's the easiest way to do it - is I need a shot where you're sitting and seeing and listening while I'm asking you a question. We can use the shot to introduce you, explain who you are, where you fit into my piece. But if you don't speak to me, I can also use. Got it? OK, thanks for your time. If there is a narrower range of opinion in the United States and it is harder to express a variety of different opinions, why do you live in the US? Well, first of all, it's my country, and secondly, it's in many ways - as I said before - it's the freest country in the world. I think there's more possibilities for change here than in any other country I know. But again, comparatively speaking, it's the country where the state is probably most restrictive. Isn't that what you should look at comparatively rather than in absolute terms? You don't give that impression. Maybe I don't give the impression. I say it oten enough. What I've said over and over again, I've said it tonight, I've written it a million times, is that the United States is a very free society. It's also a very rich society. Of course, the United States is a scandal from the point of view of its wealth. Given the natural advantages that the United States has, in terms of resources and lack of enemies and so on, the United States should have a level of health and welfare and so on that's, you know, on an order of magnitude beyond anybody else in the world. We don't. The United States is last among 20 industrialised societies in infant mortality. That's a scandal of American capitalism. And it ends up being a very free society which does a lot of rotten things in the world, OK? There's no contradiction there. Greece was a free society by the standards of Athens, you know. It was also a vicious society as regards its imperial behaviour. There's virtually no correlation - maybe none - between the internal freedom of a society and its external behaviour. You start your line of discussion at a moment that is historically useful for you. - But you picked the beginning. - The grand fact of the post-war world is that the Communist imperialists, by the use of terrorism, by the use of deprivation of freedom, have contributed to the continuing bloodshed. The sad thing about it is, not only the bloodshed, but the fact that they seem to dispossess you of the power of rational observation. I think that's about five per cent true. Or maybe ten per cent true. It certainly is true. - Why do you give that? - May I complete a sentence? It's perfectly true that there were areas of the world, in particular, Eastern Europe, where Stalinist imperialism. very brutally took control and still maintains control. But there are also very vast areas of the world where we were doing the same thing. And there's quite an interplay in the Cold War. What you just described is, I believe, a mythology about the Cold War. It may have been tenable ten years ago but it's inconsistent with contemporary scholarship. Ask a Czech. Ask a Guatemalan, ask a Dominican. Ask the president of the Dominican Republic, ask a person from South Vietnam, ask a Thai. Obviously, if you can't distinguish between the nature of our venture in Guatemala and the nature of the Soviet Union's in Prague, we have difficulties. (Doorbell sound) Er. now, what about making the media more responsive and democratic? Well, there are very narrow limits for that. It's kind of like asking, "How do we make corporations more democratic?" Well, the only way to do that is get rid of them. I mean, if you have concentrated power. I don't want to say you can do nothing. Like the church can show up at the stockholders' meeting and start screaming about not investing in South Africa. And sometimes that has marginal effects. I don't want to say it has no effect. But you can't really affect the structure of power. Because to do that would be a social revolution. Unless you're ready for a social revolution, that is, power is going to be somewhere else, the media are going to have their present structure and represent their present interests. That's not to say that one shouldn't try to do things. It makes sense to try to push the limits of a system. It only takes one or two people that think they have integrity as journalists to give you some good press. That's important. That goes back to something that came up before. There are contradictions. You know, things are complex. It's not monolithic. I mean, the mass media themselves are complicated institutions with internal contradictions. So, on the one hand, there's the commitment to indoctrination and control. But on the other hand, there's the sense of professional integrity. REPORTER: She works alone, as her own boss, writing newspaper columns and producing radio commentaries for a hodgepodge of small clients across the country. This so-called leather-lunged Texan has been firing questions at our chief executive for almost 40 years. Many a young man in this country is disillusioned by his government these days. Well, this is a question which you very properly bring to the attention of the nation. It's not that we haven't held press conferences. I was just waiting for Sarah to come back. Mr President, that's very nice of you and I appreciate it. Sir, I want to call your attention to a real problem we've got in this country today. REPORTER: The unique, terrifying McClendon questions reflect her desire to get information. MCCLENDON: I want to ask your new man what he feels. - Here. (Laughter) REPORTER: With enough know-how and persistence, she usually gets her man. MCCLENDON: What would you do if you were in a situation where you were trying to be an honest reporter and you were worried sick about your country and you saw how sick it was, and you were facing this weak White House and a weak Congress, as a reporter, what would you do? CHOMSKY: I think there are a lot of reporters who do a good job. I have a lot of friends in the press who I think do a terrific job. I know they are. They want to. Well, first of all, you have to understand what the system is. And smart reporters do understand what it is. You have to understand what the pressures and commitments are, what the barriers are and what the openings are. Right ater the Iran-Contra hearings, a lot of good reporters understood, "Things are going to be more open for a couple of months". So they rammed through stories they couldn't even talk about before. - And ater Watergate. - The same ater Watergate. Then it closes up again. Most people, I imagine, simply internalise the values. That's the easiest way and the most successful way. You just internalise the values and then you regard yourself, in a way correctly, as acting perfectly freely. All right, let's get to the White House now where I think veteran correspondent Frank Sesno can tell us a little bit about self-censorship. That internal guidance system's always going on, isn't it? - Is there any formal censorship there? - There's no self-censorship. If somebody tells me something, I'll pass it on, unless there's a particular, compelling reason not to. I can't deny that I'd like to have access to the Oval Office and all the same maps the President's looking at. But that's not possible, it's not realistic, and probably not desirable. Hello. How are you? Go and sit down there, please. Welcome to Holland. I'll introduce you first with a few lines. Professor Chomsky, Noam Chomsky. Chomsky has been called the Einstein of modern linguistics. The New York Times has said he's arguably the most important intellectual alive today. But his presence here has sparked a protest. This book has poisoned the world. All lies are in there. As the Vietnamese people, we come here to burn the book. He said that in Vietnam there is no violation of human rights and no crime in Cambodia - it's wrong. Chomsky using his profession, he using that to poison the world. And we come here to protest that. I don't mind the denunciations, frankly. I mind the lies. Intellectuals are very good at lying. They're professionals at it. Vilification is a wonderful technique. There's no way of responding. If somebody calls you an anti-Semite, what can you say? "I'm not an anti-Semite"? If somebody says, "You're a racist, you're a Nazi", you always lose. I mean, the person who throws the mud always wins, because there's no way of responding. Professor Chomsky seems to believe that the people he criticises fall into one of two classes - liars or dupes. Consider what happens when I discuss the case of Robert Faurisson. Let me recall the facts. - Let's not go into details. - The details happen to be important. Yes, but I have only one question for you. - Do the facts matter or don't they? - Of course. Well, let me tell you what the facts are. (Heckling) Faurisson says that the massacre of the Jews in the Holocaust is a historic lie. WOMAN: Can we have the next question? SPEAKER: No. No, this is an important one. It has a lot to do with the topic. WOMAN: Get off! REYNOLDS: Your views are very controversial. Perhaps one of the things that has been most controversial and you've been most strongly criticised for was your defence of a French intellectual who was suspended from his university post for contending that there were no Nazi death camps in World War II. FAURISSON: My name is Robert Faurisson. I am 60. I am a university professor in Lyons, France. Behind me, you may see the courthouse of Paris, Le Palais de Justice. In this place, I was convicted many times at the beginning of the '80s. I was charged by nine associations, mostly Jewish associations, for inciting hatred, racial hatred, for racial defamation, for damage by falsifying history. Professor Chomsky and a number of other intellectuals signed a petition in which Faurisson is called "a respected professor of literature who merely tried to make his findings public". Perhaps we can start with just the story of Robert Faurisson and your involvement. More than 500 people signed. Maybe 600. Mostly. universitaires. Scholars. And what happened to the other 499 of them? How come we only hear about Chomsky's signature? Well, I think it's because Chomsky has, in himself, a kind of political power. CHOMSKY: I signed a petition calling on the tribunal to defend his civil rights. At that point, the French press, which has no conception of freedom of speech, concluded that since I had called for his civil rights, I was therefore defending his thesis. Faurisson then published a book in which he tried to prove that the Nazi gas chambers never existed. What we deny is that there was an extermination programme and an extermination, actually. Especially in gas chambers or gas vans. BOLKESTEIN: The book contains a preface written by Professor Chomsky in which he calls Faurisson "a relatively apolitical sort of liberal". A Communist is a man, a Jew is a man, a Nazi is a man. I am a man. Are you a Nazi? I am not a Nazi. How would you describe yourself politically? Nothing. - The preface that you wrote. - No, that's not the preface that I wrote. Because I never wrote a preface and you know that I never wrote a preface. He's referring to a statement of mine on civil liberties which was added to a book in which Faurisson. (Heckling) - Excuse me. You're a linguist and the language you use has meaning! And when you describe Faurisson as an "apolitical liberal", or as someone whose views can be dignified by the words "findings" or "conclusions", that is a judgment and that is a favourable judgment of his views. On the contrary. - May I continue with the facts? - You can continue with the facts for hours. But there are a few facts that. Yeah, OK. Let's get to the so-called preface. I was then asked by the person who organised the petition to write a statement on freedom of speech. Just banal comments about freedom of speech, pointing out the difference between defending a person's right to express his views and defending the views expressed. So I did that. I wrote a rather banal statement called "Some Elementary Remarks on Freedom of Expression". And I told them, "Do what you like with it". So Pierre produced a book in which all the arguments of Faurisson were to be put in front of the court. And we thought it wise to use the text of Noam Chomsky as a kind of warning, a forward, to say that it was a matter of freedom of expression, freedom of thought, freedom of research. Why did you try at the last moment to get it back from the book? That's the one thing I'm sorry about. - But that's the real important thing. - No, it's not. You mean that I tried to retract it? - With that, you said it was wrong of you to do it. - No. Take a look at what I did. I wrote a letter, which was then published, in which I said, "Look, things have reached a point where the French intellectual community simply is incapable of understanding the issues. At this point, it's just going to confuse matters even more if my comments on freedom of speech are attached to a book which I didn't know existed. So, just to clarify things, you'd better separate them". Now, in retrospect, I shouldn't have done that. I should have just said, "Fine. Let it appear, because it ought to appear". But apart from that, I regard this as not only trivial, but as compared with other positions I've taken on freedom of speech, invisible. I do not think the state ought to have the right to determine historical truth and to punish people who deviate from it. I'm not willing to give the state that right, even if they. - Are you denying the gas chambers existed? - Of course not. I'm saying, if you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Goebbels was in favour of freedom of speech for views he liked, right? So was Stalin. If you're in favour of freedom of speech, that means you're in favour of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise. Otherwise you're not in favour of freedom of speech. There's two positions you can have on freedom of speech. You can decide which you want. With regard to my defence of the utterly offensive, the people who express utterly offensive views, I haven't the slightest doubt that every commissar says, "You're defending that person's views". No, I'm not. I'm defending his right to express them. The difference is crucial. And the difference has been understood outside of fascist circles since the 18th century. Is there anything like objectivity, scientific objectivity, reality? - As a scientist, where do you stand on this? - I'm not saying I defend the views. If somebody publishes a scientific article which I disagree with, I do not say the state ought to put him in jail, right? - But you don't have to support him. - I don't support him. .and say, "I support him just for the sake of anybody saying what they want". Suppose this guy is taken to court and charged with falsification? - Then I'll defend him. - But he wasn't taken to court. - Oh, you're wrong. - But when did you write the support? CHOMSKY: When he was brought to court. And, in fact, the only support that I gave him was to say he has a right of freedom of speech, period. OLMERT: There is no doubt in my mind that the example I gave about the story, that the Holocaust did not exist, is very, very typical. I'll give you another example of this. How much of the American press believes that Faurisson has anything to say? How much of the press in France. What percentage would you say? Is it higher than zero? Is it higher than zero? Have you ever seen anything in any newspaper or any journal saying that this man is anything other than a lunatic? I'll try to answer. - I just follow the case. - That's a simple question. I follow the case five or six years ago. I happened to see that Noam Chomsky was in for strong criticism even from some of his supporters for doing something which could be interpreted only in terms of a campaign against Israel. Going back years, I am absolutely certain that I've taken far more extreme positions on people who deny the Holocaust than you have. For example, you go back to my earliest articles and you will find that I say that even to enter into the arena of debate on the question of whether the Nazis carried out such atrocities is already to lose one's humanity. So I don't even think you ought to discuss the issue, if you want my opinion. But if anybody wants to refute Faurisson, there's certainly no difficulty in doing so. I'm not interested in freedom of speech and all that. I have to win. And that's the question. And I shall win. Cut. (Train's hooter) I'm just an ordinary mum who just thinks in terms of. I don't want to some day be holding my grandchildren and watching something horrible happen and feel like I didn't do anything. And I mean, it's obvious what you're doing. My question is, on a practical level, where do you see the most practical place to put your energy? Tonight, I feel I'm overwhelmed. I feel like it's too big, it's too much, to even make a dent in. CHOMSKY: The way things change is because lots of people are working all the time. You know, they're working in their communities, in their workplace or wherever they are. And they're building up the basis for popular movements which are going to make changes. That's the way everything has ever happened in history. Whether it was the end of slavery, whether it was the democratic revolutions, or anything you want, you name it, that's the way it worked. You get a very false picture of this from the history books. In the history books, there's a couple of leaders. You know, George Washington, or Martin Luther King or whatever. And I don't want to say those people are unimportant. Martin Luther King was important, but he was not the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King can appear in the history books cos lots of people whose names you will never know and whose names are all forgotten and who may have been killed and so on, were working down in the South. When you have active. activists, and people concerned and people devoting themselves and dedicating themselves to social change or issues or whatever, then people like me can appear. We can appear to be prominent. But that's only cos somebody else is doing the work. My work, whether it's giving hundreds of talks a year or spending 20 hours a week writing letters or writing books, is not directed to intellectuals and politicians. It's directed to what are called "ordinary people". What I expect from them is, in fact, exactly what they are. That they should try to understand the world and act in accordance with their decent impulses. And that they should try to improve the world. Many are willing to do that. But they have to understand. As far as I can see, in these things, I feel that I'm simply helping people develop courses of intellectual self-defence. What did you mean by that? What would such a course be? I don't mean go to school, because you'll not get it there. It means you have to develop an independent mind and work on it. That's extremely hard to do alone. The beauty of our system is it isolates everybody. Each person is sitting alone in front of the tube. It's very hard to have ideas or thoughts under those circumstances. You can't fight the world alone. Some people can, but it's pretty rare. The way to do it is through organisation. So courses of intellectual self-defence will have to be in the context of political and other organisation. And it makes sense, I think, to look at what the institutions are trying to do and to take that almost as a key. What they're trying to do is what we're trying to combat. If they're trying to keep people isolated and separate, and so on, then we'll try and do the opposite, bring them together. So, in your local community, you want to have sources of alternative action, people with parallel concerns, maybe differently focused, but, at the core, sort of similar values and a similar interest in helping people defend themselves against external power and taking control of their lives and reaching out your hand to people who need it. That's a common array of concerns. You can learn about your own values and you can figure out how to defend yourself in conjunction with others. Erm. are there one or two publications that I, as an average person, a biologist, can read to bypass this filter of our press? Now, if you ask, "What media can I turn to to get the right answers?" First of all, I wouldn't tell you that, because I don't think there's an answer. The right answers are what you decide are the right answers. Maybe everything I'm telling you is wrong. It could perfectly well be. I'm not God. But that's something for you to figure out. I can tell you what I think happens to be right. But there isn't any reason why you should pay any attention to it. What impact do you feel alternative media is currently having or could potentially have? I'm actually a little more interested in its potential. And just to define my terms, by alternative media, I'm referring to media that are or could be citizen-controlled as opposed to state or corporate-controlled. That's what's kept people together. To the extent that people are able to do something constructive, it's because they have some way of interacting. I've always felt it would be a very positive thing and it should be pushed as far as it can go. I think it's going to have a very hard time. There's just such a concentration of resources and power that alternative media, while extremely important, are going to have quite a battle. It's true there are things which are small successes. But it's because people have just been willing to put in an incredible effort. Like, say, take Z Magazine. I mean, that's a national magazine which literally has a staff of two and no resources. Tell us a little about Z Magazine, what it is and what makes it different. Go ahead. Go ahead? Thank you. ALBERT: We just wanted to do a magazine that would address all the sides of political life. Economics, race, gender, authority, political relations. And we wanted to do it in a way that would incorporate attention to how to not only understand what's going on, but how to make things better, what to aim for, and to provide, at the same time, humour, culture. A kind of magazine that people could relate to and get a lot out of and participate in. What we wanted to do, which we didn't think was provided by the existing magazines, was to give it a real activist slant. So that it could be very useful to the variety of movements in the country. We just felt there wasn't a magazine that reflected that, that inspired people, and that gave people a strategy and perhaps even a vision of how things could be better. CHOMSKY: South End Press has sort of made it. That is, they're surviving. It's a small collective, again with no resources. They've put out a lot of good books. But for a South End book to get reviewed is almost impossible. Editorially and business-wise, we make decisions based on a politics that no corporate publisher can really advocate because of their ties to corporate America. We can solicit manuscripts based on what we feel is the relevance for the movement. And we can make our business decisions based on whether we feel people can afford our books, whether we feel that a book might not make that much money but it needs to be out there, and maybe there is 1,000 people who would buy it. And those are criteria that we feel are very precious in this day of corporate mergers. And likewise, our structure about sharing work and continuing our training process as long as we're at the press. There are losses there in terms of productivity, but in terms of empowerment, all of us are then able to say. "My perspective is different from yours". Then all of our intelligence gets used in making those decisions, and not just whoever happens to have done it the longest, whoever happens to have graduated from the best schools in order to be the best editor, making all the decisions and only using his or her intelligence. Citizen-supported radio in the United States has undergone a remarkable growth in the last decade. It's perhaps the fastest-growing alternative media. There are many reasons for this. First and foremost is that it's enormously economical. It reaches communities that have not been served by community radio before. In Boulder, we see with someone like Noam Chomsky, who's been there, I believe, three times in the last six years, he has a tremendous audience. And KGNU is partly responsible for that. Because we play his tapes on a regular basis. We play his lectures and his interviews. So, when he does come to Boulder and people hear what he has to say, they're able to tune in, it's not something exotic or esoteric he's talking about. It's material that they're very familiar with. He's noted this, incidentally. CHOMSKY: If there's a listener-supported radio station, it means that people can get daily, every day, a different way of looking at the world. Not just what the corporate media want you to see, but a different picture, a different understanding. Not only can you hear it, but you can participate in it. You can add your own thoughts. You can learn something, and so on. Well, that's the way people become human. That's the way you become human participants in a social and political system. Hello, I'm Ed Robinson and this is non-corporate news. What is non-corporate news and why is it necessary? I didn't want to just show another film at a library or something. I wanted to make my own statement. I thought it'd be more fun to do. Perhaps I'd get others involved in a project. Besides showing a film, we could make a film or a video. The local cable station's hooked up to three communities - Lynn, Swampscott and Salem. So that's 30,000 people, or 30,000 homes. I'm not sure. But I'm sure. a lot of people see it and it'll be the kind of people who don't go out to see a film. It'll go right into their houses. So, if they're flipping through their channels, they might be able to get a completely new idea of the world. CHOMSKY: So there's kind of networks of co-operation developing. I mean, like here, for example. There's a collection of stuff from a friend of mine in Los Angeles who does careful monitoring of the whole press in Los Angeles and a lot of the British press, which he reads. And he does selections. So I don't have to read the movie reviews and the local gossip and all this kind of stuff. But I get the occasional nugget that sneaks through and that you find if you're carefully, intelligently and critically reviewing a wide range of press. There are a fair number of people who do this and we exchange information. We wrote this two-volume work. We saw one another for a couple of weeks when we were getting started. But then we wrote two volumes, essentially without seeing one another. Just by phone, by mail, and exchanging manuscripts. But this takes a lot of communication by mail. My Chomsky file is a couple of feet thick. The end result is that you do have access to resources in a way which I doubt that any national intelligence agency can duplicate, let alone scholarship. So there are ways of compensating for the absence of resources. People can do things. For example, I found out about the arms flow to Iran by reading transcripts of the BBC and by reading an interview somewhere with an Israeli ambassador in one city and reading something else in the Israeli press. OK, the information is there. But it's there to a fanatic. You know, somebody who wants to spend a substantial part of their time and energy exploring it and comparing today's lies with yesterday's leaks, and so on. That's a research job. And it just simply doesn't make any sense to ask the general population to dedicate themselves to this task on every issue. I'm not given to false modesty. There are things that I can do. I know that I can do them reasonably well, including analysis and, you know study, research. I know how to do that. I think I've a reasonable understanding of the way the world works, as much as anyone can. And that turns out to be a very useful resource for people who are doing active organising trying to engage themselves in a way which will make it a little bit of a better world. And if you can help in those things, or participate in them, well, that's rewarding. I wonder if you can envision a time when people like myself, and again, the naïve people of this world can again take pride in the United States? And is that even a healthy wish now? Because it's maybe this hunger for pride in our country that makes us more easily manipulated by the powers that you talk about. Er. I think you first of all have to ask what you mean by your country. Now, if you mean by "the country" the government, I don't think you can be proud of it and I don't think you could ever be proud of it. (Applause) - Or be proud of any government. It's not our government. And you shouldn't be. States are violent institutions. The government of any country, including ours, represents a domestic power structure and it's usually violent. States are violent to the extent that they're powerful. That's roughly accurate. You look at American history, it's nothing to write home about. Why are we here? We're here because some ten million native Americans were wiped out. That's not very pretty. Until the 1960s, it was still cowboys and Indians. In the 1970s, for the first time, really, it became possible, even for scholarship, to try to deal with the facts as they were. For example, to deal with the fact that the Native American population was far higher than had been claimed. Millions higher, maybe as many as ten million higher than was claimed. That they had an advanced civilisation, and that there was something akin to genocide that took place. Now, we went through 200 years of our history without facing that fact. One of the effects of the 1960s is it's possible to at least begin to come to think about the facts. Well, that's an advance. INTERVIEWER: Do you think that this activism 20 years ago has made a difference in how our society operates now? CHOMSKY: It has not changed the institutions in the way they function. But it has led to very significant cultural changes. Remember, these movements of the '60s expanded in the '70s and expanded further in the '80s. They reached into other parts of the society and different issues. A lot of things that seemed outrageous in the '60s are taken for granted today. So, for example, take the feminist movement, which barely began to exist in the '60s. Now it's part of general consciousness and awareness. The ecological movements began in the '70s. The Third World solidarity movements were very limited in the '60s. It was really Vietnam. And in the '60s also, it was a student movement, as you say. Now it's not. Now it's mainstream America. MO YERS: If there is more dissidence now than you can remember, why do you go on to write that the people feel isolated? Because I think much of the general population recognises that the organised institutions do not reflect their concerns and interests and needs. They do not feel that they participate meaningfully in the political system. They do not feel that the media are telling them the truth or even reflect their concerns. They go outside of the organised institutions to act. We see more of our elected leaders and know less of what they do. This medium does that. It's very striking. The Presidential elections are almost removed from the point where the public takes them seriously as involving a matter of choice. What do you think about what goes on in the White House? It's kept too private, I think. Yeah, they should come out and talk to the people. - Yeah. - Who should talk to the people? George Bush! Well, it means that the political system increasingly. increasingly functions without public input. It means, to an increasing extent, not only do people not ratify decisions presented to them, but they don't take the trouble of ratifying them. They assume that the decisions are going on independently of what they do in the poll booth. MO YERS: Ratification would be what? CHOMSKY: Ratification would mean there are two positions presented to me, the voter. I go into the polling booth and I push one or another button, depending on which of those positions I want. That's a very limited form of democracy. Really meaningful democracy would mean that I play a role in forming those decisions, in creating those positions. That would be real democracy. We're very far from that. We're even departing from a point where there is ratification. When you have stage-managed elections, with the public relations industry determining what words come out of people's mouth, candidates deciding what to say on the basis of tests that determine what the effect will be across the population, somehow people don't see how profoundly contemptuous that is of democracy. (Fanfare) The solemn moment is near. But first, the swearing-in of Dan Quayle. Please move to your seats. For the first time in this century, for the first time in perhaps all history, Man does not have to invent a system by which to live. We don't have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We don't have to wrest justice from the kings. We only have to summon it from within ourselves. This is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called Tomorrow. Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom. The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for men on Earth. Through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state. I've spoken of 1,000 points of light, of all the community organisations that are spread like stars throughout the nation doing good. To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow. - We will stay strong to protect the peace. (Whir of helicopter) The offered hand is a reluctant fist. America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle. We, as a people, have such a purpose today. It is. to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world. Referring back to your earlier comment about escaping from or doing away with capitalism, I was wondering what scheme, workable scheme, you would put in its place. Me? - Well, what I would. (Laughter) What would you suggest to others who might be in a position to set it up and get it going? Well, I mean, I think that what used to be called, centuries ago, wage slavery is intolerable. I don't think people ought to be forced to rent themselves in order to survive. I think that the economic institutions ought to be run democratically by their participants, by the communities in which they exist, and so on, and I think basically through various kinds of free association. Historically, have there been any sustained examples on any substantial scale of societies which approximated to the anarchist ideal? There are small societies, small in number, that have, I think, done so quite well. And there are a few examples of large-scale libertarian revolutions which were largely anarchist in their structure. As to the first, small societies, extending over a long period, I myself think the most dramatic example was perhaps the Israeli Kibbutzim, which, for a long period - it may or may not be true today - really were constructed on anarchist principles. That is, of direct worker control, integration of agriculture, industry, service, personal life, on an egalitarian basis with direct and quite active participation in self-management, and were, I should think, extraordinarily successful. A good example of a really large-scale anarchist revolution, or largely anarchist revolution, the best example to my knowledge, is the Spanish Revolution in 1936. In fact, you can't tell what would have happened. That anarchist revolution was simply destroyed by force. But during the period in which it was alive, I think it was an inspiring testimony to the ability of poor working people to organise and manage their affairs extremely successfully, without coercion or control. How far does the success of libertarian socialism or anarchism as a way of life really depend on a fundamental change in the nature of man, both in his motivation, his altruism, and also in his knowledge and sophistication? I think it not only depends on it but, in fact, the whole purpose of libertarian socialism is that it will contribute to it. It will contribute to a spiritual transformation. Precisely that kind of great transformation in the way humans conceive of themselves and their ability to act, to decide, to create, to produce, to enquire. Precisely that spiritual transformation that. social thinkers from the Let-Marxist tradition, from Luxemburg, say, on over through anarcho-syndicalists, have emphasised. So, on the one hand, it requires that spiritual transformation. But also, its purpose is to create institutions which will contribute to that transformation. INTERVIEWER: You've written that, in looking at contributions of gited thinkers, one must make sure to understand their contributions, but also to eliminate the errors in them. And, of your ideas, what would you guess would be discarded and what would be assimilated by future thinkers? Well, I would assume virtually everything would be discarded. For example. Here, we have to distinguish. The work that I do in my professional area. If I still believed what I believed ten years ago, I'd assume the field is dead. So I assume, next time you read a student's paper, you're going to see something that has to be changed and you continue to make progress. In dealing with social and political issues, in my view, what is at all understood is pretty straightforward. There may be deep and complicated things. But, if so, they're not understood. The basic. To the extent that we understand society at all, it's pretty straightforward. And I don't think those simple understandings are likely to undergo much change. The point is that you have to work. That's why the propaganda system is so successful. Very few people are going to have the time or the energy or the commitment to carry out the constant battle that's required to get outside of, you know. MacNeil/Lehrer or Dan Rather, somebody like that. The easy thing to do. You come home from work, you're tired, have had a busy day. You're not going to spend the evening carrying out a research project. So you turn on the tube and say it's probably right. You look at the headlines in the paper and then you watch the sports. And that's basically the way the system of indoctrination works. Sure, the other stuff is there, but you're going to have to work to find it. Modern industrial civilisation has developed within a certain system of convenient myths. The driving force of modern industrial civilisation has been individual material gain, which is accepted as legitimate, even praiseworthy, on the grounds that private vices yield public benefits in the classic formulation. Now, it's long been understood very well that a society that is based on this principle will destroy itself in time. It can only persist with whatever suffering and injustice it entails, as long as it's possible to pretend that the destructive forces that humans create are limited, that the world is an infinite resource and that the world is an infinite garbage can. At this stage of history, either one of two things is possible. Either the general population will take control of its own destiny and will concern itself with community interests, guided by values of solidarity and sympathy and concern for others. Or, alternatively, there will be no destiny for anyone to control. As long as some specialised class is in a position of authority, it is going to set policy in the special interests that it serves. But the conditions of survival, let alone justice, require rational social planning in the interests of the community as a whole. By now, that means the global community. The question is whether privileged elites should dominate mass communication and should use this power as they tell us they must - namely, to impose necessary illusions, to manipulate and deceive the "stupid majority", and remove them from the public arena. The question, in brief, is whether democracy and freedom are values to be preserved or threats to be avoided. In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than values to be treasured. They may well be essential to survival. Thank you. (Applause) METCALF: He's up there thinking for himself. And he's deciphering this tremendously overweighted body of information, which he puts into an order and gives you the feeling that you can do the same thing, that the whole thing is decipherable. And he also gives you the sense that there is a source, there is a centre to the to a dissenting population, although we feel that there's no centre. And I think that is what reactivated in me a desire to get back. get reacquainted with the political scene ater 30 years of alienation from it. You do hundreds of interviews and lectures. And you're dealing with massacres in East Timor and invasions of Panama, etc. Pretty horrific stuff- death squads. What keeps you going? Don't you get burned out on this material? It's mainly a matter of whether you can look yourself in the mirror, I think. GUARD: Got to go, - get these people into town. - Maybe you could say, "All aboard", for us? All aboard! Bye-bye! Bye! (Beep) No, couldn't see it! Just hit the microphone. Thank you. Goodbye, Canada. Goodbye, Canada. Bye! I think I've gone past the hour that you agreed to. In your introduction, you said that he's from Harvard. Oh, I heard that. Oh, yes, that is true. We'll bleep it. Sorry about making you answer that in such a short time! It worked. Did we hit it in two minutes? Well, we did pretty well, actually. That means less sports and that's fine with me. The people don't know what's going on. If the people knew what you say here today, they'd happily change. Thank you. On that optimistic note, Professor Chomsky, thank you very much indeed. So, how did it go? I thought it was sort of technical-sounding. But. There wasn't much of a rhythm. - Did you ever think of running for President? (Laughter) If I ran for President, the first thing I'd do is tell people not to vote for me. This guy's got to go home, he really does. And people still believe the politics of the world changes. - Why don't you let him go home? - Thanks.

I can say that, clearly, the basis of the National Socialist State. is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code. And <i>for us our highest leader</i> <i>is also the highest judge.!</i> We know how sacred the principles of these laws are to our Führer. These Reich laws can assure you, National Comrades. that your life and existence <i>is safe</i> in <i>this</i> National Socialist State of Order, Freedom and Law. <i>Dr. Josef Goebbels, Reich Minister</i> <i>of People Enlightenment and Propaganda,</i> <i>Gauleiter of Berlin.</i> <i>and later</i> <i>General Plenipotentiary for Total War</i> May the bright flame of our enthusiasm never be extinguished. It alone gives light and warmth. to the creative art of modern political propaganda. This comes from the depths of the People. and from these depths of the people. it must always again find its roots and its strength.

For the first time you are presented for review in this forum. before me and before the German people. You represent a great idea. and we know that for millions of our national comrades. physical labor will not longer be a divisive concept. But it will instead bind us together and, furthermore. no longer will it be the case in Germany. that physical labor will be seen as anything less. than any other work. The whole nation passes through your school. The time will come when no German. can be admitted into the community of the people. until he has first become a member of <i>your</i> group. And you know that today you are not only being seen. by the thousands in Nuremberg, but by all of Germany. which also sees you here for the first time today. And I know that just as you serve this Germany proudly. all of Germany today will see its sons marching in you with proud joy! <i>Viktor Lutze, S.A.

The young generation of our people follows after you. Just as you demonstrate the highest self-sacrifice in this Nation. so does this youth wish to be selfless. Because you embody the concept of fidelity for us. therefore we wish to be faithful. Adolf Hitler, the Leader of German Youth, attention! My German youth. After one year I can greet you again here. You standing here today represent something. that is happening all over Germany. And we want that you, German boys and girls. will absorb everything that we wish for Germany. We want to be one people. and through you, to become this people. We want a society with neither castes nor ranks. And you must not allow these ideas to grow within you. We want to see <i>one Reich.!</i> And you must educate yourselves for this. We want this people to be obedient. and you must practice obedience in yourselves. We want this people to be <i>peace-loving.</i> but at the same time <i>to be courageous.</i> And you must, for that reason, be both <i>peace-loving.</i> You must be both <i>peace-loving</i> and strong. We want this people not to become soft. but to become hard and, therefore. you must steel yourselves for this in your youth. You must learn sacrifice. and also never to collapse. Whatever we create today. whatever we do. will all pass away. but in you Germany will live on. And when we can no longer hold. the flag <i>that we tore from nothing.</i> you must hold it firmly in your fists! And I know that it cannot be any other way. as we bind ourselves together. For you are <i>flesh of our flesh</i> <i>and blood from our blood.!</i> The same spirit that governs us. burns in your young minds.

They are not here at the summons of their hearts alone. but also at the summons of their loyalty. It was the great calamity of our people that drove us to the struggle. brought us together. and left us greater. Those who do not understand. have not experienced the same calamities among their people. These things appear enigmatic and mysterious. that hundreds of thousands would be led to assemble. amidst calamity and passion. Others cannot understand. that this is not an order of the <i>State.!</i> <i>They are deceiving themselves.!</i> <i>The State does not order us.!</i> <i>We order the State.!</i> <i>The State did not create us.!</i> <i>Rather we created our own State.!</i> No, the movement lives. and it is grounded hard and fast.

Then drum will join drum. flag will join flag. group will join group, Gau to Gau. and after that, this earlier divided people. will follow these sacred columns of the Nation. It would be an outrage if we were to lose. what we have fought for. with so much labor, so much worry. so much sacrifice, and so many privations. One cannot live faithfully and give up. what has given meaning and purpose to one's entire life. That would not be so. if it were not a cardinal command.

They who would believe that a rift has opened in the unity of the Movement. deceive themselves. <i>It stands fast as this block here.</i> and nothing in Germany will break it. And when anyone does harm to the spirit of <i>my</i> SA. then the SA will not be harmed. but those who do this harm. will injure only themselves! And only a fool or a known liar. could think. that I would ever disband an organization. that took us so many years to build.

What appeared like a show of political strength. for millions of Germans outside of our ranks. For hundreds of thousands of fighters. it was ultimately more. The great personal and spiritual meeting. of the old fighters and comrades in struggle. And, perhaps, a cross section of you. despite the forced civility of this review of our Party. will return with courageous hearts to the days in which it was difficult to be a National Socialist. When our Party consisted of only <i>seven</i> members. it already had two principles. <i>First</i>, it would be a Party with a true ideology. And <i>second</i>, it would be, uncompromisingly. <i>the one and only power in Germany.</i> We had to remain in the minority, because we mobilized. the most valuable elements of struggle and sacrifice in the Nation. which have always been not in the majority, but rather in the minority. And because these are the racially best of the German nation. they can in the proudest self-esteem. claim the leadership of the Reich and the people. The German people. and subordinated itself to this leadership in ever-growing numbers! The German people is happy. in the knowledge that a constantly changing vision. has been replaced by a <i>fixed pole.!</i> Whoever feels that he is the carrier of the best blood. and knowingly uses it to attain the leadership. will never relinquish it! <i>Ludwig Müller, Reichsbischof</i> <i>(Reich Bishop of the United</i> <i>German Evangelist Church)</i> There is always a part of the people who stand out as really active fighters. and more is expected from them than from the millions of national comrades in the general population. For them it is not simply enough to make the pledge: <i>"I believe.!"</i> Rather, the affirmation: <i>"I fight.!"</i> For all time to come the Party will be the source of political leadership for the German people. It will in its teaching. and was ultimately in its organization hard as steel. malleable in its tactics and adaptable in its entirety: yet it will be a training school like a <i>holy order</i> for political leaders. It must be shown, however, that <i>all upstanding Germans</i> <i>become Nationalist Socialists.</i> Only <i>the best Nationalist Socialists,</i> <i>however, are Party Comrades.!</i> Once, our enemies worried us and persecuted us and, from time to time. removed the lesser elements from the Movement <i>for</i> us. <i>Today</i> we must examine ourselves and remove from our midst the elements that have become bad. <i>And therefore, do not belong with us.!</i> It is our wish and will. that this State and this Reich last for thousand years. <i>We can be happy to know</i> <i>that this future belongs entirely to us.!</i> <i>When the older ones among us falter.</i> <i>the youth will stiffen</i> <i>and remain until their bodies decay.</i> Only then, if we in the Party with our most obedient dedication. become the highest embodiment of National Socialist thought and being. then the Party will materialize. into <i>an eternal and indestructible</i> <i>pillar</i> of the German people and Reich. Then our <i>glorious</i> and laudable Army. the old, proud, standard bearers of our people. who are equally tradition minded. will champion the Political Leadership and the Party. And then these two institutions will equally educate the German man. and, therefore, strengthen and carry on their shoulders. <i>the German State, the German Reich.!</i> At this hour, tens of thousands of our Party Comrades are already leaving the City. While many of them relive the meeting in their memories. still others are already planning the next review. And again the people come and go and they will be engrossed anew and happy. and inspired, for the idea and the Movement live on in our people. and with the Movement are symbol of eternity! <i>Long live</i> <i>the National Socialist Movement.!</i> <i>Long live Germany.!</i> <i>Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess</i> <i>at the Podium</i> <i>The Party is Hitler.!</i> <i>But Hitler is Germany,</i> <i>as Germany is Hitler.!</i> Hitler: Hail Victory! Hail Victory! <i>"The Horst Wessel Song"</i> the NSDAP hymn and unofficial German National Anthem after <i>Deutschland Über Alles.</i> <i>Raise the banner</i> <i>The columns are closed tightly</i> <i>The SA marches</i> <i>with a peaceful strong step</i> <i>Comrades shot by the Red Front</i> <i>and the Reactionaries</i> <i>March in spirit together</i> <i>in our columns</i> <i>Comrades shot by the Red Front</i> <i>and the Reactionaries</i> <i>march in spirit together</i> <i>in our columns</i> <i>- I'm giving you a choice:</i> <i>- Either put on these glasses or start eating that trashcan.</i> I already am eating from the trashcan all the time. The name of this trashcan is ideology. The material force of ideology - makes me not see what I'm effectively eating. It's not only our reality which enslaves us. The tragedy of our predicament - when we are within ideology, is that - when we think that we escape it into our dreams - at that point we are within ideology. 'They Live' from 1988 is definitely one of the - forgotten masterpieces of the Hollywood left. It tells the story of John Nada. 'Nada' of course is Spanish means 'nothing'. A pure subject, deprived of all substantial content. A homeless worker in L.A. who, drifting around - one day enters into an abandoned church - and finds there a strange box full of sunglasses. And when he put one of them on walking along the L.A. streets - he discovers something weird; That these glasses function like critique-of-ideology glasses. They allow you to see the real message beneath - all the propaganda, publicity glitz, posters and so on. You see a large publicity board telling you - have your holiday of a lifetime - and when you put the glasses on - you just see just on the white background a gray inscription. We live, so we are told, in a post-ideological society. We are interpolated, that is to say - addressed by social authority - not as subjects who should do their duty, sacrifice themselves - but subjects of pleasures. Realise your true potential. Be yourself. Lead a satisfying life. When you put the glasses on - you see dictatorship in democracy. It's the invisible order which sustains your apparent freedom. The explanation for the existence of these strange ideology glasses - is the standard story of the 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. Humanity is already under the control of aliens. <i>- Hey buddy!</i> <i>You gonna pay for that or what?</i> <i>- Look buddy, I don't want no hassle today.</i> <i>- Either pay for it or put it back.</i> According to our common sense - we think that ideology is something blurring, confusing - our straight view. Ideology should be glasses which distort our view - and the critique of ideology should be the opposite - like, you take off the glasses so that you can finally see - the way things really are. This precisely, and here the pessimism of - the film, of 'They Live' - is well justified, this precisely is the ultimate illusion: Ideology is not simply imposed on ourselves Ideology is our spontaneous relationship to our social world - how we perceive each meaning and so on and so on. We in a way enjoy our ideology. <i>- Alright.</i> To step out of ideology - it hurts. It's a painful experience. you must force yourself to do it. This is rendered in a wonderful way with - a further scene in the film - where John Nada tries to force his best friend, John Armitage - to also put the glasses on. <i>- I don't want to fight you. - Come on!</i> <i>- I don't want to fight you. - Come on!</i> <i>- Stop it! - No!</i> And it's the weirdest scene in the film. The fight takes eight, nine minutes. <i>- Put on the glasses!</i> It may appear irrational because why does this guy - reject so violently to put the glasses on? It is as if he is well aware that spontaneously he lives - in a lie. That the glasses will make him see the truth - but that this truth can be painful. Can shatter many of your illusions. This is a paradox we have to accept. <i>- Put the glasses on! Put 'em on!</i> The extreme violence of liberation. You must be forced to be free. If you trust simply your spontaneous sense of - well-being or whatever - you will never get free. <i>- Look!</i> Freedom hurts. The basic insight of psychoanalysis - is to distinguish between enjoyment and simple pleasures. They are not the same. Enjoyment is precisely enjoyment in disturbed pleasure - even enjoyment in pain. And this excessive factor disturbs the apparently simple - relationship between duty and pleasures. This is also a space where ideology up to - and especially religious ideology, operates. This brings me to maybe my favourite example - the great classical Hollywood film 'The Sound of Music'. We all know it's the story of a nun who is too alive - with too much energy - ultimately sexual energy, to be constrained to the role of a nun. <i>- Oh, Reverend Mother. I'm so sorry. I just couldn't -</i> <i>help myself. The gates we're open and</i> <i>the hills were beckoning</i> <i>and before I.</i> <i>- Maria, I haven't summoned you here for apologies.</i> <i>- Oh, please mother do let me ask for forgiveness.</i> <i>- One, two three. One, two, three.</i> <i>- One, two, three. Step together. Now.</i> So, Mother Superior sends her to the Von Trapp family - where she takes care of the children - <i>- Under.</i> <i>- Kurt, we'll have to practice. - Do allow me will you?</i> and at the same time, of course, falls in love - with the baron Von Trapp. And Maria gets too disturbed by it - cannot control it, returns to the convent - <i>- Oh there were times when we would look at each other.</i> <i>- Oh, Mother, I could hardly breathe.</i> <i>- Did you let him see how you felt?</i> <i>- If I did I didn't know it. That's what's been -</i> <i>torturing me, I was there on God's errand.</i> No wonder that in old communist Yugoslavia - where I saw this film for the first time - exactly this scene, or more precisely - the song which follows this strange hedonist, if you want, - advice from the mother superior: "Go back, seduce the guy, follow this path" - "do not betray your desire." Namely the song which begins with "Climb every mountain"; The song which is an almost embarrassing display - and affirmation of desire. This three minutes were censored. <i>- Climb every mountain.</i> <i>- Search high and low.</i> <i>- Follow every by-way</i> <i>- Every path you know.</i> I think the sensor was a very intelligent man. He knew, as probably an atheist communist, - where the power of attraction of catholic religion resides. <i>- 'Till you find your dream.</i> If you read intelligent catholic propagandists - and if you really try to discern what deal are they offering you? It's not to prohibit, in this case sexual pleasures. It's a much more cynical contract, as it were, - between the church as an institution and the believer - troubled with, in this case, sexual desires. It is this hidden obscene permission that you get - You are covered by the divine 'Big Other' - you can do what ever you want. Enjoy. <i>- A dream that will need.</i> This obscene contract does not belong - to Christianity as such. It belongs to catholic church as an institution. It is the logic of institution at its purest. <i>- Climb every mountain.</i> This is again a key to the functioning of ideology. Not only the explicit message: renounce, suffer and so on - but the true hidden message: Pretend to renounce and you can get it all. My psychoanalytic friends are telling me that typically today - patients who come to the analyst to resolve their problems - feel guilty, not because of excessive pleasures - not because they indulge in pleasures which go against - their sense of duty or morality, or what-so-ever. On the contrary, they feel guilty for not enjoying enough. For not being able to enjoy. Oh my god, one is thirsty in the desert and - what to drink but Coke? The perfect commodity. Why? It was already Marx who long ago emphasized that - a commodity is never just a simple object that we buy and consume. A commodity is an object full of theological - even metaphysical niceties. Its presence always reflects an invisible transcendence. And the classical publicity for Coke quite openly refers to this - absent, invisible quality. Coke is 'The Real Thing' or 'Coke - That's it'. What is that 'it', the 'real thing'? It's not just another positive property of Coke - something that can be described or pinpointed - through chemical analysis - it's that mysterious 'something more'. The indescribable excess which is the Object-Cause - of my Desire. In our post-modern, how ever we call them, societies - we are obliged to enjoy. Enjoyment becomes a kind or a weird perverted duty. The paradox of Coke is that you are thirsty - you drink it but, as everyone knows - the more you drink it the more thirsty you get. A desire is never simply the desire for certain thing. It's always also a desire for desire itself. A desire to continue to desire. Perhaps the ultimate horror of a desire is - to be fully filled-in, met - so that I desire no longer. The ultimate melancholic experience is the experience - of a loss of desire itself. It's not that in some return to a previous era - of natural consummation - where we got rid of this excess and were only consuming - for actual needs - like you were thirsty, you drank water, and so on. We cannot return to that. The excess is with us forever. So, let's have a drink of Coke. It's getting warm. It's no longer 'The Real Coke' and that's the problem. You know, this passage from sublime to excremental dimension. When it's cold, properly served, it has a certain attraction - all of a sudden this can change into shit. It's the elementary dialectics of commodities. We are not talking about objective, factual properties - of a commodity. We are talking only here about that elusive surplus. 'Kinder Surprise egg'. A quite astonishing commodity. The surprise of the 'Kinder Surprise egg' is that - this excessive object, the cause of your desire - is here materialized. In the guise of an object - a plastic toy which fills in the inner void - of the chocolate egg. The whole delicate balance is between these two dimensions: What you bought, the chocolate egg, and the surplus - probably made in some Chinese gulag or whatever - the surplus that you get for free. I don't think that the chocolate frame is here just to send you - on a deeper voyage towards the inner treasure - the, what Plato calls the 'Agalma' which makes you a worthy person, - which makes a commodity the desirable commodity - I think it's the other around. We should aim at the higher goal, the gold in the middle of an object - precisely in order to be able to enjoy the surface. This is what is the anti-metaphysical lesson, - which is difficult to accept. What does this famous 'Ode to Joy' stand for? It's usually perceived as a kind of ode to humanity - as such to the brotherhood and freedom of all people. And what strikes the eye here is the universal adaptability - of this well-known melody. It can be used by political movements - which are totally opposed to each other. In Nazi Germany it was widely used to celebrate great public events. In Soviet Union Beethoven was lionized - and the 'Ode to Joy' was performed almost as - a kind of a communist song. In China during the time of the great Cultural Revolution - when almost all western music was prohibited - the 9th symphony was accepted. It was allowed to play it as a piece of progressive bourgeois music. At the extreme right in South Rhodesia - before it became Zimbabwe - it proclaimed independence to be able - to postpone the abolishment of apartheid. Therefore those couple of years of independence - South Rhodesia, again the melody of 'Ode to Joy' - with changed lyrics of course, was the anthem of the country. At the opposite end - when Abimael Guzman President Gonzalo - the leader of 'Sendero Luminoso', the 'Shining Path' - the extreme leftist guerrilla in Peru. When he was asked by a journalist which piece of music - is his favourite, he claimed - again Beethoven's 9th symphony 'Ode to Joy'. When Germany was still divided - and their team was appearing together at the Olympics - when one of the Germans won golden medal - again Old to Joy was played - instead of either East or West German national anthem. And even now today 'Ode to Joy' is the unofficial - anthem of European union. So it's truly that we can imagine a kind of a perverse scene of - universal fraternity where Osama Bin Laden is - embracing President Bush, Saddam is embracing - Fidel Castro, white races is embracing Mao Tse Tung - and all together they sing 'Ode to Joy'. It works. And this is how every ideology has to work. It's never just meaning. It always has to also work as an empty container - open to all possible meanings. It's, you know, that gut feeling that we feel - when we experience something pathetic and we say: "Oh my God, I am so moved, there is something so deep." But you never know what this depth is. It's a void. Now, of course there is a catch here. The catch is that of course this neutrality of a frame - is never as neutral as it appears. Here, I think the perspective of Alex from - the 'Clockwork Orange' enters. <i>- We were all feeling a bit shagged and fagged and fashed.</i> <i>- It having been an evening of some small energy expenditure -</i> oh my brothers. <i>- So we got rid of the auto and stopped off at The Korova -</i> for a nightcap. Why is Alex, this ultimate cynical delinquent, the hero of - 'Clockwork Orange', why is he so fascinated - overwhelmed - when he sees the lady singing Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'? <i>- And it was like for a moment, oh my brothers, -</i> <i>some great bird had flown into the milk bar -</i> <i>and I felt all the malanky little hairs on my plott -</i> <i>standing endwise and the shivers crawling up -</i> <i>like slow malanky lizards, and then down again.</i> <i>- Because I knew what she sang.</i> <i>- It was a bit from the glorious ninth by Ludwig van.</i> Whenever an ideological text says: "all humanity" - "unite in brotherhood, joy" and so on, - you should always ask: "Ok, ok, ok, but are this all, really all?" - "or is someone excluded?" I think Alex the delinquent from Clockwork Orange - identifies with this place of exclusion. And the great genius of Beethoven is that - he literally states this exclusion. All of a sudden the whole tone changes into a kind of - a carnavalesque rythm. It's no longer this sublime beauty. <i>- Excuse me brother, I ordered this two weeks ago -</i> <i>can you see if it's arrived yet please?</i> <i>- Just a minute.</i> We hear this vulgar music precisely when Alex enters - a shopping arcade and we can see from his movements - that now he feels at home. He is like fish in the water. <i>- Pardon me ladies.</i> Beethoven is not the cheap celebrator - of the brotherhood of humanity and so on, - we are one big happy family enjoying freedom, - dignity, and so on. <i>- Enjoying that are you my darling?</i> The first part, which is falsely celebrated today, - you hear it in all official events - is clearly identified with Beethoven - as ideology, and then the second part tells - the true story of that which disturbs the official ideology - and of the failure of the offical ideology - to constrain it, to tame it. This is why Beethoven was doing something - which may appear difficult to do. He was already in the purely musical work - practicing critique of ideology. If the classical ideology functioned in the way - designated by Marx in his nice formula - from Capital Volume One: <i>"Sie wissen es nicht, aber sie tun es."</i> "They don't know what they are doing" - "but they are none the less doing it." Cynical ideology functions in the mode of - "I know very well what I am doing" "but I am still none the less doing it." This paradoxical constellation is staged in a beautiful way - in the famous song 'Officer Krupke' in Bernstein's and Sondheim's - 'West Side Story'. <i>- Hey you!</i> <i>- Who me, officer Krupke? - Yeah you!</i> <i>- Give me one good reason for not -</i> <i>dragging you down to station house, you punk.</i> <i>- Dear.</i> <i>kindly Sergeant Krupke, you gotta understand -</i> <i>it's just our bringin' up-ke, that gets us out of hand.</i> <i>- Our mothers all are junkies, our fathers all are drunks.</i> <i>- Golly Moses, natcherly we're punks!</i> <i>-Gee, Officer Krupke, we're very upset.</i> <i>- We never had the.</i> The delinquent gang enact a whole explanation, - as a musical number of course, of why they are delinquents. <i>- .there is good, there is untapped good!</i> <i>- Like inside, the worst of us is good!</i> Addressing the police officer Krupke, - who is not there but all is addressed at the police officer. <i>- .toucthin' good story.</i> <i>- Lemme tell it to the world!</i> <i>- Just tell it to the judge.</i> So one of them adopts the position of a judge: <i>- Dear kindly Judge, your Honor, my parents treat me rough.</i> <i>- With all their marijuana, they won't give me a puff.</i> Then the psychological explanation: <i>- .he shouldn't be here.</i> <i>- This boy don't need a couch, He needs a useful career.</i> <i>- Society's played him a terrible trick -</i> <i>und sociologically he's sick!</i> <i>- I am sick!</i> <i>- We are sick, we are sick.</i> The paradox here is how can you know all this and still do it? This is the cynical functioning of ideology. They're never what they appear to be cynical brutal delinquents. They always have a tiny private dream. This dream can be many things. It can even be something quite ordinary. Let's take the English riots of august 2011. The standard liberal explanation really sounds like - a repetition of 'Officer Krupke' song. We cannot just condemn this riot as delinquent vandalism. You have to see how these people live in practically ghettos - isolated communities - no proper family life, no proper education. They don't even have a prospect of a regular employment. But this is not enough because man is not simply - a product of objective circumstances. We all have this margin of freedom in deciding - how we subjectivise these objective circumstances - which will of course determine us. How we react to them by constructing our own universe. The conservative solution is we need more police. We need courts, which pass severe judgements. I think this solution is too simple. If I listen closely to some of David Cameron's statements - it looked as if ok, they are beating people, - burning houses, but the truly horrible thing is - that they were taking objects without paying for them. The ultimate things that we can imagine. In a very limited way, Cameron was right - there was no ideological justification. It is the reaction of people who are totally caught into - the predominant ideology but have no ways to realise - what this ideology demands of them so it's kind of - a wild acting out within this ideological space of consumerism. Even if we are dealing with apparently - totally non-ideological brutality, - I just want to burn houses, to get objects. It is the result of a very specific social and ideological - constellation where big ideology, striving for justice - equality etc, disintegrates. The only functioning ideology is pure consumerism - and then no wonder what you get as a form of protest. Every violent acting out is a sign that - there is something you are not able to put into words. Even the most brutal violence is the enacting - of a certain symbolic deadlock. The great thing about the 'Taxi Driver' - is that it brings this brutal outburst of violence - to it's radical suicidal dimension. We are not dealing here with something - which simply concerns the fragile psychology - of a distorted person, what Travis in Taxi Driver is. It has something to do with ideology. <i>- Listen you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i> <i>- Here is a man who would not take it anymore.</i> <i>- Who would not let.</i> <i>- Listen you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i> <i>- Here is a man who would not take it anymore.</i> <i>- A man who stood up against the scum -</i> <i>the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.</i> - Here is someone who stood up. In the 'Taxi Driver', Travis, the hero - is bothered by the young prostitute played by Jody Foster. What bothers him are, of course as is always the case - precisely his fantasies. Fantasies of her. Victim who of her hidden pleasures. And fantasies are not just a private matter of individuals. Fantasies are the central stuff our ideologies are made of. <i>- Don't look at him.</i> Fantasy is in psychoanalytical perspective - fundamentally a lie. Not a lie in the sense that it's just a fantasy - but not a reality but a lie in the sense that - fantasy covers up a certain gap in consistency. When things are blurred, when we cannot really get - to know things, fantasy provides an easy answer. The usual mode of fantasy is to construct a scene - not a scene where I get what I desire - but a scene in which I imagine myself as desired by others. 'Taxi Driver' is an unacknowledged remake of - perhaps the greatest of John Ford's westerns - his late classic 'The Searchers'. <i>- I take many.? - Scalps.</i> In both films, the hero tries to save - a young woman who is perceived as a victim of brutal abuse. In the Searchers the young Nathalie Wood - was kidnapped and lived for a couple of years - as the wife of an Indian chief. In Taxi driver the young Jodie Foster - is controlled by a ruthless pimp. <i>- You walk out with those fucking creeps and lowlifes -</i> <i>and degenerates out on the streets -</i> <i>and you sell your little pussy for nothing man?</i> <i>For some low life pimp?</i> <i>Stands in a hall?</i> <i>- I'm the- I'm square?</i> <i>- You're the one that's square man.</i> <i>- I don't go screw and fuck with a bunch of killers -</i> <i>and junkies the way you do.</i> The task is always to save the perceived victim. But what really drives this violence of the hero - is a deep suspicion that the victim is not simply a victim. That the victim, effectively in a perverted way - enjoys or participates in what appears as her victimhood. So that, to put it very simply - she doesn't want to be redeemed, she resists it. <i>- Let's go home Debby.</i> And this is the big problem - if I make an immediate jump to the political dimension - the big problem of American military interventions - especially so-called humanitarian interventions. From Iraq to already Vietnam half a century ago. We try to help them - but what if they really did not want our help? The result of this debilitating deadlock - can only be an outburst of violence. We do get, towards the end of the film - Travis exploding in a killing spree. Killing the pimps, all the people around the young girl. Violence is never just abstract violence. It's a kind of brutal intervention in the real - to cover up a certain impotence concerning - what we may call cognitive mapping. You lack a clear picture of what's going on. Where are we? Exactly the same holds for the terrifying outburst of - violence; Anders Behring Breivik's murder spree in Oslo. Exploding a bomb in front of the government building - and then killing dozens of young members - of the social democratic party - in an island close to Oslo. Many commentators tried to dismiss this as - a clear case of personal insanity. But I think Breivik's manifesto is well worth reading. It is palpably clear there how this violence - that Breivik not only theorised about but also enacted - is a reaction to the impenetrability - and confusion of global capital. It's exactly like Travis Bickle's killing spree - at the end of the 'Taxi Driver'. When he is there, barely alive - he symbolically with his fingers points a gun - at his own head. Clear sign that all this violence was basically suicidal. He was on the right path, in a way - Travis in the 'Taxi Driver'. You should have the outburst of violence - and you should direct it at yourself - but in a very specific way at what in yourself - change you, ties you to the ruling ideology. <i>- Pippin? Pippin?</i> In Steven Spielberg's Jaws - a shark starts to attack people on the beach. What does this attack mean? What does the shark stand for? There were different, even mutually exclusive - answers to this question. On the one hand some critics claimed - that obviously the shark stands for the foreign threat - to ordinary Americans. The shark is a metaphor for either natural disaster - storms or immigrants threatening - United States citizens and so on. On the other hand it's interesting to note that - Fidel Castro, who loves the film - once said that for him it was obvious that - Jaws is kind of a leftist Marxist film - and that the shark is a metaphor for - brutal big capital exploiting ordinary Americans. So which is the right answer? I claim none of them and at the same time all of them. Ordinary Americans, as ordinary people in all countries - have a multitude of fears. We fear all kind of things. We fear maybe, immigrants or people - whom we perceive as lower than ourselves attacking us, robbing us. We fear people raping our children. We fear natural disasters, tornados, earthquakes, - tsunamis, we fear corrupted politicians. We fear big companies which can basically - do with us whatever they want. The function of the shark is to unite all these fears so that we can in away trade all these fears for one fear alone. <i>- Smile you son of a.</i> In this way our experience of reality gets much simpler. Why am I mentioning this? Because isn't it that - for example, the most extreme case of ideology - maybe in the history of humanity - the Nazi fascist anti-Semitism - work precisely in the same way? Imagine an ordinary German citizen - in the late 20s early 30s. His situation is, in an abstract way - the same as that of a small child. He's totally perplexed. Social authority, symbolic order is telling him - you are a German worker, banker, whatever, - but nothing functions. What does society want from him? Why is everything going wrong? The way he perceives the situation - is that newspapers lie to him. He lost his work because of inflation. He lost all his money in the bank. His moral degradation and so on. So what's the meaning of this all? The original fascist dream is to - of course as the dream of every ideology - to have a cake and to eat it. As it was often pointed out, fascism is, - at it's most elementary, a conservative revolution Revolution; economic development, - modern industry, yes. But a revolution which would none the less - maintain or even reassert a traditional hierarchal society. A society which is modern, efficient, - but at the same time controlled by - hierarchal values with no class or other antagonisms. Now, they have a problem here, the fascists, - but antagonism, class struggle and other dangers - is something inherent to capitalism. Modernisation, industrialisation, - as we know from the history of capitalism, - means disintegration of old stable relations. It means social conflicts. Instability is the way capitalism functions. So how to solve this problem? Simple. You need to generate an ideological narrative - which explains how things went wrong - in a society, not as a result of the - inherent tensions in the development of this society - but as the result of a foreign intruder. Things were ok until Jews penetrated our social body. The way to restore the health of our social body - is to eliminate the Jews. It's the same operation as with - the shark in jaws. You have a multitude of fears - and this multiplicity of fears confuses you - Like you simply don't know - what's the meaning of all this confusion. And you replace this confused multitude - with one clear figure: the Jew. And everything becomes clear. <i>- The search for cuts in</i> <i>the social security provision -</i> <i>to lone parent families</i> <i>in part spurred this report.</i> <i>The social security</i> <i>department fears -</i> <i>that the accelerating budget -</i> <i>for single mothers</i> <i>on benefits -</i> <i>could reach nearly</i> <i>5 billion pounds -</i> <i>by the end of the decade.</i> <i>But the issue</i> <i>of the lone parent -</i> <i> has increasingly been</i> <i>seen as the heart -</i> <i>of John Major's back to </i> <i>basics crusade.</i> Remember I think around two, three decades ago - when the prime minister of the United Kingdom was - John Major - there was a kind of ideological campaign - to return to morality and so on. And all the evils of society - were embodied in the conservative narrative - in the figure of - unemployed single mother. Like there is violence in our suburbs? Of course, because single unemployed mothers - cannot take care of their children - don't properly educate them and so on. We have a lack in our budget, not enough money, - of course, because we have to support unwed - single mothers and so on and so on. In an ideological edifice - you need some pseudo concrete image like this - to fixate your imagination - and then this image can mobilise us. Imagine ideology as a kind of a filter. A frame, so that if you look at the same - ordinary reality through that frame - everything changes. In what sense? It's not that the frame actually adds anything; It's just that the frame opens the abyss of suspicion. If we look at the anti-Semitic image of the Jew - it's crucial to notice how contradictory this figure - of the Jew is. Jews are at the same time extra intellectual - like mathematicians, whatever, - and vulgar. Not washing regularly. Seducing innocent girls all the time and so on and so on. This is typical for racism. You try to imagine how the other enjoys - all the secret orgies or whatever, because in racism - the other is not simply an enemy, - Usually it is also invested with - some specific perverse enjoyment or - in an inverted way, the other can be someone - who tries to steal from us our enjoyment, our. to disturb, as we usually put it; our way of life. We should be here very precise - not to fall into the usual trap of disqualifying - all elements out of which the Nazi ideological edifice - is composed, to disqualify all them as proto-fascist. We should never forget that the large majority - of these elements which we today associate with fascism - were taken from the workers' movement. This idea of large numbers of people marching together - this idea of strict bodily discipline as our duty; the Nazis directly took this over from social democracy - from the left. Let me just take some other central concepts - of the Nazi world-view; the solidarity of the people. My God, there is nothing bad in this notion as such. The problem is solidarity to what kind of people? If by people you mean 'Volksgemeinschaft' - the organic community of people - where then the enemy is automatically - the foreign intruder, - in this case we are in Nazism. The crucial thing is to locate ideology where it belongs. Let's take a clear example. The well known song 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me' - from the film 'Cabaret'. <i>- The sun on the meadow</i> <i>is summery warm -</i> <i>the stag in the forest</i> <i>runs free. </i> Some of my friends after seeing the film, - Bob Fosse's 'Cabaret' - thought that after they heard this song - they finally understood what at it's deepest - as to its emotional impact, what fascism is. But I think this precisely is the mistake to be avoided. This song is rather ordinary popular song. Incidentally it was composed while they were - shooting the movie by a Jewish couple. Nice irony. If you look not only at the music, at the way it is sung, - but even at the words: "awakening of a nation, tomorrow belongs to me." One can well imagine with a slight change of words - radically leftist, communist song. <i>- But soon says the whisper;</i> <i>arise, arise.</i> The German hard rock band 'Rammstein' - are often accused of flirting, playing with - the Nazi militaristic iconography. But if one observes closely their show - one can see very nicely what they are doing. Exemplarily in one of their best known songs 'Reise Reise'. <i>- Reise, reise, Seemann reise -</i> <i>Jeder tut's auf seine Weise -</i> <i>Der eine stößt den</i> <i>Speer zum Mann -</i> <i>- Der andere zum Fische dann.</i> <i>- Reise, reise,</i> <i>Seemann reise.</i> The minimal elements of the Nazi ideology - enacted by 'Rammstein' are something like pure elements of libidinal investment. Enjoyment has to be, as it were, - condensed in some minimal tics: gestures, - which do not have any precise ideological meaning. What 'Rammstein' does is - it liberates these elements from their Nazi articulations. It allows us to enjoy them in their pre-ideological state. The way to fight Nazism is to enjoy these elements, - ridiculous as they may appear, - by suspending the Nazi horizon of meaning. This way you undermine Nazism from within. So how does none the less ideology do this? How does it articulate pre-ideological elements? These elements can also be seen as a kind of a bribe. The way ideology pays us to seduce us into it's edifice. These bribes can be purely libidinal bribes, - all those tics which are condensed enjoyment. Or they can be explicit discursive elements like - notions of solidarity of collective discipline, - struggle for one's destiny and so on and so on. All these in itself are free floating elements - which open themselves to different ideological fields. Let's turn to the high point of our consumerism. Let me take a drink. Some of it – 'Starbucks' coffee. I am regularly drinking it, I must admit it. But are we aware that when we buy a cappuccino - from 'Starbucks', we also buy quite a lot of ideology. Which ideology? You know when you enter a 'Starbucks' store - it's usually always displayed in some posters there, - their message which is: Yes our cappuccino is more expensive than others - but - and then comes the story: We give one percent of all our income to some - Guatemala children to keep them healthy. For the water supply for some Sahara farmers, - or to save the forests, to enable organic growing coffee. whatever, whatever. Now I admire the ingeniosity of this solution. In the old days of pure simple consumerism - you bought a product and then you felt bad. My God, I'm just a consumerist - while people are starving in Africa. So the idea was you had to do something to counteract - your pure distractive consumerism. For example, I don't know, you contribute - to charity and so on. What 'Starbucks' enables you is to be a consumerist and - be a consumerist without any bad conscience - because the price for the counter measure, - for fighting consumerism - is already included into the price of a commodity. Like you pay a little bit more and you are not just - a consumerist but you do also your duty towards environment - the poor starving people in Africa and so on and so on. It's, I think, the ultimate form of consumerism. We should not simply oppose a principal life - dedicated to duty and enjoying our small pleasures. Let's take today's capitalism. We have, on the one hand, the demands of the circulation - of the capital which push us towards profit making - expansion, exploitation and destruction of nature and, - on the other hand, ecological demands: let's think about our posterity and about our own survival, - let's take care of nature and so on. In this opposition between ruthless pursuit of - capitalist expansion and ecological awareness - duty, a strange perverted duty of course - duty is on the side of capitalism, - as many perspicuous analysts noted. Capitalism has a strange religious structure. It is propelled by this absolute demand: capital has to circulate to reproduce itself to expand - to multiply itself and for this goal - anything can be sacrificed, up to our lives, - up to nature and so on. Here we have a strange unconditional injunction. A true capitalist is a miser who is ready - to sacrifice everything for this perverted duty. What we see here in Mojave desert - at this resting place for abandoned planes - is the other side of capitalist dynamics. Capitalism is all the time in crisis. This is precisely why it appears almost indestructible. Crisis is not its obstacle. It is what pushes it forwards - towards permanent self-revolutionising - permanent, extended self-reproduction, - always new products. The other invisible side of it is waste, - tremendous amount of waste. We shouldn't react to these heaps of waste - by trying to somehow get rid of it. Maybe the first thing to do is to accept this waste. To accept that there are things out there - which serve nothing. To break out of this eternal cycle of functioning. The German philosopher Walter Benjamin - said something very deep. He said that we experience history, - what does it mean for us to be historical beings, - not when we are engaged in things, when things move, - only when we see this, again, - rest waste of culture being half retaken by nature, - at that point we get an intuition of what history means. Maybe this also accounts for the redemptic value - of post-catastrophic movies - like 'I Am Legend' and so on. We see the devastated human environment, - half empty factories, machines falling apart, - half empty stores. What we experience at this moment, - the psychoanalytic term for it would have been - the 'Inertia of the Real' - this mute presence beyond meaning. What moments like - confronting planes here in Mojave Desert - bring to us is maybe a chance - for an authentic passive experience. Maybe without this properly artistic - moment of authentic passivity - nothing new can emerge. Maybe something new only emerges through the failure, - the suspension of proper functioning of the - existing network of our life - where we are. Maybe this is what we need more than ever today. What does the wreck of the 'Titanic' stand for? We all know the standard reading - of the impact of the sinking of the Titanic. Not only the film but the real accident. This sinking had such an impact because it happened - in a society still at that point in all its glitz and glory - unaware of the decay that awaited it in the near future; the World Wars and so on. But there is something in excess - of this entire field of meanings - which is the very fascinating presence - of the ruin of the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean. When James Cameron organised - a trip to the real wreck of titanic - he also made a similar remark. When the explorers approached the wreck, - they had this almost metaphysical experience - that they are approaching a forbidden territory - in which the sacred and the obscene overlap. <i>- Yeah, Roger that.</i> <i>Ok drop down -</i> <i>and go into the first</i> <i>class gangway door. </i> <i>- I want you guys</i> <i>working with. </i> Every effective political, ideological symbol - or symptom has to rely on this dimension of - petrified enjoyment. Of the frozen grimace of an excessive pleasure in pain. What am I doing here in the middle of the ocean - alone in a boat surrounded by frozen corpses? <i>- Jack?</i> am in a scene from James Cameron's 'Titanic' - <i>- Jack?</i> which is the supreme case of ideology in recent Hollywood. Why? Beause of the imminent - tension to the story of the film. <i>– I don't know this dance.</i> <i>– Neither do I.</i> <i>- Just go with it.</i> <i>Don't think.</i> We have at least three levels. First there is what people ironically refer to as - James Cameron's Hollywood Marxism - this ridiculous fake sympathy with lower classes. Up there, first class passengers - they are mostly evil, egotistic, cowardly - <i>- You know I don't</i> <i>like that, Rose. </i> Embodied in Kate Winslet's fiancé - played by Billy Zane. <i>- She knows.</i> This whole narrative is sustained - by a much more reactionary myth. <i>- Did you see</i> <i>those guys' faces?</i> We should ask what role does the iceberg hitting the ship - play in the development of the love story? <i>- When the ship docks</i> <i>I'm getting off with you. </i> <i>- This is crazy. </i> <i>- I know.</i> My claim is here a slightly cynical one. This would have been the true catastrophe. We can imagine how maybe after two three weeks of - of intense sex in New York - the ove affair would somehow fade away. <i>- As a paying customer -</i> <i>I expect to get what I want.</i> Kate Winslet is an upper class girl - in psychological distress confused, - her ego is in shatters. and the function of Leonardo Dicaprio - <i>- Over on the bed,</i> <i>the couch.</i> is simply that he helps her to reconstitute her ego. <i>- Good. Lie down. </i> Her self image, literally he draws her image. <i>- Tell me when it looks right.</i> <i>- Put your arm back</i> <i>the way it was.</i> It's really a new version of one of the old - favourite imperialist myths. The idea being that when the upper class people - lose their vitality - they need a contact with lower classes. Basically ruthlessly exploiting them in a vampire like way - as it were sucking from them the life energy. Revitalised they can join their secluded upper class life. <i>- My heart was pounding</i> <i>the whole time. </i> <i>- It was the most erotic</i> <i>moment of my life. </i> <i>- Up until then at least.</i> The ship hits the iceberg - not immediately after sex but when the couple goes up - to the open space and decide to stay together. <i>- Oh yes. Hey look at this.</i> You know, often in history - the event which may appear as a catastrophe - saves persons or an idea, elevating it into a myth. Remember the intervention of the Soviet army - and other Warsaw backed armies in 1968 in Czechoslovakia - to strangle the so called Prague Spring. The attempt of the Czech democratic communists - to introduce a more human faced socialism. Usually we perceive this brutal Soviet intervention - as something that destroyed the brief dream of Prague Spring. I think it saved the dream. Either Czechoslovakia would have turned into an ordinary - liberal capitalist state - or at a certain point which was usually the fate of - reformist communists, the communist in power - would be obliged to set a certain limit. Ok, you had you fun, your freedom - that's enough, now we again define the limits. Again, the paradox is precisely the Soviet intervention - saved the dream of the possibility of - another communism and so on and so on. So, here again - through the temporal catastrophe - we have a love story which is at it were, - redeemed in it's idea, saved for eternity. We can ultimately read the catastrophe - as a desperate manoeuvre - to save the illusion of eternal love. We can see how ideology works effectively here. We have two superficial levels. All the fascination of the accident, then - the love story - but all this which is quite acceptable - for our liberal progressive minds, - all this is just a trap. Something to lower our attention - threshold, as it were, to open us up - to be ready to accept the true conservative message - of rich people having tried to revitalise themselves - by ruthlessly appropriating the vitality of the poor people. <i>- There's no one here sir.</i> There is a wonderful detail which tells everything. <i>- Come back.</i> When Kate Winslet notices that Leonardo Dicaprio - is dead she, of course, starts to shout: "I will never let go, I will never let go." while at the same moment - <i>- I will never let go.</i> <i>- I promise.</i> she pushes him off. He is what we may call ironically a vanishing mediator. This logic of the production of the couple - has a long history in Hollywood. Whatever the story is about, - it may be about the end of the world, an asteroid - threatening the very survival of humanity - or a great war whatever. As a rule we always have a couple whose - link is threatened and who somehow through - this ordeal at the end happily gets together. This logic does not hold only for Hollywood films. In the late forties, in Soviet Union, - they produced arguably one of the most expensive - film of all times: 'The Fall of Berlin'. The chronicle of the second World War - from the Soviet standpoint. And it's incredible how closely this film - also follows the logic of the production of a couple. The story begins just before - the German attack on the Soviet Union - when the model worker who is in love - with a local girl but is too shy to propose to her, - is called to Moscow to get a medal from Comrade Stalin. There Stalin notices his confusion, distress, - and Stalin gives him some advice - which poetry to quote and so on. This part unfortunately was lost - because in the background of this scene there was Beria - a Soviet politician who after Stalin's death - became a 'non-person' - was shot as a traitor. But we know from the screenplay what was there. If Stalin gives you love advice it has to succeed - so the couple embraces. He tells her probably to make love. At that very moment there is the triumphant - violent entrance of the obstacle: German planes come, dropping bombs. The girl is taken prisoner. The boy of course joins the Red Army - and we follow him through all the great battles. The idea being that in a deeper logic of the film, - what these battles were about - was really to recreate the couple. The boy has to get his girl. This is what happens at the end - but in a very strange way which reconfirms - Stalin's role as the supreme divine matchmaker. The scene itself, Stalin emerging himself into - a crowd of ordinary people never happened. Stalin was totally paranoid about flying, - about taking planes. But none the less when he saw this scene he cried. Of course he himself as you know, wrote the lines. When the couple encounters each other - the girl first sees Stalin, - then she turns around and, surprised, - sees her lover - for whom she was waiting all the time of the war. So it's only through the presence of Stalin - that the couple gets reunited. This is how ideology works. Not the explicit ideology of the film - which we hear at the end Stalin saying: now all the free people will enjoy peace - and so on and so on. But precisely ideology at its more fundamental. This apparently totally subordinated motive - unimportant in itself, - the story of a couple, this is what is the key element, - which holds the entire film together, - that small surplus element which attracts us, - which maintains our attention. This is how ideology works. <i>- Nice.</i> <i>- Everything clean.</i> <i>- Oiled.</i> <i>- So that your action</i> <i>is beautiful.</i> <i>- Smooth, Charlene.</i> We usually think that military discipline - is just a matter of mindlessly following orders. Obeying the rules. You don't think you do what is your duty. It's not as simple as that. If we do this, we just become machines. There has to be something more. This more can have two basic forms. The first more benign form is an ironic distance. Best epitomised by the well known movie - and TV series 'M.A.S.H.' <i>- Hawkeye?</i> Where the military doctors are involved - in sexual escapades, - make jokes all the time. Some people took Robert Altman's movie 'M.A.S.H.' - as a kind of antimilitaristic, satiric product - but it's not. We should always bear in mind that these - soldiers with all their practical jokes, - making fun of the serious and so on - operated perfectly as soldiers. They did their duty. <i>- This one's for you, babe.</i> Much more ominous is a kind of obscene - obscene supplement to pure military discipline. In practically all movies about U.S. Marines, - the best-known embodiment of this obscenity - are marching chants. A mixture of nonsense: <i>- I don't know but I've been told.</i> <i>- Eskimo pussy is mighty cold.</i> And obscenity. This is not undermining, making fun of military discipline. It is it's inner most constituent. You take this obscene supplement away - and military machine stops working. <i>- Well, no shit. </i> <i>- What have we got here? </i> <i>- A fucking comedian?</i> <i>- Private Joker. </i> <i>- I admire your honesty.</i> <i>- Hell, I like you. </i> <i>- You can come over -</i> <i>to my house and</i> <i>fuck my sister.</i> <i>- You little scum bag!</i> <i>- I've got your name!</i> <i>- I've got your ass!</i> <i>- You will not laugh.</i> <i>- You will not cry.</i> <i>- You will learn by the numbers.</i> <i>- I will teach you.</i> <i>- Now get up!</i> <i>- Get on your feet!</i> <i>- You had best unfuck yourself</i> <i>or I will unscrew -</i> <i>your head and shit</i> <i>down your neck.</i> <i>- Sir, yes, sir!</i> <i>- Private Joker -</i> <i>why don't you join</i> <i>my beloved corps?</i> I think that the drill sergeant, - the way it is played in an exemplary way in - Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' - that the drill sergeant is rather a tragic figure. I always like to imagine him as the person who - after his work returns home, is quite decent and so on. <i>- This is my rifle,</i> <i>this is my gun.</i> All this obscene shouting is just a show put on - not so much to impress ordinary soldiers - whom he is training as to bribe them - with bits of enjoyment. It's not just a question of these obscenities, - which sustains the military machinery; it's another more general rule which holds for - military communities, but even more - I would say, for all human communities. From the largest nations, ethnic groups, - up to small university departments and so on. You don't only have explicit rules. You always, in order to become part of a community, - you need some implicit unwritten rules - which are never publicly recognised - but are absolutely crucial as the point of - the identification of a group. In the U.K. everyone knows about - the obscene unwritten rituals, - which regulate life in public schools. <i>- That'll be all. Thank</i> <i>you, Finchley.</i> <i>- I want to see all whips</i> <i>in my study after break.</i> <i>- Right, sir.</i> <i>- Oh, how was India? Enjoy it?</i> <i>- Jolly good.</i> <i>- Bridges!</i> <i>- I'll labor night and day.</i> Just think about Lindsay Anderson's classic 'If.'. The public life is democratic - we have professors who interact with their pupils, - nice atmosphere, teaching friendship, - spirit of cooperation - but then we all know what happens - beneath the surface. Older pupils torturing, sexually abusing the younger. This same mixture of obscenity and sadistic violence. And again what is crucial here is - we should not simply put all the blame - or all the enjoyment on the older pupils. The victims even are - part of this infernal cycle of obscenity. Its as if in order to really be a member of a community - you have to render you hands dirty. And I think even the Abu Ghraib scandal - of American soldiers torturing or - especially humiliating Iraqi prisoners - is to be read in this way. It's not simply, we the arrogant Americans - are humiliating others. What Iraqi soldiers experienced there - was the staging of the obscene underside - of the American military culture. In 'Full Metal Jacket' it's the character of 'Joker' - played by Matthew Modine - who is close to what we would call a normal soldier. A 'M.A.S.H.' type of soldier. He has proper ironic distance. He proves, at the end, militarily, - the most efficient soldier. Returning back to me. Why then will I soon shoot myself? Something went wrong there. But what? <i>- Lock and load!</i> I did not just run amok. <i>- Order.</i> <i>- This is my rifle.</i> <i>- There are many like it,</i> <i>but this one is mine.</i> But I got too directly identified - with these obscene rituals. I lost the distance. I took them seriously. <i>- What in the name</i> <i>of Jesus H. Christ -</i> <i>are you animals doing</i> <i>in my head?</i> If you get too close to it - if you over identify with it - if you really immediately become the voice - of this super ego, it's self destructive. You kill people around you - you end up killing yourself. <i>- Oh, shh, shh, shh.</i> <i>- So you think Batman's made Gotham a better place? Hm?</i> <i>- Look at me.</i> <i>- Look at me!</i> <i>- You see, this is how crazy Batman's made Gotham.</i> <i>- You want order in Gotham -</i> <i>Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.</i> <i>- Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die.</i> <i>- Starting tonight.</i> <i>- I'm a man of my word.</i> So who is Joker? <i>- If we're gonna play games.</i> Which is the lie he is opposing? <i>- .I'm gonna need</i> <i>a cup of coffee.</i> <i>- Ah, the 'good cop,</i> <i>bad cop' routine?</i> <i>- Not exactly.</i> The truly disturbing thing about The Dark Knight - is that it elevates lie into a general social principal, - into the principal of organisation - of our social political life. As if our societies can remain stable, - can function, only if based on a lie. As if telling the truth, and this telling the truth - embodies in Joker means distraction. Disintegration of the social order. <i>- Never start with the head.</i> <i>- The victim gets all fuzzy.</i> <i>- He can't feel the next.</i> Toward the end it is as if lie functions - as a hot potato passing from - one person's hand to another person's hand. First there is Harvey Dent. <i>- So be it. Take the Batman</i> <i>into custody.</i> The public prosecutor who lies. <i>- I am the Batman.</i> Claiming that he is the real - person behind Batman's mask. That he is Batman. Then we have Gordon, - honest policeman, Batman's friend, who - fakes, stages his own death. <i>- Five dead.</i> <i>Two of them cops.</i> <i>- You can't sweep that off.</i> At the end, Batman himself takes upon himself - <i>- But the Joker cannot win.</i> the crimes, murders committed - by Harvey Dent, the public prosecutor turned criminal - <i>- Gotham needs</i> <i>its true hero.</i> in order to maintain the trust of the public - into the legal system. The idea is if the ordinary public were to learn - how corrupt was or is the very core of our - legal system then everything would have collapsed - so we need a lie to maintain order. <i>- A hero.</i> <i>- Not the hero we deserved,</i> <i>but the hero we needed.</i> <i>- Nothing less than</i> <i>a knight, shining.</i> There's nothing new in this. This is an old conservative wisdom - asserted long ago by philosophers from Plato - especially, and then Immanuel Kant, Edmond Burke and so on and so on. This idea that the truth is too strong. That a politician should be a cynicist who, - although he knows what is true, tells to ordinary people what Plato called 'a noble fable' - a lie. <i>- Um, the United States</i> <i>knows that Iraq -</i> <i>has weapons of</i> <i>mass destruction. </i> <i>- The U.K. knows</i> <i>that they have -</i> <i>weapons of mass destruction.</i> <i>- Any country on</i> <i>the face of the earth -</i> <i>with an active</i> <i>intelligence program -</i> <i>knows that Iraq has weapons</i> <i>of mass destruction.</i> <i>- Which could be activated</i> <i>within forty five minutes -</i> <i>including against his</i> <i>own Shia population.</i> <i>The choice is his and</i> <i>if he does not disarm -</i> <i>the United States of America</i> <i>will lead a coalition -</i> <i>and disarm him</i> <i>in the name of peace.</i> Let's be frank. We can have a state - public system of power - as legitimate as you want submitted to critical press, - democratic elections and so on and so on, - apparently just serves us. But nonetheless, if you look closely into - how even the most democratic state power functions - in order for it to display true authority, - and power needs authority, there has to be, as it were, - between the lines all the time this message of: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we are legalised through elections" - "but basically we can do with you whatever we want." <i>- Because that's what</i> <i>needs to happen. </i> <i>- Because sometimes,</i> <i>truth isn't good enough. </i> <i>- Sometimes people</i> <i>deserve more. </i> <i>- Sometimes people</i> <i>deserve -</i> <i>to have their</i> <i>faith rewarded. </i> One of the great platitudes - which are popular today - when we are confronted with acts of violence - is to refer to Theodore Dostoïevsky's - famous statement from 'The Brothers Karamazov': "If there is no God then everything id permitted." Well, the first problem with this statement is that - Dostoïevsky, of crouse, never made it. he first one who used this phrase as - allegedly made by Dostoïevsky was - Jean-Paul Sartre in -43 - but the main point is that this - statement is simply wrong. Even a brief look at our predicament today - clearly tells us this. It is precisely: if there is God, that everything is permitted - to those who not only believe in God - but who perceive themselves as instruments, - direct instruments of the divine will. If you posit or perceive or legitimise yourself - as a direct instrument of the divine will - then of course all narrow petty moral considerations - disappear. How can you even think in such narrow terms - when you are a direct instrument of God? This is how so-called religious fundamentalists work, - but not only them. Every form of so called totalitarianism - works like that even if it is presented - or if it presents itself as atheist. Let's take Stalinism. Officially Stalinism was based on atheist Marxist theory, - but if we look closely at the subjective experience - of a Stalinist political agent, - leader, we see that - it's not a position of an arrogant master, - who can do whatever he wants. It's on the contrary the position of a perfect servant. In a Stalinist universe there definitely is - what in psychoanalytic theory we call the 'Big Other'. This 'Big Other' in the Stalinist universe - has many names. The best known of them are the necessity of - historical progress towards communism - simply history. History itself is the 'Big Other'. History as the necessary succession of historical stages. A communist experiences himself as simply - an instrument whose function is to actualise - a historical necessity. The people, the mythic people - whose instrument the totalitarian leader is - are never simply the actually existing individuals - groups of people and so on. It's some kind of imagined idealised point of reference - which works even when, for example in - rebellions against the communist rule, - like in Hungary -56, - when the large majority of actually resisting people - raises up, is opposed to the regime. They can still say: "no, these are just individuals" - "they are not the true people." When you are accused of: "My God" - "How could you have been doing all of these horrible things?" You could have said, and this is the - standard Stalinist excuse: "Of course my heart bleeds for all the poor victims, - "I am not fully responsible for it" - "I was only acting on behalf of the 'Big Other'". "As for myself, I like cats," "small children", whatever - this is always part of the iconography of - a Stalinist leader. Lenin in Stalinism is always presented as - someone who likes small children and cats. The implication being - Lenin had to order many killings and so on, but - but his heart was not there - this was his duty as instrument of - historical progress and so on and so on. The way to undermine Stalinism is not simply - to make fun of the leader which can be, - up to a point even tolerated. It is to undermine this very reference, - mythic reference which legitimises the Stalinist leader: the people. This is how I read - the by far best work of Milos Forman - his early Czech films. 'Black Peter', the 'Loves of a Blond' - and 'Firemen's Ball' where he mocks - precisely the ordinary people. In their daily conformission, - stupidity, egotistic lust - and so on and so on. It may appear that this is something very arrogant - but no, I think that this is the way to - undermine the entire structure of the Stalinist universe. To demonstrate not that leaders are not leaders, - they are always ready to say: Oh, but we are just" - "ordinary people like you." No! That there is no mythic people - which serves as the ultimate legitimisation. So what is the 'Big Other'? This basic element of every ideological edifice? It has two quite contradictory aspects. On the one hand, of course, - the 'Big Other' is the secret order of things like - divine reason, fate or whatever, - which is controlling our destiny. But it is maybe the least interesting aspect - of the 'Big Other' - as the agents, which guarantees meaning - of what we are doing. Much more interesting is the 'Big Other' - as the order of appearances. Many things which are prohibited - are not simply prohibited but - they should not happen for the 'Big Other'. A supreme example of this - agency of the 'Big Other' as the agency of - appearance is the prattling busybody - in David Lean's masterpiece, the 'Brief Encounter'. At the very beginning of the film, - the two lovers, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, - arrange for their last meeting in a cafeteria - of a small train station. <i>- Laura, what a lovely surprise.</i> <i>- Oh, Dolly.</i> <i>- My dear, I've been shopping</i> <i>till I'm dropping.</i> <i>- My feet are nearly off,</i> <i>and my throat's parched.</i> <i>- l thought of having</i> <i>tea in Spindle's -</i> <i>but l was terrified</i> <i>of losing the train.</i> <i>- Oh, dear.</i> <i>- This is Dr. Harvey.</i> <i>- How do you do?</i> <i>- Would you be a perfect dear -</i> <i>and get me my cup of tea?</i> <i>l really don't think l could</i> <i>drag my poor old bones</i> <i>over to the counter.</i> Why is this situation so interesting? Because on the one hand we cannot but experience - this annoying lady as a brutal intruder. <i>- There's your train.</i> <i>- Yes, l know.</i> <i>- Oh, aren't you coming</i> <i>with us?</i> <i>- No, l go in the opposite</i> <i>direction.</i> <i>- My practice is in Churley.</i> <i>- Oh, I see.</i> <i>- I'm a general practitioner</i> <i>at the moment.</i> <i>- Dr. Harvey's going out</i> <i>to Africa next week.</i> <i>- Oh, how thrilling.</i> Instead of the two lovers being allowed at least their - final moments alone - they have to maintain the appearances - that nothing is happening between them, - that they are just acquaintances and so on and so on. <i>- He'll have to run,</i> <i>or he'll miss it.</i> <i>- He's got to get right over</i> <i>to the other platform.</i> This precisely is the function of the 'Big Other'. We need for our stability, a figure of 'Big Other' - for whom we maintain appearances. <i>- And l arrived at the station</i> <i>with exactly half -</i> <i>a minute to spare. My dear, l flew.</i> But are things really as simple as that? The next scene, the scene of Celia Johnson - totally desperate, she knows she will never again - see her lover. <i>- Yes, he's a nice creature.</i> <i>- You known him long?</i> <i>- No, not very long.</i> <i>- l hardly know him</i> <i>at all, really.</i> <i>- Well, my dear, I've always</i> <i>had a passion for doctors.</i> Then we hear the line of Celia Johnson's thought. <i>- I wish I could trust you.</i> <i>- I wish you were</i> <i>a wise, kind friend -</i> <i>instead of a gossiping</i> <i>acquaintance I've known -</i> <i>casually for years and never</i> <i>particularly cared for.</i> What is the nature of this deadlock of Celia Johnson? She is split between the two figures - in the film of the Big Other. On the one hand it's her husband, - the ideal listener, but - it's out of question to confess to him. <i>- Fred.</i> <i>- Fred.</i> <i>- Dear Fred.</i> <i>- There's so much that</i> <i>I want to say to you.</i> <i>- You're the only one in the</i> <i>world with enough wisdom -</i> <i>and gentleness</i> <i>to understand.</i> <i>- Wild horses wouldn't drag </i> <i>me away from England -</i> <i>and home and all the</i> <i>things I'm used to.</i> <i>- l mean, one has one's roots</i> <i>after all, hasn't one?</i> <i>- Oh, yes, one has</i> <i>one's roots.</i> On the other hand you have here this stupid - person who is available as a confessor - but there is not even an elementary trust. <i>- I wish you'd stop talking.</i> <i>- I wish you'd stop prying and</i> <i>trying to find things out.</i> <i>- I wish you were dead.</i> <i>No, l don't mean that.</i> <i>- That was silIy and unkind -</i> <i>but l wish you'd stop talking.</i> <i>- My dear, all her hair -</i> <i> came out, and she said the</i> <i>social life was quite, -</i> <i>quite horrid. Provincial, you know,</i> <i>and very nouveau riche.</i> <i>- Oh, Dolly.</i> <i>- What's the matter, dear?</i> <i>Are you feeling ill again?</i> So that's the tragedy of our predicament. In order to fully exist as individuals - we need the fiction of a 'Big Other'. There must be an agency which, as it were, - registers our predicament. An agency where the truth of ourselves will be inscribed, - accepted. An agency to which to confess. But what if there is no such agency? This was the utmost despair of many women raped - in the post Yugoslav war - in Bosnia in the early nineties. They survived their terrible predicament - and what kept them alive was the idea I must survive - to tell the truth. If when if they survived they made a terrible discovery; there is no one to really listen to them. Either some ignorant bored social worker - or some relative - who usually made obscene insinuations like - are you sure you were not enjoying a little bit - the rape and so on and so on. They discovered the truth of what - Jacques Lacan claims: there is no 'Big Other'. There may be a virtual 'Big Other' - to whom you cannot confess. There may be a 'Real Other' - but it's never the virtual one. We are alone. I think Kafka was right when he said that - for a modern secular non-religious man - bureaucracy, state bureaucracy is the only remaining - contact with the dimension of the divine. It is in this scene from 'Brazil' - that we see the intimate link - between bureaucracy and enjoyment. What the impenetrable omnipotence of - bureaucracy harbours - is divine enjoyment. <i>- My name's Lowry,</i> <i>Mr. Warren, Sam Lowry.</i> The intense rush of bureaucratic engagement - serves nothing. <i>- Glad to have you on board.</i> It is the performance of it's very purposelessness - that generates an intense enjoyment - ready to reproduce itself forever. <i>- Between you and</i> <i>me, Lowry, this. no, no!</i> <i>.departement. tell Records</i> <i>to get stuffed!</i> <i>.is about to be</i> <i>upgraded and the..</i> <i>- Ah!</i> <i>- Here we are.</i> <i>- Your very own number</i> <i>on your very own door.</i> <i>- And behind that door,</i> <i>your very own office.</i> <i>- Congratulations, DZ-015.</i> <i>Welcome to the team.</i> <i>- Yes. No. Cancel that.</i> <i>Send to copies to Finance.</i> The adverse of that is a wonderful scene - more towards the beginning of the film. <i>- Harry Tuttle, heating</i> <i>engineer, at your service.</i> The hero who has a problem in his apartment - with plumbing tries to get the State agency to fix it. <i>- Are you from</i> <i>Central Services?</i> Of course, two guys come, they just want forms - to fill in, they do nothing. <i>- I called</i> <i>Central Services.</i> And then the ultimate subversive figure comes; a kind of clandestine plumber, played by Robert Deniro, - <i>- Just a minute. What was that</i> <i>business with the gun?</i> <i>- Just a precaution, sir.</i> <i>Just a precaution.</i> who tells him: "Just tell me what is the problem" - and promise quickly to fix it. This of course is the ultimate offense to bureaucracy. <i>- Are you telling me</i> <i>this is illegal?</i> <i>- Thanks.</i> <i>- Listed kid, we're all in it together.</i> <i>- Go on.</i> In the ordinary theological universe - your duty is imposed onto you by God - or society or another higher authority, and - your responsibility is to do it. But in a radically atheist universe - you are not only responsible for doing your duty, - you are also responsible for deciding - what is your duty. There is always in our subjectivity, - in the way we experience ourselves - a minimum of hysteria. Hysteria is what? Hysteria is the way - we question our social, symbolic identity. <i>- You're sure it's God? You're</i> <i>sure it's not the devil?</i> <i>- I'm not sure. I'm not</i> <i>sure of anything.</i> <i>- If it's the devil, the devil</i> <i>can be cast out.</i> <i>- But what if it's God?</i> <i>- You can't cast out</i> <i>God, can you?</i> What is hysteria at it's most elementary? It's a question addressed at the authority which - which defines my identity. It's: "Why am I what you are telling me that I am?" In psychoanalytic theory, hysteria is much more - subversive than perversion. A pervert has no uncertainties while again - the hysterical position is that of a doubt - which is an extremely productive position. All new inventions come from hysterical questioning - and the unique character of Christianity is that - it transposes this hysterical questioning - onto God himself as a subject. <i>- Who's that? Who's following</i> <i>me? Is that you? </i> This is the ingenious idea of - 'The Last Temptation of Christ' - as Kazantzakis' novel and Scorsese's film, - namely the idea that when Jesus Christ - in his youth is told that he is - not only the Son of God, but basically God himself, - he doesn't simply accept it. This is for Jesus Christ, boy, - traumatic news like, my God, why am I dead? Am I really dead? How did we come to that unique point, - which I think, makes Christianity an exception? t all began with the Book of Job - as we all know things turn out bad for Job. He loses everything. His house, his family, his possessions and so on. hree friends visit him and each of them - tries to justify Job's misfortunes. The greatness of Job is that - he does not accept this deeper meaning. When, towards the end of the Book of Job, God himself appears, - God gives right to Job. He says everything that the theological friends - were telling Job is false; everything that job was saying is true. No meaning in catastrophes. Here we have the first step in the direction of - delegitimizing suffering. <i>- Father stay with me,</i> <i>don't leave me.</i> The contrast between Judaism and Christianity - is the contrast between anxiety and love. The idea is that the Jewish God is the God of the - abyss of the other's desire. Terrible things happen, - God is in charge but we do not - know what the 'Big Other', God, wants from us. What is the divine desire? To designate this traumatic experience - Lacan used the Italian phrase 'che voglio'? "What do you want?" This terrifying question: but what do you want from me? The idea is that Judaism persists in this - anxiety, like God remains this enigmatic - terrifying other. And then Christianity resolves - the tension through love. By sacrificing his son, God demonstrates - that he loves us. So it's a kind of a imaginary, - sentimental even resolution of a situation - of radical anxiety. <i>- Father, forgive them.</i> If this were to be the case then Christianity - would have been a kind of ideological, reversal - or pacification of the deep, much more - shattering Jewish insight. but I think one can read the Christian gesture - in a much more radical way. This is what the sequence of crucifixion - in Scorsese's film shows us. What dies on the cross is precisely - this guarantee of the 'Big Other'. The message of Christianity is here radically atheist. It's the death of Christ is not any kind of - redemption of commercial affair in the sense of - Christ suffers to pay for our sins. Pay to whom? For what? And so on. It's simply the disintegration of the God which - guarantees the meaning of our lives. And that's the meaning of that famous phrase: "Eli Eli lama sabachthani?" "Father, why have you forsaken me?" <i>- Father, why have you</i> <i>forsaken me?</i> Just before Christ's death, we get - what in psychoanalytic terms we call - subjective destitution. Stepping out totally of the domain of - symbolic identification cancelling or suspending the entire field - of symbolic authority, - the entire field of the 'Big Other'. Of course, we cannot know - what God wants from us because there is no God. This is the Jesus Christ who says, - among other things, "I bring to earth not peace." "If you don't hate your father, your mother" - "you are not my follower." Of course this does not mean that you should actively - hate or kill your parents. I think that family relations stand here for - hierarchic social relations. The message of Christ is: I'm dying but my death itself is good news. It means you are alone, left to your freedom, - be in the Holy Ghost, - Holy Spirit, which is just the community of believers. It's wrong to think that - the second coming will be that Christ as a figure will - return somehow. Christ is already here when - believers form an emancipatory collective. This is why I claim that - that the only way really to be an atheist - is to go through Christianity. Christianity is much more atheist than - the usual atheism which - can claim there is no God and so on - but none the less retains a certain trust - into the 'Big Other', this 'Big Other' can be called - natural necessity, evolution or whatever. We humans are none the less reduced to a - position within a harmonious whole of evolution or whatever, - but the difficult thing to accept is again - that there is no 'Big Other'. No point of reference which guarantees meaning. We are in John Frankenheimer's Seconds, - a neglected Hollywood masterpiece from 1966 - from the very heart of the hippy era - which preached unrestrained hedonism. Realise your dreams, enjoy life fully. The film is the story of a late middle age businessman - leading a gray totally alienated life - and then he decides at some point - that he has enough of it. Through one of his friends he contacts - a mysterious agency, which offers him a deal. They will reorganise his life so that - so that he will be reborn. <i>- The cost runs in the</i> <i>neighborhood of -</i> <i>thirty thousand dollars.</i> <i>I know this seems -</i> <i>rather high but in</i> <i>addition to the rather -</i> <i>extensive cosmetic</i> <i>renovation by way of -</i> <i>plastic surgery for you,</i> <i>CPS has to provide -</i> <i>a fresh corpse that</i> <i>perfectly matches your -</i> <i>physical dimensions and</i> <i>medical specifications.</i> <i>- CPS?</i> <i>- Oh, Cadaver</i> <i>Procurement Section.</i> They use some corpse; they change it to look like - his own body. They plant this corpse, stage a pseudo accident - so that police think he is dead. <i>- Now, mister Wilson, you</i> <i>represent something -</i> <i>of a milestone around here.</i> And then, the agency organises an ultimate life - in a nice villa somewhere around L.A. - they even organise a nice lady who conveniently - stumbles upon him when he is taking a walk - along the beach. He is thus reborn. no longer as a boring business man but as a - modernist painter - <i>- Tony Wilson.</i> called Tony Wilson - played by none other than Rock Hudson. So, the woman, Nora, his new love, - tries to engage him in life, even takes him to some - wine orgy where people get drunk, - dance naked and so on. Everything seems ok - but Tony Wilson starts to miss his old life. More and more he is haunted by his past. Finally he breaks down, - approaches again the agency - telling them that he wants to return - to his old life. The boss of this mysterious company, - a kind of kindly cruel, - <i>- Hello son.</i> superego paternal figure - tells him the truth. He disappointed them by not being able to - adapt himself to his new life. <i>- You know, I sure hoped</i> <i>you'd make it, -</i> <i>find your dream come true.</i> <i>- What?</i> <i>- I said, I sure hoped</i> <i>you'd make it -</i> <i>find your dream come true.</i> <i>- You can call it wishful</i> <i>thinking, son -</i> <i>but life is built on wishing.</i> <i>- You've got to just keep</i> <i>plugging away at them.</i> <i>- You can't give up.</i> <i>and you can't let the mistakes</i> <i>jeopardize the dream.</i> So what went wrong here? The problem was that his past - in it's material existence was erased. <i>- Well, here's your</i> <i>transportation.</i> <i>- What?</i> <i>- Surgery, sir.</i> He lived in a totally new environment, new job, - new friends and so on. What remained the same were his dreams - because when the company organised his rebirth, - when the company provided a new existence - for him they simply followed his dreams. His dreams were wrong dreams - and this is quite a deep lesson for the theory of ideology. <i>- Just remember, son. We've</i> <i>got to keep plugging away -</i> <i>at the dream. The mistakes teach</i> <i>us how. It wasn't wasted.</i> <i>Remember that.</i> On the way to the operation hall, he discovers - the horrible truth. He will not be reborn but he will be used as a - cadaver for another person who wants to be reborn. We should draw a line of distinction - within the very field of our dreams. Between those who are the right dreams - pointing towards a dimension effectively beyond - our existing society and the wrong dreams: the dreams which are just an idealised - consumerist reflection, - mirror image of our society. We are not simply submitted to our dreams - they just come from some unfathomable - depths and we can't do anything about it. This is the basic lesson of psychoanalysis - and fiction cinema. We are responsible for our dreams. Our dreams stage our desires - and our desires are not objective facts. We created them, we sustained them, - we are responsible for them. This is an area of ancient lakebeds deposited - five to ten million years ago. The scene of mass orgy in 'Zabriskie Point' - is a nice metaphor of what went wrong - with the 1960s hippy revolution. It's crucial that 'Zabriskie Point' was made in 1970 - when the authentic revolutionary energy - of the sixties was already losing its strength. This orgy is somewhere between subversion - of the existing social order - and already the full estheticised - reincorporation of this allegedly - transgressive activities into the hegemonic ideology. Although Antonioni meant this - as a kind of transcendence of the existing constraints, - we can easily imagine this shot - in some publicity campaign. The first step to freedom is not just to - change reality to fit your dreams - it's to change the way you dream. and again this hurts because all satisfactions - we have come from our dreams. <i>- The great supreme</i> <i>commander chairman Mao -</i> <i>issued a world shaking call to us:</i> <i>you should pay attention</i> <i>to state affairs -</i> <i>and carry the great proletarian</i> <i>Cultural Revolution -</i> <i>through to the end.</i> One of the big problems of all great - revolutionary movements of the 20th century - such as Russia, Cuba or China, - is that they did change the social body - but the egalitarian communist society was never realised. The dreams remained the old dreams - and they turned into the ultimate nightmare. Now what remains of the radical left - waits for a magical event - when the true revolutionary agent will finally awaken. While the depressing lesson of the last decades is that - capitalism has been the true revolutionising force. Even as it serves only itself. How come it is easier for us to imagine the end of all life on earth - an asteroid hitting the planet - than a modest change in our economic order? Perhaps the time has come to set our possibilities straight - and to become realists by way of demanding - what appears as impossible in the economic domain. The surprising explosion of Occupy Wall Street protests - the mass mobilisation in Greece - the crowds on Tahrir square - they all bear witness for the hidden potential for a different future. There is no guarantee that this future will arrive. No train of history on which we simply have to take a ride. It depends on us, on our will. In revolutionary upheavals some energy - or rather some utopian dreams take place, they explode - and even if the actual result of a social upheaval is just a - commercialised every day life, this excess of energy, - what gets lost in the result, persists not in reality, but - as a dream haunting us waiting to be redeemed. In this sense, whenever we are engaged in radical emancipatory politics - we should never forget as Walter Benjamin put it - almost a century ago - that every revolution, if it is an authentic revolution, - is not only directed towards the future - but it redeems also the past failed revolutions. All the ghosts as it were; the living dead of the past revolution - which are roaming around, unsatisfied will finally - find their home in the new freedom. From transcript to subtitle: TJL and tom_elkrider I may be freezing to death but you'll never get rid of me. All the ice in the world cannot kill a true idea. Tony Brooks: CAMERAS ARE ROLLING ON EVERY WORD AND MOVEMENT OF THE WEST MEMPHIS MURDER TRIALS AS REPORTERS SCURRY TO GET THE STORY. BUT AS DEIRDRE KOON REPORTS, THE CREW BEHIND ONE CAMERA ISN'T CHASING A STORY. THEY'RE CREATING A COMMENT ON SOCIETY. Deirdre Koon: THIS IS THE SCENE AT THE CORNING COURTHOUSE-- THE DEFENSE, THE PROSECUTION, AND THIS FILM CREW GETTING READY FOR THE DAY AHEAD. THESE NEW YORK FILMMAKERS SPENT THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS GETTING TO INTIMATELY KNOW THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE CASE. THE FILMMAKERS ARE CONSIDERING CALLING THE DOCUMENTARY "PARADISE LOST." THEY EXPECT IT TO AIR ON HBO IN ABOUT A YEAR. Woman: IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT FOLLOWING THE HBO DOCUMENTARIES, - THE "PARADISE LOST" DOCUMENTARIES. - YES. - .THERE BECAME SORT OF A PUBLIC-- - THAT'S-- LET ME FINISH MY QUESTION, I'M SORRY-- THERE BECAME SORT OF A PUBLIC DEBATE OR CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHETHER THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE - HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY CONVICTED? - YES. AND THAT PUBLIC CONTROVERSY-- AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY THE DOCUMENTARIES, BUT THAT PUBLIC CONTROVERSY REALLY DID EXPAND TO BE A NATIONAL CONTROVERSY? RIGHT. IT'S ALMOST A CAUSE. Mark Byers: LAST TIME WE SAW THEM, THE THREE BOYS WERE RIDING BIKES TOGETHER, AND THEY HEADED DOWN TOWARDS A WOODED AREA AT THE END OF THE STREET, WHICH WAS ABOUT 6:30 YESTERDAY EVENING. AND THEY'RE ALWAYS IN THE HOUSE BEFORE DARK. NONE OF THE THREE HAVE EVER BEEN MISSING OR TAKEN OFF EVER BEFORE. Male reporter: WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AS A PARENT? I'M SCARED TO DEATH. THAT'S, YOU KNOW, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. I'M SCARED FOR THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF ALL THREE BOYS AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP THAT ANYONE WOULD GIVE US IN RECOVERING OUR THREE SONS. * WELCOME TO WHERE TIME STANDS STILL * * NO ONE LEAVES AND NO ONE WILL. * GREEN ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE THERE, RED ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE. * DREAM THE SAME THING EVERY NIGHT * * I SEE OUR FREEDOM IN MY SIGHTS. * Man over radio: Don't let nobody come up here. Don't let nobody in here. * MY BRAIN SEEM SCARRED * * SLEEP, MY FRIEND, AND YOU WILL SEE * * THE DREAM IS MY REALITY * * THEY KEEP ME LOCKED UP IN THIS CAGE * * CAN'T THEY SEE IT'S WHY MY BRAIN SAYS * * "RAGE"? * SANITARIUM * LEAVE ME BE * SANITARIUM * JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. ( wailing ) * BUILD MY FEAR OF WHAT'S OUT THERE * * CANNOT BREATHE THE OPEN AIR. * Jenna Newton: WEST MEMPHIS INVESTIGATORS CONTINUE TO TRACK DOWN LEADS IN THE CASE, BUT THEY STILL HAVE NO SUSPECTS. WE'VE GOT 28,000-30,000 PEOPLE IN WEST MEMPHIS. AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, EVERYBODY'S A SUSPECT. Diana Davis: INSTEAD OF LETTING THEIR KIDS WALK HOME FROM SCHOOL, PARENTS STARTED PICKING THEM UP. Jenna Newton: AND IN THIS MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD, PEOPLE WONDER WHY NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR THE MURDERS. Diana Davis: THE REWARD FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CONVICTION OF THE KILLER OR KILLERS HAS SKYROCKETED AND IS NOW AT $25,000. ALL OF WEST MEMPHIS-- ALL OF WEST MEMPHIS IS JUST TORN UP. ( child crying ) GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE VAN. Male reporter: PEOPLE IN WEST MEMPHIS GATHERED IN CHURCH TODAY TO COUNT THEIR BLESSINGS AFTER AN EMOTIONAL WEEK CAPPED BY THE ARRESTS. FOR MORE THAN A MONTH, THE SAVAGE MURDERS OF STEVE BRANCH, CHRIS BYERS, AND MICHAEL MOORE HAD NAGGED PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE. Jenna Newton: AT A PRESS CONFERENCE, INSPECTOR GARY GITCHELL SAID THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED TEENS IS VERY STRONG. Man: ON THE SCALE FROM ONE TO 10, HOW SOLID DO YOU THINK THE CASE IS? 11. ( laughter, applause ) JESSIE MISSKELLEY, DAMIEN ECHOLS, AND JASON BALDWIN ARE NOW CONVICTED KILLERS. Judge Burnett: DO YOU HAVE ANY LEGAL REASON TO SHOW THE COURT OR GIVE THE COURT AT THIS TIME AS TO WHY SENTENCE SHOULD NOT BE IMPOSED? - BECAUSE I'M INNOCENT. - PARDON? BECAUSE I'M INNOCENT. ( crossing bells ringing ) MICHAEL WAS KIND OF LIKE-- KIND OF LIKE BART SIMPSON. HE HAD A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR. HE COULD MAKE YOU LAUGH NO MATTER HOW DEPRESSED YOU WAS, NO MATTER HOW BAD THINGS WERE GOING. HE ALWAYS WANTED EVERYBODY TO BE IN A GOOD MOOD. AND HE-- HE COULD MAKE ANYBODY LAUGH. HE'D COME UP WITH THE SILLIEST THINGS. I DAMN SURE MISS HIM. Terry Hobbs: STEVIE WAS A FINE BOY. HE WAS. WE GAVE HIM A NICE HOME, WE FELT LIKE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE SAD THAT THIS-- YOU KNOW, THIS HAS HAPPENED. WE'RE SAD THAT HE'S GONE. I ALWAYS SAID THAT CHRISTOPHER WAS A GIFT, THAT CHRISTOPHER WAS MY GIFT. I HAVE ASKED GOD "WHY?" YOU KNOW? "IF YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE HIM, WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE HIM WHEN HE WAS TINY?" YOU KNOW? "WHY DID IT--?" YOU KNOW, "WHY DID YOU LET ME LOVE HIM FOR EIGHT YEARS?" DAMIEN ECHOLS, JASON BALDWIN, JESSIE MISSKELLEY JR., I HOPE YOU ALL BURN IN HELL AND ARE TORMENTED FOR ETERNITY AND A DAY. I COULDN'T EVER PUT INTO WORDS HOW MUCH I HATE YOU. Damien Echols: I KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT I SAY OR DO, THERE ARE STILL GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO WON'T BELIEVE IT, NO MATTER WHAT. BUT I DID NOT KILL THOSE CHILDREN OR ANYBODY ELSE. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. Jason Baldwin: IF I COULD TALK TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS RIGHT NOW, THEY WERE LED TO BELIEVE BY THE POLICE THAT WE'D DONE IT, AND SO I UNDERSTAND IF THEY HATE US, YOU KNOW, HATE ME. BUT I DIDN'T DO IT, YOU KNOW? I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. AND I'M SORRY THAT YOUR KIDS ARE DEAD. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. BUT ALL I ASK IS THAT Y'ALL GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. JUST-- JUST STOP AND THINK AND DON'T LET YOUR EMOTIONS ABOUT IT ALL GET TO YOUR HEAD AND JUST STOP AND THINK AND LOOK BACK AT THE EVIDENCE. AND LOOK WHERE THE EVIDENCE DOES POINT. AND ASK YOURSELF, "NOW WHO DO YOU THINK REALLY DONE IT?" Jessie Misskelley: THEY KNOW THAT THEY GOT THREE INNOCENT PEOPLE LOCKED UP FOR A CRIME THEY DIDN'T COMMIT. I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY. BUT, YOU KNOW, TO ME, I THINK IT'S WRONG, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT AIN'T ABOUT US. IT'S ABOUT THE VICTIMS THEIRSELVES, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? THEY NEED PEACE. THE VICTIM'S FAMILY NEEDS PEACE. AND I THINK THE POLICE OWES THAT TO 'EM. THE FACTS OF THE CRIME SCENE ARE ACTUALLY A PRETTY INTERESTING PART OF THE CASE, BECAUSE THIS CRIME TOOK PLACE IN A WOODED AREA. IT WAS NEAR TWO MAJOR FREEWAYS. IT HAPPENED RIGHT NEAR A TRUCK STOP, WHICH IS NOW CLOSED. BUT IT WAS A MAJOR TRUCK STOP. PEOPLE WOULD BE IN AND OUT OF THAT TRUCK STOP 24 HOURS A DAY. IT WAS OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY. AND IT ALSO ADJOINED A 24-HOUR-A-DAY TRUCK WASH PLACE. SO THERE WAS-- THERE WAS TRAFFIC IN THAT AREA. Don Horgan: THERE WAS SO MUCH HYSTERIA AROUND THE NATURE OF THE CRIMES. THERE WAS A LOT OF FEAR IN THE COMMUNITY. AND NATURALLY THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON THE POLICE TO FIND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. BUT AS DAYS GO BY, THERE ISN'T-- THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T OBVIOUSLY POINT TO ANY PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL, AGAIN, BECAUSE THERE'S VERY LITTLE LEFT AT THE SCENE. AT ABOUT 6:00 ON MAY THE 5th, CHRIS BYERS, STEVIE BRANCH, AND MICHAEL MOORE WERE LAST SEEN HEADED TOWARD ROBIN HOOD HILLS. Mike Allen: THE PIPE CROSSES 10-MILE BAYOU. THIS IS THE TRAIL THAT GOES ACROSS THE AREA WHICH IS KNOWN AS TURTLE HILL. THE TRAIL WILL EITHER SPLIT AND GO THAT WAY, WHICH LEADS INTO THE AREA OF THE CRIME SCENE, WHICH LAYS RIGHT IN THIS AREA, OR THE TRAIL CONTINUES STRAIGHT FORWARD AND GOES INTO THE BACK END OF BLUE BEACON. I WAS DIRECTED BY AN OFFICER THAT THEY HAD-- HAD FOUND A TENNIS SHOE FLOATING IN A DITCH. I HAD TO GO DOWN TO CROSS TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE TO GET CLOSER AND FELL INTO THE WATER HERE AND CAME UP THE BANK AND AROUND, OVER TO THE AREA WHERE THE TENNIS SHOE WAS. I WALKED AROUND A TREE AND STEPPED OFF INTO THE WATER AND WAS REACHING FOR THE TENNIS SHOE. AND WITH MY FEET I COULD FEEL AN OBJECT. AND I RAISED UP AND I DISCOVERED THIS BODY. John Fogleman: DETECTIVE RIDGE, I BELIEVE THAT YOU'D INDICATED EARLIER SOMETHING ABOUT A STICK IN THE WATER STUCK IN THE WATER? - YES, SIR. - TELL ME ABOUT THAT AGAIN. Ridge: THERE WAS A STICK IN THE WATER THAT HAD A SHIRT AROUND THE END OF IT, AND THAT SHIRT WAS JOBBED DOWN INTO THE MUD WITH THE STICK. EXHIBIT NUMBER 22. YOU KNOW, THE LIGATURE-- THE WAY THAT MICHAEL MOORE WAS TIED AND STEVIE BRANCH WAS TIED WITH LIGATURES, RIGHT HAND TO RIGHT FOOT, LEFT HAND TO LEFT FOOT. AND CHRISTOPHER BYERS'S PENIS HAD BEEN REMOVED. I FOUND HIM TIED AS THE OTHER VICTIMS HAD BEEN TIED. Man: WAS THERE ANY VISIBLE BLOOD FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE? ANY VISIBLE BLOOD? NOT ON THE GROUND. IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE CRIME SCENE AND THE CONDITION OF THE BODIES AND SO FORTH, IT'S ALMOST A BLANK CRIME SCENE. THE BODIES ARE CONCEALED, AND THEN THEY'RE BROUGHT UP, AND THE KIDS ARE HOGTIED WITH SHOELACES, AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF BLOOD AT THE SCENE. SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A PROJECTION SCREEN ON WHICH YOU CAN CREATE ANY KIND OF THEORY ABOUT HOW AND WHY THE CRIME WAS DONE. WELL, RIGHT DOWN HERE WOULD BE THE HOUSE, 1400 EAST BARTON. IT MAKES YOU KIND OF THINK WHAT LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF THIS CRIME HADN'T HAVE HAPPENED. FEARS OF SATANIC CULTS IN CRITTENDEN COUNTY REACHED THEIR PEAK LAST WEEK WHEN THE TEENAGERS WERE ARRESTED. Male reporter: NAMES OF SEVERAL SUSPECTS APPEAR ON RAILROAD TRESTLES ALONG WITH WHAT APPEAR TO BE SATANIC SYMBOLS. PEOPLE FROM SCHOOL THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM SAID THAT HE WAS A DEVIL WORSHIPPER. AND HE DOESN'T WORSHIP THE DEVIL AND HE'S NOT IN ANY CULT. SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, ALL FROM A SENSELESS ACT. Jenna Newton: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, RUMORS BEGIN. WELL, I'VE HEARD THINGS BEFORE ABOUT CULTS AND I REALLY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT, BUT SOME OF THE KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD I'VE TALKED TO SAY THERE IS-- THEY HAD FOUND SOME ANIMALS BACK THERE WHEN THEY PLAYED BACK THERE. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN CUT UP. BOY, IT SURE LOOKS ROUGH-- WINDOWS BOARDED UP, MAN, THE YARD BOARDED UP. DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. David Steinhart: AT SOME TIME, ALL THREE SUSPECTS IN THE WEST MEMPHIS MURDER CASE HAVE LIVED IN THE LAKESHORE TRAILER PARK. RESIDENTS HERE CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN STRANGE, RITUALISTIC MEETINGS AT THE PARK PRIOR TO THE MURDERS. Jenna Newton: JONI DWYER LIVES NEXT DOOR TO JASON BALDWIN. HER THREE BOYS OFTEN PLAYED WITH JASON. BUT THAT ALL CHANGED AFTER HER HUSBAND FOUND SOME DRAWINGS JASON HAD DONE. MY HUSBAND JUST DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE SAW IN THEM DRAWINGS. HE SAID-- YOU KNOW, HE TOLD MY SON, "THIS IS DEVIL WORSHIPPING," THAT, YOU KNOW, HE HAD SNAKES, AND THE SAYINGS THEY HAD. SOME OF THEM WERE IN LATIN AND STUFF. ( door alarm ringing ) A LOT OF MEMORIES. A LOT OF MEMORIES. CHRISTOPHER'S ROOM RIGHT THERE WHERE YOU SEE THE SET OF THREE WINDOWS. THIS HOUSE AND THE MOORES' HOUSE-- I WOULD SAY, THE MAJORITY OF THE PAST 17 YEARS, THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN EMPTY. YOU COULD HAVE PEOPLE-- THEY'RE GONNA GO, "OH, THE HOUSE IS CURSED," OR "THAT'S WHERE THE LITTLE BOY LIVED THAT THE DEVIL WORSHIPPERS KILLED." THE PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT INTO THE PROPAGANDA THAT THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE MEDIA PUT FORTH-- DEVIL WORSHIPPERS-- BECAUSE OF SOME GRAFFITI AROUND. THEY GOT ON THAT BANDWAGON AND EVERYBODY JUMPED ONBOARD. AND IT WAS HYSTERIA. PEOPLE WOULDN'T LET THEIR CHILDREN OUT. Joe Berlinger: YOU JUMPED ON THAT BANDWAGON, TOO. OH, I LED THE BANDWAGON. "YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I SHALL FEAR NO EVIL." AND I'M NOT SCARED OF THE DEVIL. I KNOW WHO MY COMFORTER IS. THESE THREE ANIMALS WORSHIPPING THE DEVIL MADE A SACRIFICE OF THREE BABIES TO SATAN, TO THINK THAT IT WOULD EMPOWER THEM TO FLY, WALK THROUGH WALLS. YOU KNOW, WHAT INSANITY. WE DID A LITTLE GRAFFITI, LIKE SPRAY-PAINT ON UNDERPASSES, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING SATANIC, ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT WAS JUST LIKE OUR NAMES, OUR FAVORITE BANDS, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THEY SEEM TO PLACE SOME BIG IMPORTANCE ON IT OR SOMETHING. SOME EXPERTS HAVE SAID THAT THE MAIN THREE DRIVING FORCES OF SATAN WORSHIP AMONG TEENAGERS IS SEX, DRUGS, AND ROCK 'N' ROLL. AND THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ROCK 'N' ROLL, YOU'RE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT THE HEAVY METAL GROUPS. MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AS IT WAS THEN. THE AREA HAD HAD A RUMORED HISTORY OF DEVIL WORSHIPPING AND THAT TYPE OF THING. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING AROUND THE COUNTRY AT THIS TIME. IN DAMIEN'S CASE, IT WAS THE KIDS THAT CAME IN AND SAID THAT THEY SAW HIM EATING THE HINDQUARTER OF A DOG. BUT THE RUMORS WERE RAMPANT. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ASKED ME TO COME UP WITH A LIST OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAD HAD DEALINGS WITH IN THE JUVENILE DEPARTMENT THAT-- THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. DAMIEN'S NAME WAS MENTIONED VERY EARLY ON BY A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE-- HE-- HE DOES ACT STRANGE. HE WEARS THE BLACK CLOTHING, WHICH CREATES ATTENTION TO HIM. WE WERE TOTALLY UNAWARE THAT THERE WAS A SATANIC CULT IN WEST MEMPHIS, THAT THERE WERE SATAN WORSHIPPERS IN WEST MEMPHIS. I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THIS UNTIL MY CHILD WAS SACRIFICED TO SATAN. THEN I HEARD ABOUT IT. WHY IS IT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW THIS BEFORE? I'M ALL FOR BURNING THEM AT THE STAKE JUST LIKE THEY DID IN SALEM. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT. AFTER WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US, THAT STILL WOULD NOT BE GOOD ENOUGH. GOOD EVENING. I'M DIANA DAVIS. AND I'M TONY BROOKS. IN A STATEMENT GIVEN TO THE POLICE, 17-YEAR-OLD JESSIE MISSKELLEY ALLEGEDLY CONFESSES TO WATCHING TWO OTHER SUSPECTS CHOKE, RAPE, AND SEXUALLY MUTILATE THREE WEST MEMPHIS SECOND-GRADERS. Jenna Newton: MISSKELLEY TOLD POLICE HE WATCHED 18-YEAR-OLD DAMIEN ECHOLS AND 16-YEAR-OLD JASON BALDWIN BRUTALIZE THE CHILDREN AS PART OF A CULT RITUAL. CAN YOU JUST SAY AGAIN HOW STRONG YOU FEEL THIS CASE IS? SOMEONE ASKED ME ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO 10. AND I TOLD THEM, "11." SO THAT'S HOW STRONG IT IS. Jenna Newton: GRAPHIC DETAILS HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRINTED IN TODAY'S "COMMERCIAL APPEAL." JESSIE MISSKELLEY JR., IS ONE OF THREE OF THE MURDER SUSPECTS. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. HE'S NOT THAT TYPE OF BOY. MISSKELLEY, SR., DISPUTES A CONFESSION ALLEGEDLY MADE BY HIS SON AND QUOTED IN TODAY'S NEWSPAPER. THE PAPER DOESN'T MENTION HOW IT OBTAINED YOUNG MISSKELLEY'S STATEMENT. AN UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN CALLED ACTION NEWS 5 LAST FRIDAY OFFERING TO SELL US THE TRANSCRIPT FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. WE DECLINED BECAUSE WE DO NOT PAY FOR NEWS STORIES. Man: THE MISSKELLEY CONFESSION GOT LEAKED TO THE PRESS. - YOU DIDN'T LEAK IT, DID YOU? - NO. AND WAS THAT AN ITEM OF CONCERN TO YOU AT THE TIME? NOT REALLY. Jenna Newton: ECHOLS, BALDWIN, AND MISSKELLEY PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO THREE COUNTS EACH OF CAPITAL MURDER. David Steinhart: MISSKELLEY WILL BE THE FIRST OF THREE DEFENDANTS TRIED FOR THE MURDERS OF THREE WEST MEMPHIS BOYS EARLIER THIS YEAR. Jenna Newton: THE JUDGE SETS ONE TRIAL DATE FOR LATE FEBRUARY AND RULES ECHOLS AND BALDWIN WILL BE TRIED TOGETHER. Woman: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT THE PRESS COVERAGE WAS LIKE? OH, IT WAS ANYTHING YOU WOULD SEE TODAY DEALING WITH A MAJOR CELEBRITY. I MEAN, IT-- LOOK AT THE MICHAEL JACKSON COVERAGE. THAT'S THE KIND OF COVERAGE WE WERE GETTING. Woman: AND THAT SORT OF COVERAGE WAS AT THE TIME OF THE MURDERS, - BUT ALSO CONTINUING THROUGH THE TRIALS? - YES. Male reporter: REPORTERS HAVE WRITTEN THOUSANDS OF STORIES ABOUT THESE TWO TRIALS. ON K.A.I.T. ALONE, OUR VIEWERS HAVE SEEN MORE THAN 130 STORIES ABOUT THE THREE DEFENDANTS. Female reporter: THE ATTORNEYS WILL BE LOOKING FOR JURORS WHO CAN PUT ASIDE THE THINGS THEY'VE HEARD IN THE MEDIA AND MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THE FACTS AS THEY ARE PRESENTED IN THE TRIAL. THIS CASE POSES A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT: ON ONE SIDE-- THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL; THE OTHER SIDE-- THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW. I DO RECALL BEING ASKED A SPECIFIC QUESTION BY THE MEDIA ONCE OF HOW I FELT THIS CASE WAS BETWEEN A ONE AND A 10, AND I MADE A DUMB REMARK OF "11." AND YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IN MIND THE ATMOSPHERE AT THAT TIME. WE WERE 30 DAYS INTO THE CASE WHEN AN ARREST WAS MADE. THERE WAS A LOT OF BURDEN TAKEN OFF OF EVERYONE THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THAT CASE. WE FELT LIKE WE HAD A VERY SOLID CASE. Woman: IF YOU HAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN, WOULD YOU HAVE MADE THE COMMENT ABOUT 11 ON A ONE-OUT-OF-10 SCALE? Gitchell: I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE. IN SIX MONTHS FROM NOW, WHEN THE TRIAL'S ALL OVER, I'LL BE WITH MY PARENTS AGAIN AND MY FAMILY. AND EVERYTHING WILL BE HAPPY, THE WAY IT WAS. BUT I'M SCARED ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF THEY DID FIND ME GUILTY. BUT I KNOW THEY CAN'T. BUT THEN AGAIN, THEY MIGHT. I JUST DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. THE DAY HE GOT ARRESTED, NO ONE CALLED ME. AND I GOT HOME AND THERE WERE POLICE GOING ALL THROUGH MY HOUSE. AND I KEPT ASKING WHERE MY SON WAS. THEY GAVE ME THAT TESTIMONY OF JESSIE'S THAT SAID THAT IT HAPPENED DURING THE DAY AND THAT JASON HAD SKIPPED SCHOOL. I HAD PROOF THAT JASON WAS IN SCHOOL AND THAT IT WAS A LIE. BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER TO GITCHELL. THEY ALREADY HAD HIM IN THE COURTROOM BEFORE I COULD GET UP THERE WITH HIS SCHOOL RECORDS. AND I HAD TO FIGHT MY WAY THROUGH A CROWD. MA'AM, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE REPORTS THIS MORNING OF YOUR SON'S INVOLVEMENT IN THIS THING? HE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. - WAS HE AT SCHOOL? - Mr. Grinnell: HE WAS AT SCHOOL. - THE WHOLE DAY? - THE WHOLE DAY. Gail Grinnell: HE WAS NOT THERE. AND I WAS IN SHOCK-- TOTAL SHOCK. I FIRST MET JASON THE MORNING OF HIS VERY FIRST APPEARANCE AT THE WEST MEMPHIS MUNICIPAL COURT. Paul Ford: MY IMPRESSIONS OF JASON ARE THAT HE APPEARED VERY SHY AND VERY TIMID. HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AN ANGRY YOUNG MAN. HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A VIOLENT YOUNG MAN. HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A MAN WHO IS CAPABLE OF A HEINOUS ACT FOR WHICH HE'S CHARGED. Joe Berlinger: HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET? - AT SCHOOL. - YEAH, I THINK SO. IN A STUDY HALL. I HAD, LIKE, A BOOK BAG FULL OF TAPES. I USED TO TRY TO STEAL THEM. ( laughs ) WE DID ABOUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER BEFORE WE GOT ARRESTED, USED TO GO TO PLACES ON THE WEEKENDS. TO MALLS. John Philipsborn: MY CLIENT JASON BALDWIN WAS ESSENTIALLY INVESTIGATED MAINLY ON THE BASIS THAT HE HUNG OUT AROUND DAMIEN ECHOLS AND WAS KNOWN TO BE A GOOD FRIEND OF HIS. JASON WAS DAMIEN'S CONSTANT SHADOW. WHEREVER DAMIEN WENT, JASON WENT. GUILT BY ASSOCIATION. IT'S A SCARY THING TO BE ACCUSED OF SOMETHING BECAUSE OF YOUR FRIENDS. WHY EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS JASON WAS BECAUSE HE HUNG OUT WITH DAMIEN. AND WHY DID EVERYBODY THINK IT WAS DAMIEN? 'CAUSE HE WAS THE-- HE WAS THE GUY WHO HAD THE WEIRD SUIT. MY SON WORE BLACK. THEY WEREN'T PROSECUTED BECAUSE THEY-- THEY WORE BLACK T-SHIRTS OR LIKED HEAVY METAL MUSIC. Joe Berlinger: CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THAT DAY WHEN THEY BROUGHT YOU IN FOR-- YOU KNOW, FOR QUESTIONING, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, LATER ON EVERYBODY WAS ARRESTED? CAN YOU TALK TO US WHAT IT WAS LIKE? THEY JUST ASKED ME WHO DID IT. AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHO DID IT, YOU KNOW. THEY KEPT-- THE POLICE KEPT ON ASKING ME WHO DID IT AND I TOLD THEM I DIDN'T KNOW, WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, I TOLD-- I TOLD THE POLICE WHERE I WAS AT THAT DAY. I WAS IN DYESS, ARKANSAS, WRESTLING, WHICH I WAS. I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO KEEP ON ASKING ME QUESTIONS AND I DONE TOLD THEM ONCE. YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE ASKING ME AND ASKING ME AND ASKING ME. YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA TELL YOU ONE TIME. AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU JUST EGG IT ON, THEN I'M GONNA JUST SAY SOMETHING JUST TO LEAVE ME ALONE. YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S WHAT I DID. AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST-- THEY JUST EGGED IT ON. AND FINALLY I JUST TOLD THE COPS, "LOOK, YOU KNOW, ALL RIGHT, I DID IT, YOU KNOW. I KILLED THEM AND EVERYTHING." - ( phone rings ) - Man: HELLO. Woman: Operator. I have a collect call. Your name, please? - Jessie: Jessie. - Woman: Will you pay? - YES, MA'AM. - Thank you. - HEY, SON. - Hey. HOW ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S GOOD. OH, HELL, YES. IT SNOWED LIKE HELL UP HERE. GOT ABOUT 3 INCHES OF SNOW OUT HERE ON THE GROUND NOW. Yeah? IT DIDN'T? WELL, IT IS HERE, I GUARANTEE YOU. Woman over radio: Go ahead. Jessie: YOU KNOW, I TALK TO MY DAD EVERY FRIDAY. I CALL HIM EVERY FRIDAY. "I WANT YOU TO COME HOME, SON." YOU KNOW, HE TELLS ME THAT ALL THE TIME. HE TELLS ME HE LOVES ME. OF COURSE I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW, I LOVE HIM. I LOVE HIM TO DEATH, YOU KNOW. I'M TRYING TO GET HOME TO BE WITH HIM. Jessie Sr.: SO DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT-- THAT HAPPENED, THE WAY THE POLICE TREATED YOU UP HERE IN THAT QUESTIONING? YEAH, I KNOW. MIKE ALLEN ASKED MY DAD, COULD HE TALK TO ME? AND MY DAD SAID, "WELL, SURE, YOU CAN TALK TO HIM." SO I GOT IN THE COP CAR WITH HIM AND WE RODE TO WEST MEMPHIS. MIKE ALLEN ASKED ME, WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF I KNEW WHO DONE IT? THAT WAY I COULD BUY MY DAD A TRUCK. 'CAUSE AT THE TIME, I THINK, THE REWARD WAS LIKE $30,000. I SAID YES, I COULD USE THAT-- YOU KNOW, THAT MONEY-- THE REWARD MONEY, BUT I-- YOU KNOW, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHO DONE IT, THOUGH. Younger Gitchell: OUR INTENTIONS FOR WANTING TO TALK TO JESSIE MISSKELLEY WERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING US SOME NAMES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HE MAY KNOW FIRSTHAND OF OR EVER HEARD OF WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE CULT ACTIVITY OR SATANISM. IN THE COURSE OF WHAT WAS A VERY LONG DAY OF INTERVIEWING, JESSIE MISSKELLEY GOES FROM BEING A SOURCE OF INFORMATION TO BEING A SUSPECT WHO HAS, ACCORDING TO THE TAPE-RECORDED STATEMENTS, CONFESSED TO INVOLVEMENT IN THIS CRIME. ( recorder clicks ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, THIS STATEMENT THAT MR. MISSKELLEY GAVE TO THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT IS A FALSE STORY. Dan Stidham: NO ONE IN 1993 UNDERSTOOD THE PHENOMENON OF FALSE CONFESSIONS. WE NOW KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THE POLICE TAKE A KID OFF THE STREET, INTERROGATE HIM FOR 12 HOURS, AND YET ONLY HAVE 41 MINUTES OF AUDIOTAPE TO SUPPORT THIS SO-CALLED CONFESSION. Jessie: WELL, IN A YEAR FROM NOW, HOPEFULLY I CAN BE OUT AND BE WITH MY FAMILY. I'LL HOPEFULLY BE MARRIED TO SUSIE. HOPEFULLY I'LL HAVE A KID. YOU KNOW, I LOVE KIDS A LOT. I THINK I'LL HAVE SOME. Younger Dan Stidham: JESSIE IS MILDLY RETARDED. IT'S MUCH EASIER TO GET A CONFESSION OUT OF SOMEONE WHO IS 17 AND OPERATING AT MAYBE A FIVE- OR SIX-YEAR-OLD LEVEL OF INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING THAN IT IS SOMEONE WHO GRADUATED FROM HARVARD. THE POLICE, YOU KNOW-- THEY QUESTIONED ME FOR, LIKE, 11 OR 12 HOURS. AND FINALLY I JUST GOT TIRED, YOU KNOW? MY MIND WAS, YOU KNOW, DRAINING ME OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I COULDN'T-- I COULDN'T FOCUS NO MORE. MY BODY WAS DRAINING. I WANTED TO GO HOME AND BE WITH MY DAD. YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A REAL, BONA FIDE, VALUABLE CONFESSION AND A FALSE CONFESSION BY LOOKING AT HOW WELL DO THE THINGS THE SUSPECT TELLS YOU STACK UP WITH THE OBJECTIVE FACTS OF THE CRIME? AND WHAT JESSIE MISSKELLEY TALKED ABOUT DOESN'T STACK UP TO WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS. Don Horgan: WITH, YOU KNOW, PERSISTENT POLICE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONING, HE KEEPS MOVING THE TIME OF THE OFFENSES LATER AND LATER IN THE DAY UNTIL FINALLY, WITH LEADING QUESTIONS, THE POLICE GET THEM-- GET JESSIE TO PLACE THE TIME OF THE CRIMES AFTER THE TIME THE KIDS DISAPPEARED. Jessie: IT WAS MY VOICE THAT YOU HEARD. I WAS SAYING WHAT THE POLICE WANTED ME TO SAY. EVERYTHING THAT I SAID REALLY CAME FROM THE POLICE LIKE, "WELL, YOU TOLD ME EARLIER SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND THIS AND THAT." THAT'S WHEN I SAID, "OKAY." THAT'S WHEN I REPEATED WHAT THEY SAID. A LOT OF GOOD COPS ARE GONNA PRESS HARD TO TRY TO GET AN ANSWER TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR A TERRIBLE CRIME. SO, CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, PUSHING HARD-- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH PUSHING HARD. IT'S HAVING YOUR END IN MIND SO FIXED AND YOU'RE SO DETERMINED TO ENSURE THAT A PARTICULAR PERSON BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR A CRIME, THAT YOU LOSE SIGHT OF-- OF, YOU KNOW, HOW COERCIVE YOUR TACTICS ARE. THAT'S WHERE YOU-- YOU STEP OVER THE LINE. AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR THEY OVERREACHED WITH JESSIE MISSKELLEY. THE PRESENCE OF FALSE CONFESSIONS AND HOW FREQUENTLY THEY PLAY A KEY ROLE IN SECURING CONVICTIONS FOR THE PROSECUTION-- IT'S BEEN VERY WELL-DOCUMENTED NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE. AND IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND IT'S GONE ON FOR DECADES. BUT IT'S ONLY NOW THAT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO REALLY, YOU KNOW, UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THAT PROBLEM. I SAID WHAT THE POLICE WANTED ME TO SAY. THAT'S THE REASON WHY I SAID THAT. WAS IT TRUE? NO, IT WAS NOT TRUE. DID I RUN ANYBODY DOWN? NO, I DID NOT. I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY. I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE. I HAVE NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF. ALL RIGHT, YOUR VERDICTS ARE IN GOOD FORM AND READ AS FOLLOWS: "WE THE JURY, HAVING FOUND JESSIE LLOYD MISSKELLEY JR., GUILTY OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEATH OF MICHAEL MOORE, FIX HIS SENTENCE AT A TERM OF LIFE IN THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. COUNT TWO-- WE THE JURY, HAVING FOUND JESSIE LLOYD MISSKELLEY GUILTY OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEATH OF STEVEN BRANCH, FIX HIS SENTENCE AT A TERM OF 20 YEARS IN THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. COUNT THREE-- WE THE JURY, HAVING FOUND JESSIE LLOYD MISSKELLEY JR., GUILTY OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEATH OF CHRISTOPHER BYERS, FIX HIS SENTENCE AT A TERM OF 20 YEARS IN THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS." IS THIS YOUR UNANIMOUS VERDICT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? - YES. - ALL RIGHT, YOU WILL RECEIVE A LIFE SENTENCE PLUS 40 YEARS. AND THAT WILL BE THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT. PRISON'S NOT A SAFE PLACE, JESSIE, SWEETIE. I'M GONNA MAIL HIM A SKIRT. ONE DOWN, TWO TO GO. HOPEFULLY THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN TO THE NEXT TWO AND WE'LL GET THE SAME VERDICT. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'D HAVE YOUR CLIENTS STAND, PLEASE. MR. BALDWIN AND MR. ECHOLS, IF YOU'D STAND. IN YOUR CASE, MR. BALDWIN, YOU'LL BE ADJUDICATED GUILTY OF THREE COUNTS OF CAPITAL MURDER. YOU'LL BE SENTENCED TO THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO A TERM OF LIFE WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE ON EACH OF THE THREE COUNTS. DAMIEN ECHOLS SHALL BE SENTENCED TO DEATH BY LETHAL INJECTION. YOU'LL BE ADMINISTERED A CONTINUOUS INTRAVENOUS INJECTION OF A LETHAL QUANTITY OF AN ULTRA SHORT-ACTING BARBITURATE IN COMBINATION WITH A CHEMICAL PARALYTIC AGENT - INTO YOUR BODY UNTIL YOU ARE DEAD. - ( woman sobbing ) IT'S MY OBLIGATION TO LET YOU KNOW YOU DO HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL, AND YOU NEED TO CONSIDER THAT WITH YOUR ATTORNEYS. HE'LL BE IN YOUR CUSTODY, MR. SHERIFF, FOR IMMEDIATE TRANSPORTATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO CARRY OUT THE ORDERS OF THIS COURT. Male reporter: QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER JUSTICE WAS SERVED HAS LOOMED IN THIS CASE SINCE THE VERDICTS. THE HBO DOCUMENTARY "PARADISE LOST" GAVE THE CASE WORLDWIDE ATTENTION. SINCE THE FILMS, THOUSANDS ARE QUESTIONING THE CONVICTIONS. 16 YEARS AGO, I BELIEVE, I SAW THE DOCUMENTARY "PARADISE LOST." IT WAS ON HBO. I GOT INVOLVED IN THE CASE THINKING THAT THERE WAS MAYBE SOME WAY I COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY DAMIEN ECHOLS WAS TREATED AS A TEENAGER THAT YOU CAN RELATE TO? I CAN REMEMBER BEING KIND OF LOOKED UPON AS A FREAK OR, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T DRESS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. SO I CAN EMPATHIZE WITH BEING JUDGED BY HOW YOU LOOK AS OPPOSED TO WHO YOU ARE. - I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING, IF YOU DON'T MIND. - Woman: SURE. I WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN WITH SOME PEOPLE THAT I HAVE HEARD MAKE STATEMENTS, THAT ARE IN THE PUBLIC EYE, AND ACTUALLY TALK TO THEM AND SAY, "THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED THAT WAS NOT SHOWN ON THE DOCUMENTARY." AND I THINK THEY'D HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING. - BUT ALL THAT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. - YES, IT HAS. IT MAY NOT HAVE SHOWN UP IN THE DOCUMENTARIES OR IN A PARTICULAR NEWS REPORT OR A SPEECH BY SOMEONE, BUT IT IS PUBLIC RECORD. MOST ANYONE CAN MAKE THE PROPER CONTACTS AND VIEW THAT-- THAT INFORMATION. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ANY CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES CAN COME DOWN AND SIT IN THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT AND LOOK THROUGH MOST OF THAT EVIDENCE. AM I CORRECT? Gitchell: THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND. SO THERE'S NOT A SECRET BAG OR POCKET OF INFORMATION THAT THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT OR THE PROSECUTORS HAVE THAT CONVINCES THEM THAT THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE ARE GUILTY, BUT THAT THE REST OF THE PUBLIC CAN'T KNOW. RIGHT, THERE'S NO-- THERE'S NO SECRET IN THERE WHATSOEVER. IT'S JUST-- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, IT'S THE PERCEPTION PEOPLE RECEIVED FROM THE MEDIA AND HBO. I SAW THE MOVIE. I GOT AN ADVANCE SCREENER BECAUSE I WORK FOR AN ADVERTISING AGENCY. WE SAW THE FILM TOGETHER, KATHY AND I, AND WE IMMEDIATELY SAW IT AND SAID, "OH, GOSH, BURK WOULD PROBABLY LIKE THIS." ( laughter ) ACTUALLY NOT LIKE IT, BUT-- HE CALLED US UP AND HE SAYS, "THESE GUYS ARE INNOCENT." WE START CONTACTING THE LAWYERS, 'CAUSE YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW MORE. AND WE'RE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT NOTHING WAS GETTING DONE, THEY WERE JUST LANGUISHING THERE. IT WAS HORRIBLE. AND SO WE WERE LIKE, "WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO? WE WORK IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. WE CAN DESIGN THINGS." AND THEN YOU SAY, "WELL, WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THAT?" WE'RE LIKE, "WE CAN MAKE A WEBSITE." Male reporter: ECHOLS HAS HIS BACKERS. A WEBSITE IS NOW ONLINE TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE THREE MEN CONVICTED OF KILLING THE WEST MEMPHIS EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS. WE'RE NOT EXPERTS OURSELVES, BUT WE'VE HIRED EXPERTS TO LOOK INTO THE CASE FOR US BECAUSE THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH DOUBT. Burk Sauls: ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS THAT I CAN REMEMBER ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING AND ABOUT OUR TRIPS OUT HERE IS I REMEMBER BEING IN A RENTAL CAR LIKE THIS, HEADING OUT TO THE PRISON. AND I REMEMBER SAYING, "CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP IN PRISON FOR THREE WHOLE YEARS?" AND HERE WE ARE, 17 YEARS LATER, HEADING TO PINE BLUFF TO VISIT OUR FRIENDS AGAIN IN 2011. ALL RIGHT. Kathy Bakken: HERE WE ARE. I DON'T LIKE BEING HERE AGAIN, BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE THESE GUYS. ( gate buzzes ) - Sauls: WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. - Bakken: JUST THANK EVERYBODY. Sauls: THIS WILL BE SHORT. Jason: THERE'S NOT LIKE AN "ACTION" OR NOTHING? - Sauls: ACTION. - Bakken: GO. HI. MY NAME IS-- HI. MY NAME IS JASON BALDWIN. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE SUPPORTERS, ALL OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE WRITTEN ME OVER THE YEARS, WHO'VE RESEARCHED THE CASE, DID THEIR-- YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS IN YOUR MEANS-- THAT DID YOUR BEST, YOU KNOW, TO LET ME, DAMIEN AND JESSIE AND OUR FAMILIES KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED TO US WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN AND IT'LL BE MADE RIGHT. Younger Jason: AMERICA'S SUPPOSED TO BE BASED ON "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY," BUT IN THIS CASE, IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND-- YOU'RE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. I NEVER WOULD HAVE DREAMED THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME. Announcer: NOW LIVE FROM THE MID-SOUTH NEWS LEADER. Male reporter: CONVICTED WEST MEMPHIS CHILD MURDERER DAMIEN ECHOLS GIVES AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW TO ACTION NEWS 5. I THINK IF IT WAS-- IF THEY WERE CAPABLE, THE PUBLIC WOULD PROBABLY FORM A LYNCH MOB AND COME GET ME. Male reporter: DAMIEN ECHOLS SAYS HE WAS RAILROADED BY THE POLICE, PROSECUTORS, AND THE JUDGE. Judge Burnett: MR. ECHOLS, YOU ARE REMANDED TO THE CUSTODY. Male reporter: IT'S BEEN PAINFUL FOR THE MOTHER AND STEPFATHER OF STEVIE BRANCH TO WATCH DAMIEN ECHOLS. THEY'D PREFER HE GET NO ATTENTION. I'M GLAD HE'S IN PAIN AND MISERABLE AND ALL THAT. I'M GLAD HE'S JUST SO MESSED UP AND-- AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PRISON KILL HIM. I WAS A STEP-PARENT BACK IN 1993 WHEN THIS HAPPENED. I WAS A GOOD STEP-PARENT. AND TO WATCH IT ALL GO AWAY ON ACCOUNT OF THIS, YOU LOSE YOUR LIFE TO A DEGREE. YOU CAN SAY I SORT OF LIKE DIED MYSELF BECAUSE I SHUT OUT HUMANITY. STEVE'S DEATH WAS SO DIFFICULT FOR PAM TO ACCEPT THAT OTHER PROBLEMS RESULTED. SHE SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND AND MOVED HERE TO HER PARENTS' HOME IN BLYTHEVILLE. A CRIME OF THIS NATURE WILL TAKE A TOLL ON ANYBODY. AND I HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN TO OUR HOME. TOMORROW, 19-YEAR-OLD DAMIEN ECHOLS'S ATTORNEYS WILL FILE WITH THE COURT THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM ECHOLS'S TRIAL-- MORE THAN 4,000 PAGES OF TESTIMONY. THAT WILL SET IN MOTION THE APPEALS PROCESS THAT ECHOLS BELIEVES WILL LEAD TO THE OVERTURNING OF HIS CONVICTION AND SENTENCE. Male reporter: CONVICTED MURDERER DAMIEN ECHOLS APPEARED IN CRAIGHEAD COUNTY COURT FOR THE LATEST HEARING SINCE HIS 1994 CONVICTION. Female reporter: DAN STIDHAM, WHO REPRESENTED JESSIE MISSKELLEY IN THE ORIGINAL TRIAL, SAYS MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING AND KEEP GOING, DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY YEARS IT TAKES. Female reporter: IT WAS ALSO AN EMOTIONAL DAY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES. Pam Hobbs: DAMIEN'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. JUSTICE PREVAILED THE FIRST TIME. I HAVE ALL THE FAITH IN THE WORLD THAT JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL AGAIN AND SOMEDAY I'LL GET TO WATCH DAMIEN ECHOLS DIE. Female reporter: BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO WANT JUSTICE TO PREVAIL. Gail Grinnell: ANYBODY WITH A SET OF EYES CAN SEE THAT THESE BOYS ARE INNOCENT. THEY DID NOT DO IT. AND IF SHE WANTS JUSTICE DONE, SHE NEEDS TO BE TRYING TO GET THIS CASE REOPENED AND FIND THE REAL MURDERERS OF THOSE THREE CHILDREN. EVERY APPEAL THAT HAS COME UP HAS CAUSED GRIEF AND CAUSED PROBLEMS IN THE HOME. IT BRINGS BACK ANGER STILL TODAY TO SEE THEIR PICTURES OR FACES ON THE MEDIA. RELIVING IT IS A NIGHTMARE AT TIMES. Female reporter: DAMIEN ECHOLS STILL WALKS, EVEN THOUGH FOUR YEARS AGO HE WAS SENTENCED TO DIE. Man: ARE YOU HOPING THIS WORKS? YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL. - WHY DON'T YOU THINK IT WILL WORK? - SAME JUDGE. HIS APPEALS HAVE BEEN DENIED TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. NOW TODAY DEFENSE ATTORNEYS DID MAKE A REQUEST THAT JUDGE DAVID BURNETT BE RECUSED FROM HEARING THESE CASES. BUT THAT MOTION WAS QUICKLY DENIED BY THE JUDGE. Female reporter: THE ARKANSAS SUPREME COURT HAS DENIED EVERY APPEAL BY DAMIEN ECHOLS, AND DEFENSE IS COUNTING ON D.N.A. TESTING TO SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE CASE. Terry Hobbs: THIS CASE WAS SOLVED IN 1994. AND ONE DAY IN ARKANSAS THEY'RE GOING TO INJECT DAMIEN ECHOLS, AND HE WILL PAY WITH HIS LIFE FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE TO THREE LITTLE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOYS. A FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST, A BITE MARK EXPERT, A CRIMINAL PROFILER, EVEN A HUMAN BLOOD AND BODY FLUID STAIN SPECIALIST BROUGHT THEIR EXPERTISE HERE TO THE LAW SCHOOL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS IN LITTLE ROCK IN HOPES OF PROVING WHY THE DEFENSE TEAM FOR CONVICTED KILLER DAMIEN ECHOLS SAYS HE IS INNOCENT. GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MY NAME IS DENNIS RIORDAN. WE REPRESENT PETITIONER DAMIEN ECHOLS IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS HERE IN LITTLE ROCK, ARISING OUT OF THE 1994 TRIAL-- TRIALS REALLY-- OF THREE TEENAGERS WHO WERE TRIED AND CONVICTED FOR THE MURDERS OF THREE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOYS. AND WE ARE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE EVIDENCE THAT ESTABLISHES THAT NO REASONABLE JUROR WOULD CONVICT DAMIEN ECHOLS ESSENTIALLY KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW TODAY. THE HEART OF THIS PRESENTATION IS FOUR EXPERTS WHO WE WILL BE CALLING TODAY, WHO PROVIDED THE CORE OF THE NEW EVIDENCE BEFORE THE DISTRICT COURT. THEY ARE: WERNER SPITZ, PROBABLY THE COUNTRY'S LEADING FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST, CERTAINLY THE AUTHOR OF THE BIBLE OF FORENSIC PATHOLOGY; RICHARD SOUVIRON, RENOWNED FORENSIC ODONTOLOGIST WHO WAS THE KEY WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION IN CONVICTING TED BUNDY; TOM FEDOR, WHO IS A D.N.A. EXPERT TO DISCUSS THE NEW D.N.A. EVIDENCE; AND JOHN DOUGLAS, WHO HEADED THE CRIMINAL ANALYSIS UNIT OF THE F.B.I. FOR 25 YEARS. BUT WHAT IS THE NEW EVIDENCE THAT PROVES NOT MERELY THAT THIS WAS AN UNFAIR TRIAL, BUT THAT INNOCENT MEN WERE CONVICTED? AND WITH THAT, I'LL TURN TO MY PARTNER DON HORGAN. GOOD MORNING. I'M GONNA TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO HERE JUST TO REVIEW SOME OF THE D.N.A. EVIDENCE THAT HAS RECENTLY SURFACED IN THE CASE. FIRST WITH A LITTLE BACKGROUND-- IN 2001, ARKANSAS, LIKE A LOT OF OTHER STATES, PASSED A STATUTE THAT ALLOWS CONVICTED CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS TO CHALLENGE THEIR CONVICTIONS WITH NEW D.N.A. EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THEM TO BE ACTUALLY INNOCENT. UNDER THAT STATE STATUTE, RELEVANT ITEMS FROM THE CRIME SCENE IN THIS CASE WERE TESTED AT THE LABORATORY CHOSEN BY THE PROSECUTION, AND THAT'S BODE LABORATORIES IN VIRGINIA. IN LATE 2005, BODE ISSUED ITS FIRST REPORT SHOWING D.N.A. PROFILES OF GENETIC MATERIAL FOUND ON THE VICTIMS AND ON OTHER PIECES OF EVIDENCE FROM THE CRIME SCENE. IN THE END, NONE OF THE BODE REPORTS COULD LINK ANY OF THE D.N.A. PROVIDED BY THE DEFENDANTS TO THE VICTIMS OR TO THE CRIME SCENE. NEW EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED IN WEST MEMPHIS, ARKANSAS. Male reporter: NEW EVIDENCE RELEASED TODAY CLAIMS TESTING UNAVAILABLE IN 1993 SHOWS NO D.N.A. FROM THE THREE IMPRISONED DEFENDANTS WAS FOUND ON THE BODIES OF THE MURDERED BOYS. FOR 14 YEARS, JOHN MARK BYERS WAS CONVINCED HE KNEW WHO TIED UP AND KILLED HIS EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SON AND TWO OTHER CUB SCOUTS IN A BRUTAL MUTILATION MURDER. NOW BYERS AND THE STATE OF ARKANSAS HAVE BEEN SHOWN NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE FATHER TELLS A.B.C. NEWS HAS CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT THE GUILT OF THE THREE BOYS KNOWN AS THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE. I HATED YOU. I BELIEVED WITH ALL MY HEART YOU KILLED MY SON. AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT. THE QUESTION IS WHY AM I SO DIFFERENT NOW THAN YEARS BACK? UH. COMING TO DEAL WITH THINGS, COMING TO DEAL WITH THAT I KNOW I DID ALL I COULD TO KEEP CHRISTOPHER SAFE, THAT IT WASN'T MY FAULT. NO, I WASN'T A PERFECT DAD, BUT I-- I DID THE BEST I COULD. I'M JUST A COUNTRY BOY FROM MARKED TREE. THAT YOU KILL MY SON, YOU MADE ME MADDER THAN HELL AND I WANTED TO KICK SOMEBODY'S ASS. Male reporter: DAMIEN ECHOLS QUIT TALKING TO REPORTERS AFTER GETTING WARNINGS FROM HIS ATTORNEYS. LAST WEEK, ECHOLS SAID MARK BYERS COMMITTED THE MURDERS. DOES IT COME AS A SURPRISE, MARK? Mark Byers: WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENT. HE'S GOT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE AREA. HE KNOWS WHEN THE SEARCH IS OVER WITH. HE'S BIG ENOUGH THAT HE CAN CARRY THE BOYS THERE AND THROW THEM IN. HIS SON WAS THE ONLY ONE MUTILATED. THE OTHER TWO WEREN'T MUTILATED. ALL OF THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER WITH A PERSON LIKE BYERS. Male reporter: AFTER THE SENTENCING, THE MOTHER AND STEPFATHER OF CHRISTOPHER BYERS MOVED OUT OF WEST MEMPHIS. ECHOLS CLAIMS BYERS IS THE REAL KILLER. I THINK BASICALLY IN A FIT OF ANGER HE KILLED THEM. HE'S GOT TO BE THE BIGGEST PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. I HOPE HE ROTS AND BURNS IN HELL FOR ETERNITY. I HATE HIS GUTS MORE THAN ANYTHING ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. MARK AND MELISSA BYERS MOVED TO CHEROKEE VILLAGE TO GET AWAY FROM THE MEMORIES OF THEIR SON'S MURDER IN WEST MEMPHIS. BUT THE TROUBLE FOLLOWED THEM. Jenna Newton: THEY'RE ACCUSED OF TAKING $20,000 WORTH OF PROPERTY FROM A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. BUT THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THEIR LEGAL PROBLEMS. ACCORDING TO COURT DOCUMENTS, MARK BYERS WAS WITH A JUVENILE WHO ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTED ANOTHER YOUNG MAN. BYERS SAYS HE LET THE BOYS FIGHT IN HIS PRESENCE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS A FAIR FIGHT. ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT IS THINKING ABOUT MY SON GETTING BEAT TO DEATH. BYERS STOOD BY WATCHING THE FIGHT HOLDING A GUN. NOW A FEW OF THE BYERS' NEIGHBORS SAY THEY NOW HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT MARK BYERS AND THE WEST MEMPHIS MURDERS. THESE ARE FOR YOU, MELISSA. Male reporter: BYERS'S WIFE DID DIE RECENTLY. AN AUTOPSY SHOWED SMALL AMOUNTS OF DRUGS IN HER BODY, BUT NOTHING THAT SHOULD HAVE CAUSED HER DEATH. SO THAT DEATH REMAINS A MYSTERY. I MADE A GOOD SCAPEGOAT. I MADE A GOOD TARGET. BUT I DIDN'T CARE. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT BUT ME. - BURN, YOU SON OF A BITCH, BURN. - AND I REALLY DIDN'T CARE. - BURN. GO TO HELL. BURN. - I MEAN, DEEP DOWN INSIDE - I KNEW I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY. - I'LL STOMP ON YOUR GRAVE. - I FELT LIKE THE STATE HAD. - I'LL STOMP ON YOUR GRAVE. .WHO THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. BURN AND GO TO HELL! BUT WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THE RIGHT THING IS THAT THESE THREE MEN ARE INNOCENT. THAT'S THE RIGHT THING. AND, YES, IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO STAND UP AND ADMIT THAT I WAS WRONG, BUT WRONG IS WRONG. THIS IS A LETTER FROM DAMIEN ECHOLS, VARNER UNIT, P.O. BOX 400, GRADY, ARKANSAS. "DEAR JOHN, FIRST I WANT TO START OFF BY APOLOGIZING TO YOU. I KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE ACCUSED OF SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO. NOW, ALL THESE YEARS LATER, I SEE JUST HOW WRONG I WAS AND I'M SORRY. I DID THE SAME THING TO YOU THAT EVERYONE ELSE DID TO ME. THE SECOND THING I WANT TO SAY IS THANK YOU. I KNOW IT CAN'T HAVE BEEN EASY TO PUT ASIDE ALL OF YOUR EMOTIONS AND LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE WITH COLD, HARD LOGIC, BUT YOU DID. I CAN'T HELP BUT BELIEVE THERE'S A REASON FOR ALL OF THIS FOR BOTH OF US. TAKE CARE AND KNOW THAT MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU. DAMIEN ECHOLS." HI. Bruce Sinofsky: HOW ARE YOU DOING? I'M DOING GOOD. GLAD YOU CAME BACK. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE THE LAST TIME YOU WHERE HERE? WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT IN THE CAR. - 10 YEARS. - 10 YEARS. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. Damien Echols: TIME IS VERY, VERY STRANGE IN HERE. I'M-- I'M SURPRISED BY THINGS SOMETIMES, I GUESS. LIKE BEING TOLD THAT I HAVE ARTHRITIS OR LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AND REALIZING MY HAIRLINE IS RECEDING, THAT MY HAIR IS GETTING THIN. AND IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE IN A WAY MY LIFE JUST SORT OF STOPPED ABRUPTLY WHENEVER I CAME HERE. DECEMBER THE 11th IT WILL BE MY 35th BIRTHDAY. IT WILL BE THE 17th BIRTHDAY THAT I'VE SPENT IN THIS PRISON. I HAVE A SON WHO IS NOW ALMOST THE SAME AGE I WAS WHENEVER I WAS LOCKED UP. WE WERE ABSOLUTELY POVERTY-STRICKEN WHITE TRASH. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH MURDERING ME IF IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOR WHAT YOU GUYS DID, FOR BEING THERE IN THE VERY BEGINNING AND GETTING THIS WHOLE THING ON TAPE SO THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD SEES WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IF NOT FOR THAT, THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MURDERED ME, SWEPT THIS UNDER THE RUG, AND I WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING BUT A MEMORY RIGHT NOW. Male reporter: A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE NOW STANDING BEHIND THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE SAYING THE MEN CONVICTED OF MURDER ARE INNOCENT: FROM JOHNNY DEPP TO THE DIXIE CHICKS, EVEN A NEW YORK ARCHITECT WHO QUIT HER JOB, MOVED TO LITTLE ROCK, AND MARRIED DEATH ROW INMATE DAMIEN ECHOLS. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CASE-- ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN INVOLVED AND KNOWN DAMIEN FOR NINE YEARS. BUT I'VE BEEN REALLY ACTIVELY WORKING ON THE CASE FOR ABOUT SEVEN. I AM IN LOVE AND VERY LOVED BY A WOMAN-- LORRI, WHO LIVED IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, AT THE TIME THAT "PARADISE LOST" CAME OUT. AND IT HAD A VERY POWERFUL IMPACT ON HER. I HAD TO SORT OF THINK ABOUT THINGS OVERNIGHT. AND I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING JUST KNOWING THOSE KIDS-- THEY DIDN'T DO IT. AND THEN TRYING TO-- IT JUST PLAGUED ME. SHE COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT, SO SHE STARTED TO WRITE TO ME AND I RESPONDED TO THE LETTERS. IN THE COURSE OF WRITING TO DAMIEN, I THINK WE-- THAT'S WHEN WE FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER. IT WAS-- BECAUSE INITIALLY, I THINK, WE-- WE-- WE FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER'S MINDS. BECAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I LOOKED LIKE OR, YOU KNOW-- IT WAS JUST REALLY-- IT WAS JUST WHAT WE WERE THINKING, AND LATER ON, OF COURSE, WHEN WE TALKED TO EACH OTHER. SO THAT WAS-- IT WAS ALREADY A DONE DEAL BY THE TIME I GOT TO ARKANSAS OR WENT TO VISIT HIM IN ARKANSAS. AND THEN I STAYED IN NEW YORK FOR ANOTHER, I THINK, YEAR AND A HALF AFTER I MET HIM BEFORE I MADE THE DECISION TO MOVE. SHE LIVES NOW HERE IN LITTLE ROCK, 45 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE PRISON, JUST SO THAT SHE CAN COME HERE MORE OFTEN. AND NOW WE ARE SET TO BE MARRIED NOVEMBER THE 1st. AND THAT'LL BE A BUDDHIST WEDDING CEREMONY ON NOVEMBER THE 1st. OH, I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET HIM OUT. I THINK IT'S GOING TO-- I THINK THINGS ARE HAPPENING MUCH QUICKER, BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET HIM OUT. INASMUCH AS THE STATE HAS THE BURDEN. ( clears throat ) OF PROOF IN THIS CASE AND INASMUCH AS-- FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE CASE IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL, IT IS NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE THAT THE STATE PROVE MOTIVE IF IT CAN. CALL YOUR NEXT WITNESS. Fogleman: I CALL DALE GRIFFIS. IN LOOKING AT YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE OCCULT, DO YOU SEE ANY PARTICULAR TYPE OF DRESS? I HAVE PERSONALLY OBSERVED PEOPLE WEARING BLACK FINGERNAILS, HAVING THEIR HAIR PAINTED BLACK, WEARING BLACK T-SHIRTS. DOES THE NUMBER THREE-- THREE VICTIMS-- HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANCE? ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL NUMBERS IN-- IN THE PRACTICE OF SATANIC BELIEF WAS 666. AND SOME BELIEVE THE BASE ROOT OF SIX IS THREE. Don Horgan: THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS BEING A SATANIC RITUAL WAS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE STATE'S CASE AT THE TRIAL, BECAUSE THEY CALLED DALE GRIFFIS, WHO HAD ALMOST NO QUALIFICATIONS WHATSOEVER. BUT NONETHELESS HE MAINTAINED THAT ALL THOSE BLANK SPACES, YOU KNOW, THAT ATTACHED TO THE CRIME SCENE WERE THEMSELVES EVIDENCE OF A SATANIC CONNECTION. EVERY ONE OF THESE FILES IS JAM-PACKED FULL OF CASES OR DATA ON PARTICULAR GROUPS AND SO FORTH-- THE THINGS THAT I COULD USE TO EDUCATE OTHER PEOP-- YOU KNOW, THERAPISTS AND EDUCATORS AND POLICEMEN. IT WAS IN THE START OF MY CAREER INTO OCCULTISM-- ABOUT 1985, I BELIEVE. AND THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION OF CASES. Male reporter: Tonight, the startling, sobering results of a "20/20" investigation: Satanism, devil worship is being practiced all across the country. We have all types of perversion going on, and it's affecting America. Male Reporter: Perverse, hideous acts that defy belief. All of them were investigated by police, but usually without much result. Paul Ford: BETWEEN 1982 AND 1984, WHEN YOU BECAME A Ph.D., WHAT CLASSES DID YOU TAKE? - NONE. - NONE. Val Price: JUDGE, I'D JUST LIKE TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT AT THIS POINT ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT. IT'S OUR POSITION THAT, BASED ON A MAIL-ORDER Ph.D. IN WHICH A PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE CLASSES, DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE ANY RESIDENT COURSES FROM A NON-ACCREDITED SCHOOL, DOES NOT QUALIFY HIM AS AN EXPERT IN ARKANSAS. AND WE OBJECT TO THE COURT QUALIFYING DR. GRIFFIS AS AN EXPERT. I'M NOT SURE IN ARKANSAS OR ANY OTHER STATE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANY KIND OF DEGREE TO BE AN EXPERT IN A PARTICULAR FIELD. - THAT'S TRUE-- - IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE KNOWLEDGE, EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, AND TRAINING IN THE FIELD, YOU COULD HAVE A THIRD-GRADE EDUCATION, IF YOU HAVE OTHER EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, AND TRAINING THAT QUALIFIES YOU AS AN EXPERT. SO I'M NOT PERSUADED AT ALL ABOUT YOUR ARGUMENT ABOUT A MAIL-ORDER Ph.D. SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? IN THE EARLY 1970s AND '80s, WE BEGAN TO SEE AT THE F.B.I. ACADEMY POLICE OFFICERS COMING IN FROM AROUND THE WORLD, AND THE COPS WERE KIND OF THROWING AROUND WORDS LIKE "RITUAL" AND USING IT INTERCHANGEABLY WITH SATANIC CRIMES. WE DID A CLOSE EVALUATION AND WE DIDN'T SEE ONE. WE DIDN'T-- WE DIDN'T SEE ONE CASE. Horgan: IF YOU CAN PAINT THESE GUYS AS INVOLVED IN SATANISM, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. AND THE APPARENT CASTRATION OF CHRISTOPHER BYERS FIT INTO THE SATANIC THEORY FOR GRIFFIS AS WELL. Griffis: THEY USED KNIVES TO CUT UP THE THREE BOYS THAT WERE KILLED, THE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOYS. DO THE TYPES OF INJURIES HAVE SIGNIFICANCE? THE REMOVAL OF SEX-- SEX ORGANS-- IN SOME BOOKS ON OCCULTISM, THEY WILL TALK ABOUT REMOVING OF THE TESTICLES FOR THE SEMEN. A LOT OF THE EARLY UNDERSTANDINGS OF THIS CASE WERE REALLY PREMISED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS THERE. AND THE INFORMATION, BY AND LARGE, WAS THERE TO BE SEEN AND INTERPRETED. IT JUST WASN'T LOOKED AT BY THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND IT WASN'T INTERPRETED CORRECTLY. STATE'S EXHIBIT 68A IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF AN ABRASION THAT'S PATTERNED AND HAS, LIKE, A SERRATED APPEARANCE TO IT. AND THAT'S 68A. Brent Davis: HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THAT KNIFE AND EXAMINE THAT KNIFE, SIR? YES. YOU REFERRED IN YOUR TESTIMONY TO WOUND PATTERNS ON THE THREE VICTIMS THAT WERE SERRATED IN NATURE. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY. DID YOU FIND WOUND PATTERNS ON THE THREE VICTIMS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH HAVING BEEN CAUSED BY A KNIFE WITH THAT KIND OF SERRATED PATTERN? THERE ARE INJURIES CONSISTENT WITH THIS TYPE OF SERRATED PATTERN. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, A CRITICAL PROSECUTION THEORY AT THE 1994 TRIALS WAS THAT THE DEFENDANTS USED A SURVIVAL KNIFE TO INFLICT MOST OF THE INJURIES ON THESE VICTIMS AND THAT THEY USED THE KNIFE BEFORE THE CHILDREN DIED. IS IT A COINCIDENCE THIS KNIFE IS FOUND BEHIND-- IN THE LAKE, HIDDEN, BEHIND JASON BALDWIN'S HOUSE? Horgan: THE KNIFE WAS CRITICAL BECAUSE IF IT LOOKED LIKE ONE THAT DAMIEN ECHOLS HAD ONCE OWNED AND IF THE INJURIES TO THESE KIDS WERE CAUSED BY A KNIFE, IT TIED DAMIEN ECHOLS TO-- TO THE CRIME ITSELF. SO IT WAS A KEY LINK IF IT WAS TO BE BELIEVED THAT IT HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN MUTILATING THESE KIDS AND HAD BEEN USED IN, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY CASTRATING CHRISTOPHER BYERS. BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE. GOOD MORNING. I ANALYZED A LOT OF PICTURES. I ANALYZED A LOT OF WRITTEN MATERIAL. IT IS MY OPINION-- OR THE FOLLOWING ARE MY OPINIONS: INJURIES ON THE BODY SURFACE OF ALL THE THREE VICTIMS, THREE BOYS, INCLUDING THE EMASCULATION OF CHRIS BYERS, WERE PRODUCED BY ANIMALS AFTER DEATH. WHEN A DOG OR OTHER CARNIVOROUS ANIMAL ATTACKS A BODY AFTER DEATH, OR BEFORE DEATH SOMETIMES, THEY SCRAPE THE BODY. THEY MOVE THEIR CLAWS ON THE BODY AND TRY TO BRING THE BODY CLOSER TO THEM. THEY DO THIS SEVERAL TIMES. AND YOU HAVE HERE TWO OF THE VICTIMS THAT HAVE THE SAME IDENTICAL INJURY. THEY WERE OBVIOUS CLAW MARKS. THE SPACING AND THE CONFIGURATION OF THOSE INJURIES IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH A SERRATED KNIFE SUCH AS THIS OR, FOR THAT MATTER, ANY KNIFE. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED HAS CHANGED. WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THAT THE LAWYERS ON THE CASE HADN'T GONE TO THE CRIME LABORATORY AND LOOKED METICULOUSLY THROUGH ALL OF THE LABORATORY'S NOTEBOOKS OF WHAT WAS DONE OUT AT THE CRIME SCENE. THE CRIME SCENE TECHS RECOVERED A BUNCH OF ANIMAL HAIR. Dr. Richard Souviron: THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DONE WITH THIS KNIFE. ANIMALS DO THIS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO A BODY THAT'S DUMPED IN A WOODED AREA, IN THE WOODS, IN A CREEK, IN A SWAMP. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET. DOG, COYOTE, FOX, POSSUM-- I'VE SEEN ALL OF THOSE. IT'S A CARNIVORE. COULD IT BE TURTLES THAT HAD DONE THIS, AQUATIC CRABS, FOR INSTANCE? SURE. ANYTHING THAT WOULD EAT FLESH IS WHAT DID THIS. Joe Berlinger: CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ORIGINAL CASE, I MEAN, JUST IN GENERAL TERMS? I MEAN DO YOU THINK IT WAS A SOLID CASE? DO YOU THINK IT WAS A CASE-- I MEAN, DO YOU THINK DAMIEN GOT A FAIR TRIAL? OH, I DON'T-- IN MY MIND, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT ALL THREE RECEIVED A FAIR TRIAL. THE JURY HEARD THE EVIDENCE AND WERE CONVINCED OF GUILT. SO THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, I THINK. A JURY TAKES AN OATH TO BASE THEIR VERDICTS ONLY ON THE EVIDENCE THAT COMES BEFORE 'EM. AND THEY'RE NOT TO CONSIDER ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE EVIDENCE THAT COMES FROM THE WITNESS STAND, THE EXHIBITS THAT ARE INTRODUCED IN THE EVIDENCE. AND IF THEY VIOLATE THAT OATH, IT'S A VERY, VERY SERIOUS MATTER. Female reporter: LORRI DAVIS, WIFE OF DAMIEN ECHOLS, SPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT A NEW DEFENSE ALLEGATION OF JURY MISCONDUCT IN THE TRIAL OF THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE. DAVIS SAYS THE JURY FOREMAN CONTACTED AN ATTORNEY DURING THE TRIAL 15 YEARS AGO. Philipsborn: WE KNOW FROM A LAWYER WHO HAS NOW SUBMITTED SOME PAPERWORK TO THE COURT WHO TALKED TO THAT JURY FOREMAN AND WHO BECAME AWARE THAT THE JURY FOREMAN WAS CONSIDERING SOME INFORMATION THAT THE JURY FOREMAN SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING. Lloyd Warford: ANYTIME YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CALLS INTO QUESTION A JUDGMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE BY A COURT, WHEN YOU'RE SITTING AT HOME IN YOUR EASY CHAIR AND YOU READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT SOMEBODY'S FACING THE DEATH PENALTY AND YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT, COULD HAVE DONE, IT'S-- IT'S TROUBLING. YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE WHOLE ISSUE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE JURY ROOM. AS AN OFFICER OF THE COURT, I'M NOT PERMITTED TO TALK ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS WITH REGARD TO THIS CASE. Gina Reynolds: I HAD STARTED WORKING FOR LLOYD WARFORD AT THAT POINT IN TIME AS A LAW CLERK. I MET THE JURY FOREMAN KENT ARNOLD. THE FIRST TIME I ENCOUNTERED KENT AT LLOYD'S OFFICE WAS WHEN HE HIRED LLOYD TO REPRESENT HIS BROTHER ON A DIFFERENT CASE. BUT AT THAT TIME, KENT ALREADY KNEW HE WAS BEING CALLED FOR JURY DUTY FOR BALDWIN AND ECHOLS TRIAL. DURING MISSKELLEY'S TRIAL, HE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAD BEEN PRINTED IN THE NEWSPAPER. KENT ARNOLD WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT HE KNEW. HE-- HE BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE GUILTY AND THEY HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND THEY SHOULD BE CONVICTED. I WAS SITTING IN LLOYD'S OFFICE AND HE WAS TALKING TO KENT ON SPEAKERPHONE. AND HE WAS SAYING, "WELL, I'VE GOTTEN MY JURY SUMMONS. HOW DO I MAKE SURE I GET ON THIS JURY?" AND LLOYD WAS GOING, "YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT SOME PRETTY STRONG IDEAS ABOUT WHETHER THESE GUYS ARE GUILTY OR NOT. YOU KNOW, YOU'LL NEVER GET ON THE JURY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT." AFTER KENT WAS ON THE JURY, LLOYD SPECIFICALLY SAID, "HOW DID YOU GET ON THIS JURY?" AND HE BASICALLY SAID, "DUMB JUDGES AND DUMB LAWYERS-- THEY DON'T ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS." DURING THE TRIAL, KENT WAS STILL CALLING LLOYD ON A REGULAR BASIS ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. HE REALLY WANTED LLOYD TO TELL HIM THINGS ABOUT HOW TO GET THIS JURY TO CONVICT THESE BOYS. AND LLOYD WOULD JUST KIND OF BRUSH HIM OFF AND SAY, "OH, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN TALK TO YOU ABOUT." HE ALSO ASKED LLOYD SPECIFICALLY ON THAT PHONE CALL, WHEN WERE THEY GONNA PLAY THE CONFESSION? MR. ARNOLD WOULD BE SAYING STUFF LIKE-- ONE PARTICULAR PHONE CALL-- "THE STATE HASN'T PROVEN THEIR CASE. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO REST TOMORROW. IF ANYBODY'S GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THESE BOYS CONVICTED, IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE ME IN THAT JURY ROOM." THE NEXT THING WE KNOW, HE'S FOREMAN OF THE JURY. HE'S FOREMAN OF THE JURY, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTED TO BE, BECAUSE HE WANTED THESE BOYS CONVICTED. KENT ARNOLD BELIEVED THAT WHAT HE KNEW WAS THE TRUTH AND THAT IT WAS GONNA BE UP TO HIM TO MAKE SURE HIS IDEA OF JUSTICE HAPPENED. HE HAD TO INTRODUCE THE CONFESSION TO THE JURY ROOM. HE HAD ALREADY BASICALLY TOLD US HE WAS GOING TO. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, QUITE FORTUITOUSLY-- AND THIS IS THE SORT OF FORTUNE THAT CAN SAVE A MAN'S LIFE-- WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE JURY PUT UP BIG SHEETS OF FACTORS THAT THEY CONSIDERED IN CONVICTING ECHOLS AND BALDWIN. AND THEY'VE BEEN KEPT IN EVIDENCE. AND HERE THE ECHOLS' ONE IS. NO ONE HAS REALLY ASKED WHAT THAT MIGHT BE. WHY WAS IT CROSSED OUT? WHO CROSSED IT OUT? ONE OF THE JURORS HAD COPIED A FACSIMILE OF THAT LIST INTO HER NOTEBOOK. THE CROSSED-OUT ITEM IS THE JESSIE MISSKELLEY TESTIMONY. WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS THAT IN FACT JESSIE MISSKELLEY'S STATEMENTS PLAYED A PRETTY MAJOR PART IN THE WAY THAT THE JURY IN THE ECHOLS AND BALDWIN CASE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THE CASE AND CAME TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE NOTION THAT THEY SHOULD CONVICT, WHICH IS WRONG. Griffis: I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. APPROXIMATELY A YEAR BEFORE THE ECHOLS CASE, I LECTURED IN LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS. ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THAT COURSE-- I BELIEVE HIS NAME WAS JERRY DRIVER-- HAD CONTACTED ME ABOUT KIDS THAT WERE ACTIVE IN THE WEST MEMPHIS AREA. SO THE YEAR PRIOR, I STARTED SEEING SOME OF THE MATERIALS. THESE WERE DRAWINGS FROM THE AREA. THAT'S HOW IT CAME TO ME. AND. YOU COULD SEE. HERE DEATH SYMBOLS AND USE OF A-- WHAT WAS CALLED A CEREMONIAL SWORD OR AN ATHAME. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU START TO SEE SYMBOLS, THIS SYMBOLOGY OFTEN USED AS A SATANIC SYMBOL. A YEAR AHEAD OF TIME, THEY KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM IN THE AREA. THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS GETTING WORSE. YOU HAD SOME GOOD POLICE OFFICERS DOWN THERE CONCERNED WHAT THE HECK NEXT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. John Fogleman: ANYTHING WRONG WITH WEARING BLACK IN AND OF ITSELF? NO. ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE HEAVY METAL STUFF IN AND OF ITSELF? NO. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT TOGETHER AND YOU BEGIN TO SEE INSIDE DAMIEN ECHOLS, YOU SEE INSIDE THAT PERSON, AND THERE'S NOT A SOUL IN THERE. Echols: WHEN I WAS THAT AGE-- I WAS A KID BASICALLY-- IN COURT, HEARING THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING, I DON'T THINK I REGISTERED THE FULL IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON THEN, BECAUSE I ALWAYS FELT-- I KNEW I DIDN'T DO IT. SO THEREFORE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO PROVE YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T DONE WITH NO EVIDENCE, NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF RUMORS AND GHOST STORIES AND SMOKE SCREENS. I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANY WAY IN HELL THEY WERE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THAT. Lorri Davis: WE'RE HEADING TO GRADY, ARKANSAS, WHERE THE VARNER UNIT IS. IT'S DAMIEN'S BIRTHDAY TODAY, YEAH. TIME HAS BEEN AN ODD THING IN THIS SITUATION, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT JUST DRAGS ON FOREVER AND THEN, WHEN YOU THINK BACK ON IT, IT'S BEEN FLEETING. IN THE PAST 17 YEARS, I'VE MADE FRIENDS THAT HAVE STUCK WITH ME THROUGH THICK AND THIN, THAT HAVE BEEN HERE BEYOND WHAT EVEN MY BLOOD FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN WITH ME BEYOND. I MET LORRI. WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ABOUT 14 YEARS NOW. WE JUST HAD OUR 10th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY LAST WEEK. I'M SURE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE ELSE'S MARRIAGE. BUT THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVERYONE ELSE'S MARRIAGE IS. I JUST KNOW THAT OURS IS A GOOD ONE. IN THE VERY BEGINNING, I WOULD WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SOMETIMES, CURSING HER, LITERALLY CURSING HER OUT LOUD FOR MAKING ME FEEL THE WAY SHE MADE ME FEEL, ESPECIALLY IN HERE, YOU KNOW. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WHENEVER YOU REALLY, REALLY LOVE SOMEBODY, IT'S NOT ALL, YOU KNOW, FLOWERS AND POETRY, LIKE THE SONGS TRY TO MAKE YOU THINK. IT HURTS. IT GETS ITS CLAWS INTO YOU AND IT JUST RIPS. AND I FELT LIKE THAT WAS THE LAST THING I NEEDED TO BE DEALING WITH ON TOP OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THIS. BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME IN MY LIFE. Terry Hobbs: WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD COME FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO A DEATH ROW INMATE AND MARRY THIS MAN? THIS IS A KNOWN CONVICTED CHILD KILLER RIGHT HERE. HE KILLED THREE LITTLE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOYS IN WEST MEMPHIS, ARKANSAS, IN 1993. WHAT KIND OF MIND DOES THIS YOUNG LADY HAVE WHO WOULD COME DOWN HERE AND MARRY SOMEBODY LIKE THAT? THIS WHOLE THING HAS GONE FROM WHAT HAPPENED TO THREE LITTLE BOYS TO MORE LIKE A CIRCUS OF SOME KIND. OUR INVESTIGATORS WERE OBTAINING D.N.A. SAMPLES IN THE FORM OF HAIRS, CIGARETTE BUTTS, ORAL SWABS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD SOME CONNECTION TO THE EVENTS. THESE INCLUDED SAMPLES FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE, INCLUDING STEVEN BRANCH'S STEPFATHER TERRY HOBBS. WE GAVE ALL THESE SAMPLES TO THOMAS FEDOR, WHO'S HERE TODAY. HE'S AN INDEPENDENT FORENSIC SEROLOGIST. THE RESULT OF THAT ANALYSIS IN MAY 2007 SHOWED THAT A HAIR FROM A LIGATURE USED TO TIE UP MICHAEL MOORE COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH TERRY HOBBS. THE BIGGEST BOMBSHELL OF THE NEW DEFENSE INVESTIGATION IS THAT AN UNEXPLAINED HAIR THAT COULD BE FROM ANOTHER VICTIM'S STEPFATHER WAS FOUND ON SHOELACES AT THE CRIME SCENE. Lorri Davis: OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS OR FOUR WEEKS, A GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM HERE IN ARKANSAS HAVE FORMED A CAMPAIGN CALLED "ARKANSAS TAKE ACTION." Capi Peck: WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE STATE CAPITOL FOR A RALLY. THERE'S BEEN SUCH AN OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FOR A DECADE, SUPPORTING THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE. BUT ARKANSAS HAS BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET. WE HOPE THAT WITH OUR GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT "ARKANSAS TAKE ACTION," THAT ARKANSANS FROM ACROSS THE STATE WILL SPEAK OUT, ASKING OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS NEW EVIDENCE AND TO GET THESE GUYS OUT OF PRISON. NONE OF THE D.N.A. FROM ANY OF THE CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH MR. ECHOLS OR MR. BALDWIN OR MR. MISSKELLEY. TERRY HOBBS COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THAT HAIR ON THE LIGATURE. APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2% OF THE POPULATION AT LARGE COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THAT HAIR. NONE OF THE DEFENDANTS COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THAT HAIR ON THE LIGATURE. Female reporter: TAKE A LOOK AT JUST HOW MUCH SUPPORT THEY HAVE-- THOUSANDS OF POSTCARDS, SOME AS FAR AWAY AS LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, AND EUROPE, ALL SUPPORTING THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE. Woman: DID YOU MURDER THE LITTLE BOYS? WELL, I'D HAVE TO LAUGH AT THAT AND SAY THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH SOMEONE WHO WOULD THINK THAT. Male reporter: THAT STEPFATHER DENIES HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDERS. AND THE ARKANSAS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SAID IN THE STATEMENT IT WILL REVIEW AND RESPOND, BUT WARNS "THE LEGAL PROCESS COULD TAKE MONTHS AND POSSIBLY YEARS." Female reporter: DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE AS CLOSE AS EVER TO ACTUALLY GETTING A NEW TRIAL? Lorri Davis: WE GET CLOSER EVERY DAY. YEAH, SO WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND THE EVIDENCE THAT WE'RE FINALLY UNCOVERING, I THINK WE'RE GETTING CLOSER ALL THE TIME. IT'S SAD TO SEE THAT THERE'S PEOPLE OUT HERE TRYING TO GET SOME KILLERS OUT OF PRISON THAT DESERVE, EVERY ONE, TO BE HUNG BY A ROPE. Natalie Maines: I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS TO KNOW THAT WE ARE WATCHING THEM. IT'S NOT ABOUT OPINION ANYMORE. IT'S NOT ABOUT DEBATE. IT'S ABOUT SCIENCE. AND I URGE YOU ALL TO GO TO wm3.org AND DONATE TO THE DEFENSE FUND. THE DONATIONS IS WHAT HAS PAID FOR THE FORENSIC TESTS AND THE D.N.A. TESTING THAT'S GOING TO SET THESE MEN FREE. I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M HONORED TO BE HERE. LORRI'S A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL PERSON. AND SHE'S WHAT HAS KEPT THIS GOING FOR 14 YEARS AND MADE PEOPLE NOT FORGET ABOUT THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( cheering, applause ) WELL, KELLY'S COURT IS BACK IN SESSION. ON THE DOCKET TODAY-- MEET TERRY HOBBS. THIS MAN SUED THE DIXIE CHICKS FOR DEFAMATION. WHY? NATALIE MAINES HAS BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT THIS CASE, SAYING THAT NEW D.N.A. TESTING WOULD PROVE HOBBS WAS INVOLVED IN HIS OWN STEPSON'S DEATH. Woman: RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND. DO YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, - AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD? - I DO. Man: MR. HOBBS, COULD YOU TELL THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY WHY YOU SUED MY CLIENT? FOR HER STATEMENTS AGAINST ME THAT SHE MADE ON THE INTERNET. WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GET OUT OF THE LAWSUIT? JUSTICE. - HOW DO YOU DEFINE JUSTICE? - IN A COURT OF LAW. - YOU WANT MONEY, DON'T YOU? - I DON'T WANT-- I WANT JUSTICE AS THE COURTS DEEM. AN APOLOGY? IS THAT ENOUGH? WHATEVER THE COURTS DECIDE. NO, I'M NOT ASKING WHAT-- I'M ASKING WHAT YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS LAWSUIT, MR. HOBBS. IF I WOULD SIT HERE, TO BE HONEST-- THAT'S WHAT I WANT. I WANT YOU TO BE TOTALLY HONEST. I WOULD SIT HERE AND SAY I'D LIKE TO SEE THE DIXIE CHICKS HUMILIATED LIKE THEY HAVE CAUSED ME. I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT FAIR. Woman: MR. HOBBS, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO INTO SOME MATERIAL NOW THAT MAY BE SENSITIVE. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE OR EMBARRASS YOU. IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT YOU'VE PLACED YOUR REPUTATION IN ISSUE BY BRINGING THIS LAWSUIT. IT IS YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU ARE NOT A VIOLENT MAN. CORRECT. - AND YOU DO NOT FLY INTO RAGES. - CORRECT. Female reporter: PAM HOBBS SAYS LAST WEEKEND HER HUSBAND TERRY BEAT HER UP AT THEIR HOME IN MEMPHIS. WHEN PAM'S FATHER AND BROTHER HEARD SHE'D BEEN BEATEN, THEY WENT TO CHECK ON HER. HE STARTED TELLING ME IT WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS, AND THEN NATURALLY I JUST GOT MORE UPSET AND STARTED HITTING HIM. AND I TOOK HIM TO THE GROUND. AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, HE SHOT ME. Female reporter: TERRY HOBBS FACES ASSAULT CHARGES AND HE IS NOW IN A MEMPHIS JAIL. Woman: YOU DID BACKHAND PAM HOBBS THE NIGHT THAT YOU ENDED UP SHOOTING HER BROTHER, CORRECT? - OKAY. - IS THAT CORRECT? ( laughs ) YEAH, ALL RIGHT. - IS THAT FUNNY? - WELL, IT'S-- YOU GET TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT IT AFTER A WHILE. WELL, SHE HAD BEEN PROVOKING ME FOR THREE DAYS OVER ONE SIMPLE WOMAN. - SHE WAS ASKING FOR IT? - YOU MIGHT ASK HER. DID YOU EVER VOW TO GET REVENGE ON PAM FOR KISSING ANOTHER MAN? NEVER. DID PAM KISS ANOTHER MAN A FEW WEEKS BEFORE STEVIE DIED? I'M NOT SURE WHEN, BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED. TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT. SHE WAS KISSING THAT MEXICAN IN OUR HOUSE. AND THAT HAPPENED A FEW WEEKS BEFORE STEVIE DIED? I'M NOT SURE WHEN. HOW WOULD WE BEST DETERMINE WHEN THAT OCCURRED? ASK THE MEXICAN. LET ME DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO PARAGRAPH 14 OF PAM HOBBS'S DECLARATION. "TWO WEEKS AFTER STEVIE DIED, TERRY LEFT TOWN. HE SAID I WAS TOO MUCH TO HANDLE AND THAT HE COULD NOT STAY AROUND ME ANYMORE." - DID I READ THAT CORRECTLY? - YOU DID. AND IS THAT A TRUE PARAGRAPH? I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE TIME FRAME, BUT, YEAH, I HAD TO GET AWAY. ARE YOU ALL GONNA BE ABLE TO GET BACK TOGETHER OR IS THE MARRIAGE OVER? IT'S-- IT'S OVER. DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE STILL TOGETHER IF STEVIE HADN'T BEEN MURDERED? WELL. WE HAD TROUBLE ANYWAY, YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BEFORE THIS HAPPENED. AND HE ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT HE DON'T GET MAD; HE GETS EVEN. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT HE HAD ALWAYS SAID TO ME. Man: PAM SURE AS HECK THINKS THAT YOU DID IT, DOESN'T SHE? THINKS WHO DID WHAT? SHE THINKS YOU KILLED STEVIE. SHE THINKS WHO KILLED STEVIE? - YOU. - NO. - SHE DOESN'T THINK THAT? - NO. - SHE DOESN'T THINK YOU WERE INVOLVED? - NO. A SICKENING FEELING, YEAH-- I STILL THINK, YOU KNOW, HE-- HE COULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE. Woman: YOU'VE TOLD MANY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WHAT YOU DID AFTER DROPPING PAM HOBBS OFF AT WORK AROUND 5:00 P.M. ON MAY 5th OF 1993. BUT IN ALL THOSE VERSIONS YOU WERE ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR STEVIE THE WHOLE TIME. CORRECT? CORRECT. NOW DAVID JACOBY IS SAYING THAT YOU CAME OVER TO HIS HOUSE AT 5:00-SOMETHING AND PLAYED GUITAR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. I DON'T RECALL THAT. YOU'VE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT YOU WERE WITH MARK BYERS AND DANA MOORE AT 6:00 P.M., BUT DANA MOORE AND MARK BYERS SAY YOU WEREN'T. YOU SAY YOU WERE NOT EVER ALONE ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 5th AND THE MORNING OF MAY 6th, AND YET DAVID JACOBY SAYS YOU LEFT HIS HOUSE TWICE ALONE. THAT'S CORRECT, ISN'T IT, SIR? I DON'T KNOW. NO ONE CAN CORROBORATE BEING WITH YOU OR YOUR WHEREABOUTS FOR THE TIME PERIOD FROM 6:00 P.M. TO 8:00 OR 8:30 P.M. ISN'T THAT TRUE, SIR? SO? SO MY POINT IS THERE'S NOT ANY WITNESS-- NOT ANY OF YOUR ALIBI WITNESSES CAN CONFIRM YOUR WHEREABOUTS FROM 6:00 P.M. TO 8:30 P.M. - ISN'T THAT TRUE, SIR? - AND YOU'RE SAYING WHAT? I'M SAYING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALIBI WITNESS FOR TWO TO 2 1/2 HOURS ON THE EVENING OF THE MURDERS. I DON'T KNOW. - DOES THAT CONCERN YOU? - NO. Man: DID YOU SEE STEVIE AT ALL THAT DAY, MAY THE 5th? NO, I DID NOT. YOU DIDN'T SEE STEVIE OR MICHAEL MOORE OR CHRISTOPHER BYERS AT ALL - ON MAY 5th OF 1993? - I DIDN'T. Man: IF SOMEBODY TESTIFIES THAT THEY SAW YOU WITH THE BOYS THAT NIGHT--? DO WHAT? IF SOMEBODY TESTIFIED THAT THEY SAW YOU AND THE BOYS, WOULD THEY BE LYING? MM-HMM, THEY WOULD BE LYING. - 'CAUSE YOU NEVER FOUND THE BOYS? - NO, I NEVER FOUND THEM. - NEVER FOUND THEM ALIVE? - NEVER FOUND THEM AT ALL. OKAY. Man #2: SO IF SOMEONE WERE TO TESTIFY THAT THEY SAW THE THREE LITTLE BOYS STANDING BEHIND YOU ON THE EVENING OF MAY THE 5th. Man #1: PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT YOU WENT TO PICK UP PAM, THEY'D BE MISTAKEN? MOST DEFINITELY. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THAT ONE. ( chuckles ) STEVEN BRANCH LIVED THREE HOUSES DOWN FROM OUR HOUSE. AND THEY CAME THROUGH RIGHT HERE. THEY ZOOMED THROUGH. THERE USED TO BE A BUNCH OF BUSHES RIGHT HERE, AND THEY ALL ZOOMED THROUGH AND WENT DOWN THE SIDEWALK. WE CAME OUTSIDE TO GO TO CHURCH AT 6:30. AND I YELLED AT CHRISTOPHER TO GO HOME, AND HE SAID, "I DON'T HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU TELL ME TO DO." I SAID, "OKAY, WHATEVER," YOU KNOW. AND WE GOT IN THE CAR TO GO TO CHURCH. BUT I SAW TERRY COMING DOWN THE SIDEWALK HERE, COMING THIS DIRECTION. AND HE WAS CALLING FOR STEVEN TO COME BACK DOWN TO THEIR HOUSE. AND WE GOT IN THE CAR AND LEFT, BUT THEY WERE-- THEY WERE TOGETHER WHEN WE WENT PAST THEM. AS WE WERE DRIVING BY, STEVEN WAS ON HIS BIKE RIDING AND CHRISTOPHER AND MICHAEL WERE RUNNING BEHIND HIM. THEY WERE LAUGHING. THEY WERE HAVING FUN LIKE EVERY TIME I'VE EVER SEEN THEM BEFORE. THEY WERE JUST HAVING FUN LIKE ANY OTHER REGULAR DAY. AND WE DROVE BY. THEY WERE-- THEY WERE RIGHT HERE NEAR TERRY'S HOUSE. HE WAS SITTING OUTSIDE, CALLING FOR STEVEN. AND THEY WERE STILL LAUGHING. THEY WERE LAUGHING RIGHT HERE. AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT. AS WE DROVE BY, THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE SAW THEM. THE POLICE OR NO ONE EVER CAME BY OUR HOUSE. WE KIND OF THOUGHT THEY MIGHT, BECAUSE WE LIVE THREE DOORS DOWN, BUT NO ONE EVER CAME BY. THIS PAST YEAR, THEY WERE MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT THE TIP LINE ON OUR NEWS. AND I THINK I HEARD A LONG TIME AGO THAT THEY WENT MISSING AT, LIKE, 6:00. I SAID TO MYSELF, "I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE AROUND OUR HOUSE PLAYING AT 6:30. THEY WERE OVER HERE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. I THOUGHT THAT TERRY WOULD TELL THEM THAT HE WAS WITH THE BOYS THAT DAY. I NEVER KNEW UNTIL THIS YEAR THAT HE WAS SAYING THAT HE DIDN'T SEE THEM AT ALL. HE'S NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. HE WAS OUT THERE WITH THEM. Terry Hobbs: I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS BEING INVESTIGATED. NOTHING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS TRUE. AND IT'S JUST-- THE ONLY THING REALLY THAT'S EVER BOTHERED ME IS KNOWING THAT THEY'VE TAKEN MY NAME AND SAID WHAT THEY'VE SAID ABOUT ME. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DEPOSITIONS. YOU KNOW, STAY OUT OF THAT. ( laughs ) Woman: THIS NEXT QUESTION I'M ASKING WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO YOU AND TO THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS AT ALL, BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PROSECUTORS HAVE NEVER LOOKED AT TERRY HOBBS-- ONE OF THE STEPFATHERS OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS-- SERIOUSLY AS BEING A PERSON OF INTEREST OR EVEN A POSSIBLE SUSPECT IN THIS CASE. AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR A LONG TIME. DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THAT IS OR ANY EXPLANATION OF WHY THAT WOULD BE? UH, I REALLY CAN'T COMMENT ON IT. YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY TRANSPIRED IN THAT INVESTIGATION. WHY IS THAT? AND THE REASON I AM UNCOMFORTABLE IS. THERE IS A WEALTH OF MONEY SUPPORTING THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE IN GETTING THEM OUT OF JAIL. NOW I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE PERSONALLY THEY'RE GUILTY OF THE CRIME. TWO JURIES SAID THEY WERE GUILTY OF IT. I'M AFRAID I COULD SAY SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATELY. I COULD BE WRONG. I COULD BE FORGETFUL. AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING THAT WOULD CAUSE THEM TO GET A NEW TRIAL JUST BASED ON A COMMENT I MAKE. DON'T PUT THAT MONKEY ON MY BACK-- THAT I'VE SAID SOMETHING INCORRECTLY OVER 16 YEARS THAT I MAY OR MAY NOT REMEMBER, THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENTITLED TO A NEW TRIAL FOR SOMETHING I SAID? NO. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT GOING TO DISCUSS THE CASE. - FAIR ENOUGH. - IF THEY HAVE NEW EVIDENCE, HEY, I'M ALL FOR IT. GO FOR IT. John Douglas: I LOOKED AT ALL THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. I LOOKED AND REVIEWED THE INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE CASE AND PRETTY-- PRETTY CLEARLY, AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO ME TO DEFINE THIS CASE AS A PERSONAL CAUSE HOMICIDE. THIS IS NOT A HOMICIDE EITHER PERPETRATED BY A STRANGER. THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME KNEW THESE VICTIMS AND KNEW THESE VICTIMS RELATIVELY WELL. THE QUESTION I'D ASK MYSELF IS, IF THE MOTIVATION IS MURDER, IF THE INITIAL INTENT IS MURDER, GO AHEAD AND KILL. WHY DID THE SUBJECT DECIDE TO TIE UP THE VICTIMS AFTER STRIPPING THEM DOWN NAKED? I BELIEVE THE INITIAL INTENT, IN MY ANALYSIS, WAS NOT TO KILL, BUT WAS TO TAUNT AND TO PUNISH-- PUNISH THESE INDIVIDUALS. I SAW CRIMINAL SOPHISTICATION AT THE CRIME SCENE. THE TYING OF THE WRISTS TO THE ANKLES-- I SEARCHED CASES ALL OVER THE WORLD. I COULDN'T COME UP WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CASES. WHEN I SAW THE OFFENDER DECIDE TO GET INTO THE WATER AND TO SECRETE THE CLOTHING BY PUSHING DOWN THE STICKS-- THE STICKS IN THE CLOTHING, HIDING THE CLOTHING ALONG WITH THE THREE VICTIMS, USING THAT KIND OF CONCERTED EFFORT-- WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT TEENAGERS COMMITTING CRIMES LIKE THIS. WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY WHO'S RELATIVELY CRIMINALLY SOPHISTICATED. WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN VIOLENT IN THE PAST, WHO'S VIOLENT NOW AND AT THE TIME THIS CRIME WAS PERPETRATED, AND WOULD ALSO BE VIOLENT IN THE FUTURE. THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME CAN LOOK AT YOU RIGHT IN THE EYE-- CAN LOOK AT A CAMERA AND SAY THAT "I DIDN'T DO IT." BECAUSE IT'S THE PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY. THERE IS NO REMORSE. ANYONE WHO PERPETRATES A CRIME LIKE THIS AND LEAVES THE VICTIMS LIKE THIS IN THIS CONDITION IS ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT HIMSELF. YOU COULD PUT HIM ON THE POLYGRAPH-- HE'LL PASS THE POLYGRAPH, PARTICULARLY IF IT'S 14 YEARS LATER. WHEN JOHN DOUGLAS TOLD ME THAT TERRY HOBBS' RECORD AND BACKGROUND MADE ME LOOK LIKE A BOY SCOUT, I ALMOST FELL OUT. AND HE WAS DEAD SERIOUS. HERE'S A WORLD-RENOWNED, 30-YEAR, PROBABLY THE FINEST PROFILER IN F.B.I. HISTORY. I WAS NERVOUS JUST BEING AROUND HIM, THINKING HE'S PROFILING ME. HE TOLD ME HE HAD DONE THAT A LONG TIME AGO. HE KNEW I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. I'VE BEEN ASKED, "DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING TO TERRY HOBBS WHAT WAS DONE TO YOU?" NO, NO, NO. I'M TALKING ABOUT FACTS. I'M TALKING ABOUT D.N.A. I'M TALKING ABOUT NO ALIBI. I'M TALKING ABOUT LIES AFTER LIES AFTER LIES. ( tuning ) WHY DON'T YOU HOLD THIS AND LET ME HOLD THAT? AND I'LL TUNE IT REAL QUICK. DON'T MAKE ME REACH OVER AND SLAP SOMEBODY. ( muttering ) BROTHERS. Tina Hobbs: GOD KNOWS ALL THINGS AND WHY THEY HAPPEN. WE DON'T, BUT HE DOES. AND WE HAVE TO TRUST IN HIM. SO I CAN TELL YOU, THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE TALK. YOU KNOW, EVEN FOR US, WE DON'T LIKE SOME OF THE STUFF THAT IS ON THE TV AND THIS AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN SAID, BECAUSE WE KNOW, YOU KNOW, THAT, NO, YOU KNOW, TERRY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN-- THAT, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T DO THIS THING. THIS IS NOT TERRY. TERRY'S-- I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN, YOU KNOW. Michael Hobbs: I HAVE NEVER CHANGED MY MIND FROM THE CONVICTION. I DON'T CARE WHAT ALL THEM OTHER PEOPLE PUT ON THAT INTERNET, I HAVE NEVER CHANGED MY MIND. I'M JUST LIKE THE STATE OF ARKANSAS AND I'M JUST LIKE THE LEGAL SYSTEM. I BELIEVE IN JUSTICE AND I BELIEVE IT WAS SERVED. THEY, YOU KNOW, WENT THROUGH TRIAL AND EVERYTHING. THEY DID WHAT THEY DID. THEY ARRESTED THREE BOYS. UNTIL WE GET TOLD OTHERWISE, WE STILL BELIEVE THAT'S THE ONES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE-- UNTIL WE GET TOLD OTHERWISE. I HAD SOMETHING MADE-- JUST THE PROS AND CONS OF TERRY HOBBS. THIS PRETTY WELL SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. TWO ITEMS THAT WOULD BE ON THE INNOCENT SIDE-- THAT HE NEEDED TO TRY TO RESTRAIN THREE VICTIMS. SOME SAY THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT. NOT REALLY. ONCE HE HIT ONE CHILD, THE OTHER TWO PROBABLY FROZE LIKE A DEER IN HEADLIGHTS. ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL REPORTS, ALL THREE CHILDREN BASICALLY FROM BLOWS TO THE HEAD WOULD HAVE DIED. AND THEN POSSIBLE SECONDARY TRANSFER-- THAT'S REFERRING TO HIS HAIR THAT WAS FOUND IN A LIGATURE TIED TO ONE OF THE CHILDREN. THAT'S ABOUT ALL ON THE PRO SIDE YOU COULD FIND. LET'S LOOK AT THE GUILTY. MOTIVE, MEANS, AND OPPORTUNITY. HE HAD A VIOLENT PAST. HE WORKED IN A SLAUGHTERHOUSE. AND HE ADMITS BEING IN THE WOODS AT 6:30. TERRY HOBBS ADMITS IT. NO ONE ELSE PUTS HIM THERE. HE PUTS HIMSELF THERE. NO ALIBI. CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE CRUCIAL TIMES FROM 6:30 TO 8:00, 8:30 TO 9:00, 10:00 TO 11:15 AND FROM 2:30 TO 5:00 A.M. THAT'S A LOT OF GAP IN TIME OF, WHAT WERE YOU DOING, MR. HOBBS? WHERE WERE YOU? CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN WITH JACOBY AT TIMES, JACOBY DENIES. NOW HERE'S YOUR OWN WITNESS DENYING WHAT YOU SAID. TO ME, THAT DOESN'T LOOK TOO GOOD. NOT INTERVIEWED OR CLEARED BY THE POLICE. NOW THERE, THE WEST MEMPHIS P.D., 101, TOTALLY FELL ON THEIR FACE. THEY DIDN'T GO TALK TO TERRY HOBBS AND QUESTION HIM ABOUT WHAT HE DID THAT NIGHT. THEY DIDN'T TREAT HIM THE WAY THEY TREATED ME. INCONSISTENT STATEMENT-- HE NEVER SAW ANY OF THE BOYS THAT DAY. WE KNOW THAT'S WRONG. HE WAS SEEN BY THREE WITNESSES THAT WERE NEIGHBORS. THAT COULD HAVE COME OUT BACK ON MAY 5th OR 6th IF THE WEST MEMPHIS P.D. WOULD HAVE CANVASSED THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY JUST CANVASSED THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, NEVER WENT AROUND AND ASKED ANY OF HOBBS' NEIGHBORS A WORD. THEY'D HAVE TOLD THEM THAT BACK THEN. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN HIS LIE THEN. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST PERSON TO HAVE SEEN THEM. THE POLICE WOULD HAVE ZEROED IN ON HIM INSTEAD OF DAMIEN AND THEY WOULD HAVE GOT THE REAL KILLER AND WE WOULD NOT BE HERE TALKING TODAY. I BELIEVE THAT IF THIS WAS PRESENTED TO A JURY, THEY WOULD FIND TERRY HOBBS GUILTY. THIS IS MORE EVIDENCE AND FACTS THAN AGAINST THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE OR ME OR ANYONE ELSE. Man: I'M GONNA DIRECT THIS, I GUESS, TO THE D.N.A. EXPERTS. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME, IT SEEMS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S BEEN DIFFERENT FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE POPPED UP AS KIND OF BEING SUSPECTS IN THIS CASE. AND I HAVE TO ASK, IS THERE REALLY SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH D.N.A. EVIDENCE THAT COULD POINT TO TERRY HOBBS? MY PERSONAL OPINION IS I DON'T THINK THAT THAT HAIR EVIDENCE WOULD BE ENOUGH TO CONVICT MR. HOBBS OR ANYBODY IN A SIMILAR SITUATION, BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY NOT STRONG ENOUGH. THE PERCENTAGES THAT I GAVE OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THOSE HAIRS ARE 1 1/2% OF THE POPULATION. THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG EVIDENCE, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO WITH D.N.A. TESTING. Woman: SO JUST TO CLARIFY, THE D.N.A. EVIDENCE-- THE POINT OF BRINGING IT UP ISN'T TO SAY THAT HOBBS DID IT, BUT IT'S JUST TO SAY, ONE COULD THINK IT MIGHT BE MORE LIKELY THAT HOBBS WOULD HAVE DONE IT VERSUS DAMIEN, BECAUSE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THERE AT ALL? THE LAST THING AS DEFENSE LAWYERS WE WOULD INTEND TO DO IS INDICT AND CONVICT SOMEONE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT OF THIS CASE. THE EVIDENCE AS TO HOBBS-- I DON'T THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE VIEWED THAT WAY. BUT IS IT EVIDENCE THAT WOULD LEAD ANY REASONABLE JUROR TO ACQUIT DAMIEN ECHOLS? YES, IT WOULD. Male reporter: DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ANNOUNCED THEY HAD NEW D.N.A. EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS NO TRACE OF ECHOLS OR THE OTHER DEFENDANTS AT THE CRIME SCENE. EVEN SOME OF THE VICTIMS' RELATIVES WHO INITIALLY AGREED WITH THE VERDICTS. THAT'S WHAT ALL THREE OF 'EM ARE-- PUNKS. PUNKS. .NOW THINK THE MEN IN JAIL ARE INNOCENT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANOTHER TRIAL. GIVE 'EM A FAIR TRIAL. PRESENT THE EVIDENCE THAT REALLY WASN'T PRESENTED IN THE OTHER TRIALS. AND IF THEY'RE GUILTY, SO BE IT. THAT'S WHERE THEY STAY. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT, GOD, DON'T PUT SOMEBODY TO DEATH, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, OOPS. AS DAMIEN'S LAWYERS, WE ARE NOT TAKING ON THE BURDEN OF PROVING WHO ACTUALLY COMMITTED THESE CRIMES. THE QUESTION FOR THE COURT SHOULD BE AND WILL BE, WOULD A REASONABLE JUROR, LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE PICTURE NOW-- ALL THE EVIDENCE OF GUILT, ALL THE EVIDENCE OF INNOCENCE, EVERYTHING THAT WAS ADMITTED AT TRIAL, EVERYTHING THAT SURFACED THEREAFTER-- LOOKING AT THAT AND THROWING INTO THE MIX THE D.N.A. RESULTS, WOULD A REASONABLE JUROR CONVICT THESE PEOPLE TODAY? AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO. Female reporter: JUDGE DAVID BURNETT TENTATIVELY SET UP HEARINGS FOR NEXT MONTH TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO OVERTURN THE CONVICTIONS OF THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WANT TO PRESENT NEW D.N.A. EVIDENCE THEY HOPE WILL LEAD TO A NEW TRIAL. JUDGE BURNETT MADE IT CLEAR HE COULD FOLLOW PROSECUTORS' SUGGESTIONS THAT THE D.N.A. EVIDENCE ISN'T ENOUGH FOR A NEW TRIAL OR TO OVERTURN THE CONVICTIONS. IF JUDGE BURNETT RULES IN FAVOR OF THE STATE'S OPINION ON ECHOLS'S D.N.A. PLEADING, THIS VERY WELL COULD BE THE END OF THE ROAD FOR HIS DEFENSE. IN THE NEWSROOM, WILL CARTER, REGION 8 NEWS. IN SEPTEMBER, JUDGE DAVID BURNETT, WHO PRESIDED OVER BOTH TRIALS, RULED HE WOULD NOT HEAR ANY NEW EVIDENCE IN THE CASE. SO DAMIEN ECHOLS IS NOW APPEALING HIS CASE TO THE ARKANSAS SUPREME COURT, WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY UPHELD THE CONVICTION. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE ARKANSAS SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO INTERPRET THE D.N.A. STATUTE. SO IT'S GOING TO HAVE ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR EVERYBODY WHO COMES IN THEIR WAKE. I'M THINKING ABOUT WHEN WE ARGUE THIS IN THE ARKANSAS SUPREME COURT, THE APPROACH WE WANT TO TAKE IS, "JUSTICES, YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT THIS SPECIFIC CASE HAS GARNERED A LOT OF INTEREST, BUT THE INTERESTS AT STAKE HERE ARE A LOT BROADER THAN THE THREE INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THE COURT, EVEN THOUGH ONE OF THOSE LITERALLY HAS HIS LIFE ON THE LINE." Riordan: GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONORS. IF IT PLEASE THE COURT, OBVIOUSLY, SINCE MY CLIENT IS SENTENCED TO DEATH, THE RESOLUTION OF THIS CASE IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO HIM. BUT THE INTERESTS AT STAKE HERE ARE FAR BROADER. AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH PURE QUESTIONS OF LAW ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT I'LL CALL "THE D.N.A. STATUTES." WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ARKANSAS STATUTE? THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THAT STATUTE THAT SAYS THAT IF THE D.N.A. EVIDENCE EXCLUDES THE DEFENDANT AS THE SOURCE OF THE D.N.A., WHICH IT DID IN OUR CASE, THEN THE TRIAL COURT HAS TO CONSIDER ALL THE EVIDENCE, WHETHER IT WAS ADMITTED AT TRIAL OR NOT, TO SEE WHAT A REASONABLE JUROR WOULD DO TODAY. THIS STATUTE WAS PASSED TO EXONERATE THE INNOCENT. THE STATE HAS REALLY PROPOSED AN ORWELLIAN INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM "ALL." "ALL" SIMPLY MEANS ALL. Horgan: THE STATE TOOK THE POSITION THAT IN WEIGHING ALL THE EVIDENCE, WHAT THE STATUTE MEANT TO SAY WAS THAT THE COURT CONSIDER ONLY ALL THE EVIDENCE OF GUILT, BUT NOT THE EVIDENCE OF INNOCENCE, WHICH IS NONSENSICAL, BECAUSE, OF COURSE, IF A TRIAL COURT WERE TO LOOK AT THE D.N.A. EVIDENCE, BUT THEN ONLY CONSIDER ALL THE EVIDENCE OF GUILT, THE COURT WOULDN'T BE CONSIDERING EVERYTHING THAT MAKES A COMPELLING CASE FOR INNOCENCE. Judge: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, MR. RIORDAN. LET'S FOCUS ON THE EVIDENCE SITUATION AND LET'S SAY THAT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT MAYBE THE TRIAL JUDGE WAS IN ERROR WITH RESPECT TO JUST LIMITING THE EVIDENCE TO EVIDENCE OF GUILT. WHAT EVIDENCE THEN WOULD BE CONSIDERED? WOULD IT BE THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL OR EVERYTHING THAT'S OCCURRED OVER THE LAST 17 YEARS? I DON'T THINK THAT IT CAN BE RATIONALLY READ OTHER THAN TO SAY THE COURT MUST CONSIDER-- THAT IS, PLACE IN THE SCALE-- NOT ONLY THE EVIDENCE OF GUILT BUT ALSO ALL OTHER EVIDENCE, WHETHER OR NOT ADMITTED AT THE FIRST TRIAL. THE COURT WILL RECOGNIZE THE COUNSELOR. GOOD MORNING. MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT, MR. ECHOLS HAS BEEN TO THIS COURT SEVERAL TIMES IN THE LAST DECADE CHALLENGING HIS CONVICTION DIRECTLY AND COLLATERALLY, AND THIS STATUTE DOES NOT CALL FOR A RETRIAL. IT'S NOT ABOUT TRYING SOMEBODY AGAIN FOR THE STATE TO PROVE GUILT TWICE. COUNSELOR, WHAT HARM IS THERE IN ALLOWING HIM TO PRESENT THE EVIDENCE FROM THE LAST 17 YEARS? I'M SORRY? WHAT HARM IS THERE IN ALLOWING HIM TO PRESENT ALL EVIDENCE? WELL, THE HARM IS IN THE FINALITY OF A CRIMINAL JUDGMENT THAT IS NOT DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR PROCEDURAL DEFECT AND JUST TO TRY IT AGAIN. I MEAN, YOU'RE SUGGESTING, IT SOUNDS TO ME, JUSTICE, AS THOUGH EVERY 15 OR 17 YEARS OR SO, WE REALLY OUGHT TO TRY CASES AGAIN TO RE-ESTABLISH GUILT. I THINK IT'S-- I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE ANIMATING PURPOSE HERE IS NOT TO RETRY. SO THE HARM IS-- IS TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM'S INTEREST IN FINALITY AND THE WORK THAT GETS DONE IN EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED IN EACH OF THE FORUMS THAT MR. ECHOLS HAS BEEN THROUGH ALREADY. IT SOUNDS AS IF YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT ALL EVIDENCE OF GUILT WILL BE CONSIDERED, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ADMIT ALL OTHER EVIDENCE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN EXCULPATORY. I THINK THAT'S-- THAT IS THE ARGUMENT. IT'S THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE REASON THE CIRCUIT COURT CONCLUDED THAT RELIEF SHOULD BE DENIED. AND TO ME, THAT'S-- THAT'S A REASONABLE STATUTE. BUT WHERE DOES IT SAY, "ALL OTHER EVIDENCE OF GUILT"? I UNDERSTAND THAT IT DOESN'T EXPRESSLY SAY THAT. BUT YOU HAVE TO INTERPRET THE STATUTE IN LIGHT OF ITS ANIMATING PURPOSE. AND YOU HAVE TO INTERPRET IT IN LIGHT OF RULES OF GRAMMAR. I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR CONSTRUCTION. I'M HAVING TROUBLE FOLLOWING. IF THE TESTING HAS TO PROVE YOU'RE INNOCENT, WHY WOULD YOU EVEN NEED A HEARING? WELL, AGAIN, I THINK YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO CONTEXT, YOUR HONOR. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CLEAR MEANING OF THE STATUTE. I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONTEXT ARGUMENT, BUT WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CLEAR LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE. Riordan: IT COMES OUT OF A MIND SET THAT SAYS, "OUR JOB AS PROSECUTORS IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WE PROSECUTE IS CONVICTED, EVERYBODY WHO'S SENTENCED TO DEATH IS KILLED. THIS IS A WRESTLING MATCH TO THE DEATH, AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COME OUT ON TOP IN EACH INSTANCE." THE LEGISLATURE, IN ITS WISDOM, RECOGNIZED THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, LIKE ALL HUMAN ENDEAVORS, SOMETIMES IS FLAWED. BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS FREE OF ERROR AND THEREFORE IS EFFECTIVELY DIVINE. I QUOTE FROM THEIR BRIEF IN THE CIRCUIT COURT: "THE STATE DOES NOT SHRINK FROM ECHOLS' CHARGE THAT RELIEF MAY NEVER BE GRANTED UNDER THIS VIEW OF THE STATUTE"-- ITS VIEW-- "BUT EMBRACES IT OUT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE ARKANSAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES NOT CONVICT THE INNOCENT." THE STATE HAS TAKEN A POSITION THAT'S DIRECTED NOT ONLY ABOUT DENYING RELIEF TO MR. ECHOLS, MR. BALDWIN, MR. MISSKELLEY, BUT ENSURING THAT NO ONE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO GET RELIEF UNDER THE ARKANSAS D.N.A. STATUTES. RIORDAN, YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Riordan: I THANK THE COURT FOR ITS ATTENTION AND RECOGNIZE THE COURT MAY FEEL THAT THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY IS A REMAND TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. - THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE CLOCK ON MY HEAD-- IT AIN'T GOT NO HANDS ON IT FOR A REASON. TO ME, IT MEANS TIME IS STANDING STILL. MY TIME IS STANDING STILL. EVERYBODY ELSE'S TIME IS MOVING FORWARD. BUT HERE IT IS, WHAT, ALMOST 18 YEARS LATER? WHATEVER TIME IT IS WHEN, YOU KNOW, THE POLICE FINALLY LET ME OUT, THAT'S WHAT TIME I'M GONNA PUT UP THERE. I'VE SPENT NEARLY 60% OF MY LIFE INCARCERATED NOW. AND I'VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE AT, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT, ENJOY IT. NO MATTER HOW BAD YOU MAY PERCEIVE IT TO BE OR HOW GOOD YOU MAY PERCEIVE IT TO BE, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT, BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, I JUST TRY TO DO MY BEST EVERY DAY, YOU KNOW, REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION. WE TAKE THE HANDS WE'RE DEALT. WE MAKE THE MOST OF IT. THAT'S THE WAY WE MAKE IT THROUGH LIFE. Damien: YOU NEVER, EVER GET SUNLIGHT. I HAVEN'T BEEN EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT IN ALMOST SEVEN YEARS NOW. YOU'RE IN A CELL PRETTY MUCH, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. IF I FOCUSED ON THE THINGS I CAN'T CHANGE, THE THINGS THAT HAVE HURT ME, WHAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE TO ME, THEN THEY WOULD'VE ALREADY BROKEN ME. THEY WOULD'VE HAVE KILLED ME INSIDE AND OUT. I GET UP IN THE MORNING AND I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF. I DON'T HATE MY LIFE. YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HERE THAT ALL THEY CAN THINK ABOUT IS WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE AND HOW MUCH THEY WANT OUT AND HOW MUCH THEY WANT SOMETHING ELSE. BUT FOR SOME REASON THIS SITUATION HAS HELPED ME TO SEE MORE OF WHAT I DO HAVE AND TO BE THANKFUL FOR THAT. YOU KNOW, I HAVE-- IN A LOT OF WAYS I HAVE A TRULY INCREDIBLE LIFE. Darrell Greene: IN LESS THAN 17 HOURS, THE FATES OF DAMIEN ECHOLS JASON BALDWIN, AND JESSIE MISSKELLEY COULD BE DECIDED. A SPECIAL HEARING IN JONESBORO WILL BRING TOGETHER FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND THE THREE CONVICTED MURDERERS KNOWN AS THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE FOR WHAT COULD BE AN EXPLOSIVE RESOLUTION IN THIS INFAMOUS CASE. ( police siren whooping ) ( police radio chatter ) Male reporter: NOW JUDGE DAVID BURNETT-- HE WAS THE JUDGE WHO REJECTED THAT THE NEW D.N.A. TESTING SHOULD GET THEM A NEW TRIAL-- HE WAS ELECTED TO THE STATE SENATE LAST YEAR, SO A NEW JUDGE, JUDGE DAVID LASER, WAS APPOINTED. THAT'S A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE CASE. ALSO THE SUPREME COURT DISAGREED WITH FORMER JUDGE BURNETT AND SAID THE D.N.A. TESTING DID WARRANT AT LEAST A HEARING TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW TRIAL. NOW THAT HEARING WAS SET FOR DECEMBER, BUT YESTERDAY JUDGE LASER AND THE ATTORNEYS INVOLVED SURPRISED EVERYBODY BY CALLING THIS HEARING TODAY. Male reporter #2: IT COULD ALL COME TO AN END OR JUST MARK THE BEGINNING FOR EVEN MORE OF THE SAME. Male reporter: SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN? ARE THEY JUST LITERAL-- I MEAN, THEY'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF KILLING THESE KIDS. ARE THEY JUST GOING TO WALK OUT OF JAIL? Female reporter: WELL, WHAT WE HAVE HEARD, WHAT COULD HAPPEN TODAY IS THAT THEY COULD ENTER SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL CALLED "ALFORD PLEAS." AND THE THREE MEN WILL SAY, "LOOK, WE ARE INNOCENT, BUT IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF JAIL, WE WILL PLEAD GUILTY." I AM DAVID LASER, CIRCUIT JUDGE, DIVISION NINE, THE SECOND JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS. SUBJECT TO THE COURT'S APPROVAL, CERTAIN DISPOSITIVE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED BY AND BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE DEFENDANTS IN THIS CASE. THE ALFORD PLEA-- IT'S A GUILTY PLEA WITH A PROFESSION OF INNOCENCE. IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE, MR. ECHOLS, MR. BALDWIN, MR. MISSKELLEY, IF YOU WOULD STAND, PLEASE. MR. ECHOLS, HOW DO YOU WISH TO PLEAD IN THIS CASE? MR. BALDWIN, HOW DO YOU CHOOSE TO PLEAD IN THIS CASE? THE SAME AS RELATES TO YOU, MR. MISSKELLEY, HOW DO YOU WISH TO PLEAD? ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. THE COURT FINDS EACH OF THE DEFENDANTS GUILTY OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER AND THE MODIFIED CHARGES. ( voice fades ) AT THIS MOMENT THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE ARE FREE. Female anchor: OKAY, SO JUST FOR CLARITY, THEN, DAVID, IT'S NOT THAT THESE CONVICTIONS WERE OVERTURNED. THEY ARE STILL GUILTY, BUT THEY WERE FREED. NOW THIS-- AT THE ROOT OF THIS CHANGE IS D.N.A. EVIDENCE OR LACK THEREOF. IS THAT CORRECT? Male reporter: THAT WAS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS THAT CAME TO THE COURT'S ATTENTION THIS YEAR. NOW, IF THEY DID NOT GO THROUGH WITH THIS DEAL TODAY, THOSE THREE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY GRANTED A NEW TRIAL LATER THIS YEAR. BUT THAT TRIAL COULD HAVE TAKEN YEARS TO COMPLETE. SO THE JUDGE-- AGAIN, REITERATING, "THIS WAS IN THE BEST INTERESTS," HE SAID, "FOR EVERYONE." THIS IS NOT RIGHT. AND THE PEOPLE OF ARKANSAS NEED TO STAND UP AND RAISE HELL, BECAUSE THREE INNOCENT MEN ARE GONNA HAVE TO CLAIM TODAY THAT THEY'RE GUILTY FOR A CRIME THEY DIDN'T KNOW, AND THAT'S BULLSHIT. - Woman: AMEN. - ( crowd cheering ) THEY'RE INNOCENT. THEY DID NOT KILL MY SON. AND THIS IS WRONG WHAT THE STATE OF ARKANSAS IS DOING TO COVER THEIR ASS. AND I'M SICK OF IT. BECAUSE THE REAL KILLER IS WALKING AROUND FREE. SOME ARE HAPPY, SOME ARE ANGRY, AND SOME ARE PERPLEXED. AND THAT'S THE CASE AT THE END OF EVERY TRIAL. AND THIS ONE IS NO DIFFERENT. GUILT OR INNOCENCE WAS NEVER ON THE TABLE. TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS ALLOWS THE DEFENDANTS TO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT GUILTY, BUT IN FACT THEY JUST PLED GUILTY. THE LEGAL TANGLE THAT HAS BECOME KNOWN AS THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE CASE IS NOW FINISHED. Woman: DAMIEN, WITH THE ALFORD PLEA, YOU HAD TO SAY, FOR THE COURT'S PURPOSE, THAT YOU'RE GUILTY OF A CRIME THAT YOU PROFESSED TO THE JUDGE THAT YOU DID NOT COMMIT. - RIGHT. - IS THIS JUSTICE? IS THIS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR? IS IT BITTERSWEET? IT'S NOT PERFECT. IT'S NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS. BUT AT LEAST IT BRINGS CLOSURE TO SOME AREAS AND SOME ASPECTS. YOU KNOW, WE CAN STILL BRING UP NEW EVIDENCE. WE CAN STILL CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATIONS WE'VE BEEN DOING. WE CAN STILL TRY TO CLEAR OUR NAMES. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS NOW WE CAN DO IT FROM THE OUTSIDE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SIT IN PRISON AND DO IT. YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER 18 YEARS, AND IT'S-- IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE LIVING HELL. Joe Berlinger: WERE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENSE WAS GOING TO PRESENT AT THE UPCOMING EVIDENTIARY HEARING, INCLUDING JUROR MISCONDUCT-- ALLEGATIONS OF JUROR MISCONDUCT? Scott Ellington: WHEN THE SUPREME COURT HANDED DOWN THIS DECISION ON NOVEMBER THE 4th OF LAST YEAR, REOPENING ISSUES OF JUROR MISCONDUCT AND EVERYTHING-- AND ALL THESE OTHER MATTERS ON THE BASIS OF NEW D.N.A., THEN THAT CAUSED SOME-- SOME TROUBLES. AND THIS JUDGE WAS MOST LIKELY GOING TO GRANT A NEW TRIAL. AND IF THIS JUDGE GRANTED A NEW TRIAL, THE DEFENDANTS MOST LIKELY-- I MEAN, WE WOULD DO THE BEST WE COULD TO PREVAIL ON THE EVIDENCE, BUT MOST LIKELY THESE DEFENDANTS, THE STATE BELIEVES, COULD VERY EASILY HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED. - YES, MA'AM. - Woman: WILL THE STATE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION'S BROUGHT FORTH OR IS THE CASE CLOSED? I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN THE HOMICIDE OF THESE THREE CHILDREN BUT THE THREE DEFENDANTS WHO PLED GUILTY TODAY. LET ME JUST POINT OUT ONE ASPECT OF WHAT HAPPENED TODAY: THESE MEN NOT ONLY WALKED OUT, THEY CREATED TODAY, BY THIS PLEA, TO ME, PROOF POSITIVE OF THEIR INNOCENCE AND THE STATE'S RECOGNITION OF IT. BECAUSE DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THAT IF THE STATE HAD EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CONTINUING CONVICTION THAT THEY WERE GUILTY, THAT THEY WOULD LET THESE MEN FREE TODAY? IT WOULD'VE NEVER HAPPENED. BUT TO ME, THE STATE'S ACCEPTANCE OF AN ALFORD PLEA, IN WHICH THEY MAINTAIN THEIR INNOCENCE, AND RELEASING THEM, IS EVIDENCE OF THE STATE'S RECOGNITION OF THEIR INNOCENCE. Woman: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE STATE OF ARKANSAS TODAY? THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS CASE AND THAT THIS IS OVER TODAY-- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? WELL, I THINK FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS AND THE OFFICE THAT I REPRESENT, IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TERMINATED PROLONGED LITIGATION; WE HAVE TERMINATED ADDITIONAL APPEALS AND APPEAL HEARINGS. WE'VE ALSO, AS PART OF THE-- I MEAN, WITH THEIR ENTRY OF A PLEA OF GUILTY, WE HAVE REMOVED THE QUESTION OF THEM FILING A CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST THE STATE THAT COULD RESULT IN MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I CAN'T SAY THAT THAT WASN'T PART OF MYTHINKING IN RESOLVING THIS CASE FOR THE BEST OF THIS STATE AND FOR TRYING TO MOVE THIS CASE FORWARD AND END IT. THIS WAS NOT JUSTICE, YOU KNOW. IN THE BEGINNING WE TOLD NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH-- THAT WE WERE INNOCENT-- AND THEY SENT US TO PRISON FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES FOR IT. AND THEN WE HAD TO COME HERE, AND THE ONLY THING THAT THE STATE WOULD DO FOR US WAS TO SAY, "HEY, WE'LL LET YOU GO ONLY IF YOU ADMIT GUILT." AND THAT'S NOT JUSTICE, NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE TRYING TO FIND WHO REALLY MURDERED THOSE BOYS. AND I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE THE DEAL FROM THE GET-GO. HOWEVER, THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL DAMIEN. AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA BITE THE GUN TO SAVE SOMEBODY. I WANT TO PUBLICLY THANK JASON, TOO, JUST TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I DO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT HE DID, THAT HE DID WANT TO KEEP FIGHTING. HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THIS DEAL IN THE BEGINNING. AND I RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE DID DO IT ALMOST ENTIRELY FOR ME. THANK YOU. ( cheering ) Jason: THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WRONG WITH OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM TODAY. PEOPLE HAVE PREJUDICES. PEOPLE HAVE FEARS. PEOPLE HAVE HATES. THESE THINGS CLOUD OUR ABILITY TO REASON. WE ALSO HAVE COMPASSION, LOVE, MERCY. BUT WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE TO PROTECT AND SERVE-- THEY GET SO DESENSITIZED AND THEY LOSE THE ABILITY TO REASON. THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO REAWAKEN THE COMPASSION IN THE PEOPLE WHO RUN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. UNDER THE STATE SEAL OF ARKANSAS, ON THE BANNER, IT SAYS "JUSTICE" ON ONE HAND AND "MERCY" ON THE OTHER. JUSTICE IS LOST. IT'S BROKEN. MY CASE IN POINT: I TOLD THE TRUTH THAT I'M INNOCENT-- THEY REFUSED TO LET ME GO DURING MY TRIAL. I TAKE AN ALFORD PLEA TODAY, SAY I'M GUILTY WHEN REALLY I'M INNOCENT, BUT JUST SAY I'M GUILTY AND TAKE THIS TIME-- AND WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY LET ME GO. THAT'S NOT JUSTICE. IT'S UP TO US AS A PEOPLE TO CHANGE IT. IT STARTS WITH ALL OF US. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THE DECISION TO TAKE EACH PERSON ON THEIR MERIT AND NOT JUST LUMP EVERYBODY INTO SOMETHING THAT WE HATE, MISTRUST, DON'T KNOW ABOUT. THESE ARE THE VERY PRINCIPLES OUR COUNTRY IS BUILT UPON, BUT IT'S SO HARD TO PRACTICE. HANG ONTO THAT. GRAB IT. IT'S OURS. WE NEED IT. IT'S WHAT KEEPS US GOING, KEEPS US ALIVE. IT'S WHAT PREVENTS THINGS LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME, DAMIEN, AND JESSIE FROM HAPPENING. * JUST KEEP THEM CLOSED, KEEP PRAYING * * JUST KEEP WAITING * WAITING FOR THE ONE * THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES * * WHEN YOU STAND UP AND FEEL THE WARMTH * * BUT THE SUNSHINE NEVER COMES, NO * * NO, THE SUNSHINE NEVER COMES * * PUSH YOU ACROSS THAT LINE * JUST STAY DOWN THIS TIME * HIDE IN YOURSELF * CRAWL IN YOURSELF * YOU'LL HAVE YOUR TIME * GOD, I'LL MAKE THEM PAY * TAKE IT BACK ONE DAY * I'LL END THIS DAY * I'LL SPLATTER COLOR * ON THIS GRAY * WAITING FOR THE ONE * THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES * WHEN YOU STAND UP AND FEEL THE WARMTH * * BUT THE SUNSHINE NEVER COMES * * LOVE IS A FOUR-LETTER WORD * * AND NEVER SPOKEN HERE * LOVE IS A FOUR-LETTER WORD * * HERE IN THIS PRISON * I SUFFER THIS NO LONGER * I PUT AN END TO * THIS I SWEAR, THIS I SWEAR * * THE SUN WILL SHINE, THIS I SWEAR, THIS I SWEAR * * THIS I SWEAR.

It is what I shall try to do. <i>This is nothing more than the ghost</i> <i>of the house where I was born.</i> <i>A fatal ruin, a final vision,</i> <i>with nothing surprising for anyone.</i> <i>But to one for whom it was</i> <i>the cradle in which he grew up,</i> <i>where he became aware of himself</i> <i>and of the world,</i> <i>a painful longing</i> <i>remains in his soul.</i> Oh, how many years ago Did I depart in tears From my cosy Caring home Twenty, Thirty? Do I not even know when My old nanny You who are watching me Sing me songs So I may remember I have been around the world I have been around life I only found cheating Deception, sorrow Oh! How disillusioned Is the innocent soul My old nanny With your doleful voice Sing me songs To set me to sleep <i>In front of the proud house</i> <i>there rose three leafy lindens,</i> <i>the protectors of a beautiful</i> <i>garden, the Eden of my boyhood.</i> My heart is broken With bitterness See what deep pain lies In my misty gaze Oh, had I never left My narrow nest My old nanny Sing me songs Sing me songs To lull me to sleep <i>From high up at the windows</i> <i>one enjoyed a vast view of the city.</i> God once gave me in The down of the nest Precious stones from stars Gems of moonlight See, I have been robbed of Everything along the way My old nanny I am a wretched poor man Sing me songs To make me cry Like once before In the beloved lap I am dying, dying Let me rest! Oh, how your little boy Has changed My old nanny How he has changed Sing him songs to sleep To dream Sing me songs, softly So, so softly Sad, so sad Like the sea at night Sing me songs to see If I can manage To make my soul sleep Be at peace, at rest When soon Death Comes to take it from me <i>Once, a long time ago, there was</i> <i>only one birth there, mine,</i> <i>there was only one death there,</i> <i>that of my father.</i> <i>The years have passed</i> <i>and the times have changed.</i> <i>Everything has been taken,</i> <i>everything has been forgotten.</i> <i>It only remains alive</i> <i>in my sad memory.</i> <i>"Eu sou toureiro, toureador</i> <i>Bandarilheiro, farpeador."</i> <i>My parents had a season ticket</i> <i>to the opera,</i> <i>and had another box</i> <i>at the Sh da Bandeira Theatre.</i> <i>I remember this scene</i> <i>from the operetta Miss Diabo,</i> <i>by the distinguished Oporto authors</i> <i>Arnaldo Leite and Carvalho Barbosa,</i> <i>just as I saw it</i> <i>from box number 16.</i> Hands up! - Hands up! - And the step backwards. I fell in like a duck! Hands up! Okay Madame! You'd better point that away, it might be loaded and I don't want to march off to the angels. Would you like one, Madame? Don't worry, Madame, this won't kill anyone from a distance. This is a real good smoke! Put that thing away and let me suck this beauty in peace. That tool wasn't made for lady's fingers. Put that down! Will you put it down or not? Who lives here? My father, the servants and me. And the dog that almost ruined my trousers. What now? Are you going to call the police? No, I'm not. In fact I thank you for coming. I have finally seen a. A thief? You can say it. I don't stand on ceremony. But, what's this? Bravo, we have music! - Do you play? - I scratch a little. It's obligatory. I was born in the Moorish Quarter. Criminal hands Sad rejected hands Capricious Desolate Hands of hunger And bitterness Criminal hands Sad rejected hands Capricious Desolate Hands of hunger And bitterness Hands of Fado singers Who never sought A sweet kiss from you Hands to whom I give All my impure life Chilly hands Poor, frightened hands Foreboding, aching hands Now weary of suffering Hands of wretchedness That sob out a Fado song On the guitar. Hands that freeze And that Death will forget <i>I remember the Hanging Tree,</i> <i>which at the time existed</i> <i>in the Cordoaria Gardens.</i> <i>And I used to ask whether thieves</i> <i>were also hanged there.</i> <i>I never got an answer.</i> <i>I was afraid. And in the</i> <i>dark night, seized by fear,</i> <i>I found security in hearing</i> <i>the horse guard go by.</i> <i>I don't know whether it was</i> <i>to chase away my fear of thieves</i> <i>or through a desire to travel</i> <i>through the deserted streets at night,</i> <i>I asked if we could take</i> <i>the long way home.</i> <i>My mother indulged me</i> <i>in my whim,</i> <i>and told the chauffeur to do so.</i> <i>The chauffeur's name was.</i> <i>Lamas.</i> <i>The chauffeur was called Lamas.</i> <i>Lamas, that's it!</i> <i>His name was Lamas!</i> <i>This is the street were</i> <i>my long-gone house used to exist.</i> <i>It is named the 9th of July,</i> <i>because, on the 9th of July 1832,</i> <i>King Dom Pedro IV's troops</i> <i>came along this street,</i> <i>having disembarked on Mindelo</i> <i>Beach on the previous day.</i> <i>This is King Dom Pedro IV,</i> <i>the Liberator,</i> <i>who left his heart to Oporto,</i> <i>the City that was the birthplace</i> <i>of the Liberty of the Nation.</i> <i>Almeida Garrett,</i> <i>a poet and a liberal from Oporto,</i> <i>disembarked with King Don Pedro's</i> <i>troops. And he sang like this.</i> <i>"When I dreamt, it was like this</i> <i>That I saw it in my dream</i> <i>"It was like this that the fleeting</i> <i>"Image that I could never reach</i> <i>Would flee from me</i> <i>"Now that I am awake,</i> <i>Now that I see it stare.</i> <i>"What for? When it was vague,</i> <i>An idea, a thought,</i> <i>"An uncertain shine of star</i> <i>In an immense firmament,</i> <i>"Achimera, a vain dream</i> <i>I dreamt, but I lived</i> <i>"I knew not what pleasure was</i> <i>But pain, I felt it not."</i> <i>With my head pressed against the</i> <i>glass of one of those windows,</i> <i>looking at the city, I sometimes</i> <i>thought of the beggars</i> <i>who asked for alms</i> <i>outside Sunday Mass,</i> <i>and I saw myself with my hand</i> <i>outstretched like them,</i> <i>next to my mother.</i> <i>And I saw myself as naturally as I <i>had seen the actors in the theatre.</i> <i>I also heard of someone</i> <i>who had fallen into disgrace</i> <i>and wretchedness. And I thought.</i> What if a similar misfortune befalls us? <i>I added a thousand</i> <i>other possible misfortunes,</i> <i>which clouded my mind</i> <i>like breath on the glass.</i> <i>And then I thought</i> <i>that I could perhaps</i> <i>work as an apprentice stonemason.</i> <i>It was a tradition</i> <i>passed down from father to son.</i> <i>I liked to watch them work.</i> <i>But could I do it? I still remember</i> <i>the song they hummed,</i> <i>when they were dragging</i> <i>a large stone</i> <i>and they moved it</i> <i>with long iron poles,</i> <i>two men on each side,</i> <i>as if rowing rhythmically.</i> <i>Stone. oh!</i> <i>Stone. hey!</i> <i>Stone. oh!</i> <i>Stone. hey!</i> <i>The profession</i> <i>of these honest stonemasons,</i> <i>as humble as it is noble.</i> <i>In those days all the houses</i> <i>were built of stone.</i> <i>A beautiful tradition</i> <i>that is now lost,</i> <i>as can be seen</i> <i>in the old houses and palaces,</i> <i>and in what remains of</i> <i>the old wall around the city.</i> <i>As sweet-toothed as I was,</i> <i>when they used to take me</i> <i>to the confectioner's shops</i> <i>in the afternoon,</i> <i>I used to hide,</i> <i>hoping to be left behind,</i> <i>and to be able to enjoy</i> <i>all those pastries.</i> <i>The Confeitaria Oliveira</i> <i>a cake-shop was my favourite</i> <i>and was considered</i> <i>to be the most chic.</i> <i>But I wasn't attracted</i> <i>by the luxury.</i> - It was the pastries! - <i>It was the pastries.</i> <i>There were the "babhs" and others.</i> <i>But the puff pastries</i> <i>with egg-paste filling,</i> <i>the ones they called "cocus"</i> <i>those were really good.</i> Those pastries are delicious! <i>But the cake-shop disappeared,</i> <i>and the cakes went with it.</i> <i>This is it today.</i> <i>I'm just remembering</i> <i>a curious episode I witnessed.</i> <i>At that time the tradition was</i> <i>At that time the tradition was</i> <i>to have two exhibitions</i> <i>at the Crystal Palace,</i> <i>the Motor Show</i> <i>and the Flower Show.</i> Because of their similarity and being stopped at rest, this is certainly the poets Fernando Pessoa, on the left, and Josm Rmgio. <i>Another tradition</i> <i>was the after-dinner stroll,</i> <i>a back and forth</i> <i>along the Avenida das Tilias,</i> <i>where it was chic</i> <i>for the society ladies</i> <i>to show off their dresses</i> <i>in the latest fashions.</i> <i>There were some houses opposite</i> <i>the Crystal Palace gardens.</i> <i>In one of them, which belonged</i> <i>to my uncle Casimiro,</i> <i>I stayed along with brother,</i> <i>his godson,</i> <i>living with my cousins</i> <i>while my parents travelled abroad.</i> - <i>My cousins were.</i> - <i>Antunio and his sisters.</i> <i>Virgqnia,</i> <i>Alice,</i> <i>Ammlia,</i> <i>Maria,</i> <i>Guilhermina,</i> <i>and Helena.</i> <i>Of the three youngest ones,</i> <i>the ones closest to my age,</i> <i>the most romantic was Guilhermina,</i> <i>and we were sweethearts.</i> <i>At night I used to go upstairs</i> <i>to meet her,</i> <i>careful not to wake anyone.</i> <i>These were</i> <i>our very green years and,</i> <i>with the innocence of children,</i> <i>we would exchange a pure kiss.</i> <i>Careful!</i> <i>And immediately run off in fright</i> <i>to our respective bedrooms,</i> <i>carrying with us the delight of</i> <i>that sweet and innocent adventure.</i> <i>Time passed.</i> <i>Guilhermina disappeared forever,</i> <i>with tuberculosis, like her brother.</i> <i>The houses are now different,</i> <i>only the memory of the brief</i> <i>encounter has remained.</i> <i>And in this old Crystal Palace</i> <i>they continued to have</i> <i>a Motor Show every autumn.</i> <i>We were in 1922,</i> <i>the date of the</i> <i>Lisbon-Rio Atlantic crossing</i> <i>for the first time</i> <i>in the history of aviation,</i> <i>with the sextant of Gago Coutinho and</i> <i>Sacadura Cabral flying this plane.</i> <i>Somewhat later on</i> <i>a branch of the Confeitaria Oliveira</i> <i>opened here</i> <i>in the Rua 31 de Janeiro,</i> <i>the date commemorating</i> <i>the Oporto Movement,</i> <i>the first attempt to set up</i> <i>a republic in Portugal.</i> <i>The shop window was protected</i> <i>by a thick yellow metal rail,</i> <i>against which certain bohemians</i> <i>used to lean in the afternoon.</i> <i>bohemians who were. raffinms.</i> - <i>Raffinms. and a little pedantic!</i> <i>Raffinm. was Joel,</i> <i>with his monocle.</i> <i>And Diogo, who always</i> <i>came along in uniform</i> <i>and acting like a lady-killer.</i> <i>The youngest one, Chico,</i> <i>had a certain blasm air.</i> - Blasm. Very blasm. - <i>We nicknamed him "Fantasias".</i> <i>Fantasias thought</i> <i>it was of no interest</i> <i>to carry on living</i> <i>after the age of forty.</i> I think it is really inelegant for a man to let himself grow old. <i>Longevity was shorter</i> <i>in those days,</i> <i>and forty was a ripe old age.</i> That's what you say, but you don't know why you say it. - Oh, yeah? I say what I feel. - But you don't know what you feel. And you do? - I think there is a reason. - You think so? Well explain it. It's simple. Men like women, don't they? And women like men, don't they? I think we've understood that! Before there used to be the androgen, which included the masculine and the feminine. They were happy! So? What do you mean by that? That when they were together they didn't have to look for each other. How dull. You think it's dull? That's the way it was. And from this union the masculine came out on one side and the feminine on the other. That's where the expression 'soul mate' comes from. Yes, I like the soul mate bit. Well, what Fantasias wants is to bring the two parts together. That's what we all want! Exactly. And so, what Fantasias is afraid of is that when he reaches forty he will lose strength. Lose his power of attraction over women. But has anyone ever heard you say you would kill yourself at forty? I don't have to. I'll never get there. Prettier and prettier! <i>It was extravagances like this that</i> <i>attracted the younger boys like me.</i> <i>They would tell tales of scandals.</i> <i>Shocking things</i> <i>that aroused our imagination.</i> <i>Today's youth is rather different</i> <i>and the metal rail on which</i> <i>those bohemians used to lean</i> <i>no longer exists.</i> <i>Today, it is this.</i> <i>I fell</i> <i>into the bohemian lifestyle early.</i> <i>I started frequenting nightclubs</i> <i>here, at the Palace,</i> <i>the largest and most popular one.</i> <i>From the Palace we went on</i> <i>to the Clube do Porto,</i> <i>which was smaller and more refined.</i> <i>Here there was the Primavera,</i> <i>which was more popular,</i> <i>and which always acted as a last</i> <i>resort to find an available lady.</i> Have a seat. Girl, come here. Have a seat. - Get your paws off. rascal! - Don't be coy, sit down here. Will you let go or do you want trouble? Hello, sharp guy! The lady whore has an owner! - To each its own, my friend! - Now you're talking! - There goes the merchandise. - It's a little difficult today. Be careful. This is full of pimps today. So I see, so I see. It's a little difficult today. Tell her to sit down here. Sit down here with us. I'm promised to another guy. I've got to go. Shame. A great shame! Some other night. When I come. And you come too. Cutie. Don't pay any attention to these lads. They just want free rides. They're nice. Nice? But they won't give you anything! It doesn't matter. They're nice. What about me? You? My darling! You give me great comfort. - Cod. - Squid. Women pay no attention to us. We have to become philosophers. Women, always women. An American woman scandalizes feminist society because she preaches a return to the home and to the minute details of correct upbringing. How to behave at table and to say thank you. Jesus never washed his hands before eating, which surely did not go unnoticed by the highborn disciples. It wouldn't be Peter, the fisherman, who would notice his Master's lack of etiquette. The fact is that nowadays women move in a difficult terrain, having to opt for children or a career. They eat badly, do their hair to appear on television, and hardly look in the mirror in order to look at their watches. It is extraordinary how a watch outdoes a pearl necklace. In a few years women will have to choose between the kindergarten teacher, the technician in a company, workshop or laboratory, and the geisha. A geisha also needs a university degree. She knows about music and books, she reads Espinosa, consults the dictionary, personally knows Valentino and has an apartment in Ille de France with a view over the Bois de Bologne. She does not go on cruises to the Caribbean or to Tahiti, she bets on the horses and, above all, she stopped playing golf since it became a way for the bourgeois to keep their names and feet clean. The geisha may be sixty years old and be magnificent. She has many admirers and very few lovers. Men are proud of her, confide their secrets in her, and do not expect her to undress or to cut up the meat on their plates. The geisha is a misdemeanour of democracy, but without misdemeanours there is no culture, so there you have it. <i>Other times I used to come here</i> <i>with Adolfo Casais Monteiro,</i> <i>who I met before he had published</i> <i>his poems, 'Confusao', in 1929,</i> <i>and his companion</i> <i>Rodrigues de Freitas,</i> <i>the author of the short story</i> <i>'Meninos Milionhrios',</i> <i>which would later inspire me</i> <i>for my film 'Aniki-Bobu'.</i> <i>This is where the Cafm Central</i> <i>used to exist,</i> <i>where I used to meet with Casais</i> <i>and Freitas, university students,</i> <i>and with others, some of whom</i> <i>were students of fine arts,</i> <i>like Boaventura Porfirio,</i> <i>Camarinha, Augusto Gomes,</i> <i>Alvarez, and the architect</i> <i>Januhrio Godinho.</i> <i>The group was more visionary</i> <i>than political,</i> <i>and was not welcomed</i> <i>by the regime.</i> <i>It also included philosophers</i> <i>and poets,</i> <i>with a natural propensity</i> <i>towards ascending to the sublime.</i> <i>From the Central we moved on</i> <i>to the Cafm Majestic,</i> <i>a magnificent work of the</i> <i>ornamentation of the twenties</i> <i>by the architect Joao Queiruz.</i> <i>The Cafm Majestic was fashionable</i> <i>then, and is so again today,</i> <i>now conserved just as is was</i> <i>when it opened.</i> <i>We used to get together</i> <i>in this corner and,</i> <i>on other occasions</i> <i>and at other times of day,</i> <i>I would come here on my own.</i> <i>And here I withdrew</i> <i>to write almost the whole plan</i> <i>for a film, 'Gigantes Do Douro',</i> <i>that I was stupidly</i> <i>not allowed to make</i> <i>because it showed the effort</i> <i>carried out by workers</i> <i>to transform the steep slopes</i> <i>into terraces,</i> <i>and afterwards planting</i> <i>and cultivating the vines,</i> <i>up to the extracting of the precious</i> <i>nectar that is our Port Wine.</i> <i>Times that have now gone,</i> <i>but which have left forgotten</i> <i>a work that was unique,</i> <i>difficult and cruel,</i> <i>and today is done by machines.</i> <i>This was in 1934.</i> <i>We ended up in the Cafm Palladium,</i> <i>located on the ground floor</i> <i>of this remarkable building,</i> <i>the Grandes Armazmns Nascimento,</i> <i>the work of the great architect</i> <i>Marques da Silva.</i> <i>Very late on certain nights,</i> <i>we liked to wander through</i> <i>the dark alleys of the old city.</i> <i>Besides me there were Casais,</i> <i>Rodrigues de Freitas</i> <i>and Antunio Silva.</i> <i>We would stroll through the alleys,</i> <i>giving free rein to our imagination.</i> <i>Casais Monteiro, a humanist poet,</i> <i>was arrested</i> <i>and persecuted by the regime.</i> <i>He ended up taking refuge</i> <i>in Brazil.</i> <i>The years went by</i> <i>and his exile reminded me</i> <i>of the figure of the Desterrado.</i> <i>Soares dos Reis, the sculptor,</i> <i>committed suicide,</i> <i>when he felt insulted</i> <i>by the accusation</i> <i>that he had plagiarized Rodin's</i> <i>The Thinker. An unjust accusation.</i> <i>What the 'Desterrado' expresses</i> <i>is longing.</i> <i>And it seems to hold, in its hands</i> <i>crossed and resting on its knees,</i> <i>the deep sadness</i> <i>coming down from its face.</i> <i>Adolfo Casais Monteiro</i> <i>died in exile.</i> <i>His bitterness towards</i> <i>his homeland</i> <i>and the despondency</i> <i>he received from Europe</i> <i>were overshadowed</i> <i>by hopefulness,</i> <i>as is shown</i> <i>in his long poem 'Europe',</i> <i>broadcast by the BBC in London</i> <i>in 1945.</i> <i>"Europe, without future</i> <i>Europe, morning to

Make some noise!</i> <i>Swedish House Mafia headlined Coachella and sold out Madison Square Garden.</i> <i>Thousands of gigs. Millions of fans.</i> You can't explain it. You got to experience it. News has reached us that the successful group Swedish House Mafia is splitting up. <i>Swedish House Mafia are breaking up.</i> <i>They stated on their website it was no more.</i> <i>Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso.</i> ..their next tour is their final one. I don't know why they would end it. It's ridiculous. They should keep going. They can get better. Got to move on and make new things. Maybe they'll rejoin, who knows? <i>Steve Angello, Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso!</i> What's the plan now? A big tour? Yes, a big world tour. That's the plan for now. And what's happening after the tour? Well, I guess we're all going to pick up on our solo careers. And keep making music. As usual. -Have you guys fallen out? Is there a problem? -No, no. How is it going to work if it is like this? It's not going to work. I like to make music while I'm getting ready. You're listening, but in a passive mode. This is the best bit. The best part is when the beat comes in, and then there's an immediate pause. I mean, it just started! It's awesome. Then it comes back. It's like. Just got my laundry back. When I arrived, I only had five clean T-shirts. But now I've washed pretty much everything. Well, now I have 16 T-shirts. I'm not feeling this T-shirt. I feel fat and swollen. Damn, I didn't bring a hoodie or anything. Weird. I don't feel comfortable in this. Wait… Goddamnit. Can't forget the wedding ring. Where the hell are my cigarettes? Oh, well, fuck it. <i>Swedish House Mafia have released tickets to their One Last Tour,</i> <i>50 shows in 26 countries.</i> It's all about getting into tour mode now. We need to be warmed up and ready. <i>There are obviously reasons why they're breaking up the band.</i> <i>I mean, how are they going to keep it together for that whole world tour?</i> <i>Swedish House Mafia sold out Madison Square Garden in nine minutes.</i> <i>It's Jojo on the radio. In the studio with me is Swedish House Mafia.</i> They're unique from anything else in the industry. And they made house music popular. They say two minds are better than one. How about three minds? It puts you in a good mood, lifts your spirits. Their own individual styles, the way they've come together as a group. We're so excited about it. <i>The stage is built of 26 Kinesys motors that are holding up three flying video screens.</i> Two in front, one in the back. It pushes all the energy out front. They're very powerful. That's a lot of laser. -There's about 800 LED panels on there. -That's so bright. It's probably the most elaborate pyrotechnics these guys ever had on any tour. These are the PRG Bad Boys. We have three, one for each guy on stage. It's going to be an assault on all senses. It's very important that we are at the top of our game, because this is the biggest thing we've ever done together. <i>This is THE essential new tune</i> <i>and it is the brand new single from the Swedish House Mafia, eagerly awaited.</i> <i>It's called </i>Don't You Worry Child<i>.</i> Steve Angello has arrived. Over. It's small, isn't it? -It's massive. -Yeah, no kidding. What's up? -It's big but… -But also intimate. It feels kind of naturally big. It's not like…! Maybe a bit, actually. -Oh, damn. -Massive. Oh, God, it's massive. Wait! Wait! Wait! Before it drops, what happened there? What happened with the lights.? That was a different mix to the other one… -Well, you're always going to hear a different mix. -Oh, I know. We need some. Something. It looks kind of dead there. Let's do it. I like this part best, 'cause you can see how big it is. Check it out now. Everyone is gonna go like this! The love is everywhere. -Can we take a picture real quick? -We don't have time. -We came from California… -See you tonight. Yeah, awesome. Cool. My shrink just told me, "Try to avoid stress and take it easy over the next few days." Swedish House Mafia! Swedish House Mafia! Stand by. Fifteen seconds to go. <i>We got artists walking.</i> <i>It's the beginning of the end. What emotions are going through all of you?</i> <i>I don't really think of it as an end. Now it feels like a beginning of something.</i> <i>You're going around all these parts with your best friends</i> <i>and just having fun and exploring,</i> <i>playing the biggest venues around the world. It's a dream come true.</i> <i>I'm looking forward to hanging out, really, with all of the guys.</i> <i>I'm sure we'll have some fun.</i> <i>I'm happy we're travelling the world together and that we're going to do this once and for all</i> <i>and just go out with a bang and just do this.</i> Swedish House Mafia! -Ingrosso! -Axwell is tight! Fuck me, that was awesome. Insane. Swedish House Mafia are legends. They are in my heart, my blood… Swedish House Mafia, you can't stop now! What's up, man? Messy girl. We can wave you off outside. Daddy loves you. Goodbye. She doesn't care as long as she gets to play. Bye, Mum. Goodbye. What do you want for Christmas? -A watch. -A watch? I want a daddy-watch. Do you want a watch like daddy's? -In black. -You want it in black? OK. Same size? -What? -Diamonds! I'll see you soon. Sing opera. -You want me to sing opera? -Hm. -Like you were singing in the car. -In the car? That was our secret! Daddy, come on! Do it, fatty! -Come on, please, Dad! -OK, fine, hang on… Daddy, do it, you lazy man. Leon! -OK, thanks. -You're welcome. See you when I get back. Yeah, that's good. At the end of the tour we're going to quit this. One last cigarette. -One last. -I don't have a lighter. <i>"Partouze".</i> My father started a record company in '89, Plumphouse and Loop Records, that released a lot of deep, tech house, techno, acid house. I fell in love with the energy and the intense, you know. The whole, "My God, what's happening?" Something happened to my body with the beats coming in and the bass drum and the toms and everything building up to something I'd never heard before, it was something new. I felt that some day people will feel this. People will love this because I can't be wrong. So my mission was to find other people doing what I did. I'm going to tell you how I met Steve. He was a DJ. He was a hip hop DJ. We would hang out with the same people and we grew in to each other. We saw that we had the same interests and he had two turntables before anyone, because you couldn't get the Technics 1210s anywhere. I always bought vinyls and went to him to listen to it because I didn't have a vinyl player. He was like, "Man, you need to stop listening to this music. What the fuck is wrong with you?" I had orange pants, my hair in the back, my glow-in-the-dark T-shirt, standing and jumping in his room and he was sitting there smoking weed with his, you know, baggy pants and the whole swagger Steve has. A lot of energy, you know. He was always very happy and very funny. And he always wanted to do stuff, you know, he had spikes and Buffalos. This real rave kid. He made hip hop beats. I was just partying and coming into my puberty and drinking beer. And he just wanted to work. Then we went to my father's office. I'd just got this CD called <i>Homework </i>by Daft Punk. I saw in Steve's face that something happened and the same thing happened to me when I was a kid and listened to techno. When I heard this the first time I was so shocked. And he was like, "I don't know what happened, but I got a musical orgasm listening to this." I remember me and him coming into the same world from hip hop to techno and we met. Wow. What is it? -Do you smell it? -Yes. Did I shit my pants, man? -What is it? -Wow. I'm going to throw up. -Is it me that smells? -I don't know. -Is it my mouth? -No. What is with your hat? Is there something? -You crapped in your hat. -Is it that? -Yeah, I think so. -No, it's not that. -Wow, somebody ate dog shit? -Yeah. I think it's my mouth. -Did you eat dog shit? -Wow! What? What? What is it? It's here. It's the fucking food. In school, I discovered this music-making software. Nerds, much like myself, would get together and make a demo, which meant a programmer would program the most advanced possible stuff he could on the screen, like make a square spin and that would be like, "Oh, my, God!" Then you would have a guy making music to this. And this was a demo. Basically computer nerd music, demo music is amateur versions of techno and trance. And the better I got and the better computers got, the more it started to sound like the real thing. You can find it, it's really fast and actually sounding quite amateurish. I remember hearing the drums in that song. It was funky. It was groovy. Well, we met at a restaurant. He was just some kid who came in and just like, boys are coming in being like boys, hello, just. "Oh, my God, you are that guy. I just heard your song <i>StoneBridge 2. </i>It's amazing." I remember Ax was looking at me like, "What is this guy talking about?" He was like, "Whoa!" He was very flamboyant. I guess the Italian in him was very apparent. I'm like, "Do you have a studio in Stockholm? I'll come tomorrow." -He's a bit of a pushy guy. He's a bit weird, you know. -I'm coming there at three. But you have to bear in mind, I came from south of Sweden and it's very low key, you know, just very calm and Swedish, I guess. I grab some music, I take Steve with me and I go to the studio. When you met somebody that was into dance music, it's as if you let two dogs into a room, they smell each other's arses and run around in a circle. We were like, "Wow, you're also into dance music?" So we had to become best friends on the spot. Let's get into the mode. -Can you rewind a bit? -Oh, there it is. Always the same high hats. There it goes. Say <i>Greyhound</i>. -How are you? -I'm a mess. Come over here. You want water? I can't breathe. We're just three normal guys from the suburbs of Stockholm. Don't destroy the illusion. We're not normal. What are you talking about? One, two, three. <i>The artists are on stage.</i> Where the fuck are we? -I can't ski at all. -Me neither. I suck. It's incredible. <i>The more you think about it, the more you realise how big of a step dance music has taken.</i> <i>We couldn't go to Madison Square Garden ten years ago. They would say we're out of our heads.</i> <i>And suddenly we can play any stadium in the world.</i> 1, 2, 3. <i>"Partouze</i>". Blows your mind, opens your heart always, always. I love Russia. <i>-Who quits when they're at the top? -What do we do after this?</i> <i>It doesn't get bigger than this. So that would mean repeating ourselves.</i> <i>So we were, like, "The biggest change we could do right now is to stop."</i> Even though it's really early and it might not be the best decision ever made, it's still exciting. It's going to be very sad, obviously, but also, a little bit, "Oh, finally", in a weird way. You know, it is an end, but it's also a fucking amazing final. The first time I heard <i>Greyhound</i>, that breakdown, I just lost it. It was one of the best songs I heard in my life. -Do you know they open the show with <i>Greyhound</i>? -Yeah, I did know that. -What'll you do when you hear that? -I'll lose my marbles, scream my head off. Lose my mind as I usually do when I listen to music. All alert. Go! <i>The winner of the Grand Prix, Axwell!</i> Hey, honey, it's Daddy. Hey, honey, it's Daddy. <i>One chilly night, night, night My boat I steered</i> <i>On the wavy, wavy, wavy sea…</i> -Great crowd. -Yes. Really good crowd. Damn good crowd. Coming from 20,000 people, all going bananas, adrenaline pumping and us playing the drums to a silent, not so romantic hotel room. I shouldn't complain, but I get this kind of anxiety. I almost panic. I have to wind down. I thought about something. I wonder if we will ever be on that MTV show,<i> One Hit Wonders.</i> Whatever happened to…? You know, like Right Said Fred, they had one hit and then what happened? Do you remember this group, Swedish House Mafia? They had this one song,<i> Don't You Worry Child</i>. All three members now went off to do their own things, not as successful as the <i>Don't You Worry Child </i>single. And one of them went on to become a crack addict, also. And one of them bought a lot of houses that he later had to sell. And they tried to make a reunion tour after a few years, nobody came. So, on our number ten of One Hit Wonders, Swedish House Mafia. That could happen. Like I've said before, it feels like we have been given the key to the golden city and we are throwing it away. We could have kept going and gotten even bigger. It was very organic. It's more the fans forming Swedish House Mafia than us sitting down saying, "Shall we become Swedish House Mafia?" We were a bunch of guys just having a great time and loving music. We've loved every second of it. That was the feedback from the shows and comments afterwards. That was what people wrote about us: they are having an amazing time up there. Then it became a festival, then it became a residency somewhere. We started for fun, not knowing what we started, didn't think about what we started, we didn't plan anything. Are you ready for some Swedish House Mafia? We didn't see this as a long-lasting career even if we had a dream of, you know, the dream was that, but we were like, "Oh, my God, we're going abroad? This is a first." That's how we felt with everything. It'll be the first and the last gig, so we need to party our arses off. It was at the right moment in time at the right moment for this music at the right moment where we were with our music. We really hit the mother lode. It's just become this big machine, you know, monster. <i>This is the UK's official number one,</i> Don't You Worry Child. Today is a good day. -We partied for six years straight. -Constantly, five days a week. Then two days travelling. We didn't just consume alcohol. We did pretty much everything. I woke up after my birthday party a few years ago. There were beer bottles, liquor, all kinds of shit all over the place, people everywhere. -I woke up and was like… -It can't go on… This is enough. I threw everyone out except for my friends and said, "Those of you who want to quit this can join me, those of you who want to keep going, delete my number and never call me again. That's how it went down. And I've been good from that day on. It started with us just messing around with no responsibilities. The requirement was that we showed up, drank booze and partied. But since we've reached this level, people expect more from us to not make us look like fucking failures, I don't want that. I feel there is a difference in how much we put into this. Can you see the one in there? Damn, check out the lion! -Look at the lion over there. -Go inside there. OK, that's the sound I was afraid of. That's the sound I did not want to hear. They're going in there, check it out. -Wait, they are going in with the cheetahs? -What? -That's amazing. -Are they dangerous? I hope you guys are going to enjoy it. I hope there's no sissies amongst the lot of you. Yeah, I'm a sissy. I can tell you. I'm a sissy. Yeah. I admit. -Like there, like there. -Beautiful. -You can leave if you don't like it. -You can walk straight back out. -I'll be standing right there. -No, no, no, no…. You just stand and watch. -I don't want to. -Come on, if they try anything on, I'll kill them. I promise you. The best way to get used to you is allow it to lick your scent. -He's purring so he's OK. -Can I take my hand away? -No, you don't take the hand away. -Now? -Yeah, you can. -OK. -But it's not a problem. -No. OK. -You did it, though. -I didn't like it. -You didn't like it at all? -No. It's not my thing. Look. Do you remember about two years ago, when I said we should focus on Swedish House Mafia 100 per cent? I don't remember if we were on drugs or not. We should have focused on SHM and given up on our own stuff. -Yes, you said that. -Then nothing happened… If we had committed then we could have done this properly. We're playing for 2 x 27,000 people here. To be on the level they deserve, we should focus on this thing only. Get into the studio for months, say goodbye to our families or move them back to Sweden and we could be in the studio together. You mean commitment. -Just got here? -Yeah, we did. Guys, the question on a lot of people's mind, is this it, is it over? Is it maybe just a start of things, you guys take a break, do your own thing, maybe come back later on? What do you think? How about you take this one? I think we all feel the same way since we all agreed to this decision. It's just that we haven't talked about it. A couple of hours a week, everything is awesome. We get nostalgic about the music and we feel the magic. But then it's back to this emptiness. There is an elephant in the room… The times when we've tried to address it, it's been very difficult and nothing has come out of it. So instead, we have just swept it under the carpet. We have our opinions, but we don't talk about it. That's how it is. I mean, who likes arguments? It's really stuffy in here, I can't breathe. This tour should be called One Last Complaint. We're complaining all the time, even though everything is perfect. We're looking for things to complain about. It's messed up. I've never seen anything like it. -Open the window. -See, now you're complaining again. -I'm not, I just asked you to open the window. -It's true. We're just trying to find faults all the time. Just enjoy, man. <i>We all grew up, it becomes different, we don't hang out as much as we used to,</i> <i>you know, we live in different places. It's not the same anymore.</i> <i>We are three people that have had individual agendas</i> <i>all the time, living in different parts of the world.</i> <i>We've not been able to give Swedish House Mafia</i> <i>the type of commitment that it deserves.</i> <i>I guess it's for every friendship and long-distance relationships,</i> <i>you know, it's tight in the beginning and then it just fades out.</i> It's a sick view from up here, isn't it? OK, let's check. Billboard. Number one, Bruno Mars. -Yeah! Number seven. -What? -Top ten! -It's crazy. -That's fucking wild, man. -That's unbelievable. Why the decision to finish it with all this success with you? It's about, you know, us doing a world tour and putting our other projects on the side for a while and saying hello and goodbye to our fans. And, yeah, I mean, you can continue this, maybe. I think, yeah, we've had an amazing time and. It's like my father once said, if the cheetah approaches you, you have to push the cheetah down. And so that means that, you know, this became so big and we really, like Sebastian said, we wanted to finish it on the perfect level, you know, so just, "Down, cheetah". They must be like, "Shit, it's the president!" No, it's three DJs from Sweden." -I can't see shit. -Here. No, I'm gonna puke! I'm gonna puke, I'm gonna puke! What the fuck! Where is it? Someone is running around with it! <i>We went to Australia. We rented a big house on the water.</i> <i>We were, like, we'll try and do</i> Don't You Worry Child<i>.</i> -Damn, it's warm now. -Is it warm now? -Are you kidding? -Well, not that warm. -It's set to 33 degrees Celsius. -OK. They say there are sharks here and that you shouldn't go in the water. We won't then. I want to make music that sounds like this view. -You think we can make music that sounds like this? -Sure. What does this sound like? I think up a few notes. Maybe one more. One more up. There! I'm gonna do the beats now. -That's fucking tight, man. -Yeah, for sure. -See if any of these work. -I'll just try all of them. You mean. So it plays over here. I want this to come together with a baby angel that I want to have on my neck. He's not picking up? He can't pick up if he's getting tattooed right now. -How long does it take to get a tattoo? -It depends on how complex it is. This one took four hours because it's got several layers. What a retarded thing to do now when we've rented a house for half a billion to make music? You can get a tattoo in LA, right? Last time I checked. This is gonna hurt. Nobody cares anymore. It's just that I left my family, he left his family, Steve left his family to come to work and spend five days. Fuck that shit, man. I'm tired of it. Nothing's going to happen. We won't finish this record on this trip, we are not. We need to be in the room and be creative and have fun and when he comes he's going to be fucked, of course, it hurts, man. -I mean, it's just bad, man. -Yeah. Me and Ax are going to speak to Steve when we have time and if he doesn't really understand it, then we have a huge problem, I mean. -The lost member is back. -I didn't know it was gonna take that long. -That was the worst idea. -To get a tattoo? -I told you that three months ago by email. -But we're here working. -Yes, but still. -It sucks. It wasn't the best idea. Not your best. Whatever, let's just work now. <i>We felt that we've taken it somewhere in the right direction.</i> <i>But we didn't really get that far.</i> <i>And then we had to leave.</i> <i>At the same time, things were not really going so well with Swedish House Mafia.</i> We sit with the set tomorrow then? -I don't want to push it back, but it's tight now. -You're playing, so you have to go. I can skip it, our stuff is more important. Or we can do it tomorrow? You can count on me tomorrow, I swear. <i>There's a lot of stuff that everybody puts time and effort in</i> <i>that doesn't get credited for.</i> <i>If I go to loads of meetings about something, I'm not going to put that on the spreadsheets.</i> <i>Seb dropped out of many studio sessions for reasons</i> <i>but I have never accounted him for that and said, "You didn't show up."</i> <i>I don't care. We're in this together.</i> <i>You know what? We already had the best time with Swedish House Mafia,</i> <i>so why not just leave it there, because we know that we're not going to commit.</i> <i>We don't want to have some sort of group that's half-arsing it.</i> <i>I feel like nobody's pushing anything further.</i> <i>We don't want to mess up our friendship, because we're angry at each other for not working enough.</i> <i>And then actually I dropped what I'd been thinking for a bit:</i> <i>"How about we quit Swedish House Mafia?"</i> <i>It was after they left the stage they put a thing up on their website saying it was no more.</i> "Swedish House Mafia, forever in my heart." "Assholes, you don't care about your fans." "Something died in me, faggots!" "Swedish House Mafia break-up is death of house music." "You guys rewarding your fans in this matter, question mark." "Now I think my biggest hope and interest in life has died, damn, I'm really fucking sad." "Why, why, why. No, no, no. Please, don't do it." <i>The call I got which was like, "We're going to break up, fuck this shit. It's evil."</i> <i>It got so big, so fast.</i> <i>It's only real if you all mean it. And you all really love each other.</i> <i>But the energy is no longer pure.</i> <i>And so </i>One Last Tour<i> was born.</i> <i>The success of Swedish House Mafia is something no one can deny,</i> <i>you've released hit tracks, played sold-out arenas across the globe.</i> <i>Aren't you afraid of the future without SHM?</i> <i>Not really. I mean we're here now and enjoying the moment right now</i> <i>and I'm just looking forward to what's going to happen next.</i> <i>There's no sort of big scheme or plan.</i> <i>We've always done what we do and released our stuff</i> <i>and played big events individually.</i> <i>We just see this as an end of an amazing journey that we've done together as friends</i> <i>and, you know, it just feels right.</i> <i>We all saw an end to the limbo.</i> <i>We were like, "We need to do this."</i> <i>And we got really excited about ending the band.</i> And that then led to us announcing Milton Keynes Bowl as our last show in the UK. We said in an interview, "We are premiering our last single there." So that kind of set a time schedule to finish that fucker, because if we told 60,000 people they're going to hear <i>Don't You Worry Child</i> at our show, we better fucking finish it. Great to meet you guys. You played some massive shows. What makes this one so special? It's our last Swedish House Mafia show in the UK. Can you confirm that your next single is going to be <i>Don't You Worry Child</i>? Yes. <i>So for the last time ever in the UK, Milton Keynes, make some noise.</i> <i>The Swedish House Mafia!</i> Don't You Worry Child<i> received a Grammy nomination.</i> <i>You are officially number one in the UK.</i> <i>-iTunes number one in 42 countries. -Swedish House Mafia's first ever UK number one.</i> We want everybody to sit down. Every single person out here, please sit down. When the track kicks in, we want you all to jump up. Are you ready? Don't you worry. -It's nice and warm here, huh? -Yes. -Oh, am I in Hawaii? Is this Hawaii? -This is Malaysia. -Malaysia. -You have this thing here also? -Nice. Maybe you should sing a song also. -What up? I'm OK, I'm OK, thank you. -You need to take one. -No. -Come on, it's impolite. -Just put it on. -Why is that? -It's impolite. -Who says that? -It's their culture. I don't give a shit. -You know this is a theme park? -Oh, yeah? It's so weird this whole thing. I can't see myself DJing when I'm 40. I'll still be involved, but I don't think I'll be touring. And you can't know how long this scene will last… Time will tell. Everything comes to an end. I cried myself to sleep last night. -Really? -I´m going through some rough times… That's life sometimes, I guess. You have to clean out all the shit. -That's too bad. -Otherwise it gets to you later, you'll see. I've come to a point in my life where I want to clear things up. Why can't we sit down and talk about this like adults? What the hell are we doing? We're behaving like teens! This is not gonna fly. It's not working. It really isn't. I focus 100 per cent on Swedish House Mafia. If you don't feel that everyone is on the same page, it gets really boring. Come on, just spit it out! If you've got something to say, say it. What's the fucking problem? If you don't deal with problems straight away, leave it! It wears you down, you know. But do we want to start a war now? 'Cause it will be a war. We need to relax, OK? So fucking stupid! -I think Steve took off. -Where to? I don't know. Curly just showed him to a car. You know, it is what it is, man. You know, it's like, it's over, you know. A lot of things happened this year and made me realise that, you know, we're not best friends anymore. And that's the truth. Normally, we say, "Well, we've taken it as far as we want", and so and so and so, which is also true but maybe we are not meant to be. It's coming. Come here, shark! The winds have spoken. She's grown. -Look. -You want a flower? Hey, honey. You can never go away again. -What's up? -Daddy. -Daddy, I love you. -I love you too. I've missed you. -And a kiss too. How are you? -Fine. Look, I'm going to swim. <i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi.</i> <i>The outside temperature is 27 degrees Celsius.</i> -Thank you so much. -Have a nice day. -Nikhil, when was the first time I came to India? -2007. It was so different and the energy was so amazing that I was just like, "Wow, this is something else. I have to come here more often." The scene that we have in India today with millions of fans of dance music. This guy's fault. He started it. An old friend of mine. I think Axwell's going to be surprised by the number of fans he has in India now compared to what was going on in 2007. I would like to go crazy and hear the music like. There're so many fucking people here to see them right now. I've got a special, you know, connect with them so when I see them play I get a special feeling which I don't get when I see other DJs play. My name is Axwell. This is Sebastian Ingrosso and Steve Angello, and we are the Swedish House Mafia. What happened tonight? Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, and Steve Angello, killed the fuck out of this place. Tonight was madness. I can't even speak. We've been waiting for this for so long. You have no idea. I think we're going to say that it's probably the change of house movement in India, you know. Let's say it's come of age. Seeing about like 15,000-20,000 people, you know, EDM has come of age in India. Let's put it that way. I want to smoke so bad seeing you do that. You look like Burt Reynolds. I could give you a blowjob. You'll just feel bad if you smoke. Don't do it. Relax and pass me that thing. It's just a damn cigarette. -I just want your best, bro. -I know, bro. Hey, Michelle, it's Amy. I really have got to be quick. I'm in the middle of literally running a festival, so when can we do this call and how long will it be? I'm basically the chairwomen of Swedish House Mafia. They are kind of like my second family, I suppose. I rang Steve Angello, "Can I book you? Can I do some stuff with you?" He was like, "Sure." I also called Axwell. Steve introduced me to Sebastian. I just remember that they had swagger, especially Steve, especially Steve. I think they knew they could have swagger because they knew their music was so fucking good. They knew, you know, they knew what they were hearing. They knew what they were making. And they were kind of like, "Yeah, listen to that." -And you are? -Steve Angello. OK, good. -Comments? -Phat. Axwell, what do you have to say? In the beginning, there was house. In the end, there was house. And in the middle there is Axwell. I think some of us made some mistakes and the fact that we haven't been able to sit down and say sorry to each other is a tragedy. But I also think that even if we said sorry, I don't think it would fix it. And I think that we all want to be happy more than we want to be in Swedish House Mafia. We're pleased to have with us today the members of Swedish House Mafia: Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso to help us light the Empire State Building. Hello, New York, this is actually the first time we visit the Empire State Building. And what an awesome way to visit it in, you know, having it lit up in the Swedish colours. It's coming to an end very soon. The circle is about to be completed. It's starting to feel very emotional. At the start of the tour, it never felt like the end. The end was so far away. I wasn't thinking that it would all be over so soon. -Do you regret it? -Sometimes. Sometimes. Look, here comes Sebastian Ingrosso. And look now, I'm Swedish House Mafia. -Can we have a picture before you go on? -With your badass outfit. -Yeah! -You need to chill out in a big way. -I'm saying it's good. -He said it's my best outfit ever if I added oil. I mean, I'm just saying, that's not right. -Alex, who am I? -Sebastian. -And now? -Swedish House Mafia. We needed Ax to be the guy that always was there. And I myself, pretty bad in the beginning, partying and, like, taking maybe Ax or Steve for granted a little bit. I can be with these fucking people here at this after-party, they will fix that. And then four years later I woke up and was like, "What have I done?" But, you know, this year and the year before, I've been working my arse off to prove to both Ax and Steve that I wanted to give something back to them for how many years they have been there and got my back. What's up? You want to party? What's up? She's like, "I'm Paris Hilton", and I'm, "I don't give a fuck." I just want a hug. I'm just so hyped. Wow, I'm going to fuck this nightclub into pussy. You've got swag. Never seen so much people smile. Kind of like. Who can say that they have been playing drums at Madison Square Garden? I can. Steve! Ax! I took off my earplugs. I took a vodka shot, because it was so great. -Oh, you took a vodka shot? -Yeah, like this big. I needed to. If it continues like this, by the end of the tour we'll be back to doing coke, just getting hammered all the time. Yeah, I think so, too. We're going to, like, the last show. Back to the start again. -Why not? -Why the fuck not? <i>So just tell us why you chose Miami to end the Swedish House Mafia?</i> <i>We always come back to Miami every year for the conference</i> <i>and it kind of felt natural to</i> spread the ashes here so we can come and visit from time to time. <i>-You say hi to the boys.</i> -I will. <i>The best of luck and thanks so much for everything that you've done for everybody</i> <i>-and then the good times you've given everybody.</i> -Thank you, man. Thank you. This is something we were doing on our own before. And we will keep doing it on our own after this. It's actually not that strange. We're all different, you know. It's hard to. Anyway it's over now. This was the last. I feel that you have a lot of things between you three that is unsaid. Yeah, it's probably never going to be said either, maybe in the future. Well, you never know. Then we will be older and, hopefully, we'll meet each other in Ibiza or have a glass of wine or whatever and talk about it or not. At the start say: "I'm. This is Steve, this is Sebastian, we are still the Swedish House Mafia." Or I can say: "We are the Swedish House Mafia for one last time." -No, I think it's better to say. -It's much better. More massive. When you said it last time, I was like. I felt like I was in the crowd and wanted to fuck everyone. OK, fine then. Yes, it's like. -Damn, are we up soon? -Yes. -Are you sure? -Very shortly. We should go up there and get into the vibe, play some drums. -Need to get into the rhythm. -Damn, I'm stressed out now. Miami. I'll always be their friend, obviously. But it's just not the same work-wise anymore. We had an amazing thing and it's always sad to see things go that you loved. But look at us now, we've endured. We have this thing to look back on and I think that's something that I would like to treasure. Gracefully, we will have a friendship, we will have a graceful friendship. It's sad, you know, when you think about it but it's also very beautiful because we made something together and we were best friends. And we took this journey together so it's not this little thing just in the end of not committing to things that breaks this up. It's just we want to leave it, we don't want to end our friendship in a super bad way, it could be worse, it could be flying chairs in the fucking faces and hitting each other with knives. But that's what we don't want, you know. Let us hear you singing, Miami. You can do louder! I think I speak for all of us when I say thank you for this great journey that you've given us, all the places we've been and all the love we got. -Words can't describe how I feel right now. I'm so sad. -I'm like happy but sad. At the same time. Madison Square Garden, Barclays, Barclays, I only go to my brothers that many times, you understand? Vibes are strong, energy. -I'm never getting over that ever, OK. -Best night of my life. -It's sad to see them leave. -They're going to be fine. You mean individually, yeah, but it would be nice to see them together. Maybe they'll come back from there. They should stay together. Because everyone loves them and they're just a great group of people. They were the best thing happened in my entire life. The best thing. Human beings can't take emotion out of me, but Swedish House Mafia apparently can. I can die happy. I can die happy. We are still the Swedish House Mafia. Miami, thank you so much. You know that we came, you know that we raved, and that we love you! What I wanna buy is some celery. Ah, you got the tomatoes? Yeah, I got the tomatoes. How many do you want? They're two for a dollar. Ah good, two for a dollar I'll take four tomatoes. Gonna try to take one onion. One onion, you get two for a dollar. Alright, I'll take two. - How much is all that? - Four dollars. Four dollars. That's not very expensive, is it? No, not really. - You can have that, that's fine. - Alright, thanks. Alright guys, thank you very much. - Y'all come back now. - I will now. Happy Thanksgiving. You all have a good time. Alright mate, see ya! I thought it'd be nice to find somewhere off the freeway, amongst nature, a beautiful spot here in Arkansas and. juice up my Thanksgiving lunch, which has no turkey in it by the way. I think in a funny way I'm thankful that I got sick because if I didn't get sick, that was my body telling me to slow down and get well. Who knows, if I hadn't had got sick, I might not have ever slowed down and I might have already had a heart attack and died, so. We'll never know. I'm thankful for that. Quay. My name's Joe Cross, and I'm an Australian, in case you couldn't work that out from the accent. I've just arrived in the United States. I'm not gonna eat any of your food. I've come here to fast for 60 days. All I'm gonna do is drink juice, green juice. 60 days. 60 nights. Why am I doing this? Well, let me show you. Take a good hard look at my gut. How many pizzas, burgers, fries, and cokes do you reckon I inhaled to create that masterpiece? I'm certainly no picture of health. I look like I've swallowed a sheep. Not only am I overweight, I'm also sick. For the past nine years, I've been taking pills, night and day, just to get by. But as of today, I'm saying enough is enough. I know what you're thinking. "Can't you just eat the fruit and vegetables? Why juice?" Well, have a look at just how many vegetables it takes to make one juice. I don't care how hungry I am, I don't think I could eat this four times a day. So, by juicing, I'm super-charging my nutrient intake. That's a lot, isn't it? I've tried this before but never for this long. In the past, I've always gone back to my old ways. This time, once I'm done, I'm determined to adopt a healthy lifestyle. But first, I have to get through the next 60 days. So, I have a plan. For the next 30, I'm gonna hang in and around New York, and after that, I'm gonna drive across the country. What I'm doing is a documentary on health. - About what? - Health. - Health? - You know, what we eat. I'm actually going across America, on a tour around the States. I've got a thing called Chronic Urticaria, which is like a chronic rash. - You got a what? - An illness, like a disease. I put myself there by having a lot of junk food, eating a lot of crap, not eating vegetables, not eating fruits. I believe what we put into our body is very important as to how healthy we're gonna be. I'm on a juice fast. You ever heard of fasting? Fasuma.. Water. and vegetable juice. 60 days of juice and about six to eight months of eating just vegetables, fruits, nuts and beans. That's crazy. - I don't think I'd survive. - I reckon you would. - That is unbelievable. - I know, tell me about it. You wanna know what else is unbelievable? Is just how many doctors I went to when I first got sick. In fact, I went to six of them. I had skin biopsies and tests to see if I reacted to certain things. I took a bunch of different pills. I even spent 14 days in hospital. When none of that worked, I started exploring alternative paths: Massage. Acupuncture. Chinese herbalists. Mud baths. Cell and hair analysis. Even witchdoctors The list was endless. And then I thought, hang on! When I scraped my knee as a kid, I didn't have to do anything as long as I got out of the way, it just got better. If the body can heal itself on the outside, why can't it heal itself on the inside? So what have I been doing wrong? Well for starters, I had my priorities out of whack. I'd been focusing on my wealth, rather than my health. And look where that got me! And this is only the beginning. Now I'm on a mission to cure myself, which means. no more pills. Well, it's the morning of Day One. Time to visit Dr. Joel Fuhrman, a leading expert in nutrition. You don't have a common condition, but it's related to an autoimmune phenomenon. I've seen patients with this condition do pretty well and even get rid of it. Alright Joe, step on the scale. The moment of truth. - Check it out. - Here we go. Dr. Fuhrman agreed to supervise my fast, as long as I got a blood test every ten days. Permanent results only come from permanent changes in lifestyle and diet style. You don't get permanently well unless you permanently change the way you live. Let's see what your waist is. The tape's long enough? The fasting period itself can be used as a time where you're gonna retrain your taste buds. So if it's something that really helps motivate you to stay with healthy eating thereafter, then it’s done its job. Hello? G'day Mum, - Hi Joe, - it's the morning of Day Two. Oh dean only Day Two, I've been very concerned about you doing this. It's just beyond me that anybody can do this for 60 days. The first few days are the toughest. Not eating, it's kind of like you're cutting yourself off from society. When you're not eating food, it just doesn't seem normal. I couldn't even watch TV because of all the commercials. You don't want to be around people, and you don't want to be around food. I was happiest in bed. I didn't wanna get out of bed. I just wanted to lie there and feel sorry for myself. Day Three was today. I had a pretty bad night last night. I felt very, very, very much alone, last night in the sense that. it's like you've got this mammoth task ahead of you and without food, you're really starting to hurt, and you're feeling it. You wanna go to sleep and wake up in two months and it's all done. As the saying goes, "You do the crime, you do the time," and there's no question, I've done the crime. I mean, you know, I really have. I really have. not been kind to my body. You know it's. it's a tough thing, the emotional attachment to food, its bloody tough. These are the pills I have to take. This is a 5 mg tablet of prednisone. That's 15 mgs there. Before I started on the fast, that's how many I was having a day. Looking at these. at these. bottles here, it doesn't look good. If you're a fit, healthy, young person, you shouldn't be traveling around with prescription drugs and doing that, I mean it's. You wouldn't have thought, I would never have thought that it'd be me, that I would. have to do this. I was in California in 1999 and I played golf and I thought maybe I touched some poison ivy, and that night I went to bed. I went to wake up the next morning and it was up my forearms and Shins and very itchy and scratching. It's like hives. It's chronic hives. It spread all over my body, torso, and geez, I was lit up like a Christmas tree. This is how my autoimmune disease works: When you get bit by a mosquito, receptors under your skin send a signal to your brain. HQ, we got an invader in Sector 3. Scramble the histamines. Roger that. Histamines are being deployed. Histamine makes the blood vessels around the bite swell, making it more difficult for the poisons in the mosquitoes' saliva to spread through the body. As a side effect, the whole area is swollen, red and itchy, but with my disease, the receptors send the wrong messages. A handshake is like getting bit by a thousand mosquitoes. Mayday! Mayday! All hell's breakin' loose down here! All histamines, report to battle stations! And this can happen at anytime to any part of my body. Just the smell, just the smell is sensational. Normally I'd eat two of those, not two slices, two whole pizzas. I better get out of here. So I've been coming to the US. off and on for the last 35 years. I even lived here when I was a kid. It's like a second home to me. I reckon Americans are super friendly. Maybe that's because I'm not from around here. I also love American food, and if I'm gonna really change the way I live my life, I'm the sort of bloke that likes to tackle my demons head on. So, I couldn't think of a better place to be food free, than here in the US., the home of the hamburger. - Have you ever heard of fasting? - Yeah. Have you ever fasted? Only when I ain't got no money to eat, man! It's the only time I fast. I think I sent off for it, it's ten bucks or something, "How to Lose 12 pounds in Four Days." It consisted of. First day you eat nothing but nine franks. You drink all the liquid, or diet soda, but nine hot dogs. - You have nine hot dogs. - First day. - I would never be able to do that. - I would never fast. - Why not? - I don't have enough self-control. And you? I don't like not eating. It doesn't seem healthy to me. Second day, you have a fruit, apple or a pear, but you have to have nine apples. I went four years one time eatin' only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Third day, you had eggs. Like a boiled egg. You could have ten, nine boiled eggs. I don't fast, I eat. I eat fast, but you know, I don't fast. You eat fast. The fourth day, you could have a mixture of all three of those. OK. And that was the Four Day Diet. - Did you lose any weight? - I lost about 12 pounds. I have no interest in it. Every time I hear that they're sick at the end, they're grumpy. They hate their kids, they hate their husbands, you know, they're pissed off. Then they reach some high, then they lose eight pounds, then they gain it all back in three weeks. Yeah, right. - Are y'all from Australia? - I am from Australia. - Yeah, I can tell. - Why? You been there? You got the Russell Crowe thing happening. - Have I? The accent? - Yeah, the accent. Yeah, I'm not as good of an actor as him. I hear you. Right from the beginning he loved his food. He'd have a bottle, but when it was finished, he'd drink it so quickly, then he would just throw it the other side of the room. And demand another one. He was known for somebody who loved Coca-Cola. Like his father. Love it! When I got out of high school, I was in good shape. I skipped college, went straight to work. I got a job with a brokerage firm and wound up on the trading floor of the Sydney Futures Exchange. After five years, I went into business for myself. And at age 23, I was making a truckload of money day-trading futures and shares. Lots of cash meant fast cars, big boats, big nights out, and in my case, food, lots of food. And boy, didn't I give it a nudge. In the years I've known him, his weight fluctuated, big time! Went up and down like a bride's nighty. Cold, depression, headache, hangover, varicose vein, menstrual, stress, I would like you to make me your favorite juice. - My favorite juice? - Yeah! The cleansing cocktail? The cleansing cocktail, that sounds good. - Carrot, apple, beet and ginger. - Sounds good. Step right over here, hes gonna fix it for you. - Beautiful. Thank you very much. - Thank you, no problem. So juice fasting, you're still eating something, you're drinking nutrients. Particularly a lot of micronutrients that are coming from fruits and vegetables. And because it's a liquid, it's more rapidly absorbed. So it's a quick, easy way of giving your body a very potent source of healthy nutrients. Now try to think about the way we normally consider juice in our country, which is in a bottle, in a grocery store. Whether it says it has sugar added to it or not, it has been so processed that it's not at all like the fruit and vegetable juice coming out of a juicer that you're making at home. How about a small apple juice please? Thank you. Like it doesn't seem logical not to eat food. I mean where did three meals a day come from? I mean who decided we eat three meals a day? Why isn't it six or seven? Or. two? I don't understand that. Spinach and beans. It's gonna be. a big part of my future. I actually love spinach. When you're eating three meals a day and you're 41, that sort of equates to 41,000 meals. Now we go on holidays, we sleep at night, we give our car a service, but we don't think about giving our bodies a rest. • Part of being on this journey is I've resigned myself that I'm not gonna eat so. Once you do that, surprising how easy it is, like. There’s nothing gonna break me here. I'm not gonna have a panic attack and run out and buy a donut. Alright. OK. All the energy I need to digest, to get through my day, here it is here, look. It's sitting here. So, I've gotta think about it that, you know, the falafels that I had say two months ago. They're still sittin' there, and, I gotta think mentally that I'm actually having them now. So the idea of fasting is not unique. In fact, fasting is part of who we are as a human being. You see, for millions of years we basically lived by the philosophy of hunter-gatherer. But to survive when there wasn't anything to hunt or gather, we became like human refrigerators, capable of storing food and carrying it with us for lean times. So early man had a tremendous amount of activity just to survive. In our current modern world, we don't necessarily have to expend much energy and the reality is that many people don't. We have very sedentary jobs. We're not chasing animals. We're not running away from animals. We are riding to work, sitting at our desk, and sitting in front of the TV. Yet we're consuming far, far more calories, particularly from processed, refined foods, convenience foods. Actually 61% of the American diet today is processed foods. We're talking about oils, sugar, flour, predominantly. And the processing, which usually involves cooking and heating, also damages the food. In other words, processed foods don't even have probably 1/10 the original nutrients that were in the food in the native state. Day 31 today. Half way. Time for a change of scenery. Actually this really ain't too bad. - Not bad is it? - No, no. So what do you think? I'll have one with you. That's OK. What do you think? No, you don't like it? It tastes like grass. Tastes like grass? Really? If it tastes like grass, I think a lot of people will drink it. No, no, no! What do you think? Not bad at all. What if I told you, that I've only been juicing, in other words, I've been drinking this only for 39 days; what would you say to that? I'd say you're crazy as hell. And is there any secret you'd like to tell young people about what's the secret to living along and happy life? Yeah, just be good and kind and be obliged to everyone. That's the answer? What about eating the right food? Certainly has a lot to do with it. If you don't wanna be constipated, eat the right food. Ain't that the truth! The closer a food is to its natural state the healthier it is. So, it's like, why are fruits and vegetables good for me? Micronutrients are essentially your vitamins and minerals. Where do we get these micronutrients? They are predominantly found in plant foods. All plant foods are beneficial and essential for human health. Everything from building muscle to immune function, preventing a cold, staying healthy. I found out that food can be divided into two camps: Micronutrient and macronutrient. Micronutrient foods are vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds and beans. Macronutrient food is everything else. So what sort of food do you eat? I eat almost anything. Pizza, chicken, pork chops, potatoes. You have KFC on one corner. You guys are looking for a hot dog stand? Yeah. And then on that side of the street, there's a Burger King. Do you like Burger King? A lot. It's five past, ten past eleven in the morning. Why are we looking for a hot dog stand? Is this our breakfast, or is this our snack between? This is snack between breakfast and lunch. I'm a meat and potatoes guy. My portions. I don't eat the best, you know. If I do have vegetables or fruits, it's in moderation. I eat no fruit and I eat no vegetables. - What was in there? - Pepsi. - What else do you eat? - Mexican. That's all? Only Mexican and Pepsi. Nothing else? I drink Coke. Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables? No. If I told you that eating fruits and vegetables really would keep you healthy. Would that change your outlook on them? Probably not. - OK and why's that? - 'Cause I'm 16. And your diet? How's that? I eat a lot. - What do you eat? - Pie, cake, hamburgers. And how many pounds are you now? About 370, 380. - That's pretty big. - I know. Doesn't a doctor say you gotta watch what you eat? But you don't bother with that, you just eat anyway. I can't, I don't have any willpower. I'm weak. Whose fault do you reckon it is that you're 330 lbs? Me, I don't blame nobody else but me 'cause nobody controls what I eat. Nobody tells me what to eat. It's my fault. Them folks didn't put no gun on me to make me eat their food. In terms of that poor diet, whose fault was that? Me, me, me. It's my fault for it, but look, - I'm hooked on it. - Yeah. Once you start eating all this fast food stuff, you begin to like it, man. I'm just being honest, you begin to like it. You'd much rather go get your quick combo, now wouldn't you? Is your life been mostly vegetables and fruits or have you also eaten fast food? KFC, McDonald's, Wendy's, - Chuck E. Cheese - Chuck E. Cheese Now how's your health overall? Do you feel healthy? No, I feel like I need to lose some weight. How much weight do you want to lose? - About at least 50 pounds. - Ok. How did you put that 50 pounds on? By doing what? Just sittin' around eatin'. I love doing that. - Do you watch TV when you eat? - Yes. When you watch TV do you feel like eating food as well? Yeah. You get to a point where you really wanna eat what they cooking, and when you eat it, eat it, eat it, like you're bingin' on eatin'. For most Americans, they desire more calories than they require and they gain weight. But they're forced to overeat, it makes them into a food addict and they don't feel well if they don't constantly put food in their mouth. When you fill up your stomach with unprocessed plant foods, it takes up a lot of volume. It satiates you, your body gets full of nutrients and it stops you from craving excess calories. The modern world is eating both too much processed foods and too many animal products. We're suffering 'cause we're not eating enough natural produce. Your typical American plate is half meat, a quarter overcooked vegetable or some kind of a white potato. And the other quarter is gonna be another white, refined carbohydrate. Morning. Cowboy Café. What are you eating there, mate? I'm having a chicken fried with mashed potatoes. Chicken fried what? Chicken fried steak, Right on, and mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes, corn and Texas toast. What are you eating? Liver and onions. Sid, you've gone with the chicken salad, have ya? That looks good actually. - It's not too bad. - And you eat salad a lot? A fair amount. How do you feel overall, generally with your health? I feel fine, but I've had heart surgery so. And did that change the way you ate back then? No. Not at all. And why is that? It really doesn't change the way I eat today. Really? I'm here for a few good years. I'm gonna eat what I want, and if I die at 55, great. If I live to be 65, great. If you ate foods that were fruits and vegetables and nuts and beans, that sort of stuff, and you made that 90% percent of your diet, and say two meals a week, you can have a meat, a burger, a pizza, whatever, just two meals, you could do that, and that would significantly prolong your life. Would I do it? Probably not. Alright, that's good, that's honest. - I'm just. - No, I appreciate it. And what about you, Ken? What do you think about it? It bothers me because I know for a fact that it affects my life expectancy and my health. But it's just hard to. be. so controlling of it. - So let me ask you a question. - Sure. - Say this works. - Yeah. Say it adds. five years to your life, maybe ten. What are you gonna do with it? - Have you got kids? - Six. OK, I kind of think that seeing your children grow up and being able to pass on your knowledge, just be around for them, and there as a support. Well I actually have Type-2 diabetes. What was your reaction when you were told? If there was any kind of denial, it wasn't so much that I had diabetes. The denial has been that I have to do something about it. That's what I denied. I actually haven't had food for six weeks, but I feel better as a person, and you know, in terms of satisfied, then if I'd just eaten that meal right now. Well, you seem energetic. Oh, yeah, I feel great. You've done the juices for 40. 42 days. 42 days, and so you don't look worse for the wear, I guess. You wanna see a photo of me at the beginning? Sure. There's a good one of me. - Actually that looks a lot like me. - Yeah, there you go. I don't know if you've seen me lately in the buff, but. that's about what I look like. Can you see that it's me? Yeah, you sure don't look as happy, I'll tell you that. Here's what I believe. I'm not a doctor, but I reckon that you can get your body back into shape so that you can cure yourself. And you'll be able to hang around and annoy Sid a bit longer in life too. I know I'd feel a lot better if I weighed that amount. Sid, nice to meet ya. It's amazing that, just sitting in the car now like with my jeans tight, you know, and not having to undo the button, to sit down, I mean, it's just little things. I can even feel the pelvis hipbone, like here. It's like, I haven't felt that for 10 years. It's like a whole new reintroduction. I've got to reintroduce myself to my body. That's the kind of momentum that kicks you on, and makes you feel. Makes you fell good about what you're doing. What do you think you need to do to live longer in life? Probably change my diet. - Oh you think so? - Yeah, I know so. So when do you think you need to change your diet? I don't know. One day I'll wake up and it's like time to diet. Right now, the doctor said, if I don't lose my weight, I'll probably have a heart attack and die. Right, when did he say, by when? About in five years. That's why I'm trying to stay alive 'cause I got grandkids Do you mind me asking how old you are? I'm 42. How old are you, if you don't mind me asking. I am 39. What do you think your life expectancy is, if you continue going down the way you're going? What do you give yourself? I give myself 55 maybe. I'm guessing like 50, 55. I'd say about the early 40s. Early 40s? So, how does that make you feel? Makes me feel bad, because I know I need to eat right. I know I need to. I don't know but I hope God got ribs in heaven. Right now, how old do I want to live to? Let's see. Probably about 90. - 90? - Yeah So what do you think you gotta do to live till 90? Try not to get killed. How you doing, mate? You know about fasting? Do I look like I know a lot about fasting? No but you look like you know a lot about eating though? I know a lot about eating, but I don't know a lot about fasting. Do you keep a gun under there, just in case? Absolutely. Can I have a look? Is it alright to come in and look. Well, it's loaded and the hammer's back. Oh yeah, gotcha, gotcha. So, if I wanted to carry a concealed weapon on me now, what gun would you recommend I buy? If I'm not real good on guns. Geez, you recommend that? That looks like a girl's gun. That looks like a girl's gun! Is that real? If you're not good on 'em, you won't do much damage with that, will ya? That's not real is it? Yeah, that’s a real .22. So if I break into your house tonight and steal the TV set. You won't be filming tomorrow. What do you think is the biggest threat to national security in the United States of America? Borders. - Border control, you reckon? - Border control. What if there was something that was right now in this country that was killing 70 million people? There's things in this country killing 70 million people. Cigarettes probably. - Yeah? - We both quit smoking. OK, so what about fast food? Yeah. we're fast food people. What sort of fast food do you like? Well, since we retired, I don't think we've cooked dinner at home more than two or three times in a. a month. So you would cook dinner at home twice a month? Maybe. The rest of the time we eat out. How many pounds are you now, total? About 320. But you know, my brother's a doctor. I've watched him struggle with being a vegetarian his whole life and now he's dying of that cancer. And I think it's a choice people make. I decided, that if I'm going, I'm going happy. I'm a happy, you know, I'm a happy fat guy. I think I'll play Santa Claus in the upcoming auction that we're having. My philosophy, if it's your time, the good Lord's gonna take you, whether you're fat, thin or whatever. Yeah, right. I've been following Dr. Fuhrman's orders and getting regular blood tests. Time to check in and get the results of the last one. Your cholesterol dropped from 204 to 135, your LDL cholesterol went from 132 to 86. They’re all good numbers? Yeah, very good numbers. Electrolytes were all good? Yeah, everything was perfectly normal. Everything was absolutely perfect. The point here is we have an unprecedented opportunity in human history, to be healthier and live longer than ever before. We simply don't have to be demented when we get older. We don't have to have a heart attack. We don't have to get strokes and we can dramatically reduce the risk of cancer. The one thing I'm finding remarkable about people is they say, Oh, I couldn't do that,” without even giving it a try. I just don't understand that. Hey, if you want to do a 10-day juice fast, and you only get to Day 7, well good on ya for trying! Not, oh, you're a failure. Good on you for trying. If you do give it a go, be warned. Your mates will probably think you're crazy. 60 days, didn't he? I spoke to him, he was struggling a couple weeks ago. He was. thinking about breaking then. 60 days is seriously extreme, just drinking juice. Extreme? Yes. Extreme? Yes. But let's not forget I've had a debilitating disease for the last nine years where I've had to take prednisone, a powerful steroid with a bunch of side effects. I'm 41, I'm fat and I'm sick. You don't need to be Einstein to figure out what's next. Even though I met a bunch of people who felt they were heading in the same direction I was, I also met lots of people who thought they weren't. How would a more conventional 10-day juice fast affect them '? Siong from Iowa volunteered to find out. Unlike me, she was married, and she had to cook dinner for her family. When I met her in New York, she explained to me that she suffered from migraines, and she was interested to see if this could help. I don't know which way goes which. I think this thing is so fun! I get migraine headaches if I smell certain things, or if I eat certain things. And I mean literally a migraine headache that can make me sick, can't see, can't hear, throwing up, the whole bit. Down the hatch, guys. Oh God, that's nasty! Shes a bit of a coffee drinker, So. She'll know where she is right now. She'll be having the withdrawals and. that'll be tough. Hi Joe. Hey Siong, how are ya? Rm fine, now are you doing? I'm going very well, thank you very much. And how are you feeling? Today I'm very tired, I feel like I'm in a fog, I just. I'm OK. Trust me, its gonna get better. You want fried potatoes or baked potatoes? I don't care. Fried's good. Now when this starts smelling good, I may have to leave the room. It's growing on me. Well I got something funny to tell you. The first day I drank this juice, within about 30 minutes I was in the bathroom. And. I mean I was totally cleaned out, so I thought. Well then, when I had the first glass again yesterday, I was in the bathroom again for quite a period of time. And I was like, whoa, where did all this come from 7 Oh my gosh. I'm starving, or so I think I am. Who said this was gonna be fun? My daughter. She lied to me. She was sadly mistaken, something like that, anyway. I've meditated, I've stretched, I've chanted, I've prayed, and I still wanna slap somebody. Nancy's been my friend for 20 years or longer it seems like. Nancy is a very health conscious person. She works out, she eats right. So she's gonna be my champion. - You wanna go down that way? - Sure. You know what? We can even eat this, this is so good. I'm starving. Hamburger Helper, oh yeah. Oh, coffee! Move, girl! You can't have any of that either. That smells good! The coffees been the hardest part. We could have one bean. of trying to give up. You wanna smell it? Come here. And every time I pass Starbucks, or every time I passed the Coffee Pot, it's like, I'd start to reach for it. Oh, there's donuts and éclairs! Get out of there! Were leaving. Mornings are the best. Evenings. Last night when the crew went out to dinner and they all went to Mexican, it's one of my favorites. They got no respect for me, of course. Going out and having Mexican, I’m at home with a kale juice. He'd say, "Things are going well, Mum", and he'd say it's difficult sometimes when the crew are in the restaurants eating and he'd be sitting in the car and I'd feel for him. And then I'd get off the phone and then I'd go to eat something and I'd find that very difficult because. I'd think, oh my God, he's sitting in that car, having some juice and I'm just about to get into a beautiful meal. Got my juice. One thing I'm just totally stunned by is just how much energy I have by just drinking juice. Now I know I can't do this forever, so I'm hoping that this fast will be enough to reboot my system. And believe it or not, I'm actually looking forward to eating more fruits and vegetables. How are ya mate, my name's Joe. Phil Staples. How much driving do you have to do? How many miles a year would you do? Anywhere close to 150,000. 150,000? I’m actually just doing my own little research, trying to get myself well. I've got a medical condition, I'm trying to cure. I'm this big because of steroids and driving. For what, what's the issue? It's called Urticarius Vasculitis Yeah Urticaria. That's what I've got. Your immune system's overactive? - Yeah, yeah. - Same here. That's extraordinary, mate, cause you're about the only, first people in the world that I've ever met, that's got the same thing that I've got. What's the worst thing about it, for you? What do you find? The swelling, the blisters, and the pain. Is it hard to find good food on the road? Oh yeah. It's mostly either fried, and these places, like pizza, hamburgers, pre-made hamburgers. Fasting, I've found, fasting works for me, so maybe it'll work for you. And I'm betting my life on it. And now I really am betting my life, that, this is the way to go. I'm willing to bet my life, too. Let's walk over here and we'll go and get a juice I've got my battery hooked up, and I've got my juicer. Alright. And out it comes over here on the other side. Come on. You can have a go. You gotta push it down, right? - That's not too hard, is it? - That ain't too hard. You've probably got power in the truck, have ya? Oh yeah, I could power that in my truck. Now this stuff will save your life. - Smells good. - It does, doesn't it? Wow, that's pretty good. Not bad, is it? It's better than the juice you've been buying in the bottle. - Cheers. Good health. - Yeah. I would suggest that you eat micronutrient food for two months, then you can do your first fast. If you want, I'll give you my details, you can call me, I'll talk you through it, help you through it. And if you're not down to 210, 220 lbs, I'll eat my hat. It's unbelievable, I can spend eight years with this illness, where I've met maybe one or two, but not exactly the same. And I'm in a bloody truck stop in Winslow, Arizona, and I run into someone. Similar age to me, too. He's had it four years. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I'll tell you what, the smell in here is about to drive me insane. Of all the foods I think that there is that you can put in front of somebody, hot bread that's fresh baked, that smells so wonderful, is probably the hardest thing to turn down. It was for me, because I was about ready to give up. Do you need anything else right now? And. the ribs, I'm not a meat eater, but let me tell ya, those barbecued ribs were really, really lookin' good. They smelled good. This ain't good compared to that. This is a big challenge. This is. a challenge that I did not expect to be so tough. I did not realize how weak I am where food is concerned. G'day, Siong, how are ya? I'm fine, Joe, how are you doing? I'm feeling pretty good. You're looking great. Oh, thank you. We're in. You look pretty good too, by the way. I wanna hear all about it. How are you feeling? Give me the run down. I'm feeling really good. Energy levels mostly up. Less fatigue then even when I'm not fasting. I'm not having any headaches whatsoever, so it's really been - .a wonderful experience. - That's great. I can even tell on the webcam that your face is looking a lot clearer and cleaner and . I think things are just kind of. clearing up all over, from head to toe. She just seemed like everything was out of control for her, and since she's been on this fast, why, things are starting to take shape in her life, where she has some control over her weight and her attitude and her sleep. These types of things. She was totally. totally in despair really, to tell you the truth about her body and her sleep and her physical. her spiritual life was good, but her physical life was deteriorating. So that's good news for me, and her. I feel so much different now from when I started. Being healthy, no headaches, that's the best part. It's incredible. I'm not going for skinny, I'm just going for healthy. No regrets, none whatsoever. I'd do it again, in fact, I probably will. So here I am, on the morning of Day 61. I thought what better way to break my fast than 2,000 feet above the earth on a beautiful morning. Up in that balloon, I renewed my commitment to eat nothing but micronutrient food until I was free of my medication. And then the real test. Would I be able to achieve and maintain a life with balance? 60 days, Here goes. I actually bit my mouth. I'm out of practice. So the great news is, I'm back in Australia. Eight weeks since I've been in that balloon. And guess what? No medication. That's right, I've been one whole week on absolutely no prednisone. It's the best feeling ever. It's just sensational. The changes I've made are not only helping my body, they're also making a big difference to my mind. I invest my own money in growing businesses, both in the US. and here in Australia. So we found the right guy, we're confident that he's the right guy for us? Hello, mis is Shane Hudson speaking. it's Joe, how are ya, mate? So what have we got here? So this is one of the dresses from the Collection Spring/Summer. What I know hes never looked so good before, and actually I find that in board meetings now, he thinks so clearly. Its actually quite interesting. And I wonder if it's because the food, the intake, the. it's cleaner, so therefore his thought processes are cleaner. There’s definitely a difference. So there I am, back in Australia, working on the new Joe, the healthier Joe, the happier Joe. I was on top of the world, and then. You've reached the U.S. cell phone of Joe Cross. Unfortunately Pm in Australia right now, please leave a message, and I will get back to you. Thanks for calling. I just got a really disturbing phone call, and, it was Phil Staples, that truck driver I met in. Winslow, Arizona that has the same awful disease condition that I have. I offered him help and I've gotta do that. I've gotta get over there and see what I can do. The last few years, I've been takin' so many pills, it's just amazing. I'm so tired of it. It's just not right, I mean, no energy to even walk. Always in pain because of the weight on my knees and my legs. My back, I don't feel like walking and I know I should. So we just got into Sioux Falls, not far from Sheldon. Here to see Phil. After we talked on the phone, he decided to try a 'IO-day juice fast. You know I really think Phil can do the 10 days. He seems very committed. I spoke to him on the phone a couple of times. He’s at the beginning of his journey. You gotta admire the bloke though, he's taking some time off work. That's not easy. You know, he hasn't got a lot of, a lot of means, financially that is. He's putting his health first. How are ya, mate? Good to see ya! How you doing? I'm here. ready to go. You look a lot better then the last time I seen you. Ya reckon? You see a difference? I see a big difference, now I want to get there. Oh mate, you'll get here, and listen mate, in true Australian form, I bought you a present. Thanks. Now this is a. See, this is Australian, these are our colors, green and gold are our sporting colors for our country. So you've got Australia there, our flag, What do you see on the front there? A kangaroo. Eh? Yeah, here you go, mate. This is the beginning. Have a look at the size on it. 2XL. Alright, now what are you normally into? 5XL, 6XL. - This is a six. - So what's this gonna be? - A challenge. - The target. That's right. This is life or death for you right now in my view. - I mean this really is. - Yeah, this is. Yeah, you didn't know me when I was sick but, I'm looking in a mirror here. This is how I was. I wasn't as big as you, but I was on my way. Isn't it scary when your parents or your relatives or your loved ones start talking to you, and they're asking you whether you want to be buried or cremated because you're big enough that it's going to be tough to bury you. It's going to be expensive to bury you, so they ask about cremation. For healthy people, doing a 10-day juice fast is fine. But when you're on prescription medication, you need to be supervised by a doctor. We brought Phil in for a full check-up, just to make sure there was nothing else seriously wrong. What will you be able to tell from that? If his heart is structurally sound, if hes had any disease or problems from being overweight. So far, everything was looking good. More tests to go, blood to be taken, and then to the Dexa Machine to measure Phil's fat and muscle content. Sorry but the weight limit on the table is 350 so. you won't fit. The table won't move properly the way it should. I'll be too heavy for it. It depresses me when somebody calls me "big guy". I want to be known as. Phil again. Instead of walking up behind somebody and scaring the tar out of 'em because they see this rather large, angry-looking man, who's not really angry. I'm just in pain. Go ahead and stand up straight. OK, six foot, one inch. Weight is 4296. What do you do for exercise, anything right now? Walk from the truck to the truck stop. OK. Cause all this is just too much to carry for me right now. - It hurts to walk very far. ' Yep, WP- How about your feet and ankles? Have you had a lot of problems with swelling? Oh yeah. It's mostly worse on the left foot. OK. You're at more risk of getting skin breakdown where you'll get ulcers and stuff that can get infected just like diabetes so. You are 429 pounds, which gives you a body mass index, and that's your weight versus your height, and ideally we like that less than 25. You're at 58, which is in the extreme obesity, or morbid obesity. You know, you're almost off the scales for, a few more pounds and I wouldn't have been able to measure you on this type of scale. And what's the prognosis if Phil does nothing about anything and just keeps going the way he's going? What do you think he has the unpleasant things to look forward to? If he doesn't lose weight and keeps going, he'll get diabetes, your blood pressure will continue to rise, which will require numerous medications to keep it under control. With your family history and your high blood pressure, you will be at risk of having a heart attack. If you have a heart attack and your heart dilates from the heart attack and from your blood pressure, you will eventually not be able to breathe and go into heart failure. If the sleep apnea that you probably have from the weight continues, you're at risk of heart failure, which means then you're on pills to get rid of the extra fluid. You limit your ability to walk any further, and you're at risk of sudden death because of your weight. You could just not wake up one morning. Scary. Phil got the all clear from the doc to start a 10-day juice fast. So, it was off to the supermarket to buy some fruit and vegetables. You'll never guess who we bumped into in the car park. So this is your brother? This is my brother Barry, "Bean" Barry, " Bea r." So mate, what do you think about his. current situation, where he's at now? He needs help. But I think, if this works it'd be good for him. - Has he always been like this? - No. - He used to be a scrawny kid. - What do you think happened? That's hard to say 'cause I let myself go too. I used to be 200 pounds. And now I'm up around 300. But that's my own fault. I don't exercise like I should, I don't eat right. That's a lot of Phil's problem. He doesn't exercise or eat right. I just hope this works, 'cause he needs it. Were gonna get him some groceries. Alright, I just got mine, my ice cream melting. See you mate. - See ya later bro. - All the best. Given that Phil had never done anything like this before, we thought it'd be good to get him away from all temptation. Dr. Badberg suggested Phil should do some exercise, starting off with some light walking and swimming. So, we found a great place by the lake. From my point of view, you know, ten days is a huge achievement and it'd be a huge win, and you're gonna feel, you know, terrific at the end of that. I have no doubt you're gonna feel terrific. What would be a good breakfast for juice in the morning? To start with? Well, I used to start with fruit, and then just go into vegetables, with a touch of fruit sometimes the rest of the day. It looks good. That looks good, doesn't it? Looks good to me. Good luck, mate. Ooh, that's good. - You like it? - I like that. How much do you feel like walking? I could do five minutes out and five minutes back. OK, a ten-minute walk. That's a good start. Alright, let's go. He was depressed. He was on the border of, I think, suicide. He was trying to kill himself with food. When Joe got a hold of him, it struck a responsive chord in him, and I think it's great. Now you know you can get me on the phone. Yes. Give me a call, you know, it's gonna be tough but I know you can do it. I've got it now, I think. There ain't nobody to blame in this but me. I stand up and I can't see my toes. I'm not happy with it. I can't clean myself well around it. When I go to the restroom, you know, that's quite. I would almost say a circus act. I guess you could say, takes creative thinking to get to clean the areas down there. I didn't really start putting on weight until after the Air Force and came home and I started to eat because I wasn't happy, and I chose that. And it's been that way ever since, slowly isolating myself. I started getting into truck driving again. My excuse was I was following in Dad's footsteps. 'Cause Dad was a truck driver. But, you know, staying in the truck and staying out a longtime and isolating and eating nothing but greasy foods, that's when it all started. It didn't get real bad until after the second divorce. That's when I really started putting the weight on. 'Cause I thought I was a real failure. So I just started eating til I couldn't eat no more. Because of my health and what's been going on with me, I've been a horrible father. I don't want any of my kids to see me like this. I don't. Not even my youngest boy, he's eight years old. Hes at the age when he really needs to see his father. I'm hiding because of this, I haven't even given him a chance. When I start getting down to where I start feeling better about myself, and being able to do things with my youngest son, throw a football or baseball in the park. Walking with him to see the games and stuff like that. Even just walking around town and talking with him about his day and what he has going on in his young life. I want to be around there for that, for one thing, you know. Being what I call a cheeseburger away from a heart attack is not a good thing. That’s what also gets me upset. I'm afraid to do anything with him. He's the one I'm working for. They all, my oldest children, all want to see me, skinny and handsome again. They've seen pictures, they'd like to see that again. What I'd like to do is lose a decent amount of weight. Even 20 to 30 pounds would make me happy. I was a championship swimmer when I was eight and under, 15 years old. I was winning trophies and medals on the swim team. If I wouldn't have quit, I probably would've gone to the Olympics. I've broken a lot of goals. But for my health and for my life, this is a goal I'm going to keep and stick with and work on. Healthy, healthy, healthy. This is my main goal. Phil's eating habits were typical of the average American diet. As a percentage of calories, roughly 60% of what we eat is processed and refined foods. 30% animal products, 5% whole grains and white potatoes and just 5% are fruits and vegetables, the foods which provide most of our micronutrients Without those micronutrients, our cells are weakened and susceptible to a whole gang of diseases. But Phil has turned that around. He's taken his fruit and veg intake from 5% up to the maximum 100%. Fruits and vegetables are the delivery system that brings the sun's energy to our cells, giving them the micronutrients they need. The micronutrients not only nourish the cells, they also clean and remove the waste. And help them resist all those diseases. And that's why what you eat is so important. But I'll leave the details to the experts. I have this poster, this study was done with Barbara Sarter, a PhD at the University of Southern California, and with Dr. Colin Campbell at Cornell University, on people undergoing weight loss who were diabetic, or high blood pressure, or heart disease. And actually in this study where they follow what we call a vegetable-based diet, the pyramid has vegetables at the base, fruits and beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and then animal products are in a smaller amount. We're talking about twice weekly or less generally speaking, and not eating processed foods, that this healthy diet resulted in the most weight loss of any study ever recorded in medical history. The average person lost 53 pounds, and they kept it off. The people didn't gain the weight back. Now I wouldn't mind if, it wouldn't be so terrible if people were well-educated and well-inform ed, they didn't have to die, and they could make the choice to commit suicide with food. But the unfortunate thing is most Americans are not properly informed. It's just like they can say, you gonna smoke cigarettes? You wanna smoke, go ahead and do it. You're gonna have a heart attack, you're gonna get cancer. You can't escape from the biological laws of cause and effect. What happens to you is gonna be the same thing that happens to every other American. And you're gonna have a healthcare crisis, and you're gonna run to doctors looking for medications to control those symptoms, our headaches, our fatigue, our allergies, our auto-immune conditions, our digestive disturbances. We're gonna be medical-crippled society because were eating a diet style that couldn't be better designed by the best nutritional scientist in the world, to create the epidemic of disease that we have in America. And of course obesity, diabetes, and all these diseases of nutritional ignorance. When you're on a juice fast, there's always something. Something that makes you wanna break. Some obstacle, something that’s there that makes it oh so tough. For Phil, it was a barbecue on the Fourth of July. What I normally do is I'd normally stuff my face, brother. Potato salad, hot dogs, ham burgers, steaks, soda pop, milk. And now I gotta watch that. and drink this. Nice to meet you, Phil, I'm Joanie. - Joanie, and I'm Ray. - Nice to meet you. So what did you make here Phil? It's fruits and vegetables. It's good. It's not bad, I could do it. - You drink that big glass? - This is my meal, every meal. Do you feel full when you're done with that? Yeah, I do actually. You've been on it five days? I've been on it five days and I've already lost 15, no, 17 lbs, almost 20 lbs. And I drink water. But you also inspire me. It's not just for people my size, it's for everybody. I'm gonna go for it. I like this stuff. It was fun, I was excited. My first conversion, so it was really wonderful. I'm just a simple 42-year-old truck driver from Iowa. You know. I'm not the head of NASA, the head of a corporation, you know, and I'm not the village idiot either, thank God for that. Were taught to eat in the bible, in the New Testament. Jesus fasted for 40 days. John the Baptist fasted. The Apostles fasted with Jesus. And its not just Christians that fast. Most religious people, including Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Buddhists, they all fast. I reckon they're onto something. How are you mate? I'm doing good mate, I'm down 30 pounds. 30 pounds, fantastic. What day are we on Phil? That'll be Day 9, Day 10, I'm losing track. What's been the toughest thing about the last ten days? July Fourth weekend! It all got to my food addiction, the hamburgers, the hot dogs, the old me. I was talking to a guy by his grill, and I'm not gonna lie to you, the thought flashed through my head while I was talking to him to reach behind him, pick up a hot dog straight off the grill and eat it. That thought actually raced through my mind. What stopped you from doing it? Common sense. I'm doing this to make my life healthier. I'd like to go 30 days for now. I want to make sure that you feel that going on is of your own volition, that you don't feel like you have to do it for anyone else. Are you sure you want to do it for yourself? I wanna do it for myself. I've already figured it out. In the ten days that we've done this, I've dropped two bowling balls. Nothing would make me happier than you beating me my friend. I’ll tell you what. It's probably not the easiest thing to do but it's well worth it. I mean just by looking at him, you know it's worth it. My mom has tried so many different things, every diet pill that's on the Walmart shelf, or wherever she finds it, on TV whatever. I mean she's spent thousands of dollars and this is one thing she hasn't tried and if it works this well for him, I mean why wouldn't it work for everyone else? And it's all natural, that’s probably the best thing, I think this would be perfect. If I could just get her to try it now. Damn I hate that ball. Hello? Well hello. Wow, look at you! Your valves all look good. Your hearts squeezing better than it was last time. So it appears that whatever you're doing is working. Hello. - Hello. - How we doing? I feel good. Evidently by the tests, I'm doing good. You are doing well. You went from 429 to 368. So that's a 60 pound weight loss in a month. That's excellent. Your blood pressure went down from 160 over 84 which would be high blood pressure, down to 136 over 70, which is a perfectly normal blood pressure. Cool. And your triglycerides, which is your fats in your body were at 216. Today your total triglycerides are down to 161, which is almost in the normal range. My medication, do you think eventually if I keep continue this, I'm sure wed need tests, but maybe that you could take it off or lower it, if I need it. We would probably be able to lower it, if not get rid of it completely - as things improve. - OK. How is your Urticaria doing? I haven't had an outbreak in over a week now. Usually I have something, a small spot here and there. OK. I want to continue this fast. You think it'd be alright if I'd continued? Yes. Everything looks very good on you. There's no signs that it is causing you any adverse effects. If anything, you're much healthier than you were a month ago. Cool. Well isn't that just unbelievable! It's wonderful lam very happy and excited I mean it's nothing short of a miracle. That's pretty much right. All these little victories are making me happy. Oh man, congratulations Phil, well done mate, - I brought some juice. - You brought some juice? Would you like to try some of my juice that I've been drinking? Sure. Mostly green vegetables as you can tell. That's why we call it Mean Green." I'll give you a little shot there. Cheers. Who would have thought Phil that one day, a truck driver from Iowa such as yourself would be bringing medicine to a hospital! It's a little ironic, isn't it? Phil's not the only one with good news. Six months after I finished my fast, I'm 90 pounds lighter. - No pain in the chest? - No. Good. 70% of the diseases that affect us now are caused by our life choices. How we exercise, if we smoke, what we eat, that's saturated fats, carbohydrates, salt and alcohol. Now. Can you have some of that? Sure. Most people have too much of it. Who would've thought I'd get excited about a broccoli salad? He certainly changed his lifestyle. He didn't just change what went in his mouth, he became more active, he stopped drinking alcohol. He doesn't drink tea and coffee, and he doesn't buy manufactured, processed foods. What he's done will go a long way to prevent him from getting heart disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes, and a range of other medical conditions because he's committed himself to a healthier lifestyle. And he did it at 40. Look at you! I've shed some, haven't I? To be fair to Joe, he's probably been an inspiration to us. - Yeah, I'd say that's true. - I'd hate to admit that. - Yeah, don't tell him. - No, please don't tell him, Do not tell him. We don't need to feed that machine. We definitely think we should do it. He got me to try and do it, and I did it for three days. And I rang him and I said mate, I had headaches, I was cross, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate at work, I said "I don't know how you do it, “but I can't do this any more, "I need a meat pie." Are you ready for this? Well hang on to your pineapples! Because Phil fasted for another 30 days. That's right, a total of 60 days on nothing but fresh fruit and vegetable juice. As the weeks passed, he had more and more energy and his face began to glow and in this community he has inspired so many people. He felt so good, he wanted to spread the word. So. he started a community juice fast. Kale. Here's how it worked. The store got a hold of 10 juice machines, which they would lend out to those willing to give it a go. What did they have to do? Six days, on nothing but juice, as long as they consulted their family doctor. - I think it's good. - I like it too. The response was off the charts. And people were already signing up for the next one. Well, the first day I wondered why I did it, 'cuz you know I wanted to eat, and the third night, I got home from a 14-hour day, where I usually would have went to bed, I went outside and I worked for an hour and a half, come in and I got on the computer for an hour, then I watched TV for an hour and finally went to bed at 10:30 and had to get up at 4:00, so. I know I had a lot more energy. At Day 4, I felt amazing. I sleep really well. I lost eight pounds. I'm down 15 pounds. Got on the scale this morning and I've lost 22 lbs, so I'm tickled. Today I just weighed myself and I'm down 91 lbs, which is six bowling balls, ladies and gentlemen. So that is what I used to carry 57 days ago, all over my body. Good morning, how are you doing today? - I'm doing wonderful. - Good. How about the decrease in the methotrexate? That's going wonderful. I was wondering if I could get it dropped some more sometime. You can probably drop some, some more, you've been five weeks without flares? Without any flares. Not even so much as pain or an itch. Once we get you off the methotrexate, then we can get you off the hydroxychloroquine. OK. Eventually we'll have you off of all of them. When are you going to go back to work and do all? I intend to, hopefully, I'm not going back to driving trucks. That darn near killed me. I've got a few applications up at the lake for, you know, active jobs. You know, physically moving around. So what's your family think? They're all proud of me, they're all happy. My brother's a little jealous 'cause I'm catching up to him. He's going up and I'm coming down. You know what I like, I like Spam. I know I shouldn't like Spam, but I do. It's nothing but ham with. I eat Spam. I love Spam too. I used to have it in the truck. Oh yeah. I mean probably on the weekends I could juice a little. And I planned on doing some walking and a little exercise here and there. With me, it's the. social, job, family limitations. Yeah. You know, if I did it, then. Well, you know, I'd be tempted by what they have over here. Then I'd probably fall off the wagon. You don't have to do it as long as I have. I mean you can do it so that you can detox and rebalance your body like for a week. It'd take longer than a week to detox this truck. I get that question a lot. Do I have to do it as long as you? No. You can do it for ten days, I'd recommend at least a week because, you know, the first few days you're gonna feel kind of leh, you're gonna feel kind of nauseous 'cause you're detoxing. And then after a while, you get energetic and everything, and then, you give it awhile. Yeah, that's my problem, trying to put That would make a mess. And it should be a very good proving point to a lot of people that you can make very radical lifestyle changes without having to have surgery or medicine or a quick fix. This is gonna be longer lasting cause you've completely changed how you eat and everything about the way you live your life. When I go off this, I already got my mind made up, I'm gonna just eat soup and salad for a while. I have no desire to eat any of that fast food right now. It's gone. This is something I've always wanted to do, is to help people, in some way or another, knowing that I helped Eugene out, it made my life so much better. - Hi, come on in. - Hey Bear. - Hi, come on in. - Hey Bear. Come on in the kitchen, I'm gonna go sit down, if you don't mind. What happened? I went up to Sioux Falls and I had my knee scoped, and it was right about two hours after we got home, and I had this pain right across my chest, I was hurtin'. I thought it was gas. And then it just kind of creeped up into my jaw. It’s like I had lockjaw. Oh, it just hurt so bad. And then I got light-headed, short of breath, hot sweats just came through. I was leaning on my dresser going, "Oh whatever this is, make it stop, "this is not right." I told Claudia, You better take me to the hospital, somethings wrong.” And they hauled me up to the hospital, laid me on the table, stripped me, wired me up, they said I was having a heart attack. Scared the tar out of me. Scared the tar out of me too, bro. I don't wanna lose my big brother, you know. What kind of medication did they put you on? What do you have in there? Got a little bit of everything. Some aspirin. OK. A blood thinner. Metformin, that's for my Type 2 diabetes That's Mavic for my heart. Lipitor, I think that's that cholesterol pill, I'm not sure. A couple other.. The heart attack kind of opened my eyes. The way I was living was not right. And I'd like to get off these pills. Yeah. Cause a lot of pills, that's not right. I'll end up growing a third eye or something. All right, what are we startin' with? It's usually best to start with the kale because the rest of the vegetables wash it in and mix it up. Then just shove it down. I got it, go ahead. - Like that? - Yep. I think we can live with this for a while. Not full bore. No, I'm not asking you to go full bore because in your condition right now, it's not recommended. I mean use it as a supplement to your diet. Something like, you wake up in the morning and you grab a glass of juice, Mean Green, and you can go on about your day. I've always looked up to my brother He knows this is serious, he knows this has helped me, so he's starting to listen now, he's starting to realize that he can't be real selfish. Hes gotta think of Claudia and Vanessa and his son, Barry, and the rest of us. Little brother leads the way kind of a thing. Hello Dennis! How are ya mate? God, you look different. - Oh thanks mate. - You look great. - How ya been, alright? - Great, terrific. - Doing good? - Yea, very good. - You're a new person - I'm trying mate. You look great! Trying. Hey the girls will come on you, hear me? Doing my best mate. When I started this journey, I thought it was all about the juice fast. But as I now know, that was only the beginning. For the most part, it's been about maintaining a balanced lifestyle. One thing I know for sure: if I go back to my old ways, I'll end up back where I started in no time. So, the choice is mine. I'm under 300! Yeah! Before all this, yeah, I was probably like the rest of the American people out here who had bad eating habits, but I'm taking full responsibility for my life. It was my life, I almost ruined it, now I need to repair it. That Phil at 430 pounds was real dark and just didn’t care. Well he's died. That Phil has gone. Now I'm feeling much better, I'm getting clearer. I'm starting to realize a lot of things, and you know, working my way through them. The food is in itself too, is also making me feel better. I'm feeling so much better then I did at the end of June. So were down here on Manly Beach. I used to come here as a little kid, my dad and my brother, park the car up here, roll out down, straight into the surf. Get bashed by a few waves. It's terrific! And afterwards, wed head up to an ice cream shop just up here, and I'd have a double chocolate ice cream cone, and all was good in the world. Boy, those were the days. We fast-forward 35 years, and I've been on a journey. An expanding one, and right now, a contracting one. I'm very proud. He did an excellent job. He's lost the weight, I hope he continues. Ready, set, go! Once the weight started coming off and he started to see that he was doing this, his demeanor changed, his attitude changed, and the lower he got, I think the better he felt. You're getting better. As far as me doing it? No. I heard you spent the weekend at grandpa's place? - I bring my BB gun. - Cool. I feel great since the fast. I don't have the migraines any more, so that is a big, huge plus. Even if I'm not fasting, I still have to have the juicing because of the nutrients in it. It's just a normal part of my everyday life now. I feel like I'm 21 years old again. Show you how to do this Wii thing. Show me this Wii Fit. See if you can keep up with the old fat guy. Swivel, swivel. Keep swiveling. Put some action into it. Come on. I'm working on it. Wanna see ski jump? Ski jump's cool. Dad loves playing golf, and finally after eight years, Joe and Dad are back on the golf course playing together and I think that’s fantastic. Ah yes! - Good shot! - Right in the middle. - Beauty mate. - Good shot, eh? - Thanks, Dad. - Good on ya mate. Skoal and L'Chaim, all that stuff. To your health. He's got me to see the. the changes in him can help change me. So we're going to try to change me. That was a pretty good batch. Better than this morning. I wonder what I did different. I dunno. I peeled the lemon. That's what it was. I'm proud that he's gotten this far and hopefully he'll be proud of me. I've gone from someone who knew, to someone who would do. And, that's just helped my journey, my journey along, and I'm hoping that I'm gonna stick around here a bit longer. And as for my journey, well, it ain't over yet. Got a long way to go, I hope. Captioning: LVT-New York <font color=#00FFFF">Ripped by JeF, Dec.2011</font> Tell me why you like horror movies. - My name is Anakin, and I like horror movies because the amount of people that get murdered. - --To metal one week, then goth, or, like, glam-rock, but I'm still into horror. - --A culture surrounding it that is very enjoyable and, you know, oddly positive. - --Bloody, it's kind of sexy in this weird way. - Watching a good horror movie will give you a-- a brain orgasm. - I just like watching people die pretty much. - A horror fan? Hell yeah. I'm a monster a kid. Aren't you a monster a kid? - From the outside looking in, they think they're all a bunch of, you know, slobering, crazed idiots. Um, some of them are. - A lot of improv was encouraged. And that produced things like, you know, e-x-i-t, exit. You know, which was basically a tip of the hat to "Sesame Street." - Pretend, like for instance in reality, that 99.9 % of the human population never heard of me, or thinks I'm a dead French guy. - Sid Haig is the only man on the planet that can say that he worked with Lon Chaney, Jr. And Rob Zombie. And I am. - My favorite type of horror film-- it's usually psychological actually, the horror that's implied rather than shown. - I like to do a trash with a Linda Hamilton Terminator Twist. Something like that I think would be, like, my dream role. - You know, I think I'm a good screamer. - --Horror stuff, but you also like, I don't know, rainbows. - --Kicked out of here if I answer that honestly. I'm really not a horror fan. I never have been. - They not only remember anything I did, they remembered shit I didn't even remember doing. - Horror films are my life, um, because I make them. - What am I looking at? I felt like I'd been shown much more than I was supposed to see. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, better lock her door. - The scariest horror movie I've ever seen would have to be Twilight. Five, six, better get your crucifix. Seven, eight, stay up late. - I always wanted to watch them just to be scared, to see how scared I could really get and stay that way. Nine, ten, never sleep again. - We had gone way beyond The Three Little Pigs, and way beyond, some of the other fairy tales. - You can kind of escape your daily life, and-- and, you know, scare yourself a little bit. I think if you're always on edge, a little bit fear is good in life. - People see it, and they're like oh, do you like to cook? I'm like, no, I like axe-murdering maniacs. - I heart monster movies. Alright, and got it. - So my first horror movie was "Nightmare on Elm Street," and that scared the crap out of me, because Freddy Krueger is really scary, and he's really gross looking. - Johnny Depp's eaten by the bed, I just have, like, vivid memories from childhood of having these horrible nightmares of getting eaten by the bed and blood squirting all over my room. - It's kinda cool how, like, when you fall asleep, and then Freddy kinda comes for you. - I'm really picky when it comes to my horror. Like, it has to be good, or I will not sit through it. - --Anything that's scary and creepy, possibly sexy in there somewhere. - --Things like "It." I don't like clowns. - --And the clown were, like, awful, and I would not watch a horror movie for years after that. - --Going out in the rain, seeing, like, storm drains and just thinking of clowns. - My mother came into the shower when I was a kid and would throw balloons up, and start making the sounds that the clowns did on the movie "It." Scared the hell out of me. Yeah. - They come in-- in-- in all walks of life. I have teachers, and soccer moms, and lawyers, and-- - So I'm pretty much just a-- a-- a mild fan, I guess, when it comes to horror movies. I like to go and watch them. It doesn't really influence my life. - --Not a uber fan, like, I have many friends who are. - Basically grew up watching horror, I think, like a lot of kids do. - Well, I wouldn't consider myself to be a fan of horror movies. - I'm a definite horror fan. I went to the drive-ins. - I hate horror movies. - People actually say they think, like, my house looks like a Halloween house, because I have skulls hanging in cages outside of-- all year round. - I've always been into the macabre, anything that's really spooky, and scary, and stuff like that. - I like horror films because-- a real horror film, not a slasher film. - Oddly enough, even though I love horror films, I don't handle gore that well. - --The American stuff, which is more just straight blood and guts-- which, I mean I can appreciate, too. - Gotta have blood. Lots of blood. - As long as it's horror, I'm pretty happy person. Yes. - Hi, mom. - My name is Annie Violet, and I am here at the Seattle Zombie Con. So, I'm from southern California. So, drove all the way up here just to see everyone, and, like, hang out and see all the panels. Very excited about the panels. - I'm at Zombie Con because I have been a lifelong zombie fan. - The thing about conventions is there's always, like, tattoos buzzing, and flourescent lights, and a lot of people you need to talk to, and you gotta stay charming, and you probably sleep all of three hours a night. So, they're definitely draining, but they're super fun. And you, you know, you get to hang out with people you don't normally get to see. - I'm here because I'm a horror freak. I adore movies, adore the genre, video games, comic books, you name it. I love it. - There's a lot of fun to be had. You can meet a lot of people who've created these works of art, be it films, or books, or paintings, or, you know, whatever. You need a lot of people behind that. - I just like the vendors, and I love, like-- I can find things. It's like, oh, I freak out. I'm like-- I nerdgasm. - Yeah, you get to be with other people who like to be weird and put blood on their face and dress like characters, too. - One of the great things about doing The Twisted Geeks podcast is we get to go to conventions, like Zombie Con, like Crypticon, and other ones that I love, like StarFest, where we get to meet, not only just the fans of all this and see the great fan outpouring, but we also get a great opportunity to meet the-- the minds behind all the stuff that we've enjoyed, some of the writers, directors, especially the actors. And we get to spend time interviewing and talking with them. And it's been a fantastic time. - Yeah, I look up, Malcom McDowell is ahead of me getting coffee. Chuck Palahniuk and Max Brooks are trading notes for their talk that night. And George Romero is just kicking it in the lobby, and I just look around, and I'm like, I'm surrounded. There's so much genius in this room. It was very hard for me to contain myself, and not just run up to everyone and be like -- oh my God, I love you. I'm such a fan! - If this seems a awkward for people at home, it's because the people that are interviewing me right now have no idea what I've done. So I'm feeling like -- I'm sitting here like, what do I do. I have to like feed them into this stuff. - Going to shows like this, and you see the way people dress, and the way that they get into it -- and they express themselves, and something that they like. I've always -- as an outsider, someone who's not really into the genre myself, I can still appreciate the fact that they are enjoying it, and enjoying themselves. - These people had seen everything, a lot of them, and they would probably -- I don't mean to be mean, but they'd probably be more equipped to interview me than this stuff -- don't even know - I'm telling you because they are the best. Our film fans are absolutely the best there is on the planet, OK? They buy all the tickets, they buy the DVDs, the posters, the T-shirts, the pictures, the -- whatever the hell and the crap we come up with, because they're there supporting us all the way down the line, and without them I got nothing. You what's your favorite line in this, and my mind's going, oh God - - I don't know, what's your favorite line? And then they would tell it to me, and I would say, coincidence! That was my favorite line too. And I'd write it on the thing. - I don't talk to the celebrities, only because I'm always scared it's going to change the way I see the movies, or anything I'm interested in them in. I like to see them in like every day life. You know, you see like -- like we saw like Boondock Saints just walking around casually like last night, and Sid Haig just walking around. And like that alone is awesome to me -- just to see them in real life when they're not in a film. So I usually don't talk to them much. - I have mixed feelings about autographs. I really love get, you know, my picture taken with someone, and get, you know, my book, or my poster, or my movie signed, but I'm also very poor and don't want to pay $20, $20, $20, $20, down the line. - I don't do this for the money. I have my school, I'm -- you know -- Independent. I come here because of hanging out with Mosley or Sid Haig, you know? How hard is it to sit here and have people throw money at you all day, you know? If you complain about that you're a moron. - Finished signing an autograph here and there's a guy that comes to the table over here who said, would you sign my dick? I said, no I wouldn't. Not even if you washed it recently. Besides which, I'm not sure I could fit my signature on it. - Lovecraft has kind of enjoyed this resurgence in popularity. People are taking an appreciation of sort of their -- the literature aspect of it. In fact, in Portland we have a bar, the whole theme of which is Lovecraft. The guy's kind of painted on the ceiling, and painted on the floor, and posters, and all kinds of crazy stuff on the wall. - Hello, I'm John Horrid. I'm the owner of the Lovecraft bar in Portland, Oregon. The Lovecraft bar is not a Gothic bar. It's a horror-themed bar embracing all horror culture. Be it literature, music fashion or art. That way it's a broader spectrum for everyone who loves anything dark or spooky that goes bump in the night. It's sort of like Tim Burton designed a lounge, you know, it's goofy horror. It's not so serious, But it's definitely -- we have children's coffins on the walls. There's bones everywhere, and chains, but it's also kind of fun feeling. H.P. Lovecraft is probably one of the biggest names in horror, but has never got credit for it. It's always Poe, and Stephen King, and Anne Rice, and whatnot. But Lovecraft's impact on the world of horror is immense. They've inspired Metallica, Iron Maiden, mentioned in "Ghostbusters" "Hellboy" -- he's everywhere. He's dark, he's gloomy, he's a total freak, and he's awesome. I didn't want to be specifically Lovecraft themed because there's so much more to offer, and I'm a huge fan of black-and-white horror movies honestly, so it's just basically, I wanted to capture that sort of feel. With the broader spectrum of horror, it attracts all sorts. I love that we've attracted authors, for example, like young, punky, splatter horror authors are hanging out here. Apparently the road manager to Metallica has been hanging out here. One of my favorite nights ever, we first opened -- you got your sulking metal heads, and your gloom-and-doom goths over here, and there's a girls dressed all in white -- she's bouncing around, and I'm like, fuck, here we go, there goes the end of the bar, you know? But I'm not a dick, I want to, like, be polite. She came up, she's like, you're the owner? And I was like, yeah, I'm the owner. And she's like, I love your bar. And I'm like, thank you, you know? She's like I'm gonna tell all my friends about it, and I'm like, cool. And she's like, I'm a librarian. And I'm like, please tell all your freaky library friends, 'cause librarians are freaks yo. Bottom line. And we're slowly attracting across the country a buzz with little to no advertising. I don't Twitter. I fucking hate that shit. Word of mouth has been strong enough that horror fans are coming to us. And ultimately my goal is to get, like, Bruce Cambell or in here, just to hang out. And they drink for free, of course. So I was in a huge sort of renovated furniture, recycled materials place. And I gave the question, I was like, what do you have that's uncomfortable for you guys here? And they mentioned, their 1890s children's coffins, and I was like, oh I got to see those. And they're mahogany, and they came in the original packaging. I fell in love with them the second I saw them. And the price is right. I can't say I've spent more on sushi, but I've come close. And they had a matching pair. And even the guys who delivered didn't want to touch the boxes -- they were so superstitious. The Lovecraft Bar is an art project always in motion. Whenever I'm out, antique stores or whatever, I always ask whoever is working there, what's the most messed up thing you have here? What makes you uncomfortable? And then I usually guy it. Animal traps, old surgical instruments, coffin handles, weird taxidermy art, stuff like that has always appealed to me. Chainsaw Manicure. It was actually pretty easy to break into movies when I first started, because I was at a young age. I actually looked a lot younger than I was. I was 18 when I started, and I looked probably, oh 15 or 16. So it was actually a pretty easy step for me to get into it. And they were doing a lot of the '80s horror films, and I fit right in, at that time, as being a victim. After "Return of the Living Dead" and "Night of the Demons," all of a sudden, like People Magazine, Entertainment Tonight, all these, you know, press people started coming to me -- Premiere Magazine. And they start calling me, you know, Queen of the Screams, which is like, I love it, you know? I like that title. I want it. And so I embraced it, where a lot of the actresses back then -- like nudity wasn't, you know, you just didn't do nudity back then. I was doing some nudity. You didn't do, like, these B-films that would hurt your career. And I just, like I said, embraced it instead of just shrugged it off, and said, I'm not doing one of those films. It's blood, breasts, and they did say bimbos, but it's not bimbos anymore. It's more strong women. But you've got to have some blood, and you've got to have some breasts, I think, to have a good horror film. I mean, I make the perfect scream queen, it's shown at theaters -- it's been shown at theaters. I've done like 100 films, I love horror. I think you have to love horror too. And you have to scream very well. This is a crazy fan is - Ahhh! - There's a lot of really good horror bands out there, but I think the one that did -- has the greatest influence over things would be White Zombie. They're one of the few that started off doing horror for the very start. And even the name, White Zombie comes from the movie White Zombie, which some people think is the first zombie movie ever made. - I joined White Zombie be back in 1980 -- like late '85/86. Joining a band before White Zombie with Shauna. It was a band called LIFE. And so that's how I met her. We did a few shows, band broke up. They got -- she was going out with Rob Zombie, and basically they called me up right after they had this drummer Peter do a couple songs. I jumped on board and we started, just immediately writing and recording, and touring. We just picked up right away. Rob had that band named before the band was even formed. So White Zombie already existed before the band was even in existence. He just said, I want a band to be called White Zombie one day, and then he put the band together with Shauna. Rob and I both had that background of horror movies. He brought that flavor into the band, and I was all about that because, you know, I came from the horror stuff myself. And I was all into Iron Maiden with the Eddie monster thing, so I thought that was perfect, you know, for something I wanted to do. You know? Toxic Zombie, man, these guys are awesome. Bryan Bennett worked with me on "Metalopolis." That's when I first -- when he first joined Toxic Zombie, and they did a Halloween show where they had me come up, play "Thunder Kiss" with them. We hung out and talked about doing the some songs here in the studio. - If you were to describe what kind of music we play, if you would imagine that -- and you have to have a good imagination for this -- imagine if Kiss, Motley Crew, and the Misfits had a gang bang with Joan Jett, Lita Ford, and Wendy O. Williams, we would be their bastard children. It didn't actually start out as a zombie band, even though we were called Toxic Zombie at first. We actually started out more as just a regular hard rock band with a little influence. And then we had the dancing girls, of course and stuff. But it didn't actually start out as a zombie band until probably a couple months into doing our first shows. We just kind of embraced it a little bit more. And I actually think Sam, actually, is the one who kind of embraced the concept a little bit more. Yeah, I was the first one to put on the make up, and I looked rather weird without everybody else putting the make up on. - It's a very unconventional type of thing. There is a zombie culture, there's a horror culture, but there are -- in Portland and I'm sure they're out there, but I'm not aware of them, there's not too many horror bands. - We've played a lot of gigs with -- we've played with the Misfits, Wednesday 13, Gunfire 76, is also connected. And we opened up for Creature Feature was one of our first, bigger shows that we played with, which kind of led to all those other shows, Wednesday 13 and the Misfits and what not. And we also played a local event called Zombie Prom a few years ago, and having 600 people scream out "we will eat your brains" with us was probably one of the best moments ever to have at a show, you now? - Especially when they're all dressed like zombies. Got a mass of zombies in front of us chanting, "we will eat your brains." Like, how can it be better? We're here at Zombie Prom 2011. - We are in fabulous Portland, where there is nothing but zombie awesomeness. Is Zombie Prom 4. My inspiration for doing it, really was, there's not enough events downtown that were inexpensive, fun to go to. My idea for this was someone could roll around in the dirt, the mud, come in, you know, with clothes from Goodwill, something like that, and come to a prom. - My name is Blake. This is -- who the hell are you? - Janellle. Nice to meet you. - Oh, OK. I found her. She's a random zombie. We like her though. My impression is really fun. Just a group of people dressing up and going to a dance. I don't care for horror movies, but I'm here to have fun, so this seemed like a really fun thing to do and I'm all dressed up. This is my first big zombie event. The first I've actually gotten dressed up to show up outside of Halloween, other than being cast for a play or a movie. Actually I set the Guinness World Record for fastest straitjacket escape in 2007 when I was stationed over in Japan, and it works great as a costume. Everyone seems to recognize it wherever I go. It's kind have been a staple for Halloween, any other type of dress up event, or anything for fancy dress. - We are foreign exchange students at this zombie prom. This is our 4th year, and I was just looking for something different to do so -- I always wondered if the vampires did exist, what would they do when everybody turned into zombies. What are they gonna eat? - Maybe they would just come out and have some fun. - Yeah. The first year we didn't have a theme with it, it was just Zombie Prom 1, and we expected about 200-300 people and ended up with almost 700. So we weren't expecting that at all. So we had to move to move to a bigger venue, and we've been at the Bosanova ever since. The first one we had here was Under the Dead Sea. And then we had a Pretty in Pieces last year, and then this year is Tiki Terror. My name is Audrey Angel. I'm one of the merch girls this year, selling the art up there. I do colored pencil work that's pretty photo realistic, but I do it of a fantasy nature, so I turn people into zombies, or mermaids. You know, I've done lots of zombie events in the past. I did Zombie Prom here a couple years ago as a merch girl. I do the Zombie Walks every year. I had a random zombie wedding with a girl a few years back. I like making horror things, I don't -- I don't really like being -- I don't like watching horror movies, but as soon you give me the project of making something explode, or into a gory mess, I live for that. - There are little ones everywhere. We're one of the biggest in this side of the United States. There are a lot of individual parties, children's parties, I get asked all the time how to do a zombie kid's party. Things like that. - My name is Robyn Winn and this is Sofia. I would consider myself a hardcore horror fan. It's not all I live and breath, but I am a really big fan, and I like them a lot, which is weird 'cause when I was little I was kind of scared. Of them. - I wasn't allowed to watch a lot of horror movies growing up. My parents took the R rating very seriously, so I was restricted from watching a lot of these films. - My family's really -- anything scary, horror, blood, it's, you know, the devil's work. - My mother-in-law, Joe's mom, she's not very supportive of us like letting her watch horror stuff. There's nothing that's going to warp her, and like I said, there's nothing overly sexual or super, super gory, and not a lot of realistic violence. - My son's 11 and he's been watching horror movies since he was four. And it's nothing -- I mean, I I'm not concerned. He doesn't talk about it to a point where it scares me. He doesn't do anything that would scare me. - The first horror movie I ever saw was "Ghost Ship," and I was four. I was a smiling the entire way through it. I just loved it. - The first movie I ever saw in the theater was "Beauty and the Beast," the Disney. And I actually was so, I was really young, and I was so frightened of the beast on the big screen when he was all angry, that I actually ran out of the theater and had to like stay out in the lobby and calm down. - What I know is every Disney movie has a really bad scary guy in it, and psychologists will tell you that kids gravitate towards that part of the movie because they get to practice handling their fear. - It was "King Kong" or "Godzilla" or whatever, and it was really funny because my mother would watch them with me for the first couple of years, to make sure they didn't tweak me out for some reason. - My name is Sally Skelding, and I'm an early childhood specialists. And throughout my career in early childhood, I've been very interested in the impact of violence on television and movies, and how that influences the behavior of young children. - With Kiara we watch like Addams Family movies, and Army of Darkness, 'cause it's super campy. Nothing too gory, nothing sexual. - Being a parent, I have a six old daughter, so my horror community has veered back towards the Munsters, and the Addams Family, and Universal Monsters. - In the very early years they do not think the way that we think. They do not construct a reality the way that we do, and a lot of people simply cannot accept that. They'll say, oh my child understands this, I explained that to them. And the child will sit there and go, oh yes, I know this is pretend, but they really don't because until they're about eight or nine years old they do not even begin to think the way that we do. Hey, so when we watch horror movies, you know it's not real, huh? - I know it's just fake. - Is it costumes? Some times they use puppets, right? Remember you were asking about Army of Darkness and if the skeletons were on strings. And I told you they were puppets, remember? - That's like "Pee Wee's Play House." - She does understand that it's costumes and props. - A very young children, like a preschool child, will go to see one of these horrible movies, and they think this is real. Even though they bought the ticket, they've gone in with their parents, everybody says this is pretend. What they see on the screen is real because it resembles their reality. - My first exposure happened at age six, and this was back in the 1970s when PG movies could get away with a lot more. So I saw full-frontal naked Brooke Adams, and Donald Sutherland smashing in the head of his alien doppelgangers here with a shovel, and kinda going, what am I looking at? I felt like I'd been shown much more than I was supposed to see. - Children have to see it over, and over, and over, and over again in order to try to make sense out of it. So they see it, it comes into their mind, they have to make an adaptation between what they've seen and their reality. If they're young, up to like seven or eight years of age, that can be almost impossible sometimes for them. - Just as long as you talk to your kids about it, and you're like, it's not real. But you can't really keep them from having nightmares, but I mean, you know, watching "Poltergeist" at eight didn't hurt me. - Part of the problem is that, in this age, we think the child is anything from zero to 18, and so what we would allow our 18-year-old child to watch, then we go ahead and let our baby go to the movies with this. Or we take our three-year-old or our four-year-old. We no longer make those very clear distinctions about what is appropriate for children who are in the early childhood years and early primary years, and what would be appropriate for an adult or for an older teenager. - As a mother, I don't have a problem with horror movies. We don't, like we don't shy away from her right now with her around 'cause she's too little to really notice, but I do have a stepson and he is seven. He will not watch anything with blood in it. He's like, no I won't watch that, it's scary, and if it's got blood in it I won't watch it. And I mean it's really like up to him. - You will find absolutely no child guidance book, no book on child development, no expert on early childhood that will say, oh yes, the thing you need to do is to fill your child's head with horror. - I think that horror movies themselves don't affect anybody. I think it's how -- I think it's the person that decides how the movie's going to affect them. Because I do work with children, and there are children who do watch horror movies, and they come to school and they are perfectly behaved, and they don't perseverate on the violence, or the horror. And then I have other kids who come and that's all they do, is to perseverate on the violence and the horror. - Bottom line is, the kids take everything off of the parents' vibration about it, so if the parents think it's OK and it's just another movie, the the kids grow up thinking it's OK and its just another movie. - I kinda grew up as a gentle creature in a somewhat hostile environment, and I do believe that horror films helped me process my environment. - I don't think anybody ever landed on a therapist's couch and said, I'm hear because I watched horror films. - I just think that this horror stuff, if it goes in, it's going to come out and we don't know how it's going to come out, and we do know from the research that it does indeed create some insensitivity to other people's feelings of fear, or terror, or if we see people on the street that need help, we can't sympathize with them anymore. We don't have the empathy that apparently, as a society, that we used to have. - Even now it's kind of like old hat. I look down and go, OK, whatever, she's getting tortured. Yeah, OK. Chainsaw to the head, yeah, OK, whatever. So I'm desensitized by it, but I love watching it, and I love making it. - The horror's all around us at all times, whether you want to believe it or not. Just turn on the news. You know, people are being abducted, and raped, and killed, and beheaded, and dumped by the side of the road every single day. None of this is from the imagination of a horror film director. Texas Chainsaw Manicure. - I Had seen the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." It really freaked me out, so what I ended up doing was -- my best thinking was, if I see it about a dozen times it's going to become so familiar that it won't freak me out anymore, and really all that happened was it just drove that wedge deeper and deeper each time I saw that movie. And I penned about a five minute scenario about a woman who goes to a beauty parlor, gets her hair done, wants to get a manicure, Leather Face comes out with a chain saw and gives her the manicure. And she comes out of the beauty parlor, and I'm her husband waiting in a pickup truck, and she comes and she goes, look honey, I got the best manicure ever. And I had a friend from high school who was now a screenwriter in Hollywood, and I showed him and his wife my five minute video of the Texas Chainsaw Manicure, and he said, you know what a coincidence, my writing partner and I have an office right across the hall from Toby Hooper, the director of the original Chainsaw Massacre. And Toby, was working on "Poltergeist" at the time, and he said if you leave me a copy of the Manicure, I can maybe walk it into Toby. I said, well that'd be cool. I mean that'd be kinda cool for him to watch it. So I did, and he did, and Toby watched it, and Toby loved the Manicure. And Toby loved my performance in the Manicure. And Toby be called in his producing partner, Steven Spielberg, who also watched the Manicure and loved it. And two years later, that was 1984, two years later when they were casting "Texas Chainsaw II," I got the job based on my little cameo the "Texas Chainsaw Manicure". I never auditioned for it. I Never met Toby until I got to Austin, Texas to get my head shaved and start going undergoing the transformation from me to Chop Top. And that really, kind of, was how I got my big start. - Yeah, some of them bug the shit outta you, yeah. But you know, it ranges from little kids to doctors and lawyers. You know? I mean the fans are a pretty eclectic group. You know? - I've really been lucky. I've never had anybody at a horror convention bother me intensely. - With traveling around in different cities, and meeting different people for these conventions, I've met -- yeah -- I've met all kinds of people. For the most part, the fans that I meet are relatively normal, appreciative people. - It was our first convention ever, and a fan comes in. And it was packed. - "Grindhouse" had just come out a month before. So there was just a lot of people waiting to get signatures from us, and it was our first time so we were just, you know, overwhelmed, and this guy comes up, and he's very excited, and he gives me a gun. And it's heavy, and he's like, I want you to shoot anybody in the audience. And I was just like, I'm OK. I was like, oh cool. - And so she points the gun, and he's like, you shoot it. - And this person goes, it doesn't have a red cap on it. And we're like -- - The tip. And now she's like, what is it? And I was like, is this a real gun? - And he says, yeah. It's loaded - It's my gun. And I was like, it's loaded? - And then Geoff Bayhi had heard all of it, and so he -- - He grabs the gun, and he opens the gun and notices it has real bullet in it. - And in 2 seconds security was around the guy, like had him down, and I had to explain to him that it was just all make believe. You know? Like he thought that we had killed people. He was like, oh yeah, shoot somebody -- - And she was gonna shoot the gun. She could have killed someone there. It was crazy. - It was a crazy signing. - Yeah. - Well I've never had really any crazy ones. No one's ever, you know, threatened us or anything. You know? But there are some pretty eccentric ones. One guy will come over and he'll spend $400, you know, and you'll sign some photos, then he takes them and he folds them, sticks them in his pocket and walks away. - It was -- somebody had spilled some stage blood on the name Otis on the floor plate, and I thought, that's weird, you know? Then I went down and I had breakfast, and then I came up and I was in the other elevator, and the door opened and there was more blood on the other Otis. And it turned out it was a stalker that had done that intentionally. In fact, she called up the room -- I remember I was already asleep or something, and the phone rang and this female voice said, hello -- this female voice said, I'm your stalker, and I said, I'm sleeping now, stalk me tomorrow. And I hung up the phone and that was it. - Mine were both female, and there was a kind of a psycho sexual thing going on. But they both melted away into the darkness. - You know, some fans will stand here and spider webs will form on them. You know, they stand there all day and they're interviewing you all day, but normally we have a signal with security. You know, we do that, it's time to get this -- ask them to go for a walk or something, you know. - Last one I did, I lost my wallet, and I lost my bag out of this stupid -- oh shit, I lost it again! It's like 1992, like lap sack thing. Like -- I left it somewhere. Both of them, in the middle of thousands of people were brought back to the concierge, and put in the lost and found. No offense to LA, but shit you lost that stuff in LA and it'd be gone. You know, I had my wallet in it, nobody even opened it, they just brought it back, and it was like, I just came up, nobody opened anything. It was just, basically, saying a lot about the kind of people. - My name's Tunisia and I'm doing the Monster Shoot Pinup Calendar, and I am the werewolf. - My name's Ren Murry. My company is Golden Era Pinups. It's kind of our art that we do. You know, really a lot of re-creation of classic pinup -- you know, whether it be classic photography, or Bettie Page Photography. Gil Elvgren is, you know, a legend in the industry. Elvgren's paintings are, you know, what we call today cheesecake, which is the whole, you know, cutesy kind of thing, with the big oopsy face, and the, you know, skirt being blown up by the wind, or the dog's got a hold of the dress. Or you know, those kind of crazy, almost unbelievable situations. The Monster Pinup Calendar was sort of a collaboration of ideas where, you know, we kind of had this idea -- well they had the idea originally to do, you know, monster pinups. You know, there's a number of different ways we could shoot it, and a number of different loos that we could give the calendar. We sort of all agreed that we wanted to keep it more Elvgren-painting inspired. Obviously there are liberties being taken with the way that they're dressed and their overall look. Elvgren didn't do a lot of Halloween themed, or monster themed kind of stuff. There was a little bit of that in his work, but we sort of took that and ran with it. You know, I had done like zombie pinups before. I've done a couple of zombie calendars -- things like that. But they were always shot on location, it was very zombie specific. The freedom of this calendar allowed us to sort of go and try new things. When it was first proposed to me that we were have a werewolf in the calendar, I thought, OK, why not make zombies sexy and get that concept. You know? And a lot of these other things are going on here, and get how we're gonna make them. Sexy I just could not imagine how we were gonna take a beautiful girl, cover her in hair and tattered clothes, and make that sexy. But In the end, you know with the way everything came together, she wasn't overly hairy but it still translated, you know, in the look that it was definitely a werewolf. Just that whole composite background, we gave it a nice creepy sort of background, but with her, sort of, knee-up on the rock, and was doing this very provocative type of pose. Women I've ever seen, I have to say. The ghost shot was one that we had to use our heads up front while doing the actual shoot. You know, how are we gonna create the illusion of her floating through the air, you know, and actually being a ghost? We went ahead and decided to actually just have her standing, doing her poems and then I did separate shots of her from the knee down, just sitting on a stool with her feet sort of dangling out in a few different angles and whatnot. And then from there, it was just sort of making sure that those angles matched up with the way she was standing and everything, you know, looking as seamless as possible. With the demon shot -- that's the one where the young lady is sitting on the chair, she's got. That's directly inspired by a Gil Elvgren painting. The pose. The whole, you know, holding the pumpkin out and everything. I kind of enjoy, in that particular photo, is having her face on that pumpkin. You know, creating the jack-o-lantern with her face. So for me, that was one of the things I was most proud of. Making it have that, sort of, inner glow with her own face on the jack-o-lantern. This was a tough for me to do because of, you know, kind of exploring new territories. They wanted me to put my style into it, but at the same time, I sort of wanted to make sure that the calendar was a little bit distinct from my normal, you know, kind of everyday pinup style. I think we were hugely successful in doing that. You know, the calendar's got, sort of, my signature style, but at the same time, is of at least a small departure from what I normally do. A lot of what I actually learned in doing this calendar has started to, sort of filter into my daily work with my clients, and models that I work with. - So there's a long history of hearses. They have motorcycle hearses, they started out with the horse-drawn carriage hearses. It's a very, very long history. - Paired up with death, but they're a beautiful car. Each hearse is totally custom built. - Everbody likes to call them a hearst with a t. Pretty much 90 % of the population tend to get that wrong, and it just digs into the bottom my soul, but I'm done correcting people in it. If they can't read my shirt then that's alright. - You get a lot of funny looks from people, you know? Especially driving through downtown Portland. You know, people look to see a hearse, and a hearse, and a hearse, and you can just watch heads turn and people are always trying to figure out what's going on. - We are as Coffin Cruisers -- we're in our ninth year. There was another club prior to that, and just like any type of club you're going to have differences of opinions and that's kind of what happened with the old club that morphed into the new club. - People start hearse clubs so you can be around people that have the same interest. There's lots of other car clubs -- you know, corvette clubs, mustang clubs. - So we've had a pretty good membership over the last several years of, you know, anywhere between 9-13/14 people, and just like other cars, they come and go. They break down and go away, and typically that's how we lose most of our members. - My dad, he wanted one ever since he was in the third grade, and my mom wanted one since she was in high school, and they came to me and said, how would you feel about having a hearse? And I said as long as it's white. - For me it was the horror stuff. For some reason, ever since I was a little kid I remember seeing like a hearse going by, and it's like, oh that's sweet. What is that? It just had -- it was a slow funeral procession with motorcycle police escorts, and it was just amazing to see all the traffic at a dead stop, and let this nice long procession go. - Right there in your face with it. You got all that Detroit steel right there. I wanted one and I refused to drive a minivan by all means, you soccer moms are out. - What makes a hearse different is they have a purpose, a very specific purpose, which is to take those that have passed to their final resting spot. You're talking about a 7,000-9,000 lb. Vehicle that hold two people and a dead person, and is typically about 20-22 feet long. They're hard to miss, so they're fun to drive. - When we have different car shows -- things coming up, or different events for Halloween, people will contact the website, and then I try to get in contact with them, see how many cars they want, if they want to be all tricked out for Halloween type things or whatnot. I remember we actually did a wedding at the cemetery that they wanted the bride and the groom to come up with the bridesmaids and groomsmen, all in hearses. That turned out really well. My hearse is a 1970 Cadillac Miller Meteor. It's -- I'm the fourth owner. It's been owned by two mortuaries. It's specific purpose, it appears to have been mostly a children's hearse. It's painted very light color, it's beige, so that's a little unusual. It's usually a children's-related hearse. And it shows a lot of evidence of having hauled a lot of small coffins. - Well, my mom's not too fond of the hearse. I run a foster home for medically-fragile, disabled children, and I used my hearse as a wheelchair vehicle. She kind of cringes a little bit when we show up at Dorenbecher's Children's Hospital and I'm rolling out looking like this, with my tattoos pulling wheelchairs out of the back. And Kids have a seat that rides in the back there as well. That kind of freaks people out. My daughter's doing this out the window as we're driving down the road. - My friends and family, you know, my dad helped me buy it, and he's an eight-year-old conservative Republican. Maybe my neighbors across street that are trying to sell their house, they don't necessarily like it so much, but they're about the only ones. - I think you're probably a hearse fan first, if you own a hearse, before you want to buy one. Just 'cause you like horror stuff, if you like horror things and go buy horror effects, you know, a hearse first, and then probably have an interest in, you know, the dark side of things, or the macabre stuff. - I don't have like, it all deck out with skeletons and things like that. I have it very classic, with the white-wall tires, and just want to keep it as professional looking as possible. So that's my goal. Just to have, like a collector's car that's a little more on the macabre side. - My cars' all are custom. They've got skeletons hanging from the ceiling in there. You know, big fan white walls was kind of in your face vehicles. Those look like the Halloween props, when we put the Halloween props in. - Especially Zilch. - Yeah, especially Zilch. Zilch is a little zombie baby that we put in the car. He creeps me out. He doesn't like to ride in the same seat as Zilch. - My name's Voltaire, and I have a little bit of trouble explaining exactly what it is that I do, because I do a lot of different things. I started out as a stop-motion animator. I animated and directed some of the early MTV and Sci-Fi channel station IDs -- all of the spookier ones, I like to think. And I got into making comic book, so I made some comic books -- sci-fi, horror, usually with a touch of comedy. And then at some point in the '90s I learned to play guitar, and I, on a dare, played a live show which got me signed to a record label, and I've been a recording artists ever since. - Everything I do tends to be macabre. So there's always, sort of an appreciation or a love for monsters and the macabre, and there's also, usually, a sense of humor. I don't choose to put the macabre in my music. The macabre is just in my music, because I'm macabre. And that may sound really, I don't know, pretentious or corny, but it's just the truth. Everything around me, I inevitably find some cynical or sarcastic way of looking at. I have been a fan of monsters since as far back as I can remember. My earliest memories were memories of, you know, getting excited because "King Kong Vs Godzilla" was going to be on the 4:30 movie. As a child, if it had a monster in it, that was all I needed. So "King Kong" is probably my favorite film, and as far as I'm concerned it's a monster movie. I was on tour a few years ago, and I was in Portland Oregon, and I was in a bookstore -- no record store, and I saw a gentleman signing a Bauhaus poster, and that gentleman was apparently the bass player -- David J. And at some point, when I least expected it, the man came up to me and said, excuse me is your name Voltaire? And I said, yes. He said, did you write a book called "What is Goth?" And I said, yes. And he goes, I loved that book. Would you autograph it for me? And I like, wow -- the bass player of Bauhaus is asking me for my autograph. This is pretty epic. - Yes, I'm a founding father, if not the godfather, of goth. It is said that I wrote the song, "Bela Lugosi's Dead," but actually I made a contribution to the song, in that I wrote the lyrics and the bass line. And then Peter saying it as if he'd been singing it for years. And then we recorded the thing, like the next week. So it was all very quick. And then it was made into a record very quickly, and it took off. - Director -- Mr. Scott. He saw a performance of ours on a TV show called "Riverside," and we were doing "Bela Lugosi's Dead," and he ran it Bowie and Bowie gave it the thumbs up. As far as my favorite type of horror film, it's usually psychological actually. And the more subtle, and the horror that's implied rather than shown, I think, is much more potent. Unleash with no fear. People don't like it when we hold back. When you're -- we you watch someone on stage and they're holding back, then we're going to hold back. We're not gonna go crazy. We notice when the band is going crazy, the audience is going crazy. Right? - We are Dead Animal Assembly Plant. We're a horror industrial band. The story goes back to the Sweet Meat's slaughterhouse. It was found in the late 1800s by someone named Wilhelm Schroder, who industrialized butchery with the machines. And after he was fed to the machines by the townspeople, the Sweet Meat's Slaughter remained empty until we came along. - Be who you are -- 100 %. Kick ass, and then you're gonna be proud of yourself, because no one else is gonna give a shit except you in the end. - The whole theme is cannibalistic, murderous, you know, slaughterhouse, kind of dirty south -- more the embrace of raw industrial sound. It's not clean, it's not perfect, but it is sincere. - So If you want to do a horror kind of thing, do a horror kind of thing. But do it 100 % present! Don't just do a little dibble dabble. Don't just get one monster, get all the monster. You know, make them as ugly as you can. Like, big teeth, you know? With fire. Saw blades. - Virtually every creative outlet I have, horror films have wormed their way into it. - Started working on independent feature films. Did everything from being a blood guy to dealing with the body parts. - To which I'm really, really grateful, because it's made my work a lot better and more interesting than it use be, I think. - To washing off the naked women when they were done doing their blood scenes. - I wrote a book called "Shadow Play: Philosophy and Psychology of the Modern Horror Film," to explore aspects of the psyche that we're trying to leave behind as we reach for civilization. And horror films are a perfect fantasy arena to process all that stuff. - Started developing a distribution company to distribute my own movies, and then that was the creation of "Iron Virgin" and "Stripper Land," of writing and directing and co-producing horror movies with our own company, to open the doors to bigger and better things. I always love photography because I can't paint. Basically I like to capture an image that looks like a movie still. When I was a child I had horrific nightmares a lot, and I was just constantly terrified. Kind of in my junior high years I just started to just try and find the beauty in it, and just watching horror movie after horror movie, and just got into the makeup, and just realized that it could be a very beautiful thing with such deep emotion, and just kind of went from there. - Horroregon.net -- which is a website for news, reviews, and interviews. But really it's just me finding a reason to get online and trying to collect up stuff. We will touch on national things if it's something that we find interesting or it comes to us, but absolutely, 100 %, specifically Portland, and Oregon horror. If you really wear your passions outwardly and pursue them, there's a large swath of the -- what you consider the average pedestrian, Oregeonian and Portlander, that will follow you, and will be enthused. - Scream is for horror lovers. If you are a fan of horror, you want to read our magazine. We cover classic horror from the early 1920s, right up to the present day. Measuring up to Fangoria is obviously a huge deal for us. They have got a long history -- even just the name itself carries such a cache. - What makes me Moviecynics.com unique is that, you know, we're kind of assholes. We tell it like it is, but we try and be constructive at least, especially when working with indy filmmakers. When it comes to Hollywood horror movies we'll terror those things apart. Especially if they're garbage, which a lot of them are. - I usually don't go into interviews unless I'm pretty convinced A) That I"m going to get something that the readers are gonna want, and B) It's kind of a personal thing, where it's like, I want to be enriched. I've turned down interviews with major horror stars because I didn't feel like I could learn anything from them. - Since launching MailOrderZOMBIE.com, I've had an opportunity to attend like the the Cripticon Horror Convention, Horror Hound Weekend in Indianapolis or Cincinnati as a fan, but also then as a podcaster covering it for my podcast. And then sitting in on panels as well. And it's been a lot of fun being able to flash my MailOrderZOMBIE.com business card and say, hey I'm with MailOrderZOMBIE.com, can I interview you? And then talk to people like Tom Savini, Ken Foree, you know, people that I looked up to growing up when I finally discovered horror movies full on. And be able to connect with them, and just thank them for their work. - I always look at interviews like first dates. You know, where on a first date you're with someone, you're going, tell me about your job. That's kinda what we're doing. And as long as you are interested and listen -- so often interviewers, I think, they're slaves to their notes and they're so busy preparing for the next prepared question that they're missing all this gold. - And they asked me, would I go and cover it, and speak to people, and get a feel for what horror conventions in the US Are like. In the UK, they tend to be a lot lower key than this. We don't have the same kind of madness. We don't have the same people in costumes. So it's been a crazy experience for me to be here this weekend, and just see the level of fandom, and just how much the bar has been raised in America. I pretty hard recently with Kate Beckinsale, I'll say that. Just because it's Kate Beckinsale, come on, and she smells amazing. I think I've got Elvira coming up, which is another one that you go -- do you want to talk to Elvira? Fuck yeah, I want to talk to Elvira, but after a while you go, oh I get it. There's this infrastructure in place. We're here to pimp your film. We're here to pimp your book. We're here to find some stuff about -- the reason that brought you to the table. - Nine times out of ten, I'm probably going to have way more fun with an independent horror film than a Hollywood horror film. The Hollywood horror film is catered to teenagers. - I don't care if you don't have a lot of money. Spend some time on your script developing your characters, and make them somebody that, you know, I want to be invested with. I want to spend time with these guys for, you know, 90 minutes, whatever long your movie's gonna be. - It doesn't quite resonate with people that grew up in the '80s, and early '90s, and '70s, watching just brutal horror movies that were entertaining, well done and well put together, but not designed to get as many people into the theater seats as possible. - If your characters aren't somebody that I'm going to care about, I'm not going to care about your movie, man. I don't care how big your special effects are, how bloody your special effects are. Give me some characters that I care about. - So you find this current run of PG-13 horror films that are just disposable, uninteresting, cookie cutter, formulaic. - And don't take advantage of me. Don't treat me like an idiot. I've watched a lot of horror movies, man. You know, I have certain expectations to be treated as an equal here, as a horror fan. You know, if you're making a horror movie, I assume you like horror movies as well, so let's go on this journey together. Don't talk down to me, and don't give me something that you think I need to see because every horror movie has it. You know, I like nudity, whatever. I like the special effects, whatever, but give me a solid story and give me characters that I care about. - You gotta have the violence. I mean, tension goes a long way, but in the end you want that tension to lead up to some actual violence. You want to see the red stuff on the screen. I can probably count on my hand the amount of successful horror movies that, you know, had all that tension but didn't really have the violence, and within the last 20 years, you don't really see that very much. - I've always said that being a horror fan is kind of like panning for gold in a river of shit, because you go through a lot of crap. - My name is Nowal, and I love horror films because when I was about three years old, my family was watching "Hell Raiser 2" in the basement. - I really enjoy the blood, guts, and gore aspect of it. The fact that it always made my mom scream whenever certain things happened, and I kind of got a sick little thrill out of that. - I remember watching "Hell Raiser" when I was far too young to be watching "Hell Raiser." - And I love the hooks impaling the man's flesh towards the end. - I went downstairs and hid behind the couch and watched "Hell Rasier 2." Nobody noticed I was there until the movie was over, and at one point I just imagined something happened and was like, oh shit! And then my family's like, oh OK. Number one, you're three, don't swear. Number two, you're three and it's like 11:00 at night, why aren't you in bed, but I remember seeing pinhead for the first time at three, and instead of being afraid of him, I was like in awe of just this character. It was the first horror icon, as pinhead, that I saw, and I fell in love with horror movies at three years old from his performance. So I think if I ever got the chance to meet Doug Bradley I would probably pass out. Just that excited. - I mean, I've been told I'm the greatest actor who ever lived, which I've been told. So take a backseat, James Mason, Marlon Brando, the rest of you. Numero uno. I mean, that's nuts. My name is Doug Bradley. I am best known, particularly at horror conventions for having played Pinhead in the "Hellraiser" series. I've also done a ton of other movies, TV work, stage work. I wrote a book even. I was a fan of horror movies as a teenager, before I knew I was going to be an actor. And when I became an actor I didn't have any particular ambition to work in the genre, so the two have come together quite happily. When I first started doing the conventions, I was slightly freaked out by mom dad, and the kids coming to my table. And the parents will be saying, oh he loves your movies, and I'm looking at him and he's like seven years old, and I, you know, not really comfortable with that. But I now have so many people come to my table who are clearly entirely together and, you know, rational, calm human beings who encountered these movies when there were 6, 7, 8 year olds. The evidence of 20 years of coming to conventions is telling me that it doesn't really, you know, OK people will have nightmares fora couple of months, a couple of weeks, a few nights, whatever. But nobody seems, to me, to be permanently scarred or damaged. - I'm really excited -- I got two VIP tickets to Crypticon for my birthday. I get to meet Doug Bradley -- Pinhead, in all of the most important "Hellraiser" films. When I meet Doug Bradley, I'm pretty sure I'll have the most enormous nerdgasm in the history of ever. I'm gonna be nervous -- I already am nervous to meet him. I honestly don't know what I'm going to do. It's one of those moments where like, don't be a freak. Just do not be a freak. - I walked around a little bit, saw some awesome movie posters. Then I turned a corner and there was Doug Bradley, and I freaked out. I had to walk away. I couldn't handle myself. So I turned the corner, and there was Dee Wallace. And again I had to keep walking. I'm still freaking out. Like honestly, freaking out. And it's gonna be even more when I go back to actually meet Doug Bradley. It was awesome. I'm really proud that I didn't vomit, because I though that was gonna happen. And I showed him my tattoo, and he translated it himself. Wow. - He didn't ask what it meant. He's like, wait -- do I look like someone who cares what God thinks? In Latin. That's amazing. I was like -- and then I told him that I've been a fan since I was three, and so we shared stories about things like, you remember watching it at three? And I was like, yeah. How could I not? It was "Hellraiser." My friend Brinn, that does my tattoes can photocopy the signature and tattoo it on me when I get home. 'Cause I'm definitely planning some kind of Hellraiser-themed tattoo now. I have been for a while, but now it's official. It's gonna happen. My experience at Criptocon has been great so far. I'm gonna try and make it back next year. See who else is here. It's really fun. I had a lot of -- I'm gonna have so many stories to tell. I didn't vomit! - Hold on one second, I'm going out of frame, but I'll be right back. I still say it's the standard that CGI effects, though helpful, though cost effective, will never replace good, crafted, animatronics and makeup effects. - Hello! So it was a six-piece application. There was like one piece that was here, then cheeks, including around the ears. Neck. From the eyes, up here, and then another piece over the back of the head. It did get simplified to a two-piece application later. The nails, preset in the latex. So as the pieces get glued on to my head, the nails go on. So when people ask me, did it hurt? Did you really have nails banged in your head? I say, yes I did. I have very good healing flesh. And I'm sponsored by Tylenol. - I started modifying masks when I was little. I would take masks that I had around the house, or that I got really cheap, and paint them, and cut them up so they would fit my face better. And try and hot glue them, and random things like that. - I also just had a fascination with monsters, as a young boy, who wouldn't? It kind me to mask making when I got older, and get into some special effects hobbies, I guess you could say. Nothing too professional, but a lot of fun. I have, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein, and Dracula. And on my back I have the Bride of Frankenstein. - My name is Dutch, and I'm a professional face and body artist. The piece I'm working on right now is gonna be, sort of, a corset made out of human body parts all stitched together. It's a step by step process where you have kinda layer things on, and detail it out as you go, and then the finishing touches kind of all comes together, and you get your finished product. - I started out as a makeup artist back in, I guess about 1989/1990 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. I started doing make up for the film school that was there at the time. And the very first "Final Destination," I was the effects designer. And I've also done a slew of Sci-fi Channel Network, you know, creature of the week type movies. Many of those. The last say, 3 or 4 years, I've been teaching makeup effects, as well as writing and directing my own feature films. - I'm just going for patches of skin, and eventually I'll paint the Lisa's on there -- do some others texturing with the skin, and stuff like that. And it will look really sharp when it's all done. - I think what makes it New Image College of Fine Arts different than any other school in North America, basically is the fact that we actually make feature films at the school that end up being distributed. So we specialize in horror movies, monster movies, and the acting department -- the acting students get to act in the feature film, and the makeup department does the make up. My favorite special effect that I've done would be working on David Cronenberg's "Existence." I was in Toronto for about six months. Cronenberg is my, you know, my filmmaking idol. I mean, being fellow Canadian, Cronenberg is God to me. So to work on that, and have him coming around while I'm sculpting one of the little amphibious creatures, and he'd come by and say, oh that's cool, you know, I love what you're doing. I'm just like, oh! I'm in heaven, you know? - Our school is handing out a crap ton of money and scholarships, so we sponsored this. And it was just a chance to kind of, you know, see some of the talent south of the border, and you know, find some people that might be interested. You know, 'cause a lot of people don't really know where to get started in this industry, or how to get started. So, you know, it's just education really, is why we put this on, and it gives ever body else a chance that loves this sort of stuff to try their hand at it. - They typically give everybody an identical kit, and then they usually have some sort of mystery ingredient. So they want you to do different stuff. With this one, it was more theme based. They wanted beauty, as well as, you know, a beast. So it was the beauty and the beast was the theme, and I just wanted to personally deviate from the zombie stuff. You know, I mean everyone can slap blood on people, and make them all gory, and make a zombie, but I wanted to go in a different direction. What I'm hoping to get from this, I want a little bit more in-depth knowledge about what I'm working with, so that I can take my skill set to the next level. - I love Tom Savini. He will always be Sex Machine in my heart. I'm sorry, I've always wanted those pants. - I did stumble across a documentary called "Scream Greats Volume One," from Fangoria. It's about Ton Savini, and that became my entry into a lot of modern zombie effects, makeup effects, and things like that. - When people think horror, that's one of the main names that comes to people's minds. - I got so scared watching movies when I was a kid, that I decided I wanted to -- I wanted to scare people. I still have that. I still have to scare people. I scare my daughter at home, you know, constantly. My grandson, who's 9 years old. It's a thrill. It's a thrill. It's the same thrill. I mean why do you go to the amusement park and have somebody strap you into a machine and shoot you up into the sky. You pay for that. Just like you pay to go see a horror movie. The movie "A Man Of A Thousand Faces." I saw that movie when I was 11 years old, and that was it. From that day on I wanted to be the guy that creates the monsters. Before that, I thought they were real. You know, and they were real. And that magic is gone forever, you know, once you get behind the camera, you know, behind the scenes. That's the sad thing. That's the irony that most kids don't realize. They want to be involved in movies for the magic that some -- the saw, but it kills the magic forever, as you know. Yeah. The only two movies that have scared me were "The Exorcist" and "Alien," you know. 'Cause so many times you go to see a movie and you're thinking about camera angles, and you know, what the directors choices for making. You didn't have to time in those movies. You were just getting too scared, you know? Plus I was raised a Catholic, and it hit a nerve, you know? - I'm into tattoos. But yeah, I have a lot of friends who get a whole series from a horror movie. Like a full sleeve. - Halloween's my favorite holiday, so a lot of the tattoos are based on that. Like this whole sleeve is like Halloween- based, but there's like a little kid right here, and he's got like dream clouds around him, so it's basically all supposed to be like a nightmare. On this arm, I've got a couple of Vincent Price portraits holding a portrait of me as a kid zombie with my brains out. - I like to refer to my look as horror punk. A lot of people call me goth. My tattoos -- my favorite one being my Elvira. And then I have my interpretation of Gage and Church from "Pet Cemetary." And then, this is just my own design of just a Halloween. - I m on my neck I'm gonna have two zombie hands eventually, like tearing my throat open. - People get horror tattoos because it's something that's easily relateable They can relates to the monsters themselves, and they have -- it's great art. Depending on whether you're doing a realistic tattoo or not, it's pretty much -- you take the portrait of the actual tattoo, and you take a picture and then you make a stencil from that, and lay it on the person so it's directly the same thing. Unless you're doing a custom drawing of the tattoo, and then you're making a stencil for that. The loyalty of horror fans is staggering. - Attracts a highly intelligent fan base who are willing to do the research work. You know, drama fans are or even action fans are. They're willing to do it. They're fiercely loyal. Underestimate them at your peril. - People treat you differently 'cause, you know, you can kind of sense that you're like a die hard horror fan, and then that scares them. - People like to be scared because, I mean, they know their lives aren't in danger when they're in a theater, when they're in a haunted house, you know? They freak, but then they kind of laugh about it at the same time. - It reflects a whole lot of what happens to us in real life, but it's also a huge bit of escapism. It's more or less the mystery that scares me. If it's something that's gory and right in my face, I can already see it. I know what it is. I know what I'm dealing with. When I don't know with -- - Our idea of horror itself is deeply based psychological. We all have a fight or flight response. - But I think it's almost therapeutic. I really do. I mean, I look at myself and think back -- even in my youth, why did I watch horror? I think I had certain fears of inhibitions, and some how, on the screen, it all played out for me. - I think the true horror for any of us is the fear we have within ourselves. - The blood and guts stuff, it's like that's nice, but it's not really so much what is frightening. What's frightening is not really understanding what's going on. - It became very tangible and doable. I could watch it unfold. Problems being solved, monsters being resolved. You know? I think it's very, very healthy. I really do. - And I like good versus evil, and that's what they're all about. [ Birds chirp ] [ Up-tempo music plays ] [ Water running ] [ Clicking ] >> You guys want to eat eggs? >> You got food? Filming. My name is Chris, and I grew up just outside of New York City. This is Zach, and he's a close friend of mine from Seattle. We've grown up with very similar lives. These are the houses we were born in. Our families. the awkward middle-school phase. The sports we played. and these are the things we did for fun. I met Zach during my first year at college, and we quickly became close friends. Our lives are fast-paced, and these are the things that we're used to seeing every day. [ Atm whirring ] [ Horns honking ] [ Atm beeping ] This is chino. He is 12 years old and lives in a rural village in Guatemala. He lives in extreme poverty, on less than one dollar a day. How can we begin to understand what his life is like, about what it means to live every day with no clean water, little food, and poor shelter? And just like chino, there are over 1.1 billion people around the world that survive on one dollar a day. Zach and I study international development in school, but there are some things that a textbook just can't answer. So we're creating a plan to spend our summer living on only one dollar a day in a rural Guatemalan village -- in chino's village. Okay. Bye, mom. I love you. Muah! I mean, I think it's just an amazing opportunity to learn for myself what it really means to live under a dollar a day. which, coming from this reality, I can't really say I have any idea. I love you. >> I love you, too. >> I'll see you. We're bringing along two filmmakers. And setting out to better understand the reality of extreme poverty firsthand. Let's do this. [ High-pitched voice ] Hello! [ Whooshing ] [ Mid-tempo music plays ] We're beginning our journey in Guatemala city with a six-hour ride on the back of a crowded chicken bus. We are headed to the village of peña blanca that's representative of rural poverty in many parts of the world. In these remote areas of Guatemala, 7 out of 10 people live under the poverty line. [ Breathing heavily ] Is that -- are you hitting stuff there? >> Well, I think we've got a boundary of, like, a big rock right here, so this might have to be our edge. Sweet. >> Maybe it can be chipped away. >> Yeah. It can. Okay. >> Why is it going out like that? You're pulling it too hard. >> Pulling it too hard? No. [ Chuckling ] Sadness. >> Right. We're getting everything. Eight weeks of this is going to be pretty intense I'm not going to lie. [ Both laugh ] >> Oh, God. I cannot believe it came together this is so one of those ideas that we'd talk about and never do. Well we're here. Audio recording. >> Filming, filming. >> [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] >> [ Chuckles ] >> Well. [ All chuckle ] >> We're here in the rural highlands, in the small village of peña blanca. There are about 300 people living here, most of whom are Mayan. >> Most of the people only spoke a Mayan dialect called Kaqchikel, and it was impossible to learn. [ Both speaking Kaqchikel ] We want to live as close as possible to the reality of poverty, so we're replicating a few key aspects of it. Our budget for the trip is one dollar a day each, for 56 days. But instead of giving ourselves one dollar every day, we're making our income unpredictable. This way, we do not know when we'll get paid. We're doing this because many of our neighbors are employed informally as day laborers or farmers, so they never know when they'll get paid or how much they'll make. We're simulating this by taking our total budget of one dollar a day each and splitting it into random numbers between zero and nine. Then, every morning, we'll pick a number out of a hat. If we pick a nine, we make nine dollars that day. >> Pulled a nine. >> No way! You got a nine? >> Or it's a six. >> That's a nine, for sure. It's great, ain't it? >> Well-picked. >> Dude. He's good. A second aspect of poverty we want to simulate is the process of starting our own business. So we're taking out a loan of $125 to pay for somewhere to live and for a plot of land to grow radishes on. Our small loan is part of a service for the poor called microfinance. Zach and I have heard both good and bad things about these banks but wanted to see firsthand if they were helping in peña blanca, both from our neighbors and by taking out a loan ourselves. This means that, every 15 days, we'll have to pay back small installments of $6.25, or else have to default on our loan. [ Camera shutter clicking ] What would you say? >> I mean, we've got 1,312 quetzales. That's pretty decent. >> That's how much we have left, yeah. So. >> Get a chick and sell some eggs. Yeah, I mean, out of that, we could get -- I mean, if we buy a chicken out of that, that's. Dude, we're not buying a chicken out of that. >> I think we should buy a chicken out of that. >> No, dude. Like, chickens don't, like, automatically lay eggs. >> [ Chuckles ] >> We don't have money for feed. And we can buy, like, fruit or anything else that's so much better for us. Okay, we'll research, dude. We'll research the chicken-egg complex. I will be so angry if our chicken doesn't lay eggs. >> [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Chuckles ] Hola. >> Is that really where we're gonna [Chuckling] get water from? Oh, dude, there's a bug in there. >> Sean, you should check this out. That's actually how much stuff is in there. Hey, we have a water source. >> [ Chuckles ] That was the whole point. >> Then we can't grow anything that's gonna finish by the time we leave. >> But if we can actually grow radishes, essentially, in time, does that sort of switch our idea back? >> Well, except for that I still don't know how to really grow radishes. >> [ Chuckles ] Yeah. >> Like, anything depends on the soil content, which we have no idea about. Like, it depends on how much fertilizer we need. You just need to know how to farm, and we just don't. I mean, we could wing it and try and hope that it works. >> Yeah. >> <i>¿diez?</i> <i>>> Ah. Diez. >> Sí. >> Ah.</i> <i>>> ¿Es muy caro? >> Muy caro. >> Yeah.</i> <i>Qué mala. >> ¿como así? >> Sí. Como así.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ] >> Gracias</i>don Carlos. >> [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Chuckles ] >> <i>Sí. Muchísimas gracias. Mm-hmm.</i> <i>>> [ Chuckles ] >> Oh, no. Oh!</i> <i>>> Oh! [ Speaks indistinctly ] Holy cow! Oh, man!</i> <i>>> Six. >> Hey. Gracias. >> De nada.</i> <i>[ Both chuckle ]</i> <i>>> [ Speaking indistinctly ]</i> <i>>> One of my questions was, were the people living in extreme poverty, like, really thinking</i> <i>about how they manage money, or was it this survival mode, and it's like just trying to scrape</i> <i>together anything they have just to feed their children? [ Horn honks ]</i> <i>[ Horn honks ]</i> <i>[ Both speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>[ Cash register dings ] [ Cash register dings ] [ Cash register dings ]</i> <i>[ Cash register dings ] [ Chicks chirping ] We can't buy that.</i> <i>Firewood is probably the most expensive thing that we were buying in our budget.</i> <i>But we are living on the line, on the edge, always, of being able to drop into a really bad</i> <i>situation. [ Cash register dings ] >> A little bit bumpy, too.</i> <i>>> Whoa! Ooh. >> [ Chuckles ] >> Ooh.</i> <i>>> [ Sighs ] >> All right.</i> <i>>> [ Blows ]</i> <i>[ Slurps ] Ahh! >> This is the best thing I've</i> <i>ever eaten. [ Chuckles ] [ Pencil scratching paper ]</i> <i>1 pounds of black beans gives us 1,600 calories. 1 pounds of yellow rice gives</i> <i>us 2,000, roughly. But, still, like, 3,600 calories split amongst four people is not</i> <i>good enough for our daily</i> <i>value.</i> <i>>> [ Chuckling ] Yeah. >> Zach fell flat on his ass after.</i> <i>Every time we stand up, for some reason, like, get huge head rushes.</i> <i>I've almost passed out, like -- I don't know -- today probably like three times.</i> <i>And I don't know if that's a lack of nutrition or what the deal is, but Zach actually went</i> <i>for it today. We had our first full-on fall, and when he came to, he was only</i> <i>speaking in Spanish. [ Thunder rumbling ] >> I'm used to eating a lot.</i> <i>I'm used to being active a lot. But when you're not eating anything -- when you're eating</i> <i>like 500 calories, you become incredibly lethargic. You have zero energy to do</i> <i>anything.</i> <i>>> [ Speaking native language ]</i> <i>[ Girl giggling ]</i> <i>[ Machete chopping ]</i> <i>>> This is only my second week actually in peña blanca, and I feel like we're already showing</i> <i>signs of being worn down and dejected. We all have these pulgas.</i> <i>We all kind of got destroyed on our dirt floors. [ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>[ Camera shutter clicking ]</i> <i>>> And, you know, that was [Chuckles] that was the point where I was like, "I want to go</i>" <i>home. Like, I need to get out of here.</i> <i>"Why am I doing this?" And we were eating better than a lot of the people in the</i> <i>community.</i> <i>>> Jose enrico just brought us a gift.

[ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>[ Chuckles ] [ Indistinct talking in Spanish ]</i> <i>[ School bell rings ] [ Children shouting excitedly ] That was absolutely nuts.</i> <i>Did you see that madness? That was 315 kids playing with like 6 different balls at the</i> <i>same time. And I don't know. What's up, Carlos?</i> <i>And I don't how many games and, like, snacks were distributed, but that was nuts.</i> <i>That was nuts. How fun. Yeah. How fun. [ Both speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> We really didn't know who he was, initially, that he was kind of just the kid that was</i> <i>always around. And he was just, like, so eager to learn.</i> <i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ] How. >> Are you?</i> <i>>> Pssh! Hi. It turns out chino's family</i> <i>couldn't afford the $25 cost of books and supplies for school. >> They had a family of eight</i> <i>that lived in a single room. They no longer had electricity, because they couldn't pay for</i> <i>it. You know, his father never knew when he was gonna work or not,</i> <i>'cause he worked as a day laborer. And chino, who is 12, had to</i> <i>work in the fields.</i> <i>We'd see him coming, walking up the Mountain with this thing wrapped around his head and,</i> <i>like, a huge bundle of, like, logs and sticks behind him. At one point, Chris asked</i> <i>chino, like, you know, "if you could do anything, what would you be?"</i> <i>And chino's response was, you know, "I'm gonna be a farmer." And Chris was like, "no, like,</i> <i>what would you be if you could be anything? " And, I mean, he was like, " I'd</i> <i>be a pro soccer player." But at 12 years old, chino had accepted the fate that he was</i> <i>gonna be a farmer.</i> <i>>> [ Speaking native language ]</i> <i>>> Chino, like most of the people here, speaks Kaqchikel and only a few words of</i> <i>Spanish. >> [ Speaking Spanish ] >> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>[ Speaking indistinctly ] >> Aguacate. >> Aguacate.</i> <i>¿O? >> En inglés, e</i>avocado. >> Avoca-- avocado. <i>Sí. >> Avocado. >> Both: Avocado.</i> <i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> Food. >> [ Speaking Spanish ] Ik?</i> <i>>> Ik. >> Both: Ik. Ik. [ Both speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> Both: Candle. >> Candle. >> A candél.</i> <i>>> Candél. >> Yeah, I mean, I think I completely saw myself in a lot</i> <i>of them. You know, I was, like, eager to learn, where you're, like, so</i> <i>excited about building little things outside of our house, and, you know, that's</i> <i>what I did for my childhood, and realizing that it is the situation that they're in</i> <i>that's holding them back, not</i> <i>who they are.</i> <i>>> Hey. ¿cómo estás? >> How. >> How are you?</i> <i>>> How are you? >> How are you? >> "How. are. you?"</i> <i>[ Rooster crows ] The rában</i>are growing. >> I know. I'm gonna pay off on my finance loan. >> [ Sniffs ] I'm gonna eat more. >> [ Chuckles ] >> It's gonna happen, man. I can sense it already. >> [ Chuckles ] >> Very clumpy, though. They are really clumpy. That's bad, right? Everything about a banana just brings me joy here. You peel it back. It's naked. It's a naked fruit. >> [ Speaks indistinctly ] >> I just take a bite and savor it each time like it's the best bite of banana I will ever take, every single time. I just make sure, like, the top of the banana is always even after. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like, your teeth marks kind of indent it like this. Yeah. >> So then you got to play the game and, like, reverse the bite. >> Oh, nice. Yeah. Move it up. >> So that it's even, you know? And it slows down your eating, too. As economics majors, Chris and I were really interested in, how did a person living under a dollar a day manage their money? >> So we were asking people questions like, "how much money do you make? What are your expenses?" Where do you save money? Do you have any outstanding loans?" You know, these are really personal questions for anyone. >> <i>Hola. Buenas tardes.</i> <i>>> Hola. Buenas.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ] >> Anthony, in, I think, the first week we were there, he</i> <i>was, like, the first grown-up from the community to come to our house, introduce himself.</i> <i>You know, he was so excited to</i> <i>meet us.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> [ Chuckles ] [ Grunts ] [ Chuckles ]</i> <i>Ah. See? >> Just 24 and 20 years old, Anthony and rosa already manage</i> <i>a household of eight people. >> Mm. >> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>[ Baby coos ] >> [ Chuckles ] >> Oh.</i> <i>>> No? [ Baby crying ] >> [ Chuckles ]</i> <i>As a family, they survive on $1.25 each per day to pay for not only food, but larger costs</i> <i>of a new baby, their kids' education, and repairs to their house.</i> <i>>> Like, his wife is 20. I'm 20. And she has three children.</i> <i>>> His wife's younger than me, dude. >> He's 24.</i> <i>>> I look up to her so much. [ Both speaking Spanish ] They're teaching us how to more</i> <i>efficiently make fires. cook more substantive food. And better bargain in town.</i> <i>Living so close to the edge, these small changes are having huge impacts on our lives.</i> <i>Probably the most important one is lard. We bought some straight lard</i> <i>today in town to try to add to our fat content. If you could feel this texture</i> <i>right now, it is one of the foulest things ever. [ Sizzling ]</i> <i>This lard right here has -- what was it -- 208 grams of fat and 1,080 calories, which is the</i> <i>equivalent of more than the rice or beans that we were eating. >> And we started mashing our</i> <i>beans and refrying our beans in lard. It's so good in the stomach.</i> <i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ] In our third week, they invited us over to their home for a</i> <i>small snack. But when we arrived, they were preparing the traditional meal</i> <i>of pulick, served only twice a</i> <i>year for special occasions.</i> <i>[ Both chuckle ] >> Oh! Oh! >> ¿sí?</i> <i>>> Sí. >> Claro. >> Claro.</i> <i>>> Mmm. >> Sean, you can sit down. >> Yeah.</i> <i>>> He wants to say a few things to the camera. >> Oh. Sí.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> Muchísimas gracias a mi hermano. >> Yes.</i> <i>[ Chuckles ] >> Our desire to repay Anthony and rosa, not only for the</i> <i>expense of the incredible food but also their generosity, is overwhelming.</i> <i>They have so little, yet they're willing to give so much. We all agreed that, somehow, we</i> <i>will save the money to cook them a pulick dinner before we go.</i> <i>>> We have like 60.</i> <i>It's only three days.</i> <i>We can just decrease our amount. We can get like, you know, a pound and a half.</i> <i>I mean, I don't think we even really need to dip into our savings that much.</i> <i>>> Yeah. >> .At all. >> That would be awesome.</i> <i>>> If we just want to, like, not eat very much. >> [ Shivers, sniffles ]</i> <i>[ Rooster crows ]</i> <i>>> I drew a low number today, so we're having some. Struggles with how we need to</i> <i>pay Anthony's family back and also pay off our loan, which is due in three days.</i> <i>So.</i> <i>>> We drew really low numbers for four days. I pulled four numbers in a row,</i> <i>and two of them were zeros, and two of them were ones. So amongst the four of us, we</i> <i>had 12 cents a person to live on, per day. And, you know, we woke up, and</i> <i>it was market day, and we literally have no money for food.</i> <i>>> Open the other one now.</i> <i>[ Hinges squeak ]</i> <i>So this is a big pull we need a minimum a two or higher</i> <i>if we get a one no bananas if we get a zero</i> <i>we have to go talk to Anthony and take out a loan from him.</i> <i>>> Let's see it. >> It's a nine. >> No way!</i> <i>>> No! >> [ Chuckles ] >> Yeah!</i> <i>>> Seany boy! >> Dude, you're the clutchest puller in the world!</i> <i>>> [ Giggles ] >> It's a mosh pit! >> Whoo!</i> <i>>> Yes! >> Oh, my God! >> Dude, so huge.</i> <i>>> Bananas for everyone! >> [ Chuckles ] >> We got lucky and pulled a</i> <i>nine. But what if you're out of food and you don't know the next</i> <i>time money will be coming in? How do you choose between feeding your child or keeping</i> <i>them in school?</i> <i>[ Water splashing ]</i> <i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> Both: Sí.</i> <i>>> Both: Sí.</i> <i>>> It's. >> Day 28. Right? Day 28? >> Day 28. Yeah.</i> <i>>> We had started to do these really amazing interviews around the fourth week.</i> <i>And Chris and I spoke Spanish, so we were understanding everything that was going on,</i> <i>and, you know, we had started to be affected by these stories, but Ryan and Sean</i> <i>didn't speak Spanish. And they were talking, and they were like, "when you finally</i>" <i>deal with learning how to survive, it's not so bad." >> No problem -- it's not that</i> <i>hard, you know? We're halfway through. I could do this for another, you</i> <i>know, two years. >> I just got really angry and upset because, clearly, the</i> <i>people we're around, you know, they had learned to survive. But it wasn't okay.</i> <i>And it wasn't easy for them, and they had to, like, work so hard every single day, and they</i> <i>couldn't follow their dreams, because they couldn't go to school, and 'cause they had to</i> <i>provide for their family. And Chris and I were so involved with this research that we</i> <i>weren't sharing what was going on. >> What were some of the</i> <i>questions in general? I mean, I guess I don't really even know what you guys were</i> <i>asking. >> We started getting into where all their income was coming</i> <i>from and, you know, like, what skills they use to work and what they really deal with to find</i> <i>money in emergencies, and, you know [Chuckles] their lives are so much more complicated than</i> <i>our initial interviews showed. >> Even something as simple as what you cook with is important.</i> <i>A broken stove or cooking over an open fire can have dramatic effects on the health of a</i> <i>family, especially on the kids.</i> <i>[ Baby crying ]</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ] >> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</i> <i>It's incredibly hard to save up a large amount of money for a cooking stove, but Anthony</i> <i>did it with 12 of his friends by using an innovative idea called a savings club.</i> <i>Together, they each decided to save $12 every month. And at the end of each month,</i> <i>the total sum of $144 would be randomly distributed to one of the members.</i> <i>This process then repeats itself until each person has benefited from a large sum of</i> <i>money at a single time. >> And that large sum of money was much more useful to them</i> <i>because they could take that money and spend it on a big-ticket item like a stove or</i> <i>maybe pay for a wedding. And, you know, that's really innovative.</i> <i>[ Camera shutter clicks ] And we started talking about how close this community was, and we</i> <i>hang out with chino every day. And his mom, this past year, got really sick, and they don't even</i> <i>have enough money to, you know, get a car to go to the hospital in town, and Anthony covered the</i> <i>entire thing.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ] >> And Anthony actually paid for them to go to the hospital.</i> <i>He paid for the doctor's visits. >> And the medicine. >> And the medicine.</i> <i>>> Anthony can afford the loan because he's the only one in the village who has a formal</i> <i>job.</i> <i>Unlike everyone else, he can count on getting a regular paycheck.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> And while Anthony did help these other people, like, that's still a huge strain on their own</i> <i>finances. Yeah, that's where, like, if there was an institution willing</i> <i>to take on that risk and lend to someone like chino's parents, you know, then they don't have</i> <i>to put a strain on Antonio. >> And, you know, not everyone has that community around them</i> <i>or the people they can go to in times of need. >> Hola.</i> <i>>> And, you know, and that was something that -- >> hola.</i> <i>>> Hola. >> Hola</i>chino. >> Chris. [ Chuckles ] What's up, chino? >> Zach, <i>hola. ¿cómo estás?</i> <i>>> Bien. Bien. >> How are you? >> [ Chuckles ]</i> <i>Qué bueno. Good. I am good. >> You look nice.</i> <i>>> How are you? >> How are you? >> Good.</i> <i>>> Sí. Bueno. So, yeah, not everyone has, you know, such a tight-knit</i> <i>community around them. >> So, if you have an emergency like chino's parents here, like,</i> <i>what are you gonna do if you don't have that person right next to you or you don't have</i> <i>the emergency funds or that community to rely on? >> That's true.</i> <i>>> Actually, temple is pretty sick at the moment. He's got a little bit of an</i> <i>upset tummy.</i> <i>This is just going to make me vomit. >> [ Chuckles ]</i> <i>>> At one point, I had both giardia and E. Coli at the same time, and, you know, that's no</i> <i>good, especially when you only have two pairs of boxers and you're sleeping, you know, on</i> <i>the same mat, sharing a blanket with someone next to you. >> I think Chris is really sick.</i> <i>I just heard him get up. It just doesn't sound like he's doing very well.</i> <i>>> Dude, I think I have that like sulfuric burp thing happening again.</i> <i>[ Burps loudly ] [ Breathes deeply ] Like, I can't even push on my</i> <i>stomach. [ Breathes deeply ] I can't sleep another night like</i> <i>this. >> We're gonna go get Chris tested for some bacterial</i> <i>infections and see if he has a parasite, or, hopefully, it's just a stomach thing.</i> <i>>> Today, in town, we found out that Chris has some parasites in his stomach.</i> <i>>> It's called giardia -- giardia, I believe. And it's, like, lmng in my</i> <i>small intestine in here. And it causes, like, excessive bloating and stomach pressure.</i> <i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ] >> Doscientos quetzales. >> The medicine is 200</i> <i>quetzales. So even if people could afford to get tested, it's incredibly</i> <i>expensive to actually get the medicine. >> There's no way we could pay</i> <i>that cost. I have to use medicine that we brought in case of emergency.</i> <i>[ Siren wailing ] If we can't budget for a simple sickness, what will we do in</i> <i>the case of a more serious problem? Just two months before we</i> <i>arrived, hurricane Agatha smashed through Guatemala. >> Disaster workers in Guatemala</i> <i>say at least a dozen people are dead. >> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ] >> [ Speaking Spanish ] >> The tropical storm Agatha</i> <i>slammed into its pacific coast</i> <i>Saturday.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> If you've lost everything, how do you get the money to get back on your feet?</i> <i>How do you begin building a lump sum to start a business? We wanted to see if getting a</i> <i>loan from a traditional bank was even an option for our neighbors.</i> <i>>> Okay, so, you're gonna have to put the camera down initially, I think, unless you</i> <i>want me just, like, through the door and then put it down. >> Yeah.</i> <i>>> Buena, Buenas.</i> <i>We can't take photos inside. So, um. Are you, uh, going for the, uh,</i> <i>discreet film? >> Yeah. >> Yeah, sweet.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> Let's get out. Let's get out. Let's get out. Let's get out. >> That was highly illegal to be</i> <i>doing. So, I tried to see if we could get a 3,000-quetzale loan.</i> <i>And the problem is we need all of these other items. We need a receipt of our</i> <i>electricity bills. We need an N.I.T. Number, which she said costs a bunch of money</i> <i>to get. We need a copy of the amount of money we're making, which I</i> <i>don't think we can get if we have an informal job. Bills from the last three</i> <i>months, two people who will sign for us, and then we need to be able to sign our name, too.</i> <i>There's no chance we could get a loan from that bank. There's just no way.</i> <i>>> We visited rosa again to see if there were any other options.</i> <i>Grameen provides reliable savings accounts and loans designed to empower the poorest</i> <i>of the poor to improve their</i> <i>lives.</i> <i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>With a loan of just $200, rosa was able to start her own weaving business.</i> <i>>> It was so huge to see the potential for what even the simple access to credit can do</i> <i>in the lives of our neighbors, of our close friends. >> Ah, sí.</i> Oh. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Light laughter ] When a grameen borrower receives a loan, they also commit to opening a long-term savings account, a safe and a convenient way to build up a large sum of money. We found that beyond using a loan or savings account to start a business, our neighbors were using them to absorb shocks and make investments around the house. [ Speaking Spanish ] These financial services, such as microfinance, they go far beyond just providing extra capital. They really shape the family. And they have these side effects of empowering women. Finally, we have <i>rábanos. We have grown our rábanos. And now we have tons and tons of</i> <i>rábanos. >> What happened is there's an explosion of rábanos.</i> <i>>> Instead of selling our radishes, we're giving them out as gifts to thank the people</i> <i>we've interviewed. These radishes represent a new source of income for us, one</i> <i>that could move us closer to $2 a day. While that still doesn't seem</i> <i>like much, it would double our livelihood. >> And it's kind of those small,</i> <i>incremental changes that actually have such a profound effect on people that are lmng</i> <i>at that level.</i> <i>And, you know, I feel like that will have such an impact on the next generation of that family,</i> <i>that it's really there that we'll see progress out of poverty.</i> <i>[ Up-tempo music plays ]</i> <i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i> <i>>> So, after all of this research, we had saved up the whole time for this pulick</i> <i>dinner.</i> <i>It was just this amazing moment, and that was the last day that we were there.</i> <i>>> ♪ A little bit of Monica in my life ♪ ♪ a little bit of Erica by my</i> <i>side ♪ ♪ a little bit of Rita's all I need ♪</i> <i>♪ a little bit of Tina's what I see ♪ ♪ a little bit of Sandra in the</i> <i>sun ♪ >> we wanted to convey just, like, how appreciative we were</i> <i>of what they had done for us.

I really -- [ Dog barking ]</i> <i>>> [ Laughs ]</i> People living on alms at the time of the Revolutions were numbered in the millions. and the number of impoverished persons was greatest in the provinces considered the most fertile, because very few peasants owned land there. In Brittany, in three villages in the district of Carhaix, things were thus: Frerogan: 10 families well-off, 10 poor, 10 living by begging. Montref: 47 families moderately well-off, 74 less so, 64 families of poor and daily workers. Paule: 200 households to most of which the name beggar belongs by right. In Argentré, out of 2300 inhabitants who do not live by trade and industry, more than half live in destitution, and more than 300 are reduced to begging. In Bayeux in Normandy, of 1500 inhabitants of the parish of Saint-Patrice, 400 live on alms, and of the 500 in Saint-Laurent parish, three-quarters. The grievance book Marboeuf parish in the Eure laments that out of 500 inhabitants of this parish, there are about 100 beggars. In Vainville near Arles, of 130 families, 60 are impoverished. From the grievance book of the bailiwick of Douai we learn that of the 332 families in Bouvignies half live on alms. In Aix, of 143 families, 65 are destitute. In Landus, of 413 families, about 100 are totally destitute. The peasants of the village of Harville, in the Meuse, say that, for lack of work, a good third of them are beggars. In the seneschal of Puy-en-Velay, according to the notebooks of the local clergy, out of 120,000 inhabitants, 58,897 are incapable of paying any tax whatsoever. In the cities, it was no better. In Paris, of 650,000 inhabitants, 118,784 are destitute. In Lyon, there were 30,000 workers reduced to begging. In Rennes, one third of the inhabitants lived on alms, and another third were perpetually in danger of pauperization. The little town of Lourletaunier, in the Jura, was so poor that when the Constituent Assembly established the electoral census, out of 6518 inhabitants, only 728 were counted as active citizens. "Well-being for all on the basis of work" expresses the aspirations of the fraternity of common people of that time all too precisely. What they wanted, no one could say, until long after the fall of the Paris Commune of 1792, when Babeuf expressed it in a precise form. If the Commune, with its aspirations of fraternity, came too soon, Babeuf for his part came too late. THE PEASANTS WILL RISE UP That the Egyptian people have a tendency to support oppression is a myth propagated by colonialism which the history of the Egyptian people refutes. It is a continuous saga of violent revolts by working classes for thousands of years. In response to Western colonizers the urban and rural masses united against the French expedition led by Bonaparte: revolts in Cairo, armed peasant rebellions near Fowa., near Faraskur., near Manzala.; numerous revolts in Upper Egypt. When the French expedition withdrew and Mohammad Ali established a highly centralized regime, peasant revolts multiplied. South of Qena rose up an army of thousands of villagers which overthrew local representatives of state power and set up a true popular government. Put down by a military expedition, the revolt beg again two years later a little more south still near Luxor, and spread rapidly as far as Esna in the south and in the north as far as the gates of Qena. Numerous battles were fought against the legal troops. Remarkable victories were won. And the ferocious repression which descended on the region - villages sacked, burned, entirely destroyed, their inhabitants sometimes put to the sword - at first only reinforced the revolt. But in the end the central power prevailed and the rebels were massacred. Hardly a year after, another armed rebellion took place in the same region, against conscription, and at the same time and during the next 40 years revolts broke out in lower Egypt and as far as the gates of Cairo against conscription, against the unbearable taxes, and against the obligation to plant certain areas with rice on behalf of the state, though labor power was lacking to meet the immediate needs of the peasants. And a new revolt took place in Upper Egypt and Minya against the feudal bondage of the corvée. Ever since the beginning of the reign of Ismail, who opened Egypt to the English, by contracting an exorbitant national debt, thousands of soldiers with heavy artillery were needed to extinguish a revolt to the south of Asyut against the corvée and the obligation to work in the royal domains for less than the usual miserable wages. Several villages were set on fire and hundreds of peasants deported. And soon the central power lost its authority everywhere. The soldiers and tax collectors were greeted with gunfire; armed peasant groups left their villages and hid in desert hills, and harassed representatives of order; jacqueries broke out, particularly in the royal domains and those of the Turkish aristocracy. In the army, officered by Turks and Circassians, the patriots rose up in the revolt of Ahmed Orabi, crushed in Tel el-Kebir by British intervention which turned into permanent occupation. In 1919 came the revolution against the British occupation. The rural masses, disinherited and poor, were its principal force, multiplying the sabotage of lines of communication and organizing a great many clashes with the army of occupation. And the revolutionary, democratic objectives are tied to the patriotic objectives: embryonic forms of popular power came to light; armed revolts broke out against the big landowners. Workers, unemployed, students, shopkeepers, civil servants found themselves side by side all year long in the streets of Cairo and of most of the other big cities, in violent demonstrations of an amplitude unknown until then. The workers went on to engage in specific forms of struggle: occupation of factories and self-defense against the forces of repression. The repression would be completed by a gradual co-option of the mass movements by means of formal concessions to the national dignity. A constitutional monarchy was established in which the reformist bourgeoisie would be able to play a second-rate role. Great Britain no longer directly governed Egypt. During the thirties, peasant misery, enlarged by the after-effects of the world crisis, gave rise to a great many forms of violent resistance to seizure of lands or collection of debt. The peasants organized to surround the forces of order sent to their areas, to isolate them by cutting ways of communication and telephone wires, and burning their vehicles. Meanwhile in the big cities the patriotic movement began again against a British occupation which showed itself as real as before the establishment of the constitutional regime. New concessions were granted by the British, in exchange for new repression. From 1945 on, the national classes again revolting together finally made impossible the British occupation and the reign of foreigners and aristocrats who governed in its name. But it was the reformist petty-bourgeois forces sprung from the army who took the initiative of the coup d'état of 1952. Corruption ruled in all areas of the state, to Egypt's shame. The State has only one goal: the country's well-being. Therefore we leave these problems to government, with which our behavior and the interest of the people correspond. Finally I ask the proud people, to keep peace and trust in the future and the patriots. May everyone fulfill their obligations and try to reform themselves. May we may work together, to eliminate corruption and straighten out everything which is bent I call for unity by which the State's mission can be realised. The Almighty said: "God changes no people, unless that people change itself." He spoke true, the great God. It is God who leads us to good. And from 1955 to 1967 the mass movement would be dismantled and co-opted by a new ruling caste inheriting all the vices of the old and betraying the national dignity which had served its ascension. I have today ordered to Vietnam the air mobile division and certain other forces, which will raise our fighting strength, from 75,000 to 125,000 men, almost immediately. Additional forces will be needed later, and they will be sent as requested. This will make it necessary to increase our active fighting forces by raising the monthly draft call from 17,000, over a period of time, to 35,000 per month. <i>This is a rather important conception,</i> <i>both what's apt to happen in Chicago,</i> <i>and also what kind of a movement</i> <i>we're trying to build.</i> We're trying to contribute to a set-up, in which the energies of the anti-war movement can be unleashed or liberated. We're working for some kind of combination of planning and flexibility, which will on the one hand just avoid complete chaos. We have to establish a network for discussion and preparation that takes into account the possibility that you might want at the time of the Convention a very great outpouring of protest, or the other possibility that you might want protests to occur on a more moderate scale at the Convention and in other parts of the country. We believe that politics is the way you live your life, not who you support. It's not in terms of rallies or speeches or political programs. It's in terms of images <i>and in terms of</i> <i>transforming people's lives.</i> <i>We are coming to Chicago,</i> <i>at the time of</i> <i>the Democratic National Convention,</i> not to disrupt the Convention, not to confront the police, National Guard troops, or the men in the United States Army. But to challenge the policies of militarization that have been felt so strongly and brutally in Vietnam. We're going to invest our time, our semen, our love vectors, our intellect, in America, and we're not going to allow our country to become one of the fabled, damned nations to join the Mayan ruins and all the other violent civilizations that have been snuffed. <i>. just on the edge of the park.</i> <i>ABC's Don Farmer is there.</i> <i>Here come the cops. They're pushing</i> <i>this crowd back now.</i> <i>A big police van has now pulled into</i> <i>the intersection.</i> <i>Now here come the police.</i> <i>Step up here.</i> <i>Here they come.</i> <i>This is a real police charge.</i> <i>We're gonna get it. We're gonna get it.</i> <i>Now the police are clubbing</i> <i>this young man.</i> <i>Clubbing him. Now I see them club</i> <i>at least three young people.</i> <i>Now they're moving into the crowd</i> <i>and beating them with their nightsticks.</i> <i>There are a lot of young people</i> <i>on the ground now.</i> <i>There's another one that hit the ground</i> <i>and he's screaming.</i> <i>They're really letting him have it now.</i> <i>This is real violent. This is the worst</i> <i>it's been so far here in Chicago.</i> <i>Police running across here.</i> <i>There's another one that hit the ground</i> <i>and he's screaming.</i> <i>They're really letting him have it now.</i> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the government will prove in this case, the plan of the eight defendants, who encouraged people to come to Chicago during the Democratic Convention from August the 26th through August the 29th, 1968. Their plan was to bring people into Chicago to protest, and then create a situation where these people would riot. In doing so, the defendants crossed state lines with the intent to start this riot. Intent to incite, is that the key line? Intent to incite. Did you intend to incite? And it's not concerned. It's a state of mind trial. I mean, we're being tried for our thoughts. We're charged with carrying certain ideas across state lines. Not with carrying machine guns, or carrying little girls, or little boys, or any other kind of shit. We're charged with having a certain state of mind when we go from New York, into Pennsylvania, into Indiana, and then finally into Illinois. We hope to prove that the prosecution is the result of two motives on the part of the government. - Objection. - I sustain the objection. You may speak to the guilt or innocence of your clients, not to the motive of the government. Your Honor, I have always thought. Regardless of what you always thought, Mr. Kunstler, I sustain the objection. We hope to show that what actually happened in the streets of Chicago was not a riot caused by demonstrators, but a riot engineered by the police of this city. No one here is accused of actually committing a violent act. So, in getting the seven of us, they're very smart, 'cause they're getting seven of the people who, for the longest time, stubbornly kept talking about going to Chicago. We will prove that the defendants, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, and Thomas Hayden. Who is the one that shook his fist in the direction of the jury? That is Mr. Hayden. That is my customary greeting, Your Honor. We do not allow shaking of fists in this courtroom, sir. The defendants, Dellinger, Davis and Hayden, were the leaders of a group called the Mobilization. Their goal was to use the unpopularity of the war in Vietnam to lure young people to Chicago. This August, I'm going to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. I want the world to know that there are thousands of young people in this country who do not want to see a rigged convention rubber-stamp another four years of Lyndon Johnson's war. Join us. In addition to the Mobilization, there was another group that tried to lure people to Chicago. That group was led by Abbie Hoffman. The jury is directed to disregard the kiss thrown by the defendant, Hoffman. And another leader of this group was Jerry Rubin. They called themselves the Yippies. We feel that it was not only our right, but our duty to go to Chicago and do what we did. I will openly confess to everything that I did, and even to what they say I didn't do. It's a thrill because it's the Academy Award of protests. And I want to congratulate all the thousands of people who came to Chicago and competed for the honor. I don't know why they selected the eight of us, but we're very nervous and excited, and hope that we're equal to the task. Two more of these individuals are Lee Weener. Weiner. Lee Weener, and John Froines, joined with Davis, Dellinger and Hayden. The last person who joined is a man named Bobby Seale. We will prove that these defendants made unreasonable demands upon the city of Chicago for certain permits. Non-negotiable demands. We hope to show that the nightstick became the symbol of what demonstrators could expect who were demonstrating against the continuance of this bloody and unjustified war in Vietnam. We will demonstrate that free speech died here in the streets under those clubs, and that the bodies of these demonstrators were the sacrifices to its death. So you think you're going to get a fair trial? - If things work out right. - Yeah. Yeah, we'll get the usual fair trial, Chicago-style. They're building gallows on the third floor, you know. They got this little door going. Testing guys, testing these bags, and pulling ropes and shit. I don't know, some people say that that's a pretty pessimistic sign. All rise. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois now is in session. The Honorable Judge Julius J. Hoffman presiding. You should have seen that jury, that was some audience to play to, I'll tell you. It was out of the back pages of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal.</i> It was weird. Will you please identify yourself for the record? Of course I will, Len. My name is Abbie. I'm an orphan of America. Your Honor, may the record show it is the defendant Hoffman who has taken the stand? Well, it is rather important in this case. There's a Hoffman up here and one down there. I certainly wouldn't want the jury to get confused. We will concede, Your Honor. - When were you born? - Psychologically, 1960. - Objection. - Objection sustained. What? My background has nothing to do with my state of mind? Will you remain quiet while I'm making a ruling? - Mr. Feinglass. - Weinglass. Weinglass, yes. Will you please continue the examination of the witness? Now directing your attention to September, 1967. - What were you doing? - What was I doing? Well, I was doing a number of things. Among them was a meeting I had with the defendant Jerry Rubin. Jerry said that the problem with the peace movement is that it's based solely on the war in Vietnam. See, we feel that the war is not just an accident, it's a by-product of a capitalist system that we have in this country. He felt that we had to put forth new kinds of values to create a society in which a Vietnam War wouldn't even be possible. We've got to let Johnson and the Democrats know that we don't support their fucking war. We should go to Chicago and greet the convention of death with a demonstration of an alternative culture with alternative values. Right, while they're having politicians at the Convention Center, we'll have rock bands playing in the park. It'll be a coming-together of pot and politics. We'll radicalize every hippie in the country, man. The actions we've already taken, they've been exciting, alive, the best kind of guerilla theater. We have to create that same spirit in Chicago. Daley and Johnson will never let it happen, man. They're going to fucking lose it. That's the point! Don't you get it? We'll terrify the war machine and force LBJ to be nominated under armed guard! Yeah, but we need to have a name, you know, signifying the radicalization of hippies. Right? Okay. Now, what rhymes with hippie? Hippie. Bippie. Abbie? I think Paul just went into our bedroom. I think he may be having one of those brainstorms. Hippie, bippie, vippie, yippie, yippie. Holy shit, that's it! - Who do you want to give the letter to? - To the mayor. We want to give it to the mayor. And if the mayor won't receive it, we want the person - closest to him to receive it. - The mayor is busy. Okay, well, who would be the next in line to receive it? This is not a petition, this is a formal application for the use of Grant Park. No, you want this for the mayor to receive, don't you? You said he's in a council meeting - which is open to the public. - That's right. But you can't give it to him during a council meeting. - No, we won't. - This is his office right here. - We won't give it to him. - I know you won't give it to him. They won't even let you in there. Who's the spokesman here? - We all are. - We all are. Okay. Give it any place you want. - Yippie! - Yippie! Yippy-skippy. <i>We began negotiations</i> <i>with the city of Chicago,</i> back on March 25, 1968, with a meeting with the Parks Department, and Deputy Mayor Stahl. Your application is still under consideration, but the mayor doesn't have the power to grant permits. Are you fucking kidding me? Daley's the boss of Chicago! He makes all the decisions around here. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. But for many months we've been planning a Festival of Life with the basis of free music. What else do you plan to do besides demonstrate your music? Well, a dawn ass-washing ceremony, with tens of thousands participating, will occur each morning at 5:00 a.m., as Yippie revelers and protesters prepare for the 7:00 a.m. volleyball tournament. There will be public fornication, whenever and wherever there is an aroused appendage and a willing aperture. - Here, here! - Look, Dave, Dave, Dave, there's half a million Yippies coming to our festival, and they're gonna need a place to sleep, you got it? It has to be in the park, man. The hotels are all gonna be filled up with fucking delegates. I wasn't aware that your application says anything about sleeping in the park. That is simply not permitted. Where would you sleep anyway? Some of us will live in tents, others will live frivolously. You know what? I got a great idea, Dave. Why don't you just give me 100 grand and we'll call the whole thing off? What do you say? Now, you testified on the August 7th meeting with Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, that there was some mention of $100,000. Is that not correct? That is correct. Did you take that discussion seriously, Mr. Stahl? Yes, I most certainly did. Was that a betrayal of your friends to take a ransom? - A what? - A $100,000 ransom. I don't understand. A ransom? You mean to rip off this city for 100 grand? - Yeah. - It's a groovy thing to do. What, are you kidding? What are they gonna do with it anyway? - Would you have done it? - What? Would you have taken $100,000 to call everything off? I would have taken $100,000. As to calling it off, well. How much is it worth to you - to call it off? - Call off what? A million? Would you have done it for a million? - The revolution? - Yeah. - What's your price? - My life. At 7:10 this evening, Martin Luther King was shot in Tennessee. Martin Luther King, 20 minutes ago, died. <i>I issued a police order to shoot</i> <i>to kill any arsonists</i> <i>or anyone with a Molotov cocktail</i> <i>in their hand in Chicago.</i> <i>And to issue a police order,</i> <i>to shoot to maim,</i> <i>or cripple anyone looting.</i> <i>I remember seeing him, April 4, 1968.</i> <i>Martin Luther King had</i> <i>been assassinated.</i> <i>Riots all over the country,</i> <i>and LBJ came on, and he shed a tear,</i> <i>they got tricky make-up men to do</i> <i>that stuff, and he said,</i> <i>"My fellow Americans,</i> <i>in the memory of his name,</i> <i>"we must be nonviolent."</i> <i>And I put down a joint and said,</i> <i>"Holy shit, LBJ's a pacifist.</i> <i>I didn't know that."</i> Towards the end of next month, the scene below, in front of Chicago's Amphitheater will be one of surging crowds and hectic activity. The Democratic National Convention will be under way. But in addition to the delegates, and their guests, others, perhaps numbering in the hundreds of thousands, will be on hand also. And this may create some problems. <i>Two major dissident groups are</i> <i>planning to have their voices heard here</i> <i>Convention Week.</i> <i>The more militant of the two is</i> <i>the National Mobilization Committee</i> <i>to End the War in Vietnam.</i> <i>Its Chicago office is making plans</i> <i>to have upwards of 50,000 people here</i> <i>during the Convention.</i> We want to underscore again that we're coming to Chicago by the tens of thousands, whether or not there are any permits given. We are here to make a visible, militant, but peaceful presence. A political confrontation, but not a physical confrontation, in terms of Chicago. We expect this to be a peaceful, nonviolent demonstration, and whether or not it will be peaceful, it really is in the hands, at this time, of the mayor of this city. Why did you want the Convention to come here so badly? Because we have a great city. Will it be a good convention, Mr. Mayor? The best ever held. I am commanding general of the Emergency Operation Headquarters of the Illinois Army National Guard. <i>The Emergency Operation</i> <i>Headquarters was established</i> <i>for the purpose of controlling operations</i> <i>in the event of civil disturbances.</i> <i>We shall overcome</i> <i>We shall overcome</i> <i>Well, I think that it's quite clear</i> <i>that the city and the Democratic Party</i> is preparing for a police state and martial law during the week of the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Hoffman, why are the Yippies here? - Abbie. - Abbie, why are the Yippies here? <i>Since we're not a carefully</i> <i>structured organization,</i> <i>you'd have to ask each person.</i> <i>Everybody is allowed to do their thing.</i> <i>If some people storm the Amphitheater,</i> <i>they storm the Amphitheater.</i> Other people wanna smoke dope, other people wanna go and tell the cops what we're doing, that's good. If the cops wanna come down and beat our heads, that's it. I mean, it's all conceived as a total theater <i>with everyone becoming an actor.</i> <i>These people are revolutionaries bent</i> <i>on the destruction of the government</i> <i>of the United States of America.</i> <i>They're a pitiful handful.</i> <i>They have almost no support.</i> <i>But by golly, they get the cooperation</i> <i>of the news media.</i> <i>They're built into something really big.</i> They're referred to as kids, they're referred to as Yippies. Gentlemen, the hardcore leadership of this group are Communists. We're training people in the use of highly mobile defensive tactics that might be required in the eventuality of police violence. <i>There are some young people</i> <i>in the city practicing snake dancing</i> <i>and other techniques</i> <i>to stay up against the police.</i> <i>Does this disturb you in any way?</i> No, snake dances never disturb me. Did you have a conversation with Jerry Rubin in November of 1967? Yes. Mr. Rubin said that he was, at present, working full-time on plans to have a youth festival in Chicago when the Democratic Convention would take place. I was overtaken with the audacity of the idea and I said, "It's a beautiful and frightening idea." And Rubin said, "I think that the beauty of it is that the establishment "is going to do it all themselves. We won't do a thing. "They will smash the city themselves, they will provoke all the violence." And I said, "I think you're right. "But I have to admit to you that I'm scared at the thought of it." If people stay in the park and play the role of the good niggers, <i>they'll be okay, they'll be treated</i> <i>with respect by the police.</i> <i>But those Yippies that march</i> <i>on the Amphitheater or go downtown,</i> they'll be risking their lives. That's right. These cops here are tough. They'd kill you with a smile. We are not going out to fight the cops. I mean, we basically hope that this is going to be a nonviolent situation in this park. However, if the violence comes, we will soak it up. <i>There's a struggle going on</i> <i>in the world today,</i> <i>and it's a struggle about what</i> <i>the future of this country's about.</i> And young people are not going to stay neutral, they are going to be involved. In the face of repression, you either sit at home in fear, <i>or you accommodate by closing</i> <i>your eyes, or you fight.</i> And in this country, people are going to fight repression by any means they choose to fight. <i>They're not going to take over Chicago,</i> <i>and they're not going to</i> <i>take over any convention,</i> and they're not going to take over any streets. And that goes for all of them. And I don't care how many of them come here or where they come from. "Many of us may fight and die here. "We recognize this as the vision of the founders of this nation. <i>"We recognize that we are America.</i> <i>We recognize that we are free men."</i> Political pigs, your days are numbered. We are the second American Revolution. We are winning. Yippie. A Democratic Convention is about to begin in a police state. There just doesn't seem to be any other way to say it. And now, here's Yippie! Now what happened to Bobby Seale is. You know when we were all indicted, Bobby Seale was the eighth person indicted, which was really weird because Bobby was only in Chicago a couple of hours. But the government believes in integration, equality, and so, if it indicts seven, it's got to add on a black person. And what could be better than the national chairman of the Black Panther Party? Beautiful. You've got eight, perfect. Bobby Seale was in Stockholm, Sweden, when he heard he was indicted. He couldn't even remember what it was all about. There is a motion here of defendant Bobby Seale to be permitted to defend himself. I will hear you, Mr. Seale. Thank you, Your Honor. I want to present this motion on behalf of myself. I'm not a lawyer, but I do know that I, as one of the defendants, have a right to defend myself. Your Honor, the other defendants would like to join in this motion. I would like to call Your Honor's attention to <i>Adams v. The United States,</i> where the Supreme Court said, "The Constitution does not force a lawyer on a defendant." Mr. Seale has said that he does not desire to have me, or any of the other attorneys, represent him in any way. Motion will be denied. I should be allowed to defend myself. I will ask you to sit down. I should be allowed to speak so I can defend myself. - Be quiet! - Don't tell me to shut up. I got a right to speak. I need to speak in order to defend myself. Mr. Seale, I admonish you that any outburst such as you have just indulged in will be appropriately dealt with at the right time during this trial. I want to argue the point about this so you can get an understanding of the fact that I have a right to defend myself! Mr. Marshal, will you go to that man - and ask him to be quiet? - I want my constitutional rights. I want to have my constitutional right. How come you won't recognize that? Sit down and be quiet! - Hey, man. Come on! - Stop it! Come on! Now, go ahead, continue. I'll watch and get railroaded. <i>The Democratic National Convention</i> <i>opens in Chicago tonight</i> <i>as the political scenery is being shifted</i> <i>into place for the four-day stand.</i> <i>Why did you decide</i> <i>to come to Chicago?</i> Mostly because I felt that my presence in Chicago, even of one individual, might bring home to the delegates there just how wide and how extensive the problem is in America today. <i>I'm here for two reasons.</i> One, we're going to demonstrate against the war. Number two is just what it's called, the Festival of Life. I'm sure it's going to get much more difficult as the war goes on, but we just gotta keep on protesting until the war is ended, until this obscenity is finished. We need somebody to follow the orange curtain all the way down to the cafeteria. <i>It is now my honor to present to you</i> <i>the mayor of our host city,</i> <i>Richard J. Daley.</i> <i>Thank you, thank you very much,</i> <i>thank you.</i> <i>Honored guests, fellow Democrats.</i> <i>The people of Chicago and its mayor</i> <i>are proud to welcome</i> <i>a great political gathering of Americans</i> <i>who come here to shape</i> <i>the future of a nation,</i> <i>to choose a man to become</i> <i>our president.</i> - My fellow Americans. - That's us! Yeah! Have another great Democratic National Convention. <i>Democrats understand the imperative</i> <i>need for respect of the law.</i> <i>Every citizen knows that society</i> <i>can become a jungle.</i> All right, now I'm going to ask your opinion on the famous issues facing our country today. <i>But it is high time for the political</i> <i>leadership of this generation</i> <i>to reject the language</i> <i>of conflict and despair!</i> <i>Right now.</i> <i>Right now it's time to kick</i> <i>out the jams, motherfucker!</i> <i>Rock, rock, rock!</i> The issue of law and order? - Shoot to kill! Shoot to kill! - Shoot to kill! Shoot to kill! <i>And as long as I'm mayor of this town,</i> <i>there will be law and order in Chicago!</i> The aggressive war in Vietnam? - Negotiate with bombs! - Negotiate with bombs! The issue of rebellious youth? - Kill them! - Kill them! - Crush those motherfuckers! - Crush those motherfuckers! - Crush them! - Crush them! <i>At today's event,</i> <i>protestors clashed with police,</i> <i>and the first blood of the confrontation</i> <i>in Chicago was drawn.</i> Ten miles away, Convention Hall. "You came here to disrupt the Convention." They had 10 miles of barbed wire fence. They had 25,000 troops counting the cops and National Guard. They had tanks, armored tanks, in the streets of Chicago, National Guard with bayonets. They had helicopters with machine guns. "We came to disrupt the Convention." Out of sight. We couldn't find our way out of the park! <i>This is Lincoln Park in</i> <i>the city's swank Near North side.</i> <i>Hippies, Yippies, and just plain kids</i> <i>have wanted to sleep in this park</i> <i>during the Convention,</i> <i>but the city has repeatedly said no,</i> <i>and police have enforced that order.</i> <i>. for remaining in the park between</i> <i>11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.</i> <i>11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.</i> - <i>Please obey the law.</i> - <i>We're going to stay in the park!</i> - <i>Hello?</i> - Mr. Bob Fass? - <i>Yeah.</i> - I have a collect call for you. - Collect call! Yeah? - A collect call from Mr. Abbie Hoffman, will you accept the charge? Yes, we'll accept the charge, but would you like to say hello to anybody in New York, operator? - No, sir, thank you. - Thank you. - <i>Hey.</i> - Hey, Abbie. - Robert. - <i>Hi.</i> - Yeah, it's a chilly night here. - <i>Yeah?</i> Yeah, how are you doing, man? <i>Okay. How was it in court today?</i> Oh, it's unbelievable. I mean, our trial is a jewel. The judge, he's 74 years old. He was alive at the first and second Balkan Wars. I think he just missed going on the <i>Titanic.</i> Yeah, I think he's even beyond the generation gap. Are you sure you're not related to him? - No, no. - You're sure? The name. <i>I brought him a present though.</i> I heard he had tired blood and I bought him a year's supply of Geritol. Do you really think he'd take a thing like that kindly, Abbie? Giving him Geritol? Well, he has a bit of a sense of humor. He might think of it as an attempt to bribe him. - <i>No.</i> - I think you probably are relatives in some distant way, Abbie. In some distant way, yeah. In the great conspiracy, we're all sort of relatives. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the testimony the witness is about to give is offered by the government only with respect to the defendant Derringer. I think Your Honor means Dellinger. Dellinger, that's right. Mr. Dillinger said that, "We must issue a." I mispronounced the defendant's name. You said, "Dillinger." It's "Derringer." We're both wrong. You mean Mr. Derringer, do you not? Your Honor, it's Dellinger. Let's move on, shall we? Now, Mr. Pierson, taking you back to Monday, August the 26th. Did you have occasion to be in Lincoln Park that day? Yes, sir, I did. I was introduced to Jerry Rubin by someone I had befriended. He said, "Jerry, this is Bob Levin. He will be your personal bodyguard. "He can be trusted, and he handles himself well." Rubin shook my hand and said that he was glad to have me with him. And what occurred after this introduction, please? There was a commotion to the south of where Rubin and I were sitting. <i>We saw two men being placed</i> <i>in a police squadron.</i> <i>Rubin asked one of the people</i> <i>standing there what had happened,</i> <i>and they told him that Tom Hayden</i> <i>had been arrested.</i> <i>He told Rubin that a march</i> <i>was being formed to go down</i> <i>to police headquarters to free Hayden.</i> <i>What did you do then?</i> <i>Rubin and I joined the march.</i> <i>The march was called to protest</i> <i>the arrest of Tom Hayden</i> <i>who was accused of disorderly conduct</i> <i>for letting the air out</i> <i>of the tires of a police car.</i> <i>There were rumblings of the trouble</i> <i>to come all afternoon.</i> - Free Hayden! Free Hayden! - Free Hayden! Free Hayden! - Free Hayden! Free Hayden! - Free Hayden! Free Hayden! - Free Hayden! - Free Hayden! What do we want? - Revolution! - When? - Now! - Now! What do we want? - Revolution! - Revolution! <i>Now, when you arrived</i> <i>at the police headquarters,</i> <i>did you see any policemen in the area?</i> <i>did you see any policemen in the area?</i> <i>Yes, there were uniformed officers</i> <i>in front of the building.</i> <i>Rubin said, "There are too many</i> <i>pigs here, let's go to the Hilton."</i> <i>We went east on 11th</i> <i>to Michigan Avenue</i> <i>and then north on Michigan Avenue.</i> <i>When the march was midpoint</i> <i>past the Logan Statue,</i> <i>the crowd broke and ran up</i> <i>to the statue screaming, "Take the hill."</i> <i>You are in an assembly</i> <i>which you have no permit for.</i> <i>If you do not leave,</i> <i>you will be subject to arrest.</i> <i>Move it back!</i> <i>Move it back!</i> <i>Let them have their statue,</i> <i>let the pigs have their fucking statue!</i> <i>Forty thousand troops,</i> <i>their tanks, their mace, their artillery.</i> <i>Chicago has become</i> <i>a concentration camp</i> <i>and it is clear for everybody to see.</i> Mr. Pierson, what, if anything, happened after the incident at the Logan Statue? Rubin and I saw some people tacking newspaper articles on some trees. The first article showed a picture of a policeman with a club. Rubin looked at me and said, "Look at that fat pig. We should isolate one or two of those pigs and kill them." - And what did you say? - I agreed with him. Then Rubin looked at me and said, "We've got to do more to keep the crowd active. "We want them in the park for the Bobby Seale speech tonight." I object on the grounds that my lawyer is not here. You know my lawyer is not here, Your Honor. I want my lawyer here when he mentions my name and testifies against me. Ask him. Ask him to sit down, Mr. Marshal. Sit down, Mr. Seale. And what, if anything, occurred after this conversation? Two people walked up to us. One of them had a plastic bag. The man with the plastic bag said to Rubin, "We're going to fill this bag with human shit "and we're going to throw it at the pigs tonight." Rubin laughed and said, "Good, it will make good food for the pigs." I'm going to go into the whole thing. - Go ahead. - Do it. I got a lot of different emotions when I hear this guy Pierson. One is I feel like vomiting 'cause it's so nauseating. The second is I feel like laughing 'cause it's so funny. I mean, it's really hilarious. The guy's on a real fantasy trip. The third, I feel like crying because it's so dangerous. <i>Because this is the man</i> <i>that they're trying to use</i> <i>to put all of us in</i> <i>the federal penitentiary for 10 years.</i> <i>Back in the courtroom,</i> <i>defense attorneys told the judge,</i> <i>"We have certain information about</i> <i>the mental capacity of this witness."</i> <i>Pierson was then asked,</i> <i>"At any time have you ever been</i> <i>under treatment by a physician</i> <i>"for your mental capacity?"</i> <i>CBS News, Chicago.</i> When you went to Lincoln Park on the 26th of August, did you know that Abbie Hoffman was going to be there? No, sir, I didn't. Had you ever seen him before that time? No, I hadn't. Can you describe what he looked like when you first saw him? Not really, other than the wild hair, and the nose, which impressed me. - In which way did it impress you? - Its size. Mr. Rubin turned to his group and began to shout in a loud voice. - He used some profanity. - What did he say? "The pigs are in our park. They're MF-ers and shitheads." Were there any obscenities in his speech? Every other word was an obscenity, especially the four-letter word. You say, "Blank pigs." - Did he say, "Blank pigs"? - No, sir. Did he use another word other than "blank"? - Yes, sir. - Was it a four-letter word? Yes, sir. What was the first letter of that four-letter word, please? - F. - No laughing in the courtroom! At this point, Mr. Hayden said. This is becoming rather obscene. - Go ahead. - Mr. Hayden said, "Fuck them all. They're all pigs. We should have an army and get guns." While you were assigned to follow Mr. Rubin, did you ever see him throw any object at another human being? - Yes, Tuesday night. - Tuesday night he threw an object? Yes. He threw a sweater. - At who? - At me. I take it you were uninjured by the sweater. Did you ever see any person in the Mobilization wearing a gun? I saw bulges under their coats. You saw bulges? Did you say to yourself at the time, "Those are guns"? I said to myself, "Those are bulges." Extremely accurate. Abbie Hoffman is here from Chicago on the telephone. Only, he's not really here, he's in Chicago. Hey, Abbie. - Robert! - Hi. I heard my first dirty four-letter word today in court. - <i>You did?</i> - It was MF-er. - Is that heavy? - Well, it's. They kept, like, saying it. "What was this dirty word?" And he would say, "MF-er." Oh, it's unbelievable. - I mean, our trial is a jewel. - Yeah. After every witness we'd hear we'd say, "We're in the wrong court." Like today there was this big bull dyke of a policewoman. I'm probably gonna get sued for that one. - Is it Miss or Mrs? - Miss. Do you know a person named Abbie Hoffman? Yes, sir. And do you see that person in the courtroom at this time? Yes, sir. He's hiding behind the gentleman in the maroon shirt. He. Right behind you. Calling your attention to Monday, August 26th. Did you see Abbot Hoffman in Lincoln Park? I did. There was a group of people gathered around Mr. Hoffman. I heard him say it, "On Wednesday, we're gonna meet in Grant Park, "and we're gonna storm the Hilton." And then he said, "We're gonna need a lot of weapons, so we should bring rocks, bottles," and another good weapon, he said, was a brick. And then someone asked about holding the park that night. And he said, "Yeah. We should hold the park tonight at all costs. "It's our park, and the. And the fucking pigs have no right to push us out." <i>The city ordinance prohibits persons</i> <i>from remaining in the park</i> <i>from 11:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.</i> <i>Please obey the law.</i> <i>The city ordinance prohibits</i> <i>persons from.</i> Look, we're not here to fight anyone, all right. If the cops want the park, let them have the park. Who gives a shit? - Hell, no, we won't go! - Hell, no, we won't go! - Hell, no, we won't go! - Hell, no, we won't go! <i>Please obey the law.</i> Get the fucking pigs! Get the car! - Hell, no, we won't go! - Hell, no, we won't go! - Hell, no, we won't go! - Hell, no, we won't go! - Hell, no, we won't go! - Hell, no, we won't go! Is anybody hurt? Is anybody hurt? Mike? <i>Now, from your own observations</i> <i>at the Democratic National Convention</i> <i>on these nights,</i> <i>did you see any policemen</i> <i>beat any demonstrators?</i> <i>No, sir.</i> <i>Did you see any policemen</i> <i>do anything wrong?</i> <i>No.</i> Up against the wall, motherfucker! He hit you there with a club - and over the eye? - He hit me all over the place. And there were two of them that hit me, but only one that I can recognize. Do you want me to try and stop the bleeding? Wanna let me try to stop your bleeding? - Is it bleeding badly? - Yeah. And I asked the bartender for another drink, and all of a sudden these guys with blue helmets come in, pushing people out of the way, and telling everybody, "Get out!" So I turn around and look at this guy in a blue helmet, this pig, and he says to me, "Get out!" I said, "Why? This is only my second drink." He said, "You had enough drinks, get out!" And I'm real mad because I'm not part of this Yippie gang or anything like that. I'm just an ordinary citizen in this Oxford pub having a Black Label and soda. So I just laid my drink down and got out before that guy put the stick to me. How come you weren't drinking White Horse? That's all I got to say. I was scared, just plain scared. <i>As you come around the corner</i> <i>of the back porch</i> <i>into the yard behind</i> <i>5012 South Dorchester,</i> <i>you may see a group</i> <i>of 10 to 12-year-old boys</i> <i>playing what looks like any one</i> <i>of the games that city kids play.</i> <i>But this game is new.</i> <i>The kids call it,</i> <i>"Cops and Demonstrators."</i> Michael, would you rather be a cop or a demonstrator when you play this game? A demonstrator. I like to be a cop better than a demonstrator because the demonstrators, when you hit the person, you know, it kind of hurts sometimes. Cops and Demonstrators is a relatively new game. But the different thing about it, according to the boys, is that in this one no one ever wins. - All the way with LBJ! - All the way with LBJ! - All the way with LBJ! - All the way with LBJ! One man followed these people all the way around. Why couldn't we give it to them? March or leave. We wish to announce now our firm determination to organize a rally the afternoon of August 28 and from there to march to the International Amphitheater where we will be heard on the fundamental issues of the war in Vietnam and racism in the United States. <i>This is David Dellinger,</i> <i>who is a national chairman</i> <i>of the National Mobilization Committee</i> <i>to End the War in Vietnam.</i> What's the purpose of your arrival here and wait at the mayor's office? Well, obviously there's an emergency created by the city's refusal to give us any meaningful place to protest. The city invited the Democratic Convention to come in, in fact paid a lot of money to have it come in. In these days, with Americans and Vietnamese being killed daily in Vietnam, you can't hold a political convention without expecting some form of protest to accompany it. I would like to say here and now that this administration will never permit a lawless, violent group of terrorists to menace the lives of millions of people, destroy the purpose of this National Convention and take over the streets of Chicago. <i>Ms. Willis, what is your reaction</i> <i>to the news we get from downtown</i> of all the violence that's going on down there? Well, the way I understand it is the white people are always hollering about how the colored people act and everything, but, you know, now things that it's turned around to show you who it really is. Are you happier that it's downtown and not up here? Yeah, I'm very glad. Well, do you feel any sympathy for the white people who are being beaten up and tear-gassed downtown? Well, no. At this point, are you still planning to go ahead with your march to the Amphitheater? Yes, we are. And we think also that, you know, there is that old song about "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." And I think that if people simply fold up their tents and go away when they're threatened with arrest or brutality, then we will have a police state. What to do about the march? I don't know. This was originally to be a festival of life, not a confrontation. My own feeling is I don't want to get my head busted in and I don't want anybody who came knowing that I was coming here to have their head busted in. So I'm not going to march formally as a Yippie. I'm going on the Mobilization march as an individual but not as a leader of Yippies. And I don't know if I'll march from here if it looks like a bloodbath scene. I mean, man, 25,000 troops. Are you kidding me? It's ridiculous. I don't know about the rest of the people here, but I'm gonna be in that march and I'm gonna march from here, and I'll march all the way down there. What do you think about the trial? - I don't know anything about the trial. - Oh, yeah, where you going? - And listen. - What's your name? My name is Frankie. How are you? Some of my friends are on trial in there. What do you think about it? - They are going to prison for 10 years. - I don't know. For having a state of mind - and looking silly. - Are they? - Well, you ought to get sensible. - Who? - Like the. All of you guys. - Why? - Dress like the rest of them. - Why? Because you'd look better. You look too messy. Oh, so you think people should go to prison 'cause they look messy? - No. - Why not? - You should cut your hair. - Why? - Because. - What? It ain't cute? - You want to touch it? - No. Oh, come on, look. I cut it every morning. It grows like this. By midnight, - it'll be down to my ankles. - Listen, I got to go. So what do you think about the trial, man? Well, I have. I have a good seat, and it's unbelievable theater. Great show. The outcome don't look good, but the beginning and the middle is looking great. I view it as a clash between life and death. Between what the French call <i>la vitale,</i> the vital force. And I think that. Well, as I conceptualize it and frame it, I try to have all the symbolism on our side reflect the symbolism of life that's reflected in the revolution of which we are symbols ourselves. I teach and I write poetry and I lecture at universities. And did you have any occasion to meet with Abbie Hoffman? I did. Do you recall what Mr. Hoffman said in the course of conversation? He said that politics had become theater and magic, basically, that it was the manipulation of imagery through the mass media that was confusing and hypnotizing the people in the United States. Making them accept a war which they really didn't believe in. After he spoke to you, what, if anything, was your response to his suggestion? to his suggestion? Oh, I was worried whether the whole scene would become violent. I was worried whether the government would let us do something - that was funnier, or prettier or. - Objection. I. - I sustain the objection. - I sustain the objection. That was our conversation, sir. Mr. Ginsberg, you were named as kind of a Yippie religious leader, were you not? No, not really, because the word "leader" was one we really tried to get away from. - It was more like a. - A religious Yippie teacher? .religious experimenter. - Oh, experimenter. Now, concerning a number of books of poetry that you have written. In the <i>Empty Mirror,</i> there is a poem called "The Night Apple." Do you believe you could recite that for the jury? "The Night Apple. "Last night I dreamed of one I loved "For seven long years "But I saw no face "Only the familiar presence of the body "Sweat, skin, eyes "Feces, urine, sperm, saliva "All one odor and mortal taste" Could you explain to the jury what the religious significance of this poem meant? If you would take a wet dream as a religious experience, I could. It's a description of a wet dream. Right. Your Honor, I have to get some materials to properly carry on my cross-examination of this witness. All right, we will go until 2:00. Your Honor, we asked for five minutes two days ago and you refused to give it to us. - You are shouting at the court. - Oh, Your Honor. I have never shouted at you during this trial. Your Honor, your voice has been raised, - and several times. - You have been disrespectful. It is not disrespectful. And sometimes even worse than that. Will you step off the witness stand? He's just trying to calm us both down. I needed no calming down! Allen Ginsberg demonstrated to the court a chant that he uses to calm tensions and quiet crowds. It goes, "Um." When an argument broke out between defense attorneys and the judge about an early recess, Ginsberg said, "Um." The judge got mad and kicked him out of the courtroom. And there was a running verbal battle down in the corridors, into the elevator between the defendants and the lawyers. Under cross-examination, US Attorney Thomas Foran, had Ginsberg read to the jury three of his most erotic writings. The jury looked shocked. It's doubtful that they understood Ginsberg's explanation of the religious significance of those works. - Hello. - <i>Yeah.</i> - Yes. Yes. Abbie. - <i>How are you?</i> Okay. How was it in court today? There's a whole fascist thing going on around this trial. This is the only trial where you search the hair before you come in. I mean, they have this whole thing downstairs, if you've got long hair you don't get in the federal building. - That must be a relief for you. - <i>Right. Oh, I'm always pulling that.</i> I'll say, "Yeah, okay, I'll see you. You can have my seat. "Go ahead, get the next short-haired prisoner." <i>The public starts waiting</i> <i>about 10:00 at night</i> <i>outside the federal building</i> <i>to get into our trial.</i> <i>In Chicago now,</i> <i>it's about 15 below zero at night.</i> <i>Gentlemen, what was it like</i> <i>out here last night?</i> <i>Cold. Very cold.</i> - <i>Were you able to get any sleep?</i> - <i>No.</i> Have you got anything more with you than the blanket - that's wrapped around your shoulders? - Not other than what's on me, no. If I did, it would be on me. Is it worth standing out here in this freezing cold? I think so. Why? What's the attraction? Well, it's something that you're not gonna see on television and I'd like to see it, you know, first-hand. - How long have you been out here? - Since about 4:00 this morning. - Are you pretty cold? - I'm freezing. These people are Communists. I receive intelligence reports. There is a Communist conspiracy in which they're involved, not only in this country, but abroad. Order in the court. Order in the court. - Here come the judges. - All right. Hey, man, what's up? Good to see you. - Hey, honey, how you doing? - Hey, what's up? - Order in the court. Order in the court. - How you doing there, Counselor? Oh, you look lovely today, ma'am. Is that your real hair? You don't need to get up. May the record show that the defendants Hoffman and Rubin came in attired in what might be called collegiate robes. That's judge's robes, sir. Some might even consider them judicial robes. Judicial robes, that's right. Your idea, Mr. Kunstler? Another of your brilliant ideas? Your Honor, I can't take the credit for this one. That amazes me. - Take off those robes. - Off with the robes. - Off with the robes. - Off with the robes. Abbie, I don't want to suggest that you change your style or anything like that, but have you ever considered that maybe saying all these things <i>is antagonizing the judge?</i> <i>Maybe you should try being nice.</i> Frankly, the only thing that we and Julius would agree upon is that we're infantile. I have to reduce myself to being 15 or even seven or eight confronting my third or fourth grade English teacher who wants to make me do fucking ovals, round, round ovals, you know, for seven hours a day, you know, when I want to go out in the schoolyard and play. That's how I have to relate to him. And I think our role. We're kids. It's not us and the kids. I mean, it's true, we're some kind of teacher, too, and our role in the court is to destroy its authority and the next generation will come along and destroy its power. Conspiracy. - Bob? - Yeah. Did you get Southern? Terry Southern? - He's not there. - He's not there? - He's not there, that's right. - He's the first witness tomorrow. He told me yesterday that he wasn't going to be in until 8:00 or 9:00 tonight. No, no. He was due in at 11:00 this morning. Here call. I know what, call his hotel. We called. He's not there. He hasn't checked in. How about calling his home and seeing when he left? 'Cause, see, he's the first witness and we're really shy on witnesses tomorrow. We might have to get Yippie pneumonia or something. This is Abbie. Oh, he's in Chicago? Okay, bye. Okay, I'll see you. Bye. <i>We must have a $2,000 a week</i> <i>phone bill.</i> <i>Most of our money</i> <i>we raise by speaking,</i> <i>which means we have to leave court,</i> <i>we meet for two hours,</i> <i>and then people like to fly</i> <i>around the country to go speak,</i> <i>have to get back into Chicago</i> <i>by 2:00, 3:00 a.m.,</i> <i>get up at 8:00 for another meeting,</i> <i>get into court from 10:00 to 4:30.</i> <i>"Hoffman to come,</i> <i>the honorarium is $1,000."</i> Yeah, they want to know if you would speak there for 15, 20 minutes at 10:00 p.m. - In where? - In Los Angeles. <i>We're really taking the issues</i> <i>of this trial across the country.</i> Especially to the campuses on weekends and on evenings like this. And they sold 27,000 tickets in two days. <i>How's this for an ego trip?</i> <i>I got a letter today that said,</i> <i>"Abbie Hoffman, Chicago, Illinois."</i> - <i>That's something, huh?</i> - <i>That's fame, Abbie. That's immortality.</i> <i>Accused of conspiracy,</i> <i>we call ourselves The Conspiracy.</i> <i>We answer the telephone,</i> <i>"This is The Conspiracy."</i> <i>Dig it. They accuse us of inciting to riot.</i> <i>It's impossible to incite to riot.</i> <i>If somebody wants to riot, he riots.</i> <i>Malcolm X put it well. He said,</i> <i>"I didn't come here to get you</i> <i>"to do anything</i> <i>you weren't going to do anyway."</i> <i>And the question is,</i> <i>are we going to be strong enough,</i> <i>powerful enough, brave enough,</i> <i>together enough</i> <i>to survive as a generation</i> <i>and change this country?</i> David Dellinger. All right, thanks. We are the future of this country, the future belongs to us. <i>All power to the people. Right on, do it.</i> Arriving 9:42. <i>The Conspiracy stands</i> <i>for the right of free men</i> <i>and free women</i> <i>to walk on a free planet.</i> <i>And of that, we're guilty,</i> <i>five years, 10 years, 20 years,</i> <i>we're guilty until we destroy</i> <i>that motherfucking system. Right on.</i> We're bigger than The Stones. <i>As soon as I walk out of that court,</i> <i>it's like</i> La Dolce Vita, <i>you know,</i> <i>with the paparazzi</i> <i>and all these, like, people chasing me.</i> <i>You know, I get, like,</i> <i>marriage proposals sent to me</i> <i>and jellybeans.</i> <i>Then there's this special toy</i> <i>they want to call an Abbie.</i> <i>There's a soft drink called Yippie.</i> - <i>Yeah, I know. In Baltimore I saw that.</i> - <i>Yeah. A soft drink.</i> <i>Is everybody rolling now?</i> - Is anybody not rolling? Go ahead. - Do it. It's <i>La Dolce Vita.</i> <i>The people of the world</i> <i>are going to defeat</i> <i>that Goliath called imperialism.</i> <i>There are one billion Davids</i> <i>around the world</i> <i>with rocks in their hands.</i> <i>There are one billion Judas with knives</i> <i>ready to sneak in the tent</i> <i>and cut the head off</i> <i>the motherfucking monster.</i> <i>We will not submit,</i> <i>we will not go into their ovens.</i> <i>We will fight back,</i> <i>we will not submit to America's children</i> <i>for breakfast program.</i> <i>Fuck off, you Philistines in Washington.</i> <i>I'm talking about stop this war</i> <i>and stop this trial.</i> <i>And this generation is going to take</i> <i>this country back</i> <i>by any means necessary.</i> Stop the trial! Stop the trial! <i>Yes, we're against violence.</i> <i>The greatest test of this protest</i> <i>is whether we can stop</i> <i>the massive violence in Vietnam.</i> - Fuck you, LBJ! - Fuck you, LBJ! <i>Demonstrators started gathering</i> <i>in the park across</i> <i>from the Hilton Hotel at 11:00 p.m.</i> <i>More than 400 police officers guard</i> <i>the front of the Hilton,</i> <i>headquarters for</i> <i>the Democratic National Committee</i> <i>and other agents of the President.</i> - Fuck you, LBJ! - Fuck you, LBJ! - Fuck you, LBJ! - Fuck you, LBJ! - Fuck you, LBJ! - Fuck you, LBJ! Has there been any violence tonight at all here across the street from the Conrad Hilton? Yes, there has been. - Can you tell us what it was? - I'll give you an exhibit. There were several of these thrown at police officers. Would you describe that? Yes, it's a golf ball, a practice ball that has many spikes through it. <i>I take one look at the troops in Vietnam,</i> <i>I know what America's</i> <i>foreign policy is about.</i> <i>America now is the America</i> <i>of the Democratic Party.</i> <i>Most of us here didn't come</i> <i>to support McCarthy.</i> - The guards! - <i>The troops are out.</i> - The guards! - <i>Troops are out.</i> - Peace now!

The purpose of the Moratorium is, in essence, to protest the continuation of the war and to urge the withdrawal of American forces in Vietnam. I myself, and I'm sure all of us, and all of you, are simply staggered by the thought of what the life of a single person needlessly slaughtered in Vietnam means. So, we will read the names of those who were killed in the war this week. Michael Edward Adams, Grand City. Robert Charles, of Chicago. Ron Charles Allen, South Beloit. Howard Lloyd Elm, Earl, Illinois. - Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. - Henry A. Holmes. - The honorable judge Chicago. .of the United States district court is present. The court is now in session. Mr. Hoffman, we are observing the Moratorium. I am Judge Hoffman, sir. I believe in equality, sir, so I prefer to call people "Mister" - or by their first names. - You will sit down, sir. - Can I be heard, Your Honor? - Your Honor, I object - to this man speaking out in court. - We would just like to propose - a moment of silence. - You needn't object. I forbid him to disrupt the proceedings. Your Honor, I want to object to Mr. Foran's yelling in the presence of the jury. Your Honor has admonished - the defense counsel. - Your Honor, this is outrageous. - the defense counsel. - Your Honor, this is outrageous. This man is a mouthpiece! Look at him. He's wearing an armband of his clients. The government protests his attitude and requests the court move to take notice of his conduct! Your Honor, I think that the temper and the expression on Mr. Foran's face speaks more than any picture could tell. - Of my contempt for Mr. Kunstler! - Mr. Kunstler. To call me a mouthpiece. - Jesus Christ! .and for Your Honor not to open his mouth and say that's not to be done in your court, I think, violates the sanctity of this court. That is a word Your Honor knows is contemptuous and contumacious. Don't tell me what I know. I want him admonished, Your Honor, - and I request you to do that. - I do not admonish the United States attorney because he was properly representing his client, the United States of America. To call another attorney a mouthpiece? You, a lawyer, permitting your client to stand up in the presence of the jury and disrupt these proceedings. I don't know how to characterize it. Your Honor, we do not permit, or not permit, our clients. They are free, independent human beings who have been brought - by the government to this courtroom. - That's right. They're free, but they'll conform to the law and they'll conform to the direction of the court here, sir. - Are you turning down my request? - I not only turn it down, I ignore it. That speaks louder than words. <i>The crowd of</i> <i>about 10,000 anti-war protesters</i> <i>finally got a permit today to hold a rally</i> <i>in the Band Shell area of Grant Park.</i> <i>Police performed the menial task</i> <i>of passing out handbills</i> <i>telling the demonstrators that a permit</i> <i>for their rally had been granted,</i> <i>quote, "In the interest of free speech</i> <i>and assembly" end quote.</i> <i>The handbills also said that no permit</i> <i>for a march to the Amphitheater</i> <i>had been granted</i> <i>and that demonstrators would get</i> <i>nowhere but to a jail cell</i> <i>if they tried to march.</i> Why did you come to the rally in the first place? We're sympathetic with these people and their feelings. <i>Are you and these other, as you put it,</i> <i>beautiful people looking for trouble?</i> <i>No, I think we all recognize</i> <i>that we don't have a chance</i> against bayonets, clubs, guns and tear gas. We're unarmed and most of us are nonviolent. Do you intend to stay on here if there's trouble? No, we'll run very fast. <i>I've just got word</i> <i>from the Chicago Police</i> <i>that there are 15,000 people</i> <i>in this park right now.</i> <i>And under these circumstances,</i> <i>I think that's pretty great.</i> <i>Now, let me tell you what we have</i> <i>planned for this afternoon.</i> <i>We're going to hear</i> <i>from a few speakers</i> <i>and then, as discussed,</i> <i>I will be leading a nonviolent march</i> <i>down to the Democratic Convention</i> <i>at the Amphitheater.</i> <i>We will be prepared for arrest</i> <i>if that's what is going to happen.</i> <i>But we believe</i> <i>that the power of the people is a permit,</i> <i>and we hope that the city will let us go.</i> <i>All right, our first speaker</i> <i>will be the Youth International Party's</i> <i>Jerry Rubin.</i> <i>Welcome to</i> <i>the most important convention</i> <i>that is going on in this city. Yeah!</i> <i>Right now I'm ready to go to jail.</i> <i>I'm ready to get clubbed on the head.</i> <i>I'm ready to die to change this country.</i> <i>We come here to express</i> <i>our point of view</i> <i>about the Convention,</i> <i>and what do we have?</i> <i>Twenty-four hours a day,</i> <i>seven days a week,</i> <i>we've got a fucking armed camp.</i> <i>You know what I say? Fuck them!</i> <i>They announced that this would be</i> <i>the most secure convention</i> <i>in the history of the country.</i> <i>They have no respect</i> <i>for organized protest.</i> <i>The gas falls on all of us</i> <i>and it is time for us to begin to show</i> <i>a little bit of contempt</i> <i>and a little bit of resistance</i> <i>because that is all</i> <i>that they are showing us.</i> <i>At this point we will begin</i> <i>to assemble peacefully</i> <i>for a nonviolent march</i> <i>to the Amphitheater.</i> <i>We have got to go.</i> A little faster in the front. <i>All right, we're just keeping our cool,</i> <i>moving out here.</i> <i>There's a tremendous crowd</i> <i>and we want the people in the back</i> <i>to be able to form</i> <i>into orderly lines also.</i> <i>We'd like not to have</i> <i>too many people massed in front</i> <i>or the side.</i> <i>We're trying to have an orderly march,</i> <i>eight abreast.</i> <i>It looks to me like we're many more</i> <i>than eight abreast.</i> <i>Now, if we do get</i> <i>into a confrontation situation.</i> I want to request again, demand again that I be able to cross-examine the witness. Now, you have Benjamin Franklin and George Washington sitting in pictures behind you and they were slave owners, that's what they were. They owned slaves. And you are acting in the same manner by denying me my constitutional right. - Young man, if you keep this up. - Look, old man, you're being exposed to the public and to the world - that you don't. - Have him sit down, Mr. Marshal. I want to defend myself! I have the right to speak on behalf of my constitutional rights. I didn't think I would ever live to sit. To sit on a bench in a courtroom where George Washington was assailed by a defendant and a judge was criticized for having his portrait on the wall. The law protects my right not to be discriminated against. - Why don't you recognize that? - Mr. Seale! Do you want to stop? - Or do you want me to direct. - You can't deny me my rights! You can't deny me my constitutional rights! Take that defendant into the room in there and deal with him as he should be dealt with. I still want to be represented. I want to represent myself! Let me go! I want to represent myself. It's my constitutional right. I got a right! I got a right! I got a right! <i>If anybody's interfering with our rights,</i> <i>we're going to take</i> <i>this peacefully and orderly.</i> <i>I would like a chance to speak</i> <i>to the commanding officer, please.</i> <i>Are you the commanding officer?</i> I'm David Dellinger, National Mobilization. We wanted to communicate peacefully from here to the Amphitheater. There will be no march. There will be no march. There's no permit to march. Well, we believe it's not necessary to have a permit. There will be no march today. That's our order. We would like to have a reason so that that could be communicated to the world. There will be no march today. Your Honor, if Mr. Seale would express to the court his willingness to be quiet, will the court entertain the possibility of Mr. Seale being unbound and ungagged? Mr. Seale, if you will assure the court that you will be respectful and conduct yourself in a manner that is gentlemanly, then I am willing to allow you to resume your former place at the table. Will you, sir? I would like to speak - on behalf of my constitutional right. - If you will give me your assurance, will you please indicate by raising your head up and down? Mr. Marshal, I don't think you have accomplished your purpose by that contrivance. .I would freely express my. - We will take another recess. I want to speak on behalf of my constitutional right! You can't deny me my rights. You can't deny me my constitutional right! <i>All right, now we're continuing</i> <i>to maintain our cool.</i> <i>We have been told by a captain</i> <i>that there will be no march today.</i> <i>When we asked him why,</i> <i>he said, "Those are the orders.</i> <i>There will be no march today."</i> <i>We're stubborn bastards.</i> <i>We may be nonviolent,</i> <i>but we're stubborn.</i> Yes, yeah. I just want to get them out of here so they won't do anything to them. Get your hands off me. Go! Come on now. Go! Go! Just roll them over! Roll up the window and go, ma'am, go! Come on now, go. <i>Negotiations at the front of the march</i> <i>have not produced anything so far,</i> <i>negotiation with the police.</i> <i>Two Mobilization representatives</i> <i>have gone to talk</i> <i>to negotiate with people higher up</i> <i>in the administration,</i> <i>perhaps Daley,</i> <i>though that is not confirmed.</i> Well, we're right in the middle of negotiating about a decision as to where we're going to go. - Are you going to get out of here? - I think we will. You think they'll let you march? I think that we will be able to proceed further. <i>And so it is our opinion</i> <i>that we should regroup</i> <i>at the Hilton Hotel.</i> <i>We are not being arrested here,</i> <i>so we will proceed to the Hilton Hotel</i> <i>to regroup.</i> Man, please. If Your Honor please. The buckles on the leather strap that's holding Mr. Seale's hand are digging into his hand. Could he be assisted? If the Marshal has concluded that he needs assistance, of course. Your Honor, are we going to stop the medieval torture that's going on in this courtroom? This is no longer a court of order, Your Honor. This is an unholy disgrace. - Created by Mr. Kunstler! - Created by nothing other than what you have done to this man. Judge, you come down here and watch this. - Fascist dogs! - Your Honor, - he's being choked to death. - You low-life son of a bitch! Somebody protect him! Your Honor, may the record show that that comment was made by Mr. Dellinger? You fucking fascist pigs! Fascist pigs. - And that was Mr. Rubin speaking. - Everything you say will be taken down. It's cruel, cruel and unusual punishment. You're a fascist dog, Judge. Why don't you just kill him if you're going to gag him? I mean, doesn't it seem that way? You are not permitted to address the court, Mr. Hoffman. This is not a court. It's a neon oven. This whole thing started when these guys got into overkill. It's the same thing as last year in Chicago! It's the exact same thing! <i>Two blocks north,</i> <i>there's an open bridge.</i> <i>Two blocks north,</i> <i>there's an open bridge.</i> <i>Go north on Michigan then over</i> <i>to the Conrad Hilton to get through.</i> <i>You go directly across</i> <i>the National Guard troops</i> <i>blocking the way with machine guns.</i> You're not alive.

We're the only people that can protect ourselves from genocide and protect all of us on trial and everyone else on trial. And I have no program on what to do. I think it's wrong for someone to get up and say, "Tell us what to do," 'cause you know what to do, you know where you are, you know what's effective. And you know that across the country there are people like you who are ready to act. And they don't need no leader telling them what to do, 'cause we're all leaders. They don't need anyone giving orders. They don't even need anyone giving instructions. And I can tell you that all eight of us are going to jail with that view of history, with that view of the future. And we're all going to jail smiling 'cause we know damn well that the people in this room are going to break the jail down and free us! Thank you. <i>With all these people here,</i> <i>I think the most appropriate,</i> <i>very human, revolutionary</i> <i>thing to first say,</i> <i>like we always say, is,</i> <i>"All power to the people."</i> Subtitles by LeapinLar Stop blocking the mirror. I'm in a hurry too. Don't push. Do I look pretty? Ein Triptychon Here I can show my faith and express my wishes. I pray hard to become rich and successful. Some of my customers want me to suck their penises. I tell them Allah didn't create my mouth for that purpose. I tell the holy Death: You exist, but God is higher. God will always be higher than you. Stop here! Here you go. Emma, wait for me! 299 please. Oops, I have to do it again. - Whats wrong? Let's pray so we will get lots of clients. I prayed to get many. - So did I. Have you already eaten? - Not yet, I'm having my hair done first. Well, let's clock in. Give us money, luck and all things good and beautiful! Have you eaten? - No, not yet. Let's have our hair done first and then go eat. What do you feel like eating? - I don't know. Thanks. 76. 214. Wow, lots of girls here today. Let's go. So many girls. Hope I get a client. - It'll be tough. Sure would be good if l got one. - That's right. But business is slow at the moment. THE FISHTANK Bangkok, Thailand Taste good? - Yes! Are you almost done? Like yesterday with big curls and everything. I made them loose and bouncy. There are hardly any johns left. Naam! Have you been here a longtime? Emma, the guy with glasses is looking at you. Go for it! He's been watching you for a while. Look, he's asking if you want to go with him. He wants you! - She's right. He wants you again. - He's asking if you remember him. I dont think so. Or maybe. Yes, I remember. Welcome. Come in. Look how pretty the girls are! - Do you have new ones too? We have girls for 1,600 bhats for 2 hours. All inclusive. Red numbers: 1,800 for 2 hours. "Sideline girls": 2,200for 90 minutes. What kind of a girl would you like? I recommend 243, 210, and 280. We offer an all-inclusive service. - Really? The blue numbers cost 1,600. Thats for 2 hours too. It includes a bath and blow job. What about 232? - Sure, 232 is good too. I assure you, you wont be disappointed. Okay, 232.Andwhat about you? I need a girl willing to do everything. 210 has a good attitude. She is perfect. And she's pretty too. - Right. And who else? - 280. And 243.Allthree are very good. None of them will disappoint you. Ill take 210. - Okay, 210. One moment please. 210. 232. 107. Please come out. Just a moment. They will be right out. I promise you beautiful bodies and good service. The cashier is there. You pay over there. Your girl, sir. - Hello. 232 for you, sir. 210. This way please. Payments here, please. That makes 1,700 for you. By credit card, Ok. That makes 1,800 for you. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Right this way. You wont regret it. Take good care of him. Enjoy yourself, sir. Everything paid for? Good. I come here to buy myself a little happiness. Only briefly, 30 minutes or an hour. 2 hours at the most. We talk and get along even if its only for a short time. There's no comparing these girls with my wife. My wife is my lifetime partner. We've been through thick and thin together. We understand each other. We men are a commodity here. We supply the money. And for a short time we gain access to their bodies. It's a clear deal and when it's over, it's over. My mother is a pain in the ass. I've been living at home for 4 years, but now I've had it! It's more fun here because you have people to chat with. At home I was always surrounded by children and old people. The children get on your nerves. My family gives me money, but I don't like that. Yeah, that's a pain. I'd rather earn my own money. But, it's boring putting on makeup to just sit around. Not to me, the money is good. - It's boring to me. A job is a job. We have to enjoy what we do. Otherwise it would make us unhappy. But it's no fun if no one picks you! Why are you here? Dont you have a wife? I just want to talk with the girls. - Your wife can't make you happy? I'm single. - She must have forgotten how. Lots of us have the same problem. Without these girls it would be much worse. Excuses, excuses. Your wife was pretty and you loved her once. Just having dinner with her was pure bliss. But now we have them day in and day out. And you know why? It's because they have us in their pockets. What I like is the variety. - They even smell different. Button me my wife is still number 1. Don't mention my wife to me. She is a cold fish now. But it still hurts when she cheats on me. Your wives might be fooling around with the neighbor right now. You know how people say: "Your kid looks like your neighbor." I hope that never happens to us. You never know. "Never say never!" I can get you something very special. 210 and 201. I can vouch for those two. - Will they do everything? You'll go home happy. What about you? 201? I'd like something on the wild side. - Then I recommend 201. What about 231? - Shes fine too. Ill take 231. - Okay. 210. 231. I heard the attendants get to test the girls first. No, we just look at their bodies. I heard you get to test them. No, only with our eyes. If we get involved, they wont obey us. I think I'll look for a second job. - On the weekends? You should learn massage. - Do you think so? But classes are expensive. - Really? Once you start working, you have to payback. How much does it cost? - 3,000. But you can pay it back when you start working. Does it involve sex? You learn something new. - I want to know if there's sex. Yes, some want massage, some want sex. I always give sex too. I don't do just massage. It makes me tired and frustrated. And it's strenuous. But you earn a lot. - And were not earning enough here. There are many new girls, younger girls. Older ones too. - But there isn't enough work. Theres too much competition. A few days ago they brought in five new ones. Good ones! That means less work for us. - You said it! One john per shift won't even pay for my bus ticket. How much? 290. Emma, is this your size? - Is there a sexy top for it? I'm quite big. It could fit. It looks good. Try it on. Its too sexy for me. Are you living alone now? What about your boyfriend? My boyfriend comes from Hong Kong. You're going with a foreigner? Yes, but we don't live together. Have you ever had a crush on a john? No. - Why not? Maybe because I already have a boyfriend. Of all the foreign johns, which ones do you dislike most? I'm scared of the Malaysians. Why? - They're mean. I dont want any Africans. I've never had one. - They have huge dicks. They fuck you so hard it hurts, and they're sadists. And the Indians stink. What do you think about Indians? To me the Malaysians are bad enough. Can I have her for 1,300? - No. 1,800 is quite cheap. I don't have so much money today. Take pity on the girls. And who will take pity on me? - Oh please, sir. I'm low on money and I still have to eat dinner. In Japan you would pay ten times as much for a girl. Please, make me a better offer. Sorry, I can't. Give me a discount. - I can't. 1,800 is cheap enough. Cant you make me a better offer? - No. Ning. I don't understand. Sometimes I wonder if l'll find a husband in this lifetime. I don't need a man, but kids are important. Or am I too old? A girl should quit working at 30. And I'm 27. - What can I say? I'm nearly 40. - But you still look good. Relationships aren't always easy. But you have a hot temper yourself. How am I supposed to be? He doesn't listen. He always has to have his way. I'm not a machine. He even wants sex when I'm doing the laundry. I'm always careful with relationships. But I'm in a mess this time. I'm too patient with my boyfriend. I put up with everything, except when he drinks. Whats the problem? - He's an old diabetic with high blood pressure. But he still wants to fuck, all the time. - I know! How do you stand it? - I do what he wants. Last time in the car l just sat there. I can imagine what happened. He wants to fuck but can't get it up. So you must help. And it never ends. Don't I know it! - I couldn't stand it. I figured thats how he is! With me it's just for money. I have to feed my family. At work its all over in 30 minutes, or in a couple of hours. At home, they never leave you alone! My boyfriend is okay, but he wants sex all the time. All the time! The one in the pink dress is fresh. Maybe she worked somewhere else before? No, she went through training here. The one in black has a good figure. If you're into big tits. I like 293 and 210. 209, 280, and 243 too. Service guaranteed. - I see. 243. Please come out. You again. I hope his penis is too big for you. She doesn't look older than 15 or 16. She is 19 and wonderfully light skinned. Show him a goodtime. - I will. Hi, what's your name? My name is Ann. - Ann, how pretty you are! 243 please. You come from Chiang Rai? How much? - 1,800 please. That's expensive. No discount? No, and I expect a tip. - No tips. I'm a stingy foreigner. A little bit. Here you go. I'll be nice today. Thank you! Thank you very much. - For you, child. Treat him well! Thank you. - Thank you. I've been working here for more than 10 years. Often the girls have problems, and I'm here if they need me. I try to give them warmth and intimacy. Most of the girls need lots of love. I'm like a second mother to them. To relax they go to host clubs and spend time with bar boys. That can lead to problems. If they like a guy, they spend all their money. Everything they earn goes to pampering these guys. Have a seat! - Can I take my pick? Have a seat first. - Usually l pick out a guy first. A bottle? - Of course! A bottle of Red Label, please! Can I pick? Sure! I want Toh. Wat, and the one with the spiky blond hair. Hey, have Toh come over for a three-way. Sit next to me. One more? The one with the big hair? Say hi. This is Pam. What did you order? Whiskey. But I can't get any service. Waiter! See what a gentleman he is! With soda and Coke! I don't want a drink. I want to sleep with you. - Really? OK, but then you'll be my customer. I have to pay? - Sure, you want, you pay. I wouldn't charge you. Well, I will. How does it work? I pay and you give me my money back. And love at first sight? Would you turn down an older woman? I like the ones under 30 better. How old was your oldest one? 40? - Yes. Older even. - No way! How old was the very oldest one? 48. Almost 50? You should have said no. She was a customer, she bought me drinks. Then put up a sign: Nobody over 40 allowed! 255 please! 203! Arent you coming? You don't want to fuck me anymore? You have to do what? You're probably tired of my pussy. You fucked me so many times. Now you don't want to anymore. You were here, I saw you. Come see me and I'll do you good like I always do. Hello. Yeah. We'll see, but first come over. Just get over here. Have I ever disappointed you in bed? Dont you like fucking me anymore? That's a matter of taste. If you still liked me, you'd be here. Why dont you come over? Am I not as pretty as before? You're my sweetheart. But you cant forbid me to share my body. I've seen you go into other girls' rooms. So come over. You're getting on my nerves. Come over now! Why are you doing this to me? THECITYOFJOY Faridpur, Bangladesh Want to come to my room? - Sure. 200takas. 50takas. 50 is too cheap. I charge 200. 50 or nothing. Cant you pay 100? And only if you're pleased. - Don't make problems. No I won't. I won't make problems. But if you like what I do, you come back. Okay? Take him! How much farther? - It's right here. Should I come in? - Yes. Treat me well! - I'll show you a goodtime. I'll be right back, I'm going to get a condom from my mother. Have a seat. A condom please! I'm closing the door now. What about the client you had yesterday? When is he coming back? The day after tomorrow. Good. And the one who stayed so long? When will he be back? Tomorrow, he said. Ah, tomorrow. Your face is the prettiest on the whole floor. You will earn well in the future, God willing. Hold your head still. In the morning I woke up and showered. Then I rested in my room and had breakfast. Then I went downstairs. I picked up a client. He was 20 or 21 years old. That guy wore a panjabi. After he was done with me, I had a one-legged man. After him came an old grandpa with a white beard. Right after the old man I got another customer. He mishandled me and I got very angry. I told him: "You may never come back to my room." More followed after that, around 10 clients altogether. They were all nice. No others treated me badly. One of them was a very good-looking young man. He was very nice to me. He really was. Another one was a midget. He was okay. I've been working in this job for more than 20 years. First I was in Dinajpur, but we were driven out. So I went to Saidpur. After Saidpur I came here to Faridpur. I fell in love in Faridpur. His name is Bablu. We've been in love for more than 12 years. But love needs money. Without money neither love nor lovers last. At the moment I have four girls working for me. We live on a share of their income. Without my girls wed be on the street. The street is our future. The money l earn isn't enough for a house or a car. You have a daughter. Yes, a daughter and a son. I need a condom. This is Mina. She has many customers. I have 3 other girls. One is pregnant, so she isn't working. All my girls are the same to me. I am equally fond of all of them. I love them like my own children. They are my livelihood, after all. I teach them and guide them about everything. This is our whole life. What else do we have? Think of my daughter. I live in a brothel district. Because her mother is a whore, no one will want to marry her. If someone does marry her, it will only be for money. When there is money, he will love her, if not, he will kick her out. And then what? She'll probably become a whore. When I am very old, I won't be able to support her. She'll have no choice. She'll become a whore. The outside world pushes us out of the way to make room. Those people are our clients. Outside, they are disgusted by us; in here, they love us and our bodies. Come in with me. You have on too much makeup. Leave me alone. Don't use so much makeup, sweetie! Don't you want to come in? - Not today. Because of a pretty girl downstairs? - No. Those girls tried, but I said I have something better upstairs. I meant you. So she let me go. What's my name? Tell me. Maybe you have no name. If you told her my name, you can tell me too. I said your name is little bird. You're like a little bird. Give me a break. I really did say that. You're sure you don't want to come in today? I don't have enough money. Show me. Ill take everything I find. I only have 15 takas on me. Come on! And if l find more than that? Then you can have it. Really? Ill take everything you have. Show me. I had nine customers today. All nine were really fine. They were perfect gentlemen with me. It always depends on the mans family. If he comes from a good family, he has good manners. If he comes from a bad family, he has bad manners. If he comes from a good family, he should have good manners. But it depends on my behavior too. If l treat him badly, he treats me badly. If a girl behaves badly, she gets a bad reputation quickly. Customers tell each other: "Don't go to that girl." If l lose a customer, then his friends stop coming too. I treat my customers right, so they keep coming back. Otherwise I would be left with nothing. A customer would come once and never again. I've been here for 2 months and 6 days. Today l had 4 customers. One didn't work with me. The other 3 customers did. I asked him: "Why don't you work with me?" He said: "I dont want to. I just want to talk." I said: "What do you want to talk about?" He said: "All kinds of things." I'm not going to work with you. I said: "Okay, then talk." We spoke, then he left. He didnt work with me. Why are you hesitating? Come on, let's go to my room! Don't laugh. I can't help it. Laughter always brings sadness too. Why cry? I've cried enough for a lifetime. I can't help it, I have to laugh. Laughing, crying. Both are a part of life. No one can see what is buried deeper. There is so much sorrow and pain. We try to forget sadness with a little laughter, but the pain still remains. After a long hard days work, we go there to enjoy ourselves and have fun. We have girlfriends there: Shima, Rima, Uma. We spend our spare time with them. They give us satisfaction and we make them happy too. We fuck in our spare time, then we go home. After we eat, we go back again. Having fun with them makes us feel good. Are you done? Yes, I go to the red-light district. I have a girl there. Her name is Shilpi. I like her very much. I sometimes see her twice a day. She is really nice to me. She has very pretty eyes. Everything about her is pretty. Her hands, feet, eyes, eyebrows, lips. And she's a good girl too. I only go to other girls if we fight. But she finds me. "Come with me now, she says. And I go to her because I love her. When I have a break, I go to the bazaar and fuck. To enjoy myself. I go at least once or twice a day. It's all I think about. Without the Faridpur brothel district, women couldn't go out on the street without being molested. Men would be so horny they would rape them. Without those women, men would be screwing cows and goats. The brothel is definitely good for the area. If you take it away, the younger generation would surely suffer. Me too, because I go there to relieve myself. How much? 300 takas. Yes or no? Cant you charge less? - Not less than 300. Alright. Go away. - No, I like her. She's a poem. Don't pull me. - That is the way! Some penises work on me too long. It is hard for me to take them in. If someone fucks too long, it hurts, and I have to skip a few customers. And some penises are too big. That's another problem. Putting a big one in me can hurt too much. Then I have to skip a few customers. But sometimes I do it anyway. I use creams and oils to ease the hurt. Some men come in drunk and want too much. To eat my pussy and take off all my clothes. Or they try to make me suck their penises. If l refuse, they wont call on me again. Men don't realize how we sacrifice our sense of shame for money. 600 takas allows fucking twice in one hour. Some penises need time to get hard again. You have to drink or eat with them before the second time. You cant just push a button to make it hard. Hey, Jhorna, not with me! Or I'll fuck with you too. Sounds like you're itching. I'm horny, I want sex! Hi, sweetie, come to mama. Don't walk by without saying anything. My heart is beating like crazy. Where are you going? Where are you going? - Home. I'm done here. Coming back tomorrow? - Let go of him. Is it your business? I wasn't talking to you. Fuck off! Mind your own business and shut up. Hey, behave yourself. - Sorry, sorry. Come on, let's go. You be quiet. Where are you going? Upstairs. What's her name? Shopna. All right. Go! If they say a name, it's okay. Show me your money. So later you can't say you have none. Come on. To hell with educated men. This is a whorehouse. Here educated and uneducated men behave the same. Wait, wait, whats the hurry? - Let go of me. I just want to talk. Whats wrong? Come with me! I said leave me alone! What are you going to do? Come with me! If l ask nicely, you should come with me. If youre not satisfied, you can leave. - I heard you the first time. Go in the room! - I'm staying right here. Grab that coward and drag him in. Get up! - Don't rush me! You're asking for trouble. Get up and come with me! This is a fucking whore house, not a family dinner! Your honor has no place here. Lets talk outside. The girl can wait here. Let's go talk outside. Stay here, girl. I'm just going next door for a moment. I'll be back to talk to you. Okay? You must be hungry. Your cheeks are hollow. Okay, let's go. How much do you want? 8,000. A girl like that isnt worth 8,000. Ill take her if you lower your price. Listen. I have to borrow the money and pay interest. What is your offer? 5,000 maximum. So? What is your answer? Alright. But not this low next time. Bring me a good girl and I'll pay more. But I won't pay more for her. The next one will be better. - I hope so. Our deal is 5,000. Here. Count it. Stay here, I'll be right back. I want to talk to her first. Girl, listen. Where do you come from? Comilla. Comilla? - Yes. Do you have parents? - Yes. Are they alive? - Yes. Do you live with your real mother? A stepmother. How long have you worked the street? I started 6 years ago. 6 years. - Yes. Was that the only work you did in Dhaka? - Yes. Girls work as whores for me. Is that clear? Yes. Your hands and feet are dry and chapped. Let's see your hair. Oh dear. Show me your breasts. They'll pass. We'll manage somehow. Let's see your legs. What's your name? My name is Ruma. - Ruma? Yes. You must stay here one year. Do you understand? - Yes. Then I will take care of you in the future. After one year, you can work for yourself. Do you understand? You must earn money regularly. And you must be well-behaved and use nice language. You have to solicit clients. Otherwise how can I give you a better future? Do you understand? - Yes, alright. You can't change your mind after two days. - No. What? - No. So what do you say? - Yes. Later, you can't say: "I don't want to stay." The money l used to pay for you. I had to borrow, and I have to pay it back. I have to buy you clothes and fix up your body. You need makeup too. I need peppy girls. Boring girls don't sell. You're as hot as Bombay chili, as spicy as garam masala. No one in this city dares lock horns with you. How long will you live from turning tricks? How long will you live this way? Hey, taxi driver, your fare is 100takas. You drive back and forth. That's your own small world. Why should my job bother you so much? I met a madam from here who said: "Come with me. You can earn 500takas a month. 'You'll have a job and a room for yourself and your child." I came and saw all of this. But I didn't know anything about prostitution. At first I didn't understand why there were so many men. What were all these men doing here? I didn't understand any of it. Slowly l began to figure it out. When I came here, my hair was very long. They cut it and gave me new clothes. They fixed me up. My first client. He was very brutal. I'd never experienced anything like it. I knew how a wife treats her husband. But being with strangers? I didn't understand, but gradually I learned everything. Don't do everything a client asks of you. Tell him: "I sell my body but not my soul." Politely say: "You may use me up to a certain point." "I cannot go beyond my limits." "I am not a slave you can buy."Understand? "You cannot cross the lines I have set." If a client wants you to put his cock into your mouth, say: "No, my mouth is holy. It recites the Sutras of the Koran." Do you understand? - Yes. Let's assume you have hugged a man and tried to arouse him, but he still can't get an erection. Then you wait and let him touch you all over. You let him fondle your breasts until he is hard. Then you put the condom on his cock, lie down, and spread your legs. When he sees you like that, he will get horny. He will push your knees apart, and penetrate you, with your legs around him. How much? - 100. Who got hit? The crazy girl. We're not as envious as they are. Yes you are! Stop criticizing the other girls. You're all the same. - No, they're not as bad. Don't praise them. That bitch is so envious. No customers all day and finally one came along. She wanted him, but he wanted Ruma. She was desperate for business. I told him: "Ruma isn't here, but I have another girl. "She hasn't had a customer all day. Go to her. "If you have friends, send them to that other one." Listen to her wail. Don't beat her anymore. Her crying is going to drive customers away. Hey Mina! Is your client still in there? Rita should have been her madam. Rita would have stripped her naked and spread her legs, shown her pussy to everyone, then tied her to the toilet. She wouldn't have fed her until late night. And I scold the cook, when my girls haven't had breakfast by 7 or 8! That's why they are such fat cunts. You bitch at clients. They pay for sex and have to listen to your bitching. You think there is a shortage of good whores here? Are your cunts so special? Stuck-up idiot! Does she think she's Miss World? She's got the face of a monkey. Monkey face! Get up and dress, idiot. Right now! I'm getting rid of you! Change into your own clothes. Go back where you came from. You, get up! Wash your hands and face. All the sandals I've bought you! Wash your hands and face! Watch it! Ill whip you! I wont fight anymore. I don't want you anymore. Why stay with me? Go back where you came from. Look at the shit I have to put up with! Get out! - Forgive me! Forget it. My mother wasn't a whore. If you dont work, I cant feed you. I'll try harder. - Fuck that. Take your things down and get dressed. Now! Make me mad and my hand will do the talking. Get dressed. Two customers came in and I said: "I've got them." But Ruma wanted them. She grabbed them, but I didn't want to let go. One wanted to stay. She tried to take him with force. I said: "He's mine." Madam came and slapped me in the face twice. Then she told Ruma: "This is your fault." She told me: "You know Ruma is always jealous." After she hit me she told me: "You stay here and I'm going to send Ruma back." But she still wont get any customers. She just stands there. I know it was my mistake. Thats why I got slapped. I sometimes had good, sometimes bad customers. Some customers treated me well. I spend a lot of time waiting. But some days I have no customers at all. I am sad when I don't have customers. And my madam gets angry and scolds me. Most of my customers have been good to me. There's something else I'd like to say. We women are actually very unhappy creatures. It is very hard to survive as a woman. Why do women have to suffer this much? Isnt there another path for us? Is there a path at all? Who can truly answer this question? I used to get so many clients. More than you can imagine. Now I'm older, and business is slow. It's hard for me. Time doesn't stop. I've grown old, and that makes this life hard. No clients wait for me. She knows they hound me every day. Nothing but trouble! Try and earn your keep! Every evening they come here and squeeze me dry. And she acts like a queen and doesnt turn a single trick. There aren't any men. What can I do? I give the collectors everything and they still complain. We only eat when you work! I give the collectors everything I have, but they won't leave me alone. That whore is the worst! She just wiggles her ass. I'm going to whip your ass, bitch. They turn off the power every night at the same time. Click, and it's gone. Then the landlord goes around, collecting the rent from everyone. He gets angry with me. He wants me to vacate my room. Since I have no clients, he wants me to move out. He yells at me and humiliates me. I endure all this. Where else can I go? I have nowhere to go. In order to crush the Devils head you need the power of God In order to crush the Devils head you need the power of God Crush him! Crush him! Crush him with Your power. Crush him! Crush him! Crush him with Your power The blood of Christ has the power! The blood of Christ has the power! The blood of Christ has the power! The blood of Christ has the power! In His name Glory! In His name! Glory! I'll tell you about the girls! I like to come to the Zone because I like the tall, skinny chicks with their red panties. Fucking makes me feel good. I come here once a week. I like to fuck them in the ass, but they charge more. I like pounding ass, fucking, blowjobs. I like everything. What about you? I like coming to the Zone because our girlfriends don't do what these girls do. These girls aren't as uptight, they do anything you can imagine. They let you finger them and fuck them in the ass. Sometimes I pay to watch them masturbate. I like to watch. It gets me hot so I feel like fucking them. What about you? I like to eat their pussies. But theyve been fucking lots of other guys. I like the young ones, the high school girls. I like to eat their pussies. And I like to fuck them in the ass. - But then they fart. I peel off their thongs with my teeth and eat them out. I like chicks here and I like tattoos, gringo. Look! THEZONE Reynosa, Mexico You could have brought me hot chocolate! Today we say farewell. Who knows until when? Perhaps for the rest of our days. Someday we might remember how much we meant to each other, that we loved each other. But today we are only acquaintances. And if we should meet again on a street one evening, you will pick up your pace, and I will cross the street, as if l hadn't seen you. Here we get Hondurans, Cubans, Guatemalans, Americans, Israelis, Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Puerto Ricans, Venezuelans. From everywhere. I've fucked men from all over the world. I've worked in Cancun, Tijuana, Veracruz, Tampico, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Agua Prieta, Mexicali, and Mexico City. Many places. But always in brothels. I don't have a steady boyfriend or lover. But I'm human, a woman, and I'm not frigid. I like cocks. I get horny, I have orgasms. I get paid for it, and I enjoy it. I'm paid to have fun! Come here, baby. I'll show you a goodtime. I've never fallen in love with a client. No, it's against my rules. Even if they have a superstar or a super model at home, they come here because it's different. Steak and fries gets boring if you eat it daily. You don't eat steak and fries every day either. She can be fat or short, as long as she's different. Because sex with the same woman gets boring. Hey, sweetie! How about a blowjob? Almighty Father, I offer myself to you that thy will be done. Release me from my servitude and my selfishness. Help me to achieve all this, I put myself in your hands. Amen. You're nervous. I can feel it. I'm drawing the evil from your body. Yes. I free you from black magic and spells. Almighty Father! Holy Death! Here and now. I thank you for releasing me from evil spells, from black magic, from witchcraft, from illness. Prayer to Holy Death. Lord, in your divine presence, Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I beg for your permission to turn to my Most Holy Death, my White Lady". You Glorious and powerful Goddess of Death, I beg you, my protector and master, grant me this favor. Invincible woman that you are, I implore you, make Carlito fall deeply in love with me so that he sees not on my appearance but the beauty of my soul. May he come to me submissive, faithful and on his knees. Lord, in your divine presence, Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I beg for your permission to turn to my Most Holy Death, my White Lady". You Glorious and powerful Goddess of Death, I beg you, my protector and master, grant me this favor. Invincible woman that you are, I implore you, make Juan Pablo fall deeply in love with me so that he sees not on my appearance but the beauty of my soul. May he come to me submissive, faithful and on his knees. Lord, in your divine presence, Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I beg for your permission to turn to my Most Holy Death I got this Holy Death tattoo to help me die a good death. If you want to go, you go. If not, you stay. That's all. Your mind is your prison. That's how l've always looked at it. I can check out if l want; if not, I stay. That's all. If she doesnt take your life, you have to do it yourself. That one fucks good. Fantastic. Real nice. And she sucks cock without condoms. Thats what I like most. Cheers, my friend! Hi, Mamacita! Bitch! I like to come here and get drunk. All these hot asses. It's great! Not many whores out today, too cold. Ill turn around. I'm going to fuck one of these whores real good tonight. Mamacitas! Goddamn, bitches! I'm horny as hell. Fucking whores! These bitches can be fucking sluts sometimes. Yes or no, babe? They're scared of my huge rod. Green-eyed cat, you little slut. This place is nice. But it's deserted today. Too cold. Fucking shit. The fucking street is full of potholes. Fucking Zone! But if you want to fuck, this is the place. These girls are hot. He there! How's it going? I love these girls. They sure knowhow to move! It costs 100 pesos. 200to fuck. 200 includes everything. Blow job and everything. Anal and everything. But with a condom. Fucking AIDS! Fucking whores! Nobody here today. Not even the bitch in room 124. She fucks like a dream. Fantastic. That one, holy shit! The queen! They're scared. That one is hot! I'm crazy about 147, but it doesn't look like she's working. Too cold for her. I'll cruise the Zone tomorrow to fuck her. I promise. Hey sugar, how much? - 500. For everything? - Blowjob and fuck . Where's your room? Let's go! I'm a virgin because they say after 90 days the vagina closes up again if you don't have sex. The last time I had a cock in me was 3 years ago. I'm retired from cocks. But for 25 years, I was number one. I used to have40 johns a day. I sucked and fucked. How? I showed my tits: Chocolate and Vanilla. Come here, daddy. These, like this. I showed my tits and said: "Come and get it!" Chocolate and Vanilla for a tit fuck. But blow jobs were my specialty. I gave rim jobs and frozen blowjobs. What are those? A blow job with an ice cube. You put a piece of ice in your mouth, then you suck on the head of his cock with your tongue and the ice. You run your lips over his veins and balls, with the ice cube still in your mouth. You maneuver the ice cube over his head and nibble on it. Then you jerk him off and rim him, sticking the ice cube up his ass. Rimming is the best because it makes them moan. If his asshole is dirty, prepare a bowl of chlorine. Wipe it clean with a towel. If it's still not clean, bleach it! If it doesn't stink anymore, you can put the ice in his hole. Once the ice is in there, they bleat like goats. They roll their eyes and bleat. Works on everyone. Like a vibrator. Job done! Generally, when a man comes here, he is only interested in coming. The woman doesn't matter. They come here like animals. They enter. They want you ready. 100 pesos for normal sex. Normal means they spread your legs, they climb on top and fuck. Many want to kiss, but it's disgusting. Their breath can smell like they ate a lion. Or they take off their socks and it stinks like toe cheese. But you just bear it. 100 pesos is money. Now every time you change positions, it costs another 50 pesos. We did everything for 100 in my day, back when I was still working as a whore. When I worked, I wasnt just any whore, I was THE whore. What did I do? Doggie style, for example. You get down on all fours and his balls are dangling. I dont want my delicious drink to fall over. He's standing over you with his balls swinging like church bells. Like the bells in an old village church. Then there is the fake fuck. You climb on top of him and wrap your hand around his cock. But before that, you put lubricant all over your hand. Then you moan and act like it's real. 'Yeah, Daddy, that feels so good." He thinks he's inside you, fucking you. Poor fool. It's all just a trick. There are lots of tricks, for blowjobs too. Lubricate your neck for his cock to rub. Play with his balls with his cock on your neck. He thinks it's in your mouth, but it's not. In the old days we worked without condoms. Blow jobs were raw. Disgusting! You think you're getting fresh baby milk. Or yogurt, but some guys gave a mouthful of sour cream. One guy squirted chunks of cheese! But it was money. They would come in your face, your its or ass. Messy. I'm a proud person, and I dont want people to see me cry. And I tell everyone: "Look at me!" "A napkin please!" "I need to cry." "I need to cry." And then I do this so I don't have to show that I'm really crying. "I'm crying!" What a clown I am! A clown with a happy face. The whole world thinks I am laughing, but inside my heart is crying. So I do this, and I am being ironic. But I dont want anyone to see me cry. No matter what the situation is. You want to hide your feelings. But you aren't even crying. - No, I'm not crying. Who says you are crying? People cry tears of happiness too, right? Once when I was down and out you gave me clothes. You had to hide the bag full of clothes. You took the bag over there so the others wouldnt see. I said, that's okay, I'm not ashamed. And when the tears fall off, l just use a little spit and stick them back on. I'd rather have the others see these tears. - Unbelievable! Its the truth! The tears are real! The pimps come from Tenancingo, Puebla, Tlaxcala. Lots are from Tenancingo or San Pablo del Monte. They usually spend a week in villages, looking for naive girls. This works for them because the girls see all that money for the first time. The pimps promise them a better life. It's easy for the pimps to persuade them. They show them affection or actually pretend to love them. And the girls end up staying with them. Or the pimps threaten to hurt their families and children. And then there's no escape. Some of the men use black magic. They put a spell on the girls' underwear. And then they can't leave anymore. Some clients send their sons. These young men are really well-behaved. They come to us and tell us their fathers sent them. We come here because. - We want to fuck. We want anal sex. We want to pound ass! And sometimes it's cheap, but sometimes those crazy bitches charge too much. And cops wait outside the gate. - To bust us, those cocksuckers! And make us pay. This guy likes older women. Why? They're a good fuck. They know what to do. Ooh Baby! You're still a fuckin' faggot. Once a father came with his son. He had just turned fifteen. He wanted his son to feel like a real man. I was supposed to make his first time a good experience. I treated him right. He went away happy because we took our time. He was so happy. His father came and thanked me. And later the boy came back again too. He brought a friend. He told his friend: "This woman took my virginity." "She turned me into the man I am today." Once I had a client. He was totally in love with me. He wanted to marry me. He was young and still single, but he was extremely fat. And I wasn't in love with him. He told me he would do everything in his power to make me to fall in love with him. I said: "Okay." "Fine, whatever." After a while he came back and he had had an operation. He was very skinny and said: "Look at me." "This is the way you like your men." And I said: "What did you do? Are you crazy?" He said: "I did it because I love you." I said: "Oh no! You shouldn't have done that." "You're crazy. That's not right." "It doesn't matter," he said. "I did it for you." "Because I love you." I said: "I'm sorry, I can't. "I can't lie to you." How should I explain it? "I can't be phony and pretend I love you. "Truth is, I don't love you." I dont want to trick people by pretending I love them. Maybe you can fool a client for a while, but thats all. But with love? I cant fake love. No. Not with people who really mean something to me. I want to be honest. It should come from the heart. You are Like a precious stone Like divine jewel Truly valuable My eyes don't deceive me My eyes don't deceive me My eyes don't deceive me Your beauty is unequalled How's it going, sugar? - How are you? How much? 100 pesos. For everything? Different positions cost extra. We discuss it inside. Look what you get. 100 please. 100 plus what? You pay extra for different positions. How much? Depends on what you want. A blow job costs 100. Sex in different positions costs another 200. So altogether 300. I'll give you 200. No, 300. I just have 200, girl. - Alright. But then be fast. For 200 its fast, okay? - Okay. Do I pay afterwards? - No, now. The condom is the most important thing. Double wrapped? What's your name? We don't ask that here. Last position. If you don't come, it's not my problem. Okay? That's it, honey, 20 minutes. Already? - Yeah. That quick? - If you want more, it costs more. I don't have anymore. - Sorry. Come back with more money and I'll do whatever you want. You didnt tell me your name. No names here, honey. Just between us. Forget it. Why? - Just because. It was good, babe. - Thanks. Open the door! See you. - Bye. Who is the saint for? - No one. Who is the saint for? - No one. To honor her. - Right. I swore I'd get tattooed, but I never did. One day in the Baston Bar, I had just finished working all day and night, I went to my room and spoke to her: "Please don't let anyone harass me anymore." She appeared to me that day. And no one has harassed me since. I call that awesome. If she were here, I'd eat her pussy. And besides. You want me to say that again? She helps you die a good death. She takes you by the hand. But she brings you back too, even from the Devil himself. You bet your balls. That's the truth. We've tried it ourselves. How many times have we killed ourselves? And then she says: "Arent you smoking crack today?" And I say: "Nooo." Or Ill turn into a demon. But thats not what it's about. Why are you acting like this? - Because its true. Why are you so different? - Because I want to be and I can, and because my pussy is driving me crazy. Yes sir! Smoke this, silly. - Look at my sneakers. They suck. I'll buy you new ones tomorrow. If not, I'll buy myself new ones. Okay? Should we continue? Next lesson! Oh shit. You're terrible. Don't be chicken. Shit. Do you want to fight? Dont talk about the Zone. Why not? This place is the pits, but you stay and suck cock and smoke crack. True, but it's none of your business. I can smoke and let myself go if l want. I deserve it. Nothings free around here. - No one gives me anything. Just when they stick their cocks into me. I gave you something. I came into my room and there was money lying there from her. "For you." "Go get yourself a rock of crack." And what did I want? What did I want? Tell them what I wanted, bitch. But I said: "Hey bitch, now heres my money." "And you eat my pussy." Did I do it? - No. I'm not into that. You'd fall in love with me if l ate your pussy. All that aside, here's to good times and good vibes. I'm not kidding. We're losers. Heres to good times! - Yeah. It's December. Christmas Eve. Presents for the whole family. And us? We're getting fucked. With the residents of Faridpur in the CITYOF JOY, the residents of Reynosa in the ZONE, the ladies and staff at the FISHTANKS in Bangkok. And all the clients everywhere. No one wanted to be mentioned by name. Following the sign to Camp Crystal Lake can only mean one thing. bad luck. For her, not for us. You see in 1980 when producer/director Sean Cunningham released a little film into the world called "Friday the 13th," not even he could have imagined the success or the fame or the carnage that would ensue. With 12 movies to date, an endless body count and over a half billion in worldwide box-office dollars, "Friday the 13th" gave birth to one of the greatest cinematic villains of our time. She doesn't know what she's in for. So lock up your cabin doors, zip up your tents and make sure that your car does indeed start, because tonight he could be anywhere. So you wondering who I'm talking about? His name was Jason. For some of us, the problems we have as adults go back to our mothers. In the case of Jason, truer words were never spoken. Kill kill kill. In the late '70s, Steve Miner and I had made a couple of children's movies and neither one of them was very successful. And we had to do something to keep the lights on. And so we came up with this notion of doing "Friday the 13th." We had a title and a need to make some money. The thing about the story is that it's so profoundly simple. The longest part of the process of creating the first "Friday the 13th" was figuring out the venue, so I had to find some territory that was adult-free so that these kids would be on their own and we could pick them off one by one. My character was sort of like the Janet Leigh in "Psycho." I'm the setup character to follow, but I didn't last too long. We ran into the woods where it was safe. We had this notion that these kids would be out at a summer camp and would be threatened by some kind of serial killer. We would then be surprised to discover who the serial killer was at the end. Mrs. Voorhees, who is mighty pissed off that her son Jason drowned while a couple of counselors were off boning somewhere. The counselors weren't paying any attention. They were making love while that young boy drowned. The scariest moment in the original movie is when Alice realizes that Pamela is the killer. Kill her, Mommy! Kill her! And that's the beginning of the chase at the end of the movie. And when we think all is quiet and she survived that horrible Friday the 13th. The boy, is he dead too? Who? The one who attacked me, the one who pulled me underneath the water! Ma'am, we didn't find any boy. Then he's still there. And he certainly was. Before we started filming "Part 2," they had us watch the original "Friday the 13th," which almost scared me off to not doing the project, 'cause it really freaked me out. After the first one Jason had been created, so the notion of having a surprise as to who it is or what it is changed completely. So what the stories became was sort of a ritualized telling of a group of young people who go someplace where they shouldn't go. What are you kids doing out here? We come back to Crystal Lake to open up this camp again. The ghost of the past, Jason comes to haunt them. And one by one, Jason Voorhees kills us and continues to do what he does best. "Part 2" was basically his journey of seeking revenge over the death of his mother. And he's got her decapitated head on his mantelpiece. He just keeps killing and killing. And that's the journey that's taken us for 30 years. It's remarkable. I really thought it wasn't gonna work the way it did, and I'm delighted to have been so wrong. "Friday the 13th Part III". we get the gimmick movie. "Friday the 13th III" in 3D, and that is also the movie where Jason will choose his infamous mask. The day after the events in "Part 2". so it's technically Saturday the 14th, but don't tell anyone. a group of teenagers all go up to the cabin to visit Chris Higgins, little knowing that Jason is still out there killing everyone. Ugh! Through all the 3D movies I've ever done, nobody talks about any of them. All they ever wanna talk about is when can we see "Friday the 13th" in 3D. Four is where things start getting interesting. It starts to introduce a protagonist Tommy Jarvis, who we'll start seeing in other sequels. I was told that this was gonna be the last of the series. And this again would be about death at the end, because Jason was going to die. Jason had been hit in the head with an axe. He had been carted off in an ambulance. We pick him up almost in real time arriving dead at a hospital. And then Jason breaks out of the morgue. Leave me alone! And then the kids in the car arrive at the lake and bump into us. There's skinny-dipping - and all kinds of things. - Partying. we're partying on down and then we all got killed. In very quick succession. My character Rob had a sister named Sandra, who was a counselor at Crystal Lake in "Part 2." This dude looks like he's been hunting Jason for years. The one time I saw the movie. going to the opening night screening on Hollywood Boulevard. during the whole entire movie just people screaming, it was like this cathartic experience for everybody. It's a thrill ride. I remember that we're supposed to think Corey Feldman's gonna pick up the torch and be the next Jason. "Part 5" was truly a departure because they went in a totally different direction. They decide they're gonna set it in a halfway house for weird fucked-up kids. And there's this dude and he's killing the kids off and he's using Jason's mask. We don't see Jason in that movie, except for hallucinations, flashbacks. that's it. When the film opened it was opening, I think, in 2,000 theaters across the country. In 1984, that was a lot. Frank Mancuso called me late that night. 2:00, 3:00 in the morning, so excited, saying these numbers are like the golden times. This is unheard of. When the supposed Jason fell, I love the part where he just goes right through those spikes. Because you can just see the dummy just going right on the spike. Another piece of advice, don't allow the overweight mentally-handicapped son of the local ambulance driver to get hacked to shit over a candy bar. Because chances are that driver's gonna turn into a Jason clone and try to take people out. They brought him back again in "VI," and he killed Horshack at the beginning, which was awesome. And he was kind of like Frankenstein because a lightning bolt that came out of nowhere brought him back to life, and there was maggots on his face, which was really cool. I think it was extremely violent. I mean, you look at it and you go, "Wow, there's tongue-in-cheek in this. There's rock music in this." But Jason, in fact, in this movie, bends people in half, twists their heads off, does a triple beheading. I really didn't want it to be just about you have sex and die, 'cause that had been done. It's sort of like you're in the wrong place at the wrong time kind of thing, and also try to have the characters have a sense of humor. When Nancy's killed and the American Express card floats out of her hand, inevitably there was always some clown that would go, "Don't leave home without it!" In "Part VII," the girl whose got these extraordinary telekinetic powers resurrects him by throwing her anger and her energy into the lake where he's already been killed from a previous movie. She musters all of her telekinetic ability to raise him and thus begins the story. That's what really made it different. She had the psychic abilities which he had not fought before, but realistically, the psychic stuff would have had to have been in there anyway, because this monster kept coming back. He's a surreal monster. Jason, played by Kane Hodder, I believe, for the first time. "VII" starts the Kane Hodder era. Everything about the way Kane Hodder played him makes him menacing and yet he's human. I remember thinking, "Wow, this is Jason!" I grew up watching this, and here he is chasing me. Since I was doing it for the first time, there seems to be some anger there, some differences that you didn't see in Jason before. The kids love Kane Hodder's Jason. The coolest teaser trailer to a movie ever was " Friday the 13th 8: Jason Takes Manhattan." You get this trailer where you don't know what is it and then they reveal that it's Jason in the middle of the city. I live in New York. I was stoked. I was like, "Oh my God. He's coming to New York. He's coming to where I know." When they first brought me in to do the movie, the first question I asked them was does it have to be in Crystal Lake? Can I take Jason out of Crystal Lake? The general plot of "Friday the 13th Part 8" is a young woman and her graduating class of Crystal Lake High going on a big cruise to New York. One by one, the classmates are killed off. The single most amazing thing that I've ever done as the character was shooting the scenes in Times Square in "Jason Takes Manhattan." I felt like a rock star. "Part 9".they went from not having blood to not having Jason. There was something about Jason transferring from body to body to body. Then Jason comes back to life and to Crystal Lake and is exploded and becomes a bunch of demon-hearted baby things and decides to possess a couple of people. And then gets thwarted again by " 21 Jump Street" himself Steven Williams. He really wasn't in the movie. It was kind of other people. Then if he was in a mirror, you could see him. And he could transport into bodies. But the best part was when he was this little worm thing and he went. was it the girl from "Buck Rogers"? Is that who she was? He went in her pussy and that was awesome. They basically tried to create a mythology for Jason. There are a lot of Jason fans who to this day are pissed off at me for blowing up Jason. "Jason X" takes place 400 years in the future. And a group of science students, kids go on a field trip. These students go on. They're on the planet. They're digging things up, and of course they find Jason. Anyway, Jason wakes up and of course does what Jason does. We set it up that Kay-Em actually did kill him. This time he got killed, right? Then the nanobots bring him together and now he's part machine, and so he's more unstoppable than ever. To this day, still, when people mention that movie, they're like, "I love that fake boob scene!" All right, the story of "Freddy vs. Jason" is a hybrid story. You're bringing these two great characters together finally. It took them literally decades before they came up with a story that was strong enough to support these two characters. The premise of this movie was for Freddy to use Jason to get his powers back. There came a point where you had to choose a side. And I was a Jason guy, always. So for "Jason vs. Freddy," I didn't wanna see anything but Jason kick Freddy's ass. If it wasn't for Alice killing Mrs. Voorhees in that one film, none of this would happen. I like Jason Voorhees. He has a backstory, and he has a reason for being the way he is. What a messed up kid. I think that just in the overall energy of trying to do it simple and scary was the thing that drove the whole process forward. After all that, who could imagine that Jason, the bloodthirsty indestructible force of nature, was at one time an innocent kid just like the rest of us? Well, most of us. Jason not only witnessed his mother's beheading. But he was shot and stabbed and burned and sent to hell and shot into outer space. I think to really understand Jason you gotta go back to the beginning. who he is, where he came from, why he can't resist a good kill. Kill kill kill. Does Jason have a soul? I don't think so. He is not mindless. I think actually that's something that the fans would like to learn more about. what's going on in his head. Jason started as a drowning victim. That's as simple as you can make it. He's just a little boy who was ignored by his camp counselors and couldn't swim very well and drowned. And no matter what movie you're talking about, he's still a victim. For any good villain, there's always that sadness to them, and that thing where you can almost feel bad for them. He didn't do anything wrong. He didn't deserve to die. Jason was the outcast. Jason was the little kid who got picked on. And now Jason's the one who's getting the last laugh in a way, or the last slash. Who did it start with? His mother. I'm Mrs. Voorhees, an old friend of the Christies. The fact that she's a loon, totally out of her mind and also channeling her son and going. Kill her, Mommy. Kill her! The idea for the character came out of my own past. Mrs. Voorhees is the mother I never had. She is the mother who will kill people to avenge her son's death. But, hey, if you're gonna have a mother defend you, she might as well be crazy. They love Mrs. Voorhees. And I've said to people, I say, " Why do you love her as much as you do when she's supposed to be this dreadful human being?" And they say because we understand why you did it. Mrs. Voorhees was really not a murderess. All she was trying to do was to protect other children from being drowned. One of the things that really works for "Part 2" is that you do have this kind of passing of the baton going from Mrs. Voorhees to Jason. Basically, he is fueled by vengeance for the death of his mother. See, it's this seeking righteous vengeance that defines the Jason character and also separates Jason Voorhees from all the other horror icons. Jason's misunderstood. What happens is when he watches Alice kill his mother, I believe Alice unleashes the monster in Jason. You feel bad for anybody who has to see their mom get their head cut off on a beach. I know I do. So he finds this potato sack, throws it over his head, cuts out his little eyehole and does his thing. He starts plying his craft for the first time that he learned from his mom. I think he observed the camp after many years, kids coming and going. I think at one point that's when he decided to do what he did. I think what he's doing is protecting his home. And anybody that walks into his territory is kind of doomed. Honestly, I don't think he's angry. I think he's sad. Poor Jason was brought into this world and he really had a tough start. If your mother killed a bunch of people, you would be a very tragic child, I would say. It's like kind of a Ted Bundy upbringing. Here was this tortured soul who lived for years just on probably the revenge. I think Ginny kind of understood there's more to it than just this demon guy. Jason, Mother is talking to you. By putting on his mother's sweater and trying to speak like her, it almost confused him for a second. You see him questioning, is that my mother? He wanted to believe his mother was still alive. I guess Jason was a unique character. He wasn't just somebody who put on a facemask. He was a whole creature. It's almost like Jason is a personification of the dark side of all of us. I find in this character elements of myself. And there are monstrous elements of myself that are bent on self-destruction and destroying others. And there are parts of myself that feel wronged and I'm unjustly treated and I'm the victim. He just hated everything about people. His reason for killing is just because he does. Don't reason with him. He doesn't reason with you. It's all in his own head. He just does it. He's definitely a tortured tragic soul, but the truth is you can't go around life with this badge that you've been tortured and kill and slash. At some point, it's gotta stop. The main aspect that enhances the otherworldly character of Jason is that he's silent and faceless. like death. the death mask. It's plenty scary, the mystery of the unknown. What is behind that potato sack? In "Friday the 13th Part III," Jason wears, for the very first time, a hockey mask, which he has taken from Shelly when Shelly made the bad mistake of walking into the barn carrying the hockey mask. And the moment when he puts on the hockey mask and realizes it, it's a great moment for the franchise, 'cause it's like, "What was I thinking? I should have been wearing this all along. This is awesome." This dock behind me, this is where the legend of Jason was born. This is the first time we saw him step out in the hockey mask. The birth of Jason. There's something to be said about putting a mask on and doing things that you wouldn't normally do with that mask off. Jason in "Part III" runs. That's the one where he runs. Jason's a bit of a manic hillbilly in "III" still. Got a little of that left over. After that he becomes the slow methodical stalker. If he sees you, he's not gonna stop. It's like a beacon. Once he's popped in on you, he's gonna stay there until he kills you. And it doesn't matter what he has to use. He's terribly creative. And he's got lots of weapons. He really had a thing for knives, and he really had a thing for machetes. He likes to puncture through the body. He really likes spears. .sawing off heads, twisting heads, crushing heads. He was really into anything that would splash blood. .punching heads off, eyes popping out. I mean, he's a showman. It was really about watching Jason do his thing. He was the protagonist in these films. He has become an anti-superhero. So we just gotta come up with a cape for the Big J. If we can just get him to do some good stuff, though, you know? He's got the killing down. Jason's always been the underdog, and everybody roots for the underdog. It's every nerd's dream to get killed and them come back as a bad-ass and start taking out all the stereotypes that pick on nerds. - Why do you do these stupid things? - I have to. I think he's a little bit of a madman, perhaps. Well, he seems a little superhuman also because he seems to be able to revive and take almighty blows with hatchets and stuff. Jason is a kid who's just too stupid to know that he's dead. I think it's always kind of inventive how we would bring Jason back. I always loved that. It was almost like the cliffhangers in the old serials. How does he live to see another day? Something's gotta bring him back. Why not lightning, right? We can blow him up. We can cut him up. We can shoot him up. We can dice him up, and he comes back for more. It's great that as times change, audiences change. The creature, the monster, the villain, I think is allowed to evolve. Jason is the 21st-century killer. He's good old blood and guts. I think that Jason is both a monster and a victim. This is a very deep character that survived this many episodes in killings and destructions because he's larger than life. He's still that little troubled mentally-ill boy trapped in the large body of a killing machine. He's become iconic in our lives. Jason has no expiration date. 12 movies in three decades? That's enough sequels to rival box-office legends like James Bond or Godzilla. "Friday the 13th" defined what is considered the modern-day slasher. Looking at this guy, it's no wonder why. But you know what? It takes more than a body count to make a "Friday the 13th" movie. The formula is pretty specific with a "Friday the 13th" movie. The first thing you need in a "Friday the 13th" film is nubile young flesh. You have a bunch of teenagers and they cannot be accessible by adult power authorities. They can't come in and save them. You have to have a reason for the kids to be out in the woods. It's the " Let's run out into the woods," and, " Ooh! There's a killer loose." The crazy old bastard. I'm the messenger of God. You're doomed if you stay here. These movies are made for teenagers. And so the point of view is that anyone who is over a certain age or in a position of authority cannot be trusted, because that's how teenagers feel. They have almost, like, one of each type of personality. So that no matter who you are looking at the movie, you can relate to one of those characters. We want to have these sort of beautiful teenagers but which include all the stereotypes. You know, the fat guy and the high school jock and the pretty cheerleader and then the girl with brown hair who is sort of soulful. The obnoxious teenager who you just want to die so bad, and when he dies, you all cheer. I think every "Friday the 13th" has to have the "promiscuous" girl who is caught doing something naughty and she pays. She's usually the first one to go. And then they are picked off one by one and you have to figure out as many different ways of making the teenagers dumb without being really stupid. Because the great thing about "Friday the 13th" and other horror films is it gives a lot of people in the audience a chance to be way smarter than the characters. There has to be teenagers having sex and getting killed while they're having sex. Jason likes to get you when you're that much aroused. It's like he takes your sexual energy, then he fucks you with his machete. For the most part, the less sex you have, the higher chance you have of living. Also has to be in the film: a pair of breasts every 15 minutes. It's show time. We were kind of short on the breast thing, I think. I can only count about three. Three breasts? We need more. I needed the T&A for me. To hell with the audience. And then of course, the important ingredient is Jason. Jason is an unstoppable force of nature. It's interesting how he could just walk and nobody could ever get away from him. It also kind of seems like he's everywhere at once. at one time. He notices everybody all of a sudden when they're just gonna have a great time. And if you go back and remember what it was that caused Jason's drowning, it was teenagers canoodling and not watching. If you're screwing, you get killed. We weren't doing anything. We were just messing ar. ugh! You have sex, die. That's the premise. That's the underlying theme going through the "Friday the 13th" movies. I didn't have sex until I was 30 because of Jason. That motherfucker was the best contraceptive a guy like me could have. Slasher movies particularly are like Broadway musicals. You can't go too long without a song. You can't go more than 10 minutes without a kill. Kids went to see these movies to see kids get killed. The kills have to be interesting and unique. And even the cast, the kids would come up to us, "How am I gonna die?" I think that's what audiences came to see. How is the next guy gonna get it? Help, somebody help me! It's pure fantasy and we know it's fantasy. These films are better than the gory modern killing films that are made to look so realistic. Usually at the end of the movie there's some sort of a jump scare. The famous ending scene was not in the original script. They really didn't have an ending so I said to Sean, "Why don't we have Jason jump out of the lake and attack her?" Alice has this look of hope and she's just trailing her fingers in the water. And at the moment when the strings just swell. Bam! That's where the trick is played. The reason I think this has gone is it transcends a lot of different ages. And the music is important because you're sort of heightened and scared just with the music and the visual all at the same time. Music and score is another character. It's every bit as important as Jason. Harry Manfredini took the minimalist approach and it works to a perfect effect. Music in a horror movie is crucial. It can make or break a film, and his score in that movie was just untouchable. Kill kill kill kill. - No no, that doesn't sound right. - That's not good. Let's start again. And if you go to the end of the film, you'll see a very close-up of Betsy Palmer's Mrs. Voorhees' mouth, where she's saying to herself, " Kill her, Mommy. Kill her, Mommy." And it goes back and forth between her voice and supposedly Jason's voice. And I said, "Bingo, that's it." So then I just went and I took the consonant sound of the K, "ki" from killer and "ma" from mommy. I went up to a microphone and just went "ki. ma." And we ran it through something called an echoplex, and it ended up coming. When you hear that. you know you've got a"Friday the 13th" movie. It created all the conventions of the slasher films that followed, pretty much using the template that was established on that first film in 1980. Obviously, Jason Voorhees is a true worldwide icon. One could say that he's as famous as the Beatles or Madonna, a veritable rock-star slasher if there ever was one. And what rock star would be complete without a greatest-hits compilation? Does Jason have one, you ask? Let's ask this guy. What are you doing, douchebag? So Jason will kill with anything he could get his hands on. It was another one that you sit in the audience and watch it with a crowd and everyone just goes, "Oh, dude!" The obvious most memorable moment is with Kevin Bacon. He's like on his knees under the bed. Me and my buddy Taso are under there and I'm pushing the arrow through and Taso was pumping the blood, but an accident occurred. The tubes separated from Taso's pump, so he grabbed it and blew in it. That's what made the blood shoot out and gurgle. My favorite kill of all: Mrs. Voorhees slo-mo. It doesn't get better than that. The ultimate kill by Alice. We actually made a cast of Betsy Palmer's head. I attached it with toothpicks. So the toothpicks were just kind of holding it in place, knowing that when I whacked it with that machete, it would go through the toothpicks. But if you watch the movie when Betsy Palmer is decapitated, her hands come up into frame and kind of like a grabbing there. They're Taso's hands with hairy knuckles. I don't have hair on the back of my hands like he did. I thought that was a little weird in one shot. One of the things that turned out wildly effective was the back-cracking of the sheriff character. They dug a hole and those weren't my legs. They had a guy head down in the hole with his legs behind me. But just that whole idea of bending somebody all the way back and hearing all this. sound drove them crazy. A little sound design, a little screaming, it all turned out great. Wheelchair death in "Part 2," that was just fucked up. He already gets your sympathy 'cause you're like, "Oh, he's in a wheelchair." But then he's gonna get laid. And then Jason just goes, "You're screwed!" And not only does he get hit in the face, but he gets pushed backwards down the stairs, and the camera does this great thing where it goes, "Weeee!" I had a track around my neck with a flexible steel blade that pushed from the back and then a false neck over it, which took hours to put on. Of course, I was eating a banana at the time, so they had my mouth full of banana and blood. It was such a messy little death. Now cut that out right now. That's not funny! There was a cable that was actually set up on the post that ran across to where she was standing. The gun was rigged in such a way that I actually hooked the gun onto the cable and shot it so it went straight down the cable. And in 3D with the glasses, it's incredible. We had to do it in one take because the minute I hit the water, the little prosthetic would absorb the water and just kind of slide off. The hedge clippers to the eyes. that girl had the best rack, the best death and her last name really had Voorhees in it. That was a pretty horrific way to go. That shish-kebab scene is so original. They attached this back to me and then put the spear through the latex and had the blood pumping out. And they had a bed which had a hole in it and then she just kind of came in, sat and then put her head back. It looked like I was lying on top of her. Before it got butchered by the ratings board, there was this amazing shot where you saw the real girl doing the last moment that she could have trying to push the guy off of her. It was such an effective disturbing sequence. You imagine Jason down there like, "I can't wait." What about the dude who goes into a handstand and gets the axe right down the middle? He took my head by force and slammed it through the wall of the Winnebago. And how they actually did that is they filmed it underwater. They shot it in slo-mo, pushing through this piece of plastic. You start asking yourself is there something wrong with you when you're spending your day thinking up ways to murder people, - but I got over it. - They used a real spear. And it missed me by a speck. I like it when he crushes heads. We had a string go straight to the eye so we could just pull the string and the eye would pop out of the socket, come straight down the line toward camera. That is horrifically gory, but it's classic Jason. My favorite kill in "Jason X" is where he dunks that chick's head in the ice. We spent a lot of time on that. prepping it. And we not only just storyboarded it out, but we had to have a false sink with the camera underneath and a glass for the water because I wanted to be able to see the face come toward the camera, not frozen. - And then. - Bam! Face salad. That was technically our most difficult kill. I think his favorite thing is smashing heads together. My favorite Jason kill that I've ever done is the sleeping bag. He bashed her against the tree, I think, at least five times, but we minimized it to once. And that was actually more impactful. I cut his brain in half in "Part 4." I created the monster. Thank you for letting me kill the monster. - And this is. - Joseph Zito. - The. - Director of " Friday the 13th - Final Chapter." - I'm Erich Anderson and I played Rob. And we're at the house where we shot the movie. This is really the site of the death of Jason. Right there. We have a big special-effects makeup group. And they're all around. They're all around and they're pumping blood and moving the tongue and working all of the parts. The mask hits the ground, and the machete is picked up here, and Tommy ends up taking the machete and killing Jason to die die die. Tommy! You maybe were expecting something quick. Tommy hits him in the head with the blade, the end? No, he slides down the blade. Not too shabby. But creating Jason's handiwork is never an easy task. Neither was creating Jason Voorhees. I should know. So what does it take to create an unforgettable movie villain? I came up with the idea for Jason's name 'cause originally it was gonna be Josh, but the more I worked on the film and the creepier the whole subject of that got, I stuck with the "J" and went to Jason. Tommy Savini, who of course did all those fabulous special effects, gave me some Polaroids to look at. And he said, "That's your son, Jason. He's a mongoloid." I said, "He's what?" His features were really a guy I used to see in my neighborhood, a homeless drunk guy, one ear was lower than the other. He was almost a Quasimodo kind of guy. The first thing they do is they take a cast of your head. There was fake teeth. There was a glass eye. One thing people often ask is, "Was it specially made to go underwater?" and stuff like that. No, it was just. it was a latex prosthetic. Once I put the bag over my head and I ran in the woods, I couldn't see anything 'cause the bag flopped back and forth. And he came up with this idea. we'll put double-faced tape here and here, and we'll hold it right close to your eye. This way you'll see where you're going, and it worked great. But from taking the tape on and off, I had started to develop burns on my face. First they cut off all your hair, and then they started to build the face with little rubber forms they would glue on. And they sent me to a dentist that created dental plates that would go in that were sort of the worst dental problems anyone could ever have. And they built the beard and the hair, and they taped off the eye. It's sort of painful to have all this stuff put on. The scene of "Friday the 13th: 2" where Jason comes careening through the window. they built a platform outside the house. The platform was probably four feet long. So we coordinated how many steps it takes. So one, two, three. aggh! At the time when this was created, there was a serial killer running around in Texas. And he was killing people with a potato sack on his head. This could have been the inspiration, which I believe the potato sack is a little scarier than the hockey mask, which of course is now iconic. I didn't get any direction from Steve Miner at all. He actually came to me and said, "You're just a mindless killer. You're like the living version of 'Jaws." ' I used to have to go in and do about six, sometimes seven hours of makeup. And it was 11 different appliances that they glued to my face. The bad part about it was that as soon as they'd finished, it was usually lunchtime and I couldn't eat. So they used to give me Tiger's Milk through a straw. Jason in our film was played by Ted White. And his way of keeping the character was kind of separating himself from everybody else. I don't remember really him having a conversation with anybody. I actually turned it down to begin with, and later on I did accept it. After I accepted it, I did go down and rent two of the "Jasons," and I watched Jason itself, how he moved and so forth. And I felt I'd like to play him a little bit different. I'd like for him to move a little bit different. Another way of doing it would be the fast move, to move faster, and that's how I portrayed him. That's what I wanted to do with him. Even when I was in full costume, makeup, everything, I stayed away from the cast completely. I'd sit by myself on the set. I just stayed away from everybody. And I tried to keep in character as much as possible. I liked the mystique of being by myself, not being close to anybody. The scene upstairs where they hit me over the head with a television set, little did I know that that TV set was gonna stay on my head. I had no idea where I was. I couldn't see out of that thing. It was just a hand feeling for the stairway. You know, I was offered the fifth one and sixth one. I could have done either one of them and I turned 'em down. I'm sorry now that I did turn them down. In "5," I actually played an impostor of Jason, and I did have a couple moments where I did play the apparition of Jason himself, where those were supposedly different Jason characters. I just played Jason through the whole movie. In the film, obviously, they had to distinguish in some way so they used the blue for the marks on the mask for the impostor Jason, where when I did the actual Jason I was wearing the real mask with the red marks on it. The makeup with this particular character wasn't too intense. The Jason character, though, was a pullover mask with the face cut out. All they had to do was darken my eyes and then put the hockey mask over it. We never talked about this. It's really not in the script. Any motivation. there isn't any. So I felt Roy was a little disturbed to begin with. The first time I put on the green jumpsuit and the boots and I zipped them up, I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought, "Is this me?" One of the exciting things for me was the creation of Jason's mask. So we took a hockey mask and kind of customized it. We basically redesigned some of the ventilation holes. We created basically a new positive. From the positive, we made a big block rubber mold and from that, created what's called a buck, a heavy-duty cement wedge that on the top of it has the veneer of the hockey mask At that point, using a real heavy duty plastic, we did what's called vacuforming. The vacuforming draws apart and we pull it out and bang, we get Jason's mask. When we portrayed it, he got stronger. Every opportunity of a fight scene or a kill enhanced his knowledge of killing or his strength. Every time he was shot and put down, he came back stronger the next time. You know, Tom was very adamant. He did not want a machine on stage. When you were on set, he wanted to make sure there was some human contact and people could relate to it. Jason just is indestructible. When you put the costume on, you really project it, and the projection had to be through the body. 100% through the body. Just a simplistic little movement would create fear. As soon as the mask comes down, it's very simple to get into the character. Nice thing about it is you get to kill 17, 18 people, you don't go to prison. Every scar, every rip, every tear that Jason ever had was in the Jason that we created for "Part VII." As far as playing the character, I wanted to just do what felt natural. My goal was to just add some more life to the character, even though he is kind of a zombie. People ask me, " Why does the makeup change so much from movie to movie? The hockey mask changes and everything else." Basically, it's because it's a different makeup-effects person who designs it. The first movie I did, "Part VII," the makeup was real extensive, many pieces. It took about three and a half hours a day. It was hard to work in, but fantastic makeup. Über Jason. it was an entire one-piece suit that did have a zipper in the back, but very well concealed. On the suit, it limited my motion a lot with the arm and the leg that had the metallic pieces. I still love the design of that Über Jason mask. He brought a lot to the role. No matter who directed him, no matter what movie he was in, you could tell Kane's Jason from other people's Jason. Having Kane Hodder play Jason four times really established him as Jason. I think stepping into it, I was a little leery, because a lot of the feedback the fans were putting out there was negative, I think, in the beginning. But then when the movie came out, it became very very positive. They were big shoes, but I'm a big guy. I remember the first day he showed up on the set, the first night we shot him, and I turned around, and there he was in full glory. I mean, his boots were like this thick, and then you put on everything else that he's wearing and he was 6'8 ". I'm not kidding you, he scared the hell out of me. My portrayal of Jason showed another side that you don't normally get to see. In "Freddy vs. Jason," you see him actually interact with his mother, and you see him confronted by fears. I just went back to my childhood, and I think I thought a lot about Frankenstein. not really alive, but not really dead. Even if you look at the movements, the walk and stuff like that, I think I used a little bit of Frankenstein. Even though people think he just kind of stands there and lumbers along with his machete, you have to feel that there's a physical force that could actually be as evil and as powerful as he is. Ew! Sorry, buddy. I hope it was over quickly. The truth is, like this guy, most people don't survive their encounter with our murderous mongoloid. Still, there have been a few that gave Jason quite a headache. You know, the people that insist on not going down without a fight. It's a small group, but they certainly gave Jason a big run for his money. Or his machete. So whether it's Alice or it's Ginny or it's Chris or any of these girls who make it to the end, they usually have some common characteristics. The most important is their chastity, their purity. They're generally not there to just party. And as a result, they get rewarded by being able to live through it. It was usually the outcast. It was usually the good girl, the one who didn't smoke pot, who didn't have premarital sex. She was always the one who was able to take him on. And I think that goes back to the most primitive storytelling of just good versus evil. The archetypes for them are the innocent girl next door. I never felt like a victim. As a matter of fact, I felt very empowered by the role. The women were stronger in this film than the guys were. She's a typical, regular gal. She's like any teenager or young adult trying to figure out what they wanna do with their life. She didn't run with the pack and she was different. But that didn't mean she was virtuous. It just meant she thought things through differently. I would love the opportunity to come back. It's so much more satisfying to watch a woman destroy this tremendous evil. Amy Steel, she was just so adorable. She was so girl-next-doorish. She would probably be my all-time favorite "Friday" girl. To know that I did one of these films where they get all these women in that are so vulnerable and to be the one that people think was strong and intelligent is just. it feels good. Ginny was written in a more multidimensional kind of way. And there was something a little bit separate about her than everybody. She didn't need a group of people around her. She was strong enough to stand on her own. She wanted to figure it out. Well, what would it be like today? Some kind of out-of-control psychopath? A frightened retard? A child trapped in a man's body? I think my favorite personally was Lar Park-Lincoln in "Part VII." Just the ability to come in with the mind and to manipulate Jason like she did. I mean, she was equal. The genius convention of adding a character with telekinesis to give Jason a new sort of foil in the final battle was pretty fantastic. One thing that I didn't want to do is I didn't want to play a psychic, or someone who felt they had telekinetic abilities, like they were someone going into a stroke and doing some cartoonish version of what she was dealing with. Lar Park-Lincoln as Tina, she's classic. It was a different take on the story. That character gave it a great brawl. She didn't back down. She never really ran from him. She chased him. And we had that great street scene where she goes right up to him. I love the twigs coming around his legs and taking him down that way. The most worthy opponents of Jason from the movies that I did. certainly Tina has to be there, because she created the most damage to Jason and survived. They also started a trend where like the surviving girl's "love interest" started making it through as well. I'm honored that I was a survivor. If Jason wanted to bring it on again, I'd come back. I would love to tackle her again. Although I think I would do it with better hair serum. So my hair wouldn't be as frizzy as it was throughout the entire shooting of that film. I think of the whole series, I think Tommy Jarvis is probably one of Jason's biggest adversaries. Jason, don't you remember? Remember, Jason? Tommy's an outsider, like Jason. Tommy's a kid that doesn't fit in. So there is a relationship between Tommy and Jason when Tommy takes on the persona and impersonates him as a weapon to undo him. I would love to have gone up against Corey Feldman just 'cause I'd like to squeeze his head until it pops. Tommy had a very unique relationship to Jason because at least at the end of "Part 5," he actually looks like he will become the next Jason. In "Part 4," which Corey Feldman played so beautifully, he ends up in an insane asylum. Is he monster or victim? Well, he's a little bit of both. He just wants to kill everybody. He didn't get me though. I ran him over with a tractor. one of the very few brothers that survived the "Friday the 13th" series, by the way. They wanted to kill me off in "Part VI," but we said, "Nope, not doing that to us." John LeMay's character. another good one because we had a hell of a fight. I did put up a pretty good fight. The electricity's going off everywhere, and I'm just breathing heavy and sweating a lot and smacking the hell out of him. It was fun, but surviving Jason is an honor. In my obituary, it'll say " John survived Jason, but could not survive life." Rennie had a special connection to Jason because I think her evil uncle was trying to teach her how to swim when she was a little girl. I tossed her in the water, which was a not-very-nice thing to do for an uncle. And she had an inordinate fear of drowning. And she saw Jason under the water. I felt very empowered playing the part, especially at the end when I was the only one surviving and there we were in the sewers. And I felt like, "All right, this is a nice, tough, accurate portrayal of a girl's strength." You didn't get me in the lake, and you're not gonna get me now! I would probably go back and do another "Friday the 13th." If nothing else, then just to make my boys happy. Women in "Friday the 13th" movies are always strong. You know, they're strong characters. And we wanted to be true to that. So Todd and I came up with this idea of this robot and making the robot female. One of the most delightful things about her is like just unstoppable, unflappable. I feel very privileged in that I got to survive that movie. Even though he knocked my block off and I was a head. I was a talking head for, I think, the last third of the movie. I feel like one of the lucky ones. I think most of the people that have survived have been women because all of us directors have a tremendous amount of guilt for what we've done to all of these poor girls in the movies. I do think that the heroines have a strength that's there, but a real vulnerability that attracts people. People wanna love you and they wanna cheer for you. If they were to ask me to do sort of the "Friday the 13th" survivors. gonna take on Jason. would I do it? Hell yeah! Wouldn't it be great if the strong women of the series came back and took him on? It would be great. so maybe Adrienne and Lar and myself. I think that it would be very interesting if you had a triad of the girls, where you would have the powers, an extremely strong one and just a ballsy character. It would be a dream movie for the fans. And I think we could still pull it off. We still have a couple of good years in us. Jason? Where's Jason?! We took care of him. Please please please, help me. Yeah, bad luck sure can be bloody. It's not just the victims on the screen that run into problems. Over the past 30 years there have been troublesome times for the "Friday the 13th" filmmakers as well. Many had nothing whatsoever to do with our hockey-masked friend. Paul? Shooting my death scene was a bit of a challenge. That's where the horror part came into the filming with me. From here down, I was in the water. There were points where I just felt like I couldn't go on anymore. It was either 22 or 23º. It was very very cold and she had a bikini on and she was freezing. She was so cold her teeth were chattering, and this girl was actually turning blue. Ted White stood up for me and demanded that we get the shot now or else. And it turns out that I had gotten hypothermia, and I was quite sick for several days after that. A whole day spent filming the end of the movie where Jason's getting sucked into the earth and trying to drag me down with him. On the soundstage, they'd pretty much created this large sandbox with a hole in it, which Jason would pop up, grab me by the leg and keep pulling me down. And for some reason that sequence took a half a day with me screaming at the top of my lungs and just wearing my body out. I thought every shot was gonna be the last dang one, you know? I thought it was it. "We got this one, baby." I don't think I've ever been so exhausted in my life. Now, dirt demons, everything up, moving. The visual-effects climax, all these demons came up from below the ground and started grabbing Jason and trying to pull him down into hell. And KNB had a very elaborate sequence designed for that, with all kinds of puppets. And we had a very elaborate miniature. which wound up not being used because of technical problems. that actually grabbed Jason and started dragging him under. Isn't that cool? How many people get this going on? On the final day of production I got my action figure. made by the hair and makeup guys. So this is my one-of-a-kind action figure. We shot the ending twice. We actually did another ending, which most people have never seen, in which Dana Kimmell comes up to the door of the house in a dream, and Jason comes through the front door and decapitates her. This is the actual mask that was done on my skin. It's a little. oh, here's a worm. It's a little crumbly, but it's split up the back because as it was on my face all the way around my neck. I had a bald cap on. they did the whole thing right on my head. And so to get me out of it, they split it right up the back. So it used to be something like this, but. My parents are away in the movie. I had to be stoned. And so I thought, "Hmm, wouldn't that be interesting to actually be stoned on camera?" So I go to my trailer and I get stoned. I'm a very paranoid stoned person. So it was the worst worst idea I could have ever done. And they knocked on my door to go to the set. I'm like, "What?!" And they're like, "We're ready for you," and I'm like, "Okay." So they take me and I'm on the set, and, actors, don't get stoned and act. It's absolutely the worst thing. I was out of my mind. I do remember a scene in my bedroom where this girl comes on to me, and I was getting very keyed up, turned on. In the editing they didn't show any of that. And I was pissed off. I was really. having it affect me. The MPAA really went after the "Friday the 13th" films, 'cause they were asleep when the first film was rated. They kind of let it pass. When the sequels came out, and after all the criticism, they had to be more stringent. Probably the most heavily edited was "Part VII." The MPAA was just vicious toward that film for some reason. Ratings board raped my movie. I equate horror to telling a joke. Everything's in the setup and then the payoff has gotta be, "Whoa, that's great!" We were telling the joke and we weren't allowed to give them the punchline. So what you see in the final cut of "Friday VII," which is not really my cut, is a very watered-down version of what we hoped it would be. The MPAA was just responding to a lot of parent advocate groups that were coming out of the woodwork. I mean, you had parents picketing out in front of theaters for certain films sometimes. I think the MPAA gets crazy when you combine sex and violence at the same time, so I think that's something you have to be careful about. All the sequels really went through the wringer to secure R ratings. The MPAA, after a lot heavy-duty fights, insisted that we omit 47 seconds. Almost every kill was either off-screen or minimized. Tiffany Helm, there was a scene that nobody knows about, where she had her death scene. I think they had to change it because it would have been rated X if they kept it. Jason was gonna go in for the kill. Tiffany was gonna have her legs up like this, and he was just gonna go like. couldn't show that. Couldn't show that back then. That was cut. Rated X. X. Shoot it. "Friday the 13th" was the greatest experience for me, and then slowly I realized I had a stalker. I had an ordeal with him up close at one point, which in itself is a horror movie. It's all okay now. It's all good now. And having the three generations of fans from around the world that fly in to wherever I am at a city or a convention that really talk to me and care and tell me how much it affected them when they found out. it's just a gift. It's a beautiful thing and I don't care how sappy it sounds. I thank them. One of the scary moments on the set was in Jason's lair when I put the sweater on and I talked to him about Mother. And he's supposed to bring up this pickaxe. So I got really anxious and I brought the machete down. She missed the pickaxe, and she came down on my finger. And he goes to the hospital. I think he had the machete through his chest or something and walks into the emergency room and they're like, "Oh my God!" Then he said, " No no, it's just right here on my finger." And I have 13 stitches in this finger. It's right here. This right here, it's 13 stitches. And then he came back and we started all over again. We stayed at the camp. At one of our first nights in the cabins. I think it was John Furey and Bill Randolph and Russell Todd. knew where I was staying. And they went to the screen windows when it was really dark out and they started scratching on the screen windows. I fainted. I actually fainted flat on the floor 'cause I just went. Boom! Though the counselors at Crystal Lake worked very hard to keep the rules of the camp clear, the same can't be said for the "Friday the 13th" films, which have had more than their share of ambiguities and inconsistencies, leaving the fans longing for more. Oh, no way, Becca. You so owe me a Wonderbra. Well, okay. Strip Monopoly's so much fun. Oooh! Camp Crystal Lake rocks. One of the things that the "Friday" series never really took pride in was continuity. How could it be Friday the 13th if "2," "III" and "4" are within three or four days? I don't think Monday the 16th has quite the same ring to it. People send me Jason timelines and show me categorically where I'm wrong about certain things, and where the writer of "VI" was wrong, or the writer of "III" was wrong. And you know what, so what? I just don't know. The fans have told me at convention after convention that they felt "ripped off" about the way Alice died in "Part 2." She didn't even see him. It's like it could have been anyone. As far as I'm concerned, it was somebody else. If Jason is who I believe he is and who I think the fans think he is, it's not like he can look her number up in the phonebook. It's not like she would be listed in the phonebook. She got away. But in the second one he comes to her apartment and kills her? Now what I want to know is how did Jason get a plane ticket? There was a "Friday the 13th" TV series. The only thing that the series and the movies had in common was the title. It turns out it was about people trying to retrieve cursed artifacts from a pawnshop. I think a lot of people who were really big fans of the series didn't like the fact that they stole the name and tried to sneak a fast one past everybody. So beginning with "Part III," when Jason finds the mask that everyone identifies with him, there's been some debate over the years about how that happened. And the one thing that everybody likes to take credit for is who put the hockey mask on Jason. One day we were doing makeup tests on "Friday the 13th Part III." So just for the 3D concept, I must admit, in modesty, that I put the hockey mask on Jason. I don't care what anybody says. They weren't gonna use that bag again based on what happened to me with the burns. They had to come up with another idea. That's why they came up with the hockey mask. I believe it was Peter Schindler and Marty Becker were Detroit hockey fans. And it was their idea to come up with a hockey mask to cover the face up. Every time kids come to my door wearing the Jason hockey mask, I figure, " Wow, this is another 50¢ I didn't get." They're all still bickering about it, but you heard it here. mine. The end of "Friday the 13th Part 2" is still one of the most confusing endings of that series. Probably easily the most, other than the toxic-waste version of teenaged Jason. Paul! Where's Paul? For me, it wasn't a dream. Maybe that's one of the good parts of the movie is that you get to decide that for yourself. On "Freddy vs. Jason," they went a different direction with casting Jason and didn't cast Kane Hodder. And I was really surprised. I really wanted to use Kane and then Ronnie Yu decided that he really kind of liked this other guy. And he was directing the movie and I said, "Fine." It was a shame at some level that Kane didn't get to do it. About our clothes, I mean. that's slightly the weirdest thing about our roles, which were supposed to be these sexy girls and we're dressed in these ghastly clothes. What about our hair as well? Our hair put up in sort of little librarian buns. I mean, hello. And the pink puffy shirts with the shoulder pads. It's kind of like Springfield for " The Simpsons." It's like, where is Crystal Lake? It would be nice to find out someday where is this Crystal Lake, 'cause I'd like to go there and swim. I can definitively answer the question of where is Crystal Lake. Crystal Lake is in Green Valley, New Jersey. And the reason we know that is because in "Part III," Shelly and Vera go to a country store and in the store, you can see in the back, it says " Welcome to Green Valley, New Jersey." Case closed. "Jason Takes Manhattan". outside of having one of the great teaser posters of all time, which of course was then discontinued, ultimately, the "I Heart New York," that's actually something that's trademarked by probably, I'm guessing, the tourism bureau, if memory serves, and that's actually a very valuable license to them, ultimately. Crystal Lake has changed sizes. Somehow the boat gets from this tiny little lake to the Atlantic Ocean to New York. The cruise ship wasn't really in the lake. The cruise ship was on the ocean. In my mind, I had it justified, because I've seen places where you can go from a lake to the ocean. And we ultimately just said, "No, let's forget it. People may get mad at us for that, but let's go for it." Body switching in "Jason Goes to Hell," I think that was a terrible terrible decision. The fact that Jason turned into a slug in "Part 9".unacceptable. Gordon. The most rational character in the entire "Friday the 13th" series is the dog in "Part 4." You don't know whether Jason grabbed the dog and threw him out the window. The dog sees Jason and the next shot is the dog apparently jumping through the window. There was a big fight over whether we could kill the dog. I think he jumped, but I was hoping some people will think Jason did it. Maybe Tina from "VII" telekinetically yanked the dog out the window. Well, he was bound to catch up with her. sooner or later. If there's one thing that we've learned it's escaping Jason is a rarity. Over the last three decades, his reign of terror has gone beyond the silver screen. In fact, it's clear that Jason has done more than take Manhattan. In fact, I'd say he's conquered the world. Oh! That had to hurt. Interestingly enough, Jason did manage to infiltrate the pop culture in a big big way. And I think that all started with "Part III" in 3D. I have the home-theater glass set, so you can see it and watch it and people would walk into my house and I have them on, and be like, " Hey, what's up? I'm watching 'Friday the 13th Part III." ' From a merchandising perspective, it's huge. I cannot believe the branding of Jason. He is no less marketable than Ronald McDonald or Mickey Mouse at this point. Jason is making money. I mean, does he get a percentage of the sales? I'm very curious. Jason Voorhees has been mass marketed over the years, starting with this Nintendo game back in the early '80s. That was the worst game ever. All you did is run around the cabins. And there'd be like nothing, nothing, Jason's in here! I'm dead. My name's James Rolfe. I have an internet show. "The Angry Video Game Nerd." The "Friday the 13th" episode made its debut on Friday the 13th, October 2006. Uh-oh, he's coming. Whoa! Well, he scared the shit out of me and now he's fighting me like in " Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!" They've created a hero image of an individual that's unstoppable. He's this super slasher hero. There's no rhyme or reason, you know? He's been on lunchboxes and thermoses, and I think he was in a Nike commercial. Those I believe were banned or pulled from the market. There's been countless TV shows that have parodied "Friday the 13th," - from "MADtv." - Jason Takes NASA. Yeah, we've done a bunch of "Friday the 13th" parodies. The first thing we did was a"Horror Movie Big Brother." We did a Scooby gang investigates the mystery - of Camp Crystal Lake. - Zoinks! When it gets referenced on "The Simpsons" or "South Park," that's like your proudest moment. Run! I love the fact that "The Simpsons" have Jason and Freddy. - They should be here by now. - Ah, what are you gonna do? When he got that MTV Movie Award, it was absolutely invigorating for all the fans and also it was like, " Where have we landed exactly as a society?" We're giving a Lifetime Achievement Award to a masked predator. Shortly after we did "Jason Takes Manhattan," I was asked to do "The Arsenio Hall Show" in costume as a guest. He pulled the whole interview off by talking to someone who doesn't speak. How are you? - That's good. - One of the rare things I've ever done in full costume besides the movie. Snow globes, there's dolls, there's even a haunted house at Universal Studios in Florida and in Hollywood. One of the greatest thrills that I've had as a Jason fan was going to the Universal Horror Nights last year. Jason Voorhees is running after you. It's a real guy in the whole costume. I kind of pooped my pants a little bit. Hi, I'm John Murdy, creative director of Universal Studios' Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights and right now we are standing in front of the Crystal Lake cabin from "Friday the 13th: Camp Blood." When you're designing a haunted attraction like this, there's basically three things you look for. One is that the property has legs. Second is that the characters are something that you can achieve with actors, and the third is that the environments are strong and easily recognizable. And "Friday the 13th" has all three. So we were very lucky when we worked with New Line, we were able to get all three of those properties and basically turn our theme park into a living horror movie. In this case, he's got a poor victim stuck in this vise. His head's in the vise. Jason comes in and gives the vise a crank. We have a triggered audio effect that sounds like his bones in his skull are crushing, and we tied this into water spritz effect so that the guests think "eye goo" is shooting out of the victim onto them. This is for the wheelchair victim that has the machete in his head. Again, there's a secret door for Jason back here so he can make a dramatic entrance, and this poor guy that you think is dead leaps to life. When you're designing an attraction like "Friday the 13th: Camp Blood," for us, what we really want to do is we wanna deliver to the fans all their favorite kills from the "Friday the 13th" series. So this is a kill from "Freddy vs. Jason." This is the guy who gets his back broken in half. There's a performer that's laying here with his head against the bed. Jason comes storming into the room. He grabs hold of the bed, and he gives it a good. With Jason, they made countless toys. Every year there's new editions coming out. The McFarlane stuff and the Mezco stuff, they all look great. They're really well-sculpted, articulated, awesome looking. They're well-painted. Who would have thought there would be Jason dolls? There was a great book that came out a couple of years ago: "Crystal Lake Memories" about "Friday the 13th." Peter Bracke did a great job. He interviewed a lot of us in the series, from producers, directors to actors, of course. And it covers the series from A to Z. It was so fun to have come to the book signing and to see all the people that are now a part of this whole "Friday the 13th" phenomenon. It was a party for the launch of the "Crystal Lake Memories" book, and we signed all of the books. And then of course Jason showed up and cut the cake with a machete, and that was awfully fun. An iconic brand has been built. Everybody knows Jason. Everybody, all ages. It's all over the world. At Halloween, there's always gonna be some kid down the hall wearing a hockey mask. There's at least one kid who comes down your street who is Jason Voorhees, and the funny thing is he's up there with Santa Claus in the sense that everybody knows who it is. Jason is a big icon. I had a trick-or-treater come to my house. a little kid dressed as Jason. And I went, "I worked with him." And the kid kind of looked at me like he didn't understand. And I asked my nephew, 'cause he's 13, I said, "What is that?" He goes, "That's the Jason mask." And I said, " You know I'm in one of those movies?" And he said, " Oh, I've never seen any of those movies, but I know all about Jason." In hindsight, it seems silly there wouldn't be a backlash. The critics were outraged. Gene Siskel launched a letter-writing campaign to Paramount. "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter," an immoral and reprehensible piece of trash. When Roger Ebert said that "Friday the 13th" was "an immoral and reprehensible piece of trash," I thought, " Two thumbs up. Gotta see it." There's just so much in our culture that gets labeled things unnecessarily or just unjustifiably. And I think "Friday the 13th" s were just. they're scary movies. As film critics, shame on them for not appreciating the fact that they are artistic entertainment vehicles for a very defined demographic. We have fun reading reviews. We know what they're gonna be like, and especially if someone gets particularly bitchy and clever, it's great. In a way it's sort of like the "Friday the 13th" movie itself: if they're clever in the way they're trying to kill you, you cheer. What's more appealing than forbidden fruit? That's the oldest story that there is. So when you say to a young 13-year-old, "You can't go see that movie, young man. It's a piece of immoral trash," I'm pretty confident that's the first thing the 13-year-old's gonna go do. As long as nobody's going out and doing nothing crazy. they never had to put "Don't try this at home" on the screen. so it's all fun. It's not attracting psychos to it. It really does attract a very respectful group of people. Jason can survive anything, even bad reviews. If you're taking these films too seriously, you should probably go have a Valium or do something else. I started the Screamfest Horror Film Festival in 2001 as a platform to give independent filmmakers a way to further their careers and have their work be shown to the industry. I think some of the films that we've screened in Screamfest definitely have been influenced by "Friday the 13th." Most recently I would say Adam Green's "Hatchet." I think almost any slasher movie post-"Friday the 13th" kind of tipped their hat to it. It's a great independent film. And it's great to look back and. what? 20-some-odd years later to look back and see young filmmakers, like an Adam, up and coming, to have a film that's reminiscent of "Friday the 13th." So it's kind of cool. I've been to a million conventions and I see people with Jason tattoos. It's a lot of fun. Come on, it's beautiful. We bleed for this shit. The fans are open to creating their own mythology about them too. He had just received a surprise postcard from Jason, inviting him to take part in a slayathon. Jason doesn't have a star on the walk of fame. This is terrible. He's been around for 30 years and he can't get a star? Jason is a star! Oh, sorry. I didn't know anybody was using this room. Okay, I admit it. I love this stuff. But as we've seen, so do millions of others. I mean, after all a good killer is never out of style, right? Which is exactly why the original terrifying legend of Jason Voorhees is being reimagined and repackaged for a whole new generation of fans. It's exciting to see Jason up to his old tricks. So now after all of this time, playing around with Jason for all these years, there comes a new look, a new feel hopefully in this new reimagining or reboot of the franchise. I hope the fans will enjoy it from the same point of view I enjoyed it from, which is to see Jason for the first time again. To be able to work with Jason Voorhees and to see that mask. I can tell you the first day that he wore that mask on set, we all got chills. It was amazing, and it was amazing to think that here's this thing that we've grown up with, and it's right here and we can touch it and feel it, because when we watched it as kids, it felt so far away. It's made by people who love the franchise, but who are going at it with many more resources than we ever had or ever dreamed of. This remake centers around this brother-sister story between the Whitney character and the Clay character, which is played by Jared Padalecki. It doesn't go so well. There's enough characters in there to actually bring some comedy into it, so there's gonna be obviously the crazy deaths. They've already said there's 13. They've already said that, so I'm not giving away anything, but along with the deaths, you might have some other lighter moments, and it's gonna be a good contrast. What I think makes this one unique is Jason being more humanistic and not sort of that supernatural zombie. He's a person. We are coming into a time now where everyone is becoming more emotional and in touch with their feelings. So we give Jason this backstory, and I feel like people can relate to him more, which almost makes the killings and the deaths seem justified. I think there's more heart involved. That I think is exciting, 'cause it's a new face of Jason. And you have to figure out how to recreate and keep renewing this franchise. And they've taken sort of the best elements of the first four and wrapped it into one. What the fans can expect to see from the new "Friday the 13th" is the best aspects of the films they loved in the past taken out and mixed up and put into a brand-new film for everybody. I think they're gonna see the intensity. They're gonna see over-the-top brutal kills. We really strived to give audiences kills that they hadn't seen before, or, and maybe better, kills they had seen but we added something else to the kill. And something else that was in the original that really hasn't been in any horror movies lately, our movie has a ton of nudity in it. They're gonna see over-the-top unique sex scenes. It's gonna be an entertaining wild roller-coaster of a ride. We've gone to great lengths to make the movie feel very authentic, to be very respectful to the character. I think this film is gonna greatly satisfy all the genre fans, not just the hardcore "Friday the 13th" fans. It's not only remarkably scary, but very very funny. The mythology will stay intact. Jason is still Jason. Our hope is that the true fans love the film as much as people who've never seen the movie before. We're hopeful that all of our attempts at authenticity will have paid off for them, and we suspect that they will, but you never know. I think, regardless, they're gonna be pulled in, and that's that. I'm excited to be a part of this. colossal franchise. To just be a part of the name "Friday the 13th" is a little exhilarating I have to say. We all love Jason Voorhees. I mean, who doesn't? Reggie will kick his butt. Reggie the reckless will kick Jason's butt now. I will put the red suit on, and I will whip Jason's behind. - I ain't playing. - We can only hope that the people who loved "Friday the 13th" in the first place will be satisfied with this newer, slicker, kind of cooler version of the story. On the other hand, I think that you're gonna have people that are gonna see this new version as the first "Friday the 13th" they ever saw. And this will hopefully set a new level of quality so that the franchise can continue forward. Excuse me, miss, is this yours? I think you dropped. she won't be needing this. Over the years, it's been the unstoppable Jason that's kept moviegoers flocking to theaters for a bloody good time, but it's not just the fans who appreciate Jason's never-ending reign of terror. "Friday the 13th" has had a life of its own. It's quite amazing. There are people who just love this genre. The "Friday the 13th" films are an E ticket ride. And I think people are constantly ready to pay up for that ride. On the night of its opening, my wife said, "Let's go out to see it." We went to six theaters that night, and we couldn't get in. We couldn't get in anywhere. And I said to my wife, "Holy cow, I think we really did something here." When I tell them that I was in "Friday the 13th," it's so fun for me. Thanks to "Friday the 13th," my 15 minutes keeps going. Playing a character that's known around the world is an amazing feeling and something I'm really proud of. There's really no putting your finger on it, but there seems to be a loyalty and a fascination with it that just drives it forward. It's really the audience that brings Jason back to life every time. The legend grows from picture to picture to picture. People like getting scared. They don't know what's gonna happen. They're just gonna wait. oh! It surprises me from time to time just about how the "Friday the 13th" movies continue and just go on and on. The characters die, but the movie doesn't. When you do "The Final Chapter," you expect for it to be the final chapter. This was the last one. We were doing the very last one. "The Final Friday," and I remember people saying it's not gonna be the final "Friday." That was 1992. I get three, four, five requests a week for autographs and pictures and so on from all over the world. People still contact me. They contact me about things from the film that I forgot about. People send me things to sign. big long posters. I'm like, "How did they get this?" "Friday the 13th" has given me a gift that is just bigger than life itself. I get the most beautiful stories about how Alice's strength has inspired so many people around the world. I was 27 years old and I was the lead in a movie. Number-one-box-office movie at Paramount for two weekends. This was the best first acting gig I could have gotten. Because when you have a knife coming at you, you really learn how to hit your mark. I hope the audience is having as much fun watching this - as we are making it. - Personally, it was an honor. still is an honor to be associated with it. And it's really great entertainment, so I think that's why he's still around. I think the audience wants to see more Jason the same way that they want to see more Bond. The same way they want to see more Batman. I've found that a movie that I really didn't give 2¢ for in the beginning has brought me into the world, into the lives of people who have viewed it in a very special way. Did you know that a young boy drowned? The counselors weren't paying any attention. His name was Jason. Well, there you have it. "Friday the 13th," a movie that was made to keep filmmakers' lights on, but made America afraid to turn them off. And one that singlehandedly gave birth to modern slasher cinema, generating box office success beyond anybody's wildest dreams. You know, "Friday the 13th" continues to inspire and influence emerging filmmakers who try to capture their own lightning in a bottle. And on top of that, I can probably proclaim that Jason Voorhees is a pop-culture icon recognized the world over. So here we are. It's three decades later, and "Friday the 13th" lives on. And it's because of you that Jason Voorhees keeps coming back to terrify audiences. So let me return the favor. I'll give you some advice. If somebody invites you to Camp Crystal Lake, just don't go. You see what I mean? My bad. Sorry. It's supposed to be. "ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma." - Not everybody knows that. - True, but that's the way it sounds. I showed them how I can fart "ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma," but the camera wasn't rolling, so yeah. I think if Vera had. Excuse me. I thought it was Jason. Kill her, Mommy! Kill her! And he's still there. There's somebody in this fucking room! Why do you do these stupid things? I just want you to like me. I got a date with a soap on a rope. Ted, Ted, where's the corkscrew? Come on, Sara, strip and dip? Bad news crews. It's okay, guys. He just wants his machete back. Axel, you are the Super Bowl of self-abuse. This feels good! Nobody's gonna touch that fucking ray of sunshine. I have seen enough horror movies to know any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly. That's what's known as screwing the pooch. Ben, are you coming back or not? And then. You didn't get me in the lake, Jason, and you're not gonna get me now. My earring. You could use a little touch-up work first. And cut. Melissa's a bitch. I know. I can't even do it. It's a real pain in the ass. And you're gonna use that for sure, I know. I said, "It's a real pain in the ass." You are gonna use that. I know that. Finally he gets hacked to death by Corey fucking Feldman? Yo, Feld-dawg, what the fuck? I'm getting Haim on your ass. Sorry. I found it. I didn't have a clue as to what the plot was in "Jason Goes to Hell." A lot of shaving. It's creepy. It's so creepy. Homoerotic. shaven. Never show your breasts. Here comes first Jason! We're gonna go up to Crystal Lake even though we've heard that there's horrible things. oh my God! There's bananas everywhere. It is a lot easier to go watch Jason than it is to watch Dick Cheney. You give up? Never! I don't know what my lines are. There's only one thing that Jason knows, and he knows it well. Kill! - No, I don't know. - A few people. I was. it was terrible. Tomorrow's will be better. I don't think I can say that. Say it in a public forum. I need. I need evidence. It's big, no? Ever since I entered physics, people have been talking about this machine. The Large Hadron Collider, the biggest machine ever built by human beings, is finally going to turn on. And after many, many years of waiting and theorizing about how matter got created and about what the deep fundamental theory of nature is. all those theories are finally going to be tested, and we're gonna know something. And we don't know what it's gonna be now, but we will know, and it's gonna change everything. And if the LHC sees new particles, we're on the right track. And if it doesn't, not only have we missed something, but we may not ever know how to proceed. We are at a fork in the road, and it's either going to be a golden era. Oh! Or it's going to be quite stark. And I've never heard of a moment like this in history, where an entire field is hinging on a single event. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm David. - I'm Fabiola. Fabiola, nice to meet you. - So, look, I have suggested to be on this side because this big wheel is quite spectacular. Yeah, yeah. More than ever, this will require the collaboration between the theory and experimentalists, so it would be a very nice period where we work together and, uh. - Well, it's fun to finally interact with experimentalists. I mean, I used to be just in my office, coming up with, you know, crazy ideas. It's a big thing. There is a general sense waiting for this machine to start, this massive machine that has taken so many years to build. We are all in great anticipation of what it might find. And every time there's even a rumor that a new particle is discovered. even before it turns on. the entire field goes into a fever pitch. The experiment was designed initially in the mid '80s and has taken this long to construct. There are 10,000 people of over 100 nationalities. That includes countries which are mortal enemies of each other, like India and Pakistan, and Georgia and Russia, and Iran and Israel. All have physicists working on this machine. These big blue things are 7-ton superconducting magnets, which have to be cooled with liquid helium to the coldest temperatures on Earth, colder than empty space. There are 100,000 computers connected all over the world to deal with the data. In fact, the worldwide web was invented at CERN so that physicists all over the planet could share the data. The United States was building a machine just like this, in fact, a bigger machine, in Texas, but they ran into a small technical difficulty. - I doubt anyone believes that the most pressing issues facing the nation include an insufficient understanding of the origins of the universe. - Unfortunately, the Superconducting Super Collider was canceled by Congress in 1993. - And finally, he's saying, "Well, if we don't do it, the Europeans will do it." Let them do it! We'll steal their technology like they steal our technology. It got very political. It was very expensive, very complicated. It's hard for physicists to explain why we do these kinds of experiments. The purpose of the machine is not military application. It's not commercial application. It's to understand something about the basic laws of physics. There are two kinds of particle physicists: there are the experimentalists. They built the big machines, run the experiments, analyze the data, and try to discover things, like new particles; And then there are the theorists, like me. We construct the theories that try to explain everything we see in nature. Without us, the experimentalists are in the dark, but without them, we'll never know the truth. - I mean, if you go, it won't be so terrible. When I was at Stanford, I had a mentor: Savas Dimopoulos. Savas only likes to work on the biggest puzzles. Now, just for fun, I wanted to tell you that the enabling technologies that. - He has some of the most famous theories that will be tested at the LHC, but he doesn't know if any of them are true, so there's an intensity with which he approaches physics. If he works on a paper that could result in a Nobel Prize, he doesn't allow more than three people on the paper, because you can only share the Nobel Prize with three people. That's the level at which he's operating and the impact he's trying to have. - Takes us beyond the confines of atomic physics. In particle physics, you have to have a threshold amount of intelligence, whatever that means. But the thing that differentiates scientists is purely an artistic ability to discern what is a good idea, what is a beautiful idea, what is worth spending time on, and, most importantly, what is a problem that is sufficiently interesting, yet sufficiently difficult that it hasn't yet been solved, but the time for solving it has come now? - So people have been waiting for this experiment, the LHC, for a very long time. Nothing like it has ever happened. All the superlatives are justified. This is the case where the hype is. the hype is approximately accurate. To get, you know, 3,000 people to work on an experiment together, whose goal is to understand what's going on at distances a thousand times smaller than the proton. this is. this is a really extraordinary testament to what. to some of the highest ideals we can have as human beings. It's. - Nima and I got our PhDs around the same time. He's a couple years ahead of me. And Nima is the star of our generation, and he's the guy we all followed and looked up to and tried to keep up with and tried to outpace if we could. Since the mid '70s, we've had an amazingly successful theory of nature that we call the Standard Model of particle physics. But sitting in the heart of the theory is a sickness, very, very glaring conceptual problems that infected this fantastic understanding. Why is the universe big? Why is gravity so much weaker than all the other forces? The kinds of answers that this theory gives to these questions seems so patently absurd that we think that we're missing something very, very big. And on top of all of that, there is one prediction of this theory. absolutely crucial for it to even make internal theoretical sense. and this is the famous Higgs particle. The Higgs, or something like it, must show up. If it doesn't show up, there's something truly, deeply wrong, very, very, deeply wrong with the way we think about physics. There are strong reasons to think that some of these questions will find answers at the LHC. There's been no shortage of ideas for what they might be, but this is really this generation of people's. my generation of people's. only shot. Ah, so the boss comes. I first came to CERN in 1987. I was a very young undergraduate student, and I remember the first time I entered the site. I was a bit scared by the corridors in the CERN main site, so I was almost lost in those corridors. For me, it has been a wonderful experience, because I had the chance of being involved right from the beginning and to see, really, an experiment from starting and. from zero, essentially. - I've seen two inventors place out of the ten, and we probably have seen. - I don't think I can describe right now the excitement about first beam. I mean, the entire control room is like a group of six-year-olds whose birthday is next week, you know, and there's going to be cake, and there's going to be presents, and all their friends are going to be there, and they just, you know. they just know it's going to be great. You know, they're kind of scattered, and I can't imagine, 'cause they're not that big, right? I've been a postdoc here for a year, so I'm a relative newcomer. But my timing is sort of perfect. I mean, to be on the ground floor when the data first comes. it's awesome. That means I have 5,000 emails. There's a huge difference between theorists and experimentalists. I mean, when I started college, I absolutely did not want to do physics. Physics meant to me everything that was boring: textbooks, theories, proofs. But then I discovered the experimental side, and the experimental side is the hands-on aspect. It's about taking a theory, which is abstract, and making it real. How do you build an experiment to discover something that the theory predicts? And that aspect is what I love. Of course, when constructing the whole thing, we several times thought, "What if the whole thing just does not work?" I really believe now this will work, but the next thing is, will we ever find something? So maybe we will just find nothing new. It would be a catastrophe for physics. We would, somehow. none of the open questions which we have at the moment would've been answered. - So the LHC is basically the most fundamental of experiments. It's like what any child would design as an experiment. You take two things, and you smash them together. And you get a lot of stuff that comes out of that collision, and you try to understand that stuff. Now, in this case, what we're smashing together is tiny protons, which are inside the center of every atom. And in order to get them going as fast as possible, we have to build this huge 17-mile ring, and we run those protons around the ring multiple times to build up speed, almost to the speed of light, and then we collide two beams going in opposite directions at four points, and at those four points are four different experiments: ATLAS, LHCb, CMS, and ALICE. Now, I work on the ATLAS experiment. And ATLAS is like a huge seven-story camera that takes a snapshot of every single collision, and that's billions of collisions. And the hope is that we'll see the very famous Higgs particle. But every time we've turned on the new accelerator at a higher energy, we've always been surprised. So the real hope is that we'll see the Higgs, but that there's also something amazingly new. - You can liken it to when we put a man on the moon. It's that level of collaborative effort. I would say, even bigger than that. This is closer to something like human beings building the Pyramids. Why did they do it? Why are we doing it? We actually have two answers. One answer is what we tell people, and the other answer is the truth. I'll tell you both. And there's nothing incorrect about the first answer. It's just. it doesn't. it's not the thing that drives us. It's not how we think about it, but it's something you can say quickly, and the person you're talking to won't, you know, <i>get diverted or pass out or pick up the SkyMall catalog</i> if you happen to be next to them on an airplane. Answer number one: we are reproducing the physics, the conditions, just after the big bang. We're doing it in this collider, and we're reproducing that so we can see what it was like when the universe just started. This is what we tell people. Okay, answer two: we are trying to understand the basic laws of nature. It sounds slightly more mild, but this is really where we are and what we're trying to do. We study particles, because just after the big bang, all there was was particles, and they carried the information about how our universe started and how it got to be the way it is and its future. At the beginning of the 1900s, it became clear that all known matter, everything that we know about, is made of atoms, and that atoms are made of just three particles: the electron, the proton, and the neutron. In the '30s, other particles were discovered, and by the 1960s, there were hundreds of new particles, with a new particle discovered every week. And there was mass confusion, until a number of theorists realized that there was a simple mathematical structure that explained all of this, that most of these particles were made of the same three little bits we call quarks, and that there are only a handful of truly fundamental particles, which all fit together in a nice, neat pattern. And there was born the Standard Model. Eventually, all the particles in the theory were discovered, except one: the Higgs. And the Higgs is unlike any other particle. It's the linchpin of the Standard Model. Its theory was written down in the 1960s by Peter Higgs and a number of other theorists. We believe it is the crucial piece responsible for holding matter together. It is connected to a field which fills all of space and which gives particles, like the electron, mass and allowed them to get caught in atoms and thus is responsible for the creation of atoms, molecules, planets, and people. Without the Higgs, life as we know it wouldn't exist. But to prove that it's true, we have to smash particles together at high enough energy to disturb the field and create a Higgs particle. If the Higgs exists, the LHC is the machine that will discover it. - Let's assume you're successful and everything comes out okay. - Sure. - What do we gain from it? What's the economic return? How do you justify all this? By the way, I am an economist. I don't hold it against you. The question by an economist was, "What is the financial gain of running an experiment like this and the discoveries that we will make in this experiment?" And it's a very, very simple answer. I have no idea. We have no idea. When radio waves were discovered, they weren't called radio waves, because there were no radios. They were discovered as some sort of radiation. Basic science for big breakthroughs needs to occur at a level where you're not asking, "What is the economic gain?" You're asking, "What do we not know, and where can we make progress?" So what is the LHC good for? Could be nothing other than just understanding everything. - The first time I ever saw ATLAS was in 2005. I had come out just to see what ATLAS would look like because there was a possibility that I could be working on it as a postdoc. I can remember walking in and just being like. You know, just stunned. I mean, me, stunned, you know, just, you know, already kind of having an idea of the magnitude. People tell you, "Oh, it's five stories tall." And you go, "Oh, okay, five stories tall." And then you see. Five stories completely filled with microelectronics. All custom designed, all hand-soldered. You know, it's like as if it's a five-story Swiss watch. - There was this issue about the BCIDs. - We had our extended barrel out earlier, but it should be back in, and we should be. everything running normal. - Okay, so one more announcement. We have to be extremely careful what we do to the system. I mean, we know that anybody who's even updating a number somewhere might stop our system for more than an hour quite easily. So please be absolutely sure that you yourself and everybody in your system is not touching the system, unless it's been agreed by the shift leader, yeah? Nothing should be touched, yeah? And that includes all things that you're absolutely dead certain they will not do anything wrong. Especially those things. - It's being called the largest scientific experiment in history, and some say one that could cause Armageddon. - It's the strangest experiment ever: mankind's most ambitious attempt to understand how we all got here. - Thousands of scientists from around the world spent 20 years designing an extraordinary machine. It cost £5 billion and will switching on very soon. This is a genesis machine, a window on creation. Five months of testing on. - They're looking for something called the God Particle, but skeptics are saying nobody knows what will happen when they turn on the switch. - A group of French scientists believe the collider might create a black hole that could swallow up the earth, and they filed suit to stop the project from going forward. Hello? No, absolutely not. Well, no, there is no scientific ground to what they say. It's not possible that the LHC is going to destroy the world. It's absolutely ridiculous. Okay, it is 9:15. We are 15 minutes away from beam. We've been sitting here, about 7:00, and absolutely nobody brought food. Again, 15 minutes to beam. <i>- Ciao, ciao. - Stress levels are high.</i> <i>Ciao.</i> - But since I'm in a room full of Italians, the stress level's pretty cool here. But we have no coffee either. No coffee. Who didn't bring coffee? What we're going to see today is the launch of the first beam of protons around this enormous ring. Very shortly, Lyn Evans, the project director, is going to be addressing CERN staff, who are gathered at different points around this massive complex. - It's just the first glimpse at the fact the machine can run. I mean, so what you need, really, is, you need two beams colliding together for quite a few. quite a long period of time before you calculate, get enough. sufficient statistics in which to actually be able to look for the new physics. But single beam, the first beam, isn't even that. You're not even getting any collisions. It's just one beam going around in a circle, not even at the high energies. Just one beam going around in the low energy circle, that sort of says, "Okay, we made it around the ring once for the first time." And it's a huge event. Right, after 19 years, you've been waiting for this first step. Let's get started, everybody. Now comes the day of reckoning. Five, four, three, two, one. Now. No beam. Yeah. So where are we with the injection kicker? Oh, well. they're out. Okay, never mind. Let's go. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. We get a beam on this pulse? I hope so. Yes! - Well, last night I was, like, waking up constantly. Like, "Did we set that right? What about. did we disable. oh, my gosh!" Marzio. I have a plot for you. Okay, check this out. This is Z. This is timing, in nanoseconds, which we knew from the cosmic data. - That is very nice. - Yes. - Upstairs, I think people were more excited about this. - If you're in Google, that means. that's the world. This is the most important thing today. This is the first, and this tells us a lot of things. It tells us that the magnetic properties of the machine are good, that the aperture is clear. There's nothing is sticking into the beam pipe anywhere. So a very, very encouraging sign and remarkable progress. - Did you guys see our beautiful plot? - What? - Okay, I want to show you this. Come on, show them the plot. You can take a picture of. here you go. Well, see if you can get it. I don't think there's anyone else I can show my plot to, so. It worked. It just worked. And there are so few times in life where it just works. And there are so even fewer times in life where it just works great. We rocked. I mean, Tile, first beam. We destroyed that shit. They got a beam circulating. They've had beams circulating for a full 30 seconds. So let me understand. This is one beam going one way? - They have one beam going one way, and then they went to the other beam going the other way. Well, does it work? The second beam, did it go fully around? - Everything. - they both went around. I think they had the beam go around about a million times. Something like that. - Yeah, their Twitter feed said 10 million. - Now we'll become, you know, CERN Twitter junkies. I guess this is exciting. My logical self wants to be excited. My psychological self is very cautious. My parents are both Iranian and both physicists, and my father in particular had real political difficulties with the regime, and we had to go underground for a number of years, and we ended up escaping from Iran through the border of Turkey. But then, through a number of wonderful accidents, we ended up in Canada. I got interested in physics when I was 13 or 14 years old. It just offered the way to combine the two things I really loved: mathematics and things in the natural world. You almost done? Yeah. - It's just saying "What if?" - It's, uh. yeah. - You're preparing a broader audience for this. - Okay, now I'm going to just do something fun. Just do something fun. What would be fun? - No, don't write "hell." It's a public. All right, I'm sorry! - How about that? - There we go. - Thinking about the LHC has been the center of my intellectual life for about 15, 16 years now. Depending on what happens with the LHC, you know, these are 15 years I could come to see as the best possible thing I could've been doing with this time, or it could just be that the entire 15 years might as well have not happened, had no impact, and then that's just 15 years that are gone. It's not the sort of thing where there's a consolation prize. You know, it's a fairly binary situation. I definitely won't feel, "Oh, well, "I gave it a good old college try. "It's all fine anyway. It's just trying that counts." I don't believe that. I don't believe it's just trying that counts. I believe getting it right is what counts. Okay, please take your seats. Now it's time for the entertainment part. So as with every great physics event, we're going to start with a big bang, the ATLAS big bang event, and that's going to follow with music all evening, people from ATLAS, who are going to be performing for you. So let's get started. - Take 2,000 intelligent, ambitious, type "A" personalities. You make them work 16-hour days, high-pressure situation, lots of stress. You know, that's the recipe for disaster. Or at least it's a recipe for a reality television program. But all that physics, Higgs, extra dimensions, supersymmetry, microscopic black holes, macroscopic black holes, Z-primes, you name it, the physics that the theorists only dream of is ours to discover. Thank you. ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Thanks to the Large Hadron Collider ♪ Thank you, ATLAS! - I grew up in Turkey from Greek parents and a middle-class family, and then, in the '60s, we became refugees. We had to leave Turkey because of ethnic tensions between Greeks and Turks over the island of Cyprus, and there were a lot of political cross currents, left, right, and I was a young, impressionable 13-year-old hearing the pro-left and pro-right arguments, so one day I would be convinced that one side was right. The other day, I would be convinced the other side was right. And then I was getting confused. How could both of these things be true if they were contrary to each other? So I decided to focus on a field where the truth didn't depend on the eloquence of the speaker. The truth was absolute. Of course, when I started out, I thought that within maybe five years the theories that I was working on were going to be tested and I was going to know the experimental truth and move on to the next round of ideas after that. Little did I know that the experiments would take far longer, and here I am, 30 years after, still not knowing the truth. Peter? - I can show you here a nice event. Did you see this from. - Ah, no. - Andreas showed me this. - I haven't seen it. - This is from yesterday night. This is now a real beam gas event. So you see the tracks also bent. - Bent by the field? - Very nice. Ah, no, I haven't seen. In some sense, I started form the wrong perspective and in the wrong way, because I'd been studying a lot of literature when I was at high school level. So literature, art, philosophy, history, and very little physics and mathematics. I'd also been studying music, piano, and so I was very much attracted by art. There are many similarities between music and physics. Classical music follows rules of harmony, which are really rules of physics and mathematics. But, also, I was fascinated by big questions. That is the possibility of addressing and answering big questions about nature, the universe, why, when, how, and when I finished high school, I thought that physics allow us to address this big question in a more practical way than, for instance, philosophy. That's why I decided to study physics. - Yes, we lost these two there. I managed to go through, like, the four gallons of milk that I had in the fridge, but. - We were just waiting for collisions, waiting for collisions. and finally, then this helium leak, which really, uh. it's really frustrating. We cannot even go there and investigate what happened. You have to warm up the magnets, and warming up the magnets needs to be done on a very slow pace and. in order not to break them. then you can investigate and cool them down again. - The world's largest atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider, is to be shut down for at least two months. CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. - Scientists at CERN are trying to put on a brave face. A faulty electrical connection between two magnets led to a ton of liquid helium being leaked into the 27-kilometer tunnel. The first high-speed particle collisions were due to take place later this month. The goal now is simply to get this vastly complex machine working. Fucking hell, look at that. This is just unbelievable. You've got magnets just sheared off their jacks. We've actually put in enough energy to melt it and to vaporize a whole tube of. - And the stuff's all covered in a sort of black, metallic dust. Completely catastrophic, eh? Completely catastrophic. - There's no more vacuum in the beam vacuum, so can as well open it up and see whether there's any dust, because if there's dust, it means we have to clean all the way until it's. I hope, in the worst case, we have not to take out more than 20 or so magnets. Both my family and my students detect a definite level of. let's say pessimism and disappointment. The built expectation that now we were going to know the truth, it fizzled and delayed, and it's just, uh. I thought I was stronger than this. It surprised me. - I did say that I thought it was a mistake for CERN to have this gigantic celebration for things just when it just had a few protons wandering around in one direction around the ring, that it was just a bad idea to have so much hoopla before anything was actually happening. At the time when people were asking me if I was going to CERN to celebrate, I said, "I'm going to go to CERN "when there's a reason to celebrate, you know, "when things are colliding into each other, "when something is starting to happen, not for some crappy PR reason." And that backfired. That, I think. really, that really backfired, and I think that was a PR disaster. It was a PR disaster largely of CERN's own making. You don't go around, you know, having gigantic parties before anything has happened. - So the magnets that have come out are being refurbished, and so they're sort of trundling through about six magnets a week now. So that's no longer the bottleneck. Now they're kind of getting to the state where they're ready to start redoing the interconnects in the tunnel, and they're already about a week or two behind on that. Given the complexity. - The other thing is that they're drilling these bloody holes in the magnets. - Because they, like. - what I heard this last time, they were saying that all their tools are breaking and that sort of business. - But it begs the question, of course, you know, what are the risks? I mean, you kind of basically, you're going. I don't know. We didn't actually think so much about the collateral effects of the helium. - Nobody has. - Yeah, nobody. - Yeah. - Nobody. Well, there's been a lot of investigations into the cause of the original problem, and the general agreement is that we run at half design energy. - Experimentalists aren't going to be happy. Well. - So, yeah. so the latest schedule is this: we just put out is D-Day, beams back on the 21st of September. Isn't that a bit optimistic? Isn't that a bit optimistic for, uh, this year? - When you're dealing with something that is a long-term project. and the LHC is a long-term project. It's a 20-year project. You can't think about the end. Ever. If you start out a marathon thinking, "I can't wait to get to the finish line; "I'm gonna have my Gatorade at the finish line; I'm gonna have my greasy french fries at the finish line," or whatever motivates you. if you start thinking that at mile one and it's, like, ten minutes into the race, and you're thinking to yourself, "Wow, I'm only at mile one. I've got 25.2 miles to go." And if you're thinking that at the start, then you're done. Mentally, you are done. - This is what doing discovery physics means. This is what doing discovery means. Why do people have curiosity? Why do we care about how distant parts of the universe, things that happened billion years ago, like the big bang, why do we find them that interesting? It doesn't affect what we do day-to-day. But nevertheless, once you have curiosity, you can't control it. - It'll ask questions about the universe. It will ask questions about harmonic patterns that create art, music. - That's a sculpture? - That's a sculpture. - Yeah, doesn't it look like a bunch of broken tiles? - That's what it's supposed to look like. And it's, uh. and when I saw it, I thought it was just rubble left over from the construction. Right, yeah. - You can, in principle, move it. - So people go up and move pieces? - No, people don't. - But people could. Why would they have it so you can move it around if you weren't going to move it around? No, I think you're right. - I think you're allowed to move it around. - It's certainly a different experience of it. I agree. See, I thought that that belonged here. It's just. it's the perfect spot. - It certainly changes everything. - It does. - Slate and granite. I guess that's the granite, and that's the slate. Hmm. It's interesting. - There's something philosophically about this piece of art that bothers me. It's taking a lot of sort of random things and making some order out of it. Yes. - It's trying to make order out of something where there isn't any, instead of taking things that don't seem ordered and figuring out that there is order. - The way we try to reduce the complexity of the world is by looking for patterns, what we call symmetries. We take all the particles we know today, and we attempt to fit them into some kind of underlying structure. Are they the remnants of some more beautiful and complete picture of the laws of nature? It's like, you go to Egypt, and you see ruins. If you look at it the right way, I could draw a pyramid and see that these chunks of stone are actually the remains of something very clean and very symmetric, very beautiful. We know that the Standard Model is incomplete. We know that there's other stuff out there, that there are other particles that we haven't seen yet. Dark matter is a speculated particle which we think actually dominates the universe, and yet we've never seen it directly, and it's not part of the Standard Model. That's one of those rocks. We think, possibly, that that and many other particles are still out there and are all part of a much bigger symmetry, a much bigger theory that includes the Standard Model, but much more. The most popular theory is called supersymmetry, or SUSY for short. Supersymmetry was a theory that sort of started to develop in the late '70s. Savas was one of the first authors of the first theories of supersymmetry. - It is the unfathomable depths of. - Supersymmetry is our best guess of what else is out there, the bigger theory that incorporates our current theories, the Standard Model. But for it to be true, we have to discover those other particles. - If I could choose a dream of any theory that the LHC could find, actually, I would love for them to see supersymmetry. Supersymmetry says, for every type of particle, say the electron, there's a heavy superpartner. So you have the. and they have really stupid names, unfortunately, called the selectron. You just add an S to the name. The squark. Uh, the sup, the sdown. Supersymmetry, or SUSY, is extremely important for the theoretical community because it solves many mathematical problems with the Standard model. Now, experimentally, it would be the experimentalists' dream. You know, tons of particles that are just coming out, and you just don't even know what to do with. you know, can't even write the data fast enough in order to discover them. So that'd be my dream. It used to be that in the control room life, it was kind of a luxury. You know, you could kind of. you could, you know, kind of style your hair for the day because you didn't have to wear a hard helmet all day. You could wear nice shoes, you know, because you were in the control room environment. Now, it's all back to, you know, bring the dirtiest clothes that you own to work because you're gonna be crawling around in, like, you know, hard helmets, steel-toed boots. Not the most attractive shoes, but, you know, I kind of like them. We're pulling out the electronics. We're fixing things that we didn't actually have time to get to during the last shutdown. The goal of this is that it would be in even better shape for next beam. Okay, so that is, I think, all that I have to say. Hope the theorists aren't driving you crazy. Don't listen to them, by the way, because theorists, they can sometimes. Just telling you. You got to come back to the experimental world so that you can touch bases with reality. All right, I'll talk to you soon. - One of the most basic facts about the universe is that it's big. So you might wonder, "Why is the universe big?" There's actually a single number, called the cosmological constant, that plays a crucial role in determining what the universe looks like. In fact, around ten years ago, astronomers discovered a really remarkable fact: the universe is getting bigger and bigger at a faster and faster rate. But this rate is a million, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion times slower than what we'd actually predict. When you're off by a factor of a million, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, there's something very wrong with your understanding of basic physics. Even worse, this one number, the cosmological constant, needs to have this extremely precise value. And if the value is different even by a tiny bit, we would radically change what the world looks like around us. If you saw a situation where, if the parameter has a very dangerous value and you change it a little bit, the world would change radically, and we'd be dead. We couldn't possibly live. You would wonder where that came from. You know, how is that possible? So just on the face of it, you would look at the situation and say, "Wow, someone really cared to put this parameter "at just the right value so that we get to be here "and that it's a pleasant universe and really cares a lot." This is the sort of thing that really keeps you up at night. It really makes you wonder, "Maybe we've got something "about the whole picture, the big picture, totally, totally, totally wrong." - Before I went to elementary school, my mother started telling me biblical stories. She told me that if we are good, we'll go to paradise, and we will stay there forever. And when she said "forever," I started panicking. I kept asking, "Forever?" "Forever?" You mean, it never ends? Like, you wake up, and you know that then, you go back to sleep, and this never ends, never ends, never ends. I started crying. She told me, "What's wrong with you? "This is paradise. "It will be a lot of fun. You'll be very happy there." But this idea of eternity, something infinite, scared me. - There is a scientific alternative to believing there's someone out there who loves us, twiddling the dials very finely for things to work out. And this alternative, said briefly, is that everything we see in our observed universe is actually a very small part of a much, much vaster multiverse. You might literally imagine that, from some bird's eye point of view, if you went to enormous distances, you would see that our universe is actually a little pocket inside a vastly bigger space. In this picture, these mysterious numbers, like the cosmological constant, are actually basically random. And out there in the multiverse, next to us somewhere, is another region where these numbers take on some other random value, and then another region where they take on some other random value still. Only in a tiny sliver, a minuscule part of this gigantic multiverse, for completely accidental reasons, do these numbers take on the very, very special values which allows structures to grow, stars to form, galaxies to form. Ultimately, things like us to form. This is the really opposite extreme interpretation of the presence of fine-tuning as intelligent designers would want to give. If you believe that someone out there cares and twiddles the parameters so that you can exist, that puts our existence at the very core of reality. If you believe that our entire universe is a tiny, little, minuscule spec in a gigantic multiverse which is mostly lethal, that's a polar opposite philosophy for what the universe looks like. In fact, it's an idea that many physicists loathe, because certain questions then become things that we will not hope to be able to understand. - Nima is now an advocate for this idea that the laws of physics are different in different parts of this multiverse, that what we measure in experiments are not deep mysteries of nature, but they're just random accidents in our universe, that maybe even the Higgs itself is a random accident that has occurred in our universe and let's life exist, but has no explanation. In a sense, it's the end of physics. - On the one hand, we have the direction that we've been on for the last 400 years, towards increasing beauty, simplicity, symmetry, and a path that has time and time again paid off with deeper and deeper insights about the way the world works. On the other hand, we have the idea of the multiverse, which would move us to a real picture not of symmetry and beauty and order, but fundamentally of chaos on enormous distances. This is the really very, very big-scale question which the LHC is going to push us in one way or the other. - What happens, for example, if. Oh, blimey. Yeah, there's a lot of. Hi, Katja. You all right? Oh, you're not recording this, huh? Yes, we're all on the. - Yeah, don't worry about all the other crap. We've got the beams going around again. The magnet repairs are holding up well, and our next challenge is to take these beams up to high energy and collide them. Okay. - We're very, very aware of the damage we can do. Here we go. - That's what worries me stiff at the moment. - The original proposal for ATLAS was in 1989. And you're kind of riding this idea. You've got this dream of physics. This dream of physics is what pulled everyone along for those 19 years. And so here, now, today, finally, with high-energy collisions, we can start to look for that dream of new physics. Uh, blue. The control room, yes. The control room. This is the control room. - The pressure of it being an event, of course, is there. And, of course, anything can go wrong, and it has. Last weekend was a complete disaster. We were discussing the possibility that we do collisions during the night rather than the plan, 9:00 in the morning. Of course, this has caused major, sort of knock-ons for, one, the experiments, and two, for the media service. Good morning, everybody. I propose we start. I will take you briefly over the whole summary of the weekend, just to get you up to date what happened. During the night, we tried to set up again for high intensities, for 450 GeV collisions, but then we were cut short because we encountered a vacuum. - What everybody wants, from a physics point of view and from being sure, is doing it secretly before and showing it to the media during the day. And I think this was also the wish of Fabiola. It's the wish of everybody, because this is, of course, then you're much more certain. But this does not work nowadays. Media wants to see this little risk. I understand. So that means we have to adapt to that. Let's see. This. this is not it. It doesn't seem like. You got to hit the reload. I'm reloading it. Yeah, I wonder if we should stop. Everyone is reloading it. Maybe we should stop. There you go. - Hey! - All right. Okay, now. And, indeed, welcome to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva. Welcome to the CERN control center. And here on the screen we can see the four different experiments: ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, and ALICE. And the program for today is to first send one beam in one direction, a second beam in the opposite direction. They will circulate in parallel for a while, and when everything is ready and under control, the separation is going to be removed, and the beams are going to be made to collide in the four points around the LHC machine. - I just think to myself, if you imagine, like, Thomas Edison, like, inventing the lightbulb. if he had tried to invent the lightbulb with, like, a hundred camera crews in his workshop, and they would've been like, "Oh, my God, "you can't even turn it on? "Come on! Turn it on now! "Come. ugh, we're still waiting? Come on. Ah, come on. What's wrong with this guy?" - So the violet. there's always one vertical, horizontal beam. One beam. Shh! Please. So a few minutes. Okay, thank you. Thank you, bye. Wow. Everybody hear? Few minutes away. - So we should watch that one, our trigger rate, this one, the separation bumps, and the event displays. Okay, these are the three screens to watch. If you have three eyes, one there, one here, and one over there. - So, okay, both beams are at 3.5 TeV, and we've just collapsed the separation bumps and brought the beams into collision inside the four experiments. - Starting. - They're starting. They're starting. - Oh. - Ooh. Okay, they're starting. - Two beams, one in blue, one in red, each circulating in opposite directions. They have to get closer and closer. When the numbers on the four readers say zero, it means that the beams are finally aligned. This is the historical moment we were all expecting. It can be anytime now. Wow! Wow! Fantastic! Beautiful. - Wow. - We are ready. First things first. I just have to say: "data." It's. it's unbelievable how fantastic data is. You have this invariant mass. This is for the Z to mu-mu channel. And you have this mass peak of the Z, in order to estimate your backgrounds. It's like the world at ATLAS and LHC and CMS and all those places has suddenly changed. I mean, it's like, all of a sudden, there's data. And after so many years of not having data and new data, new physics, there's just so much possibility, and even though you're rediscovering the Standard Model, that is more exciting. But the most exciting thing about the data is not the first collision. Because the first collision, okay, great. First collision, everyone loves the first. But the most exciting thing about the data is the, you know, 1 millionth collision or the 2 millionth collision or the fact that collisions just keep coming and coming and coming and coming, and the more and more collisions we have, the more and more chance we have to look at the interesting physics, because it just means more and more and more data for us. The running is pretty good. - But right now, it's running amazingly. Yeah, right now, but the day of reckoning is in several months. We heard rumors on that. - Well, we should be hearing rumors now. We really should be hearing rumors now. - I'm a little worried, actually. Yeah. - Well, we're hearing murmurs. - What, what's. Murmurs. We're hearing murmurs. There either. there isn't much there, or they're doing a very good job keeping a poker face. - Or they're still at the point where half of. where they're still trying to figure out what's a murmur and what's a rumor, internally. And I think that's probably actually true. Right. The problem is that, also, I take completely innocent remarks and vastly over-interpret them. - Obviously, we're going to learn about the first discovery on Twitter and Facebook. - That's so sad, but I think it's true. It is. - You mean, I shouldn't check the arXiv first thing in the morning. I need to check my Facebook? - The arXiv is the last thing. - The arXiv is the last. - First, like, check Nima's Twitter feed. Then check the arXiv. If Nima has a Twitter feed, then there's something has been discovered. It is August 7, 2011, and, this is a significant time for the LHC. The first big set of data was presented at the end of July. The data has little extra bits in it which could be interpreted as a Higgs. Even though the LHC is running at half power, it actually has gotten data much, much faster than anybody expected. And that allowed them to be sensitive to the Higgs boson. It's fucking cool right now. There was huge excitement because the Higgs' results of the two main detectors, CMS and ATLAS, were first shown, together, in the same meeting. For me, as Run Coordinator, I discussed every little problem where we lost here a little bit of data and there a little bit of data, so somehow I really feel attached to this data set. So somehow it makes me proud if the Higgs is found or not with this data set. - The three, two, ones, so the effect. - The mass of the Higgs, namely the weight of the Higgs, can actually tell us or give us a hint about what comes next. If the mass is on the lighter side, then that's consistent with some of the standard things we've been looking for. Supersymmetry generally favors that the Higgs is as light as possible. About 115 times the mass of the proton. It's 115 GeV: Giga electron volts. If, on the other hand, the Higgs is 140 GeV, 140 times the mass of the proton, it's a terrible mass, because 140 GeV is associated with theories that rely on the multiverse. ATLAS has a little bump here, a small excess visible near 140. And now, holy crap. It's 140! It's starting to look like nature has made its choice. - What do we learn if the LHC does discover a Higgs at 140 and nothing else? Chaos. Okay? - The problem with the multiverse is that it says the Higgs might be the last particle we ever see. - So what we should do. - I think the Higgs mass issue. - If we don't see any new particles besides the Higgs, we don't get any explanation for dark matter. We don't know how the Higgs itself got a mass. We never get access to the deeper theory. All that information could be in the other universes. We may be at the end of the road. That's it. I guess, um. Well, if it's right at that number, then it would be so fucking astounding. Where the F is SUSY, right? I mean, there's nothing. I mean, where's all the other stuff? Where are the other particles? What happened to dark matter? I mean. - I've heard of many theories saying that new particles might be at even higher energies, so. Right. - Who knows? I mean, it always comes differently. Who knows if there are other interesting things. You know, somehow it always comes differently than you expect. - I know that the theorists are all up in arms, because, you know, it could be a heavy Higgs, but, you know, I've always said, like, the worst-case scenario, I think, would be Higgs and Higgs only. - Who knows? - I know. I know. - Come on, it's just a little excess. - If this doesn't show up by the end of next year, then we can change subject, I think. If you don't see any supersymmetric signal. - Well, but if it's 140, that would be serious. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Don't tell me. This is my nightmare. It's only 30 for me. At the moment, it's scary. - At the moment, it's scary. - It's scary. - Yes, then we have to wait another couple of years for the next round. No, another two years, I'm saying. But still, it doesn't matter. You'll be working harder. No, but independent of that, I think you'll know the truth. Yes, yes, no. - And that's the important thing. No, you're right. Yes, of course. - Coffee is a very serious business in the life of a theorist. It's not like physics research, where you can wait for 30 years before you know if you are right. Within a few minutes, it pays off. If you succeed, it's great. If you fail, you get to try another one in another minute. In particle physics, you construct a theory 20 years ago, and it may take that long before you know if you're on the right track. Jumping from failure to failure with undiminished enthusiasm is the big secret to success. - Well, the hint that the Higgs was 140 GeV has disappeared. All of the new data that just came in didn't make the peak bigger. It sort of filled in the gaps. And now the peak doesn't look very good. In fact, the belief is that it's gone away and that the Higgs can't be 140 GeV. In order for us to believe that we've discovered it, that peak needs to be big and basically keep growing as the data comes in. It's a statistical thing. We call it the Greek letter "sigma." If you reach a height of 5 sigma, that's when you know that you've seen something. And the probability that that just happens by accident is 1 in 31/2 million. But the Higgs, it's not at 140, which is a bit of a relief, because there's still hope it might be down around 115. We like 115, because if the Higgs is that light, the theory says there has to be new particles, like supersymmetry, otherwise the universe is unstable. It wouldn't have survived this long. - This is one of the one of the few truly perfect academic institutions in the world. I mean, there's no excuse. no excuse at all. not to think and work and get things done. That's its only problem. There's no excuse at all not to think and work and get things done. You can't blame it on anything if it doesn't work. - Okay, supersymmetry versus multiverse. Oh, boy. All right. That's, uh. If we're going to start doing that, this is going to be interesting. We have been anticipating that whatever happens is going to throw the field in one direction or another. Oh, shit! Now that we're really on the doorstep of actually knowing the actual number, I really care intensely about what that number is. Well, faster than we thought, there's news that there's going to be another announcement about the Higgs. I've heard tons of rumors, and I've heard they're things on blogs, and there's already stuff in the newspaper. - 18 hours or so until the announcement, so I'm really looking forward to what they're going to say, and I want to be there. Actually, I'm thinking of going early in the morning, or I'll send my young colleagues, who have more stamina to sit and occupy a chair for me. It is July 3rd. the night of July 3, 2012, and I am driving to Princeton, to the Institute, to hang out with Nima and a big crowd, who are all staying up until 3:00 in the morning because they're going to present the Higgs data at CERN at 9:00 in the morning Geneva time. Certainly the biggest thing that's happened. the discovery of new fundamental particles. in my lifetime. And the Higgs is a particle like no other, like nothing we've ever seen before, and it is weird, and we do not understand it, but. but, uh. and I missed my exit. <i>Cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf.</i> - You need quite some skills to sit on it. - It's possible. - Okay. - You know, there's one ball missing. Oh, it's, uh. exactly. No, there's one ball missing, so it's. you always think you fall down. Okay. - Look at some of these people, like, totally asleep. - Yeah, no, those are the sleeping bags. My volume is up. I don't know why I'm not getting sound. There isn't like, a thing on here with sound, is there? Who reads lips here? - Can anyone see if they get sound? Try streaming it in their offices or something? Many apologies, guys. I don't know what's going on. - Ah, Peter Higgs. - Ah, there he is. - Here he is. - Very good. Someone with an iPad. - Not as well seated as my summer student. - No! - Right. Peter Higgs doesn't even get a good seat. - Good morning, everybody here in Geneva. Today is a special day: we hear two presentations from the two experiments ATLAS and CMS. We are starting in a non-alphabetical order, and I ask Joe Incandela from CMS to take the floor. Okay. Okay. So I will give the status of the CMS Higgs search. I want to really dedicate this to the CMS collaboration. This is a picture we took last week. We had a party. This is only 400 or 500 people. Remember, there are 4,000 people in the experiment. This is not the real CMS detector. That's down underground. This is the spare that we keep upstairs. So one page for the theorists. That's all they deserve. No, I'm kidding. The Standard Model is here. is shown here. This is what we know. And we have now. But one of the big stories of this year was, as you know. those of you in the field. is pile-up. We had to deal with very intense beams like never before seen in the field with many, many interactions, and this slide shows. the colors correspond to tracks from different particles. And it was in these kind of events that we're looking for one of the rarest particles ever made, and that's what we call the Higgs. And so this is where things stood last week. As you know, if you look at the radiative corrections. So if you know the W and top mass very well, you can actually predict a long band. - Yeah, yeah, so we're there at four. One at the Tevatron. They really had a tour de force measurement. Ah, sorry, yeah, here it is. - And we end up with four event classes. Ah, there it is! - Okay, so, to wrap up, in summary: we conclude by saying that we have observed a new boson with a mass of 125.3 plus or minus 0.6 GeV at 4.9 standard deviations. Thank you. 125.3. Okay, so now. Wow, 125? Do you know ATLAS's result? This isn't. You heard about this? Okay. I think I can only say congratulations to everybody. I will say a few words more later. Now we go immediately to ATLAS. Fabiola Gianotti, please. Thank you. Good morning. ATLAS is very pleased to present here today updated results on Standard Model Higgs searches based on up to 10.7 inverse femtobarn of data recorded in 2011 and 2012, and it's a big honor and a big emotion for me to represent this fantastic collaboration at this occasion. So let's go to the results for this channel. You can see here the results for the 2011 to 2012 and the combination of the two. The gamma jet and jet-jet background with one or both jet. requirement that the energy in a cone around the photon is below. a structure which reproduces very well the LHC bunch rate with three bunch, small gaps. so then, of course, we collect. Yeah. - A few GeV and a few hundred GeV at the level. is fit in the nine different categories with an exponential function to model the background, so, no theoretical prediction, no Monte Carlo. The background is determined from the side bands of the possible signal. From this spectrum, the background fit, you get this plot here. Now the grand combination. Here it goes. - So this distribution is extremely clean, except one big spike here. in this region here. Excess with a local significance of 5.0 sigma at a mass of 126.5 GeV. Good. As a layman, I would now say, "I think we have it." - Come, Lyn, come here. - Come here! Okay. - There's Peter. - Peter is there. - Yeah. Get Peter. - Peter's there. Peter! - Well, I would like to add my congratulations to everybody involved in this tremendous achievement. For me, it's really an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime. - Not only in your lifetime, Peter. That's a great day, huh? That's a great day. And I think all of us, and all of the people outside watching it in the different meeting rooms, everybody who was involved and is involved in the project can be proud of this day. Okay, enjoy it. We found the Higgs! - Scientists this morning announced they are almost certain they have discovered what's being called the "God Particle." It is not every day that you see a whole bunch of scientists standing up with champagne bottles and cheering. - Now, the God Particle, we physicists wince when we hear those words. - It's the last piece of the puzzle physicists have been looking for for decades. - Thank you all. - Thank you for your attention. Thanks to everybody on the panel. If I could just ask you all to remain seated just for a few minutes. Clear passage here, please. Clear passage here, please. Can we have a clear passage? - Thank you. - Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. - I did feel a sense of pride when the Higgs was announced, but I felt a sense of pride for humanity, that, you know, we little people on a little planet with tiny brains can go so deep and understand what happens. Now we're talking about subnuclear distances a thousand times smaller than an atomic nucleus. Nevertheless, we can get things right, and just the power of the human mind. It's astonishing that there are any laws of nature at all, that they're describable by mathematics, that mathematics is a tool that humans can understand, that the laws of nature can be written on a page. It's the greatest of all mysteries. There is a strong sense that we are hearing nature talk to us. Turns out, the Higgs mass is about as interesting as it could be. It's sort of in no man's land. It doesn't prefer symmetries, and it doesn't prefer multiverse, but it's right in the middle. The data is puzzling enough that it hasn't excluded any of the theories I was involved with, but it hasn't confirmed them either. But until we look at detailed properties of the Higgs, and until we have the high-energy version of the LHC in a couple of years, we will not be able to make a stronger statement. - The most important, first lesson of the discovery of the Higgs is that physics works. The Higgs, on the one hand, completes the most successful scientific theory we've ever had, on the other hand, opens the door to some very major paradoxes that we now must address. We're at a fork in the road, and the LHC is steadfastly refusing to push us in one direction or the other: the multiverse on the one side, and some beautiful symmetry on the other side. It's cranking up the suspense as much as it possibly can. - Before the LHC started, we would always say, "New physics is just around the corner." And now we're kind of like, "New physics is still out there." And, for one, I'm not discouraged by this, by any means, because we know that new physics has to be out there. The next step is, the LHC goes into a shutdown, stays off for two years for improvements and upgrades, and when it returns, it's going to be twice the energy. And for sure, my vote's for supersymmetry. Jesus. That was exciting. If this is true, the Higgs is about 125 GeV, and that means. um, yeah, actually almost all of my models are ruled out, which. all the supersymmetry models, which is pretty cool. I mean, supersymmetry could still be true, but it would have to be a very strange version of the theory. And if it's the multiverse. well, other universes would be amazing, of course, but it could also mean no other new particles discovered, and then a Higgs with a mass of 125 is right at a critical point for the fate of our universe. Without any other new particles, that Higgs is unstable. It's temporary. And since the Higgs holds everything together, if the Higgs goes, everything goes. It's amazing that the Higgs, the center of the Standard Model, the thing we've all been looking for, could actually also be the thing that destroys everything. The creator and the destroyer. But we could discover new particles, and then none of that would be true. And anyway, we have something to do. <i>- There is a very nice sentence in the Divine Comedy by Dante</i> <i>who says, "Nati non fummo a viver come bruti,</i> <i>ma per seguir virtute e canoscenza,"</i> which means, "We were not born "to live as animals, but to pursue knowledge and virtue." So science and knowledge are very important, like art is very important. It's a need of mankind. I just saw, two weeks ago, Werner Herzog talking about and then screening his new movie. But it was about these incredible caves that they discovered a few years ago in France. Stunningly beautiful. Gorgeously drawn horses, bison, rhinoceros, lions, because, 40,000 years ago, this is what was going on there. - In exploration. - and science is exploration. there needs to be the set of people who have no rules, and they are going into the frontier and come back with the strange animals and the interesting rocks and the amazing pictures, and to show us what's out there, discover something. Why do humans do science? Why do they do art? The things that are least important for our survival are the very things that make us human. Listen, you're in a privileged position to learn a thing or two. Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. Runteldat. I been through so much, you know, in my life, so. I kind of wanted to get back out and tell my own story. Maryland, DC, is my hometown, so I grew up here. I'm a little man, so you kind of get the 'little man"complex sometimes. You feel like you gotta fight for everything. You even gotta fight for when the french fries have been taken from you. First of all. We would like to thank God. who just helping us to see another day to get up to bring you comedy. Can you hear what the fuck I'm saying? I'm not saying that all people in the media are bad. Some of them do theirjob. Some of them do the research. and they report the truth. Actor and comedian Martin Lawrence. was apprehended by Los Angeles police offiicers yesterday. after he was discovered in the middle of one of LA 's most congested streets. hurling obscenities at passing cars. The popular television personality was admitted to a nearby hospital. by LAPD offiicers after they subdued him by force. No one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life. No one. We all have ups, and we all have downs. I mean, that's just life. Martin Lawrence's current scrape with the law. could be evidence of Martin's mania. Something's obviously gone wrong in this man's head. I mean, hejust settled a case out of court. because he attacked somebody with a bottle who was making a toast. Why? Well, apparently, he didn't like the phrasing. Martin's acting like a madman, and people don't think it's funny. But other people in the media, some reporters. and some tabloids, they ain't interested in the truth. All right? They like to sensationalize bullshit. You do the math. From bad boy on the big screen. to a menace in real life. how far will Martin's fans go to stand behind their tarnished hero? It's easy to fade into obscurity in Hollywood. Martin better watch out. If Martin doesn't clean up his act, he's not gonna be acting anywhere. - I'm not perfect. I'm only human. - Important words to live by. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em. Girl. Fuck 'em. We're all one 'cause we're all human, you know. We experience a lot of the same things. Just as we wake, we sleep. Just as we live, we die. That's just life, human nature. He had a body temperature registering. at slightly over 107 degrees Fahrenheit. He was, at that time, in a coma and unresponsive. Fuck dying. Fuck dying. Mama said. "The world is yours. Don't sleep." Fuck dying. After spending three days in a coma. Martin Lawrence's condition is improving. His eyes will focus on a person. He can't talk just yet because we do have a tube down his throat. But he is alert, and he is improving. One of the achievements I'm most proud of is. to be where I'm at in this business today. after everything that I've been through. You know, I can honestly say I'm blessed. There's all kind of folks that was just negative. when it came to Marty. - I remember that shit. - Right. Well. We still here. and they can run tell that. Runteldat. Nigger. We've been mashing city to city for six months. putting this tour together. I think doing stand-up comedy. is one of the hardest things that somebody could do, you know? You know, when you get on stage and you got the microphone. and thousands of people, you know. waiting for you to make 'em laugh, you got to bring it. That's why I love it. You know, it's a challenge. It's who I am. Yeah, it's game time. Ladies and gentlemen, Martin Lawrence! Come on! DC. I love you. DC. I love you. I'm home. I'm home. I love you so much. Thank you. That was. Hey. What can I say? You make it all worth it. What can I say. You know? This is what it's about. Thank you. Oh. Man. And y'all look good. Everybody's dressed tonight. Came out. "Fuck it. We going to see that nigger. Fuck it. Show him some love." Well. I had to come out tonight. I don't know if you just saw the film. the tape and everything. I said. "Fuck it. I got to come out and tell my own story." I ain't waitin' for the E! True Hollywood Story to tell my shit. You know what I mean? Fuck that. I got to tell my own shit. I see you. Baby. Hey. How you doin'? Yeah. Hello. The ladies just screamin' like a motherfucker. Yeah. Thank you. I know. But if you want to scream. please send your panties up here. Okay? Just put your number on your panties. and I'll get back according to the smell. Before I left the hotel. I was watching something on TV. this lady. I'm gonna say. If you smoke. please be careful. 'cause I saw this lady on TV had a hole in her neck. It was real bad. Anybody see that shit? She was smoking the cigarette with her neck. And she's. Like. And blowing the O's and shit with her neck. Did anybody see that? Please be careful if you smoke. 'Cause that lady had a hole in her neck. You could see food falling. When she eat. You could see string beans and pudding and all that shit. You know? I bet her breath don't stink. Her neck probably fuckin' stink. huh. Man? You just put a fuckin' Altoid in her neck and shit. If she choke on something. You ain't gotta worry about the Heimlich. You just go right in the neck. Got that. Yeah. A piece of gristle. Baby. That's all that was. A piece of gristle. You got to love a woman with a hole in her neck. Fellas. You do. Take her out to eat and shit. Got a hole in her fuckin' neck. But you get mad. "Look. Goddamn it. Look at your neck. What have you got to fuckin' come to the restaurant with your neck all out? Got the fuckin' maître d' looking at ya. Shit. Goddamn. Oh. You couldn't put on a turtleneck or nothin' tonight? Couldn't put no mock neck on? None of that shit?" They say this lady got a man. I know they be doing some freaky shit. I know he come home. "Baby. I want to do something a little different tonight. Let me put my dick in your neck. Oh. That's some good neck there. That's some good neck there. Fuck head. I said neck. I like neck." Her ass straight to here and shit. And I'd like to say. if there's any critics here tonight. fuck you and kiss my ass. I don't give a shit about you. They're like the scum of the earth to me. Fuck them. I can't stand a critic. My mother don't like me to say that I hate. But I can't stand 'em. What the fuck is a critic anyway? That's somebody that can't do what you can do. so they want to criticize your shit. You know what I mean? Think they authority on some shit. You want to criticize somethin'. criticize these nuts. Fuck you. I don't see you talkin' about my balls on the news. "One of Martin's balls is bigger than the other. I give that a two star." Get the fuck out of here. Man. But you know what? When I think about everything that's going on. Critics are so unimportant to what's going on with the USA attacks. everything that happened here. The Pentagon and New York. All that stuff. My heart goes out to families that have went through all this and lost people. I feel for 'em. And it's a sad thing. It really is a sad thing because. I'm glad to be an American. This is the best country in the world. I can say that. You know. I wouldn't want to be nowhere else. but when I seen this shit happen. I think any of us could've been on them planes and anything that happened. been in one of them buildings that they crashed into. Any-fuckin'-body in here. Know what I mean? If it affects one person. it affects us all. And now my nerves are bad. y'all. After this shit. I got to drink Milk of Magnesia and shit. Every time before I board a plane. I don't know what the fuck's going on. But out of all this. This is one of the first times in a long time. since I don't know when. This is one of the first times. I seen black and white people together on something. Standing for a cause. It wasn't about race. It's just about life. You know what I mean? Nothin' else but life. Together on somethin'. We will get together and fuck you up today. on this USA attacks. you know what I mean? I ain't seen black and white people together since. Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney did "Ebony and Ivory." So now. If I go to board a plane. if you like me. you get nervous as a motherfucker. you see somebody boardin'. You sit there talking to your white friend. "What's up. White boy. I don't know you. but we getting on this plane together and shit. Might as well be together. Who's that motherfucker getting on the plane right there? You don't know that motherfucker? Oh. Shit. Hakbim. You about to get on this motherfuckin' plane. Man? Don't start no motherfuckin' shit when we get on this plane. All right? I'll punch you in your motherfuckin' mouth. Nigger. Nigger. Don't go for your hands. Don't move your hands. Hold on. What you got in your shoes. Nigger? What the fuck you got in your shoes? I'm-a tell you. Don't start no shit when we get on this plane. Nigger. I will knock your motherfuckin' ass the fuck out. I ain't playin'. We ain't done shit. Don't start nothin'. 'Cause the white boy can wrestle. and I can box. Motherfucker. He'll tackle your ass. and I'll punch the fuck out you. Don't start no shit." But your nerves is bad with these USA attacks and shit. You don't know what's going on. They lookin' for bin Laden. They ain't found his ass yet. How you not find. You blew up all that shit. And you ain't found bin Laden yet? That motherfucker at a club right now. What the fuck is that shit about? Ain't found no bin Laden. You know why? 'Cause a lot of motherfuckers look like bin Laden. There's a nigger in McDonald's right now look just like bin Laden. Got a high-top fade and every-fuckin'-thing. You walk in that motherfucker to get a cheeseburger. "Bin Laden! That's bin Laden! Call the government. That's motherfuckin' bin Laden. I know a motherfuckin' bin Laden when I see. Call the Taliban. Nigger. That's him." 'Cause they looked. Man. You can't even find his ass. I almost fucked an Indian up on the way in here. He said. "No. I Indian. I Indian." I said. "Pull your turban up. Nigger. Let me see a dot or somethin'. motherfucker. I'll fuck your ass up. Don't start no shit. I'll crack that fuckin' dot. Don't start it." It's just all crazy. What's this shit about you can't open up mail? What the fuck is that shit? You can't open up fuckin' mail? You open up mail. you all fucked up. What the fuck is that shit? Can't open mail. That's probably a good thing for the bill collectors though. You know. They call your house. "Hi. Mr. Lawrence. Yeah. I sent out a bill about three weeks ago. and I haven't received payment on that. I was wondering if. Was there a problem? Well. Is there a reason that that's not paid?" "Ain't you been watching the news. Nigga? I can't open it. Motherfucker. They got powder and shit in there. that makes you lose your eyebrows in 4.2 seconds. Motherfucker. You're welcome to bring your ass over here and open it yourself. Mr. Bill Man." It's fucking crazy. Man. Anthrax. This shit just don't make no sense. Now. I'll tell you. life is so short. Y'all. You know. Please. just realize that. You're not promised tomorrow. you know. You really ain't. You're not. Every day you get a chance to wake up. you gotta really be grateful. Most importantly. Be grateful. and ride this motherfucker till the wheels fall off. Live your life. Ride this motherfucker till the wheels fall off. When it's time to go. You're gone. Fuck it. You don't owe nobody. Fuck it. If you do owe 'em. You're gone. They can't get it. So now with all that. You know. that gets you down every now and then. 'Cause you see it every time you turn on the news and all that. It's something that's gonna be with us a long time. You know. That's just. for the rest of our lives. I'm trying to do things that make me feel good. Like. I'm watching Cops. Black people. Come on. Y'all know we on Cops every fuckin' week. Every motherfuckin' week. Cops. Black people. Starring black people. We runnin' through the motherfucker with helicopters chasing us and shit. Go to commercial. Come back. We still runnin' and shit. Runnin' like a motherfucker. You know. Just runnin' in the fuckin' street. Man. But one thing I noticed on Cops. Is it me? But white people get away with a lot of shit with the cops. They talk to the cop. They talk back like a motherfucker. They cuss their ass out. "What the fuck did you pull me over for? I don't give a shit. I want to know what did you pull me over for. I didn't fuckin' do nothin'. Asshole. You fuckin' asshole. You're an asshole. You're an asshole. and you're a dick. Yes. Fuck that. Man. You don't pull me over for nothin'. Yeah. I know I was speeding. ya fuck. I'm in a rush. What the fuck is wrong with you? You're an asshole. And fuck you. You're an asshole. And you're a dick. You know what. why don't you put your dick in your ass? Fuck you. Fuck you. My dad's gonna have your ass. There goes your $5 million donation. You fuck. See your ass in court. Buddy." They cuss the cops out like a motherfucker. Black people. We don't do that shit no more. Ever since that Rodney King ass-whupping. We shut the fuck up. 'Cause you never know if that shit's gonna be us on TV tomorrow on tape. They pull us over. We. "What's the problem. Officer? Yes. Was I what? I was speedin'? Damn. Where's the light? I didn't even see me go through the light. Damn it. Look here. Would you give me a ticket? Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause I got to learn. I got to fuckin' learn. You know. Let me give you my full name. my middle name. Let me spell that for you and stuff." We only that nice 'cause we know we got some shit under the seat. Who knows what that is? But. Latinos. They act like they ain't from this country. They don't speak their English when they get pulled over. till they see that ticket price. They get pulled over. "No. No. What I do? I don't know. I don't know what I do. Speedy Gonzalez? Was I caught speeding? Don't know." They see that ticket. "Motherfucker. This is bullshit!" But I talk about watching positive programs. You know. I joke about the cop shit. 'cause ain't nothin' positive about that. gettin' arrested. I'll tell you that. But a program that is positive. if you ever get a chance to see it. it's called Eye on the Prize. This program will make you cry. you know. I'm serious. If you ever seen it. You've seen that. It's a beautiful thing. I'll tell you. I love America. This is the best country in the world. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. But I'm a black man. and I ain't forgot. what the fuck we. As black people. have been through in America. You know what I mean? We ain't gonna just act like shit is all right. but we gonna work towards change. to make it better. That's what people. in this Eye on the Prize. have done for us. They put their lives out there so that we can be in the forefront. so that we can better ourselves. Isn't that beautiful. When you look at Eye on the Prize. when you think of segregation and civil rights and all those things? When I was watching Eye on the Prize, you had Martin Luther King. you know. great man in history. Malcolm X. great man in history. standing up for us. so that we could sit together. blacks and whites. Work together. Freedom! Grow together. That's beautiful. Martin said. "Nonviolent. Nonviolent. We shall overcome. I've been to the mountaintop. Nonviolent. Nonviolent." Malcolm said. "Yeah. but by any means necessary." Martin said. "Nonviolent. Nonviolent." "By any means necessary." Martin and Malcolm were saying the same thing. They just had different opinions and different approaches to it. I thought that was beautiful. I said. "That's all right." But then one day I was watchin'. and Martin Luther King. And I'm named after Martin. I was proud. Martin! I watched him go through Birmingham. Alabama. And this racist white boy picked up a rock. you know. Like a half a boulder or some shit. He pitched that motherfucker like he was pitchin' for the Orioles. and hit Martin in his head. And all Martin did was say. "Nonviolent. Nonviolent. Don't nobody do nothin'. Nonviolent. Nonviolent. My head's bleeding right now. Don't nobody do nothin'. We shall overcome. I've been to the mountaintop. I'm having a dream right now. Nonviolent. Nonviolent. Nonviolent." I was proud. I said. "Damn. That takes a strong man to get hit in the head. with a half a boulder and still say 'nonviolent. ' Damn!" But if you're like me. then one time you would have loved to hear Martin say. "Another one of you motherfuckers hit me with a rock. I'll beat your bitch ass. you motherfucker. Fuck that. Coretta. These niggers think I'm soft. Let me show you how Martin get down. Motherfucker. This is how Martin get down." I know he got on his boys. I know he was here and said. "Jesse. Damn it. Jesse. You seen who threw that fuckin' rock. Jesse. Get off your ass and go handle that. Stop chasing them ho's. Jesse." Can I get a little water? I gotta ask y'all. There's predominantly black people in here. They don't want you to pause in no show. "Come on. Hurry up." Somebody put something in his mouth. My zipper's stuck. Y'all. I warned you. Watch your mouth now. Don't forget who the original DefJam host was. Motherfucker. I know I'm gettin' old. Thirty-six. Man. You know. Gettin' older. Yeah. You don't do the same things you do when you get older. I want to grow old gracefully. Gettin' old ain't no joke. It's. Like. You know. When you see older people. old people. you gotta really show 'em some respect and love. 'cause there's a lot of wisdom there. They're livin' their life. They got seniority here in this life. You gotta show 'em some love. Man. I know when I get old. That's why I said until that point. I'm gonna ride this motherfucker till the wheels fall off. Live your life. I'm sure that's what an old person will tell you. You think about it. You look around. This is just a body of life right here. You got some young. You got some old and everything. Just look around. That's what it is. It goes in a cycle. You go young. Old. Old. Young. Young. Old. And that's it. That's about fuckin' it. Think about it. The shit just recycles itself. Like. The same things happen. When you're a baby. you got one tooth. When you get old. you got one motherfuckin' tooth just hanging on. Just. And that motherfucker fragiler than a motherfucker. You gotta cut the apple to eat the shit. You know. When you're a baby. you know what I mean. you wear diapers. When you get old. You got motherfuckin' adult Pampers on. When you're a baby. you're in that little walker. trying to strengthen your legs. tryin' to walk. When you get old. You're in that metal motherfuckin' walker. You got one patch of hair when you're a baby. You got a patch of fuckin' hair when you're old. You try to cornrow that motherfucker. Tryin' to hang on to what little hip-hop you got left. It's just a cycle that goes like that. That's all it is. A cycle. When I get old. I don't give a fuck. don't do me no favors. Leave me at home. Let me watch the birds. Like I said. Don't be taking me to no motherfucking game. "Martin would want to go to the basketball game." They'd take me to the game and then announce me. "Ladies and gentlemen. We got Martin Lawrence in the house." I'm older than a motherfucker. All they do is sit you up front and exploit the fuck out you. Got the camera all in your face and shit. You sittin' there. Can't even follow the basketball game and shit. You down here. They playin' down this motherfucker. Catch you falling asleep and shit. Don't put me at no motherfuckin' game and sit me up front. puttin' an old-ass Washington Wizard hat on me. With Jordan's signature on the motherfucker. Talk about. "How's he like the game?" "He says it's wonderful." I ain't said shit. I said. "Get my ass home. I don't want to do shit. I'm chillin'." I'll tell you. The beauty of getting old is that you do things differently. Know what I mean? Even your dancin' changes when you get older. Young people. They go do all the wild stuff. Old people don't do that. They keep it in one place. "All right. Now. That's what I'm talking about right there. Yeah. Ain't gonna do too much more than this here tonight. That's right. Ain't gonna have me winded out this motherfucker all night. I got about two more dips in me now. One dip. All right. That's it. That's it. One more dip. I'm done. Shit. I'm tired. I ain't gonna be doin' that shit all night. You tryin' to kill a motherfucker." There's a dance out right now. A lot of people like this dance. It's like the. What is it? It's like the Electric Slide. but it's not quite the Electric Slide. The cha-cha? Yeah. I can't stand that fuckin' dance. That's a easy fuckin' dance. Y'all. You know that dance is easy as shit. Come on. "Two to the right. One to the left. Stop. Think about it." Get the fuck out of here with that shit. "Take your leg like this here. Do your arm like this. Stop. Think about it." That bullshit. I know the fuckin' ghetto Hokey Pokey when I hear that shit. You know what I mean? "Do your hip like this one time. Now keep doing your hip like this." Get the fuck outta here. I respect a brother's hustle. but that's bullshit. Man. That shit easy. You know. The thing about gettin' old. I'll tell you. Gettin' older is like. If you have good kids and you raise good kids. your children will take care of you when you're older. Yeah. That's true. That's a beautiful thing. That's what you want. You want to raise good kids. I have two beautiful daughters. And I'm proud of them. I love them. Thank you. But you get. Kids will take. Good kids will take care of you. But you know them badass kids like the motherfuckin' Menendez brothers. you gotta whup their ass. Man. them little badass kids. If you don't get them bad kids when they're young. They will fuck you up. That's how them brothers did that shit to their mother and father. They ought to have their ass kicked. I don't like them badass kids. I tell you. You gotta get 'em early. 'cause if you don't. them motherfuckers will put you in time-out. They will say. "Get your ass in time-out. Dad. Get your fucking time-out. Dad!" "Goddamn. What did I do there. Dave? I don't know what the fuck I did wrong. What did I do?" "Just shut the fuck up and get a time-out!" You know what I mean? Telling you shit like. "Don't touch my Twinkies in the fridge. Motherfucker. I'll be home about 9:00." 'Cause they get all tall and lanky. and they bigger than you and shit. Then they think they run you. They try to run the phone that you pay the bill on. "Hang the motherfuckin' phone up. Dad! Hang the motherfuckin' phone up. Dad! I'm on the phone talkin' to my homies. Nigger!" Shit! You gotta get their little ass. Man. You gotta let them know. You gotta put fear in their heart. "I'm the parent. You ever raise up on me. I don't play that shit." They gotta fear you for the rest of their life. if they don't fear no-fucking-body else. That is yours. You gotta make 'em know. You gotta make 'em understand. Don't play with Daddy. Don't play with Mama. But you know what started some of that shit is that time-out. White people. Y'all started that. I ain't pickin' on you. But that time-out shit? Uh-uh! Ain't gonna work. You know. I seen this white kid tell his mother. "Fuck you. Mommy. You ho. You bitch. You ho. You bitch." All she said was. "Bobby. Go to time-out. Go to time-out. Bobby. You have some emotional issues that you need to deal with. Go to time-out." And all the way to time-out. he sang this shit. You ho, you bitch You bitch, you ho Putting mixes on it. Bitch, bitch ho All my bitches Say ho Shit! You don't tell no black parent that shit. Fuck you, you ho You bi. Take time-out. Pick up your teeth. Take time-out. Pick up your wisdoms. Take time and get my foot up out your ass. Fuck the time-out. That shit don't work. I know what happens is you're scared to discipline your child. 'cause now there's a law that says you can get arrested. if you whup your child's ass. Hey. Whup your child's ass. if they act up. If they're showing off. If they're showing off. that's when you whup their ass. Hey. Iook. I got a lot of ass-whuppings. and look at me now. But you gotta. If they're showing off. you gotta tear their ass up. You can't even be trippin' on that. You gotta do what you gotta do. I understand what the law's saying. You can't be in the street fighting them like you're in a real fight. Talkin' about. "Come on. Fuck that. You're gonna eat your Rice Krispies. You're gonna eat your Rice Krispies." I understand that shit. But you know what you gotta do? You gotta learn how to hit 'em quick and then walk 'em to the car. You gotta. Then walk 'em to the car. "Hi. Officer. Yeah. Oh. No. Just out taking a stroll. That's all. Yeah. Okeydokey.

That's why you gotta get 'em. You gotta scare them. They could be babies. Little infants. Little newborns. You gotta let 'em know. Instill that fear that you the parent.

You gotta catch 'em when they're coming out the pussy. "What up. you little motherfucker? This Daddy. Nigger! This Da. Get your little ass here! Get off. Get off the umbilical cord! Get the fuck off! Let me tell you something. I will knock your motherfucking ass out! Don't play with me! Don't come here. start no shit! Don't come here. start no shit!" Best believe. That's the gift that keeps on giving. When they 18. 19. go to them clubs and shit. partying with their friends. forgetting everything. They don't know nothing. Send a prerecorded tape to the DJ. "Get your little motherfucking ass home! Nigger. Get home now!" "Oh. Shit! I gotta go! Oh. God! My dad's in here! Who mixed him with Tupac? Who mixed him with Tupac? Oh. Shit!" Get 'em! Like I said. That's the gift that just keeps on giving. But that's what it's about. Man. And those are the bad kids. But you got good kids. It starts even in the. in the delivery room. like when. You know. the ladies are giving birth. And I commend you. Ladies. That's a wonderful thing. Woman. That you do. I commend you. To be able to do that is. It's beautiful. 'Cause I know. Men. we couldn't do it. If we had to have babies. there'd be one motherfucker in here. But ladies go through that. and the strength of a woman. Man. Wow! It's a wonderful thing. It's beautiful when you see that. You're getting ready to have the baby. and the baby's in there. You gotta be strong. Secure and know everything's gonna be all right. 'Cause if it's not. it'll fuck you up. You stand there with the nurse and shit looking. She in the hospital about to deliver that thing. You're with the nurse. "Is she gonna be all right? 'Cause she seems like she in a lot of pain." The nurse calming you down. You got the doctor over there. Then all of a sudden. The baby start coming out. And you go. "Oh. Shit! Oh. God! Oh! Look at the head on that little motherfucker! Oh. Man! Look at the fuckin' circumference on his head! Oh. Shit! He's tearing up the pussy! That was my fit! That was my fit! Oh. Fuck! Now look at that shit! All these years I look for that woman. I found her. And now the fit is all fucked up! I don't know! Talk to the doctor. Nothing. Baby. You're doing good. You're doing real good. We're just talking about how. just how well you're doing. Damn it. Iook how big that fucking hole is. Well. You tell me. Nurse. what am I supposed. Look at that hole! I can't follow that. What the fuck am I supposed to do. fuck her with my knee? Huh? Do some shit like this here? What is that shit? Oh. Shit. What the fuck is that big-ass. Twisty. tied-up baby hanging on? Oh. God. It looks like a. Oh. That's the umbilical. Okay. Oh. God. Oh. Shit! I'm nauseous. Oh. God. Oh. My God. What is that fuckin' chitlin bag hanging out the pussy? That's a big-ass chitlin bag. Looks like a fuckin' gizzard bag. Hold up. Now I'm confused. Is she a woman. or is she a fucking turkey? What the hell is that?" And then. And the baby's born. And then you ain't as nauseous no more. 'cause you just saw the strength of a woman. And it turned you on. You walk up to her. and the doctor clears out and stuff. Takes off all his surgical stuff. You pass him. Damn near passing out. Talking about. "I don't know how you do it." And you come up to her and say. "Damn. Girl. You did it. Baby. Yeah. You did it. You know. You somethin'. Yeah. I'll get you some ice chips. Hold on. Here's some ice chips. Okay. Yeah. You did it. I appreciate you. Girl. Yeah." And you're lookin' at her and stuff. and you look at the baby. And you're lookin' at her and stuff. and you look at the baby. You say. "Yeah. That's us. We did that. It's hard to believe that the night I had your legs on the chandelier. that's what we got. Yeah. Wow. Wow. Baby. I'm gonna let you get some rest. all right? I love you. I'm gonna let you get some rest. I'll be back. Okay. All right." So you start walking out. and it hits you. The strength of woman. that's a sexy fuckin' thing. You look back at her. She's so sexy to you now. You're ready to make another one again. Your dick start gettin' hard. and you're looking at her. You say. "That shit turned me on like a motherfucker." But you can't get no pussy for six weeks. So now you walking around. walking around. You're in the house by yourself. You gotta go back to the hospital to check on her. or you stay in the hospital in another room. Keep holding your meat in your hand. You don't wanna beat your meat. Then you go back down there. And you check on her a little bit and stuff. You say. "Hey. You all right? Yeah. So it's been a couple of weeks now. Girl. Yeah. The doctor say he put the dissolve stitches in. He said that there is a chance they could dissolve before six weeks is up. Okay. Well. Let me take a look there. Let me take a look. Open up. Open your legs. Does it hurt when I do like that there? So you don't feel this at all right here. Like that there? You don't feel that? You don't feel that at all? I'll wait. Shit!" Then you can't get titty for. Like. A year. Ayear you can't get titty? How long. Ladies. Is it exactly that you can breast-feed? - Five years! - Somebody say five years? Five years? Oh. Shit. That ain't breast-feeding. That's incest. You're walking around with a grown person on your titty. "He's just a little big for his age." That motherfucker draggin' his feet. sucking titty. Fuck that. Man. You can't get no titty for that long. A year. Whatever. Man? That's hard. 'cause I'm a titty man. Ooh. I love the titty. Mm-hmm. It's all right to applaud the titties. It's all right. I don't give a fuck what size the titties are. They could be big titties. Just give me a day to work on them. 'Cause I like to detail a titty real nice. You know what I mean? Oh. I like titties. Big titties. Small titties. big nipple titties or small nipple titties. You know. it can't just be a nipple. Okay? Cause I don't want to feel like I'm kissing on Earl or shit like that. But there gotta be a little cushion up under that nip. Just a little cushion up under the nip. then we be all right. I don't give a damn. They could be saggy titties. titties that hang to this side. titties that hang to that side. titties that hang over the fucking back. The ones that get smushy when you put your finger in 'em. and you take your hand off. They still got fingerprints in the motherfucker. Stretch mark titties. I don't give a damn. I lick between the lines. Like a stamp. I likes a titty. And when you can't get that titty. you miss it. 'cause the baby got the titty on lockdown. Baby at home. And you see your wife or your lady laying in the bed. You see the baby on one titty and you. "Damn. Why can't I get some of the tit?" You know there's an extra titty. You're like. "I want some. I want some." You try to ease over there. Get a little lick of the titty that's open. "No. Don't do that!" "Shit. It's a free titty." "Don't do that! It's for the baby. I gotta switch the baby over." You're looking. Like. "Damn!" You try to make up excuses. "Shit. I got stronger jaws. I'm trying to help suck the milk up for the baby." "You've been drinking. haven't you? Don't do that. You'll get alcohol on the titty. You're gonna get the baby drunk. Don't do that." And the baby make the titty look good. Don't they? Babies show you what titty's all about. Babies. And they look at you and roll their eyes. They will fuckin' show you what a titty is all about. Man. Those are some of the things you go through. Man. In this here life. Round of applause. all the couples that are married. Well. Congratulations to all four of you. Now. I used to. I used to be married. I'm not married no more. We got a divorce. It just didn't work out. But it's hard. You know. When you. When you say. "I will marry you" or "Will you marry me?" that's like saying. "Oh. Shit!" That's why they line you up like fighters and shit. And guys be looking at each other. Going. "You know. When I finish announcing these vows. come out swingin' like a motherfucker. 'cause it's gonna be a barn burner." But all this shit happens at first. getting ready for the ceremony. And then you gotta fill out paperwork. like if you feel as though you have something. that you want to be exclusively yours. you gotta fill out IOU's. I'm sorry. I meant "prenuptials." That's some hard shit. To tell somebody that you love 'em. and then the prenuptial comes into play. but I guess it is what it is. But a person will do that. "You know. I love you. "We about to do this thing. Girl. Yeah. Yeah. We about to get married. I'm so proud of you. So glad we can make this happen. Yeah. You know. What excites me about this. is that. For the rest of our lives. we're gonna be together. And. You know. That can't be changed. You know. And your world. You know. is gonna be joined with my world. My world joined with your world. And that's a beautiful thing. We're gonna have one big world. That's right. That's right. That's right. I love you too. Yeah. I need you to fill out this paper that say. Yeah. I just need you to sign this here. It say if your world fuck up my world. Okay. you don't get shit out of my world. Okay? You just go the fuck on back to your world." That's a hard thing to do with them prenups and stuff. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the prenuptials? Okay. Wow! Y'all believe in that. Wow. Who don't believe in it? Overruled. Overruled! I see you say. "Uh-uh." You don't believe in that. That's cool. That's cool 'cause you believe that if it's love. let it be pure and just roll with that. and let the heart take over and see what happens. That's a beautiful thing. That's a beautiful thing. So let me ask you. This is hypothetically speaking here. Let's say we was getting married or some shit. Right? This is hypothetical. Okay? And coming into the marriage. going in. I got 400 million. let's say. And that's what I'm coming in with. and. you comin' in with a bag. You still think you should get some of that 400 mil? - Half and half. - Yeah. You be leaving. "Damn. That's fucked up. You could put something in this bag." I guess I can't answer that. I guess to each his own. Fellas. I don't know. I ain't no doctor. I ain't no psychologist. But I'm gonna tell you like this. If a woman tell you she a virgin and you gettin' ready to marry her. test that pussy out before you marry her. That's just the way it goes. Don't do it. Don't get into it. and then it ain't what you want. You never know. You gotta test that pussy out. 'Cause if you marry 'em and then get it. and wind up falling in the pussy. you'd be. "Oh. Shit!" You'd be in the land of Oz out that motherfucker. "Where the fuck am I? Is this fallopian? Is this fallopian?" So you gotta test it out. It's just like you test-drive a car or something. You take a car around the corner. bring it back to the dealer. "Naw. I ain't gonna be able to get this. Cuz. Yeah. Naw. Naw. Naw. Naw. Fuck that. Dude. The wheels. They don't rotate right on this motherfucker." Test it out. If you don't check before you get married. Fuck around. wind up marrying a hermaphrodite. That's right. You thought that was a big-ass clit. Turned out to be a dick. Now you fucked up. You're."Oh. Shit." Can't talk to your boys and shit. "What's up. Dog?" "I married somebody with a fuckin' dick I thought was a clit." You don't want to do that. Clit so big. it looked like a thumb. So check it out. Ain't nothin' wrong with that. Ladies. The same with you. Don't marry no man that you don't know what you gettin'. Yeah. You gotta marry that man. you gonna know what you gettin'. 'Cause if not. you marry him and don't know. you gonna be a bitter housewife on the phone with your girlfriend. Crying. "You ain't gonna believe this shit. Girl. Damn it. You ain't gonna believe this shit. Girl! This motherfucker can't do nothin'. Girl. The best thing about it was the ceremony. Girl. Ah. Shit! He noodle dick. Girl." You don't want to go through that. That's why what you do. you tell the man. You grab him. Iook at it. Look at the dick. Grab it in your hand. Look at it. You know what I mean? Hold it. Become the dick. And look at it. Look on the head. Look on the sides. Look up under the balls. Look at it and ask questions. "What's those two bumps right there? What's those two bumps on your helmet? Well. Have you tried putting Mercurochrome on that? No. You haven't. Huh? Okay. Why you got a boil up under your balls? That is a boil. Okay? That is not a hair bump. That is a boil. Uh-huh. Okay. Hold up. Wait. Fuck this. Hold on. Wait. Okay. Now you got a boil. two balls and two bumps? Uh-uh. I ain't gonna be able to do it. No. I ain't gonna be able to do it. I am not marrying no Nutty Buddy. I'm not gonna be able to do it. That is too many bumps on one dick. Uh-uh. Dick look like a Crunch Bar. I'm sorry. I just. I can't do it. I won't do it. I just won't." Talk and communicate. so you know these things. And so you check. You know what you're getting and you can be happy. Make him get butt naked. Tell your man. "Butt naked." Tell him to line up right. Look at him. Make sure the dick is in line right. Make sure it's straight. Make sure. Okay? If you don't do that. You'll wind up marrying a motherfucker. with a hook in his dick. Gotta fuck you like this. You don't want that. You don't need that pressure. You should not have to go around the corner every time he wants to fuck. "It's just better for my balance. I got you. You feel me now? You feel me now. Don't you? You feel me?" Chasing you around the room and shit. So please. Check all those things. And then when you're ready to get married. You get married. And you're ready for the ceremony. Ladies love them ceremonies. Don't you. Ladies? You love to invite people you love and people you hate. And look at them women that's looking at you going. "Look at me. Bitch. Look how I float. Bitch." And ladies love to wear that white. With the veil and wear that white. 'Cause white stands for pure. White. Pure. White. Come on! Some of y'all need to be wearing dark black. Tease 'em taupe. Sneaky salmon. Money green. All that shit. Talkin' about wearing white. knowing they done fucked the usher last week. Come on. Now. Wear your color. That's all I ask. Wear your color. Marriage. Man. It's hard. It ain't easy. I'll tell you. One thing I did come to learn. A lot of people that are married. you know. Either. Someone in the marriage either smokes herb or drinks. "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah." That's some true shit. Ain't it? I got some partners. "Yeah. Yeah. I got to go home to the wife. Yo. She get on my nerves every time I go in that motherfuckin' door. Yeah. Yeah. Roll me one of them blunts. Joe. Roll me one of them motherfuckers. Yeah. Make that a fat one. Man. When I smoke that shit. Man. That bitch look like Janet Jackson. Nigger." Or they drink. If you check all the bars. They're mostly married men. Just look at it. They're mostly married. and they in there dreading going home. They in the bar. "Oh. Shit. Make me another drink. Earl. Oh. God. I got to go home to the wife. Yeah. I don't know. Earl. You know what? Make it a double. She wants to fuck tonight. Oh. God. Well. Here's to her. Oh. God." They go in the house. "Honey. I'm home." They start drinking some more. The in-house drunk is a motherfuck. 'cause he says things when he gets drinkin'. and once that alcohol hits his system. that he probably is just out of order for sayin'. But he don't realize it 'cause he's so drunk. And now. that liquor taps into his emotions. and he starts tellin' this woman. everything he's been wantin' to say when he was sober. But he don't have the courage to say it when he's sober. and he says it when he's drunk. "Darlin'. Do me a favor. will you? Mm-hmm. Yes. Baby. It's so good. I'm glad I'm home. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think about you all day. Mm-hmm. I'm glad. Do me a favor. Never mind all that. Would you make me a drink. Darlin'? Yeah. Uh-huh. Just a little Courvoisier. Put a little something in that glass for me right there. Darlin'. Thank you so much. Baby. Yeah. That's good Courvoisier. Make you say yea. Darlin'. Put a couple of cubes of ice in there. Cut that warmth off for me. Thank you. Baby. Mm-hmm. That is a good drink there! That is a good drink there! That's my drink there. That is my drink. Can I ask you something? When the fuck you gonna grow your hair back? I'm tired. Yes. I said. Yes. Tired. Uh-huh. You're a bald-headed little motherfucker. You told me you was gettin' the. the Halle Berry look. Halle Berry don't look like that. I feel like you set me up. Motherfucker. I don't give a shit. Darlin'. Put one more cube of ice in there for me. Cut that warmth. Thank you. Doll. That was good. Can I ask you something? How is it you got more motherfuckin' shavin' bumps than me? How you got more? How is it you got more? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. Every week. You tellin' me. you gonna get your lip waxed. You might as well just let 'em take the whole lip. 'Cause that shit sitting out there like Sasquatch. Fuck that. Fuck that. If I wanted to marry Scottie from the Whisper Bitch. I would've married him. Motherfucker. Fuck that. Fuck that. I said it. Huh? That's because I feel bad about it. Girl. Okay? I said. 'Okay? ' Okay? You didn't talk to me about it. When you first gained five pounds. that was cute. I'm-a admit. I'm-a admit that. Okay? That was cute. But 75 pounds? Goddamn! What kind of fuckin' fool you take me for? My motherfuckin' ankles is still swollen. from the last time we toyed around. Look at you. Oh. God. Look at you. That is a good drink there. I remember when I met you. You was a 115 tender bone. Yes. You was. You was the finest thing my eyes ever seen. You was a round-the-way girl. Now you just a big bitch from up the street. Goddamn! Huh? Motherfucker! I don't give a damn. Don't give a damn. And I don't like your mother and your family. I don't like none of you motherfuckers. Every year. Every year we gotta do the family thing. Everybody brings potluck. Fuck that! None of you motherfuckers can cook. And your mother. Tell her to stay the fuck out of my face. Always in my face. 'How was my macaroni and cheese? ' It's fucked up. Bitch! Don't nobody put pasteurized cheese in macaroni and cheese. You got to use cheddar. Cheddar's what you use. My mama taught me that. I don't care! I'm looking at you. and I can't imagine it. There should be a clause in my contract that says. if your ass gets bigger than what you weighed in when we married. I don't have to fuck with you. Fuck it. Be a man. You was. When I first met you. Darlin'. I'm gonna say this. You were looking good from afar. Now you're just far from looking good. I don't like you. and you don't like me. Okay? I'm taking karate every day! I'm taking kung fu. I'm taking jujitsu. I'm taking all the martial arts. I'm trying to master that shit. so I can figure out how to choke the fucking life out your ass. without them tracing it back to forensics. you big bitch. You. You know what? Let me put this drink down before I say some shit I shouldn't say." Wow. But you know the ladies ain't gonna let you get away with that shit. You gonna pay the price for that. You know what I mean? 'Cause she will wake your ass up. cuss you out."Fuck you! Get your ass up!" You wake up and you don't even know why you're up or what happened. "What's the problem?" "You know what the problem is. You dirty bastard! I got big 'cause I don't want your ass. Motherfucker. You're so ugly. you look like we got a dog. That's what the neighbors think. you bastard." They get angry. They will take it in. And they will be quiet and let you talk shit and all that. but they getting you back. If you ever wake up sore. I mean. Really fucked up. Hurtin'. nine times out of ten you got your ass whupped in your sleep. And the only reason why you didn't wake up is 'cause you was out. That liquor had your ass out. They running through the motherfuckin' house. You wake up the next day. "My neck! My motherfucking neck! I don't know what's wrong with me! I don't know what's wrong. This morning. What's wrong with me?" She just gonna look at you. "Maybe you should stop drinking Courvoisier." Be careful. Man. That shit can happen. I don't know if you guys saw the film. It kind of highlighted my life. You know. Through it all. I come to learn what I got to do in my life. What we all gotta do in our life is ride this motherfucker till the wheels fall off. We gotta live. Ride it till the wheels fall off. You might have looked at the tape. It said one day I was. I was out in the street. This is some shit they said about. They had it highlighted. They said I was out in the street. and I was yelling stuff out in the street and doing stuff. Listen. Y'all. I was married at the time. Now. I'm not blaming that for that. Okay? But. Okay. At the time. I'm gonna tell you what happened. 'Cause that's how they put their story down. Okay? I'm gonna tell it. But that's how they do theirs. But. See. L. The day that all that went down. I'm gonna tell it. The day that all that went down. I was married. And the wife asked me to go to the store to get something to eat. And being the good husband that I am. I said. "Sure. I'll go." Now that I think about it. I don't know why I was out there. getting something to eat at McDonald's. when. As hard as I work. I should've had a home-cooked fuckin' meal. You know? But then again. I should've asked that question that day. So I go out in the street. and I go to run across the street. I was trying to catch the light. I go to run across the street and. because how the light changed. I got caught in the middle of the street. Next thing I know. they got firemen. They got ambulance. they got the police. Everybody out there with guns. all of'em had guns. just because I tried to run across the street. No. I'm fucking with you. I was higher than a motherfucker. Y'all. I was high as shit! Oh. My fuckin' goodness! Oh! I was smokin' that ooh-wee! That shit done had me all lunch-box. I should have known something was wrong. I start blazin' that shit. and I knew I started seeing blue smoke. but the shit didn't hit me till I'm walking in the street. Some shit said. "Run real fast right now." Fuckin' runnin' in the street! Fuckin' with the ooh-wee! I'm running like crazy. What kind of shit has the dope man sold me? I'm in that motherfucker just ducking cars. Fucking with the cars. jumping out the way. fucking with the cars and shit. Next thing you know. the motherfucking. police and firemen and the ambulance. "Mr. Lawrence. Son. What's wrong? Calm down!" And I'm up there looking at them. all crazy. They looking at me. I'm looking at them. I start singing. How come I feel like Somebody's watching me I start singing Rockwell up in that motherfucker. I said. "That dope man done sold me the ooh-wee." Oh. Shit. I seen all of them. And I thought my audience had changed. so I start performing for 'em. dancing and shit. Lunchin'. Lunchin'! Fuckin' with that ooh-wee. Man. My damn. My arm hit my jacket. and my jacket flew open. And they gonna say I had a gun 'cause my jacket. I did have a gun. That's true. I did. But I ain't have it to hurt nobody. I just have it 'cause I'm by myself. I didn't know if somebody would jump me. Bang-bang-bang-bang. Trigger tai chi. I didn't know. You know. But I wasn't trying to hurt nobody. Next thing you know. when they saw that gun. these motherfuckers loaded up. Every one of them. the firemen. ambulance. Everybody pulled out guns. Yes. Sir. And I heard somebody yell. "Nigger with gun! Nigger with gun!" They got ready to fire. I passed out like a motherfucker. Somebody done fucked around and sold me the ooh-wee. I passed the fuck out. Y'all. And I'm on the motherfuckin'. I wake up. I don't know. ten minutes. Fifteen. I wasn't countin' time. And they had me on a gurney. with cameramen and everybody in my fuckin' face. flashing pictures for y'all to see on the news. Then they put me in a. in a paddy wagon. slash-ambulance. They want to show that they cared. but I'm lunchin'. So they're gonna take me to jail or some shit. So they're ready to take me to jail. but I'm in there talking shit. singing on the bed. Or the gurney. laying there singing shit. That just didn't sound right."We're gonna have to take you to the precinct." And I'm lunchin' and shit. and I say. "Monkeys like to play volleyball." I'm laying there. "Pit bulls like to wear Jordans." That's when they realized I was sicker than they thought. They said. "He's got something in his system that got him sick-witted. Fuck taking him to jail. Let's take him to the hospital." Them motherfuckers rushed me to the hospital. put me in a padded room with just a big-ass mirror. where you could kind of see through. You knew they was on the other side. And I didn't help. 'cause I'm still in there lunchin' and shit. Working on moves and shit. Two to the right. One to the left. Think about it. Lunchin'. Fuckin' lunchin'. Then a doctor came in. Y'all. He was a fan of the show. And he really wanted to see me get out of there. He said. "Listen. Son. I'm a doctor. I'm not here to hurt you." I'm moving. Can't stay still. and he's a little nervous. He said. "I don't know what happened. but you almost got yourself killed. You were carrying a firearm. and I don't know what you were thinking. But listen. We ran tests. We checked your blood. Son. And we can't find anything in your blood." For a second I was sober. "What the dope man done sold me?" You know. When they can't find it in your blood? So he said. "I wanna help you get the fuck home. I wanna get you out of here and back to your family. But you're gonna have to help me to help you. That's what you can do. I need to know what you were smoking. and who sold it to you." I sobered up for about 30 seconds. "I can't tell you that. Doc. That's a street code. We never tell. What the fuck you talking about?" That's what I told him. "You trying to get me fucked up by the dope man?" Then it was time for me to go. 'cause I was together. The ooh-wee had got out of my system. I couldn't believe I was out on the street lunchin'. I had the hottest show on. I couldn't believe these things was happening. Marriage was on the brink. All kind of shit after that. But before I left the hospital. I got your love. And I felt your love and support for me. You know? And it was a beautiful thing. and I thank each and every one of you. That meant a lot to me. It truly meant a lot to me. so I'm forever grateful. And I tell you. celebrities came up to see me when I was in the hospital. It was kinda wild. They came to see me. Magic Johnson came to see me when I was in the hospital. When I was going through one of my hardest times. He came and said. "Martin. What are you doin'. Boy? What are you doing out on the street. doing that crazy stuff like that. Man? You gotta take care of yourself. You got a hot show. Don't blow it. Man. You got to be like 'Show time!"' That was a beautiful thing for Magic to give me that advice. So since I had him there. I took the opportunity to ask him. to get me on the Lakers. And he said. "Sure. Mar. I'll see what I can do. Mar." I know he went home and told Cookie. "Yeah. That motherfucker in bad shape. He wanted to take Derek Fisher's job. I don't know what the fuck he's thinking." So finally I got out of the hospital. That was one thing I went through. I couldn't believe it. Fucked up. I said. "Now I got the embarrassment hanging over me." I never really wanted to go down that way. But I had to move on. So. I'm trying to get it together. Couldn't really go home. 'cause it wasn't really going so well at home. So I did what we all do when we're trying to get our life together. I went to a club. I'm out that motherfucker. Man. I'm at the club dancing. Minding my business. Doing the ladies dance. I'm a little off. Though. I ain't on the right dances yet. I'm still on some old shit. And some. You know. I don't know what this motherfucker was. He bumped into me. And I said. "Watch yourself. Partner." Then he go and push me. I punched that boy in his mouth. We rumblin' in there. Then everybody clears out. I'm rumblin'. Everybody clears out. Even he cleared out. I said. "Damn. I know I can rumble. but hot damn! Shouldn't have started it if you wasn't gonna finish." So he runs out. And then all these damn cops come in. about 30 fucking cops with shotguns and shit. all for little-ass Martin. Thirty cops. You'd have thought I was bin Laden. They came in that motherfucker. "Mr. Lawrence!" I fainted again. How come I feel like somebody's watching me? Next thing you know. They put me in jail. This time I didn't get off easy. They said. "Fuck it. On Ventura we didn't take you to jail. but now we're taking your ass to jail." When I woke up. they had me ready to go. I knew I was getting ready to go fuck around with them hardheads up in there. I wasn't trying to get them to come at me right here. so I jumped down and did some pushups. I said. "Wait. Officer. let me do a few of these." And I got real "deezed" on 'em. My arms was hawked up a little bit. so I could go up in that motherfucker and bang with these niggers. "What? What. Nigger. What?" So they take me to the precinct and throw me in the cell by myself. So I'm sittin' in that motherfucker with the arms all swolled. chest all "deezed." Nobody to rumble out that motherfucker. They said. "The best way to get back at Martin. let him stay by hisself." The next thing you know. An hour go by. my "deez" drops a little bit. Another hour go by. and they drop a little more. About four hours go by. I'm holding my arms. Going. "Oh. Bitch. I'm sorry! He hit me first! I'm not an animal! I'm not an animal." Finally they let me up out the motherfucker. I'm getting ready to get outta there. thinking I'm going home and shit. and they hand me a paper to go to court. I go to court. The judge I had was this. You know. he was a cool. Young white dude. Didn't take no shit. But straight to the point. Tell you how it is. He said. "Martin. What the fuck are you doing in my courtroom? I wanna know why the fuck are you in my courtroom. I don't understand that. Whoa. Whoa. You mean I go to have my bagel and coffee this morning. I look at the paperwork. And your fucking name is on my fucking desk? What are you thinking? You know what you're doing? You're making an ass out of yourself and you're blowing it. Kid. You're blowing it. You're in a position to do what a lot of people would love to do. and you're throwing it away. You're becoming a menace to society. and it doesn't even make sense. Why don't you use all this exposure and shit to do something positive. Martin? 'Cause you're in my courtroom. I will lock your fucking ass up. I don't give a shit. I will lock you up. Yes. I'm down with the brothers and the homies. I will lock your ass up. Okay? I put someone away about a year ago. His name was Tank. He thought he was bad. Now his name is Tina. And Tina's wearing little tankies. Martin. You need to get your shit together or leave it alone. I'll lock your ass up. Okay? Ask Gary Coleman." I said. "Oh. Shit! You're right. I'll get it together. You're right. I'll get it together." And he said. "Not without probation." And I said. "Never again. Never again." I said. "Martin." I asked myself. I said. "How did you go through all that? How. That's stupid. What you have gotten to do in your lifetime. a lot of people would love to do. Fortunately. God has blessed you with a gift to make people laugh. and to do some very special things in life. And you come that far to throw it away?" Then it hit me. I said. "Nah." I didn't want to keep jumping on myself and keep feeling down about myself. I said. "Nah." But then it hit me. You know what? I said. "I'm only human." If I'm crucified for being a human. then so be it. Because no one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life. No one. No matter what you do. you are not immune. to the trials and tribulations of life. As I got out. and tried to get myself together. I stopped fuckin' with the ooh-wee 'cause it wasn't for me. That's a start. So I got it together. I kept movin'. I said. "Let me get my life together." and as I'm getting my life together. I'm dealing with the motherfuckers writing bullshit about me. saying negative things about me. All these devils that just wanna take God's child out. Here goes all these rumors. Here goes all these rumors writin' about me. I see on the paper. one of'em says. "Martin tries to jump out of a plane. using his jacket as a parachute." As I'm trying to get my life together. they're gonna write that bullshit. I know damn well you can't jump out no plane. using your jacket as a parachute. Shit. I know you got to use your pants. They don't think I know this shit. So I said. "Fuck that." Then I was trying to get my dating scene on. Find a lady in my life. Then I was trying to get my dating scene on. Find a lady in my life. 'Cause I wasn't married no more. so I'm running around. You know. "What's up. Miss lady? How you doin'?" And they was believing that shit. I'd say. "Hello." They'd say. "Ah. You crazy. Ain't you?" Girl. Don't fuck with him. He crazy. That motherfucker probably got a Glock on him. Don't fuck with him." I couldn't believe it. So then I said. "Fuck the rumors. Fuck what they say. Fuck what they write. 'cause I'm gonna be all right." And that's what I did. I went running. I went jogging. I went running. I was trying to get my mind together. I'm out there. I'm running. and I'm jogging. and I'm thinking. "Somewhere there's got to be a love for me." I'm doing my jogging. listening to the headphones. but I happen to go jogging. on the fuckin' hottest day. of the fuckin' summer! And a nigger pass out! Damn! I passed the fuck out. Lyin' in shit on the lawn. Can't believe that. As if I didn't have enough shit going on in my life. Now I'm back on the motherfucking scene passed out by shit on a lawn. Neighbors walking by. seeing me laying there. My white neighbors didn't wanna bother me. "Isn't that Martin laying on his lawn? Why doesn't he go in the house?" "I don't know. But that's that nigger's house. Let him lay there." But my lady found me. She called the ambulance. And I'm forever grateful to her. My family. All of them. They was instrumental in being a part of saving my life. But they didn't think I was here. Y'all. 'cause I was laying on the ground. and that sun was frying my head. in a skull cap. in a fuckin' wool-ass hat. It was fryin' my shit. So they think. "Oh. Man!" They checked my pulse. They couldn't find no pulse. My temperature was 10 7. So the ambulance drivers leaned over. couldn't feel the pulse. They said. "Fuck it. This nigger gone. You wanna stop at the liquor store?" "Yeah. Pick up some Courvoisier. Fuck that." But they get me to the hospital on time. I'm thankful to all of them. the doctors and nurses. The ambulance. But one thing they gonna do. I'm 10 7. They needed to put me on ice. They put me on nothing but ice. They put ice all over my body. Butt naked. Damn it! Now. I don't mind that. I'm hot? Cool me off. But I was butt-naked. And I didn't have the weight in my meat I usually have. So I'm out there like this on ice. And they around me taking pictures and shit. laughing at me! I'm gonna fight that in court. I'm gonna deal with that. 'Cause somebody could've put an ice cube under my balls. and swolled it up a little or something. Come on. Now. I'm a black man. Y'all. But they didn't do that. My family was there. The doctors tried to tell them to go home. They said. You know. And I love them and thank them so much for never giving up on me. because. Had they gone home. I probably wouldn't even be here. You know. My brother. Yeah. Thank you. I applaud 'em. All of'em. My whole family. I love 'em. Yeah. It was rough. My brother scared the doctor. 'cause he didn't wanna hear that. He's military. "What the fuck you talking about? What? Nigger. I'm gonna walk down the street. When I get back. Keep talking that shit you talking. Doc. Better pull out a stethoscope. motherfucker. Or something." That's when they started working on me. Them doctors did all they could. And I thank them for that. But as much as I thanked them. I gave God the glory. for bringing me back. I give him the glory. No question. I thank him. You know. for putting his children out there around me to help me. So I woke up three days later. Being out for three days was some of the best sleep I ever got. I woke up. Everybody was happy to see me."We love you! We love you!" "Ain't nothin' wrong with my hearing." I had a tube in my mouth. I had a catheter in my dick. I thought my dick had grew. Shit. It was a damn catheter. I didn't know how they got that catheter in there. They couldn't have got that shit in there if I was woke. I'll tell you that. So I had to learn to talk again. I had to learn to walk again. I had to learn to do all these things we generally take for granted. It come not so easy. I had to learn to do that shit again. My show was running on the air. I got movies out. but I can't go to premieres and shit because I can't walk. Can't do all this shit. So I said. "Fuck it. I gotta work hard to get better." So they put me in a room and gave me a bell. They said. "If you need help. Hit this bell and we'll come in and help you. The nurse will come help you." This catheter was attached to a tank that had. It's where your piss goes. One day I tried to get up and forgot I couldn't walk. and the whole piss tank fell. I ring the bell. "I dropped my piss!" So the nurse came in. and the nurse was fine. She was so fine. you'd go. "Goddamn!" She cleaned up the piss. This fine. Professional woman started cleaning up the piss. She talked to me and said. "Don't be embarrassed. This is gonna happen. But if you think you have to go to the bathroom or want to try to get up. ring your bell and I'll help you. But don't try to get up. all right?" I said. "Thank you." But I forgot. Tried it. Piss everywhere. "I dropped my piss." "Mr. Lawrence. Don't try to get up. Just ring your bell. That's what I'm here for." Then one day I was looking at something on TV. And I laughed. And I shitted on myself. It was that borderline. It was just really all soft shit. because I only had liquids in me. It just smeared all around my fuckin' thigh. and it was stinkin' like a motherfucker. I was gonna ring the bell. And I said. "I can't call that fine motherfucker. I can't tell that fine motherfucker that I done shitted on myself. I can't tell her. I know she got a fine friend. that know a fine friend. All the fine ones gonna know I shitted." I couldn't do it. I'm holding my nose. I couldn't take it no more. It was cuttin' through my passages. "I shitted on myself." And this fine woman. came in. and cleaned up the shit. She was so patient with me. "Mr. Lawrence. I know you're a little embarrassed. But these things happen. Now. I told you. Your bowels. your muscles are not strong. So don't worry about it. There's no need to be embarrassed. These things happen. This is the hospital. Don't worry about it." And then she started cleaning me. And she cleaned. And she wiped. I looked at her. This woman was cleaning doo-doo. off me. And I said. I started falling in love. Now. Man. that was a beautiful thing for them to do. for her to do. After that. I shitted maybe seven more times. I would say. Went from hard shit to doodle balls. all kinds of shit. Shit with corn in it. And she cleaned it up. About the tenth doo-doo. she was madder than a motherfucker. All that professional went out the window. "All right. Mr. Lawrence! Now. This shit don't make no sense! You too grown for this shit! You been in this hospital all this time. And you ain't worked your fuckin' muscles yet? Shittin' all over the place. That's just not cute. And you gonna act like you wanna get with me. I don't want no shitty man. Talkin' about 'Martin! Martin! ' Should be Shitty Martin." Scared me so bad. I just stopped shittin' for a while. Didn't do nothin'. I think she quit after that. They said she was gone. Couldn't find her nowhere. Said she couldn't take the shit off Martin no more. She was tired of it. I think I shitted one more time. and I just sat in that. "I will not tell nobody." And the whole room was funky. It was so stinky. "Fuck it. My pride won't let me tell nobody. 'Cause I don't want them to get angry with me no more." I tied a pillowcase around my head and around my nose. and cut out the eyes. I was in there looking like a shitty superhero. And then they motherfuckin' came in the room and shit. You know. They could smell. 'cause it was messing up the hospital. They thought they was gonna have to quarantine the hospital. They found it was me sittin' in shit. and I started blaming people. I was in denial. "There's a serial shitter going around. He broke in and put the drawers on me. He went that-a-way." But one thing I can say. honestly. Truly from the heart that I learned. from. You know. Ventura. the gun. Assault. Whatever. fights and coma and all that. One thing I truly learned. is that we fall down. but we get up. Thank you. Will all the people who like sex. All the people who like safe sex. Sex is good. I love sex. That's a good thing. Isn't it? I love sex. I love everything about it. Just not all the crazy stuff. Ladies. I love that oral sex. I love when you do me. I really do. I really do. You gotta soak. You know. If I'm gonna do that. you gotta clean it well. Because. Guys. If you ever caught a bad one. That shit will scar you. for the rest of your fucking life. You ever go down and it smell like. you will be fucked up. Shit smell like. "Oh. No." So if you clean it right. we don't have to go through that. 'Cause. Ladies. You don't like a man with a stinky dick. Am I correct? You would let a man know in a minute. "Your balls stink. Your balls stink!" I got a woman right now suing me. No. Not 'cause of stinky dick. She gonna say I gave her high blood pressure. 'cause I had salt on my balls. I said. "I thought you liked your meat seasoned. Baby. What's the problem?" But sex is good. Sex is good. Do it when you get the chance to do it. Have fun. Make love. Let it blossom. but do it right. That weird sex shit? Who is out here doing that weird sex shit? Who's doing that? Stop that shit. You know who you are. Pissing on people? That is not lovemaking. Stop getting that. "You like that? Let me drink two more cups of water. and I got a little more for you." Cut it out! Cut out doing that weird sex shit. And whoever is doing that S&M. Stop it. Listen. If you wanna do a little something. You just gotta be gentle. Is it called S&M. S&M? I don't do it. so I don't know. Listen. Ain't nothin' wrong with a little pop on the ass. I'm a pop-on-the-ass man. I know how to do it though. I been trained for that and everything. They show you how you're supposed to do that. One leg here. the other leg here. When you pop. you come up off it like that. See? That means you're not actually trying to hurt 'em. You're just trying to make them feel that sting. But when you pop and plow 'em into the fucking wall. then it's starting to get brutal. You don't want that. That's brutal sex. You don't wanna pull your dick out. and then drop your foot on the back of their neck. You don't wanna take hot curlers and burn their stomach. Talkin' about. "You love me? You love me?" That's just not what you wanna do. I seen some white boy tell his lady. "Kick me in my balls real hard. Right now." "Fuck. Yeah! Yeah!" I seen a lady have her nipples clamped to the door. and have somebody slam the door. "Oh. Yeah! Yeah! Now take 'em off the hinges and throw the doors. Yeah! Yeah!" So please. be gentle with that. And who is puttin' gerbils in their ass? Stop it! Them gerbils ain't done nothin' to nobody. Them little rodents ride that wheel. you snatch 'em. Put 'em in your ass. Stop that. I hope they scratch your ass out. Hope you wind up in a hospital sounding like a Chinese movie. "Doctor! Doctor! The rodent's up in my ass!" Scratch his ass out. Little rodent. Scratch his ass out. You know the doctor gonna tell you. "I can get him out. But first you're gonna have to fill out some paperwork." "Hurry up. Doctor! Hurry up. Doctor!" So please. be cautious with your sex. be gentle with your sex. Be gentle with your lovemaking. Love one another. Another thing. Fellas. Have you ever. been doing it so good. so wonderful. The mood is right. The lights are dim. It's probably dark. but not quite dark. 'cause your bodies. They silhouette. You can see each other. The music is going. It seems to be going with your emotion and your flow. Everything's working that night. "Ooh. Girl. Why you do this to me. Girl? Oh. That is so nice. It's so moist. So wet. Wow. It's so hot." And you're going. "My goodness. Girl. You just so wet. What. You gettin' extra wet for me tonight? Extra. Extra. Extra?" All over you. You can feel it all over your thighs. Everywhere. Then you get up and you cut on the lights. Blood every-fucking-where. It looks like a fucking massacre. You look at your dick like it's a knife. "Why? Why?" You look at the bed. It looks like a crime scene. "Why? Why. Why. Why?" You look at her. "Why didn't you tell me?" Ladies got the perfect answer. "You must have brought it down!" God bless. Ride this motherfucker till the wheels fall off. ♪♪ [Surf Rock] ♪♪ [Vocalizing] ♪♪ [Fades] [Man Narrating] Summer means many different things to different people. To some, it might mean the thrill of a high-speed catamaran. Others like to float around and soak up a few stray rays. Still others like some kind of inland activity. But for us, it's the sport of surfing! The thrill and the fun of the sport of surfing. Some people like to bodysurf. Others like to ride a short belly board and get a short ride. Still others like a short bellyboard and a long ride, like George Greenough at Santa Barbara, California. Most surfers like to ride a regular board. and perform on medium-sized waves. Most would like to perform as well as Australian Nat Young here. Or as well as American surfer Butch Van Artsdalen. Some surfers prefer the hairy thrill of a big wave. You can go right or left, but you can't very well do both at once. If you do, at least it's something commonly known in the surfing world. as a wipeout. The only way to avoid a wipeout is to take this wide "stink bug" stance. Spread your legs and hang on till your trunks rip right up the back. No place represents summertime to more people than the Hawaiian Islands. To surfers, summer in Hawaii means the reefs near waikiki that break so well-- places like this spot, about a third of a mile out over the reef. It's called Number Three. Right next to Number Two. One of the outstanding surfers from Hawaii-- Mr. Paul Strou. There are many places on the reef that break during the summer. About 300 yards from Number Three is another spot called Kaisers. Friendly surfers in Hawaii. "Hi there, Charlie." Conditions are ideal. water temperature averaging 75 degrees. The air temperature-- 75 degrees. One of the most popular summer breaks is just off to one side. of the Ala wai Yacht Harbor entrance, a spot called Ala Moana. On a weekend, you see surfboards, boats, every imaginable thing using the harbor entrance. In fact, the new sport over there is "trolling for surfers." If you can sort yourself out from the boats, you can get a great ride, like Gene Harris is doing here at Ala Moana. Another outstanding surfer from Hawaii-- Fred Hemmings. Fred only stands up on alternate Wednesdays, but when he does, he really wails. Just across the entrance channel from Ala Moana is another surfing spot, called Garbage Hole. They built a breakwater that cut the surf off, but in its day. this spot produced some fantastic rides for surfers like Wayne Miyata. The ultimate thing to do in surfing is to be actually covered up by the wave. And here goes Wayne doing the ultimate thing. This is summertime in Hawaii. California has a lot of places that represent summer to a lot of people, no place more than this "secret spot"-- Malibu Beach, California, famous for its Malibu Outriggers, surfing and girls. This a girl, and for those of you who are maladjusted, this is a Malibu Outrigger. A lot of good surfers ride in Malibu. One of the best is Lance Carson. Say hello to the folks, Lance. At-a-baby. when Lance goes out at Malibu, he really gives the place a going-over. He stays in just the perfect spot on the wave, which is right in front of the white water. in the breaking part of the wave called the curl. The main object in surfing is to always remain in the curl. Stay as close as possible to the white water without actually getting caught by it. All the maneuvers in surfing-- turning, stalling, trimming, riding the nose-- are directed toward the ultimate aim of staying in the curl. Lance's real speciality is noseriding. A lot of surfers run up to the nose. A lot run up and right off the end. Lance usually stays around for a while. He's so relaxed up there, you get the feeling. he could have a ham sandwich while he's waiting around. A surfer who can ride Malibu better than anyone in the world is Miki Dora. As Phil Edwards says of Miki, "His style is so advanced, most surfers don't even understand what he's trying to do." He's very good at winding his way through the crowds at Malibu. without losing any of his composure. On a small wave inside, Miki with one of his unique maneuvers, side-slipping his board back and forth in the wave. He's the only surfer I've ever seen do this. Mr. Miki Dora. A young fella named Corky Carroll gets great rides. wherever he happens to be surfing. Corky also comes up with some pretty strange things. Here's a pretty strange pullout. An "El Rollo." when Corky does something strange, everyone for 50 yards knows all about it. "Hey, did you guys see that El Rollo? Boy, it was a beauty!" Yeah, big deal, Corky. During the wintertime in California, the conditions really change. The water temperature drops down to 48 degrees sometimes. at places like Steamer Lane in Santa Cruz. Steamer Lane, home of the world's latest takeoff. The only person comfortable surfing in this cold water is Henry. Henry is a seal, nature's greatest bodysurfer. Other places in California get big during the wintertime, like the Redondo Beach Breakwater. Although California isn't known for its big surf, you can see. occasionally it gets big, and biggest during the wintertime. Many surfers ride summer and winter, but the ultimate thing for most of us would be to have an endless summer. The warm water and waves, without the summer crowds of California. The only way to do this is by traveling around the world, following the summer season as it moves around the world. Two surfers, Robert August and Mike Hynson, have been planning a trip like this for some time. The winter evening before their departure, in front of a warm fire, reading up on a few last-minute books on Africa, which would be their first stop. Robert August. Mike Hynson. Packing for the journey was important. Six pairs of trunks, two boxes of wax, some modern sounds and, in case of injury, one band-aid. It was a cold, foggy winter morning in November. when Mike and Robert were ready to depart. on the first leg of their endless summer journey around the world. On the plane heading for Africa, Robert wondered what was in store for them. would the find surf? would they catch malaria? would they be speared by a native? He didn't have any idea. Across the U.S., then across the Atlantic Ocean, landing in Africa for the first time. at Dakar, Senegal. They didn't know what to expect in Dakar, and at dawn at the airport, they were anxious to get under way. and find an inexpensive place to stay. They were a bit perturbed when a government official informed them. they didn't have any choice-- they had to stay. at a certain government-owned hotel or leave the country. So they had their introduction to primitive Africa. at one of the primitive little hotels along the seashore. The rates here were unbelievable-- $30 a day each. As you walk through the front door, they stamp "sucker" on your forehead. The joke turned out to be on the government, however, because right out in front of this hotel was a little island. about a quarter of a mile offshore. And off each end of this island was surf breaking, surf that no one had ever ridden before. and, as far as we know, no surfer had ever even seen before. It's pretty scary paddling out for the first time. at a strange spot like this. They had no idea what they might find in the water. So they stuck pretty close together. For moral support, they took off together on the first wave, figuring if anything happened to them, it would happen equally. and probably wouldn't hurt so badly that way. Takes a while to get used to any new surfing spot, but here in Africa, surfing for the first time, it takes a little longer. Mike, on the left of the screen, pointing out a rock just underwater to Robert. You find out where the rocks are, how the waves are breaking over the rocks or reef. Find out if there's any funny little fish who might be mad-- things like that. what we call "getting a place wired." After you get it wired, it's just like. riding waves back in the U.S.A., except you aren't. You're in Africa. They couldn't get over being in Africa. Mike would pull out of a wave, paddle over to Robert and say, "Robert, guess what? we're in Africa!" I don't know what it was, but it was really hard to accept. They practiced the buddy system. If one lost his board, the other would paddle over and pick up the board-- or body. whichever was closest. You don't want to do a lot of swimming in the water down here. Here they were, only four hours off an airplane from the United States, and already into better surf than they'd left behind them the day they left California. They're still in the Northern Hemisphere, and although it's officially wintertime, the water temperature was 70 degrees. They rode these waves knowing they were the first to ever do it, and also knowing the closest surfer to them was over 4,000 miles away. This place broke a long way out, so most people didn't notice what was going on. A few of the native kids spotted the activity and came to watch. Being good Africans, they threw a few rocks. Some of the sharp-eyed fishermen on the beach paddled out. to get a closer look in their full race canoes. One of the fishermen was really stoked. He was trying to shoot the shore break in his canoe. Your surfing style in strange waters like this would normally be very conservative. You could hardly call Mike's or Robert's style conservative. Mike with a great ride-- Dakar, Senegal, west Africa-- completely covered up. They figured at the rates they were being charged at the hotel, each wave was costing them about 9.95. Mike hit the bottom and picked up a little ding on his head. It was so expensive in Senegal, they decided to leave. A cup of coffee costs the equivalent of one American dollar in Senegalese francs. Their next stop would be Accra, Ghana, about 2,000 miles down Africa's Gold Coast. Landing in a strange country like this was pretty weird. The people of course knew nothing about surfing and had never seen a surfboard. They thought the boards were some kind of airplane wing. Commonplace things for us like getting a ride with your surfboard were major projects. They finally commandeered this taxicab and are trying to explain to the driver. that they want to tie the boards on the roof. They even brought rope to do it with. The driver didn't speak English and didn't understand. Mike kept saying, "Look, they'll fall out of the trunk. Let's put them on the roof." The driver kept muttering something that must have meant, "Airplane wings go in the trunk." None of this was staged. The discussion went on for half an hour, and the driver finally did it the way he thought was best. Can you imagine driving down the highway in the U.S. like that? They'd put you in prison. They made it to a little hotel without the boards falling out, congratulating the driver for being such a good packer. He really liked Mike and Robert. Didn't even charge them for the ride, and offered to spend a couple of days with them. showing them around his country of Ghana. No charge. All they had to do was buy gasoline for his cab. when they stopped to buy gasoline for his cab, it turned out to be not a very good deal. Gasoline in Ghana is very expensive-- five-point-four-and-a-half shillings per gallon, almost one American dollar for a gallon of gas. It was, as the name of it implied, really "Agip." In a few minutes in West Africa, you can be out of a city into a very primitive area. That's where they are now, at a primitive fishing village in Ghana. Most of these people had never seen a white man before. As they walked down the beach, they really wondered if they were doing the right thing. They didn't know whether the U.N. had been there yet or not. They were a little nervous on the beach, so they paddled right out in the water. Paddling out, they had the horrible thought that maybe surfing. would violate some religious taboo of the natives, and they'd attack. During the first ride, the hundreds of natives were dead silent, but went Robert pulled out, they really went wild. [Shouting, Cheering] That was the beginning of surfing in Ghana. The people couldn't believe it. They came down to the beach with their kids and their lunch. and they still had both hands free. The natives had never seen or even dreamed of anything like this before. They stood there for hours, completely fascinated. If you lost your board, it would come inside, and the native kids would hop on it and play with it till you come and ask for it back. Usually they'd give it back, but they were kids, and you were bigger than they were. But you weren't bigger than the chief, who was bigger than anybody. That's why he was chief. If you lost your board and the chief wanted to play with it, there really wasn't much you could say about it. watch Robert trying to be tactful here. "Hi there, chief. Nice day, huh, sir? May I have my board back, please?" One reason the natives were so excited about surfing. was because they themselves paddle out through the surf every day. in their big dug-out canoes to go fishing. So they have a real feeling for the sea and waves, and could fully appreciate Mike and Robert's ability on their surfboards. This is really an interesting tribe of native fishermen. Their method of fishing has remained unchanged for thousands of years. Everything they have, they make themselves. The ropes and nets are woven from some fiber they get in the jungle. The canoe is hollowed out of a single, gigantic hardwood log. when they go stroking out to sea in their big dug-out canoe, and you're sitting outside, looking at them paddling toward you, you think they're coming out with their forks to have you for dinner. ♪♪ [Singing In Native Language] They couldn't speak English, and Mike couldn't speak their language. They paddled by and said something like-- [Imitates Native Language] Mike smiled and said, "Yeah, man, hang 10." They thought that was great. They went stroking out, chanting, "Hang 10, hang 10!" The only English word they know is "hang 10." That has to be unique. They lay the net in a big semicircle. Normally they avoid riding waves in the canoes, but they thought they'd give Mike and Robert a little thrill. They did when they took off on a wave in their two-ton hardwood canoe. ♪♪ [Continues] Surfing one of these things is like trying to surf the Santa Fe Super Chief. They fish the same stretch of beach every day, and have been for hundreds of years. If they move a mile up or down the beach, they run into another tribe of fishermen who have that area all staked out. And if they infringe on each other's area, a big war starts and everybody gets massacred. It's really a mess. So they stay pretty much in their own area. with the last of the canoes coming in, everyone in the village. turns out to help pull in the big net. ♪♪ [Singing In Native Language] They all have duties. Here's the head rope coiler. ♪♪ [Continues] It takes them about an hour to get the net in, and they usually catch quite a few fish. They have to divide the catch up among themselves. They don't have any money, but they bargain for the fish anyway. The session goes on for half an hour, with everyone hollering at each other at full volume. Their approach is like, "Look, Casafugo, I pulled harder, so I get more fish." And the other guy says, "Yeah, but I stayed up late last night worrying about it." The other guy says, "well, I'm bigger than you. I'm taking the fish." Part of it has to do with how big and strong you are and what you know. This woman must have known karate. The surfboards really attracted a lot of attention, as did Mike and Robert. Robert with a big group surrounding him. They were asking him questions in their native tongue, and he was answering what he thought might be the questions in English. No one understood one word of what the other guy was saying. But when you get surrounded by a group like that, you just don't just walk away. The kids in the village really got excited about surfing. They got so excited, they started ripping down their houses. ♪♪ [Continues] The start of bellyboard surfing in Ghana. ♪♪ [Fades] The kids wanted to learn how to ride a real surfboard, so Mike and Robert organized a little surfing school. First thing the kids had to learn was to rough up the wax on the deck of the board. with some sand so they wouldn't slip off. Plenty of help. The biggest problem in the school was selecting one student. They all wanted to be the student, and you can only teach one at a time, so you just looked around and tried to find a kid with a pair of trunks. Teach him first. Robert starting his student off near shore, pushing him into a wave. First time this little African boy had ever been on a surfboard in his life. Mike didn't fool around near shore. He started his students outside in the heavies. If they let go of the board, they'd lose their turn as students, so they'd hang on to the thing sideways in the soup. They weren't afraid of anything. The best one of the day was a beautiful tandem late takeoff, sideways. As is usual in West Africa, when the little guys try something and survive, the big guys take the boards away and go out and try it themselves. A couple of the heavies got the boards and started stroking out. Keep in mind these men had never seen a surfboard, let alone ever tried to ride one. It takes most beginners a long time to just catch a wave. In my years of surfing, I've never seen anything like this. The very first wave he tried. - His buddies were really stoked. - [Cheering] They started getting kinda cocky after a while-- one-armed paddles. These fellas were amazing. They didn't have much trouble catching waves. They didn't even have too much trouble standing up for a short time. They had absolutely no trouble at all. getting the board back from the people inside. Mike and Robert would have to argue, but watch when the heavy comes in to get the board. No argument. They started getting it really wired. Some pretty hot angles going, and a beautiful El Rollo. They even came up with a few original maneuvers. A west African pullout here called a "reverse Patrice Lumumba." These men were so excited about surfing that we felt sure after we left. they'd shape their own surfboard from some jungle tree. and are probably out there surfing right now. The only problem came when the local constable walked up, said, "Sorry. No surfing after 11:00." He didn't look too friendly, so we didn't argue. The kids didn't like that rule. They gave him a little lip, like, "How'd you like a black eye, cop?" Their time just about up in Ghana, they strolled down the beach and said good-bye to the newfound friends. Our next stop-- Lagos, Nigeria, just a short hop down the coast. On these short flights, we took some pretty weird airlines. This one was South Mombasa, with a U.N.-trained African pilot. flying a war surplus DC-1. Figured he'd give 'em a little thrill. [Engines Roaring] Once into Nigeria, Mike and Robert hitched a ride. and struck off to look for surf in a place no one had ever surfed before. The odds against finding surf in a strange country are pretty high. Even getting to a beach is difficult. with their fantastic luck still with them, they hiked into a beach and paddled right out into some hot little waves. when I say "hot" in this case, I don't refer to the shape of the waves, but to the actual temperature of the waves. The water temperature here in Nigeria, almost on the equator, was an unbelievable 91 degrees. It melted the wax right off the board. The air temperature was about 100. The humidity felt like 5,000%. It felt drier underwater than it did up there in the air. United Nations ship outside, ready to enter the harbor at Lagos, Nigeria. we have no way of knowing whether this is a good day of surf for Nigeria, or a bad one. All we know-- it was like this when we were there, and it's still better than a lot of days we get in California. Unlike Ghana, only one native watched. He wasn't exactly overactive. Neither would you be when it's 100 degrees. It was so hot on the beach, I decided to wade out in the water. and show you what it looks like if you're standing chest-deep in Nigerian water. watching Mike Hynson ride by, perched on the nose. You keep one eye on Mike, and the other eye on the bottom. for creatures like stonefish that exist there. If you step on a stonefish, you die in about 15 minutes. Surfing a place like this is no problem. The problem is finding it to begin with, and in this case, the problem was getting back to the road to hitch a ride. They had to hike through a jungle between the beach and a road. If you get off the path, you never find your way out. This was a full-on jungle, full of all kinds of creepy things-- snakes, spiders. They expected Tarzan to come swinging by on a vine. [Airplane Engines whirring] From Nigeria, they're headed to South Africa. They'll be crossing the equator for the first time. For the first time, it's now officially summer. It was November. Landing in Cape Town, they'll also be going to Durban, 1,200 miles up the coast. The landmark at Cape Town that's as famous as Diamond Head. is Table Mountain. Let's go up on top and take a look. From the top, you can see a long way down the Cape Peninsula. It's a finger of land about 20 miles long and five miles wide. It separates two great oceans. On one side of the peninsula is the Atlantic Ocean. On the other, the Indian Ocean, ending in the famous Cape of Good Hope. It's a 2,000-foot vertical drop from Table Mountain. to the suburbs of Cape Town below. Mike getting his jollies in for the day. There are surfers in South Africa. John Whitmore is the leader of the group in Cape Town. John makes surfboards and sells Volkswagens. There are about a hundred surfers around Cape Town, and when Mike and Robert arrived, all 100 of them took the day off to go surfing. California surfers usually split up into small groups. and go to different beaches, trying to avoid crowds. Here in Cape Town, they like to go all together. Down the Cape Highway, past many beaches with no one on them and good surf. But they don't split up. They all go to the same beach. It doesn't matter what beach, as long as they're together. They were also anxious to see Mike and Robert surf. They get to the beach together, but when they actually surf, they split up into small groups. One or two, 10 or 20-- They don't care. The more, the merrier. These are brave men. As you can tell, they haven't been surfing long in Cape Town, but they really have a ball. They get out there and really go at it-- bite, scratch, kick and really shove each other around. John Whitmore, who made most of their surfboards. He's also been surfing longer than most of the other people down there. The South Africans were so enthusiastic about Mike and Robert's surfing ability, there were instances when surfers drove 400 miles just to meet them. They'd drive 400 miles, get out of the car, shake hands and drive 400 miles back home again. There are very few teenagers that surf around Cape Town. Here's one of the few, Peter Basford, getting a nice ride. The average age around Cape Town for surfers would be in their late 20s and 30s. Mike and Robert were quick to make friends with the natives. wherever they visited. Robert with a good pair of dark glasses on so they couldn't see where he was looking. They spent a few happy days around Cape Town meeting natives, but they'd come here to get away from the crowds. and find a beach they could surf by themselves. So they borrowed a car and struck off alone down the Cape Peninsula. to look for some surf. If you want to be alone, you're welcome to be alone in South Africa. It's one of the few places in the world you can even be alone on the main highway. You pass many beaches with not a soul on them, not a footprint in the sand, and there hasn't been one in 10 years. You can be so alone on the beach down there, it's almost scary. They called this place Long Beach. and paddled out for a few waves. Conditions here resemble Northern California, with heavy kelp beds outside. The kelp cuts the chop and makes the waves inside smoother, although it makes them smaller. This is on the Atlantic side of the Cape Peninsula, and although it's summertime, the water temperature is only 54 degrees. It never gets very warm on the Atlantic side of the peninsula, but only five miles away across land is the Indian Ocean. The water there is sometimes 20 degrees warmer on the same day. The best surf seems to be on the Atlantic side, so most of the surfing around Cape Town is done in cold water, even in the summer. with the tremendous difference in water temperature between the two oceans. separated by such a narrow land mass, it causes some pretty good winds to blow. Here's a little afternoon offshore breeze around Cape Town. [wind whistling] Nobody gets very excited about it. They just tie their car to a tree and watch their kids as they go sailing by. Mike and Robert decided to head for Durban, which is 1,200 miles up the Indian Ocean coast. So off they went to Durban. If you try to hitch a ride at Durban, you can sit there. for three days and never see a car. As the hours rolled by and the warm summer sun beat down, Mike couldn't help but think back to the summer that had passed in California, and the places that break during California's summertime, like The wedge in Newport Beach. The dirty old wedge. The dirty old wedge, where $6,000 worth of swim fins were lost last year-- and their owners. The wedge in California, where you catch waves you didn't even want. You come out of the water after a wave like this, your back looks like a Twist-O-Flex watchband. Few people ride bellyboards at The wedge. Bodysurfing is bad enough, because when you get wiped out, it feels like your arms, legs and head are all going different directions. Add a bellyboard to that mess, it's like an extra piece of shrapnel in a hand grenade. The waves break in very shallow water, so if you don't land just right, you can really get bent. They come out with shovels at low tide and dig you out of the sand. Usually on a big day, it's a very short ride. It's kind of a big drop. Occasionally someone gets a long ride. Here's some kind of record for a big day. I can't figure out whether this guy has a bellyboard. or is bodysurfing. or has rigor mortis of the stomach. You may wonder why people don't occasionally land on each other. As a matter of fact, occasionally they do. In fact, they do it all the time. Here's once. This is the slam-bang, crowded action of California's summertime. Mike Hynson and Robert August were glad they were here, especially when they looked down the highway. and saw the first car coming their way. in the shimmering heat waves of summer in South Africa. There was a truck with a surfboard on top. A surfboard's a rare thing to see in South Africa. It turned out to be a young surfer named James. and an older fellow named Terence. who was taking James a few miles up the coast to go surfing. They met, and Mike and Robert explained they were headed for Durban, 1,200 miles away. Terence was only going a few miles, but he thought it over for a minute and said, "what the heck? Load your boards. I'll take you to Durban." On the spur of the moment, Terence decided, and ended up driving Mike and Robert over 2,000 miles through South Africa, a trip that took him out of his way for two weeks. Terence Bullen. He doesn't surf. He captures animals for zoos around the world. and milks cobra snakes for their venom. He handles a thousand deadly cobras a week, and when he's not extracting their venom, he keeps them in baskets in his bedroom. He's one of the few people in the world to capture an African elephant alive. Terence wasn't afraid of anything in the world, except the ocean, and he wouldn't go in that for anything. This is the truck he uses for hunting safaris. This is the truck that took us 1,200 miles along the virgin coastline of the Indian Ocean. If you thoroughly explored the surfing possibilities along the beaches, it would take you 10 years. we just concentrated on places right alongside the paved highway. You pull off in the morning, look out. There'll be a place like this. It doesn't even have a name. So you go out for a wave before breakfast. About 300 miles north of Cape Town on the Indian Ocean, the water was 70 degrees. Offshore breezes. Perfect conditions. There are hundreds of places like this up and down that 1,200-mile coastline. between Cape Town and Durban. Mike out, along with James, who is just learning how to surf. Robert stayed on the beach to keep his eye on Terence. because Terence had a habit of pulling tricks on them. Like one time he caught a couple of cobras. and wrapped them up in their sleeping bags. when they unrolled the bags, he really laughed. He thought that was hysterical. This particular day, Terence got a couple of horses. and launched Mike and Robert down the beach. They'd never ridden one in their lives. He laughed so hard, he almost got a hernia. Robert with a death grip on an English saddle. Threatened to drown Terence if he could catch him. With this man, we drove thousands of miles through South Africa. Mike's radio always at full volume. Scared the daylights out of any animal around. These animals are really an impressive thing to see. You drive through countryside that looks like parts of the United States. You almost forget you're in Africa. But suddenly you remember when a big eland goes trudging off from beside the road. It weighs almost a ton. As the countryside changes, you see different animals. A little further along, we saw a herd of impala having lunch. right beside the road. Mike and Robert like to surf more than anything else, but they each felt they'd like to spend at least six months in South Africa. doing nothing but looking at animals. It's really an impressive thing to see. There are hundreds of different kinds, and Terence knew them all. with his sharp eyes, he could spot them about 10 miles away. This is a bontebok, now rare. Mike started his career as a game stalker in his camouflage shirt. Terence would always send them out after things. He'd say, "See how close you guys can get to those giraffes." Then he'd lock the doors, roll up the windows, sit in there giggling like a maniac, tell you about the lion in the bushes later. There are millions of monkeys in South Africa. If you park your car out in the country and forget to lock it, the monkeys climb out of the trees, get in the car and take anything. that's not bolted down-- windshield wipers, radio knobs, everything in the glove compartment-- and pass it up to their buddies in the tree. They've got a regular auto supply store going up there. You come back and start yelling for your parts, they just giggle and throw you down a '38 Hudson hubcap. There are many native villages. This is a Zulu village. we were a little afraid to go in it, so Mike picked out the littlest guy to meet first. He was more afraid than we were. Arrow shirt going there. Shot by an arrow. He couldn't speak English, and we couldn't speak Zulu, so we just shook hands and tried to be friendly. Robert called him "Mr. Clean." Continuing the journey up the coast. The further north you go in South Africa, the hotter it gets. They drove all night, arriving in Durban first thing in the morning, and were greeted by some of the local surfers who live in the area-- Jack Wilson, Max Wetteland and Harry Bold. Morning comes pretty early in Durban. The sun is already up, and it's only 4:30 a.m. Robert out for a few waves in the shimmering heat. of tropical South Africa-- Durban. 4:30 in the morning-- it's already 80 degrees out. water temperature about the same. With the warm water, there's a tremendous problem with sharks. Later in the afternoon, around 5:30 a.m., some more of the local surfers showed up. They haven't been surfing long around Durban either, but they get some great rides. They call their bathing suits down there "costumes." In America, we call this thing a G-string. As I mentioned, sharks are a tremendous problem here. If you go in the water away from the main beach, the odds are 50-50 you'll be killed by a shark. This beach is meshed, or netted against sharks. But even here you keep your eyes open. You look over the top of a wave and see a fin coming toward you, your heart stops. If you're swimming, you really wish you weren't. Turned out to be only a group of friendly porpoises. who were coming in to see what was going on in their ocean. Shows you how well the nets work. Everyone's happy to see the porpoises, because when they're around, they seem to keep the sharks away. Sharks and porpoises have yet to integrate in South Africa. After surfing, you can ride the Zulu rickshaw down the promenade. It's a lot of fun. All the tourists do it. This driver wasn't very heavy, and he wasn't used to all the weight in the rickshaw. He was bouncing along Zulu-style, bounced once too high. and got stuck up there. Leaving Durban, heading to Johannesburg where we catch a plane for Australia. Driving through the interior past these rugged thorn bushes. that reminded us so much of tough old Terence. and the dirty tricks he pulled, like telling Mike to go pet the zebra. what we remember most about South Africa. is a place we discovered with our friend Terence. On the map, we could see a big cape sticking out seven miles to sea, a point of land called on the map Cape St. Francis. It was about three miles across these sand dunes to the water. we had no idea what was on the other side, but we'd come halfway around the world, so we thought we'd go take a look. we struck off across the sand dunes led by our friend. "Terence of Africa." Halfway around the world and halfway across the dunes, it seemed like a bad idea. It started to get pretty hot. The odds were against us finding surf. we didn't even know if we'd find the water. when you go looking for surf, you don't look for a really big wave. If you found one, you'd never ride it in strange waters. It would be much too dangerous. what every surfer dreams of finding is a small wave with perfect shape. what we call a perfect wave. The odds against finding that are 10 million-to-one. They finally got their first look at Cape St. Francis, South Africa. You can't tell how good a wave is till you actually ride it. On Mike's first ride, the first five seconds, he knew he'd finally found that perfect wave. The waves looked like they'd been made by some kind of a machine. The rides were so long, I couldn't get most of them on one piece of film. Here's Mike further along, still riding the same wave at Cape St. Francis. On some of the rides, I timed them in the curl for 45 seconds. Outside, really driving about halfway through the wave already, Robert August. Look at the wave in front. Same perfect shape as the wave he's on. After we rode Cape St. Francis, we talked to fishermen. who come in this area quite frequently. They told us the waves there were funny looking things. They said they looked like pipes. And they said the waves always looked like that. Day after day, same stupid looking waves. They told us of days when the surf broke big out by the end of the cape, seven miles further out, and rolled all the way in to where we were surfing. Can you imagine riding a 15-foot wave shaped like this for seven miles? You'd have a nervous breakdown the first 50 yards. I had one on a three-foot wave. From all the information we could gather, we figure it's like this about 300 days of the year. The water was 70 degrees, the prevailing wind there, straight offshore. A perfect wave, and perfect conditions. The only disadvantage was you kept getting cramps in your legs. from squatting down for so long in the curl. The thing you can't show is the fantastic speed. and that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach. It's the kind of a wave that makes you talk to yourself. I couldn't help but think of the hundreds of years. these waves must have been breaking here. But until this day, no one had ever ridden one. Think of the thousands of waves that went to waste, and the waves that are going to waste right now at Cape St. Francis. Out of the whole day of surfing, we didn't see one wave section, or break in front of itself. Each wave was perfect. The surf came in diagonally, which gave you this long ride-- was shallow, only a foot or two deep beneath Robert's board. Sandy bottom with rocks along the shoreline. Strictly a one-man wave. Just wasn't room for two surfers. Here, Robert's really in the right spot. But Mike, with the wake of his board. causing the wave to break sooner than it normally would have. Before long, Mike was in the right spot. Every surfer dreams of finding a place as good as Malibu or Rincon. we found a place that's better, and it's better every day. The best ride of the day was one that Robert got-- really locked in, screaming at the top of his lungs. Robert came over the top of the wave. and let out a bellow you could hear halfway back to Cape Town. He was so excited, he was almost frothing at the mouth. Mike was kind of excited too. Oh, big deal. we've seen a lot of surfing so far in the endless summer. Let's see what it looks like now when you're actually in the water riding. as we watch the amazing footwork of Mr. Phil Edwards in Hawaii. I'd like to show you what a wipeout looks like from the board. I'm pretty good at getting wiped out, so I'll be the stooge. If you watch carefully, you can see the board pearl, the coral bottom and my head come by with bubbles coming out the ears. You come up looking for your board and find. you have one extra hole in the head from the back of the camera. while Mike and Robert are making their way to Australia, let's see what's going on in Hawaii. Lots of girls surf in Hawaii, and many of them are very good. Taking off outside in the green. "chest protector," Bernie Ross. This is Haleiwa Beach on the North Shore of the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Butch Van Artsdalen with a spinner. There's a shallow spot in the reef at Haleiwa. right about there. Butch Van Artsdalen, really a fantastic surfer. Switches his stance back and forth, riding with either foot forward. A few surfers do this, but none as well as Butch. He does it in impossible situations, like right in the middle of a pullout in midair. Right here. Butch Van Artsdalen. A surfer who's not as skilled as Butch. but who has as much fun as anyone's ever had surfing. is Lord James Blears, the famous wrestler. Here goes the Lord with one of his famous "Tallyho" pullouts. Tallyho! If he gets mad at the wave, he just crushes the poor thing. The wave gets mad at you, it just crushes you right back again. On a crowded day at Haleiwa, you see boards and bodies going in every imaginable direction. Although by the calendar it's wintertime in Hawaii, the water is 75 degrees, and so is the air. The temperature only changes about two degrees during the year. So unless you have sensitive skin, you can't tell whether it's winter or summer in Hawaii. Hawaii is truly a land of an endless summer. Fella you saw at Malibu now riding Haleiwa, Miki Dora. Miki rides well frontwards. or backwards. A Hawaiian surfer who's really fantastic is Conrad Cunha. when he plants his 200 pounds right over his feet, you get the feeling nothing could knock him off that board. Just like he's glued down. In fact his friends call him "willie will Hold." Out in front of Conrad, Australian Mick McManus, really getting covered up. There was a young fellow out surfing that day. who had a little trouble with a growth on his back. Actually, his father fixed him up with a life preserver. so if he fell off he'd float. face down. Dear old Dad. with a warm wind in Hawaii blowing, you'll often see the speedy Pacific catamarans. out in the Ala wai Yacht Harbor having a ball. Surfers when they're not surfing having almost as much fun. The gusts of wind blowing out of Manoa Valley. And when the crews hiking out to windward trying to hold the hull down. Hiking out, hanging onto a thin line. Thin, slippery line. Once you lose your crew, you're liable to lose the whole boat. These cats are a lot of fun in the harbor, but they're a real thrill on the open ocean riding ground swells. Let's hop on board one now with Bob Casey. and Phil Edwards in the blue water off Diamond Head. and see what it looks like from on board charging at a ground swell at 20 miles an hour. water comes off the bow like it was shot from a fire hose. Phil decided to cool off, troll for sharks. wiggle your toes three times and strike! whether you like to surf or sail, or surf a sailboat, Hawaii, even in the winter, is truly the land of an endless summer. Let's rejoin Mike and Robert. They've left Africa, traveled up through India, across the equator for the third time down to Perth, Western Australia. Let's hop on down there and see what's going on. They met some of the local residents, and a few surfers too. A group of Australian blokes took Mike and Robert with them on a surfing trip. They drove over a thousand miles in four days looking for surf. Everywhere they went they were greeted with a familiar cry. surfers have heard a thousand times each, "You guys really missed it. You should have been here yesterday." The roads aren't the greatest in western Australia. When there are no roads, they just commandeer a tractor and manure cart. and get to the beach that way. Down to a place called Ocean Beach near the little town of Denmark, Western Australia. Beautiful, deserted beach, but not much surf this day. They were thinking of hiking down to the beach to go surfing anyway. when they saw an all-too-familiar Australian site. we call them sharks. They Australians call them "the men in the gray suits." whatever you call them, they like your body. The place didn't look that red-hot anyway. The only wave they found in four days of searching around Perth. was the three-inch wake of this little boat. Mike riding the wake unattached. The people on the boat said, "Gee, Mike, you should've been here yesterday. we had a bigger boat." He braved the shore break and came in. They picked up some surplus Australian army hats that they hoped would change their luck. Maybe they'd have better luck and strike some good surf at their next stop. 2,000 miles across the Australian continent to Melbourne. They were greeted by some local surfers. and lost no time in heading from the city of Melbourne to Bells Beach. about 60 miles away with high hopes of hitting some summer surf. Down the dry, dusty dirt road to Bells Beach. They pulled up on the bluff to get their first look at the famous Bells Beach surf. and were greeted with the cry, "You guys really missed it. You should've been here yesterday." There wasn't much surf, so they just went down to the beach to meet some of the local blokes. and found out an interesting thing. Bells Beach is the fly center of Australia. You go onto the beach and there are 30 flies assigned to your body. when you leave, they go back to command headquarters. and wait for another assignment. They met a young fella named Rodney Sumpter who told them, "You didn't miss it yesterday. You missed it by about six months. Because it's during the wintertime we get the best surf at Bells, round about July." He said, "Remember that dry dirt road you came in on today? well, during the winter, it's not a dry dirt road anymore." Rodney said the surf isn't the same either. And obviously it isn't. He told them of all the great days of surf. he and Nat Young had had riding Bells Beach. Nat Young here, only 16 years old, and one of the very finest surfers in Australia. The winter conditions in Melbourne in July are very similar. to the winter conditions in Southern California in December. water temperature between 55 and 60 degrees, and general conditions about the same. But it's Bells Beach, Melbourne, Australia. Here goes Rodney Sumpter, our storyteller, and also a great young Australian surfer. He, too, 16 years old. "Yeah," said Rodney. "Should've come in July." Rodney knew what he was talking about, so they asked him if he'd ever been back to Perth. where they'd just come from. Rodney laughed and said, "Sure, I've been back there. Heck, I'm 16 years old. I've been almost everywhere." And Rodney told Mike and Robert all about a trip. he and Nat made back to western Australia. Only they made their trip during the wintertime. They went to the exact beach Mike and Robert had been to-- Ocean Beach, Denmark. Only the day they arrived, they had good luck and struck some beautiful little curls. It's very difficult to get good waves when you're traveling around. If you live in an area, you're bound to get a number of good days a year. But if you're just passing through for a day or a week, the chances are you won't strike a really good day. Nat and Rodney were lucky at the same beach Mike and Robert hadn't been. The Australians are very competitive surfers. They always like to do one better than "the yanks" as they call us. So if you go out and hang five, they'll go out and hang 10. You hang 10, they'll do one better, which is something like hang body. "Yeah," said Rodney. "It was a good trip. "But don't worry. You're headed for Sydney. "There's good surf there quite often in the summer. With a little luck, you'll strike it good." With a little luck, they struck it bad. Three-foot wind chop, one-foot waves and three inches of rain. So they went down to the beach and met some of the local rogues. Out of any group of surfers, there's always one who will say the same thing. "You guys really missed it. You should've been here yesterday." By now, Robert was ready to snap. He said, "wait a minute, buddy. "If you were in Hawaii right now at Waimea Bay, it might really be big. And when I say 'big,' fella, I really mean big." That's what Robert means-- really big. In fact, when Waimea Bay in Hawaii gets big, it's a whole specialized part of surfing. They'll sometimes sit and watch it for a couple of hours before going out. If it gets too big and closes out, the closest place you can get ashore. is 20 miles away. Special boards are used called "big guns." You have to wait for a lull in the shore break. before you can even try to get out. Sometimes you'll stand there for half an hour. waiting for a chance to get through this shore break. People started to gather and watch as the surfers who made it out. to sit in groups and talk nervously in low tones. waiting for the first big set of waves. It's not uncommon to see fire engines and ambulances on the beach. when the first big sets come marching through, out you paddle with your heart in your mouth. Someone's gotta turn around and take off on the first wave. Miki Dora did. and wished he hadn't. Greg Knoll rode Waimea Bay with such aggressiveness, he earned himself the nickname of "The Bull," hanging on through unbelievable masses of white water. Only a handful of surfers actually ride these big waves. Some of them are sportsmen. Some of them are nuts. Waimea Bay on the North Shore of Oahu in Hawaii. This will give you an idea of the fantastic power of these waves. A surfboard is as buoyant as a cork. It takes a tremendous amount of power to hold one underwater. when Dick Brewer gets wiped out, watch how long his surfboard gets held down. You'll finally see it pop up in the upper right hand corner of the picture. Imagine what his body's been doing under there all that time. The most dangerous thing in a big wave. is to get hit with your surfboard or someone else's board. A surfboard hurled with the force of one of these waves can cut you in half. So the most common sight you see at Waimea is surfers diving off, trying to get away from their board underwater to safety. They're diving in awkward positions-- literally diving-- to save their own lives. when you see one of these big waves letting down in front of you, your heart's beating so fast, you can do a standing broad jump of 15 feet. and not even know it. Just paddling out can be a national disaster. You take off, make the steep drop, hear the white water rumbling behind you and feel the spray on your back. You see you're going to make it into the safety of the shoulder. It feels like the happiest day of your life. Waimea Bay has only been ridden since 1958. when the first group of surfers challenged it. Yet surfers watched it break for 10 years before going out. Can you imagine the courage it took to be the first? If you could harness the power of one of these waves, you could light a city. for a week. This one really putting on a display of power, shooting plumes of white water 40 feet in the air, almost defying humans to challenge it. "Yeah, fella, you really missed it." The guy said, "well, we're going out surfing here. You wanna go out?" Robert said, "No. I don't think so." The Aussie said, "Well, some of the kids are going out anyhow." "Some of the kids in Australia are too much." Mike and Robert figured, "Well, it's not that bad out there." They might as well go out. This is one of the girl surfers in Australia. Her name is Pearl. "Hi, Mike." Her bathing suit is nothing unique down there. Most of the girls wear the same kind of a suit. There's another girl paddling out. Same type. Doesn't bother anybody. But it bothered Robert, and it bothered Mike. Robert had never done a spinner in his life. when the girls get wiped out, they have some trouble losing parts of these suits. The darn things are so little they roll up in a ball and go down a clam hole or something. and they never find them again. The lifeguards down there carry spare bathing suits. Carry 15 in a Band-Aid box. Mike Hynson and Robert August were quick to make friends. with the natives in any country they visited. Pearl had to go home. Mike was one of the last of the good guys, so he said he'd run her on home. All Robert could say was, "Ah, fudge." Leaving Australia, we're headed 1,200 miles across the Tasman Sea. to New Zealand. This is really a beautiful country, with high mountains and waterfalls. It's about the size of California, but with only two million people. There are 10 million sheep in New Zealand. More sheep than people. This is one of the beautiful East Coast beaches. Perfect conditions, but surf that rarely gets over three feet. On the West Coast, it's a little more rugged. The surf on the west Coast rarely drops below six feet. The wind usually blows about 20 knots, making poor surfing conditions. John Paine and Tim Murdoch, two New Zealand surfers we met-- they took us on a trip leaving from Tim's house near Auckland, heading to the extreme northeast tip of the island, a place called Ahipara. Driving there Tim and John explained Ahipara was a well-known surfing spot. A lot of people surf there. Last year, they figured probably. three or four. Here's the cove at Ahipara on the extreme northeast cape. of New Zealand's North Island. Robert and John Paine paddling out for a wave. with horses clomping along the path in the background-- people coming in from the sheep ranch. This is considered a fair sized day for New Zealand's East Coast. That's part of a paddle wheel of an old steamship that went aground. It's Christmastime in New Zealand right in the middle of their summer. They think of Santa Claus as a guy who wears Bermudas and hangs out on the beach. Tim and John went home to spend Christmas with their parents. and left Mike and Robert to explore New Zealand by themselves. Heading from the East to West Coast, you pass through the mountains. Mike and Robert stop to sample a little of the world-famous. New Zealand trout fishing. A pleasant way to spend a day, and also a good way to pick up something to eat. They fished for a few hours and caught quite a few trout. This is just a baby trout by New Zealand standards. It only weighed about two pounds. It has to be over two pounds to even be legal size. Here's some of the regular fellers they caught. Four and five pound rainbow and brown trout. That evening, they had roast trout on a stick. Page 44 of their woody woodchuck manual. But it tasted pretty good. They had enough fish for weeks. They had trout for dinner, trout sandwiches for lunch, flaked trout in their mush in the morning, rotten trout. They camped out that night in the mountains of New Zealand. and struck off the next morning for the west Coast. and a place called Raglan. It's an amazing country to drive through. One minute there's a cool mountain stream. Around the corner, a thermal area with a pit of bubbling mud. On down to Raglan on New Zealand's west Coast. This is the huge cove at Raglan, many miles across and a couple of miles deep. The lines of surf rapping in from the Tasman Sea. It was blowing about 15 knots, which is considered fairly glassy for the west Coast. watch Mike catch his fin on a rock here just underwater. Oop. It was Christmas Day, and they had the huge cove at Raglan all to themselves. The most unique thing about this place is the length of the ride. The ride's so long it's ridiculous. I can't even show you a complete ride. It would take the whole second part of the film. So I'll show you kind of highlights of one of Robert's rides. This is about the middle part of the ride. Later in the day, here's some more of the middle part of the ride. Once the novelty of the long ride wears off, it gets kind of boring. You start talking to yourself, reciting poetry, yodeling-- anything to keep your mind occupied. This is the shore break. It only lasts for about 15 minutes. You go out surfing for the day at Raglan, you get two rides-- one after breakfast, and one after lunch. If you try for three, you starve to death. Surfers here don't carry wax. They carry life-raft rations. Mike and Robert riding it together in the afternoon. so they'd have someone to talk to. Mike was discussing highlights of the trip. Robert kept saying, "watch where you're going, Mike. If you fall off, you won't get in till tomorrow morning." Drying off after the day of surfing in the afternoon summer sun of New Zealand, they remarked to each other how ironic their trip had been so far. In Africa, where they really didn't expect to find surf, they found such good waves. In Australia that has good surf, they'd been unlucky and hadn't gotten anything. Here in New Zealand, they'd had a few pretty good days, but they knew it could've been even better. That's what it's like when you're following the summer around the world. looking for places to surf. Their next stop would be the island of Tahiti. Ask anyone who's been there and they'll tell you the same thing-- there's no surf in Tahiti. The reason they say is because this barrier reef. cuts up all the surf coming into the beach. But it makes for crystal-clear waters in the lagoons. This is about six feet of water we're flying over with coral and sand on the bottom. Didn't take Mike and Robert long to get into the swing of things in Tahiti. A flower behind that ear means they're not married. And they kept hollering, "Hey! I'm not married!" Although there's no surf, they thought they'd go paddle in the lagoon. And although there's no surf, they found something that looked kind of like a wave. They called this place "El Stumpo." They named it El Stumpo after the famous Polynesian explorer. Leonardo El Stumpo. The waves weren't gigantic, but they were well formed little devils. You could see the waves breaking on the reef in the background. There was a pass through the barrier reef, and the swells were coming through and breaking near the beach. For such a tiny little wave, you could really get worked over. Everyone said there was no surf in Tahiti, but they had already found some, so they thought they'd better drive around the island. and take a good look. Off they went through the famous town of Papeete. You get to one side of the island, and you find everyone's wrong. There is surf in Tahiti. There's no barrier reef at all on one side of the island. There's all kinds of surf rolling into the black sand beaches. Just a matter of finding the right beach. with the right bottom contours, the right swell direction, and you'll find a place to surf. we found an interesting spot. we called it "Ins and Outs". because you could ride the wave in, or you could ride the wave out. The wave going out had better shape than the wave did coming in, so they spent most of the time riding out. The waves would roll in, up the steep beach, back down the steep beach and right back out to sea again. Had enough shape and power-- you could turn, run the nose, just like you were riding in. Except you weren't. You were riding out. The Tahitian kids had ridden out most of their lives, and they were busy riding in on their surf mats and belly boards. But when they met the out part, shazam! Three ways to go-- in, out and up. Everyone inside was drowning. Here's the Royal Tahitian kid, Irving. He's got the shiniest skin on the block. Mike with a record long ride out at Ins and Outs, heading straight out to sea, straight toward Hawaii. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the Tahitian kids having so much fun surfing. They didn't know there was no surf in Tahiti. This place got kind of confusing, so Mike and Robert paddled down the beach a few hundred yards. and found another surfing spot. They called this other spot "The Other Spot." It was a pretty good spot too. The best waves came through right in the middle of a rain squall. It was kind of weird when it rained. The rain was 75 degrees. The water was 75 degrees. The air temperature was 75 degrees. It was so pleasant, it almost made you sick to your stomach. The people in Tahiti were really insistent about there being no surf. Mike came out of the water once and a man said, "Hey, there's no waves in Tahiti." He'd been standing right there watching Mike surf. Mike didn't want to be a smart aleck, so he just said, "Well, sir, they're pretty good things, whatever you call 'em." Here's Mike with a nice ride on a Tahitian thing. On their last evening, they set out beyond the breaker line. and remarked to each other how ironic it had been again. Here in Tahiti where there's not supposed to be any surf. they found three places, El Stumpo, Ins and Outs, and the Other Spot. Their next stop would be Hawaii. On the plane, they were anxious to get to Hawaii. They didn't have to look for surf anymore. They knew right where to find it. Mike was itching to get his feet in a board in Hawaii and get a few waves. It wasn't long before he did. Good old Hawaii. It sure was great to be back in the Islands. No more searching for surf. Just go out and ride in the warm blue water. Good old Hawaii and the friendly natives. And the junior birdmen. Ooh! Oh! Good old Hawaii and the dirty old nasty Pipeline. This is the surfing spot that's hardly even a surfing spot. It's more like a Roman gladiator's pit. So dangerous, it almost defies description. The way the waves break is bad enough. But it's also very shallow, and on the bottom is coral. Not the usual formation, but coral that sticks up like big overgrown railroad spikes. You hang onto your board, you go over the falls with it every time, guaranteed. Any wipeout at the Pipeline in Hawaii is a bad one. And most places, when someone gets wiped out, everyone watching on the beach laughs. No one laughs at the Pipeline. They wait and see if you come up again. No one laughed very hard when Bob Pike came out of the water. with a broken collarbone and three broken ribs. from bouncing off the shallow bottom. You ride this place with a different attitude. You don't want to fool around. You want to make that wave more than anything in the world. A surfer who rode the place better than anyone thought ever imaginable. was Butch Van Artsdalen. The waves came marching through and Butch kept doing impossible things, getting impossible rides on impossible waves to ride. It seemed like Butch was invincible, like he could do nothing wrong, coming through one unbelievable tube after another, almost making this wave-- Not quite. The wave hit his board dead-center, and Butch had two halves. You can drive a car over a surfboard and it won't break. But a wave at the Pipeline can easily snap one in half. when the collapsing wave squirts air and water out the end, it sounds like a jet plane taking off. If you're standing there, you get blown right off your board. There's so much adrenaline pumped through your system on a wave like this. that when you get to the shoulder, the easy part, you're so relieved, you just sometimes fall off in a semi faint. The worst wipeout I've ever seen was Danny Derone at the Pipeline. An upside-down, head-dip, human pile driver.
