- The fact that I'm the owner. - What are you talking about? The company went public a week ago. And I bought most of the shares. Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth. Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing is that my company's future is secure. Right, Mr. Fox? Right you are, Mr. Wayne. Didn't you get the memo? - I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel. - No. No, Bruce I'm sorry. The day that Chill died, I. I said terrible things. But true things. I was a coward with a gun and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you. I never stopped thinking about you. About us. And when I heard you were back, I. I started to hope. But then I found out about your mask. Batman's just a symbol, Rachel. No. This is your mask. Your real face is the one that criminals now fear. The man I loved the man who vanished he never came back at all. But maybe he's still out there somewhere. Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman I'll see him again. - Proved me wrong, you know. - About what? Your father would be very proud of you. Just like me. What will you do? Rebuild it. Just the way it was, brick for brick. Just the way it was, sir? Yeah, why? I thought this might be a good opportunity for improving the foundations. - In the southeast corner? - Precisely, sir. - Nice. - I couldn't find any mob bosses. - Well, sergeant? - It's "lieutenant" now. You really started something. Bent cops running scared. Hope on the streets. - But? - The Narrows is lost. And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed. We will. We can bring Gotham back. - What about escalation? - Escalation? We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds. - And? - And you're wearing a mask and jumping off rooftops. Now, take this guy. Armed robbery, double homicide. Got a taste for the theatrical, like you. Leaves a calling card. I'll look into it. I never said thank you. And you'll never have to.

You are here in my neighbourhood. If you do what I say, everything will be fine. You shut up and I speak. All Ok, men? Gentlement. The rent was paid by my son. We are not bailiffs. We have a few questions for you. I don't know where Nabil is. Mrs Beyoud, it's Ousmane Diakhité. The small Ousmane from building 7? That's me. - I can't believe it. May we come in? - Naturally. Come on. No . the rules have remained the same. Shoes off. Damn. You have to sit on it. - Thank you. Tea? No, thank you. - You're young, you have to eat. You have to take it. That's hospitality. The warmth. Thank you, ma'am. - So you're in the police. You're no longer crying. You're a man now. Did he cry a lot? - All the time. As a child, Nabil often teased him. Ousmane cried. - Oh really. You exaggerate. I did not cry, we played. No, he cried. We heard him all the time. Remember when Nabil pulled off your pants . and you ran through the whole district in tears? No! - Yes! The shame. - No shame. In underpants? - Yes. He crapped himself rotten in those underpants! Do not confuse me with Samba? He is in denial. Yes, why do you deny it? - We were talking about Nabil. Do you know where we can find him? - No idea. Where can I wash my hands, please? That at the end of the corridor. There. Take it easy. You've grown up. You're with the police. Well done.

Why didn't you tell me? - I did this. -And what the hell does that mean? -"Run" like that. That is "building", that is "run". No, that's "Get out of the way, out of the way". - No, "Get out of the way" is this. No, that's "go away" and this is "run". Whatever. - You said "walk" damnit. relax. It's a misunderstanding. It's just that you looked so happy. "He's mine! He's mine!" I have left it for you. I came to help you. Why are you hiding? Something on your slate? - Fuck off. I thought you guys were bailiffs. I am called Giovanni. your stuff. Let him go immediately. - Bitchers, let him go! Pipe down. Serious Crimes, Paris. Everything is under control. Just walk by. - Big mouth for a bitch with a badge.

Yes, the case with the gypsies, I was that way he can not say anything. Seriously, take some paper and go do some origami. No, the paperwork , that's your speciality. Murder? I did not kill anyone. She asked me if I knew a place to gamble. And Van Gogh wanted me to find customers. So I did that. - I've seen your file. There are virgin criminal records, but yours is quite raped. Good one, hey. What he means by his shit joke, is that you're in shit. Talk. I did not kill anyone. We are family. I've beaten, but loving. - &9a#jj. Stop that family stuff. I have no time to lose.

That evening she had to pay 100,000 euros. You don't kill good customers. You build a customer base. - She came alone? One evening she came with a man. With suit and tie. Like him? - That's not him. And him? - Maybe. They all look alike. - He turns around. Did he also gamble? - No, he did not want to. They quarreled. - About? He did not want to pick up the children from the creche. I blink!

Black, white, North African. Zinedine Zidane. Unbelievable. - Shut up. She looked at me as a courier. And I have no helmet. Is this Serious Crimes service ? It's in a state of decomposition. It's like us. - But it's the 36th. It's historic. Stupid, but true. We have your viewed girlfriend's accounts . She had no right to an account. Look. One year without payment. She gambled every day. There are witnesses. 100,000 cash. Where did that come from? We have to do a search at Chaligny. We enter quietly. - You're the Attorney. We are not cowboys. Why not? - You must be lieutenant Diakhaté. Diakhite. Greetings, Captain Morland. Strange to see you. He often talks about you. Is the case closed? Do the Gypsies know? Yes. - No. No. No. Unknown, but we know that it's his. We're going to determine that they 't be. No, but he had the idea to visit Mr. Chaligny. To leak information on our investigation. - No. Really? That's nice. Good initiative. But you better hurry up. Above, they want to see results. The spotlight is on you. I told you, you're my star. He's the best, he will solve it. Isn't that right François? Of course he is going to find it. You're the best. or not? Let Mr. Chairman through please. I'm not the chairman. No, not at all. Not today. Hold on. Hello, madam. François Monge, Serious Crimes. We would like to speak to Mr. Chaligny and Cardinet. Insofar as their schedule permits. I'm sorry, they are in a crisis meeting. They've been stuck since this morning. It could take a long time. It's hell. Yes, it's probably not fun. Thanks anyway. Would you tell him that we were here? Yes, of course. - Thank you. Good bye. This is normal. They have responsibilities. There is a crisis. Cardinet! Chaligny! Gentlemen, you can not. Please! Gentlemen, come right back. You can not go up. What are you doing? Shit! - Stop, please. We would do so quietly. - Mr. ??Chaligny is not available. We rely on you. Hello, are we disturbing you? We have a few questions for you. Inspector Monge, I'm sorry. but can you come back later? - Of course. Sorry Did you hear that? - You torture me. Not at all. - Liar. I won't allow that. - Again. You torture me. You said "you". And it was not the first time. What a spectacle. - I did not remember. Bigwigs coincide. We are in the mothership of the bigwigs. Bosses over the world . puppet players. Look, we have different shades of gray. From dark to bright. Like a rainbow, but gray. Dark, very bright, dark, very bright. Well done. You're an artist. - I'll kill you. Can I? a Mistake. Sir, this is not your home. You are the brightest. Normally that is there. You're the outsider of the gang. the madness. We expect comedians the quai des Orfèvres? I'm sorry, he's not the Quai des Orfèvres. Look, just black and white. - You wanted to see me. If your diary permits, that would. Does France need a new comic duo for a general strike? But you have something important to ask me? Well. sir. Diakhaté and I heard a testimony showing. He's gross. - You should take it with a grain of salt. I will use the subjunctive. Your wife, so Mrs.. Mrs. Chaligny obviously blessed it . because it involves her. saw someone. no psychiatrist. She was with someone. Mr. Cardinet, present here. That question you wanted to ask me in front of my employees? I asked Mr. Cardinet to go with my wife, to watch her. I knew her addiction brought her to the slums. I could not go that night. I had a union meeting with Gilles Lagache. If I had known. I wouldn't have let her go alone with ??Giovanni . Was that your question? - Yes, sir. And what is the origin of the money that your wife lost? No idea. She had her own money. - Mistake. She had no right to a private account and you knew that. Whether you gave her money, or she stole it. Unless they sold the lily-of-the-valley. - Enough! Fuck! You're beginning to annoy me. I see that question angers you. Sorry, Lieutenant Diakhaté is not his usual self. His wife is gone. - Come on, get out! I will not forget this. This is not good for your rank. Why should I? He . - Call the superintendent Get out! Why did you . Why did you do that? What have I done? What? - Why do you destroy my life? He called the superintendent - Chaligny freaked out because of the money. Something's going on. That is evident. What do we do? - No idea. Think. I call the vice-superintendent. I know him! We squash together. Go ahead. I'm going to do my job and continue our investigation. To begin the study to the agenda of Mr. Cardinet. Did you see that meegepikt? You're crazy! Want to help kill my career? - Stand still, otherwise we fall. Maybe they are watching - No. Give it back to the receptionist. - Quiet. Wait a minute . The night of the murder: Gilles Lagache. Of course. Tonight, 23 pm: La Aviary. What is that? Do you know that or not? - Vague. We need reinforcements. All the time they spend in hamams. Shaving is allowed, right? Young African women. If you look under such a burqa, you would be amazed. You're crazy! Ever thought about therapy? You should know, I've known an Oriental Princess. A cousin by marriage behind King Hassan II. a Devilish beauty, enchanting. An angel face . Cats Eyes . a Real slut. a Real slut completely shaved! Smooth, soft like a small apricot. I wanted to be very small to dive into it. You're crazy! Really sick. You've got a problem. Your colleague Yasmine . how could she shave? Why? They don't shave - No? Why should I go into that? Just saying. We know nothing. On the other hand I have nothing against a full triangle. My uniform is in order? It's perfect. - Are we going? She's wearing a uniform. What is this a place? a Sex Club? Do not be vulgar. It's a somewhat free club. Free, forget it! Hello François. Everything okay? - Hi. How you doin '? And how's work? - Busy, busy, busy. Yes? - I don't sit still. I'm married. To my Prince Charming. He sits there with the red light . - I understand. Bye. Congratulations. My best wishes. See you later. Ciao. - Yes. Ciao. I don't know who that is. That's Cardinet. Good evening, Marie-Jeanne. Everything okay? - All okay. Hi, how you doin '? It's okay, it's okay. Good evening. - Good evening. Pleasant evening. - Thank you. Good night, all ok? - Good evening. We trekken ons uniform aan. - Hoe bedoel je? Do not go in like that. Put on something loose. What do you mean by "loose"? - Like that man. That is not loose, that is naked. - Yeah, but he's relaxed. We're not going there. Yasmine, you're not. We're watching someone, right? Yes, and Cardinet doesn't know her. Let her go alone. Come on, relax. What is it? Are you sick? - No, I'm relaxed. You wouldn't say so. Hello boy. - This isn't true. How you doin '? Unbelievable. It's been a long time. This is Vivien, my tennis partner. - Hello. What is it? Do you have something against tennis? - Not at all. I'm gonna get you! - Has your right arm improved? My right, my backhand. You'll see it. I'll get you. Watch out! I'll get you whenever you want. See you. Great guy.. Cardinet. He is by Lagache. - Shit. I thought that was outstanding. No bosses it clearly depends on the context. As agreed. See you later. - They're coming!. Your hand! Hello. It's all right, damn it. - That's enough. Do not touch me. I felt your thing. You were excited. What? Me excited? Are you crazy? You stuck to me. You breathed heavily. Yes, I breathe. - You're like children. We must tackle the bag. I'm going after Cardinet. You, Lagache. - Forget it. Stay here. It's not over. Get the bag. You go get him. - No, you're naked. You're in the financial service. I have principles. Don't you understand? No. You play tennis naked, but naked in the dark, does it work? Who says I play naked tennis? - I saw you with Vivien. You saw me . When? All that bullshit before. I heard everything. Disgusting. You see filth everywhere. - I see your ass anywhere. Then don't look. - I can't miss! No, but . You! Your debauchery is contagious. You're evil. You're evil, this is your home. Go away, I don't want to be infected. Idiot! - Who is that guy? Evangelist! Black Mormon. Still. I began to worry. I do not know how you did it but bravo. Are we going? - Wait . We're going to pick up the bag. - There is no hurry. We talk further. Okay? Where is Ousmane? - The bastard! The asshole. The motherfucker. What are you doing here? Are you crazy? - I followed Cardinet. He brought a few things. We have everything. Listen. No. You're dragging me into your trap. We're going. I have a book with numbers and codes. Financial transactions. The Employers are buying social peace with money. I don't care. - There's a black book. There's a black book. That is the black book. Give me that. Hold on. Bastard. No problem. Police. A trade unionist tried to penetrate. No, not union. No papers, no sleep. No papers. Handcuffs hurt, huh? - Yes. That's not nice. That hurts. - Do not hit. That hurts. Stop sir, that hurts. Not sweet. I have done nothing. Stop, man. If you did nothing, I would not do anything. - Are you crazy? Stop. Pain.

You booklet, the bag you gave Lagache. The black list. We know everything. You will have to give an explanation. I don't know what you're talking about. I see two policemen who commit theft by forcible entry. All filmed by security cameras. I fear you have a thing to explain. You will have a lot of free time. Actually, sir, you were very cute earlier. When you caressed your boyfriend. It Creates a bond if you work in the city. Max, join our friends. Now cut me loose. I don't think so. You have committed a criminal offense. Three days ago I was future Commissioner, now Im' gonna write traffic fines. We bring the truth to light. Chaligny will hang, together with the bigwigs. We've done nothing. Since I've known you, I just do stupid things. Your little book is not admissible. Not with our burglary. You're not a fucking cop They will congratulate you. Trust me again. Don't you get it? I don't want ever to see you again. Before I met you, my life was amazing. No papers, no sleep. - No paper. What inspires you, Monge? The Superintendent wants your immediate suspension. I had to convince Chaligny not to file a complaint. I'm not worried, but you have to help me. What is it? Do you not care about your career anymore? yes. I really like you, you know that. Think about your future. You did not want to go there, huh? Bobigny Bobigny needs to keep her men in a harness. That's it. The 36th is not involved in this case. Boss. - The minister called me. Before . personally. It's my first minister in 20 years of service. What have you done? We have them. I have proof. Okay, there's a small procedure mistake . But it was worth it. Everything is ready. It's okay. I couldn't do anything, Ousmane. Some things are too big for an ordinary cop. Patrick, Lionel and I are going for drinks. Are you coming? No, thank you. Damn. I'm going anyway. <i> Yesterday there were real </ i> <i> advances. </ i> <i> Tangible, concrete advances . </ i> <i> But not enough . </ i> What? He was in it!

And you? -. I'm also on strike What's that? - Don't you know that? A classic. That is Belmondo, 'Le Professionnel'. It's not Eddy Murphy, but it's not bad. I almost had them. - What happened? I knew too much. I was too dangerous for the bigwigs. I was let down. - François? In Paris they do not have the same culture. He can not leave his colleague alone. - François . was the first to let me down. Tell me. First, we found a dead woman that smelled like urine . That was all for nothing. Case closed. That's it? What a stupid ending. - That's it. You could damage him. This can not be. Mother Beyoud is all bling. No! In front. What is that? A driver with Edouard Leclerc. That's the pinnacle. Come. What are you doing here? - Papa goes back to the district. You coming? What is all this? Never leave your colleague alone. Was that nonsense? What are you doing here, Looserman? Do you trust again? - Where's your slutty friend? He hides like a hooker. You do not understand. I'm at home here. I'm not a cop. I'm on vacation. That is good news. We're free to lash. Like a good hooker that you will remember from your youth. Damn. Whore. - Looserman! I'm tired of that stuff. It's enough. Serious crimes, Paris. I'm back because I have not penetrated. Turn around.

I have to go. The Van Gogh family wants me dead. Guys, do something. Ousmane, Ousmane, François. You think we're crazy. - No. Tell her to keep her mouth shut. They'll take you! - Are we friends or not? There's something about Yasmine that bothers me. That one night . well, we had to follow someone . but some gestures or looks don't fool. You're the expert, so I was wondering whether she is a super cop or. She is a super cop. Honest, professional . - Very careful. Move. - It stinks of piss. I'm not getting out. What's the plan? - What time is it? Quarter to. They're coming. - I think. On the whole, they are punctual . - Especially if they want their money back. Who? - The gypsies. They are very punctual. Who? The gypsies? No, not the gypsies. You can not hide behind mama. What madness is this? I'm a victim. I have not done anything. Nothing taken? Just tell them that you do not have the money. Tell your mom shopping at Leclerc. With a chauffeur. We should leave the mothers out of this. Are you cops or not? I am not. I was thrown out. - And my working hours are shortened. Wait. I know that the money came from the Employers union. Chaligny's wife picked up the cash to finance the gambling. And because of Cardinet and Mrs. Chaligny, I do not need to explain. Where's the money? You've kept it, for safety? When I dropped her off that night, I was left alone with the briefcase. I could not leave it there. The neighborhood has a bad name. Indeed. - I did not kill her, really. You understand that I do not want to die. Chaligny allowed his wife to be killed. - It would appear so. You're going to help us. <i>If it fails, you say 'carpet'.</i> <i>- 'Carpet'? Very funny.</i> <i>That should be on the ground,</i> <i>I'm getting my shoes dirty.</i> <i>How do I put 'carpet' into a sentence</i> - Figure it out! It will not change. He goes to Mr. Chaligny's car. Hello, Daniel. Are these our new offices? Yes, there's even a gym and a spa. - A spa? Where were you? On vacation? What do you want from Mr. Chaligny? The thing is, I know everything. I know everything about everything. Where the money came from, the slush fund. My mother always used to say I had to keep my mouth shut. 'It's true, I talk too much. I tell people secrets. Crazy, huh? Where is Mr. Chaligny? He's waiting in the car. Mr. Chaligny. What's that? So you know everything? - Wait, I know nothing. I know things, but which are unimportant. You steal our money and want more. Are you going to threaten me? Eponine wanted to tell everything to Chaligny, the press and even the taxman. Chaligny did not kill his wife. - Are you laying carpet in your spa? <i>Because of you, she asked me for more money.</i> <i>It's because of you.</i> It would not have happened if you had not spoken with Van Gogh. Tell me everything. I know nothing. I want it to remain so. Carpet. Do not listen to me. I talk crap. I did not know you were the culprit. Carpet! - Yes, you do. Get in. I know what you're thinking, but sometimes don't do anything. Wait. My mother said a lot of good. Forward. He will shoot. Fast. Daniel, please. What's this? You work for them? Crafty fox! I needed them. Guys, he had her killed. Carpet. Carpet. Police! Quiet. It'll be all right. Death to the employers' organizations! Are you OK? - It'll be all right. It'll be all right. It's not bad. It'll be all right. Are we in Paris or in the suburb? Paris or the suburb? We are in the suburb, man. I can go peacefully. Stop that nonsense. Out of the way. Ousmane, got it? Congratulations. Yesterday it all suddenly changed. The prosecutor is satisfied. He has seen the investigating judge. It was just a crime of passion. Caused waves in the highest circles. The Superintendent has changed his agenda to have dinner with you tonight. I have been asked to take back a document. that you have of Mr. Cardinet, which would be a document . a notebook? With details of a slush fund which proves that the employers' organization? Which proved that it could bribe or buy other unions like Mr. Lagache's. We operate in a very difficult social environment. The strike is over. The French can spare such a scandal. Where is it? Given to the investigating judge only. Should it not have been given? Yes, if you don't want a career. You know what to do. It's not admissible evidence. You have nothing. It proves that Diakhaté was right. Many bigwigs are involved. Madness, even if she died in Montaigne avenue, we wouldn't have known. Social peace has a price. - That only bigwigs pay. Can you ask the Superintendent to excuse me. I have to study. And soon, because I hear that the exams are getting more difficult. See you soon. Mr. Francois, your luxury roll. Thank you, Rita. - You're welcome. It's greasy, but tasty. Goodbye, Rita. - Thank you. A real patron, Giovanni. The Georges Moustaki youth centre. You see, bigwigs do invest in the suburb. I have something for you. New information about Barberis. - Come on!! It was easy. You were right. He's in France. And he knows them all. - who? Bigwigs. - unbelievable. But one thing you don't know. He is not in Bobigny, but in Chatou. In Cuntville? - Chatou! Idiot. But I heard . - You're a pervert.

Besides, you've got so much to live for. Please wake up! Got to go see Jimmy C. Bye. Stupid machine. STORM: Nurse. Nurse. Oh, my God! DOCTOR: We'll run some tests. Alert X-ray for a CAT scan. Call the lab. We need a complete blood work-up. John Doe. Here we are. Internal Affairs. Detective Sergeant Goodhart. (ANDY OVER PHONE) My name's Andrea Stewart, from the Coma Research Center. I'd like to speak to Captain O'Malley, please. What is this in regards to? I have a John Doe coma patient, code access 461 -Zebra. . . . . .with instructions to notify in case of change in condition. What's the change? The patient has come out of a coma after 7 years. Nolan, get Hulland, quick. I'm sorry, Captain O'Malley's no longer with this division. I'll take the information. (GOODHART OVER PHONE) And please, contact no one else on this matter. It would be better for the patient's welfare. (OFFICIAL OVER TV) Ladies and gentlemen, the President. (OVER TV) President Bush has caught the public eye with his antics. From throwing the first ball on opening day to kissing a pig for the farmers ' affections. George Bush is becoming a real crowd-pleaser. This is Andrew Louis for Cable Hospital News. What year is it? -Try not to talk. -What year is it? It's 1 990. Your charts go back for 7 years. Do you have any recollection of anything? I remember everything. You're the first patient to come out of a coma of this duration. You'll be famous. You'll be on the news. Listen to me very carefully. I'm a cop. My wife and family were murdered. That's how I got here. If you don't get me out of this hospital. . . . . .within an hour, we'll both be dead. You're my cutest patient, but not my only one. -You're making a mistake. -I'll be back. No! Don't go. How's it going, brother? Who are you? I'm Danny, the physical therapist. I'm going to give you a massage. DANNY: I'll make you feel all right. STORM: Get the fuck out. I'll just take you down the hall. AXEL: Can I see your list of patients in your coma care unit? Yes, Doctor. STORM: Get me out. Thanks for the massage, but get me out of here. Just relax. You'll get out of here real soon, I promise. Morning, Sheri. How you doing? Thank you. Thank you. -You know that doctor? -No. AXEL: John Doe! SECURITY: Excuse me. Doctor? I have to check everyone on these floors. Can I get your l.D., please? You can't have too much security. If you feel up to it, I'll get you some lemon chiffon pie out of the freezer. STORM: Get me out of here. DANNY: Don't worry. I'll take good care of you. If you want, I'll hook you up with some pizza. You got to learn to relax. Orderly! Give me a little help. Give me some help down here! DANNY: What's he doing down there?! DANNY: What's wrong? Russ! What happened? He's dead. ANDY: My poor back! AXEL: You son of a bitch! AXEL: Storm, you son of a bitch! Oh, my God! Russ! Danny! AXEL: I'll get you, Storm! J.D. ! ANDY: Oh, my God! Now will you listen to me? ANDY: Hold tight! Sorry. AXEL: Stop! ANDY: Hang on! AXEL: Watch out! Get out of the way! TRENT: Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to put a stop to it. . . . . .and we're going to start right here! We are going to put an end. . . . . .to violence in this state. And you can take that to the bank! Hulland, plaster Storm's ass with slime in the press. Make him responsible for that hospital mess. Tail people he knows. HULLAND: We know how to do our job. Then show me. I'm starring in the son of a bitch's home movies. If that crap gets out, I'm looking at 30 years. Geraldo. Who's this guy? Our program came to an unexpectedly violent conclusion. Are you crazy? I can't come in to work. I can't even go to my apartment, Martha. People are dead. (MARTHA OVER PHONE) Then where are you? I can't tell you. Besides, you're better off not knowing. (ANNOUNCER OVER TV) Senator Vernon Trent promises no new taxes. (TRENT OVER TV) And you can take that to the bank! What'll I do with this guy? I want to help him. . . . . .but he's all over TV. He's a crooked cop involved in-- Why are you out of bed? I've got you. (DUNPHY OVER TV) Police speculate that Storm who is known to have ties with criminal elements could have involved his contacts in his escape. Storm was thought to have been a murder victim. A casualty of his own greed. A widespread search is now being-- This is Mason Storm. I'd like to speak with Jerry Dunphy. No, it's not a joke. We can't stay here. They'll trace us from the hospital. Nobody knows I'm here. I'm housesitting. It belongs to a friend of my parents. He's in China on research for 6 months. The medical center only has my apartment address. Not even my friends have this number. You've got to believe me. You're safe here, okay? (DUNPHY OVER TV) This reporter was contacted personally by the "Coma Cop" fugitive officer Mason Storm who, until days ago, had been in a 7-year coma. Storm said he's innocent of charges made against him in the press and that he has indisputable proof of this. He has promised me a first look at his alleged proof. I want 24-hour surveillance on that son of a bitch. . . . . .and those 2 nurses from the hospital. No, I can do it myself. You do it then. You give me this beard? You tried. -You ever been to Chinatown? -Yeah. Why? This is a list of herbs and needles that I need for my recovery. Where did you learn to write Chinese? When I was a kid, my dad was a missionary. I was raised in the Orient. As a young white boy over there. . . . . .I needed to learn how to fight, as you can imagine. I remember. . . . . .my first martial arts teacher said to me: "So why do you come to me?" I say, "To learn how to fight. " And he says, "So you want to hurt people. But do you want to be great?" I say, "Yeah. I want to be great. " He says, "Then first learn how to heal people to be great. To hurt people is easy. " Look at you! You look great. Like it? That's enough. Why don't you go sit down? That bad? If you need me, I'll be in the outer room. STORM: O'Malley's the key. We must find him. ANDY: You can't compare blood pressure now with when you're in a coma. What's this? 555 over four digits. ANDY: That's crazy. Let me see that. Martha's chicken scratches. She probably can't even read them. -You know what it is? -What? It's a phone number. When you phoned I asked everyone here at the home. . . . . .and there is no O'Malley here. But it is possible. . . . . .O'Malley is a relation of someone here. Why not leave me your number and I'll call you if there's any contact. Can I phone you? Of course, my dear. -Here, let me do that. -That's all right. You old devil! Mason Storm. Hi. I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. I was just passing by and I thought. . . . . .you might like a flower. ANDY: I like that. STORM: Now I lay me down to sleep.. Now we say it together, okay? STORM & SONNY: I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I die before I wake l pray the Lord my soul to take. (MARTHA'S VOICE OVER PHONE) This is Martha Coe. I can 't come to the phone-- Pick up, Martha. Please pick up! ANDY: Are you there? I'm coming over. (ANDY OVER SPEAKER) Are you there? I'm coming over. HULLAND: You called it right, Axel. Our girlfriend just showed up. Martha, open up. It's me. NEIGHBOR: What's up? Hi. NEIGHBOR: Looking for Martha? You know where she is? You haven't seen the news? She's dead. She was strangled over in Westwood. Know something? You look like the bitch whose picture's on TV. The one whose house they found her at. Hey, get over here! HULLAND: Okay, boys, mount up. WOMAN: Ernie, you forgot my buttermilk! Shit! O'MALLEY: Storm! O'Malley. O'MALLEY: That's Sonny, all right. The kid's a track star. He does the hundred in 1 1 flat. He's going to be real fast, like his old man was. What do you mean "was"? I'm not over the hill. At least, I hope not. How'd you pull this off? He made it to my house the night you were shot. I got him hidden, played it out like he was dead. . . . . .staged his funeral with yours and Felicia's. Everybody bought it. Where is he? ls he safe? Ventura Trinity Prep School, under my mother's maiden name, Wade. No one has any idea that he's your son. So that was your mother that Andy found. Your nurse friend? Yeah. She left a number and I traced you here. I don't know how to thank you. I have no words. Just seeing your ugly ass alive is enough for me. That night in the hospital. . . . . .I found the audio tape in your vest. I must've played that tape 1 000 times. . . . . .Iooking for little quirks in the voices, phrases that repeat. Nada. STORM: Where is the tape? -I turned it in for evidence. -What? Don't worry, I made a dupe. Meanwhile, I thought you'd take some pleasure in this. O'MALLEY: And there's more in the car. You were not wrong, my friend. You were not wrong. What's happened to you? O'MALLEY: I was on the case maybe a year and a half. . . . . .trying to find out who pulled the trigger. But it was like swimming through shit. Everywhere I turned, people told me to back off, get lost. Then one morning the phone rings. Immaculate Heart Emergency. Someone ran my mother off the road. Her back's broken. She's paralyzed. STORM: I'm sorry, O'Mal. O'MALLEY: That night, there's a note in my locker telling me it's no accident. What the hell could I do? I've got my hands tied behind my back. I can't wave or salute. So I put my papers in. Took a 3/4 pension. You know me, I never would have backed off. But there was Sonny to worry about. What if they found him? -Or you? -No, you did the right thing. Then wasn't the time. Now's the time. We're outgunned and undermanned, but we're going to win. And I'll tell you why. Superior attitude, superior state of mind. We'll get them, buddy. Believe me. Every fucking one of them. One more favor: Get Sonny out of that school now. With me up and running, they'll do anything to find Sonny to get to me. Get him someplace safe, anywhere. O'MALLEY: Consider it done. I'm going straight to get that film. As soon as you get that audio, and Sonny's safe. . . . . .we'll bring it in to Jerry Dunphy. We'll see quite a show on the news. You got it, partner. O'MALLEY: I must've played that tape 1000 times looking for little quirks in the voices, phrases that repeat. STORM: Two guys I couldn 't make out, but they'll come up on the film. TRENT: You can take that to the bank. STORM: I know that voice. ANDY: Your charts go back 7 years. Do you have any recollection of anything? STORM: I have them on the same film in the same camera, right where I left it. ANNOUNCER: Senator Vernon Trent promises no new taxes. TRENT: And you can take that to the bank. TRENT: You can take that to the bank. I'm going to take you to the bank, Senator Trent. To the blood bank. Martha's dead. I'm sorry. It's all right. O'Malley was here today. He was? How did he get here? You found him. The old lady was his mother. My son's alive. We better get out of here. Really. Let's go. ANDY: This ain't going to be my best packing job. Where are we going? Out of here. STORM: Hurry up. ANDY: I'm just about done. Mason! It's jammed! Let's go. Get down! Come quick. Let's go! AXEL: I'll slit your throat! You're going to bleed like a pig! They're out back! We're on them! STORM: Hang on! Hulland! You son of a bitch! ANDY: I forgot to lock the door. You like my coche ? How hot is it, homes? Smoking. You got it. Maybe you should wear these kind of clothes all the time. Only next time, we'll use your credit card. Daddy, I don 't want you to go. ANDY: You look really great for someone who changed in a gas station. ANDY: We're from Hillstar Real Estate. We can market your home effectively. We aren't even thinking about selling. In fact, we're adding a nursery. It's a mess! -I'd love to see the nursery. -Over here. We don't know if it's a girl or a boy. . . . . .so we did a splatter effect. FELICIA: What are you doing? STORM: Raiding the icebox. The plasterer might have fallen! ANDY: What about your baby? STORM: Just the way I left you. Good grief! I'm sorry, but I think your contractor's doing a lousy job. These things happen. STORM: Thank God! Hang on, Mrs. O'Malley. O'Malley left there 3 hours ago with the tape. It doesn't matter about the tape. We have to get this film to Dunphy's studio. . . . . .before I have a nervous breakdown. Mrs. O'Malley, listen. I'm across from the Bonaventure Hotel. I need you to do me a favor. Have O'Malley deliver a message to the desk under Andrea Smith. No, we're not checking in. That's too dangerous. But the desk will hold the message if you tell them we're coming in later. All right? Thanks. Andrea. . . . . .Smith. Bonaventure Hotel. . . . . .and leave a message. . . .at the desk. Baby, that's beautiful! I love it. SONNY: Where's my glove, Uncle Mal? Take it easy. Sonny, hurry up, dear. Sonny, forget the mitt. We got to get going. The number for the Bonaventure Hotel, please. O'MALLEY: When this is over. . . . . .you, me and your pop will rent a boat. . . . . .and catch the biggest fish in the sea. I'm not talking goldfish either. SONNY: The last time I went fishing with Pop. . . . . .we caught an old tire. O'MALLEY: Not this time, Sonny. We'll get us a big, fat tuna. It's them. Let's go. (MARIACHI BAND PLAYS) (STEEL-DRUM BAND PLAYS) Captain Hulland, L.A.P.D. I need to check any messages for an Andrea Smith. Do you have any messages for an Andrea Smith, please? Don't worry, Sonny's okay. He's with O'Malley, who has the tape. They're headed for Union Station. Great. Let's go get the car. Just a minute. HULLAND: Cover me. HULLAND: Don't move! You're surrounded. HULLAND: Send for backup! MAN: Hey! You can't do that in Dallas! MAN: That's a rented car! HULLAND: Get the goddamn car. AXEL: Get the car! Your train's the Southwest Chief. It departs for Albuquerque at 1 1 : 1 0. Have a safe trip. SONNY: My hands are shaking. Don't worry, kid. Even your old Uncle Mally's paws wobble a bit from time to time. Put this on. Watch out for the hot dog. Don't spill mustard. Sonny. . . . I know it's hard to put together after all these years. I'm sorry I told you your dad was dead. I thought it was best. I know it's awkward. But your father loves you very much. You've got to get to know each other again. It'll take time. Now listen up. If your dad gets here on schedule, you both get on the train. If he doesn't, you'll be going alone. One of us will be one step behind. Don't worry. One step behind. Just like we planned in the car on the way here. O'Malley, long time no see! Make sure your father gets this. Are you taking a trip? Yeah, me and my kid are visiting my mother in New Mexico. That's your son? Funny, he doesn't look much like you. Does he, Quentero? As a matter of fact. . . . . .I think I've seen his ugly face before. Kind of looks like Mason Storm. Enough of this fucking around. We want the tape. Run, Sonny! Run, Sonny! Malley! QUENTERO: Take him! We're going after the kid. O'MALLEY: I love you, Sonny. You fucks don't deserve your badges! BECKER: Come here, you little son of a bitch! QUENTERO: The kid's got the tape. BECKER: Get his ass! Sonny! QUENTERO: He's going in the alley! ATTENDANT: I'll call the police! ANDY: Get out of the way! ANDY: Help! Help! ATTENDANT: This guy's crazy. He broke my gate! ANDY: Stop! Please stop! BECKER: My hand's bleeding bad. Go ahead! QUENTERO: Stop! You little bastard! BECKER: Come on, don't mess with me! BECKER: You fuck! My leg! QUENTERO: Come here or I'll kill you! BECKER: I broke my fucking leg! Coma Cop, let's see what you got. SONNY: Dad! (SIRENS) ANDY: Storm! STORM: Take care of him. ANDY: Where are you going? STORM: One more take-out order. You're safe with her. ANDY: You're okay with me. (IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Who are you? It's a very long story. You got a few minutes? HULLAND: Senator! I know it's a bad time, but things have happened-- TRENT: I want Quentero and the others here now. Storm is just nuts enough to come after me. HULLAND: That's what I'm trying to tell you. TRENT: Can we have a little privacy, please? HULLAND: I'll be downstairs. We're not going to make the ballet tonight. Take a hike. Get lost! AXEL: I'll show you guys how to break. How's the action, boys? Mind if I play? I know you're thinking, if I have this in my hand, I can't play. How's this? I'll put it away. STORM: Well? Somebody hand me a cue. Impressive. That's for my wife. Fuck you and die! Son of a bitch! STORM: How does it feel to know you're about to die? I'll give you more time than you gave my wife and son. HULLAND: I got to tell you! You can't do this! It wasn't me! Now you're a good cop. STORM: Vernon? Let's try in here. Maybe you're behind this painting. No. You're so good at this, Vernon. Maybe you're under the bed. No, not under the bed. What about in here? Vernon, where are you? How do you like this, Vernon? I'd like to kill you so bad, I can barely contain myself. But I've been thinking. Death is far too merciful a fate for you. So what I'm going to do is. . . . . .put you in prison. A nice petite white boy like you in a federal penitentiary. . . . Let me put it this way: You won't be able to stay anal-retentive very long. I'm going to take these handcuffs here. . . . . .then I'll arrest you and I'll take you in. How's that? Freeze! OFFICER: Drop the gun! Slowly! Get on your knees with your hands in the air. TRENT: Thank God! Thank God you guys are here! Do it now! TRENT: You got to stop him. Let me go! Storm, no! SERGEANT: Storm! SERGEANT: Storm, no! Hold it right there. TRENT: Sergeant, talk to him. Tell him to let me go. Give me the gun. SERGEANT: Give me the gun. Give me the gun. We saw the film. We know you were set up. SERGEANT: Senator, you're under arrest. Cuff him. TRENT: What the hell are you talking about? What are you talking about? You can't do this to me! I'm a senator, for Christ's sake! You can't do this to me! We're sorry, Storm. You're a dead man, Storm! SONNY: Are you all right? ANDY: I love you, Storm. TRENT: I'm the Senator! STORM: How about a nice vacation? OFFICER: This guy is going to be famous. I can hear tomorrow's weather report. "Killer Storm strikes back. " (DUNPHY OVER TV) It shows Trent making a deal with his underworld cronies. (TRENT OVER TV) You'll be very well compensated, Mr. Calabrese. Money now, and lots more when I get in that office.

We're flying. - We're going to the jungle. - <i>Amy want green drop drink.</i> <i>Amy want green drop drink.</i> All right. You'd swear they were married. The "killer ape" is politically incorrect, but that's not to say it's untrue. - I can't believe what I'm hearing. - Clichés usually contain some truth. - Are you serving that ape a martini? - She's allowed one. It'll calm her down. In my life I have heard many a bizarre story - - containing bizarre truth. - I'm sorry I called you ugly. If I didn't. - I know, it was for Amy's benefit. Can I ask you something? Why teach an ape to talk? Why teach anything to anyone? It doesn't make you rich or get you girls. Why did Prometheus steal fire only to give it away? One face of the inherent generosity in the human spirit is the teacher. I repeat, why teach an ape to talk? - No practical reason. - Then why did you do it? "A lonely impulse of delight." - William Butler Yeats. - Very good. Did it work? You're not lonely anymore? Why are you going to Africa? To find something I lost. - Watch your step. - Dr. Ross! Eddie Ventro. Mr. Travis asked me to meet the plane, set up your expedition. - Hers? She's just along for the ride. - Whatever. Be an asshole. - Who is this guy? - Ventro, transportation and equipment. But I don't supply assholes with new personalities. Let's see your new plane. You want to sell that gorilla? It's worth a lot of money. - How much? I'm just curious. - 20-25 grand for a female. - <i>Amy want to go home.</i> - I'm taking you home. Whoa, a talking gorilla! I can feel the money hairs on the back of my neck. Mr. Travis told me to load you up. You know how to use all this stuff? - Do you really need a balloon? - No, let me see that. - Who are they? - Hi, fellas! The fuck if I know. We're on our third government in two years. - So you're our guide? - No, you've got Monroe Kelly. - Is he good? - Very good, and very late. Now what? Why do I feel like this airport's just gone to shit? - Give me your passports. - Our guide is Robertson Reynolds. Yeah, I fired him. Robertson Reynolds is a bird-watcher. The Kigani have had it with Zaire and they're eating people. You go in with Reynolds, you come out somebody's bowel movement. Wasn't that easier than customs? Monroe. We need to switch airports. Bomb in the president's car. - It was his car? Did they get him? - That's the bad news. No, they didn't. - I hope you folks have lots of money. - We do. Thank you. Now run away. Get in the back. Leave the equipment to Eddie. I would hurry. - Is this normal? - You're on your own, Eddie. - Where do you want me to set you up? - Get a DC-3. The strip near Kegoma. First the Kigani in Zaire, now this godfather stuff. Not a good day. - Lower the flaps. - Good luck! I'm getting out of here. - What's going on? - Are we safe? It's all right, just a few bumps. Amy, leave that man alone. Amy, don't inhale. Karen Ross? Monroe Kelly. I'm your great white hunter for this trip. - Though I happen to be black. - How bad is this news for us? Whenever leadership comes into question, they tend to murder everyone. - Oh, my God! - They live to settle scores. And they've got a lot of scores to settle. It's like in the Congo. Things are pretty bad in the Congo. The Kigani are pissed off. Can't blame them. The 20th century sucks. Maybe the 21st will be better. - Are you a criminal? - Aren't we all? I'm not a criminal, I'm a scientist. I run a few guns, you sons of bitches ruin the world. - We shouldn't be involved with them. - What would you suggest? As soon as we can, we should go our own way. Don't I know you? Perhaps. I travel a great deal. - What are you doing with that gorilla? - Taking her back home to the Congo. Taking her back to the farm now that she's seen Paree? And this is your cover? Pretty good. Or, it would have been. - I'm nobody's cover. - You find yourself in the middle. - Cover for what? - I don't know, and she won't tell you. But the money her company is throwing around isn't for a gorilla. Relax. You're in better hands then you should be. No one can go to Zaire. The border is shut. There is a revolt. - It's not my fault. Where's my gorilla? - She'll be kept on the truck. - Isn't this a hospital? - This one's decided to speak. - This is pure Kafka. - Who is Kafka? Tell me! - Monroe. - Captain Wanta. How are you? Miss Ross, such a pleasure. Have some coffee and cake. Have some! You have our visas. This is a scientific mission. You have no right to detain us. Liar, liar, pants on fire. So says my computer, Miss Ross. You used to work for the CIA. Now you're TraviCom. - They pay better? - You have a big mouth. Everybody says that about me. What can I do? - Monroe, you have terrible timing. - Tell me about it. They blew up the president's Mercedes. Our country will be in shit for a year. - Captain, I need that truck. - And ten good men to the border. More. Mr. Homolka? Stop eating my sesame cake. Stop eating my sesame cake! What are you doing in my country, you bag of shit? Captain, please. I only wish to explore and discover. This fellow is a big bag of shit. Shake this rat from off your neck. He owes money to everybody. I will ask you to wait outside. I like that, Miss Ross. You surprise him. So, I put this away. Don't want nobody peeking. It's the gorilla that will get you across the border safely. Everyone's afraid of being seen in an American movie being cruel to gorillas. This is the crazy world we live in. Okay, you can go. Hit the road, as they say. And have a nice day. Are you all right? Admit it, you're glad to see me. - Kahega! - Monroe! Kikuyu tribesman, very nice guy. - Are we in Zaire? - Tanzania. Stay close to me. Amy, come on. - I think this is at my expense. - You're right. - When will we get to the rainforest? - Herkermer Homolka, right? You're not looking for Solomon's city again, are you? Mr. Homolka was part of a disastrous expedition five years ago. They were looking for a city called Zinj, but it doesn't exist. - It does exist! - Three members died from exposure. - A fourth was somehow shot. - It was an appalling suicide. Mr. Homolka had to be carried out of the jungle by me. - I knew he wasn't a philanthropist. - He <i>has</i> done good, mostly for himself. - Shut up, you filthy. - Filthy what? Forgive me. All that traveling has left me. shaken. Think nothing of it. All aboard! - What's all this stuff? - Courtesy of Eddie Ventro. A customs guy hit me in the head with a can of peanut oil for stamping visas. I'm never going back to that country. You got everything but the balloon and the home entertainment center. Your boss says "Call me". You have 11 good guys, significant firepower and significant technology. Good luck. Bye, Monroe. - May I? - There's one thing I don't understand. - If the border's shut, how do we cross? - Luck. - What's going on? - What the hell is that? Shit. I thought we'd get farther. I'd put her out now. - Who's firing on us? - We're violating Zaire's airspace. She likes bananas? Eat this, darling. She's going to feel great. Something to keep her calm. Gorilla Prozac. - Can we make it to Bondo? - We're done. - What are you doing? - Step aside, please. Miss Ross. Here. - Why are they putting on parachutes? - Figure it out. - This won't work. - I'll take Amy. - She might get hurt. I can't risk it. - You know how to fly this plane? The pilot and co-pilot are already gone. Push me, please. Harder, please. You want me to push you too? See you down there. - Where's Amy? - Sleeping. She woke up coming down. - That lady has some set of teeth. - We have to call this off. - I'm not James Bond. - I'll take care of you. I don't want you to take care of me. I'm taking a safari into the Virunga region of the Congo. If you don't want to go, go wherever. But this is a dangerous place, and people die here very easily. Now, excuse me. Amy? Amy? Such an extraordinary animal. Those paintings. Do you think she was drawing something from real life? - I think she was drawing home. - What about those oval shapes? - Just a shape she likes. - Perhaps. - Video game? - It gives latitude and longitude. - More than that, from the look of it. - Well, it's a gadget. It has features. - You found some<i>one</i> or some<i>thing?</i> - A little bit of both. - Why did you quit the CIA? - I never worked for the CIA. Of course not. But if you had, why would you quit? Because they're a loveless bunch of sons of bitches, and I'm not. Glad to hear it. - Okay, here we go. - Fabulous equipment. - I have air-conditioning, too. - Air-conditioners? - I suppose it is a bit much. - Shit, I'll take one. Mr. Homolka. - Please, call me Herkermer. - All right. You can call me Mr. Kelly. - I wonder what she's about. - What do you mean? What you're after, I've got figured. What she's after, I don't know. I'll get you! I'm helping that young scientist return his ward to the wild. He says the ape may be able to tell us the thoughts of the wild gorillas. You're looking for King Solomon's diamonds. The lost city of Zinj. - I've given it up. - Never. The problem is, it doesn't exist. Solomon must have got his diamonds from Cartier, like everybody else. You like that, don't you? Time for Madam Amy's vitamins. This is Karen Ross. 81452. That is KR81452. <i>Travis, do you read? Karen Ross,</i> <i>81452. Houston, Travis, do you read?</i> I read and see you. Congratulations on crossing the border. - <i>I have a signal from the power pack.</i> - Good. Find the laser, you find Charles. Let's hope so. Tomorrow we enter the rainforest. <i>Karen, I've had those images</i> <i>of the creature analyzed.</i> - What is it? - <i>It's something new, but gorilla-like.</i> - Are you sufficiently armed? - <i>Yes.</i> The bad news is geo-thermal. You've got to hurry. The region in the Virungas is bad. The volcanic activity - - <i>is breaking out of the graph. It'll blow.</i> <i>Could be a week, could be sooner.</i> - Watch out! - No, dammit! Not again! I'm terribly sorry. It's destroyed. It's completely destroyed. - What is that? - Full moon. Colobus monkeys. - That's monkeys? - Mating season. When there's a moon like that, every monkey for 200 miles thinks he's Elvis. It's Amy's medical supplies. They can't get wet. - Shit! Somebody help me. - What is it? - There's a creature on my. Look. - That's a leech. - Take it off. - It's your leech, you take it off. - Need some help? - Here, burn it off with this. This is disgusting. Thank you for your compassion. Here. - Monroe. - Don't indicate you see them. Mizumu. The ghost tribe. There are probably 20 of them. - I only see two. Are they friendly? - They're sensitive. Forest people. - Why are they laughing? - I told them I was in charge. - What's so funny about that? - I'm black. I should carry luggage. He says there's a dead white man with a symbol on his clothes. Did they say he's dead? - What does "TC" mean? - TraviCom. The company I work for. They have many levels of "dead". You aren't dead till you're completely dead. They haven't moved him. They believe his soul has left his body. If they move him, his soul will be lost. They're asking his soul to come back. Where is the man? It's not him, it's Bob Driscoll. What happened? Bob? - Who is this man? - He was on TraviCom's last expedition. - What happened to him? - I don't know. Bob? He's dead. - That region is uninhabited. - Well, something inhabits it. We saw the camp destroyed. People dead. A grey gorilla or something. Two men are missing. Jeffrey Weems and Charles Travis, my fiancé. - My <i>former</i> fiancé. - We'd better get to him, then. Beautiful boats. Money's a wonderful thing. - Give her the banana with the dope? - Yes, he gave it to her. I know. Shitty Peter. Hey, what's this? <i>All the leaves are brown</i> <i>and the sky is grey</i> <i>I went for a walk</i> <i>on a winter's day</i> <i>I'd be safe and warm</i> <i>if I was in LA</i> <i>California dreamin'</i> <i>on such a winter's day.</i> - What is this Zinj, Mr. Homolka? - I don't know what you're talking about. It's believed that King Solomon had a diamond mine in a city called Zinj. Diamonds? I suppose there's no point in playing stupid. We shall arrive there together, we shall all be rich. That's fine with me. But there's no Zinj. Half the safaris never made it back, the other half came back with nothing. Yes, but we have a trumping card that they did not have. - We do? - We do. That gorilla. - She knows where it is. - The gorilla? As a young man, I found a book in Soviet Georgia. It contained a detailed drawing of the city of Zinj. The drawing contained a peculiar decoration. An open eye. Later, on safari, I found this. It's the same symbol. Look at this. The gorilla drew this. It is the same image. It is the open eye. That gorilla has seen the city of Zinj. - And she will take us there! - Have you taken your medication? Have your laugh, and I will have mine. Shit. - What is it? - The signal stopped. - Does that mean? - It just means the signal stopped. I don't know what it means. No problem. Oh, my God! - Shoot it! - Amy! Head for shore! - How is he? - It's just a big cut. I'll stitch it up. - What's that? - A plane. Good luck to them. The Zaire Air Force has got a piece of their ass. Pitch camp. Tomorrow, Mt. Mukenko. She's excited. She was born someplace on the other side of this mountain. Wow, it's beautiful. Is this your valley, Amy? It is, isn't it? That's your home. Pretty jungle, that's right. - What's she doing? - Yearning for the place in her heart. - The place in <i>your</i> heart, Herkermer. - You may call me Mr. Homolka. Come on, Amy, let's go. - We've lost two porters. Ran away. - And they didn't invite me? You want your glove? All right, sit still. This is a fork in the road. We can go left or right. - The wrong way loses us a few days. - We must follow the gorilla. - That would be left. - My last coordinates lead this way. - That would be right. - <i>Amy, Peter, go this way.</i> Well, I don't have her passion. I'll follow the gorilla. This doesn't seem like the right way to me. Good Lord. - It's that plane we saw burning. - Who were they? Travis must have sent another expedition. Looks like a rocket got them. There's no point going in there. - My God, what a waste of life. - We'd better keep moving. - Don't move. If you run. - He'll chase me. I read the books. - You did good. - Where did you go? I ran away. Sorry. - He looked right into my eyes. - He's a silverback. I never thought you could just walk along and see them. Amy. <i>Hello. I'm Amy.</i> <i>Good, good, good. Amy.</i> Let's take this off. - She doesn't really belong anywhere. - No, she belongs here. - What the hell is that? - Perimeter alarm around their camp. But where's the camp, and their equipment? I don't understand it. There had to be 300 pounds of equipment. And there's no sign of the bodies. - It's a dead end? - Maybe, maybe not. Bingo! - Son of a bitch! - What is this? It is the city of Zinj that I have looked for all my life. See, the eyes. It is the same. Kahega, guns up. Stay alert. Come here, Amy. Stay with me. First they found the diamonds, Solomon's men. A diamond mine of incredible bounty. Then they built the city around the mine, so that it should be protected. The savagery of the guards was legendary. They instantly fell upon any thief, any transgressor. The diamonds flowed to the kingdom of Solomon. - Why did the city die? - Maybe the mines ran dry. No, the diamonds are here! - Monroe, over here! - What is it? I found this. Don't go in there. I'll go. Don't be so John Wayne, you could get killed. I'm not going in there alone, either. - I must go. - I'll just stay out here with Amy. Not alone you won't. Kahega! Stay close together. Homolka. The same hieroglyphics, over and over. What do they mean? Amy, don't wander off! - Do you speak English? - Yes. - What's your name? - Claude. That's an unusual name for somebody from. Where are you from? - Mombasa. - It's an unusual name for Mombasa. - Have you ever been to Mombasa? - No. Then what do you know about it? I want to go home. Amy? Amy, come here. Where are you, girl? Come on, I'm not fooling around. Amy. Come here, girl. Charles! Charlie! - What are those holes? - Lava tubes. It flows through here. This must lead to the mine. Bring a light. Here. Now here. Come on. Up here. No! - That's not going anywhere. - Where can they be? What happened? - Let's get out of here while we still can. - <i>Help me!</i> - What's that? - Richard! Help me! Help me! - Richard! - Let me go! Let me go! Oh, my God! Something. - Richard. - No, let's get out of here. It's okay. They're some kind of gorillas. I never saw an animal move like that. They just kill. That's why the diamonds were never found. The killer ape myth is true. <i>Bad gorillas.</i> Let me turn your volume down. Here's your lovey. - It's okay. - <i>Mother. Mother.</i> Yes, you're okay now. - See anything? - No, but I'm the last line of defense. Sensor-operated machine pistols are set up, if anything comes within 40 ft. You really know how to pack. - I don't see anything. - Put that out. They're testing their perimeter. - Are they intelligent? - Yes, but they shouldn't be aggressive. They're too damn smart. They're out there, but what are they doing? Monroe! Get down! - They're gone. - We're out of here at first light. I have translated those hieroglyphics we saw inscribed everywhere. - What do they say? - "We are watching you." Where are the bodies? - Have you seen Amy? She's gone. - Along with two porters and Homolka. - I'm going to find her. - People come first, then gorillas. We'll retrieve our comrades, then we'll retrieve your missing gorilla. Mount up! Peter, take this. I don't care if you don't like guns. - Here it is. They domesticated gorillas. - Domesticated? They're killing a man. They bred them to violence. They looked for the trait and encouraged it. Guard dogs who turned on their masters. What's that smell? These are the bones of gorillas. Of normal gorillas. - This one's skull was crushed. - Feel that? - Everybody okay? - Yeah, let's go. Don't go this way. It's all caved in. - I was trying to find the mines. - Be quiet. Got any flares, Kahega? - What's making my eyes burn? - Sulfur fumes. - What the hell. - It's the mines! "We are watching you." It's the trainers talking. The teacher is watching you. Dead teachers. Look. Yes, yes, yes. I knew it was true! The city of Zinj, the diamonds. Every word of it was absolutely true. I'd leave those alone. - Any other way out of here? - Not that I've noticed. Help me. Fill up everything. - You've got to get me out of here! - Take a number. - But we're going to be rich! - Is that a way out? - Let's go. - Stay close together. - What is it? - It's a geode. A giant diamond. - They cut him off. Kahega! - Check if there's a way out back there. Jeffrey. Charlie! - It's him? - It's him. Come on. - Is there a way out back there? - No, nothing. - We're almost out of rounds. - Buy me two minutes. <i>Ugly gorillas. Go away.</i> They don't know what to make of it. - Amy. - <i>Mother. Mother.</i> - <i>Peter hug Amy.</i> - Maternal instinct, long may she reign. - What are you doing? - We're getting out of here. They're going on the endangered species list. Come on, Monroe. Move! - What the hell is that? - The latest thing in communication. Come on. Go, Amy! Keep going! - Where are they? - I don't know. Hang on! Watch out! - Go, Amy! - Hurry! - Amy, come on! - You can do it! - Keep moving. - Head for higher ground. Get the yellow case from that plane. It's a balloon. I'll get the transmitter. Amy! - How close is the border? - Not far. KR 81452. Houston, Travis, do you read? <i>KR 81452.</i> <i>Houston, Travis, do you read?</i> KR 81452. Houston, Travis, do you read? Karen, I thought I'd lost you. I sent another expedition. - <i>Did you get it?</i> - I have bad news. Charles was killed. Did you get the diamond? Did you? - <i>Yes.</i> - Good girl. Do you remember I said that if you sent me here - - for some diamond, and not for Charlie, I'd make you sorry? <i>Karen, of course I'm upset.</i> - <i>But what's done is done. I could.</i> - I know. You need a new cash machine. <i>What'll happen to the satellite if I put</i> <i>its phone number in the laser and fire?</i> The transmitter chip has the satellite's number. <i>It's a 12,000 channel chip. If you</i> <i>put it through the diamond. Karen!</i> This is for you, Charlie. Amy! There you are. Amy, you saved me. It's okay. Thank you. I love you, too. Mother? Oh, I see. It's Africa. It's your mother. Amy, where did you go? Good gorillas? What good gorillas? Handsome fella. Amy. - Look at that. - Is that Amy with the. The silverback. So she's. I see. I see. She's home. - Will she be all right? - <i>They</i> know what to do. - We've got to go. - Bye, Amy. Peter, would you do me a favor? Throw this away for me. You sure? Ouch. - There's a wind. - I hope it blows us someplace good. English subtitles: IFT A/S Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? - Dad. - Yeah? He does this every time we go on a trip. - What? - Tries to annoy me. I was just asking a question. The same question over and over. Hey, remember the song Gram taught us? I do. Dad. - Oh, there you are. - Hello, Amelia. - Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. - Hey, Mom. Hey, Gramps. Mary, Tom. How are you? Oh, it's so nice to see you. - So how was the drive? - Great. We sang your song. You call that singing? Mom and Dad liked it. Mom and Dad were being polite. Like when they say you're witty? Amelia is very witty. So, what are you kids up for? Let's go exploring. The boy's got spirit. The boy's a loose cannon. That's because he acts before he thinks. Hey, I'm only 7. So where should we play? How about up in the attic? - No way. - Amelia's afraid of heights. It's dusty up there. - They could go explore outside. - Yeah. Let's climb trees. Oh, I forgot. Amelia's afraid of heights. Maybe you could help her overcome her fear. And, Amelia, you could teach Jack not to just barrel into things. Whatever you decide, be careful. And, Jack. Listen to your sister. - That will be a first. - Come on. No. No. - Tom. - They're ready, Mary. I was even younger. They'll be fine, dear. Look at all this stuff. Must have taken years to collect. Check this out. I am all-powerful. Well, I'm a magical princess. You will obey my commands. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. And if you don't, I'll sic a nasty mummy after you. Bring him on. Because I'm a big, bad voodoo daddy. Jack. Amelia, look. - Come on. - Jack. It's a schooner. You can tell by the two masts. Jack, we have to go back. Schooners are really fast ships. They were usually sailed by-- Pirates. Is me sweet sailing vessel shipshape and seaworthy? Come on, we gotta hide. Quick, in that barrel. Gaptooth, has me beauty been scraped and cleaned? Clean as a whistle, captain. Scrape it clean, washing machine. Cookie, did you replace that worn-out plank? All set, captain. Plumpy tank gonna break the plank. Bring me cracker barrel aboard. Yummy crackers. Settle down there, Sea Biscuit. What do they make these crackers out of? Lead flour? Deck swabbed, supplies loaded and battened down, sir. Excellent, me hearty. Hey. Buckethead. Blasted bilge rat, where are you? Yes, sir. Weigh anchor, and set sail. Yes, sir. Bird brain. Bird brain. Now, now, Sea Biscuit. We ain't all born with natural smarts. Sails patched and riggings tight. Hoist the Jolly Roger. Aye, aye, captain. Heave-ho, mateys. Hard biscuits packed, and I just whipped up a batch of your favourite. Don't mind if I do. Yummy cookies, yummy cookies. Blasted bird, quit your squawking. Those cookies sure smell good. Why don't you ask the captain if you can have one? Okay. There ain't nothing like sailing the high seas. Sea Biscuit want a cracker. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Gee, you think? You didn't have to follow me. Dad told me to do what you said. Nice birdie. Monkeys in the barrel. Quiet, bird. Let me enjoy the view. Kids cracking the crackers. Stowaways sitting on our stash. What? Stowaways? In me cracker barrel? Scurvy dogs. After them. Amelia, this way. I can't. On second thought. Look. There's something out there. It's big. It's scary. We've gotta warn the pirates. If they catch us, we'll be chopped like a salad. If we don't, we'll be sleeping with the fish. Hey, pirates. Look. In the water. Ahoy. Thar she blows. Wow, what a beauty. - Fire. - No. I just patched that sail. Amelia, do something. Can't we have a sing-along another time? Wow, you're good. Amelia, he likes it. Hold your fire. Gotcha, you rascal. Keep singing, lassie. You've tamed the beast. Sing it, sister, sing it. That was some performance. Bravo, me buckos. Do you realise you just made friends with Chumley the legendary giant octopus? Piece of cake. Any time you need help, just let us know. Come on, Jack. Just where do you kids think you're going? Well, to tell you the truth. We're lost. That does pose a problem. And I have a solution. Make them walk the plank. Bootflap, you're a cold one. Feed them to the sharks. I could use some target practise. But they saved the ship. Besides, we could use a couple more deck hands. Pegger, you lazy spud. Any excuse to get out of work. - Not me, I love work. - Me too. No one ever helped me when I was young. I had to do it all myself. It's just not fair. Bootflap, you've got some issues. We'll keep you along until the next port of call. Can I steer the ship and hoist the flag? Listen here, buckos. You'll be swabbing the deck and scrubbing the chum buckets. And mopping me cage. - Aye, aye, captain. - Then it's settled. Welcome aboard. This calls for a party. So is this where the gig's at then? That Captain Gruff, he's hard to figure. Either he's getting soft in his old age. Or he's setting those poor kids up for something really heavy. With that scurvy crew, nobody's safe. Why, they'd blow a man down for a wooden nickel. Are we gonna jam, or what? Now all you groovy cats watching at home feel free to sing along. And get up off of that couch and shake your booty. Get it? Booty. Like pirate treasure.

We're on a mission. We sail the high seas looking for treasure. We're going after treasure? Cool. Is that all you pirates care about? - What do you mean? - I mean, do you ever do a good deed? Do you ever help anyone? Of course we do. We do lots of good stuff. We protect the whales and help clean up the ocean. But we don't advertise it, see. We're pirates. We got an image to keep up, got it? - Got it? - Got it. Righty right then. Hootin' Tootin' Pirates, tallyho. Here it is. The map to the Voodoo treasure. The Voodoo treasure? - Blimey. - Begad. - Sink me. - No way. I've heard rumours it's cursed. We sail southwest then northeast across the equator hang a right at Jupiter Reef and we land here. Skull Island. Skull Island. Shiver me timbers. - Blimey. - Begad. No way. Chart a course, me hearties, destiny awaits us. Oh, gross. Land ho. Bring her in easy, mateys. Big mouth. Bad breath. Shut your blabbering beak. You wanna wake the natives? All right, me mateys. All hands ashore. You kids be too young for looting and hooting. But, Captain Gruff, isn't looting and hooting against the law? Not where I come from, little lassie. Well, it's not nice. Hey, we're pirates. It's what we do. You stay here and keep a lookout. We can't just wait around here. You heard the captain. Jack. We should go back to the ship. There he goes again. Amelia, what if there really is a treasure? I'd buy a bicycle, a skateboard. Eight, nine, 10 paces toward them weird looking stones. Well, shall we dig, captain? Just a wee moment, Mr. Pegger. - Look. - Don't touch that. Blasted stowaways, you woke the bones. After them, my pretties. Run for your lives. It ain't easy to fight the bones. You can't kill them. And you sure don't wanna join them. The Hootin' Tootin' Pirates always fight valiantly and they are fleet of foot. But can they outrun the cursed? Some travelling music, boys. <i>Skeletons rule the island</i> <i>Skeletons run the show</i> <i>Skeletons dancing everywhere</i> <i>Coming at you high and low</i> <i>Banging their bones like a drum</i> <i>Maybe you better run</i> <i>Oh, filling my heart with dread</i> <i>Can't kill them 'Cause they're already dead</i> <i>Run, better run away</i> <i>Got to leave the island</i> <i>Or be here for a permanent stay</i> <i>No, no, no, gotta go, go, go</i> <i>Skeletons rule the island</i> <i>Yeah, skeletons run the show</i> <i>Skeletons dancing everywhere</i> <i>Coming at you high and low</i> <i>Banging their bones like a drum</i> <i>Maybe you better run</i> <i>Filling me heart with dread</i> <i>Can't kill them 'Cause they're already dead</i> <i>Oh, skeletons rule the island</i> <i>Yeah, skeletons run the show</i> <i>Skeletons dancing everywhere</i> <i>Coming at you high and low</i> <i>Banging their bones like a drum</i> <i>Maybe you better run</i> <i>Filling me heart with dread</i> <i>Can't kill them 'Cause they're already dead</i> <i>Yeah, filling me heart with dread</i> <i>Can't kill them 'Cause they're already dead</i> - No, stop. - Help me, please. Well, at least we'll get a last meal. My chubby friend, you are the meal. - What? - Please. - Help. - No way. We're trapped. What should we do? I have an idea. I am the great Jacksonian. Observe my powers. Jack. Obey my commands, or you too will be under my spell. Silly boy, we're already cursed. We're skeletons. And now, my pretties, it's time to say bye-bye. Greetings, young'uns. - Hello. - Hello. Sit down and relax. You're gonna be here a while. - What's a while? - I've been in here 64 years, 200 and 22 days. There's gotta be a way out. There ain't no way out. What's this? Maybe it's a piggy bank. That's just what I was thinking. Jack, do you still have that coin? - Yeah. - Drop it in the slot. - No way. - You wanna get out of here? Easy come, easy go. It worked. - Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. - Let's go. If you're going for treasure, you best beware. There ain't no good come from it. Look where it got me. Now get out of here. Hang in there, old timer. We'll come back for you. Oh, yeah, sure. That's what they all say. Eenie, meenie, minie, mo. I wish I knew which way to go. We're rich. We're rich. We found the treasure, yeah. Jack, this isn't ours. We could just borrow some. I wonder what's in here. Jack, don't. Who dares fiddle with the Voodoo treasure? Why, you rotten kids. Let's get out of here. You're a couple of wise guys, huh? Ring around the rosie. Who you calling Rosie? Why, you rotten kids. Oh, no. Jack, this way. Sorry. Here's looking at you. Come on. After you. Hello, world. We're the Play It Real Rockers. How you doing? For our next tune, we'd like to play a golden oldie. An oldie but a goodie. It tells the story of some greedy Vikings, baby who meet an unhappy fate. It's called, "The Skel-a-tune." <i>Once, a gang of Vikings On a looting spree</i> <i>Set out for treasure On the mighty sea</i> <i>We want treasure</i> <i>Then they found a scroll That showed the way</i> <i>To a secret tropical bay</i> <i>To the Voodoo treasure</i> <i>There where X did mark the spot</i> <i>The Vikings dug a lot</i> <i>We love treasure</i> <i>Down through A secret passageway</i> <i>The greedy Vikings found the way</i> <i>To the Voodoo treasure</i> <i>Skel-a-tune, skel-a-tune</i> <i>Don't touch the treasure It will lead to your doom</i> <i>Skel-a-tune, skel-a-tune</i> <i>Now forever more We're gonna sing this skel-a-tune</i> <i>Now, the Vikings stood On evil ground</i> <i>Where Voodoo Daddy Laid his treasure down</i> <i>It's cursed treasure</i> <i>A drum of magic gelatine</i> <i>Turned the Vikings into skeletons</i> <i>I don't like this treasure</i> <i>Skel-a-tune, skel-a-tune</i> <i>Don't touch the treasure It will lead to your doom</i> <i>Skel-a-tune, skel-a-tune</i> <i>Now forever more We're gonna live in the gloom</i> <i>Skel-a-tune, skel-a-tune</i> <i>Now and forever more We're gonna sing this skel-a-tune</i> <i>So Pirate Island came to be</i> <i>A rocky prison of the sea</i> <i>Doomed forever</i> <i>Cursed to be there evermore</i> <i>On the lost and rocky shore</i> <i>On Pirate Island</i> <i>Skel-a-tune, skel-a-tune</i> <i>Don't touch the treasure It will lead to your doom</i> <i>Skel-a-tune, skel-a-tune</i> <i>Now forever more We're gonna live in the gloom</i> <i>Skel-a-tune, skel-a-tune</i> <i>Now forever more We're gonna sing this skel-a-tune</i> Rockers. Now, that's what I call a show. - Still want that treasure, Jack? - Yeah. Come on. This way. Welcome, children. - Hello. - Who are you? I'm a treasure hunter. At least I used to be. - What happened? - A slight misunderstanding. It could happen to anyone. Even you. Did you say treasure? - Jack, come on. - How do we get the treasure? It's simple. Cross the chasm of no return, avoid the pillars of pain escape from the fire-breathing dragon and you can't miss it. Watch me. What's your problem? You're young, you're strong, you have a body. You can do it. Then we get the treasure? Then you meet Mr. Voodoo, and you answer his riddle. And if we give the wrong answer? You get to hang out with me. But if we give the right answer, we get the treasure, right? That's what they say. Thanks, Mr. Head. Don't mention it. See you soon. Amelia. Come on. - Oh, no. - Oh, no. The chasm of no return. Not good. Not good. Don't look down. One step at a time. No, run, Amelia. Run. I can't do it. I can do it. It's a dragon. Amelia. Gotcha. Where are we? Yo, fool. You're in the lair of the Voodoo Daddy. Welcome, my friends. I'm so happy you've come to play. It's been an eternity since my last guests. But can you pass the final test? Alrighty then, let's get right down to business. Here's how my little game is played. I ask you a riddle. You answer the riddle. You answer correctly, you get a fabulous prize. You answer incorrectly, and I get to shrink your head. Are you ready for your first riddle? Do we have a choice? Go ahead take a spin. Perhaps I'm a key. Or maybe I'm a lock. You have 15 seconds to decide. We'll take the key. - Yay! - Yeah. You've done well, my friends. I'm so happy for you. - Thank you, Mr. Voodoo. - Thank you, Mr. Voodoo. Thanks for playing with me. It was fun, now get out of here. Show's over. Hey, where's our prize? Sorry, fresh out of prizes. Hey, that's not fair. This is my lair, and I say what's fair. Must need a tune-up. We've really enjoyed spending time with you, Mr. Voodoo, sir. We'll tell all our friends to drop by and play. Really? Do you promise? Yeah. And we'll let everyone know what a nice guy you are. Well. I suppose you could have one prize. You can take home this beautiful magic feather or this stunning gold skeleton key. Well, which prize do you want? We'll take the skeleton key. Use it wisely, for it may open things better left locked. Let's get out of here, Amelia. Don't you wanna stay and play some more? We have to go. I'll miss you, guys. Come back anytime, seriously. I'm not going anywhere. I'm so lonely. What a weirdo. They're cooking the crew. What do we do? We sing for our supper. Do you really have to show off now? Get them. Amelia. Chumley. Oh, what a pretty creature. I wonder how it tastes. Come on. The pirates. - Stop. - Help. - My feet are burning. - Hurry. Amelia, the key. Blimey. That cage is for the birds. Handsomely, mateys. To the ship. But, captain, what about the booty? We know where the treasure is. - Jack. - What? Stealing is wrong. But not if we gives it back to the rightful owners. If we ever comes across them. Really? Do you promise? Cross me heart, me hearty. Jack, give me the key. Follow us. Blimey. Let's get out of here. You. You tomb wreckers. Mommy, help me. Nice to see young'uns treating their elders with respect. Now let's hightail it out of here. Our dinner. It's getting away. Me name's Poppie. I may be old, but I'm tough as nails. Aye, welcome aboard, old salty. Weigh anchor. Heave-ho. Oh, sweet Chumley. So long, boneheads. Oh, that's a good one. Sail ho. After them. Shiver me timbers. - Chumley. - Chumley. - Chumley. Come back. - Come back. Young'uns. Get below deck. It ain't safe up here. Cursed creatures. Fire. Break out the big guns. Fire. We're done, captain. No more cannonballs. Get them. We're sunk. Not if I can help it. I'm more of a heavy metal fan. It's the mother of all octopuses. It's Chumley's mother. Bye-bye. Will they be all right? I was swallowed by a whale once. Made it out too. A whale of a tale. - Thanks, Chumley. - Bye, Chumley. Well, mateys, that was a close one. Make no bones about it. And one more thing needs doing, if you want to be part of me crew. Right-jolly buccaneers gotta climb. Up to the crow's nest. Amelia, you don't have to. Yes, I do. Handsomely, mateys, up you go. Here, let me lend you a hand. Nice and easy. A right-jolly bucko. You're almost there. I've. I've. I've done it. What'd you do? Overcame my fear of heights. - Yes. - All right. What about Jack? He's learning. Yeah. All right. - All right. - All right. Wonderful. Yes. <i>We're the Hootin' Tootin' Pirates We sail the seven seas</i> <i>Searching for treasure Doing good deeds</i> <i>Taking whatever loot we need</i> <i>Doing our bit for the community</i> <i>His name is Buckethead And on a lark</i> <i>He swam with the fishes And kissed a shark</i> <i>Now he wears a bucket To hide his beauty mark</i> <i>I punched holes for eyes So I'm not in the dark</i> <i>His name be Poppie He's old but spry</i> <i>Been down more times Than a cat has lives</i> <i>Even travelled the world With Captain Bligh</i> <i>I got battle scars And a fake glass eye</i> <i>Around these parts She's called Bootflap</i> <i>I picked meself up From me own bootstraps</i> <i>Cookie is here To cook the finest meal</i> <i>I make a mean soup From banana peels</i> <i>You gotta meet our main man Name's Gaptooth</i> <i>He was a mean, tough pirate In his youth</i> <i>Then he met a sailor Who called herself Ruth</i> <i>She tamed me heart I'm telling the truth</i> <i>Please never fear Mr. Pegger is here</i> <i>He lost a leg to piranhas But don't shed a tear</i> <i>'Cause now he has ballet As a second career</i> <i>I'm a pirouetting pirate A true pioneer</i> <i>He's the captain of this pirate ship</i> <i>His name is Gruff And don't give him no lip</i> <i>He travels the world On a dangerous trip</i> <i>Got me bird Sea Biscuit He's the best sidekick</i> <i>From the Caribbean To the Barbary coast</i> <i>Tell you right now We ain't afraid to boast</i> <i>So raise up your grog Let's all have a toast</i> <i>Hootin' Tootin' Pirates Rock the boat</i> <i>We rock the boat</i> I think its our tradition. It comes out of a particularly painful part of our history. Yes. Yes. But it's been a way we've been able to heal. At first it was a reminder of the rebellion It was the price the Districts had to pay. But I think it has grown from that. I think its a. Its something that nets us all together. This is your third year's game? What defines your personal signature? Shhhh. It's okay. It's okay. You're just dreaming. You're dreaming. I know. I know what its like. It's your first. Prim, your name's gonna be there once, they're not gonna pick you! Try to go to sleep. I can't. Just try. Just try. Deep in the meadow. Under the willow. Hop in the grass. A soft green and pillow. You remember that song? Ok. You finish it. I gotta go. Where? I just gotta go. But I'll be back. I love you. I'll still cook you. What're you gonna do with that when you kill it? Damn you, Gale! It's not funny. What're you gonna do with a 100 pound deer, Katnip? It's Reaping Day, the place is crawling with Peacekeepers. I was gonna sell it. From kisskeepers.. Of course you were. Like you don't sell the Peacekeepers. No! Not today. It's the first deer I've seen in a year. Now, I have nothing. Okay. What if they did? Just one you. Why if everyone just stop watching? They won't, Gale. What if they did? What if we did? Won't happen. You root for your favorite, you cry when they get killed. It's sick. Gale. If no one watches. Then they don't have a game. It's as simple as that. What? Nothing. Fine, laught at. I'm not laughing at you. We could do it, you know? Take off. Live in the woods. What we do anyway? They'd catch us. Maybe not. Cut out our tongues or worse. We wouldn't make it five miles. No, I get five miles. We'll go that way. I have Prim. You have your brothers. They can come too. Prim in the woods? Maybe not. I'm never having kids. Not might. If I don't live here. But you do live here. I know, but if I didn't. Oh, I forgot. Here. Oh my God! Is this real? Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel.

And as long as you have it. Nothing bad will happen to you. Okay? I promise. Shh. Shh. Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh. Okay, it's time to send her now. Okay, they will prick your finger to take just a little bit of blood. I'm scared. Prim, it doesn't hurt much. Just a little. Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids. I'll find you after okay? Next. Next. Go ahead. Next. Next. Next. Next. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Happy Hunger Games. And. May the odds be ever in your favor. Now, before we begin. We have a very special film. Brought to you all the way from the Capitol. War. Terrible war. With those. Orphan. and motherless child. This was the uprising that brought our land. 13 Districts rebel against the country that fed them. Protected them. Then came the peace. Hard fought. Solely won. The people. Rose up from the ashes and a new era was born. The freedom has a cost. And the traitors was defeated. Peace-War as a nation. We would never know this treason again. And so, it was decreed. That each year. The various districts of Panem would offer up in tribute. One young man and woman. To fight to the death. And it peg you to honor, courage and sacrifice. The lone victor. Bathe in riches. Will serve as our reminder of our generosity. .. and our forgiveness. This is how we remember our past. This is how we safe guard our future. I just love that. Now, the time has come to select one courageous young man and woman. For the honor of representing District 12 in the 74th Annual Hunger Games. As usual ladies first. Primrose Everdeen! Where are you? Come on up. Well, come on up! Prim! Prim! No! I volunteer! I volunteer as Tribute. I believe we have a volunteer. - You need to get out of here. - No! - Go find mom! - No! - Prim, go find mom! - No! I'm so sorry! No! Noo! Noo! Nooo! Noooo! In mad of turn of events here on District 12. District 12's very first volunteer. Big breath. Come on dear. What's your name? Katniss Everdeen. Well, I bet my hat that was your sister. Wasn't it? Yes. Let's have a big hand for our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen. And now for the boys. Peeta Mellark. Here we are. Our Tributes from District 12. Well, go on you two. Shake hands. Happy Hunger Games. And be the odds be ever in your favor. You have 3 minutes. Prim, Prim, its okay. Shh. Prim, I don't have much time. Prim, listen. You're gonna be okay. Don't take any extra food for money. That doesn't worth putting your name in more times, okay? Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game. He stuck cheese from your coat. Just try to win. Maybe you can. Maybe I can, I am smart you know? You can hunt. Exactly. It's to protect you. Thank you. You can't turn out again. I won't No, you can't. Not like when dad died. I won't be here anymore. Your all she has. No matter what you feel, you will be there for her. You understand? Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't. It's time. It's okay. Prim, it's okay. No! No! I promise Prim. I'm fine. You don't know. I am. Listen to me. You're stronger than they are. You are. Get to a bow. What will if you show them how good you are? They just want a good show. That's all they want. If they don't have a bow, then you make one. Okay? You know how to hunt. They're not animals. It's no different Katniss. There's 24 of us Gale and only one comes out. Yeah. And it's gonna be you. Okay. Take care of them Gale. Whatever you do, don't let them starve. Let's go! I'll see you soon okay? You two haven't had trip? Crystal chandeliers. Platinum donuts. 200 miles per hour and you can barely feel a thing. I think its rather a wonderful thing is about this opportunity. That even though you're here and even though it's just for a little while. You get to enjoy all of this. I'm going to find Haymitch. He's probably in the back car. You even met him? Haymitch? You know, Katniss, he is our mentor. He did witness things once. Look! You know if you don't want to talk, I understand. But I just don't think there's anything wrong of getting a little bit of help. Congratulations. Where's the ice? I don't. I don't know. Okay, so uh so when do we start? Whoah. Why so eager? Most of you are in such a hurry. Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is. You're our mentor, you're supposed to go. Encore. Yeah. Our mentor is supposed to tell us how to get sponsors and give us advice. Oh, okay. Ummm. Embrace the probability of your immanent death. I know. Can your heart. that there's nothing I can do to save you. So why are you here then? The refreshments. Okay, I think that's enough. You made me spill my drink. Over my new pants. You know. I think I'll go finish this in my room. I shouldn't have come around. What? It's no use. I'm gonna go talk to him. We have two. 16 year olds. Yes. Do you remember this year? Aww. One of my favorite years. And one of my favorite arenas. The use of the rubble, the ruin city. Very exciting. From this moment here this moment. .. is the moment that you never forget. The moment when a Tribute becomes a victor. You'd freeze to death first. Because I didn't light a fire. Now that's a good way to get killed. What's a good way to get killed? Oh! Joy. Why don't you join us? I'm just saving a life-saving advice. Like what? I wa. I was just asking bout how to find shelter. Which would come in handy if in fact you are still alive. How do you find shelter? Pass the jam. How do you find shelter? Give me a chance to wake up sweetheart. This mentoring is very tax and stuff. Can you pass the marmalade? That is mahogany. Look at you! Just killed a. place mat! You really wanna know how to stay alive? You get people to like you. Oh! Not what you're expecting. When you're in the middle of the games and you're starving or freezing, some water, a knife or even some matches can mean the difference between life and death. And those things only comes from Sponsors. And to get Sponsors, you have to make people like you. And right now, sweetheart? You're not off to a really good start. There it is. It's huge. That's incredible. Come on. Better keep this knife. He knows what he's doing. So now that you've seen what do you think of this years cropful troops? Are there any surprises that we can expect this year? It's really hard to tell from a Reaping but I think this is a very interesting mix. Yes. Whenever you have a volunteer from an outline district, it's something you can't ignore. What's that? What's that? We were just saying we might need to hose you down again before we take you to Cinna. That was all the bravest thing I've ever seen. I am Cinna. Katniss. I'm sorry that this happened to you. And I'm here to help you in any way I can. Most people just congratulate me. I don't see the point in that. Thank you girl. What's this? That's a. Mocking Jay. How much? You keep it. It's yours. Thank you. So tonight they have the Tribute Parade. Let me take you out and show you after the wurl. So you're here to make me look pretty. I'm here to help you make an impression. Now usually, they dress people in their close to their district. Yeah. We're called minors. Yeah. But I don't want to do that. I'm gonna do something that they're gonna remember. Did they explain about trying to get sponsors? Yeah, but I'm not very good at making friends. We'll see. I just think, somebody that brave shouldn't be dressed up on some stupid costume as should they. I hope not. It's not real fire. These suits are built so you won't feel a thing. That's better on me. The idea. You ready? Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Over one hundred thousand people, craning to get a glimpse this year's Tributes and the Sponsors get to see the Tributes for the first time. The importance of this moment cannot be over stated. They're nice. First cheered on my counting in 15 14. 13. Here they are. Here they are. This year's Tributes. The most exciting run it just gives you goosebumps. Don't you love, how the stylist they so clearly are able to reflect the character of each district. There's District 4! Fishing. I get it. I like it. That's very good. And behind them. .. we have two power plant workers. And then what is that in the background? Come on. They'll love it. Now see that? I love that. Two young people, holding their hands up! Saying, "I'm proud, I'm from District 12! We will not be overlooked!" I love that. We're gonna sure we'll be paying attention to them right now! And we're ready. President Snow, you're live! Welcome. Welcome. Tributes. We welcome you. We salute the courage and your sacrifice. And we wish you happy Hunger Games. And may the odds be ever in your favor. That was amazing. Oh, we are anybody's going be talking about. So brave. Are you sure you're spinning up a new flame? Fake flame? Are you sure? That's uh let's go upstairs. So each of the districts got their own floor and because you're from 12, you get the penthouse. Come on. So this is the living room. I know! Now, your rooms are right over here. Why don't you go clean yourselves up a little before dinner. In two weeks 23 of you will be dead. One of you will be alive. Who that is depends on how well you pay attention over the next four days. Particularly to what I'm about to say. First. No fighting with the other Tributes. You'll have plenty of time for that in the arena. There are four compulsory exercises, the rest will be individual training. My advice is. Don't ignore the survival skills. Everybody wants to grab a sword but most of you wil die from natural causes. 10% from infection. 20% from dehydration. Exposure can kill as easily as a knife. Where's my knife? Where did you put it? I put my knife. Don't touch me. Fuck! You took my knife! I didn't touch your knife. I didn't touch your kni. You liar. You little punk! You took my knife. Get off me. Just sit here. I should better wait for the arena. You're the first one I get so watch your back huh! Everybody back in line. You know you're next to me Cato! Busy career. You know what that is? From District 1. .and 2. They've been trying to be in a special academy till they're 18 and they volunteer. By that point they're pretty lethal. But they don't receive any special treatment. In fact, they're staying at the exact same apartment as you do. And I don't think left them out for dessert and you can. So how good all that? Obviously, they're pretty good. They won in almost several year but. Almost. They can be arrogant. And arrogance can be a big problem. I hear you can shoot.. I'm alright. Actually, better than alright. I fed her by the squirrels. He say she hits em right in the eye, everytime. - Peeta's strong. - What? He can throw a 100 pound sack of flour right in his head. I've seen it. Okay, well I cannot kill anybody by a sack of flour. No, you might have a better chance at winning when somebody comes after you with a knife. I have no chance of winning. None! Alright? It's true. Everybody knows it. You know what my mother said? She said, "District 12 might finally have a winner!" But she wasn't talking about me. She was talking about you. I'm not very hungry. I'm done too. Throw that metal thing over there. What? No. Haymitch says we're not supposed to show. I don't care what Haymitch said. Those guys are looking at you like you're a meal. Throw it. Hi. Hey. How did you do that? I uh. I used to take care of the cakes down at the bakery. I'll show you. See? Wow. Yeah. I think you have a shadow. Tomorrow. They will bring you in one by one. And evaluate you. This is important because high ratings will mean Sponsors. This is the time to show them everything. There'll be a bow, make sure you use it. Peeta, you make sure to show your strength. They'll start with District 1 so the two of you will go last. Not on my house to put this. Make sure they remember you! Katniss Everdeen. Hey Katniss. Shoot straight. Katniss Everdeen. District 12. Thank you. For your consideration. Are you crazy? I just got mad. Mad?! You realize that your actions reflect badly on all of us. Not just you. They just want a good show, it's fine. How bout just bad manners Cinna? How bout that? Well, finally! I hope you notice, we have a serious situation. Nice shooting sweetheart! Wha.. Wha. What did they. What did they do when you shot the apple? Well, they look pretty startled. What did you say. "Thanks for. " .consideration. Genius! Genius. How do you think you're gonna find this funny? If the game makers decided to take it out. On who? On her? On him? I think they already have. Loosen your corset and have a drink. I would have given anything to see it. As you know the Tributes are rated on a scale of 1 to 12 after three days of careful evaluation. The game keepers would like to evaluate. From District 1, Marvel. The score of 9. Cato, the score of 10. Clove, the score of 10. Four, score of. From District 7. From District. Rue, the score of 7. From District 12. Peeta Mellark. The score of. 8. Not bad. Bravo. And finally. From District 12. Katniss Everdeen. With the score of eleven. Congratulations. I thought they hated me. They must have like you girl. To Katniss Everdeen. The Girl On Fire! At eleven? She earned it. She shot an arrow at your head. Well, t'was an apple. .near your head. Sit down. Seneca why do you think we have a winner? What do you mean? I mean why do we have a winner? I mean if we just wanted to intimidate the Districts, why not round up 24 of them at random and execute them all at once. Way a lot faster. Hope. Hope? Hope. It is the only thing. stronger than fear. A little hope is effective. A lot of hope is dangerous. It's track is fine.. As long as it's contained. So. So. contain it! Right. If she's staring at all my jewels, she can't take her eye from. Frankly. it was rude. Oh, Haymitch. You should join us. We're having some of your favorite dish. Oh, lovely. Where's Peeta? He's in his room. Now listen. Tomorrow's the last day. When they let us walk with our own Tributes right before the game so you and I will be going down at 9. Well, what about him? No, he says he wants to be trained on his own from now on. What? It's kind of thing does happen at this point if there's only one winner. Right? We should have some chocolate covered stoke. Ladies and gentlemen. Your master of ceremonies. Caesar Flickerman! Thank you! Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. To the 74th Annual Hunger Games. Now, there are five minutes they are all going to be out here. All of the Tributes that you heard about. Are you excited? Let me hear it! Amazing. I don't feel amazing. Don't you know how beautiful you look? No. And I don't know how to make people like me, how do you make people like you? Why do you made me like you? That's different. I wasn't trying. Exactly. Just be yourself. I'll be there the whole time. .and just pretend you're talking to me. Okay? Okay. Let's see if she does indeed shine. Let's have a warm round of applause for Glimmer. Glimmer, are you prepared? Yes Caesar, I am prepared. I like it, that's just. Big round of applause. Marvel! Welcome Clove. It's an honor to represent my district. So you're a fighter? I'm prepared, vicious and I'm ready to go. Cato! From District 12. You know her as the girl on fire! Where we know it's Katniss Everdeen! What? I think someone's a little nervous. I said that was quite and entrance that you've made at the Tribute's Parade the other day. Do you want to tell us about it? Well, I was just hoping that I wouldn't burned it up! When you came out of that chariot. I have to say. My heart. stopped. To earn you experiences as well. My heart stopped. So did mine. Now tell me bout the flames. are they real? Yes. In fact I'm wearing them today. Would you like to see? Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe? What do you think folks? I think that's a yes! That was really something. Katniss, that was something. Thank you for that. I have one more question for you. It's about your sister. We are all very moved, I think when you volunteered for her at the Reaping. Does she come to say goodbye to you. Yes. She did. And what did you say to her? In the end? I told her that I would try to win. That I will try to win for her. Of course you did. And try you will. Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12, Katniss Everdeen, The Girl On Fire! You did it darling. That was incredible. Thank you. Nice job sweetheart. Thank you. Nice dress too. Are yours? Peeta Mellark! Peeta, welcome. How are you finding the Capitol? Don't say with a map. Uh, it's uh. different. It's very different. Different? In what are? Give us an example. Uh okay, well the showers here are weird. Showers? Yes. We have different showers. I have a question for you Caesar. Do I smell like roses to you? Um. Do I? Yeah. Do I smell like it? You definitely smell better than I do. Well I live here longer. So Peeta tell me. Is there a special girl back home? No, not really. No? I don't believe it for a second. Look at that face. Handsome man like you. Peeta. Tell me. Well, there a. There's this one girl that. I had a crush on forever. But I don't think she actually recognize me until the Reaping. Well. I'll tell you what Peeta. You go out there and you win this thing. And when you get home. She'll have to go out with you. Right folks? Thanks but I uh. I don't think winnings gonna help me at all. And why not? Because she came here with me. Well, that's bad luck. Yeah. It is. And I wish you all the best of luck. Thank you. Peeta Mellark. District 12! What the hell is that?! You don't talk to me and you say you have a crush on me? You say you wanna train alone. is that how you wanna play? Stop! Stop it! Start right now. He did you a favor. He made me look weak. He made you look desirable. Which in your case, can't hurt sweetheart! He's right Katniss. Of course, I'm right. Now I can sell the star cross lovers from District 12. We are not star cross lovers. It's a television show. And being in love with that boy might just get you Sponsors which could save your damn life. Okay. why don't you get out of here? Maybe acting to live save you both to one piece tomorrow. Manners. You too? Oh, hey. Can't sleep? No, of course not. I'm sorry I went after you. You know I meant that as a compliment. I know. Listen. Yeah? I just don't wanna change me. So tonight they have the Tribute Parade. Let me take you out and show you after the wurl. So you're here to make me look pretty. I'm here to help you make an impression. Now usually, they dress people in their close to their district. Yeah. We're called minors. Yeah. But I don't want to do that. I'm gonna do something that they're gonna remember. Did they explain about trying to get sponsors? Yeah, but I'm not very good at making friends. We'll see. How did they change you? I don't know. I'm turning to something I'm not. I just don't wanna be another piece in their game, you know? You mean you won't kill anyone? No. I'm not yet sure I would. Just like any by off my time came with. Yeah, I just keep. wishing I could think of a way to show them. That they don't own me. You know, if I'm gonna die. I wanna still be me. Does that make any sense? Yeah. I just can't afford to think like that. I miss my sister. Yeah I know. Guess, I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. They put all kind of stuff right in front. Right in the mouth of the Curnocopia. There'll even be a bow there. Don't go for it. Why not? It's a Bloodbath, they're trying to pull you in. It's not your game. You turn, run, find a high ground. Look for water. Water's your new best friend. Don't step off that pedestal earlier or they'll blow you sky high. I won't. Katniss. You can do this. Thanks. Give me your arm. Give me your arm. Give me your arm. What is that? Your tracker. Less than a minute people! Final checks. So fifteen up, they are flying. Here. Thank you. 30 seconds. I'm not allowed to bet. But if i could I'd bet on you! 20 seconds. 10 seconds. Okay, they're in the tubes. 50 49 48 47. 46 45. 44 43. 42 41. 40 39. 38 37. 36 35. 34 33. 32 31. 30 29. 28 .27. 26 25. 24 23. 22. And of course. There's the familiar boom of the cannon. Which marks the end of another fallen Tribute. Well, that makes 13 gone in the first eight hours. And Claudius, I think I seen alliance forming. Please don't kill me. Oh no! Hey, loverboy! You sure she went this way? Yeah, I'm sure. You better be. Yeah. That was a steer comb back there. Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now? Nah. He's our best chance at finding her. Sir. She is almost at the edge. Two kilometers away from the nearest Tribute. Let's turn her around. Killing another on my account. one. Two. Uh, she's heading towards the left flank. Okay. Sure. She's almost there. Lucia, get a cannon ready. Oh there she is. There she is. What you got baby? Kill here Cato! I'm coming for you! I'll do it myself. Get her! Come on. Come on. Maybe you should throw the sword. Let's just wait her out. She's gonna come down at some points. That's gonne start her there. Okay. Somebody make a fire. Thank you. Pssst. Pssst. Claudius. I think those are trackerjackers. Am I wrong? Oooh. Those things are very lethal. Very. For those of you who don't know. Trackerjackers are genetically engineered wasps. Whose venom causes serious pain. Powerful hallucinations and in extreme cases, death. Run! Run! Run! Damn it. Go! Katniss, no! What're you doing? Go! Hallow isn't lethal. But the venom of a trackerjacker sting is enough to doze off hallucinations. Please do something. Katniss, go! Get out of here! What're you doing? Go! Rue? It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. You want mine too? No, that's okay. Here. Thanks. How long was I asleep? A couple of days. I change your leaves twice. Thank you. So what happened? When I was out? The girl from 1 and the boy from 10. And the uh. And the boy from my district? No, he's okay. I think he's down by the river. Is all about true? What? You and him. So where are Cato and the others? They got all their supplies down by the lake. It's prod up in this great big pyramid. That sounds tempting. Now this green stuff is gonna smoke like crazy, so as soon as you light it. Move on to the next fire. Light this one last. And I'll meet you back over here. Right. I'll destroy their stuff while they're chasing us. We need a signal, in case one of us gets held up. Okay. Like what? Here. Watch this. Mocking jays. That's great. Back home, we used them to signal all the time.. You try. Okay so, if we hear that means we're okay and we'll be back real soon. We're gonna be okay. Hey. I'll see you for supper. Okay. Guys, guys look! Come here. Come on, come on look! Let's go. You stay guard over till we get back. I wanna see if she's gonna figure out this booby trap. Yes. It seems they reburied their mines around that big pile of goodies. She certainly figure it out, haven't she? Katniss! Katniss! Katniss help! Katniss! Help me! Help! Katniss! Katniss! It's okay. You're okay. You're alright. You're fine.. see? It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Did you blow up the food? Every bit of it. Good. You have to win. Okay. Deep in the meadow. Under the willow. A bed of grass. A soft, green pillow. Lay down your head. And close your eyes. Don't kill her. You just create a murder. It seems I've already got one. I heard this rumors out on District 11. This could get away from here. What do you want? There are a lot of anger out there. I know you know how to handle a mod, you've done it before. If you can't scare them. Give them something to root for. Such as? Young love. So you were like an underdog. Everyone likes an underdog. I don't. How many are dead? 10? 11? 12? Uh. Not personally, no! I have. Lots of underdogs. Not too cold too. Row crops. Minerals. Things we need. There are lots of underdogs. And I think if you could see them. You would not root for them either. Unlike you.. Be careful. Attention Tributes. Attention! The regulations required a single victor has been. suspended! From now on, two victors maybe crowned if both originate from the same district. This will be the only announcement. Oh my God! Peeta! Peeta! Hi. It's okay. What was it? The sword. It's badly hurt. It's gonna be fine. Katniss. Katniss. No! I'm not gonna leave you! I'm not gonna do that. Why not? Nobody's gonna find you in here. They already found me. We just get you some medicine. He can't. They don't give so much parachutes. We'll figure something out. Like what? Something. Is that medicine? No! Soup. Nice taste. Do you fed - once? I think about that all the time. How I tossed you that bread. Peeta. I should've gone to you. I should've just gone out to the rain. You feel hot. I remember the first time I saw you. Your hair was in two braids instead of one. I remember when you. You sang in music as simply the teacher said. Who knows the pie song in your head shut straight up! After that. I watched you going home everyday. Everyday. Well, say something. I'm not gonna say something. You can come here. Please. If I don't even make it. Attention Tributes. Attention! Commencing Insuberance. There will be a feast tomorrow at the Curnocopia. This will be no ordinary occasion. Each of you needs something. Desperately. And we planned to be generous hosts. You rather sit. That we needed and you can't walk. Promise me, you'll not gonna risk your life for me. I'm not gonna let you. You would do it for me. Wouldn't you? Why are you doing this? Peeta! Please. Stay. Okay. I'll stay. No! Where's lover boy? Oh I see. You're gonna help him right? That's sweet. Now, it's too bad you couldn't help your little friend. That little girl. what was her name again? Rue? Yeah. Well we killed her. And now. We're gonna kill you. You kill her? No! Cato! Shout her name! Just this time twelve. For Rue! Peeta! I got it. I got the medicine. What happened to you? No, I'm not. What happened? The girl from two, she threw a knife. I'm okay. You shouldn't have gone. You said you aren't gonna go. You got worse. You get some of that too. I'm okay. That feels better. Okay. Are you? I'm okay. No, come on. You need it too. Come on. Oh. You're so much better. Oh my God, Peeta. I couldn't feel anything. We could go home. We could. With all the team left. We could go home. We know - took off. Cate's gonna be by the Curnocopia. He's not gonna go to places he doesn't know. Fox face, she could be anywhere. We should probably hunt around here. We don't have any food left. Okay, uh, I'll take the bow. I'm just kidding. Peeta? Peeta? Peeta? Peeta? Are you okay? I hear the cannon. That's nightlock Peeta! You will be dead in a minute. I. I didn't know. You scare me to death. Damn you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't even knew, she was following me. She's clever. Too clever. What're you doing? Maybe Cato likes berries too? What time is it? A little afternoon. Why is it so dark? Must be in a hurry to end it. Ready Lusia? Oh right here sir! That's great. Can you put that in the middle? Sure. That's it. That's it. Excellent. Did you hear that? What was that? It's the finale. Let's go. Here. Go on. Shoot. And we both go down and you'd win. Go on. Dead anyway. I always want a drink. Until not so now. How's that? Is that what you want? Huh! No! I can still do this. I can still do it. One more kill. It's the only thing I know how to do. Bring pride to the district. Not that it matters. Please.! Attention. Attention Tributes. There has been a slight rule change. The previous provision allowing for two victors from the same district has been revoked. Only one victor maybe crowned. Goodluck. And may the odds be ever in your favor. Go ahead. One of us should go home! One of us has to die. They had to have their victor. No. They don't. Why should they? No! Trust me. Trust me. Together? Together. Okay. One. Two. Three. Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen. May I present the winners. .. of the 74th Annual Hunger Games. They're not happy with you. Why? Because we didn't die? Because you showed them all. Well.. I'm sorry it didn't go the way they planned. You know I'm not very happy with them either. Katniss. This is serious. Not just for you. They don't take this things lightly. You say you couldn't help yourself. You're so in love with this boy that the dark have not with the most. Unthinkable. You rather die. than not be with him you understand? How did you feel? When you found him by the river? I felt like the happiest person in the world. I couldn't imagine life without him. And what about you Peeta? Damn, she just saved my life. We saved each other. Ladies and gentlemen. The star cross lovers of District 12, this years victors of the 74th Annual Hunger Games. Congratulations. Thank you. What a lovely pin. Thank you, it's from my district. They must be very proud of you. So what happens when we get back? I don't know. I guess I may try to forget. I don't wanna forget. When you've finished, you come here. - Lopez! - <i>Here!</i> Hello, Pepe. Santiago! I would like to go with you again. We have some good catches. You're with a lucky boat. You stay with them. But remember how you went many days without a fish and then we caught big ones? Every day for three weeks. I remember. I didn't think you left me.because you doubted. It was Papa who made me leave. He hasn't much faith. But we have. - Don't we? - Yes. Your luck will come back one day. Mojito for the lady. - And serving pi?a for the gentleman. - Thank you. They had a good catch. For some, yes, the weather is good. And your car, se?or? We're waiting on a water pump. The mechanic thinks it'll arrive in a day or two. - You are comfortable upstairs? - Very, thank you. I don't care if we ever get a water pump. Most er.Americans are impatient, no? I have nothing but time. That's good. Good. Can I offer you a beer on the terrace? Why not? Between fishermen. Maybe I could be a fisherman. You'd wait for me at the front door, with loads of children scurrying under your feet. Charming. - I don't amuse you? - Not today. - <i>Ah! Santiago!</i> - Huh? Oh. - No luck? - No. - How many days now, my friend? - Too many. - The man is a curse on the village. - He was one of the best. His luck is like a black cloud. And soon he's gonna poison all our bones. Yeah. Can I get you some sardines for tomorrow? I have sardines. I'd like to be of help in some way. You bought me a beer. You're already a man. The old man. His grandfather, do you think? I don't know. You're the writer. I know where I can get four fresh baits. I have mine from today. I put them in the box. Let me get you four fresh ones. - One. - Two. All right, two. You didn't steal them? I would. But I bought these. No, let him be. I'm just gonna talk to him, OK? - Excuse me, Santiago. - Hm? - How are you? - Fine. Um. Everyone knows that you are the great expert of baseball. - No. - Yes. And my friends and l, we were discussing about DiMaggio. And why his hits are so few these days. And we thought that perhaps, being an expert, you know, you might have an opinion. Well, he's playing with an injury. A spur. In his foot. You see? I knew something was wrong. And now I know why. I know why he runs like an old woman. You're mistaken. Even with an injury, DiMaggio runs like a deer. If you say so, but it is my opinion. Now you can correct me if I'm wrong, Santiago, but it is my opinion that DiMaggio's good days are behind him. That his reputation exceeds his performance. Yes, yes. But you see, that is not so unusual. For they say that you were once the greatest arm wrestler in all of Cuba. From Havana to Matanzas. They say many things. They say that you once defeated the champion in a contest that lasted two days. But l, myself, I find that very hard to believe. - Come along, Anderez. - Yes, come. Just.a minute. <i>I'm talking to Santiago about arm wrestling</i>. <i>He says he was a great champion once and</i>. I would just like the honour of engaging a great champion. You're a fool, Anderez. Well, old man? Do you decline? No. Sit down. The boy will be the judge. Make sure the positions are. are fair. - Are you ready, old man? - Ready. Wait a minute. Wait, wait! Wait a minute! Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye! Made a mistake. Look at that arm. That is not the arm of a champion. That is just an old, withered tree branch. <i>I'm afraid I would snap that arm</i> <i>like a matchstick</i>. Right! <i>You'll have to excuse me,</i> <i>but I was misinformed</i>. Lopez! Beer for everybody. Santiago. Don't ruin us all with your bad luck, old man. Don't. You would have won. Not today. Tomorrow's gonna be a.good day. Where are you going? Far out. Don't go too far. Your boat is small. You'll be alone. There's a fish out there.waiting for me. Well, I'll. I'll get my father to work far out too. That way, if you catch something really big, we can come to help. He doesn't like to work far out. His eyes are not so good any more. I will see something that he doesn't. I'll get him to go after marlin, like you. - You, your eyes are still good? - Yeah. You're certainly strong enough for a big fish. I think so. Besides, there are tricks. - You have something to eat? - Yellow rice and fish. Do you want some? No. I'll eat at home. I'll make the fire. No. We'll make it later. First, I'll sit out here in the sun. and read my paper. It's yesterday's. Lopez gave it to me.at the terrace. I will read about.the baseball. I'll be back with the sardines. You can tell me about baseball. Oh. Will the Yankees win? I have faith in the Yankees. Think of.DiMaggio. Yeah, but I fear the Indians of Cleveland. And the Tigers of Detroit. I'll be back with the sardines. Right. Excuse me, Lopez. I would like to buy some food. Tired of your mother's cooking, Manolo? We have fried bananas, black beans, rice, a stew. Give me a little bit of each. - You will eat it here? - No, no. And two beers. Two beers. How much is that? - Er. I will put it on your bill. - Thank you. You're a good boy, Manolo. The sun's gone down. You were very quiet. - I brought you some.oranges, papaya. - Thank you. Mama's picture's not on the wall. Oh, I put it on the table.where I can see it less. Makes me too lonely. Come inside. I'm very comfortable here. Papa.come inside. <i>Bring your chair</i>. - You won't stay long? - No. Good. Thank you for the fruit. 84 days without a fish. - You want to know how I know? - Yeah. Lopez's brother works in a market on the same street where we live. Oh. Even in Havana, we know about Santiago's bad luck. Papa.Rodriguez moved out. We have an extra room. Things are going well. We don't need to rent the room any more. I talked it over with Tomas. You come to us. <i>You'll have your own room</i>. Sit, read the paper, listen to the radio. I can do that all right here. I don't have to go to Havana. Look at this place. You and Mama didn't bring me up in a place like this. Now you live like a hermit. An old shack, dirty old blanket. - It's good enough for me. - Aye-aye-aye! Same old story. Papa, for years I've been saying, "Leave here, come to Havana." And you always say, "No. I go out every day, I catch fish, I'm a fisherman." But God isn't giving you any more fish, Papa. He's saying it's time now. He wants you to come with me to Havana. Oh! Now you know what God is thinking. I know he doesn't give you any more fish. He thinks you're getting old. God will give me a fish. A great fish. - When? - Tomorrow. - And if not? - The next day. And if you die, the shame will be on me. It's no shame for a man to die the way he has lived. Papa, please. I love you. Thank you. Then, please, let me stay here and. and look for fish. Papa, I'm sorry to say this. You're too old. Oh. Excuse me. - Manolo, you know my daughter Angela. - A great pleasure. What have you brought? Black beans and rice, fried bananas and some stew. You see? I'm well taken care of. - You're a stubborn old man. - And a great fisherman. Was I talking to you? - Come on, Angela. - Very well, do as you please. When the fish don't come, you'll change your mind. I'll be back. Who gave you all this? Lopez, at the terrace. - I will have to thank him. - I thanked him already. I'd like to give him the belly of a.big fish. Here. Lopez is a very thoughtful man. Oh. Oh! Ohh! - This stew is delicious. - I'm glad you like it. Tell me about baseball. - Are you sure you want to hear all that again? - Yes. Well, in the American League, it is the Yankees. And DiMaggio makes the difference. - But they have other men on the team. - Naturally. Oh. I would like to take DiMaggio out fishing. You know, they say his father was a fisherman, just like us. Just. Just as poor. Dick Sisler's father, he was never poor. No.but Dick Sisler was a great player. Still, in the other league, I pick Brooklyn. over Philadelphia. Remember when Dick Sisler came to the terrace? I wanted to ask him to go fishing. Oh, I was. I was too timid to ask him. - You asked me to ask him. - That's right. - And I was too timid. - Yeah, it was a great mistake. He would have gone fishing with us. Then we would have that for the rest of our lives. Tell me. Who is the greatest manager? Really. Dolf Luque or Mike Gonzalez? Well. ..I would say they're equal. And the best fisherman is you. No. I know a lot better. There are many good fishermen. There's some great ones, too. There is only you. Thank you. You make me very happy. I hope no fish ever comes by so big he will prove us both wrong. You have to go to bed soon. - I'll wake you up in the morning. - You're my alarm clock. Age is my alarm clock. - Sleep well. - Mm. Ha-ha! Hey, you've become very good with a net, Santiago. I had the best teacher. I hope to become as great a fisherman as you. Skill with a net, or the line, or the gaff does not make a man a fisherman, Santiago. One must always think of the fish. We must kill them to survive. but we must never forget the value of their lives. <i>Their beauty, their courage</i>. Manolo. - Manolo. - <i>Argh!</i> Come on. - No, no, no, come on. - Yes. - How did you sleep? - Very well. How do you feel? Confident. Me too. Thank you. Your wife is still asleep? Most Americans sleep late. I like early mornings. Quiet, no interruptions. You are a journalist? No, not at the moment. A fine writer, then. Writer, yes. Fine is open to question. It must be hard work. It is right now. At least for me. - Se?or like some breakfast? - <i>Later</i>. - You don't mind if I work here? - No, no. For me, it would be an honour. - You have nothing to eat? - For today I have enough. Come on now. Good luck! Good luck to you. Excuse me. The old man out there, the one alone in the boat. He was here yesterday with the boy. Ah, Santiago. - He goes out alone? - Yes. Are they related, the old man and the boy? Not by blood, but by affection. The old man has taught the boy to fish. Now the boy goes on another boat. The old man's bound to catch something. isn't he? Who can say? I worked this for a week. ..and I caught nothing. Another day here is a wasted day. I have no time for that. If they hear me talking out loud to myself. ..they'll think I'm a.crazy old man. When did I start talking.out loud to myself? I used to sing. ..in the old days. # La-da-da-da-da-da-dum # La-la-la # Ah-dee-da-dum But the talking. ..that came. ..after the boy left. ..I think. I'm not crazy. And since I am not crazy. ..I don't care what anybody thinks! The rich.have radios on their boat. ..and they listen to baseball. Now is not the time to think of baseball. You have to think of only one thing. The fish. Bird! You want to come and ride with me? <i>No</i>. You have no faith. Virgin fishermen.must have faith. And some luck. A lot of luck. # La-da-da-da-da-da-da-dee-da-da - Good morning. - Good morning, se?ora. - Would you like some coffee? - Yes, please. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Slept well? - Uh-huh. Working? Yeah. Something new? - Notes. - Notes? For what? A short story, a novel? - I don't know yet. - Oh. Don't sound so disappointed. You've been taking notes for a long time now. Time is relative. Einstein. Time discovers truth. Anonymous. You made that up. Perhaps I did. That fisherman. That old man we saw here yesterday with the boy. - You're changing the subject. - That's right. That old man has been out for 84 days. without catching a fish. Maybe he's doing something wrong. Around here, they say he has bad luck. That's one way to explain failure. You're all heart. I'm glad you noticed. I could tie the rope around my toe. Sleep and drift. But wait. Today is not a day for sleeping. Today I should fish. ..the best I can. Se?ora. Would you like something to eat? - Do you make eggs? - Of course. - Se?or? - Yes, eggs. Fine. Are you going to see about the car this morning? Yeah. That bird is not just looking. He's found something. The bird is a.big help. Oh! It's bonita.or tuna. Oh! <i>Thank you, my friend</i>. Could be marlin. This far out. could be very big. This one. ..could be huge. Fish.please make a turn. Come back! Smell the sardines. They're hard.cold and tasty. Oh, Christ! I lost him. Damn it! He's gone. He's come back. He was just making a turn. Don't play games with me, fish. Eat it.or do not eat it. ..but do not play games with me. He's taken it. He's taken it! Eat it! <i>Swallow it!</i> Come on, fish! Swallow it. Swallow it. Now! Oh, God, I've got a fish! I am being pulled by a fish! I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I'll have to.hold him while I can. Thank God he is travelling.not going down. I wish I could see him. Then I would know what I have against me. What if he goes down deep? What do I do? I don't know. I'll do something. It's OK now. It shouldn't give you any more trouble. - All fixed? - Yeah. - Nice car. Bring it down from the States? - Yeah. Lucky to find a water pump for this model Packard, even in Havana. I guess we'd better settle up. Are you interested in selling it? - Selling it? The car? - Mm-hm. I have a customer who's looking for a model like this. I'll make you good price. This car's been a lot of places with me. Sometimes you need a change. Both you <i>and</i> the car. - Is the car ready? - Yeah. I bought this for you. I sold the car. What? Hey, ni?o. - For you. - Thank you, se?or. Let's get a drink. - Here you go. - Thanks. Was that a joke about the car? No. You mean you actually sold it without discussing it? With you? Yes, I guess I did just that. Sorry. Is this the beginning of something I should know about? Are we ridding ourselves of all our worldly possessions? - That car was big and flashy and ostentatious. - And that's what we loved about it. Beginning to need a lot of work. - Today the water pump. - Tomorrow the world. So what's on the schedule now? I'd like to stay here for a while. - Here? Meaning this town? - Yes. You like it here, don't you? The thing that I would like most is to know a little about what you're thinking. Well, you know. I've been thinking about that old man. 84 days without a fish. I mean, how do you deal with that? Maybe you should ask him. People are very private. You just don't go up and hit them with a question about their feelings. You're liable to get an answer like, "Mind your own business." - More politely, probably. - Probably. Two more hours before sunset. Maybe you'll come up before that. Maybe.you'll come up with the moon. Fish. I'm still strong. And you. You have the hook in your mouth! Why did you do that, fish? Are you tired of the hook in your mouth? I'm damn tired too! First blood to you, fish. You're still too strong for me. I think I'll take a walk. OK. Manolo, more ice, uh? I don't have time for two fish. I'm here with a friend. Maybe if I.pull him up a little. ..he will jump. Just gently. Come on. Come on. God! You are like a tree. Give me some line. Come on! Second round for you. You cut my hand. Why did I let you do that? I must be going crazy. I'd better pay more attention.to my work. What time is it? Two o'clock, about. Can't sleep? The old man didn't come back. Come back to bed. You'd better get some sleep. A little while. I should eat something. I wish the boy was here. I also wish I had some.salt. And lime. Lime! Lime! What? - I found them. - Oh, good. Cut them. And squeeze the juice.all over the fish. It's good with lime. - Here. - Oh. Thank you. How old was l when you first took me out into the boat? You always ask that question! Well, I like to hear the answer. You were five. - And I was almost killed. - Yes. How was that? I told you. Here. How was that? All right! I brought in a fish too green. It nearly tore the boat to pieces. I can remember the tail slapping, and the banging, and the noise of you clubbing. I remember you throwing me down onto the bow with the wet line. And then the whole boat started to shake. And.the noise of you clubbing him, it. it was like the chopping down of a tree. The smell of blood all over me. You remember because I told you. ..all of that. Many times. I remember everything, from the very first day. This is good. Everything that comes out of the sea is good. Except Portuguese man-of-war. And sharks. <i>But you can't blame her for those</i>. What was the biggest fish you ever caught? I don't remember. You remember! I've seen some great fish. I've seen some fish that weigh. nearly a thousand pounds. Oh, excuse me. Caught, I asked. Caught? I don't know. Er.two. Yes, two. That. That size. - A thousand pounds? - Yeah! Were you alone on the boat? No. You were not with me. No. It's not right that I wasn't there. <i>He was here when I came here</i> <i>ten years ago</i>. I was working as a busboy in Havana. A cousin who was from here told me about a job as a second barman here. And I was so tired of carrying dishes, so eager to move up into the world, so I came here, and I have been here ever since. Quiet people, good, hard working, honourable. Never is there trouble. But what about the old man - Santiago? He was alone even when I came here. His wife had died. His daughter was married, living in Havana. So he was very much alone. But he's a proud man. Keeps to himself, very little to say. <i>And I am very fond of him</i>. And during these bad times, I have done what I can. But like I say, he's very proud. And whatever I can do, I must do through the boy. Is he the oldest of the fishermen here? Who can tell? A young man catches a fish or he doesn't catch a fish. That is the only difference. Why are you so interested in this man? Cos he hasn't caught a fish for 84 days. And he hasn't given up. There's a dignity there that's.extraordinary. Writers think that way, I suppose. He didn't come back yesterday. -Who? - Santiago. He went out in the morning, but he never came back. Excuse me, I must er.serve the others. Don't you care? Respect. More important than life - respect. All right, fish.I admit it. I'm a little tired. My head is light. If you're not tired. ..you. you must be very strange. <i>I would like to show you</i>.<i>what kind of man I am</i>. <i>I would change places with you, fish, if I could</i>. Down there in the darkness. and the cold of the sea. Come on up, fish.and face me. I challenge you.one to one. Man to man. Getting tired, Santiago? - How many hours is it? - More than eight. Don't worry, Absalom. You'll lose in time to load sugar in the morning. And you're gonna lose. Now. Give me some rum! Here. What time is it? 4O minutes past five. I made you a promise, Absalom. Congratulations. <i>When I was young, I could beat anyone</i>. If I wanted to badly enough. Fish.I will stay with you till I die. And you will stay with me too.I suppose. <i>Oh</i>. I wonder how it feels, to be in an aeroplane, looking down on the sea. I would like to fly slowly. ..and look at the fish. - Why is it, do you think? - Why is what? - Fruit in drink. - What about it? Fruit in drink in tropical places. In Northern climates, they drink alcohol straight. Availability. The abundance of fruit in the tropics. - You think that? - I do. - Would you like to hear my theory? - I would. I think that in the tropics, people drink for pleasure. In Northern climates, they drink to avoid depression. Well, that's a theory. I don't like all this fruit in my drink. ..because I am now drinking to avoid depression. Are you bored here? I feel at loose ends. I-I don't. I don't feel very useful to myself, or to anyone else. I can't leave here right now. Something is happening. I have to find out what it is. If I don't, I'm lost. Where does that leave me? I love you. You know that. Do l? - Where are you going? - I don't know. Wait for me. Wait for me. What's the matter, hand? You got a cramp? You can't. I'll open you up myself, if I have to. Come on, hand. Help me. Please. That's it. Aah! He's coming up. Come on, hand. Please. Help me! Holy Mary. ..Mother of God. Make him pay for the line. Make him pay for it. Don't break it, fish. <i>Don't break the line</i>. <i>How many times did you jump?</i> Many. The sacs of your back. ..are filled with air. You can't go deep again. Now. ..I will be able to work you. Now.I must show you how strong I am. Damn fish! You are killing me! I don't care.who kills who. You have the right. I love and respect you.very much, but before this day ends. ..I will kill you. - Did you see Santiago? - No, I haven't seen him. Santiago? Damn it! <i>Don't go mad on me, fish</i>. And please. ..please don't do anything foolish. <i>My God!</i> I wish the boy could see this. He's gone. Be strong, old man. I want to see you. I want to see you clearly. <i>Come closer, fish</i>. <i>Please come closer</i>. I've been waiting for you for. for a long time. I must land it. I have taken this fish. ..which was my brother. Now to work. May we sit with you? Sure. The old man is your friend? We've been fishing together many times. How old is he? I don't know. What difference does it make? - Will he come back? - Yes. And with a fish. He's a great fisherman. He's more than that. Once.I was in the boat with him. And he hooked one marlin of two, of a pair. The female. She always feeds before the male. The female fought against the line, and the male crossed and made circles. Santiago was afraid he'd cut the line with his tail. So Santiago gaffed the female. We clubbed her. And the male, which was at the side of the boat, jumped high in the air. ..to see where the female was. She was beautiful. And he had stayed. The old man said, "That was the saddest thing I ever saw." I was sad too. - How long did the male stay? - Till she was butchered. We live this way. I must go now. - Is there anything we can do? - No. He will come back. I would stay by the boat. What? Like the male marlin. If anything ever happened, I would be there. Fifteen.hundred pounds. Maybe more. At 3O cents a pound. Oh. I need a pencil for that. Maybe it was a sin to kill this fish. Why? I was born a fisherman, the fish was born a fish. St Peter was a fisherman. So was DiMaggio's father. Anyway, I loved him. So there is no sin. Come on! You have no understanding what sin is. Fifteen hundred pounds. Please, old man. Come back. With a little wind. ..and a little luck. ..we'll be home soon, fish. # La-dee # Dee-dee-da-da-da-dee-da-dee-da-da Where you been? Well, I asked around, and found Town Hall. Got a hold of some official and told him that a fisherman had been gone for two days. And? Well, I got a lot of smiles and assurances that this was not unusual, and that there was no way of keeping track of all the boats. Lopez gave me the same answers. What about hiring a boat and looking for him ourselves? We wouldn't have a chance in hell of finding him. And.I don't think he'd want that. So you think we should just do nothing? We're not doing nothing, we're waiting. Like the boy, we're waiting. and trying to understand. That's something. Isn't it? I woke up.and you were gone. I should have left a note. # La-da-da-da-da-la-da-la-dee # La-la-dee # La-dee-la-la # Da. <i>Oh, my God</i>. It was too good to last. He's going to hit me. I cannot stop him. I can try. I got him! Aie! He got me. Damn. My harpoon. And all the rope. Fish.you are bleeding. Soon there will be others. Don't think, old man. Sail this course. ..and take what comes. <i>But I have to think</i>. It's all I have left. That and baseball. Joe.I hit him. A good, clean hit. Not a home run like you, but a.good, clean hit. The wound is bleeding. They will come back. I have to.protect myself. I wish I had a stone. ..to sharpen this knife. But I didn't bring one. It's all right. Don't think of what you didn't bring. You must think of. of what you have. I have hope. Then.think of hope. <i>And the good old days</i>. Santiago and Maria. - Come on. - Where are we going? - Come on, come with me. - I am, Santiago. - Oh, my dress is going to be ruined! - You won't need it again. - You know this boat? - Of course. This is the boat. This morning, at our wedding, I gave you my heart. Now here. I promise you. ..I will take fish from the sea. ..as long as I live. Luck comes in many forms. I'll take it in any form. - Lopez.do you have the newspaper of today? - Yes. - May I borrow it, please? - Behind the bar. Thank you. You can keep it. Oh. Thank you. He cannot read. Are you sure? He seemed to be reading. Match scores. Baseball. The old man taught him. Santiago! The Yankees beat the Tigers.twice! 9-2 and 7-6! DiMaggio. Listen, old man! DiMaggio had five hits! Two home runs! One in each game! Listen, old man! DiMaggio's well again! He can't hear you. You're making a fool of yourself, calling out like that. He can hear me. No sound is lost. Every sound from the beginning of time is still in the air. - Who told you that? - He did. Sound isn't lost when there's no-one to hear it. He's out there. Maybe alive, and maybe not. Why? Cos foolish people like you. ..tell him what a great fisherman he is. Tell him how strong, cunning he is. Truth is, he's an old and weak, stubborn man. - No! You know nothing! - Be quiet. You live in the city. You walk into a store and the food has been through many hands. And then you open your purse, and the food is yours. Don't preach to me. I know this place. I was born and raised here. I know the life. We're talking about my father. Yes, and m. Sorry. Have you heard anything from someone. someone who's seen him? No. A cousin of Lopez, who told me, said he went.far out. That's true. People will say, "Angela, you didn't take care of your father." "Angela, a good daughter provides for her father in his old age." Well.God knows, I tried. In my next life, my father will be a tailor. Again. My God. Come on. Come on. Which one is first? You took my knife. Go and show it to your brother! I'm sorry, fish. I wish I. ..I had never hooked you. This makes.everything wrong. I shouldn't have gone out so far. Either for me. ..or for you. - Hi. - Hi. - Cigarette? - Oh, thanks. I had a funny dream. - Do you want to hear it? - Sure. I dreamt that the fisherman, the old man. ..was picked up by a big boat. A liner. And in my dream, the. the boat looked like the wreck for Conte di Savoia. They picked him up, and gave him a big dinner. Risotto Milanese. Osso buco. Oh, the food looked so good. Are you hungry? No. Wake me if something happens. OK. - I love you. - I know that. You're tired, old man. Tired inside. <i>Get away!</i> Eat that! Come on! Eat that! Damn it, he did! He's back! - You saw him? - The boat. But it's still far off. I thought you wanted to know. Manolo! Thanks. It's nothing. Santiago! <i>Santiago!</i> - He's back. The boy saw the boat. - Oh, thank God. What's that? It's Sunday. I'd forgotten. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Let me help you. - I'm all right, I said! I never thought. in my whole life I'd see such a fish. They beat me, Manolo. They truly beat me. The fish. ..he didn't beat you. No. Afterwards. The sharks. The sharks. Here, wait. Let me help you. Please! No, no. Please. You stay here. Papa! I'm all right. I'm all right. - <i>I'm fine</i>. - I can see that. I'm fine. You're a stubborn old man. You'll come to see your grandchildren soon? Yeah. Sure. Sure. Soon. - Santiago! - They're calling you. I'm not deaf. Santiago! This is a truly great fish, Santiago! <i>This is a champion fish!</i> <i>And your bad luck is over, old man!</i> <i>You're not unlucky any more, Santiago!</i> - Did you sleep? - Yeah. - Are you all right? - Just my hands. What did you catch? One on the first day, two on the second, and two on the third. Very good. I can go fishing with you again. I still have much to learn. Here. We need a good killing lance. And we must always have it on board. - I lost my knife. - I have another. How many days of bad weather do you think we have? Three or four. My hands will be healed by then. I'll have everything ready. I missed you out there. What a fish. Great loss. But a great gain. You see, you can be destroyed. ..but not defeated. What do you think about the Yankees? - How are they doing? - They won! - <i>Twice</i>. - I didn't have a radio on the boat. - Tell me. DiMaggio, he played? - He's well again. Yes, DiMaggio is well again. - He. He had a spur. - It's gone! - It's gone? - He runs like a deer! - The operation was good, huh? - Yes. That's wonderful. So.is he gonna. is he gonna win the pennant? Definitely. Have faith in DiMaggio! Now you are becoming like me. You have new messages. Monday, 1:42 pm. Hi, Jimmy. I hope you get home OK. You enjoy your flight and then. I know how much you hate flying so, eh, anyway Well anyway, I'm doing a big chicken on Sunday. - Ask him about Sunday! Oh, your dad is cleaning out the garage and wants to know if you want that old punching bag hanging up. He's getting too old for that. Anyway, give us a call tomorrow, eh, when you land. or today or whenever you can. You know what I mean, eh. Can't wait to see you. Love you! Bye! Wednesday, 9:36 pm. Jimmy, it's Griff. Eh, oh God, I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry. Listen, when you get back, you give us a shout. I'll get 'im, I promise ya. I love you, mate. Talk to you soon. End of messages. Hi Jimmy, how you're feeling? Alright Deb. Hi Jimmy. Could I get a coke, please. Yeah. Look, mate, em. I'm sorry about what happened. I'm sure you can point me in the right direction, Cal. I didn't see anything, Jimmy. Sorry, mate. You live 50 yards away. Look, if you're only here to cause trouble, you may as well go. - Terry! - Stay out of this, will ya! Trouble? Jesus. leave it! Jimmy, don't! Don't! Jimmy! Jimmy don't, don't. Oh, Jim.! Jimmy, wait! Just tell him, will ya? I called the fire service. There were four of them. They broke in. I heard your dad. screamin'. I heard him screamin' and I just watched. I watched from the window. 'cause I was scared. Who are they? - Morning. - Bye. - Hang on. - I'm Late, George. - Oh, can you get the lawn mowed later? - Why? Jimmy's coming home for a few days and I want the place to look nice. He won't be back until Friday. Yeah, but it's goin' rain all week after today, and it won't get done. He's been in the Afghan desert for months. The lawn is the last thing he goin' care about. Besides, I want to put the cab in for service. You alright, love? I just want him home for good, now. You've gone missin' in that picture. I'd been in labor for 7 hours! It was lucky you were behind the counter. With your mullet and your earring, talk about a mess! One minute you bumpin' about on the back of me bike, the next we got a baby boy. We didn't know what hit us, did we? At 10:35 that night I knew exactly what hit us. I'll mow the lawn when I get home. Thanks, love. - She ain't carryin' no ten grand, mate. - Oh, fuck off, man. I've been scoping her out for months, gov. She better be, I ain't sittin' in the car, gettin' big old cramp for nothing, guv. About every Friday at half four, she does the cash run, trust me. What are you talking about? It's pushing five already, you know. What? - Where're you goin'? - Bank run. Here. Take this over with ya. - You never like doing the bank. - I will if I take your car. - Keep it on ya. - Yeah, I know. There she is, just like clockwork. - Eh, there she is, she's on the move. Hey, let's do this, yeah. Yeah? - We'll take a left, Bob, head her off. - Hey, give me my mask. Oh, God! Shit! Come on! - Where's the money, bitch? - It's not in her purse. She must have it on her. Where is it? Where's the money? Let's get the fuckin' shit and get back in the car, man! No, you've got to be fuckin' kiddin' me. Where's the money? Where'd you put it? Is it in the car? - What the fuck you want, man? - What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Get the fuck back in your car, man! Come on! You'll have a day, a fuckin' day! Fuck off, man! Get back in your fucking car! Fuck 'em up!. Come on, come and get it! I fucking dare ya! - Come on. - Hey, Sigmund. Sigmund, look here! - Come on. - Let's cover this stuff, wood boy! For fuck sake, let's go! Hey, watch me, man. Watch! Prick! Are you alright? And then he came at you. But, you said he was behind you. Mr Vickers. Sorry. I just wanted to stop him. I never meant to. Yeah. Well, you should have thought of that before you started swinging. Let's get him out of here before the families find out. Otherwise, we'll have Reverend McDaniel giving us seven types of shit. - Mr..What is it? - Vickers. Mr. Vickers, I'm DCI Holland. You're gonna have to come with us. How serious is this? Mr. Vickers, I'm arresting you on suspicion of manslaughter. You do not have to say anything, though it may harm your defense if you do not mention, when questioned, something that you'll later rely on in court. Anything you say may be given in evidence. - Do you have any questions? - No. Fantastic. Alright, the next time we meet, it'll be down in nick. - Where the fuck's my money, then? - We had a little problem, Warren. Hey. Oh, it got on top, firm. Man meant to do us some fuckin' Avatar ills, still. Where's the fuck's my brother? Oi. that's the thing. Huh? He's dead, Wass. - You're supposed to be lookin' out for each other. - We do look out for each other, but shit happens, Bob. - What the fuck! You're supposed to be to connect with 'im! - We'll get 'im! We found out where he lives. He only made bail a few hours ago, Bob. You find him and you finish him. Right? And then we'll deal with it, yeah? Trust. Oh! No! George! Do you remember me? George! Shut your fuckin' mouth. Or.I'll cut your fuckin' tongue out. The fuck you doin'? You're going to milked me. No! On the other hand, fuckin' me and wondering what's happening to my missus is a fucking tune to me. It seems you had some bollocks twelve years ago. You a fucking hero? You're a hero, are ya? But I bet when they let you out on bail, you come right to tell your missus you'd never get a slap, did they? I stopped a robbery. I killed one of them, as well. What's for dinner? Suppose I mention the lad, you killed his brother, is right in there with your missus. Come on now, don't be like that. You need a line all set up. You can't go through life without a grin once in a while. So why don't you give us a really big smile. Give me the phone. Now. Go start the car. Fuck that, man, I want to see them go up the rude way. You know, it was the mean old fuckers who done you, right. You're very lucky, mate. See, I didn't get to say goodbye to my little brother after you smashed his fuckin' head in with that bat. But I'm gonna let you say goodbye to 'er. Cause I'm a nice guy. See, I did you a little favor. You're not my style. I put a little more petro. on the bitch. Now, hopefully she lights off first. Fuck me, it's cold. Don't worry, Georgy. I'll turn the heatin' up. How ya feelin'? You're not doin' yourself any favors by beatin' the shit out of people for info. Yeah, well. Somebody knows something. Well, maybe they do. But doing this job for 6 years, you realize it's every neighbor's god-given right to turn a blind eye. Fear of gettin' a knife in their belly. - So, stop poking around. - And what have you got? Nothing. no one's talking. One of the neighbors said they heard some commotion about 11. Thought it was the TV. Then called the fire brigade at 11:30 when they saw the garage going up. Saw a black BMW speedin' off. There's been a couple of attacks like the one your old man stopped. We think it's the same lot. Whoever they are, people are scared Jimmy. Were they alive? Jimmy, mate.don't. Were they burnt alive? Postmortem suggests they burnt to death, yes. Have you seen Morgan since you got back? No.I haven't signed the divorce papers. Can you get me the CCTV footage? Jimmy, I've seen it, mate. It's just weird rabbit masks. I'll bring it to you tomorrow. Jimmy. He stood his ground. your old man. When did ya get back? Friday. You missed the funeral. Tryin' to make up for it. I e-mailed you four. five times, Jimmy. I had a combat mission in Helmand. Your commanding officer said you'd been arrested and detained. What happened? You know I can't tell you, Morgan. Oh, I think you can, Jimmy. Especially when I have to arrange and cover for you at your own parents' funeral. Wait! Sorry. You don't have to be on your own. Stop by the flat, sometime. OK? - Hey, yeah, you on my best case? - Fuck, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa. who the fuck is this? Hey, this is Ronnie, he's alright and he just wants some. - Hey, I heard your stuff's awesome, fella. - Get the fuck out of here. Bring him up to Caleb's in business hours. - Yeah? - Well, and they want half-an-ounce, I suppose. We're havin' a party. Well, that takes money. This is four bills. What the fuck! I said five. Your guy told us four. We only got four on us. - We could-We'll just get four hundred's worth? - I said I'd get half-an-ounce. I tell you what. You run me the four bills and let me see your wifey's breasts. - Naw, man. Look, let's just get four hundred's worth, yeah? - No deal. Babe, let's just go. Babe, we need this gear. I ain't asking for much, just a quick flash. You ain't even wearin' a bra. This guy is sick, you know. You actually thought I'd gonna give you a hundred pounds off the gear. - for a quick look at your girlfriend's tits? - I did, yeah. Look, we're gettin' out of here. Just give me my money back. You ain't going nowhere. That's crazy, you know. You get the gear when she sucks my cock. No! Leave him! Don't! - Stop! - Take off your top. They'll stop wailin' him in when you start suckin'. - Wait! Leave him! She's up for it. - Dickhead. You know, I've got to record that shit, bro. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck? I told you to suck this dick. Do it properly or I'll throw you through the window. And you won't get no gear. Mr Evans? What the fuck you want? Mr. Evans. We've had reports of a disturbance at this address a few hours ago. So what? - Mr. Evans, have you been home all night? - Yeah. We have reason to believe that a man has been assaulted on your premises. Mr. Ryan Scott? Don't ring a bell. Can we come in? Get the fuck out of here! Mr. Evans, there's a young man in hospital whose been quite badly beaten. So what? It don't have fuck to do with me. So take your little fuck-puppet here and get the fuck away from my yard. Don't be stranger though, sweetheart. You come back around here, anytime you want, yeah? - What was that? - You heard. What different reality do you honestly think I would. be interested in a tommy-sack of shit like you? Whoa, whoa. Come on. Go on, girl. You have peace with 'em. Reign her in. You get that little pit bull on a leash, yeah? Oi! Jenny, wait up. You can't let them get to you. We know he did it and we're gonna go in and get away with it? You've been a constable for five minutes. Wanna make a difference? Climb the ladder. I'll be in the car. The owner of the black BMW is a Warren Evans, 3305 South Avenue. You sure it's him? Warren Evans had a younger brother Joshua. Joshua Evans was accidentally killed two weeks ago during an attempted robbery. After receiving a blow to the head. From your old man. Hello? What the fuck! What the fuck! Huh? What the fuck you doing driving into me, like that, you fucking fool? Huh? Oh, you don't talk? I'm fuckin' talking to you, bro. Don't fuckin' look at me, bro! What the fuck! What the fuck, man! You crazy?! What the fuck are you doing? You know who the fuck I am? Oh, you're a big man, yeah? Got me tied up. You cut me and we'll see what happens to you, you fuckin' dickhead. I'm gonna ask you once. If I have to ask you twice, I'm gonna cut off your left ear. If I have to ask you again, I'm gonna cut off your right ear. Does that make sense? It's a very, very simple process. OK? Are we on the same page? Yeah? Good boy. OK. The couple in the garage. Couple of weeks back. Fuck you, man. Fuck that dickhead. He killed my little brother. He deserved what we did to him. Hey. So, what was he to you? I bet you're the son or something, innit. Your mom.fucked me. Great ass. We made 'em face each other, you know. Before we lit 'em up. So they could watch each other burn. Should have seen the look on their faces. Fuckin' priceless. You know what? I'm gonna let you go. But you gotta do something for me. - You're lying. All of this. - I'm not lying to you. - For real? - Yes, for real. Yes.. Yes, I like ya. I need you to give me the names of the other boys, yeah. Now. See, take that, take that. Now, listen, listen. Listen. They're never gonna know, alright, black and white. You give me the names and you live, if you don't.well. Alright, alright. Alright, fuck it. Alright, fuckin' done. Here, fuckin' take it, man. But about that stuff I said before, I took it too far, yeah. My bad. - Yeah? - Yeah. But just imagine.Just imagine what it felt like.to be burnt alive. - What you talking about, man? - The jolly, lad. What you fuckin' talkin' about? Hey, man, you said you'd let me go. What the fuck you doin'? Huh? Please, man, you said you would be helpin'. Let me go, man! Please! Please! Please! So sorry, man! Please! I said let me go! Let me go! Please! Please! Help! Please! Please! So sorry, man! Please, I.! Please, man, you said you would let me out of here! Let me go man! Please! Please let me go! I said it before, man, please! [Screams] Not sleepin', are you? The coffee's not gonna help, is it? The sun will be up soon. How've you been, anyway? Yeah, um. Yeah, good, but.the vets have moved to a bigger building, right? Despite the. Jimmy, I'm really sorry about what's happened. Do you think that was retaliation for what your dad did? Jimmy, promise me you're not gonna do anything stupid. OK? Can I use your bathroom? Yes, of course. Wait a minute. What's that? - That's just nothing. - Jesus, Jimmy, you're bleeding! - Oh, Morgan, just leave it. It's nothing. Noth. - No, sit down. - Listen. Just leave it. - Jimmy, you need a stitch. Sit down. Tell me what happened, Jimmy? - Just a couple of lads in a pub, you know. - In Afghanistan. Alright, alright. Something works to get the guy to talk. Ah, it's just.. It's complicated out here. Really? Because somebody told me there's no such thing as a complication. Only a problem derived by a person, not a situation. Who, me? Oh, that makes absolutely no sense, so.I must have been pissed. Clown. I will get around to signing those. No rush. Right, eh. I'm done. Wait, eh, a minute. We'll put a dressing on it. You got it? It's all better. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Usually cats and dogs, but it'll do. Hope you like scars. I'm used to 'em. How's your little scar. The day I saved your life. Please, I was hardly gonna bleed to death, was I? Well, that was 20 miles away from the nearest hospital, in the middle of the Brighton Bay. Anything could have happened. Well, ah. Thank you. - Hey, Morgan. - Hey. - What can I get you? - Ah, cappuccino thanks. <i>Mr. Evans was last seen yesterday at the gym in Kenwood Downs, last night at around 9 o'clock.</i> <i>Big question is how Mr. Evans came to be out there and why.</i> <i>Nobody really knows what Mr. Evans was doing out here on his own in a car.</i> <i>In fact, It's yet to determine whether he was actually alone.</i> - Here you go. - Thanks. They've been on about this all day. Who cares, right? Just some dealer, it's just what they come to. <i>.And an explosion shortly after.</i> <i>It seems that this particular area, just up the Carmel Road, </i> <i> is quite popular with teen-agers and dealers.</i> <i>In fact, it's been a troublesome spot for some time now.</i> <i>Mr. Evans was arrested 3 years ago after.</i> <i>police caught him in an organized crime gang</i> <i>raided a flat in Garrison, East London. </i> <i>Mr. Evans admitted being involved in the supply of cocaine and heroin.</i> <i>The sources said the six-year-old Caleb Green, jailed.</i> How the fuck do you know this Caleb? Who else is it gonna be, guv? You know they don't spend their days much with these organized visits. Boss was only talking about offing Caleb last week, man. Hm. Boy, that's a little tawdry, man. Hey, yo. Less with the gibes, alright? Do this. - What you asking, fella? - Want to talk some business. Fuck off. - Go, on! - David! - You better know what you're doing, bro. - Tell me you didn't do it. Tell me! - What are you on about? - You fuckin' know, Warren, man! Oh, you're trippin' out, bro. I ain't got a fuckin' clue what you're on about. Nah! Have one chance so you put the gun down. And get the fuck off me! And I'm gonna you both walk out of here alive. - For whatever offense it was. - I ain't involved, brother. That's not even loaded. Try me. Get up. The both of ya. - Someone burned out his car. - With him in it, bro. And you think that was me? Why the fuck would I take the time to do something like that? When I off some great problem. - If I find out it's you, OK? - I'm what? You try and do fucko. Now fuck off. Don't let me see you up in my block again. Pair of fuckin' clowns. I need some addresses. Did it feel good? It's far from left. Jimmy, you gotta let this go, mate. What? And let you lot sort it. I got 4 names. What did you get? So this is it? This is how it's gonna be? I'll just stand back while you go on some urban safari across London? Now, you know as well as I do, this is the only way this is gonna get done. What happens if you do get one of 'em? What're you gonna do, take a statement? You gonna process 'em, while they laugh at ya, spit in your face. You try and put them in some cushy little jail, where they sit on their fuckin' ass all day, playing video games. This country's changed. The riots, just are starting. There was a time I would've bled to keep the red in the Union Jack. Them days are long gone. We've got a generation of offenders we don't know what to do with, Griff. And you know as well as I do, there's nothing to stop them doing it again There's me. Revenge will never give you closure. Revenge? It's not revenge, this is necessity. Get me an address. - How many were there? - Two. I know it's really hard, Mrs. Gilbert, can you describe them? One had, like a, a black and white hoodie, I don't remember the others. It happened so fast. It's OK. Look, I'll be in a sec, OK? - Sir? - Yeah, hang on a sec, will ya. Alright, let's get on with it. I'm teeing off with the superintenant at one o'clock. And I don't want to be late for this shit. Armed robbery, two suspects, both in their forties. Mr. Oliver tried to grab one of the guns, apparently. Other guy put two in his chest. Held Mrs. Guilbert at gunpoint and raided the till. Cool. That's a tidy bit of business. - Eh, any CCTV? - Yeah, but it's a bit faded. What's he doin' tryin' to disarm them-the nutter. I don't know. Protecting his livelihood? Yeah, that worked out well for him, didn't it? - Listen PC.what's your name? - Griffin. It's probably just an insurance jump gone wrong. Try not to take it too personally, mate. She'll make a claim, get a huge payout, everyone's happy. And the suspects? Eh, get the rounds dug out of Charlie Bronson over there and have the morgue send 'em over to me. It may take a while, but, eh, hey.slim justice is better than no justice. That's enough for me. Thank you. - You're drivin', are you? - No, but I'm a lousy drunk. - Oh, yeah? Hm. Define lousy. Put it this way: The last time I got drunk, I entered a wet T-shirt competition on holiday. - That right? - I won, of course. Course. So, what kind of a drunk are you? I can be quite incorrigible. Unlike most people, I embrace the effects of alcohol. I don't beat myself up about having a good time. And this is your assessment of my character? No. But I can tell you're cautious. timid. And I reckon you're fucking shit-scared that if you have that glass of wine, that dress of yours is gonna end up on my bedroom floor. And your panties in my collection. I'm not wearing any. Sorry about that, guys. Thirsty, dear? Now. Where were we, Ronnie? We were about to come down to about 30%, Alex. Finish these desserts and you're both get the bill. At least that's what your lovely wife was saying. Oh, was she now? That's why I like to bring her along. Good judge of character, my Susann. - Aren't you, babe? - Um hm. You've got yourself a deal. I might move Alex, myself. Smart move. Excuse me for two seconds. Will you? You know it doesn't matter what you wear to me. But you don't look right without an MP5 and a fuckin' ammo rig. I'll take that as a compliment. She's something else. That's that fellow's wife, mate. Drink? I need to get my hands on some bits. If you're still in that business. Hey! Hanny! - You alright, Trison? - Yeah. What the fuckin' hell's that? Excalibur? Not walkin' about with it. It's slender, titanium. That'll go through a car door. What the fuck do I want to stab a car door for? - That'll work, too. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.listen, listen. Put that back. You're gonna have someone's eye out. What? You've never stabbed someone before? Now that is a SIG Sauer. Peach. Yeah, it takes 19 in the clip. It's effective up to 50 meters. The man knows his toys. We'll take 'em. I'll get him a silencer for that. You should know, Jimmy, that ain't me, no more. I mean, I did it because you ask, but. I appreciate it. Jimmy.we go way back. and I fuckin' know you. That look in your eye, it ain't good, mate. I've got it under control. Look, I feel your pain, I really do. Trust me, I'd be doing the same thing. We should drink to Louis, mate. So if you want to take a stand, you've gotta be tall. Taller than you've ever been. You understand what I'm sayin' to ya? Take care, alright? You need anything else, you just let me know, alright? - Hey, y'all. - For what? For Warren, yeah? Hey, get some more in place. I'm down for a piss kreig. Hey yo, have you thought about who it could've been? No, man. You? Fuck no, bro. But we'll find 'im, yeah. And when we do. me, you and that scrawny little shit in there. will fuckin' ruin him, yeah? - Hell, yes. - Yeah? - Right. - That's what I'm talkin' about. Line 'em up. What the fuck is this? What? You got a fuckin' problem? Come on, then! - You're gonna die tonight. - No, I. I know. It's terrible, innit. But it's the truth. The only reason it hasn't happened yet is because in your current. unfortunate situation, you leave me severely spoilt with choices. You see, I could.literally. I could put anything in there. Hello. Hello. Hello. Sorry. It was a bad joke. You all done? You're tellin' me, what's goin' on, bubba? Stop fuckin about, we're worried, fella. Please, fucking shit-brain. Who the fuck is this? Where's Danny? Danny can't talk, right now. Who are you, mate? You're the same guy that did Warren, huh? What's your fucking problem? He deserved to burn to death He deserved to die for what he did. For what you all did to that copper. About that, ya? So what the fuck that's got to do with you? You think you're a fuckin' scary do ya on the other end of the phone, yeah? Fuckin' scary, aren't ya? Well, let's go face to face, see how scary you are, then. Where are you, bro. Oh, we will go face to face. And when we do, I'm gonna annihilate you. I. I'm gonna fuckin'. annihilate you. Where were we? You're gonna love this. Now this is a little lesson. in cement. In the general sense of the word, cement's a binder. Substance sets, hardens, independently. Binds materials together. - Shit, no! - Traces back to the Romans. Till they used the term. "Opus Caementicium" (Roman Concrete: lime, grease, sand and water) Hey, yeah, hey. No, no, no! Wow! Two kids found 'im. Where the bloody hell do we start with something like this? What is that? Eh, mouth clamp. I think dentists use them. It looks like some kind of sex toy. That's solid. He might have swallowed up to two liters before he eventually suffocated. The cement has bonded all of his internal organs together. If you hit 'im now with a sledge hammer, he'd probably break apart. Fuck! The pathologist is on his way. No, bugger that. I'm all over the CSI shit. I've been waiting for something decent to fall into my lap ever since I got promoted. Hmm. Hold that. You get the kids' witness statements and let's have some coffees. This is gonna be a long morning. - DCI Holland. - Anything else? Oh, yeah. OK. Yeah. DCI Holand. Holland command informs me that you have something on your CCTV I need to have a look at. Not me, love. Well, someone from your telephone said. It was me. I rang ya. Had these installed last year. Mainly because after the last three breakins we had, you lot - said you couldn't do anything without CCTV. - Right. Too busy sitting up in a warm office doing paperwork, I suspect. Processing criminals instead of giving them what they really need. - A good kicking. - OK. Debbie. Can I have a word, Terry? What? - What are you doing? - Protecting my pub. Your pub? We both know exactly who you're protecting. It is that fearfulness. You know exactly whose car that is. And you can't turn a blind eye? They know everything. They get wind that I've let this slip, they'll burn the place down with us in it. You've seen what they can do. Yes. And I know what Jimmy can do. He can steamroller the lot of them. Just let him get on with it. You can't get him up to that shark in there. We gonna look at this, or what? There. So what? Jesus Christ! Take-Take-Take-Take it back, come to the beginning. Play it-Play it from there. And pause it. There. I got you, you fucker. Shit! Fuck! - Mrs. Vickers? - Yeah. It's about your husband, Mrs. Vickers. Right, OK. - Well, have you seen him in the past few days? - No, I haven't. Sorry. - Not at all? No, I just said I haven't. What's all this about? We may have reason to believe that your husband has been involved in a series of crimes. Um, what sort of crimes? We can't say, I'm afraid. Well, if you see him, can you give us a call as soon as possible? Eh, this is the detective in charge of the investigation. OK. Thank you. Those murders. on the news, they're you, aren't they? Jesus, Jimmy! Morgan, they executed my fucking parents. Well, aren't you doing exactly the same thing, what is that? Justice? They don't deserve justice. They don't deserve to live. They need their hearts torn out. They've been there all day. Jimmy, you know, when they told me what happened, I. I didn't believe it. Who does that to an old couple? It's just. I just wanted to find you. What happened? There were these six Afghan soldiers we were training, turned on us. Four Taliban. killed six of our soldiers. We needed to figure out if there were any more among us, so they put me to work. work on a Monday with just one client. And I got him talking eventually. And he knew so much, just so much. They would have fucking done us all. So I couldn't let him live. I had to hold him to keep our space together, cause. I went too far. And they locked me up. You escaped. Yeah. Jimmy. Was there ever anyone else? No!. This can only end badly. And what's the alternative? You get in a car and you drive until you don't have any fuel left. You might have to. And would you come with me? Yes. I have to finish this. Holland. I think we found your man. Under no circumstances are they to approach him. Just maintain eye contact. I'm on my way. Oh yeah, get me helicopters. Yeah, and I want a SWAT team. Yes, I know we have to call on that, just get it done. Hi, mate. Got any ID on ya? - What's your name? - It IS him. Put the guns down, Vickers. Didn't expect to see you, Colonel. Here to take me back? As soon as you report in, son, the better this will be for everyone. Well, everyone's gonna have to wait. This is not an option, James. You're a serving soldier in this country's most elite force. Rooker knows the Afghan spilled his guts to you and he wants what you know. I've got a few things I need to finish first and then I'll come in. This isn't gonna bring them back, you know. What you are doing. You're a good lad. and you're a great soldier. But you've got to let this go before it turns into a mess that even I can't clean up. It'll stop when they're dead. And then I'm out. Out? I've seen enough blood to last a lifetime. I want a normal life. What is a normal life? A comfortable desk job at the Ministry? Maybe driving a forklift truck around some grubby warehouse? Newspapers and sandwiches on your lunch break? A flask of coffee? People like you are beyond the realm of social integration. They sit here. you sit there. Psychologically tweaked to be superior to all these drones that walk the street. Align 'em and laugh. These people, if they knew what you've done to keep them living their mundane lives. They'd even kiss your feet. You're a hero, James. You do know that if they hadn't of locked me up, I would have been there for them. I was due home the day before they were killed. Pull over. You've got 48 hours to clean up your personal shit. Then this turns over to Rooker. and he's not a pussy cat either. Dickheads! Joe. What you on, mate? You got a second? Yeah, but I just got to get these tools back to the armory, so. - Have to get on the mosey. - Of course. - You know Jimmy Vickers, don't ya. - Yeah. Yeah, I ran a support op for him out of Fort Robinson for four weeks, sir. Is Holland closin' in on 'im? Well, man's trauma now. I mean, he's gone mad, right? You know about this, his mom and dad. Never mind that. You still can't go around doing what he is doing. But you've got to give me the facts if I'm gonna find him. Hang on a minute. are you helpin' him? Joe, I've known him since I was six, mate. I think this is fucked! I don't care who you've grown up with, he's rotten. He's out of control. And Holland isn't? He doesn't give a fuck about anything. All he wants to do is lynch Vickers to shortcut his way right to the top. Can you imagine a prick like him as Superintendent? Just keep me in the loop. please. - Anything else? - No, that's lovely. Eh, just the bill. Spencer Holland. Hey, gorgeous. On your lunch break? This week's fare? Thought you cops were fish-and-chips types. Eat on the go, crooks to catch, all that. Yeah, I'm in a bit of a rush, too. So, eh. Are you? Yeah, that's right. Got your hands full with those two murders. Murders? I don't know what you're talking about? Oh, fuck off, Spencer, everyone knows about your killer. "THREE LEFT," I heard. Sounds like a vigilante if you ask me. If you fuckin' write any of this, I will end you. Come on, don't be a prick! I want a quick interview. People have got a right to know what's going on in their streets. Right to know. Really? Are you honestly goin' try that one on? I know you know who he is. How would you know that? You're like shit at this. You can't lie, I suppose. It's written all over your face. God, my editor will hump my leg if I bring in this. Look, I'll show the police in a really good light. Police say: "Zero tolerance on vigilante attacks. DCI Spencer Holland closing in on the psycho." Try the salad. You've put weight on since last time. Look who's talkin'. Nice to see you, Jules. Do something, luv. Do something. You can move, let me see 'em. - No. Fuck off! Go get Suzy, yeah! - Fuck you, wanker! Yeah, I'll give you wanker, you slut. Here you go. And, eh.this is off that bloke at the bar, asked me to give it to ya. Oh, no! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Hey, what's going on, bro? Hey, mate. I wasn't. Hey, mate, come on. Please. Please, please, please, please.! Please! Let.me breath. Hey, look, I'm.I'm sorry, yeah! Please! I'm so sorry, I am. What you sorry for? Whatever I've done, I'm sorry, yeah? What? Whatever I did to you, I'm sorry. Please! Please!! - You see, you don't even know, do ya? - We talk. - Huh? - No. And that's the problem. Little pricks like you, running around, burning people alive. And neglect to the emotional devastation you cause. I know who you are. Look, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to, please. Sorry, I'm.No, I'm. everybody's sorry, sorry. Sorry's fuck all! Sorry is a cast-away word on the breath of the hopefuls who have gone too far to right their wrongs. I'll tell you who I am: The last face you're gonna see. No, please. I said I was sorry. Come on, man. Please don't do me like that! Please! I'm a. Please, please!. Please! No, no! Please! Please! Fuck no! Please! Please, please! No! You fuck.motherfucker. you fuck.. Oh, fuck. sake's please! Oh! Fuck! Oh! Oh! All right, just quit! What ya doin'?! Oh, fuck me, I'll talk. Stop!! Stop!! STOP!! You said you got your plate full. some fairly gruesome murders. Nothing I can't handle, sir, we'll get 'im. - You think it's the same person? - Possibly. You think that's a safe assessment? Without a doubt. Why'd you think I became the youngest Chief Superintendent in London? I didn't want to deal with those shits anymore. You know, in 2003, I went to New York on holiday with the missus. The week we were there, the binmen were on strike. You cannot imagine the smell. Picture that size, it was in August, too. Listen, people don't really care or take notice of the binmen. They don't care how they toss out people's rubbish. But the binmen who stop makes you know that, the city starts to stink. Do you understand where I'm getting to with this? I need you to know who you are in this story. I'm the guy cleaning all the shit up to make the streets safer. Well, if you are, you're an idiot. The policeman who thinks he can clean up the streets is a deluded fool. You don't rock the boat. You look after number one. Before you know it, you'll have your own borough. Be nice to be the next Superintendent in London, wouldn't it? Yes, sir. You wrap the gruesome ones quick. You grab the statements, you scrape them off the streets. And you keep the media out. If the Commissioner finds out about this gettin' out, you'll be demoted to Constable before you can say "Katy Price is a virgin." Do you understand? Yes, sir. - Anything else? - No, just the coffee, please. - Can I help you, sir? - I'll have a tea, please. Sure, coming right out. - Bloody cold, isn't it? - Yeah. Do we know each other? I'm gonna need you to hand over everything you've got on 'im. Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen, mate. You see, he belongs to us. not you. Colonel Leach, he does belong to me when he's taking the law into his own hands in my borough. Let me explain something to you. September 2009.we get intel of a major attack being planned for the British mainland on a scale that would make 7/7 look like the Teddy Bear's Picnic. We ran an op to bring in the guy who was planning the attack. Taliban come down on us like piss rain. Worst firefight I've ever been in. We couldn't exit with the prick so we had to get what we needed there and then. It took Vickers 10 minutes alone with the guy to get him to spill his guts. While we were fighting off 30 Taliban, he gives him everything. Afterwards, Vickers executes the prisoner. You see, these people, they don't fear death. They welcome it. So you must ask yourself. how did he get the goods? Now we were in danger of being overrun, so we had to get out of there. No sign of Vickers. He turns up three days later at bastion, not a scratch on him. No one knows how he did it. If he doesn't want to be found, he won't be. He'll finish up on these guys and then he'll vanish. Well, I'll find 'im. because that's what I do. If you lay a finger on my boy, I'll come down on you so hard. they'll need paint stripper to mop you up. Commissioner Shields, I presume. Superintendent Walsh. - Didn't get your name? - Carter. And would that be a Mr. Carter? It'll be a Chief of Staff Carter. Thank you for coming at such short notice, gentlemen. You will forgive a somewhat hasty pace, but we must get into this matter. This man is the subject of an investigation, is he not? Jimmy Vickers, yes sir. He's a suspect in a series of murders. At no point will he be taken into custody. Is that understood? Perhaps we could dispense with the cloak-and-dagger display here and start over, hmm? I'm Commissioner Shields, London Met. And you are? The man who makes sure that you and the rest of this exquisite country are safe every second of every day. We're somewhat embarrassed this individual slipped our grasp, but I assure you, he belongs to us. Your man heading up the investigation will report on the hour. And you will report to us. Is that clear? Just, eh, throw us a bone here, will you? Suffice to say, that he works for a unit within the confines of our military infrastructure that may benefits us with his character profile. He's SAS. It's a problem you do not want on your streets. A problem that only we can deal with. I need him back where he belongs. What.! Open your mouth, open your fuckin' mouth now. Knock on the door, knock on the door, now. Who's there? I don't know what the fuck your problem is. Or who's payin' ya. But I'll triple it, brother. It's in that safe over there. Paid a lot? What's the code? No, no, no. - Let me out first. - Right. Wait! Wait. Twenty-one. Six. Forty-four. Brotha? What the fuck now? What the fuck! Brotha, what the fuck you want? Brotha, talk to me! Talk to me!! What the fuck you want from me? Talk to me. bro! No.no.no.no! Bro. - Sir, did you want to see me about something? - Yeah, I do. Come in, have a seat. Nick, give us the room. Major coincidence is it, that the last officer to access to the files of these two gentlemen, was you. Prior to their deaths, I might add. James Vickers, soldier boy. currently serving in a somewhat shady department of her majesty's forces. MID isn't exactly falling over itself to fill us in, but we understand interrogation is his specialty and would you believe it? They want to know the very moment we apprehend him. Is he done? Or are there more? I need to know who's next. You don't need to know anythin'. All you need to do is stay out of his way. Well, I'm not staying out of anyone's way, mate. I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna lock him up. And whoever he's after, for whatever they've done. The last thing he's gonna do is let you lock him up. He's gonna wipe 'em out. Or die tryin'. "Die tryin" is good enough for me. If he thinks he can go vigilante on my streets, he's got another thing coming. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't care about the law. He only wants one thing. revenge. He'll do more justice in one week than we can do in a year. We? Mr. Griffin, I think we can safely say you ceased being a police officer the moment you started helping your little friend out. Well, good luck finding 'im, then. It might take you a while. But.hey. slow justice is better than no justice. "The UK could face austerity until 2018." Jules, the boardline's "cat stuck in a tree", babe. In it, you've got Morris on your major expense report. Marcus on the tubes strike. Well, that's it, London's quiet. Well, what about these murders? Oh, I've hit a wall on that. There's nothin' ongoing. I thought you had a new lead? Yeah, I'm waiting for more information on it. Don't wait too long, Abby's already sniffin' to snatch it from ya. Whoever you're stitching on, let's have it. Bitch.

Eh, I also think. What? Later. Oh right, right, right. Ohhh. What you want, mate? I wanta go for a drive. Where? Right, right, right. What's that? Sarin. It's most dangerous in any of its other forms. It's a gas. Causes spasms, vomiting. That makes your insides put out their own fire. But this is liquid form. And this.is what I'm goin' put straight into your veins. Makes so much, love, what this is. You're gonna be beggin' to put a bullet inside ya. Look at me. - Any last words? - Fuck you. You feel betta now, do ya, huh? You fuckin' pussy. You feel betta now? - Yeah, a little bit. You? - I will, mate. What? When I see your face in a minute, I'm gonna put so much fuckin' back. What the fuck are you talking about? You got in the back of my car, didn't ya? Thinking you're holding all the cards. You must be fuck-all Jimmy "fuckin" Vickers. How long have we been driving for? Ten.twenty minutes? You didn't know, did ya? Didn't even know what was in the boot of the car. Fucking pricey, wasn't she's, brotha? Popped a good fuckin' plan. - Armed policemen, put it down! - Move it, move it now! - On the floor now! - Move it! Drop it now! Drop it! Wait, wait! I'm gonna give you the count of three, Jimmy. One. Two. You had 'im. Who the fuck do you think you are? You piece of fucking shit. Don't fuckin' touch me. You had 'im in the hospital and you let 'im go. Even though you know what he did, you let him go and he killed his wife. Tell him.tell him you're the reason his wife is dead. -Tell him!! - Alright!! I let him go. I let him go because I knew he'd lead us to this fuckin' psychopath. I mean, I didn't know he was gonna go and do that. But you know what? Shit fuckin' happens. Stand down. What the fuck are you doing? Alpha One to control. The suspect has fled the scene on foot. I say again. The suspect's fled the scene on foot. Roger. We're down. What, you fucking insane? Are you just gonna let him walk? Are none of you gonna arrest him? Alright, Jesus Christ. If you want something done, do it your fuckin' self. Oh, no, no, no, no! Shut the fuck up! Oyi! What the fuck you want, asshole? You gonna do somethin' 'bout this? You've got three seconds, motherfucker. Turn around and walk the fuck back the way you came from. One. Two. Three! Welcome aboard. There we are. There we are, take that. Do you want some more? There, take that one. You'll enjoy throwing those. Look, by the car! I can see his face. Goodbye! Attention, please. Last call. All visitors must leave the ship. Thank you. Have you said a prayer for the journey, Sister? Not yet. I'm so worried about the mixed bathing. Who's that man? I suppose it's the captain. Looks like Ted Heath. - On your own? - Yes. Welcome! - Wave. - Thank you. Wave to your father. One for you. Stop skiving, you bugger. Bye-bye, Dad. All right! Come on. Welcome aboard. Your last orders for streamers. You want me to throw it? - Probably been searching for drugs. - Maybe he's been arrested. You all right? Yes, thank you. - Right, Humphrey, my place or yours? - Bleeding mess! So much for farewell parties. Put that cigarette out! Welcome aboard, sir. Welcome on board. I can't guess what you're going to say to me. Try. "Welcome aboard." You've been on a ship before, haven't you? Welcome aboard. Welcome! - You come to amuse us? - No, I've come to watch you work. That's a joke, for a start. We think it's in the gears. Getting it out now. - Get that damn thing up. - Right, sir. Come on, move yourself, lad. Charlie! My tea, please. Come on, below decks. Haven't got all day. Morning, sir. - Come to eat. - Just a minute. - Come on. - Just a minute! Nancy, come on. Good evening. All passengers are invited to the Atlantic Lounge. where a game of cutthroat Bingo will take place. The caller being yours truly, Mr. Curtain. All the fours, knickers! Little song, little song entitled. I Can't Get Over You, So I'll Have To Get Up and Go Round. Good evening, ladies. This is to remind you that our hairdressing salon is now open. Anthony, our coiffeur, is waiting to give you his personal attention. Thank you. - Mr. Curtain. - Thank you very much. - Madam? - No. For you, madam? How can he eat? Excuse me. Come on, you dogs, walkies. I'll have you in the bloody curry if you don't move. - Jesus! I'm sorry. - No, no. I'm terribly sorry. Are you all right? Not that line there. That line there. Except when you're serving. It's that line there. Now your service. That's it! Mr. Curtain, everybody happy? There's Bingo at 10:00, fancy dress party tonight. - Sister, wait. - Blimey, they're early! 34-31 west, sir. Almost mid-Atlantic. Not bad, considering. Not bad considering the ship's still being rebuilt around our ears. - Morning, Number One. - Morning, Sparky. - Sparky. - Morning, Jim. Latest weather advertisement. It should make the Captain sing with joy. I'll check my theory. Come in. Good morning, sir. Good morning, Number One. Have you brought me some weather? Yes. You know Mrs. Bannister. - My first officer, Mr. Hollingsworth. - Good morning, Mr. Hollingsworth. Did you sleep well? Spasmodically. I see. Chief, Alex here. Look, we persuaded the company to spend £40,000 on new gyros. It might be good fun if they worked, don't you think? What are gyros? - They stop the ship from rolling. - Is that what it said on the wrapper? The company's just bought them. Then the company must have bought them second-hand. We're working on it. What's this drum supposed to be? I don't know, sir. Turned up after the refit. Bloody shipyard! If they'd finished their job in time. we wouldn't be carrying half their garbage over the. Yes, sir! - Leave it with us, sir. - Tell me, how long? The best part of the day. I'm sure the passengers will be thrilled to bits. Thank you, Freddy. My pleasure. I'd offer you some, but there's only two cups. Thank you, I've already had some. Coffee. Is everything going to be smooth and beautiful? Of course! You read the brochure. Slow her down to 16. and notify the office that we'll be in overtime with the New York dock crew. Company's going to moan about that. Chairman's always pleading poverty. That's the chairman's job, isn't it? Thank you, Number One. Wind building. Force 8. Is that rough? Yes. Starboard, 10. Steady on 3. My theory was right. Mrs. Bannister? £5, you owe me. Extortion. Please try and eat something. Christopher! Christopher, breakfast! The pencil's writing again, Daddy. Try to be sensible. What's it say? It says a few hundred pounds. Now, please, be careful, will you. - Yes? - Mr. Nicholas Porter? - Yes, speaking. - Managing Director of the Sovereign Line? Yes, who is this? For the purpose of this, and subsequent conversations. my name is. Juggernaut. I'm ringing about your ship, the Britannic. Yes, what about her? Seven explosive devices. 7,000 pounds of amatol. have been placed aboard your vessel. If she holds her present position, shortly after dawn tomorrow. Britannic's time, she will blow up. The time is 9:16. Exactly six minutes ago. my devices were automatically armed. by clockwork mechanism. They are now live, active. and waiting for the dawn. It follows that I have the information. that will render the bombs harmless. I will give you this information, Mr. Porter. for the very modest sum. of £500,000. I do not wish to see anybody harmed, Mr. Porter. Any loss of life. resulting from your company's refusal to cooperate. will be your responsibility and yours alone. No doubt you will instruct your captain. to make an immediate search for my devices. He will find seven steel drums. Fifty-gallon drums. painted green with a yellow band near the top. Once they are located. no attempt should be made to move them. If the position of any drum is altered. it will explode instantaneously. Any attempt to dismantle any of the devices. will have the same result. An immediate explosion. The devices are booby-trapped in various ways. I need hardly add. that I would not have embarked on an enterprise of this kind. if I were not totally confident. of my own expertise in these matters. I realize you will have to discuss this matter. with your fellow directors. and with the appropriate authorities. You will hear from me. from Juggernaut. within two hours. I will then give you precise instructions about the payment. of the £500,000. To demonstrate my skill and sincerity. I have arranged a small demonstration. which should occur as I am speaking to you. I trust this will cause no serious personal injury. There we are, my old flower. I won't hurt you. Look at this. What a pitiful little bomb. Would you like a biscuit? I can't stand enthusiastic amateurs. I hate to bother you, Skipper. but the radio in the truck's for you. Rather urgent, they say. Got it! This is also. rather urgent. He does say he's an admiral, if that makes any difference. So he's an admiral. So he can get stuffed. It's a big job coming up. Where? Mid-Atlantic, on a liner. I need a holiday. The old firm. the best in the business. The undefeated champion! Knocked out the first round. no contest. Okay, lads. You clean up, we'll go collect our medals. Fallon's the champion! Can we go back in now, please? Doesn't anybody work in this bloody country anymore? Look at that! - Can we really go in? - Can we go back in now? A quick chat to an admiral and then. Yeah, Charlie! Move along. Thank you. Juggernaut's bomb. his so-called demonstration bomb. exploded 20 minutes ago on board. - Damage? - Minor. - Anyone hurt? - One injury. He said dawn tomorrow. What time is that? She's sailing a minimum-speed pattern. That's near 35 degrees west, plus two time zones. Her dawn will come at 6:10, that's 8:10 our time. Which gives us just under 22 hours to find. your "Juggernaut." Is it possible? I'll know that at 8:10 tomorrow. Now, what we're doing is. we're going to set up a special operations center. There's no shortage of manpower. It's time, is the problem. We've got our telephone trace organized. for when he calls again, if he calls. We've gone through our list of possible suspects. That is, all the boys who understand big bangs. Because I lay odds. our friend learned his trade in the Armed Forces. That can only be an assumption at the moment. However, here is our list. I've arranged for the War Office to supply you with their radical list. Arabs, Irish, anarchists. Marder. An explosives ordnance disposal team. under Lieutenant Commander Anthony Fallon. will be on its way to the Britannic in just a few minutes' time. They are under orders to immediately defuse Juggernaut's devices. May I say, for the Sovereign Line, how much we appreciate. the efficiency and urgency that has been shown by the Services. and by the police. My wife and two kids are on the Britannic. Before we move on, I wonder, Mr. Porter. will you please clarify your company's intentions in this matter? Intentions? Your course of action. We intend to wait for Juggernaut's call. note his instructions, and pay the ransom. No. - What would you suggest? - Not paying the ransom. We're well aware of the risks, Mr. Porter. But it is the view of Her Majesty's government. the view, the policy, the determination. to resist extortion by terror. It isn't a hasty decision. It's the result of a long series of similar situations. both at home and abroad. It's a simple question of responsibility. Responsibility to ourselves and to other governments. Responsibility to 1,200 people aboard my ship, that's my responsibility. I take the point, but we can't consider this case in isolation. If you take a broad enough view, you can justify anything. Let us examine the broad view. Sovereign Line. a firm that has received substantial government subsidies. and a £20 million loan. - Do you buy my conscience with a subsidy? - No. But we have the right to your understanding. And if we proceed regardless and pay the ransom? That's your right, in a free democracy. To coin a phrase. The Armed Forces are, of course, obliged to conform to government policy. No opinion. Yes? Mr. Nicholas Porter? Speaking. Managing Director of the Sovereign Line? Juggernaut. How are things aboard your ship? There's been an explosion. Hardly that, Mr. Porter. Not what I call a real explosion. I've seen real explosions, Mr. Porter. They destroy people. It's very important that you understand one thing. The ship has encountered very bad weather. Gales, very heavy seas. There is no way that the passengers can be taken off. Blue Boy Trace. 50 Grosvenor Street. Registered, House of Worth. - Fashion House. - Three blocks. - Blue Force respond. - Too bloody near. How do we defuse the bombs? Here are your instructions. At the Lost and Found counter of Waterloo Station. you will ask for two matched plaid suitcases. bearing the initials D.J.S. In one of the cases, you will find a brown windcheater. In its pocket, a key to locker Number 93. at the West London Air Terminal. These suitcases, and only these. are to be packed with £20 notes. The sum. will be exactly £500,000. The serial numbers on the notes will be random. Someone. not me, of course. will collect the cases from the Air Terminal luggage locker. If any attempt is made to follow him. you will not hear from me again, and your ship. will sink. I said, too bloody near! Crafty sod. Two lines. One feeding in, other feeding out. Dangling us on a wire. If the sea looks too rough, don't be afraid of going under. - The oxygen will keep you alive. - Really? The deeper you are, the safer you are. You're the expert. - First trip? - Yeah. Don't worry. The law of gravity's on your side. Just like falling out of an airplane. Your first trip, too? Yes, sir. Charlie. You don't like boats, do you? No, I bloody don't. - How much longer? - Three hours. - Weather like? - Lousy! But it's getting worse. Two chaps there never even saw parachutes before. Yes, I don't like the smell of this one. Why don't you pack it in, then? Absolutely no chance. Give you the man's name, the man's telephone number. Nice cushy job, working the oil rig. Jump on the oil boom, no risks. Light your own fuses. - and take care of your family. - Why don't you take it? No family. no mortgages and no future. But I do have one small talent. developed to near perfection. Yes, the undefeated champion, are you? I wish it was a talent for playing the violin. All right, Charlie. No! - Mr. Curtain! - I'm sorry. Steady! The next "I Spy" is mine! Despite the inclement weather. the deck tennis tournament will still take place. All passengers wishing to enter. should put their names down on the notice on the bulletin. - Officer. - Yes, sir. Do you mind telling me why we're traveling in circles? - Circles, sir? - A while ago. the waves were coming from the front, now they're coming from the side. It's that kind of sea, sir. North Atlantic, you know. A half-hour ago, the sun was on the port, now it's on the starboard. - Is it that kind of sun? - Must check the steering gear. And about that explosion this morning. Just blowing of Number Two boiler, sir. Buddy, I am by profession a politician. The mayor of a rather large city, as a matter of fact. In my line of work, you have to learn to lie. with remarkable precision. You also have to know how to recognize a lie when it bites you in the ass. And I have just been bitten. I'll. convey your complaint to the captain, sir. Owing to circumstances beyond our control. the ship's pool "How many miles we've traveled during the day". will now no longer take place. Can we have some more money for the fruit machines? We didn't come on this ship to feed fruit machines. - Why did we come? - To be sick. Pardon? David, there's a book over there for you. I spy Ships. Isn't there anything for me? - I think there's a big hole in the ship. - Good! Come in. Tea and toast for madam. - Thank you, but I really don't think. - No, good for you. There's a big hole in the ship, isn't there? No. No hole in ship. All the sailors seem worried. No. Not worried. Everything fine. Be brave. I'm going to spy that hole. Lunch for madam. Thank you. It's very thoughtful of somebody. - You happy in your work? - Very much. It's a good ship? It's my home. Your home won't keep still. I'm born in Africa. Black government doesn't like me, because I'm Asian. Go to England, and white government doesn't like me because I'm Asian. So, my home. - It's a sad world for refugees. - I'm very happy on this ship. I don't believe you. I think you're all very unhappy. and nervous. - What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. It's very bad seas. You ask Captain? I can't go around asking the Captain intimate questions about his ship. Oh, dear, oh, dear! Liverpool playing Chelsea Saturday. Liverpool? We'll bloody murder them! - Bunch of fairies, Liverpool. - Get off! That means the ship's carrying explosives. Give myself 15 points. - Are we supposed to be earthed on a ship? - I don't know. Return to 2-7-0. - Signal to all vessels. - 2-7-0, sir. "Am experiencing difficulties of an extraordinary nature. "Would appreciate assistance if our position can be reached by dawn tomorrow. - "I will sail box pattern." - Right, sir. Some of the passengers are asking questions. - Any specific question? - Why are we sailing in circles? Tell them that we enjoy sailing in circles. That seven men are going to jump into the sea from an airplane. - They'll think I'm joking. - So? - A question. - Yes? Is it still your ambition to be captain of this ship? - May I give you my answer tomorrow? - Answer a question with a question. You ought to be a politician, not a first officer. We'll try launching a boat when our friends show up. Pick up stragglers. In this? You can skipper it, if you like. I'd prefer to take the boat out myself, of course. but you know. Yes. I'll only take two seamen. Don't want to overload it. If we pull this off, I'll change my profession. Politics? The church. Excuse me. All passengers who had their photographs taken last night. may view the photographs. which will be on display very shortly in the table tennis room. Hello! When I tried the haddock today, it came right up my nose. 53. 54. I'll get it. Yes. Radio Room, sir. Your call to Mr. Porter. Scrambler, please. Scrambler. Aye, sir. This is Britannic. Do you hear me? You can do better than that! Sorry. Britannic here. Do you hear me? Over. Alex? Nicholas speaking. Nick. I want the whole picture. What do I tell my passengers? Tell them the truth. And tell them a Naval bomb disposal team will be there within the hour. - An officer called Fallon. - Has the money been laid on? We're not paying, Alex. Not paying? We've looked carefully at the situation. We've taken advice. You didn't ask my advice. Scotland Yard's working for us, the Armed Forces. You didn't ask my advice! Look, we catch the man, disarm the bomb. There's still 16 hours to go. Bloody nonsense! Believe me, Alex, it's a much bigger game than you can imagine. It's 1,200 passengers and crew. Do you know a bigger game than that? You have no alternative but to accept my decision. All right. But it'd better not be your decision. Alex, please. I thought you put your case admirably. Come in. Oh, you. - Please. - I apologize for being me. Go away. Why don't you call me later in the week? All right, let's go. Service Intelligence dug out 112 bomb-design experts. going back to the Boer War. So eliminating dead, aged and infirm, leaves us 46 possibilities. Right. This guy O'Neill looks interesting. - He's inside. Doing 10 years. - Down the Scrubs, isn't he? He's very clever. He's Irish. Now, we'll check he's inside. No. - I'll check he's inside. - He might be able to point a finger. You've got the London list, and you've got the politicals. How did he get the bombs on the ship? That's what I don't understand. No security, that's why. Check what comes off the ship, but not what goes on. Bloody dockyard thieves, rivets for brains. Why don't you piss off? - Good luck, Brownie. - Yes, thanks. Look, I'm sorry. - What? - About the wife and family. You heard what Skinner said. Stuff it. It's all a bloody lottery, anyway. Look, David. There's an airplane. She's a big bastard, isn't she? - Move out the davits. - Aye, aye, sir. Now I understand the circles. What? Is it dropping the mail? You! - Okay, sir. - Lower away. Down. Take her over to the port side. I'll try, sir. Try to hold her steady. Keep her head into it. Hercules, this is Britannic. Hercules, this is Britannic. Over. Britannic this is Hercules. Over. When your men are ready to jump, we'll try to give them a smooth sea. I'll make a lee off our port beam. Do you read? Over. Yes, I read you, Britannic. Over. We've launched our pick-up boat about 500 yards off our port quarter. Do you see her? Over. Yes, we see her, Britannic. Over. - You're a good navigator, aren't you? - Good? I'm a perfect navigator. Are you a good jumper? Stay and watch. - Turn 1-8-0. - 1-8-0, sir. 1-8-0, helmsman. This is my second trip. and I've never seen anything like it before. All right, chaps. Double somersault with a twist. Try not to think about it. Green light. Good luck, jumpers. Christ! Bloody mask! Bring her around. Help! Let go the ladders. Ladders away, sir! So many. All right, lads. Stick together. Don't wander away. Swim under the waves. He looks like my Action Man. - It is Action Man. - It isn't. Head for the boat. The current will pull us back. What? He's going down. Yes. Go get him! Kick! Kick, you bastard! Come on. You're not there yet, lads. Take it easy. I don't want to lose any of you now. Man overboard! - Aren't you going back for him? - It's impossible! It's not a car. We have a 5-mile turning circle. When we get back, he'll be gone. Fallon. Hardy. Welcome to Britannic, sir. Great! Get off, it's my go! It's mine. .that they are bombs. It could be a hoax. Second, if they are bombs. then the Navy will see to the defusing. Commander Fallon is a skilled and experienced man. leading a skilled and experienced team. Inevitably, certain sections of the ship will be sealed off. But because of the refit, we're all used to that, anyway. The situation in London is that Scotland Yard. has got the investigation well in hand. Now if there are any questions. How long until dawn, Captain? A good 12 hours. Plenty of time. Captain, without being an alarmist. we're sailing on a ship that might hypothetically be blown up. And the sea is so strong, it's too rough for the lifeboats. That's about it, isn't it? Yes, that's about it. Thanks for your candor, Captain. Just wanted a clear picture for my wife's diary. - What's he smiling at? - Well, that's all. Thank you very much for listening to me. What's that? - Sorry. - Sorry. Go on. What do we do? - I'm taking two sleeping tablets. - There's not much you can do, is there? I've lost them again. As I was saying, before I was so politely interrupted. Tonight's fancy dress ball will continue as per program. and as if nothing had happened! Are we downhearted? Just a little. Shall we go? If anyone wants costumes, I'm the fellow to see. Sparks, would you consider bringing Mr. Fallon's unit up to strength? Sir? Your skill in electronics makes you an obvious choice. Now do you understand? Well, I. I see the problem, but. I'm sorry. I think you're just doing all of this to impress me. I'm impressed. "'Come into my parlor,' said the spider to the fly. "Off went the plate, in came the fly. "She was glamorously and amorously molested." Let's listen to it. - I'm looking for your skipper. - He's down the line. He's got his own little problem. - You've lost one of your men. - Right. I've been detailed to take his place. Volunteered. Welcome. - What's the plan? - Haven't got a clue. Have you got any ideas? Commander. There she is, my fearful beauty. Alive and well, and living in sin. Commander, Captain's briefed the passengers and crew. - He'd like to speak to you. - Charlie. - Skipper? - The clock's suspended in the shaft. And the stopper won't reach? Try the scope. How do we break in? Not through the plate, for a start. I'll bring you back some dry toast, Charlie. Marvelous cure for sea-sickness. blind terror. Where are the kids? Asleep, theoretically. They might be helping the Navy. What are we supposed to do? I might dance naked at the ball tonight. That could raise a laugh. My husband wouldn't allow that. Neither would my shape. - Where is your husband? - London. He's a humane policeman. He sent us all off to visit my sister in the States. Relax. unwind. Theoretically. Have you got anybody? Husband. two men. maybe three. I'm not sure I've got anybody. Go down with the ship, it'll be three lines in the Philadelphia Inquirer. I might get drunk. - Does that idea appeal to you? - Just a quick one. You know, responsibilities. - It's like the poem. - Which one? Not Waving But Drowning. O'Neill, W. Hello, Johnny. Major. Thanks. Who's been blowing up what? - What makes you think anyone has? - Well, I. Can't be friendship. You wouldn't be dragging me from my bedtime cocoa like this, would you? Right. I want to know who's active on the sea. Yes. Well, now. I'm not a grass, I don't point fingers. You must be pretty desperate. Yes, I am. - Lives at stake. - Yes. Let me see, I've done three years. That leaves seven to go. Seven to go with a bit of luck, and a decent Home Secretary. I don't care, Johnny. I really don't care who gets blown up. I might know a few things. Might tell you lies, tantalize you a bit. But I don't really care that much. It's all up here in my head. And that's where it's staying. Thanks. Can you plug this into the amp? I wish you wouldn't do that. Can't get it in. - Everything all right, Mr. Curtain? - A night to remember. Can you hold the plug a minute? We're short on squeakers because one of the cupboards has been sealed off. but in times of crisis. One squeaker between two answer your problem? That's why you're a first officer. I wish you wouldn't do that, cock! All bombs below the water line, except this one here, by the galley. And if they all explode together? One big hole. you sink. Fuel tanks under, but they can be emptied. No critical gear. Yes, that's where we'll start. Just one little hole. That's the one we play with first. If my ship were an aircraft in the sky. there'd be no question of playing with her life. We'll try cutting a hole into the drum. My employers would be on every street corner. looking for someone to hand their money to. - At least we can contain the blast. - This is still my ship. It's my ship now, Captain. At least until dawn tomorrow. Or maybe earlier. Will you join me? Here's to your ship. I'm sorry for your troubles, but I do have a few of my own. To the insanity of governments. and the insanity of people who oppose them. And the poor simple sods who have to pick up the pieces. He's clever, your Juggernaut. Try "obsessed." You're all obsessed. Might even save your life, Captain. my obsession. There are seven bombs. How do you know he built them all the same? If he didn't. you will be one of the first to know. Funny place to find you, Mr. Baker. Just filling in. Always work for skillful hands. Filling in between what? If it's about bombs, explosives, things that go bang. - It is. - Then excuse me. I only work abroad. And my last job was for the Foreign Office. They didn't tell you. They promised to take my name off the list. You can't trust anybody these days. Complete details of your movements. - When? - Today for starters. Give us the right answers, you might get your name off that list. Nancy. - Nancy, where's David? - Think he went for something to eat. - Have you seen my son? - No, madam. He might be in the dining room. Dining room closed. I go look. Thank you. It's hardened steel. It's going to vibrate a lot. Can't be helped. Anything is better than going in the front door. - Want to give it a go? - All right. - Okay, Alf, give it a go. - Okay. Okay? Off we go. Make sure these adjusters are right flat against the side of the drum. Okay? Very gently now. That's it. Okay. If you were Juggernaut, Charlie. how would you prevent us from doing what we're about to do? Install a trembler switch. One bit of vibration and up she'd go. Beaten before we start. The ship's engine would set it off. Not if he turned the switch coarse enough. That's it, Charlie. That's it, my boy. That's the catch. Now let's see how clever this Juggernaut really is. Why don't you go and get sick, Charlie? Come on. Come on. Good luck. - Bridge. - Navy's rig. Seal us off. - All clear. - Okay. Closing 10. David! Come on! Closing 12. Come on. Christ! All sealed. Good luck. We're off. - What are you doing down here? - You're talking funny. Okay, Alf. Cutter on. Cooling liquid on! Bridge. Steward Azad. We're shut in the kitchen corridor! They're cutting the bomb open! Christ! There's someone down there. Open all doors. We are carrying explosives! Go on! Go on! Charlie, the emergency! Turn it off! You want to be more careful. Nice cases, them. You've been retired four years, Mr. Buckland. Is it four years already? Anyway, at the end, they took me away from the action. and sat me at a drawing board. I was designing torpedoes. I was never a drawing-board man. - Do you have a job now? - No. I have a modest pension. for services to the nation. How have you spent today? Early-morning walk with the chap next door. This afternoon, gardening. I was in the garden with him. Do I count as a witness? Excuse me. Was it some espionage job? Somebody gone over to the Russians? Something like that. Any joy? No, he's clean, that one. We've checked all the explosive geniuses. all except two, who've gone missing. One of those two? Quiet, please. Rigoletto to you, cock. It could be those two. It could be one of a dozen others. Just don't have time to check their alibis. We're going to lose, aren't we? Our two lousy suitcases. That's the score, so far. Well? Two seamen, a bomb-squad member drowned. Another squad member and a ship's steward killed in the explosion. Fallon's going to try entering the device through the faceplate. That's all. So much for the Navy! Scotland Yard? You say you've got the £500,000 available. Yes, we made contingency plans. If I were you, I'd pay up. We've got the cases in the office. What, precisely, is Fallon attempting to do? He'll take up position at one of the bombs, alone. and sealed off. His chief petty officer, Braddock, will be at another drum, here. There'll be telephone communication between them. Fallon will make the initial dissection. Each successful step will be passed to Braddock and duplicated. - Supposing Fallon's killed? - Braddock will take over. He will diagnose the mistake, carry on from there. Ad infinitum, I suppose. Mr. Porter, a man made those bombs, a man like us. like Fallon. It's purely a technical problem. I thought you were going to say a technical "exercise." A chance to use your diplomatic expertise. People are dead! Is that a technical problem? Shouting doesn't help. I know I must control myself. and not question government policy in a loud voice. I must write to the families of the dead asking them not to question the policy. This time tomorrow, I could be duplicating 1,200 copies of a letter. to 1,200 families, asking them not to question government policy! I'll pay the money. - I shall convey your remarks to the Minister. - Yes! I can imagine! Delivered in beautiful, measured, Whitehall prose! I can't predict the consequences. These are the consequences. We're living through them! Tell him to stuff his subsidies. Good. I've just been blown up by a bomb, Dad. In my pajamas. Yes, all right. Now you go back to bed. Okay? Good night. I think he made the amatol in his bathtub. I still don't. - May I? - Please. I'm sending for the money. Good! Bridge, Captain here. Fallon, in position. Closing off. No balls-up this time. Closed until I say so. Or until my chief says so. - Understood? - Understood. And, Captain. ask your driver to keep my room still. - All ahead, dead slow, both. - All ahead, dead slow. - With me, Charlie. - I'm with you, Skipper. You sound terrible. You were a bit late with the dry toast. Looking at six slotted bolts. One top, one bottom, two either side. I'm looking. I think we'll start at the top. It's good policy. That's what he wants us to think. Right. Let's try the bottom for choice. I wouldn't have their job for. At this moment I'd trade them even. The radio officer said he was patching us to London. Anybody listening? This is the Overseas Service of the BBC. Today, Princess Anne fell off her horse. Hello, Tony. This is Jeff Marder. We'll be following along, okay? That's a great bloody help. Clear off the line, Jeff. Give a man a bit of privacy. Don't wander too far. - Charlie. - Skipper. Screwdriver is in the first slot. I'm going to work my way around, clockwise. If there's a detonator behind any of them. I'll be suddenly shocked by my own mortality. Still trying number one. It's tight. If at first you don't succeed, don't make a bloody fool of yourself. Putting spanner on screwdriver. Can you still hear me breathing? I thought you were snoring. I'm supposed to be the comedian of the group. Number one's loosened. Okay. Trying number one. Just loosen it. Don't take it out. No chance. Because the gang's all here Zing, boom, tararrel Ring out a song of good cheer Now's the time to roll the barrel All together! Because the gang's all here Waiter! Will you tell me the truth if I ask you a question? Personal, business, or just plain silly? Personal. Have you ever been unfaithful to me? If I chose to lie. I could do so with remarkable dexterity. You know that, don't you? Since we met. yes. Since we have been married, no. And if we're going to die. I rejoice in the fact. that we're going to die together. Waiter! - Can we stay up late? - As late as you like. Waiter! Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Before the bandstand revolves to bring you music for the younger dancers. one last dance from the orchestra, a good-old good one. which I personally will demonstrate at no extra charge. "The Lambeth Walk." Thank you, Professor. Sod them. Waiter. Two double scotches in the same glass. Staff. - Lovely party. - Amazing. Look, he's come as a dog. Cheers. Cheers. Should have been playing the Palladium this week. I failed the written test. I think you're doing very well. Don't patronize me, darling. - I'm sorry. - Forget it. I joined as court jester to smooth things out in times of crisis. Overlooked the fact that I'd be just like all the others. Shit scared. Maybe all we want to do now. is to hold each other. I'll give you an estimate. If these hairy youths get their fuse wires sorted out. may I have a dance? I thought you'd never ask. Waiter! Civilization must be preserved. They're all dancing. - They don't know. - Of course they know. - Number six is loose. - Okay, I'm following, sir. Don't even know the man, and he's trying to kill me. Haven't I told you about death? It's nature's way of saying you're in the wrong job. Now let's see what is hidden behind the bolts. Did I ever tell you that you're a good man, Charlie Braddock? Not when you're sober, sir, no. - May you inherit the earth. - Six feet of it, I should think. No springs. I'm going to take off the plate. I'm going to infrared. Looking for a light-activated trigger. - Still there, Charlie? - Yes, Skipper. The light's off. Save the last dance for me. Here we all are, comfy in the dark. Starting to remove the bolts. Bottom, going clockwise. One. Two. Easy. Three. I'm a little champion. Four. Five. There we are. Nice and easy. Six. All right, Charlie. This is it. Be careful with the plate. Doesn't want to move. You okay? We should have been burglars. We'd have made a fortune. There's the little spider! Photoelectric cell, upper left quadrant. You're quite right. The unfriendly bastard is trying to kill us. Light going on, now. First bit of white light strikes this, and you'd be the new head prefect. Complicated lash-up. Something's moving. A sort of tape. You're a clever man, Juggernaut. Rightful contender. Lower front section. some kind of fuse panel. Not nice, that. Open invitation respectfully refused. Off you go, Charlie. Follow the yellow brick road. Right. "In his master's steps he trod." I'm going to the scanner. Bottom first, right? The first of the two normally closed relays, according to my safe-ammeter. there's no current in the top blue wire, or the white. Jeff here. The relay on the left is some sort of trigger mechanism. On no account cut the red wire before isolating the relay contacts. I may be stupid, but I'm not bloody stupid. Let's have a little look in here. There's half a dozen triggers hidden away in here. All to be cut through before we reach the timer. Starting to cut. Follow me through, Charlie. - Right side relays. - I'm following. Heads up! Starting to cut the top blue wire now. Top blue. Now the white. White. Green. Got it. And the bottom blue. Brilliantly analyzed. Bottom blue. Got it. Ready to isolate left side relay contacts. Plastic strip should do it. Slipping in between the contacts. Downhill, this bit. Captain, didn't you give my message to your driver? Charlie! Station 8! - Damage report. - On its way, sir. Damage Control Party, report to Station 8. Sprinkler system's activated in main ballroom. - Taking water, sir! - Watertight doors still closed. Steady now. Wounded on the starboard side. Bring the seas to port. Come port to 0-8-0. Tony, what's happened? Charlie's bomb happened. Pay the man his money. Flight Number 626 to Dusseldorf. is departing from Gate 4. Passengers who have not checked in, please go to Desk O. The coach for KLM Flight 102 to Rotterdam. is departing from Gate 10. Passengers who have not checked in for this flight. please go to Desk O. British Airways Flight 568 to Zurich. is departing from Gate 10. Passengers who have not checked in. please go to Desk O. You'll need those for your luggage. All right? Thank you very much. Yes. Just pop them down. Thank you. Have you a ticket? Thirty pounds overweight. To Dublin, that's £14.50 to pay, sir. What? Excess baggage, £14.50 to pay. - That's not in the script. - No, something's wrong. I'll have to. I haven't got the money. Get him! Yes? Nicholas Porter, Managing Director of Sovereign Line? You know bloody well it is. Cancel all our previous arrangements, Mr. Porter. Consider the matter closed. Funny voice he has. What about his face? Did he have a funny face? I haven't seen his face. I never met the fella, have I? Tell us about it, come on. Rang me up. Said he heard I might be interested in a job. Dead simple. Pick up some cases. Check them in at the counter. £50 on account. And £50 later. No questions. Simple. So I got the first £50 in an envelope, through the door. with a key. instructions. Then you know what happened. It was a lash-up, wasn't it? Why didn't you take the £50 with you? I'd spent it, hadn't I? I blew a great big hole in your ship, Captain. I better give it back to you. Drink? There's a message. How much did the man ask for? £500,000? Give it to him. He's not even greedy. £500,000 for your fine ship? Read that. You couldn't even buy a decent trawler at that price. Read that, Mr. Fallon. "Negotiations have broken down." There's only one answer for that sort of mentality. You have to go back to the bombs. Persuade me. 1,200 lives. Lives? Not many lives, that. I mean, not in the great scheme of things. Remember what the goldfish said? "There must be a God! "I mean, who changes the water?" Specks in the universe, Captain. Launch your lifeboats. You've seen the conditions out there. If we launch the lifeboats, half of them won't survive. The thoughts of death do not impress me, Captain. I've thought of nothing else all my working life! My trade is survival! Get through the next 24 hours! All right, I know. other people do it, too. but I suffer from it in a more extreme form. Fallon, stop drinking. I'm ordering you. You don't give the orders. That good and gifted man who planted the bombs. gives the orders. Charlie was a good and gifted man. Sometimes it. Sometimes it. happens. Just like that, Captain. The tea break is over. You can generally see where I've been. All right, lads, back to work. One apiece. - The sorcerer's apprentice. - Yes, sir. You've got a chance to make a name for yourself, posthumously. All right, how far did Charlie go? What was his last move? Relay contacts. Inserting a strip of plastic between. the relay contacts. Jesus. There's a wire. Just a thread. I can hardly see it. The contacts are electrically closed. Charlie's strip must have broken the wire. - What's your next procedure? - Shut up, Jeff! Clamping the contacts. It's very delicate. I want silence. Don't go too far, Jeff. Here we are. We're doing useful work after all, Charlie. What's the point of being afraid? We've lived on borrowed time long enough. Come on. That's the boy. Now. Observe the control. and the restraint. You're a good man, Juggernaut. But so am I. So is Fallon. A good man. Lighting up. There's some kind plate at the back. A moving tape counter. I'm going to cut it. I'm sorry, Tony, Jeff again. How's the counter connected? Connected to sweet bloody nothing! Icing on a cake. Well. it's getting early. Time Fallon was asleep. Cutting now. He's a bloody comedian! Everybody laughing? The bells of hell go tring-a-ling-a-ling Removing the mounting plate. Should find the timing device behind it. Watch when you remove the mounting clips. Don't worry. I'm getting used to his style. First one loose. There's something about his brush strokes. Finding the second. And his tone of voice. Here we go now. Second free. Now. I'm lowering the circuit board. Back to square one, gentlemen. Another booby-trap and I'm the booby. Bridge! I want paint remover. Gallons of it. And I want it fast, to every bomb station. Clear the engine room. - Malicent. - Finish with the engines. quick as you can. Understood. Good luck, sir. Jeff. or anyone listening in London, I've seen this same hilarious trick before. Only once, during the Blitz. German land mine. The real entrance is around the side. Go in the front door, there's a rude message. Now, whoever built the German bomb built this one. Superintendent McCleod, police. Juggernaut's voice was English. I don't care if it was the Queen Mum. Whoever built the German horror built this one. How do we check? How do we find out? I was working with Sid Buckland. I was on his team. Go see Sid, and tell him that young Fallon. is in the fertilizer again. I remember it very well. Brilliant piece of design. We sought out the designer after the war. Werner Sterne. electrical engineer. Frankfurt. I regret to inform you that Mr. Sterne died in Munich 11 years ago. Found this upstairs. Bingo! Different sort of metal. It'll cut. High-speed drill. - Won't it set off the trembler fuse? - It's a coarse trembler. Fine drill. If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. And then what would become of us? Off you go, Digby. I'll see you when I've discovered the secret of the universe. Tony, your German designer's dead, but they've found Juggernaut. Buckland. - I've got to get on with this. - Just before you go. That trick land mine, how was it fused? We never found out. Ran like thieves. Blew up three blocks. The blast broke my leg. Everything was burning. Buckland dragged me out. Starting to drill. Are we winning? Two hours to go. They still haven't reached the fusing mechanism. Two hours. Fingers move. "Move," I say. and they move. I give the order "smile," and I do. I shall miss all that. - What's this thing he can't reach? - The fusing mechanism. The secret of it all? Yes. Two hours to reach your fusing mechanism. and you must get on with your master's business. If it's any consolation, Fallon tells me. that 1,200 deaths don't matter. A speck of dust in the eye of the universe. Something about goldfish. 1,000, 1,200, 1,400, I'm with him there. But one. you can care about one person, Alex. Is there someone? Yes. And is it me? You're wanted. Fallon's found the fuse. He's afraid the bomb's going to blow. - All passengers stand by lifeboats. - Lifeboats, sir. There are two wires from the top of the detonator. One red, one blue. One fires the detonator. Thus the big bang. I'm afraid I don't know what the other one does. Trembler switch. I'm putting it back. Easy, Fallon. Get me Buckland. I think you better put this on, sir. - I can't swim! - That's why you're wearing it. The ships out there'll have you before you get your feet wet. - Officer. - Yes, sir? I've just been bitten again. Will the sea be very cold? In my professional opinion. not hot. And it will ruin your hair. In your professional capacity, you're supposed to be cheering us up. There aren't any icebergs. Correction. Fallon, this is London Control. - Tony, this is Jeff speaking. - Where's Buckland? He's with the police. He doesn't want to talk about the bombs. I want Buckland. The time is 6:01. The mission is terminated. Like hell it is. I know how he's done it. It's just one small step. I'm nearly there. It's 6:02. Take your men above decks. My men will stay on till they've done what they came aboard to do. Now stop pissing about and get me Buckland! Why? I can't explain what they did to me, not in official police jargon, that is. - Who are they? - They teach you how to dismantle bombs. save lives. But they didn't pay you enough, so you learn how to design bombs. Taking lives, that pays much better. And then one day you're old, and they give you a miserable pension. I'm still good at my job. Fallon refuses to leave. He insists on talking to Buckland. I'll talk to Fallon. And you think we should give way to people like that? You make people like that. It's all right, Tony, he's coming. Hello, Sid. This is Tony Fallon. If we're still on speaking terms, that is. I'd like to apologize right here and now. for whatever it is I did. Buckland. It's a joyous noise. I'm sorry it's you, Fallon. I'm sorry it's me, as well. I thought you'd taught me everything I knew, Sid. But there's a missing link. that's making me a little nervous. I know you remember being nervous. Bear with me, Sid. There's a red wire, and a blue wire. One trips off the detonator. The other is a booby trap, the sucker punch. Now that's perfectly diagnosed, wouldn't you say? Perfect. Time's pressing, Sid. I think in about three minutes. I'm going to cut the blue wire. My lads will wait. If I go in the wrong way. they'll know what to do. Am I right? Is it the blue wire, Sid? Two minutes. Sid, it's too late to run. And furthermore. I freely acknowledge that you are still the governor. And one other point. I'm very frightened. And I know you remember, precisely, what I'm feeling. All for the sake. of one word, Sid. "Red". or "blue." Cut the blue wire. Cut the blue wire. Red, lads! Cut the red. R-E-D, red! Fallon is the champion. I didn't know what to do. I'll take you down and get you a drink. What, at 6:00 in the morning? - You want one? - Thanks very much. Here's my day, so far. Went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked. Pretty good. Still, things could be a lot worse. Oh, that's right, I'm falling to my death. Guess they can't. How did it all come to this, you ask? My end starts at the beginning. The very beginning. Yes, that's me. I had a fairly standard childhood. I came from what you might call, a broken home. Literally, broken. I was eight days old and still living How sad is that? Clearly it was time to move on. Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you. And here is your binkie. You are destined for . I didn't quite hear that last part. But it sounded important. Destined for, what? I set out to find my destiny. Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea. That was the day I met, Mr. Goody-two-shoes. And our glorious rivalry, was born! Could this be what I was destined for? A dream life filled with luxury? Apparently not. Even fate makes its favorite soup. No big deal. A much different fate awaited me. A baby. How thoughtful. Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you. Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home. Can we keep him? A place that taught me the differences between right and wrong. Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand, had life handed to him on a silver platter. Our baby can fly. - Yes, yes - And that was not the best The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair. But I had something far, far greater, My amazing intellect. A knack for building objects of mayhem. After a few years, and with some time off for good behavior. I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning. At a strange place called shh-ool. It was there that I once again ran into Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes. He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft-headed groupies. He bought their affections with showmanship, So I too would make this 'popped-corn' and win over those mindless dregs. Lights out! That's when I learned a very hard lesson. Good receives all the praise, adulation. While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner. So a fitting end wasn't really an option. While they were learning the itsy bitsy spider. I learned how to dehydrate animate objects. And rehydrate them at will. Someday's it felt like it was just me and Minion, No matter how hard I tried. I was always the odd man out. The last one picked. The screw-up. black sheep. Bad boy. Oh! Was this my destiny? Wait! Maybe it was. Being bad is the one thing I'm good at. Then it hit me. If I was the bad boy. Then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all. I was destined to be a super villain. And we were destined to be rivals. The die had been cast. And so began an enduring epic, life long career. And I loved it. Our battles quickly got more elaborate. He would win some, I would almost win others. He took the name, Metro Man. Defender of Montrosity. I decided to pick up something a little more humble. Megamind. Incredibly handsome criminal genius, and master of all villainy. MEGAMIND Read on your own time. Open up. Hey! BOO! Oh, good morning, Warden. Great news, I'm a changed man. And I'm ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen. You're a villain, and you're always be a villain. You'll never change. And you'll never leave. - You're fun. - You got a present in the mail. Is it a puppy? From Metro Man. To count every second of your 85 life sentences. That's funny, never thought Metro Man was the gloating type. Oh but he does have nice taste. I think I'll keep it. Any chance you could give me the time? I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man museum. Oh no, looks like you're By several thousand years. Oh, am I? Happy Metro Man day, Metro City. It's a beautiful day downtown where we're here to honor a beautiful man. Metro Man. His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean. For years he's been watching us Saving us with his super strength, and caring for us with his super heart. Now it's our turn to give something back. This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum. Wow, okay, the stuff they make you read on the air. That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy. I wrote that piece myself, Hal. What I was trying to say was, I can't believe that in our modern society they let like actual art get onto the news. - Nice save, Hal. - What are we, like lets just get Come on, it's time to get in the Metro Man day spirit. Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time. That's the first thing. That's sweet of you. And I'd be watching you, like a dingo watches a human baby. - Mmm. - Okay, that sounded, Okay that A little bit, yeah. And you're making your face, and that's making me feel weird. Not love, we're not in love. I'm not saying I love you. Okay, I love you, whatever. I'm not saying I'm in love with you. I'm saying. Roxanne? Roxaroo? Get back to work. The city doesn't pay you to loaf. - Freeze! - Whoa, what are you doing, guys? It's ME! Hey, open up. Oh, you fools. He's tricked us. You were right. I'll always be a villain. <i>Bad to the bone. Bad to the bone.</i> <i>B..B..B..Bad. B..B..B..Bad.</i> <i>Bad to the bone.</i> Well hello good looking, need a lift? Certainly do, you fantastic fish you. Get in the car, you. Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion. You got it, boss. All right, put your hands in the air. Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man. And. Metro Men. Hey, Metro City! Give me some, come on give it now. Give it to me. What? Give it to me. all right! Yo, hey, ha, ha yo. Hey, Metro city. Hello, hey. You know, you actually want to bring it down a bit. Boys, a little lower. Thank you fellows. Let's get real for a moment. That's right, that's right ha, ha, that's right. Although getting a whole museum is super cool. Super cool, you want to know what the greatest honor you've given me is? Do you really want to know? Really? Then I'll tell you. The greatest honor you've given me is letting me serve you. To help these people of Metro city. And at the end of every day. Well. I often ask myself. Who would I be, without you? I love you Metro Man! And I love you, random citizen. I tell you Minion, there's no place like evil lair. I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir. How do I look, Minion? - Do I look bad? - Disgustingly horrifying, sir. You always know what to say. All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir. Did you miss your daddy? Whose the menacing little brains? You are, yes you are. Uh, uh! No biting, no, no, no. - No, no, no. You want the wrench? Go get the wrench. Now, back to work. She's awake, Quick, to work. - Miss Ritchi, we meet again. - Would it kill you to wash the bag? You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi. I'm afraid no one can hear you. Wha..why isn't she screaming? Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind. Like this. AHHHHH! That's, that's a poor ladies scream. AHHHHH! Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website, where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials? Actually most of it comes from an outlet store in. Don't answer that. .Romania. Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey reporter skills, on your weak little mind to find out all our secrets. Such tricks. won't work. on me. - Please talk slower - Temptress. What secrets? You're so predictable. Predictable, predictable? Oh, you call THIS predictable? Your Alligators, yes. I was thinking about it on the way over. What's this? BOOM! - In your face. - Cliché. No, look, watch. Juvenile. - Shuck it all! - Tacky - Oh, so sorry. - Seen it. - What's this one do? - Garish. Okay, the spiders new. Spider? Ee, Uh, yes! The *spee..ider*. Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus Will instantly paralyze. OW! Get it off! - Ow! - Forget it Megamind. Your plans never work. Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we? OOOWWW! It is a great pleasure that I present to Metro Man, this new museum. If you please. Hey! Uh, my kid can't see. - Megamind. - Oh, bravo Metro Man. Booooo! Yes, I can play along too. Booooo. Should have known you'd try to crash the party. Oh, I intend to do more than crash it. This is the day you and Montrosity, shall not soon forget. It's pronounced Metro City! Oh, potato, tomato, potato, tomato. We all know how this ends. With you behind bars. Oh, I'm shaking in my custom baby seal-leather boots. You will leave, Montrosity. Or this will be the last you ever hear of, Roxanne Ritchi! - Huh? - Roxanne! - Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way. - I'm not panicking. In order to stop me, You need to find me first, Metro Man. We're at the Metroman observatory. Ah ha, no we're not! Don't listen to her, she's crazy. Metro Man approaching, sir. - HAH! - Hah, hah! Hah, hah, hah. Hold on a second. Oh, good heavens. You didn't think you were at the real observatory, did you? Ready the death ray, Minion. Death ray, readying. Over here, old friend. In case you haven't noticed, You've fallen right into my trap. You can't trap justice. It's an idea, a belief. Even the most heartfelt belief, can be corroded with time. Justice is a noncorrosive metal. But metals can be melted by the heat of 're-vange'. It's 'revenge' and it's best served cold. But it can be easily reheated, in the microwave of evil. Well I think your warranty is about to expire. Maybe I got an extended warranty? Warranties are invalid if you don't use the product for it's intended purpose. Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty. Can I go home now? Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand the full concentrated power of the. SUN! FIRE! Minion, fire. Uh, it's still warming up, sir. - Come again? - Warming up, sir. Warming up? The sun is warming up? One. sssecond. more. Aaannnd.. jussst. Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap, tip top more. And we are ready, in just. Oh! I told you to have things running. Told you out of the sounds. Why do you always blame me? My spider bite is acting. Your plan is failing, just admit it. Yeah, good luck with that one. Whose side are you on? The losing side. - Thank you. - Uh, could someone stamp my You of all people, know that we discontinued that promotion. - Ta, ta all. - Same time next week? What did he just say? Crab nuggets? Good lord, I'm trapped. What kind of trickery is this? You mad genius. Your dark gift has finally paid off. It, it has? This dome is obviously lined with copper. - Yeah, so? - Sir! Copper drains my powers. Your weakness is copper? You're kidding, right? I don't think even he could survive that. Well, lets not get our hopes up just yet. - Look! - Metro Man. Metro Man. Metro Man! AHHH! Oh god! Oh my god, oh! Ewwww. You did it, sir. I did it? He did it. I did it. He did it. - You did it, sir. - I did it! - You did it. - I did it! Montrocity is mine! You did it sir, you did it, sir. Yes you did. All right people, hit it. Hit it! <i>Living easy, living free.</i> <i>Season ticket on a one way ride.</i> <i>Don't need reason, dont need rhyme</i> <i>- Ain't got nothing I'd rather do. - Drop 'em.</i> <i>Going down, party time My friends are gonna be there too,</i> <i>I'm on the Highway to.</i> - Highway.. - La, la, la, la, la. - Highway.. - Ahh, ahh, ahh.. First off, what a turnout. How wild is this, huh? All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe. Are there any questions? Come on..yes? You in the back. I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us. And the city. Good, I'm glad you asked that one. Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying evil thing you could possibly think of. And multiply it by. SIX! In the mean time I want you to carry on, Normal people do. Let's just have fun with this, come on. And I will get back to you. Now slam the door, really hard. They can. they can still see you. - Now? - Yeah, you're still there. - Oh, - Let's get going. <i>There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.</i> Ahh, Minion. Did you think this day would ever come? No way, not at all, sir. Never, never in a million, not even. Yes, I did. Look at the intricate moon links. I'm looking, I'm looking. And what's this? Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair. But it seems to only carry one station. Oh, that sir is called a window. - Window. - All the kids are looking through them. Oooo, I've never had a view before. Montrosity Minion, it's all mine. If my parents could see me now. Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven. Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out of the way. I can have, everything I want! And there's no one to stop me. All aboard! Ha, ha, haaaa. <i>Mental wounds healing, Driving me insane.</i> <i>I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.</i> <i>I'm going off the rails, on a crazy train.</i> <i>We may as well go home, as I did on my own.</i> <i>Alone again, naturally.</i> <i>To think that only yesterday.</i> <i>I was cheerful bright and gay.</i> <i>Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do, the role I was about.</i> I know, I know.

What's your vacuum like? <i>Going off the rails, on a crazy train, sir.</i> Hey, hey, hey! Not now, Minion. I'm in a heated existential discussion with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy. I. is something wrong, sir? Just think about it. We have it all. But we have nothing. It's just to easy now. I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir. - I mean, we did it, right? - Well, you did it, sir. Yes you've made that perfectly clear. - Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly? - Huh? Unhappy. Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow, we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi. That always seems to lift your spirits. Good idea, Minion. But without him, what's the point? - Him, sir? - Nothing. Okay, um, all right well just uh, thats uh, something to consider and um, well, I think I'll just power down for a while then. He was always there for us. Dependable. Perhaps we took him for granted. Maybe we never really know how good we have it, until it's gone. We miss you, Metro Man. I, miss you. And I have just one question for, Megamind. Are you happy now? This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a city without a hero. Coming up next. Are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know. Aaannd wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas. - 'Cause we're done. - Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal. Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party at my house. Coming off the hook, or whatever. You should come over. I got a DJ rented a bouncy house. Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick. Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really fell like being around a bunch of people. No, no, no. That's why it'll just be, like you and me. Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting. - But, - I did hire a wedding photographer. That's just in case, we were like something crazy happened. And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe we should have this for like ever, like a memory, you know. Um, I'm gonna pass. I have some work here I need to do. Okay, bye. So Thursday? Soft, Thursday? - Goodnight, Hal. - It's a soft yes, on Thursday. What's, wrong with me? Rented a bouncy house? She's don't like bouncy houses, they like clown's. OW! Ohhh! Stupid van! Broken finger! I've made a horrible mistake. I didn't mean to destroy you. I mean, I meant to destroy you. But I didn't think it would really work. What are we suppose to do, without you? I am so tired of running rampant through the streets. What's the point of being bad when there's no good to try and stop you? Someone has to stop, Megamind. Hey, we're closing soon. Oh, you scared me. - Barry, right? - Bernard. Bernard, I was just well I was talking to myself. You may think I'm a little bit nuts. I'm not allowed to self guess directly. Thank you, I just. Bernard, I'll just be another minute. - Okay. - Thanks. I have so many evil plans in the works. The illiteracy beam. Typhoon cheese. Robo sheep. Battles we will now, never have. You know we never had the chance to say goodbye. So, it's good that we have this time now. You know, before I destroy the place. Nothing personal, it just brings back to many painful memories. Hello, hello? Roxanne! That's a pretty tasteless costume. - Costume? - Megamind's head is not that grossly big. Oh you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How. Hello, is someone there? Hello, who's there? Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew. It's just you, Bernard. Oh, yes it's just me. Bernard. Well thank you for letting me stay. And thirty seven seconds if I were you. We're having the walls and ceiling removed. Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation. I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down with you then. I kept thinking he was going to do one of his last minute escapes. Yeah, he was really good at those. Oh, if only the world had a reset button. I've looked into the reset button. The size is impossible. Bernard, I didn't know you had. feelings. Are you okay? Metro Man is gone. And now there's no one left to challenge Megamind. Oh, come on, Bernard. As long as there's evil good will rise up against it. Ohhh, I wish. I believe someone is going to stand up to Megamind. - You really think so? - Yeah. I mean, it's like they say. Heroes aren't born, they're made. Heros can be made. That's it! - All you need are the right ingredients. - Yeah. - Bravery. - Yes. - Strength. - Of course. - Determination. - Imperative. And a smidgen of DNA. - With that, anyone can be a hero. - Yeah! Oh, ho, ho, ho! I think we should run. Bye. Time to put the past behind us. Only the future. AHH! Oh, that's to much. I'm definitely scared right now. Oh, hope no ones seeing this. Create a hero? A what? Why would you do that? So I have someone to fight. Minion, I'm a villain without a hero. A ying, with no yang. A bull fighter with no bull to fight. In other words, I have no purpose. Now, ask me how I'm going to do it. Go on, ask. How are you doing to do it? I'm going to give someone, I don't know who yet. Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that someone to become Montrocity's new hero. Over here, follow. And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero. In an epic battle of good and evil. We could put everything back the way it was. When the world was perfect. And rosy. Behold, Minion. Metro Man's cape. Look closely. Tell me what you see? Dandruff? Yes, it's his DNA. From this, we'll extract the source of Metro Man's awesome power. Boss, I think this is a bad idea. Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea. For the greater good of man. But I'm saying this is a kind of bad, bad. Okay, you might think it's good in your bad perception. But from a good perception, it is just plain bad. Oh, you don't know what's good for bad. Now we have just one shot at this. I must find a suitable subject. Someone who will do harm to mine. Who puts the welfare of others above their own. What on earth is that? Seems to be emanating from there, sir. - O-llo, - Uh, it's hello. Hello, like that? - Bernard, it's Roxanne. - It's Roxanne. I just want to thank you for inspiring me the other day. - Oh, You've inspired me too. - Great! It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around. Oh, oh really. She's so cute. - I'm already hot on his trail. - Uh, huh. And what gives you that idea? - Uh, sir. - I just found his secret hideout. How did she find my hideout? Uh, how did you find his hideout? This is the only building in Metro City with a big observatory on the roof. Okay, there's no way she'll find the secret entrance. Oh! There's a doormat here that say's 'Secret Entrance'. - Minion! - I kept forgetting where it was. She'll discover all our secrets. - Ohh, oh no! - You dim-witted creation of science. What? Oh, not you Roxanne. No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn. Don't do anything, I'll be right there. Roxanne? Oh no, not again. Roxanne. - Whoa! - Oh, I'm glad you're here. How did you get here so fast? Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called. - In a suit? - Uh huh. It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'. But that's not important. I better take the lead. This way looks exciting. No, it says, exit. Uh, which is the abbreviation for 'Exciting', right? It's the mother load. - Ahh. - Wow. - Wow. - Just look at this thing. You know, I really could use your help in deciphering all this. - Really? - You're an expert in all things Megamind, right? - Yes, right. - Together we could figure out his plan Are you in? - Oh, what fun! - That's what I want to hear. Minion, Code-Send out the brain pods. You know the whole point of a code is. Oh code-just do it, Minion. Ahh, it's me you fools! Bernard! It's daddy. Megamind! What have you done with, Bernard? Bernard? Oh yes, I mean poor defenseless, I don't want to get into it but, Lasers, spikes. Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes! You know the drill. Oh no, not the drill. - Let him go. - Or what? Or I'm going to find out what this weird looking gun does. No don't! Don't shoot that gun. I'll just go get him. Unhand me you fiend! It, it's strength's to much. Oh, I work out. Argh, it's really paying off. You're so fit, and strangely charismatic. Are you okay? I've did my best. But he's to fantastic. Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you. I got this covered. Let go, it's mine! Bernard, help! Give it to me. Oh no! Roxanne. Ow! Who on earth is that? Roxanne! Bernard, you were right about that door being exciting. This way. - Huh! - What are you doing? This will stop them, here! Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it. Just throw it. Daddy's, suffering. - Wow, that was real exciting. - Yeah. - You were very strong in there. - I know. I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that. What's going on? Hal, what happened? I think a bee flew up my nose. I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you, when like fifty ninjas tried to attack me. So I had to beat them all up, and I did. - and they were all like crying, so. - Wow. Brave one, isn't he. Who are you? Oh thi., this is Bernard. - He's my partner. - Partner? Yes, yes partner. Well look partner, I'm her partner. She doesn't know what she's saying. She's been through a traumatic experience. I'd better take him home. Thanks again, Bernard. I'll call you tomorrow, partner. Yeah, okay. I'd like that. That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you accidentally, okay lets end the meeting. Sir! Code-Did you find out who it was? Huh? Oh, oh. Code-get the car. Code-right away, sir. - Buh bye. - See you tomorrow, Hal. I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later. Who is this man, infused with godlike power? Ow, ow, whoa ho. Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart. He's twenty eight years old. No criminal record. Actually, no records at all. Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything. Not yet, Minion. Not Yet. Could this day get anymore, funtastic? So I will just go ahead and defuse him, since this is clearly a mistake. No, Minion. Something much more powerful is at work. This is no mistake. It's destiny. Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny. Hal? Hal Stewart? Am I saying it right? Stewart. Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me. Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart. Quick, the spray. - Oops, all out. - Well use the forget-me-stick. Oh, right! Just look at him. Well, he doesn't look quite the hero type to me. Oh, you're such a pill, Minion. The power couldn't ask for a finer claim. I smell hero. I smell something burning. I think it's working! Places, places. You have your disguise? What? Ah, you look fantastic. Rise, my glorious creation. Rise, and come to Papa. What's going on? - Easy my child. - Who are you? I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice. Honor, and nobility. I am your father. So you're like, my space Dad? Yeah, I'm like your space Dad. And you are, what? I'm your space, Step-Mom. I, I had some work done recently. Is this some kind of dream? This is a dream come true. You've been blethed with unfathomamble power. What kind of power? Unfathamomble. It's un, without Fathom. - Whoa - Yeah, we've come to guide you. On your path to be Montrosity's new hero. And battle the super genius, of Megamind. I know this is a lot to take in. It may take months for you to come to grips.. No frickin' way. Wahoo! Look at the big hero. I'm a big hero. Thee Minion, he's perfect. Aaannd, action! - Someone help me. - I'm okay. <i>Sun is shinning in the sky</i> Ohhh, oh! <i>There ain't a cloud in sight</i> Zap, zap, zap. Ha, haaa! The flames of my evil burn bright. Now you thay something cool back at me. Look, it doesn't even hurt. Don't even feel it. No, no, no. Shut it down, and stop. I said slow down. He's hopeless. HOPELESS! - Maybe we should change tactics? - You think so? Oh, you know how boys are. They want video games. I can throw a few parts together. Can't. wait. LoL, smiley face. Can't wait for what, sir? Oh, that was such a funny story. And brilliantly told, by the way. Okay, now you tell one. Bernard, I never knew you were so funny. And, I never heard you laugh before. Yeah, it's been a while. Feels pretty good. <i>Mr. Blue, you did it right.</i> And, exit. <i>Now his hand is on your shoulder</i> <i>Never mind</i> <i>I'll remember you this,</i> <i>I'll remember you this way.</i> You don't get out much, do you? Fun! I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid. It was one of my favorite things to do. Now look at it. It's a dump. <i>Hey Mr. Blue, we're so please to be with you.</i> Why are we cleaning up the City, sir? Um, well we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump, now. do we? They're all back. But how, why? Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all. That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove. Wa haoooo Okay, okay, Metro Man and I, were never a couple. But I thought you two were. I know, everybody did. It's just, well he was never really my type. Really? Okay, now you tell me something. Something you've never told anyone. Well, in shh-school. None of the other kids really liked me. I was always last one picked for everything. Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't go to the same school. Hal, I think you're ready for this. Do I have a son? No, Hal, you make me laugh. It stretches, it's for you. Hey, what's the 'T' stand for? Titan. Tighten? What's that suppose to mean? It was the only name I could trademark. Oh. Do you have someone special in your life, Hal? No not yet, but. There's this really, really good looking one I've got my eye on, currently. That's very good. Romance is very inspiring. - That's what I hear. - All you have to do, is save her. And she'll be yours. - Who want's Churro's? - I do! Thanks spaced out, momma. On the count of three, unsheathe your Churro. One, two, three! To Titan. Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind. And the city will know your name. The City's parks' restored to their original glory. The street's, the safest they've been. The banks reopened. Has something happened to Megamind? Has someone tamed this monster? This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic, but pleasantly confused. Well you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir. Huh, how long is this going to take me? Just a few alterations, sir. And I'll be done with your most terrifying cape yet. I'm calling it, Black Mambaaaaaaa. aaaa. aaa. Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am running late. I have to go. What, where, where are you going, sir? We have our date to battle Titan in the morning. We haven't even tested your big battle suit yet. You attend to the details, Minion. I have to, run a quick errand. You don't run errands. What's going on here? - What? - Oh, wait a minute. Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's, Fleur Du? It's just my natural musk. Now, where are the car keys? Ahhh. Uh, uh, uh, uh. This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it. Your going on a date with her. No my main man, get out of town. Oh this is bad, this is bad. You've fallen in love with her. You are forgetting your place, Minion. Now give me the keys. What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are? She will never find out. That's the point of lying. Ahhh! Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think this is your first day at being evil. NO! This has gone far enough. Oh, that was really grown up. Sir please, it's for your own good. Well what do you know. I may not know much, but I do know this. The bad guy doesn't get the girl. Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore. You heard me. Who are you? - Now give me the keys. - NO! My soul purpose in life is to look after you. Well I don't need you to look after me. What are you. what are you saying? - You don't need me? - Let me make it clear. Code-I don't need you. You know what, you know what. Code-I'll just pack my things and go. Code-Fine! Code-Fine back. Well good luck on your date. - I will. - That doesn't even make any sense. I know. I know I am so close, I can feel it. Okay, okay I just have to take a step back. Wait a minute. Titan. What's a Titan? My super ears are burning. I usually just hear criminals. You haven't been naughty, have you? I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you. The names Titan. - Titan? - Your very own heroic guardian What's your name? Just kidding, I know everything about you. Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers, Didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed you know, all of them. Okay, you don't like flowers. Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers. - What do you want? - Thought maybe we could go for a little - Get to know each other first. - WHOA! It's suppose to be very thrilling for you. Just what do you think you're doing? Oh are we moving to fast? You're probably right. I should just rescue you a few times before we get Whoops! Saved that, You are lucky to have such a great hero here. Somebody do something? No wait, Duh! I gotcha. That was fun, you almost died. But I saved you. - Ahhh, building! - AHHHH! Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Gotcha! Whoo, I'm sorry. What were you saying? I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life. Put me down, right now! Okay, all right, all right, hold on. Are you crazy? I suppose I'm, a little crazy. about you. Who are you? Really. Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare to have your mind blown, little lady. - Tada! - Hal? Yeah, isn't this great? Now there's nothing keeping us apart. No, it's not great. Aww, our first fight. This is so us, we're like an old married couple. There is no us, okay. There will never be an us. But, I have powers. I have a cape, I'm the good guy. You are a good guy, Hal. But you don't understand we need to find out why. Right now, this isn't right. - Listen to me, Hal. - You're suppose to be with me. I'm trying to warn you, Hal. It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal. - Bernard. - Roxanne. - Sorry I'm late. - Wow, your hair looks exciting. Hmm, not the only exciting development of the night. Megamind's created a new hero. And I know why. It all makes sense now. He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created a new hero to kick it for him. But why, Hal? Hal is the worst possible person you could pick. Wow, that's a lot to take in. It, it boggles my mind. I am extremely boggled. You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of who's kicking who's butt. But in the mean time. Let's enjoy each other's company. I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right, you know, I could use a breather. To, Bernard. For being the only normal thing in my crazy upside down world. To. being normal. - Roxanne. - Yes? Say I wasn't so normal. Say I was bald and had the complexion of a popular primary color. As a random, not a specific example. Would you still enjoy my company? Of course, you don't judge a book by its cover. Or a person from the outside. Oh, that's a relief to hear. You judge them based on their actions. Well that seems kinda petty, don't you think. - You. - What, what? Oh, don't look at me! Just, just a technical glitch. Don't look yet. My bad. Where were we? Now, now, hold on. YOU! I can explain. What about everything you just said? About judging a book by it's cover. Well let's take a look at the contents then, shall we? You destroyed Metro Man. You took over the city and then you actually got me to care about you. Why are you so evil? Tricking me? What could you possibly hope to gain? Wait a minute. Oh, I don't believe this. Do you really think that I would ever be with you? No. Okay Minion, you were right. I was.. less right. We should stick to what we're good at. Being bad. Minion. You there. Yeah, you. Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'! Okay, Titan it's time to go down, in style. I hear there's a new hero. Who dares to challenge my evil. Where is the one they call, Titan? Challenge me, if you dare. Oh no, we're gonna crash. This is embarrassing. Ballsy and incipient. Boneheaded, irresponsible. RUDE! Unprofessional, that's what this is. Would Metro Man have kept me waiting? Of course not, he was a pro. Hey, Megamind. You're actually the guy I want to see. Also, there's a door here. Do you have any idea how long I waited for you? No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying. Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying to beat this score. Were you even planning on showing up? What's this? Where did you get all this stuff? It doesn't belong to me. You stole it! - Pretty cool, right. - Oh no, no, no. You're a hero. Being a hero is for losers. It's work, work, work twenty four seven, and for what? I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me. Roxanne Ritchi? Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi. I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb. - Ohhhh - Who needs all that noise. That's why I think, WE should team up. You? Wait! What? With my power, and your big headedness, we could rule the city. - You want to team up? - I even drew up some new costume designs. - See - Costume design? You have a brain so you get a little brain wearing glasses on your costume, or something. And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like two tanks sword fighting. I can't believe you. All your gifts all your powers, and you squander them for your own personal gain. - Yes! - NO! I 'm the villain, you're the good guy. I do something bad, and you come and get me. That's why I created you. Yeah, right. You're nuts. - Space Dad told me. - Look, I'm your Space Dad. You should be more like Metro Man. You tricked me? Oh, don't like that, huh? Well there's more. I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne. - No. - And we were smooching. Mwah. Mwah. Mwah. When I get my hands on you I'm gonna, gonna. YES! Yes I know. Break me in two. Oh god, how I missed this. And the hero strikes the first blow. But evil returns with a backhand. YES! Ahh. shhhh. Come out you little freak! I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement. You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book. You little blue, twerp. En Garde! Oh, now that's the spirit. Take, that, and again! Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter. You go first. Look I'm not sure where you're going at. This one's for pursuing my girlfriend. This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me. And Megamind! This is for Space, Step-Mom. You lied to her! Oh, well now, I thought that pummeling went really, really well. I mean, I have a few notes. - Notes? - But they can wait. You can take me to jail now. Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking more like the morgue. - You're dead! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't how you play the game. Game over. Great button. I'm calling time out. Time out, time out! Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe. Guess what, Buster Brown? It's made from Copper. You're powerless against it. It's a very safe metal used to defeat. Metro Man? You, should stop comparing me to Metro Man. You run Megamind, but you can't hide. We're saved, we're saved! What's your name, new hero? - It's Tighten. - Thank you, thank you. Tighten has freed us. Oh I wouldn't say free. More like, under new management. What do you want? - Titan's turned evil. - Congratulations, another one of your genius And why did my doorman let you up? - Carlos? - What are you, no, no! I need your help. Why do you need MY help? Because you're the smartest person I know. Well you can't hide here. Copper should have worked, why didn't the copper work? The copper worked perfectly well the last time. Copper? You're not making any sense. Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness. He'll destroy the whole city. Okay, how can I help? We need to find answers. You knew Metro Man best. Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary fortress of some kind? Anything that would give us clues. Well, there is one place I know. You gave him these powers, can't you just take them away? I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car. The night you dumped me. Alone. In the rain. - Did you ever look back? - NO! - Oh, my giant blue head. - I guess we're here. So, this is where he hid it. After all these years. My old shhool house. You know, I think there's an apology in order, for the other night. Okay that would be nice. But make it quick. We have much more pressing matters to deal with. Wow, can't believe he kept all this stuff. Aww, I remember when he wore that. Can you just stay focused here? Yes of course, you're right, focused. HEY! Come over and look at this. What is it? Um... look! This glass has ice cubes in it. Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold. No, what I'm saying is, don't you think it's a little odd that the ice hasn't melted yet? One of lifes great mysteries. Hey. AHHHHHHHHHHH! We now run a confirmed report. Tighten, first thought to be the City's new hero, has turned evil. The city has never seen this level of destruction. If only Metro Man were still alive. - You're alive? - You're alive. I'm alive. But..we..we saw your skeleton. - You were dead. - Are you a ghost? There had better be, an amazing explanation for this. Speak, apparition. Okay, okay, okay, okay. You both deserve the truth. It all started back at the observatory. Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna stop you. My head wasn't in the game that day. We were kinda going through the motions. So. Using my super speed. I decided to go clear my head. Then I realized we had done this same silly charade our entire lives. I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling. But I just felt stuck. I began to realize, despite all my powers, each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't. A choice. Ever since I can remember I've always had to be what the City wanted me to be. But what about what I wanted to do? Then it suddenly hit me. I do have a choice. I can be whatever I want to be. No one said this hero thing had to be a life time gig. You can't just quit either. That's when I got the brilliant idea to fake my death. Copper drains my powers! You're weakness is copper? Once your death ray hit. I never felt so alive. So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school. Metro Man was finally dead. And Music Man was born. Music man? That way I can keep my logo. - WHAT? - 'Cause of what? Finally I'm free, to get in touch with my true power. Weaving lyrical magic. Check this out. <i>I have eyes that can see</i> <i>right through leaaadd.</i> - Ewww - Granted you have talent, But there's a mad man out there destroying our. your city. Why did you do this? The people of the city relied on you, and you deserted them. No offense. No, I'm with you. Look, we need your help. I'm sorry, I really am. Um, I'm, I'm done. You know, little buddy. There's a Ying for every Yang. If there's bad, good will rise up against it. It's taken me a long time to find my calling. Now it's about time, you find yours. Hey, who needs him. We can beat Tighten ourselves. I say we go back to the evil lair. Grab some ray guns, hold them sideways, and just go all gangsta on 'em. We can't So that's it? You're just giving up? I'm the bad guy. I don't save the day. I don't fly off into the sunset, and I don't get the girl. I'm going home. Unless someone comes to our aid soon, all may be lost. Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus. Remaining citizens are warned, to stay indoors until further notice. Authorities have issued a warning, to stay out of the downtown area at all costs. Hal! Hal! Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am, you've finally come to your senses. Well, I'm over you. I've come to stop you, Hal. You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you going to do, report me to death? I was going to try reasoning with you. You and I, we worked together for a long time. I know you. You don't know me. You never took the time to know me. This is the first time we've hung out socially. And it's when I'm about to destroy the city. I want to talk to the real Hal. I want to talk to the guy who loved being a camera man, and eating dip, And being a nerd and being not as scary as the Tighten-Hal. To late! Megamind. You and I have some unfinished business. I'll be waiting at Metro Tower, oh, and just so you don't get cold feet. Roxanne! Come on Roxi, call for your hero to come rescue you. Megamind. I don't even know if you're listening, but if you are. You can't give up. The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight. Even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning. It was your best quality. You need to be that guy, right now. The city needs you. I need you. Roxanne. You have one hour. Don't. keep me waiting. Warden, Warden! Listen to me, you have to let me go. Tighten has to be stopped. Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life sentences to go. Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done. If you want to hear me say it? I'll say it. Here it is. Black is part of my heart. I.. AM.. Sorry! Not buying it. I don't blame you. I've terrorized the city countless times. Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain. I lied to Roxanne, and. My best friend, Minion. I treated like dirt. Please, don't make this city, Don't make Roxanne pay for my wrong doings. Apology accepted. Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you. What are we waiting for? We'd better get going. You got me! Good luck, fellows. We're gonna die! Wait, what? Hey, Metro losers. This is Metro Tower. They say it's suppose to be a symbol of our cities strength. But, for me, it's a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart. And I hate reminders. HAL! Please don't do this. I know there's still good in you, Hal. You're so naive, Roxie. You see the good in everybody, even when it's not there. You're weaving a fantasy. There is no Easter bunny. There is no tooth fairy. And there is no Queen of England. This is the real world. And you need to wake up. You dare to challenge Megamind? This town isn't big enough for two super villains. Oh, you're a villain all right. Just not the super one. Yeah, whats the difference? PRESENTATION! I knew you'd come back. Well, that makes one of us. - What's the plan? - Well, mostly involves, not dying. I, like that plan. I can't control it. No! Well, that was easy. Looks like there's only one loose end now. Please, let's have a little respect for public transportation. You came back. You were right, Roxanne. I never should have left. Whoa, I. I thought you were dead. My death was, greatly exaggerated. So, you're the punk I've heard about. Whoa! I'm sorry, I did the best I could. I'm so proud of you. Minion? Surprise! Heh, heh, heh. He's the real hero. Megamind. Going somewhere? Besides jail. No, not in the face there, please. If you know what's good for you Tighten. You'll stay out of Montrosity. - You got it! - Good! Pretty sneaky, sis. But there is only one person I know who calls this town, Montrosity. Ooops. You! Bet you think it's really funny, huh? Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh. You're not going to be laughing no more. The invisible car. Hey, remember that night that I dumped you? You are bringing this up now? I did look back. You did? YOU DID! Yes, and you should look back, right now. Oh, I get it. This is the last time you'll make a fool out of me. I made you a hero. You did the fool thing, all by yourself. Oh, uh. You're so pathetic. No matter what side you're on. You're always the looser. There's a benefit to loosing. You get to learn from your mistakes. What? Oh, you've got to be kidding me! Minion, if I live, I will kill you. Enjoy your flight. AHHHHHHHHHHH! Megamind. So, this is how it ends. Normally I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure. But not today! What can I say? Old habits die hard. Say bye, bye Roxie. Ollo. Thing about bad guys, they always LOOSE! Ohhhh. You did it, you won. Well, I finally had a reason to win. You. MINION! Can't see it's cold and. warm, and dark and light. It's me, Minion. I'm right here. We've had a lot of adventures together. You and I. We have, Minion. I mean. most of them ended in horrible failure, but, We won today. Didn't we, sir? Yes Minion, we did it. Thanks to you. Code-We're the good guys now. Code-I guess we are. Oh, oh. I'm going. I mean this is. This is it, I mean I'm going far awa. Oh, what a drama queen. You know, I'm feeling much better now. I guess I just needed a swim - He had you, didn't he. - Whew! Classic, Minion. Don't give them the face. There he is with that little face. Look at that face. We did it! We did it! - Fist pump! - You did it! We won, we won, we won. What! Get back you savages! Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback. Funny, I guess destiny is not the But the path we choose for ourselves. All right, put your hands in the air. Now hand over your wallets. I'm just kidding. Just kidding. I have to admit. Being good, has its perks. You know, you look pretty good in white. Megamind, if you please. Uh, hey, my kid can't see. Sorry my friend. Way to go, little buddy. I knew you had it in you. Ladies and gentlemen. MEGAMIND! Defender of Metro City. You know, I like the sound of that.

Yes A few years ago your kung fu made you the master. of the auxiliary troops in Yunnan of Boxer Gang That's not true Li Lin Ying wanted you to train the Boxer Gang troops .to be bullet-proof; So that the Empress could save large military expense .in buying firearms Hey kid Watch your mouth, you could be executed! You know how powerful these foreign weapons were No matter how hard you trained yourselves .you couldn't be bullet-proof You didn't want. to sacrifice your students; That was why you disbanded the troops What are you talking about? If Li Lin Ying knew you're hiding here in Guangdong .he'd surely send someone here to kill you Is that true? Like you. I object to Li's despicable ways Hey kid. I'm not Lui Gung They will kill you tonight It's you? Watch my dart You'd better be careful This secret weapon is very powerful That's Boxer Gang's assassination troop Look at him See how sick he looks. yet he wants to kill you! I'm not Lui Gung He. how come he. While he's in stupor let me first leave Spiritual boxing, Maoshan, magic fighters. If they were after some traitor; You should know that no matter what .they will find him You insisted that I am Lui Gung? Well, you disbanded Boxer Gang in Yunnan Lui Gung This was something in the past But I. You now lead a solitary life Then you'll waste all the hard work of the past I haven't Kid After I disbanded the troops. they all lead a happy and stable life They are all like me. leading the rest of their lives selling wood You know something A lot of young people like him. were obsessed by the Boxer Gang; Thinking that they were immune to weapons Only you know this is nonsense That's you you've to put an end to this superstition I've led a solitary life for so long Everything degenerates No. You've got real kung fu With me and this young man .we've got sufficient power He'll kill me You can enlighten him Let him drink it Brother, nice meeting you Lui Yung, it's you Yes Haven't seen you for years Your spiritual boxing. has regressed so much I've left the Boxer Gang Spiritual boxing is no longer of any use to me It's all because you didn't want to make use of. spiritual boxing to expand Boxer Gang's power Look at you You used to be the master of the auxiliary troop Respectable, and bright; But now you've become. the traitor of the Boxer Gang I couldn't bear to see my own students. fighting foreigners' firearms barehanded Because you are good in spiritual boxing That was why Chief Li. wanted to kill me Including you Yes We've received orders. to kill you Why didn't you go ahead? Brother, stop Although I've received the orders .but you are my brother How can I kill you? Although you've regressed in spiritual boxing .but you nevertheless know kung fu What do you want? Before other people. get to you, You'd better re-organize your kung fu Uncle Yu, he's right Ah Yung How can you report to the Maoshan clan? Brother, I can fix it Ah Yung, you.

They are all here I'll show you Who are you? I am. the one who cured you and saved your life I know that; But what I'm curious is. why he's hidden the 18 styles of weapons And what's more, he knows how to use them! What does it matter to you. if he knows the weapon techniques? I've received orders. to execute whoever knows the 18 weapon styles Then you have to kill me? Uncle Yu, she. is a girl Correct. I am a girl Why did you dress up as a man? I came from the capital to look for someone It's not convenient for a girl to travel like this Your impersonation is good Yes Uncle Yu, you're a woodcutter How do you know the eighteen styles of weapons? I taught him So you know the techniques? Tieh Hau, do you want to kill a girl too? I'm on the same side as you are I too am looking for Lui Gung That's right Too many people are looking for Lui Gung .and I look like him I don't want to be killed by mistake Hence I wanted to learn kung fu just in case Uncle Yu, don't be afraid, I'll help you You really want to help Uncle Yu?

It's her Uncle Fang Shau Ching, you too have come to Guangdong? Yes, uncle I fully agree with Lui Gung disbanding the Boxer Gang So I'm here to help him You want to revolt? Yes. The spiritual boxing we've been practising .is making use of our real kung fu as camouflage; So how could we fight against those firearms? What are you doing? It's you Lui Gung, you'll be executed Master, you've got the wrong person He isn't Lui Gung Magic fighters clan is Boxer Gang's killer troop You can't even tell someone who impersonates .himself as a woodcutter You who practise shadow boxing. You & Lui Gung are from spiritual boxing school .but uncle Yu isn't versed in any magic! How can you take him as Lui Gung? You've got orders to kill Lui Gung Why didn't you kill him? Let me tell you He and Lui Gung look very much alike However, he is not Lui Gung; Besides, he has saved my life Lui Gung, you are too sly Uncle, take your order back; Disband the Boxer Gang Uncle Yu, what makes her say that? She. Uncle Yu, don't be afraid If Shau Ching is not powerful enough, there's me What if you are not powerful enough?

Talk about it later. Don't have to be a policeman to help people. That's right, papa. Whenever you're in trouble, come to me. Don't ever steal again. How come the painter chose this lady as model? She looks like having a sprained neck. James, come and try the soup. It's been boiling for 4 hours. Well? Why does it taste like canned soup? Go to hell. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to dear Cherie. Happy birthday to you. Congratulations, you look gorgeous. Thanks! Today's my birthday, you do what I say. Your birthday doesn't mean you're the boss.

Hello Cherie. Hello. Joe, James, welcome. How are you? Ah, how come? How much? Half a million. Too expensive, the painting is only worth 400,000. He said it's too expensive, 400,000. Tell him he's a motherfucker. What is he saying? Go on. I want to ask you "Where's your mother?" I want to say hello to her. She's fine, thank you very much. You are welcome. Tell him, not a penny less. Half a million, no discount. OK, it's a deal. Half a million, he agreed. Great. Steal this painting for me, I gave you 2 million. Please translate. Thank you. He offered you 2 million to steal a painting. 2 million? But you both promised not to steal any more. Did I say that? I don't remember saying that. You can't break your promise. This painting is in a castle in Nice. There's also a love story attached to it. The lady in the painting was the painter's lover. The painter died soon after finishing the painting and it's haunted by his soul. Any self-respecting thief would be proud to steal it, but it's never left the castle. Whoever manages it will be famous. For you it's a challenge. Such a long speech, what did he say? I don't want to tell you. Tell me. Tell us. He said this painting is evil, whoever steals it will die. So what do we do? Well? Do it. Do it? Do it. Sorry, we've already retired. Is that true? He asked ifyou're sure you can do it. Sure, Yeah. OK, forget it, I'm really sorry. He said we can go now. Hey, what about the deposit? They will contact us. Hey, let's have a drink first. Why didn't you tell him? Bye. I'll kiss you next time. Please shave. Thanks, bye. It's working. A call from Hong Kong, sir. Thanks Hello, Mr. Chow! Hello, Mr. Burton, any problem? No problem, just do it. Very good. Cherie, did you see James? I don't know where he went. His "work" tools have disappeared too, do you think. Shit! Please don't go. He can't do a thing without me. He'll be fine. I'm afraid he'll get into trouble. I knew you'd do this. You two better come back safe and sound. I'm going, you go pack up. Remember tomorrow morning 9 o'clock. Wait for me at Cannes airport. Book 3 tickets, 3 tickets, OK! And then what? Promise me this will be the last time. You're such a pain! What are you doing here? It takes two to tango. Hey, it's too quiet, must be traps. Yeah, like lots oftrap-wires and arrows. Let's check it out. Nothing. Here's the stone gate, wonder where is the switch? For sure it's well hidden. What are you saying? I don't believe it! They hid this precious painting here? These are all cheap wines! The hidden must be the most obvious. Hey, how come it's so long? Let's go! It's you. Hey, did you see that? Damn, which one? Hey, it moved by itself. It goes back. Hurry up. What is it? What are you doing? May not be laser beams but electricity, yes! God, so windy. It's for effect! Come on. Come on. Be careful. Here. Come on. Come on. OK. Hey, careful, want me to die? How come you're so heavy? I eat a lot. Pull me up. I said pull me up, not down. Want me to die? Hold tight. Come on. Pull me up. Don't fart. Swing harder. Harder. Did you get it? Almost. Did you touch it? Yeah, harder. Almost got it. Got it. Ready. OK. Go. Let's go. Hey. Do you still want your shoes? We made it, It's the real thing. My blood is all going to my head. How come she is staring at me? It's your lamp's reflection. Right. What are you doing? Come help me. OK. Hurry. Come on. It's quiet here, let's go. Looks like a trap to me. Strange, so quiet, how could that be? Wait and see. OK, here's to our friendship. There's no need for words. No, I mean that wine is made up of preserved grapes. Everyone is drunk, I alone am lucid. Wow, Surat guy (Superior intellect) Hey, over here! I see it. Come on. I'll check it for you. You better! Of course. Hey, watch your ass. I got a big one. There's one more. Easyjob, cheers. Cheers. How old are you? You should be older. See who's better? Come on. Hurry up. Alright. Get them, don't let them escape. Quick get in. You alright? Lucky the bullet isn't in too deep. Raise your arm. Higher. Move your finger, make a fist. No big deal, you'll make it. I warned you not to try it alone. You had to try, look at you now. I didn't do it for the French man. Don't be so superior, you're no artist. I know that. I did it for Cherie. Ifyou did it for Cherie, you did it for yourself. Ifyou did it for yourself, you did it for me. Ifyou did it for me, you did it for us all. What are you talking about? You treat friends better than the woman you love. No, I treat them both the same. Same? Say what? Are you sure? You're saying I'm not. You treat her like an object. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. You call that treating her right? Do you know I'm jealous ofyou? Did you ever think of her? Did you? Ifyou think of someone else, you lose yourself. You both know how I am. I like to be footloose and carefree. Who says I'll spend the rest of my life with her? If I like a flower, I don't have to pick it. If I like the wind, I don't need to bag it. If I like a cloud I don't need to hold it. If I like the sea, I don't. What are you talking about? I am talking about humans. What's that about wind, flowers, clouds. I was talking about women. Women need to be loved, and cared for I know after marriage, no more freedom of Democracy. All I want are. flings! Did you ever hear that? A fling is not forever. Hey, do you know you're bleeding? Do you know you're wounded? So what? Are you finished? Well? That's it. Really? Are you feeling better? Ifyou're alright, let's go. Cherie's waiting at the airport. Kill them, get the painting whatever it takes. James, take the painting, don't wait for me. Tell Cherie I'll look for her. I'll hold them off, go to the airport. OK. Boss, we'll get them at the pier. Damn it! James. Damn you. James. Did you do it? Where's Joe? Where is he? James, look at me, what happened? Huh, what 's this? We had some problems. I'll go look for him. No, he's dead. Let's go. I want to find him. Come on. Beautiful. This is art. Your money. We're two of a kind. We both love the money, good work. Thanks. Would you like to see the Hong Kong by night? Sure, sure. Yeah! Someone will show you around. Yeah! My pleasure I heard that the crime problem in H.K. is very serious. Dad, dad! Joe, you are still alive. Your leg. I am lucky, the explosion hasn't ended my life. It's all dad's fault, it must be the French man. I'll get him. Your brother used to be the best in his field. Joe, come and ski with me some time. Ifyou still can. Dad, I hope you'll think of me for old times sake. I'm useless now. Think of me as charity, give me a boost. Joe, you know dad is pained to see you like this. But how do you want me to help you out? Joe, are you OK? Son, are you alright? You bastard, I'll sue you. Hey, don't talk nonsense. Ifyou must sue, sue the staircase, it's what hurt you. What? Stop yelling. He's got nothing to do with it, it's my fault. You're still protecting him? Buy him a new wheelchair. I'm leaving. Hey, how can you eat so much? So you can cook for yourself when I'm not there. Kick them over there. Come on, help. This is embarrassing. Never mind them. Let's go. Hey, I'm busy, you go back first! Hurry back, I'll cook for you. Do you have money? Yeah Hi. James, Cherie. Dad. Hey, what happened to your hand? Oh, nothing really. Cherie, why are you so thin? Not really. Doesn't James feed you well? Of course he does. James, you said you wanted to pay me back. What do you mean? Steal me that painting. What painting? Come on, follow me, come on. How come the painting is here? You don't need to know. It disappeared for 2 years, the price tripled. If it stayed losing 2 more years, how much will it be worth then? I'll take it to the auction later. With Joe, it would be easy. Pity he lost his legs. Doesn't he die? James saw him, didn't he mention it? Papa. Somebody's looking for me? Outside? Joe. How are you? You used to travel a lot, do you miss it? Nothing's different. I still travel, but around here. My trips are smaller, quieter. But it's a lot more peaceful. I'll take you around. Never mind, my legs don't feel a thing. Come on. This is where I work, in front is my observatory. This is my latest computer. Whenever I can I play computer games. This is my guest room. This is my newest painting, I call it "Bud's Paradise". This is my newest partner, Bobo. Bobo, say Hello. This wall painting took me 3 months, do you like it? I still exercise a lot. This side is my Botanical Garden. The other side is my zoo. All the birds are from South Africa. The one sitting there looking serious is my benefactor. He's like a father to me. Bye. Come on, I'll show you the kitchen. No need, I just came to ask you a favor. What is it? I want you to help James. What's wrong with James? He promised Dad. He would steal him the painting again. I'm afraid he'll get into trouble again. Please help him. You two always work together. I want to help, but does he want to be helped? I knew you would, I'm leaving. Bye. Cherie. Mou Amour. Come on, Cherie Mou Amour. He's depressed, his girl friend eloped with a vulture.

Aren't we leaving together? Right, didn't we say we'll always be together. James, well, not exactly. Every good thing has to end some time. In fact, I prefer travelling alone, footloose and carefree. Take good care of Cherie. What do you mean? Take care. What do we do? I'm leaving, I wish you all the best. Joe. Yes, well, what do you want? We don't mean you must stay. But don't you think a promise must be kept. What did I promise? You promised to be godfather to our kids, remember? That was a long time ago. Well, Cherie is pregnant now. Hey, stop that.

Nonsense.I'm not responsible for the robbery I suggest you go look for Cheng Giu Halt! I'll teach you a lesson You are such a pain in the neck Attack Lei Li, you robber and plunderer. You. However reckless, you can't equal my twin swords Master, some people are fighting over there Hero Lung Well well.Chieftain Ho, what's up? He.he is a robber You be the judge, Hero Lung You are still young Why use your martial art skills .to commit such vile deeds! Who are you? Lung Er Zi Oh, so it's chivalrous Hero Lung Your fame precedes you That's kind of you. And your good name? Lei Li Your name is not new to me either But you haven't been righteous Considering your age I'm prepared to spare you .provided you repent your ways That's sheer nonsense Or do you refuse to heed my warning? Let's see how good your skills are Well.newborn calf not scared of the tiger, huh! I'm prepared to try out some moves with you If I lose, I'll cut off my right arm and. retire from the martial arts world I'll do the same if I lose Why come to such an extreme decision?

Master Chieftain Ho must announce this matter. then your fame will be even greater Yes, it would add to your heroism. to have rid of an arch enemy This Lei Li fellow; A few more years in the martial arts world. and his fame would have soared higher than yours Where is the money hidden? Master, for our hard work .can we please have it? No one knows about this anyway Teacher, we'll do whatever errand you give us You both are actually trying to coerce me! No, we don't dare Master You should know Last year I took your two brothers. to victory against the Bai Fa Swordsman How come they have never returned, huh? No idea You're like them Master.

Sure It's raining heavily, I'll accompany you Okay Won't you have a drink with my dad? Lei Li, you're always being bullied Like those thugs you also should keep. a sword at the waist Maybe they'd lay off then Dad often remarks that. you must have known kung fu before Is that right? Is it true? Ba Jiao, you go carefully. I'll head back Hero Fung Hero Fung Who are you? Oh, it's really you, we're saved Everyone knows that. your twin swords are matchless You've detained me just because of this? Oh no, we're running for our lives From a distance we saw your gait .so we ran up to you We've really met our saviour Hero Fung, we have been robbed Please help us Right Where? Just over there at the slope We fought for our lives and escaped This is a dangerous road Yesterday too someone was robbed It must be done by the men at Tiger Mansion Yes, Tiger Mansion Our money has been robbed by Chieftain Chan Okay, I'm headed towards Tiger Mansion anyway I'll remember your request Many thanks Hey guys! They didn't say which treasury house! Never mind, for sure this fellow .will go to Tiger Mansion anyway The top guys of Tiger Mansion are at the tavern Let's go and have a drink No, teacher has forbidden us .to consort with their folk Why is that? Teacher himself. Shut up and go Hero Fung will be here soon We'll be in trouble if he runs into us Let's go The wine is good here Hey, get us another bottle Be quick This kid sure has some skills Yes You see, a cripple has to think of alternate ways You needn't speak on his behalf How long have you been here? Almost 2 years You studied martial arts? Look at me when speaking Lei Li Miss Ba, you want to buy wine? Yes Let me help you Miss, he can do it pretty fast .you needn't show sympathy You should pity us, we're drinking alone Why don't you drink with us? Look, the lad objects to it Where is she from? She.she's the daughter of blacksmith Ba So I see Pretty girl, we need to have a lot of work done Please ask your father to come up with you .to our place Good food and wine; it'd be real fun with us What else would you both like? Damn kid, mind your own business Gentleman Please ask the good sir to let him be Shut up or you'll have a hard time too Damn, the lady has run away Now you get her back for me Do you hear me? Bastard, you want to be a hero Be careful, he knows kung fu You know kung fu? Very well That's too cautious.here, watch me Hear that, bastard? Get the girl back Didn't you hear? Hey I'm here Please don't bully him anymore Come, drink with us You. Let her go Let her go Let go of her Who are you? Just a passer-by You're the twin-swords hero Fung? That's right Listen, brother. Hurry, let's go Why didn't you fight back just now? I don't know what you're talking about Come out Who were those two thugs a while back? They're the top guys at Tiger Mansion Your swordsmanship is great Those two fellows. could also take on many at a time Who is that one-armed youth? He is the helper here at Boss Li's eatery Don't pretend to be a hero Why don't you just let them have their way? Look at you now, all beaten up! I run a small place. Rather not have any trouble Miss Ba, your dad awaits the wine You go back Brother Lei Please go I'll come again. to give you something My friend, you. If there's something you need. please let us know and I'll make it People say real fighters don't show their strength; But I don't understand. I don't know what you're talking about! Chief Before Fung comes to Tiger Mansion .why did you fight with him? Chief, we didn't want to He unexpectedly turned up, we had no choice Look at you nincompoops! Hero Fung's swordsmanship is exceptional If he came charging in, I'm afraid. Give the order to tighten security Yes Master Chan, please come in Yes Your men had a fight with Fung? Yes The two leaders of the Mansion have been wounded How are their skills? Reasonably good According to them Fung's skills are excellent .and out of this world Alright, have invitations sent out. to martial artists within a few hundred miles Have them all meet at this place Brother Lung, we must lure Fung here .to get rid of him It isn't advisable to leak this out Oh, come on. I have my own ideas Have our names on the invitation Yes And send one to Fung too Set the date at five days from now Those who serve the invitation must be highly skilled Brother Lung, I still miss the point Tiger Mansion is mysterious to the outside world Nobody knows what we have done I want Fung to come in. and defeat him in front of everyone; Thus forcing him out of the martial arts world A superb plan indeed! Dad Yes dear, what is it? I think you have something on your mind You approached me so many times .yet you won't speak up Dad, don't you have a good sword hidden away? You said, unless it is a great swordsman. the sword's power cannot be brought forth And also that it has a peerless edge Yes. Why have you brought this up? I want to give it to Lei Li Give it to him for what? He is a good man, but bullied by many If he had a sword .it'd perhaps be better Nonsense The poor fellow has lost his right arm Naturally he'd be bullied Know this; presently he is only pushed around Say if, how good a sword he may have. he will surely die by another's sword He can practice swordplay though; it's better. he died in a fight than be trampled upon like this That's utter rubbish Do you know how I came by that sword? It was 20 years ago; even before you were born On an evening just like this A young hero barged into our place He had this sword. and a sword stuck in his guts, bleeding profusely I hid the sword Not until much later I found out that. he was a famous swordsman of the time Alas.what good did the sword do! However strong one is, there'd always be one better! Keep the wind bellows going Jiao dear, have you gone to bed? Yes, father I suggest you go. to the town and find suitable lodging What, are you turning me away? No, it's just that our place is not very appropriate Mr. Boss You're wrong there One's body isn't even 7 ft. Could settle down anywhere Am I right? Friends, they say wine makes the heart sadder But better bend one's conduct than to keep kowtowing Come, drink with me Sir, you are drunk Only a real hero, a brave man can transcend above everything else, like you Whyever. You. Lei Li, don't offend customers Lei Li? You are Lei Li? Lei, my friend Please don't follow me Boss Li Where's that chap. who wounded some people here? Is someone looking for me? What do you want with me? Fighters within 500 miles. will meet at the Tiger Mansion in five days Here is the invitation from Hero Lung Hero Lung? Yes, Hero Lung Er Zi Why would he consort with the folks. at the Tiger Mansion? Tiger Mansion is famous What's so strange about Hero Lung. having a relationship with Chieftain Chan? Right, I'm going up there anyway Let's have the invitation Come on, what's to fear? There's a little something I want to know Yes, please ask Tiger Mansion is known for heroism & justice; Yet discreetly indulges in unlawful activity The 2 recent robberies. who all were involved? There has been no such incident Hero Fung, we're here to deliver the invitation .with good intent. Please don't hurt us Go tell Chan Chun Nam I'll be there in 5 days Ask him to be prepared to greet me And yes, my regards to Hero Lung Let's go Lei Li, Lei Li Brother Lei See what I've got for you! What is it? A blade.a good sword Tuck that sword in your waist cloth Whoever wanting to bully you. will have second thoughts Thank you, but I won't use it I.I can't, please take it back You are willing to be bullied? Ba Jiao, you don't understand It's useless even if I carry it I did have a sword once, l. Kindly take it back, I don't want No, once I've brought it I won't take it back I'll leave it here. It's up to you if you want it Ba Jiao! Truly rare.wonder if I can ever be like him! Abandoned his twin swords! This girl is a tender sweetie pie We both can enjoy her You're injured more. Naturally I'd go first Oh, that doesn't matter Sure Ba Jiao! Lei Li, whom are you chasing? Men from Tiger Mansion They.they took Ba Jiao Please don't cry If Lei Li had not come after you. you would have ended up at Tiger Mansion Lei Li? Yes I think he wanted to return you the sword .and saw you were abducted Why doesn't he want the sword? You may not understand Tell me. Perhaps I would He had great skills before Maybe even greater than mine But he was defeated. and lost an arm Now he just wishes. that he'd forget he ever knew Kung Fu Unknowingly you might have made him suffer more .by giving him the sword I see! Brother Fung Brother Lei I am a helper at the tavern I'd rather not talk about the past You still treat me as your friend I treat you as my brother Brother Fung, come along I'll cook something delicious for you Sure Yes, go ahead, you two. just forget about me! Come, grab my sleeve Lei Li, I have never seen you smile Until noon, there won't be customers I'll keep you company Don't mind me, carry on with your work Lei, the customers are waiting Brother Lei, I admire you can do that I simply envy you Come on, quit kidding Think I'd joke with someone of your experience? You had better not go to this meeting. at Tiger Mansion I must, I think Hero Lung, too. has been tricked by those men I have to reveal their treachery Hero Lung? Lung Er Zi I shouldn't have mentioned him That's fine I lost to. his three-sectioned staff Hero Fung, there is one technique. specially designed against twin swords I lost because of this technique. This. It's okay. You've long stopped thinking about kung fu I won't fight with him either So why talk about such things? Brother Lei, I have decided I'll retire after this meeting We'll take up farming at Tai Wu lake What are you laughing about? I don't know for sure if Ba Jiao. will leave her father to go along with you Don't give up, not everyone knows kung fu Those who do might not be that much happier Brother Fung I haven't been happy this past year I torture myself daily Only until now I can realise in my heart. that I have no more pain Thank you for coming, we're honoured -Please -Thanks Brother Lung Do you think Fung will come? He certainly will I have seen too many of such young heroes Yes, many of them. have been defeated by you. over the years But brother Lung. why do you never kill them? That's why I'm known as Chivalrous hero Lung Our Jin died at the hands of Fung; You think that would make him change his mind? Don't worry He'll think I'm on his side and that I'm here. to uphold the justice Right there and then I'll decide what to do I'll be back before the sun sets Brother Fung, if you fight with Lung .you must guard against that special technique He is a famous swordsman Why would I fight with him? If he is a famous swordsman. why would he be with the gang of Tiger Mansion? Most likely he has been deceived I'll sort it out Well, I hope so too Brother Fung, I'll await your return Right on That sword is still with me. Please take it back To take it back in broad daylight. would get me a good scolding from dad It's better to leave it with you Most welcome, Hero Fung Please Hero Fung has arrived Your fame precedes you It's an honour to meet you in person You are Chan Chun Nan? Yes Where's Hero Lung? Hero Lung and other heroes. are waiting in the grand hall Good. Don't try any moves. Let's proceed there And you'll receive a fair hearing. Come on Hero Lung What is the matter, Chief? Who is this young man? This is twin swordsman, our friend Fung Hero Lung You flatter me Why do you have a conflict with Chieftain Chan? Hero Lung, Folks I am afraid you've been deceived Tiger Mansion looks innocent enough But it is an evil place Chief, is it like that? You allege that hero Fung injured or killed your men What actually happened? There is no such thing But it is a fact Fung is the culprit Fung, my friend What have they done? Robbing Nonsense. What treasury house did I rob? Exactly Who did they rob? One of them is Lin Shing. About the other I'm checking What? Lin Shing! Is that the one in Chun Kong county? Most probably What a joke! I'm the chieftain of Lin Shing Security Bureau Wouldn't I know about robbery at my place? Hero Lung, you'll be the judge Fung, what about the other security bureau? Hero Fung, I'm afraid you're grossly mistaken You've injured men of Tiger Mansion. slaughtered them and lied about the incident If everyone with some martial art skills .were as outrageous; What will this world come to? Oh! So inviting me here was to teach me a lesson! No, I was passing by. and heard of the incident And since we are all martial artists I just hope to be an intermediary You've just arrived and drew a sword at the host Isn't it out of line? Goodbye everyone Hold it! The so-called leader of Tiger Mansion, Jin Yi abducted the daughter of. blacksmith Ba in Ma Chao town Hero Lung About this why don't we clarify with Chieftain Chan? As per our information two of them were going by. when you suddenly appeared and killed one You believe him? Actually speaking I can't believe you You mentioned two bureaus were robbed but actually there has been no such case I understand now. I totally understand, Hero Lung So you are up to that Fung, you've recklessly harmed people with your swords Today, in front of all of us. You must right this wrong All along it's me you wanted to pick a fight with Why bother with this nonsense? Hand me the weapon Let's witness the power of your twin swords .that has made you so reckless Please make way, everyone If you promise to amend your ways. I wouldn't necessarily want to fight you Save this for after you win the duel Watch this This is your special technique And you can't thwart it If I had three swords, I could have defeated you But with just two hands how can you handle three? Look at you, barging in like this I almost dropped the egg Says who? Even with a number of eggs in mid-air .I'm sure you can still catch them Let me help you Hero Fung should have returned by now There you go again.you're so anxious! The sun hasn't gone down yet If you cut your arm and retire from the martial world. I'll let you out of this place How many were there before me? Hero Lung is so merciful, just do it I.I'll kill him Chieftain Chan, the matter is out of my hands The quarrel between you both. shall be dealt with by yourselves Sure Relax, he's been seriously wounded Everyone, little did we expect this to happen .and disturb you all This is not Hero Lung's responsibility He had already let him go It was his own fault He sought his own death But it could be said he died at my hands Chieftain Chan, give him a proper burial Yes Please go back, gentlemen My mood is spoilt. I just want to rest a few days Yes Lei Li, that twin-swords lad is great In case if he had a mishap. what's the use of worrying for him Go and do your work Teacher is great Not only he had the kid buried appropriately .but also wept at his grave They all say our Master is such a hero .and stands tall among men This is real kung fu Hey, bring the wine C'mon, be quick. Stop dreaming Who are you talking about? What rubbish! That's none of your concern I ask who are you talking about? Speak It's.about twin-sword Hero Fung What about him? He's dead and buried behind Tiger Mansion This chap has gone nuts That Fung is a good friend of his Lei, you are here Boss Li told me.he said Fung is dead Why do good men die easily? Lei Li, speak something I'll avenge him How can you. I have to avenge him Don't go, please I must avenge him Hurry, run! Where is hero Fung buried? Take me there Over there Attack Quick.come on, move Chieftain What's happening out there? Someone has stormed the place .and killed three leaders Who is it? Don't know Who are you? You go and check what's happening! Yes Such swift swordsmanship! It's him Lung Er Zi Lei Li You've lost your arm, know your place After that incident I've been humble & law-abiding But you killed hero Fung; I'm here for revenge Revenge? What capability do you have? Even when you were famous for your twin swords .you lost to me How will you avenge him today? You are rather here to die with him .and not avenge him I.I'm here to accompany him in death Meet your death now If I had 3 swords I could defeat you Fung wielded twin swords with both hands But you could manage three with just one arm!

Do you copy?</i> <i>For the past three minutes.</i> <i>every attempt to communicate with the Excursion has failed.</i> I told 'em not to go to Mars! I told 'em not to go! <i>G.C., Flight. Check all relay stations on the network.</i> <i>Have the backup TDRS on standby.</i> <i>Flight to all operators. Pull up your data passes from the burn.</i> <i>Get with your back rooms. Verify that we saw no anomalies.</i> <i>For God's sake, somebody tell me she didn't blow.</i> Houston, this is Excursion. We had a malfunction in the K.U. band antenna. Lost telemetry and comm. I performed a bit of I.F.M. Seems to be okay now. Excursion crew is okay. Headed for rendezvous with Big Blue. It's gonna be good to get home. Over and out. The Extraterrestrial Vulnerability Experiment. has one central goal: to discover a means to defend ourselves. against the alien species should they ever return to Earth. Now, as you know, gentlemen, Eve was re-created from a frozen lab embryo. She's a genetic duplicate of the original Sil. Now, we have deliberately shielded Eve. from any direct contact with the male gender. which is why, gentlemen, you're inside there. So. proceed. Help! Laura! Please! Okay, that's enough. Bring her up. Bingo, Dr. Baker! It worked! Take a look at those beautiful welts. Just beautiful. What happened, Dr. Baker? Our problem in a nutshell: A toxic agent works once. but then it becomes useless once the alien's biology adapts. You've gone out of your way to give this. this lab animal. a living situation that's fit for a queen! I suggest you spend more time finding a way to 86 the damn thing. Colonel, you're welcome to replace me anytime you like. I'm sorry, gentlemen. Tell Dr. Baker we must continue testing. Aye, aye, sir. Why do you do this to me? I'm sorry, Eve. I've explained to you why we've got to do this. what happened with the first Sil. And why you have to be prepared. Survival of the fittest. I know. I watch this TV. and I see all the places I'm never gonna go. and see all the people I'm never gonna meet. Is that all I am to you? A laboratory animal? I want you to understand that the reason I took this job. was to make sure that these experiments were done with regard for you. Just don't forget that I'm human too. <i>Main gear touchdown.</i> <i>Shuttle ground support vehicles with flight surgeon and medical team.</i> <i>in the crew recovery vehicle are en route.</i> Thanks, Houston. It's good to be home. - Thanks. - You're welcome. On preliminary examination, all three of you are in remarkable health. though, of course, I'll continue more specific blood testing. We do have a few people here who would like a further examination. Boy, there's enough fine booty out there to cure what ails me. You're under quarantine, Mr. Gamble. No sexual activity for at least ten days. - And that means all of you. - Oh, you've gotta be kidding. No, I'm not kidding. <i>Back when President Kennedy began the space program.</i> I was just a very young assistant up on the Hill. It didn't take me long to realize that he was a visionary. and that I shared that vision. Later on, when I became a senator. I was determined to push our program even further into space. And so today, Jack Kennedy's vision. is maintained by the commitment of American business. But I like to think that his spirit is embodied. in young men like Patrick Ross. - When Patrick was five years old. - What happened to Patrick? I don't know, but he's missing some major butt-kissing from his own father. He hasn't been feeling very well tonight. Tell you the truth, I haven't been feeling so great either. Yeah, I think what we all need is a little tender loving care. So it's with pleasure that I introduce one of our finest young leaders, the captain of the Mars mission, and my son, Patrick Ross. I've gotta go. Lincoln suite, upstairs. Hurry. Captain Ross, everyone's waiting. This way, sir. Nice of you to show up. Thank you all for coming out this evening. Thank you, Father, for what I'm sure were overly kind words. I've been chosen on behalf of my wonderful crew. to represent the mission to Mars. and an image that comes to my mind. is looking through the porthole. at the blue-white globe. beautiful. so fragile, so small. And I thought to myself. how easy it would be to destroy all that God has created. I think, as we look to the future. our greatest mission might be right here at home. It's open. Come on in. My sister decided to join us. We share everything. together. <i>Parker's going for two, and he's in there, standing!</i> Pulse rate is 20 percent below human norm. What do you expect, Brea? She's watching baseball. Oh, God! You are a hero. Oh, God. It's my turn. Yes, it is. <i>Here it comes! Parker's going for three!</i> Jeez! Did someone hit a home run? My God, help me! Get off me! Marcy! Get him off me! Oh, my God! Help me, someone! - What the hell is going on? - My God! Last night, after the fund-raiser. something happened. I try to think about it, I draw a total blank. They always make those drinks at those fund-raisers strong. That's the way they get the wallets to open up. Billy, you tell that old son-of-a-bitch I won't take no for an answer. There's something wrong with me, Dad, since I got back. Do you think a trip to Mars was rough? You just wait till you try a senate campaign. Dad, listen to me. I'm having. I'm having some kind of breakdown. Stop thinking about the master plan and help me, all right? I'm scared. Goddamn it! Quit acting like a spoiled child. You're a Ross. Behave like one. And I'm gonna give you a piece of advice, boy. You keep your dick in your pants and your eyes on the prize. <i>Oh, I know what you been doin', and frankly, I don't give a damn.</i> But I have seen too many young men with promising careers. piss it all away on a piece of ass. People love you, Patrick. Hell, boy, they idolize you. You're gonna be President of the United States someday. Now, let's take a walk through the gallery. Some of my illustrious colleagues are just dyin' to get your autograph. Yes, sir. Yes, it's very important that I speak with Herman Cromwell. No, he's a patient there. <i>Well, can I get a message to him that Dr. Orinsky called</i> <i>from the lab at Oldham Space Center up in Maryland?</i> <i>Yes, it's very important that I speak to him.</i> <i>I'm an old colleague of his.</i> I can't believe this. Oh, my God! Company, halt! Left, left. <i>The substance found</i> <i>in Dr. Orinsky's wounds is combinant alien-human DNA.</i> <i>This DNA is structurally similar to Eve's.</i> but it's not a perfect match. Obviously, Eve has not left the compound. which means, gentlemen, that there's another one out there. None of our intelligence suggests that a foreign power was involved. How do we start looking for this thing? Well, I would suggest normal investigative procedure. to cultivate a list of possible suspects and then test their blood. Thank you, Dr. Baker. We may ask you to help us track it down. <i>Always a pleasure, gentlemen.</i> Get Press Lennox. Ladies and gentlemen, the embassy is secure. The hostages are free. Press Lennox. Diplomatic security. Provides embassy guards. and protects against. kidnapping and assassination. and also, of course, special services. like the demonstration we witnessed here today. Excuse me, Mr. Lennox. Somebody needs to see you right away. My assistant will answer any questions you might have. Thank you all very much. Ladies and gentlemen, are there any questions I can answer? Are you equipped with night vision attack capabilities? That was really, really great. Well? The answer is no. Press, we got another fucking alien on the loose. Get somebody else. Come on, buddy. Your country calls. Don't start waving the flag. I'm in the private sector now. I've got a business to run. Look at me, Press. You know how I got this goddamn eye. It's a sacrifice I'd make again in a heartbeat. But then maybe you haven't learned the meaning of sacrifice. Listen, pal. The last time I fought with that alien she-bitch. I almost got myself killed. If the government was stupid enough to make another one. I think they can clean up the mess by themselves. We didn't make this one. Count me out of the search party, okay? Where is my fucking key? A million dollars, tax free. Sure you won't reconsider? Welcome to Biohazard Four. Dr. Baker! Come out here! Oh, my God. Open the doors! Somebody open the doors! Get him away from there! Somebody open the doors! What the hell do you think you're doing? You know there's no men allowed in this lab. Get away! - Calm down, Dr. Baker. - Do you have respect for this? - Out now, both of you! - We have an emergency. Okay, we'll take it outside. - Damn well right we'll take it outside. - Don't blow a gasket. Don't patronize me. We're not patronizing. We're coming along. Close the doors. Laura, correct me if I'm wrong. Are you involved in this crazy bullshit? Dr. Baker runs this facility. She cloned the Sil embryo. Oh. Okay, well, what should I call her? Sil Lite? - Her name is Eve. - Eve. How very biblical. We have dampened her mating instinct. We have strictly avoided the presence of testosterone in this lab. At least until now. Thank you for your help in that area. What if she gets out of there? She's electronically tethered to a control box. One step off the premises, and a toxic capsule explodes in her brain. You know, it's really great to see you again. and I was hoping we'd meet under better circumstances. but, I remember Laura Baker having a little bit more soul. Just who the hell do you think you are? You're coming into my lab, questioning my motives! Are you two finished? We have a national fucking emergency on our hands! Now, you two will work together. That's a direct order from the Pentagon. You killed one of these fucking alien things before. Do it again. You heard the man. Now the fun begins. <i>I went over Orinsky's phone records, and this is the last place he called.</i> <i>There's a patient named Herman Cromwell.</i> Turns out he taught Orinsky at Stanford. And what exactly is Cromwell doing here? Well, that's the interesting part. It's classified top-secret information. I was doing research on a Mars meteorite. The one found in the Antarctic in '96? Fossils in the meteorite convinced us there might have been life on Mars. But these fossils weren't anything organic to the planet. Oh, no. And what was the basis for that determination? Carbon-based elements in the fossils. exist only in the Magellanic galaxy. That's 100 million light years away. Well, how did they get to Mars? By my reckoning. Mars was visited by an alien species. approximately one billion years ago. The species was like a plague, a cancer. It turned a thriving planet with. rivers and oceans and rudimentary plant life. into a useless hunk of rock. When I heard they were going to send a mission to Mars. I strongly urged the government to reconsider. On what grounds? On grounds that alien DNA might remain on the planet. that any human attempt to violate the planet. would result in biological contamination. So, let me guess. They told you to shove it up your ass. They got me fired from Stanford. It seems the military had strategic reasons for wanting to go to Mars. Outpost of the future, or some crap like that. Anyway, they harassed the shit out of me. I got into a fistfight with a Pentagon general. and broke his goddamn jaw. That's why they stuck you in here, right? Why do you think that Dr. Orinsky called you the night that he died? To tell me I was right. Whatever species destroyed Mars. those poor astronauts brought down to Earth. May God have pity on our souls. <i>I'll tell you one thing. For General Lee.</i> <i>to be eatin' up the road this early in the mornin'.</i> <i>something's sure got Bo and Luke all head up.</i> <i>I figure it's got somethin' to do with women.</i> <i>Or huntin'. Or maybe wheels.</i> The temperature on Mars is approximately 225 degrees below zero. If they brought the samples on board, the temperature thaw. could have brought the DNA back to life. That DNA could have infected the astronauts. This isn't the fucking X Files, goddamn it! You are following a lead based on the interrogation. of a certified nutcase. We got one dead N.S.E.G. doctor. we have a guy who warned the government not to go to Mars. they slapped him in a loony bin. and a seven-minute time gap during the space flight. We need to do blood analysis on Sampas, Gamble and Ross. Now, I know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days. on all interplanetary missions, and the Mars quarantine ends tonight. They could fuck the human race into extinction. You want to be responsible for that if we don't start testing everybody now? Test Patrick first. Yeah. I've been waiting to get you alone. All the interviews, all the screaming girls. all the hoopla. gone. Push it out of your mind. Patrick Ross. tonight. you're mine. I love you. What's the matter? I don't know. We should hold off. Oh, no. No, you don't. Not tonight. Come on, Missy. I don't feel so good. Relax. Let me do the work. There's nobody here. Where the fuck did he go? Let's go find the others. I missed you up there. I missed you so much. It's so beautiful. Not as beautiful as you are. Charmer. Take it easy, Press. You're gonna get us killed. Trust me, Laura. I got a bad feeling in my stomach. God, I missed making love with you. Oh, my stomach! - Oh, my God! - Call someone! Call for help! Up here. Come on! No, please! Oh, God. I'm gonna get a full crew. I'm gonna get 'em over here right away. We gotta get to the others. Oh, this is awful. This is just awful. I'll take her the rest of the way. Have a good evening. This is nice. You thought I lived on a tugboat. I know what you thought. But I got it all under control now. Oh, you do? Yeah, you just slide right over there. Let me open this door. There we go. Hey, girl. - Is that it? - No, honey, that's not it. Right there. No, that's not it. Oh, that's it. What's wrong? Dennis Gamble, we'd like you to come with us. Man, a brother just can't get no booty. You know what I'm sayin'? This is no way to treat a national hero. This is embarrassing. What is this all about? Look, somebody speak to me. Hey, I'm a personal friend of Senator Judson Ross, okay? Personal friend. I'm gonna eat your badge for breakfast. Get your hand off my head, man. I demand an explanation. We'll have the test results in a few minutes. Why am I being tested? N.S.E.G. said I was fine. Sit tight, son. We'll explain everything later. Well, it's kind of tough to sit tight, sir. I haven't been laid in 11 months. That's unusual for me. Take it easy, Burgess. Everybody deserves an explanation. You're damn right. And what's with all these guards? What the hell is going on around here? It's purely a precautionary measure. We need a couple of minutes for the blood analysis, so just relax. Couple of questions. What can you tell us about the seven minutes when the Excursion lost contact? I can't remember. I don't know if I blacked out, I can't remember. When did you last speak to Anne Sampas? At that fund-raiser the other night. Did she act peculiar? She seemed fine to me. What's this all about? Something happen to her? You tell me. What happened to Anne Sampas? Tell me what happened to her! Anne Sampas is dead. I'm sorry, Dennis. Yeah. Laura. Well, the combinant DNA in Anne's body doesn't match what I found in Orinsky's. So, it's either Gamble or Ross. Be careful, Press. What was the cause of death? We don't know. Come on. How the hell did she die? Sequence almost complete. - Why are you testing my blood? - Ten seconds till relay. - You think I killed Annie? - Data retrieval on-line. - Is that what you think? - Five seconds. Three seconds. I didn't kill her! I swear! Computer says normal. There is no sign of infection. - Go home, get some rest. - Look, I want answers! In due time. We'll be in touch. Yo, Gamble. You know where Patrick Ross is? Nope. Well, if you see him, you'll let me know, yeah? Sure. Well, let's see what the cranial cavity has to say. Now I'll just reach behind her ear, and we should. God. Patrick, no! Want a date, mister? I was scared, man. This is crazy. His whole head just grew right back like some sort of damn freak show. The alien species can regenerate living tissue. Aliens, little green men. I still can't believe it. If they knew there were aliens up there, why did they send us? N.S.E.G. got warned but they chose to ignore it. We think that there was some hostile DNA in the soil samples that you collected. Something happened up there. I can't remember exactly. I just know it was terrible. I'm sure that it was terrible. The question is: How do we proceed now? I got guys out there all over the place looking for this kid. Any place he might be. We're gonna find him sooner or later. If he's reproducing, we've got potential offspring. I think it's safe to assume he's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. Well, then in less than two weeks, these offspring reach adolescence. and then they enter the chrysalis stage. Chrysalis stage? A cocoon which turns them into adults. Hey, baby, turn that car around. Hey, don't leave me. Come on. Hi, honey. Baby, come back. <i>A serial killer may be loose in the Washington-Maryland area.</i> <i>Authorities have asked the public to be extremely cautious.</i> <i>when approached by strangers.</i> How much for number three? Twenty an hour. <i>Thank you, Linda. And now for the financial news.</i> Twenty, forty, sixty. Thank you much. Enjoy yourself. Come in. See what I mean, Laura? Every so often, her rates go berserk. Fifty agents we got out there looking for this guy. We got nothing. Man, how can you just touch that? Occupational hazard. So, you didn't see nothing, didn't hear nothing, don't know nothing? They come and they go. You know what I mean? They come and they go. Oh, that's hysterical. Sit your ass down. They come, they go. You get it? Oh, yeah, I get it. Here you go. Thanks. We're wasting time. It's been two days, and Lennox hasn't made any headway. Maybe that's because you gentlemen won't allow us to go public. Dr. Baker, you said that Eve has telepathic abilities. Some. Can we send her after Patrick? It'd be foolish to take her out of a controlled atmosphere. There's the danger of escape. Then we'd have two aliens loose, instead of one. If these two were to mate, the resulting pure strain of offspring. would be unstoppable. Well, can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab? We've seen spiking in her biorhythms. which indicate a rudimentary connection. but half her alien genes are dormant. Tracking Patrick is out of her league. Dormant means asleep. Is there any way that we can wake them up? We could use the lab's cyclotron. to bombard her with radiation that would awaken her dormant genes. But there is a problem. What's that? We make her more alien. We increase her strength, her anger. Her mating drive would go through the roof. It's worth the risk. We'll tighten security. She is not a lab animal. She is half-human. Please, Baker, spare us the alien rights agenda. Put her in the cyclotron. And what if I refuse? That's your prerogative. She's gonna go in anyway. Gentlemen. Don't worry, Laura. I know what they want. I'm sorry. This is not what I intended. It's gonna be very painful for you. I want to help. I'm going to radiate for 45 seconds then shut it down. I'm connected, Laura. I see what he sees. <i>He's driving down a small street.</i> <i>I see two-story buildings.</i> <i>a man walking a small dog.</i> They're stopping at a stoplight. Okay, here we go! <i>I see street signs.</i> Gwynn's Falls and Warwick! - Intersection of Gwynn's Falls. - He's in a parking lot! <i>- What? - Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.</i> Gwynn's Falls? Where? That's in Reservoir Hill! There's a big supermarket! He's going into the supermarket near Gwynn's Falls and Warwick. Hang on to your shorts! - He's going after a woman! - Let's go! How the hell did you get a drivers' license? Where is he? Aisle one. Fruits and vegetables! He's in aisle one, fruits and vegetables. We're there. Now what? Come on, Press! My God! It's you! - Will you sign my Space Flakes box? - Sure. You got a pen? I do. What's your name? Darlene. "Darlene." You know a secret? I think Space Flakes taste like shit. - Which row? - Cereal! Come on, Press. Watch it! Where's the goddamn cereal? Nice to meet you. Really nice to meet you. It's her! Help me! Which way? Quick! Which way? What she say? They're going down some stairs. A basement! Find a basement! <i>It's dark.</i> He wants to mate with her! Get away! Get up! Shut up! Help! Get down! - Damn it! - No! Help! He's trying to rape her! Man, don't shoot! Why don't you get a motel? Fuckin' kids. He knows I'm tapping in. Help! Leave me alone! Stop! Get off me! Eve. Patrick! Go on! Get out of here! Get out! - Don't move, spaceman. - Put down the gun. Get your hands up! Get 'em up! What is this? You can't deny some bugged-out stuff going on around here. What kind of stuff? You told me yourself you were feeling weird. You gotta go in for tests, bro. Sure. I don't mind going into the lab. Open the gate. What's going on? Estrogen level's peaking. It's like she's in heat. Let me out! Let me out! Let's go. Has she been given any medication? Yes, her usual dose. Let me out, Laura! I'm going to double it. Let me out! Listen to me, Laura. Laura! Code 459 alert. Patrick Ross in Biohazard Four. Seal the compound! Get out of there, Sherry! Patrick, leave her alone! Open the door. I know what you're going through, and I can help you. - Let me help you. - Open the goddamn door. I can't do that. I'm sorry. - Open it! - I can't. Get away from her now! The proof is incontrovertible. Your son was infected up in that capsule. I'm sorry, Senator. Jesus God. Rest assured we'll deal with this quietly. Medical treatment, the best doctors. The last thing this country needs is a spectacle with a national hero being publicly compromised. Cut the crap, Carter. What the hell are we gonna do? Two imperatives: We have to find Patrick and bring him in immediately. We have to neutralize any possibility that this could leak to the media. The generals are very concerned. They're gonna kill him, aren't they? We need to find your son. You listen to me, you arrogant son-of-a-bitch. If you touch a hair on his head. you will rue the day you were born! You make it very hard to help you, Senator. Go fuck yourself! What the hell did you think I'd do? Stand here and let you take my son? I'll call the goddamn President if I have to. Listen carefully, old man. This is way beyond the President. Way beyond. You wanna save Patrick? Help us bring him in. Damn, man! What is up? I can't even get no play from an alien. Some people carry a disease in their genetic code. The possibility exists it might be passed on to their children. Those N.S.E.G. doctors told me I had sickle trait. It's in your chart. You don't have sickle-cell anemia, which is why you were able to go to Mars. But you're a carrier. Right. Well, I guess that's why he didn't get infected up on the ship. Right. Alien DNA cannot cope with human genetic flaws. It has no defense against our diseases, and that might be our answer. What could be the answer? Alien DNA infected us. It's about time we infected them. What? Patrick. Dad, what are you doing here? I kind of figured you'd show up here. You always used to love this place as a child. So did your mother. I never could convince her to get rid of it. Yeah, I used to come here when I was courting her. - And after she died. - What do you want? Well. First off, I'd like to apologize. Apologize for what? Oh, Paddy. Don't bother. They told me what happened. how you got infected up on Mars. I'm sorry, Paddy. for not listening when you asked for help. You never listened. I'm listening now. They're gonna kill me. Not if I can help it. Now, there's no way that they can find you here. This property's still listed under you mother's maiden name. And I sure as hell am not gonna hand you over to those Pentagon bastards. No, sir. I'm taking you in to Johns Hopkins. for treatment with the best. We'll walk through that door together. Come in with me, son. No. I know you won't do it for me. But try to think of your mother. Do it for her. Dad, help me. It's okay. It's okay. Eve. We need your help again to find Patrick. I'm sorry, Laura. I can't do that. We could just call in the National Guard. Sorry, pal. This is strictly a private mission. Yeah, well, I'm a lover. I'm not a fighter. You haven't been one of those in 11 months. Why you gotta bring that up? Okay, I was a lover. I sure as hell ain't no damned bounty hunter. This looks about right. What? That little, old tiny ass thing? You ain't got no bazookas up in here? Bazookas? Hasn't anyone ever told you that size doesn't matter? I mean, you can talk all that noise if you want to. I'm taking this because I'm about to go back to Africa on somebody's ass. I've used Dennis' blood sample as the basis for this toxin. Of course, I have no idea whether or not this is going to work. It's an interesting idea. It might be the only chance we got. But what if it doesn't work? Well, then, my friend, we're fucked. Get the tether! <i>Containment breach.</i> We're locked in here! <i>Electronic tether, armed for activation</i> <i>in five, four.</i> <i>three, two, one.</i> It's stuck.

Press, use my blood! Quick! Get up! When did you start smoking? Just now. I wonder if I should have this stuff analyzed. Yeah, maybe you should. You might turn into a sexual predator. - Yeah, I guess that's possible. - It'd be okay with me. I have a drag? - All right, one, two, three. - Up! - Easy. - Got it. Oh, now y'all show up. after we do all the work. I wanna talk to the general. Know what I'm saying? Mr. Gamble, I need you to lie back for me. - Yes, I'll be glad to. - Nice and easy.

This is not the way you transport nitro! What's your name, missy? Dora. My mother's name was Dora. Oh, really? What kind of lady are you? She's mine! I feel like a ditty. Go on, girl! Sing! Okay, it's a ditty. "Sons of the South." Here you are. Tempo. Back on up, now. General "Bloodbath" McGrath. Sons of the South, come to glory Sons of the South Arise That's a lot of ham for these skinny legs, let me tell you! That's a new one. Look! Let me out! Please! -This room's occupied. -I'll say. Don't let the ear frighten you. I lost it at Chickamauga. Really? One can hardly notice. Would you help me undress? I always have trouble undoing this clasp. Thank you. What's this? Why, it's a deep, deep pool. Maybe it's your old swimming hole, general. Are you feeling sleepy? Yes, I'm sleepy. Now you'll be my little doggy. When I say "speak," you'll tell me everything. Understood? Very good. Which scientist is in that sack in the other room. Dr. Escobar? Speak. You can speak words, you stupid mutt. Who do you work for? Who paid you to kidnap Escobar? No, watch the swirling spiral. Watch the. Bad dog! Bad dog! Watch. Damn! Stay! Stay! Bad dog! Didn't mean to startle you. Looked like you could use help. Looks can be deceiving, dark stranger. I'm fine. I'm sure you are, ma'am. Big, sturdy gal like you probably gets top dollar too. Here you go. Run along. I'm gonna sing my old friend McGrath a lullaby. I need him! You got your money. Run along! Have a little dignity. West! That'd be an awful career decision. West! West! Go! Go get him! Get Escobar out of here! Stop or I'll squeeze. U.S. Army! Stay out of my way, lady! I'm not a lady! I'm a U.S. marshal! Stay out of my way! "Get out of my way, get out of my way. U.S. Army. U.S. marshal." Oh, dear! Federal agents inside, sir. So Miss Lippenreider informs me, Mr. Hudson. Still, I believe good manners dictate that we should send out the welcome wagon. Now what? Whoa, there, partner! The war may have got you 40 acres and a mule but you can't just traipse into the President's office. Give me that gun. What, that one? What about that one? -That'll get you killed. -Gentlemen! Don't make Captain West any later than he already is. There've been a lot of death threats. The Cabinet made me hire these damned detectives. Drink? Cigar? Don't mind if I do, sir. So I understand you let General McGrath get away. That's not exactly the way it happened. -Some half-a-sissy masquerading as. -Artemus Gordon. You know him? Of course. He's the best marshal I've got. A kind of genius. Gordon has proven himself as a cunning operator, with a rapacious intellect. Nothing will stop him from completing a mission except maybe the impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy. Who are you, mister? What do you mean, who am I? I am the President of the United States. Wrong answer. Who are you? I am the President of the. I'm Artemus Gordon. How did you know? The President went to West Point. That says Harvard. Very observant. Somebody mind telling me what's going on? President Grant. Sir, these are perilous times. I was merely demonstrating how someone, using the art of disguise could penetrate into the very bowels of the White House, sir. You're clever, Gordon. One day it's going to get you killed. Like today. And, West, not every situation calls for your approach of "shoot first shoot later, shoot some more then when everybody's dead, try to ask a question or two." Working together will be good. -Working together? -With all due respect. You'll work the way your Commander in Chief tells you to. Well, I was coming to that, sir. Gentlemen, America's top scientists in the fields of physics, hydraulics, explosives all kidnapped in the last year, and all by General McGrath, it now appears. You two have been working on the same case the whole time. Why did it take so long to figure it out? One of us was trying to catch McGrath, and the other was trying to marry him. We don't have time for this. Only one week, if we believe this. "General Grant, the scientists you seek are in my employ creating a weapons system beyond the pale of contemporary imagination. I suggest you put your affairs in order. You have one week before you will surrender the U.S. government." The letter was delivered today with that cake. -It's marzipan, isn't it? -Careful. It's McGrath, sir. McGrath may be a vicious killer, but a mastermind he is not. So whom do we seek? After consulting with Intelligence. McGrath is on his way to New Orleans. The longer we stay here the farther he gets. I don't need Intelligence. You'd rather rely on stupidity. I am leaving today for Utah where the transcontinental railroads will be joined at Promontory Point. You two are the best I've got. Put aside your differences and find this madman, whoever he is, and stop him. You have one week. Dismissed. Gentlemen. The Wanderer is at your disposal. Engine number five, track six. Mr. Gordon, the item you requested. Thank you. Figures. My new invention. The Bi-Valve Interior Combustion Twice-Exhausted Bi-Axle Nitro-Cycle. Save it. Got a train to catch. Not if I catch it first. Nice horse! Gordon! Stop the train! Hey! I'm warning you! Gordon! Stop the train! Come in. Have a seat. Stop the train! Stop smiling at me! How nice of you to drop in. All right. Let's drop the beards, the bikes, the fake boobies. Let's set that needlepoint aside and handle this like men. As a matter of clarification, this is not needlepoint. This is needlepoint. I'm putting the final touches on my latest invention. I call it The Impermeable. It's a vest. When worn under clothing it can stop any bullet, fired even at close range. -Is that so? -But I haven't tested it fully yet. Guns. I find them primitive and unnecessary if one's done one's proper planning. I have always felt that allowing any situation to degenerate into violence constitutes a failure on my part. Well, Mr. Gordon you failed. All right, Mr. West, we'll settle this like men. I love this train. Cheers! While you're down there, feel free to make use of my Sub-Carriage Inter-Rail Vehicular Egressor. I designed it myself! I've been thinking. Maybe the President's right. We should put aside our differences and work together. Fight each other all you please. Harm my train I'll douse you like dogs. That's my truffle reduction sauce. Let's get on about our President's business, shall we? -Where to? -New Orleans. Why don't we let Professor Morton decide? I don't need some nobody professor telling me where to head. Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton, kidnapped from M.I.T. six months ago. Expert in the field of metallurgy. Discovered in a field of alfalfa. That's a man's head. This magnetic collar was found about six feet away, near his body. Still trying to figure that out. That's a man's head. According to the Retinal Terminus Theory, a dying person's last image burns into his eyeball like a photo. Perhaps there's a clue. I give you Morton's last image. That's a man's head. Refraction of the lenses causes the image to appear upside down, so we. That is a man's head. Voilà! McGrath. Something's in his pocket. It's too fuzzy to see. Mortification of the aqueous humor's led to a loss. Glasses. "Friends of the South, come to a costume ball, April 14, half past 8. 346 Pine Court, Garden District." New Orleans. Gypsy queen.pirate. How about this? Come as my manservant. Why, yes'um, Master Gordon! I swears I'd be delighted! I sing, I dance for you, sir. I swears none of the white folks'll know I'd rather shoot myself than play your damn manservant. You must wear something. It's a costume party. This is all I need to wear. If you insist on a firearm, I have something you'll find intriguing. I designed it to go with this. Jim West does not wear costumes. Very well. What's your plan? I was thinking I'd go as a government agent who'll kill General Bloodbath McGrath. An armed, Negro cowboy costume in a room full of white former slave owners. You'll win first prize. Listen, the art of disguise is what we need to get into the party to find the kidnapped scientists before they're forced to create something that'll destroy the U.S. You and I have been handpicked by the President. Our freedom is at stake, and this is our duty as men. You go as a riverboat captain, and I'll be a saloon girl. Let me tell you something about your art of disguise. That night at Fat-Can's, it wasn't difficult to see you weren't a woman. I was propositioned by three men. You looked nasty. Just butt-ugly. I mean, your breasts were hard and stiff and stuck out like a couple of rusty cannons on a sunken ship. These breasts are a work of art. Aesthetically and scientifically perfect. They look like shit. -Touch them. -I'm not touching those! Afraid you're wrong? Touch my breasts! Just one. Touch one! Happy? I'm touching them. I knew it! Squeeze it gently. Not that hard! Now you've shifted all the buckwheat around. Buckwheat? That's your problem. What are you doing? Now touch my breast. That's what a breast should feel like. Very nice. -Now touch yourself. -Oh, my God, I'm hard! I was just gonna jot down a note. You could put a gun on that. Then where would I keep my pencil? I think you underestimate the convenience of a pocket. What are you doing here, boy? I sorry, sir. I was hoping. I was hoping I wouldn't have to break your nose. White folks. Get your hands off me! Put me in the dungeon with those smelly, bearded men, but I won't get on that! -You applied for the position. -A standing-up one! I'm an entertainer. Stop complaining. You'll enjoy it. An authentic cowboy outfit, complete with six-guns. What a terribly clever costume, Mr.? West. Jim West. West meets East. Mae Lee East. Ma'am. Are you here alone, Mr. West? I'm looking to surprise an old friend, General McGrath. You haven't seen him? I don't think that name was on our guest list. And I would know. I am Dr. Loveless' personal assistant. Dr. Arliss Loveless? Funny how some folks think he's dead. Tonight is his coming-out party. See anybody that looks familiar? Matter of fact, I do. I am jealous. Don't be. Meet me later in the foyer. Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord He is trampling out the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored He has loosed the fateful lightning Of His terrible swift sword His truth is marching on Don't you just hate that song? Why, y'all look like you've seen a ghost. It's me, dear friends. Alive and kicking. Well, alive, anyway. We may have lost the war but heaven knows we haven't lost our sense of humor. No, not even when we lost a lung a spleen a bladder two legs 35 feet of small intestine and our ability to reproduce, all in the name of the South! Do we ever lose our sense of humor? Now, I owe a deep debt of gratitude to our friends from across the sea for their comfort and kindness. So mi casa es su casa! Let the party begin! Mr. West. How nice of you to join us and add color to these monochromatic proceedings. When one comes back from the dead I find that an occasion to stand up, be counted. Miss East informs me that you expected to see General McGrath here. I knew him years ago but I haven't seen him in a coon's age. It'd be difficult for a man of your stature to keep in touch with even half the people you know. Perhaps Miss East will keep you from being a slave to your disappointment. Beautiful women encourage you one minute then cut the legs out from under you. Quite. Will you excuse me? Thank you. You're in for a big surprise when you get this one in the saddle. Stupid cowboy! He mistake you for me. Dr. Loveless, our cause is in a grave situation. Since the nitro and guns were destroyed, lice and demoralization has set in. General McGrath, if I may interrupt. Your men will have their weapons tonight and they will be part of the greatest military victory of this century. So have your men here at 10:00 tonight. You, sir, are a pip. I'd follow you into the jaws of Cerberus hisself. And so you shall. Please! Somebody help me out! I said to meet me in the foyer. Foyer? I've never been much good with French. Au contraire. So let's see, Mr. West. Are you a dangerous spy of some sort or just a handsome cowboy who likes to poke around? I believe I'm that second one. East and West. Never the twain shall meet. First, I'd like to reiterate that you make one ugly woman. Second, while you were out here, I found out Dr. Loveless is meeting McGrath and his troops in an hour. You go right ahead, enjoy the party. I'm gonna save the Republic. By the way, boobies look great tonight. Nice and perky! Hang him! We need to teach y'all a lesson about how to behave in polite society. Never drum on a white lady's boobies at a big redneck dance. Got it. Sure am glad we got that cleared up. My God! Excuse me, am I intruding? I feel I know you from somewhere. Nice try, buster. I look like something out of James Fenimore Cooper but I mean you no harm. My name is Artemus Gordon and if I'm not mistaken, you're in trouble. Allow me. I'm Rita. I was hired as an entertainer. Not that I'm complaining, but why are you here? I'm looking for some missing scientists, not that I'm complaining. I'm a special U.S. marshal on assignment from the President. If you're so special, how come you're looking up here when Loveless has them in the dungeon? The dungeon has been cleared out. I checked it after sampling the gumbo, which was a bit heavy on the okra. There you are. Thank you. Artemus, was it? It was. I don't forget a face that easily. Like to have everybody's attention. We've had a series of major misunderstandings this evening and I'd like to take a minute to clear a few of them up. First of which the whole drumming on the boobies thing. In my native land. -Georgia? -Africa. .my ancestors used drums to communicate between villages. I'm sure y'all can see how with this gal, we can communicate all the way to Baton Rouge. On a clear night, we might even get Galveston. All I was saying to the gal was, "Nice dress, darling. Good to see you. My name's Jim. How's your mama?" Then there was the redneck comment. And I'm getting the sense that y'all took that negatively. But let's break down that word. "Redneck." First word: Red. Color of passion, fire, power. Second word: Neck. Neck. I can't think of anything for "neck," but y'all still got "red." That's something to be proud of. And between us, the whole slavery thing I don't understand what the big deal was anyway. Who wouldn't want folks running around doing chores? Are you gonna get your big, fat ass out of bed and pick your own damn cotton? I don't think so. So let's head on inside, knock us back some shine. IKick this shindig off the right way! Come on! Put this thing away. Come on! Let's go inside! Let's hang him! All right, hold on. Hold on! I stand before you as a man realizing that I've done something wrong. I'd like the opportunity to make it right. Will you marry me? That means "no." Darling, listen. Would it help if I said I thought you were a man? Something's funny about that rope! Thank you! We had a lovely time! "Hang him! Hang him!" I ought to shoot you right now. Allow me to introduce you to my trigger-happy partner, James West who doesn't realize that my Expanding Rope invention was a diversion allowing me to search for the missing scientists. Scientists? This is Rita. I found her in a cage in Loveless' bedroom. She's an entertainer. I'm afraid I haven't been quite honest with you. My name is Rita Escobar. I came to find Guillermo Escobar, the scientist. My father. Sorry to interrupt, but I gotta get to Malheureux Point. Malheureux Point? He's so impetuous. Yes, he's an idiot. Well, general, it's been a long journey from New Liberty. Not a day goes by that I don't contemplate it. So do I. If I'd had the scientific understanding of gunpowder and primers I have today I might've been standing here. That's not what I meant. You meant the stomach-churning carnage that earned you your unfortunate nom de guerre. What was that nickname again? Bloodbath McGrath. The Butcher of New Liberty. They ought to be here by now. Maybe we're in the wrong place. We're supposed to wait exactly on this here spot. You sawed-off sadistic bastard! You betrayed us! Having donated half my being to create a weapon capable of doing this how did you and General Lee repay my Ioyalty? You surrendered at Appomattox! So who betrayed whom? Munitia, make note the turret speed must be accelerated. Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8. Scream.scream. "Help me." "Do not pull my arm!" I demand you give the order to stop this slaughter now! We'll need more loading drills. I hear too much time between screams. Give them the order to desist! I understand your distress, but these men are not dying senselessly. It is for a far greater cause than you can possibly imagine. You go straight to hell, sir! After you, sir. Bloodbath McGrath indeed. That concludes the festivities. Ladies, feed him to the crabs. Since the beginning of written history, a nation's power has been determined by the size of its army. Tonight, that chapter will be closed. The traditional army, to say nothing of the United States, will become extinct. Laid low by a cripple as the general so amusingly implied and "mechanology." But that tank is just a little hors d'oeuvre compared to what the country's scientists are cooking up. So, if I have piqued your interest bring 1000 kilograms of gold to Spider Canyon within the next four days. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a tank to catch. Judging from the position of these bodies it laid down a 360-degree pattern of cannon fire. I think I'm gonna be sick. My God! What kind of weapon did this? It rolls on and on, screeching like a wounded animal. It has a cabin on top with a cannon. It swivels around like an eagle's head. You saw it? Heard about it. I thought it was crazy survivors' stories. Survivors? Not here. New Liberty, Illinois, a free slave town just over the border. A week before the war ended in '65, I was with the 9th Cavalry. We discovered old folks, women and children slaughtered. They used them for target practice. That's when I vowed to chase this yellow devil to his grave. What's wrong, West? I thought you'd be glad to see me like this. Actually, I'm kind of disappointed. I was hoping to kill the Butcher of New Liberty myself. Well, go on, shoot. Send me on to hell. But if you want the devil that's responsible for New Liberty it's Loveless. He manned the machine there. He killed all them children, old folks just like he killed my boys here. Where is he? Where did he go? Where's he going?! I know that. I'll tell you if you take me along. You'll tell me, or I'll leave you here. The girls at the mansion, you know, they talk. "I wonder if my hair will get frizzy in the desert." "Where is this Oo-tah anyway?" Utah. Let's go, Coleman. Utah. Aye, sir. Why couldn't we give her a ride home to Texas? It's on the way. On our way to Utah, where our President is. How you feel about that coincidence? We wouldn't have known where Loveless was going if not for her. Seems a bit ungracious, if not perilous. She'd have been in our way. She and I'd have wound up in the saddle. That's funny, I got the feeling she was more interested in me. I've tried to place myself in Loveless' shoes. Good luck with that one. What could a maniac with no reproductive organs want with Rita? Which is not to say that Rita doesn't possess a beauty worthy of a Shakespeare sonnet or a Botticelli painting. The curvature of her buttocks and the swell of that magnificent bosom! So full, so sumptuous. So.what were all those foreign ministers doing at Loveless' party? This is what really puzzles me. Did you have any idea there were so many? -How long has she been here? -Somewhere around Botticelli's buttocks. I am profoundly sorry. I'll spare you the embarrassment. Make a sandwich. You're getting off. I know why those foreign guys were at Loveless' party. This is fantastic. How do you cook it? I mean, you can cut it with a fork. In a daubière. It's a clay pot. It's a French method. Foreign ministers. They were mad about something, you know, like there was some real bad deal in Louisiana on purpose. The Louisiana Purchase. And Queen somebody of France got swindled. Queen Isabella of Spain. This is ridiculous. Coleman, stop the train. -Miss Escobar's getting off. -Who the hell is Miss Escobar? A frightened, starving, half-naked woman who wants to find her father. Half-naked? Coleman, stop the train! We're not putting anybody off here in the middle of nowhere! Especially if they're half-naked! Please, Jim. My father's the only family I've got. Am I to sit at home and wait for news that he's been killed, or do something? What would you do? I don't have anything against you. What happens when we find Loveless and you're still on this train? I know you'd never let him take me back. I've seen you shoot. I'll assure you any attack by Loveless would be an exercise in futility. I'll demonstrate how my design suggestions have made the Wanderer completely impervious to attack. Over here, three seemingly innocent billiard balls, yes? Depress the number, it's a sleeping-gas bomb effective in under three seconds. So put your mind at ease. You are safe within these walls. I don't know about you, but I'll sleep better assuming Loveless barges in here to play pool. And speaking of sleeping, I'm really tired, Artie. Could I borrow something to wear? -I have just. -I got something you can wear. It ain't stylish, but it won't explode when you put it on. That would be nice. Loveless kidnapped a few metallurgists, so whatever he's building will have armor. He kidnapped a couple chemists so it'll have explosives. According to you, Rita's father's the world's foremost expert in hydraulics so the thing's gonna move. What could he build that'd make the President surrender the government? A bedside heater. What? Rita needs a bedside heater. It gets quite chilly. That's what I was talking about. The distraction. What? Good night, and thank you for saving me. Good night. That outfit. -Is most becoming. -Lovely. I hope it's not too breezy. -Back there. -But if there's anything. Anything at all. I'm right here. Aren't you boys nice? Well, sweet dreams. I told you she'd be a distraction. She's not a distraction. It's nice having her on board. She's a breath of fresh ass. Pardon me? You said "ass." No, I said, "It's nice having her on board. She's a breast of fresh air." Let's just get some shut-ass. We have Loveless. Seven hundred yards and closing. Maintain this speed. I'm coming up. -What's that? -I took the liberty of installing that while you slept. Don't take liberties with my things! Very good. I've only made one or two additions to your wardrobe. Am I missing something here? If we are pursuing Loveless why is he behind us? That's why. What's going on? Nothing. It's fine. Get down. -Push that magic button. -What are you doing? Seeing if your Egressor works. We need a plan. -Push the button! -Very good. He's so courageous. Would you pull on one of those pool cues? -This one? -Thank you. Courage is only as good as the machinery that supports it. Good luck. I have them square in my sights, sire. As do l, Munitia. As do I! Fire away! That's it! I won't let Loveless take me away! -I'd rather be dead! -That's not a good thing to wish for! Please, Artie! Don't leave me alone! Ladies, we need a new train. -Give me the ball. I have a plan. -I won't! It's Loveless! -No, it isn't. -Yes, it is! An innocent billiard ball this way, but depress the number and on impact it ruins our mission. -Don't move! -Let go of my leg. Loveless has fitted us with the same metal device we found on Morton. Good morning, gentlemen. I trust you slept well. -What have you done with Rita? -Rita, is it? How familiar! Rita is sleeping off the aftereffects in the stateroom. She is quite lovely, isn't she? Who knows? I might even become familiar with her myself. -That'd be one more reason to kill you. -Oh, yes, Mr. West. To a well-endowed blackamoor like yourself it seems impossible that a freak like me could enjoy the pleasure of a woman. But having witnessed my use of mechanology thus far don't you think I'd devise something for my lower body that was hard-pumping and indefatigably steely? And speaking of hard-pumping, Mr. Coleman full steam ahead. What a marvelous train. You don't mind me borrowing it, do you? Aside from a lack of wheelchair access I find it a most comfortable way to pass the long miles to my laboratory in Spider Canyon. By the way, I'll be seeing President Grant at Promontory Point. What shall I tell him for you? I'm afraid it can't be that you're alive and well. Get out your tool kit. Get this off my neck. My tools are gone. "Welcome to Loveless Experimental Camp for Political Dissidents. There are no guards, no barbed wires. Stay within the perimeter, you'll stay alive." I don't have time for this. See? Nothing. And now we have to run. The collars around our necks seem to contain powerful magnets! As long as we can outrun the blade, we'll be fine! How long does it take a magnet to lose its power? -About 400 years! -Damn! The gully! The gully! Run for the gully! Go, Gordon! Go! Leap into my arms! Now! Bless you. Sorry. Rita, my dear. Not that I'm ungrateful to Providence for bringing you back but I have to confess I'm a bit curious as to how you managed to wind up with them. They seemed so sure they could find you, I thought if I stayed with them they'll bring me back to all my friends. Not to give you a big head, but I kind of missed you. Well, isn't that a coincidence? Because I kind of miss me too. What's your plan for getting this thing off my neck? Excuse me? That's what you're here for. You're the master of this mechanical stuff. Oh, I see. Now I'm the master of this mechanical stuff. As opposed to five minutes ago, when I tried to find an intelligent solution to this problem. Then something happened. Someone, who'll remain nameless. Jim! West! .decided to jump over the wire providing us with that romp through the cornfield and that death-defying leap into the abysmal muck! And here we stand, while that demented maniac hurtles toward our President on our one and only mode of transportation with Rita as prisoner, armed with machinery of mass destruction with the simple intention of taking over the country. -You need to calm down. -I can't be calm. I'm the master of the mechanical stuff! And I have to help you! You! The master of the stupid stuff! Wanna get your collar off? I'll get it off! I don't have a gun. Otherwise, I'd shoot it off! Here's something in the true Jim West style! I'll bash it with a rock! You don't wanna do that. Oh, but I do! -What did you do? -I didn't do shit! You've reversed the polarity of your magnet. I did not do shit! Be still! Be still! I'll put my foot in your chest. Push off. You all right? I'm just peachy. Can you help me get my boot off? Sorry. And that would be my belt buckle. When you tell this story to your grandkids, leave this part out. Don't worry. I'll undo your belt. I'll run that way, you run the other way. Let me understand your plan. You'll run fast that way and I'll run fast that way. -It's ingenious. -Whatever, Gordon. One two three! Oh, look. My auxiliary tool kit. I forgot about it. It must've slipped out of my pocket. Your pocket? Why wasn't it on some contraption that shoots out your ass? That's the first place Loveless would've looked. What? Nothing. No, thank you. I'm fine. Not quite myself out here. There's a very large spider on your hand. He's just trying to get warm. How is it you know so much about the desert? I lived out here as a boy. I was raised by the Indians. Really? Now that is. Look, a desert wasp one of the world's greatest hunters. She'll kill the tarantula, lay her eggs inside so her babies will have food when they hatch. Now I'm really hungry. So how did your parents, who I assume were Negro feel about you being raised by Indians? They didn't have too much to say. I was sent to another plantation as a boy. Ran away as soon as my legs were strong enough to take me. Did you ever see your family again? They were at the camp at New Liberty. I'll help you get him, Jim. You have no idea where we're going, do you? I know exactly where we're going. Going to Spider Canyon. We'd get there a lot faster if you weren't dragging that thing around. A lot of scientific ingenuity and hard work went into this. It'd be a shame to discard it. You never know when a high-powered magnet might come in handy. When you're right, you're right. Loveless' private track. This is not a mirage. If this isn't a mirage, then that. Is Spider Canyon. What now, Mr. Plan Man? What do we have? Intelligence, a sense of purpose, the element of surprise. So what does Loveless have? He has his own city. He has an 80-foot tarantula. Yes, well, I was coming to that. Nice to see an invention that actually works. Most impressive. If a little ungainly. He's trapped. That thing'll never get past those rocks. Let's go! Gordon, let's ride! You do know how to ride. -Yes, I know how to ride. -A horse. Yes, when something primitive is called for. How about now? A giant spider's stomping toward our President. I was thinking of another spider. Remember when that wasp destroyed the tarantula? The wasp had a slight advantage. It could fly. Exactly. In 1540, Leonardo da Vinci designed a flying machine, but never finished it. With some extrapolation and a bit of imagination, I've. We don't have time for your plans or half-baked inventions. We gotta stick to what we each do best. "May God continue the unity of our country as this railroad unites the two great oceans of this world." Good Lord! Well, now, isn't this a coincidence? I'm out for a little morning ride and in the middle of nowhere I bump into General Ulysses S. Grant himself. We've never been properly introduced. I'm Dr. Arliss Loveless formerly of the Confederate Army. Yes, Dr. Loveless. It's a fine-Iooking spider you have there. What can I do for you? I have a humble abode nearby. I hope you'll accept my hospitality. I have a proposition to make. What proposition is that? The immediate and unconditional surrender of the United States to the Loveless Alliance! I didn't realize we were at war. You have me at somewhat of a disadvantage. I didn't bring my fly swatter. How about now? In matters pertaining to war, the person to talk to would be me. And now just who are you? I am the President of the United States. This man is an actor hired to stand in for me on public occasions. Not a very good actor at that. He's too fat and dull-witted. You got a lot of brass, Gordon. Where's West? You know him, sir. Take this man away! Captain! Lieutenant! Sergeant! Private! You are dismissed, sir! Leave! We'll take them both! Was this part of your plan, Gordon? Well, I'm by your side, sir. That's what counts. I got a telegram for a Dr. Loveless from his mother. She said, "Come home. Stop all this foolishness." Bonjour buenas tardes, and good day! Great, glorious day! A day of healing for the wrongs that have been done to us all. How long have we waited? 1776, wasn't it, old bean? The most expensive cup of tea in history. Manhattan, for a handful of beads. How. "Remember the Alamo," indeed. Thanks, Artie. Today, I'm proud to be able to sit before y'all and tell you that the wrongs will be righted the past made present the united, divided! Great Britain gets back the 13 original colonies, minus Manhattan. Florida and the Fountain of Youth go back to Spain. Texas, New Mexico, California, Arizona revolve a México. And a little piece for me to retire on. My partner nations insist that we make this as legal as possible. Personally, I like the symmetry of it. After all wasn't it you, President Grant, that made us sign a surrender at Appomattox? Never will I sign that paper. Never will the United States ever surrender! We're at loggerheads, then, aren't we? I suppose the threat of death to someone with your valorous war record would mean nothing. If you still refuse to sign the surrender we'll start by shooting your man, Gordon. Don't worry. I'm wearing an Impermeable. May I make one request? That she aim at my heart my heart, which has loved this country so much. Shoot him in the head. Damn! Ready! Aim! A new girl! Well, what a nice surprise. Ebonia, why are you so cruel to me? This brassiere is killing me. Thank you. And this garter belt is riding up my ass. -Be careful with that dress. -To hell with your damn dress. We'll have you out of here in a second, Mr. President. Bye-bye! -Is she with us? -Captain West. Oh, he's so graceful! IKill him! Him! Him! Him! The girl! Is that the eight ball? Get down. -That wasn't sleeping gas. -The eight ball's an incendiary bomb. The President! Let's go! Save the President! We'll be fine! They're getting away. We gotta do something! We gotta get horses! Right now we need a plan. That flying machine idea of yours. Were you acting like you knew what you were talking about, or can you build it? Bernoulli was considered insane by his peers. His theory states that the air over a bird's wing moves at a lower pressure than that below the wing. That's called lift. And is what we will now attempt. It's only a theory. It's never been tested. Here's a little bon voyage present for you guys. Gunpowder, nitroglycerine and .44 caliber primers. How the devil do you know about explosives? U.S. Marshal Coleman. President wanted me to look after you. But I draw the line at defying gravity, so good luck. Hold on! Avanti! Avanti! Avanti! -Why isn't this avanti -ing? -Not enough lift! We need more speed! -That's a cliff! -Yes, I know! -That means the ground is gonna end! -I know! It works! It works! If you had to get one right, I'm sure glad it was this one. What kind of fancy name you got picked out for this thing? Wait, let me guess: an Elevation Enhancer or a Gravity-Repeller Vehicle. No, I was thinking of something simple. Air Gordon. Mr. President, I'll ask you once again: Sign the surrender, or I will decimate this town! You've had my answer. I understand, but I urge you to reconsider in light of the following! Hang on, Mr. President! Let's go! Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by your effort and ingenuity. Why not swear an oath of Ioyalty to me and forego your execution? I thought I'd stuff your half-a-ass in one of these cannons and fertilize the landscape with you. We may not have a woodshed on board but that boy is gonna get a whupping anyway! You the one supposed to give me my whupping? Hell, I got one of those. Gordon only gave me one. If you give me a second, I'Il. Damn! That's it. No more Mr. IKnife Guy. I learned that from a Chinaman. I just made that up. Nice hat. No! Sorry. Miss Lippenreider, take over the controls. Now, somebody around here promised me a whupping. Dark-haired fella. Crazy beard. About your height. Seen him? When it comes right down to it, you just can't beat a good old-fashioned pair of legs. Well, you're obviously not a poker player, Mr. West. Four of a kind always beats a pair. Now was there someone particularly close to you who perished in that military action? Well, that struck a nerve. "I likes to beat my feet on the Mississippi mud!" Stop it! Stop him, please! Drop it! Drive. Stop or I'll shoot. You expect to kill me with that peashooter? If I have to, yes. Why is it that I am unafraid? Shoot him Gordon! Shoot him! After all that, you missed? Actually, I didn't. Thank you. Your chivalry's about to be tested. Wait! Well, well, well, Dr. Loveless. I bet you thought it was pretty damn funny, big metal foot on my face and all. If you ask me, somebody around here owes somebody else around here an apology. Quit dancing around and figure out how to run this damn thing! We got a real problem there! Please, Mr. West! Show some mercy! Now, don't you fret none. We got a lovely half a jail cell picked out for you. Please, sir! You fine, dark warrior! Finding the right combination of levers. Don't do that again. I have always admired you, Mr. West. I want you to understand that. For four years, I've chased the animal responsible for the massacre at New Liberty. I hear that's you. I am not an animal. I am a visionary! I am a genius! And now I am angry! After I kill you I swear I'm gonna boil you down for axle grease! Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle! How did we arrive in this dark situation? I have no idea. I'm just as stumped as you are. I'm facing a difficult problem here. On the one hand, I have an overwhelming love for myself and on the other, the raw, seething hatred that I have for you. I could kill you very easily just by pulling on this lever. But I would die along with you, hence my conflict. Decisions decisions. Allow me to make that decision for you. Mr. West, although you are as black as the night on the outside inside you are yellow! You just don't have it in you. Do you boy? Now that's a whupping. You'll be happy to know I'm creating a new agency whose sole purpose is to protect the President. Welcome to the Secret Service. Agents number one and number two. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you mind if I ask which one is agent number one and which is number two? I don't think that matters. Do you? Not if you don't. Anyway, you'll have plenty of time to discuss it on your new assignment. See you in Washington, gentlemen. Mr. President, what about our train? I'm taking it, of course. Hell, you let Loveless blow up mine. -My heroes. -Rita, look at you. You're a vision. That's a fine dress you got on. I wanted to thank you for all you've done for me, before I went back to Texas. Texas? What do you mean? Come to Washington with me. Or better yet, come back to Washington with me. I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you. Professor Escobar is not my father. He's my husband. You could've told us that. Rita, dear, we really must be going. At least you still have each other. Jim? What now, Artie? Do you mind if I ask you a question? Actually, I do, Artie. Shit. I should have gone on a swamp tour. <i>I know. I swear he's gotta have a meth lab.</i> I don't know what else to tell ya, Hamilton. Just get the neighbor to quiet down. Look, we've got every major drunk from Mardi Gras down here. There's no room. <i>He tried to give me a speeding ticket.</i> Just make it happen. <i>Yes, sir.</i> How are we doing, Winslow? Morning, Sheriff. Well, New Orleans PD sent us another handful to hold overnight and Hamilton is out at Sable Ranch. Again? All in all, not that bad a year. Honestly, not bad at all. <i>Oh, she's got a gun!</i> I killed him. Drop the gun, now! Get on the floor, now! Arms up. On the floor! Spread 'em! Wait, she has something in her hand. What is it? Oh, god! It's a fucking scalp. Who-Who'd you kill? They're all dead. Who's dead? Honey Island Swamp. I need an available boat unit out to Honey Island Swamp now. Hamilton, are you there? I killed him. I killed him. Any injuries? Nothing noticeable, sir. Are you trying to tell me that none of that blood is hers? How many bodies did you say there were? Twenty, thirty. And you're the only one who made it? Just a few scratches? No major injuries, huh? You see how this could look just a tiny bit suspicious, don't you? there is no answer at the Dunston house. Try again. I have. Five times. Well then get in your car and drive over there, Deputy Elbert. Yes, sir. I'm on it. Nobody's home. Crowley killed them all. Enough about Victor Crowley. We know who Victor Crowley is. And we also know what reality is. So, let me see if I got this straight. You suspected Victor Crowley of killing your father and your&? - Brother. - Brother, right. So you jumped in a swamp tour boat, an illegal swamp tour boat, and headed back out into the swamp armed with nothing but a handgun. A ghost wiped out everyone in front of you. You found out that your family was dead and you barely escape with your life. But then the next night, you go back out into that same swamp, chase that same damn ghost and you bring more people with you? Now why would you do something like that? That has to be the stupidest story and some of the most idiotic and contrived decision making I've ever heard. I am telling you the truth. I don't think you realize the kind of deep shit you're in, little girl! You come into a goddamn police station covered in someone else's blood, head to toe, you're carrying a weapon and a piece of somebody's fucking head! And the best you got for me for an alibi is some kind of urban legend? Hey! I am talking to you. Let me tell you something. You go up in front of the judge you better come up with a better excuse than what's-- <i>- Sheriff, come in. - Yeah, I'm here.</i> <i>Sir, it's, uh&</i> What is it, Hamilton? Spit it out! <i>It's a fucking massacre out here, sir.</i> <i>I mean, we've only covered about 40 yards</i> and we already come up with four bodies. I mean, I mean& Jesus, they don't even have faces, Louis. Look, we're gonna have to call in every goddamn paramedic in the state and a full recovery team right away. <i>We're talking about DNA</i> <i>and dental records level shit out here, man.</i> <i>Shit, they're going to have only teeth though.</i> Uh, we got a girl in custody. Uh, I'm on my way. <i>Uh, we're gonna call in state, Sheriff.</i> <i>we're dealing with down here.</i> <i>Shit, we keep finding pieces everywhere.</i> I said, I am on my way, Deputy. Sir, do you want me to go? Get the fire and paramedics out there right away. I'm on it. This is Deputy Winslow. I need all available. These dead bodies ain't finding themselves. Come on now. Double time. an official comment till there's been a full investigation I'll probably gonna be out there all day--what? Sheriff, I think you have a, uh-- Shit. Hi, Louis. - Okay, seriously-- - I need this. I need this, Louis. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, come on. Multiple bodies, Honey Island Swamp, girl in custody. That is police business, okay? Oh, this has Victor Crowley written all over it. Are you out of your mind? Please let me on that scene. Let me cover this story. Get in line. I've been a punch line on the media blacklist for my Crowley study. This is an opportunity for me. Crowley study? Is that what you're calling it right now? I thought it was more like, uh, obsessive sensationalism. Now, you just listen here. I want it. I would like to have the access. Please, let me break this story. Please, Louis. all we know is there's a possible murder outside of Jefferson Parish. No further comment. I heard massacre. I heard unidentified bodies in pieces. - Jesus H Christ Amandai, - Faces missing? that is a police frequency. Stay off of it. I have First Amendment rights, Louis. Come on. Let me work on this story. Give me a chance here. It's me. So, how's Arwin? No worms or fleas or since she's been living with me. Well, maybe a vulture picked them off. Sheriff, sheriff, sheriff. Come on, guys, I can't. Not today, please. Come on. Give us any information at all, please. Blood suckers. Sheriff, come on. Something. Hey, Elliot. How you doing? Not today, Mrs. Fowler. Well actually it's Miss Perlman now. Well, you'll always be Mrs. Fowler to me. And it's deputy now. That's nice. How's Adrianne? We broke up.2005. Oh. So, where's the suspect? That's none of your concern. Really? 'Cause I'm about to post her bail. All right, people, we're gonna have to split up the recovery search a few more miles. Hyde keeps finding pieces. Which way? They keep popping up everywhere. Right. Where the hell are the paramedics? Always the last one on the scene, you know that. Speak of the devils, huh? You Hamilton? Yeah, that's me. Jim Duffy. You in charge? but, uh, Sheriff Fowler from Jefferson Parish He's a little tied up with the press. Fucking maggots? You're telling me. So what are we talking about here? Three bodies, six? Shit, try 20 or 30. What the fuck happened? Well, it's all under investigation but, uh, we do have a girl in custody. A girl? You guys think a girl did this? Shit yeah. We got good reason too. You guys don't tell us how to do our job; we won't tell you how you suck at yours. let's start gathering the bodies over here. Bob, Randy, bag and tag. Andrew, come with me. What happened? Some people died and made a mess. Barney Fife back there, he says they got a girl in custody. - A girl? - Yeah. We're not gonna be out here all night, are we? How the fuck do I know, Andrew. What? Are you scared or something? You know where we are, right? Be a man. Have a Twinkie. What girl did that? Humph. You're awake. I'm Amanda Perlman. I-I tried to post your bail but you have to go before a judge for that and there's no bail set, so. I'm sort of the local expert on the Victor Crowley legend. Had a big splashy article not long ago, local legends and lore& The Bayou Butcher. Yeah, I saw you on "Montel". Oh, you saw that. Yeah, well, you know, not my best career move. Been trawling county websites ever since but you know-- I just--I had a belief and I have a passion and it's kinda made me a national journalism joke. And one minute you're on national TV, What the fuck do you want from me? Well, I don't wanna waste your time. I can see you're busy. I just wanted to, you know, interview you about what happened, find out what you saw. Listen, I can help you. that the ghost of Victor Crowley actually exists, that would help me a lot. So you want me to help you, right? - Right? - Yeah, that's right. I mean, right now you're looking at a lifetime in jail. I might be the best chance and the best friend you've got. No offense, but fuck you. I wanna fucking lawyer, not blogger. I gave you your two minutes. Now, you just listen to me. We're gonna run through this again, Marybeth Dunston, daughter of Samson Dunston, washed up local drunk, who if he's even got enough education to sign off on your death penalty acceptance would have to be poured out of a local bar to do it. And let's not forget your brother Ainsley. How many dozen DUI he got? Oh, and those three months community service for defacing a church? Look, I know you didn't do this but you're gonna go down for it 'cause you're po' white trash. You know what they do with po' white trash who are convicted on a capital charge? The state of Louisiana will execute you. So you go ahead and you sit in here. You can bark at me like a big dog in a cage, you can either help me prove Victor Crowley exists or you can wait for the lethal injection that's gonna end your miserable life. Do it. your pappy ain't been here to see you. Must be happy hour somewhere. Maybe he'll show up after he's panhandled enough pocket change for a Pabst. My father is dead. Victor Crowley killed him. Please, tell me what happened. I know I can help you. Fine. I'll wait. Son-of-a-bitch, where the hell are the other guys? Oh, shit. Where the fuck did this rain come from? Randy. - One, two, three. - Holy shit. What'd you guys bring me a giant? Yeah, it's, uh, hard to tell. This poor bastard was lying on top of the biggest chainsaw I've ever seen in my life. and his body is in a lot of different pieces. Jesus. I thought you might wanna take a look at this one The guy looks like he had all kinds of muscular and skin deformities& and he was only wearing overalls. Get the fuck out. I know, right? Anyway, looks like this one in particular might be, I don't know, crucial component in all of this. Wait a minute. You don't think, uh& I'm not saying shit, all right? All I'm saying is that you might wanna drop whatever you're doing and check this one over first. Awesome. Gonna be fucking creepy but awesome. Let's go. Come on, big man, we got a date. Oh, oh. Okay, here we go. One, two, three. Dude, I'm telling you this may be-- I have seen some crazy shit, man. I was working on an Asian male, head severed off, uh, leg cut off below the knee. I'm telling you, man. Look kind of like you, man. Oh, what, because I'm Asian? No, dude, because you were-- Oh, yeah, I-I get it. We all look the same, right? Ha-ha-ha. It's hilarious. Asshole. Oh, fuck that. He was shredded to pieces. There was nothing left to possibly get back up again. I mean, taking his head off wasn't enough, dismembering him was. I got away. Now what time was this? This morning. I don't know. Reverend Zombie thought that by letting Crowley kill the three people that were responsible for his death somehow the curse will be lifted and I don't know he would just go away. It was all bullshit. when I interviewed a voodoo priestess, and she was a real voodoo priestess-- Oh, she was real voodoo priestess, of course. I know it sounds crazy but if anything should be a believer, I would imagine that would be you. According to legend, Victor Crowley is cursed as a repeater. Each night he has to return exactly as he was when he died. He has to relive the night of his death in an endless cycle over and over again. You can't kill him. He's already dead. It's kinda sad really. I sawed his body into little pieces. I'm pretty sure he's dead. keep him from returning again and again in his original form. He's dead. He's not. Any sign of the sheriff yet? Nothing yet. All right, well, he should be here soon, all right? I'm on channel six when you see him. Hey. Any more bodies? Oh, man. It's hard to tell. It looks like we got a whole area down there by the cabin, the whole crime scene over there a whole mess of bodies even more in the east. My call, I think the victims were in two separate groups. Hell, they probably didn't even see each other down there. Coming each way in different directions. Oh, man, how the hell do you deal with that smell? It takes a couple of years but you do get used it. Another day on the job for me. You know, close the door, man. I'll be on six. Randy? Freeze! Don't move! Shit! What? Hamilton? <i>Get off of me, right now, dammit!</i> <i>Somebody help!</i> Holy shit! Holy shit. Help. Help! Hamilton! <i>Hamilton, do-do you read?</i> Sheriff? Lou, are you there? <i>I heard it. I'm making a call to the state.</i> <i>Bring everyone and everything I can bring with me.</i> <i>We should be out there in less than 30.</i> You still think he's dead? I killed him! You didn't but I know how. How? His father endlessly night after night. he can finally find peace and pass on-- Thomas Crowley has been dead for years. but first I need to know that you're gonna help me out. I already told you everything that I know. You are the only living relative of Samson Dunston, the man who caused all of this. You are the only one who can end it. That means you are the only one who can make it stop. You heard what I heard on the radio! How many more people have to die before this is over? I can't. You can. We're going for a ride. Oh, hell, no. <i>we have a report of a man down at</i> <i>Honey Island Swamp.</i> <i>No response from fire, paramedics on site.</i> <i>I need all available units to Honey Island.</i> <i>All available units to the swamp.</i> Elliot, you have to help me because if you don't, everybody in that swamp is gonna die. You open that door. <i>Look out, look out!</i> Open it! Oh! <i>All right, cover-cover me!</i> Now! All right, here's what we know now. A group of Jefferson Parish PD, paramedic and fire respond to a report of a multiple homicide There are 12 people all of whom are now MIA. We have one suspect in custody and our last contact was about 45-45 minutes ago but we did receive distress calls of an unknown attacker and multiple men down. So, who's left? We're not exactly sure. Do we know if the attacker is still in the area? Well, we have to assume so, yeah. But, uh, guys, I want you all armed and at the ready. We got no idea what we're dealing with here so let's be prepared for anything, okay? Is the attacker armed? Definitely, but we just don't know with what. I'll take it from here, Sheriff. Officer Hawes, Louisiana State SWAT. Uh, nice to meet you, sir, but actually these are my men and, uh--sir& All right, everybody, listen up. You will give one verbal warning and then you will shoot to kill. Do I make myself clear? - Yes, sir. - Good. Let's stay together and move out. Son of a bitch! What have you got in there nuclear warhead? but I brought about every other toy I could get my hands on. You don't fuck around. Mikaela Dougherty. Cory Schneiderman. It's a pleasure. You're planning on taking out a T-Rex tonight? You do know where we are, right? Smelly swamp? This is his swamp. Victor Crowley. I'm sorry. I'm new here. I just transferred from Arizona. Who's Victor Crowley? there's this little boy who was born deformed and he-- Come on, let's go, dipshit. That guy's such a fucking asshole! I'll tell you about it later. The NRA would be proud. I'm a member. Can you please take these cuffs off of me? Absolutely not. I shouldn't be doing this. I'll lose my job on this. locked up in the back of this fucking car? Will you please shut up? How far is Ozona? Ozona? It's up there, uh, 11 freeway on the other side of Nicholson. What-what? What's in Ozona? Ozona is nowhere near Honey Island Swamp. We need to get to Ozona is what we need to do. And for the last time, it's Miss Perlman, Elliot, okay? Just, you know, call me Amanda. Do that. Amanda. I thought you were Sheriff Fowler's wife. I need to call Sheriff and let him know what we're doing. No, you absolutely do not. Not yet. Do you understand how much trouble my ass is gonna be in? I'll tell you what, get me to Ozona and then you can call Louis and tell him we're on our way. Deal? What is in Ozona? Thomas Crowley. Thomas Crowley? Thomas Crow-- if he were alive, wouldn't he be like, 300 fucking years old by now? He's dead. So what are we gonna do dig him up? Not exactly. Tell me about the suspect. Well, she turned herself in this morning. She was covered in someone else's blood holding a shotgun. Did she give a confession? She kept carrying on about some local legend named Victor Crowley. Hmm. Yeah, I'm familiar. when your men made a distress call, correct? But my guess is it's one of these Crowley impersonators, who's heard the ghost story one time too many. But she's clearly part of it though. Yeah, well, I'll be the judge of that. I suppose if anybody's a Crowley expert that would be you, right? I mean your wife is Amanda Fowler, correct? Ah, ex. She's my ex-wife. I've got a few of those myself. Yeah, it's complicated. I thought she and I, we just clicked so good, you know. But then I don't know-- I was just making small talk, Sheriff. I really don't wanna hear about your divorce. No offense. So, uh, when did you transfer? About a month ago. So far so good, though, Mardi Gras has been a trip. Fucking Mardi Gras. It's the worst time of the year for all of us. Everyone flocks to Bourbon Street thinking it's gonna be like one of those Bayou beaver DVDs and instead they get two for 60-year-old women flashing their sagging pancake-- Just a bird. You're really freaked out, huh? Yes, I'm really freaked out. There's a reason this swamp is condemned and closed off to the public. Enough people disappear, enough bodies pile up and eventually you can't help but believe there's some truth to the ghost stories you hear around here. and I'm already a believer. I'll tell you that much. Hey, I get it. I believe in ghost too. I swear I saw one in my bedroom when I was six years old but it just smiled at me and walked out. It wasn't scary, kinda peaceful and comforting. This isn't Casper the Friendly Ghost. 'Cause Casper doesn't tear you in half with his bare hands. Fucking Christ. Do you still believe in friendly ghost? What the hell did this? What's that? God, we're fucked. We're fucked. Someone shut Schneiderman the hell up. It's a good thing you got that girl in custody, huh, Sheriff? I'm trying to reach the person we're going to see. See if he's home. Who are we going to see? His name is Abbott McMullen. Um, I did a bunch of interviews with him a couple of years back. My original Crowley piece. Okay. What are you doing? Why are you stopping, Elliot? Ol' man McMullen? Abbott McCrazy. Yeah, your point is? We are in some serious shit here, Amanda. We have friends in that swamp that are seriously injured, if not dead. And I just took our prime suspect out of jail against the law. And against my better judgment. And now you have me out here on some wild goose chase chasing I don't know what with a more morbid version of Wednesday Addams who could possibly be a psycho killer. Yeah, I'm sitting right here. No offense. None taken. Asshole. Hey, I'm still an officer of the law so watch your mouth before I add a few more charges to your list. Oh, can me telling you to go fist your own ass be another one of them charges? Okay, see, that's it. Okay. No, no, no. Abbott McMullen is the only living relative of Thomas Crowley. Thomas Crowley is his great uncle. He has Thomas Crowley on his mantle in an urn. The only way to give the ghost of Victor Crowley peace is to finally give him what he wants. If that's true, then why didn't you just bring him Thomas Crowley's ashes years ago? Only the person responsible for his death can finally deliver what it is he's looking for. I tried to have this conversation and he pulled a gun on me and told me to go fuck myself. Classy family. Go fuck yourself. Look, I know how insane this sounds, but until somebody has a better idea, this is the only option we got. So I suggest we stop the fighting, and we try to put an end to this once and for all. Louis is out in that swamp, your best friend, my husband. You mean your ex-husband, right? Just drive. Please. I hate to break it to you again, lady, but my father is dead. He sure is, but you're not. No way one person did all of this. Can you stop dancing around what's really going on here? Shut up, Schneiderman. With all due respect, whether you wanna believe it or not, this is Victor Crowley written all fucking over. Control your deputy, Sergeant. Schneiderman, stand down. Are you kidding me? These are somebody's balls. Balls are not supposed to be hanging from trees yet I'm finding myself looking at fucking balls, sir. That guy knows what's up. We need to get the fuck out of here and call the national fucking guard or some shit - before we all end up& - Shut your fucking mouth. This whole thing could be some sort of a joke. A sick, perverse practical fucking joke. That doesn't look like a joke to me. My deputy is right. I'm calling in the military and we're leaving. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire. Who the hell are you? I'm Andrew. I'm what's left of the first response team, sir. Look, we got to get the fuck outta here right now. Thank God, you guys showed up. Why don't you tell me what happened then? W-What happened? Fucking Victor Crowley happened that's what. Look around! Then why are you still here? I hid underneath someone else's body I found over there. All right? He massacred everyone in minutes! And you didn't fight back? No, I didn't fight back! And that's the only reason those aren't my balls hanging from that tree! Okay, please! Please, we need to leave right this second. This is Sheriff Fowler, Jefferson Parish. I'm trying to reach Colonel Mesco, Louisiana National Guard. <i>Repeat that, Sheriff Fowler?</i> We got a sit-- Cancel that request. <i>Copy that.</i> This is SWAT Team Leader Tyler Hawes. The situation's under control. Cancel that request. <i>What's your 20, Officer Hawes?</i> Do not answer that. All right, everyone, listen up. I will not, and I repeat, not be losing my job by calling the fuckin' military until I figure out what exactly is fuckin' going on here. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. I-Is this guy kidding? Fuck this shit! Your ego is putting all of us in danger. Fuckin' fire me. I don't care. I'm leaving. Officer Schneiderman, are you aware of the consequences for fleeing the scene of a murder? Yup, but at least I'll be alive. Don't do it, deputy. Calm down! What are you? Are you scared? Yes! Yes, I'm fuckin' scared! How the fuck are you not scared?! He's like a tank. No matter how many bullets he took, he just kept getting back up and coming. If we don't leave right this second, nobody's gonna be alive tomorrow. Where is he? I don't know! I've been playing dead a-and hiding until you guys showed up! Last I heard w-was screaming coming from & over there. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your-- Go check it out. We got him. Good job, fucktards. Oh, my god! Hide! Hide, hide, hide! Move. Move, move. Go! Guys, guys, guys, check this out. Who wants in on this? No. No, no. Hey, lights down. Stop. This is not a good place t-to hide. Um, I-I think he lives here so-- Bushes over here. Hey, you? You wanna hide in the bush? I'm so gonna fuckin' die. I'm so gonna fuckin' die. Shut your fuckin' mouth! Stop, guys! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Louis, Louis, Louis. Stop, stop! Stop the fire! Stop! Help me! Louis! Louis! No. No. Help. Help me! No. Move your head! Help me! Can you-- Oh no! Move back! Move back, move back, move back! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Fire! Help me! Help! What the-what the fuck! Get down! No! Let's do this, you little bitch. Oh! Whoa. Oh, fuck this! Schneiderman! Hey! - You're gonna kill him! - He's already dead! The guy was a real fuckin' dick anyways. Running around in your fuckin' overalls killing everybody I fuckin' know. Oh, my god, please! Please, God! Please stop! I'll give you your fuckin' daddy, you deformed douche. Sorry, Rick. Eat this, motherfucker! Woo! Yeah! Woo! Now that's how you take a bitch out! Run! Come on, back to the boat! Come on! Get up! Oh, dammit! Oh my god! Fuck you! Fuck you! This is it? I spent two days interviewing Abbott McMullen for my Crowley story. You never quite get the smell out of your sinuses. And you think he's just gonna hand over the ashes of Thomas Crowley to you? No, but he'll hand them over to you. Wait&what? Stay here. Where the fuck am I gonna go? Amanda, this is crazy! You can't do this! you can personally haul my little ass to jail. 'Cause this is the last chance we've got to bring this to an end. How? That girl is Samson Dunston's bloodline. Hi, Mr. McMullen. Remember me? Who are you? I'm Amanda Fowler. From the paper? Yes, sir. I ought to shoot you dead for waking me up at this crazy hour. It's the middle of the night for Chrissakes! It's 8:45. Well, that's what I said! Who is the colored? Who's the-- Deputy Winslow, Jefferson Parish. And you do know that the whole Civil Rights thing did take place, just FYI. I didn't do nothing to that little girl. There ain't no crime in looking. I'm sure you didn't. Not a nice tolerant man such as yourself. This here is harassment. I'll have your job. After tonight, yeah, you just might have my job. Mr. McMullen, we just wanted to visit with you about a matter of extreme urgency. What? Was there a fire? She's fine, she's fine. Um, we just wanted to have a minute of your time, just a minute. Well, all I got's a minute. Got a lot of irons in the fire, you know? Oh, yes, I know. I know that. Thank you. Thank you very much. And don't you try to steal nothing. I got eyes in the front of my head. Why don't you just offer me some fried chicken and watermelon while you're at it? I ain't got no food. It was a joke. You mumble. I can't understand you people. You--forget it. What? Forget it! Faggot?! I ain't no faggot. Well, come on in. If you're here to talk about Victor Crowley again, I told you everything I had to say yesterday. Well, actually, Abbot, that was 10 years ago. What? Speak up! I-I'm not here to talk about Victor Crowley. Well, then what the hell do you want? We are here on official police business. You've got a piece of evidence that is part of our investigation. We wanted to borrow it and then bring it right back to ya. And where is your warrant? You're not under arrest. It's okay. You're not in any kind of trouble, Mr. McMullen. We just want to borrow an item from you and return it to you briefly. You know you mumble too much. I can't even understand you. Oh, you know, um, when last we spoke you told me that these are Thomas Crowley's ashes. Isn't that right? No. Them's my uncle's ashes. That's right. These are your uncle's ashes. What the hell you doing, you little harlot? I am just gonna borrow these for a little bit. We're gonna bring him right back. Oh, oh, over my dead body! Mr. Mullin, I'm afraid I must insist. I'll bring your uncle's ashes back to you personally. What the hell do you want with my uncle's ashes anyway? I'm taking these as evidence. This is part of a police investigation. - Show him my badge? - Show your badge. It's official police business, sir. That's right. Who did you rob this from? Who did I-- You know, that's it. I'm through. I'm done. Abbott, I promise we'll be bringing him back. We'll be bringing him right back. I said over my dead body. Well, then you leave me no choice. Go ahead, shoot me. Go on, do it! Shoot a defenseless old man. Go on, pull the trigger. Abbott, I'm sorry but we are leaving now with this urn. Open the door! Do it, shoot me! Go on, do it. Yeah, I knew you's a coward. You come barging into my house with some negro thief claiming to be a cop. Fuck you! Fuck you! I am a veteran. I went all the way to Korea. Fuckin' white people! That's right, run, boy! Pow! Yeah, I gotcha. Let's get the hell outta here! Is it-is it still following us? Come on. Okay, he knocked the wind out of me. What are you doing? No stopping! Stopping, stopping is very bad! Who the hell was that? Well, he was a paramedic. Doesn't he work with you? Yeah, but I-I don't know his name. Hey? We gotta get back to the boat. You're going the wrong way. See? Fuck that guy! Well, I-- You gotta be fuckin' kidding me. You're Samson's bloodline. You have to be the one to give the ghost what it wants. The fuck I do. You can't bring me back there! We don't have a choice. The one who caused the ghost death is the only one who can make it right. I had nothing to do with this. But your father did. this is the only way to make it right. Why are you just coming up with this plan tonight? I told you I approached your father years ago. It didn't exactly go over well. And until you waltzed into the police station wearing Victor Crowley's innards, what proof did I have that he was real? - No! - Stop! - You're gonna get us killed! - No! Stop it, Marybeth! - Stop! - You can't take me back! Turn the fuckin' car around. You can't-- You have to go, Marybeth! - No! - Only you! Only you! You're the one! Oh, gee. Oh. Oh, God. Come on, man, let's go! What's wrong with this one? I don't have the keys. What? Why? I work with a bunch of redneck racist. They won't let me drive anything. Christ almighty, let's go! Fuck it. Back in the ambulance. Move it! Shit! This is Sheriff Fowler of Jefferson Parish. - This is Sheriff Fowler& - Fuck! This is Sheriff Louis Fowler-- Goddamn it's dead! Does that work? - Yeah. - Thank God. This is Sheriff Fowler, Jefferson Parish PD. S-O-S, I repeat, S-O-S. We are under attack in Honey Island Swamp. <i>This is the National Guard's frequency, Sheriff Fowler.</i> <i>Did you say you are under attack?</i> We need help immediately, okay? Listen, you gotta send military assistance or something as soon as possible, okay? We're-we're pinned down here. We got SWAT team officers dead, we've got fuckin' half of Louisiana police department is dead. <i>Who's attacking you, sheriff?</i> Victor Crowley. <i>Repeat that?</i> Crazed gunmen. and-and they're firing everything they've got. We need military assistance. You gotta send some kind of chopper or something, airlift us the fuck out of here! <i>Understood, sheriff.</i> <i>We are dispatching air support immediately.</i> <i>What are your coordinates?</i> I ain't got no fuckin' coordinates, you moron! I'm in Honey Island fuckin' Swamp! There's a six major league fuckin' police boats that will be parked alongside the shore. That's where we'll be, okay? Pinned down in an ambulance taking heavy fire! <i>We are on our way. Hold tight.</i> Finally. Fuckin' finally somethin' goes right. Wait. Be quiet. What? He's gone. Nobody move. Maybe he gave up. Even if he did, nobody steps outside this fuckin' boat. Nobody touches anything without my say so. Do you understand me? Sounds good. We're staying put till the National Guard gets here. Randy. That guy's name was Randy. I knew his name. What is that? Shut up and listen. Oh! Where the fuck he get a grinder? Oh, shit! It's a gas belt sander. It was in the evidence pile outside the boat with those other weapons. Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, I put it there. My bad. Oh, shit! We really need to call the sheriff and let him know& Elliot, Elliot, no. he will order you to take me and Marybeth back. - Yeah, probably. - And then what? - I'll say I pulled your gun. - Yeah, right. I'll do whatever it takes, Elliot, because I am not wrong. I am not. I'm sorry. Oh, don't do it, Elliot. Please don't do this. Sheriff, you there? Lou, come back. Louis? This is Deputy Winslow. Heather, you there? <i>Where the hell have you been all night?</i> <i>Shit is going down out on Honey Island.</i> Yeah, I'm aware. I'm boarding the boat now. <i>Do you have that Dunston girl with you?</i> <i>Please, tell me that isn't true.</i> Look, I can explain everything. Just--when's the last time you talked to the sheriff? <i>It's been almost two hours</i> <i>since we've heard from anyone out there.</i> <i>But the National Guard received a distress call</i> <i>from a paramedic boat and they're on their way in.</i> <i>What the hell is happening out there?</i> Look, who-who placed the distress call? <i>Why did you take the suspect out of her cell?</i> Who sent out the distress call? <i>They said it was the sheriff.</i> <i>He said there's a group of gunmen</i> <i>attacking them or something.</i> <i>We can't get a response from anyone here.</i> Don't you see Louis is alive? Yeah, two hours ago! He called in the military. He said it was a group of gunmen. Don't you get it? He did that so that he would be sure that they would come. What's he gonna say? Victor Crowley's attacking us? You gotta think about this. We have got to get out there and we gotta get out there now! And then what? And then we make sure she puts that monster back in his grave where he belongs. Oh, shit! Should we run for it? Where? Back to the woods? No, to his boat. While this fucker is distracted sawing through this wall, let's open the door and run for the other boat. Even if you get a head start, there's no way the three of us will make it. It's like he's everywhere at once. What are you doing? I don't know. I don't know. We have to find something to fight back with. The RPG didn't take him. Do you think a couple of needles will? Well, we have to do something. We're running out of time here. What's the ETA on that chopper? <i>Chopper's coming in from Baton Rouge.</i> <i>ETA 10 minutes.</i> We ain't got 10! Dammit! He must have chewed through the wiring! Hey, I see the other boats. Let's-let's pull around. We don't have time. We're close enough. You heard her, let's go. Let's go. Now, listen, you gotta trust me. Look, I promise I won't let anything happen to you. You know that promise? It's fading fast. Come on, get it together. Get your hands off me! This will be over soon. Yeah, it will be. Stop it! Stop it! Get it off! Get it off! Sheriff? Louis? Lou! Now what? - Sheriff? - Louis, answer me! - They're all dead. - He's not dead! - He is so dead! - No, he isn't. He called for help. He's not dead. - Here! - No! Take it. Take it! Get out of my face, bitch! Take it! Sheriff! Victor? Victor, come out. Come and get your daddy. <i>Victor Crowley,</i> <i>Victor Crowley, we've got your daddy.</i> Why did he stop? <i>- Louis? - Shh!</i> I'm trying to listen. <i>Sheriff Fowler?</i> I think it's them. Oh, thank God. <i>Luis, where the hell are you?</i> Amanda? Who's Amanda? Oh god, it's my wife. Okay. Amanda? Victor! You come out here to me right now. I got something you've been needing a long time. <i>Sheriff Fowler!</i> Don't even. I still have ammo. <i>Fowler!</i> - Just stay-- - Put. <i>- Sheriff! - I can reach it.</i> Stay away from that hole. Shh! <i>Victor, where are you?</i> Shh. Okay. Don't. Don't do it. Don't do it. <i>I wanna see you!</i> Okay. Don't. Stop. <i>You come out now!</i> Stop. <i>I got your daddy here, Victor!</i> Come out! Come and get your daddy! This is bullshit. Amanda, we need to find the others. We found them. There you go. Look around. Victor, come on, where are you? He's-He's here. Freeze! Oh god. On the floor now! Don't let anything happen to her. - No. - Only you. We can't kill him unless you put it into his hand. Go! You hear me? You do it. You do it. Do it! Here. Don't shoot until he has it. Here he is. I'm s--I'm sorry for what they did to you and I'm-I'm sorry. And I'm sorry for what my father did to you. I'm sorry. Daddy. Take it. Take it. - Ah! - Step back, Marybeth. I said step back! Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He's dead. No, Elliot, no! Elliot, no! Give him the ashes! I knew you were real. I came to save you. Here's daddy, you motherfucker! Got to get up. Get up. Get up. Fuckin' do it already! Just one more time. Come on, do it. Come on, do it. Come on, do it. Come on, do it. Come on, fuckin' do it already! Come on, get up! Oh, goddammit, do it already. Fuckin' do it already! Fuck it! Hey! Hey! Over here! I'm here! I'm--get me the fuck outta here! Help! Help! Where are you? Come out! Come out! Come on out! I'm coming to get you! Where are you, you little rascal, I'm coming to get you! Hm. Where is my little birthday girl, hm? I'm going to gobble her up, when I find her! I'm going to eat you, om nom nom Oh, Fergus! No weapons on the table! Can I shoot an arrow, can I, can I, can I? Please, can I? Not with that! Why not use your very own! Happy birthday my wee darling! Now, there's a good girl. Draw all the way back now to your cheek, that's right! Keep both eyes open.and.loose! I missed. Go and fetch it then! A bow, Fergus? She's a lady! Oh! A will-o'-the-wisp! They are real! Merida! Come on, sweetheart! We're leaving now! I saw a wisp! I saw a wisp. A wisp? You know, some say, that will-o'-the wisps lead you to your fate. Oh, aye, or an arrow! Come on, let's be off before we see a dancing tattybogle or a giant having a jigger in the bluebells. Your father doesn't believe in magic. Well, he should, 'cause it's true! Mor'du! Elinor, run! Come on, you! BRAVE Some say, our destiny is tied to the land. As much a part of us as we are of it. Others say, fate is vowen together like a cloth. So that one's destiny intertwines with many others. It's the one thing we search for, or fight to change. Some never find it. But there are some, who are led. The story of how my father lost his leg to the demon bear Mor'du became legend. I became a sister, to three new brothers! The princes: Hamish, Hubert and Harris. Wee devils, more like. They'd get away with murder! I can never get away with anything! I'm the princess! I'm the example! I've got duties, responsibilities, expectations. My whole life is planned out! Preparing for the day I'd become, well, my mother. She is in charge of every single day of my life. Hey Robin, jolly Robin, and thou shalt know of mine. Project! And thou shalt know of mine! Enunciate, you must be understood from anywhere in the room! Or it's all for naught. This is all for naught. I heard that! From the top! A princess must be knowledgeable about her kingdom. She does nae doodle! That's a C, dear. A princess does not chortle! Does nae stuff her gob! Rises early! Is compassionate. Patient. Cautious! Clean. And, above all, a princess strives for, well, perfection! But every once in a while there's a day when I don't have to be a princess. No lessons, no expectations, a day when anything can happen! Day, I can change my fate! I'm starving! You're hungry too, I guess? Oats it is then. And then, out of nowhere, the biggest bear you've ever seen! His hide littered with the weapons of fallen warriors, his face scarred, with one dead eye. I drew my sword and. Woosh! With one swipe his sword shattered and then chomp! Dad's leg was clean off! Down the monster's throat it went. Oh, that's my favourite part! Mor'du has never been seen since! And is roaming the wilds waiting his chance of revenge! Arrrgh! Let him return. I'll finish what I'd guddled in the first place. Merida, a princess does not place her weapons on the table Mom! It's just my bow! A princess should not have weapons in my opinion. Leave her be! Princess or not, learning to fight is essential. Mom, you'll never guess what I did today. Mhm? I climbed the Queen's Tooth and drank from the Fire Falls! Fire Falls? They say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire. What did you do, dear? Nothing, mom. Hungry, aren't we? Mom! You'll get dreadful gollywobbles! Oh Fergus! Will you look at your daughter's plate? So what? Don't let them lick. Boys, you're naughty! Don't just play with your haggis. Oh, now, how'd you know you don't like it if you won't try it? It's just a wee sheep stomach! It's delicious! Mmm. Mylady. Thank you Maudie. Aha. From the lords Macintosh, MacGuffin and Dingwall. Their responses, no doubt. Stay out of my food, you greedy mongrels! Chew on that, you manky dogs! Fergus? They've all accepted! Who's accepted what, mother? Boys, you are excused. What did I do now? Your father has something to discuss with you. Fergus? Merida. The lords are presenting their sons as suitors for your betrothal! What? The clans have accepted! Dad! What? I.you..she..Elinor? Honestly, Merida. I don't know why are you reacting this way. This year, each clan will present a suitor to compete in the games for your hand. I suppose a princess just does what she's told! A princess does not raise her voice! Merida, this is what you've been preparing for your whole life! No, it's what you've been preparing me for my whole life! I won't go through with it! You can't make me! Merida! Merida! Boys! Mother! Suitors! Marriage! Once, there was an ancient kingdom. Oh, mom! Ancient kingdom. Its name long forgotten. Ruled by a wise and fair king who was much beloved. And when he grew old, he divided the kingdom among his four sons, that they should be the pillars on which the peace of the land rested. But, the oldest prince wanted to rule the land for himself. He followed his own path and the kingdom fell to war and chaos and ruin. That's a nice story! It's not just a story, Merida. Legends are lessons, they ring with truths. Ah, mom! I would advise you to make your peace with this. The clans are coming to present their suitors. It's not fair! Oh, Merida, it's marriage. It's not the end of the world. You're muttering. I don't mutter. Aye, you do, you mutter, lass. When something's troubling you. I blame you. The stubborness. It's entirely from your side of the family. I take it it all didn't go too well? I don't know what to do. Speak to her, dear! I do speak to her! She just doesn't listen! Come on, now. Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me. What would you say? Oh, I can't do this! Sure you can! There, there! That's my Queen. Right, here we go. I don't want to get married! I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset. Merida. All this work, all the time spent preparing you, schooling you, giving you everything we never had.I ask you, what do you expect us to do? Call off the gathering! Would that kill them? You're the Queen, you can just tell the lords, the princess is not ready for this. In fact, she might not ever be ready for this so that's that. Good day to you. We'll expect your declarations of war in the morning. I understand this must all seem unfair, even I had reservations when I faced betrothal. We can't just run away from who we are! I don't want my life to be over. I want my freedom! But are you willing to pay the price your freedom will cost? I'm not doing any of this to hurt you. If you could just try to see what I do, I do out of love. But it's my life, it's. I'm just not ready. I think you'd see, if you could just. I think I could make you understand if you would just listen! .listen! I swear, Angus, this isn't going to happen! Not if I have any say in it. MacGuffin! Dingwall! Macintosh! You look absolutely beautiful! I can't breathe! Oh, shush. Give us a turn. I can't move. It's too tight! It's perfect! Merida. Mom? Just remeber to smile. Oy, they're coming! Places everyone! Places! I look fine, woman. Leave me be! ??? Oy! So, here we are. The four clans. Gathering. For the presentations of the suitors. Clan Macintosh. Your Majesty, I present my heir and sire who defended our land from the Northern invaders and with his own sword stabbed bloody, vanquished a thousand foes! Clan MacGuffin. Good Majesty. I present my eldest son. Who scuttled Viking longships and with his bare hands vanquished two thousand foes. Clan Dingwall. I present my only son who was besieged by ten thousand Romans, and he took out a whole armada singlehandedly. With one arm, he was. With one arm, he was steering the ship and with the other, he held his mighty sword and struck down a whole attacking fleet. Lies! What? I heard that! Come on, say it to my face! Or are you scared simpering jackanapes, 'fraid to muss your pretty hair? At least we have hair! And all our teeth! (thick accent) If he was a wee bit closer, I could lob a caber at him, ye ken. And we don't hide under bridges, you grumpy old troll! You want a laugh, eh? Wee Dingwall! At him, at him! That's the way to. All right. Shut it! Now, that's all done. You've had your go at each other, show a little decorum! And no more fighting! I didn't start it was he. Mylady Queen, I feel terrible, my humblest apologies. Sorry..We meant no disrespect. Sorry, love, I didn't, but.Yes, dear. Now, where were we. Ah, yes. In accordance with our laws, by the rights of our heritage only the firstborn of each of the great leaders may be presented as champion. Firstborn? And thus compete for the hand of the princess of DunBroch. To win the fair maiden, they must prove their worth by feats of strength or arms in the games. It is customary that the challenge be determined by the princess herself. Archery, archery! I choose.archery. Let the games begin! Pull! I have told you, you're not allowed. It's time! Archers, to your marks! Aye, archers to your marks! And may the lucky arrow find its target. Oy, get on with it! I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers. Or holding up bridges. Noooo! At least you hit the target, son! Oh, that's attractive. I've got it! Good arm. And such lovely flowing locks! Fergus! What? Oh, wee lamb! Oh, come on, shoot, boy! Well done! Feast your eyes! That's my boy! Well, that's just grand now, isn't it? Guess who's coming to dinner. Fergus! By the way, hope you don't mind being called lade Ding. I am Merida, firstborn descendant of clan DunBroch. And I'll be shooting for my own hand! What are you doing? Merida! Curse this dress! Merida! Stop this! Don't you dare loose another arrow! Merida! I forbid it! I've just about had enough of you, lass! You're the one that wants me to. You've embarrassed them. You've embarrassed me. I followed the rules! You don't know what you've done! I don't care. There'll be fire and swords if it's not set right. Just listen! I am the Queen! You listen to me! Oh, this is so unfair! Unfair? You're never there for me. This whole marriage is what you want! Do you ever bother to ask what I want? No! You walk around telling me what to do, what not to do, trying to make me feel like you. Well, I'm not going to be like you! Oh, you're acting like a child. And you're a beast! That's what you are! Merida! I'll never be like you! No, stop that! I'd rather die than be like you! Merida, you are a princess, I expect you to act like one! Merida! Merida! Oh, dear! Oh, no. What've I done. Angus! Come on, Angus! Angus! Why would the wisps lead me here? Oh, look around. You holler if you see anything you like. Everything is half off. Who are you? Just a humble woodcarver. I don't understand. See anything you like? Perhaps a touch of whimsy to brighten any dank chamber. But, the will-o'-the-wisps! They lead. Oh, this is one of a kind! I'll make you a deal for this rare prize. Your broom! It was sweeping by itself! That's ridiculous. Wood cannae be imbued with magical properties. I should know, I'm a wi.whittler! Of wood. How about this conversation starter? It's made of yew wood. Half a stone. Oh, ah ah, that's daft. Staring is rude! The crow. crow's talking! That's not all I can do. La la la la. You're a witch! Woodcarver! That's why the wisps led me here! Woodcarver! You'll change my fate! WOODCARVER! You see, it's my mother. I'm not a witch! Too many unsatisfied customers. If you're not going to buy anything, get out! No, the wisps led me here! I don't care! Get out! Shoo! Get! Begone with you! I'll buy it all! What, what was that? Every carving. And how are you going to pay for that, sweetie? With this. Oh my, that's lovely, that is. That will set us up for months! Every carving and one spell. Are you sure you know what you're doing? I want a spell to change my mom. That'll change my fate. Done! Where are you going? There. What're you doing? You never conjure where you carve, very important. Last time I did this was for a prince. Easy on the eyes. He demanded I give him the strength of ten men. And he gave me this for a spell. A spell that would change his fate. And did he get what he was after? Ohoho, yes. I made off with an especially atractive mahogany cheeseboard. Now, what do I need? That'll do. And, now, let's see. What have we here? A cake? You don't want it? Yes, I want it! You're sure, if I give this to my mom, it will change my fate? Ohh, trust me. It'll do the trick, dearie. Expect delivery of your purchase within a fortnight. What was that thing about the spell? Did you say something.about.the.spell? Merida! Mom! Oh.eh.I.eh. Oh, I've been worried sick! You, you were? I didn't know where you've gone or when you'd come back! I didn't know what to think! Oh, look at your dress! Angus threw me. But I'm not hurt! Well, you're home now. So that's the end of it. Honestly? I've pacified the lords for now. Your father's out there "entertaining" them. Come taste my blade you manky bear for gobbling up my leg! I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you, hang your noggin on a peg! Of course, we both know a decision still has to be made. What's this? It's a peace offering. I made it. For you. Special. You made this for me? Interesting flavour. How do you feel? What is that? Different? Tart and gamey. Have you changed your mind at all about the marriage and all that? Oh, better. Now, why don't we go upstairs to the lords and put this whole kerfuffle to rest, hm? Mother? I'm woozy suddenly. Oh, my head's spinning like a top! Mom! Oh, suddenly I'm not so well. How do you feel about the marriage now? Merida! Just take me to my room. To the left, that's good, that's good. A wee bit to the left, that's good. It's good enough. Now clean out of there boys, I don't want you to spoil my shot. Mylady Queen! We've been waiting patiently. My lords, I am out of sorts at the moment but you shall have your answer. Presently. Now, if you'll excuse us. Elinor, look! It's Mor'du! Elinor! Are you all right, dear? Fine, I'm fine. Go back to avenging your leg! Aye, you heard her lads. I dream about the perfect way to make this devil die. Just take all the time you need getting yourself right, mom. And maybe in a bit you might have something new to say on the marriage? What was in that cake? Cake? Mom? So I'll just tell them the wedding's off then. Mom? Bear! Mom? You're.you're a bear! Why a bear? That's scaffy witch gave me a gammy spell! It's not my fault! I didn't ask her to change you into a bear. I just wanted her to change.you. Shh, did you hear that? Something's not right. There's no point in having a go at me. The witch is to blame. Goggly old hag! Eyes all over the place. God. It's unbelievable! How I'm going to fix this. Everybody, follow me! And you keep a sharp eye! Here we go. Another hunt through the castle. We haven't even had a dessert yet. (unintelligible Doric accent) I have no idea. Mom, you can't go out there! Mom! Wait! What're you doing? Dad! The Bear King? If he so much as sees you, you're dead! Another one of your entertainments. Where is the end. Oh, and just what exactly are we after, my liege? Best to humour him. He is, after all, the king. He is like a hound with that nose of his. Mom! Wait! We have to. Follow me! Stop! Stop! You're covered with fur! You're not naked! It's not like anyone's gonna see you! Now you've done it! Maudie! Just calm down, lass. What is it? Spit it out, Maudie! A BEAR! I knew it! Would you just listen to me! We can't go this way. You'll be seen! Quick! This way! Mom? Mom? A witch turned mom into a bear. It's not my fault. We've got to get out of the castle. I need your help. All right. You can have my desserts for two.three weeks! OK, fine. A year. Did you hear that? There he goes! There he goes! Come on, mom! Do you think we should lay a trap? Try shutting yours! There he is! I'm sure it went this way. It must've sprouted wings! It was carried away by a giant birdie. A dragon, perhaps. Bear in that castle. Doesn't make sense. It cannae open doors. It's got big giant paws. Let's just get inside. It's locked. Dingwall was the last up. I propped it open with a stick. What'd you see Maudie? Spit it out, Maudie! Oh, for goodness' sakes, Maudie, would you get a grip? Come on, mom. Quick. Shhh! They'll be fine, won't you boys? Mom, we've got to hurry! Now, I'll be back soon. Go on and help yourself to anything you want, as a reward. Right. Oh, where are these wisps? Come out, wisps! Come on out! Lead me to the witch's cottage! I'm here! Fine! Don't come out now that my mom's watching. I was standing right here! And the wisp appeared right there! Then a whole trail of them led me off into the forest. ??? Oh, mom! I know this place. The witch's cottage.is this way! Come on! Hurry! I can't believe it! I found it! No! She was here. No, really. She was just here. Oh, wait. No..no.no, no, no! Welcome to the Crafty Carver, home of bear-themed carvings and novelties. I am completely out of stock at this time. But if you'd like to inquire about portraits or wedding cake toppers pour vial one into the cauldron. If you'd like a menu in Gaelic, vial two. If you're that red-haired lass, vial three. To speak with a live homunculus. Princess! I'm off to the Wickerman festival in Stoneham and I won't be back till spring. There's one bit I forgot to tell you about the spell. By the second sunrise, your spell will be permanent. Unless you remember these words: "Fate be changed. Look inside, mend the bond torn by pride." Fate be changed, mend the bond. What does that mean? One more time! "Fate be changed. Look inside, mend the bond torn by pride." That's it. Ta ta! Oh, and thank you for shopping at the Crafty Carver! No! Where'd you go? Welcome to the Crafty Carver! What? Maybe there's a bit about spells, or vials I'm off to the Wickerman.clock..I said.Have a lovely day! We'll sort it out tomorrow. My brave wee lassie, I'm here. I'll always be right here. Ehm, good morning? So..what's all this supposed to be? What? Sorry, I don't speak bear. Find those by the creek, didn't you? They're Nightshade berries. They're poisonous. Where did you get this water? It has worms! Come on! Breakfast! Oh, wait. A princess should not have weapons, in your opinion. There you go. Go on! How do you know you don't like it if you won't try it? Where're you going? Mom! Come back! Mom, is that you? Mom? You changed. Like you were a. I mean, like you were a bear on the inside. A wisp! Mom! Stop it! Mom, no! Mom! Oh, jings crivvens help ma boab! Mom, I know you're scared. You're tired, you don't understand. But we've got to keep our heads. Just calm down. Listen. They'll show us the way. Mom! Look! Why did the wisps bring us here? Whoever they were, they've been gone for a long, long time. Fine, mom. Just fine. It's a..a throne room. You suppose this could've been the kingdom in that story you were telling me? The one with the princes? One two three four! The oldest. Split, like the tapestry! The spell! It's happened before. Strength of ten men. Fate be changed. Changed his fate. Oh, no. The prince became. Mor'du! Mom, we need to get back to the castle! If we don't hurry, you'll become like Mor'du! A bear, a real bear. Forever! Mend the bond torn by pride. The witch gave us the answer. The tapestry! Mom! Do you have a better idea? That'll do. No more talk, no more traditions, we settle this now! You're the king! You decide which one of our sons your daughter will marry. None of your sons are fit to marry my daughter! Then our alliance is over! This means war! Gonna murder each other! You've got to stop them before it's too late! I know, I know! But how do we get you through there and up to the tapestry with the lot of them boiling over like that? What're you doing, lass? It's all right, dad. I..ehm..I have. Well, you see.I. I have been in conference with the Queen. Is that so? Aye, it is. Well, where is she, then? She. How do we know that this isn't some trick? I'd never. This is highly irregular! What're you playing at? Where is the Queen? We'll not stand for any more of this chiggery pie! That's right. Let's see her. SHUT IT! Well, I.. Once, there was an ancient kingdom. What is this? That kingdom fell into war. And chaos, and ruin. Oh, we've all heard that tale. Lost kingdom. Aye, but it's true! I know now how one selfish act can turn the fate of a kingdom. Nah, it's just a legend. Legends are lessons. They ring with truths. Our kingdom is young. Our stories are not yet legends. But in them are bonds we struck. Our clans were once enemies. But when invaders threatened us from the sea, you joined together to defend our lands. You fought for each other. You risked everything for each other. Lord MacGuffin. My dad saved your life stopping an arrow as you ran to Dingwall's aid. Aye, and I'll never forget it. And lord Macintosh. You saved my dad when you charged in on heavy horse and held off the advance. And we all know how lord Dingwall broke the enemy line. With a mighty throw of a spear! I was aiming at you, you big topsy! The story of this kingdom is a powerful one. My dad rallied your forces and you made him your king. It was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship. And it lives to this day. But I've been selfish. I tore a great rift in our kingdom. There's no one to blame but me. And I know now that I need to mend my mistake and mend our bond. And so, there is the matter of my betrothal. I've decided to do what's right. And..and..and. Break.tradition. My mother.the Queen, feels.in her heart, that I..that we be free to.write our own story. Follow.our.hearts. And find love in our own time. That's beautiful. The Queen and I put the decision to you, my lords. Might our young people decide for themselves who they will love? Well, since you've obviously made up your minds about this I have one thing to say. This is a grand idea! Give us our own say in choosing our fate! What? Aye, why shouldn't we choose? But she's the princess! I didnae pick her out, it was your idea. And you? You feel the same way? (unintelligible Doric accent) Well, that settles it. Let these lads try and win her heart before they win her hand. If they can. I say that we, Dingwall, has a fighting chance. Fine then, seems that once we're agreed. It was my idea in the first place. Just like your mom. You devil. Everyone, to the cellar! Let's crack open the king's private reserve to celebrate! Psst. Bring the tiny glasses. The tapestry! Mend the bond. Mend the bond! Stitch it up! This'll change you back. We just need needle and thread. Mom? Mom? Not now! No, please, not now! Mom? We'll boil your head with dumpling bread, to make an ursine stew. Elinor, dear, you'll never guess who just solved our little suitor problem. Elinor! It can't be true! Elinor! Answer me, lass! Elinor! Merida! What the. Dad! No! It's not what you think! Merida, get back! No! No! Dad, don't hurt her! Merida, no! No! Mom! It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing. It's just a little scratch. Mom! My liege! Fergus! Bear! Dad! Oh, count your stars, lass. It almost had you. Are you hurt? It's your wife, Elinor! You're talking nonsense! It's the truth! There was a witch and she gave me a spell. It's not Mor'du! Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother. But I'll not risk loosing you too. No, dad! Just listen to me! Listen. You can't. It's your wife Elinor! Maudie. Keep this. And don't let her out! What about the bear? Just stay put! Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots. Mom! No. No. Mom. Maudie. Maudie! I need you! Now! Oh, no. Maudie. Get the key! Maudie! Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Needle and thread. There he goes! Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Ah, you beauty! One two. Steady, Hamish! There he goes! Back! Back! Get him! Get him! Angus! No! Hubert, Harris, help Hamish! Give me a hand over here! Get back, that's my mother! Are you out of your mind, lass? Mom, are you hurt? Merida! I'll not let you kill my mother! Boys! Boys? Mor'du! Kill it! Scoundrel! Come on! I'll take you with my bare hands! Mom! The second sunrise! Oh, no. I don't understand, I. Oh, mom! I'm sorry. This is all my fault! I did this to you! To us! You've always been there for me. You've never given up on me. I just want you back! I want you back, mommy! I love you. Mom, you're back! You changed! Oh, darling. We both have. Elinor! Elinor. Oh, dear! You're back, you're back here! Oh, mom! Ehm, dear? I'm naked. Naked as a wee babby. Don't just stare at me, do something! What the.avert your eyes, lads! Show some respect! Now that's what I call a wee naked babby! Merida, Elinor, hurry up, we're leaving! Mom! Hurry up! ??? Goodbye! All the best! Fair wind to your sales! How did this.oh! There are those who say fate is something beyond our command. That destiny is not our own. But I know better. Our fate lives within us. You only have to be brave enough to see it. subtitles by tenebrae Stay back! He should've said "heel". Slag it! -He's got a delicate touch, Dee Dee. -Delicate like a moose, Dee Dee. I hate ripping this heavy junk. Give me cash cards any day. Zip it, Bonk. Plan is get in and get out fast. It's a school night, boys and girls. I'm gonna have to call your folks. Bonk! Don't! Yeah, Bonk. Don't. Let's go! Dee Dee, open the door. On the double. Incoming! Bonk! You moron! Get back here! You got a death wish, Bats! And I thought I was just being a good citizen. Got you, sis! Flagpole. What did you say? Flagpole. Come on! That ain't coming out of my allowance. Still got it. How did it go with the Jokerz? I broke up the robbery, but it was weird. Third time this month that particulary gang was trying to gintercepted high-tech machinery. Jokerz don't use that stuff. They're probably fencing it. Corporate espionage is big business. I may as well sit tight until I can get another shot at them. Hey, lookie here. That's right, Tom. Today, Gotham billionaire Bruce Wayne stunned the financial world with his plan to resume active leadership of Wayne Enterprises. While shareholders have generally welcomed Wayne's return support from some key members of the Wayne board has been oddly lukewarm. Company operations manager, Jordan Pryce, offered this comment: I, of course, join the rest of our Wayne Enterprises family in welcoming back our most valuable senior resource, Bruce Wayne. I'm sure we'll all profit from his years of experience. Still, the day to day rigors of running a vast, multinational conglomerate would be stressful, even for a young man. I hope Mr. Wayne is up to the challenge. He's not bitter, much. Pryce was next in line for the top spot. My return torpedoed any dreams he had of succession. -You gonna keep him around? -If he'll stay on my terms. I've worked long and hard to regain control of my family's company. And I won't hand it over again. Pryce can either get with that program or start e-mailing his résumé. With all the long hours you'll planning on putting in at the office does this mean you'll have less time for.. Who sleeps anymore? You okay? You know the Jokerz are going in for splicing now. Crazy hyena-boy nearly took a bite out of me. No way I could explain that to Dana. You're not going out now? The night is young and so am I. I think a good night's rest might be more beneficial. Like you said, who sleeps anymore? Up and at them, Terry. You can doze on Bruce Wayne's time, not mine. Sorry, Dane. Great song, huh? Did you see the squid Blade's with? P.U.! Ter, my head's on fire. You look good. McGinnis! Sorry, babe. Guess the day was longer than I thought. Let's sit this one out. Coffee. And leave the pot. Batman showed up and we had to ditch. We were able to save this: the console's memory board. I know it's not much but-- It's not much? It's nothing. Losers. All of you. A disgrace to the name Joker. Why, in my day-- In your day?! Ever since you cone your way into this gang it's been "your day" this and "your day" that. Bonk. Your day is over, old man. Even if you are who you say you are. And personally, I think you're a fake. Ah, brave new world that has such putzes in it. He's got us running around ripping a lot of geek junk, but no cash! He won't tell us what his plan is, if he even has one. I want out! If you insist. Hey, man. Take it easy. I was just kidding. So was I. Oops. No, I wasn't. That's also how we did it in my day. You know, kids, a lot has changed while your old Uncle Joker's been away. New Gotham, new rules even a new Batman. But now I'm tanned, I'm rested and I'm ready to give this old town a wedgie again! I have to know you're with me. -Will you say it for me one time? -We're with you. -Little louder. -We're with you! Dee Dee? -We're with you! -Boys? -We're with you. -Bonk? Oh, right. Dead. Dee Dee, be lam and sweap out the trash. There's good girls. Your renewed faith puts a smile in my heart. What's if we forget tonight mishappened and start over. Great, boss. Ghoul, my boy, we're going to need another systems scanner. Who's got one they'd be willing to donate? Checking. What we're after is cutting-edge. These are the only other places we'd find one. Nope. No. What, there? Security's gonna be tight! Oh, yes. But think of the fun. Good evening, Mr. Wayne. Ms. Carr. You remember my assistant, Terry McGinnis? Of course. I'm glad you could join us, Terry. Everyone is here. Well, everyone except Mr. Pryce, unfortunately. That's no surprise. May I have your attention, please? It's my pleasure to welcome back the guiding light of this company: Bruce Wayne. Thank you, Joyce. It's a pleasure to see you all again. In the future, I hope to-- --spend time getting to know each member of our company learning about you individually. Security! Emergency on terrace level. Hey! Look out! -You gonna be okay? -Go to work. Well, if it isn't old Mr. Wayne. So debonair. So dapper. So decrepit. Hello, Gotham! Joker's back in town! It can't be. Oh, no, your old eyes do not deceive you, Brucie! After all, who'd know me better than you? Back off, gruesome. Ah, the new boy. Ears are too long and I miss the cape but not too shabby. Not too shabby at all. Woof! -How's it coming, boys? -We're home free. Then I'll see you there. Time to go, Dee Dee. Well? What's it gonna be, Batfake? I know what you're thinking. I messed up. I let the clown go to save those people. You did the right thing. So, the Joker, huh? Looks pretty spry for a guy who's gotta be, what? Mid-eighties? Any theories on that? Clone? Robot? Suspended animation due to floating around frozen in a block of ice? Shut up and drive. Yes, sir. This was the scene three hours ago, as a man claiming to be the legendary Joker disrupted a ceremony at the newly opened Wayne Enterprises building. Honey, what're you watching? Adding to the drama was the appearance of another legendary Gotham icon, the Batman who engaged his one-time foe in a stunning aerial battle. Honey? It's nothing, sweetheart. Nothing. Go away. Morning, commish. You understand English, McGinnis? Scram. Love to. But first, what can you tell me about clowns? In this town they're never funny. I noticed that. -Now, this Joker-- -Drop it, kid. -That's what the old man's been saying. -Listen to him. Hey look, I know this fruitcake was a big, bad guy from the cape and cowl days. He was more than that. What? A wacko who threatened people with whoopee cushions and squirting flowers? -Big deal. I'm shaking. -McGinnis! The Joker, the real Joker, was unlike anyone you've ever faced. For your sake, I hope you never do. If Bruce wants you to drop it, then drop it. -Commissioner, your 9 o'clock is here. -Send him in. You were leaving? Figure I was. -Thanks for seeing me, Barb. -That's what I'm here for. JOKER DECEASED VOICE ID --a countdown of victims that will end at midnight unless our dear Dark Knight stops me first! Hello, Gotham. Joker's back in town! VOICE MATCH IDENTICAL It's funny. I know about all of your other major enemies but you never mention him. -He was the biggest, wasn't he? -It wasn't a popularity contest. He was a psychopath. A monster. So how is it possible he could still be around after all this time? It's not possible. He died years ago. You're sure? I was there. You killed him, didn't you? He was gonna do something so terrible, you had no other choice. -Terry-- -That was it, wasn't it? I want you to give back the Batman suit. What? Why? There is no reason for you to continue. You've made your father's killers pay for his murder. .then put your own needs aside to help the city when it most needed a hero. You've honored the reputation of Batman many times over and for that I thank you. Then why? I had no right to force this life on you or anyone else. I was the one who broke in and swiped the suit, remember? Yes, there was my dad's murder, but we come from two different worlds, Mr. Wayne. I wasn't like you or the kids you took in. I was a pretty bad kid once. Ran with a rough crowd, broke a lot of laws and say nothing to my folks' hearts. The kind of punk you wouldn't have wasted a second punch on back in that day. Your point? I'm trying to make up for past sins. The state says my 3 months in juvie wiped me clean, but my soul tells me different. Every time I put on that suit is my chance to help people who are in trouble. I guess on a personal level it's a chance to look like a worthwhile human being again. In my eyes, no one else's. It's what I want, Bruce. Stupid kid. You don't know what you want. None of you ever did. Mom, come quick! Some weirdo broke into our house! -Matty? What are you yelling about? -There's a stranger's sitting at our table! -Ha, ha. -That's your brother. I've never seen him before in my life. It is rare that you're up before noon, Terry what with your job and all. I'm not working for Mr. Wayne anymore. Well, it will be nice to have you home for a change. Right, Matt? Sure. Great. Just when I was getting used to being an only child. Mom! Once in a while, we have to do it, Dane. Ditch the guys and go out by ourselves. It may be a change for you, Chelsea. I don't see enough of Terry to know the difference. Terry's sweet and all, but who says you can't make friends with someone new? Not a chance. Terry! I thought you'd be working as usual. The bad news is, for the time being, I'm not gonna have much money coming in. The good news is, you have me all to yourself. I can live with that. Cutting in. Hey! Dana? What is it, boy? Ace. Ace! Don't get up, Bruce. It's just an old friend come by to say hello. Hello Batman. Dana! It was her. Don't know why the boss wants a dreg like you outta the way, but. hey, as long as it's fun. Terry! Dana! -Let me go! -Sure, cutes. Slag him! -Dana? -Stay out of sight! There! What's he doing? You got me. Just finish him! Ah, you made a mess, dreg. Dana! She's got a bad bump and some cuts, but she's gonna be okay. -Why were those guys after you? -I don't know. Look I'm gonna talk to the cops. Stay with her, okay, Chels? -I'll come as soon as I can. -Sure. Leave a message. Hey, the Joker's little playmates were after me tonight. Me, not Batman. This whole thing stinks, Wayne, and you know why. I need some straight answers from-- Wait, it's night. Where does he go? Wayne? Wayne! Ace. Please, God, no. Floor under table. How is he? The anti-toxin's done all it can. It's up to him now. Thanks for coming. I didn't know who else to call. Who else is there? That reminds me. I'd better check on our other patient. What have I done? I killed the little rabbit. I don't deserve to live! How you doing, killer? Yeah, rough night for me too. Sad news from the financial world this morning. The return of Bruce Wayne to his family company has been delayed due to an accident. Wayne Enterprises' Jordan Pryce had this to say: We received a call from Mr. Wayne's houseboy this morning saying Mr. Wayne had taken a bad fall. Everyone at the Wayne Enterprises' family sends their prayers and good wishes to our senior member for his speedy recovery. I'll bet. Not every creep in Gotham wears a purple suit. It'd make my job simpler if they did. The Joker knew about Bruce, about me, probably about you too. Someone knows, I'll give you that. But it's not the Joker. Not the real one. Bruce said he was dead. And? That's it. I know there's more. Barbara, I'm part of this. I need the answers Bruce can't give me. I deserve them. I thought talking about it would get easier over time but some hurts never go away. Dick Grayson, Nightwing, had left to establish himself in another city. There were three of us then: Bruce, myself and Robin, Tim Drake. Robin was alone when he came upon a woman in trouble. Help! Help! Somebody, please, help! Hero time. -That evens things up a little. -Not really, bird-boy! A bird in the hand. We soon realized Tim was missing. Night after night we scoured the city, running down every lead pressing every underworld connection. But no one had seen any sign of Robin. For three agonizing weeks there was nothing. Then one night, we were sent an invitation. Arkham. The asylum had been moved to a newer, high-security building. The old building had been partially demolished and hung open like a rotting wound. Hush, little baby, don't say a word Mama's gonna buy you a mocking bird And if that mocking bird don't sing Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring And if that diamond ring turns brass Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass And if that looking glass gets broke Pudding, company! Hello there! Welcome to our happy home. Where's Robin? Robin? There's no Robin here. Maybe he means our little J. Of course! That's it! No peeking. Mommy's little helper. You know, Bats, we've been doing this little runaround of ours for years. It's been loads of laughs, but the sad fact is none of us are getting any younger. That old clock's a-ticking. Quite right, pooh. And Harley and I were thinking it was time to start a family. Add a Joker Junior to our merry brood. But rather than go through all the joy of childbirth we decided to adopt. We couldn't do it legally but then we remembered you always had a few spare kids hanging around. So we borrowed one. No. My God! He needed a little molding of course. What kid doesn't? But in time we came to love him as our own. Say hello, J.J. Robin! Robin! Tim, it's Barbara. Can you hear me? Robin! Stop! Hands off, Brat-girl! Sweetie, get Mommy's bazooka. How could you help Joker do it, Harley? Okay, so he roughed the kid up a little, but I'll make it right. Yeah, you're mother of the stinking year. Ha! You'll see. We'll be one big, happy family. Good boy! What's the matter, Batman? No witty comeback? No threat? Then I'll provide the narration. OUR FAMILY MEMORIES I'll begin with how I peeled back the layers of the boy's mind. Though, he bravely tried to fight it at first. You would have been proud to see him so strong! But all too soon the serums and the shocks took their toll. .the dear lad began to share such secrets with me. Secrets that are mine alone to know Bruce. It's true, Batsy. I know everything. And like the kid who peeks at his Christmas presents I must admit, it's sadly anticlimactic. Behind all the Sturm and batarangs you're just a little boy in a playsuit, crying for Mommy and Daddy. It'd be funny, if it weren't so pathetic. Oh, what the heck! I'll laugh anyway. If you don't like the movie, I've got slides. I'll break you in two. Oh, Batman. If you had the guts for that kind of fun, you'd have done it years ago. I, on the other hand. You've lost, Batman. Robin is mine. The last sound you hear will be our laughter. Here you go, sonny-boy. Make daddy proud. Deliver the punch line. Tim. Do it! That's not funny. That's not. It's okay, Tim. It's okay. We buried the Joker deep beneath Arkham. The only other person who knew what happened that night was my father, the first commissioner Gordon. He promissed to keep our secret. With his last act of cruelty the Joker had tainted us all with compromise and deception. I suppose he had the last laugh after all. I'm assuming his girlfriend bought it too. We never found her body, but I doubt she'd be starting trouble now. And Tim? We had a trusted friend, Dr. Leslie Thompkins. It took her a year, but she was able to help Tim back to sanity. Still, things were never really the same. Bruce forbade Tim to be Robin again. He blamed himself for what happened and swore he'd never endanger another young partner. Tim left us soon after that, determined to make it on his own. Did they patch it up? Tim tried once or twice, but you know Bruce. I check up on Tim now and then. He's a top-level communications engineer, married, couple kids. Not too bad, all things concerned. He deserved a happy ending. But he still has the most likely connection to that night. It looks okay on this side. I'm going up to the dish. You might as well show yourself. I heard you a mile away. I'm no Boy Wonder anymore, but that old training never goes away. Even at my age. Tim Drake. You heard about Bruce? Barbara told me. That was too bad. You're not too broken up. I had nothing to do with it, despite what you might be thinking. When the Joker reappeared, I was just as surprised as anyone. Barb told you the gory details? More or less. Look, it's been almost 40 years. It wasn't easy, but I managed to put it to bed and go on with my life. You'll have to do it yourself one day. We all did. We gave our best, but in the end that wasn't good enough for the old man. Regrets, Mr. Drake? When I was younger, part of me thought I would go on and on and someday.. Capes, costumes, playing hero. It was kids' stuff. Bruce probably did me a favor. In the end I was so sick of it, I never wanted to see that stupid Robin suit again. Some things never change. Were all of you bitter when you left? Comes with the territory, McGinnis. Look up Nightwing, someday. He has he got stories! Drake's clean. I've got one more lead to check out. Someone with a definite grudge against Bruce Wayne. Caviar, soft music and charming company. Amy, my dear, I can't think of any better way to celebrate my ascension to CEO of Wayne Enterprises. -Me neither. -Me neither. You? Where's Amy? Missed the boat, I'm afraid. Turn the yacht around! Detox, boss man. We're here to talk business. We'll be quick. Woof gets seasick easy. Our business is concluded. You've got the equipment you wanted. I gave you the security codes so you could ransack the lab while those bunglers tried to kill Wayne. Word is Wayne's terminal anyhow. That means you get to stay top dog. And everyone's happy. So why are you here? The big guy who originally put us in contact just decided you're a loose end. And loose ends should be tied up. Let me go! Got him. Then amscray pronto, kiddies. Things are going to start popping. Let's go! No one's leaving until I get answers. No, you idiot! Not now! They're getting away! Yeah, and I think they've got a good reason! -What's happening? -Hang on! We saw the explosion. You can ask Mr. Pryce about that. Me? I had nothing to do with it. That right? I gave you the security codes so you could ransack the lab while those bunglers tried to kill Wayne. I want my lawyer. I think the commissioner would like to hear this too. Night. I'm spent. Every lead I had has gone face-down, and the Joker's still out there. What have you got? I don't know, pup. If I was the Batman I was supposed to be, I'd have cracked this would have punched the right data into the computer or remembered that one clue everyone else overlooked. It's rarely that simple. -How are you feeling? -Lousy. Gordon told me what happened to Tim Drake. That's why I didn't want you going up against the Joker impostor or not. Nothing against your old partners, but I'm a completely different Batman. I was never a Robin, I never-- Wait. Joker smashed up the cases but why was this the only costume he went out of his way to destroy? Robin did shoot him. A ghost out for revenge? I don't buy it. I talked to Drake. He's got less love for that costume than the Joker. I think somehow he's behind this. That's crazy. So was Drake, once. Look, here's the readout of everything we know the Jokerz have stolen. Now let's combine those into something that would be used by a communications expert. Someone of Tim Drake's caliber. Satellite jamming system. Whoever uses this can access satellite defense systems and fire them at will. Someone already has. I suspected Jordan Pryce might be the Joker but the Jokerz were on your company yacht trying to slag Pryce. I got him off before it was blasted to splinters. I think your little Robin's turned into a bitter old crow. He's gotta be the brains behind this new Joker. It's harsh, but who else is there? Suit up. Take the car and check it out. I'll monitor you from here. What happened to leaving it to the cops? Not their game. There's something else I want to take with me. Drake, I know you're the connection to the Joker. Don't pretend you didn't hear me. Hologram. You guessed it, Batfake! The disgruntled Mr. Drake is indeed in my employ. Took him a few years, but he figured out who ran the real winning team. This is one of Uncle Sam's orbiting defense satellites. Hyperion class, laser-armed. Handy litlle gadget for shooting down unfriendly missiles or giving someone a world-class hotfoot. Think of it as urban tagging on a grand scale reminding all and sundry that this is Joker territory. You're welcome to try and stop us but I'm not taking bets on that happening anytime soon. Toodles. Miss me? Computer, search for the name Jolly Jack. Abandoned candy factory. Just his style. Wayne, I think I've got something. Download this transmition and tell Gordon to have her men at that address. -I'm gonna-- -Aren't you the nasty tattletale? Ratting me out before I have my fun. Papa spank. Yeah, I know! I'd better sit down before I bust a gut! Catch you later, kiddo! It's stopped. I'm going after him. Gotcha! Ace. Good bat-dog. Where'd he go? Watch it! You watch it! It's him! Double down. Lovely playroom. You getting this, Wayne? I see it. You keep your eyes open for the Joker. Tim. Get up, Drake. What? Who is it? Where's the Joker? Joker? Drop the act. I know you're working with him. No, Joker's gone. I don't know where he is, really. Suit sensors aren't picking up any pulse fluctuations. It's the truth. I don't do this anymore. I have a home and family. I gave this up years ago. Kids' stuff. That's all it was. It may be the truth, but he's still whacked. Fun and games. Boy Wonder playing the hero. Fighting the bad guys and no one ever gets.. Oh, God. I killed him. I didn't mean to. I tried so hard to forget. But I still hear the shot, still see his dead smile. Every night the dreams get stronger. He's there when I sleep, whispering, laughing telling me I'm just as bad as he is, we're both the same. I'm calling an ambulance. No, I'm all right. Forgive me, Terry. Old, nasty memories twisting inside me like bad oysters. Nothing really. I'm perfectly fine now. How do you know my name? There's nothing about you I don't know, Batfake. Terry! Have a time-out, kid. Can't let you spoil the party too soon. And Bruce, I'm sure you've got your monkey-boy wired somehow. That's just peachy, because I want you to see every minute of this. It's a killer. My God. Oh, I never get tired of that! Drake? You're the Joker? That flabby oaf doesn't even realize I'm using him as a time-share. Beneath this puckish exterior lies the mind of a genius years ahead of my time. In the weeks young Robin was under my tutelage l used him as the subject of my greatest experiment. Utilizing cutting-edge genetics technology which I had pinched here and there l encoded my DNA on a microchip and set it into bird-boy's birdbrain. Here. Everything that was me has been a-sleeping all comfy and cozy inside Tim Drake's subconscious. At first, I had to limit the time I spent in Drake's body. He's not aware of what I do chalking up any lingering memories to bad dreams. If his family misses him, I simply call wifey and tell her: "l'm working late, honey." The changes come at will now and soon I'll be strong enough to live in this body permanently. Mr. J's on the rebound, baby! My comeback party's gonna set the whole town on fire! So where should I make ground zero? Gotham General, where our hero's dear little Dana is recuperating? Or here, in the happy garden of Mrs. Mary McGinnis? I always think it adds resonance to a hero's mission to have some defining element of tragedy in his background don't you? Ah, but the one and only kick off point must be stately Wayne Manor. Gone in a flash before Brucie can hobble to safety or mount a rescue. Don't worry, though. I'll be hitting those other spots soon enough. Adiós, Brucie. I guess I should salute you as a worthy adversary and all that but the truth is, I really did hate your guts. What about it, kid? Any last words for the old Batfart? Yeah. Sic him. Ace, here! Attaboy! End of the line, Snoopy. No! Oh, good. The beam's headed here. Now I'll have to start all over again. Thanks for wrecking everything, kid. See you around. Hold it. Oh, wise up, junior. Game's over! -I'm taking you in. -Right. You're out of your league, McGinnis. I know every trick the original Batman and Robin knew at their peak. Maybe, but you don't know a thing about me. You? What's to know? You're a punk. A rank amateur. A costumed errand boy taking orders from a senile old man. Still, if it's a whooping you're wanting.. That's right. Better to run and save yourself. That's about your speed. Let's dance, bozo. He's tough. Any suggestions, boss? Joker is vain and likes to talk and try to distract you, but don't listen. Block it out and power through. Wait. I like to talk too. -What are you doing? -Fighting dirty. The real Batman would never-- Told you, you didn't know me. Funny guy. Can't say the same for you. Impudent brat. Who do you think you're talking to? Not a comedian, I'll tell ya that. Shut your mouth! The real Batman never talked to you much, did he? That's why you were so fixated on him. Don't play psychoanalyst with me, boy! Oh, I don't need a degree to figure you out. The real reason you kept coming back was you never got a laugh out of the old man. I'm not hearing this. Get a clue, clownie. He's got no sense of humor. He wouldn't know a good joke if it bit him in the cape. -Not that you ever had a good joke. -Shut up. Shut up! I mean, joy buzzers, squirting flowers? Lame! Where's the A material? Make a face, drop your pants, something! Show yourself! You make me laugh, but only because I think you're kind of pathetic. Stop that! You fell in a tank of acid, got your skin bleached then decided to become a super villain. What? You couldn't get work as a rodeo clown? Don't you dare laugh at me! Why? I thought the Joker always wanted to make Batman laugh. You're not Batman! Come on, McGinnis! Laugh it up now, you miserable little punk! Laugh! I can't hear you! Easy, I've got you. Way ahead of you. Delia and Deidre Dennis, your grandmother's paid your bail. You're being released to her custody, pending your trial. -Oh. -Joy. You rotten little scamps! I struggle to make a good home for you and this is the thanks I get! Break a grandmother's heart! -I hope they throw the book at you! -Oh, shut up, Nana Harley. You didn't have to cover up for me, Barbara. The Joker's gone, Tim. You were just along for the ride. How are you doing, Mr. Drake? Tim, this is Terry McGinnis. -We met the other night. -We did? I owe you big time. Forget it. For what it's worth, Bruce couldn't have chosen anyone better to put on the mask. Coming from you, that means everything. Sometimes the important things go unsaid. If there's one thing I've learned you've got to appreciate the people in your life while you have the chance. Not everyone is capable of expressing that, Tim. No matter how much they might feel it in their heart. I know. What are you doing here? It's where I should be. Terry. I've been thinking about what you once told me. You were wrong. It's not Batman that makes you worthwhile. It's the other way around. Never tell yourself anything different. Thanks. Hello, Tim. Hi, old man. TOEI COMPANY LTD. NINJA BUGEICHO MOMOCHI SANDAYU (SHOGUN'S NINJA) Momochi's castle hasn't fallen. Lord Nobunaga is frustrated. Can't something be done, Shogen? Sandayu is good at battle. As expected of a ninja of Iga. Shut up! The reason I called you is about the head of the hated Sandayu Momochi. We must take him by force. I created these two. Kinu has no tongue to speak. Baruku has no ears to hear. I am at one with these who do not know. They are part of my body. I see. I'm depending on you. Lord. You can fight with something other than bows and guns. Please leave it up to me. HIDEYOSHI HASHIBA The courage of Koga ninja. This is a good chance to display the terror of Shogen Shiranui. SHOGEN SHIRANUI It's still too early to appear in the world. At the moment, I am an instigator in the shadows for the Lord. <i>March in the ninth year of Tensho.</i> <i>Nobunaga Oda ordered Hideyoshi Hashiba</i> <i>to march a far superior army to the population of lga.</i> <i>And proceeded to massacre the ninja of lga.</i> <i>MOMOCHI'S FORTRESS AT IGA lt was retribution for the many times</i> <i>that the ninja of lga inflicted harm upon</i> <i>Nobunaga over many battles.</i> Shogen, I am indebted to you. SANDAYU MOMOCHI If you help, we will have the strength of a hundred. Lord Sandayu, I can see the bitter face of Hideyoshi. Well, tell me the strategy. Shogen, you coward! You planned this. There is no cowardice in ninja. You didn't know I was working for Hideyoshi. That's why you will lose. Damn. Boss! Boss! Boss! Takamaru. The dagger is missing. What? The dagger has marks of the hidden gold mines that can control the world. It must be here. Find it! Okada Highness. Okada Highness! Momochi's fortress has fallen. The boss has died. Shogen Shiranui of Koga betrayed him. Shogen? Yes. Under the guise of being an ally, a cowardly trap. The Lord must have been considerably disappointed. This wolf is proof of the Momochi family. You must cherish it. Here. Old Man. Please take care of this child. - Please come with us, Okada Highness. - No. You must hurry. Mother! You must go! Takamaru. Sometimes life is harder than death. But you must survive no matter what. - Live well. - Excuse me. Wait! Young Highness! Mother! Young Highness. Hurry. One step too late. Yunosuke, you mustn't forget. The Momochi family, women and children, each and every last one of them. massacre them. Curse me if you wish. The lessons of a belligerent world. No right and wrong. Yatouji. Old Man. All of you, survived! - The young highness is also well. - What? Otsu, don't cry. Get away! Mommy! Mommy! All of you listen! Massacre them! MITSUHIDE AKECHI The enemy is at Honouji Temple! June, the tenth year of Tensho, Nobunaga Oda was overtaken by Mitsuhide's military. Shogen, who saw into Mitsuhide's military intentions secretly warned Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi was overjoyed. Without dirtying his own hands, the irritant Nobunaga disappeared in the flames of Honouji Temple. HONOUJI INCIDENT Lord Nobunaga's flag, during the battle for revenge, was captured and raised high by Hideyoshi's army. They crushed Mitsuhide's army. I won't go away. Damn. Go away. Mitsuhide's control ended in three days. Thus, this stage of history turned and brought forth the days of Bunroku.

This man, quietly planning to overthrow Hideyoshi, is Leyasu Tokugawa's trusted man. HANZOU HATTORI Monta. Kawajiro. Uekichi. Young One. It's so good to have you back. Old Man and I fell into the ocean back then, but we were saved by a Chinese ship off shore. They took us to the mainland. Is that so? And Old Man? He died. Seven years ago. Did Otsu make it? You mean crybaby Otsu? We all got separated back then. Dead or alive, we don't know. I see. By the way, Young One, leave the financing of the military resurgence of the Momochi family to us. While you live in a run-down temple like this? It's only temporary, just to keep a low profile. The talk about the thief Goemon Ishikawa is all around us. Goemon? Is that true? We're not petty thieves. It's to shake up the infinitely hated Toyotomi's regime. Sometimes, we spread money amongst the poor. So they call us chivalrous. Ishime gathers intelligence and handles explosives. I'm in charge of strategy. He's a goof but can open any lock. A goof I'm not. Leave it to me. Uekichi is faster than a monkey. I do odd jobs. But I can handle animals better than anyone. Put our skills together and we are the sharpest sword in the world, Goemon Ishikawa. In other words, a unified person. Unified person. Young One, take a look at this. This is just a small portion. I recognize that face. Ishime. Ishime, why are you just standing there? Takamaru, the one we've been waiting for has finally returned. What is this getup? A weakly Chinese Young One? Hey, you are quite rude. That's fine. If you don't like it, let's step outside! I'll straighten you out. Insolent bastard! Fine. I'll take you on. Come! I'll show you my jujitsu skills. I got it. Young One. Right on! Banzai! Great! I thought Ishime was strong, but Young One is awesome. Maybe stronger than me! - Go home. - You idiot. Where did you get this? This? Offerings to the Buddha. You stole again? Hey! Look! I've been waiting, Young One! Yatouji! I trained and trained them, the Spider clan. They are prepared to become great members of the Momochi family. This is Takamaru Momochi talking. Our target is the head of Shogen Shiranui. Our victory is over Hideyoshi's rule! Therefore, the ultimate goal of the Momochi family! FUSHIMI CASTLE Shogen. What do you mean the bandit Goemon Ishikawa has not been captured yet? My leadership has been challenged. Do you actually think discipline can be maintained? There is no excuse. Without fail, I will. Good. That's all right. This isn't your duty. Catching thieves is your brother's job. I will be sure to tell my brother, Genosuke. Shogen, look. Our forces have had some successive victories. We have momentum. Kuroda has been attacking like this. Shimazu is over here. Kiyomasa Kato is especially persistent up north. Soon, we'll even attack China. The Korean Peninsula will be mine. Congratulations. I don't have enough money. War devours money. Your pleasure. Shogen. Do you remember Momochi of Iga that I twisted and crushed? Of course. We are still hunting remnants of the Momochi family. We have not let up. If only we can get our hands on their hidden gold mines. I could easily enjoy the battles in the Peninsula a little more. Is that Sutemaru? SUTEMARU (THE FUTURE HIDEYORI) Here you are, here you are. How are you? You're a good child. A good child, a good child. You've shown up. Is that right? My dear! YODOGIMI Please stop it. It is filthy. Let's go, Sutemaru. Not even the Emperor's Chief Advisor can stand up to Yodogimi and Sutemaru. Insolent bastard! I am to be god of the heavens! Yatouji, I'm sorry. I wanted to bring a healthy Old Man back to Japan. Let's bury it amongst these unmarked graves. Our Momochi family, currently in Japan, do not have enough land to bury the bones. Young One. Now that you've returned, we must reinstate the Momochi family honor. I know. While I was on the continent, I never once forgot about my father's regret and my mother's grudge. Life overseas must have been difficult. Old Man and I drifted about many lands. Old Man died when I was fourteen. One day, when there was no food, I was caught stealing some steamed buns. She was Airen, the only daughter of Shaolin Master Chou Shinryu. SUZUKA MOUNTAIN Brother! Welcome home. Here's a gift for you. Open it. Thank you. It's beautiful. Brother, look. How do you like it? It fits me well. Really? You've become quite a lady. Oh, come on. Well, you must be hungry. I'll get it ready right away. Otsu. Have a seat. What is it, brother? I saw Takamaru of Momochi at Gojounohara in Kyoto. - He has grown to be quite strong. - Really? Brother. I no longer have connections with the Momochi family. I call you brother. I am a woman raised as a daughter of the Hattori family. I see. Then I have something to ask of you. Get close to Takamaru and steal his dagger. The dagger hides the secret location of the Momochi hidden gold mine. Young One. With that dagger, you shouldn't have trouble financing the war. This? What do you mean? In that dagger is the secret location of the Momochi hidden gold mine. Your father told me as the castle was falling. You must always keep it with you. There is only half there. Where is the other half? Otsu. Otsu! Takamaru. You're alive. This flute has brought us together. I haven't forgotten. Mother's memento. Crybaby Otsu. I hadn't cried since then. The flute is Mother. The sword is Father. Each is filled with the regrets of my deceased parents. Otsu.Ishime, Kawajiro, Uekichi, and Monta are all alive and well. Let's go see them. I'm sure they'll be happy to see us. Next time. Otsu, where are you living now? A kind person offered me assistance. In Osaka. That's good. Yatouji is also with us. Let's go. This should be it for today. You're sharpening your sword. Are you seeking vengeance? What's the matter? I received the reward. I told the authorities about Takamaru and your Goemon gang. What did you say? You needn't worry. I didn't tell them about you. What kind of woman are you? Stab me! Go ahead and stab me! I'm just a stupid woman that went crazy for the money. - Let go! - No! I'm not letting go! - Let go of me! - No! I won't! I can't betray my comrades. Wait. Are you willing to orphan your child? Touch. It's here. Here is the precious child between you and I. Don't go. Don't go! It's a chicken! Monta. Damn you. Bring the Spider down from the tree! Hold it there! Hold it there! Get away! Surrender! Ishime! - Coward! - Escape! Shogen. You're Shogen Shiranui. Son of Momochi. I'm amazed you're alive. I cannot kill you yet. Give me the dagger. Takamaru! Otsu! Get away! Takamaru! Where is the hidden gold mine? What is the secret within the dagger? Spill it! Damn. How'd they find us? - Was it Kousuke? - It was him. Shut up! The map to the hidden gold mines. There is only half the map. There must be another dagger to match this map. Who would have it? Otsu. Throw that flute away. Brother. You grew up with that flute. You played that flute and kept your love alive. But don't forget, Otsu. Love is also a tool. Love is also a tool. You are a daughter of the Hattori clan. Hey, you! Who are you? Son of Sandayu Momochi, Takamaru! Stop! Hold it! Stop! What? This is horrible. On the 23rd of this month, the thieves Goemon Ishikawa will receive the penalty of kettle boiling at Sanjougawara. The Kyoto City Administration. Monta! - Monta! - Come on, damn it! Help me! No! No! Help me! Hold on! I am the real Goemon Ishikawa! Everybody listen! I am the real Goemon Ishikawa! I'm Ishikawa! I am the source of all the thievery! My darling! - You fool! - Kousuke! My darling! Sister! Don't move! Sit down. I will inspect your faces. Raise your faces! Young One! Young One! Uekichi! Taka! We're going. Follow me. Yatouji! It's Yatouji! Young One, escape! Monta! Come on! Yatouji! Young One, take cover. Hurry! You idiot! You, especially, are not to die! You must live! Follow me! Ishime! - Yatouji! - Yatouji! That Hanzou. Let's get out of here. Get away! Uekichi! ISHIME GOSUKE UEKICHI IGA-MOMOCHI FORTRESS RUINS We're all that's left. We're lost. I'm lost. Hey. Somebody's there. You're acting like a girl, Takamaru. If you have time to cry, then you have time to kindle the fire! How do you know me? I know you. That dagger says it all. Who are you? Hakuunsai Ozawa. Master Hakuunsai. I will now hammer your dull edge back into shape. On guard! KISO Kawajiro! Kawajiro! Kawajiro! - Kawajiro! - Stay! Wait until he comes back up on his own strength. Master. Please let me go! You fool! The only thing you can believe in is your own strength. It is said that a lion will throw its own cub off a cliff. Only those that come up with their own strength will become a leader. Master. Excellent! Takamaru! If this walking stick was a fang, your hands and feet would have fallen on the ground. Takamaru. Hold your fangs in those arms. Hold your fangs and make them arms. Hold your arms and make them fangs. Kawajiro! Kawajiro! - Kawajiro! - Takamaru! - You're alive! - Monta! You have fully assimilated the Iga ninja way. But not enough to seek vengeance. What is it then, Master? Please teach us. Well, fine. This is something I received from your father, Sandayu Momochi. I will return it. I have heard rumors of the hidden gold mines of Momochi. A map is engraved in these two daggers. Put the two together and it becomes a map leading to the gold mine. Otsu. Why? Don't just sit there. Explain yourself! Make way. I'll cut you if you get in the way. Otsu. Otsu! Otsu. Why? Otsu! Why? Explain! Takamaru. Don't ask. Just cut me. I have broke the Momochi allegiance. Cut me! The Momochi allegiance is important. But one owes allegiance to those that raised them as parents. I was raised by Hanzou Hattori. Hanzou? He told you to steal it! I do not want to suffer being pulled apart by two allegiances. Please cut me! Leave. Leave, and tell Hanzou. if you want it, come get it yourself! Hanzou is behind this. How come you don't punish the one with allegiance to him? Cut her! Takamaru! Please cut me! Fine. I will do it. Out of the way! Otsu. Escape! Kid, you dare to get in my way? Get out of here! Stop! Go! Excellent! Takamaru. Do not forget that rhythm. You can handle two daggers as though they were two swords. Excellent. Master. Stay away! Takamaru. Can't you see that I'm counting on you? You cannot achieve revenge with kindness. You cannot defeat your enemy with compassion. You must wear armor made of anger and pain. You must simply be as an animal. And challenge a person to a fight. Like an animal. Above! Let the thunder of anger howl in the heavens. Let hate burn amongst the dead. Takamaru. From tonight, you are the second generation of Sandayu Momochi, Takamaru. Master. Farewell. Why couldn't you do it? Why couldn't you do it? Otsu! Have you forgotten the allegiance of the ninja. Otsu? Brother. Help Takamaru. You're sure there are now two daggers? Takamaru has no ambition for status or money. He only wants to avenge his family and bring down Shogen Shiranui. That is the only reason he came back to Japan. Please help him. I love him. I love Takamaru. Otsu. Is your life that precious? Precious? I don't want to die. Not even the Chief Advisor Minister to the Emperor can beat sickness. How fleeting life is. Don't be so weak. Leave. Shogen, come closer. It's all right. Put him here. As I enter the heavens, what is most on my mind is the fate of young Sutemaru. Shogen. What do you think of Leyasu? I can't read his ulterior motives. He is supposed to be at Kitanosho in the land of Echizen. It is the territory of his son Hideyasu. Lord. What do you want of me? From Leyasu in Kitanosho, I want to be granted victory. And what of Leyasu's response? I want it. Like this. If this opportunity is missed, Toyotomi will create evil in perpetuity. I'm depending on you. Yes. By the way, I also have conditions. Conditions? In the event of the successful ascendance of Sutemaru, I want the duty of his guardianship. You? Yes. According to rumors, if something happened to you, the guardianship over Sutemaru is to be Toshiie Maeda. Lord. This is a once-in-a-lifetime request of Shogen Shiranui. By all means, grant this duty to me. You? To threaten the Chief Advisor to the Emperor. That is me. Well. Fine. But Leyasu's response absolutely must be brought here. Shogen Shiraniu is leaving. Shogen. Shogen, like this. Master Sutemaru, I anticipate your lordship. Okay. Otsu. Shogen is making his move. There is no other chance to strike. Tell Takamaru. He's departing Fushimi Castle on the 17th of this month. This marks the route to Echizen Kitanosho. Take it. Brother. Airen. I have been waiting. Airen. Why didn't you return to your land? A woman has no land. A woman's land is where her lover lives. Taka, I will fight with you. All right? Shogen will depart Fushimi Castle on August 17. From Naka Path to Echizen Highway. Washikuradatake past Ohno into Kitanosho. Takamaru, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You can't trust Hanzou's word. It's true! I wonder. It's risky. Takamaru, believe in me. I believe. Taka, I believe this person. Take a chance on it. Understood, Otsu. From that day, I resolved to be like an animal. This fight is for all us animals. We hit him at Washikuradatake. We'll grab the upper hand in the winding roads. Two days after leaving Kyoto, they will be fatigued. And fortunately, Owl's Forest is nearby. THIRD YEAR OF KEICHO, AUGUST 18th A flying squirrel? Or remnants of Momochi? Just leave it and let's keep going. Our enemy is in Kitanosho. No. Wait. That is precisely why we cannot afford losses. We will change our course. Pull back. Shogen Shiranui! I've been waiting! Second generation of Sandayu Momochi, Takamaru! Surprise! Bowmen! Forward! Hey? What are you doing? Don't just sit there. Shoot. Shoot! Shoot! Hurry up! Hurry and shoot! Enough! Rifle squad, forward! Oh, my God! Damn him. Fire! Cease fire. Don't waste ammunition. These are their tactics. - Enosuke - Yes. There are six of them. Yes, sir. Make six groups of ten. We'll crush them in one stroke. Listen. Past this forest are sand dunes. Below are swamps. We shall keep them from going left of the road. If we push right, then they won't escape. Go! Over there! Search over there! Hurry. Go around there! Who's there? All right! It was a great success! Damn you. Takamaru. Split up. Who are you? Capture her! Escape! You can't reach me. Come here! Look at you! Prince! Prince! Prince. Don't die! Stop! After them! Go! There he is! Rifle squad. Fire. Takamaru! Come! Takamaru! Kawajiro. Hanzou. Brother! Shogen. Your pride and majesty has come to an end. What? Next is the reign of Archduke Shiranui. Shogen, you have become too eminent. You are so close to power that you cannot see what is apparent. How unfortunate. Can you reach it? Can you reach the power? Airen. Airen! Airen! Airen! Taka. Was I of any use to you? Airen. Taka. Now, in China. the pear blossoms must be beautiful. Taka. Take care of Otsu. Don't move. Airen. Airen! Shogen! On guard! I've got this. Go! You fell for it. At the same time, Hideyoshi Toyotomi departed from this world. He died at the age of sixty two. And the times brought forth a new protagonist of power, Leyasu Tokugawa. Give me those daggers. I refuse. Move, Otsu. This is my answer. I guess that's all right. THE END Do exactly as I say. Stand up slowly, walk ahead of me and open the door. Freeze! Everybody freeze! Nobody move! You, lock the doors. All of you, eat the floor! Now! Now! - Get your ass down here now. - Lock it. Right now, lock it. Eat the floor. Move! Let's go! - Come on, move it. Go. - Two minutes. 1:45. Stay down. One minute. 30 seconds. Now! - Time! - Move out. - Hey, Ace, over here. - Hey, Vinnie. I'd very much like you to meet Judy. She can suck a goIf ball through 20 feet of garden hose. - lmpressive. Can you excuse us? - Go over there! Go over there! Thank you, Judy. Where'd you find that bitch? - She's my girl. - The bitch ain't happy. - I need help. More credit cards. - How many? American Express blank credit cards. l need 2,000. - Get the fuck out of here! - If you can't handle it, I'll take my money to somebody who can. - OK. You got the money? - I got a bag of money. This big, this wide, full to the brim with money. - When do you need them? - Three hours. - Get out. Give me time. - I'm a businessman. - I got to make moves. - Three hours! If you can't help me, I'll go somewhere else. I got to move. - You got the money? - I got the money. You got the cards? Listen, you meet me at this address. Three hours. Don't have me standing around while you're messing with the titty woman. - Three hours. - Three hours. Foley, only real cops can come in here. - I thought you were dead, Granby. - I hate to bother you. One question. - I got to go. - I'll ask you later. You act like you never saw a suit! Detective Axel Foley, please. You've reached the home of George Kingfish Stephens. Sorry I'm not in but l've gone to the Lodge Hall. Leave a message and I'll get back at my earliest inconvenience. - Axel, it's Bogomil. - How you doing? l have to cancel on the fishing trip. l was going to teach you how to fish. lt's OK, I'm up to my ass on this credit card fake, and I'm close. How's Jan? If she didn't have a father with a gun, something would've happened! She's great, isn't she? I'm into something important here. I'll fill you in when I know more myself. I'm late, Axel. Look, you take care of yourself. Punch Rosewood in his eye and slap Taggart's bald head for me. Bye, Axel. I'll call you in a week. Marcy doesn't want to meet you. lnspector Todd wants to see you now. What do you mean she doesn't want to? - She doesn't like you. - She doesn't know me. - I described you to her. - Why?! I help you. l tell Todd you're working 24 hours a day. Look at that watch. Jeffrey, please, leave me alone! l got to work undercover with you. Why not? If Marcy won't give me her number, I'll give you mine, you pass it on. I'm very close to shooting you. As far as undercover goes, l want to be involved. You want to work undercover? When Todd asks where I am, tell him I'm pursuing my credit card bust. Now you're undercover. LA Times got a letter like that a few hours ago. He knows that, Billy. ls this guy serious? He's serious about the way he pulled the job. He knew exactly how long to stay inside and what to take. - Captain, I have this friend. - Why are you involved in this case? l assigned you and Taggart to the Peterson extortion case. Bogomil, get your men in here. Come on. You can't keep God waiting. l don't want to hear that kind of talk. He's fired every cop who worked for the old chief. - There's only us three left. - He's still head of this department. Yes, sir. Very smart, Billy. l have a relationship with this dude. Dude? Dude? We're not even supposed to be working on this case. Come on, Sarge. l know you have domestic troubles, but you got to cool out, relax. Things like this work out. Trust me. You moron. You called the Supervising Agent of the goddamn FBl to help break this Alphabet code? This is a local crime. My men will solve it locally, Roseweed. - Sir, my name's not Roseweed. - Shut up, please. And you, Captain Bogomil, this Alphabet investigation was your baby. Did you call the FBl? Did you order Rosewood to do that? Did you? - The Captain didn't know about it. - I said shut up! Captain Bogomil didn't call the FBl. I did. l said shut up. I'm waiting on you, Andrew. Did you order him to call the goddamn FBl or what? No, sir, but that's beside the point. No, that is exactly the point. Thank you. You're history, kiddo. You know very well that haIf of police work are cops following their hunches. They go with their gut reaction. l've encouraged this in my men and I'm standing behind Rosewood. Good! Tell me something, Andrew, how do you consider yourself a commanding officer? You can't maintain a supervisory relationship with your own personnel. And now you superseded the chain of command. - As of now, you are suspended. - What? - Shut up! - On what grounds? You have no control over your troop's activities. You can't do this! l can't do it? I will not have this investigation pissed away. This crime, this robbery, could be a political disaster for the mayor. What about due process? Policy requires we give you a board of review within two days. You got two days. - I am fighting you on this, Harold. - Chief Lutz to you. Where are you going? I'm not through with you two guys. Would you two like to hold onto your jobs a little while longer? You report to traffic duty, effective immediately. Yes, sir. - Hi. Trouble? - Yeah. - Maybe I can help. - lt just stopped. - ls it getting gas? - I don't know. - What do you make of this, Andrew? - Who the hell are you? Vinnie! ..country club prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, entered the third day of a hunger strike protesting the suspension of privileges. The Warden said the measures were taken to enforce discipline and to teach prisoners. l hate crooks that are late. Now the top story from the LA News desk. Police Captain Andrew Bogomil was gunned down in broad daylight. He is alive but in critical condition. He was leading the investigation into the Alphabet crimes. And now, Jim, back to you. Beverly Hills Police Department. This is Detective Axel Foley. l just heard what happened. Can somebody patch me to Bogomil's hospital? - Certainly, sir. - Thank you. - Who's this? - lt's Jan. l just found out. I'm sorry. What happened? They operated on him, Axel. He's going to be OK. l mean. l think he's going to be OK. Here's Billy. This guy really nailed him. He set him up. Cold blood. - Who? - This Alphabet Bandit. - Who's on the case? You? - lt's all politics here now, Axel. l don't think they'll let me and Taggart on it. - Hold on a minute. - Hey, Ace! Out in a minute! Take care of Jan, all right? Ace, I'm sorry I'm late, but I run into this broad. You're the fucking guy with the truckload of cigarettes! He told the cops he was from Buffalo. Take off your glasses. l thought that was you, man. l did get busted and I lost my whole investment! What's wrong with you? You know I'm a businessman. You come a haIf hour late and you bring a cop! What cop? He ain't no cop. lt's Dirty Harry himself. What's wrong with you? - You callin' me a cop? - He's my nephew. The dude is definitely bad luck to me! I'll tell you what's bad luck. My friend's in a prison body shop. - He's a fucking clown. - I'm checking you for a wire. If he ain't a cop, why can't I frisk him? - Stop this bullshit. - Why won't he let me frisk him? Cut the bullshit. I got 2,000 blank American Express cards. Right now. You wanna do business? With you, but not in front of him because this dude's a cop. l can smell a pig. I used to be a Muslim. I know pork. Yes, pork! Definitely pork. l ain't doing shit around this dude. - Fuck you, man. Allahu Akhbar. - You calling me a cop? Jeff. Where have you been? Todd's looking for you. I hope you made the bust. - Can I count on you, trust you? - Yes. We working undercover together? And you'll be quiet? - Who are you talking to? - Listen. Wait. - Drive the Ferrari for a few days. - The Ferrari? I'm leaving town for a few days and. - I need you to drive the Ferrari. - Where? Around. But you have to be me. - How do I do that? - Duck down. Drive like this. No one can know it's you. Don't have people hanging around the car. lt draws attention to yourself. One person. Drive Marcy in it! - We're supposed to meet. - What? For the car. She wants to be in the car. - She likes the car? - She loves it. Drive with Marcy, scootch down. Don't tell anybody about this. And I know you don't understand, but this'll make me cop of the month. We'll be there smiling together. l can trust you? You're my friend? You understand this? - No. - Good. - lnspector T, how you doing? - Where the fuck you been, Foley? - And what the fuck is this? - lt's a blue slip. Why the hell you need $1 ,000? - A little flash money. - Flash money? Let's see. $2,000 for a suit. $200 for a tie. A requisition order for a Ferrari. l've seen enough blue slips. How about some arrest slips? l know you're getting upset. You have reason to be, but I am close. l am so close now and it's making me crazy. l could smell it. lt's in the air. Do you smell it? I smell it. All I smell is bullshit. I'm pouring money down a bottomless hole. Where are the bad guys at the end of this? - I thought if there was a problem. - Don't think! lt makes my dick itch. Truth is, this department's furnished you a fortune. My ass is on the line. l OK'd all this shit. l must have been out of my fucking mind. But I can't pull out without a bust or I'm finished. l promise you, I won't go down alone. I'm gonna give you three days. If I don't see some results, I'll cover my own ass. How do you like that arrangement? If I only have three days, l have to go deep undercover. I'm deep now. This is deep. But I'm going deeper. No more money. I'm going deep, deep, deep undercover. Sign that, and I'm going so deep, you won't know. People will page me. Axel? No answer cos I'll be deep undercover. I'm tired of your bullshit, Foley. You got three days. If I don't see results, I'll grind your ass into dog meat. Deal. I'll have a dog-meat ass. Now please sign for my flash money. Flash money! Make sure nothing happens to that Ferrari. That's a $50,000 automobile. No, no. lt's $67,000. And fast. lt goes from 100 to 150 in. You better make sure nothing happens to it. Don't worry about a thing. lt's safe. No one else will be driving but me. l will sleep, eat, drink, shit. No, I ain't going to shit. You thought I was going to. l ain't gonna shit. Don't worry about it. I'm on the job. That's what I'm afraid of. He's OK. - What are you doing here? - How's he doing? If he's strong enough to live through that, he's got a chance. - I got to see those letters. - They're at the station. We can't take you there. We're not supposed to be on that case. lt's a new ball game and we're not invited. Neither am l, but I got to see those letters. - lt won't hurt to let him see them. - But we got to be careful. Lutz is just looking for a reason to bust our asses. Meet me back at the station in an hour. I'm going to say hi to Jan and take a peek. All right? - How you doing? - OK, Axel. Come on, stop that. l get shot like this all the time in Detroit. He'll be fine. He was talking about going fishing until yesterday. Then he seemed preoccupied. I'm gonna come by the house after I get settled and look around. Thanks, Axel. - Where are the owners of this house? - They haven't taken possession yet. - They're in Hawaii. - ls there a foreman? Thank you. Everybody, stop what you're doing, please. Stop it! Stop what you're doing! Beverly Hills building inspector. Everybody, stop what you're doing. I'd like to speak with your foreman. Put the bucket down! Somebody get me the foreman. - I'm the foreman here. - You? Where are the plans? You're making a very big fucking mistake. - Who are you? - I'm the building investigator. - Nobody told you I was coming? - No. Get me the goddamn plans. Can you guys stop working? Stop it! Stop working! Get me the plans. - Wait a second. This is wrong. - What do you mean? These are the old plans! Weren't you at the meeting? - No. - Before they went to Hawaii? - No. - No meeting? l was there to change these plans. The Andersons changed the plans. There's not supposed to be any right angles. - You! You! Stop working! - Stop working! You're destroying the house. Wait! No right angles? lt's like a doughnut. What are you, a fucking art critic? Let them live inside a doughnut. Some people want to live in a round house. Fuck it. Guys, stop it. I'll have to straighten this out. I'll talk to my people, they'll talk to your people and nobody gets fired. l did what they said. You were right, but whoever told you's an asshole. Everybody come down, go home. Relax. You got the week off. We'll straighten this thing out. Give your boys a round of applause. You've done a good job. The house is square, but it's beautiful. Go home and relax for the rest of the week. I'll straighten this out. lt's Miller time. Right, thank you. So you'll straighten all this out? Will you stop worrying and go home? Trust me. Could somebody clean this shit up before you leave? Lutz's guys are working on the codes. Lutz thinks he's a serial robber. l think he's a nut case. - Lutz is a nut case. - Not Lutz. The Alphabet Bandit. l don't think so. He's too smart. What else you got? These shell casings are from the first robbery at Adriano's. These are .44 auto mags. They don't make these any more - too expensive. This is a casing from a .308 rifle. They cut it down to fit a .44. - They knew what they were doing. - Shit. Put this stuff away. - Who's this? - Lutz. All right. Show time! What's going on? Who are you? - This is. - Shut up, Rosewood. My name is Johnny. Johnny Wishbone. I'm a psychic from the island of St Croix. I read in the St Croix Gazette that the Beverly Hills Police had some trouble solving crime. So I came to Beverly Hills. They say they don't want my help. I'm psychic! I'm a psychic phenomenon. Watch. I don't know you. Your name is, um.Lutz! Right? Chief Lutz, that's your name. The name pop inside my head. - And your name is. - Biddle. Two more seconds and I'd say it myself. l don't need no help. I'm Johnny Wishbone, psychic extraordinaire. If you need me, just think Johnny Wishbone and I come. Lutz and Biddle, it's like Kibbles and Bits! Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Your name is Johnson, right? What the hell is going on? ls this a magic show? I'll have your badges unless you go to traffic duty. Get out! l got angina the minute I saw Foley. Axel's got nine lives. I don't. You boys ready? You both know Lutz is a shit tinhorn politician. His boy Biddle couldn't catch the Alphabet killer if he nuked the city. We got to do this. All for one, one for all. Lutz is about to fire our asses. I'll lose my pension. l got a wife and two kids to feed. - You got two kids, not a wife. - Shut up. She might come back. Maureen's divorcing him again. She's with her mother. Two years ago, I almost lost my job. The man put his neck on the line for me. I'm not going back to Detroit without helping him. And his boys don't even have any loyalty for him! Don't give me this loyalty crap. Andy and I joined the force together. If we do this, it's got to be low-profile. Covert. Billy and I have traffic duty, for Christ's sake. Give me a break. - Where'd you get that? - You stole evidence! - I only took one. - Why? This is known as a clue. Few people know how to do this quality work. - We'll see who recognises it. - Who are these guys? This is your town. You should know that. There's a guy at the Beverly Hills Shooting Club. Russ Fielding. Supposed to be the best. Let's go see Russ Fielding then. - What's in the bag? - My vitamins. - Give them to me. - You want my vitamins? All of them? - An hour. - Enjoy good health. Excuse me. One second. What year is this? '73. - Yes. lt is '73. - I know. May I help you? I'm from Medalux Explosive Research Company. - Does Russell Fielding work here? - Yes. He ordered these plutonium-nitrate, multi-explosive, sound-seeking projectiles. Here they go. Have a nice day. Wait a minute. What did you say? Medalux? Medalux Explosive Research Company. l don't show any record of that delivery. l think there must be a mistake. Your company made a mistake. - Y'all made a mistake. - No. You don't understand. l know about every delivery here. They put it in this little log. We'll straighten this out with research. This is a sound-seeking projectile. l suggest no telephones. Don't cough. If you break wind, make it a quiet one. The slightest peep and your designer jeans won't fit no more. Y'all handle this after I go. Excuse me. I just realised, you could do me a favour and drop this off at Mr Fielding's office. Let me explain something. My friend Bootsie got killed doing this. l ain't carrying this cos you made a mistake. I carry from A to B. l have a wife and two kids. I'd like to see my daughters again. lt's on your way out. lt's no problem. If you just drop it off at Mr Fielding's. What about my daughters? What's in it for my family? What do you want? What's in it for me? l have beautiful daughters. You're asking me to risk my life. What will I get? $10? I have twin daughters. with pigtails. Would you take that off my desk and drop it off at Mr Fielding's? That's all I have. Please take it. I'm sorry, that's it. - Where's his office? - Along the corridor, down the steps. On your way out. The name's on the office. Just over there. I'm just doing this for my kids. This is how Bootsie got killed. All they found was $20 and a pair of Adidas. Along the corridor. Down the stairs. - We almost got fucked up. - Thank you. Shoe money for my daughters. $5 a shoe. That's four shoes. She knew you were hard to live with when she married you. lt's her fault for thinking you'd change. Thanks. l admire her for having courage to leave you in search of a better life. I'm sorry. I was trying to make you feel better. - Do me a favour? - Sure. Take a break from cheering me up. Keep the grip tight. There you go. Fire when you're ready. Grip down here. There you go. All right. Keep it up and to the left. All right? Excuse me. - Are you Russ Fielding, gunsmith? - Yeah. Have you ever seen this before? lt's a .308 rifle shell cut to fit the .44. - Where'd you get it? - Christmas gift. Charles Bronson is a friend of the family. - He gave me this for Christmas. - I'm Karla Fry, assistant manager. How are you? Beautiful place you have here. My name's Richard James. Very nice to meet you. Russ, could I see you for a minute? - Be right back. - Take your time, Russ. Goddamn, that's a big bitch. - Who is that man? - I don't know. He's got a .44 auto mag casing from here. l saw. You sure it's ours? - I made a whole bunch for Mr Cain. - Did you tell him that? - No. - Don't. Keep him there while I check him out. l think we have a problem. Fielding made that casing for Cain. You wanted to see me? I'd like to go over plan C and D. We've promised to deliver Thomopolis $10 million, Friday at 6pm. If we fail, I'll be put to some inconvenience, to say the least. So I'd like to go over it and avoid the mistakes made on the Adriano job. What mistakes? Adriano's was perfect. Adriano's was not perfect. lt was perfectly planned, but it was executed with incompetence. lt was partly my fault. l assumed if my instructions were clear, even you could follow them. - Obviously, I was wrong. - I don't understand. You supplied your thugs with guns from my club? Yes. But they were totally clean. Nobody could trace them. Nobody knows you planned the jobs. Nobody knows you wrote the notes, Karla did the job and left the notes. Then why is there a man in my club with shell casings from one of my guns asking questions? l don't know. - Who is he? - I'd say he's a cop. Wouldn't you? l don't know. I haven't seen him. Here he is, on television. Take a good look at him cos you're going to kill him. - What? - Kill him, burn him, blow him away. How long would it take to shave those legs? l suppose you're trying to be charming. - Just offering my grooming services. - I don't think so. - Chip, perfect timing for once. - Chip Cain. I'm the manager here. How are you, Chip? Beautiful place here, very comfortable. We do our best. Maybe you'd like to have a guest membership. That'd be nice, kinda like shooting guns in the house. Where can I send you an application? 1603 Hillcrest. A big white house. Beautiful place. We'll send it along with the .44 shells. - I'll be sure to duck. - Goodbye, Mr James. l guess that's my cue. Excuse me. You got a match? Damn. - Richard James. 1603 Hillcrest Road. - Right. Hey, Cain.you got a match? Here you go. Keep it. And, Jack, don't screw this up. - What about the cop in hospital? - He's guarded 24 hours a day. - Here's the impending Alphabet note. - Will they break this one? They'll crack it when we want them to. How'd it go? What would you guys say if I said a six-foot blonde works here? Witnesses reported a six-foot blonde at Adriano's. This isn't Detroit. Six-foot blonde women grow on trees in California. He's right. They're everywhere. You really need me! You can't tell there's something weird here? Meet me at my house at 1603 Hillcrest in about an hour. - Where are my vitamins? - Here's $20. Get some more. - My house in an hour. - What did he do, sell them? Freeze. Damn it, Axel. You scared the hell out of me. Sorry. I let myseIf in. How you doing? I'm tired. l had some work to do at the office. - You still at the insurance company? - Find anything? A lot of newspaper cut-outs about oil prices dropping. - Did you invest in oil stocks? - On a cop's pay? No way. And there's an ad for a club called 385 North. ls that one of your father's hangouts? Your father got shot cos he was on to something. But what? Do me a favour, use your connections at your company to find out about a guy named Maxwell Dent. I'll try. You can let yourseIf out. I'm gonna take a shower. Don't shoot nobody. - This has got to be a mistake. - There's his car. If he's here, he must be robbing the place. l don't like this, Billy. What would he be doing here? Maybe the Pointer Sisters live here. - What?! - Out back. Welcome to Wheel of Fortune. l thought I just heard Jack say. Watch out. The deck's very slippery. There's beer in the refrigerator or you can make yourseIf martinis. Wait. You're on duty. No martinis. Perrier water is what you want. Swimming trunks in the bedroom. Dive in the pool. - Why are you in a place like this? - A place like what? - Like this. Swimming pool, jacuzzi. - What? I'm spoiling myseIf rotten. The construction? l am embarrassed about that. I'm just using the other five bedrooms, compromising my lifestyle. You've stolen it. How can you steal a house? lt's my uncle's house. - ls he in rock 'n' roll? - No! Look at the big titties. Look at this, titties, orange juice, beer. Will you put your trunks on and get in this pool? l want you out of this pool and house in seven minutes. You're still a police officer. You'll get us all in deep shit. l love when you talk dirty. Get in this pool. - Get out of the goddamn pool! - I told you the deck was slippery. Taggart! What's taking you so long? What do you think? Sharp? Go right in, Mr President. Have fun. Excuse me. Who are you? And who are those people? I'm his representative. That's former president Gerald Ford there. lt doesn't look like Gerald Ford. Have you seen him without make-up? Probably not. This is what he looks like now, the ex-president. He couldn't get out when he was running the country. Now he's a civilian, it's his right to shake his ass. He says, ''l wanna go 385 North,'' and I said, ''Let's go.'' We came to party. You should be proud to have him here. - lt's our pleasure. - Thank you very much. Excuse me. - Can I have a coke with no ice? - One coke, no ice, coming up. - There you go. - Who's the popular blond? That's Nik Thomopolis. He owns this place. - That's seven bucks, buddy. - For a coke? I can get blown for $7. - Things are getting pretty crazy. - We're in deep with Axel again. We'll be directing traffic the rest of our lives anyway. - The hell with it. To Bogomil. - To Bogomil. Drinks are on the house, President Ford. What? My name's John Taggart. That's the name he's using now. His marriage is breaking up. The judge awarded her the name for the Betty Ford clinic and stuff. You're much better looking in person. Does the name Thomopolis mean anything to you? He's the biggest arms dealer on the West coast. - Do I look like Gerald Ford? - Y'all both look like Gerald Ford. Come on. Let's go. Gun! Go! Move it. Get out of here! Jesus, Billy! Come on, Axel. Watch yourself. Anybody in there? What the fuck is going on here? - Everybody back. - Whoever it was got away clean. What are you doing here? l ran a check. There is no Johnny Wishbone. You're illegal. Who the hell are you and why are you here? Now! I'm a cop. I didn't say before cos I knew you'd be upset. lt's a Detroit badge. Why are you in Beverly Hills? I'm attached to a multi-jurisdictional, Federal task force on organised crime, and my code name is Wishbone. I'm the Chief of Police here, if there's a Federal task force, l want to know! You can call back to Detroit tomorrow and ask for an lnspector Todd. He'll tell you all about it. My real name is Axel Foley. Call there between nine and ten, Detroit time, he'll tell you. Right now, I have the rest of my case to finish, so excuse me. And you two, what the hell were you doing here? Checking parking meters in the area? - Well, sir. - We're off duty, sir. I live nearby. Listen, if you do anything except traffic duty, I'll have you both investigated and suspended! Technically, this is traffic duty. Technically, you're a goddamn idiot. Get out of here, Taggart! - Yes, sir. - Jesus Christ. - Are you sure you got super glue? - Yeah. This is Wild Kingdom. l tried to create a stress-free environment. You have. These are my friends. That's Sidney. He's a wandering jew. This is Mona. Hi, baby. They actually like different kinds of music. If I play the Beatles, the begonias perk up. If I play Beethoven, they wither. The ferns like the Boston Pops. - But everybody loves Mozart. - Who's this? Big Al. Had him about six years. lsn't he great? What music does he like? - James Brown. Drives him nuts. - ls that turtle shit in there? - Turtles are amazing to me. - What are you doing? I'm curious to know where his dick is at. Give me him. You know where it is, don't you, Big Al? - Do turtles have dicks? - How's it hanging, Big Al? Give me that super glue. - Billy's really out there, isn't he? - Billy's pretty fucked up. - I heard that. - I know. I was joking! Give me the super glue. - What's that music from? - The Dating Game. Let's give Billy a big Dating Game kiss. Where's your phone? - ln the bedroom. - Where, in the alligator pit? Jesus, Billy. - Jeff? Axel. - Axel, it's one in the morning. Jeffrey, stop talking. How's the Ferrari? Great. What a great car! Do those seats go back? l was with Marcy trying to get the seats back. You can't do freaky shit in that car. You have to do something for me. - Something you don't want to do. - Am I going to get in trouble? - You see that? - Weird. lt's not weird. lt's simple. The fumes from the super glue attach to the acid from the fingerprints. lt's a street cop trick. Hasn't filtered down to you boys yet. - Now we have to match it. - We could use the computer downtown. There won't be anybody there this time of night, Sarge. Shit. There goes my medical insurance. - You can be such a pussy sometimes. - Really. Let's go. Come on. You boys definitely get an A in High-tech. lt takes 60 cops to do this shit in Detroit. Charles Cain. Used to be Charles Campos. l just met this guy. He works in the Beverly Hills Gun Club. - He does? - This ain't the guy, he's a weasel. - This isn't a master criminal. - That's his print. This guy had nothing to do with Bogomil getting shot. If he suspected him, he would've picked him up. Let's put an APB out on Cain. We can't. All we got is fingerprints. We need something else. - What do we do now? - Let's go to the Gun Club. Wait. lt's 1 1 :00. The Gun Club's closed. - So? - So? This is a big mistake. A big mistake. lt's against the law. Once we cross the line, there's no way back. I'll go. I'll go. See? Would you lighten up and take some risks? Fuck it. Let's go. - Shit. Alarm tape. - There are ways around alarm tape. If we open this door, the connection will break between the magnets. If we use this foil, and you squeeze it between the two magnets, then take your gum to hold it in place. Now the magnets have the illusion that the connection's not broken. Then we take our knife. Open the door without. We walk in without the alarm going off. You've done that before. l wasn't always a police officer, l fractured a law or two as a kid. - Can I have a piece? - lt's my last one. Split it. None for you. - What are we looking for? - A needle in a haystack. Give me some light over here. Shit. Here you go. What the hell is that? That knife. - lt's mine. Home protection. - Billy, we got to talk. - Did you get it? - Yeah. - What is that? - A needle in a haystack. Map coordinates? ls this lnspector Todd of the Detroit Police? lt is. I'm sorry to be bothering you, my name is Lionel Hand, I'm with the FBl Enforcement Bulletin. - I read it all the time. - Thanks. We're proud of it. Don't touch the leather. My director has asked me to interview an exceptional police officer, and your name was on our computer. - ls that right? - This is short notice, but could you meet me this morning for breakfast at my office? - How's nine o'clock? - Yeah. I'll be there. Thank you. My pleasure. Ring. Here's your coffee, sir. Just once a week, I'd like tea. Do you know what I mean? - Yes, sir. - That too much to ask? Come on, come on. Damn it, who tricked my ass? - 440. - Don't confuse me when I'm dialling. This is Todd. - lnspector Todd? - That's what I said. This is Harold Lutz. I'm chief of the Beverly Hills Police Department. Do you have an officer Axel Foley. Yes, he's under my command, but he's assigned to some multi-jurisdictional, Federal task force. l never know where the hell he is. lt's a real pain. l can't control him. He reports directly to the Feds. I have to go. What the hell are you doing in here? - This is not my office. - You damn right it isn't. l want to see if these coordinates intercept. What makes you think they mean anything? 9752 Gregory Way. - City Deposit. - What's City Deposit? lt's where banks take their money. l bet that's the next place that gets hit. Unit 21 , handle. Unit 22, assist. City Deposit, 341 Gregory. Lines are down. Unable to verify. Can't this car go any faster? Come on, guys. Come on. Looks good. I got it. Out of the hole. Move it. Come on. Let's do it. Here we go. Two, one. Three minutes! Sarge, relax and trust me. - You drive worse than Maureen. - No way! Where's the seat belt? - lt's a red light! - lt's green! - lt was red! - lt was yellow! 2:30. Some kind of construction. Shit! - Taggart, you coming? - I'm coming! Don't wait for me. Two minutes. What's that for? After the club shootout, l figured I needed more firepower. We got to talk. Who do you think you are? Clint Eastwood? Dirty Rosewood? 1 :30. Sound the alarm. You got a break-in. l need authorisation. - Authorised! - Fuck! Get out of here! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Get out! Get out! Go! Rosewood, get some wheels. - This is pretty sporty! - lt's all I could find. Police business! I need your car! I'm a police officer! God. Here I go again. Come on, let's go! - You hit a squad car! - I know the guy. He's a jerk! - Does the steering wheel work? - I'm steering! - Do the brakes work? - I haven't tried them. I'm sure we should have went left. Fuck! Are you driving with your eyes open, or are you using the Force? Stop! There's the truck. Now what? - This was the pick-up vehicle. - Let's follow it. Sarge? You old bloodhound! - Billy, isn't this. - Yeah. What the fuck is up? Check this out. l get $10 for cars, I get $20 for limos. What the hell is this? My truck. Here's $50. Put it next to a limo. Let me call you back. - I'm here to clean the pool. - Your name? - I'm the pool cleaner. - The pool was cleaned yesterday. lt was clean. Today it's dirty. Somebody made a mistake in the pool. What do you mean by ''mistake''? Someone had a little accident in the pool. - Accident? - There's something floating in it. - What? - During some wild party, somebody shit in the pool. I'm here to clean it up. - I see. - I ain't happy, but it's my job. You write names down, I clean pools. Where's the pool at? Who are these gentlemen with you? The Board of Health. They're making sure I do the job thoroughly. If you like, I can bring it by and you can verify it afterwards. - No, that's fine. - Excuse me. Jesus Christ! Wake up! This is what we always talked about. Look alive. You may never see it again. I don't want to step on your tongues. Why aren't my parties like this? You got to die sometime. Might as well be here. - What are we doing? - Whoever took that truck is here. - How are we supposed to find them? - Follow your dick. That's the girl from the Gun Club. - With Dent and Thomopolis? - The big bitch. Max! How'd you get in here? Forget I asked. I see how, it's the suit. Nice suit, Max. - This person is annoying us. - May I see your invitation? - I haven't begun to annoy you. - What's going on? lt's Max. Check your guest list cos Max ain't supposed to be here. - Are we having a problem? - Hef! Hugh Hefner! Axel Foley! l feel like I know you already cos l put your magazine up. Forget it. Here's some background on your guests. This is Thomopolis, he's into guns and drugs. And this is Max, and Max kills cops for a living. l don't know him or you. - I think it's time all of you left. - I happen to be a major contributor. We appreciate it. Goodbye. He appreciates it, Max, but take your ass home. You outdone your welcome. But it's been real, it's been nice. Everybody, party's over! Max fucked it up for everybody, so let's just go home. We'll go ahead as planned. Get Cain to prepare E. - You picked Dent's pocket? - I told y'all I wasn't always a cop. Yeah, you fractured an occasional law as a kid. This is not good. This is not good. See? Every now and then, an occasional long shot pays off. Dent's accountant, Sidney Bernstein. Anything Dent's into, he'll have a record. We'll visit him tomorrow. lt's all we got to go on. There's no B and D, I'm looking for something. And what about that cement truck? What about that, Rosewood? Talk to me! l have a theory on that. The cement truck was a tactical decoy. A decoy? A diversion to protect the criminals' getaway. That's why it rammed the police car. Have you submitted yourself for drug testing yet? l want you in by Thursday. Understand? Are you aware that whoever was in that truck foiled the goddamn crime? - Do you? - Putz. - Did you say something? - He called you Putz. No, I called you a putz. He's right. Putz. And you. You, Mr Scribbler. What the hell were you doing there, Foley? - Aren't I a police officer, too? - Remains to be seen. - Did you call lnspector Todd for me? - Yes. He doesn't like you very much. Do you hear this insubordination? Yes, and l've never heard such abuse. Whatever's happened, the fact remains that the robbery was foiled and the money was saved. If I were you, I'd concentrate on cracking this code and determining where the E crime will be. There's not many targets beginning with E, so find them. - I will, Ted. - Mayor! Yes, Mayor. And you! I want you out of here! Get out of here, you degenerate! You're not even part of this department! - ls this a black thing? - Out. - Aren't you leaving for Detroit? - Today at noon. You're not going to make it. You're going to get fired. We started this together, we'll finish together. Check if Bernstein owns a car. Give me a pen. Give me a pen! '86 Mercedes. License number CRL 507. Naturally, I can see. I mean, l understand. Somebody. Wait. Come right in! Don't let the fact that my door's closed dissuade you from entering my office. Beverly Hills Police. Are you Mr Sidney Bernstein? - Lucky guess. - You have 25 unpaid tickets. - We have a warrant for your arrest. - 25? What 25? - You have 25 unpaid parking tickets. - I pay all my tickets. Do you own a black Mercedes-Benz, license plate number CRL 507? - 507? That's my wife's car. - You have 25 tickets. lt's under my name, but it's my wife's car! No, no, no! Bitch! These tickets haven't been paid. Can you cuff Mr Bernstein? There are people out there with chainsaws! You have unpaid tickets and it's your car. We're taking you in. Wait. l've got an idea. ls there something that I have in this office that I could hand to you and that would make you kind of forget that you're holding those little pink tickets there? What are you saying? You'd have something in that hand and this hand you'd forget about. That hand you'd go, ''What did l have there? I don't remember.'' You mean if I had. - ..$200 in this hand? - Ouch! Let go of my arm. $200? Ouch! Please, I'm robbing you. That's what I'm doing. Here's one, here's two. They're real crisp. l have to use your computer to wipe all evidence of this transaction out. - No problem. No problem at all. - Thank you, Sidney, so much. Certainly. Certainly. Also, one other thing. I'm sure you understand my contact at headquarters wouldn't want his name to be known. - Don't I know it. - Could you excuse me while l. Yeah, it's secretive. lt's like a James Bond thing! Yes, yes. - Thank you. - No problem! No problem at all. Anything you want to use. - I can't believe. - I don't want to hear it, Billy. Jan, Axel. How you doing? What do you got? Strange. Before 1978, everything's blank. lt's classified, but its policy date is 1974. l found something interesting in our foreign office in London. Dent was the cultural attaché to the East German embassy in Honduras. He's got a racetrack, shooting club, drilling rig companies, an oil company. - Oil company? - That's his biggest business. But from these records, seems like Dent's in trouble. He's let his insurance lapse on everything in the last six months. Dent Petroleum, even the shooting club. All his businesses except one. - Which one is that? - The racetrack. Empyrean Fields. He's got a huge policy on that one. Good, good, good, good, good. OK. Great. - When your father wakes up. - He's better. He's up and around. Tell him you found his man. Bye-bye. Empyrean Fields. - Rip off his own racetrack? - Yes, if it's insured. - What was in the files? - We won't find oil field equipment - if we find Dent. - If we find him? Dent's visa application had today's date on it. If we don't step on it, he's gone. l don't know what happened on the City Deposit, Max. - And the Foley hit? - I don't know. That's why I need you to go along personally to make certain nothing goes wrong. I'm on the team, of course. l broke it. You son of a bitch. You beat the computer? - What's it say? - ''Chinguen sus puercos, Carlos.'' Screw you cops. Signed, Carlos. - ''Puercos'' ain't cops. - Pigs. Another word for cops. Wait a minute, Carlos? lt is Cain. Charles Cain. Carlos is Spanish for Charles. Cain changed his name. He didn't want to grow up to be poor. - Cain is the Alphabet robber? - I ain't said that. The first code was very hard. This is easy. Whoever did this wanted the cops to get it. You ran numbers? - I wasn't always a cop. - He fractured an occasional law. The horses have now reached the starting gate. Freeze! Hit the floor! Freeze, goddamn it! 1 :30. 1 :15. 30 seconds. Time! Goodbye, Mr Cain. ..winning it by a nose. General was second and Marshall's Madness came third. - Our horse didn't come in. - Cain's did. The result is now official. The winner, Johnny's Dilemma. - Police officers! - Police! We're a little late. All I can tell you now is that we are confident that we have identified the Alphabet Bandit. The man was shot dead at the scene this morning by security guard Jack Stiles. ln his latest robbery attempt, the man was fatally wounded. So I give you my oath right here there will be no F crime. My computer team cracked the Alphabet Bandit's code this afternoon. All of the notes, mind you, were signed ''Carlos'', right? Carlos, which, as you all know, is Spanish for Charles. Do you hear what I'm saying? - If it's Cain, where's the money? - Where's Dent? - You said shipping oil equipment. - But how? Where? - Let's put an APB out on Dent. - For what reason? - Where'd you get that? - What? lt's coming from there. Excuse me. How did the mud get on the horse? He was grazing in the pasture. - Where's the pasture at? - There. Dent's oil field. Bogomil had that red mud on his sneakers. Maybe he got a tip, he came here and they tried to waste him. - Who pulled the Alphabet jobs? - Dent's going broke, OK? So he heists some bank, heists some jewellery, then throws this easy code with Cain's name on it. Simple. You frame Cain, kill Cain, Cain's the Alphabet killer, Dent gets away scot-free. Why would an oil man risk this, even if he was broke? Dent's not buying oil equipment, he's buying guns from Thomopolis. - Selling them in Central America. - Why not split with the cash? Dent buys guns here for a million and sells them there for 10 million. - Look at all that oil. - I don't see oil. l see trucks. Come on, Billy. Billy, what are you doing? l've been wanting to wear this for a while. Are you nuts? Billy, we have got to talk. What the hell is this? You can never have too much firepower. - Come on! - Shit. Bogomil was here. - You like rap music? - Yeah. I'm from the Rap Coalition of America. Throw that gun over there. If you like rap music, why ain't you smiling? - I'm smiling. - Smile. Let's rap together. - Those look like oil pumps to you? - lt looks like World War lll. Here, Billy. You don't have one of these, do you? You guys hang around the back, I'll check out the front. - What are you doing? - Element of surprise. What? Are you nuts? Fool the connecting wire into thinking it's still intact. These documents will make your life much easier. You need to sign them. You still got that thing? lt's a bad idea. Of all the ideas you had, this is the worst. - Sure you know what you're doing? - Trust me. Come on, Axel! Get him! Get your head down! ''Pull pin.'' - What are you doing? - ''Extend.'' ''Pull open and.'' Wow! ''Release safety.'' Aim through there, push this. Fuck Rambo. Get me the fuck out of here. - Cover me. - Go, Axel! - Let's get the hell out of here! - Hold it! - Stay right there! - Freeze! All right! Lay your weapons down! Mr Foley. You involved yourseIf in business that doesn't concern you. That was a mistake. Goodbye, Mr Foley. Women. Come on, let's go. - Police! You're under arrest! - I think they know that, Billy. Drop your weapons! Put your hands on your heads! - They got their hands up. - What took you guys so long? Shit. We're in trouble now. God damn it! Axel's AWOL. We can get out of this if we keep quiet. Don't say anything. What the hell have you done here? Looks like a goddamn war zone. What have you done, Taggart? We solved the Alphabet crimes. Shut up. Who the hell is talking to you? l solved the Alphabet case over an hour ago. And you! I don't give a damn who you're working for. You're in jail. - Chief. - Shut up. What are you doing, bringing a fire fight to my city? - You're out of the cop business! - Will you just listen a minute? - You shut your mouth! - No goddamn! You shut up! This is what the Alphabet crimes are about.guns! That guy sold them, then bought them with stolen money from Adriano's at his own racetrack. He was going to Central America. If you'd take your head out of your ass, you'd see we solved the whole thing! Lutz, why didn't I know about this? Chief Lutz doesn't have the guts to hear the truth. We had to go undercover with Foley to solve this case. You're fired, Taggart! - Yeah? Kiss my ass! - Kiss mine! You're fired, too! Lutz, l've had it with your abusive attitude. I'm sorry. I get carried away. - You're fired. Do you understand? - Don't overreact, Ted. l want you out of here now. Get out of here! Fired! - You'll regret this, Ted. - l've regretted it for two months. You too. You're out of here. Will you get out? - Are they civilians? - You bet. - I'll kick your ass later! - Axel, thank you so much, really. l've got a charity meeting for the homeless for Beverly Hills. I'd like to make a donation. Here's $200 from Sidney Bernstein. That's my alias. l don't like publicity. Thank you, Axel. l mean, Sidney Bernstein. - Thank you, gentlemen. - Thank you, sir. ''If you get your head out of your ass''? ''Kiss my ass''? You're getting more like me every day. Next thing you know, you'll have afros. Big dicks and all. - You make police chief yet? - Right. You are the new chief? lnspector Todd? Ted Egan, mayor of Beverly Hills. l told your mayor we're very thankful you allowed Foley to help us. He says he's acquired all his skills under your expert tutelage. Certainly. He's just arrived. Expert tutelage? What the fuck have you been saying? Let me talk to him. Now that you're done being a California hero, get your ass home to your real job. I'm leaving now. My ass left already. l got to catch up with it. One other thing, your secret partner Mario Andretti Friedman wrecked the goddamn Ferrari. Here, you talk to Jeffrey. Axel, it wasn't my fault. There was a bus coming. Hello? He hung up. Hello? You don't have to go home now. - Let's catch a marlin in Mexico. - Fishing's too tiring. lt's back to Detroit for some old-fashioned street violence. Come with me. Your wife left you. Come hang out. I know a lot of girls. - Maureen came back. - Did she? Congratulations. The people you least expected, they're studs. The man's a stud and we ain't even know it. - Couldn't live without you? - Her mother didn't have cable TV. lt wasn't no mother's cable TV. Your cable brought her back. - I'm off. - Thanks a lot, Axel. Don't thank me. I love you guys. - See you around. - Be cool, man. Anything we can do for you? Yeah. Take care of my uncle's house till he gets back. Axel, that's not really your uncle's house, is it? Yeah. Trust me. What the hell's going on? Who are you? Who's that black guy? The FANTASTIC FOUR It is the speed of light. In miles per second. But if you prefer kilometers per second. Then . 299 mil . 792.458. - Thanks Reed. - You're welcome, sir. Show-off! I saw no more They try to respond. While traveling at that speed is theoretically possible. It is considered physically impossible. Until the discovery of "Colosus" A radioactive comet which generates an energy source. With elliptical orbit of 10 years. It will pass closer to Earth tonight. It'll be so close . that will pass through the Van Allen belt. Thus decreasing the speed rotation of the Earth. To be visible to the human eye. Bring their telescopes . and his imagination. And above all . fun you. That's it, you can retreat. We can not squeeze more angles to these heights. Sure! We have to. Your calculations are incorrect. Here . not out. All I can say is that unless consider the speed variation. The result can be disastrous. Victor, we have worked on this for four years. - I do not want to ruin it. - Me either. So we do a simulation. I feel . better. D 'agreement, we have time. RESIDENCE FOR STUDENTS MRS STORM. Johnny go! Johnny! You killed. It's not fair . not fair! State, calm down.

In your calculations, there are still errors. My calculations are based on your. I know, I only ask that we review them. - Reed, see the train . - What is simulation? No time, "Colosus" is here. Everything we have dreamed Reed, happening now! We donate to the world's energy. For the future, my friend. Reed. - Is increasing the speed. - It is not possible. - You go to overheat - No!

Ben . - Thing . What to look .? In what I have become? !! Ben? Reed . what did you do? What have you done? Well, let us help. Look at me! Ben! Well, all of us will help you. Ok? Come on. We are ready, Lieutenant. Goodnight, Mr .. Grimm. I am Dr. Hoffmann. Resterrà isolated. Until we know the causes of its . condition. I need a prellievo blood. Although I do not know how to get it. Take place meter work on a fix. I know of nothing to create fires. And 'what I'm talking about. Yes . great fire? No, little things like . He believes that can explain it? Maybe do a demonstration. Perhaps focusing on a part of my body as . as my hand, and are the "Flames" Spegniti! Spegniti! Spegniti! He seems to have found the magic word, Doc. Miss Storm, her. It does not break things, or Infimma, or something, right? No. Fine. What I do . Miss Storm? Behind her It feels good? Take, take out from her blood. OK. These people are medical miracles. Hold the key to greater discovery of history. Colosus "lives within them." If you could get it . Imagine the power it could have. As we remove him and put it in one man? In one man? I suppose that yes you can. It was not a question, Doctor. There are limits to the powers of man. Interesting. Thank you, Doctor Hoffmann. The project must start preparing immediately. At the end of my dreams will come true. Completely! Some preparations will need something extra . I have to remove the diamond to the Jeweler. And I'll get right now. It is dangerous to wander here in the night. What is what you seek? We come to see the Jeweler. If he had brought flowers, It would be well received. - Tell him the good reward. - The reward you very well. Revenue. I can not stand it anymore, We must get away from here. We would seek if they knew that we are with life. - I do not like this. - There is no telephone, television . Nothing! We are patient, we are prisoners. What do you think, Ben? I want to go away, Reed. I do not want to be here. But I think we are contagious, c'avrebbero locked or not so. Sooner or later they will know what we have. We have to go to my laboratory. Why so much mystery? Why do not they let you out? Exactly! I think we run . we have nothing to lose. Johnny go . If we do all together, it makes nothing. What do you want me to do? The diamond is not for sale at any price. You see . you have another mistress. The jewel belongs to my beautiful Queen . Alicia. It does not seem very happy to own it. Silence! It will be happy when you realize that we are equal. The Discarded of this world. But that is not serving you. They said too much already. Now, allotanatevi from here! This we can not do. If we do not sell the diamond, we have no other option . take it! It seems that your chances of survival are reduced . You tell your boss that the diamond not for sale . Point! If you come back again, I will not be so merciful. Door to the Queen to my room. We'll need a moment just to . meditate. That was his response, His Majesty. We have to eliminate them? No. It is very dangerous, I'll take care. Stay well where he is. I come from them tomorrow at sunset. We need some blood tests, Come with us. What do I do with these idiotii? Tell us about . back in 10 minutes. OK, let's play, who opens? Cabbage! Excellent! Ouch . Well done Sue! All that our quarrels are served. This can give us the answers that we need. - What language is that? - I have no idea. This looks familiar. - What did you Johnny? - I believe it is the exit of this place. Look. - Bingo! - Good job Johnny. Sorry children, but I have to escape. Wow! It's incredible! Johnny, this seems to be A kind of "Laser Atomic" And 'brilliant. Thanks. Dr. Richards, apparently her. He knows many things. Who are you? My name is . Destiny. "Thanks, Sue" . Where are we? In my small but beautiful country. Here I am the supreme being. "Come and visit him in another occasion . And bring the family. " Excuse my sarcasm . Stop it with this. No no no no! I have not even begun. - Let's go home now. - Do not go anywhere! And 'how you rewarded for having saved? Fleeing from my help and by my care? Nobody asked for help, Tin Man. It acts impulsively, Young Jonathan. A tip . keep calm. I feel compassion for this' today. Return to your cell and wait like good children. - Or else what? - Thing? You suffer like in your worst nightmare. Sorry for the delay. I missed something? No go home. You are sadly optimistic. I was hoping not to have to come to this. Dead or alive, for me it's the same thing. Back when saree dead. "It's time of Destruction" We have to get out of here. - Wait a minute. - Here we cover. "Flames of me." - Well, it's time to leave. - Sure. - Come on, come on. - Stò doing as fast as I can. Not sufficiently velove. - Flames, out,. What happens?! Reed? He just wanted to say that What happens happens Even if we get back normal Or peggioriamo Something good is born with this. Cabbage! Why are they so timid? What did you say? - I mean . - What did you say to be shy? It's a problem that comes to 'sudden Susan..la shyness Your problem is that you feel invisible. So . you disappear, you know? Johnny, you've always been a hothead, is not it? Becomes incandescent as the Fire. Then . - It becomes Fire. - Exactly. And I've always wanted to handing me to be able to be everywhere . And simultaneously help everyone. Ben. Always use brute force When your only intelligence is not enough Do you realize . I discovered something, through blood tests. Our DNA has been altered. But I believe that "Colosus" He has touched our hearts. We showed that our worst defect It can be a virtue. "Sacred Freud, Batman." I think he's right Yes, but our changes are only temporary. Instead, Ben is The Thing all the time. Well, that still I do not know? Yes? Why ?, I do not care. You can live your life like normal people. I will always be a monster. That was not the right man? There is nothing else to say. I go from here. I do not stop. My God! "'Do this, a goirno or the' other '. Cavolii!" Look! You can not be wandering here. - I do not want problems. - I do not, but you have to leave. - I just want to stay here. - I do not care what you want. What are you ?! What are you ?! Well, what do you think? - I see you . - As a clown! Magnífica. Thanks. One for you. And here is your. Idiot. What good? We Fantastic Four, remember? Rather, "The Terrible Three." The will pass. Welcome Friend. Here no one is an enemy. Others will never as we understand you. You see quite tired. Need a place to rest? A place to which to belong? Come with me. I'll take you to your home. There is no track the seizure of Alicia Masters. He was working on some commemorative statues . I feel like a stranger. This is not my place. I do not belong there. Let me go, please. It could have locked up forever, but I will never be his Queen. Never! What's up ?! - We have a new member in the family. - IS ?! It is the most fascinating thing I've seen. He should know. Supervises the Queen, must not get out of here until I say so. Hey you. I said "vigilant", not "sniffing" Where is it? Let me present, Ben. How much pain you have to endure, my beautiful brother? Now it will end, I will take away all the pain. Here you find a house. A place where you will find the greatness it deserves. Give him whatever he wants. Treat it well. Rest, traveler. The life that you should have. You got it now. Doctor, I have to leave, I want the Laser smart on my return. Some questions? Very good! How do you know that on the diamond? And also on "Colosus." Reed, you're the only one He knows how to develop that experiment. You're right. No one has tried anything with "Colosus" except you. Apart Victor, of course. - Where is the yellow dress? - In the closet. Victor is alive. Victor is alive. Fate. Cerchate diamond! Protect diamond. I'll give you just one minute to escape. Time out. Touch Diamond and kill. - Do it! - I mean it. Please, do not hold back for me. Let them go on. Ben Grimm! Ben? I said, "Let them go away" Clear, no problem. Go away. Ben? Let them go. Stay where you are, I can do a lot of damage before it gets here. Fate "And 'Time of Destruction." Well, no! I love you . Very well . It seems that love you make more "soft". Kill it. Let him go. I have what I wanted. And a small "life insurance." Hello . Dr. Richards . I hope that you may rejoice in the "see me". This is a small gift, I hope for his sake that it is operating. I diamond, and a friend of Lord Grimm. By the way, the laser that you saw, It is now finished. Let me show you its potential. You have 12 hours to surrender before me. Or destroy New York. Good night. - Let's move your. - Do not go anywhere without me to. - Ben! - Oh, Ben! No questions, now Team It 'good to have you with us . Destiny is our old friend Victor. Cho thing? - Yes, and also a friend of yours. - I already know. Wait a minute. It's my fault for this situation. Ata there waiting, and we know it. It is not necessary that you trapped. - Do not talk, I have my reasons. - Also I have my reasons. I love you, Reed. I love you too. And I have to make sure that nothing happens to my sister. Also . we "Fantastic Four" Come on! Look, you do not believe that everything This is too easy? Yes, we're going right into a trap, It is not so Reed? I do not know, I had never done before. - Where are we going? - For beyond. I hope there are no problems. Perhaps the first thing we come early. Listen, pay attention to anything. Johnny . I'll see if I can disarm the Laser. Pathetic. You are pathetic. Half the fun is the hunt. You have taken away even that . Fine. At least you left me is pleased to be able to kill. Of course, after taking what I need from you. "Colosus", is not it? Victor . Victor? . Of course! A name from the past. You can call me Dr. Doom. What happened ten years ago. He made me what I am now. What you did, Reed. He turned into this! Watch it! Watch it! You have never seen such grace? Within this there is a face that "Colosus" remember. It will be the main tool my revenge. What I brought in, also will stay inside me. Fine. Imagine what I will become. A small gift for you, sir Grimm. An object of love. You can see how my men kill who hails from loving you. Pathetic. Can you see the irony? It starts the operation! See it in this way, Reed, at least you will save New York. Currently. No! Stop them! "And 'Time of Destruction" Now. "Flames." Thirty seconds to activate the laser. Shoot! I can not stop him. Of course you can. They are like the fire since he was a child. "Flames of me." Fate. I think no one has presented. They are Ben Grimm. Are Alicia Masters. Enchanted to meet you. Enchanted to meet you. It's not really a challenge to get away from you, Victor. You're right, Reed! Despite all that has happened, even so I will have what I want. I will enjoy very . ammazzandoti. That is to groped to kill me. That is to groped to kill my friends. And this It is to be a real jerk. Reed, help me. We were friends, he recalls. Hold on, Victor. When the time comes, you do not have the balls to do work. Ten years ago fallisti in the time of our triumph. You betrayed me! It was predestined that together c'impadronissimo of "Colosus." But now it is what separates us. You still have an opportunity, Reed . Allies ame! I will not rest until the moment in which non- I will have what is mine by right. To ol future mío friend. - Go home. - Hopefully it is not destroyed. Now take off, OK? We'll try not to get into trouble, at least until he returns. Have fun. Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org This is Alex from North Star, over. - Hi, Alex. - Hi, Zoe. Can you get Jack for me? Jack. North Star's on line 1. Thanks. Hi, Alex. How's going? I'm Fine, Jack. I'll tell you what? I sure would enjoy the eclipse, right now. Ain't no fun on company time, pal. OK, people. The moon has covered the sun and we are now in the shadow of the eclipse. Weird. The eclipse looks like a big empty black hole. Like inside of Jarrod's head. Yeah. Thanks, nerds' ball. Ow. What? Are your parents like . brainiacs or something? My mother is a forensic pathologist and my dad studies meteorology. I didn't know your dad studies meteors. Why do we put up with him? How's the last sector of ozone doing? Uh. It's thin. We're talking some serious deterioration. Uh, you can thank China for another billion tons of fossil fuel emissions. You think half of a dozen of other countries should feel that rath? Hey, Jack. When I get back, we'll break in the bottle of Scotch you've been saving. We'll get blissed and solve all the world's problems. Hey, listen. Our latest scan picked up an anomaly. Look up. Look way up. How far? 85 kilometers, give or take a few. The temperature in mesosphere dropped 20 degrees. I wonder if that's linked to solar eclipse? I guess, it's possible. You should publish the paper on it. Scientific America. Face article by rogue atmospheric physicist. No, thank you. Publish papers gives me trouble. You're always getting into trouble. Yeah, I realized that once I got married. - That's why Alex and I prefer single life. - Oh. Yeah, yeah. Love being single. Day of time is just late, everyone. So in. a mind numblingly, incredibly boring solar eclipe. Grab that? - Jack Tate's answering service. - Hi, can I have Jack, please? It's your wife. - Emma . - Where are you? Divorce lawyer! I forgot. Yes, you did. You're 20 minutes late. Yeah, I'm sorry. I got distracted; something important came up. How soon can you get here? 45 minutes. We can grab a coffee. Off the clock. We'll wait. - Suppose you heard that too. - I heard. I'm sorry, buddy. Just keep an eye on prime energy deposit. It's much smaller as temperature drops in mesosphere. Sure. No sweat. Ug. We're fine here. You got a lot going on. Take the weekend off. You sure? What about the data? Uh, no. We got backup. Beside, we're coming straight in. Thanks buddy. I appreciate it. See you Monday. Good luck, mate. Jack? If you need a friend to talk to. I'm fine. Thanks, Zoe. Captain, let's head back to Hobart. Maybe, we can solve some over the weekend. Right. Back to Hobart. The temperature is dropping really fast. What's happening? Captain? Captain? Up to the bridge. It's another beautiful spring day in downtown Hobart. Temperature is pleasant 72 degrees. Looks like the sunshine will stay with us for a few more days. Jack Tate. You're late Jack. I've been waiting two days. Where is last week's report? Ah. It's coming. We're sticking with some unexpected data; taking a little longer to analyze. How much longer? Very soon. Yeah. As a reminder, the last time you went over the budget on monsoon study, we had . Walter, I'm loosing you. You can't lack behind again, Jack. Now, I can buy you a week, tops. I. Er. I . go through . dead zone . Uh! He annoys me. 12 years, I've been putting up with this crap. He's the best field scientist ICRO has. - I wouldn't be so hard on him. - Yeah. Well, you're right. Maybe instead of Beijing, his next assignment should be. Siberia. Or some bullshit. Are you two absolutely sure you can't turn this around? No. - Absolutely. - Absolutely? You won't settle down, Jack. We're back in my hometown, Naomi likes it here . and you're about to accept the project to go to Beijing! That's my job, Emma. I don't want to quit ICRO. See? This is exactly why our marriage is not working. No, no. We just need to talk about this, not from the blood-sucking parasite lady. No offense. None taken. All we do just talk. Nothing changes. I want a divorce. Give me a little more time. I'll work something out. I'll get out of this project to the Beijing. I've heard all this before. Just a little more time. Please. Hey, kido. Where are you going? To Franny's. You want me to give you a lift? No, I'm walking. Naomi, why don't you sit down. I think we should talk. About what? How you forgot my 16th birthday three days ago? I had a surprise plan. Yeah, I'm sure you did. I got to go. - Kido, would you give me a break? - Oh, dad. I'm not a kid. I know what's going on between you and mom. I know that this family is imploding, and there is nothing I can do about it. You're workaholic. Your job comes first. It always has. - That is not true. - Uh, you know it is. You get a cause and you forget about us. We moved half way around the world for you and you never even asked what she wanted. What I wanted. You're right. You're right. I've been selfish, and arrogant and pig-headed. Yeah, you have. Would let me make it up to you? I'm sorry, dad. I got to go. - Rough day? - Yep, you could say that. Well, we're gonna have to delay the meeting until we get the report from Jack Tate. Yeah. About a week. Yes, I'm trying to. Yeah. Just cut him too much slack. Well, thank you. Okay. Bye-bye. I wish you could come. Oh, yeah. You and me and your girlfriends, on the cruise, would be a little crowded. There's always room. You paid for the suite. Well, consider it as pay back for my business trips. Oh, I will. Sally! Stop your barking! You damn dog. What the hell? Would you look at that? Sally! - Rise and shine! - Oh god. - You're early. - Well, I just love my work. Sleeping in the office. Rough weekend, huh? I had to get jump on the data report. Sure, you did. And yes. And there was avoiding Emma. That's what I thought. Jack Tate's answering service. Brent Durrant said he might have an emergency response. Hey, Brent. It's Jack. What? Stand back. - Carefull. - Don't worry. - Jack. - Brent. - I'm sorry. - Just tell us what happened. We have 15 bodies. No survivors. Looks like the engine was still running. The course was set. The boat on the ground with nobody at the helm. What killed them? We don't know. There appears to be extensive tissue damaging. Tissue damage? What kind of tissue damage? We won't know until we get the autopsy report. Listen. Zoe and I need to get on that boat. Alex might have left video log or data entry that might explain what happend. - It's really damp in here. - Be careful. It's slippery here. It's wet. What the hell happened? This is gonna be a problem. It's soaked. Hello? Walter, I'm onboard on Northstar. Alex and everyone. They're all dead. What? Who died? What are you talking about? Alex and the entire crew are all dead. How did that happen? The boys have some sort of tissue damage. The entire ship, inside now is dripping with condensation. Jack, you're not making any sense here. This is the craziest thing I've ever heard. I know.I know how crazy that sounds. Now, what do we tell their families? The autopsy reports are pending. I'll make sure you're informed immediately. Emma's doing it? Yeah. What about Alex's log? Maybe, there is a clue there. Something. Well, we have Alex's hard drive. But, I'm not sure if it's been damaged. OK. In the meantime, I'll get our people start to looking into this. Call me as soon as you have any update. Yes. They're all dead. I spoke with Alex three days ago. Three days. And now he's gone. Let's get out of here. - Ready? - Think so. Okay, let's see . Looks like a lot of files are corrupted. Last file on video log is the weather SAT images. What the hell happened out there? There, did you see that? What was it? The data is corrupted, but it looked like a tear or rift in the ozone. It's too fragile. We need to comb up the data to a stable drive before we get into it. Hey, what you find out? Can you get over here right now? There is something you need to see. I'm on my way. Comb the drive and call all the data from the weather satellite of the last sector. Jack? Bring me back couple of chocolate bars. Zoe, when was the last time you checked your blood sugar? I'm fine. Just bring me chocolate. I have information about a cold front 750 km from the Australia south coast. It is only 90 kilometers wide. I've never come across the cold front so localized. Look at isoterm analysis. Have you seen anything like this before? No. Interesting. Can we get the temp from the circumpolar account? What's the current weather forecast of that region? Light wind out of the east. Clear sky. Nothing unusual. Should we tell Barker? No, no need. It'll probably burn up in a few hours. But, you know, keep an eye on it. Emma. What you got? Thanks for coming. This is one of the crew. How were they killed? Ice crystal formation in the bodies. It was so rapid, they almost ruptured spontaneously. Ice crystal? Yeah. I know it doesn't make a lot of sense. Take a look at this. - What am I looking at? - Urea cells. Notice the crystallized fractures around the outer edges? Yeah. I see them. I'm guessing, these cells froze at somewhere between 80 and 100 degrees below zero. - How fast would the people . - They wouldn't have known what hit them. You have the time of death? Best we can do right now, it's some time Friday afternoon. 72 hours ago. Right after I spoke with Alex. Jack . No, I'm okay. I'm sorry. I need to take this. Zoe? I'm here. National Weather is tracking a cold front. They pick it up a few hours ago. Jack. The coordinates match with North Star's position. OK. Ruff in a simulation based on our data. Mesospheric, ozone, eclipse weather. And Zoe, factor in the rift. If there's connection, we'll know what we're dealing with. We copied the damaged hard drive. We lost most of the ship's data. But, we did rescue points toward the anamolies. We're creating a simulation of what we believe killed the crew. We got a lot of people anxious for answers. So, what do you get, Jack? Solar eclipse seems to have an unexpected impact on mesosphere. It causes the sudden and violence further drop in temperature. Triggering an increase the air density. The ozone, which usually provides the buffer between us and the mesosphere was too weak to handle it. Due to the damage from the man-made pollution. The atmospheric pressure created a rift in the ozone. Now as you know, hot air rises, and cold air drops. The mesosphere air that leaked through the ozone rift created a funnel straight down to the Pacific ocean. Now, we suspect that the very deadly cold front was born. - Close to Northstar? - Looks like it. Northstar probably had no idea what hit them. How cold is the air from mesospheric rift? Minus 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Now by the time it reaches the earth surface, it's probably cut in half. But, we believe that it was still cold enough to flash-freeze a human body and a still-halt the ship. As a reminder, this is just a simulation. Just a theory. Nothing has been proven. The National Weather Service did pick up a localized cold front in the same area as North Star. - And it is moving towards that coast. - As a scientific fact, the coldest regions on earth are not the poles. but the mesosphere around us. Walter, in my professional opinion, this cold front is deadly. - It was your opinion, Jack. - Walter, it is convincing argument. We should explore this. Jack is right, the temperatures in mesosphere hop around minus 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Can you tell me at this moment that this rift is factual? Documentable? Verifiable? No, not yet. As I said, the majority of the ship's data was destroyed by moisture. - I need to access another satellite with the. - Listen Jack, we can't go scare the pants off the public without the hard facts. Just upload every srap of data that you have, send it to us for analysis. Now, I'm assembling another team with John Duval and Christine Case. They're also analizing this anomaly. We'll keep you posted. I'll be in touch. As a precaution. I think we should ask our affiliate stations to monitor this cold front. There could be abnormality. I'll tell the team to stay late, and expect Jack's data. Do it. Or we're gonna be very bad, Zoe. Bad? As in illegal? Let's just say. serious gray area. What are we gonna do? We use a military satellite to search for the ozone rift. We're gonna need an access code? Not necessarily. I got a backdoor into the system. - Wow. You really are a bad boy. - Oh, please. Half of my data last year came from hacked satellites. We have to work quickly. I'm not sure how long we have access. Done! And what are you up to? Test Media Emergency Response. We can't wait for Walter. Need Brent to put a plan in action. Marlene, you got to come. I'll be a third wheel. I can't. My parents would kill me. Promise me, you'll take the history notes. I got you covered. - See you. - See you. Listen, Jack. This is way over my pay grade. A rift in the ozone, super cold air from stratosphere killing people. Mesosphere. And it's feeding the same cold front that killed the crew. There could be other explanations. A chemical leak onboard. Maybe CO2. Oh, come on Brent. That doesn't make any sense. The point is, we don't have the answers. No, we just have 15 bodies. And no official autopsy reports and no hard dates on the cold front. Look, by tomorrow morning, we'll have some facts. No, tomorrow morning can be too late. If it is Tasmania, people are going to die. You have no proof! Brent, last year, who called in the hurricane that hit Queensland? You did. Within hour, we were tracking it. That's right. I called before the weather satellites picked it up. I'll lose my job if I alert the emergency bulletin based on a theory. Hell, what will I even say? Oh, I don't know. Maybe, you can try "A severe cold front may be coming." I can't. This cold front is real, Brent. You're the new leader of the emergency response. People should be warned. Is it something we should know about there, Jack? No, Sarah. Believe me, if there's a threat I would know about it. I don't believe this. You are as bad as my boss. Go back to your lab. Get me something other than a theory. Theories don't kill people, Brent. If this cold front hits the coast, it will do exactly like it did to North Star. A lot of people are gonna die. Weather report is saying that if it hits, it's only likely to drop ten degrees. They're wrong, Em. I'm picking up Naomi from school right now. You should call your parents. Tell them to meet us in the lab. They will be safer there. Our generator is well insolated. And we'll get supplies. I know, Jack. Are you that sure? You know me, Em. This isn't about over reacting. This is about being smart. By the time the suits get their heads out of the sand, it's gonna be too late. Marlene! Where's Naomi? I'm not sure, Mr. Tate. I have not seen her. Marlene, this is very important, OK? I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't. - Mr. Tate, I really don't want to get involved. - Where is she? She went to Ryan's Beach Head with Franny and Jarrod. But, you can't tell her I told you. I'm sorry Franny. Maybe, you guys should have come on your own. What? And leave you sitting in Mr. Preston's math class. - I'm gonna check out the waves. - You go ahead. We're gonna change. All right. - Jarrod's gonna love my new bathing suits. - Has your mother seen it? She would freak! Hey, it's Naomi's phone. You know what to do. So? - Waves could be better. - Ah, notice anything else? - No crowd. - Yeah. Great. So, you two are setting up a tent? I'm gonna surf. Jack. Latest SAT report, Ryan's Beach Head has southern moisture tip. The cold front probably hit there first - How close are you? - Another hour. - You're gonna drive right into it. - Yes, believe me I know. Not much of a choice. - You're gonna ground Naomi, right? - For the rest of her life, Zoe. You reach Margaret and Harold. Please, leave a message. Mom and Dad? When you get this message, give me a call on my cell. It is urgent. - So, do you miss me? - You know I do. Oh, I wish you were here. Walter, you would love it. The buffet is fantastic. Crab legs every night. - And they have a wonderful casino. - Well, that sounds exciting. Is everything okay? You're not still at the office? Well, sorry honey. Things are pretty hectic here. We've had an accident on one of our vessels. - How bad? - Bad enough. Oh, honey. I'm sorry. I don't want to bore you with the details right now. Just have fun on the rest of your trip. And I love you. Love you too. All our stations have reported in with the new data. Jonathan and Christine's teams are going over it now. Uhuh. When can they have the analisis written? I say, within two three days. No, tell them I need it in 24 hours. Oh no, nothing like this. This is the top priority. Give them any resouces they want. If they want another analyst, pull him off from the other teams I will approve the overtime. Okay. - My dad calling me again. - Whatever you do, don't. Don't worry. I'm not gonna answer it. Hey, it's Naomi's phone. You know. I still can't believe they went to see a lawyer. Maybe, they get back together. You know, happens all the time. - Yeah, I hope so. - Anyway, I'm going in. You coming? Please. I'll put my toe in. Nice, Jarrod! Hey, what's that? Weird. Jack, it's almost on top of you. What's your ETA? - Five minutes. I'll make it. - Hurry! That's so freaking cool! Are you watching this? It's incredible! I've never seen anything like that before Naomi! - Oh, no. - What? It's my dad. - Dad, I swear we're gonna come back tonight. - We are, Mr. Tate. Honest. Shut up. Both of you. Girls listen to me. Girls, do you see that fog? The bank of fog is cold enough to kill us. - What? - What?. We need to get to the car, right now. Right now. - Jarrod! - Franny! Stay here. Franny! - Jarrod! - Jarrod! - Mr. Tate? - Jarrod! Get out of the water! - Mr. Tate. What is going on? - Get out of the water. The cold will kill you! Get in, Jarrod. Get in. Hurry! Hurry, Jarrod! Jarrod, hurry! Franny! Run! Hurry! Run! Run! Hang on! Hello. This's Brent. Brent. It just hits the Ryan's Beach Head. - What just hits the beach? - The cold front. I know. We're taking steps. No, you don't know. It just killed two kids on the beach. What are you talking about? It's formed into ice fog. It must be 80 or 100 degrees below. You know what that does to human bodies? - It's not possible. - Kill them in seconds. It's gonna hit the city. I'm on it. I'm sorry about Franny and Jarrod. Dad, what's happening? There's a tear in the ozone. Frigid air is leaking through it. And a cold front, big one. - It freezes everything it touches. - Are we gonna die? - Are we, Dad? - Not if I can help. - Mom, Dad! - Emma! - What are you doing here? - I tried to call, but I couldn't get through. Is everything okay? A cold front is moving in. We got to go to the lab. It's better equipped. Jack and Naomi are gonna met us there. Don't need to go anywhere. Cold front hits, we got enough firewood and food to sit it out. Dad, you don't understand. This is not natural cold front. This is cold enough to kill. Never heard the line of that before. Somebody get their brain radiated from sitting in front of the computer all day. Harold. Besides, it would be all over the TV. They'd tell us about it. - They do not know what Jack knows. - Well, I'm telling you, cold front can kill. Dad, we need to trust him. - Jack? - Naomi is with me. - I'm okay mom - Hi. Listen, I underestimate how quickly this cold front is moving in. Where are you? At mom and dad's. We're gonna some supplies and meet you at the lab. You and your folks stay put. You won't make it over in time. Are you and Naomi gonna be okay? Yeah, we'll be fine. We're heading to the lab, right now. Jack, how long this's gonna last? I don't know, Em. The thing's gonna get worse before it gets better. So, hunger down. Start plaster the heat. Gather firewood, anything that burns. And warm clothing. We will. - I'll see you soon, sweetie. Okay? - Bye, Mom. - Are we going to the lab? - No. Jack said, we should stay here. It's moving too quickly. Sir, Brent Durrant has an emergency response on line 1. Barker here. A cold front hits Tasmania. The temperature is measuring well below 80 Fahrenheit. - When did this happen? - Just moments ago. Okay. Thanks for keeping me informed. Listen up, everyone! The cold front we've been monitoring has hit. The temperature is far below freezing. We're implementing emergency protocol. For severe weather in Tasmania. Effective immediately. Contact all TV and radio stations. Warning bulletin is going out in one minute. - Should we go national. - Yes. And I want starcast in every city and town across Australia. To the minute. We might have a disaster on our hands. We interrupt our regular programming to bing this emergency broadcast. An unexpected cold front has hit the southern coast of Tasmania. In approximately two hours, it will reach the city of Hobart. - Expect freezing temperatures. - Freezing temperatures? It's freaking spring! . Preferably whether is a wood stove or a fireplace. Have warm clothing at hand. Please, listen to emergency radio station 051. For regular updates on weather and traffic conditions. Stay calm and stay tune. Please, the cold front is not apoclypse. You shouldn't get to pay. Excuse me. It's confirmed. The cold front hit Tasmania at minus 100 degress Fahrenheit So, that's what killed the crew. There's no doubt. It starts with a proto super cool ice fog. and then envelops its surroundings. That explains how their flesh was frozen. God, that's unbelievable. Okay. Let's get a meeting together with John and Michael and Christine and figure it out how to reverse this. I highly recommend you include Jack in the committee. He understands what's going on. Look, I don't want to involve him just now. He'll complicate everything. We have his data. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Come on. Let's go. Thank you, John. Jack, the downloading of the data is completed. But, the military satellite paint up in space. found the ozone rift, got exact coordinates, and temperature reading, proving that the mesosphere is veining the cold front. Good. Transfer the data to the ICRO, and NOAA and Emergency Response. We'll do. How are you holding up? Lonely. They all left when they announced the state of emergency. That was not what I'm asking, Zoe. I'm fine. That's good. Because, we'll be there soon. I hope you're not taking the scenic road. Cold front is speeding at in about an hour. One of more reasons to crank the thermostat. The hotter the better. There should be couple jackets in the lockers and few blankets in the back room. - We need those too. - I'm on it. Wait for me, Jenny. Jenny, wait for me. - Let's move. - Look out. Christine, quickly! Sarah! Sarah Barron! - I'm scared. - Yeah. Me too. - You are? - Oh, yeah. Damn it! Insulin . - Go down into the gymnasium! - This way, this way. Reporting from Tasmania's weather bureau, Hobart has just been hit by extremely cold air mass. Emergency helters are open to receive people who do not have protective shelter. The cold front has the leading edge of deadly ice fog. Ladies and gentlemen, this is captain speaking. We've begun our descent into Hobart. Echo 514, this is Hobart tower. We have dangerous weather conditions. Hobart, repeat it. Repeat last weather condition. - We have dangerous weather conditions. - Hobart, flight control is not working. We're coming in. The weather office cannot predict how long this deep freeze will last. Officials are advising all residents. - Mom! It's getting really cold! - Not now, I'm on the phone. - Mom, weather service said we should go to the gymnasium. - Gary, I'm on the phone. I got to go. Mom, we gotta go! Mom, hurry. Oh, my god! Mom! Hurry! We have just recived word that an airliner has just crashed in Hobart. Authorities are speculating that the hazard ice fog that sweeping across Tasmania is the probable cause. The Parliament has convened the emergency session to address the crisis. The Prime Minister has mobolized the military to assist in the emergency measures. All military personnels have been called back to their bases to aid in the aid effort. Listen. When we pull in, we have to move fast. You got it? Got it. Hurry! Run! Zoe? Jack! Naomi! Thank god you made it. It's hitting us now. Are we prepared? As much as we can be. Dad, is the power gonna go out? No. Generator is just suggesting the dropping in temperature. As long as it keeps running, we'll stay warm. This is insane! The ice fog is minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit. In the morning, it will be half of that. Balming minus 45. It's not funny. It wasn't meant to be. Jack! Are you and Naomi okay? Yes, we're fine. We're at the lab. Hobart has been hit. People are dying. I know. Listen to me. Whatever you do, do not go outside. It's gonna hit you any minute now. Dad, can I talk to her? Mom, it's me. I'm so scared. Naomi, listen. Everything's gonna be okay. - Naomi? - Mom? - Mom? - Naomi? Hello? Cell tower is down. I lost her. Listen! Let me in! - There is somebody out there. - Oh, dear lord. - Help! Let me in! - Close the door! Let's get her in front of the fire. You'll be fine. I can not feel . - Can't feel . - Shhh! You're in shocked. Where is my brother? - He's . - I'm sorry. You're alone. He got. He got lost . in the fog. Listen. I'm sure he found shelter with someone. My parents told me to look after him. It's okay. It's okay. Where is my pill? It's okay. We got them. This is heart medication. The shock in her system could kill her. It's not right. Should have more warnings. Sir, we just plug in to Hobart's traffic camera systems. These are live. It's ice age. Sir, you got an incoming video call. - Brent, what's going on? - We've tried, but there's no time. Where are you? We hold up at the center with about 300 locals. 30 have severe frost burn. We're lucky, our generator is still working. Did you set up shelter? Yes. We use school gymnasium and community centers and few more. But not all of them have generators. Casualties? Oh, this is happening so damn fast. - Brent, how many are dead, any idea? - I do not know. I think is high. - Dad, when it's gonna stop? - I don't think it will. Not, unless we can stop the mesosphere air from feeding the cold front. The only way to do that is to close the rift. Zoe, send me the rest of MPA signature. Sending . Last Thursday, Alex recorded mesosphere discharges in the same sector of rift. Checking the electromagnetic radiation levels. Discharges are consistent enough to work as ignitor. This could work. Hello. Walter, it's Jack. I think I know how to close the rift. I'm gonna need ICRO's support. Yeah, Jack. We're on it. You need to focus on keeping your family and you safe. What are you gonna do? We're gonna close the rift by releasing 300 weather balloons carrying magnesium particles under the ozone layer. The high altitude jets will ignite the phosphor material with their air-to-air missiles. The resulting explosions will ionize the ozone, repair the rift, stop the cold front and its threads. It's a joint U.S.-Australian operation, effective immediately. Walter, it's not gonna work. The only way to close the rift is to work with nature, not against it. Well, the best of the best scientific minds can't be all wrong, Jack. They're wrong, Walter. Trust me. Instead of attacking the problem from bottum up, though artificial means, we need to attack from top down. Stimulate the mesosphere, so nature creates the ozone through lightning. You're out of the loop, Jack. Just send me your data. I'll have a look at it. It's been approved. It's a mistake, Walter. Look, I got to go. What are we gonna do? We go ahead with our simulation without ICRO's support. Walter isn't exactly the biggest fan, is he? See, he's gonna get a lot of people killed. The resulting explosions will ionize the air. Creating more ozone, repair the rift and stop the cold front. Now, I will be heading up the U.S. operation along with General Stratton. And we understand that one of your bases in Queensland has an atmosphere exitor with large supply of weather balloons on hand. Yeah, that's right. Good. Well, make sure they're operational. We will be coordinating there the deployment through your department. Our office will give you the targeting and payload information shortly. Zoe, how's going? Fine. Other than I haven't slept in 24 hours. Jack! What? I did a search on the ozone rift based on the status signature. Look! Three more ozone rifts. What's happening? It looks like the first rift creates ripples across the ozone layer, triggering further rifts. And it gets worse. New recipe to be making more ripples. Sir! A severe cold front has formed over Tokyo. Tokyo? There's no way that's conected to our rift. It's not. SAT reports are flooding in. New ozone rifts had been identified. One over Japan. Three more confirmations. Oh, my god! They're above Russia, England and China. Damn it! I am worried about them. Oh, honey. There's always hope. Jack's smart. He's survivor. I know he's smart. He's brilliant. And idealistic, and self-centered and messing his own health. If anyone can save Naomi, it's him, right? Is anybody there? Over. Who am I talking to? Over. Drew Wilson. Who am I talking to? Over. Harold Stuart. Where are you calling from, Drew? Sounds just like kid. Bar Harbor, Maine, United States of America. Where are you? Over. I'm calling from Hobart, Australia. And we got a problem. Australia? It's freezing in your country. People and animals are dying everywhere. Over. I know, son. If you got a Television or a radio handy, I want you to turn on the national news and let me listen. I need to know what's going on down here. Over. What's happened? Did we lose him? No, I don't think so. We have just received an update. Weather crisis has gone global. Parts of Europe and Asia are now affected. Here in the U.S., Federal agencies have also declared the state of emergency. As the cold fronts can hit our shores at any time. I got to go tell my mom. Kid? Are you there? Damn it. Your mother can wait. This is important! Kid? Are you there? Pete, get me Walter Winslaw in Philadelphia! Yes, sir. How's Tokyo? Official said, in the thousands. Walter Winslaw, line one. Walter. We have the weather balloons. They're rigged and ready for magnesium distributions. This is great news. What launch site did you pick? At any air force base. With four currents and eight currents, we'll be 90 percent on target. - So we are on track? - Yes, we are. Walter, what about the other rifts? Well, the ICRO is coordinating with twelve other countries. If we pull this off, they'll do the same. So, thank your people for me. Bye. Great work. Sit down, please, everybody! It's okay. We are safe in this building. I guarantee you that. We have generators as our heating. Please. There are a lot of people rely on us to do our jobs. We're the last line of defense, people. Okay, people. Launch is in an hour. Let's get to it. I still think, we should have Jack onboard. Look, the simulations show an 85 percent success rate. We have no backup plan. Even if the simulations are accurate, there's still a 15 percent chance of failure. Jack can give us the backup plan. He's been working on it. How do you know? He told me. I've been sending him our data. Look, it's a dead issue, Tammy. Let's just concentrate on the job at hand! - Pete, what's the latest? - Six new confirmed cold fronts. Whereas a mighty 20 percent of the planet is now affected. The only good news is that our launch areas are free of ice fog. Move it, move it, move it. What the hell is down here? James? What's happening? Getting there. Still got ten balloons to prepare. I want the status report every ten minutes. You got it? Copy that. Flight control. Bravo 203 and 207 prep for launch. Sir, we're detecting a cold front. Sixty kilometers from USS Adams. How is that possible? A new rift must have opened. We've never seen one moving this fast before. It picked up the west wind drift and it's picking up speed. The latest Brent said, it's a bank of ice fog. - Temperature? - Minus 19 and falling. Get the USS Adams to the launch. Launch just didn't get any more. How long to the reach time there? Based on the current location, approximately 45 minutes. So, balloons can take an hour to reach the delivery altitude. James, launch those balloons now. We have an emergency situation with USS Adams. Copy that. Start the 15-minute pre-launch sequence. We don't have time. Launch! Launch! Launch all units! Repeat, launch all units! All the balloon units are away. Over. All balloon flight conditions are optimal. They've reached the polar jet stream. - Anything on Winslaw's launch? - Nothing. Every government in the world knows what's happening, but, typically, Joe citizens are the last to know. How goes the simulation? Calculating the blast radius, based on magnesium cloud dispurses. Switch to ammonium nitrate. More bang, less weight. We're tracking inbound weather disturbance. 200 yards eastern. Launch catapult one and two. Deck crews to shelter. Jack here. It's Tammy. They had to move up the launch. The cold front hit the aircraft carrier. - Did the jets make it? - Yeah, they airborned. But we lost all communications with USS Adams. Jack, I'm really worried this mission might fail. Tammy, is there any way we can monitor the mission's progress? Yeah, I'll send you a link. - They'll patch you to military feed. - Thanks. I owe you one. Hey, what a friend's for. Status of the balloons? Better than expected. Should be in mine in two minutes. Air Double reporting that balloons have reached the target position and altitude. Bravo leader, what is your status? 47 seconds to maximum altitude. Arming missile warheads. This is Bravo leader. We have reach the maximum firing altitude. Bravo 203, you are go for missile launch. Roger. Firing missiles. Missiles, away. Tracking outbound missiles climbing to target. Missiles, 16 miles to target. Missiles, 10 miles to target. Missles, 80 seconds to target. Releasing magnesium payload from high altitude balloons. Magnesium payload dispersing in target area. Missiles 30 seconds away from proximity detonation. Make it happen. Make it happen. Missiles,15 seconds to target. 5 seconds to detonation. - I am really worried about mom - Yeah, me too. - It's funny because you don't look like it. - Where did that come from? Well, you don't talk about her and you're not doing anything to contact her. Sweetheart, that's because we're stuck here. And there's job that needs to be done. I can't focus on something I can't control. Yeah. Well, the world is freezing, Dad. - And mom is probably already dead! - Don't do that. You can't think like that. Sweetheart, I want you to know right now I love you more than anything. And we're gonna get through this. You and me, your mom and the rest of the world. How? It's hopeless. 300 weather balloons delivered magnesium into the rift. It should create enough ozone to seal the rift. I am hopeful. I am very hopeful that Winslaw's plan would work. Magnesium should be taking an effect. The rift should be closing by now. - What's the status of the rift? - Latest status is coming in now. The ozone level has increased by 6.7 percent. The rift itself has only shrunk 14 percent. This is Walter Winslaw. The detonation has had a little affect on the ozone rift. It appears, the dispersal may be too wide. It failed. We're still unable to contact the USS Adams. But,.. We will be discussing our next course of action shortly. In the meantime. continue your emergency measures and safeguard your population. Winslaw out. Damn it, Walter. - It's up to you now, isn't it? - Looks like it. What's delivery system that you need for this? Have two rockets with the ammonium nitrate. Ammonium nitrate? Unlike the balloons, we allow the natural lightning activities in mesosphere to ignite the ammonium nitrate cloud above the ozone rift. There's enough cause of lightning activities to create a chain reaction. Basically, we're using nature to heal itself. - That's it? - That's it. If the rift closed, we cut off the mesosphere air feeding the cold front. Cold front dies. - This might be our last chance. - I know. I suspect in the next little while, the effects of the cold front will be irreversible. You should have been onboard from the beginning, Jack. It was a road call. Walter, it's not an issue. Okay. I'll contact Stratton and get him to work out the stagistic for the rockets. In the meantime,. Get us the target and payload calculations as quickly as you can. Good luck. Let's finish our work. Are you sure? I just spoke to my wife two days ago. Maybe, the cruise ship changed its route. Cold front could miss them. No. It's clear that ship was hit by the ice fog. They sent us a distress call before the signal was cut off. - No, I. I understand. - I am sorry, sir. - Something we can do for you? - No, I . No, I'm fine. - Thank you. - Goodbye, sir. - Are you okay, Zoe? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just feel like under the weather. Discharges are consistent enough to seal the rift. Final calculation should be ready soon. - Zoe! - Zoe! - What's wrong with her? - Ah. She's diabetic. Zoe! - Where's your insulin? - I ran out. - Last injection . Two days ago. - Two days ago? I didn't think we would be camping here this long. - I can go to town. - But, the calculations? The computer is finishing the simulation. There's nothing more we can do. - I have to go. - Dad, it's too cold outside. It's only minus 50. If I can get the engine start, then I'll be fine. Dad, please be careful! Whatever you do, do not let her fall to sleep. She can go into a coma. - Okay. - I'll be back as soon as I can. Zoe, stay with me. What's the launch status, General? We have rockets ready under and waiting for payload data. We're launching our first strike from the Vandenberg base in California. We're also coordinating with NATO for the follow up. Here, drink this. Hello? Who is this? - Naomi Tate. - Jack's daughter? Yeah. Where's your father? He was working on some important calculations for me. He's getting Zoe's insulin. She's dying. Look, a lot more people are gonna be dying if I don't have those calculations. You know where they are? I think the computer was building something when he left. Mr. Winslaw, I think the simulation is completed. Can you upload them for me? I think we should wait. He can be back any minute. Naomi, listen to me now. I need those calculations. We can't wait for your father. Rifts are opened up over the U.S.. Now, if it hits the launch site, it's too late. Did you key in the upload site? - Yeah. I just drag all the files in. - Good girl. Okay. I think the data is uploading now. No, no, no! Naomi! - Transpassing. - I'm sorry. I just. I need medicin. You're gonna ransack my shop. No, please. Don't hurt me. I'm not gonna hurt you. I just need some insulin. - A woman is dying. - We're all dying. The world is dying. Why did God let this happen to us? God didn't do this. We did it to ourselves. We polluted our atmosphere. Zoe, stay focus. Don't worry. Dad will come. - He's good man. - Yes. He loves your mom. And he comes for you. Zoe! Zoe! Stay with me. Zoe! You have pretty hair. My daughter has pretty hair too. Her name is Naomi. She's about your age. She's 16. Going on 30. She's dead. Sorry, darling. Another rift's just opened. Soon, the launch site will be compromised. Has anyone managed to get Jack's lab back online? No. What's going on over there? - Dad! - What happened? The generator went down. It's freezing in here. It is. Please, tell me the simulation finished. It did. Winslaw called and I tried to upload the data, but the power went out. - She's gonna be okay? - I hope so. Were they ready to launch? Winslaw was really afraid. He said the launch path can be hit at any moment. Okay. I'm gonna get the generator going. Hey! Hey. Stay with her. Reboot the computer when the power is coming back on. The rockets are fueled and we need to initiate the pre-launch. Where are the targetting calculations? I got a stress. Our launch area can be hit at any moment. I understand General. I'll have the information within an hour. We don't have an hour. My boys tell me we barely have 40 minutes. If we don't the data now, it's doomsday. - You did it! - Let's see if the data is there. Good. We haven't lost the data. Sending. Okay. Jack's calculations are coming in now. Get them to Stratton immediately. I'm on it. TD command confirmed launch of ICBM's. Flight parameters, normal. Birds, on track. 38 minutes to target. 1800 miles to target. Detonation in seven minutes. 700 miles to target. 50 miles to target. Detonation in 24 seconds. 15 seconds to detonation. Initiating payload seperation. Eight, seven, six Five, four, three Two, one . - Detonation has been confirmed. - Is it working? We'll know soon enough. We have just received the confirmation that the U.S. and Australia forces Have detonated three rockets above part of southern Australia. If the mission is success, it will close the rift there. The rift should be closing by now. We're receiving the latest SAT data. The ozone levels have jumped 80 percent! - 80 percent. - We did it. Detonation was a complete success. The rift is satrting to close. Nice work, Jack. We did it! I'm sorry about Elizabeth. Yeah . Earlier today other countries successfully launched rockets. closing other ozone rifts, stopping similar crises that have been plaguing the nations. Reports are flooding in from around the globe. It appears the cold fronts have been halted. You hear that? All reports became maintenance to keep catastrophic freeze from threatening the world. Mom! Naomi, baby! Oh! Oh, sweetie! Might take a little longer for me to clean my act up. My contract requires I give two weeks notice before I resign. I can give you two weeks. In fact, I can give you three. Or four. Or . Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player - All eyes are up. - Sat cams are good. Target is inbound. ETA five minutes. Mission is a go. Repeat, you are green to go. Intercept and apprehend the Heinrich brothers. Secure the device. And remember, this mission is covert. I've got some action. - Hi, my name is Xenia. - Pleased to meet you. I'm Tuck. FDR. So what brings you to Hong Kong? - Business or pleasure? - Pleasure. - Business. - A little of both. What kind of business? I am a cruise ship captain of a very large vessel. My small friend here is a kick-ass travel agent. Permission to come aboard, captain? On that note, will you excuse us, ladies, because we do have work to do. - No, we don't. - Yes, we do. Yes, we do. That's a lovely suit. Well, it is Savile Row's finest. I see you brought your baby brother to protect you. What did you say? Let's go, Jonas. Shots fired. Men down. All right. Here we go. Mag. I need a mag. Shoot him. Tuck! Jonas! - Heinrich is not gonna be happy. - I'm more concerned about the boss. Definitely. Hey, you think those girls are still here? Here we go. So the Coretex has minimal damage. There's some calcining around the edges. However, the Tempolite has damage and there's rusting around 300 degrees. So that means the Coretex gets the recommend. See, Em? The best product always wins. - Oh, Lauren. - Yes. I was just wondering if I might skip out a little bit early for the holiday weekend. Jerry's taking me to an alpaca farm. Oh, yeah, of course. It's a holiday. And a weekend. Yeah, so you should do that. - Okay. - Have fun. - You have fun too. - I will. Tuck. FDR. Six men in the morgue. A body in the middle of the street. Yes, but to be fair, we did manage to-- - Shut up. - To-- That's me shutting up, right now. The mission parameters of the Heinrich case were clearly indicated to be covert. Thanks to you two geniuses Heinrich will be seeking revenge for his brother's death. You guys are grounded. - What? - Grounded? And just maybe I'm gonna make it I'm gonna shake it - Hey, Lauren. Lauren. Hey, hey. - Oh, oh! Hi, Steve, hey. - Hey. - It's Steve. Yeah. Oh, my-- I'm so sorry. Uh, Lauren, this is Kelly. - Hi. - Hi. - It's very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, yeah. - Wow, ha, ha, what a big rock. - Yeah. My fiancee, yes. Yeah. - You are engaged? - Yeah. To be married. Things just worked out exactly how they're supposed to, didn't they? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Looks cool. Okay, well, you know what? I'm gonna go because I'm gonna go meet my guy, Ken. - Huh. - Uh, he's a surgeon. - Wow. - So, great, well um, congratulations on your ring and. - Oh, thanks. - .and your life. - .and your bikes and everything. - Yeah. Okay. Well, peace. - See you. - Okay. Bye. I just said "peace." I want to die right now. Sushi for one. Hey, Ken. - The usual? - Yeah. - Long day, huh? - You don't know the half of it. This is too funny. Hysterical. I'm sorry. This must be your boyfriend's seat. Uh, Ken, right? - Oh, yeah. - No. Sushi for one. Yeah. Always for one. Ugh! It was the most humiliating moment ever. Well, because you have to come up with, like, better excuses. You should've been, "l have a fiance too. But he's getting a penile reduction because his penis is so big every time it lands like a poltergeist." Can't think of anything when I see him. I just can't believe I gave up everything for him. It's just, I felt so stupid. I left my friends, my family-- Don't say that, I'm happy you moved here. We have a happy life together. He was my person. He was your person. You know what kind of person he ended up? The person that ends up with a girl that makes out after she eats yellowtail. I like sushi. She seemed really nice. She was really pretty. Well, I don't give a shit about her. I give a shit about you and your love life. I'm going out, dating, meeting guys. Oh, please, you're not-- You date, but you're not taking it seriously. Don't use that brand, it leaves a film. That one's much more effective. I wish you would act like that with men. You can choose a laundry detergent, but you can't choose a guy you want-- That's my job. It's easier. There's charts, there's numbers. That's why you start online dating. They have lots of charts. - Not that again. - What is your problem with online? What's my problem? Do you watch Dateline? How many creeps are out there? I could end up a skin suit or in somebody's trunk. Uh, that's a little dramatic, okay? That happens to, like, one in 20 girls. You're not gonna end up in a trunk. If you're lucky somebody will end up in your trunk. That's your trunk. Ha, ha. Stop. You need to get back out there, okay? Yeah, sure, you might make a mistake and end up with the wrong guy but you might end up meeting the right guy. So isn't that worth it? What is the worst thing that could happen? Skin suit. Skin suit's pretty bad. Thank you for having me to your nana's. Are you kidding me? You're my best friend. We're family. Oh, my God. - This is gluten-free. Try a taste. - Hm? Why the heck are you two sitting over here all by yourselves? You're not gonna make me any great-grandbabies this way. It is a family gathering, Nana. I don't think you want us making any great-grandbabies. To be fair, I have already provided you with a wonderful great-grandchild. Yeah, but that doesn't count because you screwed it all up. - Ouch. - Come on, Lil. Let's show these kids how it's done, huh? - Heh, heh. See? - Ciao. It's kind of gross when they kiss. God, I love that kid. What's going on? Hey, Mr. Deep-ln-Thought. You wanna talk about it? I was just-- That kind of thing's lovely, isn't it? - It's really lovely. - What's lovely?

I got creamed. No, you didn't, that's just a matter of opinion. What do you know about fighting? You're just a travel agent. I know enough to know that he who hesitates-- Pain?

And I'm gonna bring the binoculars, the hand cream keep a hundred-yard radius. It'll be sweet stuff. No, you can't bring the binoculars. You're not watching my date. I need a little privacy. I'll be around the corner on ringtone. I'll be at the video store. One ring means you need an extraction, two, a cleaner, three, I can get home. - Two hundred yards. - Sold. Tuck? Are you Tuck? Hi. I'm Lauren. Oh, my gosh. Hello. How are you? Very nice to meet you. You too. Um.. Please, sit. Please, sorry. Yeah. Wow, it's like-- You are really, really beautiful. Could you say that a few more times, because your voice is amazing. Ha, ha. I feel like I need to apologize again for that bizarre profile. - No, no, no. - My friend, Trish, is.. Oh, no. Everybody should have a friend who's a spaz. - I think I'm going to have to kill her. - Well, actually. - .I might be able to help you. - I'm kidding. - So am l. - Love is the only thing that can save this poor creature. And I am going to convince him that he is loved even at the cost of my own life. No matter what you hear in there, no matter how cruelly I beg you. - .no matter how terribly I may scream. - Hi. FRANKENSTElN:. do not open this door or you will undo everything I've worked for. Good for you, pal. So tell me one thing that's not on your profile. Um.. I have a son. - Oh, you do? - Yeah. He's called Joe. He's 7 and he's really lovely. Really lovely. And his mom? Couldn't work. How about you? - No kids that I know of. - Okay. And no ex-wives. - I have a very important question to ask. - Good. Go on. Have you ever been or do you ever plan on being a serial killer? Well, I mean, it's-- You gotta keep your options open. - But, no. - Okay, good answer. Ha-ha-ha. So you've never killed anybody with your bare hands. Not this week. Great. - Lauren, you're incredible. - You're not so bad yourself. All right, I'm gonna go and rent a movie and take a cold shower. - I will too. - Okay. - And wait for your call for the next-- - Five minutes? This is where it all started. Yes, I was standing over there by that desk. No, you were sitting in the chair. And suddenly, you started walking toward me. Very slowly. Very slowly. I could count every step. And when you're walking towards me very slowly I thought, "What's the matter with him? Can't he walk faster?" - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Oh, I'm sorry. You take it. - No, no, no, that's okay. You take it. - Sure? You're not gonna like it. Twist ending. You'll see it coming a mile away. - And how would you know what I like? - I know movies. And women. - Really? - Mm-hm. Okay. Well, then, why don't you tell me what I want? - The Lady Vanishes? Why is that? - Mm-hm. Well, firstly, you can never go wrong with Hitchcock. Ever. It's got comedy, drama, romance, it's a thriller. It's classy, but not stuffy. A little obscure, so if you haven't seen it, you'll thank me for introducing you to it. If you have, you'll know what a good choice it was. - Well, I have seen it. - Mm-hm. - And it is a really good choice. - Mm. However, not as good as Rebecca, Notorious, Vertigo or pretty much any of his films from 1960 to 1972. In fact, it's sort of a second-tier title. A second. - You know what? Scratch-- - Look, I see you surveying the prospects. That one over there in Foreign? Too much angst. This one in the sweater set, picking out animated movies? That girl will have your children named before breakfast. The problem is, no one looks like a clean getaway. I get it. You come in here looking for a girl renting a movie. Clearly, she doesn't have a date for the night. We're easy targets. You look like the guy interested in a one-day rental if you know what I mean. If you knew anything about women or anything about me, I'm perfectly capable of choosing my own movies. But thanks. Happy hunting. Hm. So, sir, you want me to hack into a video store database? - It's for the Heinrich case. - Searching database. All right, keep on scrolling. Wait. Stop. Scroll back. That's her. Sir, how is this girl connected to Heinrich? That's G-4 classified. Hello, everybody, I'm Lauren Scott. Thank you so much for being here today. Good morning, Lauren. We're here today to talk about grills. Does anybody have any first impressions? I like the rotisserie feature. Perfect. That's very helpful. I don't think it heated up fast enough. Like something was wrong with the motor, maybe the spark was dead. Actually, sir, there's nothing wrong with the spark. Some people think grills just burst into flames at the slightest touch. It doesn't work like that. Does anybody have any useful opinions? - I thought the lid was hard to handle. - Mm-hm. Ugh. The lids, what a pain, right? I just felt the whole thing to be a bit stiff, uptight, not really user-friendly. - I think it depends on the user. - Mm. It so happens I have a lot of experience with grills. I'm something of a grill master. Uh, this is a sophisticated grill. Not sure you've dealt with one of those before. Or maybe a grill like this is just so scared of being burned it stays on simmer and never really heats up all the way. - Don't touch my grill. - I don't think this can handle a guy like me. - I think it could. - Really? - Easily. - Prove it. 8 p.m. Barcelona. Tomorrow. I don't think so. I guess I could stick around a little longer, talk about grills. Charcoal or gas, number 19, what do you think? If I say yes, will you leave? This is my job. - Eight p.m. tomorrow. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. You smell nice. Bye. What were you doing on the computer? Porn? - I have a photograph of my girl. - I was doing the same thing. - A background check. - I don't know if that's creepy or romantic. "Cromantic." I do it all the time. Wanna see? - Yeah, sure. Wanna see her? - Yeah. I bet yours has got antlers and howls. She does, but she's incredibly attractive with them. - She's a 10. - Go on three. One, two, three and go? All right. - Okay. I'll sound off. - Okay. - One. - One. .two, three. - That's, uh, Lauren S-- - Lauren? Lauren Scott? Scott. - That's the girl from the video store? - Right around the corner from the bar. Oh, wow. Um.. - I had no idea. - Of course. How could you know that? Did she, ahem, actually say she wanted to go out on a date with you, though? You know what? I'm gonna make this really easy. I'm gonna bow out. You date her. Hang on. Did she say she wanted to go out with you? It doesn't matter. I love you. You're my best friend. - Yeah. - You go date her. Yeah, if I got in the picture, it wouldn't be fair. Well, I'm sorry. What does that mean? - What does that mean? - I mean, come on, man you're not out there as much as I am. And like anything. - .practice makes, uh.. - Perfect? - No, no, no. - You're perfect? Maybe not perfect, but damn near close. Wow. - .to perfect. - You believe that as well? - You don't have to bow out because of me. - I don't? I'm not concerned that she's gonna fall in love with you, pal. - How very nice of you. Thank you. - You are welcome. So do your thing. Whatever that is. And, um just let her decide. - Sure. - Yeah. Yeah. While we're at it, why don't we put ground rules in? - We should. - One, I don't think. - .we should tell we know each other. - Two, stay out of each other's way. Three. Yeah. No hanky-panky, no hanky-panky. God, you have not dated in a long time, have you? And if this ever starts to affect our friendship. - Which it won't. - .which it won't. - .then we walk away. - Done. - So, then, we have-- We have-- - We have a gentleman's agreement. - A gentleman's agreement. We do. - May the best man win. The best man for her. - For her. - For the lady. For the lady, for her, the best man for her. Oh! Uh.. Forgive me, sir. You startled me. I understand you're Savile Row's finest. We do our best, sir. In that case, I'd like to have a suit in this fabric. Ah, South American vicuna. An excellent choice indeed. One thing with my suits, I like to know they are one of a kind. I wouldn't want anyone wearing the same suit. - I'm sure you understand that. - Of course, sir. With this fabric and color I only made one other, and that was for a gentleman who lives quite far away. How far exactly? Los Angeles. Have you any reason to go there soon? I do now. Hello.

I was a gymnast in high school, my best event was the keg stand. - You're a gymnast? - Unbelievable. It's valid. You said you were a gymnast, I asked a question. That's exactly why I'm walking away. Because you're uptight and don't know how to have good time? You have the emotional intelligence of a 15-year-old boy.

And then six months later, I found him in bed with a Pilates instructor. He's just not the guy I thought he was. - I made a mistake. - I don't believe in mistakes. Well, that's a very convenient philosophy for someone like yourself. It's the mistakes that make us who we are. They led you here, right? Would you rather be back in Atlanta right now?

Trish then called the babysitter and told her it was an emergency. This is serious. This is really serious. Can't believe this is my problem. Last month, I was dating Boggle. This month, two gorgeous guys. I need you to stop making references to Boggle like a man. It's a game. And you sound like a woman who has nine cats and knits her ass off. You never said gorgeous. You said good-looking. There's a difference-- - Wanna see a picture of them? - Yes. - Okay. - I didn't know you had pictures. Give it. Oh. Wow. - Right? - That's dirty sex. You know you're gonna have dirty sex and it's gonna stink. Not like sex. I mean, like, man stink, the good stuff. That's pretty impressive. For you, yeah. What does the other one look like? You just scroll over, you do the finger thing. Oh, my God. He is hot too. I am impressed with you. - This is hotness. That man is- - You scared the shit out of me. - You all right? - Yup. - Medically speaking? - Fine. - They're people, not products. - You're not a very good liar, know that? - Oh, yes, and you are. - They never play this game with me. Seeing as we're both here, we might as well share resources. - Incredible guys. - I don't have a choice. - Please, sit down. - Oh, I'm staying. Okay, good, good. Well, I'm available as a friend. If you want me to have sex with both of those guys just to test out stuff and see who comes back a winner and who doesn't. They wouldn't know. I'd pretend I was you. I'd put my hair up in a pony. Obviously I'm busy, because I'm a mother, but I would carve out time in my schedule. That's the kind of friend I am. - Why is she listening to that old man? - I have no idea. - Okay. You know what? That's not helpful. - Okay, fine. Do one of your "focus groups" you do at work. You can be the focus group, I can be in charge, like you. - Oh, that's actually a good idea. - Okay. This is good, I like this. Okay, so I will ask you questions about the products. - Okay. - The people. And you tell me who you like and why. I don't know. They're both incredible. What a struggle. I have to go home and clean tartar sauce out of Bob's beard right now. Probably one of his testicles. You're gonna talk to me about how amazing these guys are. - ls there anything bad about them? - Okay, let me think. Flaws. I think there- There is one thing. FDR has these tiny, like, girl hands. Like little T. rex hands. - Ha! - Oh, gross. Means he's got a Mike and lke for a penis. You know that's not true. You've seen it. You've seen it in Bangladesh, you know that's not true. And Tuck is British. Mm. - What is that supposed to mean? - Doesn't mean anything. That's the same, they're kind of even. So get into decision-making mode. And I need you to do it kind of quickly. It's fun, but I'm not the one having sex. - So I can't be that invested. - Okay. You know what I need? Mm. - A joint. Okay. - No, I need a deadline.

But he must trust you. Because you are the first girl he's ever brought here. I have a hard time trusting people too. He had the biggest blue eyes, like marbles. Which almost made up for the bed-wetting. Nana. We really don't have to talk about that right now. - Oh, we really do. - No, no, no. - No, we should. - No, no, no. - We ought to. - I know-- He wore that Superman costume everywhere. You wouldn't believe the smell. But how were we to know that he would take it so literally? - The little fellow jumped off the roof. - Oh! I was given misinformation, okay? We all make mistakes. That was one of mine. Yes, but remember, Franklin, there are no mistakes.

As per usual. - Let's not forget, yes, I did find her first. - Yeah, but she fell for me, Tuck. She fell for me. It's not my fault you're always a step behind. If I'm only a step behind, it's because I'm cleaning up after you. Do you know what? I couldn't give a monkey who Lauren chooses between us. But this, what we had.. - Yeah, what? - It's over. I already asked Collins for a transfer. - Lauren. How are you? Are you well? - Hi. Oh, I'm pretty good. - Good. - Are you busy? - No, no, I'm just at work. - What are you doing? Oh, nothing much.

I should have killed you in Kandahar when I had the chance. What? Were you having a laugh, mate? I was the only thing keeping you alive in Kandahar, mate. I was your only friend. Friend? - You two know each other? - Well, Lauren.. - You two know each other? - Yes. What was this? Some sort of bet? Some sort of game?

I, um.. It's good. It's good. I understand. - Okay. - It's good. Does Joe know about this? Um.. No. No, not yet, but I think he will in a minute. All right.

Will you be my best man? - Jump run! - Hey, you're good. I know it's a little awkward with you having slept with her and everything, but.. - Don't worry about it, Lauren didn't even-- - I just think it's poetic justice, right? What is? Well, I've been meaning to tell you this for a while, but I slept with Katie. Once. Long time ago. Before you guys even knew each other. - Slept with my wife? - She wasn't. You didn't know her. - You slept with my wife? - lt was a long time ago, man. I never even slept with Lauren. - What? - I never slept with Lauren! No, I only let you think that, right? Think that, to make you jealous. - You never slept with Lauren? - You slept with my wife!

The two people who were childhood friends coincidentally encountered each other again. And then they died. The two who were supposed to be dead woke up in an apartment in which a black mysterious sphere called GANTZ is placed. In that room which they can't get out of, they received a command from GANTZ. "If you want to go back, go crush this guy." That was. to battle with the aliens who would invade the Earth. An inescapable command. They were then sent to a parallel world and without knowing what was going on, they battled with the aliens. They barely got their victory. What awaited Kurono and the others when they returned to the room was were the remarks that GANTZ gave them for battling. and the total points they got for defeating the aliens. If they get 100 points, they can be released from this world, or revive a beloved person of theirs. It was a frightening reality. They have their life all thrown out of order while being able to return to normal life when day comes. People who were supposed to die. Kurono, who came to terms with reality while battling and Katou, who continued to deny this battle. The tough and painful battle goes on anyway. .and their friends died one by one. And, in the end, while facing the huge Goddess of Mercy, even Katou's life was taken away. When Kurono was about to give in to sadness, Kojima Tae helped him stand on his feet again with her honest feelings. He swore in his heart that he would earn 100 points in order to revive Katou. In a battle that sees no end, he's determined to continue fighting. Let's go! "Thank you for the hard work. I'm Yoshioka." "Tomorrow, the studio has delayed the schedule to an hour later," "so I will come to fetch you at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning." "It's 8 o'clock, so the time's later than the previous schedule by an hour." "That's all for now. Thank you very much." "At 10:29 p.m." The message is over. [Thank you for your hard work last night.] [You got the first key.] [There are four keys leading to the room.] [The next person is this.] [Yamamoto] [Special trait: Intelligence] [Favorite thing: Good students] [5 months ago] You mustn't die!

[Postscript concerning file #1-378930-s] [Unexplained destruction] [Acts of terrorism?] [A 23-year-old woman disappears right in her own house] Confirmed several consecutive new cases where several people go missing. [New developments from the incident involving the disappearance of the victims' bodies in the subway the other day] [Confirmed existence] "GANTZ - Perfect Answer" Translated by yuizaki_libra@livejournal Timed by ianne_xxyl Soon it will be five months since the day the National Museum was collapsed, and yet the cause of the incident still remains unknown. According to the police, there's a possibility that it's an act of terrorism. - Is the burger done? - Yes, coming. I'll take this. Please. - Please help me with the tomatoes. - Thanks. Excuse me. Oh, Kei-chan. - How's your homework? - I'm done. You're not. But it's so interesting, Tae-chan. Hey, Koruhi is written based on Kei-chan, right? I didn't mean that. Are you embarrassed? Yeah. This manga is interesting, right? She can even get the Rookie of the Year award. I'm nowhere near good yet. I have to improve my skills. You're good already. I'm no good yet. There are a lot of better people. I said you're gonna be fine. Ah~ I want to show this to Nii-chan too. He's not coming back yet? Oh, maybe a little more. It's really because of his job, right? Of course. Oi, don't take your time in there. Where is he really? Ayumu-kun's brother. Sorry. I heard from Ayumu-kun that the same thing happened before. That time, his brother was arrested by the police. Katou's not that kind of person. This. The pay for this month. I don't need it, really. Well you see, you don't have to pay for the rents here, right? However, I want you to come to this house for a while more. Of course I will. If I'm not with him, he won't do his homework. Ayumu is good at cooking anyway. Well, I can't deny that. Also. If I come here, I can see Kurono-kun too. Wa-wait. Please don't keep quiet. It was what I'm gonna draw just now. I was thinking of how to put in this particular romantic scene. Well, I have to get going. Eh? I thought you were gonna stay? Ah, someone just called me suddenly. Kojima-san, you can just stay over. Hold on a second. Huh? "The train will be coming to the first line soon." "Since it's dangerous, please stand behind the yellow line." You were chosen too, weren't you? You will not get used to it at first, so feel free to just watch what we do. Kobayashi-san is the same as you. [It's completely up to me how I want to use you people's lives.] I'm sorry for startling you. There's something I want to ask you, so will you give me some of your time? Since you abruptly announced your break from activities, there have been many speculations going around, haven't there? Rumors have it that it could be due to your illness, marriage, pregnancy, or your move to overseas. But I've dug up everything. You're from the media? The motive is unknown but there is an incredible sequence of events that've been happening. People who are supposed to die from accidents have their bodies suddenly vanish from the scene. The day just goes on as if nothing happened. And then, for some reason, that night, there will definitely be some destruction occurring somewhere in Tokyo. Don't you know about this? No. Well then, how about that rumor? The rumor about the black sphere and the room that contains it. You know it, don't you? Then, four. You can ask me four questions. Your aim. Why are you all gathering at this place? We're searching for the black ball. Black ball? If we have it, we can go where we want. You mean the room that contains the black sphere? You know it, huh. Where did you hear about it? I came here today to ask about that. Where is that room? It's not in this reality. What do you mean? You can't to go to that room if it's not necessary. Who are you people? That's the fifth question. Why are you chasing after the same incident as I do? Sixth one. What do you want exactly? If you want to know, investigate this one more person and come back here. Why don't you go somewhere together once in a while? You and Kei-chan. Focus. Why? You two are dating, right? We are not. How come? You confessed to him, right? Until your brother comes back, Kurono-kun. Seems that he can't think of any other thing. But I'm fine. When things calm down, I'll try asking him once. Seriously? Seriously. Ok! Homework. [Total 94 points. 6 points until it's over] It's gonna be soon, huh? Yes. Let me go! Where's the heck is this place? - Where am I? - Please calm down. Speaking of which, who are you people? Who cares about that. I was an office worker. For the last 20 years, I have worked for the company every day. Well, I was dismissed because of a restructure though. I'm a nurse. That's during the day. At night, she's a hostess. You lie about you age, right? This auntie's still popular at this age. Can you believe it? He's women's enemy even during the day. I'm a freeter. Right now, I'm working part-time at a curry shop. It's a small shop, but the food is delicious. I'm a system engineer at this company named Orient. Please contact me if need be. And, how about you? I'm a hairdresser. Kurono-san is really a normal university student? Since. you're really strong and everything. He is, indeed. Why are you so strong? Because there's someone I want to revive. GANTZ. He was one of us before. He fought with us. Kurono-kun wants to revive him. But. not only him. I want to revive everyone who's died here. And then, let us all be released from here and become free together. [Nakamura] [Special trait: Noisy] [Favorite thing: Jogging] [You got the third key] [You got the third key] [You got the third key] [One more left, and you can go back] [The last key is this person.] [Kojima Tae] [Special trait: Weak] [Favorite thing: Kurono-kun] Did you come on time the other day? Hmm? For what? Your part-time job? Part-time.? Oh, yeah I did. Tough, isn't it? It is. There is this person named Suzuki, and for some reason she didn't turn up. That's why the shop didn't have enough people, so they just called me out. What's wrong? Kurono-kun, did something good happen? There's something, right? You can tell? What? What? Well actually, I was gonna tell Ayumu. Katou is gonna come home soon. Eh? He's been contacting you? Hm? Katou asked me to keep it from other people. I see. More importantly, there's some information I want to give Kojima-san. Well, "information" isn't exactly the word. Wanna go to amusement park? Let's go? Just the two of us, once in a while. You mean. that time I confessed to you? That was. I told you it was just at the surge of the moment. Please forget about it. How can I forget it? Hey, let's go. Impossible, impossible. Absolutely impossible. I have acrophobia. I can't handle the ferris wheel or roller coaster at all. Look. You even drew it in your sketchbook, right? The scene at the amusement park? Maybe if you go there, it can become your source to draw manga. Then. There's one condition. What is it? Please start calling me by my first name from now on. Eh? Call me now. Please. Well, that's a little. Maybe now is not the right time. The next time we meet, I'll call you that, ok? I'll definitely call you that when we met at the amusement park. Yes. Definitely. See you. Welcome back, Kei-chan. How are you alive? GANTZ did something? You don't remember? How many people are there? Eight people, including me. Recently, we got three more people. GANTZ. I want to put an end to it. How? You don't know? There's a ball this big. No idea. I'll come again. If you know something, tell me. GANTZ, show me people who've died. What's the matter? Katou was revived. Eh? How come? Well, I don't know about that. But look, he's still in here. What is going on? [Katou] Who. Nii-chan? What? Um. I'm Kojima, Kurono-kun's classmate at the college. Ayumu-kun, come see him. Ayumu-kun? What's so important that you even neglect your younger brother? It's because you have work to do, right? I'm asking you, Nii-chan. Because I have work. Really? Really. Oh, yeah? Should I go back? There are things you can't talk when I'm here, so. I'm taking my leave. I'm glad for you, Ayumu-kun. [Welcome back, Nii-chan] I memorized how to make it when you weren't home. Try it. You're the first person I made it for. This is Kojima. Erm, Ayumu-kun's brother came home earlier. And also, there's something I want to ask. About the amusement park, Ayumu-kun and his brother are coming too. That's why, it won't be a date. I want to see you. Can I go to your workplace right now? [Kojima Tae] [Kojima Tae] Ayukawa Eriko's started to make her move. At Kita, Senzoku. "A new morning has come" "It's a morning of hope" This will repeat many times over. I stopped this after my child was born. I have to get released soon for the sake of my family. What's the matter? [Your lives have been taken away.] [If you want to go back, go crush this guy.] [Alien dressed in black] [Special trait: looking normal at first glance] [Favorite thing: black ball] [Favorite thing: black ball] Let's go. [Please go.] Where's this place? A train? Something is fishy. Hey, you. Have we ever met long before? It moved. It's the subway! What? The subway? Everyone, don't space out. "The train will be departing soon." There are people here. This has never happened before, right? Take care of the front part of the train. Ayukawa Eriko? She's riding the train by herself? Everyone, we are not a suspicious group of people. We are not doing anything to harm you either. What? Is it like an event or something? Kurono-san! Don't shoot! Don't drag others into this! Can you hear people screaming? It smells weird too. What the? What's going on? Isn't this dangerous? Takahashi! You guys are so amazing. Damn it. I remember. I remember! I remember. I've done the same thing before. What? The two who were in the room before, Nakamura-san and Kobayashi-san too. Eh? Stop! It's dangerous here! Out of the way! Come. Kurono Kei. Kurono-kun? Run away from here. Wait. Sorry. Stop it! You're heavy. Move aside. I'm covering for you. She's tough. Yeah. This is revenge. This is revenge. You people were the ones who started this first. You people have killed so many of my friends. I'll never forgive you- Everyone's safe, right? Auntie isn't here. [Well then, let's see the points] Hold on a second. Oi! [Well then, let's see the points] [Takahashi] [0 point. Total 88 points] What the heck is this? Oi. I told you Auntie isn't here. Auntie isn't here! Auntie isn't here! Auntie isn't here! [Good work. You got the first key.] [Kobayashi] [The second key] [Yamamoto] [You got the second key.] "You know it, don't you?" "The black sphere. and the room that contains it." Black sphere? Room? GANTZ! [It totally depends on me how to use your life] [That's on theory.] This is revenge. You people killed my friends. [Sakurai] [0 point. Total 69 points] Auntie's here, isn't she? That's her, right? Is this for real? Isn't that Ayukawa? Ayukawa. Eriko? You finally came, huh? Yes. Seems so. [Well then, let's continue with the points] Everyone, please be careful. This woman. was the one who killed me. Long time no see, Kobayashi-san. Huh? Kobayashi-san, don't you remember this room? You don't remember me? Huh? What? [Kobayashi] [0 point. Totally doesn't remember a thing] Two years ago. I fought while protecting you. [Nakamura] [0 point] Yamamoto, Ayukawa, you, and I. We defeated these aliens dressed in black two years ago in Shibuya. [Yamamoto] [11 points] And then, everyone could stop doing this. We had our memory erased. and were set free. Ah. Yes. So if we get 100 points, we can really be released, huh? [Suzuki] [17 points. Total 101 points] 100 points. "Breaking news. There is an emergency going on currently." "An accident occurred at the subway, causing 84 people to die and 260 people injured." "A group of people bearing weapons were seen on the train." "The cause is also unknown this time." [100 points menu] [1. Erase all your memory and get released] [2. Return the person you love to life] That means you'll be released. Suzuki-san, with this, you'll be a free man. I'll choose the second option. [2. Return the person you love to life] I'm sorry. First of all, let's revive Katou-kun. No. But, he. I was. killed by him. "This is revenge. You people killed my friends." He said that and killed me. That's the same thing as what the girl said earlier. Then. this Katou is? Let's confirm it. GANTZ. Please revive Katou Masaru-kun. Eh? That's it? Kei-chan. Where's the alien? Katou. Katou. Katou! Oi GANTZ. Hurry up! You mustn't die. I'll wait for you. I'll go first and wait for. Kei-chan. What about the alien? What happened to it? Was I. dead? Was I alive? I'm alive, and I can go back. Suzuki-san used his points to revive you. It's nothing. Well, it's been my objective from the beginning to get 100 points and revive Katou-kun. Thank you very much. Thank you very much! Ah, it's nothing. Anyway, with this, we've made it clear, right? Yes. The other guy is an alien. We will avenge you. I have obtained the key to that room. [Kurono] [21 points. Total 115 points] More than 100 points. GANTZ, I choose number 2. [100 points menu] [1. Erase all your memory and get released] [2. Return the person you love to life] [2. Return the person you love to life] The person I want to revive is. Huh? I have you revived. I was dead? Yeah. That's so uncool! Right now, you're important to us. Now, explain to us. Something strange is happening to GANTZ. You guys. Long time no see. You're still doing this, huh? Why are you here? We were summoned by GANTZ. A black ball was sent to my place. Ex-members like us were brought back here. That's not the only thing. There were people who were dragged into the mission and got killed. This has never happened before. Say, what's going on now? How long have I been dead? Five months. It's gathering people because of this? What is it? Oi, spill it. GANTZ runs using battery. Huh? This thing runs using battery? From what I observe, even though this is just a guess. GANTZ moves by sucking his energy. That's why, if this bald-headed guy wakes up, it's also the end of GANTZ. If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us? That is. Right? Extermination. perhaps. We, who were revived by GANTZ will also disappear together with it. What the heck is that? Maybe GANTZ is rushing too. Before its lifetime ends, it wants to defeat all the aliens. That's why it summoned us ex-members here. I see what you mean. So it's like homecoming, huh? Perhaps the archrival still remains. The Last Boss, that is. Don't tell me that is.? Today I met an alien who appeared in the form of your body. Eh? The one who killed me is also that guy. He's an alien. There it goes again. "A new morning has come" "It's a morning of hope" "Open your heart with joy" Today's mission just ended though. "Look up to the blue sky" "Listen to the radio" "Take a deep breath" "And take in the fragrance of the wind" "And then - one, two, three" [Emergency mission] [Go crush this person] [Kojima Tae] [Special trait: Weak] [Favorite thing: Kurono-kun] What the heck? An ordinary girl? Wait, look. Her favorite thing is. What the heck is this? Why is she the target? Shouldn't it be that fake Katou? [People who crushed her will get 100 points.] [The others will have their points taken away.] This girl is. Kojima Tae is not an alien. That's why please don't kill her. Please. She may look like that, but she might actually be an alien. That's not true! The last person who appeared on the black ball was this girl. So that means. she's also an ex-member of the group? No. I've never seen her. Then. she's really an alien? Hang on. Where is that ball now? The one who killed me. So it's with that Katou alien, huh? Isn't that bad? Maybe he already killed Kojima Tae before us. The ones who hold the ball can be transmitted around. Seriously? GANTZ wants to prevent that, right? Anyway if it's GANTZ's order, we just have to do it. If I can get 100 points by killing this one girl, I'll kill Kojima Tae. GANTZ. Transmit me first. Kei-chan. I'll go to Kojima-san. You go to Ayumu's place. Sorry. I'll see you later. Be careful. Wait. You intend to protect her? I want to revive Auntie. That's why I have to gain more points. Stop it! Transmit me quickly. GANTZ! My house? I will explain everything to you later. Right now, let's run away together. Um, what happened in the subway earlier. It didn't make any sense at all. But I believe. I believe you, Kurono-kun. This way! Wasn't that Ayumu-kun's brother? It wasn't him! Urgent! Urgent! Calling headquarters. Found one suspect just now. The suspect is heading towards the north direction. The suspect is a man who possesses a weapon and is chasing after someone else. Quickly send more backups to the subway. "Roger." Found you. Kurono-kun. Let's stop this. If GANTZ dies, everyone will be exterminated. Doing this to another human being is just strange. Though you can kill so many aliens? Suzuki-san. Since I'm thrown into this, before GANTZ comes to an end, I will get 100 points one more time. Nice. Kurono-san. Run away. If you move, we'll shoot. No, you won't. Suzuki-san too! Me too? They're shooting! Please go first. I will block them. Sakurai-kun! They won't get any points killing me. Hurry up! I'll catch up with you later. Thanks. I'll aim at him for real. Let's go. [Katou] Ayumu. Ayumu! Ayumu. Ayumu. Ayumu. Calling headquarters. Right now, the suspect is heading further to the north direction. I'm chasing after him. It's me, Kei-chan. By any chance he is.? Suzuki-san. The two of you, please get as far away from Tokyo as you can. Hurry up! I don't want to go! I want to be with you, Kurono-kun. Tae-chan. I will definitely come pick you up later. Let's go. Let's make sure we go to the amusement park. This way! Don't. get in my way. You came to take revenge? Why did you. have to kill Ayumu? You also killed your father. Give Ayumu back! Someone who killed his father like you can get angry when your brother is killed? Because of those emotions. you killed your father. That was to save Ayumu. It couldn't be helped! It couldn't be helped? That's forever your excuse. You always make that excuse. and run away from everything. Katou! Kei-chan. Please tell me. What's happening to Kurono-kun? It's hard to explain, but. He's fighting to protect you. For. my sake? He might. even die. I'm sorry. My wife passed away. I want to get her back. I have to gain enough points before GANTZ is over. Please run away. If not, I will have to shoot you. Kurono-kun will definitely come to pick you up. It doesn't work on him at all. This way! You're in the way. Move aside! I give up! Let's stop. Let's stop here. Okay? What are you shooting? But. But he- [Kojima Tae] someone saying something the same someone saying something again Oi. Oi! Oi!! You want to know why I killed your brother? This is revenge. You people did the same thing to me. We tasted the same hatred and sorrow. Like me, you people are not fighting for anyone's sake, Nor are you protecting anyone. You're just being controlled by that black sphere. Katou. Kurono-kun! No way. Kurono-kun. I got you. Kurono-kun. Tae-chan. Let's go home. You mustn't. You mustn't die. Kei-chan. Kei-chan. So you're saying that I should keep fighting until forever? That's why, you made Tae-chan your target? You can go to that room using it, right? Hand the ball to me. [Mission cleared.] [Damn it Damn it Damn it] [Someone, crush the alien in this room] In here? Not here. The ones who were supposed to have been killed by the alien earlier are. We finally found you. It is you who wished to start this fight. [Start] I understand now, GANTZ. [Choose] Kei-chan. How about the aliens? I don't think all of them have died. That's great. That's great? Because we have to get more points. What do humans fight for? What do you people fight for? For the sake of my loved ones. When are you gonna keep fighting until? Until. I can revive my wife. Stop it. I have to live. I. People in this world are longing to see me. You're kidding, right? GANTZ. Stop it. Shoot. I can't stop this fight with you people. Shoot! Stop already Let's. stop this. Why? There's no way but to kill him. Kei-chan. [Well then, let's see the points] [Kurono] [Full points] [Please choose from the "full points" menu.] [Full points menu~] [Forever.] Oi! What's next? What is it? GANTZ is over? With this no one will be revived. Neither will us. No. There's still. a way out. Kei-chan. GANTZ has decided already. [Kurono-kun] [Thank you] Kei-chan? What did you do? Everything will end. No one will be summoned here anymore. You've gotta be kidding me! What did you do? Katou. Thank you so much for remembering our childhood together. I was really happy. But from now on, forget about me. How can I forget? How can I forget?? Katou. Take good care of Ayumu. We're going back together! Together! Kei-chan! Kei-chan! Kei-chan! Thank you very much. Wanna buy something? - Yeah, buy me a map. - Okay. - I'll take them. - Oh, thanks. Map, huh? Welcome. Welcome. "Ayukawa Eriko-san returned to the entertainment industry" It's confirmed that all of the members present in your list are existent. Please take some time off for yourself. We will handle the investigation. I saw them. I saw those guys with my own eyes. That room too. I was just so close. I'm made breakfast, so you will do the cleaning. Okay, hurry up. Quickly put the mattress away. Huh? Well, just that. it feels as if I haven't seen you for a long time. You're so strange. I have. always wanted to do this. I won't go anywhere anymore. I know that already, so go to work. Who. gave me this again? "Draw the Ferris wheel here" "To Tae-chan" "I love you. Kurono Kei" Kurono. Kei?

But the 11:50 will get you there by tomorrow morning with plenty of time. Your boarding pass, sir? Sometimes things happen for a reason. Thank you. I should've seen it coming, boss. It came undone. Coming undone in our business means you need a margherita. It doesn't mean capping a dozen people in a government lab and blowing it up. It doesn't mean stealing an object of critical importance. Does he have the zephyr or not? We believe so. Uh, "you believe so". I don't care what you believe, Fitz I need you to clear. - Put it back on. - fix this. I want the Zephyr We'll have it in hand by the time he lands in Boston. Find out who and what she is. Should I just pick her up in Wichita? No. I got a better idea. Miss Havens.

But, I do have a fitting tomorrow so I do actually have to go home. Hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight. It might be. You know, Wichita is a long way to go for a carburetor. It's not just any carburetor. It is a triple deuce. I am restoring a 66 GTO and Kansas has the best scrap. Really? My dad had a garage, and when I was a kid, he bought this chassis. He used to take us to go out and search for parts. He died in '98 and now that April's getting married, I just figured, why not finish it up and give it to her as a wedding present. Kind of like a present from my my dad too, you know? - That's nice - Yea. I used to think that. someday .when the last part went in. I would just climb into that GTO, and start it up Just drive and drive and keep driving until I got to the tip of South America. - Cape Horn - Yea - It is beautiful how it still is - Yes? Pirate Islands. - "Some day" is a dangerous word - Dangerous? It is really just a code for never I think a lot about the things I haven't done Diving the Great Barrier Reef. Ride the Orient Express.

By whom? I did, actually I shot the first pilot and he shot the second pilot accidentally. It's just one of those things. Seriously. that's just great. Really, I'm relieved you're taking this so well. Where are you going? I have to check out things, think about landing Would you mind putting your seat belt on for me? This is weird. - What's happening? - Oh, hello Sit down. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Everybody's dead in here. Oh my god! - Sorry? - We're going down Sure, this is a rapid descent. Please, sit down. - Sorry - Are you a pilot? - Who are you? - Shoulder straps Secure it right down there. Right there. You're done? Here we go now. Why can't we just land at an airport? No, no.

Close, close! God! - This is good - What's good? Take a little sip of that. It'll take the edge off. - Are you shot? - Yea, just a little scrape That's good news. June, we have to discuss what's gonna happen next. You need to go to the hospital, and prison maybe. There's people who'll come looking for you now. Bad people. I feel a little weird Oh yea, that will pass when you fall asleep, which should be a couple of minutes. - What? - I need you to listen, June - Did you drug me? - Yes - You drugged me - Yes, for your own good These bad people who are going to come and see you, they're gonna ask you about me. You need to tell them that you don't know me. June? You need to tell them you don't remember anything and you need to avoid getting into any vehicle with them at all costs. - Wait. Who are them? - Serious people, June. They'll probably identify themselves as federal agents, and they'll DIP you. Dip me? In what? Disinformation Protocol. They'll tell you a story about me, about how I am mentally unstable, paranoid. I'm violent and dangerous and it'll all sound very convincing. I am already convinced. Here's a few common DIP cue words to listen for: Reassuring words. Words like stabilized secure, safe. If they say these words particularly with repetition, - .it means they're going to kill you - Oh, God! .or intern you somewhere offshore for a very long time. Stay with me. - If they say you're safe. - They're gonna kill me - Do not get in what? - Vehicles Any vehicles. You know? Just run. - I'm run - Run And if they ask you about me. I don't know you. I don't know you at all Who are you.? <i>Eat a good breakfast, June</i> <i>.Back to our top news story of the morning.</i> <i>According to the FAA, approximately at 7:30 last night.</i> <i>All passengers died when the aircraft suffered turbulence.</i> <i>The plane was passing through an area of turbulence and may have been affected by.</i> <i>.wind-shear or lightning storm causing an electrical failure.</i> <i>Now this is all pre-conjecture, and all that's left of the plane.</i> I'm coming! Remember, do not tell anyone Rodney? Oh, thank God. I wanted to make sure were all okay. Why? - You were on that flight from Kansas, right? - Yea - I saw on the news about the crash - What news? What crash? - Anyway, you're alive - I'm alive. Yes. June. I told myself that if I found you alive, that. - I was gonna ask you to dinner - How about I call you later, okay? It's just another day. It's just a normal day. She's moving. - Wow. and I gotta love the boots - Yea.. I know I promise I'll wear heels on the day. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yea - So, this weekend. I was thinking about dad's GTO - Really? I was sitting there and I was wondering how you'd feel about maybe selling it. You wanna sell dad's GTO? - Ben and I. We really want our own place - Excuse me Anyone here belong to that blue truck parked outside? Yea, why? You're about to get a ticket. Forget to put enough quarters or something. I hate getting tickets. Oh, excuse me. Please step inside miss. I'll just go grab a few things. Miss Havens, good afternoon. Special Agent Charles Fitzgerald. Will you join us inside the car for a moment? We know you were on the flight with him last night. The one that crashed. Who are you again? FBI. - You do know Mr. Miller - No, I don't Well, we chatted a little bit before we passed through security. I see. And once you were on the plane, What happened then? More chatting? - Is this funny to you? - No He's dangerous Miss. Havens, and out of control. - He said that you'd say he was crazy - So you did talk to him And what about me? No, not you specifically. About whom then. Simon Feck? I don't know who that is. Look this is getting really twisted around and I think I should probably call a lawyer. We're gonna take you to a secure location, until agents can have Mr. Miller contained some place safe. - With you? - Yes, ma'am You wanna tell me where we're going? Fellas? Do not worry, you're safe. - Excuse me? - You're safe with us I wanna know where we're going. It is just a shortcut until the situation is stabilized, to keep you safe. You said that already. Because, I meant it. What is Jackson doing? Shooter, shooter! Get down! Get down! Shooter on the freeway. The dot is on your back. Follow me now! Are you insane? I'm not going out that door. God! - Hey June - I can't see - Get out of the way - Open the door Open the door June. Beautiful dress, by the way. Wait a second. Who are you? What are you doing? - Hey June - What are you doing? Please unlock the door. Unlock the door, that way I can help you. June, door. Just pull over! Oh my god! C'mon over here. You're doing good. Hold this. Well, well, well! Check this out. Nice. These guys load the barrel. You're doing well June. Excellent driving. Beautiful dress Is it for the wedding on Saturday? - Uh-huh - Yea, that'll be nice Please. stop shooting people, okay? I understand, you're in charge. You stay here while I go have a word with the guys in the truck. Okay? - Okay - Okay? Actually I'm just gonna go shoot them, and I'll be right back. By the way, your timing, when you opened that door was sublime. You saved us, I hope you know that. You saved us. Hey, wait! Wait! There you are. June? Rodney? Hey. What are you doing here? Hey guys, say hello to June. - That's some dress - Thanks - Everything all right? - Yes No, it's. It's complicated. You know what? I've been feeling the same way. You wanna talk? Maybe over some pie. My point is. My point is, that plane crash made me think about our breakup. You know this bell went off. Like "Bing" Rodney, why have you given up? You're being passive. Getting back at her because she didn't want the ring. June does not want to be engaged right now and that freaks your mom out. Big deal! What about all the things you and June wanted to do together, huh? Our list, camping in Vermont, with my brother and Sheila Tickets to the Blue Man Group. I wanna talk about the plane crash. Okay? - Sure. What about it? - I was on it I mean in it. I was in. it So you were in the plane crash? I wasn't supposed to be on it, but I was and there was this guy who was. Some sort of like secret agent or something and he. He killed everybody on board and then he landed the plane Next thing you know. I wake up. I'm in my room. I have no idea how I got there. He must've drugged me or something. And then I go to April's wedding cuz I had to wear this ridiculous dress And then these other guys, these other agents come. They snatch me off. Next thing you know, I'm in Grand Theft Auto on the I-93. Why're you touching my hand? Because I'm here for you - Geez, you are so stressed out - Yea And I get it, I completely understand I mean. - Wow, June! - I know. Your little sister is getting married and that is stressful. What are you talking about, Rodney? You didn't even listen to what I was talking about. I would be the same way in this situation. What can I do to help? - We can bring the guys over. - No, no, no, no, no. Christ. Hi June. Look, I'm sorry if I'm interrupt anything but. I'm Roy Miller. Rodney Burst. We're running out of time, and. Maybe I didn't make it clear enough, but we're gonna have to stick together because of our situation In case you didn't notice, Rodney is a fireman so he's perfectly capable of handling any situation that comes up, thank you very much. - You can leave us alone. - I have no doubt. Ever since I was a little kid, I've had a great respect for firemen And the fact of the matter is, I don't think you guys get paid enough - You're an engine tech? - Yea, engine tech. - Have you taken your lieutenant's exam yet? - Yea, we're gonna - How's that going? - It's a bitch Do you have a do a tour of that hall. That's where the action is. - Rodney. - House of flames I've often thought. I. I should've been a fireman What? Is this the guy? Sorry, who are you? I'm the guy? - I'm the guy - This is the guy Rodney whatever happens, please for your own safety - Please stay out of it - What are you talking about? Everybody get down! Everybody get down or I will blow her head off What did I just say? - Rodney what did I say? - Just calm down Sorry, thought you were making a move. It's okay, do not move Pies for everyone! Everybody gets pies, but no ice-cream. We can survive, people. Lincoln knew it. That's why they got to him. No one follows us or I'll kill myself and then her. - Get in the car please - No Watch your head. - 560 Harris. They're getting into a blue Volvo - Rodney! Oh my God! Rodney! It's okay, I shot you through and through. No bone, nowhere near the femoral artery. Okay? It's gonna be better for you to grow bone. It's all good. Okay? You good? Good? I was forced to enter the restaurant, June, because it proves you're my hostage. Which cleared your name, with the locals at least. That is a start. Something to build on. You shot Rodney. Yea, I did. - But I asked him to stay out of it - You shot Rodney Might be the best thing that ever happened to him. Yea, right because we all should get shot every now and then. Rodney is a good guy, June. But not really right for you. In my opinion, but a good guy. He took a bullet. He's gonna be a hero. Probably get a promotion. Stop the car. Stop the car! It's okay. - Stop the car! - I can not I want to leave, stop the car please, now I'm not one of those, "I told you so" kind of guys, but I did warn you to stay off the plane last night. When? When I said that sometimes things happen for a reason. That's not a warning. That's not a warning, Roy. That's an expression or a bumper sticker. Next time try: June, if you get this plane you will fucking die. Maybe they did meant it when they said that I will be safe. Do you really mean that, June? Yea. Did you feel safe with them? Do you think that I do now? Okay. Just so you understand, right now out there on your own, your life expectancy is like zero. With me, it's up here. Without me, here. With me. Without me. I would advise going home, but you know? It's up to you So, right now I need another car to keep moving And someone else depending on me. Someone, whose life is in danger. Someone who trusts me. Every second I waste chasing you, I'm letting him down. <i>Rodney, what was it that you were thinking when you perfomed the heroic action?</i> <i>Well, I didn't think, I just did what any man would do in that situation.</i> <i>- You should be so proud - Thanks</i> <i>It really didn't even hurt, it was kind of like a bee sting.</i> <i>What a brave firefighter.</i> <i>Doctors tell me, Rodney's going to be okay.</i> <i>It's just a flesh wound.</i> <i>A true blue Boston hero. Back to you, Tom.</i> That's what it's all about. That right there is what everybody wants. A Burger King toy? Open it. It's warm. What is it? A battery. A battery? It's code-named Zephyr. I'm not sure, if it's just. It's high output. It never runs out. What do you mean never? That little thing there, is the first perpetual energy source. It's the sun. So what, your flashlight never runs out of juice? It can power a lot more than a flashlight, June. - Really? - Hmm. How much more? A small city or like a submarine. It's big. The guy who invented it, is barely out of high school. Simon Feck. I was assigned with another agent to watch him at a facility lab in Wichita. and the other guy, the agent, is the guy who picked you up this morning. Fitzgerald. A couple of weeks ago I found out that he was going to sell the battery and kill Simon. So I got Simon out of there, you know, some place safe. Went back for the battery and Fitz set me up. He made it look like I went rogue. That's when I met you. So. So what's next? What is the plan? Maybe get some rest. Pick up Simon and get you back to your sister's wedding. I am pretty good at what I do, June. Tonight we're safe. Scout's honor. "Safe and secure?" Good night, Roy. Were you really a boy scout? Eagle Scout. - I was a brown eagle - That's cool Good night, Roy. Pies for everybody. everybody. Everybody gets pies. So, what do you think? Are we looking at another player? We're looking at a pawn. I talked to her and so did he. She owns a garage. No passport. Gone nowhere. Been nowhere. She's a nobody. You've been two steps behind since this began, Fitz. Are you sure someone's not taking you to school? Clean this shit up. Brooklyn, NEW YORK. This is the safe house? Simon! Simon? Stay close. Simon! No time to play. What is all this? Simon. It's what he does. It's kind of late. Please keep guard. Hmm. Made in Austria. Who are these people? Are they Fitzgerald's guys? No, these are other guys Other bad guys? Worse guys. Hold them. Worse guys? Now, June, listen carefully and do exactly as I say. On three, I'm gonna lay down cover and you're going to run to those shells over there, okay? Okay Ready.? One.. Sorry. I panicked. What number would you like? Let's just stick with three. Okay. 1, 2, 3. Good work, thanks Could be Antonio Quintana's men. He is a Spanish arms dealer. He also wants the battery. Ready? Let's move. June, June. What the.? How the hell are we gonna get out of here? Where the hell is Simon? - I don't know, but he left a message. - Message? What I need you to do right now is to wait here What? I'll go find us a way out of here Wait, wait. Stay down. Roy! June. June! June! Please stop saying my name. You keep screaming my name and it is freaking me out. Okay, I understand. - Drink this. - What is that? Brotine-zero. They're gonna smoke us with D5. Where's yours? Shit. Sorry. June. Will you listen to me? We'll be out of here in a couple of minutes. I gotta do something. Alright. We gotta go June. We've been hit! But, it's okay. We get through this, we're home free. Ready. Set. Go! We're almost there. ALPS Hey there, sleepyhead. How long have I been out? 18 hours. Where am I? My place. We're off-grid. No one's ever found me here. It's a shame we can't stay longer. We gotta rendezvous with Simon. He's fine. I figured out his code. He's crazy 'bout trains. He used the password I gave him and went to Austria. You drugged me again, Roy. Yea. You can't do that! You weren't coping well. I'm not sure if you were awake, they would have even let you live. What am I wearing? A bikini. We're in the tropics. How did I get in a bikini? June, I've been trained to dismantle bombs in pitch black with nothing but a safety pin and a Junior mint. I think I could get you into those clothes without looking. I'm not saying that's what I did, but. Sorry. Reflex. Yea, I deserved that. Hit me again. I won't stop you. June? June. June! Pins and Junior mints. "I'm not saying that's what I did." Shit! What is this thing? MOVEMENT ALERT 5826, Amapola. That's a '67 Grand Prix. April! April! I know, I'm ok! I'm ok! I'm ok! Listen, April.. April. April.. April, can you hear me? April. April, can you. I know, I'm ok! I'm ok! I'm ok! What is Miller doing? Who is the girl? We do not know Antonio. We traced her phone to the Azores. We're in range now. Until they contact the agency. Perfect timing. Lunch is ready. You must be thirsty. It's a coconut. it's loaded with electrolytes. Whoa. Ok. OK, just. wow. Yea. You got skills. My dad wanted boys. Let me go! You can get out any time you want. I'll show you. Hands like Houdini. Turn your palms down, and all at once throw your hands to the ground. And your hips back. Nice. That was good. Who are you? Really. I don't understand. Run. I don't understand. I came on a plane. My phone was secure. It's secure. Unless you didn't make a call. No, I didn't make a call. I took a call. You took a call? It was a quick one. I thought we were off the grid, and then my phone rang. It was my sister and I had to take the call. No, I can't get into that. I can't get into that thing. Just put me out. Use Broton 7 or whatever. - It's okay - You're grabbing my neck. You asked me not to drug you. Okay. Hands like Houdini. hands. Roy? Monte Casale, ALPS. I can't feel my face! Hey, it's time. Pull on this traction system. I have control of 50,000 metric tons. This is diesel hydraulic. Don't you want to see your Zephyr? Yes. - Excuse Me. - Tell me lady. Can you tell me where we are? Of course, we are in Austria. Austria. Would you like some breakfast, Miss? Yea, that would be great. Thanks. Okay, I'm gonna have some pancakes. Scrambled eggs and. a glass of milk. Excellent. - A Harvey Wallbanger, please. - Yes, sir. Incoming Call. Unknown Number. You know, statistically you're a lot more likely to die riding on a train than any other form of transportation. 10.3 times more likely than dying on a plane. Simon? Simon Feck? Yes. My name is June, I'm a friend of Roy Miller's. Have you found him yet? Have you seen him? No, not yet. Don't you wanna answer that? Yea. But I can't, I'm not supposed to. It may be Roy. But he told me not to answer the phone, because the signal could be tracked. Oh, that's right. <i>Stay in the room. I'm with Simon.</i> Did Roy happen to tell you why I'm here? Are we supposed to meet him here or.? What did you say that drink was. Harvey.? It's a Harvey Wallbanger. Do you mind ordering me one of those, 'cos it looks great? I'll just be right back. You just stay here for a second, I'll be right back. Something's wrongs. It's getting hotter, Roy. She didn't answer her phone.. I told her not to, which is good news. - I left a note. A Post-it. - Roy, maybe the issue here. This is getting too hot; we need to cool it down. Maybe she went to get something to eat. Good. C'mon. May I help? Yea, I'm feeling a little bit strange. So is it okay if I hang out here for a while? Of couse, I'll go get you some water. Here you go. Antonio Quintana wants to know, where is the battery. Where is the battery? I'm sorry. I'm looking for. Roy. Miller. You know him? I. He's an assasin. platinum grade. - He's trying to find Simon. - Oh my God. And to kill you. Simon? June, Simon. Simon, Jume. I'm okay, I got it. Simon, please move! You have quite some balls. Hands like Houdini! I'm so sorry. But you were trying to kill me. That's disgusting. Oh, my God. Just die! Oh shit. I gotta get you guys some place safe. - He's not on the train. - Oh, really? The cameras at the station show him. He must've gotten off before the train stopped. Always the classics, boy. Salzburg, Austria. Very nice. Yes. No, we just got here. No, we're talking now. No, I understand. No, but it is great to hear your voice too Naomi. I'll meet you at the Caprise as soon as you could be there. It is a beautiful city. Yea. I've never seen anything quite like it. Neither have I. I have to go out for a bit. Okay. I. I was thinking about ordering some room service. Maybe we could have dinner. That sounds great. 9 'o clock? 9 sounds great. June. Could you do me a favor? Just stick around here. that's better. Yeah of course, where else am I gonna go? See you in a minute. They're not gonna hurt you. You are too valuable to them. Just breathe and listen to the music. This is something special for you. I know you like it. Cool! Thanks. Order as much room service as you like, but do not leave the room, - Okay? - Alright I really need to talk to you about the Zephyr later.. And we will. Can I get you something? Red wine please. Right away. You seem different. Do I? So, who's your company? She is beautiful. The blonde. She seems capable. I've just met her. She is a nobody. Someone I picked up on the way. That's a shame. This is getting boring. Are we gonna do the deal or not? Don't speak to me like that. I'll speak to you any way I please, Tony. We both know you're lucky I'm here. I have the battery. I'm on a schedule. The world of is full of bad guys and people are calling. Ask him the price. Alright then. What's your price? I have a figure in mind. What's it worth to you? Are you angry about your island, Roy? Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony. I'm Isabelle George, director of counter espionage at the CIA. I'm sure you are. Forgive me, I just. I just don't know exactly what to believe. That's understandable considering that the last five days you've been fed a steady diet of misinformation and fantasy by an agent of ours who's recently gone rogue. He said that Fitzgerald was the one who wanted to steal the battery. Well, let's examine the facts. Miller told you that he was protecting the Zephyr from people who wanted to misuse it. But now he's trying to sell it to an international arms dealer. Antonio Quintana. One of Europe's leading weapons manufacturers. Ask yourself, Miss Havens. Has Roy Miller said anything to you that's proven to be true? He used you as a mule to carry the battery through security, Miss Havens. He's been playing you. He's a spy. That's what he does. He lies for a living. Any love, empathy. we train that right out of them. What did you imagine? The two of you would move into a condo together? Get a dog? You can't have a life with him. That's fantasy. But you can have yours back. She's been gone eight minutes. We need you to get back to the hotel before Miller. What am I supposed to do? Alright. This pen is a transmitter. Once you have confirmation that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr that it is somewhere nearby or on his person. You confirm this by simply clicking the button. Sorry, I'm late. Everything go okay? Sure enough. It's getting hotter. So, did you get your price? I followed you tonight. You have nothing to say. Here's to Wichita. Where we first bumped into each other? Do you think that was fate, Roy? I do not believe in fate. But I believe in luck. I don't know what to believe. That hurt more than I thought it would. I'm going home. He promised that if you turned yourself in, he'll protect you. I love your optimism. Never lose it. Get him. Get her out of here. He's not here, Sir. They tell you you're going home? You sit inside the helicopter, June? You can't go home. Shit! Close the door! Get in the car! Don't let him escape. He has the battery! Hold your fire! He has the battery! · · They secure the kid? Yes. They found Roy? We'll find the body. We have to. He went down with the Zephyr. Thank you guys. Schwedelbach, GERMANY. Aah. Fitz. Fitz, I think we just made a wrong turn. Ramstein is that way, West. And I think we're going South. You know what, you're right. Tell him, we're back on track. I don't have the battery, but no one's gonna get it now. Yea, I've got the next best thing. I'll see you in Spain in two days. Hi, Wilmer! - How was the party? - It was nice I see the 'Goat' is still out there. Yea. I thought it was a wedding present. It was, but. I think I wanted her to want it more than she wanted it. Okay. This just come in? G-body Grand Prix. Largest hood in history. Gonna be a real beaut'. Ru-pa.? No. Fe-pa.? No, it's. Amapola 5826. Let's see. That's like an hour from here. I think it's a safe house. Here we go. Who's out there? I am not afraid to use this. Oh, Frank! Look at her. I wanna know what she's doing in my lawn in the middle of the night? I have the pistons you ordered. Pistons? For the '67 Grand Prix. Molly, I didn't. You're all wet. Please, come inside. That Pontiac you have out there, Frank, is a real classic. I really love pre-70s Grand Prix'. So, you two lived here long? This old place? It's been our home for forty years. Sit down, honey. Have a cookie. Frank thinks we should move, but I am uncomfortable. And we can afford to stay, thanks to Publisher's Clearing House. You won Publisher's Clearing House? Twice. Plus we won two lotto quick picks and Frank doesn't even remember buying. Oh, I didn't buy 'em. Oh, yeah. Like you didn't order pistons off the Internet. You don't know what you're typing into that computer, Frank. In a couple of minutes we'll have your clothes, honey. So. Roy Miller? This was one of his safe houses, wasn't it? What the hell are you talking about? Honey, what's this all about? I'm sorry, I thought. Maybe I must have this all wrong. I was just. looking for some information about my friend Roy. If you'd like to change, there's a proper room right there. That's our son Mathew. We lost him in Kuwait. It was a chopper crash. He saved the lives of two of his crewmen. He used to always take care of everyone. He was an Eagle Scout. This was taken the day he got that swimming badge. He could swim clear across lake Sunapee with practically one breath. I just. I believe we've. I'm June Havens. I'm Molly Knight. This is June Havens and I'm leaving a message on my own machine for whoever's listening to this phone call. I have the Zephyr. I have the Zephyr and I'm ready to make a deal. I'm sitting on Route 28, right outside New Hampshire. And if you want the Zephyr, you better come and get it. Hey fellas. So. You want the Zephyr? I got the Zephyr. It's right here. Come and get it. Seville, SPAIN. Come on. Let's go! Welcome to España. It will take a while, for it to take effect. Today is the Festival of San Fermin. Have you ever seen a bullfight, Miss Havens? My name is Antonio Quintana. I know who you are. What did he give me? It is something we're developing in my company. A new kind of truth serum. Really? I have a few questions for you about the battery, since we both know what you gave to my men was a joke. I don't like you very much. The truth? Good. It worked. You know, I really like Miller though. Did you know I was totally wrong about him in Salzburg? He wanted me to hear that phone call so that I would follow him. I'd turn him in and then he could get me home safely. He was trying to protect me. It's crazy that I could feel so powerful and capable around him. Shut up. - He takes care of me - Shut up! Where is the battery? Where is it? I bet you've never made a girl an omelet, have you Antonio? Don't test me, June. Or got her to her sister's wedding on time? It's really the little things. Honestly. - They count so much - Enough! Okay! Miller is dead! Roy Miller is dead. He's out. Está muerto! Comprendes? No. No, he is not. He can hold his breath for a really long time. Si está muerto! He is dead! I'm not gonna ask you again. If you don't tell me what I need to know you're gonna die. I do not know where the battery is. Then why did you tell everyone you had it? Why? Because I was trying to find Roy. This white bitch is driving me crazy. Antonio, wherever there's bad guys like you around Roy's not too far away. You are going to kill her. Kill her. You're gonna die. Finally. Nice to meet you. - John - Antonio. Too bad you couldn't get the battery. Where is the boy? I thought you would not? Why don't you follow me down to the river and bring the money? Okay. <i>Is this thatching? Because, I've never seen anything like that before.</i> <i>We have really good architecture in Boston, but nothing like this.</i> It's so clear. It's time to kill her. Is this all weapons money, or is this family money? Gardens. He likes gardens, huh? <i>So, do you guys take care of the garden? It's so relaxing.</i> This really is a happy place. Look at these trumpet flowers. Ok, Eduardo, you don't have to pull me around. You can just tell me where you want me to go, okay? This way, blondie. See, now we're communicating. Bet you're taking me some place safe and secure. Some place special. Antonio's special place. Oh, Antonio has a special place? That's so nice! Everyone should have a special place. Come on. Luis? Is there a problem, Eduardo? Shut up! - Hi Roy. - Hi June. You're supposed to be home. You're supposed to be dead. - I can explain - You don't have to I came here to get Simon. I just get caught up in something. Oh, that's cool. Be careful. His name is Eduardo. Eduardo, habla Engles? I need you to listen, because when you wake up you'll call your boss and tell him that Roy Miller, that's me, has the battery and escaped with the girl. - Oh, you have the battery? - Yea Will you tell him? Comprende? Yes. Let's go. I'm worried about Simon. I haven't seen him and my tracker is blank. Being with you is so exciting. You excite me, Miller. - Took you long to get here - 7 'o clock I think I feel like having sex. You know, really great sex. Did they give you something? You need to rehydrate. Roy. Roy. Roy. June. June? You don't seem very happy to see me, Roy. What? Not really. I am happy. So the red dot is us? No, we're yellow. Red dot is Simon. Grab tight. Hello? It's Eduardo! He says his name is Roy Miller, He said he has the battery. - That's impossible. - She disappeared with him. No! Miller is here. There they are! This way. Follow me! Oops. There's Fitz. I see him! Slow. slowly. Get the guns. Okay. - Here - Wow! - What next? - Lead them June Havens! You've got skills. - See you down the hill - Are you sure? No. Freeze right there, Roy. Hey, Simon. - Get down on your knees, now. - Roy! Put 'em in the water, in the water. I just want the kid, Fitz. Okay, well I hope you brought what you want otherwise, I'm gonna have to kill him, and I swear to you I'll do it. I believe you. Just like Wichita. - I understand - Okay I'm just gonna get the battery. It's right here. Please don't give it to him. Roy, please don't give it to him. Put it on the deck. - Roy! Roy! Roy! Roy! - Easy - Please don't give it to him. - Easy - Simon, it's gonna be okay - Roy, don't give it to him Shut up! - Okay, okay, I'll make another one - Simon don't talk Make another one? Am I dying? No, you fainted. I'm sorry. That's okay. No, I've been trying to tell you. Why is it hot? Because it's filled with power. The battery! I messed up. It's deterioriating. I know. It's unstable. You're a smart guy, Simon. I know you'll figure it out. Oh, my God. Roy, you're shot. Get help. You're beautiful, June. Stay with me. We're here Miller, we got you. June. WASHINGTON It's been a spectacular couple of weeks, Miller. It's good to see you, Isabelle. Hey, guys. We cleaned house, Roy. I have to thank you for that. I trusted the wrong man. That happens. Simon's happy. He's got a new life. Where June? I sent her home. She gets it. She knows you two lead different lives, and she's moving on. As should you. You gave up those things. You let go of who you were. Family. Friends. That's the deal. Why are we still talking about this? Because the agency invested a lot in you. And you are an asset only as long as you stay focussed. You look good. Get some rest. We're gonna transfer you to a secure facility tomorrow. For your safety. Nurse, what did you give me? Brotine Zero. Stay under there, Roy. You're dead. Make way, please. Going to the mortuary. Do not worry, Roy. I got this. It's time for a vacation. Hey there, sleepyhead. What day is it? Someday. Someday, Roy. What am I wearing? A pair of shorts. How did I get into these shorts? Roy, I've been trained to rebuild a 6 speed transmission. using only a pair of pliers and a crescent wrench. I think I can get you into a pair of shorts without looking. I'm not saying that's what I did. You're both the navigator and the DJ. We have a long way to go to Cape Horn. With me. Without me. With you. Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ. Yes, ma'am. DAIEI MOTION PICTURE CO., LTD. There are 100 billion fixed stars in galactic space. There are also 3 billion nebulae in macrocosm. Each is as big as galactic space. Old stars explode and scatter as gas. New stars are formed from the gas. What secrets are hidden in these countless stars? A star is in trouble.

Irregular waves that might've been sent from outer space. MYSTERIOUS WAVES FROM OUTER SPAOE The waves have stopped. We don't know yet if they're messages from spacemen. Dr. Shiga, the same electric waves were caught in England last year too. That was different. From beyond the solar system, we think. This one's very much nearer. People are on solar system planets? That's hard to say. You. There's no air or water on the moon. So no living thing inhabits it, as you know. And there are no rivers on Mars. It's several hundred degrees C, on Venus. And the surface of Jupiter is covered with frozen ammonia. Saturn is the same. No advanced vertebrates there. What do the waves mean? Assuming they came from Proxima Centauri which is nearest us. How long would it take Apollo, the newest spaceship, to get there? 500,000 years. Even if we received an invitation from spacemen. We can't meet them unless they come. It's only a dream yet. MESSAGE FROM SPACEMEN? Are there spacemen? Sure. Or those waves wouldn't have come. Tom! I see something funny! Look! What is it? What is it? A spaceship! It's true! It's keen! Let me look too! No, me! Let me look! A spaceship. I can't see it! It came down! Let's go see! Yes! Take me too! The vacant lot where we play. Akio! Akio! Mother. She'll scold us again. We're in trouble! I thought you were studying. Looking at stars? We saw a spaceship! You imagined it. Don't stay up late! You too, Tom, if you want to stay. We watch the stars every night to. I know. You want to find new stars and name them Akio and Tom Stars? That's not all! The paper said waves were sent. Systematically, too. Spacemen, maybe. Trying to find the star. They may be very civilized there. With no wars or traffic accidents. There's no such star. Behave, or I'll take away your telescope. Grownups have no dreams. No more foolishness. Go to bed. Tomorrow. What? A spaceman? Someone worse. Leave it to me. Where? It's them again! Here! Wait! Stop! What's this? You come back too. Good morning, Kon. Don't call him Kon! Say, Officer. It's all right. My name's Kondo. Two shouldn't ride on a bike. I'm sorry. In a hurry. In a hurry so early? You're up to something again? No! We're going to find a spaceship. Don't joke. We saw it! It's true! It came down. I see, I see, I see! If you're naughty again, I'll shave your heads. You okay? Take this. Off with you but walk. Walk. Beyond this hill? Let's climb from here. Wait for me! Hurry! Where? Over here! A spaceman? A rabbit? Cute! Let's catch it. Idiot! You can't. Let's Go. Brother! Brother! What is it? We were right! A spaceship! Yes! Let's go! It's groovy! Spacemen on it? Inside, maybe. Let's go inside. No! I'm scared of spacemen! Fool! They flew here. They're civilized! You're dumb. - Excuse me! - Hello! Think they'd understand Japanese? You're dumb! What? The crew's out? They must be away. This is great! It's working! Imagine travelling in this! Be keen! Now, the countdown. Standby for takeoff. Standing by! Let's go! Brother! Brother! It's moving! It's awful! Stop it! Where are you going, Brother? Mother will scold you! Naughty! Naughty! What'll tell her? It won't stop! Not till the fuel runs out. You fooled around with the switches! But you ordered me to! We're in space already! Funny. No weightlessness in here. A superior spaceship. What's that? Meteors! It'll hit us! It's terrible! Change course! No, I can't! We'll get hit! It's Gamera! Good for you! Help us, Gamera! Good! Groovy! Thanks, Gamera! A race with Gamera! I'm not scared now! No, Gamera's our friend! Awfully fast. Mach 3? No! It's outer space speed! Apollo, the moon rocket, was Mach 33. Am I surprised! We'd leave the solar system at Mach 50. ♪ Gamera, Gamera. ♪ You 're so very strong, Gamera, Gamera. ♪ Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus. ♪ Is it Mars or is it Venus? ♪ Come on, space monsters, ♪ It cuts, it pokes, go-go-go, ♪ It has mighty jet propulsion. ♪ Gamera 's strong, Gamera, Gamera. What happened? What's the matter? Gamera! Maybe he's trying to stop us! He's not coming. Why? Look! The speedometer! Getting faster! Going even faster. Remote control? Gamera's jet propulsion. Keep it up! No! What'll we do? This ship's being made to go fast. Gamera! Gamera! Help us! Mother! Mother! My, my, such a loud voice. Where were you? It's awful! Akio teased you? No! They went away on a spaceship! You're as silly as they are. It's true! We found a spaceship! Going in, it lit up! I see. Akio's up to something again? Mother, don't you believe in spaceships and spacemen? No, I don't. But the papers said a lot of people saw flying saucers! Made up stories. But! Stop it. Study or you can't enter a Good school. I'm in trouble! How can I make her understand? Poor boys. I wonder where they are now. Say, Tom, we're somewhere! We're safe! Not hurt? I'm okay! The hatch is open! Air here. We don't need space clothes. Back on Earth? Let's Go out and see! Where are we? Not the Earth. Is it Mars? Or Venus? No, they don't have any air. The air saved us. There are stars like Earth. We've found a new star. First ones here? Wait. We were brought by remote control. Be careful. Oh, no! Help us! It's Gyaos! One here too? Different color! A space Gyaos? Awful! What'll we do? The water's running backwards. It's running away. No! Attacking from behind! It doesn't move. It's flying low! It's cruel! Too smelly to eat? Returning to its hole. Where'd it come from? The opposite switch. Jump off! The water's returning! What's going on? I bet we're on a highly civilized star. Moving instantly. Great! Let's investigate some more! It's great! That sound? Somebody's here, I bet. Anybody around? Please answer! Idiot! They wouldn't understand Japanese. They're spacemen. What if goblins come out? Don't worry! Akio! Help me! Jump off! What're you afraid of? Moving corridor? I see. Let's Get on. It's wonderful! The control center. Where are we? Who are you? They don't understand Japanese. We waited for you. You can speak Japanese? This speaking machine translates all languages. Oh, boy! Science has advanced here more than on Earth. Which star is this? How far from the Earth? We call it Tera. On the opposite side of the Earth. Exactly like the Earth with the sun between. Twin stars then? Is it true? On the other side of the sun means they'd never see each other. A big discovery! Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. That's nine planets. Tera's the tenth? Yes. Gyaos again. A nuisance. Barbella, let it out. Your name's Barbella? It means sweet as a little bird. I'm Flobella, pretty as a flower. The others? The same as before. Running backwards. It's against the law of gravity. We control the laws of nature here. Superior civilization! I looked in my telescope every day. I thought there'd be an ideal planet without wars and traffic accidents. That monster. Guiron's our watchdog. We can control it. Gyaos is running! Why are there monsters in such a civilized place? Ours was an advanced society. We could control the laws of nature with electronic brains. But a mix-up in the computer brought calamity. It made uncontrollable monsters too. We sent out messages for help but received no answers. I see. The waves Dr. Shiga talked about. Those alive, got on a big spaceship to find another star but it fell. So only we two are left. We found a small ship worked, so we called it back. You were on it. I see. We can only live here on this space base now. Look. Getting colder. Bound in by glaciers in 5 hours. Barbella. This used to be a city long ago. Home of monsters now. Let's go back to Earth. Unless we do. Thanks. We'll check the ship and go before it freezes over. Aren't we lucky? If Gamera were here! Gamera's looking for us. Gamera? Rest room - above the control center. Rest until we repair the ship. The ship only holds two, so those boys. I know. We've time yet. I'll see if they're poisonous or not. If not, they'll become our rations. You check the ship. I'm hungry. Can we really go home? Don't worry! The girl said we'd go as soon as the ship's repaired! Yes. Won't they be surprised to see such groovy space Girls? Akio. What's the matter? It's funny. Now, Son, answer my questions. Yes. What would you like the most now? Don't be shy. What's the matter? Answer me. I see. Right away. Answer me until the food's ready. In pain? No, it feels nice. What's the matter, Akio? What's the matter, Akio? A nuisance! You knew Gyaos. Are there many monsters on Earth? Not now. Gamera got them all. What is Gamera? Looking for you, you said. Try to remember. Gamera 's the friend of children. He appears when we need him. He saved a child in Hokkaido once. He knocked Gyaos out when Gyaos tried to ea t the child. He saved two boys, too, when Viras attacked the earth. It's funny. I'm sure you suddenly stopped moving. I had a feeling I ate a lot of Mother's doughnuts. Her doughnuts are good. Say, I'm so hungry, I'm starving! I'm thirsty. - How is the ship? - We can leave a t once. Good! Prepare all the food on this card. Use sleeping powder. While they're sleeping, we'll ea t their brains raw. All their knowledge handed down to them is stored up there. We can adapt ourselves to our new surroundings then. Bacteria here do it to become higher animals. I see. I came for Tom. Elza. Thanks for keeping him. Not a t all. He and Akio haven't returned yet. Where did they go? Does Tomoko know? No. There's no use asking her. They've told her not to tell. Speaking of space. Tom wants to stay with us longer. He must have run away, knowing you were coming. I'm sure he did. He can stay. I see. If you'd be so kind then. Please stay for tea. I'm in a hurry, so. I see. Take care. Auntie. Why, Tomoko! They really went away on a spaceship! Tell me all about it. Kon! Kon! It's awful! - Hurry! - What's wrong? Leaving them here. Here! The spaceship was right here! There was an announcement by the American Aerospace Bureau. Those Flying Saucers were all made-up stories or just illusions. No, it's true! I saw it with my own eyes! But the Apollo spaceship men said Earth is the only oasis in space. There are no living things elsewhere. But the boys went on a spaceship! You believe me, don't you? Yes, I'll believe you. You're a good girl. You wouldn't lie. I'll find your brother for you. I'm so happy. Don't worry. I give up. The observatory. Thanks, Kon. Taking a child's word and asking the observatory? But. No buts to it. There are no such things! The boys must be playing near here somewhere. Please find them. Of course, I will. Understand? Pretending to believe them is bad from an educational standpoint. But Tomoko's serious about it, so. No! Brother! Kon's Going to find you, so don't give up! Please, God, save the boys. Akio. Here you are. Hungry, aren't you? My favorite doughnuts! Looks good! Just like mother's doughnuts. Please ea t them. Thanks! Wait. What is it? Be still! I thought Gamera came. I don't hear him! I imagined it? Hurry, let's ea t. I'll give you half. It's good! It's funny. Akio, what's the matter? Buck up! The sleeping powder took effect. Hurry. Cut here. Remove the skull. It's Gamera! Children's friend? Here for them? The nuisance. Let's take care of it first. Have the monsters fight. Let Guiron out. Dead. Serves him right. Akio! Akio! What happened? Big Sister! We must cook them or. Wait. It's funny. Gamera put it out of order. It's the only one left. If it's no good? Let's ea t the boys later. The spaceship first. It's awful! Akio! Akio! Akio! It hurts! My hair! It's no time for that! They're cannibals! They're not fixing the ship for us but to Go to ea t people! Let's run! But my head! Wear this. Tom! Wait a minute! Those boys? Running away. They know. No, they won't! You can't Get away! Back where we were! Run! You're smart. I pushed the reverse button. Look. Hurray, they're gone. Break the handle, so they won't return! They can't come back now! Serves them right! Goodbye forever! Too bad. How'd you get back? You couldn't come back! No, but we made a round trip. Let's run! Don't move! Let go! We're not good to eat! Get on it! Hands above your heads, back to back! Switch! We're not monkeys! Hurry. The ship! Where did they go? Even the policeman's worried. I'll spank Tom 30 times as punishment when he returns. I'm very sorry. I hope they return. Tomoko, will you tell us about the spaceship? Will you? Who are you? Akio's mother? We learned a spaceship flew up near here. The policeman reported it, so we came to check on it. It's true? Tell us, Tomoko. Where did the spaceship Go? We don't know. People say it flew very fast. We only know about the mysterious waves. What did it look like, Tomoko? What'll we do? Can't we go home? I miss Mama! Buck up. We have to find a way to escape! I wish Gamera would come. Why doesn't he come? Be quiet! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! That's right! You've a pistol? Yes. Shoot a t that switch. I see! Okay! I missed! No good. How many more shots? Three more. Trust me. It's funny! Guiron's remote control switch! Cut it off! What'll we do? Fixed a t last! It's Guiron! We can't control it from here! Let's escape to Earth! Those boys? Leave them. Lots o f others on Earth. Hurry! We can't go to Earth now! Wait! What is it? It hurts! I can't move! Help me! Flobella! On our planet, useless members die. Guiron's coming nearer! It's the end! We'll be killed! Help! Help! - Help! - Help! It's Gamera! Help us, Gamera! Don't lose! Go for it, Gamera! Don't lose, Gamera! You all right? I'm okay. It's Gamera! Get him, Gamera! Don't lose out! Don't miss! Good! Nice jump! A success! His jet propulsion's no good from the front! Banzai! Good, Gamera! Perfect! He's dancing the Go-Go! No! Trying to get rid of those! Can't pull in his feet with them! No jet propulsion then? Guiron's coming this way! Hurry! Remote control switch! Can't find it! Anyway, push! Hurry! Hurry! We'll Get killed! The end? Even he can't do it. It makes me mad! If we had a weapon! Wishful thinking's no good. Wait! Wait! I'm amazed. Gamera's alive. The last resort! I'll get him! Ouch! What's that? The weapon you wanted? A missile! The switch. Gamera's coming out! Good, Gamera! Now! Missile! Gamera, get that hole! Get it! Hooray! Gamera's calling us! It's repairing the spaceship! He's waiting. A big hand! Awfully big! Let's Go. It's moving! Hooray! We can go home! We're lucky! ♪ Gamera, Gamera. ♪ You 're so very strong, Gamera, Gamera. ♪ Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus. ♪ Is it Mars or is it Venus? ♪ Come on, space monsters, ♪ It cuts, it pokes, go-go-go, ♪ It has mighty jet propulsion. ♪ Gamera 's strong, Gamera, Gamera. What's the matter? It's Gamera! I'll report it! So noisy, I made a mistake! Hello. Yes, it is. Ridiculous. I don't believe it. I see Gamera in our telescope. The spaceship's in his mouth. Hard to believe. The boys were taken from here. Can it be true? Yes, it is! I hope it's true. Please believe her, men. Gamera's a friend of children. Kon. Thanks. Not a t all. The place? Beyond the mountain. Thank you. The boys' mothers? I am. I'm very much surprised. Gamera's heading this way, it seems, with a spaceship. Our children? It's Gamera! It's true! Brother! We should have believed our children. Yes. Tomoko. All right? We were worried. I'm okay! Your glasses. It's all right. When I'm happy, they slide down. Gamera! We're back! I'm Glad you're safe! But you made everyone worry. Mother, everybody, we're awfully sorry. Showing your penitence? No, spacewomen did it. Unbelievable. Listen, Kon, there are space people like you too? Akio. Tom. Dr. Shiga. We discovered a planet and saw space people. We thought there'd be a highly civilized, peaceful planet. But Earth's way the best! We shouldn't long for other planets. But make Earth a place free of wars and traffic accidents. Yes, a good experience for you. He pulled his head in. Gamera! Thanks! Gamera! Sayonara! Thanks, Gamera! Sayonara, Gamera! THE END <i>We live on Fortune Shell Island in Taiwan.<i> <i>A hundred years ago there was no TV here, no bars, no karaoke.<i> <i>Just a small fishing village in which a young couple lived.<i> <i>They were in love. The kind of love that feels like it's supposed to.<i> <i>One day when the man was fishing in the ocean, a storm sank his boat.<i> <i>The woman saw it and shouted: "Bu!", which is Mandarin for "no".<i> <i>She dove into the ocean to rescue him, and they were never heard from again.<i> <i>Some say they found each other in the afterlife.<i> <i>Some say they turned into dolphins -<i> <i>- because once they find a mate, they never part.<i> <i>Of all the dolphins on Earth, -<i> <i>- only the ones on Fortune Shell Island make the sound: "Bu!".<i> How about that? What do you guys know? That story is so depressing. - Mind your eavesdropping. - Gee, sorry. - Are you hungry, honey? - No. When I ask a question, you might not always say "no". You were the one who called me Bu, Ma. I need a little help here. Don't talk to our daughter in so many different languages! Look at her. Half the time she speaks Taiwanese, half the time Mandarin, - - the other half, she speaks English. If you think it's so easy, you raise her. - Or keep it to yourself, Tubby. - What did you just call me? What did she just call me? I want to know. What did you just say?. Well, I'm on a diet. Okay, you're done. I learned it from a fashion magazine. It's very stylish. Do you like it? Have you got a second? Wait until you see what I bought you. In my whole life, I've never seen an oyster like this one. - Any pearls? - No. - Looks like it's expensive. - A hundred dollars. - Thank you. - I also have this. My friend owns a wedding chapel. He'll give us a discount. So l. - Are you asking? - No, just wondering if. I'm asking. You got this gigantic oyster because you want us to. I bought this because the jewellery shop was closed. Will you marry me? Yes. I'll consider it. Why did you come all the way from Hong Kong to marry Pop? Your old pop was quite a hunk. And a good cook, too. - Did you like Hong Kong? - I loved it. Especially the pot rice. You don't really love Louis, do you? May I give you a little advice before it's too late? You have to trust your heart. Hi there, Buddy. I've got some news for you. Louis says he wants to marry me. Cut it out! I heard a story once. Souls start out together, but when they enter into the world, - - they somehow get separated. They continue to search on, until they can find - - who it is that they were destined to go through life with. What?. Bu! Where are you going? <i>"I'm waiting for you in Hong Kong. Albert."<i> How romantic. Excuse me, I'm looking for a place to eat. Can you write down the names of some restaurants? Thank you. - Taiwanese white trash. - Don't be like that. - You speak English? - Yes. Surprised? - Is this your first flight? - You can tell? Of course, I can tell. Hong Kong is enormous, you can get lost. I could show you around. Manhattan Robert here. I know everyone. Just ask around. You could say I'm famous. What do you say? - What are you doing? - Do you have a twin? Excuse me a second. <i>"Gangsters girlfriend disappears."<i> - <i>Good morning, Mr Chan.<i> - Good day. Wall Street moving today? <i>Yes, the Lion Fund borrowed heavily from the interbank market.<i> <i>They get a 20 per cent interest rate.<i> <i>That could climb even higher by morning.<i> Poke around a little. See if Lion Fund has sold any Nikkei futures. Then see if the yen is rising. Check if Japan's naval base contract with the U.S. expires soon. If all answers are positive, I'll buy up every possible share. <i>Are you aware that Lion Fund is run by two Nobel Prize winners?<i> <i>Its a great formula, why doubt them?<i> I have my reasons. They're greedy. It's all on paper, their cash is poor. It's time to make our move. Go ahead and do it. Order 1 00 roses and have them delivered to Carmen. Attach this card. - Didn't you two break up? - We're still friends. You're a big boy. You should settle down with someone soon. - Impossible. - With all those women? - They're so beautiful and elegant, too. - Too elegant for me. Make sure you know the right girl when you see her. I'll know her. Don't wait for me. Help yourself. That bottle floated all the way to Taiwan? And you came here. Hopped a ride to Hong Kong. Romantic and endearing. - There's news I need to break to you. - Yes? - One little detail you should know. - What? Listen. - No way! - Oh yes, it's true. - Come on, honestly? - Yes, I swear. - The note was to your boyfriend? - Ex-boyfriend. - But why? - Because he broke it off. - I mean, why are you gay? - As if it's a choice. - Well, you're a handsome guy. - True. None the less. All right! "I'm waiting for you here." That's how you got the idea. I chose this apartment because of the billboard. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. You don't get seasick, do you? Beautiful! It's a good job. You sounded nervous on the phone. What's the emergency? There's no emergency. I just missed you. You don't miss me? Sit down, I'll get you a drink. Tell me what's going on. Maybe you better go. Such a shame. You're boating and you didn't call me? - Yet you're here. - The papers say you're dating my girl. You believe everything you read? That's childish. - Well, tell me: Are you? - Yes. You've been competing with me for everything since we were kids. Chan, come here. I heard you're interested in my stocks. I'm interested in many stocks, not just yours. My associates and l hold all the controlling stock. - No way you're taking over my company. - Why not? You're standing on my boat, with my girlfriend. You must have a death-wish! Maybe you can try to get to the point. I think I deserve an apology. You don't have to do it in front of them. Call me five minutes after I've gone. Five minutes. You've got the time? The little hand is on the six. If your watch doesn't work, why wear it? I like the diamonds. Genuine. Guys, keep an eye on him. If he doesn't call me in five minutes, throw him right into the ocean. Give him a life preserver. Don't let him drown. So long, Boss. See you. Do yourself a favour. Call him and tell him you're sorry. - Hurry up. I've got a really hot date. - You must want to go in the water. Get the life preserver. Let's go. - I'm not interested. - Don't fight it. - Here's the life preserver. - Hurry, he's drowning! He's over there! Don't move. Help him. Chan went that way. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'll call you. Where is he? I don't see him. Can you see him? Are you okay? I'll go help the others. Hey, I know you. He's over here! He's in the back! Help me, I'm drowning. - Here, have a life preserver. - Thank you. - Does anybody see him? - No. Catch! Wait, there he goes! - He got away! - The Boss gave us instructions. Throw him into the ocean with a life preserver and that's what we did. Job done, let's go eat. Thank you. - Are you all right? - You are. I'm Bu. - Are you escaping? - Sure, why not? - From Vietnam? - Yes, that's right. - How many are you? - Just one. Well, then who's driving? - You want to give me a hand? - I'm starving. I'm hungry. - How about you? - I'm not starving yet, but I am hungry. Let's talk a little. It'll help us forget that we're hungry. What about? About all the things you really enjoy. Music, bowling, cars, women. Nothing? What are you smiling about? It's so boring. Let's talk about things you don't like. I don't like nosey people. Tell me what you don't like. I don't like growing up. Because you can't act spoiled. - Did you say "soiled"? - I said, "spoiled". The more you're grown up, the less people like you. What do you like best? Taking a shower when I'm really hot. When I wake up to a fresh cup of coffee. That sounds good. - The stars in Hong Kong are gorgeous. - The stars in Hong Kong? Stars everywhere are just as beautiful. You just have to look up and see them. What? A shooting star! My Mum says you should put your hands in your pocket, - - make a wish, and it will come true. Too bad I don't have any pockets. There's another one. - What did you wish for? - I'm not telling. It'll be bad luck. You're a nosey body, aren't you? I'm so sleepy. - Look, out there! - What is it? A boat! A boat! Over here. Busses don't go here and the authorities check out ID. You want a lift? That's okay. Just tell me where I am, and I'll walk back myself. No one lives around here. We're in the middle of nowhere, Miss. - My name is Bu. - Boob? - All right, just get in. - Okay. Wait, not you. I was talking to her. - I've noticed there's only two seats. - Yes, here's 20 bucks. Walk straight ahead till you see a taxi, or bum a ride on a boat, like I did. Come in. - You live here all alone? - There's a butler. - You're kidding. Must get real crowded. - Have a seat. - Can I look around? - Yes, sure. I'm hungry. Oh, I'm so hungry. - You need something? - The fish food. They don't need it, they're virtual fish. - Come here. Over here. - Why do you have electronic fish? I never have to change the water. - What if the power goes out? - I don't know. With this big house you must have parties all the time. - I don't have any friends. - You must be lonely. Now what? You like to fight, huh? Some like to play golf, some like horse-racing. I like boxing and fitness training. - What's this octopus thing? - Come on, let's go. This should fit you. You can change in there. Behind there. Hi, Betty. I need a taxi. Half an hour? Great. I didn't mean in there. There's a room behind the mirror. I was afraid I'd get lost in there and never find my way out. - Are you hungry? - Absolutely starving. - Then let's eat. - Do you have any Chinese pot rice? What? - This is the best take-out food. - I use this restaurant a lot. - Such a nice kitchen and you don't cook? - I don't like all the grease. - Stop staring at me. Eat your lunch. - Okay. - Why are you smiling? - I enjoy watching you eat. - Are you rich? - I guess so. - How did you make it? - Garbage. - No, really. - Buying and selling it. Don't be that way. - Do you happen to have a soda pop? - How about juice? It's healthier. Looking for Bu? She just went down the elevator. Your boyfriend is in these every week. Each time pictured with a new girlfriend. I'd call him promiscuous and not cute. Look at this. Let's hear it from one of his ex-girlfriends. "He doesn't know how to please me. He doesn't say sweet things. And yet, I'd say he's very romantic. He gets right to the point. Always doing business deals. And yet, he's just a kid. He's very competitive. He enjoys new things. He never changes, once he's made up his mind. With him. I feel very insecure." - So. That means what? - He likes new things, as in new girls. Soon we'll be reading about you. All those girls are just mean. They were insecure to start with. - l, on the other hand, am secure. - Forget it. Hong Kong is such a boring place anyway. - Going home? - No. C.N. is fun. You don't even have him yet. You can't just go up and take off your clothes. - Do you think I'm like that? - Do you think he isn't like that? He likes girls, he's successful. I have an idea, and it involves you. Count me out. - Please? - Fat chance. <i>Tell me where your daughter went.<i> <i>Bu found a bottle and went to Hong Kong.<i> If Bu's here in Hong Kong, I'll find her. We checked out Lo's Chemicals Manufacturing. Last year they had a 1 3 per cent growth. The net profit was 1 30 million dollars. The stock prices are 30 per cent higher. Shall we keep going? We've bought 16 per cent of the company. Mr Lo and partners have a death-grip on their 65 per cent and refuse to sell. If we continue to raise the price, the stock will become too high. Sell all my shares. If you sell all your shares at once, the price will plunge. If we sell low, our company will suffer a loss. Just do exactly as I told you. - I need to see K.K. - Yes, sir. - Who's K.K.? - The head of Environmental Protection. <i>'"You're a dead man."<i> Going down? Sorry, I'm going up. - I'm meeting a friend on the top floor. - This is the top. - Really? Oh yeah, she lives downstairs. - Her name is? Actually, it's a blind date. This floor is nice. I bet the rent is high. - Who made you write on my door? - What do you mean? Hey, look over there! Don't move, or I'll break it. Let go, let go! - Why did you do it? - Let go first. Some handwriting, huh? Cut it out! I'm bad at kung fu, I'm just delivering. - To me? - Check the rear pocket. You big bully, now it's broken. You'll hear from my lawyer. Now read it. "Gangster's Girl Missing." - What happened? - Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. No, with C.N. Did he buy the story? Does he believe I'm the gangster's girl? Who knows? Do you think it'll work? Of course it will. - What do we do next? - Get help from your buddies. I mean, your boyfriends. You're in big trouble, lady. We'll chop you to pieces. Make it good. You're going the wrong way. Your boyfriend is the mob boss of Taiwan. Our boss hates your boyfriend. So he told us to cut up your face. Your turn. If you don't believe us, just read the newspapers. Now everybody's looking for you. It worked. He's riding over. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. And you? - It's you! - Are you okay? I'm not sure who those guys are. Never mind. What's the matter with you? Don't let him see your face. These guys are really good for actors. Stay away. I'll stab you. Let her go, or I'll stab myself. You just cut yourself. - We'll let you live. - Let's get out of here. Don't chase them. Let's go, before the cops get here. - Whose factory is this? - We're okay here. I own it. - Why is it loaded with garbage? - I told you, I buy trash. - It's worth a lot of money. - I should tell my boyfriend about this. First you told me you were a refugee. Now you're a Taiwanese mob boss's girlfriend. - Are you really? - Yes. A dangerous woman to be with. - Are you afraid? - I'm never scared. You're not afraid my boyfriend will kill you? How did you become a gangster's girlfriend? There's a police station near my home. One day I saw these "wanted" posters. One of them had these beautiful eyebrows to go with these beautiful eyes. I went in every day and saw those eyes. It was love at first sight. - Then what happened? - I got his address. Now we're together. What was it you liked about him? He had a lot of style and was a great dancer. Very romantic. - Dancing means romance? - Like you're romantic. I can dance. - Like this? - Yes. How about tango? Yes. You're dull! Don't you know any exciting dances? - I know one. - You mean it? Let's see. - Don't be scared. - No way. Hands here. Jump up here. Here we go. - Pretty good. - More. - Not bored yet? - No, you're lots of fun. Just make sure you hold on tight. Don't let go. We'll be going pretty fast. Ready? Put your hands here and jump. Howie, the Exchange closed. It dropped a lot. Our stock took a 20 per cent hit. Closed at 6.50. - What's the loss in assets? - Ten million. Give or take a little. It's because Chan is dumping off our shares. What about our investigation? If Chan's goal is to control the company, he can't get rid of us. Then why dump his shares after buying so high? It doesn't make sense anymore. What's going on? It's a scheme. What's he up to? - What happened? - We ambushed Chan. - Is he hurt? - No. Not a scratch on him. That makes me feel better. If something happened, I'd blame myself. And if any of you men got hurt, I'd be devastated. - I'm feeling guilty already. - It was your dad's idea. My dad's? What was he thinking? Ambushing my best friend. Why don't we shoot him in the back? - Pull the trigger, it'd be much faster. - Ah, a sniper. I'm kidding. It's too cowardly. You guys have to call him out. Smart, Boss. I've got it. What we're gonna do is hire a fighter. Stronger than Chan. Also, he's smaller. Someone from overseas. Someone he doesn't know. He'll be disgraced. Come on, don't you know this signal? It means: Take a hike, go away! Confusing. - Have you seen this girl? - Yes. - That's Mary. - Mary? - That's not Mary, that's Bunny. - That's not Bunny. I'll show you where she is. - Put your glasses on. - She's got short hair. - What did you say to me? - I told you to put your glasses on. I have to go now. Oh, my gosh! What is he doing? This hadn't happened if I'd shown him where Bunny lived. Albert? I'm such an angel. Yes? What do you want? - What the. Stop it! - Where is she? - Let go of me! - You better tell me. Where's my Bu? What did you do with her? Where did you take her? Bu and I are engaged. - What's this? - Excuse me. This lady is so beautiful she deserved some wind effect. - You're gorgeous. - I know. Do we drink it? Yes. It's a 1982. That's not all. I can tell something else by tasting it. The grape picker was born in 1 960. Let's order. I'll do it. Do you make Chinese pot rice? - Just kidding. - You had me worried. Do you always eat with so many people watching you? Tell those guys they can leave now. Excuse me. - How come there's no one else eating? - I bought the restaurant. Then I can't see any stars! Without celebrities it's a bore. Why do you hate crowds? They're just people. You really don't have friends? But I have enemies. Why did you dump my company's stock and drive the price so low? I'm in the middle of dinner. I'll call you later. Tell me why? I'm losing money, and you're not doing too well, either. Please leave. The restaurant is closed. - Sir, you appear to be a smart guy. - You might say that. You must have a lot of time. Why not use it to save your company? - And leave now, okay? - Tell me who you are. I'm a guest, and I'm appalled at your behaviour. We're trying to enjoy a dinner for two, and you're disturbing our meal. - Let's talk. - We talked already. Outside. When will you get it? That sign means, "follow me"! Confusing. I like your attitude. It's nothing. Being around gangsters and all. You have to go? Yes. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Be careful. Watch your back. I cleared it with your boss. You can close up the parking lot, too. Then you guys can just take off. We'll have a little fun. Don't worry, I'm footing the bill. You heard Mr Lo. Move out. Mr Chan, have fun. Howie, what's going on here? I want you to meet someone. I invited him from overseas. Ladies and gentlemen: Alan! Alan here is undefeated in a very tough weight class. Alan will fight you, one on one, on behalf of me. Why don't I fight you? We're not the same weight class. - I'd have to much of an edge. - That's the point. If you lose to a short guy, it would be humiliating. Act like an adult. You have no choice. - You're going to use gloves? - Do you think he's a street fighter? - I don't want him dead. - If he hits with a glove, it won't hurt. No? Have him hit you with a glove. Tell me if it hurts. Try to knock me down any way you can. But no dirty tricks. They say you're a great fighter. Come on. They will not let you leave without a fight. You asked for it. - Ready? - Of course. - Alan is losing to him. - No, he's just testing him. He wants to see how hard he can punch. - Why is he changing gloves? - He's giving C.N. a little advantage. He knows his punches are too soft. I've come a long way. I don't want a short game. Every boxer fights to their own music. Provides the rhythm for their footwork. C.N. has no rhythm. His footwork is a mess. - Look at Alan's controlled rhythm. - You sound like an expert. Why don't you box? C.N. and I used to box, but I always lost. I thought, I'd go into announcing. - You like that better than boxing? - Yes. Talking, I sound invincible. In the ring, I'm like you. Mostly useless. C.N. used to have brilliant moves. What happened? He's concerned with other things, like buying stocks. He'll lose. C.N. seems like he's distracted. That's why he's going down. Good hit. But not enough power. Are you okay? You win. - You deserve it. We win! - While he's down, let's kick him. What do you say, Boss? How many times have I told you? Real men fight fair, not like cowards. Do you think there's honour in kicking a man when he's down? You're good. Let's go. My job is done. He's good. Are you okay? He didn't hurt you too bad, did he? You must be delighted that I lost. It might look like that, but I'm not. Do you need to call anyone? Forget it. Call me. Take care. - You didn't leave? - You said that I should wait. I came down to look for you. - They used tricks and outnumbered you. - No, it was one on one. I really lost. All right, so you lost. You'll get used to it. Just kidding. Train hard, then, when you're ready, go back and beat them. I do have to train. But not to beat up people. - Why else would you train? - For a strong body and a sharp mind. - I haven't trained in a long time. - But your gym is huge! What a waste. - Is it just for show? - I just hate to train alone. Okay, I'll train with you then. - Why are you being so nice? - Because you're rich. See how nice you look when you laugh. Out there you looked so grumpy and sad. That's probably the reason you lost. See? Nice laugh. You know, you don't need make-up and fancy clothes. Can you take tomorrow off?. Just say yes. - First tell me what we'll do. - Just say yes. - Okay. What'll we do? - Have fun. - Are we in love? - Huh? - I think you're really nice. - I'm in love, it's your turn to say it. I'm waiting for an answer. Here's how it works. You can just tell me - - in four words. or less: I love you. I don't love you. When did you get back? What is it now? I'm confused. I think I'm in love. Love is just a state of mind. More fantasy than truth. Love is like a radiant dream that quickly turns into a nightmare. Albert, you're such an inspiration. - I have news for you. - What? - Your boyfriend Louis is here. - What? He tried to strangle me. Fortunately, I'm strong enough to fight him off. He's been drunk ever since. - I think I really let him down. - We're talking about love, not pity. The worse you are to him, the better off he is. Until you figure out your feelings for Chan, don't let him see you. Good morning, how about a Bloody Mary? - Let go of me. - Where are you going? - To the kitchen. - No! Wait. - I need, I need. - What are you looking for? - A bottle-opener. - I'll get you a glass. - Here, take two. - How am I going to open it? - Bu, this is crazy. - Okay, I'll tell C.N. the truth. If you tell him now, you'll ruin it. He'll move on to the next girl. You're wrong. C.N. is not that kind of guy. He took a day off to be with me. It was a perfect day. When he's not around I miss him day and night. I'm the only girl for him. I love C.N. and I know he's in love, too. Sure sounds like love to me. - What is it? - I want sake. - You haven't even finished your wine. - No! I want sake, I want sake! Don't go away. Oh, excuse me. Thank you. Here it is. - Do you want to sing with me? - What do you think this is? Karaoke? Let's drink our sake. Here's to Bu. - It's too much. - You want more? Allow me. - Here's to my health. - Be careful, you'll get drunk. Well, bottoms up. You need some sleep. I've got her with me here. She's all right. Sure, you can talk to her. - Gloria, this is Bu. Gloria's a friend. - Oh, you're my new look-alike. I can see it. You knew it all along, didn't you? - You lied. - You started it. You loved me, so I loved you back. Was that a lie, too? Or was that real? Our happiness was real. If you like Hong Kong, why not stay? So, why am I here? So I can just be one of your girls? The note in the bottle said to go to Hong Kong right away. I thought this fairy tale was real. You changed the ending. <i>C.N., you've got some important information.<i> <i>The government passed a law prohibiting the use of styrofoam.<i> <i>Howie Lo's stock dropped dramatically. It's worthless.<i> <i>All stockholders sell off their shares. You knew the law would be passed.<i> <i>Why didn't you inform us?<i> - It was just a matter of time. <i>- The project waits for your decision.<i> That'll be all. - What's wrong? - I'm okay. What? It's for you. "Nothing can change a man like love. For he's going nowhere. And yet, so far." - Meaning what? - Going nowhere, and yet, so far. - Yes, I heard you. It means? - I don't know. I've been with you so long, and I never saw you like this. Garbage tossed about. Try moving forward. - Leave me alone. - Move on. - Beat it. - Be strong. I don't want to listen to you anymore. Fine, I can take a hint. You don't have to tell me twice. - How did you get in here? - We broke in. Call the police. - I don't think they'll let me call. - I bet they will. - I told you so. - You guys beat it. You ruined our boss's life. We lost our jobs. You're the reason why! Mister Chan. I heard you're back in training. - Yes, but not because of you. - Rematch? - Mr Lo sent you here? - Mr Lo's broke. It's not about money. - Not now. - You've got no choice. - You really enjoy fighting, don't you? - Only with the best. - Here we go again. I hate this part. - You don't know much about boxing, huh? Do you know why they do this? Okay. - Rules? - No rules. Anything goes. But no dirty tricks. You like white. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Good training. Wait, wait. What is it? - Can I ask him if he's okay? - If you insist. Are you okay? Okay. He's okay. Pretty good. <i>'"Just smile."<i> <i>See how nice you look when you laugh. You looked so grumpy and sad.<i> <i>That's probably the reason you lost. See? Nice laugh.<i> Are you ready? Don't worry, be happy. Let's dance. Hey, come on! Get up! Sir, are you all right? Up, up, up! Sir, are you hurt bad? - I'm okay. - You did it. You won! - I lost. - Why? If we were in the same weight class, he would have won easily. See if he's all right. - Why do you smell like gas? - Boss is setting fire to the factory. That's excellent. We'll be arrested for arson, if we're here. - This is dangerous. Be careful, Boss. - It's okay. If I get caught, I'm going to jail for sure. - You made sure everyone's out? - They're all gone. Deliver this to my father. Tell him I love him a whole lot. Give this one to C.N. Tell him I hate him a whole lot. Give this one to the authorities. It blames the fire on me. Really? You're going to jail, not me? I'm not going to jail, either. Stand aside. - I'll burn your factory to the ground! - Don't do it, Boss! I burned my eyes. I'll die anyway. So what if I can't see? I love you, Mary!! - Howie, what are you doing here? - C.N. It's all your fault. You took it too far. My father kicked me off the board of directors. I have nothing now. Nothing! - What about us? - What'll we do without you? Shut up! - Warmer? - Yes. - Okay? - That's good. Are you still blind? You're a good man. Better than I was. Styrofoam is bad for the environment. That's why I wanted to shut you down. But we can still be partners. We can team up together. We can open up a recycling centre. How come you're doing this? When we were in school together, you had to get higher grades. You were always more athletic. You had to have every girl I liked. As soon as you saw them once, you never saw them again. I hated you. - I hated you. - What for? For laughing. For being born so wealthy. It was all given to you. I had to work for everything I ever had. What I really hated was that you stole the love of my life, Carol. That was in second grade! Carol?! I heard she married a guy, what was his name. - Oh, Bob. No. Fred. - Fred! A major moron. He was so dumb. After so many years, neither one of us has found a girl - - we really truly loved. - You said before: "l love Mary." - You're crazy. Hold on a minute. You were engaged. What happened to her? Don't bring it up. I got cold feet. But Mary was a great girl. We laughed a lot. All day long. You should hear her laugh. It was great. I wish I could turn back the clock. She moved away when I broke off the engagement. I don't know where she went. I never found her. What's wrong with you? - I'm gonna find her. - Who? Mary? You never even met her! Hey, Bu, I missed you. How are you doing? What? Come back! Bu! <i>'"l miss you. C.N."<i> <i>What do you want?<i> Go, you're not wanted here. - You hurt Bu. - No, I didn't. She used to laugh. Now she's always sad because of you. You took her grin away. Now I'm sad, too. That's not good. You've got trouble. - What did you do to her? - I didn't do anything to her. Then why is she like this now? Leave her alone. - Go home or I'll beat your brains out! - Take it easy, please. You heard him. Get out of here! I warned you. Watch it! It'll be okay. I'll sit right here. Just try to get past, jerk. Check out your dad. He's The King. Are you okay, sir? Let me help you up. - Is your back hurt badly? - She doesn't want to talk to you. - Let me talk to her, please. - What would you say? - Bu, listen, l. - Stop it! - Bu. - Shut up! - Bu. - I said: "shut up!" Bu. - I guess you just don't listen. - You can kill me or let me talk to her. All right. You want to talk? Come with me. It's now or never. Well. Talk! - Let's go. Don't bother them. - I want to hear what he says to her. Why come here? - You left your clothes at my house. - I have a lot more. I know you like Chinese pot rice. It got cold. You can just nuke it. You think old clothes and pot rice will fix things? That's not all. - I've written a note in each bottle. - Really? What did you write? I love you. I miss you. All in four words or less. And I got writer's cramp. Why all the fuss? If you just stick a thousand dollars in each one, you'd get my attention. Say out loud that you love me. - Okay. I love you. - When did you start? When you went through my wallet. That night on the boat when we saw the star. What did you wish for? It just came true. What are you crying about? - Leave them be. - Hey, Don Juan! Kiss her! Don't just stand there wearing white. Kiss her! It's okay. Look over there. Are all the girls here so beautiful? Don't say it! I'll introduce you to a friend. He lives over here. Where? Hurry! Do you not understand? Krypton's core is collapsing. We may only have a matter of weeks. I warned you. Harvesting the core was suicide. It has accelerated the process of implosion. - Our energy reserves were exhausted. What would you have us do, El? Look to the stars, like our ancestors did. There are habitable worlds within reach. We can begin by using the old outposts. Are you seriously suggesting that we evacuate the entire planet? No. Everybody here is already dead. Give me control of the Codex. I will ensure the survival of our race. There is still hope. I have held that hope in my hands. This council has been disbanded. On whose authority? Mine. The rest of you will be tried and punished accordingly. - What are you doing, Zod? This is madness. - What I should have done years ago. These lawmakers with their endless debates have lead Krypton to ruin. And if your forces prevail you'll be the leader of nothing. - Then join me. Help me save our race. We'll start anew. We'll sever the degenerative bloodlines that led us to this state. And who will decide which bloodlines survive, Zod? You? Don't do this, El. The last thing I want is for us to be enemies. You have abandoned the principles that bound us together. You've taken up the sword against your own people. I will honor the man you once were, Zod not this monster you've become. Take him away. Sir? Is everything all right? Out of the way. I said-- Get me Lara. Jor. Behind you. Lara, you have to ready the launch. I'll be with you as soon as I can. H'Raka! Hyah! - Can you see the Codex? - It's just beneath the central hub. But I'm compelled to warn you. Breaching the genesis chamber is a Class-B crime-- Nobody cares anymore, Kelex. The world is about to come to an end. Jar-El, by the authority of General Zed surrender the Codex. Unh! Ahhh! Easy, H'Raka. Did you find a world? - We have. - Orbiting a main sequence yellow star. “just as you said it would. A young star. His cells will drink its radiation. It's a seemingly intelligent population. He'll be an outcast. A freak. They'll kill him. How? He'll be a god to them. What if the ship doesn't make it? He'll die out there alone. I can't do it. I thought I could, but. - Lara. - .now that he's here. Krypton is doomed. It's his only chance now. It's our people's only hope. What is it, Kelex? Five attack ships converging from the east. Citadel's defenses are being scanned and evaluated. I'll upload the Codex. No, wait. Lara. Just let me look at him. We'll never get to see him walk. Never hear him say our names. But out there amongst the stars he will live. Goodbye, my son. Our hopes and dreams travel with you. Concentrate fire on the main doors. Lady Lara. - The phantom drives are coming online. - Proceed to ignition. General. We have identified an engine ignition within the citadel. A launch. Hold this platform, commander. I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El. Surrender it and I'll let you live. This is a second chance for all of Krypton not just the bloodlines you deem worthy. What have you done? We've had a child, Zod. A boy child. Krypton's first natural birth in centuries. And he will be free. Free to forge his own destiny. Heresy. Destroy it. Ah! Lara listen to me. The Codex is Krypton's future. Abort the launch. No! Your son, Lara where have you sent him? His name is Kal son of El. And he's beyond your reach. Bring that ship down. Target locked. Lay down your weapons. Your forces are surrounded. General Zod for the crimes of murder and high treason the Council has sentenced you and your fellow insurgents to three hundred cycles of somatic reconditioning. Do you have any last words? You won't kill us yourself! You wouldn'l sully your hands! But you'll damn us to a black hole for eternity! Jor-El was right. You're a pack of fools, every last one of you. And you. You believe your son is safe? I will find him. I will reclaim what you have taken from us. I will find him. I will find him, Lara. I will find him! Argh! Lady Lara, shouldn't you find refuge? There is no refuge, Kelor. Jor-El was right. This is the end. Make a better world than ours, Kal. Watch it, dumb-ass! Keep your eyes open or you're gonna get squashed. Where the hell did they find you, greenhorn? Let's get this trap in the air. Gentlemen, secure the deck. We just got a distress call from a rig due west of us. Secure the deck. All civilian boats, stand clear. The sub-sea valves failed and the rig is about to explode. Roger, Coast Guard. What about the men left inside? - Forget them. They're dead. - Greenhorn fetch me my binoculars. Greenhorn. This is the last of the oxygen. I don't know how much longer we can hold out. This is Coast Guard 6510. We'll make one more pass then get out. Wait, wait. I got some guys on the helipad. Right here! Come on, come on! Let's go! Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! Get that last guy loaded. We have got to go. Hey, let's go. What are you doing? Go! Go! Argh! Argh! "When Kansas became a territory? Clark. Are you listening, Clark? I asked if you could tell me who first settled Kansas. Are you all right, Clark? Clark. Clark. Clark! Clark, come out of there. Leave me alone. Clark, I have called your mother. Clark? Ah! I'm here. Clark, honey, it's Mom. Will you open the door? - What's wrong with him? - He's such a freak. Crybaby. His parents won't even let him play with other kids. I know. Sweetie. How can I help you if you won't let me in? The world's too big, Mom. Then make it small. Just, um focus on my voice. Pretend ifs an island out in the ocean. Can you see it? I see it. Then swim towards it, honey. What's wrong with me, Mom? Clark. Clark. - Did you get everything I need? - Yep. Hold it, hold it. Hey, ass-wipe. What do you think? You see the game? - Leave him alone, Pete. - What are you, his girlfriend? I wanna hear what he has to say. Come on dick-splash. Mos SCREAMING] My son was there. He was in the bus. - He saw what Clark did. - I know he did. - I'm sure what he thought he saw was-- - Was an act of God, Jonathan. This was providence. I think you're blowing it out of proportion. No, I'm not. Lana saw it too. And the Fordham boy. This isn't the first time Clark's done something like this. I just wanted to help. I know you did, but we talked about this. Right? Right? We talked about this. You have. Clark, you have to keep this side of yourself a secret. What was I supposed to do? Just let them die? Maybe. There's more at stake here than just our lives, Clark, or the lives of those around us. When the world. When the world finds out what you can do it's gonna change everything. Our. Our beliefs, our notions of what it means to be human. Everything. You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right? She was scared, Clark. Why? People are afraid of what they don't understand. Is she right? Did God do this to me? Tell me. We found you in this. We were sure the government was gonna show up on our doorstep but no one ever came. This was in that chamber with you. I took it to a metallurgist at Kansas State. He said whatever it was made from didn't even. Didn't even exist on the periodic table. That's another way of saying that it's not from this world, Clark. And neither are you. You're the answer, son. You're the answer to "Are we alone in the universe?" I don't wanna be. And I don't blame you, son. It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear. But you're not just anyone, Clark, and I have to believe that you were. That you were sent here for a reason. All these changes that you're going through, one day. One day you're gonna think of them as a blessing. When that day comes you have to make a choice. A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not. Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son? You are my son. But somewhere out there you've. You have another father too, who gave you another name. And he sent you here for a reason, Clark. And even if it takes you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is. Bound by wild desire I fell into a ring of fire Wait a second. Aren't you here fer the exercise? No, there was a change in the plans. Somebody found something strange on Ellesmere. - Aircom's making runs out there all week. - That rat hole? - You gotta be kidding me. - I know. It's crazy. The Americans are there too, lots of them. - Anything else? - They're calling it an anomalous object. - Whatever that means. - Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious. - Oh, come on, Chrissy. - Knock it off. - Sit down. - Let me go. Hey. Leave her alone, man. Or what, tough guy? Or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I think I'll probably just leave when I'm good and ready. Ooh. Oh, there he is. It's not worth it, sweetie. Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip. Strike. Thanks. Hi. Miss Lane. How you doing? - Good. - Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo. How far to the station? - Camp's just over the rise. I'll walk you over. - Great. Joe can take your bags. Joe. Help her out. Careful with those. They're heavy. I gotta confess, Miss Lane I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet. But those pieces you wrote when you were embedded with the 1st Division were. Well, they were pretty impressive. Well, what can I say? I get writer's block if I'm not wearing a flak jacket. Miss Lane. I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom. Dr. Emil Hamilton from DARPA. - You're early. - Hi. We were expecting you tomorrow. Which is why I showed up today. Look, let's get one thing straight, guys, okay? The only reason I'm here is because we're on Canadian soil and the appellate court overruled your injunction to keep me away. So if we're done measuring dicks can you have your people show me what you found? NA SA's EOS satellites pinged the anomaly first. The ice shelf plays hell on the echo soundings. - But there's something there. - A submarine, maybe? Soviet-era? Doubtful. That's 300 meters. Considerably larger than anything we know they built back then. But herds the spooky pan. The ice surrounding the object it's nearly twenty thousand years old. Miss Lane? Try not to wander. Temperatures drop to minus 40 at night around here. Wouldn't find your body till after spring. And there you go. What if I need to tinkle? There's a bucket in the corner. Where the hell are you going? Hello'? It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right. You're hemorrhaging internally and if I don't cauterize this bleed. How can-l? I can do things that other people can't. Now hold my hand. This is gonna hurt. What Colonel Hardy and his team surmised was a Soviet-era submarine was actually something much more exotic. An isotope analysis of the surrounding ice bores suggests that an object had been trapped in the glacier for over 18, 000 years. As for my rescuer? He disappeared during the object's departure. A background check revealed that his work history and identity had been falsified. The questions raised by my rescuer's. "existence are frightening to contemplate but I also know what I saw. "And I have arrived at the inescapable conclusion that the object and its occupant did not originate on Earth." I can't print this, Lois. You might have hallucinated half of it. What about the contractors who corroborated my story? - The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship. Of course they are. They're supposed to. It's the Pentagon. Perry, it's me we're talking about. - I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. - Then act like it. - Print it or I walk. - You can't. You're under contract. I'm not running a story about aliens walking among us. Never gonna happen. That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady. I'm sending you the article. My editor won't print it, but if it leaked online. Got it. But didn't you once describe my site as a creeping cancer of falsehoods? I stand by my words, Woodburn, but I want this story out there. - Why? Because I want my mystery man to know I know the truth. Recursive diagnostics complete. Guiding presence authenticated. All systems operational. To see you standing there having grown into an adult. If only Lara could have witnessed this. Who are you? I am your father, Kal. Or at least a shadow of him. His consciousness. My name was Jor-El. And Kal? That's my name. It is. I have so many questions. Where do I come from? Why did you send me here? You came from Krypton. A world with a much harsher environment than Earths. Long ago in an era of expansion our race spread out through the stars seeking new worlds to settle upon. This scout ship was one of thousands launched into the void. We built outposts on other planets. musing great machines to reshape environments to our needs. For 100,000 years, our civilization ﬂourished accomplishing wonders. What happened? Artificial population control was established. The outposts on space exploration were abandoned. We exhausted our natural resources. As a result, our planet's core became unstable. Eventually, our military leader General Zod, attempted a coup. But by then it was too late. Your mother and I foresaw the coming calamity and we took certain steps to ensure your survival. This is a genesis chamber. All Kryptonians were conceived in chambers such as this. Every child was designed to fulfill a pare-determined role in our society as a worker a warrior, a leader and so on. Your mother and I believed Krypton lost something precious. The element of choice, of chance. What if a child dreamed of becoming something. mother than what society had intended for him or her? What if a child aspired to something greater? You were the embodiment of that belief, Kal. Krypton's first natural birth in centuries. That's why we risked so much to save you. Why didn't you come with me? We couldn't, Kal. No matter how much we wanted to. No matter how much we loved you. Your mother, Lara, and I were a product of the failures of our world as much as Zod was tied to its fate. - So I'm alone. - No. You're as much a child of Earth now as you are of Krypton. You can embody the best of both worlds. A dream your mother and I dedicated our lives to preserve. The people of Earth are different from us, it's true. But, ultimately, I believe that's a good thing. They won't necessarily make the same mistakes we did. Not if you guide them, Kal. Not if you give them hope. That's what this symbol means. The symbol of the house of El means hope. Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief in the potential of every person to be a force for good. That's what you can bring them. Why am I so different from them? Earth's sun is younger and brighter than Krypton's was. Your cells have drunken its radiation. “strengthening your muscles, your skin, your senses. Earth's gravity is weaker, yet its atmosphere is more nourishing. You've grown stronger here than I ever could have imagined. The only way to know how strong is to keep testing your limits. Unh! Uh-- Oh. Whoa! You will give the people ofEart/v an ideal to strive towards. They'll race behind you. They will stumble. They will fall. But in time they will join you in the sun, Kal. In time. you will help them accomplish wonders. How do you find someone who has spent a lifetime covering his tracks? You start with the urban legends. - .that have sprung up in his wake. - That's Joe. The friends of a friend. - .who have seen him. - He worked here. For some he was a guardian angel. For others, a cipher a ghost who never quite fit in. Well, I was saying we were coming towards the oil rig. As you work your way back in time, the stories form a pattern. I'm looking for a Pete Ross. Do you know him? Yeah, he works at the IHOP. If you go down the road. Pete Ross? I'd like to talk to you about an accident when you were younger. A school bus that went into the river. Dusty. Shh-shh-shh. Mrs. Kent? I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the Daily Planet. Quiet. I'm from the Daily Planet and I'd like to talk to you about your son. I figured if I turned over enough stones you'd eventually find me. Where are you from? What are you doing here? Let me tell your story. What if I don't want my story told? It's going to come out eventually. Somebody's going to get a photograph or figure out where you live. - Then I'll disappear again. - The only way you could disappear is to stop helping people altogether, and I sense that's not an option for you. My father believed that if the world found out who I really was they'd reject me out of fear. I'm tired of safe. I just wanna do something useful with my life. So farming, feeding people. That's not useful? I didn't say that. Our family's been farming for five generations. Your family, not mine. I don't even know why I'm listening to you. You're not my dad. You're just some guy who found me in a field. Clark. It's all right, Martha. He's right. Clark has a point. We're not your parents. But we've been doing the best we can. And we've been making this up as we go along, so maybe. Maybe our best isn't good enough anymore. Look, Dad-- Hold on. Go for the overpass. Go for the overpass! Take cover! Take cover! - Over there. Just follow them. - Take cover. She's stuck. Hank's still in the car. Hank's in the car. - I'll get him, I'll get him. - No, no. Get your mom to the overpass. Hank! Hank! Come! Jonathan! - Mom, ifs okay. - Jonathan! - Mom, stay here. Dad! I let my father die because I trusted him. Because he was convinced that I had to wait. That the world was not ready. What do you think? You better watch out, Lois. Hey, Perry's gunning for you. He knows you're Woodburns anonymous source and cannot wait to rip you a new one. Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha. I told you not to run with this, and what do you do? You let Wood burn just shotgun it all over the Internet. Now the publishers want me to sue you. Well, if it makes a difference, I'm dropping it. Whoa, just like that? Yep. What happened to your leads? They didn't pan out. The story is smoke. Or it didn't get the traction you hoped? Two weeks leave no pay, that's your penance. You try something like this again you're done here. - Fine. Let's make it three weeks since you're so willing to agree. - Perry. - No, no. Don't. Don't. I believe you saw something, Lois. But not for a moment do I believe that your leads just went cold. So whatever your reasons are for dropping it I think you're doing the right thing. Why? Can you imagine how people on this planet would react if they knew there was someone like this out there? Go get him. Well, look at you. A reporter came by here. She's a friend. Don't worry. Oh. Mom. - Heh, heh, heh. - What'? - I found them. - Who? My parents. My People. I know where I come from now. Wow. That's wonderful. I'm so happy for you, Clark. What? - It's nothing. When you were a baby I used to lay by your crib at night listening to you breathe. It was hard for you. You struggled. And I worried all the time. You worried the truth would come out. No. The truth about you is beautiful. We saw that the moment we laid eyes on you. We knew that one day, the whole world would see that. I'm just. I'm worried they'll take you away from me. I'm not going anywhere, Mom. I promise. General Swanwick, sir. What am I looking at, doc? Comet? Asteroid? Comets don't make course corrections, general. Wanted you to see this before some amateur with a telescope creates a worldwide panic. The ship appears to have inserted itself into a lunar synchronous orbit though I have no idea why. Have you tried. communicating with it? Well, they haven't responded as of yet. I'm just speculating, but I think whoever? At the helm of that thing is looking to make a dramatic entrance. Anybody know where we keep the toner? - What's going on? - It's all over the news. You gotta see this. Clark. Yeah? Coming. This is a breaking news. An unidentified. You are not alone. You are not alone. You are not alone. You are not alone. It's coming in on the RSS feeds. You are not alone. It's on my phone too. My name is General Zod. Icome from a world far from yours. I have journeyed across an ocean of stars to reach you. For some time, your world has sheltered one of my citizens. I request that you return this individual to my custody. For reasons unknown, he has chosen to keep his existence a secret from you. He will have made efforts to blend in. He will look like you. But he is not one of you. To those of you who may know of his current location. mine fare of your planer." rests in your hands. To Kai-El, <i>I</i> say this: Surrender within 24 hours or watch this world suffer the consequences. Ah! We hardly know anything about him, isn't that right? If he truly means us no harm he'll turn himself in and face the consequences. And if he won't do that then maybe we should. The Daily Planet's Lois Lane knows who this guy is. Shek the one we should be questioning. - Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane-- - Hello? Are you watching this crap? Been running all morning. For once I agree with Woodburn. Have you seen him? - Do you know where he is? - No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say. The entire world is being threatened here. This is not time for you to fall back on journalistic integrity. This is serious, Lois. The FBI is here. They're throwing around words like "treason." I gotta go- FBI. Hands up. Drop the bag. Now. Regarding the visitors themselves we know. very little. According to government officials the visitors do not represent a threat. <i>despite the ominous tone</i> <i>of their message.</i> Then of course there's the question on everyonek mind: "Who is this Kal-El person? Does he actually exist? How could he have remained hidden from us for so long?" Come on, Kent. Come on. Fight back. Get up, Kent. So is that it? Is that all you've got? Come on, Kent. Come on! Did they hurl you? You know they can't. That's not what I meant. I meant, are you all right? I wanted to hit that kid. I wanted to hit him bad. I know you did. I mean part of me even wanted you to, but then what? Make you feel any better? You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Because whoever that man is, good character or bad, he's. He's gonna change the world. What's on your mind? I don't know where to start. Wherever you want. That ship that appeared last night. I'm the one they're looking for. Do you know why they want you? No. But this General Zod even if I surrender, there's no guarantee he'll keep his word, but if there's a chance I can save Earth by turning myself in shouldn't I take it'? What does your gut tell you? Zod can't be trusted. The problem is I'm not sure the people of Earth can be either. Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith first. The trust part comes later. All right. You've got our attention. What is it you want? I would like to speak to Lois Lane. What makes you think she's here? Don't play games with me, general. I'll surrender, but only if you guarantee Lois's freedom. Why are you surrendering to Zod? I'm surrendering to mankind. There's a difference. You let them handcuff you? Wouldn't be much of a surrender if I resisted. And if it makes them feel more secure then all the better for it. What's the S stand for? It's not an S. On my world it means hope. Well, here, it's an S. How about Super-- Sir? - Hi, my name is Dr. E-- Emil Hamilton. I know, I can see your ID tag in your breast pocket. Along with a half-eaten roll of Lifesavers. I can also see the soldiers in the next room preparing that tranquilizing agent of yours. You won't need it. Sir, you can't expect us to not take precautions. You could be carrying some kind of alien pathogen. Been here for 33 years, doctor. - Haven't infected anyone yet. - That you know of. We have legitimate security concerns. You revealed your identity to Miss Lane over there. Why won't you do the same with us? Let's put our cards on the table here, general. You're scared because you can't control me. You don't, and you never will. But that doesn' mean I'm your enemy. Then who is'? Zod'? That's what I'm worried about. Be that as it may I've been given orders to hand you over to him. Do what you have to do, general. Thank you. For what? For believing in me. Didn't make much difference in the end. It did to me. They're coming. You should leave now. Go, Lois. Kai-El. I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul. On behalf of General Zod, I extend you his greetings. - Are you the ranking officer here? - I am. General Zod would like this woman to accompany me. You asked for the alien. You didn't say anything about one of our own. Shall I tell the general you're unwilling to comply? I don't care what you tell him. It's all right. I'll go. The atmospheric composition on our ship is not compatible with humans. You need to wear a breather beyond this point. Kai-El. You have no idea how long we've been searching for you. I take it you're Zod? General Zod. - Our commander. - It's all right, Faora. We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum. He's a stranger to our ways. This should be cause for celebration, not conflict. - Unh. - Not conflict. I feel strange. Weak. What's happening to him? He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics. Clark. You've spent a lifetime adapting to Earth's ecology but never adapted to ours. Help him. I can't. Whatever's happening. - .has to run its course. - Clark. Help him. Help him. Hello, Kal. Or do you prefer Clark? That's the name they gave you. Isn't it? I was Krypton's military leader your father our foremost scientist. The only thing we agreed on was that Krypton was dying. In return for my efforts to protect our civilization and save our planet I and my fellow officers were sentenced to the Phantom Zone. And then the destruction of our world freed us. We were adrift, destined to ﬂoat. "amongst the ruins of our planet until we starved. How did you find your way to Earth? We managed to retrofit the phantom projector into a hyperdrive. Your father made a similar modification to the craft that brought you here. And so the instrument of our damnation became our salvation. We sought out the old colonial outposts looking for signs of life. But all we found was death. Cut off from Krypton, these outposts. mwithered and died long ago. We salvaged what we could 3!'H? Of', “weapons even a world engine. For 33 years we prepared until finally we detected a distress beacon which you triggered when you accessed the ancient scout ship. You led us here, Kal. Now it's within your power to save what remains of your race. On Krypton the genetic template for every being yet to be born is encoded in the registry of citizens. Your father stole the registry's Codex and stored it in the capsule that brought you here. For what purpose? So that Krypton can live again on Earth. Where is the Codex, Kal? If Krypton lives again what happens to Earth? The foundation has to be built on something. Even your father recognized that. No, Zod. I can't be a part of this. Then what can you be a part of? No! Zod! No! No! Your father acquitted himself with honor, Kal. You killed him? I did. And not a day goes by where it doesn't haunt me. But if I had to do it again, I would. I have a duty to my people and I will not allow anyone to prevent me from carrying it out. What's the sit-rep, major? DSP pinged two bogeys launching from the alien ship. - Put it up. - Yes, sir. There it is. Re-task lkon-4. - .and get me a closer look. - Yes, sir. Command, the word of the day is trident. We have two alien craft on aggressive approach. Ikon-4 coming online. Air speed? 380 knots, entering Kansas airspace. Not responding to our hails. You're wasting your efforts. The strength you derived from the Earth's sun has been neutralized aboard our ship. Here in this environment you are as weak as a human. Unh! Unh! Where did you come from? The command key, Miss Lane. Thanks to you, I'm uploading to the ship's mainframe. Who are you? I am Kai's father. Can you help us? I designed this ship. I can modify its atmospheric composition to human compatibility. We can stop them. We can send them back to the Phantom Zone. How? I can teach you. And in turn, you can teach Kal. Will you help me? The ship's crew are alerted. We need to move quickly. Retrieve the command key. - Did you do that? - Yes. Pick up her sidearm. What's happening? To your right. Fire. Behind you. Secure yourself inside the open pod. Safe travels, Miss Lane. It's unlikely we'll see each other again. Remember, the phantom drives are essential in stopping them. Move your head to the left. Is it true what Zod said about the Codex? Strike that panel. We wanted you to learn what it meant to be human first so that one day, when the time was right, you could be the bridge between two peoples. Look. Lois. You can save her, Kal. You can save all of them. You'll be safe here. - Are you all right? - Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't wanna tell them anything, but they did something to me. - They looked inside my mind-- - it's okay, Lois. They did the same thing to me. Clark! The craft he arrived in where is it? Go to hell. There. Unh! The Codex is not here. Argh! Ah! Where has he hidden it? I don't know. Where is the Codex?! Ahh! You think you can threaten my mother?! Ah! What have you done to me? My parents taught me to hone my senses, Zod. Focus on just what I wanted to see. Without your helmet you're getting everything. Unh! And it hurts doesn't it? Argh! Get away from the window. Get inside. It's not safe. Ail players, this is Guardian. I am airborne mission commander. I have previously encountered and observed the beings we're about to engage. They are extremely dangerous and we have been authorized to use deadly force. Roger, Guardian, we are inbound to target. Cleared hot. Weapons free. Copy, 11. Weapons free. Thunder 11 tally three targets. Unh! Thunder 11 good hit. Request immediate re-attack. Roger, Guardian. We'll make a second gun run on a heading of 212 degrees. Thunder 11, eject! Eject! Thunder 11, eject! I have a bogey incoming! Oh, shit. Argh! You are weak son of El. Unsure of yourself. The fact that you possess a sense of morality and we do not gives us an evolutionary advantage. And if history has proven anything it is that evolution always wins. Ragh! Unh! CCT, we're approaching LZ Jayhawk. Get down in five. Let's go. Go to the LZ. Roger, sarge. Let's go! All rangers, I need you to engage the targets. Guardian, this is Badger 01. What about the guy in blue? I said engage all targets. Contact. Contact. Ah! You Okay? We're auto-rotating, going in hard. Brace for impact. Brace for impact. We're going in hard! Fallen angel. Fallen angel. Guardian is down. I repeat, Guardian is down. Guardian, do you read? Thunder 12, calling Guardian. - Do you read? - Thunder 12 this is Guardian. Put down everything you've got north of my position. - This will be danger-close. - Copy, danger-close. Good luck, sir. A good death is its own reward. You will not win. For every human you save we will kill a million more. Unh! Do we have an all clear? Do we have an all clear? Alpha team, sit-rep. Alpha team. Do you copy? Alpha team. This man is not our enemy. Thank you, colonel. Mom'? I'm all right. Nice suit, son. I'm so sorry. It's only stuff, Clark. It can always be replaced. But you can't be. Mom, Zod said this Codex he's looking for can bring my people back. Isn't that a good thing? I don't think they're interested in sharing this world. Clark. Clark. I know how to stop them. What happened down there? He exposed a temporary weakness. It is of little consequence because I have located the Codex. It was never in the capsule. <i>Jor-el took the Codex---</i> .the DNA of a billion people, then he bonded it within his son's individual. cells. All of Krypton's heirs living hidden in one refugee's body. Does Kal-EI need to be alive for us to extract the Codex from his cells? No. Release the world engine. “Mat just happened? The ship just split in mo. Track one is heading east, track two to the southern hemisphere. - How fast is that bogey moving? - Approaching Mach 24 and accelerating. It's gonna impact somewhere in the Indian Ocean. The rest of the ship is descending. Put it on the board now. Yes, sir. Oh, my God. Bring the phantom drive online. We are now slave to the world engine. Initiate. - What have they hit us with? - Looks like some kind of gravity weapon. It's working in tandem with their ship. Somehow they're increasing the Earth's mass clouding the atmosphere with particulates. Oh, my God. They're terraforming. What's that? Planetary engineering modifying the Earth's atmosphere and topography. Turning Earth into Krypton. - But what happens to us? - Based on these readings there won't be an "us." General Swanwick, sir. I'm on with the control tower. Colonel Hardy's on his way and he's got Superman in tow. Superman? The alien, sir. That's what they're calling him. Superman. We have a plan, general. Is that what I think it is? It's the ship he arrived in. This ship is powered by something called a phantom drive. It bends space. Zod's ship uses the same technology, and if we can make the two drives collide-- A singularity can be created. - Like a black hole. - Yes. So if we open up this doorway they should be pulled back in. So you want us to bomb them with that? General, that craft maxes out 17,000 pounds, we can drop it from a C-17. It's a viable plan. If I don't stop that machine over the Indian Ocean the gravity field will continue to expand. If that thing is making Earth more like Krypton won't you be weaker around it? Maybe. I'm not about to let that stop me from trying. You might want to step back a little bit. Maybe a little bit more. Faora. Take command. - Yes, sir. - I need to secure the genesis chamber and pay my respects to an old friend. Guardian en route to Metropolis package in tow. Be advised, F-35s inbound to rendezvous point. You should have visual contact now. Command key accepted. Genesis chamber coming online, sir. Stop this, Zod while there's still time. Haven't given up lecturing me, have you, even in death? I will not let you use the Codex like this. You don't have the power to stop me. The command key I have entered is revoking your authority. This ship is now under my control. Norlhcom, Lightning 1, request. - .permission to unleash the hounds. - Lightning 1 you are clear to engage. Send battle damage assessment when able. Out. Avionics are going haywire. The gravity field is pulling our missiles down. We gotta get closer. All right, everybody we're leaving. We're leaving the building now. I just lost my wingman. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Everybody, this way! Come on! Everybody, come on! Keep moving, keep moving. Jenny! Oh, my God. Perry! Go! There! Go! Our people can co-exist. So we can suffer through years of pain trying to adapt like your son has? - You're talking about genocide. - Yes. And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost. We're both ghosts, Zod. Can't you see that? The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone. Ship, have you managed to quarantine this invasive intelligence? - You'll fail. - I have. Then prepare to terminate it. - I'm tired of this debate. Silencing me won't change anything. My son is twice the man you were. And he will finish what we started. I can promise you that. Tell me you have Jor-El's memories, his conscience. Can you experience his pain? I will harvest the Codex from your son's corpse and I will rebuild Krypton. ..atop his bones. Argh! Jenny. - Jenny. Jenny, where are you? - I'm here! - I'm here. Here. - Jenny. Hold on, hold on. I'm stuck. - I can't get free. I'm stuck. - Okay. We'll get you out of there, all right? Just sit tight. No, no, no! - Don't leave me. - We're not gonna leave you. - Okay. - Lombard! - Get your ass over here and help me. - Damn it. - We just gotta move this. - Here. Slide that in. You push, I'll pull, okay? Go. - Push! - Oh, my God. It's getting closer! Come on, push! Northcom, this is Guardian. Are we cleared? Negative, Guardian. Come on! Push! Ahh! Argh! He did it. Northcom, this is Guardian. We're passing through phase line red. Good to go. Godspeed, Guardian. Arm the package. You are cleared hot. We're lining up for the final run. It's up to you and Hamilton now. You gotta be kidding me. Loadmaster, is the package ready to drop? Negative, Guardian. There's something wrong. It's not supposed to do this. What's it supposed to do? - It's supposed to go in all the way. - Let me take a look. 'Se-pilot's aircraft. Sea-pilot's aircraft. We are lined up for the drop. What's the hold up? We've had a setback. Target that aircraft. Target locked. Stop! If you destroy this ship you destroy Krypton! Krypton had its chance. Argh! Miss Lane! It's not safe for you over there! Miss Lane! Ah! Move now! Go! A good death is its own reward. Ah! Ah! Argh! Are they gone? I think so. He saved us. You know, they say it's all downhill after the first kiss. I'm pretty sure that only counts when you're kissing a human. Look at this. We could have built a new Krypton in this squalor. But you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the sole purpose for which I was born. And every action I take no matter how violent or how cruel is for the greater good of my people. And now I have no people. My soul that is what you have taken from me. I'm going to make them suffer, Kal. These humans you've adopted, I will take them all from you one by one. - You're a monster, Zod and I'm gonna stop you. Argh! Argh! There's only one way this ends, Kal. Either you die or I do. Unh! I was bred to be a warrior, Kal. Trained my entire life to master my senses. Where did you train? On a farm? Argh! If you love these people so much you can mourn for them. Don't do this! Stop! Stop! Never. Ahh! Are you effing stupid? It's one of your surveillance drones. That's a $12,000,000 piece of hardware. It was. I know you're trying to find out where I hang my cape. - You won't. - Then I'll ask the obvious question: How do we know you won't one day act against America's interests? I grew up in Kansas, general. I'm about as American as it gets. Look I'm hereto help but it has to be on my own terms. You have to convince Washington of that. Even if I were willing to try, what makes you think they'd listen? I don't know, general. Guess I'll just have to trust you. What are you smiling about? Nothing, sir. I just think he's kind of hot. - Get in the car, captain. - Mm-hm. Yes, sir. He always believed you were meant for greater things. And that when the day came your shoulders would be able to bear the weight. Yeah, I just wish he could have been here to see it finally happen. He saw it, Clark, believe me. What are you going to do when you're not saving the world? - Have you given any thought to that? - I have, actually. Heh, heh. I gotta find a job where I can keep my ear to the ground. Where people won't look twice when I want to go somewhere dangerous and start asking questions. Come on, Lois. When are you gonna throw me a bone? Courtside seats to the game tonight. - What do you say? - I say you should go back to trolling the intern pool. You'll probably have more luck. Sorry. Courtside? - Don't. Ha, ha, ha. - No. Lombard, Lane, I want you to meet our new stringer. I want you to show him the ropes. This is Clark Kent. Good luck, kid. Hey. Steve. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Hi. Lois Lane. Welcome to the Planet. Glad to be here, Lois. Simple. See? Child's play. Like landing an old albatross. <i>- Well, Rittmeister. - Von Richthofen.</i> - Voss. Werner Voss. - Voss. This is Lieutenant Ernest Udet. - Lieutenant. - Welcome. And Hermann Goering. Honored. <i>- Do you play, Rittmeister? - I never play, Lieutenant.</i> Do you intend to give me an in, Richthofen? The game is to take, Lieutenant, not to give. You play very well, Baron. Thank you, Major. Regrettable that one can't fly a billiard table, isn't it? Or that one should fly as if his craft were a billiard table. - Sir, the landing. - That's all right. I think you'll do. We'll work on the flying. - Sir? - Yes. If you'd rather I flew with another squadron. No, no. I like the way you play billiards. - Did you have a cold trip of it, Baron? - Sir? Yes, sir. Well, you found your quarry. All that was left of him. Do you want to remember your first kill, Richthofen? Yeah. I want to remember them all. That's what victory's about, isn't it, sir? I have to admit I don't know what victory is all about, Richthofen. But as for remembering the men you've killed, you needn't worry about that. <i>By the way, Rittmeister, what's the stall speed of your aircraft?</i> I don't know, sir. What's the sheer strength of the fabric of your plane's wing? I don't know, sir. Well, I took this little trophy from the wing of your plane while you were out there chasing that Frenchman. But for God, he would have been drinking with his comrades and you would have been out there in the mud. <i>Never fly straight and level for more than 30 seconds at a time.</i> <i>If you do, you present an easy target to the enemy.</i> <i>Keep your head turning as though it were mounted on a swivel.</i> <i>Feel your way after the other plane so that you can drop into a loop</i> <i>without losing the enemy.</i> Close in. Close in fast. Hi. Get right around, pull in. Get right around behind him. Try to get in as close as you can. <i>You got to get very close in, right on top of him.</i> <i>Watch out for a lame duck.</i> <i>He may be a part of a trap</i> <i>in which you will become the hunted instead of the hunter.</i> <i>Only fight when the tactical advantage is in your favor,</i> <i>and then make every bullet count.</i> Hit your target fast from out of the sun. Look, don't put your hand in front of the sun like that, put your thumb in front of the sun. See what I mean? Right there. You can see all around you. All right. Let's go. Well? Number 10 squadron was hurt. The Germans have two down. - All of ours are coming back. - Good. Good. - They weren't up in strength, then? - Strength enough. We were lucky to manage a draw, more or less. I see the new planes have come. Now we can have a go at them. Hound them. Yes, wouldn't that be nice, the hares become hounds. I hear the AA is a far better plane. Kill you, if you don't watch out. I beg your pardon? Short of span, you lose lift. Don't know what you're doing, you're dead. Yes, they say at least 120. That's with the spanner squeezed to 200. These are 190s. They give you 1,000 feet more ceiling. Got to get above the sons of bitches. I don't think we've met. Are you assigned in this area? Brown. I just came in. I'm supposed to look up the old boy who runs number 24 squadron. And I am the old boy who runs number 24 squadron. Well, nice to be here. I figure you can use me. That's what I figure. I shall have to find something for you to do. You have orders? I was 890 feet per minute. Set at 21,000 feet half the afternoon. Very nice. - You're American, aren't you? - I'm Canadian. - Well, it's half American, isn't it? - It's half British, too. - Say, that's the Victoria Cross, isn't it? - Yes, it is. They say it's hard to get. The only people I've ever heard of getting it are. Dead. Yeah. Manfred, they confirmed the S.E.5 about an hour ago. It almost fell on one of our artillery positions. And that makes you an ace. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. I had my sights right on him. I mean, there was nothing he could do. I waved him down, but he wouldn't have it. He fought like a cornered rat, so I gave him. I blasted half the ground around him. Christ, this goddamn weather. A cold hangs on, no way to get rid of it. Werner, you need a rest. The surgeon said. You leave it to me as to when I get my rest. He ran right into my bullets, you see? Little brother. I. Well, I came to get your autograph, Baron von Richthofen. Werner, this is my brother, Lothar. - Werner Voss. - God, another one. There'll be no British planes left for the rest of us. You have already flown combat, haven't you? Some. Certainly not as much as all of you. Everyone knows Udet, Wolff, and Voss. - What the hell is this, Goering? - It's nothing. It isn't anything. It's damn well something. If it's anything like the last one, a naked girl on velvet with her legs all. Come on, let me see it. Come on. Well? It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Happens to be a steal at 30,000 marks. It's all right. <i>Gentlemen, to Rittmeister Richthofen and his trench victory.</i> And to our squadron. May it continue as it has begun, in the service of the fatherland. A toast to a distinguished young foe. <i>I give you Rittmeister Baron von Richthofen.</i> To von Richthofen. - To von Richthofen. I say, Thompson, who is that fellow over there? Oh, don't you know? It's the new Canadian fellow, Brown. A cultural note, Lieutenant Brown, there is a custom among us called the toast. It takes place when gentlemen rise and drink to an object of mutual esteem. It is expected that all gentlemen present take part. I'd rather pass, Lieutenant. Is it that you don't care for our wine? Oh, well, he can't drink anyway, you know. - And why not? - Ulcers. He takes something white for them. Would you like to take the toast in milk, Mr. Brown? Your von Richthofen is not an object of my esteem, Lieutenant, and I won't drink to the bastard in wine or milk. Gentlemen, that's quite enough. I'm sorry you feel as you do, Lieutenant Brown. You don't have to explain to him, Major. We believe, Lieutenant Brown, that men can be enemies without becoming beasts. Those who survive this business will find they still have need of those traditions which separates gentlemen from savages. I'll save my wine for the next gentleman your German knight blasts out of the sky. Good evening, gentlemen. Racist bugger. Leave his wine, anyhow. Let it stay at his place and go sour. We have to hit them harder, gentlemen. We have the advantage now, but we can't keep it forever. We have to the win while we still have it. All right, now, watch out for those new S.E.s, they're very fast. Very fast. Richthofen. I wasn't speaking to you alone, you know. I don't expect you to win the war single-handed. Why not, Major? Because I need you. There aren't many men like you. Another year of this, there will be even fewer. In a year's time, we will be having our lunch in London. Manfred, you know, sometimes I think you don't hear anything I tell you. Do you really think you'll live forever? Every moment I'm in the air with these Spandaus in my hands, that's forever. Good luck. Stay in the sun. Boelke's dead because of that damn clown from the provinces. Easy. - Von did another victory! - He didn't hit Richthofen. It was your landing gear he struck. Why the hell didn't you pull up? It was Von you hit, wasn't it? Wasn't it? So that's it. I don't have a "von" in front of my name. You're all a bunch of peasants. You let him get away with murder because he's Baron von Richthofen. I did what I felt was best. I thought that if I could head right for the English, as though I were going ram him he. I owed Boelke everything. - If I could've taken his place. - You'd like that, wouldn't you? Goddamn you, you'll never take his place. You killed him. And if they ever give this squadron to me. I'll put in for transfer 10 minutes later. If Richthofen did cause the accident, I suppose we are expected to nail a carcass to a tree. Not necessarily, Colonel. Von has choice of crucifixion or canonization. Well, now, obviously the squadron needs a new leader. But then, there are several choices. - Voss, Goering. - I know Voss. If you choose Voss, we'll be back here next week doing this all over again. To be perfectly candid, sir, I prefer Goering. I like his way of thinking. But it won't work. The people won't warm to him. And as for the politicians, well, what they really need is a man for Berlin. We need another Boelke. Who would Boelke have chosen? It is difficult to know how one may bid farewell to such a comrade. I can say to you only these words. Who will defend this army, older than the empire itself? War is both king of all and father of all. Some it has revealed as gods, others as men. What's he doing up there? Why did they give him the decoration? Who knows? It doesn't mean anything. The hell it doesn't. I wonder what they'd give him if he got us all killed. Well, he's only 23. Do you gentlemen remember what it was like to be 23? I was never 23. If I had been, I'd remember. Come in. Ah, Richthofen. Von Richthofen, I believe. Good to see you. Come, shall we have a drink? You know Boelke thought a deal of you, Baron. He was more than kind to me. We are going to give you the squadron, von Richthofen. Well, what do you think of that? I think that would be very nice. To Baron Manfred von Richthofen, may he lead as did Boelke, his teacher. And hunt the British from the skies. And live to enjoy his reward. <i>Herr Rittmeister, you started the war as a cavalry officer, yeah?</i> <i>RICHTHOFEN.: Yeah.</i> <i>So now, how does it feel to fly? To fight in the sky?</i> <i>My ancestors were Teutonic knights, sir.</i> <i>I merely exchanged the horse for an airplane.</i> <i>I see. Then the flying is just a means to an end?</i> <i>The flying is wonderful, but it's the hunt that I find more satisfying.</i> <i>The stalking, the chase, and, finally, the kill.</i> <i>The climax.</i> <i>Then you enjoy it, then? The war?</i> <i>Oh, what shall I say?</i> <i>War is the father of nations.</i> <i>It makes them slaves or it makes them free.</i> <i>Victory brings with it a climax, a sense of fulfilment.</i> <i>But the danger every day, every minute, while you are in the air?</i> <i>I never think of it.</i> <i>It's like the weather. Always there.</i> <i>But when you hunt, you think of what you're hunting, don't you?</i> Oh, good morning. It's a lovely day. Come down. You understand? I have a motorcycle. We can go for a ride by the river. Daffodils. How do you say? Come down. Come on. Come down. I have to go. Do you understand? I'm a pilot. I have to go fight the Germans. I'll try to come back. What the hell do you mean, "Paint them"? How can you conceal an airplane? You're out of your mind. <i>What do I know how, Herr Rittmeister?</i> They gave me this order. It says, "Paint them". Look. Holzapfel, should a man hide from his enemies? <i>That depends, Herr Rittmeister.</i> Should a gentleman hide from his enemies? <i>No, Herr Rittmeister, he should not.</i> Then perhaps we should. What the hell is this? "Paint them". - It's so stupid. - It says, "Paint multicolored, in order to obscure the character and shape of the craft". Right. Multicolored. Udet, Goering, all of you, call out your crewmen. Tell them it's special duty. Lothar, you and Holzapfel, get over to Supply, get me every can of paint you can find and plenty of brushes. - What colors? - Every color in the rainbow. Germany's bid for a voice in the destiny of Europe, gentlemen, is more than a war. It's a crusade. <i>- And what does that call for? - Rationing, Herr Major?</i> <i>It calls for sacrifice, Herr Richter.</i> Young leaders who are totally dedicated. <i>You've all heard of the exploits of Baron von Richthofen and Boelke's Jasta.</i> Yellow. Yellow. Blue. - Blue. - Blue. They'll transfer every damn one of us to the infantry. I'll be roasting rats on the Somme. I got them. Good, Lothar. That's wonderful. <i>I think I'll take some black first and paint a Fraulein on my brother's, yeah?</i> Now, what color shall we paint my plane? - What do you think? - Well, I think it's fine. My God! They'll see it 20 miles away. They represent the best in Germany today. If one is embarking on a crusade, these are the knights that one would want to. <i>To hire, Herr Major?</i> <i>You are a cynic, Herr Richter.</i> They are just completing some work on their aircrafts. They may be tired, keyed up. Take that into consideration, gentlemen. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up! Let's finish this thing here. God! Wait till the son of bitches get here. The sons of bitches are here, Lieutenant. Gentlemen, it's good to see you. <i>Rittmeister, perhaps you can explain this.</i> We're following orders, Colonel. <i>Come now, Rittmeister, the orders were clear enough.</i> A triumph of clarity. They said, "Paint the planes". To render them unobtrusive. It said, "Paint them multicolored to obscure the character and shape". I think they have you there, Cargonico. God knows, they are multicolored. Whatever character or shape they may have is fairly well obscured. But this is preposterous. Everyone in the air service knows we are using brown and green lozenges for camouflage. I beg the Colonel's pardon. We are German fighting men, not English sparrows. The Emperor may command that we die, but no one has the right to command that we hide. Gentlemen, naturally I approve your sentiment. But this display, it's fantastic. It's a circus, Colonel Cargonico, a flying circus. A win for the black. Come on, there's another one there. Your father's fine. Your mother sends her love, so does my sister. That's nice. How the hell did you get over here so quickly? I thought you were in school. I was. Till one of my teachers said this would be the last one. - Last what? - Last war, of course. So you see, Roy, I had to come. I mean, we'll be the last soldiers, won't we? The others who come after will envy us. Oh, well played, sir. - Yeah, you'll fit in plenty well around here. - I hope so. They all talk that kind of horse shit. No, no. Easy, easy, easy. Watch his arm. Oh, jeez! Well, he's dead. - Roy. - His name was Kenyon. You think the next generation will envy him? There was no need for that. He couldn't have hurt them anymore, could he? Of course, he could have. If he'd gotten out alive, he could've been flying again tomorrow. Mr. Brown, some of the squadron feel that your gesture the other evening was disrespectful to Major Hawker. Well, they're wrong. But that doesn't matter. I'll stay clear of the mess, so they can go on toasting von Richthofen and his gang. I very much doubt they'll be toasting the Germans again. - That's one point you made. - It wasn't my point, sir. Lanoe Hawker and I. We believed in the same things. We belong to that other world that you have no use for. And now I wonder, who will see us through? Just men. No more knights. Just Thompsons, Murphys, Mays, and Browns. If you don't win with them, sir, there's really no other way. I suspect that's why I despise you a little, Brown. Sir? Because, unfortunately, I'm forced to agree with you. <i>Rittmeister Baron Manfred von Richthofen,</i> you are called to His Majesty, the Emperor. It's fine killing the English up there, isn't it? Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, yes. I only wish I were with you. The hardest part of the war is not being at the front. Of course, Your Majesty. They betrayed us, you know? The British. They sold us like cabbages to the French. They are not fit for empire. But we'll see to that. Go back now, Richthofen. Go back and butcher another 40 of the sons of bitches. As you wish, Your Majesty. <i>Oh, Herr Baron. That is, Rittmeister.</i> Either will do. The guard said it would be all right. I explained to him the purpose. Perhaps you would like to explain it to me? I'm Steiner, sir, I. You know, I brought the. Of course, the jeweler. So pleased to meet you at last. - I want to say. - Yeah? I want to say what a privilege it is to me to. To supply you with these trophies. I. I feel. When I read in the newspapers of your. Your successes, I. I somehow feel as if I was up there in the sky along with you. <i>That's very kind of you, Herr Steiner.</i> <i>- Thank you very much. - Thank you, Herr Baron.</i> Won't you stay for a drink? Oh, no, thank you. I think I'd better be getting along. <i>Goodbye, Herr Baron.</i> Isn't it grand, von Richthofen? In just a few hours, you've conquered Berlin. Only a temporary occupation, Major. Excuse me, Colonel, tomorrow Berlin will belong to the bureaucrats again. Well, let me present your host, Anthony Fokker. The most important man in the air service next to yourself. <i>Oh, you're most kind, Herr Oberst.</i> <i>Let me welcome you to my house, Herr Rittmeister.</i> - You've been a long time coming. - Pardon me? Well, they've all been here. Himmelmann, Boelke, Schröder. Of course, we talked about war planes. Good evening. The problems of building them, flying them, naturally. <i>Your planes are famous, Herr Fokker. They deserve to be.</i> Please. You know, I've always wanted to talk to you. I want to draw upon your experience, show you some ideas of mine. Thank you. I can imagine better planes than some I've flown. Perhaps I can show you one. This is the new Pegasus. My God, Fokker, it's. Go on, say it. It's not a crime for a soldier to admire something beautiful. It is. You know, I never planned it to be this way. I designed it to be as beautiful and as precise as a bird of prey. Somehow it came out this way. Beautiful. - Is she fast? - Fast enough. It's her manoeuvrability that makes her so special. - How about response? - Fabulous. I've tried her. She's up to anything that you could require. - Well, she looks dangerous. - Not for you, my friend. She's. If I may so, she's just your meat. You can handle her without a doubt. Now, I really must get back to my guests. So, if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you two to look over my lady. He talks a great deal. He was trying to sell me. Did you need to be sold? It's a fine piece of design. It's where I live. Talk about luck. No jamming at all. Like hell. It's spacing and pyro load. A guy from the machine gun corps helped me. From now on, you load your own. My God, how long will that take? How long you figure to be dead? There goes St. Francis of the Machine. Engines purr beneath his hands, motorbikes cough with his blessing, and guns. Why, machine guns sing their hearts out at the sight of him. The way you screwed yours up, Murphy, they got to love you, too. You bastard! You'll never have the brains and the guts that Hawker had. I got one thing up on Hawker. Still alive. I can fix that! Stop him! All right, mate. You that bad a marksman, Murphy? Can't you shoot a man in the back? How did they get Hawker, Murphy? Huh? How did they kill him? You better start practicing back-shooting, mister. Preliminaries are over. You want us to forget we're human. All right, damn you, I've forgotten. No. I want you to remember why we're here. I want you to think about killing. When the job is killing you, study the work of first-class killers. For example? Wolves, Mr. Thompson. They hunt in packs. They've been known to leave the carcass of their prey to lure other animals. Bait? It's Richthofen. He cost us Reiner and Powell. It's for you. - And who are you, sir? - I am Manfred, sir. Manfred? There's no Manfred here. You're von Richthofen. You understand? You're von Richthofen. What is your name? Who are you? Richthofen. I don't think I understand just what you have in mind. Well, it's like he says, sir. You wish to raid the German aerodrome? About 5:30 or 6:00 in the evening. About supper time, I believe. Yes, sir, about that time. A little after tea. Well, Commander? Well, I must think about it, gentlemen. I can't help wondering where it may lead. Major Hawker's dead, sir. This is your idea, isn't it, Brown? Think of it this way, sir. It's simply our turn to bat. - Was anything stirring out there? - A few pigeons. Nothing much. <i>Herr Parsonow came by. He said there was a boar pestering his corn.</i> I said I'd tell you. A boar would be nice. - It's been. -1913. - June, I think. - What? Your last boar. Lothar said you handled him badly. And you. My God, how do you manage it? How do you remember? I remember whatever has to do with my sons. Whatever matters to them, matters to me. But what matters to you, Mother? What really matters to you? My sons. You're feeling better, my boy? - Well enough to go back, I think. - Good. Very good. There is a great deal left we have to do to end this war. That will be a fine thing, Father. When this is over, we'll have to put things to their rights. We'll use the army to clean out the socialist rabble. Put things back to rights, Father? Do you really think so? Workers Party. Peasants presuming to make policy this war will put an end to. Things will be different when it's over. That's a safe judgment, Father. Last night, I was reading the history of Frederick the Great and his son, Manfred, the Teutonic knight. A great hero. Your name, my boy. Do you suppose he enjoyed the sun? One should. In Italy, he fought against great odds. He died. Was buried on the field. To live forever. To be disinterred by his enemies, and his bones left to bleach on the banks of a river. The German people forget nothing. Except the name of his favorite stallion and the town where his mistress lived. I wish you had married, or even. There was no time. - How long does it take a man to. - Forget himself? - Not so long as it takes to love. - Certainly. Still, I would like to see what the future holds for us. I believe that's the last thing you want, Father. After the war, we'll set things right again. It'll be like it was before. For God's sake, move those planes! Get my plane started. We'll show those bastards! Come, let's get them! Switches off. - Where are you hit? - I don't know. Oh, God, look at my leg. - I feel like I've got a damn. - It's hell back there. They wrecked every plane in the line. Nobody got off the ground. It's like the trenches. They brought the trenches to us. The whole, bloody, sweet, safe world, going up in flames, it was. It was lovely. It was. It was lovely. Lieutenant, have you any count on aircrafts destroyed? Anywhere from 15 to 20. Everything visible was hit. - What about personnel? - I beg your pardon? He means, how many of the bastards did we kill? We killed plenty. They were still in the mess hall. We thought if we hit them at supper time, it would be rather like. The last supper. You destroyed the ammunition and hit the officers' mess. What about the barracks? May, you hit the long brown building. Yes, I hit that twice. I bet that was the barracks. No. No, that would be the hospital. Am I to understand that my people have bombed a hospital? Did you see a Red Cross flag in front of the building or painted on top of it? There was so much smoke, I couldn't see anything. Then it wasn't a hospital, was it? I beg your pardon, Major. Does the placement of a flag determine a hospital? The Hague Convention makes clear that the absence of such marking. Would the presence of wounded men, and doctors and nurses, have anything to do with your classification? Essentially, no. Colonel, I'm afraid the cricket match is over. You'll be receiving detailed orders soon for strafing attacks, ambushes of officer personnel, destruction of all classes of supplies, including medical. Are there any limits left, Major? We didn't initiate this raising of the stakes, but we have to match them, of course. Really no choice. Is there? <i>Herr Rittmeister, thank God you're back. The British, they.</i> Everything's gone all to hell. Lothar. Where's my brother? They shot him. They strafed him on the field while he was taking off. - Where is he? - He's alive. He got a bullet in the leg. Do you want to see him? Later. We have an entire squadron to put back together. What do we have left? You mean planes? Hell, take a look around you. It would take two days just to find parts enough to put one together. Call Werner. Have him meet me over by the hangar. What? Voss. I want Voss. I need him. Now! <i>Herr Rittmeister, Voss died the day you fell.</i> Of course. That's right. I remember. I want a status report from all officers. I don't want hysterical surmise. I want to know if there are any planes we can fly, how soon we can get replacements, and when we'll be able to land on the field next. I want each of you. Who's in charge around here? I'm von Richthofen. What have you got there? What do I have? I have a baker's dozen of planes for you. Fokker's planes. All right. Let's get them uncrated and assembled. Everyone will have to do the work of three men if we want to attack the British this afternoon. We didn't lose a plane. That's the beauty of it. It's only the beginning. And with the Americans here. Oh, my God! We'll smash them to pieces. You don't seem very happy about that. Oh, I feel fine about it. It's just that I thought we could throw off the pretense. Get on with it. You're right. I wonder if that Hawker didn't know something. What? What could he have known? That we have to pretend to go mad. I think you've been at it too long. After all, we're not talking about philosophy. War is a problem in applied physics. Isn't it? Yeah, a problem in physics. Flag party, present arms. You bastards! My God! My God! I thought we had wiped them out. No, we've made a mistake. A miscalculation, like in physics. Goering. Lieutenant Goering. Sir? You left formation over the British aerodrome. You were seen strafing medical personnel. <i>I did my duty, Herr Rittmeister.</i> - It was my judgment. - You have no judgment. And all your judgment does is win you silver trophies while we lose the war. God damn it! What is the sense of playing with them? Tomorrow there'll be at us again. If I were in command, I'd bomb them, strafe them, gas them! Attention! What the hell would you do with a command? You don't make war. You're not a soldier. You're an assassin! The soldiers are losing. I make war to win. It doesn't matter how. It may come to that, but it will not start in my squadron. Get out of my sight. And Goering. Sir? If you should make another such judgment, you needn't concern yourself with the command, because I'll go to the Emperor to see you shot. <i>Lieutenant Brown, the readers of The Toronto Star want to know</i> <i>about Canada's newest ace.</i> <i>What is there to know?</i> <i>- I'm just a technician. I change things. - Change things?</i> <i>Put a plane in front of me with a man in it,</i> <i>I change them into a wreck and a corpse.</i> <i>Well, how do you like France?</i> <i>Yeah, it's a nice country, isn't it?</i> <i>Lots of my friends will be staying after the war.</i> <i>How do you like the French girls, Lieutenant?</i> <i>With both their arms and legs, I think.</i> <i>The German planes, are they dangerous?</i> <i>The Germans, they're dangerous. Planes, they're dangerous too.</i> <i>They kill as many Germans as we do.</i> <i>The same way ours do us.</i> <i>But now that we outnumber the Germans, we're winning, aren't we?</i> <i>How in Christ's name do I know?</i> <i>I go out in the morning and try to stay alive till I run out of petrol.</i> <i>One day I come back and they tell me that I'm an ace.</i> <i>But you've shot down eight German planes.</i> <i>Is it eight?</i> <i>God almighty, I thought it was 100.</i> <i>I keep shooting them down but he's always up there again in the morning.</i> <i>How the hell do I know who's winning the war?</i> <i>One of these mornings.</i> <i>- One of these mornings it'll all be over. - How can it be over?</i> <i>There's still some of us alive.</i> <i>They wouldn't end it with any of us still alive, now would they?</i> Gunther! Holzapfel, call Gunther. My God, Manfred! Voss, Wolff. Who's next? We're all next, little brother. Now I know how pheasants must feel in the autumn. They promise you a safe war when you enlisted? Enlist? Hell, they drafted me. I was in the Ministry of Defense. Could've been a junior secretary by now. I didn't know they drafted men into the flying service. They've just begun. Is there anything wrong? I just wish to hell they'd paint these damn planes a nice drab brown. The English can see us a mile away. Hey, look, here come the Yanks. Oh, hey, I want some beer, boys. Look at that, William. How could we lose now? How do you mean? Spare parts for the machines, Brown, 100 million of them. We'll swamp the damn Krauts. How can we lose? - Hey. Take it easy, buddy. - Hey, you're American, huh? - No, I'm Canadian. - Well, that's half American, ain't it? <i>We've only to come to speak to you, von Richthofen, about the future.</i> <i>Germany's and yours.</i> <i>The general intelligence picture is bleak.</i> <i>Colonel Trackl, your report.</i> <i>Within six months, the general Allied offensive,</i> <i>strengthened by a number of American divisions, will begin.</i> It is clear that the offensive will be terminal. We will be pushed back to the Rhine in the first phase. And in the second phase, we will be invaded. So you will understand, von Richthofen, why I am removing you from the flying roster. You mean the squadron is to stand down? Well, no. As a matter of fact, the squadron will be pressed into ever more hazardous service. You mean, I am removed from active duty alone? You do understand the reasons for this, don't you? We are forced to plan for the future. We must organize now. So next time, the Jews and the Communists and the merchants won't have a chance to stab us in the back. You could, if you wish to accept, become chief test pilot for my company. We would be producing designs suitable for modification to military use. We will be designing racing planes, don't you see? <i>Well, Herr Rittmeister, what do you have to say?</i> I say, you're all insane. Damn it, Richthofen, we're going to lose this war! But nobody at the top is willing to admit it. If there's going to be a future Germany, somebody has to move. I don't give a damn about your future plans, your next war. Captain, we are speaking to you as an equal. I am not your equal. I'm a solider. I have 30 men fighting for their lives. I will not stand down. I made you. I picked you up and made you. - Now I hope the British blast you! - Never doubt it, General. They will. Roy, what the hell are you doing in here alone? It's time to fly. Yeah. I'm ready. Buck up, old man, it's almost over. Before the leaves fall. It'll never be over. One day, they'll change the system of dating. "B.C." will mean "before combat". "A.D." will mean "after death". Come off it. They can't kill us all. What's the difference? We're already dead. <i>"Esteemed Herr Rittmeister,</i> because of war shortages, we beg to inform that the silver required to make your small cups is no longer available. We can, however, supply an identical cup made up in base metal plated with tin". - I should've gone for that boar, brother. - What? Nothing. I'll have to write Steiner. I don't want his tin cups. Would you like to tell me what happened at that meeting yesterday? The others all left looking as if they were headed for Switzerland. Wasn't anything. Just routine. Let's go. I'd like to take a look at this when you get back. I had to rebuild some of the parts. I feel like I've been in this plane forever. <i>I think it'll all be over soon, Herr Rittmeister.</i> What happened with Goering, isn't he flying? He received a call from von Höppner. He's been grounded. That's odd. Not really. Switches off. - Impossible! - Way to go, Brown! What a fighter! <i>To the Richthofen Jasta!</i> And its new commander. Wrong, as usual. The United States' lack of action in Eastern Europe proves that the Soviet Union's aggression at the Afghan border will not be opposed publicly by the United States. Issue: The Soviet Union continued its recent series of military exercises conducting a bomb test today in the Bering Sea just 1500 miles off the southern coast of Alaska. President Richard Nixon issued this warning to the Soviets: The United States does not start fights. Let it be clear we maintain our strength in order to maintain peace so any adversary should ask themselves: "Do the consequences of attacking America outweigh the potential benefits?" As a result of the Soviet activity the watchdog group of nuclear scientists moved the Doomsday Clock up to five minutes until midnight: Destruction by nuclear war. Question: On a scale of zero to 10, zero meaning impossibility 10 meaning complete metaphysical certitude what are the chances the Russians will actually attack the United States? Pat Buchanan. Zero. The Soviets would never risk going to war when we have a walking nuclear deterrent on our side. You're referring, of course, to Dr. Manhattan but does Dr. Manhattan's existence guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift. Well, it hasn't stopped the Soviet Union from stockpiling record amounts of nuclear weapons. You don't think it's just posturing? Maybe the reason why the Soviets are doing these bomb tests is because they feel threatened by Dr. Manhattan. Of course. Maybe the whole world feels like that. Soviet ships have violated the territorial waters- Just a matter of time, I suppose. It's a joke. It's all a joke. Mother, forgive me. I was a hero, goddamn it! - An act clearly meant to send a signal to the government in Saigon that violence and oppression is not the way to peace. Fuck you, pigs! Good luck, Mr. Gorsky. Get out of here, vigilantes! No! Edward Blake. Sixty-seven years old. Six-two, a solid 225. Guy was built like a linebacker. Yeah, I saw the body. For a guy his age, he was in terrific shape. You mean apart from being dead? That's plate glass. You'd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in it. Had to have been thrown. Check the bedroom? Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through. Mattress flipped. Probably robbery. Or made to look like one. See this? - Shaking hands with the president. Whoa. Think Blake was a spook? Government or black ops? I think this is way bigger than both of us. Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985. Dog carcass in alley this morning. Tire tread on burst stomach. This city's afraid of me. I've seen its true face. The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood. And when the drains finally scab over all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up around their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout, "Save us." And I'll whisper, "No." Now the whole world stands on the brink staring down into bloody hell. All those liberals and intellectuals and smooth talkers and all of a sudden, nobody can think of anything to say. Beneath me, this awful city. It screams like an abattoir full of retarded children and the night reeks of fornication and bad consciences. Huh. Tonight, a comedian died in New York. Somebody knows why. Somebody knows. No, I definitely heard something. Watch the door. Shh. Must've been the wind. Next time you- It all started with the gangs. You know, people tend to forget that. Pirate outfits, ghosts. They thought it was funny: Dress up and pull heists. As soon as we'd arrest them, they'd be back on the street. Nobody could pick them out of a lineup because of the damn masks. So a few of us cops, we get together and we figure, what the heck, we'll mask up, too. We'll finish what the law couldn't. Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it. They ran with it and oh, boy, we're a national pastime. It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice Silk Spectre and the Comedian. Oh, don't get me started on him. I must be drunk already, telling you this sob story again. I think you were trying to make a point. Well, my point is that we had it too easy. It wasn't fair what happened to you guys- You guys who picked up where we left off. - With Nixon forcing you out. Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted for that prick five times. Hey, it was him or the commies, right? Oh, wow, it's almost midnight. Gotta go. Truth? You were a better Nite Owl than I ever was, Danny boy. - Hollis, we both know that's bullshit. - Hey. Watch it with the language. This is the left hook that floored Captain Axis, remember? - Yeah. This just in: The masked vigilante known as Rorschach has assaulted a police officer in the early-morning hours. Rorschach is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes six years ago. Rorschach reportedly incapacitated. Forced everyone out except him. Oh, he'll quit. When he's dead. Next week? Well you know, you don't have to keep humoring me like this. If you got a hot date or something. Hey, us retired guys have to stick together, right? You ever miss it? No. You? Oh, heck, no. Be seeing you. Hello, Daniel. Rorschach. Helped myself to some beans. Hope you don't mind. No, no. Course not. You want me to heat those up for you? Fine like this. How have you been keeping? Out of prison. Heard about you on the news. Say you attacked a cop. Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization. Daniel look at this. Is this bean juice? Human bean juice. Badge belonged to the Comedian. Blood too. He's dead. Let's talk downstairs. It could have been a burglary. Maybe the killer didn't know who the Comedian was. An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous. I heard he'd been working for the government since '77 knocking over Marxist republics in South America. Maybe it was a political killing or something. Maybe. Maybe someone's picking off costumed heroes. You don't think that's a little paranoid? That what they say about me now? Paranoid? Look, Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years even among his friends. Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason? He wrote that book. Said some bad things about the Comedian in it. I don't like what you're implying, and I like being followed even less. Maybe I was keeping an eye on you, in case someone's gunning for masks. - You were never that sentimental. - Attack on one is attack on all of us. What do you suggest we do about it? Retribution. - Watchmen are over. - Says Tricky Dick. Says me. Nobody knows who you are. You can give it up, try and have a normal life. That what you have now? A normal life? When you walk down the street in a city dying of rabies past the human cockroaches talking about their heroin and child pornography do you really feel normal? Least I'm not the one still hiding behind a mask. No. You're hiding in plain sight. Be seeing you, Dan. A maintenance hatch will let you out two blocks north. Yeah, I remember. Came here often, when we were partners. Those were great times, huh, Rorschach? - What happened? - You quit. Rorschach's journal. First visit of evening fruitless. Feel slightly depressed. Soon there will be war. Millions will perish in sickness and misery. Why does one death matter against so many? Because there is good and evil, and evil must be punished. Even in the face of armageddon I will not compromise in this. Mr. Veidt to date, you're one of only two Watchmen ever to reveal their true identity to the world the first being Hollis Mason. And you've certainly profited greatly by it turning your superhero alter ego, Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry: Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering. I understand there's a movie in the works. - I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth. I'm sorry. Do you think- The Watchmen resent me for prostituting their struggle? It's a fair question. Yes, it's crossed my mind some of my old colleagues might see it that way just as you're clearly aware that biased journalism sells more magazines. The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan. We recently expanded our research facility in Antarctica in the hope of developing cheap, renewable sources of energy that we might eliminate the world's reliance on fossil fuels. Now, it doesn't take a political scientist to see that our Cold War with the Russians isn't ideological it's based upon fear. Fear of not having enough. But if we make resources infinite ah we make war obsolete. I would hope the other Watchmen understand that wherever they may be. Thanks for your time. - You look good, Adrian. - Dan. It's been too long. So Rorschach thinks someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh? You think it's possible? Statistically, one murder doesn't equal a trend. Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan. And so was the Comedian. He was practically a Nazi. You know that better than anyone. I'm not here because I miss him. It's occurred to Rorschach that we're the only ones who know each other's identities. Actually, the whole world knows yours. That's why I'm warning you first. Thank you, Dan but I fear there's something much more real to worry about than Rorschach's mask killer. If the Russians do launch their nukes, can Jon really stop them? The Soviets have 51,000 warheads stockpiled. Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them the 1 percent that get through could still kill every living thing on Earth. Even Dr. Manhattan can't be everywhere at once. Rorschach's journal, October 13th, 1985 8:30 p. M. Meeting with Dreiberg left bad taste in mouth. A flabby failure who sits whimpering in his basement. Why are so few of us left active healthy and without personality disorders? The first Nite Owl runs an auto-repair shop. The first Silk Spectre is a bloated, aging whore dying in a California rest resort. Dollar Bill got his cape stuck in a revolving door where he got gunned down. Silhouette, murdered a victim of her own indecent lifestyle. Mothman's in an asylum in Maine. Even Adrian Veidt, possible homosexual. Must investigate further. Only two names remain on my list. Both share private quarters at Rockefeller Military Research Center. I shall go to them. I shall go tell the indestructible man that someone plans to murder him. Good evening, Rorschach. Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here. Yes but you're going to leave disappointed. Rorschach. You shouldn't be here. You're a wanted man. Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre. I have a real name I've been using. Try it. Whatever you say, Laurie. What are you doing here? The Comedian is dead. Rorschach wants me to look into my future see if the killer is ever publicly identified. Already warned Dreiberg. Came to warn you too. Even if I wanted to help my future is blocked by some kind of temporal interference. - I cannot see it clearly. - Interference? Caused by what? In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust. If the United States and Soviet Union engage in all-out war the resulting blast wave would produce a sudden burst of tachyons particles which travel backward through what you perceive as time therefore obscuring my vision of the present. I must return to my work. Wait a minute. What if that's why someone wants us out of the way? So we can't do anything to stop it? Goodbye, Rorschach. Took a lot of effort to get in here to see you. I'm not leaving- till I've had my say. Seems like there's a lot of things you don't tell me these days. I didn't wanna worry you prematurely. If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis, war may be averted. But you always say time is simultaneous. If that's true, then how can you change the future? If only you could perceive time as I do. Please let me show you. Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before. I was a hero, goddamn it! It's not my fault you got old. What do you have to complain about? I'm putting food on the table for you and your child. Call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life. - It was a mistake. One time. - Man tries to rape you- Stop! Your mind goes to dark places and you wonder why I keep the worst from you. - Say hello to Dan for me. - What? You wanna ask me to go to dinner with you like we used to but you won't. You know I can't. So you'll call Dan which is only natural. You deserve the comfort of an old friend. Dan Dreiberg's table. Did you know that he and H.J. Were-? I had no idea. You remember that crazy guy? What'd he call himself? Captain Carnage. Used to pretend he was a supervillain just so he could get beat up? Yeah, he tried that on me once. I just walked away. He starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!" I'm just saying, "No, get lost." God, whatever happened to him? Oh. Um. He pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. Oh, my God. That's not even funny. - It's a little funny. - Yep. I'm glad I ordered the four-legged chicken. It's really good to see you again. It's great seeing you too. Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that? - No one else would. - Yeah, but do you remember my costume? All that tight latex? I mean, it was awful. Uh. Yeah, yeah, awful. But didn't wanna disappoint Mother. Wanted her little girl to be just like her and fight bad guys. I think the Keene Act was the best thing that ever happened to us. Well, we'll live longer anyway. What? Jon thinks, unless he can do something about it that there's gonna be nuclear war. Soon. But I don't know what to think. I mean, it's all quantum mechanics and parallel realities with him. I never even know what universe he's actually seeing. He just keeps getting further away from me. Everyone. I can't even tell if he actually cares about me anymore or if he's just pretending. If he's pretending, it means he cares. Hold on, I'll get the door. Thanks, Dan. - Got it? - Yeah. You always get a government escort to dinner? They're making sure I don't do anything to upset the country's most powerful weapon. I'm sorry. I invite you out to dinner to catch up and have a few laughs but there don't seem to be many laughs around these days. What do you expect? The Comedian's dead. Laurie? Is that you? Thought you'd be used to traveling that way by now. Well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon teleports me. Well, it beats flying coach. Margarita? Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon. Mm. Remember that guy that writes me letters? He sent me an item of memorabilia. It's a Tijuana bible. This little eight-page porno comic they did in the '30s and '40s. - He sent you this? - Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques. Mother, this is gross. I think it's kind of flattering. Why do you always call me Mother when you're mad? I know why you're here. I can still read, you know. I saw it in the paper. Eddie Blake's funeral is today. Finally got his punchline, I guess. - Poor Eddie. - Poor Eddie? After what he did to you? Oh, Laurie, you're still young. You don't know. Things change. What happened happened 40 years ago. I'm 67 years old. Every day, the future looks a little bit darker. But the past even the grimy parts of it keep on getting brighter. I've got spots in my eyes. Stop it, Eddie. - Thank you, Weegee. - Thank you, Mr. Owl. Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio. - Little place on 21 st. - Sounds good. Wow, a real photo session. Wonder how my hair will look? Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five. Eddie. What the hell are you doing here? You knew I was changing. Sure I did. Come on, baby. I know what you need. You gotta have some kind of reason for dressing in an outfit like this. I said no, Eddie. - No spelled Y-E-S. - No spelled N-O. - All right? - Come on, sweetheart. Eddie. You little bastard. This what you like? - This what makes you hot? - What? Things are tough all over, cupcake. It rains on the just and the unjust alike. The Comedian was a little bit of both. And he always thought he'd get the last laugh. Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts. Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty O holy and merciful savior. Thou most worthy judge eternal. Suffer us not at our last hour for any- Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me. You know, you'd think this goddamn country had had enough fireworks. You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam I think it might have driven us crazy. You know, as a country. But we didn't, thanks to you. You sound bitter. Me? Bitter? Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious. Oh, Jesus Christ. - Mr. Eddie? - Just what I fucking needed. The war is over now. We must talk about this baby. There's nothing to talk about. See, I'm leaving. I'm gonna forget about you and your horrible, sweaty, little piece-of-shit country. Get the fuck out of here. - No. - Get the fuck out of here. You will remember. You will remember me and my country forever! My face! Blake. Don't. Blake! She was pregnant and you gunned her down. That's right and you know what? You watched me. You could have turned the gun to steam, the bullets to mercury the bottle into goddamn snowflakes, but you didn't, did you? You really don't give a damn about human beings. You're drifting out of touch, Doc. God help us all. Medic! Most holy and merciful savior. He cometh up and is cut down, like a flower. In the midst of life, we are in death. Of whom may we seek succor, but of thee, O Lord? Welcome. We'll be starting shortly. We're waiting for one more. I told you, you wouldn't be the only one dressed up. Welcome, doctor. Now we can start. Thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves with this map of high-crime areas. This is all bullshit. For a guy who calls himself the Comedian, I can never tell when you're joking. Watchmen. That's the real joke. It didn't work 15 years ago, and it ain't gonna work now because you wanna play cowboys and Indians. Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings. Rorschach and I have made headway on the gang problem by working together. A group this size seems like a publicity stunt. I'm not in it for the ink. We can do so much more. We can save this world with the right leadership. - Yeah. And that'd be you, right, Ozzy? I mean, hell, you're the smartest man on the planet. It doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems. But it takes a room of morons to think they're small enough for you to handle. You people. You hear Moloch's back in town, get your panties all in a bunch. - You think catching him matters? - Justice matters. Justice. Justice is coming to all of us. No matter what the fuck we do. You know, mankind's been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time. Now we finally have the power to finish the job. Ain't nothing gonna matter once those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust. Then Ozymandias here will be the smartest man on the cinder. For as much as it hath pleased almighty God to take onto himself the soul of our dear departed brother let us therefore commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes. Watchmen! Police! Police to protect the people! Attention, citizens. We are trying to maintain order. You must clear the streets until the police strike is over. If you could- Please, there's no need for violence. We are trying to retain order on the streets until the police strike is over. Crawl back in your holes before you get hurt. - I got rubber bullets. I want my rights! - You are not the law! We want regular cops! No more vigilantes! My son's a police officer, you fucking faggots! Goddamn it. All right. That's how you wanna do it? There's no need for violence. Fuck you. Fuck you! Oh, this is getting heavy. Goddamn, I love working on American soil, Dan. Ain't had this much fun since Woodward and Bernstein. How long can we keep this up? Congress is pushing through some new bill that's gonna outlaw masks. Our days are numbered. Until then, it's like you always say: We're society's only protection. - From what? - Are you kidding me? From themselves. - Son of a bitch. No, Comedian, wait! Get your stinking hands off me. What the hell happened to us? What happened to the American dream? What happened to the American dream? It came true! You're looking at it. Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as Moloch. What are you talking about? I'm a retired businessman- Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger. I did my time. I'm not Moloch anymore. - What do you want from me? - Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why? I just felt I should pay my respects to the Comedian. - How'd you know he was the Comedian? - He broke in here. A week ago. He had his mask off. - He was drunk. - Enemies. For decades. - Why should he visit you? - I don't know. I woke up in my bedroom and there he was. He was upset. He was crying. Crying? The Comedian? He was babbling, not making any sense. I was pissing in my pants. I thought he was gonna kill me. What did he say? It's a joke. It's all a fucking joke. You know, I thought I knew how it was. I thought I knew how the world was. I've done some bad things. I did bad things to women. I shot kids. In 'Nam, you know. But that was fucking war. This. I never done anything like this. God, here I am spilling my guts to one of my archenemies. But the truth is you're the closest thing to a friend I got. What the fuck does that say? Shit. And your name your name was on the list along with Janey, you know, whatever the fuck her name is. Manhattan's old girl. Mother, forgive me. And then he left. I swear I don't know what the hell he was talking about. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable. Probably true. So that's it? - I'm clean? - You? Clean? Amygdalin. This phony medication made from apricot pits. - It's illegal. - Come on. Please don't confiscate that. I'm trying anything. I have cancer. What kind of cancer? You know the kind you eventually get better from? That ain't the kind I got. Rorschach's journal. October 16th. Want some of this? Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock. - Thought about Moloch's story. - Come on. Could all be lies. A revenge scheme planned during his years behind bars. Fuck you. I make more in a week than you make in a year, you fucking homo. But if it's true what could have possibly scared the Comedian enough to cry in front of Moloch? What was it he saw? And that list he mentioned. Edward Blake. The Comedian. Born 1918. Buried in the rain. Murdered. Is that what happens to us? No time for friends? Only our enemies leave roses. Violent lives ending violently. Blake understood. Humans are savage in nature. No matter how much you try to dress it up to disguise it Blake saw society's true face. Chose to be a parody of it. A joke. I heard joke once. Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world. Doctor says treatment is simple. "The great clown Pagliacci is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up. " Man bursts into tears. "But doctor," he says. "I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains. What time do you have to be at your interview? Don't worry. We've got plenty of time. Your finger's like licking a battery. God, Jon, stop. What are you doing? Please don't be upset. I always thought you liked this. No. I don't- No. I don't want that. I don't know what stimulates you anymore. Look, I know you were just trying- Are you working in here while we're in bed together? My work with Adrian is at a critical stage right now. - I didn't think it was necessary to- - To what? To what? To tell me which one of you is giving me a pity fuck? My attention was completely focused on you. If you think there's a problem with my attitude I am prepared to discuss it. You know how everything in this world fits together except people. What am I to you? Another puzzle to be solved? Have your men stand back. I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now. You're my only remaining link to the world. I don't want that responsibility anymore. He's all yours. Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back. No, she won't. He's been called many things: Hero, weapon linchpin of our national security deterrent to nuclear war, or a man to end worlds. Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan will answer my questions and yours in an exclusive interview brought to you commercial-free by Veidt Enterprises. Who is it? It's Laurie. Sorry. I just had this new lock installed. I didn't know where else to go. Oh, it's okay. Come in. What's wrong? I left Jon. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I don't know why I'm here. I just. I don't know anybody else. I don't know anybody except for goddamn superheroes. That's okay. You probably just had an argument or something. No, Dan. You don't know what it's been like living with him. The way he looks at things now, it's like he doesn't remember what they are. It's like this world, this real world to him, it's like walking through mist. And people are just shadows. Shadows in a fog. God, how did everything get so tangled up? I'm sorry, Dan. This is twice now I've ruined your evening. Come on. I'm glad you came over. I was just gonna see Hollis for our weekly beer session. You're more than welcome to join. In fact, I insist. Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me. He just- - We don't have time for makeup. That blue is too light for television. Is that dark enough? Yeah, that's dark enough. The weight of the world's on him, but does he quit? No. News vendors always cope. They're the- Oh, God, here comes that homeless guy again. I told you, this month's issue still hasn't arrived yet. Why do you care about that right-wing rag? Those bastards don't give a damn. Hold up. Here they come. - Seymour. - Bernie, how's tricks? Fine, fine. See this guy behind me? Been bugging me all week. Maybe we should get a cab. These are bad neighborhoods. Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood. Girl. What we got here? Here's a list of Pentagon-approved no-go areas. Afghanistan will obviously come up, but just play it cool and try not to get into any tight corners. - A renowned nuclear physicist, who, through a terrible accident was gifted with extraordinary powers, capable of bending matter to his will. Today, the world knows him as Dr. Manhattan. Welcome. Thank you. That's right. Ms. Black, you have the first question. Dr. Manhattan, as you know the Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face analogizing humankind's proximity to extinction midnight representing the threat of nuclear war. As of now, it stands at four minutes to midnight. Would you agree that we're that close to annihilation? My father was a watchmaker. He abandoned it when Einstein discovered that time is relative. I would only agree that a symbolic clock is as nourishing to the intellect as a photograph of oxygen to a drowning man. So you're saying there is no danger. Even in a world without nuclear weapons, there would still be danger. And would you say, as so many claim that you are, in fact, a god given you see the past and future simultaneously? I can only see my own past my own future. I am not omniscient. Doug Roth, your question? Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan do you remember a man named Wally Weaver? Yes. We were both physicists together at the Gila Flats Research Base. He died of cancer. - He was a good man. How about Edgar Jacobi also known as the supervillain Moloch? You encountered him several times in the '60s: Battles, conflicts. Did you know that he has cancer as well? I wasn't told. And what about General Anthony Randolph? He was your handler when you first started working for the government. Cancer. You're suggesting I was the cause. From where I'm standing, it's starting to look pretty conclusive. Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant. A live human body and a deceased human body have the same number of particles. Structurally, there's no difference. All right. Let's settle down, please. What about Janey Slater? You think it makes a difference to her? Janey? Your ex-girlfriend? She was a physicist too. You saw each other for 11 years. Doug, one question at a time. She has cancer as well. Doctors have given her six months. Isn't that right, Miss Slater? You were the world to me, Jon. You were my whole life. Do you remember how many times you said you loved me? Janey, I wasn't told. I stuck by you after the accident. I gave you everything. This is how you repay me? - Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know. - Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you. Janey, wait. - That's it. This interview is over. Get up there. Get those cameras off. Everybody back off. Everybody back off. I need some backup here. Leave him alone. Please, if everyone would just go away and leave me alone. Do you care to comment? I said, leave me alone! Jesus. Us getting mugged. Let's go. I'm shaking. You know what? I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night. Oh, are you sure you don't wanna come by Hollis' with me and shake off the adrenaline? I think I've had enough hero stuff for one night. It helped having you listen. Any time. Take care, Dan. It's a rough world out there. Be seeing you. You're late. Ah, I know. I know. You won't believe what happened. Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV. Wait, what? I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know. She's gonna know soon enough. The whole world will know. I said, leave me alone! I am looking at the stars. They're so far away and their light takes so long to reach us all we ever see of stars are their old photographs. It is July, 1959, and I am in love. That's great. - You can pick it up tomorrow. - Okay. - Seventy-five cents. - Okay, thank you. Thank you. Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice. I'm sure I made a face. Oh, no, no. I'm sure that you'll look beautiful. Her name is Janey Slater. She is a physicist, like me. I am 30 years old. We were introduced by a good friend of mine from college, Wally Weaver. It is February 12th, 1981. Wally dies of cancer, of which they now say I am the cause. That night, Janey and I make love for the first time. A month from now, the accident awaits me. Oh, I'll catch up with you guys. I think I left my watch inside. Hey. Let's just wait a second. I cross the room to the Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch. When I get to the door Wally is turning white. The program's locked in. We can't override the time lock. I am terrified. Jon? I'm sorry, Jon but I can't- Janey, don't leave me! Don't leave me! It is May 12th, 1959, when I'm introduced to Janey. She buys me a beer the first time a woman has done this for me. As she passes me the cold, perspiring glass our fingers touch. Yes, Jon, good. Now it's just a question of reassembling the components in the correct sequence. I feel fear for the last time. A token funeral is held. There is nothing to bury. Janey frames the snapshot. It's the only photograph of me anyone has. A circulatory system is seen by the perimeter fence. A few days later a partially muscled skeleton stands in a hallway and screams for a moment before vanishing. Oh, God. Jon? Is that you? Nations around the world reeling from this morning's announcement possibly the most significant event in recent history. We repeat, the superman exists, and he is American. They call me Dr. Manhattan. They explain the name has been chosen for the ominous associations it will raise in America's enemies. The marketing boys say I need a logo. If I'm to have a symbol it shall be one I respect. They are shaping me into something gaudy something lethal. In January, 1971 President Nixon asks me to intervene in Vietnam something that his predecessors would not ask. A week later, the conflict ends. Some of the Vietcong forces wanna surrender to me personally. Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero, writes a book. In it, he calls my arrival the dawn of the superhero. I am not sure if I know what that means. You see, at the time, I was misquoted. I never said, "The superman exists and he is American." What I said was, "God exists, and he is American." Now, if you begin to feel an intense and crushing feeling of religious terror at the concept don't be alarmed. That indicates only that you are still sane. It is Christmas, 1963. Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried. She says I am like a god now. I tell her I don't think there is a God. And if there is, I'm nothing like him. I tell her I still want her and that I always will. As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970. I am in a room full of people wearing disguises. A very young girl looks at me and smiles. She's beautiful. After each long kiss, she plants a smaller, gentler one upon my lips like a signature. Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait. She bursts into angry tears, asking if it's because she's getting older. It's true. She's aging more noticeably every day while I am standing still. I prefer the stillness here. I am tired of Earth. These people. I'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives. They claim their labors are to build a heaven yet their heaven is populated with horrors. Perhaps the world is not made. Perhaps nothing is made. A clock without a craftsman. It's too late. Always has been always will be too late. And you have no idea where he would've gone. How would I know? Probably on the other side of the world studying molecules. Our satellites have done a sweep of the planet. There's no trace of his energy signature anywhere. Really? Miss Jupiter, did you and Dr. Manhattan have a fight today? None of your fucking business. It is when you're on government payroll and you're not doing your job. That's as close to the word "whore" as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes. Smoke? My apologies, Miss Jupiter. You know how important Dr. Manhattan is to our national security. You can imagine our concern. I can only imagine. Ain't nothing gonna matter once those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust. Then Ozymandias here will be the smartest man on the cinder. Laurel? Laurel Jane? You're Sally Jupiter's kid. You're the Comedian, right? You were pretty cool in there. You know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties. You got her eyes, you know. You even have that same funny little mole. Take your hands off her. Hey, doll. Long time no see. Not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car. Are there no depths you won't sink to? Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his you know, old friend's daughter? I mean, what the hell do you think I am? We found him! - We found him. Where is he? Mars. Mr. President the Soviets have moved their tanks just short of the Afghan border. They are testing us to see if we manufactured Dr. Manhattan's disappearance to coax a move out of them. If they realize it's not a hoax, they'll probably start with air strikes. If they do, they'll have Afghanistan under control in a matter of days. A watchdog group of nuclear scientists has moved the Doomsday Clock to two minutes until midnight. Get this shit off the screen. Who are these assholes to say when doomsday approaches? I say when doomsday is approaching. Now, then. What about the rest of the Warsaw Pact countries? Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany have mobilized their forces. But no movement yet. They're playing a wait-and-see. Letting the Russians take the lead. Bold moves, Henry. That's what's needed right now. We can't let these fuckers think we're weak. Yes. They must fear the madman Richard Nixon. How soon can we be ready for a preemptive strike? Two days. We have a 54 percent chance of wiping out the entire U.S.S. R before they get their missiles airborne. What would our losses be? Assuming conservative projections of how many Soviet warheads are destroyed beforehand we'll lose all of the East Coast. The last gasp of the Harvard establishment. Let's see them think their way out of fission. With anticipated wind patterns, the fallout drift would head south. Mexico would catch the worst of it. Most of the farm belt might remain unaffected. Not so bad all things considered. Mr. President what would you like to do? Take us to DEFCON two. Begin fueling the bombers. Dr. Manhattan has two days. After that humanity is in the hands of a higher authority than mine. Let's just hope he's on our side. There must be a way to reach him. Excuse me. Radio transmission, space shuttles- Excuse me. What? I need to use the restroom. Don't you understand? The only thing that can bring Jon back is Jon. If he wants to find me, he will. I've been a prisoner in my life long enough. Without Dr. Manhattan around to bully the Russians into peace, Mr. Veidt people are going to need good, old-fashioned energy to rely on. You can understand. The world can't just quit on oil and nuclear power cold turkey. You'll dismantle our entire economy overnight. You're right, Lee. And why free energy? Well, "free" is just another word for "socialist." We might have to make a public inquiry into any past communist affiliations you might have had. Mr. Lacocca, gentlemen I respect your position and what you've accomplished as captains of industry. I do. You wanna know my past? Hm? Okay. Happily. It's a matter of public record that by 17, both my parents were dead leaving me alone. I guess you could say I've always been alone. They say I'm the smartest man in the world, but the truth is I've often felt stupid at being unable to relate to anyone. Well, anyone living, that is. The only person with whom I felt kinship died 300 years before the birth of Christ. Alexander of Macedonia, or Alexander the Great, as you know him. His vision of a united world was. Well, it was unprecedented. I wanted needed to match his accomplishments so I resolved to apply antiquity's teachings to our world today. And so began my path to conquest. Conquest not of men but of the evils that beset them. Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power are like a drug, and you, along with foreign interests are the pushers. - Now, listen. No. You listen. The world will survive and it deserves more than you've been able to provide. So let's cut to it, shall we? I'm worth more than all of your corporations combined. I could buy and sell you, something you should factor into your decision should you choose to make our disagreement public. I think you know the way out. Gentlemen. The toy people wanna talk to you about new villains for the Ozymandias line. - Seems all the old villains are dead. - Mr. Veidt? - I think I have some ideas. - Mr. Veidt? I think we got off on the wrong foot. He's got a poison capsule. Don't bite down, you son of a bitch. Who sent you? I want a name. Give me a name! Suicide pill. Potassium cyanide. Guy was dead before he hit the ground. Thanks, hon. Then Rorschach was right. This wasn't some lone nut. It's an organization: Well-funded, well-equipped. But who'd wanna kill us now? I don't know, but it's not safe out here. So no word from Jon? No. Well, listen why don't you come stay with me? Oh, no. That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose. Oh, no. No. Think of it as doing me a favor. I wouldn't have to worry about you being out there. Okay. Rorschach's journal, October 21 st, 1985. On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg and Jupiter leaving diner. They didn't know me without my mask. An affair? Did she break Manhattan's heart to engineer his exile make room for Dreiberg? Does Manhattan even have a heart to break? The alley was cold, deserted. My things were where I left them, waiting for me. My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves. My face. Putting them on, I abandoned my disguise became myself. Free from fear or weakness or lust. Down alley heard woman scream. First bubbling note of city's evening chorus. Attempted rape. Mugging. Both. The man turned and there was something rewarding in his eyes. Sometimes the night is generous to me. Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife named Roy Chess. At his apartment, I found clues. Seems he worked at Pyramid Transnational. I've seen the logo before at Moloch's. Someone tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch. Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational. More than a just delivery service, I take it. Last time I was here, I saw a pension check written from the same company. I'm guessing it's a front set up by whoever wants us masks dead. Now, no more lies, Moloch. Who runs Pyramid? Rorschach. This is the police. We know you're in there. No. No! If there's anybody in there with you, send them out unharmed. No. No, no, no! Framed. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Never, never surrender. All right. I hope you're ready, hero. When you are. One two three. Come on. Son of a bitch. - Christ, he stinks. - Get that mask off him. - I got it. - No. No! My face! Give me back my face! The masked vigilante Rorschach was apprehended and identified as walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male. Little's known about Kovacs, but he was charged with the murder of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head in his home in the Bronx. Police officers were injured and Jacobi's home was set ablaze during the violent course of the capture. Rorschach! I'm gonna fuck you like I fucked your mother! Come on out, Rorschach! Walter Kovacs. Is that your name? Walter? Well, let me explain your situation here, Walter. You cooperate with me and I may be able to convince them that you should be treated medically. In a hospital. I believe that would be good for you. But the authorities wanna put you with the general population. - Prison's a prison. - Uh-huh. Yes. But the difference is, down there you'd be eaten alive. You're responsible for a lot of them being in prison here, Walter. Tell me what you see. A pretty butterfly. What about now? What do you see here? Mom? Is he hurting you? You got a fucking kid in here. I get that at home. Bastard. I should have had that abortion. Some nice flowers. I heard this guy's mom's a whore. Did you catch any diseases from her? Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard. Hey, you think she'd suck my dick for a dollar? Clouds. Tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that, Walter? You keep calling me Walter. I don't like you. You don't like me. All right, why is that, exactly? You're fat. Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities. What you call compassion. Wanting to protect and understand the guilty. This rotting society, what it calls rehabilitation. Nothing short of compromise. Is it a compromise to want to make you well? There are other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine, doctor. Of course, they're not famous, are they? You wanna know about Rorschach? I'll tell you about Rorschach. Once a man has seen society's black underbelly he can never turn his back on it. Never pretend, like you do that it doesn't exist, no matter who orders him to look the other way. We don't do this thing because it's permitted. We do it because we have to. We do it because we're compelled. I was investigating a kidnap case. Blaire Roche. Six-year-old girl. I was young then. Too soft on criminals. I let them live. Broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to the missing girl's location. I knew the girl was here but when I searched the place, I saw nothing. And then I found her. Fred. Barney. Who's gonna bark for Daddy? It was dark when the murderer got back. As dark as it gets. Oh, God. Who's out there? Who is it? Who is it? What? What the fuck? Who the fuck are you? What the fuck do you want? You killed my dogs, man! You think I had something to do with that girl? I found that. What evidence have you got? That's nothing. Okay. I confess. I kidnapped her. I killed her. Arrest me. What? Arrest me! I did it! I said I did it! Christ. Look, I've got a problem, man. Fucking take me in. I need help. No, don't. Don't do that. Take me in. Don't! No! Men get arrested. Dogs get put down. Tremors of impact shook my arm. Warm blood splashed my face. Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs died that night with that little girl. From then on, there was only Rorschach. See, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl. Fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind. From then on, I knew: God doesn't make the world this way. We do. I can't help him. Hey, Rorschach. Hey, you're pretty famous, right? Rorschach, I heard your mother was a whore. Hey, you know what? I'm pretty famous too. - Ain't that right? That's right. That's right. Maybe I can give you an autograph. What you say, big boy? None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. All right, that's it! You're locked in here with me. Laurie! Shit. Hold on. - Fuck. I got it, I got it, I got it. I'm so sorry. I was snooping and must have hit the wrong button. - Are you hurt? - No, no. - Okay. - I'm fine. I just feel so bad. No, don't worry. It's happened before. Comedian did it back in '77. Archie survived that. Archie? Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes Merlin's pet owl. Stupid nickname. How did you ever afford all this stuff, anyway? Well, my dad was in corporate banking and left me a lot of money when he died which always surprised me. I mean, he was. I think he was disappointed I went into crime fighting instead of following him. Guess I was just more interested in birds and airplanes, mythology and. Plus, there were enough other guys doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous. Like Hollis. Yeah. Yeah, he was my hero. Man, I remember the first time that I met him I just felt so connected, you know? To something that mattered. Must be nice having a secret identity. A secret place that nobody knows about. You can just come down here and hang out without anyone checking up on you. Nobody watching you. Wanna try those on? There we go. Wow, these rock. They amplify the spectral range. Thermal imaging. They work even better in the dark. You can see me, right? I can see everything. I remember, no matter how black it got whenever I looked through those goggles, everything was as clear as day. This must be the way Jon sees the world. We should probably head up. Food's getting cold. Put those away when you're done. Soviet ambassador to the U.N. Had no comment when asked if Dr. Manhattan's disappearance has fueled Soviet aggression in Afghanistan. Dan. Jon sees a lot of things but he doesn't see me. Well, uh. Oh. Sorry. Come here. What's the matter? - If you could just move a little. - Okay. Yeah. There you go. Dan, what's wrong? Sorry, I. Yeah, I just need a couple minutes. Oh, hell. It's okay. Maybe we were just moving too fast. We've got all the time in the world. We'll take it slow. It's been a long time, Rorschach. Big Figure. Small world. I like that. But you know, it is a small world in here. And I've been in it for, how long now, Lloyd? Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure. That's right. Fifteen years since you and that Owl fella put me away. So Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying. Could go any minute. You know, by my count, there are more than 50 people in here that you put away. I been talking to every one of them and they're all dying to get a piece of you. This place is gonna explode! Then, you die by inches. Tall order. I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole. Relax, Lawrence. Soon. Come on. Dan? Is everything all right? I'm tired of being afraid. Afraid of war afraid of the mask killer and afraid of this goddamn suit and how much I need it. Me too. So to hell with it. Let's take Archie out. You're serious. I used to be a masked avenger too, remember? I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning and doing something stupid. Rapid burner. Be advised, all units. Tenement fire at 5th and Grand. Rapid burner. Let's go. I can see it. All right, hold on. Dan, there are kids in there. Everyone, stay where you are and remain calm. We're gonna get you out of there. The roof's starting to cave. Get me in there. I'm gonna get you close. Let's go. Come on. All right, let's move it, people. Mom, is that guy in the space rocket.? Is that Jesus? No, baby. Watch your step. All right. We're all set. Is that everyone? Bye. Bye! I can't believe we did that. - They'll lock us up with Rorschach. - Who cares? World War lll could start tomorrow. Right? Right. Come back here! He's dead, Rorschach. While everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift. Something from the machine shop. Hey, boss, you notice? None of that "small world, tall order" crap. He knows once we slice open his lock, he's next on the block. Fat chance. You're dead, Rorschach! We got a prison full of killers out here. What do you got? Your hands, my pleasure. Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars? This riot won't last. I been waiting 15 years for this. I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way of my revenge. Nothing personal, big guy. Boss! Wait! Now you find out what the score is. One-nothing. Come and get me. Come on. So I've been thinking. I feel that we have an obligation to our fraternity. - I think we ought to spring Rorschach. What? Someone set him up. And this whole cancer thing with Jon, it just doesn't make sense. You didn't get it. Yeah, but breaking into a maximum-security prison is a little different than putting out a fire. - Yeah, you're right. It'll be more fun. Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna smell this son of a bitch cooking. Yes. No. Never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really. Two-nothing. Your move. Get out of the way! No. No. Where's my face? Don't kill me. Your turn, doctor. Tell me, what do you see? Don't move! Rorschach. Daniel. Miss Jupiter. Excuse me. Have to visit men's room. Oh, for chrissake. Good to see you in uniform, Daniel. Should've known all you needed was nice pair of legs to motivate you. You're such an asshole, Rorschach. - Spare me indignation. Picked hell of a time to be unfaithful to Jon. Get tired of being patriotic, or someone put you up to it? You don't know what the fuck you're talking about! Hey! Would you two stop? You can argue later. I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire soon. Stop! Stop or we will shoot! Are you all right? Yeah. Just heavy, you know? War, jailbreak. Don't worry about it. Okay? Everything's gonna be fine. - Hello, Laurie. - Jon. - TV said you were on Mars. - I am on Mars. You and I are about to have a conversation there. What are you talking about? You're going to try to convince me to save the world. - Laurie, don't. - Dan, trust me. I have to go. Beautiful, isn't it? Forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind. It won't happen again. That's comforting. Oh, my God. I'm on Mars. Hey. Nice ass. Hey, asshole. Hey, let's see if that comic-book retard's up here. Hey, hey, hey. Yo. You all hear? Some super-owl dude just busted Rorschach out of prison. - Rorschach? - Yeah. That fool put my cousin in a wheelchair. You mean Nite Owl. Him and Rorschach used to be partners. - Yeah. - Maybe he messed your cousin up too. - Didn't he write a book or something? - Yeah. You know, he lives over a garage right near here. - Yeah? - Does he, now? Hello? Sally? - Hollis? - Yeah. Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus. All this time you've had my number and you wait until our sunset years to use it? Well, it seemed like a special occasion, Sal. What? The TV is reporting there was a tenement fire last night. There were trapped people rescued by airship and they say the pilot was dressed like an owl. And it seems he had a sexy woman with him. Laurie? My daughter, Laurie? I can't get over Laurie back in costume. Maybe she'll finally thank me for getting her started in the first place. You know, Sal, by the sound of your voice you're sounding younger than ever. Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis. But that's probably just senility. Well, it's been great talking to you, Sal but someone's knocking. Well, don't get too misty-eyed thinking about old times. You take care now, Hollis. Ah, you too. Bye. Bye. We're looking for Mr. Owl. Yeah. Hold your horses. Mr. Owl, you there? Trick or treat. You should've stayed retired, Owl. I hate this. Cowering in cave, hiding from authorities. Cops are out there hunting us. Unless you wanna go back to prison we'd be stupid to expose ourselves without a plan. And what would that be? Once we've established a pattern we can break into Pyramid, see what we find. Did that. Dead end. I think it's a front company for whoever's really behind it, but can't prove it. We need to hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people. Sure, why don't we just pick names out of a phone book? You forgot how we do things, Daniel. You've gone too soft. Too trusting. Especially with women. Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that. God, who do you think you are, Rorschach? You live off people while insulting them and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that, man. Daniel you are a good friend. I know it can be difficult with me sometimes. Forget it. It's okay, man. Let's do it your way. Oh, God. Pyramid Transnational. Anyone heard of it? Oh, you bastards. I buy everyone a round and you sell me out like this? Back off, or I'll stick this glass in your squidgy face. Everybody stay calm. We'll try to keep this brief. Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll. Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now. Did you know him? No. Yeah, yeah! - I hired him. I knew him from the inside. - You're a felon. I was. I've been straight ever since I got out, I swear. I barely knew Chess that well, but I was told to hire from the old life. - Told by whom? - My contact, Miss Slater. Janey Slater works for Pyramid too? Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring ex-cons was part of the company program. Give people a second chance. God, please let go! I'm telling the truth! Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend. Adrian might help us find out who's underwriting Pyramid. Follow the money. Former member of the Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered in his apartment less than an hour ago. Witnesses reported seeing members of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops leaving the area right around the estimated time of death. Reporting live, Tiffany Burns. - Who did it? - I knew you were gonna victimize me, man. What about my civil rights? Just because I'm wearing. - Tell me who did it! - A lot of people dress like this. Who murdered Hollis Mason? You tell your friends they're dead. I'm gonna take out this entire rathole neighborhood. I'll break your neck! Daniel, not in front of the civilians. Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis. This is where we hold our conversation. In it, you reveal to me that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together. - You know about me and Dan? - Not yet. But in a few moments you're going to tell me. If you already know the future, then why were you surprised when I left you? Or when that reporter ambushed you? Why even argue about it if you already know how this is gonna end? I have no choice. Everything is preordained. Even my responses. And you're just going through the motions. The most powerful thing in the universe is still just a puppet. We are all puppets, Laurie. I'm just a puppet who can see the strings. And what if you're wrong? Why does my perception of time distress you so? Because it's inhuman. Because it makes me insane. You always say you wanna comfort me. Well, it isn't working. Look, I don't wanna fight. I'm sorry I slept with Dan. You slept with Dan? You just said that you already knew about that. I said often that you were my only remaining link to humanity. Why would I save a world I no longer have any stake in? Then do it for me. If you really care. When you left me, I left Earth. Does that not show you that I care? My red world here, now means more to me than your blue one. Let me show you. Bombers are fueled and ready, sir. It's time, gentlemen. Take us to DEFCON one. Not in penthouse. Not in office. What nocturnal proclivities entice a man with everything out into the night at this hour? Daniel? You with me? - Yeah. - Then what are you doing? I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary. Maybe he keeps on file. - Something's not right. - Agreed. Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess all work for Pyramid. Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list with his and Slater's name on it. Whoever owns Pyramid could be giving these people cancer. Setting Manhattan up. Funny. Ancient pharaohs looked forward to the end of the world. Believed cadavers would rise, reclaim hearts from golden jars. Must currently be holding breath in anticipation. Pharaohs? Got a psych profile on Manhattan. See what the corporate head-peepers say. "Subject continues to retreat emotionally. If the only remaining ties were to be severed we predict total detachment from the human condition." I'm in. No. Congratulations, Mr. Veidt. Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online. Your support and your enthusiasm is what has led to this triumph. On behalf of the research team, we salute you. - Cheers. - Cheers. What in life does not deserve celebrating? This is the new Karnak. This represents the culmination of a dream more than 2000 years old a dream now assured because of your unquestioning assistance. And for this I am ashamed ashamed that you must now share such inadequate a reward. To the pharaohs their greatest secrets entrusted to their servants buried alive with them in sand-floored chambers. Sleep well, gentlemen. Our new, peaceful world will be indebted to your great sacrifice. Bubastis. Rorschach's journal. Final entry. Veidt's behind everything. Why? What's his endgame? I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent. Used to joke he was fast enough to catch a bullet. He could kill us both alone in the snow. That's where we're going now: Antarctica. Whether I'm alive or dead upon this reading I hope the world survives long enough for this journal to reach you. I live my life free of compromise and step into the shadow without complaint or regret. Rorschach, November 1 st. Can't you just tell me how this ends and save us the trouble? It ends with you in tears. Tears? So you don't come back to Earth. At some point, yes. The streets are filled with death. Jon, please. You have to stop this. Everyone will die. And the universe will not even notice. In my opinion, the existence of life is a highly overrated phenomenon. Just look around you. Mars gets along perfectly well without so much as a microorganism. Here, it's a constantly changing topographical map flowing and shifting around the pole in ripples 10,000 years wide. So tell me how would all of this be greatly improved by an oil pipeline? By a shopping mall? So it's too much to ask for a miracle? Miracles, by their definition, are meaningless. Oh, God, Jon! - Only what can happen does happen. - Just stop your bullshit. Land this thing. Now. As you wish. You know what? You can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my mom and all the other worthless humans. But know that you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears and look: Nothing. Maybe you were wrong about everything. You complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective. - You shut out what you're afraid of. - I'm not afraid. You want me to see things your way? Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do. Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before. I was a hero, goddamn it! It's not my fault you got old. What do you have to complain about? I put food on the table for you and your child. Call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life. Even the grimy parts of it keep on getting brighter. You know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties. - You got her eyes, you know. You got. - Take your hands off her. Hey, doll. Long time no see. Not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car. Now. Are there no depths you won't sink to? Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his you know, old friend's daughter? Drive. It was a mistake. One time. Guy tries to rape you, and years later, you let him finish the job? What? Were you drunk or just lonely? Am I ever gonna live this down? Laurie. No. No, not him. The Comedian was your father. No. No! No! No! My life is just one big joke. I don't think your life is a joke. Yeah, well I'm sorry if I don't trust your sense of humor. Will you smile if I admit I was wrong? About what? Miracles. Events with astronomical odds of occurring like oxygen turning into gold. I've longed to witness such an event, and yet I neglect that in human coupling millions upon millions of cells compete to create life for generation after generation until finally, your mother loves a man Edward Blake, the Comedian, a man she has every reason to hate and out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds it's you. Only you. That emerged. To distill so specific a form from all that chaos is like turning air into gold. A miracle. And so I was wrong. Now dry your eyes, and let's go home. We got a bearing on that artificial structure. Heat signature's off the charts. - Veidt. - I don't like the way Archie's kicking. - The engines. - They're icing up. Hold onto something. Daniel, you're coming in too low. Don't wish to interfere, but perhaps should pull up sharply. I know! I'm trying. I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it! I'm gonna redirect the heat from the flamethrower to speed up deicing but it's gonna take a while and we don't have time to wait. You need something warmer. Fine like this. What is it, girl? Mm. Adrian's a pacifist. He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes. He's never killed anyone in his life. Hitler was vegetarian. You're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get second chance. Gentlemen. - Welcome. - Adrian, we know everything. Then what's there to discuss, Dan? Plenty. You killed Comedian. May he rest in peace. Blake figured it out first. Nixon had him keeping tabs on us, making sure we weren't rocking the boat. Blake found out what I was doing here in Karnak and by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly. Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one to have a change of heart. So I had to kill him. Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task. I put roughly $2 billion into tachyon research to block Jon's vision of the future. You used his psych profile to manipulate him. Got him to leave the planet. I've known Jon long enough to see he isn't devoid of emotion. His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be noticed by the layman, but to me he might as well have been sobbing. All I needed to do was tug on the thread. The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt when he came to believe he'd given cancer to the people he loved was all the excuse he needed to leave Earth. Your bullshit assassin. You paid him to throw us off. Mr. Chess gave his life in the service of a higher cause, Dan. I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth leaving only one loose end: You, and your mask-killer theory one you followed with the tenacity of a true sociopath. I tipped off the police. Once you were in prison, I was able to move forward. Sorry to disappoint you. We were supposed to make the world a better place. Dan, that's exactly what I am doing. Nuclear war? Human extinction? Of course, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice. A few key regions around the globe. New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Hong Kong. Disintegrated in an instant. Fifteen million people killed by Dr. Manhattan himself. The world's punishment for flirting with World War III. Jon wouldn't do that. A fact no one outside this room ever has to know. The energy breakthrough I was working on just came to fruition. All these years, Jon was helping me replicate his power unaware of how I planned to use it. You see the Comedian was right. Humanity's savage nature will inevitably lead to global annihilation. So in order to save this planet I had to trick it with the greatest practical joke in human history. - Killing millions. - To save billions. A necessary crime. You know we can't let you do that. "Do that," Rorschach? I'm not a comic-book villain. Do you think I'd explain my masterstroke to you if there were even the slightest possibility you could affect the outcome? I triggered it 35 minutes ago. Jesus Christ, Henry. Why the hell didn't we get a launch detection? It's not the Soviets, sir. Intel indicates the energy signature was generated by Dr. Manhattan. Jon. Interference. Cataclysmic interference. I can't believe it happened. This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads. It was me. I did this. - What do you mean, you did this? - Not directly. It was made to look like I did it. Adrian. Speak of the devil. Jon. I know. Must stop him. Killed Blake, killed millions. Wait here. Adrian, stop this. The tachyons were clever but even if I can't predict where you are, I can turn the walls to glass. I should thank you. I'd almost forgotten the excitement of not knowing the delights of uncertainty. Forgive me, girl. You're such an asshole. Veidt, you bastard. - If you've hurt her, I'll. - Dan grow up. My new world demands less obvious heroism. Your schoolboy heroics are redundant. What have they achieved? Failing to prevent Earth's salvation is your only triumph. I'm disappointed in you, Adrian. I'm very disappointed. Reassembling myself was the first trick I learned. It didn't kill Osterman. Did you really think it would kill me? I have walked across the surface of the sun. I have witnessed events so tiny and so fast they can hardly be said to have occurred at all but you, Adrian, you're just a man. The world's smartest man poses no more threat to me than does its smartest termite. What's that? Another ultimate weapon? Yes. You could say that. Came under attack. Millions of lives were suddenly ended in an act of evil perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself. Since the attacks, I have been in constant contact with the premier of the U.S.S.R. Putting aside our past differences we have both pledged to unite against this common enemy. With the rest of the world we will prevail. This is a day we shall never forget. And yet we go forward to defend the human race and all that is good and just in our world. Thank you. God bless us all. Do you see? Two superpowers retreating from war. I've saved the earth from hell. We both have. This is as much your victory as it is mine. Now we can return do what we were meant to. We were meant to exact justice. - Everyone's gonna know what you've done. - Will they? By exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today. - Peace based on a lie. - But peace nonetheless. - He's right. Exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again. No. We can't do this. On Mars you taught me the value of life. If we hope to preserve it here we must remain silent. Keep your own secrets. Don't even think about it. Rorschach. Wait. Never compromise. Not even in the face of armageddon. That's always been the difference between us, Daniel. I've made myself feel every death see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity. - You understand, don't you? Without condoning or condemning I understand. Out of my way. People have to be told. You know I can't let you do that. Suddenly you discover humanity? Convenient. If you'd cared from the start, none of this would have happened. I can change almost anything but I can't change human nature. Of course you must protect Veidt's new utopia. What's one more body amongst foundations? Well, what are you waiting for? Do it. Do it! No! I'm leaving this galaxy for one a little less complicated. I thought you said you cared about life again. I do. I think maybe I'll create some. Goodbye, Laurie. Come on. Come on! Dan a world united and at peace. There had to be sacrifice. No! You haven't idealized mankind, you've deformed it. You've mutilated it. That's your legacy. That's the real practical joke. We repeat, there is nothing wrong with your television set. You are about to participate in a great adventure. You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the outer limits. Sure you don't want a drink? I'm okay. Cheers. There's something I need to get off my chest. I know that Eddie Blake was my father. Laurel. What you must think of me. I'm sorry I never told you. I should have but I don't know, I just felt ashamed. I felt stupid. It doesn't matter. People's lives take them strange places. They do strange things and, well, sometimes they can't talk about them. I know how that is but I just want you to know that you never did anything wrong by me. You asked me why I wasn't mad at him. Because he gave me you. Thanks, Mom. I love you. - Hello, Miss Jupiter. - Oh, Sally, please. Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up. I'll be right back. - So how's it going up here? - Good. How's it going down there? Good. I think I've got everything working. All of Archie's systems are upgraded. Finished the tinkering for now so all we gotta do is take her out. Well, that sounds like a date. Are we gonna be all right? Long as people think Jon's still watching us, we'll be all right in the end. I know what Jon would say: Nothing ends. Nothing ever ends. Seymour, we got nothing to write about anymore. Everyone in the country every country in the world are holding hands and singing songs about peace and love. It's like living in a goddamn global hippie commune. Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna be running for president in '88. We could run a piece on that. Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities with coverage. This is still America, damn it. Who wants a cowboy in the White House? Okay. I could look for something in the crank file. Crank file. Whatever. Take some initiative. Run whatever you like. I leave it entirely in your hands. Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985. Tonight, a comedian died in New York. Stein, 84A1900, report to "B"block. Fuck. Come on, Stein, move your ass. And don't forget your stinking rat.

So, Butch, what are you going to do? What plans have you made? Just looking around. You're looking around? Sol, please, tell Butchy about the job. l got a building going up in Williamsburg. l can get you on the crew. lt's up to $9 an hour. l already got you on the payroll, take care of your parole situation. You'll come with me in the morning. l got some people l'm going to see about some other kind of work. Oh, yeah, Butch? What kind of work is that? Sol, please. You're 35 goddamn years old! When are you going to start taking responsibility for your life? You fucked up all those baseball scholarships. You could have made something of yourself. But you're weak, you goddamn loser. - Sol, please-- - Cookie, shut up. You boys-- the three of youse--you're killing me. Just chill out. lt's his first night back. Oh, listen. Mr. Big Shot--sleeps all day, runs around all night with that fag Lester-- Lester's not a fag. - Cookie, give me another martini. - Yeah, Mom, make it a double. Listen, schmuck, nobody's talking to you. Your brother's got an excuse-- he's a convict. Your goddamn genius brother over here thinks he's-- What the hell's that guy's name? Salvatore Dali. Pop, it's Salvador. Salvador, Salvatore, what the hell's the difference? l break my ass to give you boys all the opportunities l never had. What do l get back in return? A convict, a schmuck, and a schizophrenic psychotic. who thinks he's a G.l. Joe. Michelangelo's old man considered art a profession of social disgrace. A lot of his art is a projection of his own emotional pain at home. l think l can relate with that. Don't break my balls. Listen, Pop, there's worse things than prison--your mind. Yeah, right. All three of you should be in jail, where you don't have to work for a living. l don't think so. You try watching some young cherry from the neighborhood getting his asshole reamed out by a bunch of murderers and rapists. You look at that. lt don't matter how bad you think you are. lf these motherfuckers want you, they're going to take you. You try living with that. Welcome home, convict. You're a very touching story. My hemorrhoids bleed for you. Pop.now, why can't you find me a job? l think it's really funny that the horrible convict over here ain't out of jail for 24 hours and you managed to find him a fucking job. Louis, are you going to have dinner tonight? What ever happened to death before dishonor? Louis, don't start. Come, put your teeth in and have some kasha varnishkes. Ma, l don't know where my teeth are. Pop, are you wearing my teeth? Can't you just feel the love in this room? What? l'm in no mood for your shit tonight. Do yourself a favor-- go back to your room. l'm going back to my room, and l'm going to make sure that you do not enter it. Louis, please change your underwears. They're filthy. l don't want to change my underwear. l won't be living here much longer, Ma. l'm leaving the country. l've signed up with an elite Special Forces unit. Don't ask me any information, see, because even if l were to get caught, l wouldn't tell them shit. l see the shrinks are making progress. Kid, what up? You're looking good. Amigo, your ride's here. - Don't give me any more of this. - l'm not going to give you-- l don't need this aggravation. Do you understand? What up, Tank? How you doing, man? Don't give me that ''what up'' shit. l hope you wasn't down with that bagel-eating motherfucker. What are you talking about? Bullet just got out of the penitentiary. - Yeah, so? - So? He robbed two of my best customers, stuck my man Flaco in the eye, and took off with my product and my cash, so! Tank, no shit, this is the first l heard of this. Honestly. l should have murdered that motherfucker three years ago while we was up north. Listen, Tank, what the fuck you want from us, anyway? What do l want? l want you to find the motherfucker and bring him to me! Would you stop? l'll find out what happened. You do that, Paddy. You do that, because if you don't, me and you going to have problems. You understand? Why you got to jump all over me like this? Why can't you chill out? l'll find out what happened. You got my cash? Yeah, l got your cash. lt's all there--24 large. Jesus Christ. What's the matter, you don't trust me anymore? l don't trust no-motherfucking-body. Until this shit is over and l got that motherfucker's head on a platter, you cut off. This is bullshit. You want to do something about it, little man? Chill. Paddy, you tell Bullet l said the only bullet he's going to see is the one l'm going to put in his fucking ass. You got that? - Yeah, l got it. - Good. Y'all get up from around me. Y'all stinking up my car. Smell like wet dogs in this motherfucker. Get out of here! Top of the morning, fellas. Let's go. Suck my dick, you stupid nigger. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fucking white boys, man. What the fuck are we doing in this spic joint? Come on, man, look around. Here, take a Spanish fly. Excuse me. Would you like to dance? l like the way you move. You look. You look, like, really, really hard, you know?. Looks are deceiving. l mean, come on, you don't dance? We could dance. Why don't you dance? l'll watch you. Man, why don't you loosen up a little, man? Sit down. Can't you enjoy yourself? What's up, bro? You got ability. You could do something with this. Get your head screwed on right, you could make some money, get away from all this bullshit. Listen, l do what l do. There ain't nothin' else to it. You ever heard of Pablo Picasso? Yeah, l heard of him. Picasso said that art is the ultimate perpetration of fraud. What he really meant was this is all bullshit. See, a piece of paper or the canvas and the paint, it all costs a few bucks. The finished product goes for a million dollars! What the fuck's wrong with a million dollars? Nothing's wrong with it. The thing is, is that all it means is something is wrong with the system. l'll tell you something--people love controlling other people, all right? Bro, we're only here for a cup of coffee. You got to take care of what you believe in. Eight years l ain't busted a nut. That spic broad over there-- l'm going to give it to her good tonight. Don't worry about it. lt happens to everybody. You know?. l like to be here with you anyway. l can jerk it. l can whack it. l could smack it. lt just don't work. lt's dead. lt's okay. lt doesn't matter. lt's okay. lt doesn't matter. - lt doesn't matter, okay? - Yeah, whatever. - l got to go, okay? - Sure, baby, you go. This is the not-to-be-missed story of how air power helped win. By September the 10th. Close the fucking door! Are you nuts? Tell me about this little journey you're about to take. Sorry, brother. That's confidential information. - You talk to anybody about this? - No! But l will tell you this because l trust you. l am going to gather-- Ten-hut! Sit! l am going to gather an army of invisible warriors. This time, l will have experienced, well-trained troops. Military force is not constant at--fuck. Victory in war is not repetitious. lt is constantly changing form. l don't expect a civilian like you to understand what l'm talking about. But you know that. Whatever form my enemy has, me and my unit will kick the living shit out of them and attain total victory. l love you. Chagall. There ain't no such thing as lovers Over the Town, not in this family, anyway, all right? You got Butchy to thank for that. You're too young to remember, but he robbed everybody in this household. He even stole your little piggy bank for a couple lousy bags of dope. Fuck him. Let him live someplace else. Nobody wants him here. Where is he going to go? He's got no place else to go. War is war! lt ain't fucking Monopoly! l had simpleminded, pimple-faced, inexperienced recruits not much older than you guys. Two thousand years ago, Sun Tzu, an ancient Chinese warrior, left behind secret documents on the art of war. l happen to be in possession of those documents. - Can we see them? - No, you cannot see them! - You have to earn that right, private. - Yes, sir. Get your mama's titty out of your mouth and talk, soldier! Yes, sir! Goddamn it! God-fucking-damn it! You needle-dicks don't know what l'm talking about! You ain't never been surrounded by North Vietnamese regulars. Seventh Cav, baby-- we was the best. Now, that was a war! l get a big pink boner every time l think about that. None of that limp-dick, Desert Storm, puppy-shit, smart-weapons bullshit. No, you're the only smart weapon. Stanley, you're the smart weapon. l want you to demonstrate what we did last week. Philly, up against the car. Here you go. Go ahead, Stanley. Okay, first you jab the knife in the throat. When you feel you've hit the spine, rip the blade to the right. Make sure to cut the two coronary arteries. Good. That's good. - Good job, Stanley. - Thank you. All right, Stanley. Too sexy for my car, too sexy by far And l'm too sexy for my hat Catwalk, on the catwalk Come on! Jesus Christ. Nice sled, Lester. Looks like a fucking Hostess Sno Ball. Just get in. My mother's on vacation in Florida. What's this garbage? Sounds like a chipmunk with diarrhea. l like that. What are you doing? Cost me $10.95 plus tax. You call that music? This is music. Bro, how come Paddy not making the drop, man? He's a fucking punk-- will not take orders. - You got a problem with that, Rico? - l got no problem. Watch out. Boy! - Come see me, man! - All right, man. You do what l ask? Yeah, l called that fucking Lester. l told him we got a smoker. Believe me, he'll be here. Don't worry about it. Look, give this to Pruitt. When Bullet shows up, make sure he gets that bundle. lt's got a red rubber band around it so you don't get confused. lt's got a red rubber band around it so you don't get confused. Think you can handle that? Yeah, man. Some kind of problem, man? Don't worry about that. That's my business. Now take this shit and get away from my car. Come on! What's up? Mazel Tuff! Where the hell do you think you're going? Get your ass back up that ladder and finish the job! Tom Thumb, listen, go follow the Yellow Brick Road. Screw you, wise-ass. Fucker! Fuck you, wise-ass! Motherfucker! l'll see you in hell! You guys wait here. l'm going to go in alone. Fuck that shit. l'm going in with you. Hurry up. This fucking place gives me the creeps. Ruby, you stay in the car. And it's smoking, motherfuckers. We got the toilet. Get back down here in line, man. Get back in line. Man, what you doing out? What are you doing out? - l thought you were at the state, man. - l'm a free man, Willy. How you doing, bro? Uptown? Downtown? What's going on, Willy? Yeah, it's the white dude with the black hood. Yeah, and the sweatpants. He just walked in, okay? You know l'm going to get the money, right? Bullet. What's up, man? Got some cash? - How you been? - Good. All right, all right. Over against the wall. He's okay. Let him in, man. lt's all right. Come on, hurry up. Give me a bag of boy, a bag of girl. Everybody on the ground! Now! What the hell is going on? Shoot her! Here he is! Give it up, Bullet. Let's move it! Just give him the fucking dope! - Give it to him! - Come on! Get out of here! Stay down, motherfucker! Don't move! Let's go! Let's go! Look out, man! Look out! Oh, shit! - Motherfucker! - Oh, shit! Want to play? Oh, my God! My mother's fucking car! Oh, shit. Motherfucker. My drawing hand! Man, without this, l ain't got nothing! l ain't got fucking nothing! l know that. l'm going to pull it out. Take a deep breath. You're all right. Come on. Wake up! What up, Bernard?

Place is a gold mine. ln and out in five seconds. lt's a piece of cake. Jesus Christ. Your fucking neighbors? That's cold. Fuck them, man. l never liked them anyway. You know, you've got a serious problem. Are you going to wear that sweater? The black sweater-- you going to wear it tonight? Why? l want to wear it. Goes with my black pants. Do you mind? What are you worrying about what you're going to wear? We're going to rob a house. Man, you got any hair products? You got any gel? Mousse? Anything? You're starting to act like an old whore. l'll tell you something-- we go down, l want to look good. Stop bitching. Nothing's going to go down. Nobody's going to get busted. What do you think? You know, Lester. You know, Lester, you're a very attractive man. - You lose your nuts in jail? - You don't want to know. Thank your lucky stars, Lester. You're just a pair of zebra pants.

Holy shit. Your psycho brother's outside talking to a fucking cop. Get away from the window. Why are you breaking my balls? Why aren't you out beating up some innocent Afro-American? Let me tell you something, wise guy-- l've got my eye on you. You tell your fucking brother l'm thrilled he's out. Man, l think your brother's on to us. Lester, stop being so paranoid. He don't know shit. You forget that l was with McGinty in the Fourth Marines, and he would personally stomp a mudhole in your ass and march it dry if he knew the way that you was treating me. What, you think that's funny? How come he's always got that weird smile on his face-- like he's got secrets nobody else knows? - Stein. - What? By the way, the war's been over for 20 years. l noticed. Oh, do l miss old Gurney Howard-- Gurney Howard, First Recon. l saved his ass in '63. lt was me that took that Chi-Comm grenade.

Frankie Eyelashes? l don't understand why we got to use those guineas instead of our own people. You forget the last time we did a piece of work? Him and his old man shaved 25 right off the top. l ain't doing business with them. You know what? Bet you with a little bit of effort l'd make one hell of a second-story man. Strictly high-class-- none of that nickel-dime shit. Believe me, Lester, you don't want to go to jail. lt ain't a pretty place. You'd end up slitting your fucking wrists. Yeah, right. l could handle it. Yeah, right. l could handle it. Fuck, man. You'd be sucking every fucking black dick in the joint. Take your nose candy. Let's go. Butch is a grown man. lt's out of our hands. lt's like l don't even recognize him anymore. - Looks like a goddamn degenerate. - lt's that damn prison. l don't think he's ever going to be normal again.

See this? See that? That's attractive. Women find that attractive. l've had chicks wash their panties on that. Have you ever looked at him? Have you ever really looked at him? That motherfucker wears makeup. You ever see his eyelashes? He uses that Maybelline shit. Why do you think they call him Frankie Eyelashes? See, chicks dig me for me, for Lester. - You're a real piece of work. - Come on, give me a shot, will you? Come on, you fucking machine. This machine sucks. l love you like a brother, so l'm going to be straight-up with you. And l don't lie. l mean l lie, but l ain't gonna lie to my friend.

Louis, don't talk that way. You know l don't like it. l'm sorry, Ma. But things were a lot better around here when Butchy was in prison. You know, you yourself said that the only time that you and Pop could sleep at night is when he's locked up. He's probably out right now committing multiple heinous crimes. Louis, shut up. Okay, all right. Ma, look at this baby. Look at it. Very nice, Louis. This baby puts out 160,000 volts of pure dynamite! lt'll knock the stool out of any perpetrator that trips the wire in the backyard. What a lovely thought, Louis.
