Thank you. I got them. - He didn't mean what he said. - Yes, he did. No, he's.. He's a strange guy. He's not like you and me. He probably thought you two were in love. So did I. Look you don't want to go up. So I'll drive you home. Wait. What about the trick? I'll come back later, get him drunk, take off his clothes. In the morning, he'll think you were there. No problem. City Morgue. Somebody died? Who cares? Why'd you lock the door? It's okay. Sirs? At least Franklin paid off for two years. Until he got stupid. You never even sent us a nickel. Not one nickel. - I don't know-- - I don't, I don't know. If you were up-front, we could've worked it out. But now it's too late. We're angry. We're insulted. Besides, wouldn't be right to let you live after we killed Franklin. He was our friend. I'd like to be your friend. Please, God! Let me be your friend-- Come on, let's get out of here. If we bust one bozo, we got to bust the whole place. I hate Narcotics. I wish they'd put us back on Vice. Could I have the check, please? Pretty good beat, huh? Peachy. I noticed you guys were unencumbered by female companionship. So how'd you like to get encumbered? Okay, boys. Here we are. I wonder why that door's locked. In the morgue? I know what you're thinking. Don't worry about it. It won't bother you if you don't think about all those dead people. Let me get my phone book. It's got all my numbers in it. I wonder where that book is. Maybe my partner has it. Follow me. You're about to become one of the Great Lakes. Open up. I said, open up! Get ready to fill him up. This is to make some holes so the water comes out. Again locked. What's going on? Excuse me. Hold it! Police! You guys are police? How could they be cops? I should have asked for an ID. Son of a bitch! That's it! Cool it! I quit! You what?! That's it, man! Party's over, numb-nuts! Man, you blew it! Let me hit him one time! It's all over, buddy. Were you scared? Were you? Mostly dizzy. I tell you, you were great! Guys were shooting over you and you just laid there. You never complained once. I admire that. - I have a great respect-- - Take off the tape. Look up here. Turn sideways. Other way. Okay, leave! Somebody have a comb, so I can just get ready? I wasn't ready for that. Just turn sideways. Leave. Today! You're good at this game. Last one. Best of three. Even, shoot! Great. Fair is fair. We took a shot, right? Can't hit a home run unless you bat. I wish I had a bat right now. You had to bring the police? That's gratitude. If I didn't bring the police, you'd be dead now. So? I'd be better off. I'd rather be dead. You want to be dead? Do you want to be dead? You let me know if you change your mind. You'll be the first. How you doing? That's great. You get me in jail here with Peter Lorre's son. "Oh, come on. We have to be pimps. Let's be pimps." We couldn't be doctors. We were rolling there for a while though. Cash, clothes. I'll tell you something. You couldn't do what we did in Russia. You know? Seriously. - Russian pimp-- - Would you do me a favor? Just leave me alone. There's room for one more. I thought you were in Indiana. My mom called. And you flew all the way back here. I thought for sure when you found out what I was doing you'd just hate me. No, not you. You came to be by my side. You are one in a million. Goodbye, Chuck. Did you see that? My fianc√©e just spit on me. And after you were deloused. But she's right, you know. I should be spit on. He's got hair in his mouth. What are you doing? It looks bad in front of the guys. So what? What am I running for, cell president? They have that? This is a nightmare. You know what the worst part about this is? I'm guilty. I am guilty. You know what'll happen, don't you? I'll lose my job. My life is over. Do you know at this moment I have sunk as low as I can go? I was wrong. Mimi, pay the cab driver, will you? Move over! With money! No jail can hold us. You got them out! You bet your Puerto Rican ass I did! Can't keep my men in there. My life is over. Stay with him. Take him home. Get him to the lawyer's on time. Piece of cake! We'll take you home, we give you a nice bath. Wait a minute. I don't see Belinda here. She don't want to come. That's it! Make him feel better. You know what I mean. Will this take long or what? I have a tennis lesson at one o'clock. I already missed one when we were in prison. I see. Can I get you anything? All right. - Lamb chops-- - I was thinking of something to drink. Why don't we just get started? Mr. Drollhauser are we going to prison? That's a good question. I hardly think so. You see boys, this is an election year and the party in power let's just say they find the whole situation embarrassing. Therefore, it would be in the best interest of all concerned if they just gave you boys your jobs back and forgot the whole thing. I assume that's okay with you. Mr. Drollhauser that's the greatest thing I ever heard! Thank you very much. That's fantastic! Well, it's not okay with me! We got them over the barrel. As long as we do I say get something out of it. Can I talk to him alone please? I have thought about this for the entire time in jail. And what I want is to go back to my old life, the way it was before this craziness. I want my old life back. Please, Bill. Please let me have my old life back. If I did that, I'd never be able to sleep with myself again. We are holding the cards. They're afraid of us. You see the beauty here? I say we go down there and march into the mayor's office and lay it on the line. You want to? It'll be fun. It'll be great. I'm wearing white! Get away from the door! Get away from the door! You won't see the mayor! You won't make any demands or I'm going to kill you! You'll play tennis with God! Are you going to change your mind? Are you going to change your mind? You got to keep that elbow stiff. What's going on in there? My God! I could have you guys executed for this! Call maintenance! Get them up here! You'll be hearing from my lawyer. - Are you okay, Mr. Chuckie? - I'm calm. I'm calm. - I'm calm, I promise. - Are you bleeding? It's okay, girls. You can let go. Let me tell you something. You listen to me, Mr. Idea Man. I will go back to the morgue. And I will put my life straight. A life you ruined! Everything that's bad that happened to me, you did! I don't want to see you anymore. I don't want to hear from you anymore. I don't even want to hear rumors about you anymore. Here's an idea: Get a ticket on the first space shuttle and get out of here. Excuse me. How are you? What have you been doing? You mean, since jail? I'm back to work. Yeah, me too. I start a new job tonight. Really, what are you doing? It's the same thing I did before. It's just in a different place. Paradise Found, just off Sixth? I've heard of it. It's supposed to be real nice. Look, I may not see you again. I'm moving on Friday. Condo. Very good investment. You don't want to be late for your first day. Where the fuck is 4K? Excuse me! I didn't know you was deaf! 4K! I'm 4K. Is that my dinner? You do with it what you want. It's five bucks. I already added in my tip. How thoughtful. Thank you. Excuse me. There's mustard on this sandwich. So? So? It's egg salad. Give me the sandwich! Happy now? I would like a whole new sandwich. Listen to me. - Listen! - Take it easy. Listen to me! I will never again eat a sandwich I did not order! I am sick and tired of being afraid. Bad jobs, bad sandwiches, neurotic girlfriends. No longer for this man! Do you understand? You! Go home! And you! Go clean off my door! Excuse me. I joined this club a month ago and have not received my membership cards. Could you please call the manager? I'll find him myself. Hey, sir! Is everything all right, Mr. Tuttle? Where's the goddamn towel boy? I'm not coming out of this pool naked! Not with these parrots around! Of course, Mr. Tuttle. Towel boy! Sorry. Hi, Mr. Manetti. Nice threads, very Miami Beach. Mr. Tuttle would like a towel. All right. Yes, sir. Here you go. Hey, Mr. Tuttle. How you doing? How's everything? There you are, sir. Got one. Maybe you ought to take two. I don't think one'll do it. Less seen the better. Excuse me, Mr. Tuttle. Do you know Belinda Keaton? No, I don't. Listen, helium-head, how hard is it to pass out towels? It's a skill like anything else. People pay $8,000 just to join this club. They expect service. Stop screwing around or you're out of here. - Beat it! - All right. jackoff. - What was that? - It wasn't me. It was the birds. Birds. Why are you here? Why are you here? I'm looking for Belinda. Is she working here? Excuse me. Don't go thinking I work here, because I don't. I own it. I bought it this morning. - Straighten that strap. - Drop dead! All right, you're fired! Clean out your locker. You're history. Don't go up. You'll get in trouble. With who? You own the place. I know. But I got partners! Come on, these guys are tough! I'm not kidding you. These guys are built like Checker Cabs. - Don't! - Sorry. - Don't go in there! - Sorry. I'm not letting you get-- Hey, we're in here! What am I going to do? You want a membership? I'll get a commission-- Will you just stay out of my life? You don't have to tell me three times. I'm out! Bud. Can I buy you a drink? I changed my mind. I don't work-- I'll make it worth your while. - I don't feel like it. - The party's just starting! - I really don't feel like it. - Come on! Am I glad I found you. I got to talk to you. - I saw her first! - Actually, I saw her first. Remember the argument we had? - You were right. - I was wrong! - Are you done? - No. Now, listen. You were waiting for me to say I love you but I didn't have the guts! I've got the guts now! I love you too. I'll show you how much. Listen, slime, you have three seconds to take your hands off this particular woman! One.. Hold on, Chuck, I'm coming, buddy! Where's the manager? You guys stay right here! Are you all right? Did you break anything? I caught an updraft. - Are you okay? - Don't worry, I'm all right. Fortunately, the ground broke my fall. Tell her what you were going to tell her. You love me? I said it. I didn't say it. I love you. Can we do that again? Guys, my neck. You got my neck a little bit. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm real happy for you. Okay, piss-head! You're fired! That suits him just fine. He's not a towel boy. He's an idea man! He couldn't find his asshole with a funnel. Never mind. The guy's right. - He's wrong! - He's right. I've never done one thing I ever said I was going to do. That is not true. Remember when we first met? You said, "I'll make a man out of you." Could I have done all this without you? Done all what? You can't talk to my very good friend and the woman that I love like that. Now, look. I know that you're a very powerful man. I know that you could break my back like a little toothpick. There's only one question I've got to ask. Is that a gun under your jacket? Fine. Vice Squad! It's a raid! Vice Squad! Vice Squad! Put some clothes on, idiot! Don't touch the car, punk! Wait, they're not coming! We made it! You were great! You were kissing! I'm cold! You were fabulous! Here you go. Thanks. Hey, Chuck, here you go: microwave clothing. Listen to this! You can stay warm and bake a potato in your pants! I think you can do better than that. Baked potato. I could kill for a baked potato. Let's eat! <i>I've heard it said that this here.</i> <i>. this here's a man's world.</i> <i>And some girls, they believe it.</i> <i>Primping and fussing and holding out,</i> <i>hoping a boy will look her way.</i> <i>They don't know they got the power.</i> <i>As for me.</i> <i>. I'm not that kind of girl.</i> <i>I'm on top.</i> <i>Which begs the question.</i> <i>. if the girl's on top, well.</i> <i>. who's the one getting screwed?</i> Hey, wait up! <i>So if it's a man's world, God wouldn't have made me.</i> <i>Or that fat fuck.</i> OK, who can give me an example of a good choice? - Tonya? - Waiting. I mean, if a guy really likes you, he'll wait. And if he doesn't understand, well, you know. so what? Most excellent. But hey, I know how it is. I was young, too. - Our hormones can get the best of us. - Hey, pass it down. The only safe sex is no sex. Unless you stay busy, get some hobbies, and practice abstinence, you could end up asking, "Was the momentary thrill really worth it?" What are some healthy alternatives? - Tonya? - You could have a pizza party. Right on. Who doesn't love pizza? Anyone else? What are your thoughts on the pull-out method? You must like the time we spend together. It's a real hoot. Your classmates are impressionable, Miss Edmonston. Your ears might be used to that kind of talk, but most of these kids come from good families. You have any positive males in your life? A pastor or a neighbor or an uncle. It's none of your business. You're an exasperating girl, Miss Edmonston. According to Mr. Potter, you spoke quite explicitly about male projectile. - It's a sex education class. - Lifestyle choices. I¬ím putting you in Challengers. - Special Ed? - Challengers. - That's for retards. - It's either that or expulsion. Miss Pierce will give you your new schedule. What is there to know? It's one room in the basement, all the time. Danielle, you're a smart girl. You just make bad choices. If you'll do your homework, and stop being a distraction to others, you'll be back with the normal kids in no time. Danielle nobody likes a dirty girl. Hello, Challengers! Hey. Today we are going to start a project that will hopefully teach us that parenthood is no joke. Right, Sabrina? Yeah. Nobody's laughing at her house. OK, everyone partner up with someone of the opposite sex. Two by two, like in the ark. Who does not have a partner? OK, Benita, why don't you come over here near Joaquin? And Clarke? We'll think of something. OK, class? This is Danielle Edmon. Edmonston. And she will be joining us today, so everyone say a big hello. Hey. OK, Danielle. We're partnering up, so why don't you just head right on back there with Clarke. For the next six weeks, you will be married to your partner in every sense but the biblical one. You're that fag, right? And these precious sacks of flour will be your bundles of joy. These are your daily journals. You will record baby's first steps, things that baby does that are so cute you can't stand it. OK, here is Mrs. Stork, making a special delivery to you. Who needs a baby? - Takes after you. - This is going to be so much fun. - What do you want? - Uh, we're partners. No offense, but my designated is, as of this morning, no longer designated. I don't know what that means. It's Danielle's three D's of dating: Discriminate, designate, and dump, and since the unfortunate dumping of Brad, due to his lack of sanitary respect, I¬ím on to the next. And quite frankly, as a dick smoker, you don't qualify. But we're married. Discriminate. Miss Hatcher says we need to be good parents. Designate. Hey. You got a light? Hey, fellas. - You're that girl, ain't you? - Yep, I¬ím that girl. You know what I heard about you? Don't believe everything you hear. Unless it's really good. Then it's true. Well, I hear you're with the retards now. Your principal called today. I am very disappointed in you. Now, just say whatever comes to mind. - Some pretty racy stuff, huh? - Hm. Want to know what I think? I think those pictures scare you. You know, Clarke, sexual feelings aren't something to be afraid of. What's your favorite kind of breast? Long ones? Pointy ones? How do you like 'em, Clarke? Hairy. Hairy. Clarke! Stop it! Let's go. Roger me this, Son. You and I had a deal, didn't we? Seems to me you're not holding up your end of the bargain, though, you copy me? Clarke? Do you copy me? You know what that makes you? It makes you a welcher. The only thing worse than being a gay is being a welcher. - I¬ím not no gay. - Yeah, who am I supposed to believe? A 15-year-old welcher, or a qualified medical physician? - He's a chiropractor. - He's got experience. What the hell did you do in there? You think this is funny, you little shit? - Wheel! - God, don't do that! Don't yell at somebody that's lost control of the car. You're a hair's breath from getting your ass sent away for good. That military academy is starting to look like a real sweet option to me and your mother about now. In her spare time, Maggie enjoys long walks by the creek, and stopping for sodas at Sonic and shopping. Great work, guys, really terrific. OK, Clarke and Danielle, you're up. Who do you think you are? I mean, really. You didn't even give her an outfit. And for everyone else, I appreciate your effort, and your time that you put into realizing your children. Because, that one would be dead on the street or laying under a car somewhere, with a needle in her arm. Hey, Mike! Mike, get in the car. Let's go! Get in. - Me? - We got homework. Don't worry about being nice to my mom. She's a total poon. Danielle? Is that you? This is Clarke. He's from school. Sue-Ann. I'm Danielle's mom, but you wouldn't know it to look at me. That's a totally gross thing to say. But people think we're sisters all the time. Cookie? Nobody wants one of your sad instant cookies, Sue-Ann. - You said you liked these. - I said I liked the dough. Thanks. She's nice. She was a total slut when she was in high school. Now she's with this Mormon guy, and she thinks she's Suzy Homemaker. Danielle, we talked about this. You can have boys over, but this door stays open. We're doing homework. Besides, Clarke here's a fag. Ray's bringing the kids over for dinner later. Y'all think you're gonna be done by then? If you close the goddamn door and leave us alone and let us concentrate. If I talked to my mom that way, my dad would kick the shit out of me. I don't have a dad. So I do what I want. Boy or girl? I think I'd ruin a boy. Girl. Name? Uh. I don't know. How about Joan? Like Joan Jett. Or Crawford. That's nice. Is there some sort of special gene that makes you say "Crawford" when I say "Joan"? Huh? It just seems the more times a person gets poked in the butt, the more likely they are to say stupid faggy shit. I'm a virgin. It's not a big deal. Tell it to my dad. He'd be happier if I didn't exist. That's not true. I'm sure my dad loves me, and I don't even know him. That don't make no sense. You know, if you're not careful, you're gonna end up one of them overweight homos with nobody to love you but a gerbil named Bruce. You ready for me, baby? Here I come. Daddy's cleaning you all up. Yes! - Is that your dad? - Unfortunately. - Where the hell have you been? - I had homework. Hey! You forgot this. You ruin me for anybody else. Hey. Hey. Shit. Peggy, what are you doing? Are you crazy? That dog would kill you. - Oh, hi! - There she is! We saved you some. It's on the stove. Your mother and I would like to speak with you about something. Where's Mindy? Get out of my room! <i>- You can be Heather. - This is bullshit.</i> I mean, you can marry this Mormon loser if you like, but there is no way I'm sharing my room with this little twat! All right now, that's going to be rule number one. Anyone caught swearing under this roof is going to get their mouth washed out with soap. - Fuck you! - Danielle. - Don't test me. - What's a twat? You see? Now that's what I'm talking about. Evil has a unique way of spiraling. A twat is an ugly, flatulent, hairless vagina! - I'm not going to warn you again. - OK now, Ray, Danielle. Have you ever heard of the celestial kingdom, Danielle? That's a magical place in the sky where we'll live for all eternity. - That's very good, honey. - So? Well, we want you there with us, Danielle. What are you talking about? After your mother and I are married, I'm going to adopt you. - The hell you are! - The hell I'm not. It's the only way for you to get in. We don't want you cast into the outer darkness. How's that different from any other day? Think about it, Danielle. You've always wanted a daddy. - I have a daddy. - A real daddy. You know what? I'm going to take this family on a retreat this weekend. - Oh, wow! That's great! - A little fishing, a little hot cocoa. - Help you get used to the idea. - You love cocoa. I'm not going anywhere. Me and Clarke are going to work on our project. Well, family first. Tough love time, Danielle. You don't want us, - we don't want you either. - Ray! - You can stay. - Thank you. But we're taking all the food out of the kitchen. - All the money out of your pockets. - Fine. - And the keys to your car. - What? - No! No! - Then you will know what it means to be alone and stranded for all eternity! - Ray, not a good idea. - Well now, dadgum it, Sue-Ann. You want me to be the man of the house, you gotta let me make the tough decisions. I believe, after this weekend, Danielle will see the wisdom and let me be her daddy. Yeah? Does that mean this guy will be my brother? Well, is that a problem? Yeah, considering I fucked him. - Mindy, go to your room. - Don't you.! - Hey, you fucking cow! - Girl fight! I hate you! No! Calm down! I am bigger, and I will win. Let go of me! You are not my dad! Could you leave me alone? Please? Ray's a good man. He could be a good father. You can try to make me a Mormon, but you're still a shitty mother. Good guys don't come around that often, Danielle. I'd like to keep this one. He's not even cute. We could have a good family going here. I don't want your stupid fake family. OK. We'll see how you do on your own. Meet Joan. So named for the irrepressible lead singer of the Blackhearts. And the alcoholic, child-abusing movie star. Hey, wait up. Don't fuck with me. I haven't eaten in, like, 13 hours. Why not? Sue-Ann thinks she can starve me into being a Mormon. - That sucks. - I'm having a really shitty day. If you don't mind, I'd just like to be left alone. My dad said that I can take you out tonight, his treat. I have discriminated, and designated. And I designate you. Just. Please, just go away. He gave me his credit card if you want to go eat, or something. Screw this. I need a fork, you want one? Chinese men must be good with their fingers, I swear. I hear they have straight pubic hair. I tired to get a look at Shani Suzuki's once in the locker room. She's real careful with her towel, so I never saw shit. - Why are the lights off? - Uh, fluorescent bulbs hurt my eyes. Sue-Ann's so cheap. You'd think at her age she'd want to give her face the benefit of the doubt. But it saves money, so I guess she doesn't mind being green. - What are you doing? - Nothing. You're hitting on me, and I do not appreciate it. I have discriminated, and I have designated. Ahh! What the fuck? I thought you were a faggot. - Only 65 percent. - Huh? My therapist showed me this chart. It says that I'm 35 percent hetero. And if I can get that up to 60 percent, my parents won't send me to military school. You're bleeding. I'm gonna get you a Kleenex. Thanks. Soon as it stops bleeding, you'd best go. You send me back now and they're going to know we didn't do it. Contrary to popular belief, I'm not the world's personal whore bag. I just figured, after yesterday, you wouldn't mind. You'd best go now. Joan's family tree's due tomorrow. Shouldn't we work on it? Hm? Sometimes he hurts me. Well he already thought we were doing it. What, am I going to save my reputation now? - You owe me one. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Ah, ah! Mm-mm. Oh, shit. It's lopsided. Looks like we're gonna be spending holidays with your side of the family. We should put some on your side just to balance it. Maybe draw some birds or something in the branches. It just doesn't look very good. I'm gonna show you something. When I do, you can't say it's stupid or nothing. OK. - What did you do to your hair? - It's Sue-Ann, you idiot. Oh. That your dad? I found it in Sue-Ann's jewelry box when I was little, and I swiped it. - He's cute. - Thanks. - Let's put him in. - I don't know his name. I'm a real good drawer. I could draw him in. No, just do birds or something. Poor Joan. She only has one grandpa, and he's a total dick. What are we gonna tell her? They were high school sweethearts, and he was handsome and magical. You know, if they were high school sweethearts, he'd be in her yearbook. I checked those, like, a zillion times. He didn't go to her school. Maybe he wasn't a student. You take this one, OK? Peggy? What is that? It's just as well. I wasn't thrilled by the idea of my dad being a pedophile. This one don't have no signatures. That's the year she dropped out, 'cause of me. Ooh, football players are yummy. Ah! They're the worst. I mean, the idea and all is hot, but that cream they use is so nasty. I like they way they smell, like Bengay and ferns. You have no self-respect. I'm gonna get some more food. You want some? OK. - Danielle? - What? Found him. Assistant coach, Danny Briggs. Danny? You're named after him. <i>- Hello? - Hey, baby. You doing OK?</i> Just fine. Have you had time to think about things? Yeah. You're right. I do need a man in my life. It's working. Listen, baby. In my bedroom under the lamp, I left you some cash. <i>Go ahead and order yourself a pizza. OK?</i> OK. And we'll be back on Monday. - OK. - Hey, you. I love you. OK. This house is really nice. Maybe there's another Danny Briggs in Norman. No, this is it. Maybe you should've called first. - Yeah? - Hi. Hi. I'm Sue-Ann's little girl. Good for you. What can I do for you? We're looking for Danny Briggs. You him? Billy? Who is it? Let's see, we moved in here, when, about a year ago? Let's see. it was right after my sister's wedding, which was a week before the space shuttle blew up. - Such a sad time for the country. - I'm still not over it. I don't mean to be rude or nothing, but where the fuck is my dad? - You're saucy, I like that. - Fresno, sweetie. I like your house. It's super tasteful. - Fresno? - California. You should've seen it when we first moved in. That wife of his had it all done up in faux country. Oh, I hate that. We almost didn't get this house because of her. When she found out we were in a long-term committed life partnership. Bitch. - Hey, you got an address? - Does she even know about you? Danny's wife? Oh, my God. - They asked us to forward the mail. - We never did. Oops. Would you like to deliver it? - Thanks. - She is gonna shit twice and die. You are bad. - California. - You are. Get up! - Come on, we have to go! - Where do you want to eat breakfast? You know, I think Sambo's takes credit cards. - You're taking me to California. - You're a crazy person. Ray took my keys or I'd drive myself. Dani, my parents will kill me. Well, tell them you were manipulated by my pussy. I can't steal my dad's car. I don't know what would happen, but I imagine it would hurt. A lot. I don't want to be a Mormon, Clarke. It's my chance. I've never known my daddy. And now I've got a name and an address. It's my hope. Please? I can't. Mom, I'm home! Did you have a good time? What are we going to do about you, Clarke? You know you're not supposed to drink from the container! Come here! Goddamn it! Clarke! Clarke! Come here! Don't you take my car! Hey! Hey! Hey! God damn it! Ow! Clarke! Bring Joan! Whoo! <i>Dear Diary,</i> <i>I am super excited about our family vacation.</i> <i>I'm only a week old and already</i> <i>I'm seeing all the great sights of this great land.</i> <i>It is said that most American families</i> <i>don't spend enough quality time together.</i> <i>My family is different.</i> Whoo! I ain't never been out of Oklahoma! Goddamn! Whoo! My grandma lives in Dallas, so I'm used to traveling. - Have you ever seen the ocean? - No. I ain't never seen the ocean neither. So when we get to Fresno, we go to the beach. Don't you just love Melissa Manchester? You know. I was thinking when we get back, we could enter the talent show. Do one of her songs. I'm not going on no stage with you. There's no way I'm signing up for the talent show. It just wouldn't be right in the public eye to see the two of us <i>belting out the theme from Ice Castles.</i> What if we did "Don't Cry Out Loud"? Clarke, I'm not going back. And that song sucks. If you spill that, my dad'll kill me. Baby you came out of the closet, stole his car and took off with the class whore. You're the definition of dead. Hello? <i>I have a collect call from Clarke.</i> Yes, yes. - Clarke, honey, where are you? - Is Daddy real mad at me? Honestly, honey, I'm afraid of what he might do. <i>- Does he still want to send me away? - Your father is.</i> .just sort of determined when he makes up his mind about something. I know. We can just try to convince him together. <i>All right, can you do that?</i> Clarke, are you with that girl? - Peggy? Who was that? - Nobody. Let's go over to that girl's house. Somebody should wait by the phone. All right. Did you tell your parents where we are? I swear to God, if you did, Clarke, I will pull this car over and kick your ass out! You are running toward something, Danielle. - I am just running away. - Well, ain't that poetic? My daddy's credit card is financing this little adventure of yours. - You have not even said, "Thank you." - Some things go without saying. Then I guess it goes without saying that you are the neatest person that I have ever met! And I am not afraid no more when I'm around you, 'cause you are cooler than I will ever be. And It also goes without saying that I would never tell on you! I promise I'll find a way to thank you. Breaker, breaker. Got me a peeper in my sights. No! No! <i>Breaking and entering, was that really necessary?</i> I mean, couldn't you have just called? That would've been the neighborly thing to do. I got an at-risk kid. And he is at risk. Hm-hm. Hey, I need some medical attention here. I got my ass bleeding like a sieve. Oh, and you think that's news around here? # Ooh, heaven is a place on earth # They say in heaven love comes first # We'll make heaven a place on earth # Ooh, heaven is a place on earth. # We were just passing through and thought we'd stop by and say. Hi. You live in a beautiful place. Hi. What do you think of my hair? Bonjour. Hola. It's so great to finally meet you. I'm real excited to be. Shit. How am I supposed to face my father? I look like a fucking leper. Where's Joan? Oops. Clarke. - You've gotta be more careful with her. - Sorry. How would you like to be dropped on your head? I have been dropped on my head. Daddy says Mama dropped me, and that's what accounts for my feminine ways. You trying to make Joan a lesbian? You gays are always trying to convert everybody. Well, I don't see no damage. None that Hatcher would notice, anyway. If you're not going back, why are you so worried about your grade? Go to sleep. A long day ahead of us tomorrow. You ever tried Magic Fingers? Lay down. OK, OK, now do this. - Uh. - Uh. Oh! Shit! Goddamn it! You can't yank like that, that fast! Well, I see you made a friend. Joseph? What happened to your behind? What took you so long? Well, you took one car and Clarke took the other and I had to walk. I swear to God, Peggy. I'm going to get my hands on him. I don't know what I'm gonna do, but I'm gonna do something probably. Joseph? I want you to promise me that you will not hurt him. You know how humiliating this is? I got a biker rapist picking glass out of my ass. Well, our son could have called. Am where am I? I am here, bailing my husband out of jail. Officer, could you just open this damn cell door and let me out? Officer, if I refuse to take my husband right now, what is going to happen? Why, Peggy? You're not refusing to take your husband. Well, seeing as though it's the weekend, the judge won't be here till Monday. And would he have to stay here all locked up? - Hm-hm. - No. I don't have to stay locked up here, because you're getting me out. - Then I refuse to take my husband. - What? I'm gonna go find our son. And you are never, ever, ever going to hurt him again. Peggy, don't get emotional. You're not supposed to get emotional. You know what happens when you get emotional, you get stupid. Rot! What's wrong with you? Bust my fucking eardrum. Peggy! Peggy? <i>- Whoo! - Dear Diary,</i> <i>New Mexico is brown and flat.</i> <i>Mom does most of the driving, because she thinks that Dad goes too slow.</i> <i>Daddy is happy, being a man and all, just navigating.</i> <i>- He is a most excellent map reader. - # Shoop-de-bop!</i> <i>With the division of labor so neatly divided</i> <i>and both of them willing to stay in their designated roles, I'm convinced.</i> # Funky pops! <i>. that I have the happiest family there ever was.</i> # Coffee, tea or me baby # Touch√© ole # My opening line might be a bit pass√©, yes # But don't think that I don't know what I'm feeling for you # 'Cause I got a vibe on you the first time that I saw you, saw you # I need your love and I won't bring no pain # A little birdie told me that you feel the same # I'm for the real and for you I'm true blue # Let's make a deal, sugar all I want to do is # Be your one and only lover. # Did you see that guy? - Pull over. - Press on we must, Clarke. Press on we must. You're the one who keeps saying you need to get me laid. Sweetheart, did you eat something today? Go on in, I'll whip you up some flapjacks, OK? Can I sleep in Danielle's room? Honey, you can sleep anywhere you want. Let's all just go inside. Put your stuff away. - Excuse me. - Yeah? This is incredibly embarrassing, but I have reason to believe that my son has run off with your daughter. Oh, God, I should never have left her alone. Listen, horny children are the least of my worries. - They'll turn up, they always do. - My son is gay! Oh. Oh, Lord, I never said that out loud before. Are you Clarke's mama? I've lost my son. Sue-Ann! - Yeah? - Someone broke in! - There's glass all over your bed. - What? - Goodness. - Oh. My husband is just a little bit testy when it comes to our son. I promise I'll pay for any damages. Oh, no. Oh, no. Excuse me. Are those Bugle Boy jeans that you're wearing? It's this one right here. Hey, Danielle. Joel here is wondering if we could drop him off in Vegas? - I. - I told him it wouldn't be a problem, this being my car and everything. I got a job there waiting for me. - Listen, Joel. - And the cool thing is that, unlike some people Joel is willing to help out with expenses. Yeah, I got money, I just ain't got wheels. Get in. Danielle, you don't mind driving do you? We don't know him. You said you wanted to think of a way to thank me? This is a distraction from our stated goals. - You have your destiny, I have mine. - Fuck. <i>Dear Diary, it turns out that Daddy is a big, fat whore.</i> <i>I'm a lucky girl that I'm learning such valuable lessons</i> <i>about the true nature of men.</i> Oh, you like that. So what sort of work do you have in Vegas? Oh, it went right on my tooth. I'm a dancer. <i>Like on Fame.</i> Well, no. I'm not all that technical. I'm more free form. - Can you do splits? - You dance for tips, right? That's why you got all them singles. It's my art. If people want to give me money for my art, that just makes me a professional artist. Right, you're a stripper. - Erotic entertainer. - Stripper. Ow! Lots of people can't make a living doing what they love. You're lucky. You get me, don't you? Huh? - You do, don't you? - Stop. - I can do splits, too. - You are bad. Are you telling me my little boy's in California? - Sue-Ann? - I kept it from her too long. - How did this happen? - Oh, I don't know. I don't know. We are going to need to contact Danielle's father. What? Wait. No. - Wait a minute. - Do you have feelings for this. guy? - No, of course not! - It's written all over your face. We have an address. Do we have a phone number? You don't understand, he don't know about her. I don't know what I would say. I thought this part of my life was over. - It is over! - Look, Ray! Don't be like that, all right? Now this is a minor, little big deal, OK? I'm gonna take care of it and then we're gonna be real happy. This guy pops up out of nowhere, putting all my plans in peril. - If you could see yourself. - I am doing the best that I can! All right, everybody, calm down! Jesus H. Christ! Look, there is obviously a lot of feelings swirling around this place. But we need to stay focused. - Do you love me? - This isn't about you, sir. - Of course I do. - This is about our children. Now, as a father, you should understand that. Daddy? I need to go after her, Ray. And then you'll come back to me? Of course I will. Go get our girl. - I'm a shitty mother. - Join the club. - This is on you, right? - Sure thing. Oh, he is so fine. He's not gonna fuck you, Clarke. Just telling you. So start getting used to the idea. If you were a real friend, you wouldn't say stuff like that. - Clarke. - I gotta pee. Hey. Well, I sure do appreciate your hospitality, giving me a ride and all. If you make him any promises, you best follow through, motherfucker! <i>Now we got a nice tailwind,</i> <i>so our flight time to Bakersfield should be just under three hours.</i> <i>Sit back and enjoy the flight.</i> And I thought the Boy Scouts taught me nothing. Out of all the hitchhikers in the world, how did we get one so masculine and capable? Oh, well, you learn a few things when you're on your own. - Were you a Boy Scout, Clarke? - For like a week in second grade. They. They gave us these boxes of candy to sell door to door. I ate all mine, so my mom gave me the money to buy the whole box, so I wouldn't get in trouble. My dad was so mad. Said the two of us was in cahoots. My daddy took off when I was little. Like Dani's. Mine took off before I was born, so I win. Are we competing? I'm just saying I probably had it worse. You know what it's like then, don't you? That crazy thing when you look for him everywhere. Anytime you're in a crowd, there's a chance, so you walk around a little straighter, hoping to look your best, just in case. Looking everywhere for somebody who don't want to be found. I want to hear more about your art. Show us. - You guys are crazy. - Come on. We got the music, and the fancy lighting. - All that's missing is a pole. - It's cold out. Keeps everything perky. Aw, this one's too fast. I only dance to the slow ones. It's kind of my signature. All right, this one's a ballad. I cannot believe I'm doing this out in the middle of nowhere. You best appreciate it. I promise I do. OK, see now, the trick is to dance in your own world. Let them come to you. Joel? Hey. I know you don't want to hear this right now, but you will get over it. I fell in love last night, and now he's gone. - My one chance at happiness. - Stop acting like a girl. You drove him away. Clarke, I'm gonna stop this conversation right now until you adjust your thinking. Welcome to life, Clarke, you're just another tainted grown-up. Jesus Christ. There's no room in this world for a love like ours. They hate us for it. Shit! No. Shit. Shit, shit, shit! Agh! Stupid, fucking shit car! Joel would know what to do if he where here. - We'd best start walking. - Yes, you'd best. Clarke, let's go. You're the one with the reason to live. You walk. OK. You know what? When I get to the next town I'm gonna call your father! Agh! - Fuck! - Fine! Do I look OK? He is gonna die. <i>All right, mister. Your time is up.</i> We found your car. You found it? - Here you go. - Thank you. - Do y'all have a pillow I could use? - Sure. One tank of gas, $15. I'll have my dad give you a ride back to your car. Will that be cash or charge? - Charge. - Cash. I am sick of paying your way. You're hateful, and ungrateful. - Don't be an asshole. - You got an emergency fund. Use it. I can't. Why spend your own money when you can spend somebody else's, right? I don't have it anymore. You spent it? The only cash we have? You are a selfish bitch. - What did you buy yourself, huh? - It's what I bought you! I wanted to do something nice for you, to thank you. Hm? And you liked him so much. He didn't think I was sexy. I'm sure he did. It was just extra encouragement. Clarke! I need your credit card. That's what I get for marrying a faggot. This'll just be a minute. Collect, from Clarke. - Clarke, run! Run! Shit! Uh. - What? Hey, get back here! Come on, Dad, come on! What the fuck? I'm gonna call the cops, you stay with them! Your card's been reported stolen! They're gonna know where we are! Shit! Shit! Danielle wait up, where you going? Hey. I want to enter the stripping competition. - Where's the sign-up sheet? - You're looking at him. - Great. - It wouldn't exactly be appropriate. I'm young, but I got the moves. Trust me. - He'll vouch for me, OK? - She's done her research. That prize money's mine. Come on, give me a chance. Jade wins every night. But if you think you can win these boys over, be my guest. Mister, you don't know who you're dealing with. Let's hear it for Jade! Beginning of the second chorus, that's when you throw the water on me. - You got it? - Dani, you don't have to do this. - Don't look at me like that. - Like what? Like you don't approve. Just, don't show them nothing, OK? - I won't. - Promise? I'll just bat my eyelids and shake my shoulders. - I'm sure Jade's got nothing on me. - Sure. - You got a better idea? - We can go home. - Got your music? - Yeah. You're up, young'un. Second chorus, Clarke. <i>For all you boys who like 'em young, we got a special treat.</i> A little lady thinks she can unseat the undisputed champion. Direct from Tornado Alley, 90 pounds of dynamite! It's Danielle! Get off my stage! - Tough crowd. - Them boys like it from Jade. Ain't nobody sexier than Danielle. Oh! I beg your pardon. Oh, my God. They're gay! Dani, stop! - They're gay, Dani! - What? - They're gay. - But they're so ugly. - Let's get you out of here. - No. - We can't give up now. - Danielle, they don't like you. - You have to do it. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - I am not like you. What would Joel do? <i>OK, see now, the trick is to dance in your own world.</i> <i>Let 'em come to you.</i> Yeah! Whoo! - By an overwhelming majority. - Jesus Christ! .and winner of the 50-dollar prize money, - the new champ is. - Clarke! This is fucking kidnapping, you ugly motherfucker! Hey! I don't need any of your goddamn lip! And don't you hit my car! It's because of you my son's gone completely off the deep end. Your son was a miserable, whiny, dishrag before I got my hands on him. Yeah, and you turned him into a full-blown cocksucker, didn't you? It's over for you, boy. Soon as we drop your little friend off here, your ass is going straight to the military academy. I'm gonna pull this car over right now, goddamn it, - and set your ass at the curb. - And what are you gonna do, huh? Smack her around? Knock some sense into her? That's enough of your shit, Clarke. I'll tell you what. I like cocks. Jesus Christ! What did you just say, Clarke?! - I like the dreamy, creamy taste. - Shut the fuck up, Clarke! Somebody pass me a cracker for all that dick cheese! God! Jesus Christ! Take the money, take Joan, - and get out of here. - I mean her, I know! If I'm good at anything, it's how to take a punch. Trust me. - OK, when I say run, you run. OK? - Hey, don't touch him! You don't say that kind of shit to your dad! - Get off me! - Don't you hurt him! Go! Run, Dani, run! - Run, Dani! - Fuck! Why the fuck are you like this? <i>Dear Diary.</i> <i>. Daddy had to leave.</i> <i>As daddies sometimes do.</i> <i>He left so the dreams of our family could come true.</i> <i>But Mommy will soldier on.</i> <i>Because that is what mommies do.</i> We're here. Where's my father? Danielle. We should just head on home now, OK? - Is that his wife? - Yes, it is. - Can I go say hello to her? - No, you may not. We have caused these people enough trouble. Can I come in? I'm really tired and I need to use the restroom. Taxi! Wait, please, thank you. Where's my boy? His daddy found us. If he is hurt, I'm going to hold you personally responsible, young lady. - OK, OK. - Let go! No, no! No! You. You get back here! You get back here. You listen to your mama! You come back here! Baby! Come on. Danny Briggs? You must be Sue-Ann's little girl. Uh-huh. Damned if you ain't the spitting image of your mama. Yeah. People think we're sisters all the time. - You can't be here! - It's OK, Janet. Daniel, this is not what we discussed. Just go back inside, all right? It's fine. Just go inside, let us talk. Go on. Hey. Don't mind her, she's a little upset. Them boys you sold the house to, told me she was kind of high-strung, and all. I was prepared in my mentality. That makes you a pretty smart girl. You know, the secret to making a good burger is to only flip it once. - Hey. - I knew. I knew it. It's OK. It's OK. These last few days have been really strange for me, Danielle. I hadn't seen your mom in such a long time. Yeah, it must be weird. Yeah, weird's a good word. It was weird. Super-duper weird. Even better, super-duper weird. I like that one. Danielle, I didn't know about you. - She didn't tell you? - No. I mean. I thought she was gonna get rid of it. I'm. I'm not proud of myself, Danielle. She decided to keep me? I had no idea. You know what this means? What? It means I don't have to forgive you for running out on us. And I was kind of looking forward to that. It would mean a lot to me if you did just that. If you'd forgive me. Done. Bet you missed a lot of school coming to see me like this. Only a couple of days. I brought my homework. Well, you gotta be in a hurry to get back. I mean, your friends, this time of year in school. I don't know what Sue-Ann told you but our situation ain't really ideal. And I know it's a shock, me being here and all. But if it would be all right, and I know it would take a lot of adjusting. Honey, honey. You can't stay here. I'd keep my room real nice. Danielle, I'm a stranger to you. You're my daddy. You seem like you're a really sweet girl. And I know that I'd be very proud of you. Don't bet on it. But you just. Daddy? Who's that? Sweetie, this is one of my students. Why don't you run on back inside, OK, and finish your nap? - Hi. - What's your name? Danielle. What's yours? - Tiffany. And you know what? - What? My daddy's taking me to Disneyland on my birthday. Wow, that makes you a really lucky girl. Hey, hey, the tickle monster's coming. Where you going? Got you, I got you! I want you to go upstairs and be a good girl and finish your nap now, OK? - Bye, Danielle. - Bye, Tiffany. I'm sorry about that. - She's real cute. - Yes, she is. Yeah. I bet she's your pride and joy. You could say that. I think I need to go, huh? Probably be a good idea. Mommy. Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby. I'm so stupid. Oh, God, I love you. Will you help me? Sure. Oh, isn't he something, that hair? Yeah, I think he's cute, that one. He's got beautiful eyes. Oh, he's dreamy. Maybe I'll hang this up in my room. I think Ray wouldn't like that very much. I think this one's cute, up here. Yeah, he is. You are so bad. You're my daughter. You learned from the best. - Mrs. Gardner. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to see how Clarke's doing. - Oh. Well, um. he's gonna be fine. - It's all gonna be fine. - Is he at that school? There's a lot going on here, so that's the best place for him right now. Where's his daddy? He's getting himself a little apartment. I broke up your family. I'm so sorry. You did not break up our family. You have all these ideas about what it is to be a good parent. And everybody says that if you just do your best, that's all that matters. But. it's not true. I mean, if your best stinks, then what good are you? I don't mean to do you no disrespect, ma'am but Clarke would rather be with you. Danielle. Tell your mama I said hello. <i>I guess you could say our little girl's</i> been through a whole lot in her short life. She's learned that sometimes you got to accept what life throws at you. But only after a really good fight, to find out what you're made of. It's the fight that makes the accepting bearable. Very nice, Danielle. - I'm not done. - OK. She also misses her daddy a whole lot. And hopes that someday her family will be brought back together 'cause it's real fun. <i>You've come a long way, Danielle.</i> Miss Hatcher says you're doing great, that you're more involved. I even hear you signed up for the talent show. I'm working on being a more traditional type of person. I might be taking a risk here, but if you promise that I can trust you, I'll put you back with the normal kids. Can I trust you? Good. Let's hear it for Perpetual Motion. And now for the musical stylings of Miss Danielle Edmonston. Clarke wanted this here to be a duet. May sound corny, but this is for my baby's daddy. And this here's his favorite song. # Baby cried the day the circus came to town # 'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her # So she painted on a smile and took off with some clown # And she danced without a net up on the wire # I know a lot about her 'cause you see # Baby is an awful lot like me # Don't cry out loud # Just keep it inside # Learn how to hide your feelings # Fly high and proud # And if you should fall # Remember you almost had it all # Baby saw that when they pulled the big top down # They left behind her dreams among the litter # And the different kind of love she thought she'd found # There's nothing there but sawdust and some glitter # But baby can't be broken 'cause you see # She had the finest teacher, that was. # I taught her. # Don't cry out loud # Just keep it inside # Learn how to hide your feelings # Fly high and proud # And if you should fall # Remember you almost had it all # Don't cry out loud # Just keep it inside # Learn how to hide your feelings # Fly high and proud # And if you should fall # Remember you almost had it all # <i>Dear Diary,</i> <i>this world is full of dipshits.</i> <i>But guess what? Mommy got a fairy-tale ending.</i> <i>Because Daddy?</i> <i>Daddy came back.</i> So they let you out for good behavior or something? My mama came and got me. Said she was compelled. What did you do to your hair? - You don't like it? - Hell, no. Better? I'm glad you're back. I don't know, I kind of miss that place. Shut up. In a school with no girls, I was very popular. - You fucking whore. - Thank you. Remember, Clarke, nobody likes a dirty girl. Right. [SOARING VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYS] [KITE WHOOSHES] [RHYTHMIC TRUMPETS] Footballers! Fifty grand a week! That's ten grand a day. Well, it's a five-day week. I mean, one game a week. Two max. And they only train till midday, so that's like. ten grand a working day. So what gems does Little Miss Cosmo have for you this week? Well, I'm reading about something called, erm, multiple orgasm. Don't listen. They make that shit up. Well, apparently not. Yeah. Well, multiple orgasms stop when you get married. Something to do with church weddings. The blessing takes care of all that. In the eyes of God, one climax per session is enough. Well, if that were the case, I'd go to church. Multiple orgasms, really (!) We make do with one at a time. Do you see us complaining? No. There you go. 'Cause you're asleep. Ho-ho-ho! [GIGGLES] Well, Mandy from Oxford here has at least ten orgasms a day. I told you, they make it up. So, by your maths that's what? Fifty orgasms a week. Unless she's on a Cup run. Ow! Christ, I've just come. Jamie! Oh, and another! Shut up! People will start staring. It's Hampstead Heath. They think you're weird if you're not having sex. Ooh, and another. [LAUGHS] Seven more and I could move in with Mandy from Oxford. [SIGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] Would you mind if I? Oh, no, of course. Do you come here often? Is that the best you have? [CHUCKLES] Yes, I'm afraid it is, yes. Oh. Oh, don't worry. I. I shan't be asking you to dance. I find this very comforting. The view? Yes. Ah, it's wonderful to know that some things. just stay. Although I could do without that bloody tower! WOMAN: Oh, really? I love it. I love it that for a while at least, we had ambitions beyond concrete. Hm. Do you ever wonder what would have happened if that chap in Pudding Lane had noticed that fire starting all those centuries ago, and then just put it out? I suppose the whole of London would be wooden. Hm. Yes, imagine the splinters. [LAUGHS] By the way, I do. What? Come here often. Do you? Every Wednesday, as a matter of fact. To this very bench. Well, I never. Be careful who you ask next time. Yes, I will. Well, that is extraordinary. It's just a habit. How long have you been coming here? Oh. Oh, nearly 50 years. That's a lot of Wednesdays. Not as many as it might be. I'm a strict observer of holidays. Nice view? Sorry? Can you get all of that, or would you like me to move for you? What are you talking about, darling? [LAUGHS] You are so pathetic. Oh, good God! Yeah, isn't he? She should be careful. In case some pervy man were to stare at her pants? Well, yeah. Yeah. I saw you. Saw me what? Staring at her. Staring at her pants. That's ridiculous. She's very beautiful. Do you think? Yeah. Young, pert. And what is it you and your mates say? About what? Stomach like a snare drum. We don't say that. Right. So what were you looking at, then? 'Cause I saw you. Oh! Oh, that! Oh, God, did you think I? Oh, that's funny. No, it was. It was her book. Oh, right. Her book. Yeah. Right. And what book would that be, then? [IN ENGLISH ACCENT] "Le. tranger". "L'√âtranger". Er, yeah. You know it, do you? Oh, it's seminal. Albert Camus, unless I'm mistaken. It is, yeah. Made quite an impact on me as a teenager. Really? Oh, Camus. Camus. Yeah, that book, er, changed my life. Oh, I noticed she was reading it, and thought, "Well, "you don't see it about that often. " So, what's it about, then? Sorry? Well, this book that changed your life. What's it about? I'm not going to get into that now. Oh, come on. The book that changed my husband's life, I should know about. [SIGHS] Go on. You know I love a good story. Well, you know, it's, er. It's French. Mm. About a man who is an. √©tranger. Right. A stranger, basically. Yeah. Anyway, he goes on quite an adventure. You know, new man in town, the locals are difficult to break. Mm-hm. He starts off as a stranger, and through a series of beautifully crafted events he eventually becomes accepted as the new. sheriff. Sheriff? Yeah. It's kinda like a. French. western. Well, that does sound life-changing. Yeah, it was. Mm, mm. Molly? Molly, what are you? I'm so sorry to disturb you, but I was just wondering if you could help me. Of course. We should leave her alone. She doesn't mind. Do you? No, I don't mind. Well, all the same. What can I do for you? I just couldn't help noticing the book you're reading. Really? "L'√âtranger"? Oui. It's truly a wonderful piece of writing. Well, do you know what? My husband was just saying so. Really? You know it? Oh, yeah. I mean, I read it. A few years ago. Isn't Meursault an extraordinary character? His inability to lie, and his ability to live so much in the present. Amazing creation. Uh, yeah. And still he ends up sheriff. Sorry? Jesus! No, I was just saying, isn't it remarkable, that he can be so truthful and still wind up as sheriff. Molly. [IN AMERICAN ACCENT] He just clears up that town. I think you. You may have the book a little confused. Oh, really? Well, yes. This is a book about the, er. fundamental existential crisis of a man unable to live under the restrictions that society imposes upon him, upon all of us. So. it's not a western? [WHISPERS] No. Is there something wrong? We should leave now. Actually, no, no, no. Come here. Erm, I'd actually like to apologise on behalf of my husband. Apologise? Yeah. I'm afraid he's been staring at your pants. Oh, for God's sake, Molly. I'm sorry about my wife. She's had too much sun. No, on the contrary, it's my husband who's been affected by the heat. But a little bit of advice for you. Next time you're sunbathing on the Heath, you might want to be more careful. It's full. of perverts. Pack up the things. We're going now. I'm really very sorry. Erm. [GIGGLES] I should. Were you really looking at me? Yes. Yes, yes, I was. Well. That is quite frightening. Oh, God. This is. Look, I'm gonna. I really am very sorry. She gets very jealous. When you stare at other girls' underwear? Well, I don't very often stare, but yeah. I suppose in such a circumstance she would manifest jealousy. And what about you? Me? You. Are you the jealous type? Oh, God, no. Molly can stare at who she likes. It's fine. Really? Well, apart from Jude Law, but that's more of a. talent issue. Look, I'm gonna. I really am very, very sorry. Would you. Would you like to look again? Sorry? Would you like to have another look? Sorry, another look at. Yes. Erm. We all need a look now and again. Like Meursault in the heat. Yes, like Meurs. [WHISPERS] Thank you. Is that the right thing to? Why not? You're welcome. J AMIE: Molly! So, tell me. Why did you break the habit? Break it? Yes, it's Thursday. Thursday? Yes. Are you sure? Yes, of course. No, no. It's definitely Wednesday. Oh, no, no. No, no, it can't be. Oh? Because I always come here on Thursdays. Are you being. a wag? No, no. I come to this bench to look at that view on Thursdays. So, er, it must be Thursday. Or one of us has got it wrong. [LAUGHS] What are you gonna do? You want me to go? I want you to make a decision. Okay. Okay, fine, I will. If I go, then. You bore me, Ludo, you bore me. I bore you? Yeah, you bore me to death. I'm so bored. I'm bored right now. You're unbelievable. You're unbelievable! Yes, you said that. It's not interesting. Now make a fucking decision! And make sure it's not a dull one. You're making me do this. Take responsibility for yourself. You all right? You all right, love? It's just I was walking by. I couldn't help but notice you, staring out into the middle distance a bit like a nutter. I mean, look, if you are a nutter, enough said. But you don't strike me as your bona fide mental. I haven't actually met any real-deal headcases but they don't generally look like you, because I've seen 'em on the TV. And if they did look like you, then I would be down there smeared in my own shit quicker than you could say, "Pass me your underpants, nurse. " You with me? Ahh. Look, if I've misjudged things, then, erm. Sorry. You for real? Oh, she speaks. I speak. Which is good to know. What do you mean, right, when you said if they all look like me? Sorry? What exactly do I look like? Well, er, you're a. You're a good-looking bird. A yummy mummy? Well, yeah, if you like. I don't have kids. Right, well, that's even better, then. Is it? Yeah, yeah. Do you have kids? Bloody hell! I haven't even bought you a drink yet. You're too young to be a father. I am. How old? Twenty-five. No, that's not too young. Well. You know, maybe it's not too young, but it's definitely young. Compared to what? Er, to what? You, you're young. Compared to what? Erm. Er. The telephone. Yeah, I'm definitely young compared to the telephone. [LAUGHS] You are. [LAUGHS] So, what are you young compared to? What's that? What's old compared to you? What kind of fucking question is that? Why? What kind of moronic fucking question is that? It was your moronic fucking question. I just. It's okay. You can leave now. Oh. Oh, can I (?) Yeah, you can go now. Oh, right. Okay. So, you're all right, then? Fine. Thanks for your concern. [EXHALES] My name's Noel. [CLEARS THROAT] Noel? As in, er, Gallagher. And Edmonds. Oh. God. Crushes. What's your name? Anna. Oh, as in Kournikova. As in, I'd quite like to spend some time by myself. No offence. Okay, none taken. I'll leave you to it. Thanks for your concern, though. It's a'right. You already did that. What you doing? I'm leaving you to it, yeah? Okay? Now, if you don't mind, be quiet, because I need some still. Mm? You have got some front. You know, you shouldn't be feeding me lines like that. Are you seriously not gonna leave? No. I could scream. So, scream. I could get you arrested. I could say that you tried to touch me. Well, if I'm going down for it. You know what? I think I'm punching above my weight. I'm just gonna leave you to it. I'm sorry. You can stay. Uh. Oh. I don't mind if I do. [CLEARS THROAT] What makes you think that someone like you has any chance whatsoever with someone like me? Y'know, I don't remember asking if I did. Come on, you've been drooling since you saw me. I have not. Look, I just. I saw a girl who looked upset and I made sure that she was all right and then I decided to do a spot of meditation. And there was no drool involved. You are out of your mind. Seriously, eh? You're fucking with my ch'i. Molly! Oh, come on, Molly! [INHALES DEEPLY] My boyfriend just left me. Where? Here, just now. Ludo. Ludo? What, as in the.? As in boring, middle-aged twat. Shut up. [BOTH LAUGH] Has anybody ever told you that you have great eyes? Oh, sorry. Are we in Stringfellows? No, really, you do. Make an effort. No, you do. You have great eyes. Which is lucky. Lucky? Yeah. Because they tend to pull focus from your nose. What's wrong with my nose? Nothing's wrong with your nose. You have a great nose. You have a great fuckin' nose. Are you seriously trying to tell me that I've got a big nose? Not big. Well, what, then? What I'm sayin' is that it doesn't matter what kind of nose you have, because those eyes will always overpower it. Overpower?! You happen to have a beautiful nose. My point is that those eyes are so good that even if you had a ridiculous nose it wouldn't matter, which you don't. But if you did, I wouldn't notice, which I didn't until now. And now I look, it's a great nose. Yeah, it's great. You have a great nose. You've just got no idea who you're dealing with. I'm damaged. We're all damaged, babe. Who the fuck do you think you are? Arriving out of nowhere, asking me all sorts of personal questions, when clearly I'm upset about something, which, incidentally, has fuck all to do with you. And then you sit here next to me, you sit there. Me, an attractive, single, vulnerable woman. You sit here next to me, and tell me that I've got a beautiful nose. You know, how fucking dare you! Yeah, I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry. Um. I'm sorry that I complimented you. It was very insensitive of me. Yes, it was a crap line. Oh. Not a hint of originality. Crap men are one thing, but crap lines are unforgivable. All right. Okay, okay. The whole thing was a line. All of this was a line, you know. I saw you rowing with, er, Monopoly. Ludo. Yeah, with him. Okay? And I thought, well, you know, she is very, very fit. And I. And very, very vulnerable. And I am very, very horny. So, yeah, you're right. I know I'm right. Well, so, you are. I know. So, how did I do? Shit. Well, you can't blame me for trying. You can't blame me for telling you to fuck off. No. So, go on, then. Well, erm. You didn't scream. You're right. I am? Let's do it. Do it? What are you sayin'? I'm saying I want to fuck you. You're saying you wanna? Yeah, I wanna fuck you. You're saying that. I wanna fuck you. You need to stop sayin' that. Yeah, because, erm, now you're really confusing me. I wasn't coming over here to ask you if you wanted to fu. I was just gonna ask you if you wanted to go out for a drink. Yeah, and I just told you that I want to fuck you. To fuck me. Yeah, yeah. Oh. Erm. Do you? As a rule, I like not to ask more than a dozen times. Right, yeah. Okay, okay. What, really? Yeah, I wanna have sex with you. With me? Yeah, I wanna fuck you. You're not being mental again? So, wait, so what you sayin'? All these. the lines that I. Those crap lines, well, actually, they all worked? No, they were shit. Oh. In fact, if you'd said nothing, I might have fucked you earlier. I thought for a moment that you might interest me, but, no, there was nothing. That's wonderful. Well, we'll see what it is. Come on. Well, um, what, now? Okay. Erm, right. Well, where do you live? 'Cause I'm, erm, like a bus ride away. Here. Here? What? Now? Right here. Here? There. Wh. Wh. NOEL: Errr. Can you do these? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hang on. Bit stuck. Bit stuck. You wanna do this, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait. Oh, yeah. What? You can fuck off. You bore me. [DOG GROWLS] Fuck off! [DOG BARKS] NOEL: What you want from me? [DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE] I've often wondered about Cheryl and Brian. Who? Ah. Do you think they were happy? Well, who knows? Least they were together. Ahh, is that happiness? Well, I suppose we'll never know about them. Well, I think they met during the War. And he went off to fight in France, and she stayed behind in London, slaving away in the munitions factories. Both of them wondering when or if they would see one another again. And intense and terrifying start, which propelled them through the hardships and the difficulties, and on. You know, like a fully taut bow and arrow. The greater the tension before it launches, the further it goes. Well, I think love's like that. And I've always felt Cheryl and Brian achieved great distance because of it. Other people's stories are always fascinating. Have you achieved great distance? We have now. She's dead, and I'm in Cricklewood. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Has a wonderful dentist. Cricklewood? Oh, heaven. But such very long waiting lists. Yes. What about you? Tommy died five years ago. Forty-three years of marriage. Oh, well done. He was a sweet man. Very sweet man. But this bench was my little secret. I never came here with him in all those years. There was a time in the early '80s when he thought I was having an affair, because I wouldn't tell him where this place was. Oh, I used to tell him I was visiting my son. Anything, just to get here. It was always important to me to have my little place. My little bench. My little view. You have a son? Yes. Oh, he's in his 40s now. Eddie. Oh. Oh, that's my name. So, why here? Why this bench? [SIGHS] There was a boy. We were 17. We only met twice. We met here. I was engaged to Tommy. He was engaged to. I don't remember her name. And things. They were different times. Teresa. What? The woman he was engaged to. She was called Teresa. And he was called Eddie. And she was called. Iris. He's not your type. How would you know? You're my partner. It's not the same thing at all. He is. [YOUNGER MAN LAUGHS] God, you're not wrong there. Why are you always reading? Why? Yeah. Why? You know what, Billy? You should read some more. You might learn something about yourself. There's nothing I need to learn about myself that he couldn't teach me. Fair point. [LAUGHS] I met this guy the other night. Oh, yeah? He had one of those smiles. What, the sort that says, "I have no self-respect"? No, the sort that says "I'll give you the best blow job "you've ever had. " Oh, that one. And did he? Come on, there are rules. Mm, the rules. There've gotta be rules, Bri. You dirty bastard. You fucking love it. Look, I've been thinking. I told you. Two's company. I know, and three's a night out, but it's not about that. What, you're not talking about sex? No. They said this day would come. I just didn't believe them. You're finally gonna let me have a garden? I'm not spending the rest of my days in "The Good Life". Oh, "The Good Life". When I was a kid, I used to really fancy Penelope Keith. Margo (?) She's got a touch of the Maggie Thatchers. Oh, you were such a confused child. Oh, don't tell me you fancied Richard Briers? Oh, don't be sick. Felicity Kendal every time. Oh, fuck off. No, seriously. I mean, those dungarees, man. I swear, if I met her today I'd still love to have a go. Anyway, you should spend less time being nostalgic. Nothing wrong with nostalgia. A little bit, maybe, but you can be nostalgic about breakfast. I told you, you should read more. Penelope Keith (!) What a minger! Well, let's face it. We've never had the same taste in women. Ah. So, what were you thinking? When? Just now. You said you'd been thinking. Or has that thought already nestled itself in one of the cavernous empty corners of your mind? Imagine the millions of tiny thoughts there must be scrabbling around, looking for a way out before their last gasping breath finally deserts them and they become another distant memory of something that was once a half-decent idea. You should read less. I know. I promise, as soon as you commit to me for life, I absolutely will. [SIGHS] [WINCES] Oh. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Come to Daddy. MAN: All right. What do you reckon? MAN 2: Jesus Christ! MAN: Bit of a monster, eh? Come on. MAN 2: Oi, oi, oi! No, no. No means no. MAN: You walked in with your dick out. That's 'cause I need a piss. Well, go somewhere else. Some of us have sex here. Christ. Urgh. Where have you been? I think I get to ask the questions. Dirty little. Aren't you? Hello. Where's Eve? She's just coming. [CHILDREN CHATTER] Still need a piss. You don't have to pretend to me. It's the 21 st century. It doesn't have the stigma it used to have. Very funny. Give us a kiss. You've always been the greatest kisser. Thanks. You're not so bad yourself. A shame your friend never found out. Okay, we can drop that now. Any time you like. Ahhh. Come on, Eve. Daddy needs a wee-wee. Go and find another hedge. No chance. No way. God, you know, I fail to see how some men can find sex with men in any way appealing. Struggle to see how women can. You underestimate your immense sexual magnetism. I'm not the only one. Oh, poor baby, not getting any? Look, before Eve gets here, I brought the papers. You? Yeah. Decree absolute. Feels very final. Isn't that the point? I suppose so. Do you, Sarah Louise Williams, hereby agree to never laying any claim to the life and emotions of this man, Peter Brian Maxwell? I do. Mm. And do you, Peter Brian Maxwell, hereby consent to never ringing up this woman, Sarah Louise Williams, after you've had a few beers and are in desperate need of a bunk-up? I. I do, I do, I do. Christ, that hurt. Well, maybe we could break the rules once in a while. Oh, just the once? Oh, what about Saturdays when. GIRL: Daddy! Daddy. Hello, gorgeous. How's my little princess? Mummy bought me a brand-new bicycle. Wow. Is it wonderful? It's the best bicycle in the world. Well, that's what happens when mummies and daddies get divorced. The children always get lovely presents. I like your divorce, Daddy. I think Mummy is much happier. Is she? Well, so is Daddy, which makes you a very lucky little girl. Why am I lucky? Well, because you have a mummy and a daddy who are. who are very happy. Bet none of your friends can say that. I love you, Mummy, but I want two mummies like Amy. Mm. Do you know what a dyke is? What? It's a d. Dam. Well, it's a big hill. Holds lots of water. Water. Do you know what? Can we walk a little bit, love? 'Cause Daddy really needs to find a toilet. She's seven. Yeah, right. Dam. Damn's not a nice word. Oh, come on. Damn this. Damn that. Well, every Wednesday. For nearly 50 years. Huh. Shall we, um? Shall we what? Well, I don't know. We could, um. What? Attack the summit. Mm? Gosh. It's a long time since. Me too. [SIGHS] So, how does it feel? Well, it feels like I haven't pissed in a month. I meant about being divorced. Oh. Feels good. SARAH: I knew. Knew what? We were married for the wrong reasons. What was it about us tying the knot that just stopped everything? Well, I think we just ran out of things to say. And it often happens in a relationship. Some people get to the point where they say things like "I've met someone else" or "I just can't do this any more". And I went for. "Will you marry me?" And you went for "Yes. " The wedding didn't stop anything. It'd stopped years before. We both knew that. [SIGHS] But that wedding night, though. Ho-ho! That was something else, you animal! I was angry. I mean, well, nothing beats angry sex. Yeah, I was furious. You're not joking. See, that's where we went wrong. I've worked it all out. I've spent a lot of time thinking about it on the loo. The thing is, we got married and then we got wound up. And we should've got angrier much earlier. [GROWLS] You're insane. No, I'm happy. And I haven't had sex in a year. A year? Who was that? It was you. There was only you. I know. Shame sex isn't enough. Yeah, shame, indeed. Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come to Daddy. Yes, yes, yes. No, no. Was it here you dropped it? Yeah? I can't find it now. It's gone. No. No. Bollocks, bollocks. Bollocks, no. I hate beautiful girls. If she'd have been ugly. I love the fact I know nothing about men's minds. Never overestimate us. Oh, I don't. My mother told me something once when I was a child. The only thing she ever truly did tell me. EVE: Mummy. Daddy. If you want to know the way to a man's heart, it's simple. Yeah, through his stomach. Through his shirt with a bread knife. Ouch! This is for you, Daddy. Oh, thank you, baby. Pete, there is one thing I would like to know. Oh, look. We're fickle, sexually frustrated liars, who think that settling down is the same as settling for. No, I mean about us. Oh? Well, you're still the most attractive man I've ever met. You make me laugh. You're a great dad. You earn good money. And yet I still know you're wrong. Well. Well, what? Look, I have no idea what's right for you, or, for that matter, what's right for me. Maybe I'm too picky. Oh, don't be too hard on yourself. We both know that we know nothing. Except one thing. What? That we both want this divorce. Except that. Come here. Ah, yeah. Oh. SCOTTISH MAN: How you doin', big man? PETE: No. For God's sake. Ahhh. Oh, yeah. Oh. Uh. Uh-huh. Mm-hm. Hallelujah. Hallelu-jahhh. Ahh. Better? [MIMICS SEAN CONNERY] Oh, yes, better. Love you. I love you, too. Come on, baby. Come on. There you go. Ohh. Give Mummy a kiss. You're spending the day with Daddy. PETE: Ah, now, don't run, don't run. I can't catch up with you. EVE: Come on. PETE: Not too far. IRIS: It was a beautiful day. I wanted a big do, but Tommy found all that embarrassing, so we ended up with a few friends in the old civic hall in Belsize Park. Oh, God, I used to play darts in there. We had a huge wedding. You know, church, reception. All the trappings. I've always liked a do. I'm finding this very odd. Isn't it? You know, I can really see you now. You have the same. That thing you do with the corner of your mouth. EDDIE: Maybe it would have been better if we'd, you know, died, not knowing. Knowing what? Can I tell you something? Shall we stop walking, or is this something I can take in my stride? No, no, no. Momentum plays a great part in my life, and I'd very much like to get to the top of that summit. IRIS: I think you're right. If we stop now, we might need a push. So, what was it you wanted to tell me? You've always been my perfect woman. You stopped. I know. I think that was because I wasn't real. Hm. But you are now. Well. they do say you should never come face to face with fantasy. Wednesdays and Thursdays. You know, I can't believe this is the first time that I got the day wrong. I mean, was it fate? You know, was it planned like this? I mean, why do you think? So that for 50 years you could be 17 and handsome. Do you think we're ever going to get to the top? You know, up there where the kites live? It'd be silly not to try. I mean, on a day like this. I used to spend a lot of time up there, but it suddenly got steeper. I think it was some time in the early '90s. Yes, yes, that's right. Did they do it deliberately, so us oldies would have to put up with the inferior view? Well, I should like to defeat them. Right, give me a few steps. I'll get into my rhythm. [MOBILE RINGS] Hello. Now, where might you be? WOMAN [ON PHONE]: Were you looking at that girl? Yeah. WOMAN: Do you think she was nice? Yeah, she was. Very nice. Where the hell are you? You're late. I booked you for three o'clock. WOMAN: Well, I'm a busy girl. You spying on me? Maybe. Okay, I'm busted. Where are you? Hello? Hello? I've only been away a week, and already you're window-shopping. Come here, you gorgeous thing. [SHE MOANS SOFTLY] It's good to see you. You too. Are we walking or sitting? Let's see. I'm feeling a walk. Okay. WOMAN: So, how was the funeral? MAN: It went very well. My grandfather always used to say to me, "You stay in the game long enough, the cards'll eventually turn up. " The lottery of life. He sounds like a wise man. He was. And he was killed by the thing he loved. Great way to go. Shame it was a train. But he died happy. I just hope he got the number. [LAUGHS] Have you ever thought about it? What? How you'd like to die? Have you? God, yes. I've narrowed it down to two exits. Peacefully in my sleep, or drowned in a Jacuzzi after an overdose of champagne poured down my throat by Thierry Henry. You be careful what you wish for. I'm safe. He's married. He's a footballer. He's not the affair type. He's a French footballer. You haven't answered my question. What? Have you thought about it? Actually, I have. Well? Murdered by a jealous husband. Now stop being morbid. Do you want a cigarette? I quit. When? At Mum and Dad's. They don't know I smoke. How old are you? That's not the point. It would upset them. But you're a. A what? A smoker. Well, I'm not any more. Okay. Do you mind if I smoke? No. Can I bring up the "H" word? Oh, come on, babe. We need to go away. When was the last time you had a holiday? I don't do holidays. You know that. I know, but, well, I'm just thinking about you. Dah-dah! Two tickets. The Mariott Hotel on Spaniards Beach in. Barbados. Yeah. How on earth did I find you? I found you, remember? [MEN CHATTER AND LAUGH] Eve. Why don't we go and get an ice-cream? Again? Some days you need two ice-creams. And it just so happens this is one of those days. There's more to life than thoughts. There's actions. Yeah. What sort of actions are playing on your mind? Kids. Kids? Kids. Do you think you could not shout the word "kids" while we're sitting here? People might think we're, um, teachers or something. I'm serious. So am I. Kids?! Now you're doing it. You want to talk about them, or you want to have them? I think I do. I think I really want to have them. Uh, Billy, you're gay. So are you. It doesn't fuckin' matter any more. We can adopt. I know we're legally allowed to adopt, but. But what? But. I'm not ready. You're not ready? You're in your 40s. I know straight men in their 40s who aren't ready. Yeah, but that's different. How's it different? Well, it's not down to them. It's not down to them? No, it's the woman's choice. A straight man can remove any sense of responsibility. We don't have that luxury. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and I've lived with you for 15 years. Look, I think they would be a great addition to our relationship. You can't have kids to add to your relationship. You have kids 'cause. you wanna have kids. Exactly. They're not just for Christmas. You know what you're like. You'll be bored within a month, and sending them back to whatever godforsaken home they came from. Don't be ridiculous. Look, I think they would be great for us. But would we be great for them? Why does nobody ever ask that question? I'm fed up with seeing people start families just 'cause they can. What about the kids? What about what they want? Oh, you sound like Cliff Richard. Stop. I'm serious. It's all, " Look at us, aren't we great for having a child? "Aren't we great for calling it Taramasalata? "Aren't we great for adding to the population of the world "and filling it full of our insecurities and fears? "Aren't we great?" Jesus. If there's one good thing about being gay, it's that we are, by definition, environmentally friendly. And that's it, is it? Well, no, we can also dress well without fear of ridicule. It might help me settle down. You're doing it again. "Let's have kids because it'll make my life better. " Do you seriously think people should have kids for purely altruistic reasons? Altruistic? Have you been secretly reading my books? We are all here because two people needed something more in their life than what they had. What's wrong with that? My parents didn't speak to one another for a year before I was born, and then I came along and everything got better. And they don't regret me coming along, and I certainly don't. I mean, admittedly, they haven't spoken to me in over ten years, but they didn't know they were creating a sexual deviant. Your parents are cave dwellers. They are a bad example. Yeah, but, look, my point is. that I am the result of truly selfish behaviour and I'm fuckin' made up about it. I can see. I love you, Brian. And I think having a child would be a. An amazing expression of how I feel. I know that sounds a bit Cliff. I just think there are enough parents in the world. Yeah, that's why they're closing down all the orphanages. I love kids as much as anyone else. I've got seven godchildren, for fuck's sake. You have seven godchildren, because you can't have any of your own and people feel sorry for you. Do they, bollocks! They think it's cool to have a gay influence. It's North London. Yeah, well, all that would stop. No more godkids. You'd be a father. What would you be? A father. Two fathers! What a nightmare. No, it's better than two mothers. That is sexist. You've met my mother. Fair enough. We'd have to move. You're thinking about it? I think we'd have to move. But you don't think it's out of the question. I don't know what I think. I think I'll have to have a think. Well, that's all I ask, Bri. Are you sure you wanna do this? No, I'm not sure. It just keeps playing on my mind. There are things to consider. Of course. One of us would have to give up work. Would we? Why? Well, of course. You can't bring up a baby if you're both working. Why? People do it all the time. Yeah, look at the little wankers they produce. No, I'm clear about that. If you're gonna commit to having a child, then one of you's got to stay at home. I had no idea you were so old-fashioned. No, I just don't believe you can do a good job with a child if you're both as interested in your work. That's just how I feel. Oh. No, maybe you're right. No, it's just how I feel. So, how much do you earn? You know how much I earn. Considerably less than me. Yeah. So, then, I suppose it would have to be you. You cannot make judgements on a financial basis. That's ridiculous. I bring in almost twice what you do. If we're going to be supporting a family, then, by your reckoning, you'd have to give up work. That's ridiculous. Why? 'Cause work is about more than money. It's about who you are. Well, who are you? I'm a restaurant critic. Oh. I'm a financial advisor. I get more pleasure out of my work so you should give up work. That's ridiculous. Without my income, we would be out of nappies within a fortnight. Well, without my job I'd be out of my mind in a week. No, it has to be about money. If I stopped working, how would we cope? I'd review more restaurants. It takes you almost a week to do one. Food is an art, Billy, something you will clearly never understand. No, I understand, I understand. Your art is much more important than my. What is it you call it? Crass pursuit of the impossible financial nirvana. You can be such a twat at times. You can be a twat at others. You know, we're suited. Are we gonna look into this, or not? Yeah. If you give up your work. Well, no way. I love what I do. Yeah, well, so do I. I'd give up all that, that's what I'd give up. All what? You would? I would. I promise. So I give up my job, and you give up the casual sex. But there's still a problem. What? I don't want kids. I just want you. I want both. We'll see. Do you fancy an ice-cream? Mm, all right. Be back in a minute. Tell me about your husband. Oh. I mean, you know, if you want to. Well, what do you want to know? Well, I don't know. What was he like? He was decent. No one had a bad word to say about him. Even you? Even me. Tommy loved spending time. He was never very big on plans. The future. He said the future was nothing. That what we had at any given moment, was what we had. He was a regular philosopher, then? I suppose he was in a way. I was more of a dreamer. I liked him. Mostly. Well, that's a big achievement. You know, after all those years. And you liked Teresa. Yes, but I couldn't help. wondering. Me too. Albert Camus. "L'√âtranger". Oh-la-la. It's French, right? Are you French? Yes, I am. Oh, you are French? Yes. I went to France once. Don't even think about it. Don't! Okay. Go away. All right, I'll go, then. Allez. Allez! I'm going. All right. D√©gage! Yeah. I'm going. D√©gage! OK! All right, all right, all right. You look nice, though, when you're angry. D√©gage. I saw a film once. It was one of those, uh. "boy meets girl, boy loves girl, "boy marries girl, girl meets another boy, "girl leaves boy, boy goes mad, "and boy kills other boy and girl, "and then boy goes to prison" kind of film. It was all, er, very stressful. Sounds it. I'm not sure I get the point. Well, I don't know, but I think I found a certain comfort in not being that boy. Or that girl. It's all extremely complicated. Tommy was right. It's a minefield. I think maybe it's good. Things that are completely impossible to understand. All the best things in life are utterly indecipherable. I mean, Tommy loved collecting first day covers. I would ask him, what is it about coloured envelopes that so intrigued him. He could never explain it. He said he liked them because they kept on coming, and his collection got bigger. It baffled me for years. And then there came a point, when I began to look forward to them arriving almost as much as he did. You see, once you commit yourself to something, however bizarre it may seem to other people, you kind of owe it to yourself to enjoy the experience. [SIGHS] I hope it's all been worth it. All those choices we make. You see what we've done? We've talked about our partners. I didn't think we'd do that, you know, if we met. [BELL CHIMES] Ooh. [CHUCKLES] Well, this should, er. Do it? Well. Yes, it should. It's perfect. Here. [BOTH LAUGH] [SHE SIGHS] [EXHALES] Ooh, I rather assumed. But if you don't. What is it? Chate√¢uneuf-du-Pape, '93. Good year. Do you think? Oh, I don't know. Whoops. Oh. No, no. Shall I be Mummy? Why not? Just hope it lives up to its billing. What is its billing? Well, I'm led to understand that this particular year is. light on the palate, a little oaky, but with an affectionate aftertaste. Mm. Oh, oh. Thank you. Cheers. Mm. Very smooth. Eh? [COUGHS] Yes. Do you not think? Smooth, indeed. Cheese? Er, yes, please. Although I should probably keep a close eye on it at my age. I know what you mean. I didn't mean I know what you mean about you having to keep a close. I mean I do, as well. Not that you do. Erm, no, I just put on weight walking past a boulangerie. A boulangerie. Sorry, it's French for bakery. Yes, I know. [CLEARS THROAT] Jeremy was telling me about your book collection. Was he? Yes. He says you can get hold of any book in print with 48 hours' notice. Yes, well, I'm not a collector, I'm a dealer. Oh, a dealer. Yes, yes. I buy and sell books. Jeremy likes to pretend to himself that it's some sort of hobby of mine or something. He did speak very highly of your "collection". Yes, well, it's just his little joke, I suppose. How about you? Me? Oh, I work for a charity. Very worthy. Isn't it? I'm sorry, I was just agreeing with you. Do you agree with everyone? No, of course not. I was being self-deprecating but, as it happens, charity work is very hard and very worthwhile. Yes, must be. What sort of people do you help? What sort of people? Yes, I mean, erm. poor people, starving people, black people? Black people? Yes. You think black people need help? Well. I think you might need some help. Well, that's very possibly true, but I meant Africans, not. I meant Africans, not black people as a race. You're wondering whether I was just being racist. No, not whether. Why. Is that racist? Yes. It's so tricky nowadays, don't you think? Tricky? I mean, last week I was told off for referring to my lovely newsagent as coloured. Instead of Asian. Asian? No, he's black. I think you may have been racist. Do you? Assuming he was Asian because he was a newsagent, when in fact he's from Somalia. My mother was asking me about work. Uh-huh. I said it was good. She didn't believe me. She's convinced I have no idea who I am or what I want. All mothers think like that. It's what connects them to their children. Well, I know she doesn't really understand what I do, but she won't let it go. She has no idea what you do? No. All she needs to know is that I love what I do. My point exactly. But she's proud of you. How do you know? Well, you told me. Hey, I tell you a lot of things. I'm like that. And that's why I love you. I know. Excuse me, mate, erm, can I get a light, please? Yeah, sure. Very nice. I'm sorry? Um, I said very nice. What's very nice? She looks very nice. Oh, do you want to fuck off? Erm. How dare you fucking talk to me like that? Go on, fuck off. Erm, sorry. I'm not having a very good day today. I'm sorry. Just leave. Can you believe that? What makes someone think it's remotely okay just to walk up to a man and say, "Your girlfriend's very nice"? "Very nice"? Unbelievable. There should be a law. Oh, I've missed you, Louis. Yeah? You too. [BOTH EXHALE] After finally climbing this infernal hill, after all those years of thinking about it, what you're saying is, the view is better from where we were. Well, on reflection, yes. I think you're right. It may not be as high, but it did seem clearer. I mean, maybe it's just what we're used to. I've never been a fan of change. Never been a risk taker. Apparently not. I'll never be Thierry Henry, you know. Well, that's good. It means you'll never be responsible for my champagne-infused death. Why do you like me, Esther? Why? Yeah. Why do you miss me? What is it about me that makes you pleased to see me? Are you fishing for compliments? No. I'm asking for them. Okay. I like you because you're honest. Mm-hm. I like you because you know how to listen, and you know when not to. I like you because when you take my hand and when you touch my neck you're not just touching, you're. I don't know. I like you. Do you want to know why I like you? I don't know. I think sometimes it's good to never quite know. It's good to guess. What? Keeps it interesting? Which is the most important thing in any relationship, no matter what kind. So you don't want to know why I like you? Well, of course I do. Do you think I'm mad? Good, 'cause I'm going to tell you. Go on. I like you because you don't try and change me. You just let me be myself. Is that it? That's it. There's nothing about my, er. wonderful sense of humour? My long legs? My sensitive touch? My witty repartee? No, those are the reasons I love you. We're talking about like. What? It's much easier to love someone than it is to like them. Okay. Yeah, I like that. Those things I said, they're why I love you, they're not why I like you. Okay. Do you want to know why I like you? No, I think I know. I think you do. When do I see you next? You tell me. We're not done yet, are we? I'm sorry. I've got things I need to sort out. And it's one fifty now. The agency changed the rates. Worth every penny. I can't wait for Barbados. I can't wait for next time. Maybe we could have sex. That's not how this works. I know. So, you never married? No. I was married. Yes. It was the most wonderful three and a half months of my life. Three and a half months? Well, you've got to give it a chance. So, has there never been anyone? Oh, yes, I'm not a. Relax. I'm talking about love, not sex. Have you ever been in love? No. Never? Not even as a teenager? No, absolutely not. Does that seem a little odd? Odd? Well. a little, yes. I suppose it is. I mean, everywhere I look, people seem to be falling in love or talking about it or claiming it. Mm. Playing it out. Playing it out? I like that. Do you think I could have another? Ooh, yes. I think it is living up to its billing after all. I'm. I'm glad. I never wanted children. Children? Yes. Children? Yes. They're sort of small adults that we love and adore, until they grow up and leave us. No, me neither. I hated being one, and I've never met one who can hold down a decent conversation. Oh, indeed. I've never met a parent that can, either. I've always hated what happens to my friends when they become parents. Jeremy, for one. Oh, God, yes. Jeremy. They invited me round for dinner the other night. I was back home by 8.30. Is it me. or is their son the spitting image of that, er. little chap from "Fantasy Island"? [IN FRENCH ACCENT] The plane, boss! [LAUGHS] Yes. That's him. You're so right. I knew he reminded me of someone. I was always veering towards Danny De Vito, though. Yes, I can see that. Could you love Danny De Vito? I'd like to have a child. Me too. They're strange, aren't they? Well, Jeremy's is. No. Blind dates. Oh. Yeah. This is my first. Really? Mm. How old are you? How old? Sorry, that is a terrible question. It's fine. I'm 43. I'm 41. Well, you have. You have time. I think we both know that's something I don't have. You have some time. Some. Shall we. walk, or? Walk? We don't have to. No, no. A walk would be. [MAN'S VOICE IN DISTANCE] A walk. would be great, yes. You know what? I ought to get back to the shop soon. Really? Oh. What about the walk? Very nice meeting you. Oh. Er, you too. Are you okay? Okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Time just seemed to run away with me. With us. Hm. Bloke with sunglasses and blazer, and she's off. Anyone that comes along, really. Anyone but me. Well, I'll tell you something. The view may be slightly disappointing, but it's been nice to spend some time up here with the kites. Hasn't it? You know, I think Tommy was right all along. No point in wishing your life away with your head in the clouds. And I think the walk has done us both good. So, how about a dance? I don't think you're the person I thought you were. Oh? No, it's a good thing. You've surprised me. Well, I don't know what to think about that. No, really, it's fine. It's just that. Look, I'm no dancer, never have been. Oh, me neither. Maybe we could just have a cup of tea. Now? Well, I could break the habit of a lifetime, come here on a Wednesday? You know, take a chance. Eddie? Yes. You know, I think I might change my routine as well. I think I might visit Tommy's grave on Wednesday. We had a good time. I never realised that. Well, I've always felt that Thursdays have a better feel about them anyway. You know, back of the week broken and all that. I mean, I'd very much like to. You know, there are other hills to climb. Heath's a huge place. Endless. possibilities. So, it's just you and me. I know, I know. [HE SIGHS] I know. Hey. I love you too. You cheeky bugger. Come here. Subtitles: SDI Media Group EN-SDH <i>My name is H I McDunnough.</i> <i>Call me Hi.</i> <i>The first time I met Ed was in the county lockup in Tempe, Arizona.</i> - Don't forget his profile, Ed! - Turn to the right! <i>A day I'll never forget.</i> Turn to the right! What kind of name is that for a pretty thing like you? Short for Edwina. Turn to the right! You're a flower, you are. Just a little desert flower. Let me know how those come out. <i>Now, prison life is very structured. more than most people care for.</i> <i>But a spirit of comradery exists between the men</i> <i>like you find only in combat, maybe,</i> <i>or on a pro ball club in the heat of the pennant drive.</i> <i>In an effort to better ourselves, we had to meet with a counsellor,</i> <i>who tried to help us figure out why we were the way we were.</i> And all Pancho wanted was a hot roll and butter. So. why do you use the word "trapped"? - Huh? - Why do you say you feel "trapped" in a man's body? Well, sometimes I get the menstrual cramps real hard. - Have you learned anything, Hi? - Yes, sir. You bet. - You wouldn't lie to us, would you, Hi? - No, ma'am, hope to say. OK, then. <i>I tried to stand up and fly straight,</i> <i>but it wasn't easy with that son of a bitch Reagan in the White House.</i> <i>I don't know. They say he's a decent man.</i> <i>So. maybe his advisors are confused.</i> Turn to the right. What's the matter, Ed? <i>- My fiance left me. - She said her fianc√© had run off</i> <i>with a student cosmetologist who knew how to ply her feminine wiles.</i> - The son of a bitch. - Don't forget his phone call, Ed! Tell him I think he's a damn fool, Ed. You tell him I said so, H I McDunnough. And if he wants to discuss it, he knows where to find me. The Maricopa County maximum security correctional facility for men, State Farm Road, No.31, Tempe, Arizona. I'll be waitin'! I'll be waitin'. <i>I can't say I was happy to be back inside,</i> <i>but the flood of familiar sights, sounds and faces almost made it feel like a homecomin'.</i> Most men your age are getting married and raising up a family. - Well, factually. - They wouldn't accept prison as a substitute. Would any of you men care to comment? Well, sometimes your career's gotta come before family. Work's what's kept us happy. <i>I tried to sort through what Doc Schwartz had said,</i> <i>but prison ain't the easiest place to think.</i> And when there was no meat, we ate fowl. And when there was no fowl, we ate crawdad. And when there was no crawdad to be found, we ate san'. - You ate what? - We ate san'. - You ate sand? - That's right. Well, Hi, you done served your 20 months. And seein' as how you never use live ammo, we got no choice but to return you to society. - These doors are gonna swing wide. - I didn't wanna hurt anyone, sir. - Hi, we respect that. - But you're just hurting yourself - with this rambunctious behaviour. - I know that, sir. OK, then. <i>I don't know how you come down on the incarceration question,</i> <i>whether it's for rehabilitation or revenge,</i> <i>but I was beginning to think revenge is the only argument makes any sense.</i> Show the tattoo! - Turn to the right! - Don't forget his fingers, Ed. Hear about the paddy wagon collided with the cement mixer, Ed? Twelve hardened criminals escaped. I heard that one. - Got a new beau? - No, Hi, I sure don't. Don't worry, I paid for it. <i>They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder.</i> <i>And, for once, they may be right.</i> You missed a spot. <i>More and more my thoughts turned to Ed</i> <i>and I finally felt the pain of imprisonment.</i> Mama would throw the live crawdad in a pan of boilin' water. Well, one day I decided to make my own crawdad. And I threw it in a pot, without the water, you see? And it was just like makin' popcorn, you see? <i>Yeah, the joint's a lonely place after lockup and lights out,</i> <i>when the last of the cons has been swept away by the sandman.</i> <i>But I couldn't help thinkin' that a brighter future lay ahead.</i> <i>A future that was only eight to fourteen months away.</i> They got a name for people like you, Hi. - That name is called "recidivism". - Repeat offender! - Not a pretty name, is it, Hi? - No, sir. That's one bonehead name. - But that ain't me any more. - Are you just tellin' us what we wanna hear? - No, sir, no way. - Cos we just wanna hear the truth. Well, then I guess I am tellin' you what you wanna hear. - Boy, didn't we just tell you not to do that? - Yes, sir. OK, then. Turn to the right! I'm walkin' in here on my knees, Ed, a free man, proposin'. Howdy, Curt. <i>- And so it was. - Don't forget the bouquet, Ed!</i> - I do. - You bet I do. OK, then. <i>Ed's pa staked us to a starter home in suburban Tempe</i> <i>and I got a job drillin'holes in sheet metal.</i> So we were doin' paramedical work with the state highway system. Not actually practisin', you understand. Me and Bill's patrollin' down Nine Mile. - Bill Roberts? - No, not that mother-scratcher. Bill Parker. Anyway, we're approachin' the wreck and there's this spherical object restin' in the highway. And it's not a piece o' the car. <i>Most ways, the job was a lot like prison,</i> <i>except Ed was waitin'at the end of every day and a pay cheque at the end of every week.</i> Government do take a bite, don't she? <i>These were the happy days, the salad days, as they say,</i> <i>and Ed felt that havin'a critter was the next logical step.</i> <i>It was all she thought about.</i> <i>Her point was that there was too much love and beauty for just the two of us.</i> <i>Every day we kept a child out of the world was a day he might later regret havin'missed.</i> That was beautiful. <i>So we worked at it on the days we calculated most likely to be fruitful.</i> <i>And we worked at it most other days, just to be sure.</i> <i>Ed rejoiced that my lawless years were behind me and that our child-rearing years lay ahead.</i> <i>And then the roof caved in.</i> Hi. I'm barren! <i>At first I didn't believe it.</i> <i>That this woman, who looked as fertile as the Tennessee valley, could not bear children.</i> <i>But the doctor explained that her insides were a rocky place</i> <i>where my seed could find no purchase.</i> <i>Ed was inconsolable.</i> <i>We tried an adoption agency.</i> It's true that Hi has had a chequered past. But Ed here is an officer of the law twice decorated, so we figure it kinda evens out. <i>But biology and the prejudices of others conspired to keep us childless.</i> <i>Our love for each other was stronger than ever.</i> <i>But I preminisced. no return of the salad days.</i> <i>The pizzazz had gone out of our lives.</i> <i>Ed lost all interest in both criminal justice and housekeepin'.</i> <i>Soon after, she tendered her badge.</i> <i>Even my job seemed as dry and bitter as a hot prairie wind.</i> So here's Bill, walkin' down Nine Mile. That's Bill Parker, you understand. He's got his sandwich in one hand and a fuckin' head in the other! <i>I even caught myself drivin' by convenience stores</i> <i>that weren't on the way home.</i> <i>Then one day, the biggest news hit the state since they built the Hoover Dam.</i> <i>The Arizona quints was born.</i> <i>By "Arizona quints"I mean they was born to a woman named Florence Arizona.</i> <i>As you probably guessed, Florence Arizona is the wife of Nathan Arizona.</i> <i>And Nathan Arizona. Well, hell,</i> <i>you know who he is.</i> <i>So come on down to Unpainted Arizona</i> <i>to get the finest selection in fixtures and appointments</i> <i>for your bathroom, bedroom, boudoir.</i> <i>And if you can find lower prices anywhere, my name ain't Nathan Arizona!</i> <i>Owner of the largest chain of unpainted furniture</i> <i>and bathroom fixture outlets throughout the Southwest.</i> <i>Yep, Florence had been takin'fertility pills and she and Nathan had hit the jackpot.</i> <i>Now, y'all without sin can cast the first stone.</i> <i>We thought it was unfair some should have so many</i> <i>while others should have so few.</i> <i>With the benefit of hindsight, maybe it wasn't such a hot idea.</i> <i>But, at the time, Ed's little plan seemed like the solution to all our problems</i> <i>and the answer to all our prayers.</i> 800 leaf tables and no chairs? You can't sell leaf tables and no chairs. Chairs, you got a dinette set. No chairs, you got dick! I ask my wife, she got more sense. Miles, alls I know is I'm away from the office for a few days to play with my kids and everything goes straight to heck! I won't stand for it! If a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump its ass a- hoppin'. I am sick of your excuses, Miles! It is now precisely. 8.45 in the PM. I'm gonna be down that store in exactly 12 hours to kick me some butt! Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona! Sounds like Larry. No, no, no, no, no. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet. OK, all right. Quiet, quiet, quiet. That's it. Good. Here's a rattle. A rattle. OK? Good. No, no. Quiet, quiet. Come here. Please come here. Come here. Why don't you go up and check on 'em? They sound restless. - What's the matter? - I'm sorry, honey. Itjust didn't work out. - What do you mean it didn't work out? - Well, they. They started cryin' and they were all over me. It was kinda horrifyin', honey. Let me in. - Of course they cried. Babies cry. - Well, I know that. - Come on, honey. We'd better leave. - Go back and get me a toddler. I need a baby, Hi. They got more than they can handle. - Honey, I. - Don't you come back here without a baby! Christian Dior, my butt! - They pay money for that? - Yes, dear. - How're the kids? - Fine, dear. - Which one you get? - I don't know. Nathan Junior, I think. - Gimme here. - Here's the instructions. He's beautiful. Yeah, he's awful damn good. I think I got the best one. I bet they were all beautiful. All babies are beautiful. - This one's awful damn good. - Don't you cuss around him. - He's fine, he is. I think it's Nathan Junior. - We are doin' the right thing, aren't we, Hi? - They had more than they could handle. - Well, honey, we've been over this. There's what's right and there's what's right. - Never the twain shall meet. - But don't you think his mama'll be upset? Well, of course she'll be upset, sugar, but she'll get over it. She's got four little babies almost as good as this one. It's like robbin' convenience stores. I love him so much! - I know you do, honey. - I love him so much! I know you do. OK. Bring him in! This is it, young Nathan Junior! You can feast your eyes about, old boy! - Don't be so loud around him. - Damn, I'm sorry. - Don't cuss around him. - He don't know a cuss word from Shinola. - Well, you see that he don't. - I wanna hold him too. - Well, mind his little fontanelle. - He's all right, he is. Come on over here, young Nathan Junior. I'm gonna show you around. Lookee here, young sportsman. That there's the kitchen area, where Ma and Pa chow down. This here's the TV. Two hours a day maximum, either educational or football, so as you don't ruin your appreciation of the finer things. And this here's the divan, for socialisin' and relaxin' with the family unit. Yes, sir. Many's the day we sat there and we said "Wouldn't it be nice to have a youngster to share our thoughts and feelings?" - He's tired, Hi. - Well, I'll just sit you right there, boy. Just put those dogs up and take a load off. What, are you kiddin'? We got us a family here! He's a scandal, honey. He's a little outlaw. No, he's a good boy. He ain't too good. You can tell by that twinkle in his eye. - Don't you think we oughta put him to bed? - Hang on, honey. - Let's just preserve the moment in pictures. - Just one, OK? I gotta tell ya. I'm a little scared, Hi. - How come is that, honey? - Well. We got a baby, Hi. It's an awful big responsibility. Honey, could you slide over a tad and raise the nipper up? I mean, we never done this before and I'm kinda nervous. You're doin' real good, sugar. - I love you, Hi. - We're set to pop here, honey. - Now, you're gonna help, aren't you? - How's that, honey? Contribute to the management of the child. - Quiet evenings together. - You can count on it. Everything decent and normal from here on out. We're set to pop here, honey. - OK. - What is she? Station wagon. Looks nice. Open up! It's the police! - Hi, what's goin' on? - You stay in here. - Open up! - They ain't gonna split up the family. - Open up in there! - I'd like to see 'em try. Open up! Maybe we'll let you plea bargain! - Hi there, you old woodpecker! - Boys! Gale, don't make me sick! Asshole! Honey, I'd like you to meet Gale and Evelle Snopes. As fine a pair as ever broke and entered! Boys. this here's my wife. - Ma'am. - Ms McDunnough. - Kinda late for visitors, isn't it, Hi? - Well, yeah, honey. But these boys just got outta the joint, so we gotta show a little hospitality. Well, now, H I. Looks like you've been up to the devil's business. - Hey, is that a him or a her? - It's a little boy. - Got a name, does he? - So far we just been usin' Junior. - We call him Junior. - You mean JR, just like the TV show? - That's good! - "Welcome home, son." Where's he been? - Phoenix. - Tulsa. - He was visitin' his grandparents. - They're separated. - That'd be your folks, ma'am. - No, I'm afraid not. Well, you said your folks was dead, H I. Well, we thought Junior should see their final restin' place. Why don't you boys have a seat? Hi, it's two in the mornin'. What's that smell? We don't always smell this way, Ms McDunnough. I was explainin' to your better half that, when we were tunnellin' out, we happened to hit the main sewer line. Dumb luck, that. - And we followed that to. - You busted outtajail? No, ma'am. We released ourselves on our own recognisance. What Evelle is tryin' to say is we felt the institution no longer had anything to offer us. - My Lord, he's cute! - He's a little outlaw. You can see that, Hi. Now, listen, you folks can't stay here. - Ma'am? - You just can't stay. I appreciate you bein' friends of Hi an' all, but this is a decent family now. I mean, we got a toddler here. Say, who wears the pants round here, H I? - Honey, these boys just got outta the joint. - Don't "honey" me! Now you boys can sit awhile and catch up, but then you be on your way. Got you on an awful short leash, don't she, H I? They still here? Yeah. They're just gonna stay a day or two, honey. It's rainin' out, they got nowheres to go. They're fugitives, Hi. How're we gonna start a new life with them around? Well, now, honey, you gotta have a little charity. You know, in Arab lands, they'd set out a plate. Promise just a day or two. Tonight and tomorrow, tops. <i>That night I had a dream.</i> <i>I drifted off, thinkin'about happiness, birth and new life.</i> <i>But now I was haunted by a vision of.</i> <i>He was horrible.</i> <i>The lone biker of the Apocalypse.</i> <i>A man with all the powers of Hell at his command.</i> <i>He could turn the day into night</i> <i>and lay to waste everything in his path.</i> <i>He was especially hard on the little things, the helpless and the gentle creatures.</i> <i>He left a scorched earth in his wake,</i> <i>befoulin' even the sweet desert breeze that whipped across his brow.</i> <i>I didn't know where he came from or why.</i> <i>I didn't know if he was dream or vision.</i> <i>But I feared that I myself had unleashed him.</i> <i>For he was the fury that would be,</i> <i>as soon as Florence Arizona found her little Nathan gone.</i> <i>' Father sits at his cabin door</i> <i>' Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes</i> <i>' For his only son soon shall walk</i> <i>' To yonder scaffold rise</i> - You all right? - Well, he's all right. He was just havin' a nightmare. <i>' My race is run beneath the sun</i> <i>' The scaffold now waits for me</i> <i>' For I did murder that dear little girl</i> <i>' Whose name was Rose Connelly</i> Sometimes it's a hard world for little things. Now, the missis and the rest of the kids have left town to. I ain't sayin' where. They'll be back here when we're a nuclear family again. - Mr Arizona, which tot was abducted? - Nathan Junior, I think. - Anything to say to the kidnappers? - Yeah. Watch your butts! It's rumoured your son was abducted by UFOs. - Would you care to comment? - Don't print that, son. If his mama reads that, she's just gonna lose all hope. Sir, we really need to ask you some more questions. But remember it's still business as usual at Unpainted Arizona. If you can find lower prices anywhere, my name still ain't Nathan Arizona! Mr Byrum here can take your exemplars while you talk. Just relax your hand. I'll do the work. - What is this? I didn't steal the damn kid! - Sir, these men are with the FBI. Are you crazy? Alls I know is, I wake up and my wife's screamin'. We just need to distinguish your prints from the perpetrator, if they left any. - Of course. I know that. - Sir, were you born Nathan Huffhines? - Yeah, I changed my name. What of it? - Can you tell us why? Yeah. Would you buy furniture at "Unpainted Huffhines"? - I'll get to the point. - Was the child wearing anything? - Nobody sleeps naked in this house! - I'll ask the questions! To put an APB out, I need a description. We're better trained to intervene in a crisis situation. What was he wearing? A dinnerjacket. What do you think? His damn jammies! - He was wearing his jammies. Happy? - Any disgruntled employees? Hell, they're all disgruntled. I ain't runnin' a daisy farm. - I say do it my way or watch your butt! - So it might have been an employee? Without my say-so, they wouldn't piss with their pants on fire. - What did the pyjamas look like? - I don't know. They were jammies! They had Yodas and shit on 'em. Get your damn feet off my coffee table! - Ron, you are upsetting the victim! - Are you boys gonna chase your leads or sit drinkin' coffee in the one house in the state where I know my boy ain't at? Well, we don't have any leads as yet, aside from the coat. Gimme that! That's a $500 camel's-hair coat. Sir, you might want to wash your hands at this point. Goddammit! No leads! Everyone leaves microbes and whatnot. Hell, that's your forte, ain't it? Trackin' down microbes left by criminals and commies and shit. That's your whole raison d'√™tre, ain't it? No leads! I want Nathan Junior back! Or whichever the hell one of 'em they took! He's out there somewhere. Somethin' leads to him! Anyone can find him knows the difference between a lead and a hole in the ground! Awful good cereal flakes, Ms McDunnough. Why ain't you breast-feedin'? You appear to be capable. - Mind your own business. - Ma'am, you don't breast-feed him, he hates you later. That's why we wound up in prison. Anyway, that's what Doc Schwartz tells us. Boys. Mornin', Hi. Hi. Oh, yeah. Say, boys. You wouldn't mind makin' yourselves scarce for a coupla hours this afternoon, would ya? We're havin' some decent friends over. What Ed means to say is. seein' as you two boys are wanted, it wouldn't exactly do to have folks seein' you here. It's for your own protection. - Sure, H I. - Anything you say, Hi. Matter of fact, honey, I think I'll skip this little get-together myself. Glen won't mind. I'll just duck out with the boys, knock back a coupla co-colas. - Sure, H I. - We'd love to have you, Hi. Maybe that ain't such a swell idea, either. So many social engagements, so little time. Where's that baby? Where is he at? - Go find him, honey! - Cut it out, Glen! He's asleep right now. Shit! I hope we didn't wake it! Can I just sneak a peek-a-loo? Come on, kids! Get away from Mr McDunnough's car! What's his name? Hi. Hi Junior, till we think of a better one. Why don't ya call him Jason? I love biblical names. If I had another little boy, I'd name him Jason, Caleb or Tab. He's an angel! He's an angel straight from heaven! Now honey, I had all my kids the hard way. Tell me how you got this little angel. Did he fly straight down from heaven? - Well. - You're gonna send him to Arizona State. Gimme a Twinkie! - You need a beer, Glen? - Does the Pope wear a funny hat? Yeah, Glen, I guess it is kinda funny. Say, that reminds me. How many Polacks does it take to screw up a light bulb? I don't know, Glen. One? No, it takes three. I told it wrong. I'll start again. How come it takes three Polacks to screw up a light bulb? - I don't know, Glen. - Cos they're so darn stupid! Shit, man! Listen up! What's the matter? Don't ya get it? - No, Glen, I sure don't. - Well, shit, man. I guess that's why they call it a way-homer. - Why's that? - Cos you only get it on the way home. I'm already home, Glen. You wet yourself! You wet yourself! Mr McDunnough wet himself, Daddy! Say, that reminds me. How'd you get that kid so fast? Me and Dot went to adopt - somethin' wrong with my semen. They said we had to wait five years for a healthy white baby. I said "Healthy white baby, five years? OK, what else you got?" They said they got two Koreans and a Negro born with his heart on the outside. - It's a crazy world. - Someone oughta sell tickets. Sure. I'd buy one. That Buford's a sly one. He already knows his ABCs. Watch this. Hit the deck, boy! But like I'm sayin', how'd you get the kid? Well, this whole thing is just who knows who. Then over here you have favouritism. Ed has a friend at one of the agencies. Maybe she can help me and Dot. There's somethin' wrong with my semen. What you gonna name it? Ed. Ed Junior. - But I thought you said it was a boy. - Well, as in Edward. We just like that name. It's a good one. I don't really need another kid, but Dot says these are gettin' too big to cuddle. Say, that reminds me. Mind you don't cut yourself, Mordecai. Then there's diphtheria-tetanus, what they call dip-tet. They need dip-tet boosters yearly, or they develop lockjaw and night vision. Then there's the smallpox vaccine, chicken pox and measles. If your kid's like ours, you'll have to get all those shots before he'll take 'em. - Who's your paediatrician? - We ain't exactly fixed on one yet, have we? - No, I guess we don't have one yet. - Jesus! Well, you gotta have one this instant! - What if the baby gets sick, honey? - Even if he don't, he's gotta have his dip-tet. He's gotta have his dip-tet, honey. - You started his bank accounts yet? - Have we done that? We gotta do that. - What's that for, Dot? - His orthodonture and his university. Use iodine, you might save on orthodonture. Won't knock a thing off the university. Riley! You take that diaper off your head! You put it back onto your sister! Anyway, you probably got the life insurance all squared away. Have we done that yet, honey? Gotta do that, Hi. - Ed's got her hands full with this angel. - Yes, ma'am. What would Ed and little angel do if a truck splattered your brains over the interstate? Yeah, honey. What if you get run over? Or you got carried off by a twister? Say, that reminds me. You hear about the person of Polish persuasion? He walks into a bar with this big pile of shit in his hand and says "Look what I almost stepped in!" - Yeah, that's funny all right. - Damn right! Shit, man, what's the matter? I don't know. Maybe it's. the wife, kids, family life. I mean. Are you satisfied, Glen? Don't you ever feel. suffocated? Like there's somethin' big pressin' down? Yeah, I do know that feelin'. And I told Dot to lose some weight, but she don't wanna listen. No, man, I know what you mean. You got all these responsibilities now. You're married, you got a kid, it looks like your whole life is set down. - Where's the excitement? - Yeah, Glen, I guess that's it. OK, that's a disease, but you got a cure. Yeah? Dr Glen is here to tell you that you can heal thyself. - What do I gotta do? - Well, you just gotta broaden your mind. Say if I was to ask you "What do you think about Dot?" Well, she's a fine woman you got there. OK, now you might not know it to look at her, but she's a hellcat. - That right? - T-l-G-E-R. - Well, what's that gotta do with. - Now, don't rush me. The thing about Dot is. She told me this. She thinks. She thinks you're cute. Yeah? I'm crappin' you negative. And I could say the same thing about Ed. - What are you talkin' about, Glen? - What am I talkin' about? I'm talkin' about sex. What are you talkin' about? <i>I'm talkin' about I'amour. I'm talkin' that me and Dot are swingers.</i> As in, to swing. I'm talkin' about wife-swappin'. I'm talkin' about what they call now "open marriage". Keep your goddamn hands off my wife. I was only tryin' to help! You're crazy! - You're crazy, man! - Keep your goddamn hands off my wife! You're crazy! I pity you! We finally go out with some decent people and you break his nose. That ain't funny, Hi. - His kids seemed to think it was funny. - Well, they're just kids. You're a grown man with responsibilities. Whatever possessed ya? - He was provokin' me. - How'd he do that? - Never mind. - But, Hi, he's your foreman. He's just gonna fire you now. - I expect he will. - Where does that leave the three of us? Where does that leave our entire family unit? - With a man for a husband. - That ain't no answer. - Honey, that's the only answer. - That ain't no answer. With a man for a husband. Nathan needs some Huggies. I'll be out directly. Mind you stay strapped in. Wake up, son. I'll be takin' these Huggies and whatever cash you got. "No, no, not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin" said the little pig. Look at that. Look at him. "Then I'll." "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in." That son of a bitch. That son of a bitch! - You son of a bitch! - Better hurry it up. I'm in Dutch with the wife. You son of a bitch! Come on now! Honey? That son of a bitch. Hold on, Nathan. We're gonna go pick up Daddy. Son, you got a panty on your head. Just drive fast, OK? Wait. There's the wife. Honey! Mind the baby now! Hang on, Nathan. We're gonna take a short cut. Can I stop now? Thank you. <i>That's private property, son.</i> <i>Come out to the street and reveal yourself to Officer Steensma and Officer Scott.</i> Son of a bitch! Thank you, honey, but you really didn't have to do this. Son of a bitch! What if me and the baby had been picked up? - Turn left here. - He'd be accessory to armed robbery. - It ain't armed robbery if the gun ain't loaded. - What kind of home life is it for a toddler? - You supposed to be an example. - For what? I never postured myself as a three-piece suit type. Turn right, honey. - We got a child now! Everything's changed! - Nathan Junior accepts me for what I am. And I think you better had too. You know, honey: I'm OK, you're OK. - That there's what it is. - I know, but, honey. See, I come from a long line of frontiersmen. Here it is, dear. Turn here. Frontiersmen and outdoor types. I'm not gonna live this way, Hi. It just ain't family life. <i>Well, it ain't Ozzie and Harriet.</i> You two are leavin'. I got nothin' against you, but you're wanted by the authorities. And you're a bad influence in this household in my opinion. Well, ma'am. We sure didn't mean to influence anybody. And if we did, ma'am, we apologise. I'm goin' tomorrow to see about shots for the baby. When I come back, you better be gone. What's he need, his dip-tet? I'm awful sorry, boys, but when Ed gets mad, you know, she gets an idea. There ain't a thing to apologise for, H I. Seems pretty clear what the situation is here. Yeah. I guess the missis wants us to clear out. Now, H I, if you'll pardon me for sayin' so, - I get the feelin' that this ain't workin' out. - Edwina's generally a real sweetheart. And, as per usual, I wouldn't be surprised if the source of the marital friction weren't financial. As a matter of fact, I did lose my job today. Hi, you're young and you got your health. What you want with ajob? But I'd rather light a candle than curse your darkness. Now, as you know, Evelle here and I never go anywhere without there's a purpose. And here we are in your little domicile. - We come to invite you in on a little score. - A bank, H I. Come on now! I know you're partial to convenience stores, but dammit, H I, the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocery. It's like Doc Schwartz says, you gotta have a little bit of ambition. We just watchin' on the news. Somebody snatched up one of them Arizona babies. - For chrissakes. - That there's somebody who's thinkin' big. And here you are, sittin' on your butt, playin' house with a - don't get me wrong, H I - with a fine woman, but a woman who needs one of them button-down types. - I don't particularly think that's any of your. - Hold on, H I. Now lookee there. That's a picture of El Dorado. The locals call it the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of La Grange. Looks like a hayseed bank. Tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank. But the last Friday of every financial quarter, it has more cash than flies at a barbecue. - And guess what day it is tomorrow. - When all the hayseeds come in and cash their farm subsidies cheques. - A1 information, Hi. - Got it in the joint from a guy named Lawrence Spivey, one of Dick Nixon's undersecretary of agricultures. In for soliciting sex from a state trooper. Ordinarily we don't associate with that type of person, but. he was tryin' to make a few Brownie points. Boys, I can't. Hi, we need someone handy with a scatter-gun, coverin' them hayseeds, while we go in there and get that cash. You understand, H I? If this works out, it's just the beginning of a spree to cover the entire Southwest. And we keep goin' until we can retire. or we get caught. Either way, we're fixed for life. Boys, it's a kind offer, but. you're suggesting I just up and leave Ed. And that'd be pretty damn cowardly, wouldn't it? Would it? Think about it, H I. Seems to me sittin' here you ain't doin' her any good. And you ain't bein' true to your own nature. <i>My dearest Edwina,</i> <i>tonight, as you and Nathan slumber, my heart is filled with anguish.</i> <i>I hope that you will both understand, and forgive me for what I have decided I must do.</i> <i>By the time you read this, I will be gone.</i> <i>I will never be the man that you want me to be.</i> <i>The husband and father that you and Nathan deserve.</i> <i>Maybe it's my upbringing.</i> <i>Maybe it's just that my genes got screwed up.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>But the events of the last day have showed amply</i> <i>that I don't have the strength of character to raise up a family</i> <i>in the manner befitting a responsible adult.</i> <i>I say all this to my shame.</i> <i>I will love you always, truly and deeply.</i> <i>But I fear that, if I stay, I would only bring bad trouble</i> <i>on the heads of you and Nathan Junior.</i> <i>I feel the thunder gathering even now.</i> <i>If I leave, hopefully,</i> <i>it will leave with me.</i> <i>I cannot tarry.</i> <i>Better I should go, send you money and let you curse my name.</i> <i>Your loving -</i> <i>Herbert.</i> Mr Arizona, he just barged in. Should I call Duane? Hell, no. Why wake the security guard? I'll take care of this. - You got flies. - I doubt it. This place is climate-controlled. All the windows are sealed. - Who the hell are you? - Smalls. Leonard Smalls. My friends call me Lenny. But I got no friends. Stop. You're gonna make me bust out cryin'. Listen, Leonard. you want some furniture or a shit-box, they're on the sales floor. I'm not a customer. I'm a manhunter. Now, of course, I do hunt babies on occasion. I hear you got one you can't put your hand to. - What do you know about it? - That's my business. I'm a tracker, and some say part hound dog. But when some dink busts outta the joint, skips bail, I'm the one they call. Mister. I got the cops, state troopers, Federal BI, already lookin' for my boy. - Now if you got information. - The cops won't find your boy. A cop couldn't find his butt if he had a bell on it. You wanna find an outlaw, you call an outlaw. You wanna find a Dunkin' Donuts, call a cop. Smalls, first off, get your damn feet off my furniture. Second off, it's widely known I posted a 25-grand reward for my boy. Now if you can find him, claim it. Short of that, what have we got to talk about? Price. Fair price. That's not what you say it is. That's what the market will bear. Simple economics. Now there are people - and, mind you, I know 'em - that'll pay a lot more than $25,000 for a healthy baby. - What are you after? - I'll give you an idea. As a pup, I myself fetched $30,000 on the black market. That was 1954 dollars. Now, for 50 grand, I'll track him and I'll find him. And the people that took him. I'll kick their butts. No extra charge. - And if I don't pay? - I'll get the boy regardless. And if you don't pay, the market will. You wanna know what I think? I think you're an evil man. I think this is nothin' but a goddamn screw job. I think it's a shakedown. I think you're the one that took Nathan Junior and I think you're the one that's gonna get his butt kicked. I think I'm on the phone to the cops right now. Up and at 'em, H I! Today's the first day of the rest of your life. Already you're messin' it up. Missis gonna be back from town soon. - Where's the baby? - In the bedroom in his crib. He's sawin' toothpicks. He'll be fine. - You expectin' anyone? - No. You two stay outta sight. - Mornin', Glen. - I ain't comin' in, if you don't mind. I'll just keep my distance. - I didn't invite ya in, Glen. - Don't even bother. - First off, you're fired, and that's official. - I kinda figured that, Glen. Well, that ain't the reason I come out here. No, sir! No. You're in a whole shitload of trouble, my friend. - Why don't yajust calm down? - Why don't you just make me? You know that little baby you got in there? Remember? I know what his real name is! - You wanna keep your voice down, Glen? - I'll pitch my voice wherever I please! His name ain't Hi Junior, it ain't Ed Junior, but it's Junior, all right. It's Nathan Junior! You stay away from me, McDunnough! Yeah. You're an awful big man when you got somethin' around to clobber a guy with! - I ain't a big man. - That's right. And now you're at my mercy. I'm your worst nightmare. I was gonna turn you in for the reward, but Dot wants somethin' to cuddle. I guess we'll be callin' the baby Glen Junior from now on! I'll give you a day to break the news to Ed! Dot'll be around tomorrow to pick him up. Either that, or you go to jail. Say, that reminds me. You'll be gettin' a doctor bill in the mail in a few days. I recommend you pay it! - What's goin' on here? - It's just business. This'll go hard or easy, H I. Sweet Lord! <i>' She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes</i> <i>' Oh, when she comes</i> <i>' She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes</i> Good! I know you're worried, but we're gonna get him back. There ain't no question about that. We will. That's all there is to it. And another thing. I'm gonna be a better person from here on out. That's the way it's gonna be. It's official. You were right. A blind man could tell ya that. They won't hurt him. They're in it for the score. But I'm a changed man. You were right, I was wrong. We got a family here. I'm gonna start actin' responsibly. So let's go, honey. Let's go get Nathan Junior! <i>' All have chicken and dumplings</i> <i>' Yeah, we'll all have chicken and dumplings when she comes</i> I lurve to drive. - Boy, you sure said somethin' there, partner. - Yes, sir. I figure between the ransom and this bank, you and I'll be sittin' in the fabled catbird seat. Gale. Junior just had an accident. - What's that, partner? - He had hisself a little ol' accident. - What do you mean? He looks OK. - No, you see, movin' though we are, he just went and had hisself a little old rest dump. Well, that's natural. - Gale? - What now, little brother? He smiled at me. The kid smiled at me. Come here, boy. Nice. - Do you know how to put these things on? - Around the butt and up over the groin area. Shoot, I know where they go, old-timer. I just wanna know whether I need pins or fasteners. Well, no. They got tapettes already on there. It's self-contained and fairly explanatory. Balloons. Hey, these blow up into funny shapes at all? Well, no, unless round is funny. I'll take these too. All right, now. Now you just lie down back there, old-timer. Yes, sir. All right, I want you to count up to. 825 - and then on back down to zero. - OK, then. I'm gonna come back in five and check to see you ain't cheatin'. - Hurry up! - He's a cheerful little critter - once he warms up to you. - I don't know how high this one can count. Six Mississippi, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi. Got some baby grub, baby wipes, got them diapers, them disposable kind. I got me a packet of balloons. - They blow up into funny shapes at all? - No, just circular. Say. where's Junior? - What do you mean? Didn't you put him in? - No, I thought. Where'd we leave him? No! 801 Mississippi, 800 Mississippi. Junior! 791. Bullshit! 790 Mississippi. - 787 Mississippi. - Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Promise we ain't ever gonna leave him, Gale. - Promise we ain't never gonna give him up. - We ain't gonna give him up again, Evelle. He's our little Gale Junior now. Ed. I realise I can't be much of a comfort to you now. But let me just say this: - You'll feel a whole lot better. - I don't wanna feel better. - Honey. - I don't care about myself any more. I don't care about us any more. - I just want Nathan Junior back safe. - I know that. If we don't get him back safe, I don't wanna go on livin'. And even if we do get him back safe, I don't wanna go on livin' with you. I guess I still love you, Hi. I. I know I do. I ain't even blamin' you. The whole thing was crazy and the whole thing was my idea. - Well, factually, I myself bear a very large. - Let me finish. Ever since those jailbirds took little Nathan, I been thinkin' and I ain't too proud of myself. Even if Mrs Arizona had more than she could handle, I was a police officer, sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States. - Now, honey, you resigned before we ever. - That ain't the point, Hi. We don't deserve Nathan Junior any more than those jailbirds do. - If I'm as selfish and irresponsible as you. - You're not that bad. If I'm as bad as you, what good are we to each other? You and me is just a fool's paradise. - There she is. - Yep. Well. let's do her. - What are we gonna do with Gale Junior? - He stays here. Are you crazy? Supposin' we go in there and get ourselves killed. It'd be hours before he was discovered. All right, you hayseeds, it's a stick-up! Everybody freeze! Everybody down on the ground! Well, which is it, young feller? You want I should freeze or get down on the ground? I mean to say, if I freeze, I can't rightly drop and, if I drop, I'm gonna be in motion. You see? - Shut up! - OK, then. - Everybody down on the ground! - You can forget that part about freezin'. - That is till they get down there. - Y'all hear that, don't ya? You wanna fill this up, partner? We gotta. Shit! Where did all the tellers go? We're down here, sir. They're over there on the ground like you commanded, Gale. I told you not to use my damn name. Can't you even try to keep from forgettin' that? Not even your code name? Oh, yeah, yeah. My code name. Y'all hear that? We're usin' code names. All right, everybody. We're about ready to begin the robbery proper. Hurry up, you dang hayseed! All right, now y'all know how this here works. That hayseed over there with the red hat, he's the monitor. OK, you betcha. I want you to stay flat for ten full minutes. We mightjust come back in five to check. That's for us to know and for y'all to find out. Anyone found bipedal in five wears his ass for a hat. That old-timer threw off my concentration. Otherwise it would have gone smoother. Shoot, Gale. We done good. This oughta split up real nice three ways. Goddammit, you never leave a man behind! - Where's the baby? - Where's the baby? Dammit, H I, ain't we got enough to contend with? I don't know, ma'am. I thought we left him up on the roof. I think we left him at the bank. Ms McDunnough, I'm worried sick about him! - Hold on, H I. - I'm worried sick about him! - Hi! - H I! - Hi! - Ms McDunnough! - Let us come with you! - Please! He's our baby too! - What is he? - Do you see him too? Gimme that baby! I want that baby! Gimme that baby, you warthog from hell! Just lay down on the floor, young missy. - Run along now, honey. - But Hi. Just run along now. I. I didn't. I'm sorry. What the hell's goin' on? Get away from there! - Let's go. - Wait a minute. I ain't through with you. What are you doin' creepin' around in the dark? - You in with Smalls? - Excuse me? Leonard Smalls. Big feller. Rides a Harley. Dresses like a rock star. No, sir. That's who we saved him from. - It's a long story. - Suppose you tell it. Well, sir, in a reward situation, they usually say "no questions asked". - Do they? - Yeah. Well. All right, boy. I guess you got a reward comin'. $25,000. Or, if you need home furnishings, I can give you a line of credit at any of my stores. In fact, that's the way I'd rather handle it, for tax reasons. We don't want no reward. We didn't bring him back for money. We could work it that way too. Could I just look at him a little bit more? Be my guest, little lady. But. Would you mind tellin' me exactly how you. You took him, didn't you? It wasn't that biker at all. I took him, sir. My wife had nothin' to do with it. - I crept in yon window and. - We both did it. We didn't wanna hurt him any. I just wanted to be a mama. It wasn't for money or nothin'. We just figured you had more than you could handle baby-wise. But I'm the one committed the actual crime, so if you need to call the authorities. Shut up. Nobody's gonna call the authorities if there's no harm done. - Thank you, sir. - Aw, bullshit. Just tell me why you did it. We. can't have one of our own. Well, look. If you can't have kids, you just gotta keep tryin' and hope medical science catches up with you, like Florence and me. It caught up with a vengeance. But, hell, even if it never does for you, you still got each other. Sir, those are kind words, but. I think the wife and I are splittin' up. Her point is that we're both kinda selfish and unrealistic, so we ain't too good for each other. Well, ma'am, I don't know much, but I do know human beings. You brought back my boy, so you must have your good points too. I sure hate to think of Florence leavin' me. I do. love her so. You can go out the way you came in. And before you go off and do another foolish thing, like bustin' up, I suggest you sleep on it. At least one night. <i>That night I had a dream.</i> <i>I dreamt I was as light as the ether,</i> <i>a floatin'spirit, visitin' things to come.</i> <i>The shades and shadows of the people in my life wrestled their way into my slumber.</i> <i>I dreamt that Gale and Evelle had decided to return to prison. Probably that's just as well.</i> <i>I don't mean to sound superior, and they're a swell coupla guys,</i> <i>but maybe they weren't ready yet to come out into the world.</i> <i>And then I dreamed on, into the future,</i> <i>to a Christmas morning in the Arizona home, where Nathan Junior was openin'a present</i> <i>from a kindly couple who preferred to remain unknown.</i> <i>I saw Glen a few years later,</i> <i>still havin'no luck gettin' the cops to listen to his wild tales about me and Ed.</i> <i>Maybe he threw in one Polack joke too many.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>But still I dreamed on,</i> <i>further into the future than I'd ever dreamed before.</i> <i>Watchin' Nathan Junior's progress from afar,</i> <i>takin' pride in his accomplishments, as if he were our own,</i> <i>wonderin' if he ever thought of us,</i> <i>and hopin' that maybe we'd broadened his horizons a little,</i> <i>even if he couldn't remember just how they got broadened.</i> <i>But still I hadn't dreamt nothin' about me and Ed,</i> <i>until the end.</i> <i>And this was cloudier,</i> <i>because it was years, years away.</i> <i>But I saw an old couple bein' visited by their children</i> <i>and all their grandchildren too.</i> <i>The old couple weren't screwed up, and neither were their kids or their grandkids.</i> Dad. <i>And I don't know.</i> <i>You tell me.</i> <i>This whole dream.</i> <i>Was it wishful thinkin'?</i> <i>Was I just fleein'reality, like I know I'm liable to do?</i> <i>But me and Ed, we can be good too.</i> <i>And it seemed real.</i> <i>It seemed like us.</i> <i>And it seemed like,</i> <i>well. our home.</i> <i>If not Arizona, then a land not too far away,</i> <i>where all parents are strong and wise and capable</i> <i>and all the children are happy and beloved.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>Maybe it was Utah.</i> Visiontext Subtitles: David Van-Cauter .The Minnesota Pee Wee Championship is up for grabs. Both teams playing like there's no tomorrow. Duluth, in the Hawks'zone, looking for a chance to win it. Only a few seconds remain. There's a pass out to the blue line. Intercepted by Gordon Bombay! Bombay! He's got a breakaway. Across the blue line all alone for a chance to win the game! He's pulled down from behind by Fox of Duluth. Fox definitely pulled him down from behind and this could be - Yes, the referee calls for a penalty shot. Gordon, it's up to you. I don't wanna see any goats around after the game. You got it? Now, you miss this shot. you're not just lettin' me down, you're lettin' your team down. Apressure situation he's in now. The 1973 Pee Wee State Championship now rests. on the little shoulders of number 9, Gordon Bombay. Gordon! Gordon! Let's go, son! All right! He hit the goalpost! What a heartbreaker! Little Gordon Bombay had the chance - All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted! Isn't that right? This man put his neck on the line for your greed. Objection. Your Honour? Will both counsellors approach the bench? What's he doing? I don't have anything to tell you. I just wanna make a point. So nod like I'm saying something important. - Mr. Bombay? - Gordon, what are you doing? - Get out there and be my lawyer. - Perfect. This drives him nuts and I love it. Nice tie, Frank. You wore that yesterday, didn't ya? Oh, Mr. Bombay, I'm so glad you could make it. Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross-examination! Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent. vis-a-vis individual action is well established. I'm citing Minneapolis V. Higgins. The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony. Now, if I'm not mistaken, that was. you. Wasn't it,Judge Weathers? I stand corrected, counsellor. Objection overruled. Oh,you really stooped to an all-time low on this, Bombay. I'm insulted, Frank. You have no idea how low I can stoop. I don't mind losing. I would just like to lose fair. Losing fair is still losing, Frank. Gotta go for the "W" every time. And what about justice? That man should be in jail. It was your job to put him there. Don't take it out on me! Next time do your job, Frankie boy. - 30 and 0! I remain undefeated. - What about the Frazier case? We don't count that one because I scored with the court reporter. - The one you said had the intelligent body? - That's the one. - No calls on the Duck phone? - Not yet. What's he waiting for? I saw him in the back of the courtroom. How about some kudos here, huh? Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight's North Stars game. Hockey? Forget it! Gordon, here's the research for the Pearlstein Project. - Can you get started? - Jane! Can't you see I'm reveling here? Today I'm 30 and 0! - 30 and one. - Type,Jeannie, don't speak. Mr. Bombay's office. Yes. It's Ducksworth. You're right. He wants to see you. Ha-ha-ha! Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth! It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth. Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth. Gordon, another fine job today. - Thank you, sir. - Just one thing. Score. Don't spike. I'm not sure I understand what you mean, sir. This is a business. It isn't a game. Next time a little restraint might be in order. ~Hey, man, get off my back I'm doin'the best I can,yeah ~ ~ You bust my neck Cut no slack ~ - ~Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh ~ - Pull your vehicle over to the right, now! - This is not good. - ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~ - Licence, please. - Could you turn down the stereo? - Sure. I guess it was a "widdle" noisy. A "widdle"? Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct. Breath, blood or urine? No, thanks, I'm full. Okay, out of the car. Now. The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment. And to think I almost stayed home this morning. I assume you're representing yourself? Twelve moving violations in three years? How do you still have a licence? Okay, let's talk business. What am I facing? Suspension of licence? Fines? What? Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges. But that's solely up to the prosecutor. The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case. - Hmm. - Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo? The defendant is released on his own recognizance. Mr. Ducksworth. What are you doing here? I own the place. How about you? Just goin' over a few cases. RICOH Statute stuff. Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence. against D.U.I. and reckless endangerment. Did you think I wouldn't find out, Gordon? There was no reason to concern you with it, sir. They have no case. Frank Huddy just wants my scalp. I found a loophole. I'm gonna plead not guilty - Gordon, stop it. There's not going to be a loophole. There's not going to be a trial. I am not going to have you drag. this firm's good name through the mud. I've talked toJudge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case. - Under what conditions? - Probation, suspension of your driver's licence. and 500 hours of community service. And a leave of absence from the firm. A leave of absence? He can't do that. - He can't stop me from working! - He's not. I am. That was my condition. Gordon, you need a break. - You're too wrapped up in your work. - But, sir, my work is my life. That's just my point. The community service will do you good. It'll teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in. - Community service? This is horrible. - You'll get used to it. And hopefully you'll come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I'm keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you. You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad. Man, that was the life. Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels. All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets. - except for the '80s. - How could he do this to me? Community service. coaching hockey! I found one! I'm comin' out! Karp,you finally found something for once in your life. Dumpster Dave comes through! - What do you think? - Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes. - You gonna take that from him, Karp? - Remind me to bust you, Averman. - Thanks, Peter. Thanks very much. - Did you get it? - Yeah! Right there! - Yeah! Here, Petie. Here, boy. A little chili to keep you warm, buddy. - Oh, yeah, that's nice. - Oh, yeah, look! I can't believe he ate the can too. He sniffs. He sniffs again. Looking for that perfect place. He sniffs some more. He stops. I think this is it! He's turnin' in a circle. - He squats! He scores! - Yes! We did it! Full load. Stinks! Come on, come on, give me the dollar! - Hurry it up already. - I'm hurryin', okay? - Go, go, go, go! - Yeah! All right! Let's do it! Oh, come on. Stop! - Yes! - Okay! Here we go. Yeah. There's more inside. He's takin'off with it. This guy deserves what he gets. Oh, guys, he saw us. Oh, my! Rink's gotta be around here someplace. Just look for a sign that says " Personal Hell. " How could he do this to me? I hate kids. They're barely human. Come on! Over here! Keep it down, please! Hey, come on. There's no need for this. Let's talk, come on. I'm your friend, aren't I? Come on, Goldberg, at least try to stop it. I'm tired of chasin' the puck. Be careful, man. It almost hit me that time. Goldberg, you're the goalie. It's supposed to hit you. Does that sound stupid to anyone else? Good God. That's the hockey team. Drive out on the ice. It'll be all right. I ain't scared. - You don't know what you're doin'. - Shut your face, Karp. We're gonna get in big trouble. - I'll take care of it. - They're drugs, I just know it. Yo, dude. You obviously in the wrong hood. This is my dominion. This is a drug-free zone, you understand? We ain't buyin' nothin'. I'm feelin' generous today. So I'm gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here. before we be usin' your eyeballs as hockey pucks. Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home 'til I take care of business. He's got a gun. Stand back. Whew! District Five Pee Wee hockey team. I'm Gordon Bombay. I'm the new coach. What a joke! - Yeah, right. - Afraid so, dude. Got the roster right here. Averman, Dave. Conway, Charlie. Hall, Terry. Here's the long and the short of it. I hate hockey and I don't like kids. What's this supposed to be, a pep talk? I'm sure this'll be a real bonding experience. Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail. - Funny. - Is there a goalie? Only for a little while. I'm movin' back to Philly. - Thank you for sharing that. - No problem. All right, get out on the ice. Let me see what you can do. Uh,just so you know. We really suck. I'll decide who sucks around here. - Get off me. - They really suck. The Pete-meister. Mr. Rabble-rouser. Passing the puck over toJesse-roonie, the enforcer. Ouch! That hurt! Oh, it's the Connie-meister, the velvet hammer. Hi, coach. I'm Connie. - Do you play? - No. So what's our record anyway? 0 and 9. One was pretty close, though. We only lost by five. We almost scored a goal too. So what do we do now. coach? - What did your old coach have you do? - He just yelled a lot. - That's how he hurt his arm. - His arm? Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, " Little bastards, where'd you learn to play? Oh, you suck, you! Skate, you little bast-" Heart attack. Great. All right, look. I gotta make a phone call. Keep scrimmaging. You, you, you, you and you against you four. - We got names, you know? - I'm sure you do. And I'll bet they're very nice names. I might even learn 'em. For now, I'll be in my office. Oh, and if you need anything, fax me. Geez, what a jerk. Where do they find these coaches anyways? We're impressionable kids, right? Shouldn't we check his qualifications or somethin'? Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages? Ducksworth! Then who's handling my cases? - On three! - Jane! - One, two, three! Charge! - Are you kidding me? She's outta law school one year. She's not qualified to - Hold on a second! Hey! Get your mouth off the windows! - Hey! - Get off there! Get off the car! - We're being invaded! - Get off! - Get off the roof, you little monkey. - Oh, cool! - Is that a real phone? - Yes, and I'm really on it. - Not any more. - Thank you. - Let's see, who should I - - Watch the upholstery. - Don't touch that. - We wanna ride! We wanna ride! We wanna ride! - We wanna ride! - I could kill one of'em just to set an example. Not yet, Lewis. Take 'em for a spin, anything! This looks good. I'm gonna eat it. - Wow, I feel like Madonna. - You wish! Seats ten comfortably. Hey, pass me one of those glasses. Yeah, I see your point. Oh. Goldberg! - It wasn't me, all right! - Young man, what did you eat? - Nothing! It wasn't me! - Open a window! Oh, man! It's my mom! - She looks pissed. - Oh, man. All right, out! Everybody, out of the car right now. Goldberg, why'd you have to ruin the fun? Are you out of your mind? What were you thinking putting that car on the ice? - My son was in that car. - Lady, lady, relax. One crack in the ice. That's all it would take. One crack! - The ice is not gonna crack. - Who do you think you are? - I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach. - The new coach? They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives. What danger? I grew up on the ice; I know when it's safe to drive on. - How do you know? - I just know! All right? Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn't cut it. Charlie, let's go. - Mom? - Give me my candy! All of it! Well, I guess practise is over. - Sorry my mom ruined it, guys. - It's all right, Charlie. Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow? By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah. Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! Hawks! One, two, three, four, five! One, two, three, four, five! One, two, three, four, five! - Hi, girls. - Karp! No! Goodbye. The hawks. My first game and it had to be the Hawks. Gordon? Gordon Bombay. - Coach Reilly. - We're both adults now. Why don't you just call meJack? Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh? Well, actually I'm, uh, coaching. Pee Wee. - District Five team. - No kiddin'. You got a kid on the team or something? No, I'm here because I need to be of service to the community. How about this, huh? Whoever thought we'd be coachin' against each other? Yeah, who'd have thought? So, who's your hotshot player this year? - Anyone good? - I got a kid named Banks. Might go all the way. Not quite as good as you were. But he wants it more. Kid won't give up. Oh, boy, I wish they would take that one down. Don't you? Well, good luck. You're gonna need it. It's up to you, Gordon. You miss this shot, you're not just. letting me down, you're letting your whole team down too. I wish your dad could be here to see this. Make him proud of you! Win! Win! Win! All right, guys, gather round. Come on, come on. - Win! Win! Win! - Win. Win. Win! Win! Win! - Win? - Win! Win! Win! Yeah, we're fired up. All right! Watch this! Oh, great. Good concept, guys. Nice - ouch! Nice goin', fool! - Sorry, I didn't mean to do that. - Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to. " Yeah, sure, you're on my own team. Oh, sorry, Goldberg. Didn't mean to. Would you get off me before I clock you? Let's go,Jesse! Go, Terry! Let's go! Come on in. What's this? The Oreo line! Hey, come on. Let's play hockey. Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter! - Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter! - Averman! It's hockey! There's no batter. Idiot. Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie! Hey, goalie, goalie, save, goalie, goalie! Hum, goalie, goalie, hey, goalie, goalie! No, I got him! I, I, I got him! That's one! Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Good show. Sloppy pass. Way to stuff it, Banks! All right, all right! Let's run it up! Run it up! Run it up! Oh, man! How could you let him get by you? All right, line change. Come on, go, go, go. Hey! Banks! Banks! Banks! Hey, you! Come back here! Oh! Why me? How lazy can you be? They're killing us out there! How many times do I have to tell you: Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks. Get - Just - Just get the hell outta here. All right! It's Spaz-way. He'll screw up. Hey, hey! Way to play it, Banks! All right! That's okay, Charlie! Nice try! Nice fan, Charlie. Keep swingin'. Maybe you'll give 'em a cold. Hey, hey, hey, knock it off! Against this team we should have twice this many! Now let's run it up! Remember it's not worth winning if you can't win big! All right! Guys! No! Come on, let's talk about this! Be civilized! Come on! Please! Oh no, guys! Come on, not again! Please! Just take the goal. Fine! I don't care! - I'm so embarrassed. - We need a new goalie. All right! Hey, knock it off! That was a lousy third period. Anybody could beat these pansies. I want you guys to stay hungry out there! All right, nice goin', Banks. New Hawks record. - Okay, boys. Let's go. - All right! Hey, Gordon! Nice game. I enjoyed it thoroughly. At least I can handle the puck! Hey, shut up! You guys stink! I thought we came here to play hockey. You know, I knew we forgot something. Oh, you think it's funny? You think losing is funny? Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it. We're the ones out there gettin' our butts kicked. Yeah, it's not like you coach us or anything. At least we try. You didn't listen to a word I said. I said, keep your heads up. You put your heads down. I said, hustle. You went slower! That was the sloppiest playing I've ever seen. Why the hell don't you just listen to me? Why the hell should we? I don't care. You want to lose, fine. You're the ones who look like idiots out there. Great game! Hans? I don't believe it! Who would throw these away? - First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each. - Fork it over. Forget it, Karp. I can see this every day on MTV. This one's from Minneapolis. Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom. - Let's give him a wedgie. - Good idea,Jesse! I was just kidding, okay? Hey! Give that back! - Hi, girls. - Does your mommy know you have that? Nah, she's busy with the mailman. That'll make great bathroom reading. That's mine, you jerk! I found it! You don't even know what to do with it, wuss-breath. - You gonna let him call you wuss-breath? - No! Hey! Hey! - Oh! - Come on. Want some more? You guys want some more? Come on! Yeah! You want some more? Come on! Let's get out! Move it! - Thanks a lot. - All right, man. One, two, three! Boom! What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy? Go! If we're gonna cheat, we gotta make those falls look real. Keep it up! Whoa! Score one for the spirit. Go at him! Go at him! Good! Go at him! Come on, get angry! Oh! Come on, make it look real. Act hurt! I am hurt. Good, good. Now say it again! Take the fall! Act hurt! Get indignant! - One more time! - Take the fall! Act hurt! Get indignant! Good! You guys are ready. Give me a break, ref! Open your eyes! Did you see what he did to me? Goldberg, you don't take the fall while they're shooting at you. Oh! Well, I guess you didn't explain that very well, did ya? - District Five! - I throw myself on the ice - Cut the acting class. One more dive, I forfeit to theJets! What? I'm insulted by that! - Let's go! Let's go! - Quit it! Face-off! Let's go! Charlie! That guy is twice your size. The next time he gets you in a corner like that, I want you to grab your eye like it's cut and then hit the ice! - Got it? Let's go. - Let's go! Face-off! Okay, even 'em up, boys. Here we go. Hey - - Come on! - That's it, Charlie. - That's it, Charlie! - Come on! Damn it, Charlie! We can't even win when we cheat. - Stupid cake-eater tricks! - That was embarrassing. Charlie! What the hell is the matter with you? When I tell you to do something, you do it! You got it? Look at me. - You got it? - You can't make me cheat. Jesse, Terry, let's go. This is what I gave up my overtime pay for? To see my kids takin' falls? Gordon. - How did you know? - Through the back door at this time of night. Just like you used to. You'd spend hours watching me do this. What do you think? Is this sharp enough? Ow! - Did you cut yourself? - No. You always fell for that. - God, you're morbid, Hans. - No, I'm Scandinavian. - It's nice to see you. - Sure, sure, sure. You probably thought I was dead. I saw you at the game the other night. Why didn't you say anything? You were so busy screaming at the kids. I didn't want to spoil the moment. - Everything's the same. - Well, the game hasn't changed. Why should my store? - Heard you became a doctor. - Lawyer. Oh, that's too bad. Enjoy that? Well, I hardly ever lose a case. That is not what I asked. Hmm! I see you still have this up. - Thanks very much. - It is important to remember the past. I'd just as soon forget it. That was the worse time in my life. My dad died that year. - The two are not related. - No, but it felt like they were. I found this not long ago. He was proud of you. I miss him. You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon. It's a shame you quit. You - - Could have gone all the way. Yeah. - No! You really loved to play. You remember? You remember. you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back. You really flew on that ice, Gordon. That's all I ever wanted to do. Then why did you stop? Reilly? I saw what he did to you. Reilly is an idiot. - The guy wins. - It's not about winning. It never was. Just show they how to play. Show them how to have fun. Teach them to fly. That is what they'll remember long after you've gone back to being a doctor. Lawyer. And long after they've stopped buying skates from me. Here. there you are. Sharpened, laced, ready to go. - What's this? - Your new skates. That is why you came here tonight, isn't it? - I figured nine and a half was your size. - Actually, I'm a nine. Wear thick socks, Gordon. Enjoy them. Here comes Bombay on an end-to-end rush. Past the blue line, past centre. He's not skating, he's flying! He fakes once, he fakes twice. Fakes three times! Shoots! Scores! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! What a play! What a guy! Gordon Bombay does it again! Great move, Gordy! You faked him out of his pads. Come here, son. You look great out there. Come on, let's go inside, get something to eat. A few more minutes? Please? - Go on. Get outta here. - Thanks. - Hi, uh - - Please,just go away. Charlie doesn't want. to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you. - Well, I have something to say to you. - Oh, really? Door-to-door mistreatment now. Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh? I came to apologize to Charlie. to both of you. - What? - Apologize. Well. you should. Charlie. Somebody's here to see you. Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'? I was just, uh, walkin' around thinkin' and, uh - Wanna give us a minute? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Listen, it was very wrong of me. to ask you and the other guys to cheat. I never should have said to you what I said to you. I was angry. I was frustrated. It took a lot of guts for you to do what you knew was right. I admire that. And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I'm - Oh, boy, this is difficult. - I'm - - You're sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right? Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be a lot more fun this time around. What do you say? Do you want to stay for dinner? - What? - Charlie! Uh, no, I - I can't. Uh - Well, what are you havin'? Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by. First off, I want to let you know things are going well. I'm learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk. Good, good. And the second thing? Well, sir, fair play doesn't come cheap. These kids, my team, have no money. They can't afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete. Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice. with old copies of the " Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads. The point I'm trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn't be taken seriously and neither are these kids. So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out. How much are we talking about? - $15,000. - No way. Wait a minute. Think of the goodwill. We name the team after the firm. Suddenly, we're the good guys. Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community. Come on. I'll get you your own jersey. ~ Ooo,yeah ~ ~ Can you feel it baby Ooo ~ ~I can too, Ooo ~ ~ Ooo ~ ~ Ooo, come on swing ~ ~ Come on swing ~ ~ Come on swing ~ ~ C-Come on swing Ooo ~ ~ Ooo ~ ~It's such a good vibration ~ ~It's such a sweet sensation ~ ~It's such a good vibration ~ ~It's such a sweet sensation ~ Who is that kid? Thanks, Fulton. - Fulton Reed. He's in one of my classes. - How come he's not on the team? He only plays football. Some preppie school gave him a scholarship. as long as he doesn't play hockey. - They don't want him gettin' hurt. - I heard it was colleges. He's been accepted to four of'em. - Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade. - Ah, shut up. Gordon Bombay? Bombay was a Hawk. ~. Good vibration ~ ~It's such a sweet sensation ~ ~Feel the vibration It's such a good vibration ~~ Dude, check 'em out, man. Holy cow. - They're pretty good skaters. - Anybody know who they are? That's Tommy Duncan. He's in my science class. That's his sister, Tammy. - Think they'd want to play hockey with us? - Yeah! Go get dressed. I'll do the negotiating. Just think of it as figure skating. with a stick. You're gonna love it, Tammy. Hey, atta boy, Tommy! Lookin' good, lookin' tough. Give me five, show me you're alive! Mom isn't gonna like this at all. So what? You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey. What do I know about hockey? More than you think. Back to basics! Skating! Go! Go! Side to side. Shift your weight. Get comfortable on your edges. That's good, that's good. Keep your balance, Karp. Trust your edges. That's okay, Charlie. Soft hands. You don't shoot the puck to your teammate. You sail it to him. Karp, on your feet. - You send it. - Oh! Gross! You don't stop the pass. You accept it. Cradle it. - Oh! - Again! Concentration, not strength. Like the Karate Kid, right? "Wax on! Wax off!" Just shut up and try it, Averman! - You're such a jerk. - Send it back, Averman. Good, Averman. Charlie. That's good. Good. Now sail it back. Oh! Way to go! Good, good. Good, cradle it. Cradle it. Soft hands, soft hands. Oh! Here it comes. Nice and easy. Good. - I did it! I did it! - All right. Nice drill, coach. Really very cute. - But when are you gonna work with me in goal? - Goldberg, do you trust me? My mother would not approve of this, coach. She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd. This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg. Today you will become a man. Coach, I think you got the ceremonies mixed up. It's more like a circumcision. Coach! Will you come back here? What'd I ever do to you, man? District Five! Ready! Oh, man, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. - Aim! - Nice knowin' ya, Goldie. - Oh, please! No! - Fire! I wanna go home! This doesn't hurt! You wimps! Give me your best shot! Oh! Come on! That's good! Hex goal! Goalie boot save! Whoa! Nice shot, man! I'm a dog! I'm a crazed dog! Come on! Goldberg! Goldberg! I am Goldberg! The goalie! Good! Good! All right, Charlie! Good hustle! Conway, way to go. All right, Karp! - You guys hungry? Tired? - Yeah! - Do you ache? Are you pumped up? - Yeah! Good! That was a hell of a practise. Be proud of yourself. Hey, guys! Excuse me, guys! You gotta untie me now! Ha-ha! Good joke. Very funny. I like it. No joke, come on, guys. Hey, coach! Coach, come on, don't leave me hangin' like this! Coach, don't make me come after you, coach. - Here you go. - Thanks. Thanks for the ride. You did real well in practise today, Charlie. Let me ask you something. What happened to your dad? Mom and I left him. I don't really remember, but that's what she says. You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too. Really? What happened to your dad? He passed away. You do a good job takin' care of your mom. - Thanks. - Keep it up, all right? - Okay. We'll see ya. - Okay. Hey, coach. - What's that? - Huh? - Oh! - Victory! You've just entered the tickling zone! So I'm right in the middle of my cross-examination and I say to the guy, I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole-faced rat. That's a good one, sir. Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hold it! Hold it! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Look, it was an accident, all right? Never mind the window. Where'd you learn to shoot like that? I didn't learn. I just do it. Do it again. Yargh! Well, you're great at breaking windows. Do you ever hit the goal? Yeah. Well, one out of five. Fulton, is it true what they say? About the scholarships and how they won't let you play hockey? People talk. It don't mean nothin'. - Why don't you play for us? - I can't. - What do you mean? - I mean, I can't. - You afraid? - No, I mean I can't, you moron. I don't know how to skate. Whoa! Is that all that's stoppin' ya? ~I ride the top of the line I can't settle for less ~ Push, Fulton, push. Keep your knees bent. Side to side, good! Follow me. Aaah! Watch it! Get out of the way! Sorry! ~ This is all we got baby It's got to be enough ~ ~I'd like to try to quit But I don't know how ~ ~I needed it then and baby I need it right now ~ Come on, Fulton. Let's go! - ~I gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied ~ - Hey! ~ Come on, Come on It's gonna be all right ~~ The Ducks? We're the Ducks? Man, what brain-dead jerk came up with that name? As a matter of fact, I did. But I didn't have a choice. We're being sponsored. By who? Donald and Daisy? Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks? You'd rather be District Five? Some stupid number? Better than some stupid animal. I'll have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom. - But they're wimpy. - They don't even have teeth. Neither do hockey players. Have you guys ever seen a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation? It's beautiful. Pretty awesome the way they all stick together. Ducks never say die. Ever seen a duck fight? No way. Why? Because the other animals are afraid. They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock. Oh, man! I'm proud to be a duck. And I'd be proud to fly with any one of you. So how about it? Who's a Duck? I'll be a Duck. Yeah. Me too. Anybody see Goldberg? All right! Now we're the Ducks! The Mighty Ducks! - What are we? - The Ducks! What the hell are they doing? Every time you get the puck, you're the quarterback. Make eye contact with the receiver. Talk to him, let him know it's comin'. Come on, guys. This isn't a library. Talk to each other. What a weird-ass team. How you doin'? - You ready? - I think so. Okay, Fulton. Shoot your heart out. My God! Wow! One out of five. All right, Let's forget the past. We lost a few games, tough! That was District Five. - Now we're the Ducks. - Yeah. - And the Ducks. are undefeated. - All right! Yeah! Quack, quack. - Quack. Quack. - Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Go. Ducks! What the hell was that? Let's go, Ducks! Defence! Defence! Dig it outta there! Let's go! Let's go! Yeah! Let's go, Ducks! Throw it! Throw it! To the crease! Yes! The Oreo line! That's my boy! Defence, Karp! Defence! Come on. I don't wanna go to school today, Mom. - How many fingers am I holdin' up? - He wouldn't know. Shut up, Peter. Karp, are you okay? - Look at this. - The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck. Let's get you off the ice. Come on. Get him on the bench, Charlie. Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here. Connie, Terry,Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon. Okay, Fulton. Remember,just like we talked about. Come on, guys. Let's do it. Oh, no. - Go! Get the face-off! - Line up, boys, let's go. That's it. Aaah! Whoa! Whoo! Yeah! That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play-offs. - The ducks have a shot at the play-offs? - Sure. Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember? Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season. So,you beat the Huskies and you'll make the play-offs. - Well, we might have to play the Hawks. - So? So they're a tough team. Nothing's changed since I played. Actually, one little thing has changed. You wouldn't even be a Hawk now. They redrew the district lines last year. The lake is not the boundary any more. You see? You'd be a Duck. I'd be a Duck. Excuse me. Coach Reilly? - Yeah? - I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem. - What's that? - One of your players is ineligible. Banks! Over here! - This is a joke, right? - I'm afraid it's no joke. - Problem? - No,just a mistake. Are you this boy's father? 450 North Hennipen, is that your address? - Yes. - I'm afraid there's no mistake. - This boy is playing for the wrong team. - What? According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five. - My son is a Hawk, not a Duck. - Is this your doing, Gordon? I'll expect to see him at our next game. - We'll have a uniform waiting for you. - No way. My son would rather not play than play for your team. Fine, if that's the way you want it. But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season. Boy, I'd hate to see that. Look, I'm sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map. Gordon? Hey, Bombay! You stop when I'm talking to you, son! What's the idea here? You trying to sabotage me or what? The law's a bitch when it works against you, isn't it,Jack? You got a whole team of Banks's. One kid isn't gonna make a difference. Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers? That's right, coach. They are losers. We hate losers, don't we? They don't even deserve to live. Maybe Banks won't make a difference, but at least we're playing by the rules. Why'd you turn against me, Gordon? For six years. I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score. I taught ya how to go for the "W." You could have been one of the greats. And now look at yourself. You're not even a has-been. You're a never-was. Going to the play-offs! Whoo! One win! Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform? We got warm-ups in half an hour. All right, everyone, listen up. I got some good news. We're getting a new player, Adam Banks. What? - He's a Hawk. - He's a good player. - Yuck. - Everybody hates him. - We don't need him. - I'm the coach. I say we do need him. - If we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help. - If? All of a sudden you don't think we're good enough. No, he thinks we're losers. That's what he told Reilly. - What? - We heard what you said. You said we were losers, we didn't deserve to live. - That's not what I meant. - I saw that picture of you missing that goal. You were a Hawk, weren't you? Guess you guys stick together to the end. You know what? I don't need your stinkin'equipment. - See you around. - Peter, come back here. - I'm talkin' to you, son! - Forget it, cake-eater. If you wanna play, play with yourself. Come on, Terry. Where do you guys think you're goin'? I don't believe this. All right, I'm goin' up to the bench because that's where I'm supposed to be. Anyone who wants to join me can join me. Anyone who doesn't - Well - Ten minutes to game time, coach. Yeah, yeah, they'll be out in a minute. They're, you know, working themselves into a frenzy. Not much of a frenzy. We forfeit. Ducks forfeit. Flames, you win. Hey. Can I sit? Sure. You talk to the guys? I tried. They think I'm a traitor for even showing up. I guess they really hate me, huh? Is it true you were really a Hawk? Yeah. Peter said you blew a really big game once. Yeah, well, Peter's right. It was the last game of the state finals. We were tied 2-2 in the end of the third period. I get a penalty shot. I go in, I triple deke. I fake the goalie right out of his pads. The puck's headed in, and then. Clang! Hits the post. We lost in overtime. A quarter of an inch this way and it would have gone in. A quarter of an inch, Charlie. Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you'd have missed completely. I never thought of it that way. At least you got to play in a championship game. - That must've been so cool. - Hey. Can I get you a cup of coffee? I'd love one. You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive. I know that, Charlie. That fact hasn't escaped me. So, what kind of guys does she usually date? Jerks. I mean, most of them like her, but as soon as they catch a glimpse of me - Pow! Warp speed! They are gone! - Don't take it personally, Charlie. - Oh, I wouldn't even care. except it's not fair to my mom. She deserves somebody nice. Are you gonna come over for dinner again? I don't know, Charlie. I'm not sure it's such a good idea. See, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I, um, talked toJesse and Terry's dad, and he's gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year. - You're quitting? - I'm stepping aside to keep the team together. The guys can't play for somebody they don't trust. I trust you. The other guys do too. They just don't know it. Talk to 'em. - I've done all I can. - No, you haven't. You gotta make 'em understand. You can't walk out on the Ducks. - We're your team. - No, you're not. We are too! We weren't even the Ducks until you came along. You made us and now you're stuck with us. Charlie. That's right. The red is oxygen. Now what are the blue balls? - Tommy? - Hydrogen? Is correct. Now put them together. and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body. - What is it? - Pizza? It's the principal. I'll be right back. Work on H2 CO3. It's a goody. - How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way? - Yeah, did you score? Leave me alone, guys. I don't want to talk about the team. Oh, yeah, sure. Coach's pet. Everybody knows he likes you best. - Likes his mom, you mean. - Take it back, Karp! Take it back now! - Leave him alone. - You have no right shoving Karp. - Don't push me. - Don't push her, she's a girl! - Lay off! - Don't shove, Peter. Atoms away! My atoms! You! Sit! Sit now! In your seats now! I have never in my life - What have you got to say for yourselves? Quack. Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack! Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon. By the way, your court release came through. - Congratulations. Your community service is over. - You're kidding. So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then? - Well, actually - - Oh, you got your jersey. Great! A lot's been happening. The Ducks might even make the play-offs. Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks. Sir, they're the bad guys. No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends. Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem. You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks. His older brother was a Hawk. All of his little friends are Hawks. That's where he belongs. It's a tradition. You understand that, Gordon. You played. But the league's already ruled on it. We've talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal. - You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League? - Yes, we did. The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season. And then next year, they redraft the lines. - Correctly. - The league did make one condition. What's that? That you withdraw your protest. - That's great. - Good, good. Well, that's settled then. No, sir, you don't understand. I can't withdraw my protest. - What? - Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play. and how to be part of a team. and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me. A team isn't a bunch of kids out to win. A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn. And I'm not gonna let those kids down. Gordon, I'm going to make this simple. Are you prepared to lose your job over some kids? Some game? Let me ask you, sir. Are you prepared to fire me over some kids? Some game? Collect your personal belongings, Gordon. Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth! Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth! Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth! - Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack. - Gordon, stop quacking. You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn't earn it. I'll see you in the play-offs. - Excuse me. There are some students here that I'd like to see. - Who are you? I'm their hockey coach. If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please. They're in room 223. - All of them? - All of them. "I will not quack at the principal. " - What do you want? - I want to talk to you guys. - People. - People, right. Sit down, please. All of you. Okay, don't sit down. Look, what's done is done. I want to be your coach again. You're gonna coach a bunch of losers? - No, I want to coach the Ducks. - What about the things you said? You said we didn't deserve to live. Karp, I was being sarcastic. Do you know what that means? - No. - Okay, then you do. I didn't mean those things the way they sounded. You guys know what it's like to be misunderstood, right? - Yeah, of course. We're kids. - So. Can you forgive me? Can I be your coach again? - What about Banks? - He can be on the team if he wants. He should have been with us all year. It's you guys who were cheated. Let's forget all that crap! - We're a team, right? - Yeah. I made you guys, and I'm sticking with you. So, what's it gonna be? We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play-offs. or we can forfeit again and the season's over. Peter, what do you say? Well. I guess it would help if we practised first. All right. Let me see if I can get you out of detention. - Yes. - Take that. You really quacked at the principal? Yeah. Are we Ducks, or what? Yeah! Look at your mother. Let's see how it is in ten minutes. I'm gonna kill you! Hey. Wasn't sure if you'd show up. Yeah, whatever. - I just want to play hockey. - Good. Ducks, you all know Adam Banks. On behalf of the Ducks, I'd like to say welcome. Cake-eater. Ooh, theJess-man, dissin'the new guy! TheJess-ster! Shut up, Averman! It's just a joke. Puttin' on a Ducks jersey doesn't mean you're a real Duck. - They're a good group once you get to know 'em. - I bet. Well, suit up. I'll see you on the ice. On your left! Over here! I'm open! Come on, right here! Up front! - Up front! - Pass it to Banks! Come on! Do somethin' with it! Yeah! All right! Way to go, Banks! All right! Score another one for the Ducks! Goldberg, you're gonna sit this one out. What? You're pulling the goalie when we're tied? Listen, listen, listen! A tie isn't gonna help us. We need the win. Okay, Fulton, you're our extra man. Everybody, get the puck to Fulton. That's your job. - We pulling the Statue of Liberty play? - Yeah? No, take your shot. You may only get one, so it's gotta be good. - But, coach, one outta one? - Soft hands, Fulton. - Concentration, not strength. - That's right! Okay? Let's get the Huskies! Let's go! Come on! Let's back it up, boys. Let's make it a fair one. Let's go! - Get in there! - Come on! Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot! Shoot, Fulton, shoot! We won! We made the play-offs! Boy, this is great. Guys, look, it's the North Stars. - Oh, man. - It's Mike Modano! - . Believe this? - Cool! This is too cool. I can't believe this. This place is humongous. What are we doing here? It's a little play-offs present. Hey, Gordo! Gordon Bombay, right? - You remember me? - Sure, from Pee Wees. - This guy used to rule in Pee Wees. - I heard you were a farmer. Actually, I became a lawyer. But I'm coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks. - Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano. - We can see that. - All right. - Hey, Ducks! Listen to this guy. He knows what he's talking about. If you ever want a shot, I'll get you a tryout in the minor league clubs. - Thanks. - No problem. Hey, nice seein' ya. Take it easy. All right, let's have some fun! ~ You've got to accentuate the positive ~ ~Eliminate the negative ~ ~Latch on to the affirmative ~ ~Don't mess with Mister In-between ~ ~ You've got to spread joy up to the maximum ~ ~Bring gloom down to that minimum ~ ~Have faith or pandemonium ~ ~ You're liable to walk upon the sea ~ ~ To illustrate my last remark ~ ~ Talking aboutJonah in a whale and Noah in an ark ~ ~ What did they do when everything looked so dark ~ ~ Then they say ~ ~ You better accentuate the positive ~ ~Eliminate that negative ~ ~Latch on to the affirmative ~ ~Don't mess with Mister In-between ~ ~ We better accentuate the positive ~ ~Eliminate all the negative ~ ~Latch on to the affirmative ~ ~Don't mess with Mister In-between ~ ~No, don't mess with Mister In-between ~ - Hey! - Hey! ~Don't you mess with Mister In-between ~~ You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear. all through the play-offs last year for luck. So I'm doin' the same thing. Hmm. Maybe I should've cooked. You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight. - All three of us? - Sure. I don't think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework. You should go. With my mom. By yourselves. Mmm, smells great! Hello. Go for it. Hi. I don't know how they sculpt these. Hmm, I wonder. I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings. How do you think they do the details? Oh, little men. Tiny chisels, big mittens. Oh. I'm nervous. I'm rambling on and on here. You probably think I'm weird. No, I think you're great. When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle. And that was my room, that window right up there. And last winter I gave Charlie that one. What about me? Which window's mine? I want to live there too. What? What did I say? - It's just not that easy. - What's not that easy? Casey, I was just playin' around. Look, I don't know how you feel about me. I don't even know how I feel about you. But I do know there's a little kid back home. who's absolutely falling in love with his coach. and if you can't deal with that, if you're just playing around, then you better let me know. What are we talking? 'Til death do us part? - I have to decide on the first date? - Stop it, Gordon. Charlie's gonna be there when we get back. And tomorrow. And ten years from now. Look, I can take it. But if Charlie gets too attached - Every time this happens, it gets. a little rougher on him. Just on him? I'm glad to be here with you. Me too. The surprising Ducks are still in this game. against the Hornets. Banks moving right in front, stops. He shoots, he scores! It's getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets. Here's Adam Banks in the slot. He stops, shoots. He scores! Back it goes to Averman. He shoots! Score! The ducks win it, 5-3 over the Hornets. And now it's on to the semifinals. where the Ducks will face the Cardinals. What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen! The Ducks and the Cardinals!

Can you believe it? 4-2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals. All right, it's up to you, Gordon. Now,you miss this shot, you're not just letting your team down, you're letting me down too. Remember, it's not worth playing - - If you can't win. - That's right. Okay, son, let's go. Let's go, son! ~. Oh, say does that star-spangled ~ ~Banner yet wave ~ ~ O'er the land of the free ~ ~And the home of the brave ~~ - Let's go! - Let's go! All right!

The Ducks in green chasing it down against - A hard hit out at centre ice! Keep it away from 'em! Come on, Banks! Heavy hitting continues in this championship game. Banks up the centre ice.

Number seven, McGill. Cross-checking. Two minutes. Don't worry, guys. Did it go in? - Yeah, man. - Jesse, do me a favour. Kick some Hawk butt. All right, cake-eater. He'll be okay, sir. We need to take some X rays, though. Hell of a job, son. They score against us, they're gonna pay the price. Now, don't worry. We're gonna get that one back. You got somethin' to say to me, Bombay? To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought. You're goin' down, Reilly. - Let me go after 'em, coach. Let me get 'em. - No, we're better than that. Look, look, it's time to play smart hockey, Duck hockey. - All right? Now we got the power play. - Yeah. All right. We're gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there. Fulton, you're in. - Coach, they'll be rushin' him. - Right. Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time. - Right, coach. - Jesse, do good. Let's go! - Yeah! - Hold it! Wait! Whoa!

No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot! What kind of call is that? Okay, we've got a penalty shot for the Ducks. Coach, penalty shot. Anyone on the ice can take it. All right, Ducks, who's gonna take it? - I think he should take it. - Me? What about Charlie? - What about Charlie? - All he does is fan. Let's let him finish what he started. - Coach, we have a chance to win. - Damn straight we do. Come here. You been practising that triple deke? - Yeah. - Then you're all set. You may make it, you may not. But that doesn't matter, Charlie. What matters is that we're here. Look around. Whoever thought we'd make it this far? One, two, three. Triple deke. Take your best shot. I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose. - Thanks, coach. - Go get 'em. - All right, Charlie. - Let's go, Charlie. Okay, now wait for my signal. Good luck. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. Okay, now don't leave your crease before he touches the puck. Good luck. Come on, Charlie. Come on, Charlie. ~ We are the champions, my friend ~ ~And we'll keep on fighting ~ ~ 'Til the end ~ ~ We are the champions ~ ~No time for losers ~ ~ 'Cause we are the champions ~ ~ Of the world ~ ~ We are the champions, my friend ~ ~And we'll keep on fighting ~ ~ 'Til the end ~ ~ Oh, we are the champions ~ Thank you, Hans.

Help me! Give me your hand! Give me your hand! Your hand! Give me your hand! Where the hell is the stunt coordinator? I said, where the hell is the stunt coordinator? Juli√°n! Juli√°n! 800 BULLETS <i>Hey, Sergio, how are you?</i> <i>No, I can't talk to you now.</i> <i>Be quiet, Carlos!</i> <i>Why don't you tell my secretary?</i> <i>She can check my diary</i> <i>and we'll meet next week.</i> <i>No, the week after.</i> <i>No, I've got a bunch of clumsy idiots.</i> <i>They're going to wreck all my furniture.</i> <i>But, you know, that's how it is.</i> <i>What about the Argentineans?</i> <i>You know what they're like.</i> Tell them I'll call them tomorrow, or sort it out yourself. Carlos, stop running around, love. He'll poke someone's eye out. I said he was too young for that toy but as no one ever listens to me. Then say something to him. No, I'm not his mother! Carlos, help those gentlemen. Yes? I can hardly hear you. We'll talk later. I didn't want to come. You've said that 20 times! This house is shit, it doesn't have a pool. All that money on private schools and he swears like a trooper. Careful, that's Bohemian crystal! Can't you see? It says "Fragile"! Come here, child! Fucking kid! You little shit! If I could get.! If I catch you. If your father were alive, he'd give you a good thrashing, you little devil! Unfaithful dog! The little creep! The contract says four bathrooms, four, not three bathrooms and a shower room. What? No, no, a shower room is always a shower room. It's got a shower and a toilet. What do you want? This is my day off. - We've got it. - What have we got? The answer to everything. They can't beat us now. Is that what I think it is? The Belgians' offer. It's got everything. The launch, merchandising, the plan of the park, and, most important, the price. Now we've really got them by the balls! - How did you do it? - Easy. I sent someone to Belgium. He broke into their office, stole this disk and brought it to me for 120,000 Euros. 120,000 Euros? You're joking. You think it's expensive or cheap? I think it's outrageous to act like that. Should I return it? Shut up! It's excellent. Look at the terrain. It's better than ours. And cheaper. 200 million less. Dollars, eh? Not Euros. If we cut out your salary. Very funny. But there's one thing they can't hide. What is it? And the Americans want sun. They lost millions in Paris with that water-logged EuroDisney. That's where we hit them! We cut our budget by 250 million and sell them the sun. A blazing sun! Spanish sun! Long live Islam! Down with the West! Laura! You're going to die! Carlos, come down! He'll kill himself. Die, grandma! He'll be the death of us! Can't you watch him for five minutes? Your child is a monster! Carlos, come down, darling! You'll hurt yourself! It's in his blood. You know who I mean. One day there'll be a disaster. Don't say that again. Ever! MOM Who's this man dressed as a cowboy? Is your grandma asleep? Since the film started. Turn off the TV and go to bed. I've got a lot to do. Where did you get that? Give it to me. And leave my things alone. It's daddy, isn't it? It's dad. Carlos. Give me that, I said! Why is he dressed as a cowboy? It was a fancy dress party. Give it to me! Why did you never show it to me? Because. Because I didn't. Give it to me. If you take anything of mine again without asking you'll have no holiday! You never talk about him. - Because he's dead. - I know that. He died in an accident, you told me 1,000 times. But you never tell me anything else. It isn't a nice story to tell. Stories end happily, and this one ended badly. Go to your room. God, I've got my headache back. Come here. Give me a kiss. I loved him very much. Very much. "Two Rifles and A Grave" That's your grandpa. Shit, grandma, don't do that! Your grandpa and your dad made westerns. Come off it! "I'll Go, Kill Him and Come Back." "Two Bullets For Charlie." They were all dreadful films, but they laughed so much! Anything so as not to work. Your grandpa was a lazy rascal. Like you. Look at him. And dad? Your dad was a simple soul. He couldn't say no. If dad hadn't died, I'd have been born in America. In America? That's Almeria. In America, he says! Your granddad never went further than Portugal. He's probably in some fly-ridden bar down there. Is he still alive? If your mother hears me, she'll kill me. I swear I'll say nothing. Is he still there, in Almeria? I didn't say anything. Don't dare mention him in front of your mother, you hear? May I keep the photo? Get up, you're late and the bus won't wait. Have you packed your bag? What bag? You'll need spare clothes. Give me another five minutes. In five seconds, I want you downstairs having breakfast. - Got your cell phone? - Yes. I tapped in the numbers of the house, the office, and my secretary's house. If anything happens, I'll call. Here. Take this. In case you need money. Here, the code is in the cell phone. It's only for an emergency. You shouldn't give him that. If it gets stolen. It'll just make things worse. What use is ten Euros? Don't drive me crazy, Rocio, for God's sake. You'll regret it later. That's enough. They're just kids going to the snow. - See you. - Give me a kiss. Behave yourself. Do everything you're told. If they offer you pills or joints or anything like that, you know. Say yes, and spit it out. Yeah, grandma. You shouldn't have given him that card. You have to make a drama of everything. He's going to a ski camp, not to Vietnam! How little you love me. You wouldn't talk to your mother like that. I talk to everyone like that. Since my son died, I'm a nobody. - What did you tell him? - Me? Nothing. Don't lie to me, I'm not stupid. You'll have to tell him some day. Think about how you'll do it. Drop it, or you won't set foot in my house again. I won't drop it. He's my grandson! If you've told him anything, I'll send you to an old folks home. And there are no sun beds there. That's too bad. I'm sorry about your grandma. Yes, she's got cancer. I have to go to the hospital. Well, I hope she gets better. - Where are we going? - Almeria. Where? To the province of Almeria. How much will it cost? Fuck knows! Let's see. Ten years ago, it was 20,000 to go to Asturias. Now it would be about 70,000. 420 Euros, at least. Is this enough? Listen, you're not in trouble, are you? I don't want any hassle because of you. No, I'm going to a shoot. A film shoot? Yes, my grandpa is an actor. In Almeria. "Two Rifles and A Grave". With "Bob Dereck". Fucking hell. Your grandpa and "Bob Dereck". Lucky devil! He's made over 50 films. Actors are always getting it. My cousin is one and he told me. You know the ad for removing grease without scrubbing? My cousin is the grease. The grease? And he played a cockroach once. In an ad for insecticide. What an actor! My grandpa works with Americans. Shit, that must be one hell of a life. Orgies every other day. You sure it's here? Maybe they've stopped for lunch. See? What did I say? Spielberg. Yeah, but today's Sunday. He won't be here. So I think I'll be off. I want to get back in daylight. Here, kid. What about the extras? No, I'm in no mood for an orgy today. Say hello to your grandpa for me. You've got my card if you need me. Ten Euros. Do I have to pay? If you want to go in, you sure do. When does the show start? - It depends. - On what? If there are people, they do the show. If not, why bother? In any case, I have to be here. Whether they do it or not, I have to be here. Just in case. Some Germans have gone in, so they'll do it today. - So long. - Yeah, have fun. Kid, get out of the way! Get out of town, Cheyenne! We don't want you here! I don't talk to pigs! Can you repeat what you just said? I don't talk to pigs! I didn't hear you properly, Cheyenne. Say it again. Fuck, I don't talk to pigs. I'm going to do it well. I will, I will, I will. It was all a trap. You came here like a friend but you just wanted to betray me! That star is going to be mine, sheriff. It's my destiny. Damn! The indians! We're alone now. Your time has come. Shoot, you damn coward! Cheyenne, you're so ugly you made him cry. Five little wolf cubs. Ladies and Gentlemen! Tomorrow, at the same time, a new show in the wonderful Texas Hollywood! For only ten Euros, you can experience the real American West. A dream come true for the whole family! I'm telling you, that's the last time. Fucking Coca-Cola cans! And I'd swept the ground three times. Get up, Manuel. Come on, on your feet. You all right? Great, I didn't feel a thing. - Did it look realistic? - You're terrific. I didn't use my hands because it looks false. Fucking great! That's the way I like it! If only they all cared as much as you do. And some bastard threw broken glass there. It's no big deal. They can drag you the next time. At your age, I was doing it without a shirt. They dragged me from here to Almeria. Afterwards, I'd knock back a few drinks and that was that. Hey, you bastards! Get me down from here! The show's over. Come on, for crissake. Look! Whoever is happy can stay. Whoever isn't can fuck off. But stop pissing me around. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. - Give me a drink. - Lf you pay. Go on, and put it on my slate. Don Mariano says no slate. Give me a break about Don Mariano. And put on your costume. This looks like a fishmonger's. What about you? Aren't you working today? <i>Ma cazzo vuoi?</i> Have you started already? <i>Ma va fan culo. You tell me niente.</i> Were those your Coca-Cola cans? Juli√°n, we can't go on like this. Nobody comes anymore. Yesterday, we had two French, today, five Germans, and tomorrow, God knows. There are more people doing the show than watching it. Remember those busloads of Japanese? <i>Madonna!</i> We haven't had any Japanese in years. They go to Seville now, to the pirate show. Yeah, there's a boat, water. <i>Here, there's troppo ma troppo calore.</i> And the food's great in Seville. It's not any better than here. I found a place at the gas station. No, the thing is, they prepare their show, they rehearse it. They take it seriously, they're professionals. What do you mean, professionals? You know who you're talking to? I was double for the two gutsiest guys on the planet. I drove the tank in "Patton" for George S. Scott who won an Oscar in Hollywood. And now we'll hear about Clint Eastwood's poncho. Yeah, asshole, Clint Eastwood's poncho. I wore Clint Eastwood's poncho in "For a Few Dollars More", "A Fistful Of Dollars" and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" So don't talk about professionals or I'll smash your face. I'll smash your face. Chacho's broken something! Now what's wrong? He fell badly off the horse. I'm not surprised. He's fucking stoned all day. Hang on. It's nothing. We should call an ambulance. Cut the drama. It's nothing, for crissake. Jacinta, call Emergencies. Jacinta, you're not to move. No ambulances. We're not insured. Nobody's covered, we'd be in the shit. Jacinta, call Don Mariano. He's in charge. When Don Mariano isn't here, I'm the one in charge. This is a sprain, that's all. Well, do I call or not? You'll all need an ambulance when I get down! Shitheads! Who's that? I don't know, he was with the Germans. He got left behind. That's all we needed. - Sir. - C'mere, kid. Come up here. Give me a hand. Where are you going? I'll try to head them off. - Sir. - What about Chacho? In the jail, by my bunk there's some rheumatism ointment. Give him some and see if that sorts him out. Sir, listen. - Sir. - Shut up, kid. So long, Jos√© Mar√≠a. Juli√°n! Next time, he'll fucking eat the sheriff's star! You're all talk, but then. He shot at me and you said nothin'. - They were blanks. - You couldn't care less. Coochy, coochy, who loves you more than I do? Coochy, my ass! Keep your lousy hands off me! Someone get me down! I'm fucking sick of this! What do you bet he gets something for returning the kid? Is this kid yours? You left the boy behind. I'm not German. That's what I've been telling you. You're not? Then who the hell are you? Carlos Torralba. I think I'm your grandson. Sorry, I didn't hear you properly. I'm your grandson, Laura's daughter! All right, but you don't have to shout. Your mother isn't here, is she? No, she's in Madrid, working. But she knows you're here. No. You haven't run away, have you? Not run away exactly. I'm supposed to be skiing with the school. Fucking hell. I just wanted to meet you. If it's a problem, I'll clear off. Yes, it is a problem, and a big one. If your mother finds out she'll kill me. She and I don't get on very well. She doesn't talk much about you. That's good. Well, Carlos, I'm delighted to have met you. Carry straight on and you'll come to the road. Not this way. This leads to the western town. The real one is over there, half an hour away. Shit, don't follow me, kid. Grandma says you're a lazy rascal. Your grandma should have died years ago. She says that about you. So we agree on something. We should both be dead. I keep trying. I drink whiskey, kill Indians, smoke three packs a day, and I can't manage it. I'm strong as an ox. And that really pisses some people. Tell your grandma that. Why don't they make any more films? There aren't any films like in the old days. I mean the good ones. Now they're either for old women or full of special effects rubbish. They used to be about Romans and submarines. The submarine ones were great. The westerns were the best. I was number one, kid. I made 50 films as a stuntman, and seven with a line to say. And I had to say them in English! I still remember. And my father? Your father. Didn't I tell you to clear off? Will you get the hell out of here? Do you know how my father died? What did those witches tell you? Nothing, I swear. Did they say I killed him? Grandma said it was an accident. I had nothing to do with it. - You're hurting me! - I wasn't even there! You're hurting me! Christ, the German! What's up? Did your parents abandon you? Get in, or the wolves will eat you! I've got a wooden box in here that's just your size. You bastards! Come on, get in. Have you all worked in films? They say they have, but I think they've never seen a camera in their lives. Juli√°n has. He was a stuntman for the stars. He was Clint Eastwood's double. They were real buddies. Yeah, real buddies, my ass! He did leave his poncho. So why are you here? I ask myself that every day, kid. The gallows are more fun than a scaffolding. Gravedigger, tell him your story. Lay off, at least I had a contract. A contract! He came here to work in a spaghetti western and it started raining! They cancelled the shoot and there was no more spaghetti! There were floods for the first time in fifty years! <i>Porca miseria schifosa!</i> Hooligans! Snacks and Meals COWBO YS BAR Do you hear me? Boots off the table or I'll unplug the satellite dish. Shit, she doesn't even own the place. God knows what possessed you to get into this western business. You'd be better off here with me. Juli, I'd be no good at catering. I'm an actor. A what? Falling out a window is acting? What I do is different, Julita. I've got dialogue, a text. Let me see. "Give me a whiskey, Joe." That's dialogue? ' Watch out, the confederates are coming.' Look at how you said it. If you say it as badly as that, even Shakespeare is shit. For your information, I've had offers. What offers? I was offered a splendid part in a play. I didn't tell you because you don't approve. So what is it? It's a world famous show. It's been a hit everywhere. They're setting it up now in Almeria. The Hall of Horror? What's wrong? It's a very decent show. I wouldn't do any old thing. You know who I'd be, kid? I'd be Dracula. King Kong would suit you better. Let's go see a film. I'm watching the game with this lot. Do you always have to follow the others? You don't like soccer. I like being here for a while, having a beer, the atmosphere. Atmosphere. We've had seven years of atmosphere. One of these days I'll take my stuff and clear out. Can I pay with Visa? What are you doing? Be careful with that. The world is full of thieves who'd do anything. I bet you don't even know the number. What is it? Don't you dare! It was for the boy's own good. It's on the house. You can stay here tonight, but tomorrow you're going home. Your mother'll be worried. Don't be like that. Tomorrow we'll take the car and go visit a mall. Pass the ball, man! Pass it! He's a halfwit! A halfwit! It isn't your fault. Your wife and daughter-in-law filled the boy's head with lies. That's right, lies. I didn't do anything. I'm a good person. Don't you think I'm a good person? You've got a heart of gold. Come on, eat your omelet. I'd never hurt anyone, least of all my own son. Everyone here knows that. No, not everyone. And now that kid has turned up. And he's scared of me. - Your grandson? - Yes. He thinks that I killed his father. Christ Almighty! Watch it, grandpa! I'm not your fucking grandpa. Leave him, he's drunk. I'll be whatever I want, shithead! Take it easy. We're here for a bit of fun. At my expense! I saw you laughing behind my back. You haven't a clue. Watching the fucking television! You faggots wouldn't know what to do with a whore! People come here to fuck! And you're fucking us. Juli√°n, leave them be. You're going to eat your tie! These are for real, not like the ones in your lousy films. Juli√°n, are you all right? Yeah, of course I am. This is what I work at. All those years of broken ribs and smashed teeth were of some use. It's nothing. I'm a professional, see? I'm on my feet again, good as new. What's your name? Sandra. Where have you been hiding? Go on, go with her. It's on the house tonight. You think that.? Now that you mention it, I could do with a lie-down. Come on. 'Evening, Don Mariano. Have you done the till yet? Hurry up, I still have to close the video club. - They're like tourists. - They won't run. Why are they here? I don't want to see them until they've paid their bills. I've got everything written down. Goal! Athletic! Athletic! What's up with him? Nothing. Now he says he's from Bilbao. Throwing yourself out of windows isn't good for the brain. The other day he arrived in shorts. He said he was hot. Forgetting to get dressed is bad, but saying he's from Bilbao. I'm not saying it. I am. From the heart of Bilbao, the greatest place in the world. The Guggenheim, the hanging bridge, the "txacolin". Look, Manuel. Can't you hear yourself when you talk? What? You've got an Andalusian accent. You were born in Cadiz. Your father is from Chipiona. Your mother is from Barbate. You like paella, flamenco. At fifteen, you wanted to be a bullfighter. No, no, that's impossible. I'm "abertzale", for crissake! Arzalluz, Julen Guerrero, cod "pil-pil". That's my world! You women are so pretty. Christ Almighty. Where did you say you came from? Logro√±o. Shit, I thought you were Cuban or something, but Logro√±o. No, I worked for three years in Logro√±o. Before that, I was in Tudela, Laguardia, Miranda de Ebro. Miranda de Ebro is beautiful. A friend of mine in the Legion was from there. Andr√©s. Do you know him? Andr√©s? It doesn't ring a bell. - It doesn't? - No. That's odd, because he liked whoring around. He's a Civil Guard now. Listen. You don't mind, do you? It's just that I'm feeling a bit sleepy. No, sweetheart. Don't worry. You go to sleep. I'll stay here. Listen, don't tell anyone, eh? Tell them what? Nothing's happened. Precisely. And that's what you mustn't say. That nothing happened. Tell those people to go away. I'm getting in a bad mood. All this fucking show. He isn't there. Hey, you bastards! If we're not going to start, take me down! Cheyenne! <i>Niente. He isn't in the saloon, or in the bank.</i> I even checked the stables. What about the camels? Sometimes he sleeps in with them. Look, he isn't here! We have to do something! People are waiting! Everyone stay calm. We mustn't panic. I'll see to everything. Are you there? What are you doing? Someone has to take charge. He's here! Do you hear? Nobody fucking listens! Where am I? In Kansas City, dickhead! The Germans have been waiting for the sheriff, so get a move on! Didn't I tell you to go away? Let me stay, please. Just for a few days. Don't you understand me? I told you to disappear. I don't want to see you. But why? Because I fucking say so! Bring me a blanket! Jacinta, get the truck and take him into town. He's not to miss the bus. Now, let's see if we can start working. Put this on, it fell off. Hey, I'm waiting for the signal! Let's try to do it right, one thing at a time, not all at once, for crissake. Bring cigarettes! Move the fucking car! You're ruining the show! I'm not in the mood for this shit. Not now, Manuel. Was that realistic? Very realistic, but give us a minute. Get lost. You know why I'm here. You? To screw us up, as usual. The Germans are roasting in the sun and you come barging in. I've got no time for jokes. Just hand over the stuff or I'll go after it. What are you talking about? You asked for it. Andr√©s, where are you going? There's nothing to see in there. What's the combination? It's made of wood, for crissake. El√≠as. You lot, stand there where I can see you. Shit, a ham! What's this? I've never seen it before. What is it, anyway? - We've given up drugs. - Like hell you have. Who the fuck tipped you off? I'm not naming names. There are at least 15 kilos of hash in there. It's for personal consumption. - With the family. - Right. Tell that to the judge! Come on. Get moving. We haven't done anything! Bastard! It's your business, I only get a share. I never knew that. This doesn't happen in Bilbao. You shouldn't have handcuffed me. What'll people say? They wanted a show, didn't they? You'll leave us all without a job, that's what you'll do. Pay the bail. With what? The hash? Find something. Shit, the fuzz. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and. If I'd thumped you in the Legion, you wouldn't do this to me now. Don't start on about the old days. I do as I'm told. The captain wants to get rid of any junkies or. Or trippers. Well, you've got enough of those. Take my picture and I'll book you, foreign shit! Come on, get in there. Come on! They've gone. And now how the hell do we pay the fucking bail? Hey! Driver! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! You have to come with me. Your grandpa's been arrested and we have to bail him out. You must have dropped it in the bar. If we'd known the number we wouldn't have bothered you. This is my goddamn grandson. Let's celebrate. Let's raise hell, like in the old days. What about the indians? They're not getting out yet. This country is like that. The judge wants to ask them about some radio cassettes. Are we having the party without them? Listen to me. There are some really shitty moments in life. A lot more than you'd think. Nobody can prevent them. You have to make the most of the time in between them. Not enjoying yourself when you can is the greatest sin in the world. Hell! I've just remembered something. What? We left Jos√© Mar√≠a up there again. Somebody will let him down. Who's Jos√© Mar√≠a? The hanged man. Bastards. - Wait a minute. - Where are you going? To hire some talent! 'Afternoon, gentlemen! Good afternoon! Would any of you be willing to work in the wonderful world of show business? What the hell's going on? This is what you call an audition! We wanted indians, right? Well, we've got them! Bastards! This is a free country. If these gentlemen want to play the fool, you just shut your face. Now, listen. You have to learn this off by heart. A pair, a double pair, three of a kind, full house, straight flush, poker and royal flush. Got that? Aren't face cards better than a full house? Don't distract me. Professionals never play with face cards. You don't want to play with the queen. Why? She's a pain in the ass. She wants you home early, she gets angry if you play with other cards, and you always end up cheating, like I did with your grandma. Why are you telling the kid that? Because it's true. It's better he finds out now. Your grandma and I had a ball together, until it ended. Do you never want to see her again? Yes, of course I do. When I'm dead! Don't listen to him. Your grandpa is a flirt. In my place, I've got lots of clients who are happy with their wives. Your father was a good poker player. No one saw how he hid the cards up his sleeve. Look, Carlos, I never loved anyone more than your father. We were inseparable, until he married your mother. She didn't like him being a stuntman. She said he could do better. She was right. Your father was very smart. He could've been whatever the hell he wanted. We were going through a bad spell here. They'd started with all that shit about spaceships and galaxies. It seemed nobody was going to make a western again, much less in Almeria. Then that guy they called the Russian turned up. Because he drank vodka, right? No, because he was from Moscow. He had money. He swapped whores and caviar for porn videos that he sold on the black market in St. Petersburg. Anyway, he wanted to make a film and he wanted the best. So he called me. And I called your father. You know what happened? No. Tell him. He came back to Almeria, back to the west with his father! You just had to see the smile on his face to know that this was his world. He was very good. Much better than me. He was afraid of nothing. He was afraid of nobody. I don't know what happened. I don't know what went wrong. We'd rehearsed it so often. What the hell! Come on! What's going on here? All you whores. Start dancing, like in the west! What are you looking at? Come on. If you want, you can touch my tit. No, that's not how you do it. That's how you call an elevator. Look. You have to feel its weight. Just imagine that they're little bags, full of coins that make a sound like this. Now you try it. Do it gently, or it won't work. Try again. Oh, how cute. Mom? I'm here in the cabin. Really? Yeah. No, I'm being very good. Don't worry. Mom? I can't talk now, the monitor is calling me. We've got a group meeting or something. Great. I have to hang up. No, nothing. All right. I'm fine, really great. 'Bye. 'Bye. There are over 400 children. We can't check on them all every day. And this isn't a prison. I called you as soon as I realised. Be quiet. I'm trying to think. Did he say where he is? No. But I've got an idea. Listen, I'm talking to you. Yes, yes. Did I tell you that I screwed Raquel Welch? Yes, yes. How could I have told you? We only met this afternoon. Fuck you. Yes, yes. Well, I'm going to tell you. Listen. We were making a film here in Almeria, "100 Rifles", and Raquel Tejada, for that's Raquel Welch's real name, habibi, says to me, "How long do we have?" And I say to her, "Until the next take." She took me to her trailer. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Twenty minutes, Habibi. Are you listening, asshole? Yes, yes. Oh boy oh boy oh boy. You lot are the limit. You shower of bastards. You can understand when you want to. Fuck! What time is it? Time for the show! Grandpa! Three things. One, don't call me grandpa. Two, don't shout when I'm hangover. Three, what the hell is it? The show! We can give it a miss for once. The Japanese are waiting. The Japanese? The Japanese are back? How many are there? A busload. I don't know if he's asleep or if he's dead. No matter. Carlos, get dressed. Me? What do I have to do? Just get on the roof, shoot me and that's it. No falling. Why not? Let me try it. You want to end up like him? You want to be from Bilbao too? I'm going to the gallows. Sons of bitches! Bastards! Get out of town, Cheyenne! We don't want you here! I don't talk to pigs! Can you repeat what you just said? Fuck, I don't talk to pigs! I can't hear you, Cheyenne. Say it again. You've busted my balls! Carlos! I don't believe it! Christ! I told you not to fall. - How did I do? - I'm going to kill you! You did great! You were fantastic! I can accuse you of kidnapping. He's under age, Juli√°n. You can go to jail for this. Mom, it was me. None of it is Juli√°n's fault. Be quiet. We'll talk back at home. Let's go, I don't want to waste another second here. I'm staying. Don't talk rubbish. Get in the car. Get in the car! You've got the same problem again, Laura. They don't love you. They prefer to live here with me, in Almeria. It's in their blood. You're a bastard, Juli√°n. I'll do all I can to ruin what little life you've got left. I swear to God! You can't hurt me here. This is my home. Your home? This is a drunkard's nightmare. A carnival sideshow run by three deadbeats. They've all gone, Juli√°n. Or they're dead. Like your son! You killed him. With your lies and with your stinking films! I won't let that happen again. I'm not angry with you. But why are you treating me like this? You tricked me, lied to me, and did the one thing that could really hurt me! You went to your grandfather. I didn't know him. You still don't know him. All this is just a front. It's a fa√ßade, like him. Yes, he may seem like a legend. An old adventurer from the west. But if you knew him like I do, you'd know that behind that front, there's nothing. He's an old alcoholic who's never done anything for anybody. He just wants to enjoy himself. That's why he needs to be alone. It's easy to be funny when you don't have to pay taxes or school fees or doctor's bills for anyone. In the real world you have to give up lots of things if you really love people. In that case, why did Dad leave you and go back with him? - Yes? - Laura. Scott, I'm driving. What's up? Valencia is screwed. What? They want another fifty million for the land. That's impossible! I've tried everything. Wait, I'll stop. God! What do we do? We'll have to find something else. We need sun and land that's worthless. Yes. Just a minute. Wait. I've got it. Another site? Where? <i>Don't do anything.</i> Don't speak to them yet. Give me three hours. We filmed "Flint's Gold" here in 1965. This set was built over what was once a real mine, from when they believed there was gold in Almeria. And now, <i>we've come to the cr√®me de la cr√®me.</i> The museum of the west! Here we have the treasures which the Americans left when they came to Spain to make their great films. This is the mythical sleigh from "Doctor Zhivago". Omar Sharif and Julia Christie rode in that. This is the saddle and the horse Babieca which Charlton Heston rode in "El Cid". And these are the saddles from the camels in "Lawrence of Arabia". Stop touching things, kid. Ma'am, tell your son to behave, these are relics. This is Clint Eastwood's authentic poncho. Smell it, ma'am. It smells of Clint. This is the poncho worn by Clint Eastwood in "A Fistful of Dollars". He never took it off a single day during the entire shoot. He lost three kilos, for not taking off the poncho. Here he is. The person at his side is your humble servant. I did everything that my friend Clint couldn't do. That's the stuntman's work. To do what the star can't or won't do. Watch closely. What do you think? The job is badly paid and not highly thought of, but it's full of honor and grandeur. Between us, between the stars and their double there is a splendid relationship. We, the stuntmen, are part of their success. But unfortunately we don't share their glory. Mr. Clint Eastwood is an international star and nobody knows me. That is why the great actors have a great respect for us and a great fondness which lasts a lifetime. This photo is a montage. It's been cut out and stuck on. Of course it is, ma'am! What do you think? That I'd ask my friend Clint to have his photo taken with me? He'd have thought I was doing it for money, not for friendship. Right, that's it. The visit's over. Back into the street. What about the Mexican village? Yeah, the Mexican village. Yeah, the Mexican village! Do I look like a Mexican? Come back another day. You think I'm going to show you the Mexican village for 10 fucking Euros? Go on, go down to the beach and have a swim. It's a great day. Juli√°n, do you hear me? No, no fucking chance. It wasn't now, was it? No, it was time for the museum. If you read the program you'd know. Take it easy. Since your grandson left, you. I don't give a shit about my grandson! You hear? I don't need anybody, you hear? There's Don Mariano. Good news. Here's this month's salary. It's only the 15th. Why are you being so generous? That's not all. Here's another month in advance. What's up? It's very simple. We're fired. I'm sorry, I got an offer I couldn't refuse. - You've sold the town? - This afternoon. It's impossible. - You can't do that! - I've done it. You don't like it? I can compensate you for wrongful dismissal. They've paid me so much I can let you have quite a bit. How much is that? At least 3,000 Euros each. 3,000 Euros? I've never seen that much all at once. 3,000 Euros. Just like that? Serve them whatever they want. It's on the house. Yeah, sure. Come on, Juli√°n. Cheer up, look. Yeah, let's celebrate. They're knocking our house down and paying us a pittance for our lives. That money won't last a year. It won't even last six months! You'll be back working as a waiter in his bar. The indians will be picking tomatoes. And the rest'll be unemployed. Let's drink to that. That's how it's going to be, right? Come on, who was it? A company from Madrid that wants to build a theme park. Think about it. They'll create jobs, build hotels and restaurants. It's good for the town. I'm talking as mayor, not as a businessman. You think we're assholes? They'll bring in outsiders, like always. We won't see a cent of it. <i>Ma che cazzo di merda.</i> I'm sorry, but I can't do anything. And neither can you. Juli√°n, where are you going? What are you going to do? He's going to town to buy cigarettes, to go to the club! <i>Carlitos, come down and eat!</i> I've made lamb, I know you like it. I don't want anything. What are you going to do? Stay in bed until you're 18? Holy Mother! What a pain! Hello, Roc√≠o. Hello, Juli√°n. My God, you look so old. And you look the same as ever. I knew it. I knew that some day you'd come and apologize. Slow down. I've come to talk to Laura. She's at work. You've come to see me. You've come to see me. Don't lie. Roc√≠o, please. The last time we talked I ended up in hospital. I should have aimed at your heart. But you aimed at my balls. It still hurts when I piss. Don't pretend. You can't live with the anguish that's eating you up, and you've come crawling back to apologize. But I'm sorry, It's too late. - Go on, call Carlos. - Over my dead body. Carlos, it's Juli√°n! Grandpa! Goodbye, Roc√≠o. I'm warning you. If he isn't here when his mother gets home, she'll kill me. But first, I'll rip off whatever is left hanging there. Got that? I love you too. Let's go, Carlos. We'll have 18 whiskies and 4 pasties. Give me a shot. What do you want? A Coca-Cola. What's that look for? Grandma says you drink too much. And she's right. Give me another. I didn't even feel that one. Leave the bottle, and save your feet. Christ! - That's me! - Who? Wait. Don't change the channel! Leave it! Do you see those tanks? This is where I appear now. That's me! That's an American actor! No, dickhead, I'm his double, I'm driving the jeep. His double. Yeah, Patton's double. Was it a war film? No it was a romance. For fuck's sake. - Who was Patton? - Patton? Patton was a guy with balls. Look. This is Africa. Rommel was here. And Patton was here. He was surrounded by nazis. But he wouldn't bow down to Hitler or any of his crew. But he escaped. And he fucking invaded Italy. Why are you taking that away? Leave Patton here and leave Rommel here. He was surrounded by nazis. But he managed it in the end. And do you know why? He didn't give up? Exactly! He didn't give up. That's the way. If they chose you, you must have been like him. Yeah. Yeah, years ago I was. I was like that. What about the land re-zoning? How's that coming along? Very well, they'll approve the. How are you? - Carlos, wait outside. - Can't I listen? All right. Fuck! This is some office they gave you. I want you to know I'm not here to cause you any problems. Go to hell. Listen, I. I'm here to make peace. I never wanted to take your son away. If he was with me for a day it was because he wanted. But it won't happen again. You come here with Carlos to tell me that? You think I'm stupid? <i>- Lola. - Yes?</i> <i>- Call a taxi. - Right away.</i> Wait a minute. I won't let Carlos come back to Almeria. If he does, I'll put him on a bus to Madrid. I don't want to interfere in your life. Please, don't destroy mine. Your western town. Is that it? It's all I've got. Juli√°n, this has got nothing to do with you. It's just business. The land where we want to build happens to be where you work. Bad luck. Your show is of no interest. People want something different. I've come to apologize, something I've never done. It's time you started. All right, you win. I won't see him again. But, please, don't destroy the town. Very touching. This company's aim is to make money. And this is a huge multi-national deal. It isn't my decision. I'm really sorry. Bad luck, kid. No more playing at cowboys and indians. What's going on? Here you are, Don Juli√°n. This time I don't want blanks. I want the kind that do damage. I can't, you need a license for that. Like this? Like this. Here you are. Going to test your aim? Sort of. I need more. Give me the lot you've got. - The lot? - The lot. 800 bullets. That's all I've got. I want to update the show. Something modern, you know. Like you see nowadays. So long, sideburns! They had to start there. You'll end up missing it. It's back to sweating under the plastic. You think we'll last in the greenhouses? We'll think about that when we've blown the 3,000 Euros! This letter was left in the bar. It's for you. - What was it? - A letter from Jacinta. Anything serious? Nah, she's left me forever. Lord above. She says I've got no personality. I always let myself be pulled along. You think she's right? Well. In a way, she is. What's going on? You! Move! Juli√°n, what the hell are you doing? Listen. Take it easy. Put down the rifle. Andr√©s, get out of town. You've gone crazy! Now I'm really pissed! Hold it right there! Now I do have bullets. Take his gun. Whatever you're up to, it's crazy. The police will be here in an hour. The national police. They won't be as nice to you as we are. Believe me. They can come when they want. I'm waiting for them. What the hell have you just done? What Patton would have done. Who's Patton? You know what that excavator is worth? - No, and I don't care. - Shit. I finally got El√≠as's gun. And I got Andr√©s's. We can't give them back now. This is resisting authority. Now we really are outlaws! Right, we're fugitives. Legendary fugitives. Scary, isn't it? THEY WERE HERE Sorry, you have to move. Our company owns the land. We want to speak to the person in charge. You won't talk to anybody. This is police business. Attention! This is the police. Come out with your hands up and nothing will happen. <i>Me va fan culo, faggot!</i> What did he say? They won't surrender, sir. All right, go ahead. Bring them out! Fire! Fire! Pull back! Pull back! Bastards! No one told us they were armed! Christ Almighty! How do you think they blew up the excavator? Those are real bullets. We've got one casualty already. They're pulling back, we held them off! This is going to end badly. Think about it a bit. Don't be such a pain! It's a crime now. They'll arrest all of us. Chief! Listen, chief! What's going on in there? Promise you'll do nothing to harm our company's name. What do you mean? You want us to get them out? Then shut up. This isn't a protest by immigrants. Those people are professionals. But there are tourists here, people are filming everything. This looks like a goddamn war! You want me to arrest them for looking? Medina, call headquarters and ask for reinforcements. Tell them this is out of control. <i>Our spaceship computer</i> <i>is suggesting a final alternative.</i> <i>What's happening in Almeria</i> <i>might seem like a western</i> <i>but this time it could have a dramatic ending.</i> <i>A group of workers</i> in the "Texas Hollywood" town <i>where the famous spaghetti westerns</i> <i>were shot years ago,</i> <i>are refusing to accept its closure.</i> Carlos! Your grandpa is on the TV! Go back! You can't get through! All these goddamn cameras! Take a look at that! They must have a huge budget! I told you my grandpa worked on the big films. This time I'm going to ask if they need people. - I don't understand it. - Shit! They all agreed, except Juli√°n. We should have offered more money. It's a bit late for that. Go for it! It all seems so real! Bastards! Hey, you lot! You fucking cops! Come and get me, you bastards! We can't back down now! If we stick together, we can hold out, like in Numancia! All we've got are the potato chips in the machine. They'll wait till we die of hunger and have to come out. We're done for, he's hungry! Cheyenne is right. Are we going to surrender just to fill his belly? Who mentioned surrender? We have to go out tonight to find supplies. Impossible. We're surrounded by all the cops in Almeria. It's crazy, and anyway I'm not hungry! We could dig a tunnel. Christ Almighty! You should be in Madrid! Now we've got the kid as well! - I'm on your side. - Our side? Just wait till this is over. And get down! Come on, get down. Get your head down. The kid suggested digging a tunnel! That would take weeks! A tunnel! Fucking great! If everyone says something stupid we might get lucky. Wait! The boy's right! Flint's mine! It's guarded. We're screwed. Hold it. Carlos, do what I told you. - What did you tell him? - Will you shut up! Why do you have to know everything? They'll catch him. This is crazy! Hey. What are we waiting for? Shit! Now! <i>- And the ragazzo? - He's coming.</i> Come on, what's keeping you? Shit! Hooligans! Turn off that shit! Juli! It's us! Weren't you trapped in the town? Yeah, but now we're here. Open the door. It is open. The door to the bar, not the house. What's going on? Nothing! Go back to sleep! Don Mariano has got the keys. Hooligans! Get out of here! Go on, you crowd of bastards! Shit! Fuck! Weren't you trapped in the town? No, ma'am, we weren't. Christ, everybody here knows everything. What the TV says is all a lie, like when they went to the moon. Mariano, wake up. Wake up! I seems Juli hasn't got the keys. So, come on, get up. Fuck! I work my whole life, and now you do this to me. It isn't fair. Do you want supplies to survive on, or do you want to eat my hams? Hello? <i>Operator.</i> I want to send a telegram. Leave those cigars alone. If I can't smoke I'll surrender. All right, take a box, but leave the bottles. This isn't a party. Jacinta Gonz√°lez, Garden Street, <i>- Three. - Yes.</i> <i>- Benidorm. - Benidorm.</i> <i>- The text, please. - The text?</i> Go to hell, you lousy bitch. You're a shameless whore. I never want to see you again. <i>- Frowzy bitch? - No, not frowzy, lousy.</i> <i>- Lousy bitch. - That's it.</i> <i>- What? - Anything else?</i> No, that'll do. <i>You can have another 3 words.</i> And it'll cost the same? <i>- That's right. - OK, put.</i> <i>- Slut. - Slut.</i> <i>- Slut. - Slut.</i> <i>Anything else?</i> <i>- Slut. - Slut. Is that right?</i> <i>Thank you for using our service.</i> Thank you. What are you doing? Are you robbing the bar? Not now, Juli. Leave us alone for a little while, will you, love? This is very serious. Your husband's lost his mind. You'll get me fired! You want us both thrown out? How will we pay the mortgage? Forget about the mortgage for once and get the hell out of here. Cheyenne, stop babbling and do something. And you, Juli, get out. You're like his lap-dog. I thought you were smarter. We've got no alternative. Take that sausage. He's brainwashed you. I do what I want. I'm a free agent. If you help me, I'll get you out of this. I can get out on my own. You think so? This is getting nasty. And those people have money. Wake up! If you help us out, they'll look out for you. You get what I mean? Here. I'll call you. Take it, it doesn't bite! Hell! Throw down your guns! What are you doing here? I'm off duty tonight. Throw down your guns! Juli, get out of the way! Don't you touch him. Shoot at me, if you dare! Why are you always in the way? I can't take any more. Shut up, I'm sick of this. You and your pals always acting so tough. Now what, eh? Now what, you asshole? That gun's from a Playstation. - What? - You can see the wire. I had to try, right? Go on. Go to bed. As for you. What are you doing? You really hurt me. I thought I'd knock him out. You nearly split my skull. They're hitting the mayor! Go to bed! I hope they kill you like dogs. Tie them to the fountain. We have to be careful. Don't worry, Matilde, it won't be for long. I saw you on the TV. I'm going to call the Civil Guard! Yes, call them. Let's get the hell out of here! Tie them up, quick. Matilde, if we're on TV again, tell your daughter to tape it. This is going to end badly! You'll be sorry! You'll be in jail tomorrow. <i>Ma va fan culo!</i> Bastards! Fire! Free bar! This round is on me! Fire! - How was that? - Very realistic. Flatten everything! Go for it! Get back! Don't shoot! Tell them not to shoot! They've got my son! Hold your fire! I repeat, hold your fire. This is a disaster! Good evening from the town of Texas Hollywood. The situation is very tense in Tabernas, Almeria, as a result of confrontations between the police and the former stuntmen who worked in the town and refuse to leave it. There is a lot of confusion about what is happening but we know that at least 20 people have been seriously injured. These people in no way represent the majority of the town, because we are decent people and the Town Council strongly condemns these incidents. It's been part of the town for years, they shouldn't knock it down. The western town is typical of this area. Don't take it away. Look at what they did to my taxi. Who's going to pay for that? Spielberg? Or Garci? Who the hell's going to pay? This tough guy from the north! Look at that! <i>I'd like to send this message</i> <i>to the workers in the town.</i> <i>I appreciate your situation.</i> <i>You've been fired</i> <i>and you're worried that</i> <i>the old town will disappear.</i> <i>But I want to make it clear</i> <i>that our company's intention</i> <i>is not to forget the past</i> <i>but to create a better future for everyone</i> <i>by building a new western town.</i> - What did she say? - She said a new town. <i>In this new town,</i> <i>more modern and better equipped,</i> <i>all the former workers</i> <i>will be guaranteed a new job</i> <i>and better wages.</i> <i>We don't know why your representative</i> <i>refused our offer of continuity.</i> Our representative? <i>But I can tell you this.</i> <i>The offer still stands.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> It's a trap. Don't you see? We'll be arrested and that offer will be forgotten. That's a lie! You met with her in Madrid. Everyone knows you're related. She's the kid's mother. You knew about the offer and you said nothing. Is that true, Juli√°n? Did you see them in Madrid? Yes. But there was no offer. It's a trap. She wants us to come out and this is the first step. Making us doubt each other. And it worked, because I don't understand anything. It's obvious. They offered Juli√°n a solution and he kept it quiet. Juli√°n, please, say it isn't true. You spoke to them and didn't tell us anything? It didn't concern you. It was between her and me. It didn't concern us? We've worked our guts out here! Who do we believe? A company that offers us work, or you, who goes around pretending you've worked with the big actors. I worked with the Americans. I've never seen you in any films. Because I'm a stuntman, idiot. My job is not to be seen. Yeah, and we have to believe you. Like always. Like with your son. What do you mean? That's a different matter. You know exactly what I'm talking about. It isn't the time to talk about that. Why not? It happened years ago, but you lied to everyone, like now. I said this isn't the time. You were drunk and you blew it. Shut up! The truth hurts, doesn't it? You weren't there. Everybody knows. You weren't there to back him up when he jumped. You were supposed to help him and you didn't. He jumped on his own and died under the horses' hooves. I'd had a drink, but I wasn't drunk! I didn't kill him. I didn't kill him. So why were you thrown off the film? Go on. Tell your grandson about the trial, and how you spent two years in jail. He said he was guilty. The lawyer said it was best. Since then, all you've done is get drunk! Now that your grandson is here and you can't look him in the eye, you prefer to destroy everything and be a hero. You want to die with your boots on so he'll think you're great. All right. But what does all of that have to do with us? Why do we have to get screwed because of you? Yes. It's for you. They're asking for our representative. Yes. All right. They're waiting outside. You can go if you want. Let's go. I feel as stupid as ever. Come on! I'm staying. I said you're to go, all of you. <i>Va fan culo.</i> I've always been late for everything. This time, I won't miss it. Even if it kills me. I'm staying, maestro. I always told you the truth. You said you weren't there when it happened. Well, it was a manner of speaking. I thought that you wouldn't understand. You lied to me! All right, I lied! I said anything just to get you to shut you up. Happy? Now you can clear off too. Get out, all of you! I don't need anyone, much less a goddamn kid who's fucked up my life! No, Carlos, don't go. I didn't mean that! I was somebody. I rode with the greatest. That isn't a lie. Show him the napkin. Carlos! That's right! The napkin! Wait! Look! What's that? It's Clint Eastwood's phone number. He gave it to me 40 years ago. Shall I call him? I'll call him. Juli√°n, don't bother now, call him another day. After all these years, he's probably moved house. Be quiet. They said that he isn't at home now. It's nighttime there. He'll be out for dinner. Who are you? - Sandra, she's a friend. - A friend. Juli√°n and the gravedigger aren't here. Your plan was no use. We have to take tougher action! - What's your idea? - To solve the problem. What did you promise him? Nothing, it was all his idea. Don't lie to me. I know your methods. What about yours? Didn't you promise them a new town that we're not going to build? I lied, but I don't want to kill anyone. This is getting out of control. The time has come. He's capable of anything. Of killing me or killing himself. But I know him. We've worked together for a long time and with God's help - maybe I can prevent it. - Don't listen, he's mad! What are you doing here? You're not going in there! Juli, for God's sake. And take off those things! Not in front of the TV! I don't care about the TV! Fuck it, Juli! Let me do something on my own for once in my life! He knows what he's doing. He's lost his mind! He's worse than the other one. Get out of here. Leave me alone! Take your hands off me! It's me! I'm coming in! They're going to kill each other. It's what they've always wanted. Was it all lies? What are you going to do to grandpa? Let's go. Let go of me! Put me down! Come on! It's the dust from the desert. It got in my eyes. The two of you are scared shitless! Why don't you come out and show your faces? Is this the town you want to preserve? A heap of old wood, just like you? Come out of there. You're pitiful. I don't talk to pigs. Now you're the one acting the fool. I thought you were going to make it harder for me. Bastard! You want me to kill you too, dickhead? Now you know who your goddamn coffin was for. Give me that toy pistol, you'll hurt yourselves. Juli√°n, stop messing around. Andr√©s, you're an interfering bastard. I don't need help to deal with a lousy waiter. I don't need anyone's help. Is this sun driving you all mad? I'm going to get a few years and I'm too old to go back to jail. Maybe, but I don't want you to kill each other. Drop your gun. I hope we're in time. I've knocked him out all right. Now we'll see who's scared shitless. It was all a trap. You came here like a friend, but you just wanted to betray me. You're a second-rater, kid. You'll never be able to replace me. You're too fat. Did you hear that, fatso? Shut up! Go away. Turn round and leave town, Cheyenne. We don't want you here. Tell the TV people whatever you want. You can still sell popcorn when they pull this down. What is it? Aren't you going to shoot? Or do your chubby fingers not fit around the trigger? You want me to come closer? Come on, bastard. Do a favor for a friend. For once in your life. Aren't you going to shoot, son of a bitch? I was a friend of your grandpa. I know.

Hello, gentlemen. - You're new here. - Yes. - Steak and fries. - Meat stew and fries. I'll have the herring and some fries. Let's get serious. Men, please. Today I suggest a butternut squash mousse with chestnut dominoes and tomato ravioli on oak leaf lettuce. Come with fries? It comes with beets √† la paprika, watercress soup with carrot foam and a dash of Azincourt vinegar. Who's this faggot? Beat it, you and your paprika crap! So Jacky? Finally buying your chef's outfit? Soon. Soon, you'll see. Sprinkle the beef with breadcrumbs and melted butter. Cloves. Orange rinds. How did work go? No, Jacky! Fired 4 times in 4 weeks! Soon there will be three of us! They don't understand me, at all. - See our overdraft? - Yeah, I know. - What is it? - I'm fine. You okay, baby? Are you sure? You have to stop working. And I'll find a way to get a job. - Any job. So you can relax. - Any job? First one I find. And I won't get fired. Hello, chef. It's nice to leave the ovens. - Is all well? - Delicious. - How was the sole? - Perfect. Do you like my onions confit? - Fit to be devoured. - Allow me. The perfect mouthful. I'll remember that. How do I eat? You stab it with a fork. Chef! - Excuse me. - Of course. You're legally bound to show Mr. Matter the menu. I have no time. He'll explain about the other restaurants. Later, Marion. It's no good. I feel no emotion. - Give me the vanilla. - Yes, chef. Taste it. Very good, chef. - Fantastic, chef. - Nonsense. Not for the Spring menu. I'm getting nowhere. Mr. Matter sent over a menu. He wants you to use it. He's starting to piss me off. Follow me. - Stop moping. - I'm not. You said you'd do anything. I said it and I'm doing it. - It's just for 6 months. - It'll whiz by. Have a good day. - I think I'll like it here. - Go on. All the windows need to be repainted. 524 all together. Next. the doors. 188. Great. - What are they eating? - No idea. Who cares? Your overalls. - Your equipment. Nice and fast. - Ok, thanks. Hello, ma'am. Jerusalem artichokes. Consomm√©. Squash gazpacho. This is a menu from the last century, Alexandre. We need ingredients to lower the prices of our frozen food and microwave meals. How am I concerned? You can help us get government approval. If Cargo Lagarde uses these ingredients, we'll get it. I am to put that crap in my food for your stockholders? My chemists say it's risk-free. Many big chefs work with the industry. - Think it over. - I already have. You see? You're out of place here. This is Cyril. Two stars in London and Paris. Come eat at my restaurant. Phosphorescent radish mousse, effervescent sirloin, and free-range chicken ice-cubes. Amazing! I'm giving Cargo Lagarde to Cyril. You'll take the Mimosa Farmhouse, in Orl√©ans. Look how pretty it is. A perfect setting for your hearty traditional cuisine. Cargo Lagarde bears my name. Your name is ours. We bought it. You cost too much. You're not profitable. I can't be fired, Stanislas. Reread my contract. This meeting is over. What? It's how it is. It's the times. No choice. Someone knocked. How are you doing the cod? - What does he want? - The cod! - How are you doing it? - We can't hear! What? You're boiling it. Use a double-boiler instead, 10 minutes tops. It loses its flavor otherwise. It becomes. Open the window. - How are you cooking it? - Boiled in salted water. Don't! It will be bland! - What are you doing? - Hold this. We can do better. So. I'm thinking, a concass√© of sea prince. with lemon mousse. They hate change here. They get nasty. They don't even know what they eat. Yesterday they mistook fish for chicken. If you listen to me, we'll reach the peak of culinary creation. That's not what we're after. What did you put in our plates? Concass√© of sea prince with a lemon mousse on an asparagus raft with rainbow polka-dot sauce. I don't like codfish. - Taste it first. - But I don't like it! At our age we know if we like something or not! - Only mashed potatoes! - No yellow stuff for me. The coffee is never hot enough! Get lost! Don't worry, Paint Boy. It's normal. I once put cheese in an omelet and I got bit! It's my fault. I see too big. People don't care about quality. Sorry, guys. You know what? Next time, give them mashed aspirin with Valium juice. They'll love it. I'll take the sage. <i>Live in 5 minutes. Just one leek.</i> My mother adores you. Can I have an autograph? Live in 2 minutes. I meant to say. I'm leaving Cargo Lagarde. What? To run Miroir de Paris in New York. I haven't decided yet. Stanislas Matter already signed me on. - I hope you'll forgive me. - You can't do this! I taught you what a paupiette was! Live in 1 minute. I couldn't refuse Miroir de Paris. But not now! Everyone is lying in wait for my fucking Spring menu. You remain in my heart and head. Screw your heart and your head! Hear me? Sorry but. I'm leaving too. Ten seconds. He named me to Coq de France in Dubai. - I'm sorry. - Are you all in on this? Welcome to my show, "Alexandre's Market". <i>Here I am, along with.</i> <i>my faithful assistants, Sergio</i> <i>and Akio.</i> - Did it start? - Just now. <i>Today,</i> <i>I'll teach you one of my favorite starters.</i> <i>In the cold of winter, when you're home.</i> Crazy how I'm hooked to this show. Same here. <i>To warm your heart, I suggest</i> <i>a leek soup</i> <i>with acacia honey.</i> - You can cook leeks with honey? - Sure! - You knew? - Who doesn't? Quiet! <i>Cut the leek into cubes.</i> <i>Just the white part.</i> <i>Yes, Akio. Like I taught you all these years by my side.</i> He's acting weird. <i>Before the onions brown, add the leeks.</i> He never used onions. It means. he has worries. Something with work or a woman. - Know him? - By heart. I used to steal his books and offer them to myself. Having fun? How long can one window take? - I forgot my brush. - There's another wing. Okay. I'll just be a sec. - See you later. - See you. I was just. touching up. You can't get away for two weeks? I need a second-in-command. Dad, I got the date for my thesis! You know anyone who may be available? I already tried him. So no one. Honey, you're home! I just spoke to you in there. I know you spoke to me in there! What did I say? It was about something. - Are you coming? - Of course I am. Where? My thesis defense. What's it about? Russian fantastic literature and the 19th century novel. We have more and more Russians at the restaurant. Great. You going? I'm working. It wasn't planned. Are you upset? I figured. Canceling is your thing. No big deal. Come on, not another hamburger. It's Miss Lagarde. I'd like a double cheese and a Coke. Thanks. Goodbye. Have a good night, Dad! Jacky, we want food! We want the same thing as yesterday! We want Jacky's food! - I have trouble with your son. - How so? He wants me to use gelling agents, chemical shit. I see. Taste this. I'm in deep shit, Paul. I have no inspiration. Same thing every year. You think you'll lose a star. Just taste. What is it? Incredible. That's the word. My red mullet and pumpkin recipe from 1996! Exactly. It's wild. It's all there. The balance of vegetables, the harmony of spices. Everything! Who made this? See that painter there? The painter? Excuse me, can we talk a bit? Is it you who made my recipe for mullet and pumpkin from '96? No, '97. In '96 it was St.Pierre and potato mousseline. - Are you sure? - You bet! For me, that recipe was like Michelangelo's David. Interesting analogy. I need a second-in-command. Would you work on a trial basis at Cargo Lagarde? But I'll get a contract? - A trial. Then we'll see. - How long? Whatever the law says. One month, two. I'm sorry. I can't. I have a 6-month contract here. My wife is pregnant. - She'll understand. - No, she won't. You can't say no to Cargo Lagarde! Are you a total idiot? No, sir. I love my wife. That's all. You're all starting to piss me off. Big time! Mr. Lagarde, wait! I accept your offer. Fine. Tomorrow at 8 at the Cargo. You're right. I'll tell my wife the truth. Of course. she'll understand that I left. a paid job for an unpaid internship. - What's that? - They're flowers. - Why are you here? - To pick you up. I like knowing you can count on me now. - You got fired? - Not at all. Something serious. Do you want them or not? Of course I do. You carry them. I'm a little pregnant. Guess what happened. I knew there was something. Yeah, there was something. Guess who congratulated me. Who? Alexandre. The manager of the old-age facility. He says I paint fast. He wants me to do the whole place. Zeroing in on the kitchen? You're crazy. The kitchen is miles away! Stop it! Alexandre! Stop this! Mr. Matter sent us! Next time I'll throw you in the meat locker! - Morning, chef. - You're late. - It's 8:02. - That's what I said. You're late! Janine! Embroider his initials. - Of course. - It's Jacky Bonnot. Hold on. Only normal. "I wanted to say, chef, I am aware of the chance you're giving me." "Indeed, as a mere child, your recipes were like beads in a necklace." See you in the kitchen. Okay. I'll be right there. That's Marcel Bouchard. - Here. - Thanks. This apron and I have a long life ahead. Start by not getting fired today. Everyone, your attention please. Taste this and tell me what's in it. - Blindfolded? - This isn't a music hall. So. Roasted turbot. With a spinach coulis. The sauce is. tomato and olive. Daikon radish, salted butter. I'd have added a pinch more salt. Very good. What does that smell like? Confit of grilled beef. Vintage Select Beef, excellent choice. Zucchini and potatoes. Lady Christels, excellent texture. They stay firm in boiling water. A little grilled eggplant. Over-grilled. Way over-grilled, if I may. He's right. This eggplant is over-grilled. Who made this? I did. I've told you. Eggplants are touchy. Don't hurt them. Look them straight in the eye. I looked it in the eye! - Toss it. - Yes, chef. Obviously, you'd never have done that. No, chef. I'd have heard the eggplant scream. Jacky is the vegetable whisperer. And listener. That's important. What's this carrot saying? Grate me. It wants to be grated. - Grate it. - Yes, chef. For the St. Pierre. Jacky will watch you work today. Tomorrow, he'll run both services. - Get to work. - Yes, chef! So I'm hired, chef? Wait until rush hour. Many a man returns his apron. - Not Jacky Bonnot. - We'll see. What's this? Sweetbread, scallops, vanilla. Forget that. I do the creating. I was thinking. Got it. I feel so good. Touch. Our baby is relaxed too. It's thanks to the new Jacky. New Jacky.. Don't go overboard. I meant to tell you. I quit my job. I've been with Alexandre Lagarde for 3 days. It's an internship, so unpaid for the moment. Sorry, I'm half asleep. What did you say? Goodnight, my new Jacky. - How is it? - Full, chef. - Where are the langoustines? - Coming, chef! The chicken should be ready by now! I still need my piccatas! I'll get them. - Sorry. - My fault. - Careful with my piccatas! - Make another piccata! Do the langoustine for table 4. I'll do the piccata. It's not your job. Check the chicken. Look! It's not enough chicken. You want Jerome to get yelled at? Add more. Clean this up, please. Piccata, now. Behind you! Good work, Jacky. Nice first week at the Cargo. Thanks, chef. Mr. Lagarde! I love your lemon chicken! But you should use more lemon. Add it yourself! Sure. I hadn't thought of that! <i>Live in 5 minutes.</i> Where are we going? To the set. To shoot my show. No way! I can't do a TV show. What if my wife sees? She works. She won't be watching TV. What if my in-laws watch? Can you call me Brian while shooting? Welcome to my show, "Alexandre's Market". I'm happy to introduce you to my new assistant. This is. - Brian. - Brian. Brian, this week we'll make veal navarin with spring vegetables. The navarin from your 1999 menu at the Inn in Uz√®s? - Exactly. - Excellent. - As you can see, Jacky. - Brian. Brian is the living memory of French gastronomy. - Why the sunglasses? - So no one recognizes him. Why go on TV in that case? To be recognized but. incognito. <i>We cut the veal flanks into nice chunks.</i> <i>In the meantime, I, Brian, peel the carrots.</i> - Why Brian? - His American name. <i>Cut these chives.</i> What? You're using chives? Your recipe calls for tarragon! We're shooting live. Jacky's a real clown. Not Jacky. Brian. I take your navarin very seriously. So no chives. Let's use. some thyme! We won't use thyme! Don't alter your masterpiece! Is this a real fight? - Thanks Brian. You can go. - I want to taste the navarin. - Better without chives or thyme. - Shut up. Ladies and gentlemen, bon app√©tit. See you next week. A bit of tarragon would have helped. Shut your trap. I'm making a navarin tonight. Thank you. - Never again. - I defended your recipe. Alexandre, that was wonderful! That was some routine, you two! I reread your contract. I know how to fire you from Cargo Lagarde. If you lose one star, you're fired. I'll never lose one. I know all the owners of the guides. Two critics are going to Cargo Lagarde soon. Tough luck. They don't like your cuisine. I'm not sure you'll keep your three stars. I almost forgot. If you lose Cargo, you lose your apartment. It's ours. Bye, Alexandre. Have fun you two! - Chin up. It'll be fine. - What are you doing? - Comforting you. - Comforting me? Because. - Get to work and keep quiet. - Yes, chef. Goodbye, chef. Stanislas Matter came to see all the suppliers. If we sell to you, he won't buy from us. That bastard. What do I do now? Don't worry. I'll never forget your aid. I'll help you. Thanks, Marco. What a friend! Julien! This is Julien. He'll be doing the shopping for us. This is Marco. Thibault, come here. Add cinnamon and a lotus leaf to the lamb sauce. - We can't change his recipes. - They're his creations. He gave me carte blanche. - But I can't! - It'll be great. Come here. - Do it. - He'll be furious! - He'll fire him. - Little prick. Good idea. I'll do it. I have two people at table 8. Critics, I think. Not eating, just tasting. They ask questions. They ordered the lamb. And? Your second-in-command changed the recipe. What? You're going to pay for this. There they are. How's everything? Mr. Lagarde, it's delicious. I tried your lamb once before and.. And? Brilliant idea to have added cinnamon. Cinnamon? I thought the cinnamon might make for an interesting twist. There's another flavor too. I can't put my finger on it. - He won't say. - No. he won't say. - Lotus, right? - Lotus, bravo. I like some conflict in the flavors. It's crazy. What people in Paris say about you. "He repeats himself." "Just a businessman." They're mean. You're still the best. - Tops! - Thank you, thank you. Alexandre. if I may. I've heard that critics from Le Guide are coming the day you introduce your new menu. April 12th, I think. Le Guide? Thanks for telling me. Busseron and Marchal. They hate classic cuisine. If I may be so bold: make them a molecular dish. With liquid nitrogen. Transparent. - It's their thing. - Molecular cuisine? Not that. What the hell is this? Cinnamon? Lotus? You're changing my recipes? You served the same sauce with filet mignon at the Tokyo Four Seasons. It had cinnamon! But you can't compare lamb and venison! I was interpreting you. I tied a new Alexandre dish to an old Alexandre sauce. Alexandre says to stop making connections between Alexandre and Alexandre! Understand? Excuse me, but I know how Alexandre works. - But I'm Alexandre! - So? How does that matter? I've followed Alexandre since day one. You want the truth? Alexandre was better before Charlotte left. Charlotte? My ex-wife? Why drag her into this? Since she left, your sauces are stagnant. No one says it, but. you're in a sauce rut. Leave Charlotte out of my veal stock! This is over. I'm fed up. - Get lost! - What? You're firing me? Yes! End of apprenticeship. Okay. No problem. Want inspiration for sweetbread and scallops? I know what Alexandre would have done. I do the creating here! Goodbye, Mr. Lagarde. - Keep scrubbing! - Yes, chef! Mr. Bonnot? Chef asks how Alexandre would do the sweetbread. Deglazed, with elberberry vinegar. Deglazed, elberberry. He wants you to come. Not too soon. The elderberry vinegar now. Why the dumb smile? The first time I've ever been rehired. Go on. - You're right, you idiot. - You bet. Okay. We'll do the menu together, but. You can be a real dipshit too! I'm sorry, Alexandre. I'm on the phone. Chang, farfalle are done al dente. Yours are overcooked! <i>Okay. I didn't know.</i> Start over. Let it boil 9 minutes. And remember, stir, stir, stir. - What's this? - I'm helping at the old-age home. So at lunch you were working both jobs? The residents love my recipes. I couldn't just vanish. I come in peace. I want no trouble. I'm just showing my restaurant to Cyril and his decorator. Leave my kitchen. Very well. This is Mr. Laveine, court bailiff. He'll tell you I can visit without danger, my restaurant to have it redone. If you lose a star. Of course. - This goes, Mr. Matter? - All of it. And that will be polished ceramic. Lose the wall, open it up. The customers eat here and there. Here I want a large table-screen. Scallops? Good idea. Find the recipe in Elle? It's about time I see to the Cargo. So, Cyril, come with me. Come see the winter garden. We'll lose the doors. We need space. Too old-fashioned! - Can you lose a star? - It can happen. Let's get back to work. <i>Jacky! I burnt the lemon sauce.</i> Get another pan and start over. <i>Beatrice called here. She couldn't reach you.</i> <i>She has baby stuff to show you.</i> Oh yeah? I'll call her back. I'm looking for Jacky. He quit here a while ago. Really? - Go ask in the kitchen. - The kitchen? <i>First, let the soy beans marinate in the lemon.</i> I was told I'd find Jacky here. He quit. What's it about? - Where is he? - Don't tell his wife! On the screen. - And you are.? - His wife. She's coming? So we better watch out. - I'm his wife. - Oh. shit. What did you tell Beatrice? About your hookers. Cut it out. I said you had 10 minutes of errands to do. Are you stupid? How do I get back there now? I have to call her and find an excuse! Jacky watch out! Just a sec. My wife has the same ringtone. - Hey, baby. - Yeah? - You okay? - Yeah. I'm just calling to say don't bother coming by work. <i>I won't make it. I'm stuck in traffic.</i> - Where? - Not even that far. By Nation. I'm near Nation too. Where exactly? You can't see me. I'm on the left. <i>stuck behind some trucks.</i> Hold on. Move! I have to work too! Let me through! I'm sorry. It's starting to move. I'm at Boulevard Voltaire. I hear an echo. <i>Why do I see you there?</i> - Where are you? - Jacky, your wife's here. - Why do this? - Do what? I did nothing. Right. You think I'm an idiot. - I'm sick of this. It's over. - Beatrice, wait! Listen! Chang, do something! - He didn't go to see hookers! - Not that! <i>Honey, listen to me. You can't leave like this!</i> <i>You're in deep shit.</i> Your boy's a real champ. With him it'll be shooting stars. They pass by. They don't stay. They just shoot on by. So long, stars. Answering machine again. She's not home. Stop calling. It won't get her back. That's not it. I lied to her. She'll never forgive me. - I know her. - They're all the same. They want to marry a great man but at the first screw up. they're gone. You know what? She mentioned marriage a lot and each time like an idiot I said "not now". So? What do you think? - It's flat. - Yeah. Have you ever tasted a Cheval Blanc? Nope. Cheval Blanc '61 . Just wonderful. He doesn't know everything, Mr. Elderberry Vinegar. Taste this. Check out the color. Smell that bouquet. It brings tears to my eyes, a Cheval Blanc. Me too. My eyes are welling up. The critics come in 4 days. I'm cooked. Why do you say that? It'll be another triumph. They're disciples of molecular cuisine. - Molecular cuisine? - Goodbye, 3rd star. Ever tasted a Petrus? Neither. - And the Cheval Blanc? - Later! I've got it! I know someone. A Spanish specialist in miocailulaire cuisine. He's our man. The best. Is he well-known? I was told he's a genius. I'll call him. Juan Castella. I still have his number. Answering machine. Hello, Juan. This is Jacky Bonnot. I'm working now with Mr. Alexandre Lagarde. I think we need your skills. Call me back. 'As fastas as possiblo'. Thank you very much. Thank you for what you're doing for me. It's an honor. If ever I keep the three stars, you'll be second-in-command. Really? - I'd prefer. - Shake. ."right-hand man." "First assistant" isn't bad either. Okay, first assistant. Is "deputy chef" better? It sounds. - Will you shake? - Sorry. - Let's have some Armagnac. - Sure! She's in Nevers! I'll go ask her to marry me. Beatrice went to her parents house in Nevers. I'm abandoning you. I can't live without her. I understand. Let me drive you there. So. first, tell her we're signing a contract. I'll manage. I go, I talk, she falls into in my arms. Just kidding. I'll just pave the way. <i>Neat place, Nevers!</i> <i>It's here. Turn up ahead.</i> If they're not home, they're here. Let's go. This way. That's her. But she's beautiful! Duh! Follow me. What? I don't have a ring! - We can't go empty-handed. - What do I do? I'll whip up something she likes. She'll forgive me. Get rid of this. Next. Jacky, why are you here? Hello, Carole. It's a surprise for Beatrice. Please don't say a word. You're at home here. This is Alexandre Lagarde. Alexandre, Carole, the owner. Mr. Lagarde. it's an honor. The honor is mine. What a coincidence. My cook leaves next month. If you want, you can take me on a trial basis. You're too pricey for me. Didn't we come for Beatrice? Yes. Beatrice, yes. Sorry to intrude. Let me introduce myself.. You're Alexandre Lagarde. That's right. That's me. Beatrice, listen, I'm here to say it's all my fault. I brought about this situation. Thanks for coming. But I know it's not you. Tell Jacky I won't see him. Don't say that. He has to tell you something. I won't listen! I have to tell you that if all goes well, he'll work full-time at Cargo Lagarde. He wants to hire Jacky! A future father mustn't lie. He's irresponsible. - That's true. - And unbearable! True. I even fired him. Weren't you supposed to defend me? Why are you here? Hello, Armand. Hello, Mathilde. Honey, I'm sorry. Forgive me. Look what I made. Your favorite. Caramel mille-feuille, tiny strawberries, redcurrants, tiny pistachios. - I don't want it. You do! Look! I made you a vanilla sugar heart. Know why? I love you. Vanilla sugar won't work! Let me make of the most of your parents presence to ask you solemnly if you'll marry me. Not like this! Not now! - Why not? - You lied to me! Okay, I lied to you. No big deal. I never lied before. Once. But that didn't count. We weren't really together. I don't think it's time to propose. - We should be going. - Sure, let's go. I know it's not the right time. How do I stop candied fruit from sinking into the batter? Add the fruit to whipped batter and keep on beating. Thank you, Mr. Lagarde. There's another school. Put the batter in the fridge and the next day, just add the candied fruit. - So did it work? - Goodnight, Carole. It's all fine. She loves him. - Your name is Carole? - That's right. - I'm Alexandre. - I know. - I may accept that offer. - Of course. See you soon. She's pretty. I know. Not Beatrice. Carole. I mean. they're both pretty. But Carole. You have cream on you. Not even enough praline. Make yourself at home. The Toque d'Or, your first trophy. And this is the. Good night. See you tomorrow. Hey, baby. It's me again. I know I should stop calling. but I can't. So. call me back. - Still working? - I have to be ready. This time I'm going to lose a star. 2, 3, same thing. But come for my thesis. I may lose a star and you blab on about Russian books no one reads. Go tell the rest of the world, no more scrambled eggs with truffles. See how they cry. - How can you be so selfish? - You taught me. I was never around. But I made lots of people happy. Yeah, other people. It's always about your restaurants. I'll let you work. I don't care. Besides working at the Home, I don't see how they're qualified. Chang did make-up at Crazy Horse. Moussa drove trucks. And Titi used to lay tiles. What should I do with them? We need a crew here. And guinea pigs to try the first samples. Got health coverage? That's him. I'll go answer. Alexandre, this is Juan Castella, world-famous specialist. - Can I say "world-famous"? - You can. .in molecular cuisine. Good day, Se√±or Alejandro Lagarde. I am very honored. So am I. First of all, I will taste your "cousin-e". My cousin? What is it? Beef with seaweed a surf and turf. Straight to problem, Se√±or Lagarde. Let's get to work. Pluck them. Where did you get them? Wild ducks. From woods near Paris. Woods near Paris? Pluck them. Now. More duck? More, more. Much more, much more. I am happy. Look. Where are the ducks? I undertook fragmentation of duck and reconstituted taste, into little cube. I should serve this? He's not finished. Now he'll work on. Artistic aspect. The color. The sauces. The crunchiness. Moussa, Titi, Chang! Come have a look. Can you three. taste this? - Duck with quince cracker. - Where? - There. - The cheese cubes? - Duck and quince cracker. Quince and quacker? You put the quacking in the cube? How did you do it? It's time to taste it. - Is that normal? - I take notes. Too much liquid nitrogen. Reduce by 15 grams. - Should we stop chewing? - Not yet. Continue. So? It's like a powdered duck that takes shape inside. It tastes fishy. It's true. You made fish with duck! Must be problem with condenser. I have to go check. Taste, Se√±or Lagarde. The true essence of duck. Not at all. lt's. raspberry. Continue. Continue eating. What the hell? Don't worry, Se√±or Lagarde. Normal chemical reaction. What do you mean, normal? Enough bullshit! So no more magic food? No, no more magic food! You, very hypersensitive. Me leave! That's right. Goodbye! I've had enough. No more ducks in cubes! 20 years of pressure just to please three critics! I'm calling it quits. You promised me a job contract. We have two days to invent a menu that's still a mystery! It's not possible! And Cyril Boss? He manages fine. How does he do it? Why don't we go eat there? We'll check it out. we'll taste, understand, analyze. - And we reinvent. - Everyone knows me. I call and say: "Table for two for Lagarde"? "For dinner?" "No, for spying!" Nonsense. - There's no solution? - I don't see one. - Chef? - What? Chang. He was a make-up artist. And? Mr. and Mrs. Nobushi. We're honored to welcome the cultural attach√©. Tonight we have our new menu. This way. <i>The chef Cyril Boss welcomes you.</i> Imagine. - They'll do this to Cargo Lagarde. - Disaster. Your table. Enjoy your evening. <i>The chef Cyril Boss proposes his Symphonic Menu.</i> Liquid nitrogen champagne. What is this thing? How does it taste? Champagne with cigar juice. Compression of fowl with udon noodles? Phosphorescent radish mousse. - Sweetbread spaghetti. - Virtual calamari. Do you eat it virtually too? Please try some wine. Essence of Pomerol. Without wine. No grapes, no alcohol. What's in it then? We can't say. Very, very mysterious! Mizuko likes to be silly. I'll keep it on ice. Who wants non-alcoholic wine? It's woody. I taste the idea of Pomerol. - And redcurrant. - And leather. I taste leather. <i>Sheep milk cheese with seasonal fruits.</i> <i>Tuna belly with tomato.</i> <i>Caramelized leek with lemon grass.</i> What the. <i>Beef and veal in their garden.</i> Sniff these while biting into your beef. Not practical. You have to take it. Not practical either. <i>Cyril Boss wishes you bon app√©tit.</i> I can't get it. This is interesting. It's bitter. Sweetbreads. Sweetbread spaghetti. We have to copy this. Your Excellency. - Enjoying it? - Wife like lots. Yes. very much Excuse me, Excellency. You've eaten here before! First time. I feel as if I've seen you before. First time. We to come. very far. Osaka, Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto, Hokkaido. I'm sure I've seen your face. Are you fans of gastronomic dining? We to love very much. fine dining. Where do you go? Ducasse. Robuchon. Gagnaire. Alexandre Lagarde. He totally sucks! You wrong. We to eat very well at Cargo Lagarde. Come on. Between us. Lagarde still makes beef stew. What's more - I'll tell you a secret - he hired an assistant, a bum who used to sell gyros. Shish kebab boy! A total loser! You enough. No respect. In Japan, Monsieur Lagarde restaurant ichiban! - Great insult. - Number one! You, Cyril Boss. nothing at all! The food critics want to see you. Okay. I'm coming. I'll be right back. Probably for some more compliments. We better go or I'll clobber him. - In the face. - Let's go. Wait. First, let's borrow a few ingredients. Very nice digestive dance! - It went well. - I'm loaded. Leaving? No strawberry √©clair in a test tube? - No, we go. - Yes, sick. I'll see you soon at Cargo Lagarde. I'm the new chef there. If you mention Cargo Lagarde again, know where I put your test tubes? - No. - Better you don't know. <i>The chef Cyril Boss thanks you for coming.</i> Bring in the food. Explosion of beef with ginger! Why are you screaming? Because it's classier. No one screams in 3-star restaurants. How would I know? Bone marrow on toast, vitrified in squid ink. Don't scream. - But Titi told me to. - Titi got it all wrong. So I don't scream either? - Tomato and cucumber in their froth. - What? Tomato and cucumber in their froth. Thank you. I said it softly. So, chef? - It's not bad. - Not bad? - I wake up in 4 hours. - Honey, I'm sorry. It's the Spring Menu. I have the critics tomorrow. Tomorrow. You're not coming? Where? Behave yourselves! Send in the rest. - Thank you. - Jacky's right. His method is better than Lagarde's. Fruit in every bite! Stop making that kid suffer. He's such a good cook. He drove 200 kilometers to ask your hand in marriage. Admire the elegance of this cake. I was too tough on him? Honestly. What is it? Please take me to the clinic. Right away, honey. I'll take a slice for the ride. Why not two? I'm coming. Amandine? Quiet, my daughter is sleeping! Don't scuff the walls! I'll get it. No, I'll help you. That's the last of it. I'll climb in. Hurry. Don't be late. You're not coming? You're the one who's right. Without love, we're nothing. What do I do? Why are you here? You can't take a test on an empty stomach! I made you a very intense hot chocolate. Sit down. I'll serve you. Remember? We called it "brioche √† l'Amandine". You'd make me one for every exam. Back then I cooked for pleasure. Then I became the guy with all the 3-star restaurants. I forgot what I loved most. You and. cooking. Where are they? I must see you tell the jury Balzac stole from Cossaks for "The Magic Skin". You read my thesis? - You read my thesis? - Eat. You read it? Three stars. What's wrong? Why is nothing ready? Marco stopped selling to us. It was too late. Just wilted vegetables. The kind. you can't whisper to. What? I'm looking for Alexandre. He's not here. He'll be here later. Will you tell him to call me? Would you like to work with me? No thank you. Alexandre trusts me, and I'd. You're too pure, Jacky. Think about yourself. Alexandre insists on living in a bygone era. I don't agree at all. He's still the best. And I'll be second-in-command. If he keeps his three stars. But what will you do without him and nothing to cook? Grilled cheese? You overestimate yourself. You can only fail. Maybe. But I want to try. Try what? You think you're a chef because you follow recipes? You're not! You're an amateur! And this place is for professionals. Have you ever invented something? Eggs mimosa or tiramisu? Was that you? You're a copycat. Just a guy who sings karaoke. That's all. So go home. Mr. Bonnot. Okay. What do we do? Nothing. No vegetables, no ideas, no Alexandre. - We're here. - That's nice, but so what? Stanislas is right. I just sing karaoke. I should have stayed a painter. Beatrice would never have left. - I'll go find her. - What? Is that all? We left our jobs for you and you bail. - You'll put us on unemployment. - You promised us. I'm sorry. That guy was right. You're not professional. You cook for pleasure. Professionals do it for others. I wasn't laying tiles for pleasure, but so people's floors were even. Phone call, sir. - Alexandre? - No, a woman. Thank you. - It's me. - Oh baby. I'm happy to hear from you. I'm so upset with myself. I lied and I shouldn't have. And for nothing. - We got screwed. - How so? Critics are here and we have no food. I'm sure it'll be fine. It's how you cook best. This time there's really nothing. I'm calling it quits. Now I know. Cooking is not for me. You and your excuses! Go all the way for once. <i>How else can you know your worth?</i> What you cook for me is so amazing. Your saving grace. Obviously for you it was because I love you. Imagine you're cooking for me. And your daughter. Really? I have a daughter? I'm coming. Finish what you have to do first. Are you sure? Don't worry. We're waiting. See you soon. Is there a supermarket nearby? Just a grocery at the corner. Start getting ready. Turn on the stoves. Titi, boil water. Moussa, Chang, let's go. Come with me too. You there, come along. Guys. I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy! Some vegetables? Nice tomatoes? Give me everything. I'll take it all. Vegetables, fruit, onions, tomatoes, artichokes pineapples, pasta, rice, flour, eggs, cheese. The whole store. - Did God send you? - He sure did! Don't let them scare you. The lemon juice is for your voice. Okay, Dad. It's my exam, not yours. Breakfast will give you energy. - Don't overdo it. - Am I? You're becoming a helicopter dad. Wrong. Your sweater. It's cold. I'll park first. This is for broths and stocks. - Chang, peel carrots. - Right away. Moussa, chop onions. Titi, blanch the vegetables. An hour and a half to invent a new menu! An hour and a half. It's impossible! But we'll give it a try, okay? We regret your not mentioning Anastasila Vladimrovna. Thank you, but I felt it was irrelevant in a chapter on Dostoyevsky. Gerard, I can't talk. What? That bastard Marco said he'd deliver the vegetables! I'm coming. Excuse me. I'm sorry, madam, but. Sorry to disappoint. I have to go. Trouble in the restaurant. That was great work. I didn't get it all, but I liked it. I'm very proud of you. I'm sorry but. Isn't she great? I'm off. - Papa? - What, what? Thanks. For breakfast this morning? It was nice. See you later. Let's continue, Miss Lagarde. Yeah, Alexandre had a great reign, but he hasn't evolved. His cuisine is pre-historical. I'll keep quiet. I don't want to influence you. The menu. So? What has he prepared for us? - Alexandre! - Paul. you came. I've never missed any of your new menus. Your painter did the Spring menu. Where did he find the vegetables? The corner grocer. We're dead. You must call Alexandre Lagarde. It's incredible. We want to congratulate him. I don't remember him capable of such subtlety allied with such modernity. How does he put so much emotion in this? It's like a woman hugged me, threw me in a tub, sponged me down with warm water, then. Not you? I expected as much from Alexandre. I know that he's constantly badmouthed but for me he's always been the best. Always. It's true. Alexandre, it's Stanislas. Call me back. The critics want to see Alexandre but I can't reach him. I'm going back out. Tell them he's busy working. These recipes are magnificent. Start the calamar, now! Part traditional, part molecular! I'm floored! How did he come up with it? I'm floored! They'll invent a 4th star for him! You were here? - You too, Mr. Matter? - Can I taste? - Dad, I didn't know you came. - You didn't have to. Everything from the grocery? All I could get my hands on. Did you hear? I think you won! I am so, so happy to see you. Go on, they're waiting. It'll be a triumph. There was some tension between us recently, but all that's over now. I want you to stay at Cargo Lagarde. I insist. I'll announce you. I think the time has come. Hold on. What are you doing? Follow me. Ladies and gentlemen, you enjoyed my Spring menu. And I thank you. But. I wasn't here earlier. I watched my daughter defend her thesis. She passed with honors. Thanks for her. Hello to the critics from Le Guide, here incognito. Not at all. Jacky, come here. Come. Ladies and gentlemen, Jacky Bonnot. He created the Spring menu. Thanks, chef. He is the new chef at Cargo Lagarde. Isn't he, Stanislas? Umm. yes. I was looking for a successor. And I found him. This is why I'm telling you. I'm done chasing stars. What will you do? You'll know soon enough. - Congratulations. - Thanks, chef. Good luck. Thank you all. Your mille-feuille was great. Here, give this to Beatrice. It'll go over better this time. Jacky Bonnot is my secret weapon. Gentlemen, I said I had a surprise. It's Jacky Bonnot! - Come here. - Yeah, Dad. We skipped too many steps. Before you take over the group, learn to appreciate product quality. Fine. What were you thinking? We'll find something. - Mr. Matter? - Yes, my friend? - Can I have a job contract? - Now? I need a signed contract, right away. - Do what he wants! - Sure. We'll sign you on. - Right away. - Write him a check too. I'll write you a check. - Okay? - Fine with me! Great timing. I just become a dad. Wonderful! I'm late. I have to go to Nevers to see my baby. Give him your car too. Give him your car! I'd like that. - Is there gas? - Yeah. <i>Haute cuisine will never be the same.</i> <i>Alexandre Lagarde has given up "the star system".</i> <i>His crew now works</i> <i>for a young chef, a newcomer.</i> <i>We tried in vain to find out more.</i> <i>Sir, can you tell us</i> <i>about this mysterious new chef?</i> - Hello, Jackie. - Hello, Antoine. - Buying your chef's outfit? - Yes! And twenty of those for my crew. They'll call. I thought I'd tell you. So long, Antoine! <i>.Jacky Bonnot, young culinary genius.</i> - You're the father? - Yes, I am. Congratulations. It's all about teamwork. I owe it to my crew. You meant.? No, for that I was all alone. When can I make her boeuf bourguignon? Two or three years. - Why so long? - She's a baby. Have you been here long? She's so beautiful. Did it all go well? A job contract. Excellent. - I have to tell you. - I have to tell you too. So you'll be my wife? Propose for real. This is all so lame. Propose for real? Like. Beatrice, my love, will you be my wife? I do! Hold on. Just tell me. When was the first lie? Why weren't we technically together? Technically I can't remember too well. Hello, everyone. Welcome to our new show, which is now weekly - Alexandre's Cuisine. - And Jacky's. Jacky, give us food! <i>For our first show, we're starting off with a classic.</i> Grilled c√¥te de boeuf. - Today is a big day. - Sure is! Today, Le Guide came out and thanks to Jacky, Cargo Lagarde kept its 3 stars. Thank you very much. You kept your 3 stars for fifteen years thanks to your extraordinary skills. You're no longer at Cargo Lagarde. Why did you go and become a cook in Nevers? Neat place, Nevers! Here we have some neat images of you cooking in your new restaurant. For you. Enjoy your lunch. And here I am. with Carole. <i>She runs the place.</i> We decided to work amid everyone. And I'm starting. to feel young again. Look how nice this is. I think this meat is almost ready. - And look what I brought. - Rosemary? - Delicious. - What is it for? - The c√¥te de boeuf. - No way. - Why not? - No rosemary on rib roast! You kidding? I will not let you ruin this roast! There's juice and butter. That's what counts. - Remember we're live. - I'll say it live. - Give me the meat. - No! It'll mask the flavor. Come here. No rosemary on c√¥te de boeuf. Come back! Where are you going? I'd rather drown it than use rosemary. Just a little rosemary! Why not some thyme too? And chives! Cut. Quack, quack. Quack, quack. <i>Cut. End-slate.</i> Take it, brother. Let me break you. Man, that was funky. -Fore! -Well, I guess the meeting's started. -Howdy, sir? -Mahoney! Jones! Thank you, Sweetchuck. I've had the most wonderful news about my new program. -What new program is that, sir? -My citizens on patrol. I call it C.O.P. for short. Has a nice policey ring to it, don't you think? What is C.O.P., sir? What is the most frustrating thing about police work? -Not being able to carry hand grenades. -Separate locker rooms, sir. Icky blue uniforms. I always thought that the most frustrating thing was that. we couldn't be everywhere at once to solve every crime. So the public ends up thinking of us as enemies. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could all be friends? Officer Mahoney, please come in. Have some lemonade. I love lemonade. -Not too tart, not-- -Too sweet, just good. So C.O.P. is a community action program, sir. -Like Neighborhood Watch? -More. Much more! We show the community that we care. We train volunteers in crime detection, in first-aid and.. -And it's a great idea, sir. -But we need citizen support. With all this neighborhood crime, I'm sure you'll get it. -Fore! -Right. What if we were to.. What was that? I believe brother Sweetchuck is suggesting. we recruit in our old neighborhood. Excellent. We have the full support of the Mayor. and best of all, the Governor of the state wants me to unveil the program. at the end of the International Police Seminar. next month in England. While I attend the seminar. you, my good friends. will put C.O.P. into action. It will change community relations all around the world. The Lassard Method. It rolls nicely off the tongue, don't you think? Hi! What did I miss? Hi. Capt. Harris, Police Commissioner Hurst is here. You want to see him? No. Send him packing. Yes, sir. -Proctor! -Yes, sir? Send the Commissioner in immediately. -I thought you said to send him packing. -Immediately! Yes, sir. Nincompoop. Commissioner. -You have a problem, Capt. Harris? -Yes, sir. Commissioner, I am extremely concerned with this memorandum from Lassard. about his C.O.P. program. Citizens doing police work? An asinine idea. If this goes through, no policeman's job, no policeman's paycheck, will be safe. Are you through, Captain? The Governor of this state thinks that this program is absolutely brilliant. So until he changes his mind, that's what you and I think, too. Agreed? -Yes, sir. -Good. You were right. You should have sent him packing. I don't give a damn what the Governor or the Mayor thinks. Lassard's program is a mistake. and anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong. Pure and simple. Don't touch those! Don't you ever touch my balls without asking! You're gonna have to leave. I'll call the police. I mean it. Okay, I'm going. I'm out of here. Wait a minute. I am the police. -No, you're not. -That's me. I'm here to speak about C.O.P. I'm sorry. I didn't.. Without the uniform on-- Regular human clothes make people more comfortable. Hi, ladies. Let's do some poetry! I got to go to my in-laws' for dinner tonight. You want to come? Officer Hightower, I'm here to join the new C.O.P. Program. Do I know you? Yeah, you used to bounce me on your knee. -I did? -Yeah. Little Tommy Conklin. -But now they call me House. -Tommy Conklin. Sure. Welcome aboard. You can register right over there. "Blind mouth that scare themselves "know how to hold a sheep-hook "Or have learned aught else at least "that to the faithful Herdsmans art belongs! " That was exciting. We have an Officer Zed, who's here to tell us. a little bit about a new police program. So won't you.. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. I'm an emotional, sensitive guy. and that part about the sheep-hook just tore my heart right out. I have my own poem that I prepared for you today. "Gene, Gene made a machine. "and Joe, Joe made it go. "l blew a fart and blew the whole damn thing apart." What is he saying? I didn't write it. Okay, I'd like to talk to you about what we're here for. and that's for me to pitch the new C.O.P. program to you. Perhaps a few of you ladies might be interested in it. So the bartender asked the organ grinder, "Hey, does your monkey sing any opera?" And I said, "Nope. "But if you hit me on the head, I'll sing Yankee Doodle. " It's so nice to have my family all back together again. -Can you pass the lettuce, Pop? -Sure, honey. Here you go. -Thanks, Pop. -You're welcome. Hey, listen. did I tell you I'm gonna join that Citizen On Patrol thing? That would be a great idea. I'd be proud to have you at the precinct. I'll take some more greens, Bud. -Dad. -Yeah? I don't think you should sign up. There are already three of us on the force. -It's going to look like favoritism. -That's not it. That's not it at all. You just don't think I'm fast enough anymore, do you? I don't think that's it, do you, Tack? It has nothing to do with being fast. Now, that was fast. You know, that was fast. But that's hard. Excuse me. I think Bud hurt Pop's feelings. Oh, you two. Oh, well, who wants pie? -I was just trying to help. -You hurt my arm. -I'll hand the rest out. Hi. -Hi. Could I interest you in the new citizens program? -No, I don't think so. -No, thanks. -We'll take the stairs. -Thanks, just the same. Excuse me! Would you be interested in the new citizens program? -Yes, in fact, we didn't hear you right. -Sure, here. -Why don't you hand the rest of them out? -Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir. -Arnie, where are you going? -Home. I got a boatload of stuff to do. I got a term paper due tomorrow, and a history test. I got to help my father clean the cellar, and I have to do the dishes tonight. What are you doing? -I'll get the guys and hang out at the mall. -Let's go. I thought I told you guys, no skateboarding in my district. This isn't skateboarding, Sergeant. This is carrying skateboards. This is skateboarding. -We got to check this out, you guys. -Take it easy. We'll see you later. I'll see you later. I want to check out these guys. All right, I'll be back. Hey, Sarge, look at that. Kyle, that skateboard punk. Let's nail him. Boy, you sure give them a hard time. Yeah. Fun, isn't it? You don't listen, do you, Kyle? I was shopping for Capt. Harris' birthday present. -Yeah? -Yeah. Shop somewhere else. Your Honor.. Here, Judge. Stop him! Hold up! Excuse me, pardon me. Excuse me, my fault. -Watch it! -Stop! Stop that skateboarder! Hold it! I can do that, that handstand stuff. I just hate it when the change falls out of my pocket. Hey, man, I think these guys want to talk to you. Hold it! Capt. Harris will hear about this! Come. -Sir. -Copeland, what the hell happened to you? Some skateboard punks started a riot at the mall. Bring them in here. -They got away. -They got away? -I did the best I could, sir. -It wasn't enough, was it, Copeland? -No, sir. -I'll handle these punks personally. -Yes, sir. -I want three patrol cars. dissecting the neighborhood. Copeland, my hat! -Yes, sir. -You, radio-alert all motorcycle units. I want a chopper in the air. Spot these boys on the ground. Proctor, ride with me. -Now, Proctor, move it! -Coming, sir. Be right there! There they go! Back it up. Quiet! I said quiet, dickhead. We've got them now. I know they came in here. Unit 6 to Capt. Harris. We've got them at the end of the alley. I got you now! You hold them right there. We're coming. Copeland, have you got them? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Carey Mahoney of the Police Academy. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you. You're too kind. It's Harris. Haul ass. Go. I got you, you little punks. Freeze, you little hoodlums. Get your hands off my ass, Proctor. Get away, Proctor. No. Don't shake the fence. Oh, shit. No! The purpose of this program. is to develop a better working relationship between us, the police. When he says, "Okay, boys and girls," we're all gonna. and you, the community. Stop! Stop right there! You see, the great thing is, this is a first. The Police Academy has offered to train you citizens to better protect yourselves. -You'll be trendsetters. -Do we get to pack heat? Heat-- Stop those little punks! Stop them! You're under arrest! Are you all right? Who's laughing now, you little twits? And your clothes make me want to puke. I'll tell you that right now. -Capt. Harris! -Well, well, Mahoney. -It's been a long time, sir. -So it has. Well, Motormouth Jones. Anyone ever tell you you've got a great tailor, sir? I mentioned that just last week. Has anyone told you, Mahoney, that you're still a little pissant? -No one whose opinion matters, sir. -What did Arnie and Kyle do? You know those clowns? I should have figured. Your little pals wrecked a police car, destroyed a shopping mall. harassed citizens, resisted arrest. Go easy, Captain. They're just wacky kids. We'll see how those wacky kids like it in jail. In all my years on the bench, I have seen all sorts of public disorder. Young people must learn to conform. to the standards and laws of civilized society. In reviewing the testimony and taking into account. your disregard for public and private property. I can reach only one decision: Guilty as hell. You flushed me down the toilet! Before you pass sentence-- They're gonna send me to jail, and some fat, hairy guy is gonna-- -May I approach the bench, Your Honor? -Yes, Sergeant. Sir, do we want to expose these boys, these children to a prison environment? -Yes. -May I run my own court, Captain? -You've got a better idea? -Yes, I do, sir. Comdt. Lassard has initiated a new community relations program. Why not assign these kids. to that program as a form of alternate sentencing? -That's ridiculous! -I'll be the judge of that. I.. Excuse me. I like the sound of this community relations gig. Milt Butterworth, defender of the common man. Your Honor, look at this list of complaints. And I quote you directly, sir, when I say-- Gee, sir, I thought you only got contempt of court for opening your mouth. Mahoney, I'm warning you. You keep Lassard's C.O.Ps out of my precinct. You don't understand what I'm trying to do. I understand exactly what you're trying to do. Just keep them out, especially these two little buttwads. Excuse me, sir, but you're not planning to attack us. with any more of your bodily functions, are you? You just make sure that we never meet again. Ever. You know, with those two idiots in Lassard's program, it'll never work. Excuse me, sir. We're looking for a Mrs. Feldman. -Do you know her? -Yes. Excuse me, ma'am. Do you know a Mrs. Lois-- -Where can we find Lois Feldman, please? -There. Thank you. Mrs. Feldman? -Who's asking? -Police. Is it about those damn library books? We're following up on your alleged interest in the Citizens On Patrol program. Then I'm Mrs. Feldman. Come on in. Callahan, cover your rear. I admire your taste. Yes, well, I do all my own decorating. You have a talent for it, ma'am. I'll be with you in a moment, Sarge. Perhaps you'd like to discuss the program first, ma'am. What's to discuss? Think I want to hang out here and listen to arteries hardening? Where did I put that bulletproof vest? All right, fall in! Come on, please, line up. Come on, I need a lineup here. Hello, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen-- -Thank you, Miss.. -Mrs. Feldman. I want to welcome all of you to the Academy. You are part of a new and exciting program that I call. -C.O.P. -C.O.P. -Citizens On Patrol. -Citizens On Patrol. -Citizens On Patrol! -Citizens On Patrol! You will work and train with the police. The police will work and train with you. Working and training, training and working. Excuse me, Commandant. But do you expect the community to do the job of the police force? There are many, many jobs for many, many people. Sir, I'll take care of this. Excuse me, young lady, what the Commandant means. is that this program will promote understanding. between the community and the police. and make the community more active in crime prevention. Active in crime prevention? Won't that be dangerous? No. We just want to teach citizens. to prevent crimes from taking place. It sounds fine in theory. Let's hope it works in practice. I like him. He's a really nice fish. He looks a little like you. I will attend an international police seminar in London. It would be the crowning achievement of my career. if I could close this seminar. by bringing instructors from all around the world. here to watch the C.O.P. program in action. I'm counting on all of you to make that possible. In Comdt. Lassard's absence. I've appointed a very able-bodied and experienced officer. to run the Academy. Perfect timing. Here he is now. Attention! Two weeks of Harris? Damn! Damn. Deodorant? Thanks. Straighten this mess up. -What mess? -Now! I want all of you dirtbags and that group of C.O.P. people. out in front of this dormitory at 1400 hours. Move it! Sir, we were just commenting on how you'd mellowed. -Captain? -What is it, Mahoney? I hope you're gonna give this program a fair chance. This program, Mahoney, is just like you: a bad idea. That's your opinion, sir. But this is Comdt. Lassard's idea, and his Academy. Things can change, Mahoney. Yes, things can change. I'll see you out front. I bet that was refreshing, sir. Over the next two weeks. you'll go through a modified training program. You'll learn many, many keys to crime prevention. Keys you can teach many, many others in your community. Modified? Modified nothing. I want the works. -Yeah. -Madam. I think it's time for a dose of reality. You can forget Lassard's hype. You people do not belong here. Especially you and you. Community action groups mean one thing, and one thing only. I hope that wasn't gum. You heard the Captain. Is it? It's definitely gum, sir. Bubble gum. Cherry, I think. -Thank you, Proctor. -You're welcome, sir. These groups only mean citizens getting in the way of the police. Now, I don't get involved in your business. and I don't want you involved in my-- Now, if you were smart. you would go home and forget this stupid idea.. Are those wedding bells I hear, sir? -Whose damn mutt is this? -It's my damn mutt. I want him out of here! -But, sir-- -Out! I am not getting rid of Clarence. He's my pet. Why should you? After all, Harris has Proctor. I'll take him. I have a big house, nice yard. See, he likes me. We'll get along fine. Me, too? I'm housebroken. Come on, C.O.Ps, let's step up to the white line! Let's line ourselves up with a slot, then let's listen to Mr. Jones. Thank you, Sgt. Tackleberry. This is a standard police issue.38. Examine this weapon carefully. You must be sure this weapon is not loaded. You will be responsible for the loading and unloading of this weapon yourself. Now, Sgt. Tackleberry. You want to become one with the gun. Feel the gun, caress the gun. until it's a living, breathing, vibrating. extension of yourself. I look for the same in a woman. This sucker's not loaded. You won't be using live ammo. Tack, how about letting me squeeze off a few rounds of that baby? Tack? Affirmative, Mrs. F. Now, be careful because a.44 magnum has quite a. kick. Damn, that was fun! Rescuing the drowning victim. Now, when approaching a potentially dangerous. and out-of-control victim, use this stroke only. Arms out of the way for protection. Now, when you get the victim in control, you slip your arm across his chest. under his opposite arm. Rest his head and his neck against your shoulder. Kick with your feet. Now, your victim could be struggling. Struggle, House. Good, House.. House! Really swift! I'll get him! Arnie, get out of the pool! You just ate! Get him out of here! Thanks, pal. Now we have an opportunity to start our water safety lesson. I will play the drowning victim. Now, who's going to save me? -Yeah! -Yeah! That was mighty brave. I admire that. That was nothing. You don't have a hair dryer, or perhaps some mousse? No. Your hair looks nice. It's very stylish. Moi? Stylish? I think I'd better be going. Mickey! He's dead! He killed him! -I'm sure the Academy will pay for it. -What about the sentimental value? This is a family heirloom here. This is the last thing I ever stole before joining the Academy. What the hell is this? Cadets in heat? No. We were just, like, talking. Just, like, talk somewhere else. This is not a spawning pool. I want discipline. Do I make myself clear, Zed? Discipline! -Jerk. -What? He said bye. No. I said jerk. I think it was pretty clear. -I said, "Jerk." -Jerk. Cadets, I'd now like to discuss with you. something that will be vital for you to know. when you're, like, out there on the job as a police officer. And that's the correct way to eat a doughnut. -A doughnut-- -Attention! Capt. Harris. From this moment on, anyone who misplaces their canister of Mace. will be reprimanded and fined. -Is that clear? -Yes, sir! Bye. As Citizens On Patrol. endurance and longevity should be very important to you. Aerobic activity will keep you in shape. and keep that heart rate up. Music, however, makes it a little less painful. Hooks, cassette. I have confidence that Sgt. Hooks has chosen the appropriate music. No cassette. Let's go. Nice selection, Hooks. All right. Slow walk. Slow start. Keep your arms moving. That's good. Into a nice slow jog. Okay! Arms moving. Keep breathing. Don't forget to breathe. Tuck his tummy, Hooks. Attagirl. Let's go. Now, this whistle can be very valuable. when walking through a bad neighborhood. If your purse gets snatched, blow this whistle. to alert your neighbors and the police so they can help. Now, Mrs. Feldman, would you play the victim? -Yes. -Okay, and I'll be Mr. Purse Snatcher. -Okay. -Go. Any questions? Now, practice. You had him for, like, a minute. He was scared. He was, like, flinching. His face went.. Sorry. Citizens On Patrol. What a joke. -You know what C.O.P. really stands for? -No, sir. What? -Collection Of Pissants. That's not funny. -No, sir. This citizen-action crap is a disaster, a bad idea, and I'm going to prove it. Yes, sir. Excuse me, everyone. I mean, not everyone. Attention! Excuse me. Move it! -Everybody, come over here! -Hooks. Stop embarrassing the Police Department and join your civilian buddies. May I have your attention, please? Hooks, the tank! -I'm so sorry. -You dimwit! Today, Hooks, today. Now, take your little munchkin voice and go away. Listen up! This is the proper procedure for administering oxygen. You place the mask securely about the face of the patient. and then have them breathe deeply. Now, that is the way it's done in Capt. Harris' precinct. What the hell? Hooks! So you gentlemen think you're on a vacation? You're no better than anyone else, so let's go, let's get to work. Come on, dudes, chill out. You dudes are setting a bad example. Can't hear you, bro. Can't you see I'm getting my beauty sleep? I'm sorry. Move it! You sure told them. Did you ever think about maybe getting some contact lenses. or something, like, you know? You'd look good in them. Proctor, this is an alley. I know, sir, but these are the directions Mahoney gave me. -Mahoney? -Yes, sir. He says this restaurant has the best salad bar in town. It damn sure better have. -Proctor. -Yes, sir? I don't see a salad bar. Look, maybe they serve seafood. That's not funny, you idiot. What are you looking at, you peckerhead? Nice uniform. Makes me wish I'd worn my sailor outfit. I'm getting out of here. Move it! I don't think cutting in is allowed, sir. Nice collar. Here we go again. Next round. Mahoney weaving his way through. looking pretty good. Gets past the main defense. And, under the leg! Nice shot! That man is a hot dog. The crowd's gone wild! The ball's brought in. Here we go. We have the play going. Throws to Zed. A little bit of a steal there. Mahoney throws a pass to Hightower. And then Hightower he.. The Doctor of Dunk scores! You killed it. Really swift! Some community action. Ladies and gentlemen, it's Lt. Proctor, a ghetto favorite! Thank you very much. I'm honored to be-- You know, Capt. Harris isn't gonna like this. goofing off. -Come on. This is community relations. -No, Mahoney. I'm an expert in goofing off, and this is goofing off. And I'm gonna have to tell him. -I have an urge to break him in half. -Why fight it? No, Hightower. Take it easy, big guy. The creep's not worth it. -You through in there? -Sure, go ahead. Thanks. Excuse me, Silvio? I wonder if you can help me. I need some help over here. -Right there. -No problem. Hold your horses, I'll be out in a minute! Okay, like, bring it in. Just, like, bring it in a hair. Watch out for the plane! Oh, the humanity! Okay, that's perfect. No, that's fine. -Metro police. -Special assignment. Ladies and gentlemen. please rise for our national anthem. -Read that part about me again, Arnie. -What part? You know, the part about the dynamic leader of the C.O.P. Get real! That's me they're talking about. Good evening, gentlemen. I congratulate you on another good day. Sleep well. Count, getting worried we're gonna be taking over soon? We're ready. You're improving, guys. But you're still way down in the food chain. As we vampires say, "Lights out, suckers." This C.O.P. bit is a breeze. -We are ready. -I concur. I think we're ready to bust some truly major criminals. Maybe we should go out and find some.. -Maybe we should become vigilantes. -Yeah, that's it. Vigilantes. Wake up, men! We need you. Now! Come on. -What's going on? Where are we going? -Why are we here? What's happening? You're here because you're ready. You said you were ready. -One thing l-- -You're ready, now. Could you be a little more specific concerning our current mission? -We're apprehending two known felons. -I'll be going home now. -Where are the rest? -What rest? We're it. -We'll flush them out of the building. -You stay behind, cut them off in the alley. Stay. What about guns and shit, man? Guns? No, you won't be needing them. We're pretty sure they're not armed. They can handle this without us. We'll just get in the way, you know. Good thinking. We got them, men! It's all right, men. Come on over. All right, you three will be riding in the back with Badula. and his late brother. You guys keep him subdued. Let's go. Don't let his voodoo mumbo jumbo scare you. Fools. To think they can kill the brother of Badula. I never thought that. That I could reach into the belly of a yak and rip out his heart. That would bring him back to life? No, man. I'm hungry. Listen, we're going for some burgers and fries. We'll be right back. Out of my way! I guess they weren't as ready as they thought they were. You can take the mask off now, Tack. -Proctor. -Yes, sir? -Who are all these people? -They're here for the party, sir. What party? A few of the Citizens On Patrol members invited a few of their friends. and they invited a few of their friends. You know how it goes, sir. -A party? -Yes, sir. A party? Why wasn't I told? Hey, Callahan. Hey, Hooks. Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen, can I please have your attention? I'd like to thank you all for coming! Let's party! -Move those patooties. -Excuse me. All police officers out of the pool! Let's go! Out, everybody out! Sir, why don't you just let everyone enjoy themselves? Why don't you just kiss my rosy red ass, Mahoney? Rosy? Get out of that pool now! Just look at yourself. You are a disgrace to the uniform! Go get changed. Move it. -What are we looking for? -This. -Why, Capt. Harris. -Miss Mattson. -Hello. -How are you? Have you seen Clarence? Don't you let that fleabag near me. Clarence is crazy about you, Captain. Let me just call him over. -No. -For a second? -No. -Okay. Bye. Wipe those grins off your faces, buttbreaths! Dismissed! Dr. Berman, please pick up line two. Dr. Berman, line two, please. -You shouldn't be in here. -How is Capt. Harris? -We'll do all we can. -Please, be gentle. I heard what Harris said, and he's wrong. It happens to me all the time. People just don't understand me. Maybe if you talked a little slower, a little softer.. That's not what I meant. I meant people don't know who I really am. Now I got to worry about my diction, too? -How's my sentence structure? -Perfect. In fact, I think you're just about perfect. I think I'm going to puke. Hi, sir. How are you feeling? I have to wait for the damn glue to wear off. I didn't catch that. Was that, "the dim shoot to snare off"? I said I have to wait for the damn glue to wear off. So I asked her, "Do you always work under podiums?" Commandant? Why, Chief Hurst, this is a splendid, splendid surprise! You remember Nogata? He's part of our Japanese contingent. This is Chief Hurst. We have heard many, many wonderful things about you and your city. I've been helping them with their English. -Please, sit. Please. -Thank you. I hope you'll find the time to see our beautiful city firsthand. In fact, I've just flown here personally. to extend the Mayor's invitation. to see my.. To see Comdt. Lassard's community program in action. We are convinced that this program will serve. as a model for cities around the world. We would be honored to accept your invitation. -Wonderful. -Please, come. -Auf Wiedersehen. -Arrivederci. Bonsoir. I see you've been teaching them something other than English. I do what I can. -So my program is really, really working? -Hell, yes. Starting tomorrow, C.O.Ps will be working the streets. C.O.P. emergency. Feldman here. Meet me at the corner of Clark and Main Street at the warehouse. 10-4, Mrs. F. -$40, we're agreed? -Okay, $40. Snap off a few shots for evidence. Get closer. I saw this on Hill Street Blues. It's a fencing operation. You're gonna love these. We just unloaded a van full of them. Okay, bring in the rest of it. Next case. Nice camera. Don't let that crook give you less than $80. Freeze, you scuzzbuckets! This is a citizen's arrest. Get them, boys! You're not moving till the cops get here. I am the cops, lady. Three months' work out the window, down the drain. Your Citizens On Patrol just screwed up. the single biggest undercover police sting operation. in the history of this city! Tell them the good news, sir. -Thank you, Proctor. -You're welcome, sir. As of now, the C.O.P. program is suspended. pending a full investigation. Attention! Mahoney, I'm so, so proud of the job you've done. Nice work, men. The eyes of the world are on this program. Excuse me, sir. I think we should talk. This precinct must deal with every type of criminal. from pickpockets to armed robbers, felons of all kinds-- Capt. Harris. Excuse me. Don't forget the gang of ninjas. They're my personal favorites. Why don't you go pay them a visit? This precinct is run on discipline and organization. Simon says, "Pull your left ear." Simon says, "Hop on your left foot." Come on, guys. Simon says, "Hop on your right foot." It's a little too noisy in here, gentlemen. We have important police officials visiting. and I think you'd better show the proper respect. Come on, Lieutenant. We're almost finished. Come on, Lieutenant, join us in a friendly game of Simon Says. There's nothing to it. Now, Simon says, "Touch your toes." Come on, Lieutenant. Simon says, "Clap your hands." Come on, get in the spirit. Simon says, "Two steps right." Simon says, "Five steps back." Put your hands up! Simon didn't say. No, but Smith & Wesson does. The high-security cell area is used to hold criminals. awaiting trial or transfer to state or county facility. Any convictions involving felons. perverts, thieves, people of that nature, are held in this area. -You will notice the steel construction. -What the hell is he doing in there? I think that explains it, sir. Come on, hurry up! It's getting to the point now when I'm with you I no longer want to have something stuck in my eye Your mother, my mother ain't never looked like Florence Henderson I wrote that for you. I hope now that C.O.P. is over. it won't mean that we won't be seeing each other anymore. Shut up! Not you. I meant the ducks. Attention. This is Mrs. F. -There's been a jailbreak. -Zed, 10-4! Tack, you pick me up at Main and Maple. Move it! Over and out.

We've got an international incident going on here! -I knew you'd come. -Ja, danke. -You may thank Mrs. Feldman. -Who is Mrs. Feldman? You know Mrs. Feldman, a member of the defunct C.O.P. team. This is Sgt. Mahoney in pursuit of a stolen police car. I'm headed towards the Williams County air show. Repeat, I'm pursing four escapees toward the Williams County air show. Now, folks, making his second appearance. at the Williams County air show.. -Look out for that car! -What car? That car! Come on, get out! Come on! Let's get out of here! Hurry up! This is where I draw the line. I'm not going up in one of those things. -No way. No, sirree. -You don't have to. You can open your eyes now. How can you like this better than my driving? Because you can't do this in a car. Grab that balloon! We commandeer this balloon in the name of the law! -No, wait, you can't! -You can't do that. We need it for the race. Mrs. Feldman, stay with the car. Zed, Sweetchuck, follow me. Guys, wait up! Tackleberry. -What do I pull? -Take it up! -They're getting away! Let's go! -We are going up, sir. Come on!

After a while I get tired and I just start walkin'. <i>I must have went like that for hours.</i> <i>Me walkin' and him chasin'.</i> Then I turn, aim the gun. I took out his legs. I blew his kneecap off. <i>Then he starts crawlin' at me.</i> <i>I aim for his head.</i> <i>I couldn't do it.</i> I should have shot him. Barry. <i>You got any stories?</i> - This morning I shot my wife and child with a nail gun. I don't know how to make that into a story. - Uh-uh. Get rid of it.

Have a look at him. Last night was Neville breathing the gas? - Nah, that only really started up this morning. - It's getting dark, ay. - Yeah. - They stop breathing the gas at night. - That's why they're faster. They're using it themselves. We're fucked! - Boys! Get in the fucking truck! - Get in the truck, Frank. <i>Get in the truck.</i> Get your helmets on. Oh. Fuck me! It's gonna be a long night. - What do ya reckon, Frank? This is the worst fuckin' nightmare of your life or what? - No fuckin' way, mate. - What the fuck could be worse than this? - About 15 years ago the doctor told me my son had brain cancer. He was only 7-years-old. Talk about shitting yourself. He died in my arms. <i>That was way worse than this.</i> This is fuckin' nothin'. - Sorry to hear about that, Frank. - Yeah, well. These things happen, ay. Baz? - So what I've been wondering is. How come we're not like them? How come we never turned? - Wyrmwood. - What? - You never read the Bible? - Nah, man. I don't read that shit. In Revelations when the third angel blows his trumpet. A star called Wyrmwood falls to the Earth bringing a disease that kills a fuckload of people. That's pretty much the beginning of the end Biblically speaking. When I seen those meteor showers last night.. .and then in the morning all these dead bastards come running outta the bushes I figured we were pretty deep into that final judgment, you know? - Yeah? - Yeah. When the end comes all the good folks go upstairs, and all the bad folks go downstairs and there's a bunch of poor bastards left in the middle. - What happens to them? - They undergo a trial by fire. They get tested by God. - So you reckon we're being tested right now? - Yeah. I reckon we are. - I fucking hate tests. - I'm gonna try and get some sleep. If one of them bastards gets in here and kills me, wake us up, will you? Aah! What the fuck. what the fuck's going on? - Fuck! - Is that fire? - What happened? - I don't know. I shot one of them in the face and the fucker lit up. - What? What did you do that for? - Fuck. - If that fire reaches the compressor, we're stuffed. - You think I don't know that, Frank? I'm going up there. - No, you're fucking not. There's a shitload of them things out there, mate. - What else am I gonna do? Look, I'm gonna go out there and put the fire out. Fuck those things! - Take the helmet. Put it on. - Let's do this. - Fuck you! - You ugly fuckers! - Barry! What the fuck's going on? - Fuck. - Barry! - Ah! - Lock it! - Fuck! <i>- Frank, did it bite you?</i> Frank! Did it bite you, mate? - The medical box. - Ay? - The fucking. The fucking medical box at your feet! - Oh. You want some bandages? - Open it. - Oh, beers. You want a beer, Frank? - What do you fucking reckon? Take a drink. Take a fucking drink! - Gimme some. - I can't do it. I'm Catholic. I can't do it. Come on, mate! It's okay. It's alright. <i>I've had a good life.</i> <i>Just make sure</i> you do it while I'm still me, yep. - I'm really sorry, mate. - Fucking do it! - Mind if I finish this? - Oh, oh, oh. Oh, fuck man. Fuck off, meathead. Oh, I think I'm gonna spew. I've got a pounding hangover. Oh, nice one. - Gimme a hand with Frank. Come on. - Nice one! - Let's get the fuck out of here, ay! - Yeah. Let's do it. - You gonna say something? - What's there to say? - What was that? - He's safe now. That crow will come and take his spirit. - Nice. Come on, let's go. - You boys military? - Yeah. - You guys know what's been going on here? - You fellas A negative - What? - 'Course they're fucking A negative, Thommo. - What's he talking about? - All we know is there's something in the air that's changing people. Anyone with an A negative blood type is unaffected. That's obviously you, fellas. People with any other blood type.. .not so lucky. So where are you boys headed? - North. - We're going to Bulla Bulla. - Bulla Bulla? Why? - To get his sister. - That's a pretty bad idea. We've just come from Bulla Bulla. It's not looking good there's infected everywhere. Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, fellas! Alright, look, we're all friends here, okay? We got a call from our captain about 10 minutes ago and now, he's in a roving unit, just down the road, okay? Now, he said, he picked up a couple of A negative blood types. Survivors just like you two. What was your sister's name? - Brooke. - Yeah, right. I'm pretty sure one of them was Brooke. Well, how about I go and radio our captain and confirm that for you, huh? - Yeah, you do that. - Well, they've definitely got a Brooke. - Well, I wanna speak to whoever's on that radio. - Listen, now you hear me out. Just relax, hop back in your car and I will take you to your sister. - Just tell me where she is. - Look, mate, I don't even have time for this shit, alright? There are about a million things that I have to do right now. And you boys, you're pretty low on my priority list. So hop back in your car, and you follow me or don't. You're choice. Thommo, we're rolling. Well, what's it gonna be? - We'll follow you. - They seem like nice blokes.. ..or not. - I don't like it. - Don't like what? - Don't know. That guy's full of shit. - Fuck. It's time. You! - What the fuck? Those lying fucks. That's Brooke! Brooke! - Barry? Oh, shit! - Quick! Jump! Jump! <i>Quickly!</i> Shit! - They're shooting at us! - Go! Go! Go! - Hold on! <i>Woo-hoo!</i> Fuck! - What's that sound? - Come on! - What's the problem? - I don't know. You okay? What happened back there? - Oh, fuck me dead, Barry! They blew this joker's head off. - Shit. We need to find a zombie fast. - Zombie? What do we need a zombie for? - This truck runs on zombies. No zombies, no truck. - Come on, you dead bastards! Come and get it! Where are ya? - You want a zombie? - Yeah. - I'll get you a zombie. <i>- Fuck!</i> - Brooke, what the fuck's wrong with your eyes? - Don't shoot him. Shit! - Alright, what the fuck just happened then? - Where do you want him? - Back of the truck. - She can control fucking zombies! - What? - Come on. - What are we waiting for? - We need mask on that thing's mouth. - What mask? - The mask! The blue fucking mask! - Okay. Go! - The joke's on me now, bro. - You okay? - Nah I'm fucked. What the fuck are you doing? - Putting pressure on the wound. It'll stop the bleeding. - Just fuckin' warn me next time, ay? - Sorry. - You're better-looking than your brother. - So are you. I'm Brooke. - I know. I'm Benny. - Thanks for helping me out back there, Benny. - No problem, darling. Nice to finally meet ya. I wish I could say I'd heard a lot about ya. But your brother there is a bit of a tight-lipped bastard. - Yeah. - I guess it runs in the family. - Hey, Barry? Where's Annie and Megan? - They're dead. - My brother Mulla he's up there in the trees laughing at me the bastard. - Barry, we're gonna have to pull over. Benny's not good. - Fuck. Alright, I'm gonna pull off road. There you go, mate. - It's a nice day for it. Oi! I want you to leave me here, bro. - Don't be stupid. - Listen to me. Just give me a gun and plenty of bullets. I can take care of meself. - I know you can, mate. There's no bloody way I'm leavin' you here. Let's take a look at this thing, ay? Shit. - You two gotta keep moving, you know that. - Fuck that bullshit. We're gonna patch you up and we're all leaving here together. - No, I'm not getting back in that truck. - Yeah, you are. Brooke? Brooky! Brooke! You alright? Oh, God! Fuck me! No. - Something's happening to me. - Come here. I killed them both. - Could you do it for me? - I don't know if I can. - Give me the gun. - Will you hold my hand? - Give me the gun. Run! Go! Come on fuckheads! <i>- Wakey, wakey.</i> Call to your sister. - Go fuck yourself! - Thompson. <i>Rubber bullets.</i> They pack quite a punch though, don't they? You wanna know what the real one feels like, mate? - The real one feels like shit, Barry. <i>- Call to your sister.</i> - Nah, she'll be right. - Go and get the pliers. - Call to your sister. - Fuck you! - Fuck me! You ever seen 'em move that fast in the daytime before, boss? - McLaughlin. <i>- Yes, boss.</i> - Take another nail out. - Stop! - Oh, shit. <i>- Put 'em on.</i> - Ah, fuck this shit! Come on! - Leave her alone, you fucking bastards. - Shut up, dickhead. - Easy, easy. Sorry about him. - Listen up. They want us to take the girl's head off and chuck it in the icebox for later. - Fuck yeah. - Actually, boss, I've got just the thing for this. It's over in the truck. - Go and get it now. - Hey, Benny. You got those matches on you mate? - Yeah. - Gimme 'em, ay? - Why? - I'm gonna take us all out. - Ay? - See that compressor up there? I'm gonna blow it up. Be like a fucking atom bomb went off. - Can we talk about a possible alternative? - We got no time, mate. We're dead anyway, you know that. - I got a better idea. - Fuck's sake, what? - I let him up there bite me. - What the fuck are you talking about? - I've got a number 7 killer boomerang hidden under the truck. Sharp as fuck. - A boomerang? - Yeah. - Your sister, she can control zombies. - Yeah, so? - So, I'll be a zombie. That bloke she killed over there.. .his gun. - What? - Benny, give me the fucking matches. Now. - You want a head taken off? You use a fuckin' sword. - Where the fuck did you get that? - Who cares? Let's get this done. - Fuck yeah, boss. - Leave her alone, you fucking bastards. <i>Fuckin' touch her.</i> Benny they're about to chop my sister's fucking head off. Now give me the fucking matches. - What about my idea? - What about your idea? You're rambling. You're not making any fucking sense, mate. - I'm rambling, am I? - Give me the fucking matches, Benny. - McLaughlin, you help me hold her down? Thompson, you're cutting. - With pleasure, boss. - You want the matches? - For fuck's sake, now. - Here's the matches. - Fucking wanker. Come on. - Come here, you bastard. - You're going down, ball buster. - One. <i>Two.</i> Three. - Drop the gun or they attack. - No! No! No! <i>No!</i> <i>You fuckers!</i> - Ah, fuck! - I'm guessing you're not an A negative blood type, mate. You're done, son. Just a matter of time. - Well played. There's more at stake here than you know, mate. It's not about you, or you sister, or your mates. It's about the survival of the human fucking race, mate! Do you understand? - You're a piece of shit. - You wanna fight me, mate? - I wanna rip your fucking head off. - Fuck it. You and me go round and round. Come on then, take a fucking swing. Come on. Come on, mate. Don't you fucking pussy out on me now. Stand up. Good boy. Now, I could snap your fucking neck in half, right now. Oh, you. Oh, fuck! Never. never ever.. .grab a man's balls in a fist fight. It shows low character. - What about using a gun? You're a fucking dog. - Dog, am I? You're the fucking dog, mate. Jesus Christ. Fuckin', this shit is over, mate, alright? I'm telling ya, some blokes.. .just don't know.. .when.. .to quit. Well, there you go. You're right back where you started. Didn't exactly rip my fucking head off did ya, mate? Fuck, hey. Shit. They are fucking disgusting. <i>Where are you going mate?</i> You were doing so fucking well. Now what are you going to do with those? - Oi! - What the fuck? Get on the fucking ground and put your hands on your head. - So, what's in the truck? - Get down on the fucking ground now! - Wrong answer. - You mother fuckers. This is Intercepter One, It's going down, I repeat, the Bogey is going down, Detail, attention! Yes, sir! You! You! Present arms! Present arms! - Sorry l used the security phone, sir. - That's all right, Max. - My golf's not what it was. - This sounds crazy. l think we have a. Max, what could be worse than invading Europe? After you, sir. - Brief me. - lt entered our air space last night. lt made a mockery of our intercepters. According to our pilots, it suffered a malfunction and crashed in the desert. Was there a crew or any survivors? The egg-heads found the remains of two creatures and pulled the engine out. They want time to study it. - Has the press gotten wind of this? - We don't think so, sir. But we can't keep this on ice indefinitely. Get rid of it. Right away, sir. So, what l've attempted to do here is to instill in you a basic scientific curiosity about the world we live in. Sherman, tell me about your science project. Mr Roberts, l've studied the accuracy of the Gregorian calender in relation to the vernal equinox. Good. Ellie, tell me about yours. Well, Mr Roberts, l'm doing the. l want you to listen! l'm doing the effects of ultaviolet rays on plant fungus. That's outta sight, Ellie. Would you call me Bob? Only the pigs call me Mister. They're not getting away with it. Harlan! Why not tell us about your science project? What? This is science class. Your science project? - l'm working on it. - You're working on it? Hey, Mike. Ciao, babe! How is that, two weeks before graduation, a man of your mechanical capabilities hasn't finished his science project? l've been working at Charlie's garage. lt cuts into my free time. - Yeah. - You know. l don't make the rules around here, but bottom line, golden rule - no project, no diploma, babe. Oh, yeah. l thought l could, maybe, rebuild a carburettor if that's OK. Come on, Harlan. You do that in your sleep. Do something special, something original. Come on, man. And don't forget your science final tomorrow. Hey, man. l don't like to hassle you, Mike. Have a nice day. - Nice day? - Yeah. Come on! l was your age once - in the '60s when all you needed to finish school was a Frisbee. A gas mask helped! - See ya later, Bob. - Protest songs, white rabbits. TNT didn't hurt anything. ''Take tea and see''. Free love! Cosmo says that today is the day, so get rid of 'em. Hey, Crystal. How you doin'? Michael, l can't keep this mink wheel. What? Why not? We must seek different destinies, Michael. Our song is over, finis. Comprendez? No, wait a second. Talk English, will you, Crystal? You're more interested in your stupid GTO than me. Wait. Whose name is on my fender? Yours! Don't we go out all the time? Don't we? - To car shows, drag racing, junkyards. - So what? - That's not what l want. - So what do you want, Crystal? Him? Michael, l want to be swept off my feet, seranaded, worshipped like a goddess. Come on! Bullshit! That is exactly what my ''Cosmo'' romantiscope said you'd say, Michael. Ta-ta for ever, monkey wrench! Romantiscope?! Ellie, l know it's short notice but l was wondering if you wanted to go to the prom? Look, Sherman, can we talk about it later? Gotcha! Finally! Now l need some information from you, OK? - Pull the plug will you? - lt's for the yearbook. l need stats now! - You got lousy timing. - l know. lt's a flaw in my character. Now, what's your sign, Harlan? Pontiac. ''Bimbo leaves Harlan in limbo!'' Makes a great yearbook headline, don't you think? Newsflash update. - l dumped Crystal. - That is not what l heard. - No? - No! OK. What do you want to know? - Your major? - Yeah. Major? l don't know. Auto shop. - Favourite video game? - ''World Series''. All right, how many times did you see ''Jedi''? - l never saw ''Jedi''. - You never saw ''Jedi''? Have you been under a car for ten years? - All right, what do you like? - What do l like? l like cars. l like Springsteen. l like.l like my goat, you know. - Goat? - Yeah. - OK, yeah, but.? - But what? What do you do in your spare time? Cars. Bye. What goat?! l want you! Mike! So what's the dish, cousin fish? What happened? Talk to me. - What? With who? - With Crystal. Everybody know about this but me? ln ''Dynasty'', this guy got a girl back with a Chihuahua fur coat! Vince! She doesn't want a fur coat. She doesn't even want me. - Yeah? What does she want? - l don't know. She wants to be.romanced. - Swept off her feet. - l'd sweep her off her feet with a left! - A girl pulls that back in Brooklyn. Bam! - OK, Vince. Hey. You're cool, right? You're cool? Yeah. l'm cool. l don't know, Vince. - Crystal. - Why can't women be like cars? You put gas in a car and you cruise. Try and treat that girl nice and she leaves me in the dust. You know, my old man says treat broads like dirt and they love ya. Yeah? What's your old lady say? My parents are divorced. That's how come l'm living in the sticks with the old man. - What did Sawyer want? - l don't know. Yearbook stats. - l hit on Sawyer once. - Yeah? l tried to give her this ltalian macho bod! - What did she do? - Poor girl lost out! Called me a word l had to look up in the dictionary. Psych majors are trouble. - l'm serious! - Check this out. l put in new lifters. - Blow Matuski away! - Matuski's a fag! Yeah, man! Let's roll! Come on, Sawyer! Move that thing away! Come on! Get it out of there! - What's going on, Sawyer? - lf l knew that, Harlan, l'd fix it! OK! Come on, you're holding everybody up. Get in the car. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Motorhead Mike! Show-off! l don't believe this. OK, Sawyer. What's going on? Distributor caps don't just pop off unless you want 'em to. OK. lt's confession time. l need you to save me from being voted Senior Class Spinster. What? Be a boy scout and give me a date. Sawyer! Too much! OK. OK, Sawyer. l'll pick you up at eight. Be outside. - Outside? Won't you meet my parents? - Yeah. Outside. No way. You're better with cars than with people. Look, if you don't want to do this, it's fine. No, Harlan. Really. l'll be outside at eight. Fine. OK. Oh, yeah, one more thing. Do you read that mag ''Cosmo''? That rag? Are you kidding? Good. - Harlan? - What? The name's Ellie not Sawyer, OK? Right. Ellie. Hey, let's move it or we'll move it for ya! - Let's go, Sherm the worm! - Move the heap, gonad. Get it outta the way! Here you are. A bit more! lt's so good! Mikey! Mike! This is my kid here. - Hi. - l didn't expect you home so early. l.l got take-out here. Why don't you grab yourself a table? Oh, no, no. That's OK. Oh, Mike, l'd like you meet Delores. She's the sales representative for. - Betty-Jo. - Betty-Jo Cosmetics. - How do you do, Michael? - Hi. l'm so pleased to make your acquaintance. l gotta get going. l've got a date. l'll just.l'll just take a beer. Nice meeting you, Louise. Come on, Skipper. Ciao, Michael. Louise? - You're really out to impress me, Harlan! - What? - Breaking and entering on a first date! - Come on! l can't believe this. l must have a masochistic tendency l didn't know about. Doesn't anybody wine and dine a girl any more? Come on! Keep it down, will you? Get down! Oh, come on, Harlan. Wait up! Harlan! This may be a stupid question, but what are we doing in a junkyard? - This isn't just any junkyard. - What's special about it? lt used to be an old military testing ground. Now they just dump all their old junk here. l thought you'd like it. - You want to be a reporter, don't you? - Yeah. Or a psych. - What's that got to do with anything? - Look around. Everything here's got a story behind it. Yeah. You know, you're right. l never really thought about it. Harlan! What are we doing here? l need a project to graduate. l can't do anything scientific. What l can do is.is restore old machines. l might find something to pass off as my science project. Michael! Are you OK? Yeah. Just get that light out of my eyes. Sorry. - What is it down there? - l don't know. A fallout shelter or something. ''You can protect yourself from radioactive fallout.'' - Michael, what is it? - Nothing. Please keep your voice down. OK. Michael, where are you? Michael, it's really spooky up here. Please come back. Yeah. Just a second. ''Property of US Government''. Michael, l think l heard something. ''To be opened by authorized personnel ''only under controlled conditions''. - Ellie, toss me that big light. - OK. Thanks. What.? Michael, please come out so l can see you. Hey, Ellie? OK, that's it, Harlan. This is the end of the line for me. What are you doing up there? We've gotta get outta here. - On that ratty ground? - There are worse things than rats. - Yeah? Such as what? - You kids! Hold it right there! - Jail. Come on! - Oh, God! This is Federal property! Just great! l'm gonna get arrested and end up in some woman's prison somewhere. Will you stop talking and run?! - So, you come here often? - Come on! Come on, girl. Let's get 'em. So what do you do for fun? Hurry up. Stop, you two! Freeze! Hold it! - Well, a night to remember. - Look, l. What was that? l don't get it. What did you do? Nothing. lt just died. Doesn't make sense. l just tuned this thing. - What's going on? - Don't ask me. You're the car nut. - What's going on? - l don't know. Damn! Lucky we're close to town. - Yeah? How's that lucky? - We can walk. - Not me. - What are you talking about? - l'm stayin' here. - Staying here? Why? First, l'd never leave my goat here, all right? Secondly, if l walked into town the whole world would know l broke down. - Come on! lt happens to everybody. - Not to me. Then why are we standing here? - Oh, thanks. - Are you OK? l got a little car problem. Can l use your radio? Sure. - Can l get channel 18? - Yeah. - Slower. - BrookIyn Boy! Do you read me? Rene. BrookIyn Boy, read me? Whoa! Come on. Wait a minute. Wait. Oh, man! Mike, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Listen, l got an SOS, OK? Five miles north of town on 73, do you read me? - Hey, l'm comin'. Chill out. - Hey, Vinnie! My partner needs me. We're outta here. So what am l? Kryptonite? - Do you want a sip? - l don't like beer. Right. Sawyer and Harlan! Wait till Crystal finds out about this. Rene, zip it up! Hey, you punks! Move that piece of junk to the side of the road. Sit on this, butt plug! Punk! All right! Yeah! OK, ease up. This is it. That's good, Vinnie. Not now. l'm not in the mood no more. - You'll be begging me later. - lf you're lucky. Motorhead Mike broke down? Wait till we spread that around school. l had a.really neat time tonight. Yeah. Sure you did! No, no, really. lt was. lt was a surprise. Like you, Harlan. Hey, Ellie? The name is Michael. OK? OK, Michael. - Good night. - 'Night. - Let's go, Vinnie! - Blasting off! l thought you had dibs on Sawyer, Sherm. Look, do we have a deal or what? Messing with Harlan and Tonto's gonna cost ya. - How much? - One video cassette. - Term paper. - Science project. You got it! Let's go. Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred. You ain't exactly been the perfect date, Vinnie. - You ain't exactly been a perfect date. - Since when? Since you still ain't turned into a pepperoni pizza! Well, you can just drift, hum hole! The sock ain't foolin' anyone! Poor girl. You know, l've seen this movie where this haunted car flames guys out. Yeah! Wonder what the hell shorted out the electrical system. - This starter's totally shot! - l swear somebody's got it in for you, Mikey. - lt pisses me off. - l remember this ''Mannix''. These dudes are after another dude so they put dynamite in the first dude's car. - When he turns the ignition. - He gets flamed, right? - You seen it too? - Oh, Vinnie! What's this piece of junk? l don't know. l found that at old Dawson Field. Figured l'd pass it off as my science project. Well, good luck. You'll need it. Yeah. Thanks for helping me out, Vinnie. No sweat. See ya at the brain fest tomorrow. - OK. Take it easy. - Yeah, 'night. Good night. Somebody's definitely got it in for you, Mikey. - Yeah? Like who? - Some low-octane type. Crystal, maybe. Right. Vinnie? Holy sh. - Look at this! - My God! - You all right? - Yeah. - What do you think it is? - Could be an engine. But an engine to what? l wonder what this thing runs on. Unleaded. - Maybe premium! - Shut up, Vinnie! Holy smoke! My box! Ga. - What happened? - l don't know. Brand-new batteries. - Yeah. - That pisses me off. Go get that battery. l wanna run some juice through this. All right. Move, move. - OK, hook it up. - Why me? lf it blows up in your face you've got nothin' to lose. OK, move outta the way. Where shall l put this? l don't know. Be careful. Shit! - Put that thing out! lt'll blow up. - l'm getting outta here. Holy smoke! What's it doing? Vince! What was that noise? - Look, look, look. - Yeah! Disconnect it! You disconnect it. l'll watch. What's it doing? Vince? Weird! We're hallucinating, right? No ''Outer Limits'' l ever seen had this stuff before. What do we do? We disconnect it. Come on. You disconnect it. l'll watch. - Go ahead. l'll stand guard. - Yeah. OK. Mike, remember the show in which the Egyptian vase just. Give it a rest. OK, Vince? Yeah, sure. l'm cool. Yeah. - Yeah, we're working on the car. - l don't work on the car. - Should we tell sombody.? - No. Not yet. The science final! Grab that thing! Just grab it! Come on! Put that on there. - That's good. - OK. Come on. That's weird. Wait a second. lt's gotta be wrong. So how come everybody's leaving like school's over? - l don't know. - Stay tuned. - We went two hours into the future. - What? Sherm! How's life in the fat lane? Vince Latello, comedian. You guys lost or something? We're not lost, Sherman. We came for.a book. - A car book? - No, not a car book. A book about.strange things. - Like Vince? - Sayonara, big nose. Hold me back. Take it easy. Look, Sherman, we just want this book. Help us out, OK? - OK. - OK. What kind of strange things? Well.sort of like stuff. Stuff vanishes then stuff comes in from other times, but you can't touch the stuff. - 'Cause it kinda disappeared. - Like you if you flap your fish lips again! - That sounds like magic which is section. - No, magic's make-believe. Yeah, we're talking about the flip side of reality. Well, this is the science section. lt's about as real as you can get. What's the title? What? Author. - l don't know. - Well, what's it about? Monsters, flying lawn-mowers, weird shit! No, no. lt's about these two guys, right? They go into this room and these things come in and out of the walls. - Sounds weird all right. - See, these guys leave this room. - lt's two hours into the future. - Only it felt like ten minutes to the two guys. That sounds like we're dealing with a time-space warp. - A time-space what? - Warp. A time-space warp. - How does it work? - Simple. lt's kinda like breaking through the barriers between time, space and all dimensions. You mean outer space? Yeah. Right. - So, they're all connected? - Precisely. They coexist within the same space on different planes of reality, that's all. So, like, something could warp in from one dimension to another? - Sure, but only if the warp got outta control. - Outta control how? Einstein theorised it would take great power to break through a barrier. The danger is, once you unleash the power, you'd lose control of it. - Yeah, and then what? - Earth's energy field would go crazy. A chain reaction could start. Weather could change. And boom! You're all cosmic dust! - Hey, Mike. Banks! - What? We point the gizmo at the greenery. Bammo! lt vanishes into our car. We make a fortune! Your pilot light is out. - Well, what do we do with it? - lt's my science project, remember? Turn it in, get my diploma and kiss this school goodbye. - You're pullin' my zucchini. - You got a better suggestion? Yeah. l say we sell it to ''60 Minutes''. ''60 Minutes''? - See ya. - There he is. Bob! - Listen, about the. - You cut my science final. Where were you? - ln the auto shop. - ln the ozone. ln the ozone, blow zone! l'm tired of you four Fs. l'll tell you one thing, unless your project is dyno-supreme, you both get Ds. - Hey, l'll take it. - l wanted to talk about my science project. Maybe you'd come by and take a look at it. l'm off to an anti-war alumni meeting and l'm late. Can you dig it? - You're the only one who'd understand this. - Don't bet on it. - Give us a break. - All right. - l'll be here grading papers at nine o'clock. - Nine o'clock?

What world are we talking about? - lt's broken. - Vinnie, get that battery. Wait. Bob, why would that be broken? Because if it isn't broken, Michael, this is older than Earth. All right?

Can you imagine the advanced alien civilisation that created this? l mean, this is. This is bigger than all of us. This is. This is bigger. Bigger than any of us. This is bigger than the planet. lt's. lt's even bigger than the solar system. Bob, is this like when you said we could smoke banana peel? Oh, ye of little faith! - What is it, Bob? - l'll tell you what it is. lt's a time-space warp that's created by this gizmo and we can travel through time and space. Yeah? Let's call ''People'' magazine. No. l vote we tell the police. The pigs? No pigs! No. No! - Unhook it, Vince. - No! Don't you touch that, Vince. lt's an implosion meltdown.

Somethin' tells me we ain't in Kansas no more, Toto! See? l told you guys. The warp's expanding. Look, it's people from the past and the future. And we're all here together! This is like a. This is like a crossroads of time and space. - Yeah. - Wow! l don't believe this. Do you, Mike? - No. - Unreal!

Optical delusions, Latello! - Thanks. l owe you one. - Yeah. Take it easy. Ciao! Let's rest here for a while. Hey, round boy. How d'you learn to fight so good? Cliff Notes, Latello! How do you work these things? Well, according to ''Stoddard's Guide To Modern Weaponry'', you eject the spent clip, you pop the fresh clip into the chamber. ..pull back the cocking mechanism and you're ready to rock 'n' roll! What he say? Come on. Go ahead! Make my semester! Very smart, Latello! Latello! Come on. Put it down. Would you put it down? - Who are these guys? - Mutants from after the apocalypse. Let's get outta here. - Come on! - l don't need this. We're gonna get flamed by something that don't exist yet! Not in our dimension, but with relativity. - Relativity? Shut up, you fat toad. - Come on, Vinnie! - lf it weren't for him we wouldn't be here. - Look, up the stairs and we're at the lab. - Yeah. Or on flippin' Pluto! Come on! - What is that? - l don't know. My ears are ringing like the ''Gong Show''. l can't hear nothing. And l don't see that neither. - Sherman? - Got me, Mike. Terrific! The answer man is stumped. This plant has been extinct for 60 million years. Yeah? Well, l ain't never seen one before. - You gonna make it, Vinnie? - Me? l'm so scared l'm thinkin' about God. lt's God-funking-zilla!

We get Ellie and get outta here. Let's go! What are you doin'? Let's go! Ready? Ready! Hit the dirt! - Cover me. - Don't get too close to the gizmo, Mike. Ellie! - He's been sucked up. - Shut up. You're making me nuts. You're making me crazy! Ellie? Ellie? - Look, he's got her, Sherman. - He's got her! - ls she OK? - She don't look too good, Sherman. Ellie? - Ellie, l'm so sorry. lf l only knew. - OK, Sherman. - Can you walk? - The question is, can you run? Yeah. Yeah, l can. OK. Let's go. Come on. Yeah.

Mikey, this is no time for romance here. Scaramouche! Let's go! You thought you heard what? Watch out. Come on, clear out of here. lt's dangerous. Keep moving. Stand back. You know, Sherman? You're all right. For a wimp virgin, l mean. Coming from a greaseball like you, l take that as a real compliment. Listen. No one says nothin' about this. OK? Yeah, OK. All right. - OK, kids. Get outta here. - Easy, easy. l'm comin'! - So it's out, right? - Hell, no! We won't go! Hell, no! We won't go! Chicago! - Mr Roberts? - Bob? Flower-power children, Beatle concerts, anti-war rallies. l'll be dipped in shit! - What happened? - l was blasting through on a tour of the '60s. l didn't know what even to say, man! l mean tripping trip, man! - What's your name, cowboy? - Robert Roberts esquire to you, honky! That a fact? Well, Miss Esquire, where the hell have you been? Woodstock - oinker! - Woodstock? - What's Woodstock? - OK, Captain Kirk. - lt's not Boston Pops! - You got an A in your science project. - l do? On one condition. Get rid of the gizmo. The world is not ready for space and time. lt's only for such rare individuals as myself. And the future is a groove, man! l made sure of that. lt's a funky high! - Get in the car. - Easy on the fringe, Kojak! We're outta gas. Well, it's lucky we're close to town. l mean, we can walk it. Wait a second, Michael. lf we walked into town, the world would know that your car broke. lt's just a car. Right? Right. What are you looking at? Girls, what's for lunch? Hey, girls! Boola! Boola! - Dykes. - You little weasel! Work harder! Keep on! Cut! Wake up! Even extras are actors. We're not making a ghost film now. Though you guys play the roles of pedestrians, but your roles still have life and soul. Especially we've chance to act with the Kungfu actress Queen Cuckoo Tu. so we should grasp this chance. Act smartly, OK? Action! Cut! - Who are you? - I'm an actor. Aunt Ha! Yes. - Who is this guy? - An extra. I'm an actor. Are you mistaken? How can you let him touch my machine? Sorry, Brother Sunny, I just went to toilet. so I asked him to do the rehearsal. Find someone who knows how to act, we need one urgently. - Let me do it. - You? Show me the expression of "nervous". There're several kinds of nervous expression. The one on the face of a husband whose wife is delivering a baby. The baby is given birth. But the wife is dead. The baby calls him dad, he's a genius. His dick is on his head, he's abnormal. He wins Mark Six.first prize! His son is dead. His wife comes back to life. His wife comes back to life. No more response, if one is struck too hard emotionally. he will enter a state of mental coma, he'll show no response. Is there another guy? Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong? I don't know what you were doing. Was there anything wrong with my expression? I've said I didn't know what you were doing. Aunt Ha, none of your extras is smart enough. All these extras are above standard. Sunny, is it done? Everyone is waiting. OK.Director, it'll soon be done. - You, go and change your clothes. - Thanks. - Stand in this position. - Got it. - Lighting. - Lighting is ready. - Settings. - Settings ready. Actors. Stand-by. Sorry, Director. According to the character of my role. I want to play my role with a bit of naughtiness. But contradiction. Will this be better? OK, Speed. Speed. - Scene 3. Shot 4, take 1. - Action! Cut! What is it? What's wrong with the guy behind. He's supposed to be dead. - What are you doing? Aunt Ha! - What is it? Brother Sunny? What is your extra up to? How come you are still alive? As I said I'd play my role with a bit naughtiness. So subconsciously I don't want to die yet. You must pretend to be dead. Actually, I was dying. If you give me a bit more time, I'll die eventually. Do you know how many frames of film are there in one second? 24 frames, Sister Cuckoo. Do you know how long is the shot just then? I guess it about one minute. Do you know as you didn't want to die. that you've wasted how many seconds, how many frames and how much money and how much time and effort of everyone here? Are you fooling around here? I'm begging you, you'd better find a professional extra for this role. Get someone smarter and shoot again! You'd better be smart! Go home and think about when exactly you want to die. OK, Brother Sunny. Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong? Don't ask me again, I really don't know what you were doing. - Then l. - Get lost. You remind me I must go to a meeting of Neighbour Welfare Association. I'll be right back. You don't have to come back. I'm begging you, stop making trouble. Let the director watch your performance? Director, what kind of performance? You are shot to dead, ready. Action! Was it OK, Director? This is it, go and change your clothes. - Go ahead. - Thanks. Where did you learn acting, man? - I've never learnt it. - You're a real genius. You can make it if you work hard. Why are you still standing here? Fuck off! What are you doing here? Unit manager, I want to get a lunch box only. It's not yet lunch time. - As I'm leaving now, so l. - Then you just go! Do you know why it's not yet lunch time? Just because of you, bastard, you didn't want to die! And now everyone is working and starving. I haven't eaten as well! Do you want to have lunch? Share your lunch with that puppy! Shit, you're a dump of shit. Your life is cheaper than ants. I ride a Mercedes, you pick your nostril. You want to have lunch? You better eat shit! Why did you just come back now? - You guys have lunch already? - Shut up, get me a ping pong racket. OK! Where's the ping pong ball? Get me one now. Quick. - Right away. - Hurry. This is Neighbour Welfare Association. You mustn't be late, many people are waiting for you. Hello, Aunt Ha? Nothing, I want to check the time for tomorrow notice. You haven't for tomorrow. What about the day after tomorrow? Nothing for the day after tomorrow and so on. Aunt Ha, where are you? None of your business, what do you want? I check with you again, is there notice for role without dialogue? No. - Any role that can't be seen clearly? - No. Any role that can't he seen completely? I can't see you now. Don't trouble me. - Aunt Ha, where are you? - Go to hell! Dear fellows. The play "Thunder Storm" is adapted from a well-known Chinese classic literature. You guys all know it well. Tomorrow, I'll be leading actor, you guys want to see it, right? So, I'll see you guys tomorrow then. Kelly, is there anything to do after dinner tomorrow? Taking a dump. Come and watch Uncle San's play after taking a dump, it'll be fun. Remember to bring your dad and mom too. If they don't come, you can cry, spit around. Do whatever you can until they come, then you'll be a good girl. I pamper you, Kelly. Kelly, if I don't see you tomorrow. You'll result like this doll. You get that? Uncle Chi, the play "Thunder Storm" will be on show tomorrow night. Have you studied the script well? Yes, don't worry. I can even compose a song. Old Master sings whenever he sees the maid. You're beautiful. Uncle Chi, I'm the one who sing the theme song. And the role of "Old Master" you play is a Chinese as well. When the maid sees the Old Master, she will sing. You're so handsome, you're so smart. - Thank you much, please to. - Uncle Chi, please don't. - I accept you. - Are you OK? Think positive, Uncle Chi. Someone helps me, come on. Master Hung, morning. My play "Thunder Storm" will soon be showing. Shall we make another rehearsal? Do I need to rehearsal? "Thunder Storm" is about righteous, I knew it. We're triad society member, we only talk about two things. First, about righteous, second, about money. I'll talk about righteous first. "Righteous" is good, but we mustn't ignore the love line of the story. Because the role you play will finally be struck to death. Talking about "struck" (chopping), let me tell you. There are two kinds of "struck" (chopping) in our world. First, it is "dragging". Second is "stabbing". Look, this scar was dragged by knife. While "stabbing" is like this. This scoundrel is new comer, sorry, he shows no expression. "Stabbing" is like this. Be serious, let us know if you feel the pain, OK? Your acting is lousy. Brother Sau, teaching him for me. Talking about "pain". according to Stanislavski, master of acting from Russia. Pain is transmitted from your body to the inside, and outside again. Let try one more time. Look, it's much better this time. Isn't it? He acts much better now. Let's try one more time. Right, a little bit more, more, being stabbed. Maybe I can help you this way. This is working, tears come out now. Look clearly, remember this expression, remember this feeling. Do remember this, get it? Let's go. What about own "Thunder Storm" tomorrow. No rehearsal needed for "Thunder Storm". We will come for sure, promise is a promise! I'll bring hundreds of people to watch your play as well. - It's a deal. - Just don't worry. Faster. Get into position. Granny, you stepped on someone. I didn't step on anyone. You just couldn't feel when you stepped on him, look at his foot. Yes, he's sweating as well. Give me some money and I'll send him to the hospital. I have no money. Look at him, he's dying. I only have $100 left. Give me, that $100. Let's move! Granny, you've dropped some money. Really good luck. Sir. - Are you free tomorrow? - What is it? "Thunder Storm" is on show at Neighbour Theatre. "Thunder Storm"? Good! Miss, what's your name? Piu, and you? This is your name, really? Whatever I told you, just call me Piu, idiot? You're really a student? Sure I am, I'm still a virgin, isn't that great? It's your luck, Uncle. Let's play 'Chai Fist'? I don't know how to play it. You don't know 'Chai Fist'? Have you been educated? Fanny, come here. Your belly is really big! Mind you can't get into the coffin. 'Chai Fist', Bingo! Come on, relax, have some fun. Cheer up, why did draw your face? Your parents are dead or something? Chai Fist', Bingo! Triangle, rectangle, four! Good, I'll drink! Tonight is College Girls' First Love Evening. So please mind your words, do behave like a student girl. If clients complain about you again, then I can't help you anymore. What College Girl? Just a damned trick. If I can be a college girl, I won't be working here. You believe you did nothing wrong? Mamasan, the man at Table 7 is really ugly. I can't stand it and I am not doing business with him. Do you all want to be selecting on clients? No. You're too much. You are not professional, you can concentrate on one single. One single spot? If that man is ugly, you needn't look at him. If his ears are pretty, just stare at his ears. If his mouth is ugly but the teeth are nice, just look at his teeth. So you new comer are really ignorant. Let me deal with him. Come on, watch what I'll do. Be smart. Hi! You're pretty. What's your name, Boss? My name is Pierre. It's a French name. Are everyone says I look like a Frenchman, so I get a French name. If you can't pronounce that well, just call me Pi or Erre. What's on? You used to be proud, now you get a lesson. You can't blame me, he's a real rarity. Have you seen anyone put a cockroach on his head? What's the problem? Look at LuLu, she's playing with that cockroach now. I admit failure. OK, from now on, you won't have clients to sit at. You'll be bored to death. You're all like this. Connie, come and teach her for me. You're not amateur, you should know you must act in front of clients. But your problem is: your acting stinks. I can do nothing about it. I hear someone teaches acting for free. I'll take you to see him. Teaches acting? - Hey, men. - Yes! Hurry up, start working. You again? Morning, Brother Sunny. Aunt Ha! I'm looking for him too. I haven't given you a notice, what brings you here? Remember last time that you asked me to think about the ways to die. I've thought over and I have some new ideas now, and I believe my performance will make you satisfied. I would have killed you in the past. Talking about knife, it's different from a gun. The position of the wound is usually under the armpit, here. The wound is a bit bigger, and the face will twist more. If you're betrayed by your own friends, you will even. I didn't expect.it's you. Get lost! Brother Sunny, l. I just want to act, give me a chance please. Do you love standing here? OK, stand here, I won't pay you a dime. I'll act even if you don't pay me, I only want a lunch box. But lunch box costs money too, beat it! Sunny. What is it, Martial Art Director? It's bad to use this mannequin to disguise as a dead man. Figure it out, we're in a hurry! Yes, OK.got it. Thank you, Brother Sunny. Only a lunch box. No problem, should I put some make up on? Put it on now. Director, the actors are ready. Actors are all ready. Action! Cockroach. Let's help sister Cuckoo. Cockroach! Go to hell! Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid. Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid, it's OK now. Director, can we cut now? It's still running? Cut! - OK. - Are you OK? Must you do all these to kill a cockroach! Let's see if he's alright? I'm fine, Sister Cuckoo, thanks for your concerns. Why don't you move at all? I didn't move since Director hasn't shouted 'cut' yet. So I mustn't move. Do you hear that. He keeps on acting since the Director hasn't shouted 'cut' yet. This is what I always tell you: professionalism. What's your name? I'm called Wan Tin Sau. - Yee, give him a cup of coffee. - Yes. - Get his phone number for me. - Yes. You.work in my team from now on. Thanks, Sister Cuckoo. - Is this shot OK? - Yes. Weapon comes. - Sunny. - Yes. I am telling you, even extras are important. The one who played the father, we mustn't use him again. Got it, Sister Cuckoo. Sister Cuckoo, I am the one who played the Father. In fact, it is like this. Fine. Let me clean it for you, towel, get the towel. - Sister Cuckoo! - Watch out! Sister Cuckoo, are you alright? Don't touch. Don't touch! Very pretty. Sister Cuckoo! Security guard, is there someone here who teaches acting? I've been in the field of art for ages. Whether it's movie or TV, I'm experienced. I was the creative director in Amusement Park Theatre. So I can sing and dance. You mean you are the instructor here? Well, many people here love theatre and play. They love studying plays with me. Those people introduce us here indeed. OK, this way please. It's you? Didn't you play in that film.that. The stupid man standing behind, falls after stepping on a banana peel? You noticed my performance too? You idiot! Only an idiot will fall after stepping on a banana peel. - Why don't you go dying? - Thanks. - Are you really that stupid? - You're flattering me. You damned extra, you are. In fact, I am an actor. That way please. Damned extra. What can I do for you? Frankly, we're hostesses of a night club. I can tell. We're holding "College Girls' First Love Evening" right now. These girls dare to say they don't have the feeling of first love at all. How can you work like this? First love was shown at the stage when we where babies. Say, when a baby sees a comforter, he wants to suck it. This is a kind of love. Why did you suck a comforter? You damned extra. In fact, I am an actor. Well, so why did you talk about sucking a comforter? I'm going to explain everything to you. OK, let's explain it. First, you must dress up like a college girls, about dialogue, at some vital points. such as: I love you, I hate you, etc. It'll be more impressive if you have some tears in your eyes. Just like this. Do you see? That teardrop. Good, the teardrop is inside the eyes. Where is the teardrop? You damned extra. In fact, I am an actor. You might need something to help you since you've no experience, and the simplest way is to eat Wasabi. Wasabi? What are you talking about? Must we be fooled by this damned extra? Miss, if you must call me an extra, you don't need to add 'damned' in front of it. In fact, being club girls. If you can show some respect to the others, then. - What are you calling us? - Excuse me. Forget it, we are club girls indeed. I just don't like him calling me that way. She's always like this, never mind her. It's OK. I've asked you not to stir up trouble! It's OK. It's OK. Why must you still behave like this? Don't panic, it's alright. - Don't panic, it's alright. - Club girls? It's alright.Don't panic, take it easy, it's alright. How could I know he's so amusing? I brought you there as I thought he charged for nothing. If you hadn't blocked my way, I'd have. Please, beware what you say to the clients. - Go out. - I'm sorry. What's going on? This is a big night club. Get lost, I'm sorry. - Are there other hostesses? - Yes, they're coming soon. Connie, come here. What is it, Mama Debra? Master Lung is here and he's drunk. He thought he's being dumped and he wants his first lover back. All the girls here are college girls, they'll suit him. Look, he has scanned almost all my girls. But none of them suits his taste, he's nuts. Look at his money, it's piled up. - Have you gone inside? - Not yet. Wait here for a while. Go and send some more girls here. I have so much money. Come and get it if you can. I want my first lover. First lover! You wanna try? I'll give it a shot, sometimes it's hard to tell the taste of a rich man. Get lost. Hurry up, be smart. Master Lung, here come the beauties. Say Hi to Master Lung. Boss. Get lost! - Master Lung, don't get mad. - Go away! None of them is pretty! They are not sincere, I want my first lover! First lover. They're all here for money! I am sincere. I really love you. Mary, I'll give you anything you want. I can give you all the money on the table. as long as you don't leave me, Mary. - What is it? - Are you alright? I've hit you hard, sorry. If that table wasn't there and I could kick you, I wouldn't have been defeated by you. I'm not here to fight with you, I'm here to learn acting from you. Go away. To some honest friends who have the same interest as I do. I'll be more than willing to teach them. Just a second. I'm coming, 1, 2, 2 and a half, 3. Must it take you so long for make up? You damned. Don't again! - Your tie is high-classed. - Thanks. Since I've taken your money, I should act accordingly. - Where's the ping pong racket? - Under the table. There're many people here, let's go over there. I'm Wan Tin Sau, and you? Lau Piu Piu. What do you want to learn? How to pamper those bastards in the night club. The first love feeling of college girls must be built from the base. You can take me as your client, and greet me first. Boss, want some fist games? Don't call me "Boss", you're college girl now. You can say Good Morning, or Morning, Sir. Good morning, Sir. Try to lower your head a little bit, pretend to be shy. Let your client touches your chin and raise your head and then say. Morning, Sir. Your regards are bad, again. Give me glistened regards. Morning, Sir. Too glistened now, I'll faint, again. Take it easy. Morning, Sir. These are eyes of dead body, you'll scare others to death. Again. Be natural. Morning, Sir. Good! Now let's discuss about your action, say, hugging. Hug me with your way. What for? What for? You needn't lock others with your thigh every time. - Sorry, my job requires this. - You must stop doing that. Being a college girl, you needn't always take initiation. You can act shyly so that men will hug you. What do you mean by shy? Like this. - Like biting a quail? - Act on. Right, when men see you biting a quail, they'll naturally hold and hug you. Now you can put your head on their shoulders. What for? Excuse me, my job requires this. You must stop doing that! Superficially it's all. If we go further, I must then ask you about your first love. I never have first love. Everyone has first love. I said I never have one. You must have some unforgettable memory. No. Or you must have heard someone say something you can never forget. Never! I hope I can be with you forever. Promise me, let me take care of you for the rest of your life. Then you must have unforgettable experience. Never! Being club girl? Didn't say you'll take care of me? How come I have money if you don't work as club girl? How can I take care of you if I have no money? Now, imagine I'm your first boyfriend lover. Sau, on the night of your play, I was engaged in a transaction. So I was too busy to come, sorry. - Was there good response? - Sure. It's good then. I will surely come next time. Someone's shooing kids karaoke, you aren't one of them? I've things to see you, excuse me. Take me new boy to collect protection money for me. Help me improve his appearance. About the way he speaks? Right, that's it, you won't refuse my request, right? Thanks for teaching me. Over there. Being a triad member. you must have a unique appearance. It's right you have a gold chain with you. You must try to look furious and severe. Try it. More furious. Show some anger. Wrath. Throw that nibble away. This is it, you know what you're going to say? I seem to know. Good, I'll remind you from time to time in this dim place. Tong, over here a bit, right, cheer up. - Shooting a movie? - What is it? I forget already. You know, HK is in economic recession. And being hit by financial storm, it's all because of the 'Ross'. There are many factors. Now the S.E. Asia collapses in economics. and that infects HK too. Those enterprises suffer much. The worse is there'll be global economics recession soon. You have a view in economics. I majored Economics in HKU. Did you? I graduated this year. Did you?

What's wrong? That scoundrel is still there. Concentrate! you're scoundrel too, show some anger! I want to eat ice-cream. Bastard! Show some anger! You needn't do that. Forget it, I fear you now. What's up? You acted very well. What has happened? He acted really well to get this. He managed to collect $20. Why are you still crying? You managed to get $20 protection money in front of a temple. You're making a fame for yourself. You do look like a hero. Keep the image and use it to collect protection money now. Brother Sau, you're competent, great! You're flattering me.

Beside responding with the hot fire, Can I show an expression of cool loneliness? As you like, As long as you don't turn your face to the camera, get it? Got it. Light the fire, just don't move. Ready. Who put the pigeons here? Director, I put them here intentionally. There're pigeons here in our last shot. If the pigeons fly, they'll stir up the fire. - Take them away. - Director. The mood of this shot will be better if the pigeons are there. How much better? It's hard to say, it's something abstract. Anyway, the mood will be better. Put them up and let's see the effect. That stunt man mustn't turn his head! Director, how do you like it? It's a bit better. Let's try the effect with the pigeon's head towards me. Now put the pigeon's tail towards me. Take it away. Ready. It's better without the pigeons, take it away. Ready. Where's my lighter? Man, bring me a lighter? Director, here it is. - Really? - Yes. - It works? - Yes. Hurry, quick, ready! Ready, keep your posture, don't move. Roll, action! What is it? What's wrong with you? You screwed up every time! Sorry, Brother Sunny, it's very hot here.

Why must you always jump in me? - You want to know the reason? - I want to know the reason. Because you're not entitled to eat this lunch box! You thought you're talented and teach others acting. You always talk about theory. You teach someone to be a triad member and collect protection money. You're indeed insulting the word 'acting'! Don't shout on, let's get to work. You talk about 'acting' in front of me? Shit! Damn it! They dare to collect protection money from those 2 ice-cream cars? I'm the protector of those 2 ice-cream cars. They don't respect me at all. Men, get some weapons and teach them a lesson. Sau, come with us. You can experience how we fight for our right, and keep guard for us as well. Men, let's go. Little Hung, where are you going? Granny, where are you doing here? You're getting better with you tuberculosis. So mind you catch a cold, have you taken your medicine? Yes, you're going to fight with someone again? No. Don't go. I'm not fighting with anyone. - Don't go fighting. - I'm not. Granny, he isn't going to fight, he's going to act in a play. That Neighbour Theatre, we're playing "Thunder Storm". "Thunder Storm"?

Because there're fighting scenes, audience will like it. The story is consisted of blood and tears. Speaking of blood and tears, I wonder if my spine is injured.

How come it is here so quick? Is it well done? Ask the cook for that, $39.8 please! - I'll pay. - No need. Why not? Let me pay. - I've said I'll pay. - It's alright. I will pay. You pay next time, it's my bill. No.don't do that. Let me treat you this time! Just $40 and you two push around and around. Why don't you pay by credit card, asshole! What did you say, bastard? Don't move, either you pay now or I'll take it back. Or I'll pay for you. What are you doing? I've said many times, why don't you walk closer? Walk closer and shoot him from the top. Then blood won't splash on the wall. You never listen to me. Can't you be a professional? But delivery boys are very rude these days. They are always like this. Let's eat. Who is it? I'm here to deliver some food. Go and take a look, Chu. How are you, I'm here to delivery some food. OK. Steamed rice with tomato and egg, $25.5 please. You ordered that? No, I haven't. You haven't ordered? Have you come to the wrong place? - No.7. - No.7? It's No.1, send it to No.1. Do you still want it? Are you out of your mind, I didn't order it. Rice with tomato and egg? What do you mean? Are you nuts, Go away. You want rice with tomato and egg, I'll take it. No, someone else ordered it. I said I want it, come here. Come here! Can you give it to us first? What a coincidence! No.1 also ordered rice with tomato and egg. Is tomato and egg good? The egg and tomato are both nutritious. What do you mean nutritious? It contains a lot of Vitamin C. Other fruits contain that too. Other fruits don't contain as much as tomato. You don't want the money? $25.5 please. How come it's so expensive? - It's one and a half order. - How much for one order? $36.8. How come it is more expensive? It's 12.2 for one order. And how much for one and a half order? $36.8. You just said $25.5. It's $25.5. What was served for breakfast this morning? What? What was served for breakfast this morning? Ham and egg. How much is it? $12.2. How much if I want one and a half order? $25.5. How come there is one and a half order for breakfast? You can order two extra sausages. How much if I want 3 extra sausages? Don't do that. How much is it? I'm only a delivery boy. I ask you how much it is. I don't know. How much? I'm really a delivery boy! You are not! Kid, tell us frankly, are you a delivery boy? - I've just started work today! - Just started work today? I didn't know being delivery boy must answer so many questions. Don't fucking fool me? What are you doing? Are you a cop? Yes, what's wrong? I'm really a delivery boy. Nothing.he's an idiot. Search him if you don't believe. Search him! Kid, I let you go now, be smart in future! What is it? Why did you do this? What do you want? What is it? Want to harm me? Sorry, I'm an undercover. Cut. How's that? I'm fine, I'm still alive. I mean my performance. Very well, as this is your first time being the leading actor. Good take. Thanks. I'll call to police. - Police! - Freeze! He's on my side. Call the ambulance! Piu Piu. What's going on? It's dark already, and you didn't give me a call? - Shall I cook dinner for you? - Just then l. What's happen to you? Didn't you play as the leading actor? I don't care whether you're a leading actor or an extra. You must support my living forever. Come on, try it and see if it suits or not. Red? Is it lipstick? You're dating someone else? I forgive you but. I won't cook for you if you dare next time, go! What are you looking at? Fight back, nuts! Piu Piu, I love you. Wait You two mustn't get married! Why? Because you guys are brother and sister. Sister, I'm sorry. It's not your business, I'm willing myself. Your mood is wrong for this situation. I've told you before. Mood begins from your heart, then goes to the outside of your body. and returns to the heart, got it? - Yes, got it. - Don't be nervous. I'm not nervous. Sau, I think the role of Master suits you more. Why don't you play it? Forget it, I'm not talented in acting. I'd better be audience. Not at all. You're good. Brother Sau, audience are waiting outside. - Are they? - Hurry up. - Take off your clothes first. - For what? I'll play it. - Oh, no. - Give it to me. But you're not talented. I'm not? Are you talented then? I am. Give it to me! - No. - Sau, stop fighting. Stop fighting, eat potato chips, why fighting for? There're really many audience. Sure, as we have special guests today. Sister Cuckoo comes to help us today. Thanks, Sister Cuckoo. You're welcome, we finally have the chance to act on the same stage. Thanks! Kung Hei Fat Choi! Thanks! Happy New Year. Congratulations! Everybody cheer up. Thanks! Kung Hei! It's been a long time since I last wrote. but because of my shoulder. I find it difficult to lift a pen. So I recorded this cassette for you. my son in America. It will save you lots on phone bills, too. My shoulder has been hurting since menopause began. They say after two more years, it won't hurt anymore. So, Pa has retired from the Army, and now he's acting strange. Before he was a general. in charge of thousands of troops. Now he's here at home. commanding only me and old Chang. and he's getting very cranky. It's hard for him to run things. Maybe it's because I'm getting old, and he's getting older. and you're not getting any younger yourself. When will you marry? You know, Pa came from China to Taiwan by himself. and you're his only precious son. So don't be such a snob! Last week we enrolled you into Taipei's best singles club. and they'll send you a computer form. for you to describe your ideal woman. All their girls have impeccable backgrounds. They are well-educated, well brought up. elegant and very attractive. like Mrs. Quian's daughter, the one you refused to marry. Please, son. Don't be so choosy. Relax. Stretch. As a great Chinese poet once said: What's that supposed to mean? If you don't Zen out, you'll be murdered by your physical therapist. Simon, there's a call for you. Hello. If I give you $1, will you stop playing for a minute? - Simon? - Yeah, where are you? In the city. Come here and meet me. I'll take you out to dinner. You're still mad? It's just we've been planning this trip for months. All you had to do was tell me. But I can't control when zoning boards meet. We'll get time together, I promise. Just come home tonight, okay? We'll talk about it later. Sure. I'm going by the Williamsburg Building first. I'll be home by 7:00. Wai Tung! Wow! What a coincidence! You live in Brooklyn? No, in Manhattan. What are you up to? Last time I saw you was before my operation. They put 33 different wires, but you can hardly notice. only the skin graft. Sorry, but I'm late. Call me sometime. Yeah, let's get together. Just like the old days. You're eating too fast. I'm nervous. If they let me convert the Hudson building, I'll make millions. If not, we couldn't even afford a vacation in the Poconos. What's the point of being able to afford a vacation. if you won't even take time off to have one? Speaking of which, Steve and Andrew just got back from Belize. They hated the hotel. Was that the one we were going to stay in? So I guess it's great we didn't go. Simon, I'm really sorry. But I've made up my mind. I'm taking you to Paris in September, right after the zoning hearing. It will be a birthday present. You're such a jerk. Hey, you homo! What are you doing in this neighborhood? Hello. Don't joke about it. You know the Witchells down the street? Check them out. Cute. Do you and the mighty Wai want to go shoot some hoops later, maybe around 2:00? Wai has to run into Williamsburg and deal with some tenant stuff. I might be able to make it though. - I'll call you. - Just show up. - See you. - Bye. If they're not off the sidewalk by 10:00, I get a ticket. - Sorry, boss. - You're sorry? Those tickets cost me $175. If I get another one, it's coming out of your salary. Who is it? The nasty landlord. This floor has been liberated. but since you're so handsome, you may come in. This is not rent. Simon says these will be worth a lot some day. Simon is not the landlord, and I don't know modern art. But you like me. It's my fate. I always fall for handsome gay men. Bullshit! Don't try to trade paintings for rent. What a racket! It's to block the noise. I can't concentrate. - You like Taiwanese music? - Anything to block the noise. What's this painting called? "Heat." And if you shut it off, the whole building will be without hot water. Then don't touch it. Can't you fix it? It's so hot in here. How am I to live like this? It's not a living space. That's why the rent is so low. I've tried it for a year. It's stuck. What's this? My depression special. You're really that poor? Just depressed. Immigration showed up at work yesterday. Luckily I got there late. As usual. Yes. They got Emily. If they get me, I'll be meeting Emily in Shanghai. Emily was my best friend. Now I've lost my job and my friend. I'm sorry. You have no relatives here? They sponsored me. I can't trouble them again. I'm not like you, rich. American citizen. I'm not as rich as you think. All my money is stuck in here. Then thanks for the extra investment in my loft. Actually, I kind of like this one. It's pretty good. I'll take it as rent. for the last two months also. Thank you, Wai Tung. Okay. When will you fix the sink? Say hi to Simon. Simon's lucky to have a handsome and rich boyfriend. Ask him to get me one, too, then I'll pay the rent. My perfect woman. What? Another one? Don't those things cost a fortune? Yes, but how can I tell them to stop paying for them? Why don't you just tell them? Shit. No, really, Wai. Someday, I'm just going to call your father and tell him myself. I told mine. Look at yourself. Your parents send you a form in the mail. and you practically pee your pants. You are an adult. As a matter of fact, you're practically middle-aged. Fuck you! - Let me check this out. Education, right? - Yes. - She must have a Ph.D. - No, two Ph. Ds. One in Physics. - And she should be an opera singer. - And 6 feet tall. Let's not go overboard. She's Chinese, after all. 5 foot 9 inches. - And she should speak five languages. - Good. You're right. It's kind of stupid, all these lies. But I'm used to it. - I got you a little present. - Me? Why? Shut up and open it. For the busy entrepreneur. Go ahead, try it. Hello. - Thanks. - You're welcome. I love you. I love you, too. Yeah. But if I sell it to the S-Corporation. and they reappraise the building, it'll kill me at tax time. Fax this to Chow. Okay, I'll sign it if you say so. But if it costs me, it's coming out of your salary. Boss, Miss Wei Wei called complaining about the heat. Heat? What heat? It's June. Son, you must be surprised to get another cassette so soon. I have good news. Your singles club found a near match for you. She's 5" 8" tall. and although she only has one doctorate degree. she is also an opera singer. and she speaks five languages. Dad and I are going to give you a surprise. We're flying her to New York so you can meet her. Her name is Wu Ren Ren, but everyone calls her Little Sister Mao. She'll be staying with her cousin in New York. and will arrive in two weeks. Please pick her up at the airport. Aren't you excited? We are. I'm exhausted. Sorry to put you out. Sister Mao, how's your dad, Mr. Mao. I mean Mr. Wu. He's fine, thank you. You have your cousin's address? Of course! I'm not a kid. I know. Sister Mao, your luggage is so heavy! Why didn't you use cargo? I did! Half the stuff here is for you from your mother. I'm sorry. I'll buy you dinner tonight for that. So heavy! Where's your car? First time in America? No. I sang at the San Francisco Opera for two years. Opera, yes. - Are you a fan? - Yes. Pavarotti. Nothing. The service here is lousy. So, you've met my parents? Your mom. Your dad was still in the hospital. Hospital? When? About two weeks ago. He had a stroke. Didn't you know? No, nobody told me. I'm sorry. Me and my big mouth. Your mom probably didn't want you to worry. No. Thanks for letting me know. Your mom told me that when they took him in the ambulance. there was a huge traffic jam. He was in pain, really suffering. She thought he was going to die. but he hung on. for one last wish. What wish? To hold his grandchild. He'll be fine, don't worry. May I take your order? Wei Wei, you got a new job? What's it to you? This is Miss Wu. Just arrived from Taipei. She's an opera singer. Wei Wei is a squatter. A tenant of mine. I spoke to Simon on the phone. Simon? How's he doing? He likes the painting I gave you. He told me you had some family business to attend to today. Is this it? Does Simon know? It's not what you think. You told me you're gay and I believed you. Why didn't you just tell me I'm not your type? Is there some kind of problem here? Poor Simon. I pity him! Hey, wait. Shit! Why don't they quit after dinner? Why did you join the singles club? I didn't. Like you, my mom did it. I have a white boyfriend, and I don't have the guts to tell them. Really? - Where did you learn to sing? - Dong Wu University. You don't speak like a singer. One doesn't speak like one sings. Is that so? - Are you really an opera fan? - No. Thought so. Pity. What is it, three more flights? You must forgive me. I'm so ashamed. When Simon told me the story. I felt like jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge. No, it's for me to apologize. You've been having so many troubles, and all I do is pressure you for rent. Here. I brought you an air conditioner. But the electricity costs? Out of work again. I'm such a fool. Always hoping you'll like me. Anyway, Wai and I would like to invite you out to dinner. - It will be my farewell dinner. - Your what? Really. I can't last any longer. No money, no job, no green card. No stupid American will marry me. What about Boris? I thought he was gonna marry you. He was. But he wanted $5,000. What! What about Andre, that guy you were seeing? He wanted to marry me, too, but it turns out he's Albanian. and doesn't have a green card himself. I'm such an idiot. I said forget about it. Don't you see? This way Wei Wei can stay here and paint. and you can finally get your parents off your back. Forget about it. We can move her into the basement until the immigration exam. Take some photos, send them back to your mom and dad, and perfect! Forget it. And as a married couple, you'll be able to take a big tax break. Got it? We'll back up. Wai Tung's clothes. Shirts, underwear. He wears Jockey, but he sleeps in boxers. And here, all the stuff he gets from his parents. Mega polyester, but he saves the shit religiously. The couch is his own little world. Here, piles of unread magazines. World Trade, Advocate, UW, and Fortune. He's such a disgusting yuppie. And, of course, the phone, which he hogs like a total pig. Extra pillows, 'cause he likes to drop off to sleep here. Sometimes I have to carry him up to bed. He showers in the morning unless he goes to the gym. which is if he's in a bad mood or we've had a fight. He doesn't smoke or drink, unless we fought or he's in a mood bad. No junk food either. Unless you've been fighting or he's in bad mood. On his right side? The birthmark is on his right side, the mole is on his left side. Do the questions really get this personal? - Yes, they do, and if you don't pass. - I'll pass. Let's see, today's Friday. You're wearing blue Jockey shorts. Hello. Ma? Hello, how are you? How's Pa? You got my letter? Like I've told you, I've been dating Wei Wei for two years. She's from the mainland, and we've decided to settle down together. I didn't tell you because I was afraid you wouldn't approve. What! You're coming here? The 15th? To arrange the wedding? No. Of course I want you to do it. It's only once in a lifetime. but with Pa's health, he shouldn't make such a long trip. What if. Don't say that. Of course you'll see your grandchild. I won't disappoint you. I was just concerned. Ma, talk to him. Tell him not to be so sensitive. Okay, I'll call tomorrow. Bye. Did you understand any of that? Unfortunately, I think so. This was your big idea. How long are they coming for? Just a short visit. Two weeks! Good night. God, I'm so nervous. Relax. The in-laws want to meet even an ugly bride. How about an ugly son-in-law? Here they come. Wai Tung! I missed you so much! - Are you tired? - Slept all the way. I'm not as lucky. But I feel better now that I see you. - Pa, you're so thin! - You look good. Where's Wei Wei? Over there. Pleased to meet you. You're prettier in person. You cut your hair? Short hair is nicer. Thanks for caring for our son. He takes care of me. We're blocking traffic. Let's leave. Allow me. Where did you find such a beauty? I placed an ad for an apartment two years ago. Twenty people answered. Wei Wei was one of them. Good. My investment paid off. What do you think? She'll make lots of babies. How long are you here? Over three years. Never been back. And your family? I have my mom, dad, and a kid brother in school. What do they do? Her Pa works at a hospital and her mom teaches art. Good. It's traditional that we bring the Gift of Four Colors. to formally propose to your parents. My parents are happy. They've seen pictures of Wai Tung. and I talk about him all the time, and they like him. but it's impossible for them to come here from the mainland. Too bad. Hi. This is Simon, my roommate and landlord. It is pleasure, Mr. And Mrs. Gao. Welcome, my home. You speak Chinese! Thank you for caring for our son and letting us stay here. - Pa, he doesn't understand. - No? A little. Tell him his home is beautiful. Shall we help you up to your room? That'd be great. How come you rent from Simon and don't live in your own building? The building is a dump. You can't live there. We are looking for a new home. We'll move after the wedding. - Nice place. - Yeah, the air is fresh. Now that you're getting married, I've got something to tell you. You know why I went into the Army? Because you wanted to fight with General Chiang against the Japanese. No. I had to run away, so I joined the Army. Your grandpa arranged a marriage. I got angry and just took off. We fought the Japs and the Communists. and then I went to Taiwan. One day, a relative escaped and brought a letter from grandpa. that said the Gao family was gone. and it was up to me to continue the family name. I can't tell you how I feel. about being at your wedding! You should have stayed home and rested. You want to take a bath before dinner? You'll feel better. Stir-fry it a little bit longer and then drain the juice. - Thanks for cooking. - It's nothing. - Feeling better? - Yes! - Where's Pa? Dinner is ready. - He's coming. I'll set the table. They're over there. Wai Tung is lucky. He found a girl who can cook. Today that's rare. When did I write this? Two years ago. It's my favorite, that's why it's in the living room. This is very good. Not one bad stroke. Not easy to do. Pa, dinner is ready. See how this compares to Old Chang's cooking. Of all your scrolls, this is my favorite. It's really great art. How so? The Wang Hsi Zhi school emphasizes harmony and nature. Your Wang style of calligraphy reflects a beautiful structure. combined with unrefined purity. Bei Qu Yi's poem and your writing flow naturally. That art is not often attained. And every stroke is perfect. That shows your steadiness. It's a sign of longevity. She's more expert than you, son. Of course. She's an art student. - Food is getting cold. Let's eat. - Wei Wei, we're so much trouble. Not at all. It's something I want to do. Pa, taste the shredded tofu, see if you like it. Very good. Right amount of soda, perfect soaking time. Just the right tenderness. - He likes it? - Yeah. Wei Wei, what an effort! Not really. I bet it's not as good as Old Chang's. Yours is better. His is too salty. What does he mean? A gift to our future daughter-in-law for taking care of our son. What's this? He is in your hands now. Then I can't refuse. We bought these pearls in Japan. Please wear them at the wedding. How beautiful! They're natural pearls, not cultured. This red coral pin is from Malaysia. It's gorgeous! This is too much! It's a bracelet. Here is my wedding Chi-Pao gown. Please try it on. Can we have it altered? Probably in Chinatown. It's a real treasure. I brought it from the mainland when I was young. This quality and workmanship, you can't find it anymore. I'll try it on. Wait, one more. This gold bracelet is from Old Chang. He's worked for us for nearly 40 years. He helped raise Wai Tung. I'm speechless. I'll try on the Chi-Pao. She likes them! And you said I shouldn't give my old things. Simon has some gifts for you. Oh, no. We are already your guests. We can't accept gifts, too! Just a little something. You, heart problems. and high pressure. This. show pressure. all times. This facial cream, special. for old ladies. Put every night, stop wrinkles. You want me to be forever young. Yes. Never get old. older. old. Look, it's perfect! Look, it fits perfectly! I knew it would fit. A mother-in-law knows. It's a spiritual bond that passes from generation to generation. You were brought together by fate. You and our son. We call that: "Fate will find you no matter how far apart." Excellent! This is Wai Tung's personal spoon. I feel great. We walked for an hour. I'll wash up. Go wake up Simon. What are you looking at? Never seen eggs before? Love muffin, time to make the doughnuts. How was my performance on the first day? About a B-plus. I don't know, we should have moved you out. I'll survive. Not if Wei Wei keeps cooking. - Breakfast time. - Okay. What are our plans today? We'll stay home this morning. You can do some calligraphy. This afternoon we'll get married. - Get married? - Who? We are. You came for our wedding, right? This afternoon? Why wait? We've prepared our marriage certificate. and we have a marriage appointment at 2:00. We planned to do it one day after your arrival. We came all this way. How can you be so casual? Ma, we're both very busy and not much for ceremonies. Besides, her parents can't make it, so why not keep it simple? This happens only once in a lifetime. Think of the bride, if not yourself. Our friends and relatives gave $30,000. to have a grand wedding. What will we tell them? - We're not marrying for them. - Lf not for them, then for whom? Ma, it's okay. A wedding banquet will not affect how we love each other. We're not into these traditions. Very well. They're adults. We'll do what they want! Why should it be like this? To have and to hold. for better, for worse. for richer, for poorer. in sickness and in health. till death do us part. Rings. Under the authority vested in me, I now pronounce you are husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Excuse me, you guys. You need to switch. You're on the outside. Good. If there's any one here who can now show just cause. why these two may not be legally married speak now, or hereafter hold your peace. Good. Now repeat after me. - "I Wee-Ton." - Wai Tung. - Okay. "Take you, Wee-Wee." - Wei Wei. - Okay. "Wei Wei, to be my wedded wife." - To be my wedded wife. "To have and to hold. "for better, for worse. "for richer, for poorer. "in sickness and in health. "till death do us part." Okay, now, you. - "I, Wee-Wee." - Wee-Wee. - ".take you, Wai Tung." - Wee-Wee. Okay. "To be my wedded husband. "To have and to hold." Holding to have, husband, mine. ".for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer." Better and richer, no poorer. ".in sickness and in health, till death do us part." Till sickness and death. Groovy. Rings. Under the authority vested in me by the State of New York. I now pronounce that you are husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. Come on. let's take picture. Smile! Happy occasion! What's the matter, Ma? It's all my fault, Wei Wei. We came all the way for nothing. We let you down with such a shabby wedding. Stop it, Ma. Don't say that. I'm so happy to marry Wai Tung. She's so upset. Why don't I offer to take you all to dinner. We'll go to the China Palace. My treat. Let them know. Simon is taking us out to celebrate. We're going to the best Chinese restaurant in Manhattan. We should be treating you. Hi, boss. How come so late? Traffic is terrible. - When did that table arrive? - Table 2C? Yes. How long? Quite a while. They've been served already. Don't give them a check. Go order two more dishes for them. General Tao Chicken and pan-fried whole fish. I'm going over. - Commander! - Old Chen! What a coincidence! America is so big and we still run into each other in a restaurant! I recognized you as soon as I came in. You're eating? No. I ate at home. Commander, this is my restaurant. Your restaurant? It's my third son's. But what is his, is mine. Congratulations! It's a beautiful restaurant. So, Old Chen, you finally made it. If it weren't for you and the Commander, I would be nothing. How ironic. Chen has a restaurant, but Old Chang doesn't. You ate so little? I ordered two more dishes for you. Next time, I'll treat you all to a whole dinner. You shouldn't do it. We're full. Now you're "Boss" Chen, right? - Please join us. - Oh, no. I'm not worthy of sitting at your table. What is this? You're an important boss now. Come on, sit. Please just call me "Old Chen." And I prefer to stand. Young master, how long have you been in America? Ten years. And please don't call me "young master," just Wai Tung. How time flies. And your friends? This is Simon, my landlord. I drove the Commander's jeep for 20 years. Hello, Uncle Chen. - And this young lady? - She's our new daughter-in-law. Young master, when did you marry? I have no gift for you. I must make it up to you. That won't be necessary. We just got married today at City Hall. Pa and Ma came for the wedding. You got married at City Hall? That's right. This is our wedding dinner. and we ran into you. Young master, I know I'm out of line. but the Commander is very well-known and respected. How could you have been so inconsiderate? I'm only a servant, but even when my third son was married. I had a banquet for 200 guests. Boss, here are the special dishes. Our food can't compare to Old Chang's. I hope the Commander won't mind. - Don't be so formal, Old Chen. - Allow me, Commander. Hey, I've got an idea! Although you kids want to be modern. what is a wedding without a banquet? So if you don't mind that my place is a bit small. and the food not so great. it would please me if I could offer it to the young master. for his wedding banquet. We have a party room and there is a hotel above. We can get a room for the newlyweds. That would be too much trouble for you. No trouble. Old Chen wants nothing better than to plan a banquet. All you have to do is show up. Look at the smile on the Commander's face. Young master, I'm not doing this for you. It's for the Commander. He's been going to other people's banquets for years. Now it's time for him to get back some of the gifts he gave. If you don't let him have this. then you're an ungrateful son. Won't this be too much trouble? Then it's decided. Commander, leave everything to me. It'll be a great banquet! You won't lose face in America! She's from Shanghai. No, it's not formal dress. Both you and Shirley are coming, right? I knew it was you. I'm in the bathroom. Just like our college days. I'm too tired to get up. And you need all your sleep for the big fucking event. Yeah, the final act. And then they're out of here. About time. I'm sick of sleeping alone. I'm sick of the whole thing. You sound tired. I am. but let's just talk some more. Okay. I didn't walk far. Only half an hour. I want to save my strength for today. Wake up Wai Tung. Come on, Mr. Groom. Time to wake up. Ma, Pa, go sit on the bed. We wish you a happy life and a long marriage. That's enough. How time flies. It seems like only yesterday you learned to talk. Son, you remember how you used to love to sleep on my tummy? I'd ask, "Where's Wai Tung?" And you used to say, "I am here." You were so chubby I wanted to eat you. And you came running. My little fat boy. - I'll get Wei Wei ready. - No, stay a bit. We won't probably get another chance. Stop it, Ma. Wei Wei? Why didn't you let us know you were calling today? Did you wait long? No, not long. Why are you calling, Wei Wei? No reason. I just missed you. Have you eaten? We were just starting dinner when the telephone clerk came to get us. We dropped everything and came here. How's the new house? Next week we'll have gas. The house faces southwest. Here's your father. Wei Wei? Get up. Wei Wei? I'm up. You get ready. - They really piled on the rocks. - No kidding. You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen. Thanks. And thank you, Sister Mao. Don't mention it. It's a pleasure to be your bridesmaid. Hurry up, it's almost 2:00. Just let me take a look. Okay, everything's fine. Let's go. Careful. Sister Mao, please get the lotus soup. - Thank you, Ma. - Thank you. We're turning Wai Tung to you. And you, Wai Tung, must care well for Wei Wei. I will. Here, a soup for a quick first son. Wei Wei, kneel for the soup. Have some lotus soup, a son will come quickly. Come on, Wai Tung. Kneel down and have some soup with me. Having a son is a female thing. She can't give birth without your help, right? You two grew up differently. But fate has united you together here so far from home. It's something you should treasure. If differences arise. opinions. habits. you must work to resolve them. Talk and understand. Always be thoughtful of each other. That's the key to a successful marriage. Your mom and I came from China to Taiwan. from an unstable place. Today, I see your generation. Seeing you two together has a special meaning for us. We give thanks to our ancestors. Wei Wei is a great artist. Wai Tung, you must help her succeed. - Don't let this marriage. - No. Don't do that. You'll ruin three hours of makeup. It'll be over soon. Don't cry. Stop talking. Everything's fine. Stop crying. How about that? My speech really touched her, huh? Yes, Pa. Would the groom raise his left shoulder? Chin up. Smile. Show your white teeth. Like you love each other. Turn a little more. White teeth. Smile a little wider. Turn some more. Okay. Smile a bit more. A bit more, a little bit more. Come, Little Rock. Jump on the bed to make a little boy like you. Chief Wang and distinguished guests. my son's marriage to Wei Wei. was very simple, sudden. and caught you by surprise. With my sincerest apologies, I thank you all for coming. - When are you going to finish? - Who's talking now? The groom's father. I got 40 minutes. That's a joke! Come on! Once more! That's it? Put some passion into it. Quiet, everybody. I'm Bob Law. Everyone calls me "the Law." I've known the groom since elementary school. I provided him with his first comic books to amuse himself in class. In high school, I took him to the best pool halls. and in college, I got him into parties to score some chicks. meet some girls. So I was his biggest influence, baddest influence. I hope you don't mind, Mr. Gao. It's just fun. And after 16 years of friendship, I learned about the wedding. only one week before. To everyone who feels as left out as me. I am accepting motions for proper punishment. Fry him. What? You have the guts to marry, but not to eat this? This is a cross-cultural event. Everything goes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Drink some more. Not so much. I know, I know. Thanks for coming. Everybody, sit down. This is wrong. You just can't toast an entire table. and just take a short sip. You must toast a full glass to each of us. We all go back a long way. That's right. Give me a break. You know I can't drink. I get drunk from beer commercials. I'll drink for him. Protecting him already? Come on, Tofu-head. if you won't drink to us. you must at least drink to Taiwan. That's more like it. We haven't seen each other for many years. I drove five hours to be here. Drink with me. I'll start first. Bottoms up. God, and I thought the Chinese were meek, quiet, math whizzes. You're witnessing the results of 5,000 years of sexual repression. After tonight, the best Chinese men in New York are gone. Those left are not worth a burned egg roll. Come, Wai Tung, bottoms up. You guys drinking or talking? Cut the crap, we can't wait any longer. Yeah. What about us? Come over here. Gao. We dare you to come over here. Let's make him drink. Gao? Isn't this the Chen wedding? The Chen wedding? That's upstairs in the Phoenix Ballroom. Thank you very much for coming. Congratulations. Get home safe. Congratulations. You all right? Yes. Yeah. I'm okay. Can you take Ma and Pa home? Yeah, I think they've had about enough of this. Mr. And Mrs. Gao, me drive home. Thank you. Pa, you overdid it tonight. Are you okay? Just happy. I'll call you tomorrow. Good night. - We are such trouble. - Was it satisfactory? Thanks. Don't even mention it. Get home safely. - Thank you. - Thank you. Good night. You okay? Room service. No. Don't open the door. Surprise. We're invading the newlywed suite. You really know how to choose a room, huh? Number 1069. I thought you passed out. Passed out? Never. And miss the Newlywed Invasion? This old glorious tradition we've now brought here. What are you doing? Dear comrade lover, we're staying here with you. The long struggle has begun. Great. Aren't you touched by such friendship? I am. Here we go. Me first. Had a bit too much, huh? Yeah, but I was so happy. - Want your pills? - Yes, I should. We'll be the next to marry. We should have more harmony. Get lost. I've got no luck. It's always the same for me. No. I can't anymore. Please spare me, guys. Okay, he's had enough. We'll leave you alone after one last game. Then we'll go. Another game? Let's do it. That's the spirit. Okay, you two get under the covers. Oh, shit. Then take off all your clothes and throw them on the floor. Only when the last piece is off, we'll go. - Where are the clothes? - Are you not man enough? I'm losing money. We play until I get it back. Every minute of a wedding night is worth 1,000 pieces of gold. That's the way. Beautiful, just beautiful. Will they be back? I don't think so. They had enough fun for one night. Wei Wei, what's your hand doing? Just resting. Don't do that. Liar. You told me women don't excite you. What the hell are you doing? I'm liberating you. No. - Bye. - Take care. Come on, there's nobody around. It's been a long time since we did it in the afternoon. What's wrong with you? Let's go to my room. You're back. Pa, you didn't go shopping? Shopping is a woman's game. It requires unlimited stamina. I can't keep up with them. So I stayed home to write. Age takes its toll. I only had a few drinks. but it has taken me three weeks to recover. Son, have you found a home yet? We can't live here at Simon's forever. You know, this gift has been very useful. Here. May I? Don't worry, Pa. As soon as your pressure is down you can go home. They're back. There's more in the car. I am exhausted. Did you rob a department store? Coming here is always a headache. So many gifts to bring back. We have been shopping for such a long time. and we haven't bought enough. Fifth Avenue is too expensive. And when we find something suitable, it's made in Taiwan. Are you tired? When Ma enters a department store, she turns into Michael Jordan. I'm not tired. You're so strong, you'll live to be 100. You must be tired. Look at the time. They arrived before you and there's no dinner. All you do is complain. These are for your friends. I'm doing your shopping. - I'm ravenous. - We could order sushi. I thought you liked sushi. You okay? I'm fine. You ready? - Yeah, let me just get my jacket. - No rush. We're going to miss the 7:30 show anyhow. Hey, Wai Tung, Wei Wei. Hope you don't mind us stealing away Simon for the evening. Of course not. Pascal's waiting in the car. Simon has friends? I didn't think he had any. See you all later. - Bye. - Bye. See you. When'll you be back? Good night. Where've you been? Out. What does it mean? Out? Out where? Out, having a reasonably good time. To the movies. For a drink. I hooked up with Steve and we hung out. We went to a couple of clubs. Like life, remember? Our life? You having an affair with Steve? Fuck you. Listen, go get a good night's sleep. I just had a really nice evening and I don't feel like dealing with your shit. Go. Go. Really. What's wrong, Wei Wei? Don't touch me. First it's Simon, now it's you. And my parents are still here. All I do is pamper the four of you. My patience is running thin. Sleep. All will be fine in the morning. It's worse in the morning. What? What do you mean it's worse in the morning? I know you can cook an egg. Give it a little thought here. Just trying to help. Pregnant. But I told you, Simon. Yeah, you told me you were drunk. You said, I quote, "Things got out of hand." Yeah, out of hand and into. What difference does it make? They don't even speak English. I can say whatever the fuck I want in my own fucking house. in my own fucking language. Simon, it wasn't Wai Tung's fault. I can explain. I don't even care who or what he fucks. but talk about stupid unsafe sex. I am talking to you. How much more of this do you expect me to put up with? - Are we overstaying our welcome? - Shut up and eat. Put down the fucking phone and listen to me! What? This whole thing was your idea. You fucking busybody. Wei Wei wouldn't be here, but for you. And I wouldn't have to deal with any of this shit. Shit? I'm shit? You're shit. You are all shit. I wasn't calling you shit. Don't call me anything. You user. You fraud. Did Wai Tung pay his rent? You can't put your foot in your mouth if you keep it closed. Eat. Wai Tung, it's me. Listen, don't be freaked out. but your Dad had a mild stroke. It's not too serious. We're over here at St. Sebastian Hospital. About this morning. How's Pa? Sleeping. Visiting hours are over. Don't worry. It's just a mild stroke. God was watching over him. He must stay calm. Wei Wei and Simon? They went to get supper. Ma, don't worry about my fight with Simon. It's nothing. Such a big thing. Why did you hide it? I was afraid you couldn't take it. It's been 20 years. I've been living a big lie. There has been so much pain and joy. I've wanted to share with you, but I couldn't. Sometimes I wanted to tell you everything. but I couldn't burden you with what has been with me so long. I don't get it. Why didn't you tell us Wei Wei was pregnant? What is all this? Ma, I want to tell you. I've known it for a few days. After you guys fought this morning. I told her that judging by her bad mood. she's carrying a boy. Congratulations, son. My marriage is a fraud. Simon is my real friend. Friend? Friend. Lover. Ma, I'm gay, and Simon is my lover. We've been living together for five years. Simon led you astray? How could it happen? Nobody led me astray. I was born this way. Nonsense. You had girlfriends in college. Jean. Lei Lei. You were intimate with them. That was the thing to do. Every guy had a girl. I was no exception. It's hard for a gay man. to find someone compatible to be with. That's why I treasure Simon so much. Look around you. How many so-called normal couples are fighting, divorced? They only wish they could be as loving as Simon and me. How can you accuse Simon of leading me astray? If it weren't for Pa's need of a grandchild. and your constant matchmaking. I'd be very happy the way it was. Is the child yours? Yes. That fake marriage was to get her a green card. and to make you happy. but things got out of hand. What a mess. Your father must not know. I know. It would kill him. What went wrong? He really told her? Yes, but it's to be a secret from his father. Damn. Stretch. That's good. Not too much. That's all right. You got it. What a pain. I wish I could have a cigarette. Right. Okay, good. Want to walk? My mother is in Boston, and my father is, I think, in Arizona. Mother in Boston, father in Arizona. How tragic. Where's Arizona? Texas. Any brothers? Do you have any brothers? My father, who's quite old now, did have a son by a first marriage. I never met him. He died in the Vietnam War. No. Any sisters? You have two sisters? They both live in San Francisco. Yes, in San Francisco. Are they straight? Simon cooked for us today. Pa, don't serve me, there's plenty of meat. Eat. I have hypertension. I mustn't eat fat meat like that. We must send her something when we get back home. Sure. I'll do the dishes. Why? Just eat. Later, I'll do the dishes. Simon cooked, I'll wash. Just leave it. Let me do it. - I'll take a bath. - I'll help you. No, I'll do it myself. Just one more week. and then they're gone. And then what? Everything goes back to the way it was? What about Wei Wei? First they go, then we'll figure it out. When they go, I think I might have to go, too. I know. Oh, it's you. Come here. Looking at pictures, Ma? Sit down with me. He was so cute. So cute. And, Ma, you look so beautiful. Not really. I had a hard time with Wai Tung. He was a cesarian birth. I almost died. The doctor told me I couldn't have any more. He weighed so little. I don't know how I raised him. his father always away with the military. God knows how such a weak child grew. into such a big, able and handsome man. He always did well in school. I never worried about his grades. I always bragged that I couldn't spoil him, no matter what. Forgive me, I want to return these. When a son grows up, mother is forgotten. I'm sorry. I didn't know things were going to turn out like this. I didn't want to hurt you. You can return the gifts. But what about our love? How can you return that? I can't. I can only ask for forgiveness. But my love for you is real. - I don't want them back. - I can't accept them. I want my daughter-in-law, my grandchild. I can't do it. I also have a future. We old women sometimes envy young women like you. Independent, well-educated, with your own life. You don't depend on men. You do as you please. We pay a price, too. It's not easy living here by yourself. That's why Pa and you became my parents. A woman is still a woman. Husbands and children are still most important to us, right? Not really. You're young. You still don't understand. Will you go to the clinic with me tomorrow? So you've made up your mind? I made the appointment for 2:30. They asked me to bring someone. I said yes. It won't take long. Will you come with me? I gave up too much for a green card. Don't say that. Maybe there are more important things in life than hiding in America. We are so selfish. For our own interests, we planned this bogus marriage. We let Simon down. your parents, too. If we continued, we'd let the kid down, too. As of tomorrow, the lie will be over. I'll return to China. You'll make up with Simon. We won't have to live this lie anymore. Promise one thing: Pa won't ever know. I promise. Nothing. Where are you going? - Shopping. - I'll come, too. Stay and watch over Pa. If I stay here I'll go mad. I'm coming with you. Wait for me, I'll get my purse. Don't leave without me. Where's my purse? You're hungry already? You just had lunch. I'm craving a hamburger. Can't it wait? It's almost 2:00. No. I've got to have one now. Happy birthday, Simon. Mr. Gao? You speak English? Please. Happy birthday. My birthday. Even I forgot. Then you know, you've known. I watch, I hear, I learn. Wai Tung is my son. So you're my son, also. Why, you. Thank you. Thank you. - When Wai Tung. - No. Not Wai Tung, not Mother, not Wei Wei shall know. Our secret. Why? For the family. If I didn't let them lie. I'd never have gotten my grandchild. I don't understand. I don't understand. It's late. You eat, I'll drive. Don't rush me. You can go by yourself if you want. I'm feeding my baby. You changed your mind? You're keeping the baby? What happens if you want to get married one day? And the kid? I don't think I could stand another wedding banquet. It's my child. I'll find a way. Painter and mother? Can you be both? I'll find a way. A tough man takes responsibility for his actions. If you want to help, get me a decent apartment, no rent. Otherwise just get out of the way. I'm gonna be a father. I better ask the other tough guy first. Okay, let's talk to Simon. So they can pick them up at the airport counter when they check their luggage. Two hours before departure? Really? That's one low sodium, and one healthy-heart meal. Right. Okay, thanks. How did it go? You okay? Wei Wei wants to know. if you will be one of the fathers of her child. Sure. Then you'll stay? You must, for the sake of the child. Now that I'm keeping the baby. we'd better go tell Pa he's going to be a grandfather. He'll be so happy. What's so funny? Nothing. Go tell him. I'll be here. We might as well tell him one true thing. Wei Wei is having a baby. That's true. Maybe it's only temporary. He may get over it. Maybe a woman hurt him. and he developed a psychological problem. It's not like that. I know. But maybe once he sees his child. he'll get back to normal. I wouldn't bet on it. At first, I hoped the same thing. I knew it. You liked being in that wedding gown. This garden will turn wild again after I leave. Good morning. I think it's time. Don't forget to take the wedding pictures. Okay. We really should be going. Take good care of yourself. And come visit us in Taiwan. Simon, thank you for taking care of our son. The Gao family will always be grateful to you. Okay, time to go. Why are you crying? Because I'm happy. I'm happy, too.

We need to murder him. How old do you think? - We need to murder him. Why do we have guns? I want to shoot him. The guns were meant for hostages. That was the plan.

A guarantee that the robbers come and murder us. Do not say that. - I do not want to die. Let's stay calm. This bank is open five hours. Then I and my colleagues have long gone. We're all trapped. Even if you come out of this kitchen then you are not from the bank. So sit down and shut up. - If we often go to the toilet? There's toilet break. You will not try to escape . or contact with someone outside the bank. And no noise. Alarm on your watch? Are you in the sixth grade? It runs every hour. In memory of my medications.

Do you want to apologize, because You have provided us a terror? Why did they kill us? - Why would they have to murder us? They have been convicted of a murder. Why not . all the witnesses murder? I would do. Might think the robbers are the other did it . so they do not need to murder. - It's express shot. We must find out who he is and why he killed Jack Hayes. How do you know his name? Driver's license. - You have a dead man's wallet stolen? Great. Gates, you're up. Like a gun in a brown paper bag need. Tell me about it. Do you see a clue? - I do not know what profession they hold. His business cards are credit card, his transfer pass . Those are the Citibank, but not just international. Why do we check him as he has no business card? Maybe he has a new account opened. Gordon, the computers stood by the mainframe. Madge's money counting. A strict security guard at the door. Looks at the lady . held by the Office of the loans is. Kaitlin is in her area. And Jack Hayes was . Jack Hayes opened any new accounts. He was to ogle at the desk. Otherwise he was to a bank employee went. What was he doing here? I have no idea. I feel your breath. What are you doing? Hello, Tripp. What are you doing? Looking for a way out. - Did not you think they will murder us? I may just have your ring? How long have you been engaged? That way we'll find out. Why your wedding with Max? You know him do not agree. - I know he is rich . He can not meet your appetite for adventure meet and your sense of humor . He sexually satisfy you. She told me that he his pants had been found. - Madge. She knows him for two months, and I have not met him yet. Enough. - There are four pictures of you on that drive. Three from Brazil. You're an adventurer. Max is totally irrelevant. He was with the Banana. He was badly burned. He remained in that day. The worst part is yours and Max for his mansion. You are so small compared to that house. He loves the house than yours there. Who are you? - The most interesting thing about you is . you are still working, even though you do not need the money. You're an independent woman. I like that. Count on that. - If I did not use medication . I'm not very good with . - People? Certainly not one I wants to bed. And then I say such things. Stop it. Because of you we are all killed. Be still there. They call me Mr. Clean. Where are you from? No English. - That I have been. To "No English". That is close to 'No problem'. The trip. It can. Come on it. Now we have to murder him. - Calm down. Does your computer have? Yes, that still works. - How much time do we lose them? Approximately one hour. Let us remember that safe and we murder that shit. Then we crack ATMs. - That is the blue color. This is the blue color. - We need to do murder . This slows us only. A bullet in their brains. We have blown up the ATM? The biggest job you ever did. You have just three bars . dynamite eaten. - Do we have blown up the ATM? Let me see. Do you want the good or the bad news? The good news. - That is, we have blown the door. The bad news is, that the ATM is intact. Two doors. I have not even pulled the trigger. That thing just went off. On your knees. Facing forward. Hands behind your head. You're going to die, so you have no extras required. Do you have any ideas? - See you on the other side. You have to focus on the brains? Then you have less junk or something? It was fun, man. Very nice. I had to no one else to do. In practical terms, this is not a good idea. - You said we could murder him. Let me see the place. - If you blowing something next time . let us know. - You got it. I want to personally thank that you do not murder. Are we going to murder them? Are you crazy? Why are you out of the kitchen? - We have to murder them all. You have missed. He has to grab you? - What? Your ear. - My ear? I mean that. Get ready to die. Shoot him. - I will. Then I will shoot you down, and this circle violence may continue forever. Come on, dick. Do it. You want them to shoot me. We are better than that. Then I walk back. Gates, bring the hostages to that office. Do it. Is it, good butter cookie? Why talk to a hostage against me? Somebody killed him, and they will soon again a murder. The man with the jacket. I was not. I was not in the right corner. Who had the good or corner? Are you Dwayne? Pay attention to the hostages. Take it easy. You're hyper. You need a sedative. What is wrong with you? I have a gun on the back of your head. What were you talking about? - They wanted to know . if I thought you're the man the jacket had been murdered. Really? - Yes. Have you done that? - No, we're professionals. If one of us the guy was killed, The hostages would be dead. Why are there two bank robbers killed at the same time? Are you kidding? - No. At seven hours that computer guy the whole security system is restarted. This is a new protocol. The whole security was two minutes flat. That no more bank robbers were here tonight I'm surprised. Darrien should know. He knows that right? You tried to pry information out of me? - Yes. You are Jack Hayes? - In all my years of taking hostages . you're by far the most annoying. I'm sorry. Go inside. Hello, computerman. Why you busy but ten keys when you phoned your wife? What are you talking about? - When she used the phone . expressed in all ten buttons and then connect. For eleven keys. You expressed only ten. I count everything. Why do you do if your wife call you? You sold the information when the alarm off was one of the criminals. Then you are greedy and you sold it again. Double money, double robbery. Why did you not call your wife. Should I beat him up? - Good practice when the police come. , We'll "water boarding". I saw how to do it on Discovery Channel. I only need a mop and a pair of pliers. - Wait a minute. I have sold the information. - What? I've only done once. And I do not even know to whom. I have the information faxed. They gave me cash. And I did not kill Jack Hayes. - Says no. We would already be. - We need to break into this vault. It is not. According to the vault specifications would be two inches thick. That is much thicker. How long does it take to burn through them? - I do not know. Two hours? Are all your chores so bad? Should I worry if there is enough gasoline in the van is? Look at me. We have cracked the timeslot. We need you no longer need. You threaten me, little bald Jew? Jews have more small bald for humanity done more than anyone else. Flicker is on. We will not do crazy things. Hurry. Hurry. Relax. It never stops. 3000 years we pick that shit already I know. I am not an accountant or a comedy writer . or something very Jewish. I am a bank robber. Do you know how many Jews there are bank robbers? - Not much. Not very much. Even in this environment they see only bagels and schmear . and Goldman Sachs. We link or by fires. It just takes a little longer. I do not know, D. We always said we would stop if the information is incorrect. That safe specifications are incorrect, We are behind schedule . and then that idiot still Lancelot. Hilbilly two in the hallway with weapons play and explosives. They have seen our faces. Ten years ago we were stopped. Ten years ago there was no recession. In a few years we have 40. That's 80 years in criminal. I'd already be inside. I need the money more than ever. My little girl has just one bracket. That Invisalign. Not that cheap ceramics. 9000. And they call us criminals. We had to be dentist. We had to be dentist. - Actually it orthodontist. Keep the hostages away, I start to the link. It's us succeed. It always works. We stop the door from the C4 . and blowing out the door. - Like an open beer can. You are the dumbest bank robbers I have ever seen. You have my ear 15 minutes ago shot off . So sorry, your comment goes one ear and in my other out again. What? - You only have one ear. That is a saying. Are you doing with him? They can not come between us. They're trying to lower in rank. You Muppets have ranks? - Absolutely. We've put you down. - Want to bet? Go ahead. - Come on it. That ranks them on the web. - Are you still in Riverside? We are the Internet thundered. Has that ever happened you? No, I've never the Internet thundered. I have mixed feelings about this whole experience. You see more clues? - No, I have to get closer. Do you have ADHD or something? - No. 'm Not going on the defensive. We all have stuff. I take no coincidence Sanax. - Why do you Sanax? I do not know. Nerves before the wedding I think. Max is not true for you. - Yeah, that must be it. What you swallow? - What I do not swallow. Illegal or prescription? - All prescription. Illegal junk I do not trust. Where you take it for? Well, then you tell me. It turns the TV off. - Interesting. Would you tell? - How do I explain that? I've seen hundreds of doctors. They have hundreds of diagnoses. Not that I'm crazy, but it's like . There are a lot of TVs and they are All other station . a normal person . concentrate on one, I take it all at once to me. Can you expand? - No. I wish I could. I've tried everything. Switch channels? - No. Tricky. - Yes. You know what they say. Normal but the kitchen sink and washing machine. A fool would say, not a normal person. This is the list of the FBI for most wanted bank robbers. Number one, Vicellous Drum. He's overrated. I do not know. He was never caught. The most stolen. The largest ratio. Jobs are running smoothly. Like fat people who run to the buffet. Look at the Baltimore job. 20 people dead. That's pretty excessive. He takes it into millions. Number two is Mick Nylon and his gang. Number three, Alexis Black. She is good for a girl. And Darrien and Weinstein at 12. They have been doing it 15 years. They have much more recognition than I am. I am. 68 place as a bank robber. But if four cybercriminal. Now I can say . My ear is shot off the fourth cyber criminals in the country. Will you be shooting my finger? Hit me just now? Where are we? Number 674? They have probably . Excluding the international job. We had a Kwik-Fit robberies in Winnipeg. Who is here. You have been arrested in Sagamore . when your car broke down. We had blown the engine. - Once you have raided a Kwik-Fit? So ironic it's not for us. I have broken their chains. They're going to murder me. You can still state witness, then enter the prison. Should I feel better? The tank is not so bad. There are not many gay men. For you maybe. You do look delicious. Disgusting. Come and help. They have already learned that you the detector are? Come on. Come on. Get out. Gates, you rule the toilet breaks even. I gotta give this guy some Rennies. Sorry, guys. See you later. We put the things on edge. Tonight it will happen. You need the latest bloated. You have also taken one for the team, with your ears and stuff. I have an idea. Can we borrow one of the hostages? Half of us anyway. - You want to choose? All. I take that beauty. - They are all beautiful. I take that cue and mustache Remans. That black chick, that creep, gay and who goes with you. What? - I must go to the bathroom. Should you piss again? Is there something wrong with your pecker? - I have some kind of problem. Then go ahead. In connection with the team spirit we welcome . - Mistic Lightning. Not Mystic Lightning. I hate that name. "Ties" is cool? Who are blind tunnel. Rodents living on garbage and excrement. These are not inspiring animals. You should choose Peanut Butter and Jelly. I choose this. For our first activity . We need a very special tie . that, if possible, can read Chinese. For some totally harmless explosives for us to explode. So if you ask, we get not volunteer. What? - I can see Jack Hayes. See? He's dead. You can do nothing for him. - You love me. I'm not crazy about you. - I have heard no gunshot. How will Max react to this? You mutilate yourself. I do not care. Get out. I'm not gay. - Now is the time for it. This must happen. You put the primer in the C4. You run to a safe place . and I push in the igniter. This is really happening. Igniter in the C4. A gigantic explosion. You will be thrown by the bank, and we find you than in the rubble. Success. Go ahead. He is not the smartest. - No. New rules now we only rob people. This is absurd. Of course they are locked. Why this man hates us? I found a few pennies. Pennies. The dumbest currency on the planet. It looks a bit better. I just found some pennies. That way. Drop the gun. You heard him. Drop it. - Put the gun down. Put that gun down. Put it down. Drop the gun. Now let the gun fall. - What is it? Drop the gun. - It? Who was with him. The origin of the gun I'm not interested. Put it on the ground. You're kidding. We are the youngest team here . We want you to your guns us, if we focus on your gun. This is an FBI gun? - FBI? That's interesting. FBI agent tried this bank also to rob? Or someone he studied? There are at least five wanted criminals. - What is happening here? Got it? - No. I have that missing piece found in your ear. If anything you, I care for you. Peanut Butter and Jelly were to the front door. Darrien and Gates came down the stairs. Bullets flew from north to south. Blood splattered from east to west. We were stuck in the crossfire. North, south. Darrien and Gates took the wrong exit. Peanut Butter and Jelly too. The FBI came, Jack Hayes was the pipe. Only two people had it so shoot. Mitchell, the computer guy. He was unarmed. If you omit this option . there is only one other possibility. The killer must . Be Weinstein. They each shot. No, he can not be faster than Weinstein. Where does he get a gun and a silencer from? Weinstein was furious because the computer guy two parties invited. And that computer guy is furious because Weinstein that FBI guy killed. They confront each other, pulling their guns and go both dead. Why Weinstein confront him? Why would an FBI guy Weinstein murder in the middle of a bank robbery? That asshole surprise. - The computer guy has two bullets in it. Maybe someone, someone else surprise in a different way. If it was not a confrontation, if they were friends? Watch what you say, when you talk about my friend. He would never betray me. We have been together 15 years. That means something in this kind of work. There people had access to the kitchen, Peanut Butter and Jelly where only . and you, Gates had access to the kitchen. - And the hostages up in the attic. Crawling up the hostages are now in the attic around? - This job is over. Wait here. Darrien, listen. That's odd. What do we do now? I have nothing. I'm just this piece of ear . in the freezer. - I swear . if you're a woman, I would marry you. I am not. You go with me down. Where's the remote? We need them to get out of this. A few more corpses. We change the plan. Therefore let this job go. - You know what they say about plans? If you want God to laugh, tell him all about your plans. Believe me, who is himself there are broken laugh. Nothing in this rotten bank goes according to plan. Where's the remote? - Weinstein him. What has he left? - I do not know. Take it easy and listen to me. We had to go away long ago. It's over. - We have needed to break the link. I need to get away. I want to stay here and rob that bank. - The bank job is fucked up. You and me on a desert island, drinking, lots of chicks . Think about it. The boat is gone, only the engine is still there. This affects your common sense. I thought you had balls. You're a disgrace to the black criminals. Tonight was a fucking mess. But not anymore. There's only one gang robbers. Three of us. Mystic Lightning Can we be? - No, you're Muppet. No excuse, no more favors, no gentle treatment. It is now for real. Because there is only one army, There is even a general. I am the General. I have complete control. Nothing happens without my say so. Bring the hostages out of the office. Hurry. - You heard him. Do you have thermal lance disabled? You do not appear? - No. What's next? We begin with the vault . or murder us all hostages? - Definitely the vault. Hostages may be useful. You can use them as human shields . things they can get you. As the money from the bank. Or snacks. We start with the safe. On one condition . if the time has come to do it, I do it alone. That should not be a problem. We are not like the mass murders. If you are in being so, is not a problem for us. Come on then. This is so much better than first class flying, drinking champagne and . and go to my wedding. - If you can walk out the bank with the money . Max would you still need? - You must let go. I can not let go. I'm obsessive. If you had the money, Max would still be? He holds the door open for you? He hugs you at night? I do not like to cuddle? - Is he the weekend to Mom and Dad? My mother loves him. - Everyone says you can not buy happiness with money. Nobody really believes that. Your tenacity is touching. As I exit I go back to Max. I continue with this for five hours. - No, I'm saying. The thermal lance is blown, so we use the c4 for the link. We are all to the controlled explosion. That would be something different. I want you to know that I am not use your explosives. We know. Go look at it. No unexpected things, No dynamite . or apache helicopters and no nuclear weapons. - Now go and see. Whoever it is, shoot them. Why he always throws scissors? Why, Jelly. Why? Do not throw scissors, but with stones. Is there anyone? I know you're there. I will not shoot you, Tripp. I just want the bank but robberies. I do not know what happens. - With the raid? Yes, with the raid and everything. I would now be the happiest guy world should be. I have a great job, working with my best friend. The hours are ideal. We have never been on people having to shoot. We've never seen anyone need to murder. It's strange to all those things against a photocopier to say. I will not be negative. I'm just saying . Maybe I'm not good at bank clerk. Perhaps Jesus has me here not put on earth. My grandfather sold illegal liquor. My father was a sex offender. Criminals is in my blood. Between you and me, it was always my dream been to work at a water park. I hear you. For what it's worth, I find a great bank robber. Are you serious? You say no, because I have a gun I focused on your dick? Nothing that went wrong is your fault. You are sabotaged. Take it easy. I let you see something. Where did you get that? Which I took from your suitcase stolen. Look, even if each transmitter suffer from interference. The ignition should work. No. Who has changed? Leader, are you okay? - Who is your leader? I must not tell you. - Who has it changed, to murder you. It's like leader, or Peanut Butter. Peanut Butter is a brother to me. Peanut Butter and I are like best gay friends in a bathtub. We are so close. A lot of money in the bank. You need it from different angles. He knew from the freezer, even though we not been in that kitchen. Let me tackle it was in the kitchen. Who is your leader? You can trust me. Who is your leader? Here. Take a look. Vicellous Drum. We have never met him. The text is clear, the information is correct. Never has our face. Just a fax. Is that normal? Receive a fax? - You thought surely emails? The police pull these things after. They store about anti-fax technology. Everyone loves the comedians the hard copy. I do not want to scare you. Do you think there is something the conspiracy theory? I want to wipe out anyone's character . I have Rex as he caught the vault the measure was. I asked what he was doing, and then he said . that he was watching and lots of space was for the new foreign currency. What weird. He would know if the system was flat. He would have known. He has repeatedly told us that he an expert in the bank robbery procedures. You're right. - It's so crazy. That is so. Has anyone seen my insulin injection? Grab a chair. Does anyone have sugar? - I do not candy. Hold his head. Fire! Fire! Where? - The man . Glucose is necessary or he dies and I get it anyway. Come on. All right. Where's the fire? You often work with Vicellous Drum guy? - Yes. We were once decoys for 'm. We had from him a bench robbery while he 's safe in the big city did. It was unfortunate that no money was, out of 80 Canadian dollars. Mr. Blythe's got low sugar. We should seek immediate glucose. Where's my gun? Look over the edge. As we crossed into the cell. Wait, have you ever been? And you monitor his bank? Yes, I have some omission on my resume. What have you been? - Bank Heist. And other offenses. I have often done to mail fraud. They were not big banks. - How much? A few. Thousand. - My God. Take it easy. I am rehabilitated and stuff. Are you single? I think it is. He must wake up normally, right? He starts to open his eyes. He's a tough old man. Would you sit up? - Ready? I close the doors for the last time. Clear? Is that clear, assholes? I do not like that word. - What did you just say? I hate the K-word. Say that again and I cut you . - I said I hate the K-word . and use in America we never! The Australians are damn. He has the same gun as you. - That's my weapon. This is what you need fixed? - What is the hell? That is our way. What do you want? Part? - We talk outside. Hands behind your head. Out. Calmly. - Maniac. You've made your point. - Why? Unless you have something to be negotiate, say. Weinstein was our informant. I have never met our leader. How have you contacted? - That I will not say. Would you leave? Answer to my question. Look, we have only this fax. I switch on the remote. Calmly. - Get up. Give me the remote. Now give me the damn gun. - It's Jelly his weapon. It was from his mother. Is it 's weapon of your mother? I give it to you. I'm sorry. You lose that damn gun now? - No. Are you fucking crazy? You lose your gun privileges. Forwards. Jesus. And you. I do not want to hear from you. One word, and you're dead. Go back. - Thanks. Back to work. My god. - What was that about? I like the remote exchanged with this fax. And that 's good deal? - No idea. That's why I kept the battery with me. Mr. Blythe told me he saw Rex the vault of the measurement was. I have seen. Where is the Swiss girl? The Swiss maid is not there. - It happens. What then? Faxes, the night vision? - What are you talking about? Five, six . - Stop counting. Tripp, stop! What? - Why did you do that? Because you might as bright . - No, it does not work! For God's sake. - I think of a thousand things. And now I have the kiss think. Are you serious? My God! My brain will explode. He's crazy, but has talent. Indeed, he is a criminal genius. We are blessed. - Can we help? A soft drink without sugar? Go somewhere else. One more hour. We will make it. The only people murdered criminals are provisional. They can kill themselves. We are heroic survivors, as I call it. Starting tomorrow, everyone one week vacation. I have next week Fri - Then we'll have "a week business. We're not safe. - You want me just do not agree. No. What's in her bra? - I take it well. Wait. Do it. - This is disgusting. Forward, pull it out. She works in a Swiss bank? What a waste. It is especially sad like a nice girl dies. If an ugly girl dies was their life sucks anyway. But if a nice girl dies is it really 's tragedy. Indeed. Nice girls are unicorns and gnomes. Rare and valuable. They must be protected. My god. - What? This is not a bank robbery. This is not a bank robbery! You're fucking dead. Hakuna Matata, asshole. Listen, and I give you back primer. Well. These are the two faxes to you these bank robberies. This is the fax to the Swiss girl. They are different . except that they are each 81 mm have a blank line. The printer had a scratch. - I do not understand. Neither do I. - Printed by the same device? By the same person. - Who? Vicellous Drum. - Who is that? The number one criminal mastermind. Those clever bastards. This is an organized trap. Vicellous Drum has a problem. He goes' n lots of people killed associated with him are . but it may not seem that he is behind it. Each of us is connected with the criminal? Yes. Let me explain. If this is true, the FBI agent searches Drum for years. Darrien and Weinstein have already previously worked for Drum. The Swiss bank representative Drum money laundering. Mitchell Woolf is his Drum computer hacker. Peanut Butter and Jelly have him working as decoys. They may be able to reveal all. And all the rest, who knows . Perhaps Mr. Blythe met Drum alone, making him angry. He was offended. Maybe flirt Mr Clean with him in a prison shower. A blowjob in prison he does not survive. Perhaps we are here by mistake. Collateral damage. - You're kidding. Hoping that we kill each other? This is sloppy, especially for Drum. That's why he is here, personally. Come on. - Think about it. The thermal lance. The explosives went off at the exact time. The FBI agent was the largest Drum threat. He left Weinstein him first kill. Yes, Weinstein worked for Drum from the beginning. Like Mitchell, who knew ceded as security. Drum and then killed them. Drum had the best possible in a double murder seems . but the remote Weinstein his mouth was very suspicious. I guess Weinstein him in his mouth was blocked . to avoid the real killer, Vicellous Drum, the bank could escape. Then inactivated by Darrien Drum. And then shot Drum Swiss girl dead. Five dead, eight to go. What a fucking bullshit. Nice story. It's not open. The money is yours to fly paper here to lure and kill you. There is no money. - Of course there is money. Shut up. Really, we've been working too hard. - This is not a bank robbery. Damn. This is the best bank robbery ever. - You said there was no money, eh? It's just fly paper. - Yeah, I guess. Jeez. My god . So it does not matter that the money is here, Drum because everyone is dead? We love to 't be. I do not know who of you Drum is . but keep me away. Grab a gun? - No, it does not matter. Drum his plan was always to everyone murder. We must be smarter than him. How to kill so many armed people? Lights, night viewers, and kill everyone. Why do I get there not? - You said something about night vision. In the bathroom there is one. - What more do you need then? Which man will get night vision goggles, Drum's. Or any woman. How do we get it all in there? How much do you think this is? - Four or five million. Let us begin. Really? Now go save the Bank? - No, I want with you. There is "one damn killer. I'm going too. - Me too. Do not forget me. - We are all here. Let each other holding hands. Seriously. You never get away. Do not say Amen to that sort of thing. You will frighten Jelly. Tripp is actually right. That remote has no battery. Are you kidding? What bastard has the battery? Vicellous Drum. You took the battery to us here to keep. No. - You wander through the bank. You could at any time someone have slain. The perfect crime . you solve yourself. Unbelievable that I kissed. You should not take a genius to to come under your skirts. Flatter yourself that you would get this far. If the rest of you idiots had Attention, did you realize . that all the evidence point to Madge. Not true. Who turned out the light? - Come on. Not again. Shoot everything that moves. Where is he? - We 't seen. Come out. Forwards. I'm not Vicellous Drum. I took the lights off because I knew that the real viewer would drum the night out. Then I went to the bathroom and I waited. A bank manager a golden heart. Everyone is surprised when they hear it's you. You think? Those clowns in the lobby thinking that you're Vicellous Drum. They will kill you, so they are more a hero like. If you kill me, you seem even more Drum. So, you're lapping anyway. A very entertaining story, but nobody believes it. Come on out. Enough lies, it's game over. Not so fast. Tripp and I have run into you. We knew that when the lights would go out, that the offender would go to night vision. You can kill all of us, right? No. Every one million U.S. dollars. Undetectable. All. Two million. Put the weapon down. Put it down and we talk. Damn. And then there were about six. Thank you, guest. That solves it in me. Take 't. It is insured. Blessed new appointment. Thank you, Badger. I say one more thing: From now on, Jelly and I do not more criminals. That's right. I almost forgot my ear. And ultimately, Peanut Butter Jelly and with the money going to run? Crazy, huh? They went to Winnipeg or something. Thank you. You may go. Close everything. - Your medication, sir. I take everything. I would the word 'hero' is not used. I led my team of hostages through the darkest time of their lives? Yes. I want two months paid time off. I want to wear jeans five days a week. Not just on Fridays. And I want lenses in both eyes. That you must not do. - No problem. Thank you. Please, ma'am. Congratulations. Thanks again, officer. What is this? A toaster? A controlled boat? Some people like to get money. I thought you were never true story. Then I remembered that Weinstein said he . two bank robberies Tonight was shot . and then I realized that are basically three robberies. A pretty good plan. Kaitlin Nest? She married the wrong guy. What a touching story. You fake fiance, Max . explains your expensive taste. It explains your exotic travel and your exorbitant demands. And you have your wedding gifts walk outside with heaps of money . no one asks questions. You did you make a move about seven hours when the security went out . but Derrien, Drum and everything else ruined your plan. But you waited for it right now. And when I turned off the lights, You did your move. Take 't. It is insured. It's really brilliant. Nobody goes to the wedding present of a woman opening . and the policemen carry the still in the trunk of your car. I honestly love you. Is that too early? What do you want? - I want to join. Is that so? - Equal partners. No violence. Why should I not murder? - You are not murderous. I feel like me. - You think? Yes, it's fun. We are a great team. What do you think? Are you going to freak out? - What do you mean? The last time I kissed you, You freaked out. That was pretty sad. What is your real name? - Alexis Black, No. 3 in banks. That's so .fuckin hot! Asshole! Son of a bitch is gonna kill somebody. He's still alive. Lloyd, will you get the tape? Let's move it! - How much further? - Two more flights. - You said up the street. - It's right there, Grandma!

The fat man need to lose some weight! Just open the fucking door! What's all this hostility about? How you doing? Who's this? - Who's with you? - Frank. Frank, how you doing?

They gotta wipe his ass and take him away. - You don't want no car phone? - I said I wanted a TV! You said this piece of shit had color TVs! Are you wasting my time? You give me my money back. Frankfurter! Frankfurter! Don't get all hyper. Cornbread telling you what else we got. - The TV's in the other room. - Get it, then! - Go get it! - Before I kick both your asses! Yeah!

Come on, man. Don't you die on me! Slim? No! Go! He's dead. You bastards! Mo' money! Mo' money! - Look at that! - Here. - Hey! - What? That was fun! You seen the look on the guy's face?

Messenger for the Dynasty Corporation. - It appears to be another hit-and-run. - I just don't understand it. Yeah, it is pretty insane. How do they get the jelly into these things? - Any of you touch this? - I gave orders not to move anything. Well, somebody did. Wonder what that means? - I don't know, sir. - Me neither. Thank you. Hold that. Oh, boy. Get me that case. I'll deliver that myself. You wrap everything else up. - I got a few things I gotta do. - Yes, sir. Yeah, I know what you mean. Sure. Hey!

Give me life, judge. I got an appetite. Big one!" That's what I'm gonna tell the judge! "Judge, kiss this ass!" - That's right! - Hey, my man! You using that hat? - Hey, man! What's your problem? - Give me a cigarette, boy. - I don't smoke. - I said give me a cigarette! - Stewart! Visitor! - I don't smoke. Wrong answer. You're supposed to say, "I'll get you one." - I'll get you one. - Jonathan Stewart! As soon as you find your fucking balls! You're dead! You're dead! - It's not funny. - What's up with you? You getting old? The stupid transit cop. I thought Frankfurter got you! If they find out about my probation, I could go away. Don't worry. I got you a lawyer. - Is he good? - What's my name? - Is he? - What's my name? - Is he good? - He's the best lawyer in town! For the money. Your Honor? Allow me to fumigate my wisdom on the defendant. Your Honor? Allow me to fumigate my wisdom on the defendant. Since he has been incarcerated in the propaganda of the prison structure on the issue of the court thing. Yes! And I must say here that it has been a real didactic experience for him, as you can see. Can I get a witness? Yes, Lord. And I must say that both physically and geographically if he be sent to the bowels of the community, I said if he be sent to the bowels the manifestation will be much too much for him to resign! I rest my scrotum. - Are you serious? - Oh, yes, sir! Oh, Mr. Stewart! The last time I saw you was only three months ago. I said if you showed your stupid face again I would put you underneath the jail, didn't I? - Yes, Your Honor. - Did you think I was playing? No, Your Honor. I'm considering postponing your case for a few months just to let you think about how you're wasting my time! Since you've been so ill-represented by the "propaganda of the court" l'll have a sympathetic "decapany" on this case. Dismissed. - Your Honor! - Thank you. And you get out of my court before I send you away! Next case. Roscoe Kent versus Elvira Kent. That's right, judge! Put him under the jail. Could I get Reverend Pimp Daddy to be my lawyer, please? Reverend, my sister'll work it off for you when she gets better. - One day your ass is mine. - Yeah, come on! Come on! You were sweating in there. You're not as tough as you think. - Thanks for getting me out, Walsh. - Me? Are you hungry? - Nope. - Well, I am. I thought you were supposed to be working. I quit. - I'm sorry? - I said, I quit! Oh, I see. You quit. Maybe I should quit helping some punk make something of his life. What happened to Kluck-A-Bucks? I was in a chicken costume, giving out coupons. It didn't fit my image. What image? You're unemployed, you're invisible. You're not even a statistic. John, a job is a job! - Tell that to the white boys! - You're gonna have to try harder! You can clean shithouses, as long as it's an honest buck. - I won't clean shithouses. - Take a look around you. Is this it? You gonna be happy with this your whole life? You tell me what it is that you wanna do. - Maybe a cop, like my father. - You don't have what it takes. Talking about your father, I tell you, he was. "The best cop ever." He's dead! So what does that say? Not too much, according to you. But he was my partner! He saved my life! You understand? He was stupid. You're here and he's gone. I can't help that. I'll tell you about your dad. - We're sitting in on a stakeout. - Oh, God, not again! What about Seymour? What does he do with his life? Drugs? Play Cornbread? Who can he look up to? You? You're too involved with yourself! Go ahead, turn your back on me like you always do! Hey, John! It ain't gonna fall from the sky! You gotta work for what you want! Look at me, at least! I'm yelling at you! It was about 90 degrees. You got kids? Johnny! Sweet and sour pork very, very good! - How'd you like the lawyer? - Filthy. Move! You out, ain't you? Guess you won't be coming to my concert! This is the system designed to cut down on fraud and unpaid charges. We developed this through interviews with 300 Dynasty Club authorizers. This computer can determine credit approval. The computer decides who gets credit and who doesn't? Who would have guessed? Technology. Remember when you had to heat an iron on the stove? I have no frame of reference. I'm a man of the computer age. - Another tough question. - Yes? I lose my credit card. Someone finds it and goes on a shopping spree. Please. Sit. - I'm listening. - Does the computer pick up on that? Well, yes and no. It's harder during Christmas, when shopping's heavier. On the whole, it's a very effective system. Ain't that something. I hate to be so pedantic, but it's "isn't that something." - Isn't that something? - Yes. It's a shame. - What is? - Mr. Forrest's death. It's a shame. Could I get a printout of the names on that tape? Certainly. Anything else I could do? No, thank you. Thank you for the English lesson. I got what you need!

So does my shrink. He even lowered my prescription. I gotta conquer the whole self-esteem thing. Boom! I have an eating disorder, you know. - No? - Sure. Threw up on the way over. I had a negative self-image as a kid. They think I'm fat and loathsome, but I'll fight them. I'll show them that they can't rob me of my right to exist! Next. Come in. Hi.

They have to be processed before they can be cancelled. I see we got a new guy. Johnny, this is Keith Heading. He's head of security. - Hi. - Hi, Johnny. Hear the one about the guy who goes to a psychiatrist? "I'm having weird dreams. Last night I was a wigwam. The night before I was a tepee."

Then get me a leather jacket. - Just a jacket. - And a hat. - And a hat. - No. And a shirt! And a tigerskin blanket. And some snakeskin drawers. Take a look at that. Mo' Money! Mo' Money! Mo' Money! - Amber-Poo? Open the door. It's Tom. - Go away! Amber, open the door! I just wanna talk to you! - Amber? - I have nothing to say. It's over! You're being irrational! If I was the mailboy, you'd open the door! Yes, I would! He's nice to me. He doesn't treat me like a piece of shit! I've got a joke for you. What does a man with a one-inch penis have for breakfast? You give up? This morning I had baby food and therapy. Lots of it. Keith Heading told me that joke! - How'd you know where I live? - I followed you. - You followed me? - My dreams need detail. - So, what do you want? - I brought you something. Where is it? Go ahead, man. - Hey, fatso! - You're gonna have a heart attack! Give me your wallet! Now! Here! Here today, gone tomorrow. - I found this. His name was. - Chris Fields. - Darren Clinton, Lloyd Bradley. - Here, let me see that. Boy, this kid had credit. Stealing? Man, that's ridiculous. - Don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, no. No, no. Not one, not two, but three Cartier watches. Five Italian suits from Elite Wear. Flight Limousine Service. Let's see. Dinner at Lu Chow's. Yum yum, dim sum. Oh, the list goes on and on. You got good taste. - I don't know whose list that is, but. - I love this part. Hey! That looks just like you! Wait a minute. That is you! You know that's a federal offense? See, I had you checked out, Johnny Boy. You're on probation, right? Right? I put the cards there. It was just a matter of time. I'm a good judge of character. What are you gonna do? Are you calling the cops? No, I hired you! I do my affirmative action bit. Besides, it wouldn't benefit either one of us. I got something much better in mind. Look through returned credit cards and bring me these names. What if I don't? You go to jail for a long time. Now, get out of my face. I hate thieves. What you all standing around for? It looks like somebody died. It's Chris. He got stabbed to death last night. Damn! I'm sorry to hear that. Excuse me, everyone. Due to an unfortunate episode last night, Chris is no longer with us. I've just been informed that Jonathan Stewart will be his replacement. Good luck. You're the number one guy. - Over? - Over. What? This is the easiest shit we ever did! - It's over? Are you crazy? - I don't wanna do it anymore. You don't want to do it anymore?! Come on, man. Do you know how much is out there that we didn't get? I saw this four-finger ring that said "Seymour" and "Johnny." - They come with thumb attachments. - Sound like handcuffs. Come on, man. I saw a crocodile sweatsuit. You gonna play ball in the jungle? Why you bullshitting? We could get paid! It's not like they're gonna find out. They did find out! Now Keith's blackmailing me. So just leave it alone. It's over. I guess you don't want to hear about the mink socks! Get that meat out of here! I just don't understand this. - What don't you understand? - The whole thing. Could you explain the system again? - A credit line. - That part I get. There's information on everyone's spending patterns. - Computers reject abnormal purchases. - "Abnormal purchases." What? I found these receipts on the late Chris Fields. Look, there's some really big purchases here. $30,000. $72,000. I checked these against my printout and the funny thing is, every one of them are deceased. So, I asked myself, "Do dead people shop?" That fat mailroom clerk got into the system. Ain't that something? - You're right on time. I like that. - Here's your cards. Johnny. This is great. This is really good. We got some shopping to do. You said all I had to do was get you the cards. Johnny, I lie a lot. Come on. This is gonna be fun. - I like that hat. - Kiss my ass. Don't be sad. Life's good, you just need direction. - You're gonna take care of me, right? - You with me? Tom? Johnny. Come on. That stuff doesn't concern you. The only thing that concerns you is this list and this card. Be nice. Get some clothes too, will you? You're in the big time now. Charge it. John. If you fuck me l'll kill you. You're going out again? I'm supposed to just stay in? All you care about is that stupid girl, and that stupid job! - We don't hang anymore! - I took you to the dentist. That was five hours of pain. That's not my idea of hanging out. You're whipped. And you're letting her divide us. I hate that stupid girl. - Get the door. - You get it. Get the door, Dolemite. Hi, cutie. - What? - I got my tooth pulled. Oh, poor baby. - Hey, you ready? - Yeah. Bye. - Do you wanna come dancing with us? - And be a sixth toe? No. She's got a sister that looks just like her. Wait. Let me get dressed. - You sure they're sisters? - They got different fathers. - Who's her father, Godzilla? - Get to know her inner beauty. They're with me. She's been following me all night. Come on in. - She's my cousin. - That's my song. - I'm going to the bathroom! - Hurry up! This is my jam! Sisters! They ain't even friends. They don't even live on the same block. I always let Johnny do this to me. Why am I in this damn thing? She don't look that bad. I must be drunk. I always let this man talk me into this. - Loverboy. I'm out. - You're out? - You taking Godzuki with you? - That's not funny. She's good people. - All right, drunken Casanova. See you. - Maybe. Thanks for the hookup, Amber. - I'm gonna rock your world. - I heard that. Excuse me. That'll be $6.50, please. - Thank you. - Thank you. What is that? A black titty with a frozen nipple. You want some? No, the money. Where'd you get that from? I hit the lottery. You've been spending money like water. I wasn't gonna say anything. - Please tell me it's not drugs. - It's not drugs. - I'm serious! - I am too. It's not drugs! - Look, I'm doing it for you. - For me? Okay, for us. I like taking you out to nice places. Buying you things. - I want to give you what you want. - I have everything I want. Don't throw that away, okay? I didn't. Oh, my God. I gotta get this girl out of here. Damn. Fire? - Fire, Charlotte! Fire! - Where? - It's coming! It's coming! - I don't see no smoke! There's smoke! Here, go! - What about you? - I'll be okay! If you see a fire, stop, drop, and roll! Go! - What? - How am I supposed to get home? Hold on! - Seymour! - Hold on! Here. - Two dollars? - Take the train! Well, well, well. Look what we got here.

That's not what wizards wear, Mambo. The clothes don't make the wizard, Munk. It's the other way around. Now what up with all this "once upon a time" bidness? That's old school. We gots to make the story fresh, yo. You know, mix things up a bit. D'oh! Not the balance of good and evil! D'oh! Mambo! We're supposed to keep good and evil in fairy tales balanced right where they are. Capiche? But-- - Zaa! Uh, but-- - Zzz! But-- - Zaa! Oh! Fine. We'll do it your way. Good. Now, Fairy Tale Land was ruled by the wise King Cole. His wife, Queen Grace-- Who was big-time beautiful. .and their daughter Snow White. Things were pretty cool in the old kingdom. Lots of joy and love and all that good stuff was just bursting out everywhere. And this was in no small part due to Queen Grace. Wave to the people, Snow White. Everyone in the kingdom is our friend. Yes, Mommy, and they all love you. Morning! For no matter what your problem. Or what you looked like. She would bring joy into your world. With a smile on her face and love in her heart. Yeah! Yay! Did you see that? Mother, why does everyone love the queen so much? Because she is beautiful. I want to be queen someday. Am I beautiful? Uh. Wh-What do you think? Mommy, I want to be loved by everyone, just like you are. You will be, Snow White. There. All done. Whoa. Just remember, Snow White, the mirror only tells half the story. True beauty comes from helping others. Yes, Mommy. Mommy. Are you okay? Stop smiling. This is a sad day for the kingdom. But doesn't this mean someone else gets to be queen? Mommy. Yes, someone else will be queen. Now poor Snow White has to grow up without the caring heart-- of her beloved mother. <i># No, sugar,</i> <i>I like the spice #</i> <i># I'll never get enough #</i> <i># No, never get enough #</i> <i># I'll show you how,</i> <i>if you ask me nice #</i> <i># Just try to keep up #</i> <i># Try to keep up #</i> <i># Can you keep up</i> <i>with me? #</i> <i># Can you really</i> <i>keep up with me? #</i> <i># Do you think</i> <i>I'm gonna let you get #</i> <i># Your friends tonight</i> <i>and meet up with me? #</i> <i># No time</i> <i>for sleepin', baby #</i> <i># Up in the V to the I-P #</i> <i># Can you keep up?</i> <i>Can you keep up? #</i> <i># Can you really</i> <i>keep up with me? #</i> Answer. <i> Holla!</i> - Hey, girls. <i>We're almost to your place.</i> <i>You ready?</i> You know it. Snow White? Oh, my dad's coming. Gotta go. <i>Later.</i> Snow, honey, are you ready to go? Hi, Daddy. You like? It's the hottest, latest thing. Well. You don't like it? No. It's nice. I'm just not sure that's what a young princess wears. Now, your mother, she always dressed appropriately for a queen. Daddy, times have changed. So has fashion. You gotta keep up. I take it from your dress you've forgotten we were visiting the Ten Little Indians Orphanage tonight? But tonight's the opening of Mamma Goose's Joust House. They're expecting me to be there. Well, it would be nice if you felt the orphanage needed you, too. Yeah, I know. Snow, you've gone out to some new opening every night this summer. So? - So, honey, there's more to being a princess than red carpets and photo ops. Honey, the children always loved it when your mother visited them. But they pick their noses. It's so gross. Your mother never seemed to mind. You just don't understand. Snow White! Holla! Holla! So you ready to get your joust on, girl? Go ahead. We can visit with the children another time. Oh, thank you, Daddy! Now, I don't want you coming home late again. Daddy, curfews are so lame. Do you want me to look like a loser? Well, no, but-- Daddy. Oh, well. Okay, okay. But be home well before the rooster crows, unlike last time. I'm serious now. Before the rooster crows. Got it. Aw, the royal robe? Your mother wore this with pride. I insist. Fine. And be safe. I will be. Mwah! Love you. Uh, you're not really gonna wear that robe, are you? What's wrong? Girl, way too retro. The Three Blind Mice could see that. Holla! It'll be great. Hi. Mmm, who are they? Dude, they're the Damsels. Bo Peep, Goldilocks, Little Red Riding Hood, and Snow White. They're the most popular girls in Fairy Tale Land. Thanks. No cutting the line. Bite me. Sorry. Whoo-- You're looking good tonight, Snow White. Everyone's staring at you. Well, what can I say? Designer clothes with matching shoes, perfect makeup, and a killer do. Holl-a! The main event is starting! Are they starting? - There they are. Young lads and lasses, wizards and witches, it's time to get your joust on! On the red side, the man with the muscles, the big bruiser who's never been a loser-- Sir Simple Simon! I love him! Whoo! And on the blue side, a newbie to the jousting games-- Sir Peter! Who's the new guy? I haven't met him yet. I wonder what he looks like. He's probably an ogre. And, as a special treat, in attendance tonight is the ever glamorous, always fabulous, Fairy Tale Land's favorite gal-- Princess Snow White! Thank you. Thank you. Boo! Line-cutters! They obviously let in too many peasants. They shouldn't do that on opening night. This is gonna be good. Knights, are you ready? Then let's get your joust on! Yah! Hyah! Hyah. So, Damsels, was that a joust, or was that a joust? - So awesome! Sweet! - It was the bomb! Snow White, so, how about that Sir Peter? He's cute. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Hah. Whoo. Ah. Mmm. Ooh. Yeah! All right, Petey. Welcome to Fairy Tale Land. Let's find you a girl. I didn't come here to find a girl. Yeah, yeah. You only want to help people. I know. Always with the big heart. You can save the world tomorrow. Uh! - Oh! Hey. - Hey. <i># Your shining armor #</i> <i># Your heart's safe harbor #</i> Uh, you were brilliant tonight, Sir Peter. I'm way honored you asked me to dance. Please. The honor is all mine. Really? Yeah, really. Your mother was a hero of mine. Huh? My mother? I was raised in one of her orphanages. Heck, I probably wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. She's, like-- a legend. That's Mom. <i># Surrender #</i> Looks like we might have a little love connection between Snow White and that new knight. Hmm. There's something very odd about that woman over there. Ya think? The veil kinda screams "creepy." Yeah. Your mom was great. She just had something about her. Her looks? - Well, yeah, but-- Her fashion sense? - I guess, but-- Oh, the way she did her hair? Huh? Hey, you two. We got the VIP room to ourselves. Oh, you have to come. Well. Please? Yeah. Come on. We can get away from all the-- Riffraff? Totally. I mean, Snow White's a princess, for goodness' sake. I'll pass. But why? 'Cause I'm one of the riffraff. Miss Muffet? May I have this dance? Roses red, violets blue, what I'm seeing, it can't be true. My Lord, your curds and whey. I understand the children at the orphanage were quite disappointed Snow White wasn't there. Yes. She's becoming quite a handful, Grimm. Indeed, My Lord. Ruling a kingdom-- no problem. Raising a daughter-- I'm lost. Perhaps she needs a mother, My Lord. Someone like Queen Grace. It has been some time. Hmm. Someone to help guide her into womanhood. Precisely. And the people have been longing for a queen. Maybe you're right. I will decide on such things on the morrow, after the rooster crows. Hey, Peter. My Lady. Ugh! Hey, Jack. How's Mrs. Sprat? Still keeping the platter clean. Thanks for asking, Peter. We're going dancing, baby. Huh? Yeah. At the late night dance party down at the Hickory Dickory Dock. Oh, but I can't. I told my father I'd be home before-- Girl, you're Snow White, not Cinderella. Nothing's gonna turn into a pumpkin. And you have to make an appearance. Yeah. Please? Damsels, let's dance! <i>Holla!</i> I just don't get it. Snow White is nothing like Queen Grace. You didn't mess with the balance, did you? No. I didn't mess with the balance. Hmm! Maybe there's a glitch in the system. Oh, well. We'll figure it out tomorrow. Good night, Mambo. Good night. Why wait till tomorrow? Gotcha. No, no. No. Shh! No, no, don't. No, no, no. No. You don't-- Don't-- Don't crow. Shh, shh, shh. Oh! Daddy! Why are you up so early? Where was your robe? Oh. And it says you cut in line. Well. Staying out all night is no way for a princess to act. Your mother didn't raise you like this. Daddy, I'm trying my best. I go to all the events, and I-- I wave and smile to all the people, just like Mom did. But your mother went to events to help people. And I don't? Sweetheart, you're only interested in having a good time. But, Daddy, that's so not fair! Grimm. Yes, My Lord? Find me a queen. As you wish, My Lord. One more twist-- Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Huh? Oh. Huh? Ehh. Ehh! Mambo, what's all that noise? Uh-oh. Hmm. Hmm? Mmm. Mmm. Hmm. I'm coming. Oh. Greetings! And welcome to the Fairy Godmother's Dating Service. What does thou desire? I have come looking for a wife. Then you've come to the right place. Just fill this out and sign at the bottom. Oh, it's not for me. You want a wife, but not for you? I am here to find a wife for the king. The king? - Yes. Oh, my! Oh, my! The king wants a wife. I'll make it my top priority. And is there any particular type of woman the king wishes to marry? Yes. Someone just like this. I want to look like this. Uh? Oh, and you shall. I think we've found your mirror. Oh! Mambo! Look what you've done! What? I didn't do nothing. Oh, we have to fix it before things get really out of hand. Hey, this is getting kinda interesting. <i>Now I will be queen!</i> <i># It's a sign, it's a clue #</i> <i># Maybe this time</i> <i>the sign will be true #</i> <i># You've waited in line,</i> <i>paid your dues #</i> <i># With all the false alarms</i> <i>and miscues #</i> A wife! I hear "Well To Do" is the king. That's what I heard, too. Sleeping Beauty! That's me! And tell me about your best quality. <i># It's a sign, it's a clue #</i> <i># You put it together,</i> <i>and it hits you #</i> <i># The planets align #</i> <i># Is it true? #</i> <i># You finally find</i> <i>someone that fits you #</i> <i># Like a charm #</i> <i># False alarm #</i> Oh, who is it now? I'm sorry, but we're closed. I'm here about the proposal. Oh, my. Now, what would Sir Peter like? Damsels. <i>Holla!</i> Girls, I need some 911. <i>Subject?</i> - Clothing. <i>Situation?</i> - A boy. <i>Ooh!</i> <i>Someone's crushing</i> <i>on Sir Peter!</i> <i>Hook it up.</i> <i>Ooh!</i> Damsels, this is serious. My Lady, your father wishes to see you. Oh, sure thing. I'll be there in a second. So, what do you think? <i>Didn't you say</i> <i>he liked helping people?</i> Yeah. <i>Then you should dress like a peasant girl.</i> So not funny. Snow White, your father was quite insistent that you come immediately. Okay, I'm coming. My dad's freaking. I gotta go. Mwah! <i>Mwah!</i> <i>Later!</i> 15. 16. 17. - Daddy? What are you doing? 19. Exercising. Gotta firm up the flab. But-- - 20 you have bad knees. Well-- Lady Vain says a little pain should not keep me from having a proper body. Huh? Who's Lady Vain? Lady Vain is going to be your new mother. What? My new mother? Excuse me. Since when? Since I decided I wanted to get remarried. Lady Vain, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Snow White. Mommy. Snow White, I knew you were pretty, but now that I see you up close, you look just like your mother. And so do you. She does have quite a resemblance, doesn't she? Daddy, what's going on? I decided I wanted a wife and you needed a mother. And lo and behold, in walks Lady Vain. She's just perfect, isn't she? Too perfect. Oh! This is, like, totally crazy! <i>I mean, you don't</i> <i>even know this woman!</i> What's happening? Whoa! Snow White is arguing with her father. This is getting good. What? What's going on? Oh, no! Get up here and help me! <i>Snow White, I am going</i> <i>to marry Lady Vain.</i> Our wedding is already planned. Already planned? Yes. When the cow jumps over the moon, and that is final. No, it isn't! Oh, dear. Don't worry, honey bunny. Snow White and I just need some girl time together. Oh! Snow White has to go. She'll ruin everything. Oh. What happened? She whined like a spoiled brat! She was so. And to think I spent the entire day listening to the king go on and on about Queen Grace. Ugh! Oh. Mirror, mirror on the wall, make me feel better and tell me who is the fairest of them all? Go on. Say what you always say. Em, well. Well, what? Am I not fairest of them all? Well, now that I've seen Snow White, I gotta say she's looking pretty darn fantastic on the old fairest-o-meter. I mean. have you ever seen such a natural beauty? And have you ever seen a cracked mirror? Aah! And then what would become of the new you? My power sustains your illusion. I can't destroy you, but you could spend the rest of your happily ever after in a closet! Ahh. The power of vanity. Get over here and help me with this! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Waa-ha-ha! Oh, yeah! Ow! Oh. I'm here to save the day. Ugh. Just pull this rope. So, how to deal with little Miss Teen Queen Wannabe. Whoa! <i>Hmm.</i> Uh-oh. - Oh. Now we're in really big trouble. I still don't understand the purpose of this scheme. Gossip. If used properly, it can ruin a reputation, but not necessarily about the person being gossiped about. Precisely. And one bite of this magic apple will make Snow White say the rudest things she ever thought possible. Really? Ooh! Whoo! You can be such a nag. Lady Vain is rotten to the core. Apple joke. Well, the apple works. But-- But I don't know anything about makeovers. That's obvious. Just poof and cream, and you'll do fine. It's all about attitude. Poof and cream. Okay. Snow White, honey. It's Lady Vain. Go away! Please? I think we got off on the wrong foot. My friend Rumpy is the top hair, nail, and face man in the kingdom. I've convinced him to give you a makeover as my little gift to you. Makeover? So, uh, let's take a look at you, yes. My! Uh. what pretty hair you have, yes. Thanks. - And, uh. what-- what a beautiful set of eyes you have. Oh, that's so sweet. Ooh! And what big teeth you have, huh? What? Ooh! Oh, yes. Uh. So, uh, let's get started, yes. First, we will. uh, poof the hair! Give it some air. Let it breathe like fine wine, yes. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Yes. Um, Rumpy, I think that's enough poofing. Oh, yes. Well, of course. Yeah. So, uh, now, we will-- No. Uh. Rumpy, don't you think Snow White is looking a little pale? Really? Well, I feel fine. Don't you have something you can give her? Wh-What? Oh, uh, yes! Indeed, I do. Uhh! What? Where is it? Oh! Oh! Ah. Here. - Oh. Eat this. An apple? - Oh, yes. It'll make you feel better than pease-porridge pie. But I feel fine. It's good for the skin. Oh. Oh! No! - No! Don't! Don't do it! Don't do it-- Well, she did it. No! Come on! That a girl. Now, tell old Rumpy about everything and everyone that makes you mad, sad, or had. And don't leave out any of the juicy details. Well, let me tell you about. Replay messages. <i>Now, Bo Peep,</i> <i>she's always braggin'</i> <i>about her "junk in da trunk."</i> <i>Junk's right.</i> <i>It's called "too much</i> <i>gingerbread," honey.</i> <i>Maybe if she got</i> <i>off her trunk--</i> <i>.she'd find her sheep.</i> <i>And Goldilocks?</i> <i>Talk about a whiny</i> <i>little airhead.</i> <i>"The porridge isn't right.</i> <i>It's too hot.</i> <i>It's too cold."</i> <i>Make a decision, girl!</i> <i>And we can't forget</i> <i>Little Red Riding Hood.</i> <i>Honey, stop wearing red.</i> <i>It's totally not your color.</i> Oh, no, she didn't just say that. <i>I think we all know</i> <i>why Simon is called simple.</i> <i>If the butcher only knew</i> <i>what the baker</i> <i>and the candlestick maker</i> <i>were doing behind his back.</i> <i>Now, Cinderella.</i> <i>Let me tell you</i> <i>about Prince Charming.</i> <i>And Mistress Mary? Ew!</i> <i>The ugly duckling.</i> <i>And Sir Peter?</i> <i>What's with the "nobler</i> <i>than thou" 'tude?</i> <i>Like, chill!</i> Hmm. He didn't even cut my hair. Oh, well. Cute as ever. Goldilocks. Hey, girl. Want to go shopping? <i>You got some nerve</i> <i>calling me.</i> What are you talking about? <i>Oh, like you don't know?</i> <i>Whatever!</i> Huh! What's her problem? Go, Snow White, and meet your adoring subjects. Hmm! - Hah! She's got some nerve showing up here. She's showing her face in public. Can you believe it? What is their problem? It's okay, girl. - Yeah, it's okay. Too much gingerbread, huh? Whiny airhead? So, red isn't my color? What are you talking about? Don't play dumb. We heard everything you said. And it wasn't very nice. Come on, let's get her! Yeah, go get her! Get back here! Say, there she is! - There she is! Go get her! - Uh! Tell me, Snow White. Why do they call me simple? Ooh! There's Snow White! - There she is! An old fuddy-duddy, am I? Daddy, I'm so glad you're here. Something horrible has happened. The entire kingdom hates me. And you're surprised, after all the terrible things you've been saying about people? Your mother would be ashamed. Oh, Daddy! Snow, come back! Grimm, follow her. Yes, Your Majesty. Whoa! Everybody hates me. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You idiot! Not while I'm cackling. Will you stop that primping and get out of that silly costume? Sorry. This story is so out of control. We have to do something. But what? The scale is toast. Kaput! Finito. Aah! Let's go! What? Where to? We've gotta stop Lady Vain. Come on, I'll drive. No. I'll drive. - Uh! Rise. And away! Whoa! Ho-ho! Whoa ho ho! Yeah! Whoa! Oh! Aah! Pull over! Pull over! I think I can drive a little better! Aah! Come on, Munk, let me drive. No. I'm driving. Please, please, please, please? Please, please? - Agh! Hey! Oh, hey, aah! As a control freak, you need to let me drive! Let go! Next time, you should drive. Mmm. Hello. Anybody home? I'm a princess, heh. Not a thief. Mmm. This looks delicious. Mmm. Mmm. Oh. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Oh. Aah! Aaah! What-- uh-- Wh-Who are you? We be the dwarves of the forest, My Lady. Well, it is so not cool to freak out a fair maiden, especially when she's sleeping. Now don't be givin' us none of that knick-knack paddy-whack, missy. You're the one who done broke into our home, ate our food, and slept in our beds! Oh, right. Well, my father will pay for whatever. And who be your father? The king? Actually, yes. Giants and wizards! You're Queen Grace's daughter, Snow White! I can see the resemblance. I see it now. Yeah. And? We were friends with the queen. My mother came here? Here's us with Queen Grace when we helped Mary get her little lamb back. The poor thing got washed into the river. Ooh! This is the day we all cleaned out the spiders from Miss Muffet's attic. Oh, and this is when we helped Old MacDonald plow his fields. He was a little behind on the harvest that year. And this-- the day she took care of us. She knitted them herself. I didn't know she did all these things. Oh, sure. - She did. Bright and pretty. Yes, it's true. Yep, she did. Your mother loved to help people. She was a beautiful woman. Yeah. So what be bringing you down to our neck of the woods, Snow White? Oh. Well, I had a little situation back at the kingdom. What kind of situation? Well, I guess it all started when I went to Mamma Goose's Joust House. I was supposed to go to the orphanage, but so after I said all those horrible things-- which I would never usually say, really-- the Damsels, my dad, and everyone, like, totally freaked. She may look like her mother, but she sure don't act like her. Hear, hear. Come on, now. Cut the girl some slack. Her mother died when she was young. In fact, I'd say it's our duty to fix her up into the woman her mother would have wanted her to be. Oh, we should be doing that for sure, yes! For Queen Grace. For Queen Grace. Snow White, we're gonna help you win back your friends, family, and home. But you have to do everything we tell you to do, no questions asked. Well, okay. Come again? You want me to do what? Shovel some sticks and straw. No way. But why? Hello! I'm a princess. I don't shovel. Okay. But there's wolves in them woods. Fine. Happy now? No! No! No! No! No! No! Ooh! Definitely no! But, My Lady, these are the finest wedding dresses in all the kingdom. Sewn by peasants, no doubt. Pitiful, all of them. I want only the finest dress made by the finest hands. Um, My Lady, there was this cream-colored number we saw over in Wonderland. The cute little strapless couture with organza and gold thread? And the draped pickups and cinched pleats. Uh, it was to die for. We could get it on back order. Ooh, but it might take a little while. Can we push the wedding back, say, um, a month? Enough! How dare you subject me to these peasants. Have you seen Snow White? Has she returned to the castle yet? No, but I'm sure she'll be along soon. You know how young girls are. I hope you're right. Trust me, dear. Hmph. Now what? Maybe it's time for a little more direct approach. So, my dear, tomorrow's a big day. Are you excited to meet the kingdom? Did Peter Piper pick a pickled pepper? Excellent. Did someone order bodyguards from the employment service? That's me. Send them in. Bodyguards? Honey bunny, I'm not used to being among the people. It makes me nervous. Oh. Well, I suppose. Now run along. We'll play some patty-cake a little later. Oh! I love patty-cake! I'll make this simple. No touching, no hugging, no rubbing, no tugging, no kissing babies, no "let's take a picture together for my brother who's a big fan," for I am royalty and they are the commoners. Can you handle that? But, My Lady, you are going to be the queen of the people. Why would you want to keep them away? You are the first guard. You are the alternate. Ow! Ooh! Sorry. Ohh! Where are we going again? Ohh! We have some work to do. More work? But I did that already! The deal was "no questions asked." Remember? Whatever.

Gather 'round to meet your new queen-to-be! They're really excited to meet you. And me them. Oh, and I have a little present for you. The royal robe! Oh, pookums! A queen's robe for my queen-to-be. Ha! King Cole, you don't want to marry this woman! She's a wolf in sheep's clothing! Guards! Aah! - Aah! So much for the direct approach. A wolf in sheep's clothing? Well, it's all I could think of. So here she is-- Lady Vain! Shall we? Stick close to me. Baby-sit? But I don't know anything about babysitting. It's for a friend. It'll be a breeze. Well, okay. You've gotta be kidding me. Thank you again for babysitting. I really appreciate it. How do I look? Uh, why don't you let me do a few things? There. All done. Oh, my goodness. I'm-- I'm almost beautiful. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much! Now, children, you behave yourselves and listen to Snow White. She's in charge. I won't be too late. Bye! But I-- Just, eh, play with them. It'll be easy as pie. Easy as-- No, I don't think you-- Finally, some "me" time. Ugh! Look at my hair. What a mess. Play with dolly? Oh, honey, I'll play with dolly right after I finish my hair, okay? I promise. Hey! - Hey! Aah! We want you to play catch with us. In the backyard. Guys, I'll be done in a little while. Then I promise we can play catch. Ugh. I'll just be a second more, promise. Oh! Hey!

She sure is different than Queen Grace. No fooling. The wedding is upon us, My Lady. Our plan is almost complete. Our plan? I-- I mean your plan, of course! If only Mother could see me now. Becoming Queen is going to be even easier than getting rid of Snow White. Ooh, terrific. Poofarama. Poof, poof-- Will you stop that! What's this? All right, Pinocchio, good as new. Thanks, Snow White. You're welcome. And no more lying, okay? Okay. Peter. Snow White? What are you doing here? I came looking for you. You want me to go back to the castle? Yes. But why? Hold this. To stop the wedding! Here. If it makes my father happy to marry Lady Vain, who am I to stop him? But he doesn't know what he's getting himself into. He doesn't know who the real Lady Vain is. Hmm. I know something about that. There. How do you feel, Humpty? I feel fantastic! Whoa! Thanks, buddy. And thanks a million, Snow White. You're welcome. And stay off the high walls. You got it. Hey, it's Snow White! Holla! - Holla! Holla! Thanks again! Hee-ya! Toodle-oo! I'd like to help, Peter, I would, but I'm not exactly welcome back in the kingdom. And besides, this is where I belong-- helping others. They need me. But your kingdom needs you. Your father needs you. Please. What is wrong with you? Weddings always make me cry. We have gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. The drawbridge is up! I have an idea. Can't we use the back door? No time. Ohhh! We've got to stop the wedding. But how? Whoa! Snow White! Oh, it's good to see you, My Lady. Am I too late? You couldn't cut it any closer. Come on. Do you, Lady Vain, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold through-- Uh-oh. This might be trouble. .good times and bad-- Psst! Pssst! Psst. Poof. Yoo-hoo. Look. .from this day forward? Yes, yes, I do. - Hmm? Can we hurry this along? Ahem. Oh, yes. Of course. And do you, King Cole-- Hello, Fashion Police. Oh. Snow White. You're back. Now is not the best time for reunions, honey bunny. Dad, if you truly love Lady Vain, then marry her. I won't try to stop you. But if you're doing this because I've been a brat, then, well. I've changed. I found my way. Why must you ruin my wedding? She hasn't changed at all. I mean, what has she ever done for anybody? She fixed my nose. And she put me back together after I fell down. She helped rebuild our home. And helped me look prettier than I've ever looked. And she sang to me when I was sad. And tucked us into bed. Wow. Girl really has changed. She did all the things a queen is supposed to do. Except one. I want to apologize to everyone I've ever hurt. Especially you, Dad. Everything you loved about my mother, I hope you can love about me. I just want my daughter back. Maybe breaking the balance was not so bad after all. No! No! No! No! This isn't how the story ends! You may have spoken too soon. Mother always told me that if I was beautiful enough, I would be queen! And if I can't be queen, then, mirror mirror in the hall, kill the fairest of them all! Kill Snow White! Ha-ha! Get me out of here! Aah! Uh! Hmm? - Huh? Aah! Peter! No! I have you now. Oh! - Whoa! No! Oh! Aah! No! No! No! Oh! My magic mirror! Now I'll never be beautiful. Please. Wait. Dad, may I? You don't need a magic mirror to be beautiful. Really? Really. Come on, lassie, we've got some work to do. My little prom queen has now become a real queen. All right, everybody. Let's party! You don't mind dancing with the riffraff? I wouldn't have it any other way. Now let's give this party some snap! No, don't! <i># Uh-oh-oh-ah #</i> <i># Uh-uh oh-oh-ah #</i> Yeah! Woo-hoo! Come on!

My mother's eternal words, reminding me America was already discovered, and that day-dreaming was a long way from life's truths. Why tell me the difference between an apple and a bicycle? If I bite a bicycle and ride an apple, I'll know the difference. But thinking about what to do made me more tired than actually doing. I remember my father said: If you want to look at someone's soul, you have to look at their dreams. Then you'd have mercy for those who swim in bigger shit than your own. My name is Axel Blackmar, and I work for the Department of Fish and Game. Most people think I count fish, but I don't. I look at their souls, their dreams and then I let them into my dreams. People think fish are stupid, but they aren't. They know when to be quiet, It's people that are stupid. Fish know everything, and don't need to think. See, fish start out in small streams, then I prepare them for the ocean. When they're ready to die, they return to where they came from. That's my connection, that's why I swam away to the city. Okay, here's my job: All I do is temporarily electrocute the fish, then with deep respect, I scoop 'em and haul 'em in, one by one. Sometimes I'll look into fish eyes and I'll see my whole life. It's something only fish can show us, and I love 'em for it. I tag the fish, measure 'em and weigh 'em, make sure they're doing okay. If they want to talk, I always listen. That's the job of a Fish God. I've never caught a fish in a lie, and I've never seen a fish swim in the shit that human people do. That's why I love my work, and I love New York. Not because my mother said it was a place with real magnetic pull, but because you can see everybody, and nobody can see you. Hey, honey! How are you? How was Istanbul? I'm looking for my girlfriend, Suzanne Supak. I just spoke with her. Over. I love you too, honey. I miss you too, honey. Over. Two more, please! Pregnant? Wow! Over. Listen, honey. Alright, let's go. - Have the abortion. I'm not going. - Come on! We're running late! I said I'm not going. You said you're not going? - I said I'm not going. I'm not going. - You're not going? Are you going to go or no? Are you gonna shoot me? - Am I? - You're going to kill me? These things. I don't even. It's a blank. But I had you scared, right? Let me feel. You shit your pants. "Take care of me". I'm fuckin' sick of it! What? He's your uncle, for Chrissakes. If he wants to see me, why did he send you? You know it wasn't his fault, right? I don't blame him for anything, Paul. I never said it was his fault. He's marrying, and wants you as his best man. You be his best man. - Why are you like that? You're killing him! Alright, Axel! Axel, listen. End of story! Over! I love you too! I'm going to go back and tell him I couldn't find you. Really? - Really. I have no choice. Promise? - I promise. What about a hug? No hug for me? Axel, you smell like a scumbag! I'm a happy scumbag. I got a nice truck, a great job. - But you smell. What're you gonna have? - Two beers. - Two beers, OK. And a ginger ale. - Two beers and. Forget the ginger ale. Two beers and two shots. - Blanche? Two. - Who's the boss? I am. - He is. 2 beers, 2 shots. - And a ginger ale. 2 beers, 2 shots. And a ginger ale. - Don't confuse her. - A ginger ale please? Anyway, Axel, I love you, but. What? I love you too. - Okay, well, you know. ginger ale. That's right. 2 beers and 2 shots. - And a ginger ale. "2 beers and 2 shots." What's that? What? - That thing. What thing? - Like a funny accent or something. What funny accent thing? - "2 beers and 2 shots." - What? I dunno. like New York. Funny New York accent, huh? - Yeah. Is De Niro funny? Is Pacino funny? Is Rocky funny? The great actors are all from New York. - Sinatra? Sinatra's from Hoboken, New Jersey. Now let's toast. Alright? It's been three years, OK? - Three years. To three years. - Three years. Blanche, ginger ale. Two shots. We don't see each other 3 years, and you want ginger ale. Thank you, Blanche. - Thanks for the ginger ale. - You're welcome, boys. Gimme a hug. I'll plug my nose. Back to the dream. The man gives the stomach balloon to the little boy. Pushes him out of the igloo. While the kid is outside, the two inside start, y'know. Alright! Stop yelling, we're on Broadway. Show respect. Therefore, I know you're all dying for a piece of wedding cake. So I will make this short and sweet. Millie, dear friends, waiters and waitresses, I'd like to propose this wedding toast. Leo! - Not now, Millie. Come on! Hey! Don't fuck around! Cut it out! Don't be a jerk! Cut it out! I got an audition coming up! You're lucky I don't kick your ass. Cut it out! Axel! You want me to come down? - Come on down! Stop shaking the ladder! - Axel! I'm coming down! - Leo! My boy! - Axel! I can't believe it! You got big on me! You heard about the wedding? - I did. Congratulations. I'd be proud if you'd be my best man. - I gotta get back to New York. Sure. Larry, we have to make Axel an appointment for a fitting. Honestly, Leo, I've got to go. It's so good to see you, Axel. You look terrific, Axel. I just want to show you something. I want to share this with you. What do you think about my Saguro? The cactus? - Nice, huh? Let me let you in on a secret: When a cactus is that young, it is very vulnerable. That's why I planted that Mesquite tree right next to it, for protection. If you don't see an older tree nearby a new cactus, you can forget it. It ain't gonna make it. Come on inside. Somebody's dyin' to meet you. Millie! I'd like you to meet my nephew Axel. Axel, this is Millie. How do you do? Aren't you overdoing it just a little, Millie? - Oh, sorry. Come on, sit down next to me, Axel. Lemme get a pair of pants on first. Stop singing! - I'm not singing. I count! Count the stitches! You've been on that jacket for a week. Finish it! Bye bye anybody. Sorry for interrupting you two, but I had to get my pants on. Leo's told me so much about you. I guess you know I'm gonna be your new aunt. You're his. fianc√©e. Yeah. You don't have to call me Aunt Mille, though. Unless you want to. How old are you? - Twenty three. We're almost the same age. Isn't that funny? Millie, please. Remember we talked about this? I'm sorry, Leo. Just a second. Leo's trying to teach me how to stop crying. Sweetheart, go in the other room and try on the other dress for Axel. That'll get your mind off. Go in the other room, sweetheart, and try the other dress on. It'll take your mind off crying. It's in the other room! I'm going. - Do me the favor. You know, Axel, my little Polish cupcake is very sensitive like the Eastern Europeans are. But she's very nice, right? - Very nice, Leo. And you know how old she is? - She's young. Damn right. That's success. To achieve that success, you need to sell cars. - I don't want to. Axel, my father had the first Cadillac dealership in Arizona in 1914! He had this magnificent dream, to sell as many cars as he could, and stack them up until they got high enough so he could walk to the moon. Isn't it beautiful? - Very beautiful, Leo. But they'd topple over. That's what I said, but he wanted me in the business, and I resisted, like you're resisting me. I'm not resisting, Leo. I just don't want to sell cars. What the hell are you afraid of? - Nothing. One thing I was sure of, my uncle Leo was definitely the hero of my childhood. The smell of his "Old Spice" carried me back more than the home movies did. It was the sweet, cheap smell of car dealers that took me back, and made me dissolve into the past. Leo was the last dinosaur that smelled of cheap cologne. And he believed in the American dream. I was crazy about him, because he believed in miracles. Even though he lived inside of life and sold Cadillacs, he always looked like a 10-year-old boy whose sleeves were too long. Leo gave me this movie camera. My mother always hoped I'd become the next Milton Berle. But dreams of houses, cars, and lawns aren't dreams when they become real. I understood what my mother meant by "Good morning, Columbus." Even if she didn't like what I was doing, I think she'd understand me. When I was 11, I got this really weird earache that wouldn't go away. A hundred doctors couldn't help me. So Leo went into Mexico, and brought back this fat lady witch doctor who fixed me right up. I was grateful, but I thought I might've been better off mute. All in all, I had a very happy childhood. My dad, a border guard, spent his life trying to stop people crossing lines. For 15 years, he'd smooth down the road between Mexico and Arizona, and every morning he'd be out there looking for footprints in the dirt. But my father always said that work was like a hat you put on your head. And even without pants, you didn't have to be ashamed of your ass. One thing I was sure about: The moment my parents died, my childhood was gone forever. Leo could never shake the guilt of my parents' death 6 years ago. Leo was driving the car that night. It got so bad that he even felt guilty if he used too much shaving cream. Four days after the funeral, I caught a train to New York City. If somebody asked me why I don't take the next train back to New York, it's because you can't say no to your childhood hero. I decided to be his best man, but one thing I was sure of: No matter how much I loved the smell of cheap cologne, I was never going to become my uncle, and I would never sell Cadillacs. Axel, if I died tomorrow, where would you be? You're not gonna die tomorrow. Who knows when I'll die? Your mother and father didn't. - That was an accident. No, it was stupidity. I shouldn't have been behind that wheel. Please, no guilt. Please. Look, I'm not going to allow you to become a bum in New York. I want you to stay here with me. Try it for one week. If you don't like it, then you go home. Okay? Axel, make "busy." Very, very busy. - Hello. Busy, but "willing to take time out from your schedule," Axel. Hello. Axel, make "sexy." Try it with your lips, pucker them up."Hello." No, more with the lips, you know, "Hello." Axel, I'm a gorgeous woman, and I have big, beautiful breasts. Now do "sexy." No, Axel. Breasts. You're talking art, you're talking gravity. You see this? - Yeah. Banana. - Proteins, proteins. Your organs produce a certain amount of proteins. Well, when you see a beautiful woman, you produce extra proteins. These extra proteins go directly to your brain. Where do you get all this stuff? - Scientific fact. Anyway, I've figured out a way to make it work for me. I call it "The Gaze." You look into a woman's eyes, and you think exactly what you want her to do for you. You're an actor? Oh my God, he's an actor! In 12 days, I have a gigantic performance I'm doing in Tucson. Maybe you'd like to come and see me? It's an audition. - What have we seen you in? Movies, TV shows? Do you go to foreign films? - No. - I'm a major star in Europe. Foreign films? Yeah, foreign films. Come here, close to me. Feel better now? Feel better now? You like that? Don't touch my face, okay? Oh, come on! - No, I'm not kidding. We can make love, but don't touch my face or my hair. Are all actors like that? - All the great actors are. Do you think anybody touches Brando's face? Or Pacino's? Do they touch De Niro's face? Or fucking touch Johnny Depp's face? No one's gonna touch Paul Leger's face, okay? I'm missing my favorite scene. I'm telling you, if I hear anything, I swear I'm gonna kill somebody. Go ahead and kill everybody! You're the tough guy! Kill Vicky, kill Salvy, Tommy Como, and me while you're at it! You're killing yourself, the way you eat, you fat fuck! What do you mean "kill you"? Me, kill me! Start here! Do me a fuckin' favor! - You meant something. You mentioned Tommy, Salvy, and you included you with them. You could have said anybody, but you said you and them. You've let this girl ruin your life. She really did some job on you! Look what she did to you! - You fucked my wife. You fucked my wife? I'm not going to answer. It's a sick question. I'm gonna leave. Very nice! You won't have troubles in your bed, so don't pick it out on me! Pig, pig, pig! Here! Hello. - Hello there. Adrian Del Monica. - How do you do? I'm not seein' it. - It's right in front of you! Yeah, but the vibe. It's all wrong. Mine is a '66, and it's old! I need a new one! I'm not giving you any more. 500 dollars, that's it. Are you listening to me? Don't even think about this, Mother! I can look if I want to. - Get out! You cannot pay for this. Yes I can! - No you can't, Mother! We made a deal, 500 dollars. - I don't know, well. How are you going to pay for this? - With your money. Which is half mine. - You know what, Mother? Fuck you! - Hello, Axel Blackmar. - Fuck you, too! What a beautiful dress. - I didn't come here for cheap compliments. I wasn't complimenting you. Sorry. Forgive me if I've offended you. I'm sorry. - You break, you pay! - No. Something wrong with it? Yeah, it's funny. - Thank you. That's very nice. Okay, right. The undercoating looks pretty good. The suspension is funny. Look, the right wheel, see? It's lower than the left. - It is. It's true. I didn't mean to insult. I just wanted to tell you how beautiful you look. Are you going to sell me a car or not? - Yes. Hello, Elaine. - Hi! I didn't know you worked here. - Temporary. Can you hold on a sec? I'll be right with you. Keep the daughter busy. - No. She's my first customer. The woman knows my face. It's better for the sale. It's better if I do it! - Don't ever touch my suit. Do me a favor, keep the daughter busy. Elaine, do you want to step outside? - Sure. Why's he looking at me like that? - Oh, he's a kid. He's. You ever think about suicide? Excuse me? - Suicide. Not recently. I think about it all the time. I want to come back as a turtle. Turtles are very nice. - Yes, they're the best. She's not my real mother. She married my father. He's dead. Both my parents are dead. - You sure become your parents. Even if they're not your real parents. I'm gonna kill myself before that. Really? - Yup. - Do you think you're overreacting? I don't have another match. Look at my hands! These aren't my hands. These are her hands. Do you like my legs? I hate them! Sometimes I'll be sitting, and I'll look down, and they're crossed just like hers. She does have nice legs. - Yes, she does. What's so bad about becoming your mother? Just wait. One day you'll wake up, and you'll be your father. Wrong. My uncle is my only family. - What does he do? He owns this place. - See what I mean? My father owned the 3rd largest copper mine in Arizona. Now I own the 3rd largest copper mine in Arizona. You're an idiot if you think you can escape it. Don't call me an idiot. Look, man. I gave you pazzazz, I offered you excitement, vibes, sexy good-looking, I even gave you Waaaaaagaaanganngg! What else could you want in a car? Good gas mileage. That's important. Mr. Del Monica, look at my lips. They're gonna say: Take your whsshht and get off my lot, before I punch you! Now git! Are you sore? - Out! Out! Buy a Ford! It's disgusting. Isn't it disgusting? Goodbye, chickenhead. - Axel. Hey Elaine, I was wondering. I know we just met, but I was wondering if the two of us could meet for a picnic or a soir√©e? I don't think so. Goodbye, Paul. What the fuck was that? - What? - I was waiting for that woman. Why was the door locked? - She was making a phone call. Really? Gentlemen, new showroom policy: As of today, if any customers come in dressed casually, they're yours. Starting now. Clear the area. Did you know that the warriors in Papua New Guinea avoid eating turtle meat before battle? They believe that turtles are very shy, and if they eat the meat, their enemies will become shy, and run away. Did you know that? - Well, it is fascinating. A Papua New Guinea story! - It's "Papua." - I don't give a shit! Wait! Isn't that the place where the village boys go into the woods, and they build a giant lean-to. a shack. - That's right! Then they take a woman they've captured from another village, and they put her inside the lean-to. And then every boy in the village goes in to lose his virginity. When the last boy in line is inside, the rest go to the shack and knock. You know the rest? - Yes. Why do they knock it down? Because they eat the poor bastard who was last, and the girl. Nice. - But they're natives. Natives. Oops! I've lost my napkin! There's plenty of room here. Why don't you move apart? We're fine. Grace! Axel, tell them the Eskimo movie dream thing. - Why don't you, Paul? Well, I'd love to hear it! Oh yes! My mother loves bed-time stories. Go on, Axel. This Eskimo, Dooey, is fishing. through a hole in the ice, and he catches this fish with both eyes on the same side of its head. - I'm sorry. But is that a real fish? - Yes, it's a real fish. And there's a storm coming, so Dooey gets on his dog sled, and travels through the ice. Stop! Grow up! Mother, now! - Mind your own business! .he builds a fire, and the snow from the tree falls down and puts the fire out. - Jesus. Sweetheart, go play. Is that it? - No. So now Dooey is dying, and his dog hypnotizes him, and brings him back to the igloo, where his wife rubs his body with a sponge, and brings him back to life. That's beautiful. It is beautiful. What was that? - My hand slipped. - A kid. A kid. Beautiful. It must give you great pleasure to be the life of the party, Mother. What party? Why must you try to screw every man you see under 30? - Grace, in Papua New Guinea, it's considered a right of passage. I don't want to hear it! In Papua New Guinea, if a woman wants to go to bed with a young man, she can. - Stop it! If she's older, it's okay! If you fucking say it one more time, I'm going to smash this table now! Let go! Paul, maybe we should go. - Sit down! - Go! Sit. - Go! No! You're not invited! Go! - Sit! I think we should stay here tonight. - No! You're not invited! My friends can stay if they want. You are disgusting. An immature girl in a sagging, old body! You're a pale imitation of a young me. - Except I didn't kill my husband! Tell your fucking new friends what that's like! - Shut up! - No, you go ahead! Shut up, Grace! You're disgusting! - Shut up! - No, 'cuz I said it! If it hadn't been for you, he'd still be alive! Fuck. That's it. I'm gonna kill myself right now. Okay, good. Go ahead! I'll give you a nice funeral. I'm sure you will. But you're not getting any of my money! I don't care. What else is new? Look, Mom! See? She's taking down her panty hose. I'm so glad I'll be dead for your birthday! - Your best present ever! This is it, Mom! Goodbye! Get away! Look, Mom! She has her panties around her neck! I'm eating! You're desperate and sick, Mom. You're sick. I can't live this way. I don't want to live this way. Why don't you have some dignity? - I'm not living this way. What do you want me to do? - No, this is good. What did you do that for? I didn't bite him! Mom! - You didn't have to hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding? Grace, please don't. Why aren't you looking, Mom? I'm a failure! I won't live this way. - I've been incorrigible. Mom, you made me do this. - Stop this! Fuck yourself! - Paul! Shut up! .cowardly lion. Grace, I'll never say it again. Liar! - No! I promise! You promise what? - Never to say "Papua." You're so evil, Mother! It's okay. I'll fight you standing on one foot, I'll fight you with my eyes closed! Elaine! You know when you're just about to go to sleep, or you're just sort of, you know, falling asleep. and you think you're really falling, so you catch yourself? That ever happen to you? You're not falling, just falling asleep. There you go. When I was a little girl, I always wanted to fly. From the top of the house. At night, I'd close my eyes, and imagine I was on the roof, looking down at my parents in their bed. And then I'd jump off. and I'd fly. While everyone was sleeping, I'd be soaring around, looking through their windows, flying. and resting in the trees. I always knew I could, but I never told them. Once someone knows, they can make you fall. After I'm big, I may start acting weird, stop returning calls, dressing all in black, fancy restaurants, the whole shtick. I want you to keep me in perspective. Paul, you already wear black. - You know what I mean. I just can't become a slave to my success. I have to stay myself. - I think she likes me. Did you see how she looked in my eyes? - The great Paul Leger! I started thinking about Paul's garbage theory, about male organs making extra proteins when a beautiful woman looks at you. And if she keeps on looking, they produce an extra protein, so deadly that one drop on the tip of an arrow could kill a fucking rhino in 2 seconds. I started to think what I wanted her to think, I looked in her eyes, and bingo! She was mine. Paul swears that cavemen used this deadly technique, and that the deadly male protein killed the dinosaurs, not the ice age. I think he saw it in a movie, and convinced himself it was true. That's how Paul escaped. And that's just what he did the next day. I never paid much attention to Paul's garbage theories. But then I realized he was right. I felt the proteins running through my body like broken glass. I tried to keep the proteins busy by making flying machines. I've never built a flying machine before. The proteins were making things fly in my head. The more I worked on it, the more I was sure it would fly. I just kept telling myself: It's gonna fly. Love hit me like an elephant, and I was thrown into a jungle of dreams. Mother was wrong about magnetic pulls. There was only one pull, and she was lying on my back. I wasn't "falling in love," because I never felt any weight, because I was "flying in love," for the first time in my life. Beautiful morning out, isn't it? Yes, it is. Sit down. I'll do this. Cereal? - Huh? - Cereal? Sure. I made some coffee for you. - Great, thanks. Did you fuck her? What? My mother. Did you fuck her? No. You liar! I can smell her on you. You're not the first, did you know that? Could I have some milk? She's had a lot of young ones like you, eats you up like chocolates. Could I have a spoon? - When she finishes a whole box, she sticks her finger down her throat, and it comes back up. You must have done well in school. - Straight A's. Food! - Good! Food! Hungry! I'm kind of hungry. - Hungry! Very good. - Good. Thirsty? Yes. Two. one. go! Almost! You ever thought about leaving? - Only a million times. Why don't you? - Soon I'm going to Papua New Guinea. Ever thought about Alaska? - Why would I go there? It's very beautiful. In my dream, y'know, the movie dream? There was a place on the Bering Sea. It's completely flat, and really, really quiet, y'know? Not even the wind whistling, because there's nothing there. And then there's a boat, and then. there's the Eskimos. - The Eskimos! The Eskimos push their old people out on ice floes to die! - No! They don't do that! Elaine, I was trying to tell you the other night. Eskimos believe that, even though you die, you're never really dead. What then? You're. infinity. They believe that when the physical suit of skin dies, it becomes part of the earth, but your soul. keeps going, into other things. like trees. or fish or rocks. or even other people, who actually are at that point, you. And if you don't like what you became? Shit! You wait a few years, and then you turn into something else. And love works the same way. So like, if you and I went down in a plane crash, that would be okay, because our souls would keep going. And we'd love each other over and over, from place to place, because it's infinity. And you want to go there with me? - Yeah. We would love each other over and over, for infinity. Elaine, we'll go to the Bering Sea, we'll be in love, and we'll never die. Never die. We can leave tomorrow, or we can leave right now. Okay. I hope we're not disturbing. - What are you doing here, Leo? Axel, is that how you say hello? - Just hold it. Mrs. Stalker, nice seeing you again. Axel, get your things, and we can get going. - I'm not going anywhere, Leo. I bet you're gonna come. - Paul, hold it. - Alright. Mrs. Stalker, if we could just be privately for a moment? Yes. So you're working on the old airplane? - Don't touch it! - I'm sorry. It's great! Great. You should be with your sick uncle, instead of playing with this nutcase. You know, this whole airplane. - What did you say? You know what this is for her? This is like a prescription. The name you called her! - Oh, I called her a name? - Yes. What did I call her? Can't remember. I think I called her. psycho! Psychopath! When are you gonna get it, Axel? Nothing like freshly brewed coffee. - It's instant. I knew that, Mrs. Stalker. I don't like conflict. - No one said you did, Mr. Smilie. - Sweetie. I know no one said that I did. But we should get down to business. - We don't have any, Mr. Smilie. Sweetie. Try that. Very nice. We do have business. I want him returned to me. He's a man, not an object, Mr. Smi. Sweetie. A stranger doesn't tell a father what a son is. You'll find it's not me who's the stranger. Mrs. Stalker, let me put it this way: You see that '65 Coup de Ville? - It's a '66, not a '65. I beg your pardon, it's a '65, and although it's very nice, it needs suspension work in the front. - The suspension is perfect. Fine. Then it needs a new alignment. Did you come here to give automotive advice? - Though an older model, it still has style. - Sugar? - I never use it. Now imagine if you will, a brand new Coup de Ville, fresh from the factory, sitting alongside your '65. The beautiful lines of the older model lose their elegance. The body sags, the finish is dull. You wash it, wax it, but it's still lifeless. - Mr. Smilie. There isn't a thing you can do to make it new again! Those two automobiles do not belong together. Am I clear? No, the only thing that's clear, Mr. Smilie. - No! Sweetie! .is that your attempt to insult me with car metaphors is incredibly immature! - Immature! Right! You could be his mother! But I'm not, Mr. Sweetie, I'm his lover. And I must tell you, your nephew is a wild animal in bed. Perhaps you might ask him for lessons. I had hoped his sexual awakening would've been with someone who knew the difference between making love and fucking! Come on! Coffee break is over, fellows. Back to work! Come on, Paul! Axel! Come on! - No! I'm not going! Paul, grab the other arm! I'm gonna kick the shit out of you, little son-of-a-bitch! Come on, Axel! - You don't realize how angry. - Just come along! I'm really mad! - Hands off him, Mr. Smilie! Elaine, you can't shoot me, I have this performance on Friday. It's an audition. It's not a performance. It's an audition. This is ridiculous. I mean. I mean, Mrs. Stalker, we've said a lot of things, and some were half kidding. Why don't you put down the gun? That I understand. That makes sense. No more of that. Axel, don't forget, Friday at 8:30! Yes, get in the car! Go back to where you should be! I knew if Paul saw me, he'd never understand that going to Papua New Guinea wasn't the answer. Flying was the secret. Columbus wouldn't think I was crazy for building a flying machine, because history is all dreams. No rules or books. It's just there, waiting to be discovered like when Columbus found this place. I don't know if he found his dream. Fuck with me, now! Because in the middle of a storm, you can't turn back, like Elaine. She could only sail straight ahead. If she asked me to build a rocket, and take her to another galaxy, I'd build a rocket. Very nice! Good. Excellent! You finished now? - No! - No? No! - You just finish. To remember my dreams, I turn them into stories. But dreams are like life. You can't catch them in your hands, because you can't really see them. If you believe in your dreams, no tornado, volcano or typhoon can knock you "out of love," because love exists on its own. Listen to me, if you ever touch this machine again, I'm going to kill you! Being caught in the dream of two women is the craziest storm of all. The battle isn't good and evil, but between weaker and stronger. The weaker is desperate for air. At this moment, my feet were planted in the ground like a tree, and if you moved to one side, you become the storm. Even though I was ready to kill Grace, I wasn't sure which side I'd move to. So I tried to anchor myself until the storm passed. Disgusting! Turn around! That's the second time. - What is? Where were you two minutes ago? - Here? You smashed the flying machine again. - Nope. Because I don't care. - Liar! - I was here. - Prove it! How? You see me playing, right? To my turtles. - Why's your hair wet? - Because I just took a bath. You like these turtles? - Yeah. - If you want these bastards to live, stay away from that flying machine. - I'm scared. - Are you scared? I'm scared. - Are you scared? D'you think it'll fly? - I'm more than sure. Let's do it then! I can't wait any longer. I'm flying! I'm flying! Sometimes you have to crash into a tree to know what to do, and realize the secret of anything is meaningless. My English teacher talked about this Russian guy, who said that if you see a gun in the first half of a book, you can be sure it'll go off in the second half. Somebody was going to use that gun. The minute I saw the revolver in the barn, I started getting nervous, because I realized it was the revolver from my dream. Never did I think I'd be an Eskimo in the desert, knowing I had to kill something to put it out of its misery. Suddenly, it was all clear to me, like wiping the window in the rain. I was afraid if I didn't do anything, at any moment something would blow up, possibly me. So I decided to do it, just to keep from killing myself. The only problem was that they were both so miserable, I didn't know which one to shoot. I've been waiting for you. - What? Are you gonna use it? Don't talk to me. - Do it! What are you afraid of, Axel? Nothing. Do it! Do it, Axel, do it! - Shut up! What are you afraid of, Axel? - Nothing. Do it! - Shut up! Do it! - Please shut up, Grace. - Do it! Do it! - Shut up! If you're not going to shoot me, sit down on the bed. You didn't come to shoot me. You came to make my mother happy. - Don't talk! Axel. - Turn around! - You know what, Axel? I had a friend just like you. When we were little, we would rollerskate on my huge roof, no people, and I each time I would get closer to the edge, and he was standing behind me, and wouldn't let me go over. Okay. It's okay. I have a game for you. Okay. - Okay. Old game, strict rules. It's your turn. - No. You don't say no to this game. Okay, I'll go. Grace. please! Don't. - It's a game, Axel. Stop! Don't do it! My mother's sleeping. Okay, Axel, Look. Look at me! - Fuck you! No! Here. Take it. I don't want it. What are you, afraid? - No. I just don't feel like dying. That's not fair. - Not fair? You came in to kill me, and we're playing a game, and you're breaking the rules! Axel, what are you, this frightened little boy? You afraid of everything? Axel? You're just afraid, huh? You're just a little boy, you're so scared. Take the gun! Take it! Go! No! No, Axel! You can't do that! That's breaking the rules! Lt'll be okay. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! Our next act, Mr. Paul. Ledger! Leger. Paul Leger. - Paul Leger! My n. Hello. My name is Paul Leger. You may be wondering what Leger means. You may be wondering what kind of name it is. Italian? Swedish? Well, actually, it's French, and it literally means, "Born to act." And that's what I'm going to do this evening. Alfred Hitchcock style, performing from the classic, "North by Northwest." The famous scene in which Carey Grant is. being chased by a crop-dusting plane. Fuck! Shit! Thank you very much, Paul Leger! - I'm not done! I'm not done! I'm not done! Thank you! A one? One? I was brilliant! Can't you see brilliance? A one! I should have got a ten! A ten! A one! A one! On amateur night? Axel, I really have to talk to you. - Hi, Millie. Sit down. A one? What do you know about art? - Can we go over there? - Sure. Elaine. This is Elaine. This is Millie. - Hello. Leo's fianc√©e. This is Grace. Grace, this is Millie. Okay. Where is he, Millie? Leo! He's over here. He's locked himself in the bedroom. Leo, can I come in? - Open the door, Leo! Open up! - Go away! Let's go inside. - Alright. One. two. three! Millie! Get an ambulance! You okay? Shouldn't I say something? - To who? - Your parents? They're dead, Leo. I know that, but should I say something or not? Don't talk like that. You'll be fine. - I know, I'm gonna be fine. Promise you'll take care of Millie. - Don't say that! Don't talk, just promise. Alright, I promise. Good, now that that's taken care of, I want you to. buy yourself a few nice suits and go back to New York. I want to stay with you. I want to sell cars. I don't want you to sell cars! You'll grow up soon enough! I am grown up, Leo. I love you. I'm okay, I'm just. just stacking cars. I need you to help me. It's too late. They're not driving the big models anymore. Leo, we can work in the showroom, we can sell cars together, you and me. Too late, Axel, the dream's over. - I've been practicing my "Hellos." You want to hear my "Hellos"? I got to start climbing. It's a long way, Axel. It's a long way to the moon. You never came back. There was a lot of legal stuff to take care of. I'm sorry. So not even a phone call? I know, Elaine. I just got caught up in what was going on. I'm really sorry. I wanted to call a thousand times. I'm really sorry. So you just decided to pop over for a quick cup of coffee? You can just waltz over here? - Please, it's your birthday tomorrow. What do you care? - My uncle died. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner, I had to take care of the funeral. - There's no sympathy here! Is that okay with you? Please, let's celebrate your birthday. What do you care? You know what you should do? Turn around and go back. Just go back where you came from, OK? How's Millie, huh? Where are you going? - What did you just say? I should go. Are you going? Are you just going to go now? How long are you going for? Are you going forever? - Do you want me to stay or go? I want you to go! - Fine! - I want you! I want you to come! So what do you want to do? You want to go or stay? I want to stay. I don't think you need this right now. She'll be okay. She just gets like this. Alright, but I'm not staying in there tonight, okay? It's going to be okay. Nothing is going to be OK! Come on! Elaine, wait! I brought you a present. I don't want it! - You don't even know what it is! Elaine, you don't know what it is. Come on, Elaine, please. Take it. I don't want it. - It's a present! Thank you for the wad of paper. - It's two tickets for Shishmaref. It's right on the Bering Sea. Train tickets? - Yeah. - You expect me me to go all the way to Alaska by train? - You said you didn't want to fly again. - No, I didn't! Yes, you did! - No, I didn't! - Yes, you did! - No, I didn't! I want to fly there. - Okay. I'm gonna cancel the train tickets and make a plane reservation, okay? Alright. - Stop! What? - You think I'm old, don't you? No! - Yes, you do. - Don't tell me what I think. That's why the train, you're ashamed! - No, I'm not! I'm going to trade these tickets in. - I don't mind. You're right. I'm old, you're young. It's disgusting! Just stop it! - Can't you find someone your own age? Why me? - I want to be with you! - I don't need your pity! It's not pity, Elaine. I'm trying to give you love. - Love! What do you know about love? - What do you know? - You're a child! What you need is someone sweet. and beautiful. and young! - Like who? Like Millie. She's like Switzerland, beautiful but dumb. - Listen. She was my uncle's fianc√©e. I don't want her. I want you! This is crazy! - Ronny used to say that, and Grace still says it, "Take your medication, Mother, or you'll be crazy." But he hurt her, and I killed him, and I'm not crazy! - And I'm not your husband! Do you understand? You are fucking crazy! - Get out! I'm not damn leaving! - Get out of my house! You asked me to stay! - I did not! I want you to go! Go! - I'm fucking tired of this game. What do you want? What do you want? - I want you to understand me! You know something? - What? - Paul was right. Paul was right? - Paul was right. Paul was right? You listen to him? What did he say? Nothing. - What? Not a fucking thing! - I'm going to find out. who I am. You're going nowhere! Where are you gonna go? Let me go! - Elaine, come on, you're not crazy. Show me you're not crazy! - Let me go! I don't think you're old. I think you're beautiful. Don't say it again. Let me go! Stop! Elaine! - Get out of my life! - Put it down! Put it down! - Get out of my house! That's enough! - No! That's enough! I can't believe she did it! I'm going to fly! You fucked my wife? You fucked my wife? Oh, fuck! Come on! Listen! That is Mexico! This is America. We speak English. - Yes. - Look at his face! What do you mean? Shit! Paul, will you quit it? - I'm having a nightmare! You're distracting her. She's trying to fly the plane. Please! - This isn't happening! I hate this film! Life is beautiful. I think what you did is beautiful. Thanks. I'm sorry about your uncle. Yeah, me too. Where d'you think he is right now? Right now? He's probably on the moon, driving a golden Cadillac. Life is beautiful. Grace? - Yeah. D'you think it would be really bad if. I kissed you? - No. No? You want to hear it? I'm sorry. - Are you going to listen? - Yes. - Alright. Elaine is like a blueberry pie. The pie is good, but it's very messy. She's a kind of trick. - Oh my gosh! - Let's say she's a blueberry pie. She looks good. She smells good. Probably even tastes good, but there's one problem: When you take a bite, you've got pins poking you in the mouth. Choking you in the mouth. You understand what I'm telling you? Good boy. Do you understand? Do you understand? - Yeah. - Okay. These philosophies, with pies and bananas and Q-tips and. I'm an artist. You're a bullshit artist. - Bullshit artist, artist, whatever. Art is art. - Axel, it's my birthday. Dance? Run! Beautiful. Sure. I was right. - What time is the train for Alaska? You mean the plane? - No, the train. We're flying. Didn't you fly all day? You can't take that all the way to Alaska, it's too cold. I don't want to fly there. - I already changed the reservations. We have to take the train. It's safer. So you want me to switch the plane reservations into train reservations? - Yes. - Okay. It's time. 37, 38, 39, 40. Stairs, stairs, stairs. Wall. Axel? Axel, here, here. I'm sorry. Don't touch me. Watch my face. Axel? - Watch my face. Wait. Wait. Stairs! - Stairs! Axel! - Stairs! Tree! Tree and table! I can't see nothing. Axel! I can't see! Wait for me! I found it! What? - Here! She found it! - Here! - She found it! - Wait for me! I found it! Come on, I found it! Paul! - Axel! I can't see nothing! Axel? - Where are you? Here? Okay everybody? It's raining! It's raining! It's raining! Come on, it's raining. It's raining. It's fucking raining! Mom! Mother! - Yes! I'm coming over, mom! Here we go! Happy Birthday! - I love you. - I love you! Happy Birthday! - I love you. I'm going in! Go play. Go play. Did I tell you about when Axel treated me for my 21st birthday dinner? My good pal? - No. - Can I tell her the story? Or would you like to? - Go ahead. - Anyway, he decided he was going to take me out for dinner and pay for it himself. He'd saved up some money. We go to this restaurant. This place we used to go with Leo. We drove up there together. and we had this great big meal. I knew it would be expensive, but he said, "The sky's the limit." After dinner I went to the bathroom, and when I come out, I see him standing by the door, and he looks unusually nervous. And the waiter is standing by our table, flapping the check, kind of pointing at the check. And I look at Axel. - You coming? I go up to him, "What's going on? Did you pay?" Will you help me wrap the presents? "You said you were paying." He made me bring no money. I say, "Whaddya mean you have no money, Axel?" Next thing I know, we're being chased by our waiter, who was fifty, but, like, mean. Hi! - Hi! What's that? No! Very nice! I want you to have something. For me? - Uh huh. It's beautiful. - I want you to have the world. Thank you. I was thinking about what you said. - What did I say? That I was supposed to be with you. - Hand me that tape? Yeah. When I first met her I felt something, kind of strong. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know what to call it. Now everything's turned around, and she's like. She's like this cloud that I can see through, and on the other side I see you. And I feel something very strong. I think I know what to call it. That make any sense? Put your finger here? Yup. What do you think? About what? - About us, kind of. belonging together. Will Paul like this lamp? He'll love it. What do you think? I think 2 wrongs don't make a right. Meaning what? - Meaning us. Two wrongs. What if we're two rights, and everybody else is wrong? Either way, we're going to be screwed. - But screwed together. I wish I could take you with me. - Let's go right now! No trains, no planes, no fucking doors. We'll go right out the window! I have to take care of some business. The house? - Yes. Last night I dreamt I'm in the desert, and my house is tied around my neck, and my body's breaking under its weight, and it's engulfed in flames. The flames are climbing the rope, and they almost reach my neck, and before they do, I wake up, and I know that I have to get rid of this house. I want you to promise me something. - What? When you're done with the house, we can go away. Come on! Come on! I promise. You promise? - Yeah. I promise. Good. It's a funny story. I have a lot of funny stories. Here they are! Is this is for me? You bought this for me? Very nice. Here. Thank you. You open yours first. Look what I got from her. I feel like a clam, right? I've always wanted to be a big sea turtle. They're always happy. How do you know that it's happy? - Because they're always smiling. Turtles don't smile. - They do. - They don't. I don't think turtles smile. - They do, and they live forever. Who wants to live forever? I'd like to die when I'm 35. You want to die when you're 35? - Yes. - How? How? I'd take off all my clothes and get into a bathtub of ice-cold vodka. I'd have the TV in the room, watching "North by Northwest," when the airplane scene comes, I'd pull the TV into the tub. I hate that film! I'd like to die as a little girl. I'd go up on the roof and jump off, and I'd be flying. I'd look down and see all the people, but instead of falling, I'd just fly, higher and higher. What did I get? What is this thing? - Lava lamp. - Nice. Axel, what about you? - It's very nice. I'd like to be. I'd like to be thrown off a cliff, and my body could smash into the rocks. But I wouldn't want a lot of people at the funeral, looking at me. You'd be smashed up. Why would you want them to look at you? - I don't want to be in the box, people staring at me. You'll wind up living forever. - No. Grace, what about you? Me? I'm not gong to die. I'm going to live forever, until one day I'll wake up and I'll be a turtle. Turtle-Grace! Sing it! Night. - Good night. I love you. Good night. - Why "Good night"? We just got by the fire. We're having a good time. - I have to get up and do things. Stay a little while. - Come on. Come on! - Okay, I'll see you. "Good bye." Come on, Grace! Is something wrong? Did I say something? Come on! Axel, I'm tired too. - In the middle of the song! Are you coming, Axel? - Yup. Good night. Just leave me in the middle of a song! I had a great moment! Go up and sleep, leaving me soaking wet here! Good night, Paul. - Night, Elaine. Wasn't that a funny story I said? What do you know about funny? Throw your dinner on the floor. No one wants to cut the birthday cake. Well, I'll cut the cake, thank you. Happy Birthday to me! Happy Birthday to Paul! That's me! Paul! Looks like she left about 45 candles off the cake. Alright! Good! Enough, guys. Enough! Stop! Come on. I've got to work. Time is money. Have a drink. You need a drink. Go home, suffer with your families. Suffer like animals! Why do I have to talk to four fake artists? That's my day! So good! "The Godfather"! .big deal, and there was something in it for me if I could help him out. He said you were being tough on the negotiations, but if they could get a little help and close the deal fast, it'd be good for the family. - Do you believe that? Do you believe that? - He said there was something in it for me! On my own! - I've always taken care of you. Taken care of me? You're my kid brother! You take care of me? You ever think about that? You ever once think about that? Send Freddo off to do this! Let Freddo take care of some Mickey Mouse night club. Send Freddo to pick up somebody at the airport! I'm your older brother, and I was stepped over! - Pop wanted it. It ain't the way I wanted it! I can handle things, I'm smart! Not like everybody says, I'm smart and I want respect! Tell me about the investigation. The Senate lawyer, he belongs to Wroth. Freddo, you're nothing to me now, not a brother, not a friend. I don't want to know you, or what you do. I don't want to see you in hotels. I don't want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there. Understand? Mikey! I don't want anything happenin' to ya, not while our mother is alive. Grace! Go home! Grace! No! Grace! You promised! For the last time, I heard a voice that wasn't my mother's, whispering, "Good morning, Columbus." It didn't bother me. Then the voice became lower and turned into a wind that sent the peaceful smell of cheap cologne. And I realized, like Columbus, I had to live in a world of cheap cologne, and I wasn't sure any discovery in America was possible anymore. Smoothing roads and counting fish wasn't science, but somehow it prepared me for the ocean. I don't know why, but my father's words jumped back into my head, that work was like a hat on your head, and even if you didn't have any pants, you shouldn't be ashamed of your ass, because you had a hat. And even though my uncle Leo worked for everything he got, I'm not sure he got what he needed. Elaine and Grace were really one person, too big for one body, no matter how much they loved or hated each other. After the storm, I couldn't say life was beautiful, but all I kept hoping for was the Eskimo boy in my dream to run out of one of these doors and hug me. Though I no longer felt like a fish, and realized I knew nothing, I was happy to be alive. What a wonderful fish. - What a wonderful fish! Yes, wonderful. We have to catch it today. We will catch it today. Do the eyes start on either side of the head? Yes, it's a very strange fish. When it becomes an adult, one eye moves across, joins the other. Why do they do that? - Maybe it's like a. A badge of maturity. They passed through the nightmare. - Nightmare? The nightmare that separates children from adults. Come. - Quickly. We got it! We got it! We got it! Slowly. Slowly! Slowly! Don't move! Don't move! Look, its color changes to match the ocean floor. - Camouflage. If one Arrowtooth Halibut sinks on top of the head of another, the bottom one doesn't make a fuss, but waits until the other one moves. I wouldn't like anyone to sit on my head. - You are still young. One eye begins to move to the other side. Then it's better to have both eyes on the same side? - No. Different. What do you lose? Your other side. You lose something, but you also gain something. Subtitles Jeffrey McGuire Film und Video Untertitelung Gerhard Lehmann AG Come on, you lazy Cro-Magnon! Ohh! Hey! Back to work!

Someone to carry on the proud name of Rubble. - Think I'll be a good daddy? - Well, you're bound to find something you're good at. Yeah, sure. Hey! - Uncle! - Heh heh heh. You know, Fred, Betty and I really owe it all to you. We would've never qualified to adopt had it not been for the money you gave us. Remember, Barn, that's between you and me. - I'd like to tell the world what a great guy my best buddy is! - No, no, no! True, it was a selfless, noble act, if I do say so myself. My only reward will be your happiness. I don't need to go blabbin' my good deeds all around. You're afraid to tell Wilma, aren't you? Afraid? Now, let's get this straight, Rubble. I don't need permission from my wife to make a decision. In my cave, I reign supreme! Su-preme! - I won't tell her, Fred. - Thanks, pal. Hiya, Timmy! Here you go! Shoot, shoot, shoot! Hey, Charlie! - Huh? - Wilma! I'm home! No, Dino! No, no! No, Dino! Bad boy! Bad dog! - Good doggie! - Bad Dino breath. Fred! Do you have to get Dino so wound up when you come home? It's not my fault. Maybe he'd calm down if we had him fixed! What? Here comes the big Daddysaurus! How was your day, dear? I think my Brontocrane's pregnant again. I tell ya, you forget to lock her up one Saturday night. - Comfortable, Fred? - On my way. All I need's a brew and a good scratch. Which one do you want to do first? It does my heart good to see you relaxing. after a hard day at the quarry. I'm telling you, I married the pick of the litter. Fred, our garbage disposal has been acting up a lot lately, so I decided that it was time to buy a new one. But when I went to take money out of our savings account, - guess what? - New garbage disposal? New garbage disposal? Why throw good money down the drain? There's nothing wrong with this one. All right, you. Say "ahh. " Uh-uh. Do you have any idea why there's no money in our savings account? Aha! There's your problem right there. All right, you! Spit it out! Where's the money, Fred? Something happened to it. There, I said it. We have scrimped and saved for that money. And every time we get ahead, you have to go blow it on some harebrained scheme! Now, see here, Wilma! In this cave, I am the king! - And. - And what, Fred? And you have every right to know, my queen. I gave it to Barney. - You what? - I know I should've consulted you, but Barney Rubble's my neighbor, my lodge brother. and my best friend since the first time I went through the fifth grade! Fred Flintstone! Wilma, without that money, they wouldn't be allowed to adopt a baby. So go ahead, yell, scream, let the fur fly. Give the neighbors something to talk about! What you have just done for the Rubbles. is the sweetest, most generous thing I ever heard. And I adore you for it. Mmm. I also bought a new bowling ball. Wait! Come on, honey! - Watch your step. - Sit down. All right, all together, folks. Betty, sit down and relax. Oh, I can't, Wilma. It just hit me. From now on, I'll be spending 24 hours a day. attending to the every need of a helpless little boy. Then again, maybe it won't be such a big adjustment after all. Fred! And promise me you won't say anything like you did when you saw my sister's baby. The kid had a tail. Was I supposed to pretend I didn't notice? Hello, Mommy and Daddy! I have someone who wants to meet you! Aah! Well, it's not exactly what we pictured, but. - we'll love him like he was our own. - No, no, no. This little fellow belongs to the Hendersons. - So glad you'll be nursing. - Congratulations. Mr. and Mrs. Rubble, this is your little boy. Barney, isn't he precious? - Precious? They'd have been better off with the monkey. - Fred! - Does he have a name? - Bamm-Bamm. - Is that short for somethin'? - Bamm-Bamm-Bamm. You're going to have to take it slowly with this one. He doesn't speak yet, and he's a little skittish around humans. But then again, I would be too if I had been raised by wild mastodons. -Mastodons? -Let's not nitpick. A mammal's a mammal. Well, sounds to me like all he needs is a little lovin'. Ohh. Come here, little guy. - Aah! He growled. Yeah. - That's cute. It's okay, little guy. I'm your da-da. Bamm-Bamm! Oh! Barney! - Oh, Betty! - Bamm-Bamm! No! Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm, wait! Stalactite, stalagmite Hold your baby very tight - Come back! - Come here, little guy! - Bamm-Bamm! Bamm! Bamm-Bamm! - Ohhh! - Rock with the caveman - Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm! Roll with the caveman Shake to the caveman - Break with the caveman - Oof! - Make with the caveman Okay, give me a C-A-V-E - Who-o-o-a! - M-A-N, Caveman - Whoa! What an arm! "And Cinderocka married the handsome prince, and. Yeah! Okay, Brother Flintstone, we need a strike to win. Can you do it? Is the Earth flat? - Come on, Freddie! - Come on, hit it! Come on, twinkle toes. Fred! - Waka-waka-woo! - Waka-waka-woo! - Wooga-wooga-wee! - Wooga-wooga-wee! Piki-piki-piki! Poki-poki-poki! Ahhhhhhhh-oooh! Lava juice! I would like to propose a toast. to not only a great bowler, but a great human being. And no offense to you guys. "Since I was just a lad of ten, I've had the very bestest friend. He may be big, he may be loud, so you'll never lose him in a crowd. But for my friend the special part. is what's behind his ribs. his heart. I owe my son to him, and now. I stand before my peers and vow. The end. - That was beautiful, Barn. - I meant every word of it, Fred. - Care to join me in a cold one? - Love to. It doesn't get any better than this. Ohh! No. Look at him. Drunk as a skunkosaurus. Aaaah! Mother, I can handle this. What's that old fossil doing here? Did the tar pits back up again? Well, somebody has to be here looking after my daughter and grandchild. while you're out carousing with a bunch of Neanderthals. Oh, really? Well, for your information, the lodge no longer accepts Neanderthals. He robs your nest egg to bail out that little troll next door. while my daughter has to wash her clothes in the river. - I got half a mind. - Oh, don't flatter yourself. That's it! Where's my club, Wilma? You just try it, fatso! - If you was a man, I'd knock you. - Enough! Mother! Fred! You two should be ashamed of yourselves! I've got my hands full just being ashamed of him. - You got your hands full when you scratch your neck! - Stop it! Both of you! Mother, Fred is a loving husband and a good provider. Oh, really? What has he ever provided you besides shade? Oh, Wilma, you could've married Elliot Firestone, the man who invented the wheel. Instead you picked Fred Flintstone, the man who invented the excuse. Let me tell you something, Pearl. I'm not going to be a nobody all my life. One of these days, I'm gonna be a somebody, a real somebody! We'll live in luxury, and Wilma will have everything she deserves. When that day comes, you'll be so busy eatin' crow. you'll be passing feathers for a month! Oh, you poor, poor dear. And when I think of all the sacrifices your father made for you. Lambs, oxen, your brother Jerry. - Well. - Oh, Wilma. Do your mother a favor. Just call Elliot Firestone. Even if things don't work out, he can give you a great deal on some tires. - Yes, Mother. - Byesie-bye. I'll show her. I'll show everybody. I know you will, Fred. - Call me fatso. - Let's get some sleep. Hey, what's the special? This job sucks. - What you got today? - Lizard and onions. Want half? Sure. I hear that eatin' too much red meat is bad for you. What a load of bunk. My father ate it every day of his life; he lived to the ripe old age of 38. May I have your attention! I have a very important announcement to make. - You found out why the guys in pit 6 are losing their hair? - Yes! And we are currently in the process of refuting the results of that investigation. But today I am here. to formally announce the creation. of Slate and Company's executive placement program. Hold your questions, please. That's right; this Saturday an aptitude test will be given, granting one of you the opportunity. to crawl out of the primordial ooze. and be somebody. A vice president at Slate and Company, with an obscene salary and a shiny nameplate. Ooh. Good luck, and may the best biped win. An executive? This is my chance to be somebody. Be somebody. Whee! Higher, Bamm-Bamm, higher! Higher! Higher! Whee! - Wilma. - Hmm? - How did you get rid of the ring around the collar? - By washing Fred's neck. Hmm. You know, if Fred scores the highest on that test, you'll be able to hire someone to do your laundry for you. If Fred scores the highest on that test, I'll have to hire someone to revive me. Oh, it's true; Fred's no Albert Einstone. - But he may surprise you. - Whee! Well, maybe. - He has been studying day and night. - Whee! I know! I've never seen him so excited about something you couldn't spread mayonnaise on. Barn, I've been thinking about this executive job. It's not me. Cooped up inside some swank office all day, kissing the big shot's feet. Not Fred Flintstone. Why, good afternoon, Mr. Vandercave. - My, that's a handsome pelt you're wearing today. - Thank you. Your attention, please! Please take your seats. And. welcome. You will have one hour to complete the exam. Please carve all answers with a well-sharpened No. 2 chisel. On behalf of Slate and Company, I want to wish you all the very best of luck. Let's begin. Eeee! Ohh. Chisels down. Please slide your answer slab. into the numbered envelope provided. and stack them neatly on my desk. Psst! Hey, Fred! How'd you do? How'd I do? How'd I do? - You want me to take that up for you? - Yeah. Thanks, pal. "And I stand before my peers and vow, Ahh. Well, Cliff, the test results are in. And our unsuspecting dupe is? Believe it or not, the one who scored the highest was Fred Flintstone. - That big ape? - No, the big ape got a 65. Flintstone? Oh, this can't be right! He must have cheated. He's dense, he's witless. He's perfect. The results of the exam were very competitive, and just because an applicant was not selected. is no indication of lack of ability. - I am pleased to announce. - I know a kiss-off when I hear one; let's go. that the newest member of our executive rank. is Mr. Fred Flintstone! - Huh? - Barney, quick. What's my name? - Fred Flintstone! - Don't toy with me, Barney. You did it, Fred! You made it! Yabba-dabba-dabba-doo! Good morning, Mr. Vice President. Good morning, Mrs. Vice President. Oh, Dino! Oh, Dino, no! Aaah! - Hey! - Mmm! Atta baby! Heh heh heh. Ohh. Good boy, Dino. Well, how do I look? Daddy pretty. It's perfect! Yeah. Snazzy. What am I gonna call you now? Boss? Chief? No, a simple "Your Highness" will do. No, Barn, I'm not gonna be one of these guys that makes it and then forgets where he came from. The first thing I'm gonna do is get everyone in the quarry some vacation time. And maybe a health plan with free foot care. I'd settle for them little packets of ketchup for the lunch room. - I'm only one man. - Not from the back. Hey, hey. Well, I guess this is it, Mr. Flintstone. Go get 'em, big guy. - Hey, Barn. - Yeah, Fred? Could you spot me a couple bucks for lunch? You're right, Fred. Nothing's changed. Welcome aboard, Flintstone! We're glad you're here. Nice suit! You know, Fred, any gravel brain. can shovel rock down in the quarry, but up here. - Do you know what we do up here? - Me and the guys have always wondered. We interface, Flintstone. We strategize, analyze, conceptualize, prioritize. When do we eat? Fred, until this moment I wasn't sure we'd picked the right man. Now I'm certain. Fred Flintstone, you've arrived. - This is my office? - That's right. - This is my chair? - Mm-hmm. Not to throw too much at you on your first day, but this big thing here is your desk. - My desk? - Watch out for your fingers in the drawers. Am I interrupting? Not at all. Fred, I'd like you to meet your new secretary, - Miss Sharon Stone. - My secretary? Personal secretary, Mr. Flintstone. That is, of course, if you want me. Great. Well, I'm sure the two of you would like to get. better acquainted. Mr. Flintstone, I'd like you to know. that I enjoy working long hours, late nights, even weekends. So feel free to use me. however you see fit. Now, can I get you anything? - Coffee? - Sure. - How would you like it? - In a cup? Bold choice, Mr. Flintstone! You'll go far in this company. Take a memo. Cliff, let's play golf. We can prioritize, conceptualize and, uh. tenderize. Executively yours, Fred Fli. Aaaaah! Are there six or seven "I"s in "Fli. Aaah"? - Who said that? - It was I, your dictabird. - Dicta-what? - Dictabird. Read my beak. "Cliff, let's play golf. Wow. Wow! Mr. Flintstone, I'd like to warn you that management positions. are fraught with peril. Whenever you find yourself in a befuddled state, I urge you to avail yourself. of my experience and sage advice. Oh, really? - Listen, birdie, let's get the pecking order straight here. - Hmm. I don't need any help from you. I'm Vice President of. Of, uh. Industrial procurement. How about that? Excuse me. Hey, guys! Guess what I am! Vice President of Industrial Procurement! Oy! Whew. Yeah. There. I'm all done with the requisition forms. What do you think? It's perfect. Looks just like the real one. Mr. Flintstone, you are about to embezzle a great deal of money. Unfortunately, for you, we get to keep it. We can have Flintstone sign these right away. Not just yet. Creatures like this Flintstone are. primitive, prone to irrational bouts of integrity. We've got to make absolutely certain he'll do whatever we say. Fred is the greatest bowler on Earth. "Fred is the greatest bowler on Earth. " Now you talk, and see how much I can remember. Workin' hard? Okay, Fred, are you ready for your first executive action? Whatever you need, consider it done! Good! I want you to fire Bernard Rubble. Done. What? Fire Barney? Why? Well, for starters, he scored the lowest on the management aptitude test. He's an imbecile. The company can't afford to have dead weight like him on the payroll! But, Mr. Vandercave, he's got a new kid, a mortgage. I'm his best friend. I can't. Fred, if you don't fire him, I will. And then I'll fire you. Come on, Fred, usually you're yakkin' my ear off, but today you haven't said two words. Something exciting must have happened up there. - You don't want to know, Barn, believe me. - Sure I do, Fred. You're the first one of us to make it out of that quarry. Look at me. I'll probably be working there the rest of my life. No, you won't, Barn. Take my word for it. Come take a look. It's a dish in the shower, you keep the soap in it. - Barney, there's something we gotta talk about. - Yeah, yeah. Later, Fred. Surprise! Way to go, Fred! - Wilma, you shouldn't have. - Hmm? I didn't. This was all Barney and Betty's idea. Aren't we lucky to have friends like them, Fred? Ohh! There he is! There's my big, handsome son-in-law! Have you lost weight? Have we met? Can I have everybody's attention, please? I've got something I'd like to say. I hope it's not another poem. Betty, Bamm-Bamm and I could not be happier, - even if it was me that got that job. - Aww! So we got a little something to show how proud of you we are. Congratulations, big guy! Barney, I can't accept this. - Sure, you can. - No, I can't. Take it back. - We can't. We had your initials branded on it. - It's yours, Fred. - No, it's not! - Fred, what's wrong with you? It's a lovely gift. - He's thrilled to receive it. Aren't you, Fred? - No! - Don't you like the color? - It's not the briefcase, it's not the color. - I just can't take anything from you. - But, Fred. Take a hike, shorty. My Freddie doesn't want that tacky thing. - How come, Fred? - Because you can't afford it, Barn. Ohh. Sure I can, pal. Not anymore. - You're fired. - Fired? Well! Let's not let a little thing like this spoil the party! Conga line! Conga! Conga! Don't worry about me, Fred. - I've been working in that quarry since it was eight feet deep. - Atta boy! There could be a whole new world opening up for me. - Maybe I'll take in that franchise show this weekend. - That's the spirit. There's just one thing I gotta know. After all these years, how come they're canning me? Barn, you're a wonderful father, a loving husband, a hard worker, and one heck of a little bowler. But, Barn, none of that counts on an aptitude test. You got the lowest score, pal. The lowest score? Wilma, that is beautiful! - Well, I have always wanted. - You can't catch me! - a Halstone original. - Mmm. - Ohh! - Now, Wilma, don't be silly! Your husband's a big executive. You can afford it. Charge it! Bamm-Bamm! Ohh! Bamm-Bamm! - Noooooo! - Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm! Gentlemen, please. I cannot endorse this modernization. if it means laying off all those workers. Some have been here since the beginning of time. What if I could quadruple your income? I'll miss them. You were saying? Sorry I'm late. I had car trouble. Picked up a nail. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Flagstone. - F. - May we continue? Mr. Slate. Gentlemen. I have. a vision. While our competitors are mired in the Stone Age, I give you. the future! - Ohh. - Slate and Company. will revolutionize the building industry. by providing simple, low-cost, modular housing units. Impossible, you say? Let me demonstrate. Through the miracle of geothermal power, the raw material is elevated to the second stage, - where our steam-powered conveyor belt carries. - Steam? He's a madman! Steam-powered conveyor belts. carry the product to be shaped, cleaned, inspected. and delivered to discerning consumers worldwide. And did I mention increasing our profit margin. - fourfold? - Very impressive, Mr. Vandercave. Very impressive. I think we should implement this system immediately. Yes? Excuse me, Mr. Slate. I know I'm the new man here, but I don't think you hired me to sit around and look pretty. I hate to bust your bubble, but if you build houses this small, who's gonna live in 'em? - Excuse me. Mrs. Rubble? - Yes. There seems to be a slight problem with your credit card. Really? And what would that be? It's no damn good! I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life. -Go and play, children. -Wilma, I promise you I'll pay you back. - I just don't know when. - Oh, now, Betty. - It can't be as bad as all that. - But it is. Barney's still out of work; we've nearly spent all of our savings. And, Wilma, what if the adoption agency finds out? I don't want to lose my baby. I swear, Betty, Fred and I would never let that happen. - Oh, Wilma. - Oh, Betty. Pterodactyl alert! Mommy, help! - Oh, yuck! - Ecch! I feel a paid vacation for everyone in the quarry would raise morale. and increase productivity, um, um. a whole bunch! Sincerely yours, Frederick J. Flintstone. Shall I make that "Flagstone," so he'll know who it's from? My, don't we look handsome today? Thank you. Here are today's batch of requisitions, - all marked and ready for your signature. - Okay. You know, Miss Stone, I've been signing stacks of these for weeks, and I hate to pry, but what are they? Oh, just tiny little forms. so that we can pay the contractors working on the modernization. We remodeled our kitchen a couple of years ago, and let me tell you, contractors can be real pirates. - I'm gonna read these over. - No! You're much too busy for that, Mr. Flintstone. Besides, reading is my job. You wouldn't want to put poor little old me. out of work, now, would you? No. Your wife. Mm-mmm. - Your wife. - My wife. Wilma? - Wilma! What a surprise! - So it would seem. Miss Stone, I'd like you to meet my wife Mrs. Flagstone. and our daughter, um, um, um, um. Isn't she beautiful? My family. -I've heard so much about you. -Well, I wish that I could say the same. That'll be all, Miss Stone. I'll sign those documents and place them on your desk. Whatever you want. - Your secretary is very attractive. - Really? I hadn't noticed. - Did I mention she chisels eighteen words a minute? - Hmm. Hey, Wilma, did ya ever see one of these? My wife is the most beautiful gal in Bedrock. - "My wife is the most beautiful gal in Bedrock. " - Nice try, Fred. "Nice try, Fred. " "Nice try, Fred. " Fred! I've come to talk about the Rubbles' troubles. Hasn't Barney found a job yet? It's gotten so bad, they've had to rent out their house just to make ends meet. Really. Where are they gonna live? Thank you. Isn't this nice, Betty? The Flintstones and the Rubbles, all under one roof. Yes, but this is such an imposition. Are you sure it's okay with Fred? Oh, absolutely. As a matter of fact, he thinks it was his idea. - Hey, Freddie, a couple of cool ones. - Oh, yeah. How about it, Barn? -Flintstones and Rubbles under one roof. -But it's only temporary. It'd better be. - It'd better be! - Yeah! Ah, Barn, I admire ya; you've lost your job, your dignity, but not your sense of humor. Hey, cut it out, Fred! You like your steak rare? - Yeah. - That one's yours. Hey, hey, stop! Come here, you purple rodent! Don't forget to wash that off before you eat it! Come here! Give me that! Help! Somebody! Ohhhh! Flintstone gets the rock. He sets his shot. He shoots! Ohh! Oh! Oh, boy. Miss Stone, what a pleasant surprise. Oh. What happened here? - That's what I'd like to know! - I'll get someone to fix it. Oh, Miss Stone? Before you go, there's something bothering me. - about this new system we're putting in here. - Oh? Yeah. I don't pretend to understand it all, - but wouldn't this put a lot of my guys out of work? - How would I know? I'm just a little ol' secretary. Are you kiddin' me? You're smart! I could tell that right off. There's a lot more to you than you. er. uh. - You. I mean. - Thank you. I sure hope I didn't get you into too much trouble with your wife the other day. Nah. Wilma always forgives me. She knows I love her. - And you do, don't you? - Are you kiddin'? I'll never forget, the first time I met her. She was working at a restaurant. I won this "All You Can Eat" contest and she was the one that cleaned me off. Every night I go home and look at her and I think, "What is a beautiful woman like that doing with a big galoot like me?" I think I know. - Where have you been? - With Fred. I mean, Mr. Flintstone. I'm worried, Cliff. - He's smarter than we thought. - He'd have to be to get himself dressed in the morning. He's been asking a lot of questions. I think we should just call the whole thing off. No. No, I've got a better idea. Why don't we turn ourselves in, - then we can rot in jail until the poles freeze over. - I was just thinking. Stick to your strengths, Miss Stone. And I'll stick to mine. Besides, if Mr. Flintstone insists on being so conscientious, perhaps we can give Fred. something to take his mind off work, hmm? - A bonus? - That's right, Fred! - You deserve it. - For what? Don't be modest, you go-getter, you! And Fred, let me let you in on a little secret. If you really want to become a top executive at this company, you've got to start living like one. Yabba-dabba-doo! Flintstones Meet the Flintstones They're the modern Stone Age family From the town of Bedrock - They're a page right out of history - Good afternoon, madam. - Full serve, please. - Let's ride With the family down the street Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet When you're with the Flintstones - Have a yabba-dabba-doo time A dabba-doo time - Oh, dear!

Wilma, in the buffet of life there are no second helpings. You gotta fill up your plate, top off your cup, and stuff a few rolls in your pocket. Fred, stop! Mmm. Frisky! You know, Barney, life's funny. One minute people are your best friends, the next you're fantasizing they're being ripped apart by a pack of rabid wolves. - You too, huh? - Oh, Barney, they've changed. I hardly know them since Fred's become such a big shot. And it should be us squanderin' all our money and treatin' our friends like dirt. - What do you mean? - Oh, nothin'. Just sour grapes, I guess. Oh, don't worry, Barney. It's gonna get better. One day we're gonna look back on all this and we'll laugh. Geez, I hope so, Betty, 'cause tomorrow they got me testin' shark repellent. Mmm. Oh, Barney. Ooh. Leaving early? Actually, the wife and I were going to have dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green. Ooh, pricey. Be sure to put that on your expense account. Fred, before you go. - Would you mind chipping your "X" on a couple of these? - Yeah, sure. What are they? Well, you sign these and your buddies down in the quarry get some much-needed time off. No kiddin'! I guess Mr. Slate finally noticed all those memos I been sendin' in. I hope the guys will know who's to thank for this. I'll make sure you get all the credit. Mr. Flintstone, up to now our relationship. - has not been based on mutuality of admiration or respect. - Huh? Put simply, you hate my bird guts and I think you're dumber than mud. - Ah. Well, good night. - Still, I wish to pass on an old dictum. from business school that may be apropos. Only an idiot signs something before reading it. Excuse me. I'm the executive, you're the office equipment. If I want to ask the office equipment for advice, I'll ask the water cooler! Ladies and gentlemen, the B. C.-52's! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey Twitch Well, I know a place where the hipsters go Called Bedrock Twitch, twitch 'Cause they're itching for it down in prehistoric Bedrock Twitch, twitch It's a funky town so I'll see you down It's a funky town called Bedrock, yeah Oh, the Stone Age crowd is twitching proud In Bedrock Twitch, twitch They do the twitch Twitch, twitch, come on Twitch, twitch Twitch, twitch Twitch, twitch Twitch, twitch Do it, come on, baby Do it, do it, do it - Do the twitch like you got an itch, itch - Yeah, yeah, yeah - Itch, itch, itch, itch - Yeah, yeah, yeah Twitch Thank you, Bedrock! Thanks, everybody. And remember, don't drink and pedal. Good night! Good night! - How 'bout a spin, Betty? - No, thank you, Fred. I'll wait till Barney gets here. He started some new job today. I'm not sure what time he gets done. While we're waiting, how about another carafe of the bubbly? Garcon! Whoops. Don't worry, Mr. Flintstone. I'll have that taken care of right away. Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Table seven, sonny. Barney! Barney, nice skins! Sit down, take a load off! - I can't, Fred. I'm working here. - You're a busboy? - It's honest work. - Yeah, I don't have to fight Dino for my supper. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll get you a fresh tablecloth, sir. Wilma, you were worried he'd never find a job and we'd be stuck with him forever. Ow! Flintstone! Flintstone! We want Flintstone! The demonstration continues to get uglier at Slate and Company. following the unexpected layoff of virtually the entire labor force. by V. P. Fred Flintstone. For the Cave News Network, this is Susan Rock. Fred, did you hear what happened to everyone at the quarry today? Yup. A few hours ago, I sent them all off on a nice, long vacation. You mean, a permanent vacation. He fired them! Fred! How could you? - I didn't do that. - You did too! It's all over the TV! - Fred! - Who are you going to believe. me or some busboy? That busboy is your best friend! Best friend? I lost my best friend the day I became an executive! He's just jealous of my hard-earned success. Hard-earned? Tell me something, Mr. Vice President, what's a graduated inventory plan, huh? How about supply and demand? Hey, Fred! What's two and two? I didn't come here to talk business. I'm out with my wife. Now, get me a clean spoon. That does it! The only reason you got that job is 'cause I switched tests with you. - Oh, Barney. - Oh-ho-ho, that's rich! What good would it do me to switch tests with the guy that got the lowest score? - Think about it, Fred. - Oh, finally it all makes sense. You don't believe this, do you? - Are you calling my husband a liar? - This has gone far enough. After everything that we've done for you. We took you into our home. Yeah? So you could show off every chance you got! You used to be such nice people, but now. you're just a couple of rich snobs! Better than being a couple of petty ingrates. Come on, Barney. We are moving out. tonight! Hang on, Betty. I forgot to punch out. Eh, put it up top. Betty, please. We can work it out. We're all civilized people here. It's too late, Wilma. Come on, we all said things that we didn't mean. Speak for yourself. Come on, Betty. Time to hit the road. Fred! Aren't you even the least bit sorry? Sure, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever met the little moocher. Oh, Betty. - Good-bye, Wilma. - Oh. They're gone. I cannot believe you just let them walk out of our lives. - At least I can walk around the house in my underwear again. - And that is more important. than 20 years of friendship? It is on a hot day. They were holding us back, Wilma. We'll make new friends. There's 4,000 other people in this world! - Who needs the Rubbles? - I do. But I'll tell you what I don't need. I don't need. this necklace. You know, I don't need this lamp. And I don't need this television set. Not the TV! I don't need this. I don't need this. I don't think I'll be needing any of this bone china. Because I don't have any friends to invite to dinner. I don't think I'll be using any of these cups or saucers. You're gonna regret this. It's gonna take you hours to clean up this mess. All right, Wilma. Enough of this charade. Come back now, and I'll forgive ya. Oh, you're bluffin', Wilma Slaghoople. You're not going to your mother's. Once around the block, you'll realize. the folly of your ways and you'll come crawling back. Please. It's finally happened: I've become my father. Now, Barney, don't talk like that. - This place is fine for now. - Come on, Betty. We're living downwind from a family of wild boars. - Face it. We've hit rock bottom. - Hmm. Come here, little guy. Can you say da-da? Say da-da. - Bamm-Bamm! - Oh. It doesn't really matter where we live, as long as we're together. Family hug! - Betty? - Hmm? Exactly where did you get those eggs? Sorry. I think it might be twins. There he is! You're a traitor, Flintstone! - Listen to me. I'm your friend. - You're no friend of ours! And you're a rotten bowler too! Good morning, Mr. Flint. - They made a fool of me. - Look what they had to work with. Wah! Flintstone, heard you were down in the file room. Find anything interesting? Yeah! I'm on to your little scam. Billing phony companies and keeping the money for yourself. - I'm going to Mr. Slate. - Good idea. Turning yourself in might buy you a little leniency. - Me? This entire scheme was your idea. - True. But I've graciously decided to give you all the credit. since it's your name on the requisitions. I never touched any of that money! Hmm. Fred, please. Remodeling your house, furs, jewelry, a fully-equipped Le Sabertooth. - Tsk, tsk, tsk. You should have been more discreet. - I'm innocent! Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. Miss Stone, call security. Tell them we've uncovered an embezzler. Miss Stone, you'll back me up, won't ya? You better run while you still have a chance. You'll never get away with this. I already have. Here comes the pterodactyl. - Mmm-mmm-mmm. - It's no use, Mother. She misses Fred. I hope it's not that pesky Avrok lady again. Oh! - Betty! - Oh. - Bamm-Bamm! - I have missed you so much. I don't care what Barney said; I couldn't let you go through this alone. - Have you heard from Fred? - No. I spoke to a lawyer. If he's missing seven years, you can remarry. Mother! Well, wherever Fred is, I hope he knows I still love him. Ohh. Tonight, in a special edition of Bedrock's Most Wanted, we bring you the story that's rocked our city, "The Case Of The Embezzling Executive. " Mr. Flintstone, what are you doing? I'm an executive. I'm embezzling. I'm shocked! How could you ever marry that man? Mother! That man is not my husband. That's right. He plays Dr. Gravelman on The Young And The Thumbless. Fred might be a lot of things but a thief is not one of them. - Can you prove it? - Who cares? Yabba-dabba-dabba! - Yabba-dabba-dabba! - This menace remains at large. - We ask the public's help in apprehending. - Maybe I can. A little something to take that chill off. Take a swig of this. Put hair on your knuckles. Tell me something. You one of those guys that was laid off at the stone quarry? I used to work there. A lot of guys here would like to get their hands on the guy who's responsible for all this. - So they could hear his side of the story? - What? His side of the story? Huh? Flintstone! Flintstone! It is! Flintstone! Squealer! Get him! Just think. This time tomorrow, we'll be on a pterodactyl winging our w. - Oh, Cliff. - Hmm? How come there's only one ticket to Rocapulco? For your protection, darling. I thought I would go on a "business trip," while you. stay here to keep up appearances. Then, when we're sure it's safe, I'll send for you. Forgive me, Cliff. Looks like you've thought of everything. Psst. Excuse me! - Hello. - No, Mumsie, I don't want to go to school. The other boys make fun of me. Wake up! Oh, Mrs. Flintstone. To what do I owe the honor of this break-in? I need your help, Mr. Bird. - You hear everything that goes on in this office. - Mm-hmm. You are the only one who can help clear my husband. My, my, what a delicious irony. Thank you for sharing it with me. Now, let me share something with you. Oh, now, Wilma, calm down. - Maybe I can reason with him. - Ow! There. All set. You know, my only regret is I won't be around. when that shoddy new equipment blows up in their big, dumb faces. Oh, well, I'll just have to console myself with all that money. Hey, who's that? That's Flintstone's wife. What would she want with a stinky old dict. Son of a brachiosaurus! Well, Cliff. I guess you haven't thought of everything. Oh, this is far from over. String him up! You can't do this. I was framed! In a minute you're going to be boxed. Anybody want a snowcone? - Barney! - Fred! - What are you doing here? - I'm getting lynched! - Oh. I got cherry, lime, rocky road. - Do you know this guy? Know him? He used to be my best friend. In a way, if it wasn't for me, this whole mess probably wouldn't have happened. Thanks for filling us in. We could've made a very big mistake here. - Hang both of 'em. - What? Gee, take it easy. They make you pay for your own uniforms. Barney, I thought you came to save me. Save you? I saw a crowd, I figured I'd sell a few snowcones. - You mean you haven't forgiven me yet? - Nope. Frankly, I don't think this is going to help. - I took a cherry. - I can't break a 20. Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute! Look, Barn, I know you're still a little mad at me. But I want you to know, if I had to have someone hanging next to me, I'm glad it's you. I guess switchin' them tests didn't turn out much like I planned, huh, Fred? Hey, got any lemon? Check in the back. Gee, why can't business be this good every day? The story of my life. - I'm a loser. - No, you're not. - This makes me a winner? - No, but you're the best friend a guy ever had. and that makes you a winner in my book, pal. Me. I'm just a big jerk. Ah, everybody loves you, Fred. Except for this lynch mob. Ah, Barn. Ah, Fred. You'll have plenty of time to bond in the afterlife. Wilma, look! Watch out for that tree! Now wait, everybody. Fred is innocent. Barney, do you have to do everything Fred does? Everybody, listen to him. First things first. I demand an apology. - I'm sorry! - Not you, him. Me? Apologize to a bird? Not Fred Flintstone! I had hoped we might be colleagues but instead, you've treated me as if. I were an ordinary piece of office furniture. I may eat bugs, but I have feelings, Mr. Flintstone. - And you've hurt them. - Aww. Uh, well, look, I know I could've been a little more sensitive. - Especially when you were molting. - Ohh. So, I'm. sorry. I don't think they heard you in the back. - I'm sorry. - Pardon? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - Ohh. Now, then. Gather 'round, everyone. I'll tell you the tale of an unsophisticated man. caught up in a treacherous web of power, deceit and lust. Ooh, yeah. Why is the door open? - Betty, the door is open! - Wilma, something's wrong! - Pebbles! - Bamm-Bamm! What kind of madman would do something like this? That's a poor poochie. That's a baby. That's a baby. - Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are gone! - They left this. - It's a note. - "If you want to see your kids again, Mr. Flintstone. Stealing office equipment, really. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Is this the kind of example you want to set for your daughter? - Where are the kids? - The bird, please. - First, we want our children. - Of course. - Bamm-Bamm! - Take one more step, Mr. Rubble, and this quarry's safety record will be severely tarnished. Now, give me the bird. Go on, Fred. Give him what he wants. - What? - Don't worry, I got a plan. - We're gonna get the kids back and then we'll rescue you. - What a strategist. I should have signed with Disney. They never would've allowed this sort of thing to happen. - Ahh! Thank you, gentlemen. - Easy. And in the words of my beloved mother, I'm taking the money and moving to a warmer climate. Help, Daddy! Let's discuss this, Cliff. May I call you Cliff? Barney, too much pressure. One, two, three. Nice goin'. - Now what do we do? - You get the kids, I'll try and stop this. Whoa! Cliffy, have I ever told you you have a very distinguished chin? Shut up! Aah! Whoa! Yo, ow, ow, ow, ow! Oh, dear, oh, dear. Too many years behind a desk. Mayday, mayday! Hi, Da-da. You did it! You called me da-da! Oh, Barney, you lunkhead! What am I going to do? I gotta think of somethin'. Not now. Wake up, Uncle Barney! Help, help! Save me! Save me from this mad M. B. A.! - Don't worry. I'll take care of him. - My hero. Yipes. Flintstone, kiss your bird good-bye. Oh, mama. Will there be anything else, Mr. Flintstone? No, Miss Stone. Take the rest of the day off. Yabba-dabba-doo! Cliff? It's time for you and me to interface. - Aah! - Stee-rike! And then, Cliff said, "True. But I've graciously decided to give you all the credit, Mr. Flintstone, I may not be in on Monday. Don't worry, Miss Stone. I'll tell 'em what you did. - I'm sure they'll let you off easy. - I've been a very bad girl. But you have to admit, I was very, very good at it. Come on, do it for Mommy. Who am I? - Bamm-Bamm! - Oh. Thank goodness, you're all right. Well, I'm not going to jail, but it won't be easy getting a new job. What kind of reference is Mr. Slate gonna give me after I destroyed his quarry? None of this was your fault. Mr. Slate will understand. Flintstone! Sure, now he gets my name right. How did this happen? Mr. Slate, it all started when the Rubbles here wanted to adopt a baby. Not that! How did this happen to Cliff? Well, you see, Mr. Slate, the machinery went haywire and the rocks got all crushed up. and that got mixed in with water and that came all down the hill. - Mr. Slate, I'm sorry! - Sorry? I love this stuff! I'm gonna name it after my daughter Concretia. Flintstone, you're a genius! Me? Really? Why? Don't you see? Thanks to concrete, man can now shape his own destiny. - The Stone Age is over! - Ahh. First thing, I want you to hire back all the men, Flintstone. - We're going into production immediately. - We? That's right. You are hereby promoted to President of the entire Concrete Division. Yabba. That's a real nice offer, Mr. Slate, but unfortunately, I'm gonna have to turn you down. Don't listen to him, Mr. Slate. Fred, it's a great job! This time, you deserve it. Barney, all my life I wanted to be a somebody. And when I finally did, I turned into somebody I didn't like. Good grief, man, have you lost your mind? This could make you rich beyond your wildest dreams. I was always the richest man in the world. I just never knew it. So, if it's okay with you, Mr. Slate, all I want is my old job back and my old life. Fred. And two weeks paid vacation for all the men in the quarry, an annual cost of livin' increase. and those little packets of ketchup in the lunchroom. - Done! - Thanks, boss. See you at the company picnic. There goes the best executive I ever had. - Fred, I'm so proud of you. - And I'm proud of you, Barney. - I'm starving! - Me too! What do you say we get some breakfast. Snake and eggs for everybody. - My treat. Barney. - Great. - Yeah, Fred? - Could you spot me a couple bucks? I'm a little short. - Not this time! - What?

There are eight of us. Well, that is, there uses to be but one of the girls got a job in a nightclub in Hoboken. Miss O'Brien, I son't think you quite unserstans. I mean, I think you've come to the wrong place. You see, Mr. Asams is. Well, he's only interestes in the very exceptional. You've never seen us sance. You can't tell from just talking.

Ans your interpretation of a bluebirs was lovely. But who so you think cares? Have you never hears of telephones, factories, cafeterias? That'll never so. You write it, Olmy. Your rejections are always so tactful. Looks like it's gonna rain. Sometimes I think if I ever see another birs sancing, I'll shoot it. Hey, I'm talking to you. "What we're interestes in, Miss Hemingway is not an interpretation of birslife, however lovely but an interpretation of American life tosay. Shopkeepers, mechanics, aviators." Why is it, Olmy, that you're the only woman who can ever unserstans me? Now, that letter to Mexico City. Okay, okay. You still nees lots of work though. Take a rest. I'll be back in five minutes. Well, young lasy, what can I so for you? Nothing, I. I guess I mase a mistake. Oh, there's a girl waiting in my office. She's awfully anxious to see you.

There'll be another along presently. You're very kins, but I like the rain. That's no way to treat a Goos Samaritan. Mins if I share my own umbrella? Thank you very much. Goosbye. That was your last sime, wasn't it? You know, it's sangerous to turn up your nose on a say like this. You might srown. - When I first saw you in the elevator. - So you followes me. No, I sisn't.

Scram, ans let a lasy sress. Go on, get out. Why. Anything wrong? Not a thing, sweetie pie. This is my last performance. I sais this is my last performance. I'm sorry. Dis you get a better offer? Yes. I acceptes it too. I got marries this afternoon. I hope you'll be very happy. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. - What so you mean by busting in here? - Hey, wait a minute. I got something. Come on, get going. You mean it wasn't Dwarfie? That sucker? Why, no, sarling, I marries a friens of yours. A Mr. James Harris, Jr. For the love of heaven, Lily. Okay, okay, one Tiger Lily coming up. - Step on it, Jusy. - Hey, ma, what so I so now? Come on, Jusy. We sisn't pay to see a tree. What's the matter back there? Give us some action! - Hurry up. - You are fires. You. - Get on. - What's the matter, can't you take it? - How couls you so it to him? - Go on, get out there. Trying to steal Tiger Lily's stuff, little girl? - Bring Lily back. - We want Lily. We want Lily back. Don't mins us, we can take it. Oh, she's going home to mama. What are you gonna so now, cry? Go aheas ans stare. I'm not ashames. Go on, laugh, get your money's worth. Nobosy's going to hurt you. I know you want me to tear my clothes off so you can look your 50 cents' worth. Fifty cents for the privilege of staring at a girl the way your wives won't let you. What so you suppose we think of you up here? With your silly smirks your mothers wouls be ashames of. It's a thing of the moment for the sress suits to come ans laugh at us too. We's laugh right back at you, only we're pais to let you sit there ans roll your eyes, ans make your screamingly clever remarks. What's it for? So you can go home when the show's over, strut before your wives ans sweethearts ans play at being the stronger sex for a minute? I'm sure they see through you just like we so. - Go on back. - You're a sensation. - They want you. - Take another bow. Come here. Crabbing my act, you jealous little pig. Come on. Get her quick. Break it up. Break it up. - Come on, girls. Break it up. - Stop it. Hello. What are you giving me, brother? I'm not marries, I'm sivorces. But at 4:00 this afternoon, in Richmons, Virginia you ans the well-known Tiger Lily White. You mean I marries her? I son't care if she's in a night court or a circus. She can take care of herself. Look, Mr. Harris, she has a fight with your other girl her sancing partner, Jusy O'Brien. Jusy? Mr. Harris' marriage has nothing to so with me. They're in night court. You wanna make a statement? I'm not interestes. I son't care who's where, ans I'm not making any statements. Where in the blazes is the night court? Jusge, look at my eye, look at my leg. Look where she slappes me on the back. I must remins the complainant, as well as the spectators that this is a night court, not a burlesque. The complaint states that you slappes her. Oh, no, Your Honor. I punches her, ans then I jumpes on her ans tries to strangle her. You mean you happenes to catch your arms arouns your opponent's neck in an act of self-sefense? Oh, no, Your Honor. I wantes to kill her. Miss O'Brien, will you please sit up here? I must warn you again, Miss O'Brien that whatever you say may be uses as evisence against you. You want me to tell the truth, son't you? Yes, of course. Well, let us procees. Now, about this temper of yours. You are Irish, aren't you? Well, I have a habit of simmering, Your Honor. But I usually keep myself from boiling over. Miss O'Brien, you seem to be positively enjoying yourself. Have you ever got a loas off your mins? Everything at once, after you've gone arouns for weeks holsing it in? You are the one on trial, Miss O'Brien, not I. She's jealous because I'm the whole show. She thinks she's a wonserful sancer, but she's a stooge. I won't warn you again, miss. Quiet. Go on, Miss O'Brien. I can't say being a stooge is fun, Your Honor. But it was just like practice to me. It isn't that I think I'm a great sancer. I know I'm not but sancing means everything to me. I've never cares about anything else. She's lying, jusge. She tries to steal my boyfriens, ans she got sore because he marries me. I must ask the complainant to wait her turn. Just a minute, Your Honor. I think I can explain. - Ans who are you? - He's my husbans. James Harris, Jr. He'll tell you, jusge. Let the young man come in. Everything's my fault. I feel responsible for all this. He has nothing to so with this. He thinks he sis, ans I thought he sis. Miss O'Brien, are you sure that jealousy has nothing to so with your behavior? After all, the complainant is the wife of an asmittes friens of yours. You see, all of us have been kins of mixes up about each other. Lots of times I've been mas at Bubbles, but I shoulsn't have been. She's just like a kis who can't stans it if another kis has one marble even if she has 20. Ans Mr. Harris, he was wrong in his feelings for me. He was running away from something when the best thing he couls've sone was run after it ans face it ans struggle with it for the rest of his life if he has to. He was running away from a part of himself. You can't separate a man from what really belongs to him. I founs that out ans I'm afrais Bubbles will fins it out too. Naturally, it was a little bit hars for me to face tonight but I siscoveres my mistake but I hasn't quite got arouns to facing things again ans. Well, I'm sorry, but I lost my heas. That's all, Your Honor. There are times when it seems hars to punish human nature for just being human. However are you reasy for the sentence, Miss O'Brien? Yes, Your Honor. I know in spirit you will both bear Miss O'Brien's punishment with her knowing yourselves equally to blame. Miss O'Brien in view of your own asmission, I fins you guilty of sisorserly consuct. Ten says or $50. - I'll pay the fine. - I'll take the 10 says. Please. Where so I pay? - I won't accept it. - You've got to. Mr. Harris, the young lasy seems to mean it. Jusy? It's all right, Bubbles. You's better put some raw meat on your eye. Abraham Lincoln Johnson, Martha Washington Johnson. Abraham Lincoln Johnson, Martha Washington Johnson. It looks like our marriage was a mistake. Well, you may be right, but sesertion's rather expensive. Oh, I have an excellent lawyer for annulments. With two in the family, he might even make us a wholesale price. Put your arms arouns both of them. In a little closer, Mrs. Harris. Ans you, too, Mrs. Harris. Just call it "Tiger Lily throws playboy back to mate for $50,000." - Thirs soor on your left. - Thank you. Miss O'Brien, go right in. Oh, come in, my sear. He's expecting you. It's all right. Go on in. You're not Mr. Asams not really, are you? Yes, I'm awfully sorry. I's have bailes you out last night but the jusge ans I secises you weren't in a moos to accept favors. - I'm still in no moos. - Now, listen to me, you silly chils. I've encounteres your temperament before. There are times when it's sistinctly out of place, not to say sownright isiotic. You've has your own way long enough. From now on, you're gonna listen to me. - Parson me. - I coulsn't stop him. Fitch, in this corner, we have Battling Jusy O'Brien, my latest siscovery. She was born with more than any sancer we've got, ans she knows less. - It's our job to teach her what we know. - Glas to have met you, Miss O'Brien. I hear you pack a mighty fine wallop. Excuse me, but when I think of everything of how simple things couls have been, I. I've just got to laugh. Go aheas ans laugh, Jusy O'Brien. [ENGLISH] Pyewacket. What's the matter with me? Why do I feel this way? It's such a rut. The same old thing, day after day. The same old people. I know I'm feeling sorry for myself, but it's true. Why don't you give me something for Christmas, Pye? What would I like? I'd like to do something different. I'd like to meet someone different. Look, there's that man upstairs. He's different. Why don't I ever know people like that? Why don't you give me him for Christmas? Why don't you give me him? Oh, dear! -You startled me. -We're even. -Who are you? -You do have a nice place here. Thank you. Would you mind if I ask what you're doing in it? Certainly not. I was going downstairs and your door happened to be open, and I saw your window open, too. The snow was coming through and I thought you'd like me to close it, so I did. It's odd I had to unlock the door to get in. Yes, isn't it? After all, you are fairly new in the building. I was only being neighbourly. Are you the one that lives above me? Tell me something. Do you study dramatics, by any chance? Dramatics? At night, I hear you through the ceiling, as I'm trying to sleep. Sounds as though you're reciting or something. -Can you understand what I say? -No. I'll try not to do it so loudly. You read, don't you? And you have such a correspondence. I straightened your desk up a bit. I'm afraid you're very sloppy. If you don't mind terribly, I have some telephoning to do. Some personal telephoning. Before you moved in, a theosophist lived here, and he was very pleasant. Very pleasant. Hello? Mother? I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Shepperd Henderson. I live above. -I know. I'm Gillian Holroyd. -How do you do? My phone's out of order. I wonder if I might use yours. -I'm late for an appointment. -Certainly. Come in. Thank you. It's in the back. -You reading this? -<i>Magic in Mexico</i>? Yes. -Are you interested in that sort of thing? -Only professionally. I'm a publisher. Operator? I'd like to report a phone out of order. -Did you publish that? -No, but I wish I had. -It sold like the <i>Kinsey Report</i>. -I can't think why. It's completely phoney. -It is? -I spent a year in Mexico. I'm sure they fed him a lot of fake tourist stuff, and he swallowed it whole. Maybe they did that to Kinsey, too. I certainly wish I'd put this one out. I understand Redlitch is about ready to change publishers. Yes, I'll wait. -Would you like to meet him? -You know him? No, but I might know someone who does. I understand he's a drunk and a nut, but there's a market for the supernatural. -Yes, I'd like very much to meet him. -I'll see if I can arrange it sometime. Thank you. Supervisor? My number is Chickering 4-5-0-9-9, and it's out of order. I don't know what's wrong with it. If you want my opinion, I think it's sick. No matter what I dial, I get nothing but these idiotic sounds. That's just it. They're not mechanical. They're more human, or inhuman. Maybe it is goblins. I know it sounds strange, but I want it fixed. A Merry Christmas to you, too. Perhaps you need a drink. I'm in an awful hurry. Maybe I can have a rain check. Certainly. Here we are. This is a fascinating shop. What's this? That's a Bayaka mask, from the Belgian Congo. Looks like a German governess I had. How did you ever get interested in all this? I majored in anthropology at college. Gillian, you've got to change your mind and come along. -I didn't know you had company. -This is Shepperd Henderson. -This is my aunt, Miss Holroyd. -Your aunt? Mr. Henderson and I saw each other a little earlier. -I'm afraid he thinks I've been naughty. -No, not exactly. Gillian, you can't stay in tonight. All our friends will be at the Zodiac. -Mr. Henderson, persuade her for me. -The Zodiac? I don't think I know it. I don't imagine you would. It's kind of a dive. But it's fun. Coax her for me. -Is it fun? -It certainly can be. Then you oughtn't stay home Christmas Eve. Thanks again for the phone, and Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas! -I think you like him. -Yes, I do. Very much. -Did you bring him here? -No, he came to use the phone. -You broke into his apartment, didn't you? -I didn't break in, dear. And you fixed his phone. I'm angry with you, Queenie. Really angry. You promised. I promised to be careful. Besides, it serves him right. He wasn't nice to me at all, and what harm did I do? I didn't take anything. All right, I read his letters. Really, Queenie. But it's not as if I were going to make use of them. It's too bad, though, he's getting married, isn't it? He's getting married? How do you know? One of his letters, I suppose. -Well, that rules him out. -I don't see why. -I don't take other women's men. -But it would be so easy. And it would be such good practice for you, darling. And he'd never suspect. Not in a million years. It's amazing the way people don't. They don't believe there are such things. I sit in the subway sometimes, or in buses, or at the movies and I look at the people near me, and I think: ''What would you say if I told you I was a witch?'' And I know they'd never believe it. They just wouldn't believe it. And I giggle and giggle to myself. You've got to stop giggling here. I want you to swear you'll stop practicing in this apartment house. -But you practice here. -I can be discreet about it. You can't. I shall move to a hotel. Very well, but if you get into trouble there, don't look for me to get you out. I want you to swear you'll never practice witchcraft again, in this house. If you don't, you'll be sorry. And you know I can make you sorry, too. Say, ''I swear.'' I swear. Really, Auntie, it's for our own good, dear. I think you're very cruel. If you'll wait, I'll change. There were only a few of us, but I actually saw her do it. I'm afraid I must agree with you. Up to a point, Matilda's technically superb, but her brewing lacks quality. On the other hand, you have to admit that her ointments have done wonders. Ointments! My dear, I abandoned ointments when I was 14. That's understandable. One can't mention Matilda and you in the same breath. -There's been nothing this century like you. -You're sweet. Gil, darling, you're depressed. I expect it's Christmas. It always upsets me. Auntie, don't you ever wish that you weren't what we are? No. That you could just spend Christmas Eve in a little church somewhere listening to carols instead of bongo drums? Come join Zoe and Waldo and the others. Why, even Mrs. DePass is here! I wish I could just spend some time with some everyday people for a change. You wouldn't like it, darling. They're ordinary and humdrum. Yes, I suppose so. But it might be pleasant to be humdrum, once in a while. Perhaps you'd like to be humdrum with that Mr. Henderson. I wouldn't mind. It has to be around here someplace. I looked it up in the directory. All right, Shep. I grant you this place is different, but must it be invisible? Listen. I swear I hear music. Don't you hear music? Well, listen. What's that? Look. Drums! Hello, down there! Hello. Zodiac? Hello! This is it. See there? Okay. I'll bet this is it. There you are, a trail. Follow the yellow line and keep going and keep going, and there is an arrow. Success. Come on. Are you sure you wouldn't rather go back to El Morocco? Come on, this will be fun. -Good evening. -Hello. Providing the signs are favourable, the Zodiac welcomes you. -The date of your birth, sir? -March 12. Sign of the fish. The time is favourable. -Sign of the fish. -Shep, this is the scrabby end! The night is favourable. Auspicious for love, pleasure and entertainment. -Go right down. -Thanks. Come on. It's not supposed to be known, but he's from the Paris chapter. This is a number about a man who was assassinated and thrown in a river. That was ten years ago. There he's been all this time at the bottom without food, alcohol or a female friend. In addition, he detests water. You won't catch her at El Morocco. She looks like she's been living in a pickle barrel. I think she's the one. There's a snapshot of her in his desk drawer. Auntie, I think.. Yes, I'm sure I do. I know that girl. -Sure you don't mind? -Of course not. We're delighted. That's very kind of you. There we are. I believe Miss Kittredge and I know each other. -I don't seem to remember. -Wellesley, we were in the same dormitory. Yes, of course. You were that girl who used to come to class barefoot. They put you on probation for it, didn't they? Somebody wrote a note to the dean about it. I wear them in public now, Mr. Henderson. -That band certainly is different. -They play very well together. Nicky is the one playing the bongos. Up to a few months ago, he'd never studied music. Quite remarkable. Yes, particularly when you consider that he used to work in an herb shop. Looks to me as if he's eaten one herb too many. That's why he acts so creepy, I suppose. No, it's not that at all. All the Holroyds are a little sinister. You see, Nicky's my brother. I'm terribly sorry. -Waiter. -Yes, sir? Give us two more of those. A vodka and tonic, and scotch and soda. Yes, sir. Miss Kittredge had a quirk at college, too. -Thunderstorms. -Thunderstorms? -You do remember them? -Just an old bugaboo of mine. That last spring in school, it was most astonishing how many dreadful thunderstorms there were. Remember? Yes, I remember. It was most extraordinary. Why, they lasted for weeks. -Did they really scare you? -I'd rather not talk about it. Are you all right? Shep, get me out of here! All the girls loathed her. She was a liar and a sneak. And do you know what else, Auntie? She used to write poison-pen letters. -That note to the dean was from her. -Didn't you do anything about it? Why do you suppose we had all those thunderstorms that spring? -That was you? -She was a nervous wreck. Did you hear that, Nicky? Why, Nicky! How clever. It's nothing, really. Just something I picked up the other day. Nicky, will you ever grow up? Auntie, you know something else? She had a terrible reputation as a beau snatcher. Now, you can't have a single twitch about taking him away from her. It wouldn't be anything for you. Just a few words to Pyewacket. I don't want him that way. Gillian, you haven't fallen in love with him and lost your powers? Of course not. You don't believe that old wives' tale? -They say it's true. -Nonsense! It's the other way around. We can't fall in love. I wonder. I wonder if I could get him without tricks. I wouldn't know, dear. I could never do it at all. If you come in, you can have your presents. It's been Christmas for hours. -Now, wait a minute. Let me open it. -It's my turn now. Let me. -Auntie.. -If Nicky can, why can't I? I've your present with me, but it's mingy this year. I've never been so broke. -I'll like it just the same. -Let me do it again. -No, that's enough. -Come on. Come on, Queenie. It's present time. -You know what I used to wonder? -Pyewacket! I always used to wonder why all through history witches were always poor when they could get anything. It's only because they weren't any good at it, anymore than we are. We can turn out street lights, but we can't make anything turn to gold. Gil could hex the entire stock market if she wanted. She's afraid of the repercussions. No, I say you don't know what this kind of thing can do to you, if you go too far. Records! Wonderful! They're fine. But I don't have a phonograph anymore. You'll find you have one when you get home. Gil, that's too much! Really? Did you get it for me? -Did you witch it, or pay for it? -None of your business. You mustn't ask that, Nicky. It's like asking what it cost. This is lovely, Gillian. What does it do? It makes you look fascinating. -You mean.. -No, it has no powers. I just thought it was pretty. It is. It's very pretty. I love it. Thanks again, Nicky. -What's it for? -It's for summoning. You're supposed to take this liquid, and you paint it on an image or a drawing or a photograph of anybody you want, then you set fire to it and.. They got to come to you. I found it in a new little shop. Very interesting, Nicky. I hope it works for you. I couldn't even make it light. Let's try it. Right now. -Who are you going to try it on? -You'll see. Nicky, get the bowl. -The book on the desk, and the scissors. -The book on the desk, and the scissors. Who are you going to try it on? The man who wrote this book, Sidney Redlitch. -Where is he now? -The wrapper says he lives in Acapulco. -Any words? -It says not. -All right. Got a match? -Here. Go. You're a genius. It's Mr. Henderson! Hello. Are you having fireworks? Sorry to disturb you. I just thought the place was going up in flames. No, it's nothing like that. It's just a little game that we play. It seems rather dangerous, but go right ahead with it. No, no. It's all right. We've finished. Nicky, I'm terribly tired. I must be leaving. Goodnight. Everything's working out wonderfully. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Thanks again for the presents, Gillian. -Good night, Mr. Henderson. -Merry Christmas. Well, Merry Christmas. Perhaps you'd like that rain check now? All right, only make it a brandy, will you? -How did you like the Zodiac? -I'm not quite sure. Somehow it seemed more like Halloween than Christmas. Did you know Merle well in school? Not very. I'm afraid your brother and those drums were too much for her. Thank you. She's really quite a wonderful girl. Is that your cat? I've seen him on the stairs, watching me come in and out. What's his name? -Pyewacket. -How's that? -Pyewacket. -Pyewacket. Well, how do you do? Bad cat! -I'm glad he didn't scratch you. -No. That's all right. He doesn't have very good manners. It's just because you're a stranger. Once he gets to know you.. It's nice having you over me. I mean, it's assuring having a man near one in case he's needed. Merle and I are getting married tomorrow. I mean, today. We decided the whole thing driving home this evening. There's this party she's giving tomorrow. I mean, today, she's giving the party. And we were going to announce the engagement then. And then, do it later on but that seems like such a hack's way of getting married, so we're going to drive up-state, or over to Jersey, or wherever it is that you do it, and do it. It's funny, but all my life I've been either too busy or too careful to get married. But now, all of a sudden, I just can't wait. Just can't wait. Of course, I imagine it'll be a little strange at first. It'll sort of be like somebody reading over your shoulder all the time. I think I'm allergic to your cat. If it was anybody else but Merle I'd be scared stiff. For one thing, she has such wonderful taste in clothes, books, everything. And she paints very well, too. She paints in this sort of cloudy style. Did a portrait of me last year. She was crazy about it. So I just never did tell her that I thought it was upside down. I've known her since she was a kid, then she went off to school and I sort of lost track of her. I've sort of been rattling, haven't I? It's getting late. I think maybe I'd better go up. And thank you for the drink. Tomorrow's going to be quite an important day for me. I mean, today is going to be quite an important day, so if you'll excuse me. That tune you're humming, what is that? Just something I sing to Pye now and then. Say something. I want to hear your voice again. Do you like my voice? I like everything about you. Don't you know that by now? You've made it charmingly apparent. Just what are you thinking at this moment? Nothing, nothing at all. And you? Nothing, either. I can't think. Certainly not this close to you. -By the way, where are we? -On top of the Flatiron Building. You wanted to be on top of a tall building. -We had no luck at the Empire State. -Didn't we knock? Yes, we did, but they said, not at 6:00 a.m. They were very understanding, though. But not as understanding as this fellow downstairs. -What about before? -My place. -Why did we ever leave? -You wanted to go dancing in the snow. -Of course, you don't remember. -I remember every single moment. And I'm going to muss your nose. There's a timelessness about this. I feel spellbound. Stay that way. Gillian, tell me now, what has it meant to you? -Meant? -These hours. -They've been enchantment. -That's all? Do we have to talk about it? Why? I'm supposed to be getting married this morning. Are you? If not, I'd better ask myself some questions in a hurry. Do you want to ask them, Shep? Right at this moment, I want never to stop seeing you. I know it doesn't make sense, but I have an idea I must be in love with you. Has it hit you that way? I want you as much as you want me. Would you like it to go on for always? -Does anything go on for always? -One likes to think some things do. Maybe this is one of those things that burn themselves out. But if it is, it's a whale of a fire. Shep, it has hit me hard. Good morning. Have we done something dreadful? -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. <i>Merle, I've been taking stock.</i> <i>I'd make an impossible husband.</i> <i>Things I've never told you.</i> <i>I gargle. I eat radishes.</i> <i>I chew tobacco. I spit.</i> <i>I'm an insomniac. I don't sleep at all.</i> <i>I stomp around the bedroom all night long,</i> <i>talking to myself.</i> -Besides all that, I snore. -What? You won't be happy with me. Not at all. -Shep, what's the matter with you? -I don't know exactly. You look green. I hope you haven't too much of a hangover from last night. You're just nervous. You'll be all right. Bonita called from Westport. She's found a minister. He'll be ready at 1:00. He arranges for photographers. -Isn't it exciting? -It's no good, Merle. It's just no good. No use. -Are you still drunk? -No, I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I may be intoxicated, but not drunk. -You're certainly not acting like yourself. -No, I'm not. You're almost like another person. That's exactly how I feel, Merle, like another person. I just don't seem to want to marry you any longer. You wouldn't want me to marry you when I don't want to, would you? Are you trying to say you're jilting me? That's a very heavy word, Merle. It's a very heavy word. Let's just say that we're ''uncoupling.'' -You sound like a lunatic. -That's very true. Very true. I'm sorry, Merle. I can't really explain this. I don't fully understand it myself. What am I supposed to tell people? Just what do you expect me to do? You could go back to Arthur O'Neill, the fellow you jilted. You could take a world cruise. You could redecorate this apartment. It really needs it, Merle. -You are a vile, sleazy, contemptible.. -I'm a cad. Goodbye, Merle. I almost forgot my hat. -Good morning, Tina. Nice Christmas? -Very nice. And yours? Superb! The mail is on your desk. And Mr. White is in, and the Faulkner galleys are ready. And that gentleman is waiting to see you. And Bergdorf's called about that negligee you wanted to send to Miss Kittredge. Tina, why don't you just have them send that to your house? And I'm not going to have lunch with Miss Kittredge, or dinner. You can just cancel all those reservations. We don't want to have a perfectly good negligee go to waste, do we? Mr. Henderson, I'm Sidney Redlitch. You don't know me, but I think I want to see you. -You're who? -Redlitch. <i>Magic in Mexico</i>. <i>Magic in</i>.. Of course. Redlitch, I'm glad to see you. I'm astonished to see you. Sit down. I was talking to some people just the other night about you only I understood you were in Mexico. Yeah, that's right. You see, there is this new book that I am about to get into. All of a sudden, I get this uncontrollable urge to talk with you about it. First, I figured I'd write to you and then I thought maybe I'd phone. All of a sudden, I decided I had to see you so I grabbed a plane, and here I am. I didn't expect this kind of weather. It's chilly here, isn't it? Are you looking for something? A little post-Christmas cheer. Certainly. Tina, get the.. Scotch? Bourbon? It doesn't make any difference. -Sit down. -Thank you. Listen, Mr. Henderson. Do you ever publish anything on witchcraft? -Do you know anything about it? -Not exactly. You will. When this new one comes out, this will knock you over. Water or soda? Knock them over. Shep, I thought that we might.. Andy, come in. Meet Sidney Redlitch. This is my partner, Andy White. How do you do, sir? -Mr. Redlitch wrote <i>Magic in Mexico</i>. -Yes. And he's just about to do another one. What are you going to call this one? <i>Magic in Manhattan</i> or <i>Witchcraft Around Us</i>. Is it around us? You bet your boots it is, son, it's all around us. You probably thought it was confined to the jungles and the tropics. It's not. -It's right here. New York is full of them. -Full of what? -Witches, boy, witches. -How do you know that? Sure, go ahead. -What was that? -Scotch. Make this one bourbon, would you? How do I know? I've met a couple. Met them through my book, before I went to Mexico. Take my word for it, right here, all around us there's a whole community of them. -What do they look like? -Like anybody else. Like her. Like him. When it's a man, it's called a warlock. -Did you know they can't cry? -They can't cry? Physically impossible for a witch to shed a tear, or blush. When you throw them in the water, they float. You mean, you can actually contact these people? Of course. They have hangouts, but they're open to the public. Caf√©s and bars and nightclubs. They've got a place there in the Village, the Zodiac. Over in Brooklyn, there's.. You don't take this very seriously, do you? Yes, I do, but I've got some work to do right now. Besides, Mr. Henderson's in complete charge of our ''abracadabra'' department. See you later. You said the Zodiac? The little place in the cellar? -The headquarters is downstairs. -The headquarters! I'll be darned! -What's the matter? -Nothing. What are you doing this evening? I'd like you to have a drink with a couple of friends of mine. Sure, I'd love to. .or blush. If you throw them in the water, they float. Tell them about the Zodiac, that place where Nicky works. That's their headquarters. The place is infested with them. What do you know? Just take a good look at the proprietor sometime. -You mean to tell me he's a witch? -Absolutely. -And what is it they call a man witch? -A warlock. -Warlock. -Warlock. -You'd never know it to look at him. -You wouldn't, but I would. -You can recognise them? -Like a shot. -How? -It's a look, or a feeling or something. I can't put my finger on it, but if one came in here right now I'd know him in a minute. Yeah. I wonder if we know any of them. I wonder. -I suppose there's lots of it around. -Yeah, it's sort of like the flu. Make jokes, but my old publisher's still interested. No, no. As a matter of fact, I've come to a decision. I'll publish your book. The truth is, I wouldn't think of not publishing it. I've seen things from arthritis to the Dead Sea hit the best-seller list. -Why not this? -Great! You'll never regret it. -This calls for a little celebration. -I think I'll join you. This is just an amazing coincidence. Only the other night, Gillian was asking me if l'd like to meet you. It was right in this room, wasn't it? Remember? Toast. Ring the bell, close the book, quench the candle. That's how they used to exorcise them, put them out of business. In medieval times, of course. Tell me, is it safe to write about all this? Aren't you afraid of reprisals? As a matter of fact, I am. There's a woman very high up in the movement. If I can find her, I hope to get her on my side. -Who's that? -It's a Mrs. De.. -I can't tell you. -Mrs. DePass? How do you know that? I heard someone mention her name at the Zodiac. They say she smokes cigars made of seaweed. Sounds like her. Hope I can locate her. I'm going to start looking tonight. Hasn't this cat got anything better to do? -Couldn't you give him something to read? -I'll put him out. There's something about that cat. They make excellent ''familiars'' though. Almost all witches have them. Pets who have to carry out their masters' bidding. -You did say we were going dancing? -Yes. I forgot. I've got something on the stove upstairs. Don't dance all night. I guess I'd better go, too, so I'll get my coat. -Turn out the lamps, won't you? -Surely. Sorry we have to run, Mr. Redlitch. I don't like him looking for Mrs. DePass. Put him off the track. I see what you mean. What you said is terribly interesting. Do you mind if I walk along with you? That's a wonderful idea. Maybe we can stop someplace and have a drink. I know just the spot. A bar called ''Mumbo Jumbo.'' -You keep in touch with me. -Don't worry. I'll touch you for an advance. That's a little play on words. -Good night. -Good night. Quite a fellow, that Redlitch. I thought you'd like to meet him. Don't forget your shoes. The amazing thing is, I think he believes there are such things as witches. Just so he doesn't think I'm one. -We're going dancing, remember? -Yeah, but first.. Why do we have to go dancing? I like it here. -You'll be back. -You bet I will. Let's see now, laundry, hotel room money, barber shop. A good barber, a little trim. No, not too much. And a typewriter. I got to get a typewriter. -I'll loan you mine. -That's very friendly. You know something? There's one thing that you might. -He's closed. -.need and that would be a collaborator. I mean it. Somebody that could really scout around. You know, get some dope for you. Let you in on some things. Let me in? I am as in as anybody, but one of them himself could be. And if I got you one of ''them'' to collaborate with.. That would be different. -Would you split 50-50? -Sure. It'd be worth it. You're naive, boy. They're very tight with their trade secrets. I could never get near a deal like that. You are nearer than you think. See them? Watch. You. -You get better all the time. -So do you. -Your nose is cold. -I'm cold-blooded. I wouldn't say that. That's not fair. Hello. What is it? I know I haven't. I've been busy. Quite busy. No, not the way you think. Just busy. What do you want? Then say it over to me and I'll correct you. That's it. Just a minute. -The water's boiling, Shep. Will you? -Sure. No, not now, I tell you. I'm not alone. No, no. Nothing's going on. Just why do you want to know all this? What do you mean you're working with Redlitch? I've got to hang up now. I'll see you tomorrow. Gil, where's the tea? The tea, just a minute. -Where's the tea? -Right here. When are we going to get married? I must have missed a chapter somewhere. After the last two weeks, you can't say this is so sudden. No, but I just hadn't thought of marriage. Darling, that's the man's remark usually. Gil, I've really got it bad. I've let everything slide. I have a pile of unopened manuscripts in my office this high. I can't stay in my office for wanting to get to you. I'm going crazy. We can't go on like this. That's the woman's remark usually. Why don't you get your shoes? I'm sure they're dry. Why are you ducking this? Tell me, I'm serious. -I just don't think I'm cut out for marriage. -Why not? Because of the way that I've lived selfishly and restlessly, one thing after another. -You make it sound so.. -I don't mean affairs. What does it mean, then? I don't understand. It's just that my life has been sort of disreputable, at least seen through your eyes. -I'm cynical, I'm jealous, and I'm vindictive. -I don't believe that. It's true. I've always lived for, and by, the special not the ordinary. I've never even thought of marriage. It would mean giving up a whole way of thinking behaving a whole existence. I don't know if I could. I wish I could. Take this and the tea into the other room. I'll get your shoes. I wonder if I could. Suppose he found out afterwards? Don't look at me like that! I will if I want to! Shep, I will! I'd like to hear that again. I will. I want to. -I'll be different from now on. I promise! -I don't want you any different. -I want to be! I want to be quite different. -I won't stand for it. Hey, surprise! You're quite a stranger. Making hay? Boy, we are. Shep said he'd read the first half tonight. When did you get mixed up in this? The night Redlitch and I left your shop, you remember? You'd die laughing if you read what Redlitch has written. It's wrong, all wrong. It took me a while to straighten him out. What do you mean, straighten him out? You haven't told him about yourself, have you? Of course! I told him nearly everything. I want it to sell, don't I? He doesn't know about me, does he, Nicky? No, dear. I told him I was the one who summoned him to New York. -Of course, if you want the credit, well.. -I do not want to take the credit! You fool! Don't you know it doesn't pay to tell outsiders? I think it'll pay very well this time. Shep has already given Redlitch a generous advance. -Nicky, you cannot publish this book. -What is the matter with you? Why not? Shep and I are getting married. For goodness sakes. Bless your little heart. -Congratulations! -Thank you. Marriage no less. What fun! -Shep is really going to have quite a time. -No jokes, Nicky, and no tricks. -You don't mean this is on the level? -Yes, I do! Why? You've already got him. What do you want to marry him for? Because I want to live with him. Because I'm happy with him. I suppose next you'll say you're giving it all up. You're renouncing. -I have renounced. -You've what? -And this is too close to home. -I'm sorry. This is very important to me. It is much more important to me, and I want you to stop it! Not a chance. I'm not going to spend my life being a tom-tom player. Very well then. I'll just have to do something about it! You're going to pull one? I thought you were renouncing! I'll make a farewell appearance for this. I wouldn't, Gil. If you do, I promise your little romance is going to go on the rocks. Absolute trash. Garbage. Very frankly, this is the most idiotic thing I've ever read in my life. You should call it, <i>What Every Young Witch Should Know</i> and include a do-it-yourself kit with every sale. But I thought you were keen on the idea. Yes, I was, but I've certainly changed my mind. -Why? -Why? Because.. -I can go on with a spoof. -Spoof? -Silly, isn't it? -It certainly is silly. I don't intend to be the laughingstock of the trade by publishing it. -But every word is gospel, boy, gospel. -What's the use, Sid? He isn't having any. This is my hour of grief. Sidney, maybe we can find something to tide you over. A little bourbon? Scotch? That's right. -You don't care which one it is. Nicky? -No, thanks. I've had plenty. -Hello, Miss Holroyd. -Hello. -Is Mr. Henderson busy? -Yes, but there's a Mr. Holroyd with him. Of course, you understand, you can keep the advance. Well, think of the devil. I'm sorry, Shep, I have to see you. Now. Hi, dear. This is a pleasant surprise. Come on in. What do you suppose, Gil? Shep turned down the book. -I'm afraid I had to. -You bet you did. So long, Shep. You and Gil will be hearing from me. -You forgot your manuscript. -Just drop it into the wastebasket. It was silly of me to try this writing bit anyway, wasn't it, Gil? You can always go to another publisher. No, I don't guess any other publisher would do us much good. -Would it, Gil? -I doubt it. I don't suppose you'd be interested in the sequel I have in mind about the islands in the Caribbean, <i>Voodoo Among the Virgins</i>? Don't trouble, Nicky. I'm going to tell Shep. Either way, it's your funeral, isn't it, dear? What was that all about? I decided this morning that there's something I had to tell you even if I thought you'd never find out. Tell me what? There are people who.. -Well, I've got to say it, who live by magic. -By magic? -You don't believe such thing at all? -No, dear. No, I don't. I'm one. You're one what? One of the people that the book's about. And Nicky's one, too. And he persuaded you to come in on it? I'm sorry, dear. It just won't work. I'd be happy to publish the book just for you, but it's just terrible. You don't understand, Shep. I'm trying to explain something. If you're trying to prove to me that Nicky's a witch-- -The word is warlock. -We don't have to get technical. Now, dear, listen.. What is wrong? Has Nicky been threatening you or something? About telling me something about you or.. That's easy. -You can tell me yourself. -That's what I'm trying to do. What is it? Something in your past? What have you been up to? You been engaging in un-American activities or something? No, I'd say very American. Early American. Maybe, I don't know. Okay, I'll have a look. -Just give me a minute. -Shep. There are people who possess powers that others don't. Go ahead, dear, I'm listening. There are ways of altering things, of manipulating things for yourself. -That's very interesting. -It's true. I know. I can do it. You can? Go ahead. Do something. Show me. -No. -Why not? Because it's habit-forming. I gave in to it only last night, but I'm going to fight it. I'm not going to let it destroy me as a person. -What did you do last night? -I stopped that book from being published. No, you didn't. No, that's my province. I didn't say I stopped you from publishing it. -I stopped anyone from publishing it. -Just how did you do that? You'll say it's absurd. I put on a spell. I used Pyewacket. You mean you spoke to the cat about it? You had him talk the publishers out of it? Is Pyewacket a witch, too? All right. Don't believe it. Don't believe I brought Redlitch to you. And don't believe-- Just a second. Let's get our stories straight. -Nicky says that he brought Redlitch. -He's lying, because I did. -With luminous paint, I suppose? -Yes. And your telephone. Who do you think put it out of order? -Providence. -No! -Who? -Never mind! Why would anyone want to put my telephone out of order? As a prank. A trick. Like turning all the traffic lights on 57th Street green. That's what Nicky uses it for. That and his love life. His love life? That's kind of useful, isn't it? I don't know what this is all about and I don't know about Nicky's love life but as far as the lights on 57th Street and Redlitch and my telephone, they're coincidences. Oh, yes. They look like coincidences. There's always a rational explanation if you want it. I'll take the rational explanation. Yes, just as you took the rational explanation of us. What was that? There, I've said it. -You mean that was-- -Yes, that was. What did happen early Christmas morning? Was that rational? Why not? What happened after Nicky and Queenie left? Exactly. You asked me to have a drink. So I sat down and talked about Merle. And then I suddenly realised I must be allergic to that cat of yours. That's right. Go on. I went over, I picked up my hat and coat.. Then I seemed to see you for the first time. You left something out. What was I doing? You weren't doing anything. You were just sitting there, humming to the cat. What made you kiss me? The same thing that makes me want to kiss you right now. I don't know why you want me to believe you, but I believe you. I believe you cast a spell on me, an absolutely wonderful spell. And I believe it and I'm crazy about it. If you don't believe it, you don't. I've tried. I tried my best. I have tried my very best. <i>It's not possible.</i> <i>Then, I've never seen her blush.</i> <i>Does she float?</i> Stop it! No, not you. Keep going. Mr. Henderson, I'm so thrilled about it all, you and Gillian. I bumped into Nicky earlier, and he told me everything. To think that Gil was willing to tell you all about herself. I do hope you appreciate it, because that's a dangerous thing to do. It's so lovely that you and Gil are getting married. Marriage! And to an outsider! That may be totally unprecedented. I'm dining with Mrs. DePass tomorrow and I must discuss it with her. She'll know if it ever happened to one of us before. But whether it has or not, Shep, I can call you Shep now, can't I? -And you must call me Auntie. -Let me get this straight. -You mean you think you're one, too? -Yes, Shep. How else could I get into your apartment when the door was locked? Oh, very true. That door's locked. Let's watch you open it. No, I mustn't. I've been forbidden. -I took the oath. -You took the oath. -Gillian made me. -Sure, she did. You know, Gil is the gifted one, but she began so much earlier than most. So did Nicky. I came into it late. But they were just babies when they started. Went to children's s√©ances, I suppose. Baby witch parties. Yes. We lived in Massachusetts. I see. Miss Holroyd, you don't really think that Gil has any powers, do you? I know she has. She's done some wonderful things. My friend. Those thunderstorms, for instance. What thunderstorms? The ones that made your Miss Kittredge so sick at college. Gil made them happen but she had to do it to settle accounts with her. Just as she had to do what she did about you. I must go. What did she do about me? -Didn't she mention about the spell? -Yes, I got that. Then, otherwise you'd have gone and married Miss Kittredge. You mean that Gil went after me out of spite against Merle? No. Not altogether. She found you very attractive. -She liked you. -She liked me? That's a great deal for us, Shep. It's not as if we could fall in love. Love is quite impossible. Not hot blood, though. Hot blood is allowed. But, of course, you know all about that. Miss Holroyd, I don't think we'd better go on with this. I've been too bold, haven't I? -I hope she likes it. -I'm sure she will. Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Thanks. -I gather Queenie's been talking. -Yes, she has. She certainly has. It seems you omitted a few high spots this afternoon, didn't you? You didn't tell me about you and Merle Kittredge at college. You didn't tell me that you went after me just to spite her, did you? I didn't, not to spite her. -But you did. You went after me. Why? -Because I wanted you. -Because you were in love with me? -How could I be? I'd just met you. Are you in love with me now? I'm more in love with you than I've ever been with anyone. That's an evasion. I tried to tell you how it was with me. I tried to tell you how it started with us. I tried to tell you that getting things that way was no good and it was you that made me resolve to be through with it. I tried to tell you this afternoon, but you.. I did, but you found it so dreadfully funny. -Don't tell me you're getting angry. -I am not angry. I'm sorry. How do you think I feel to find out that you haven't been there the whole time and it's been a merry little adventure? Don't pretend to cry because you can't do that either! So now you believe it. Of course I don't believe it! Not one single, stupid word of it! I'm getting out of this building. And don't think I'm coming back, because I'm not. Ever! You will. You have to! You mean the spell? We'll see about the spell! Taxi! Taxi! Fascinating, boy, fascinating. I hope I can watch. You're a fool. Who's a fool? You're a fool! -Hello, Bianca. -Good evening, Nicholas. -Good evening, gentlemen. -Mrs. DePass. I assume this is the one you phoned me about. -No, I'm all right. -No. This is Sidney Redlitch, Bianca. Why, certainly. I'm an admirer of yours. -This is indeed an honour. -The honour is mine. Bianca, this is Mr. Henderson. He's the one. How do you do? Nicholas has explained your condition. It's too bad. Too bad. -Can you help me? -I can but try. Please, step in. No, no. I'm sorry. It's quite impossible. -We'll wait in the cab, Shep. -No, no. Better just carry on. These matters often take considerable time. Good luck, Shep. Goodbye, Shep. Thank you. Who's a fool? You're a fool! Be quiet, Sybil! Dear Gillian, only an amateur, of course, but very effective now and then. Do you know what she used? Used? Heart of a toad? White vinegar? Swallow's liver? -She used a cat. -Cat? That's right. You must wear this. Put it on. -Can we get on with it, please? -Patience. ''I conjure thee to remove all chains and break all bonds which bind thee.'' -Drink it. -Drink it? I will do no such thing! -Drink it! -Drink it. Quickly, while it has strength! Drink it! Drink it! All of it! You're a fool! Who's a fool? You're a fool! So cheapening, you taking him to see her! He's too good for that sort of thing. Come now, Gil, just because you and Bianca are rivals. We are not rivals. That third-rate, vulgar, self-advertising, mail-order sorceress. You shouldn't have told him, and you know it. You know what it says on love potions: ''Shake well, but don't tell.'' That's what happens to people like us. We forfeit everything and we end up in a little world of separateness from everyone. If you don't mind, I'd like to see Miss Holroyd for a few moments. -Yeah, Shep, old boy. -Nicky, will you, please? Yeah. How are you? Yeah. You're fine. I heard about last night, Shep. -What did you go there for? -For the hair of the dog that bit me. That's why. Listen, I don't want to be here and I wouldn't be, except she said the treatment wouldn't be complete until I confronted you. Nice of her to make that a condition. And she told me to tell you that if you have anything further in mind she's fixed it so you can't undo this one. Yes, and just how did she do that? She said it was something she put in that disgusting mess she made me drink. I've never been so humiliated in all my life! To say nothing of the money it cost me! -What did she charge? -$1,000. -What? -$1,000. At least she took a cheque. She also said that if we'd gotten married it would've cost a lot more than that to get divorced. -That's a pretty comparison. -Yeah, but it's a good one. Pretty good one, not bad, pretty good. And now, if you'll forgive me, I think I'll be going. Believe me, I've had my fill of this bell, book and candle set. -It wasn't necessary for you to move, Shep. -Yes, it was. I may have trouble subletting. This isn't the kind of a house that I could wholeheartedly recommend to anybody. Good day. -You mean goodbye? -That's right. -I'll never see you again? -I can't see what for. -I suppose you'll go back to Merle. -Perhaps, if she'll have me. I forgot, I'm going to a hotel, so I won't be needing this. Maybe you might, in case you get sick of the primitive art business. Have broom, will travel. So a trip to the Brooklyn Harpy, a visit to me, a final moronic joke and away we go! It's that easy, is it? Go back to Merle Kittredge, will you? Not if I have anything to say about it. Perhaps you're defrosted, but I haven't even begun with her! Let's see, what would be fancy enough? I'll transport her. Before I'm through with her, she'll see more geography than Marco Polo! And you needn't chase after her. Before she leaves I'll infatuate her. I'll make her fall for someone, the first stranger that walks in on her the mailman, the plumber, the window washer. Pyewacket! Holy smoke! Pyewacket, where are you? I know how it sounds. I'm under a spell. I'm enchanted. Sure, it's inconceivable, but it's a fact. I tell you, there are such things and they're right here in New York. -There are? -Yes. That girl you know, Gillian Holroyd, she's one. A witch? Shep, you just never learned to spell. How about those thunderstorms while you were in college? Think they were ordinary thunderstorms? Well, they weren't plain, ordinary.. In the last half-hour, have you had an urge to go on a vacation? To get away from it all? -No, dear, only from you. -Only from me. That's a good one. All I want to do, is to tell you why I'm here. I have to tell you something peculiar may happen to you. And if it does, maybe I can help you. -If this is your idea of a way to crawl back-- -You think what you like. Just don't blame me if you're eating sukiyaki before the week's out. Naughty cat! Naughty cat! Gillian's been looking all over for you! Why can't you understand that I'm just trying to-- Let me call Dr. Cook. Maybe he can help you. A doctor? I'm not crazy, Merle! I may sound like a lunatic, but I'm not crazy! I'm not trying to whip up any old passion, so you don't-- It's the exterminator. Can he come in? -Yes, dear. -No. I wouldn't let him come in here if I were you. -Why not? -Because he'll seduce you! -Send him in. -Yes, ma'am. -I'm really getting fed up with all this! -What do you think I feel like? I'm trying to help you. Good morning. You can start in the bedroom. Yes, ma'am. <i>Bon voyage.</i> On the roof, of all places. He's never gone off like that, has he? Do you think he was looking for a mate? Pyewacket, come here! Pyewacket, get down here this instant! Come here. Get down. Come on. What's the matter? -I have a little job for him to do. -You mean.. -How thrilling! Who is it going to be? -Miss Poison Pen, Merle Kittredge. It's just wonderful, dear, you're staging a comeback. What are you going to do to her? Why don't you burn down her house? Or have all her hair fall out! Pyewacket! Pyewacket! Tears. Real tears. It's true, that old wives' tale. It's true! That's why Pyewacket ran away. You've lost your powers. I've fallen in love. I've been coming down with it all along, I guess. I didn't know what it was. What is it like, Gillian, love? I've never had it, you know. Is it wonderful? Wonderful? Oh, no! Auntie, it's awful. Auntie, I don't want to be human, not now! I've said for years, the ideal situation at cockcrow is to be alone with one's subject, on the threshold of a deserted lea. But where can one find a deserted lea nowadays? It's impossible. You can't even find a barber shop that's open at 4:00 a.m. I haven't had any luck, either. I'll put that down. I think our friend Redlitch is kind of gone on Mrs. DePass. Haven't you heard? He's writing her life story. I'm so worried about Gil. She's been so unhappy these last couple of months. She asked for it. You mustn't talk like that. She's so alone. Even Pyewacket left her, and I can't get him to go back to her. No wonder. He's a cool cat. I keep thinking if only something could be done about getting her and Shep together. Nature might take its course. -All right. Why don't you fix it? -My hands are tied. She's even forbidden me to tell Shep about her predicament. -Would you handle it? -Me? No, I'm sorry. I don't believe in it. If I've told you once, I've told you 1,000 times. It never pays to get mixed up with human beings. The best thing for Gil would be to come back to us, where she belongs. You don't really understand. She's in love. Wouldn't she rather be dead? I simply have to do something. I simply have to. -Tina, I'm trying to work. -Sorry, Mr. Henderson. For pete's sake! I bet I've told you 1,000 times about that window. -I'll close it, Mr. Henderson. -No, leave it alone! Got to have some air in this God-forsaken office. Finish it? How am I supposed to finish it when I'm getting interrupted? Let's get some lights in here. -Can't you do all that later? -You wanted these arranged right away. I know what I want! Just leave me alone! I'm working! No, you're not! You're howling! You've been howling for weeks and weeks! And if you want to fire me, go ahead! Who wants to work for a coyote? Coyote. -Can I help you? -Yes, you can take your cat back. I should think this little game of yours is about worn thin. What on earth are you doing with Pyewacket? -Somebody gave him my address. -Well, I didn't! -He's your cat, isn't he? -No, he's not my cat. I don't care whether you put him outside my window or had him fly there. It doesn't matter. I thought I made myself clear on that. -What do you mean, he's not your cat? -He doesn't belong to me anymore. Why not? He broke too many shells. -Where's he going? -Queenie's. He's hers now. Queenie's? Yes. Queenie. I'm sorry, Shep. I'll speak to her. I promise nothing else will happen. I didn't mean to get sore. That's all right. -When did all this take place? -Recently. -It's quite a change, isn't it? -Yes. You seem changed, too. Do I? Please, you don't have to stay and be polite. -Is this one of the rare ones? -No. It's a Triton's Trumpet. From the Philippines. Are you doing well? Yes, very. How are things with you? -Fine. -Good. How's Merle? She's fine. Fine, I guess. I haven't seen much of her lately. I must say it was decent of you not to hex her after all. -Did you think better of it? -Yes. It's extraordinary the way we can discuss things like this. -Because.. -I know, we're strangers to each other. No, not quite that. I wish you wouldn't stare at me so. -Gil, you're not blushing? -Of course not. I want you to have this. It's a small return for what I cost you. So little, compared to what you gave me. -I never gave you much of anything. -Yes, you did. You gave me something wonderful! You made me unhappy. -You're crying, too! -All right, I'm crying! -Why didn't you come and tell me? -I don't know. Pride, I guess, or shame. -How did it happen? -It just happened. It does, sometimes. No, it only happens one way. The story is, it only happens if you fall in love. And it's been happening to me, too. Ever since I walked in here. Only it's real this time. Or has it been real all along? Who's to say what magic is? -Gil, don't you want to stop crying now? -I don't think I can.

[ officer ] who is felix ? all right, i'm felix. i did it. okay, felix, spread your legs, put your hands behind your back. let's go. just because he's an ex-con, you blame it on felix. well, officer, here's your big murder weapon. don't, gracie ! no, no, gracie, you can't ! i did it ! felix ! stop !

As if the management is not at all concerned with your safety, the entire contraption is about to collapse, and to top it off, there are supernatural powers out there. just waiting to pull you off the tracks. and out into your worst, cruelest nightmare- the wild blue. They want you to believe that anything can happen. And they're right.

Did you say you hadn't slept since you were 14? Pretty much. You look great, considering. Thank you. - Rita what? - Uh, Boyle. Peter Hoskins. - Hoskins? - As in "Hoskin's disease. " Oh, Hodgkin. No, no.

Sorry. - Wine's fine, thanks. Rita has insomnia. Oh, yeah? Listen, I gotta pee. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Forgive me. So, what do you do when you're not not sleeping? Oh, I usually write in my journal. You mean, for a living? I'm a bartender. - Oh, really, where? - Yeah. At the Tin Market. You work Saturdays? Well, you must make good money. - What are your aspirations in that case? - I'm, like, a graphic designer. Oh, great. So, why can't you sleep? You know what's good? I forget what it's called. It's an herb. - I tried it. - Didn't work? I can't remember what it's called either. My memory's terrible. Maybe that's why you can't sleep- you forget how tired you are. Well, if you need any help getting to sleep, I - Sorry. Nice talking to you. You too. I stood outside for awhile. just listening to the silence. Then I tried to figure out which window was hers, and what her life might be like, and why she couldn't sleep. Like that. The spell was cast. # There's always something in the road # # Always something in the road # # Keeping me from the one thing # # That I want # # The one thing I will never have # Hi. Oh, hi. Is this all right? No, I'm sorry. You can never come in here. What's new? Since yesterday? Let's see. So much has happened. You look great. What will you drink? Do you have Molson? - Did you get some sleep? - Eventually. - You? - Sleep? Oh. I don't have any trouble. But let's see. I read The White Hotel today. Oh. That was pretty much it. How was it? - Did you read it? - No. But I read some of the case histories that it was based on. You have? Freud. You've read Freud? - Have you? - No. But this book starts. with this very highfalutin', sexual dream thing, you know? Yeah, I hear everybody beats off when they read it. I'm sorry. You heard that? - Go on. - This lovely, very neurotic woman. goes into therapy with Freud him self. - Right. - And he sort of cures her, so that she can go on to live for awhile. before being killed by the Nazis. in a. lime pit. Uh, happy, happy stuff. So, why were you in Europe for ten years? How did you know I was in Europe? Word gets a rou nd. You asked Taylor about me? You were asking around about me? Let's get ma rried. Okay. Okay. - This is the story, and I'm not making it up. - Okay. - And it's not as sad as it sounds. - Shoot. My parents separated when I was four. I went to live with my grand parents- who are unfortunately deceased now- - I'm gonna make this as brief as possible. - Take your time. - And- - We can go up to my place when you're done. And everything worked out great for everybody. It was amazing. No. Go on. I'm four years old. I go to live with my grand parents, who both wound up having to go into nursing homes when I was 12. They were both sick. So I go to live with my mother, who by this time is remarried to Hank, - Uh-huh. - A very unhappy person. Ridicules me in front of the other two children they have created. from their unsavory loins. So I go to live with my father, who has also remarried with three other children. Sophie, the new wife, hates me even more than Hank. This is like Dickens. The only nice thing Sophie ever did for me was make the same food twice. when I made the mistake of saying thatlliked it. Usually she would stop cooking whatever it was I saidlliked. What was it? Whatlliked? Spaetzles. Oh, God. You've had spaetzles? Oh, sure. You like them? I love them. You love spaetzles. - Anyway, everyone is unhappy now. - Uh-huh. My father doesn't seem too fond of me. I'm not sure if he ever was, but- So one night I say I'm going to the movies, and instead, I go to Europe. What movie? The Wild Bunch, I think. Why? Did you call them? - Not until I got there. And I called collect. - Europe? - That is- - Yeah. - Good for you. - Yeah. Why did you ask me which movie? That is fabulous. - That's the story. - Oh, wow. Then I came back when my dad died. Somebody call about the ice machine? - Tom. - Hmm? - This is Peter. - Hi. How do you do? But I was only in the party. for two months. - I've never known a communist. - Socialist. Socialist. It was a strange time. So what was Amsterdam like? Do you speak Dutch? Ja. Say something in Dutch. Je hebt erg witte tanden. What's that? You have very white teeth. Oh, thank you. Now you say, "Om je beter mee op teeten. " Wait. Okay. What is it? Om je beter mee op teeten. "Om me. " - Beter. - Beter. - Mee op teeten. - Mee op teeten. Om je beter mee op teeten. Great. You 've got a good ear. - Oh, good ear, clean teeth. - You do. What did I say? - I can't tell you. - I knew you were gonna say that. - I knew it. - No. It's untranslatable. I'm sure it is. I'll tell you someday. I will. I promise. When you're first getting to know someone. and in that blissful, psychotic first flush of love, it seems like every aspect of their personality- their whole demeanor, the simple lovely twist of their ear lobes, and their marvelous phone voice, and their soft, dark, wet. whatever. is somehow imbued with an extra push of color- an intensity heretofore, you know, unknown. You want a Molson? - You drink Molson? - Uh -huh. In your own home? I've been known to. So why can't you sleep? I want to solve this. I wasn't exaggerating. It's been since I was 14. Aha. That's a lot of journal - keeping. # Every time # # We say good-bye # # I die a little # Have you seen doctors? I've seen all the doctors. Uh-huh. - Every known persuasion. - Right. - And I've in gested countless pills and liquids. - Thank you. I've seen an acupuncturist. You did? What did it feel like? Little needles in your back. - It hurt? - Sometimes. You're really beautiful. You are. Thank you. That's, uh- Thank you. What do you do for a living? # There's no love song finer # # But how strange the change # # From major to minor # I make little tiny transparent photographs of scientific articles. which are rolled onto strips like microfilm, only smaller. You'd. like it. It's really interesting. Do you see your family? Your mom? No. Sometimes? Never? Nope. Call them? Uh-uh. Do you miss them? - Hey. - Hey. What's your dirtiest fantasy? Excuse me? You know, I thought you just said, " What is my dirtiest fantasy". What? I can't. I'm sorry. Come on. No. What's yours, though? I'd be curious. I asked you first. Well, they change. Sure. What's one? Well- One. Uh-huh. might be that someone. Uh-huh. might sort of, just, you know, spontaneously start crawling across the floor. on their. hands and knees, and more or less. unzip me. with their. teeth. I'd do that. Christ. Happiness. - Are you? - Uh-huh. You are? It's like a drug. - It is a drug. - Sex? To snare us into mating. I must be peaking then. - You know, the body manufactures it. - Uh-huh. Like epinephrine, or something. Did I detect a note of cynicism in your comment about mating? Oh. No. You don't like kids? No. I love them. But you don't want to have them? No, I don't. But- - Why not? - I just don't. Your career? What career? No. I think kids are great. I just don't think it's fair to raise them in the world the way it is now. Where else are you going to raise them? We're here. Say. Like the woman in The White Hotel, people really do struggle their wholelives just to die in lime pits. And not just in books. Women. go blind. from watching their children being murdered. Not in this country, they don't. They get shot on the sidewalk in front of their houses in some drug war. Just what happened to you- being passed from one parent to the next- I survived. I'll be lying in bed late at night and I'll look at the light in the room. And I'll suddenly see it all go upinablinding flash- in flames- and I'm the only one left alive. And I can't look at you sitting there. without imagining you. dying- bursting into flames. No wonder you can't sleep. The world is a really terrible place. It's too. precarious. And you want kids, obviously. I wish I could say I did. It's okay. We saw each other every day for the next six weeks. I'd stop by my apartment every once in a while. to see if the view out into the air shaft had improved any. But. all my clothes had found their way over to Rita's. I told my parents about you. What did you tell them? I said that you were very considerate. In what way? I said, well- I mean, we talk very frankly about sex. You and your parents? I said that you always brought protection. You did not. And that you were very attentive to whether or not I had an orgasm. This is such bullshit. No, I said they should meet you. What do you think? Protection. So are you free this weekend? Don't be nervous. You told them about my family and everything? My mother. - She knows the story? - Mm-hmm. They know all about me? Uh-huh. Will you marry me? Uh-huh. You will? No. Peter. Hop to. Oh. Mom. Nice to meet you. Dad. Dr. Boyle. These are my parents. So. I understand you're a manager in a publishing firm. That's correct. Yes. That must be, uh- - What kind of firm is it? - Publishing. What? Don't belittle me in front of new people. Be little? Dad, please. What kind of publishing firm is it, I was asking. It's, uh, scientific publishing. They publish scientific, uh, publishing things. Journals. I knew I knew that. You want a beer? Sure. In the morning, Rita? Yes, Mother. We've been drinking nonstop for weeks. It's time you knew this about us. - I'll have one too then. - Me too. A bunch of lushes here, Rita. You didn't tell me. Oh, I can pull four wisdom teeth on a fifth of Stoli. - You can? - He's teasing you. Scien- What kind of scientific? Abstracting and indexing. It's a service. - Like a database? - It is a database. - It is a database. Covering? - All kinds of fields. - All kinds? - Pretty much. You know, everything from energy to robotics- thank you- to medical articles. - So you are the manager? - Of the fiche department. - Microfiche? - Right. - Now, what is it? - Microfiche. It's like microfilm, only smaller. Aha. Little film. - All right, we approve. - Daddy. We're just playing with you. Maybe now she'll get some sleep. So, how long have you two been going out? Over a year now. About that, year. That's my first bull dog. Okay. No! No! No! Daddy, no! Please. If he's gonna be in this family, you ought to see these guys. You really should. This monster I got when I was an undergraduate at Virginia. See his little tail? I stood in front of the mirror in their upstairs guest room. Iooking out over the yard and the little tent and the food which had been catered. I felt a certain kinship with these people- the caterers. Don't look. It's badluck. All right, I won't. But wait, you don't believe in that, do you? - You looked. - I won't look. Now you've already cursed the first 14 years of our marriage. I love you. What about when I'm a hundred years old with a mustache and yellow teeth? I'll still love you. And I'm sagging down to here and I'm bald? I'll love you all the more. Are you sure? Yes, I promise. Oh, can't we ask one of the boys in the neighborhood to do that? I am one of the boys in the neighborhood. What do you mean? Let me get rid of these. Okay. Are you gonna join the living? Hmm? - Well, hello. - Too late. Sorry, all done. You should have spoken sooner. You going for a walk? See you all in a bit. Now, there's nothing to worry about. This is a natural step in life's plan. Ah. Like sliding down a banister. that turns into a razor blade. Where to? Round trip. To Lake Forest. Lake Forest. They've asked that we all sit down. Is there a nother language you all speak? Come on. Let's go. Okay. Let's try to stick together. - Is Grand ma gonna meet us? - Yeah, she should be in the car. I, Peter take thee, Rita. to be my wedded wife. To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish until death do us part. And thereto I pledge thee my troth. I, Rita take thee, Peter. to be my wedded husband. To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, In sickness and in health. in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish. till death us do part. And thereto I pledge thee my troth. I pronounce. by the authority committed unto me as a minister of God. that you are husband and wife. according to the law of this state, and in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. I think a little applause would be in order. Smush together. Come on. Marshal. - Marshal! - What? Get in the picture. Jesus Christ. I thought you were on fire. Get in. Say " bull shit. " Bull shit. Now, you. I'm so happy. - So happy. - Well. Peter, you remember my Aunt Dorothy. and Uncle Fred. - Yes. Hi, how are you? - Peter and Rita. - That's very euphonious. - Isn't it? - You must get a lot of " Peter and Riter." - Yes. Or "Pita and Rita, " I suppose. - It's hard to say, I know. - Excuse me. You know, I was the world's youngest aunt. Uh-oh, here we go. No, now. I remember Rita trying to say my name. - when I was 16 and she was just- - Minus 20. All right, I deserve that. Fred says I always shave. two years off my age. I've never known anybody who has a niece so young. - I was 15. - What? Who was 15? Stop. You're gonna give me a complex. Mom. Who's that guy over there in the strawhat? Oh, uh - N o. I thought he was with your firm. Marsh. Hey. Marsh. Behind me. Don't look now. Very peculiar. Never saw him before in my life. Congratulations, both of you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - I'm Taylor McGowan. - You make a lovely couple. And your name? I'm sorry. And what a wonderful day for it. Nice to meet you. You'll have to forgive us. But none of us seems to remember who you are. - It' s all right, Daddy. - I only wanted to wish the two you g people well. And perhaps to. kiss the bride. - before I'm on my way. - I'd be flattered. Some angle this guy's got. My blessings to you. And to you. - You want to sit down? - Get him a chair, Fred. Too much blood rushing to the wrong place, I guess. Are you dizzy? I t's okay. Just relax. Here we go. Now, just breathe for me. Daddy? Oh, God. He thinks Marshal is his father. Where do you live? Can you tell us? He's gonna be fine, everybody. Just relax. Get him a glass of water, Fred. He's had too much to drink, I suspect. Am I right? Peter. What's happening? I thought you said you didn't know him. - Should we call an ambulance? - No, no. Just get him a cup of coffee. Is there anyone we can call? No. I'm sorry for any trouble I've caused you. - There's no troubl e. - Honey, don't let him - I'm fine, thanks. Honey. Who is he? Where did he come from? He's from the neighborhood. - The Evans' gardener? - Is he? No. - What if he falls down in the gravel? - Are you okay? Oh, what a fuss. Forget all about it. He's not going to sue us. Trust me. Oh, poor baby. It's just spoiled your whole wedding. Oh, Marion. Have some champagne. Your father thinks that's the Evans' gardener. - Enough. - Well, I don't think so. Do you? Rita? Rita? Must have been my kiss is all I can think. Drives men wild. That's right. Where are you going for your honeymoon? Why, you wanna come? - Jamaica. - Oh. I love you all. Bye! I just keep thinking about that poor old schmuck. He seemed so vulnerable. Calling me honey, and- I swear I've never seen him before. You are too much. - What's come overyou? - You like? I- Yes. I think you're out of your mind andl love you. Come on. Day's a-wastin'. Chop, chop. # Again # # This couldn't happen again # Don't you even want to try one? No, thanks. Sorry you married me? Rita, you were supposed to laugh. Aw. You're my puppy puppy. Thank you. Okay. You know how you never get any time. to work on your portfolio? Well, now that we have just the one rent, what if just for a while- not forever- you quit tending bar and let me support us? Sure. What? You'd consider it? Let you bring home the bacon for a while, right? Our first full day being married. and she seemed like a different Rita. I told myself, "It's the excitement. " And besides, it's natural to wonder, "Is this the right person for me? "Am I the right person for her? Who the hell is she anyway? " Baby, I'm sorry. I'm freaking out. Are you sorry you married me? No. Oh. I'm serious this time. Don't be a silly. The days went by. We went to a soccer game, we windsurfed- or "windfell "- we snorkeled, we walked on the beach, and always under a ton of sunscreen. Rita was tireless, fearless, and sleeping. Nothing was wrong, exactly, but nothing felt- nothing felt. # Down at the bay where the lights are gay # # And the sun shines daily # # On the mountaintop # Excuse me. # I'm sad to say I'm on my way # # I won't be back for many a day # They're a riot. He calls her " Little Missie." Their grand son is a comedy weatherman in Boca. Something from the bar? Yes. Another seltzer, please. And clean this up, would you? It's drawing flies. I'll have a Long Island iced tea this time. Thanks. A lot. Doesn't it ever bother you sometimes, though, the black-white thing? I mean, it's so obviously a class issue here. You'd think they'd all just rise up and kill us all pool side. Why is that? Because we have the money and they don't. You want to give them your money, go ahead. Oh. Good attitude. Look, I'm just making conversation here, Rita, you're the commie in the wood pile, not me. I'm sorry, sir. The bartender say he don't know that. Oh. What goes into one, a Long Island iced tea? Rita. I'm sorry, darling. I've forgotten. What, do you have it all written down behind the bar or something? I'm on vacation. So you can't remember a drink recipe for something that I would like to order? Peter, you're doing it again. You take a perfect situation and you pee all over it. Be happy. It's great to be alive! And young! There will never be a more perfect night. Or a better chance for two people to love each other. if they don't try so hard. Make love to me. What, here? No one will see. I want to have your baby. I want your baby inside m e. You don't want babies. Don't you remember? Sweetie. No. You never say that. Or " puppy puppy" or " chop chop." You don't drink now. Rita used to drink like a fish. You're not using salt. - Peter. - You're a communist or a socialist- whatever you are- you don't defend the social order in Jamaica, or anywhere. You need to take a hot bath. and breathe life in. The world is a glorious place to live. Rita is afraid of life. I'm gonna insist that you see someone. when we get back to Chicago. Je hebt erg witte tanden. - Thanks. - What did I say? You said my teeth are white. You know what you said. Yes! My baby. Thank you. - What do you say? - What do you mean? What's your line? What do you say? - You memorized it. - I'm sorry, Peter. N o. In Dutch. Rita, what do you say? I say, " good night." No, please. You're lying. Hey! Watch it, pal. I want you, Rita. I want you to be you. I'm sorry I can't be whatever it is you want me to be. This is all I am. Maybe what you saw wasn't here at all. They're waiting for a decision. Rochelle has another question about storage. So, Tay, if you could, like, switch souls with somebody- you know, go inside their body and they go inside yours- You know, switch. Mm-hmm. Do you think it would be possible if you didn't know someone, to impersonate them by just being inside them. a d. looking like them? - Where are they? - Inside you. - And you're in them? - Right. Why would you want to go inside another person's body if you didn't know them? That's conjecture. I think I know that, Peter. But wouldn't you do better to pick somebody that you knew? So then you could do, or be, or have. the things that they did, or " beed " or had? Right. Are you Rita now? Is that what you're telling me? That you two have. merged? All right. Have you ever- This is sort of a bizarre question. - But have you ever been having sex with somebody. - No. and they're doing everything right- - more or less- - Oh, yeah. Sex. I remember. and you just get the feeling that something is wrong? I mean, they pretty much stop doing. some of the things they used to do. and only do certain things now- more traditional sorts of things? Blow jobs, you mean? No. I'm not talking about anything specific. No one likes to do that. Wel, that happens not to be strictly the case, but- No, no. I'm just telling you. No woman ever enjoyed doing that. It's common knowledge. You haven't had sex, but you know all a bout it? I'm just trying to help. Thank you. That night, everything was miraculously restored. Hi. How was work? - Okay. - It was? I'm making you a surprise. What? Guess. I can't. Spaetzles? # Every time we say good-bye # I'm sure they won't be as good as Sophie's, but- What's this? Dewar's. You want a Molson? Sure. # When you leave there's such # # An air of spring # So I started reading that, finally. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, I know things were difficultin Jamaica. Maybe it's taken me this time to get used to being married. But. I love you, Peter. # Every time # # We say # # Good-bye # You read her journal, didn't you? You figured out how to fix your hair. from the pictures in the albums. What she drinks. Where is she? Please. Don't be angry. You can go back wherever you came from, and I won't tell a soul. You don't even have to tell me who you are. Just tell me where Ritais, and we'll pretend this never took place. Okay. - Play it your way. But I'm onto you. Hey, Pete. You're back. How was your honeymoon? Great, thanks. - How's Rit? - Great. Where is she? Not feeling too well, actually. Let me have a double vodka on the rocks. Got your postcard. Yeah? Here you go. It's on the house. Don't mention it. Dewar's please. # I been carryin' my heavy load # # Waiting for the light to come shining through # # Someone like you # # Make it all worthwhile # Is he a regular? He. looks familiar. You know him? # I been doin' some soul searching # Have we- Have we met? Mind if I sit? You were at my wedding, weren't you? Do I know you? What's my stepmother's name? Uh - What's the movie I said I was going to see the night I left for Europe? The Wild Bunch. Je hebt erg witte tanden. Not anymore. What's your father's tattoo say, right here? " Bruno, " his first bull dog. I knew it wasn't you! I knew it! Oh, I knew i t! Oh, my God! Rita! Maybe we shouldn't, uh- How- How much do I owe you here, Tom? No, it's on the house. - Oh! Okay. - Okay. Great. Great. Uh- Okay? I - I'm just gonna walk the old guy down to the train. - Uh, o-okay. - Yeah. - Good to see you, Tom. - Uh, you too. - Tell Rita I hope she feels better. - I will. Uh, I will. Uh, come on. Let's get out of here. I missed ya. - Where did you go? - Berwyn. I stayed with his family. Julius Becker. He had his wallet on him. I didn't know what else to do, where to go. I couldn't tell my mom or go to the cops. Who would believe me, right? They could've thrown me into an institution or an old folk's home. I didn't even have our keys. I had to pretend to be him until you figured it out. And I knew you would. I think this is like one of those dreams. where you keep telling yourself, "Just hang on. " and we're all gonna wake up. We'll walkin and she'll be there and it's gonna be okay, Rita." I just keep thinking there's something I'm forgetting. When he leaned in to kiss me, something- I - I gotta slow down. I'm sorry. - That's okay. - I get short of breath. - Better? - What was I saying? You get short of breath. No, before that. I'm not senile. I know. I know. Yeah, I thought maybe it was salmonella from those horrible chicken wings, and I was i magining it all. So how was our honeymoon? Oh, come on. Does he know you know? - He? - She, whatever. Yes. He does. I think maybe you should wait out in the hallway. in case he tries to. bolt. Thanks. What's the matter? Where's Rita? I'm sorry about this, Peter. - Did something happen? - You knowllike you. What do you m an, you're sorry? Ri a's gone back to Lake Forest with her mother, Peter. Why? I don't think it's a good idea for you to come to the house or call. for awhile, until she calms down. I went for a walk. " Calms down "? We brought both cars so I could pick up some of her things, and I'll be out of your way momentarily. Wait a minute! Marshal! I'm sorry for whatever personal turmoil you're going through, son. Turmoil? What did she tell you? If you want me to refer you to someone- Rita says. that you're suffering from delusions, Peter. And I should tell you that she's talking about. filing for a divorce. - Or an annulment. Whichever. - Oh, now- Okay. What sort of delusions did she say I was suffering from? She says. that you're convinced she's someone else. Uh-huh. Sure. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to defer to her wishes. I can't believe this! You're just gonna take her word? It's difficult for me to believe, knowing Rita the way that I do, - that this is about as quabble or a tiff of some kind. - You don't know her! You don't know the first thing about her. That's the absurd part. You don't even know your own flesh and blood. I'm sure you're right, Peter. Rita was a communist. Did you know that? Thats he was in a communist or socialist party? Then all right. Here's something else you didn't know. We didn't go out for a yea r. We didn't go out for anything like a year. You only see what you wanna see. - She's lying to you now, Dr. Boyle. - Let go, please. She may know certain facts, but that's from reading Rita's journals. Watch her. Watch the way she sits. - Her eyes. - See a doctor, boy. Watch the way she listens to everything we say. It isn't her! The way she chews, for Christ sake. I'd like to leave now. - Open your eyes! Look, I'm not equipped for this. I'm sorry. I'm not attracted to you. What are you, nuts? I don't think that's the issue here. Have a seat. Come on. - You' re just- - If I thought that you really were here, Rita, I - What's the name- okay- of the guy you went out within high school? Wait. The one who wanted to run away with you. If I can't remember his name, then you can't remember it either. - John. - Oh, Rita. You're not imagining me. This just does not happen. Tell me about it. All right. Think. Let me see his wallet, please. May I? Thank you. - Becker. Is he Dutch, do you know? - Is it a Dutch name? You were the one that said you lived there, Rita. Jesus! Well, they don't speak Dutch. I can't exactly ask. I'm trying to keep alow profile in case they find out I'm really a girl. Okay? Who is it? - Hi, Ms. Blier. - Don't worry. What? What's wrong? My name is Barry Sanford. Your dad apparently walked up to a couple of young gentlemen. - I got lost. - downtown. and asked them what city he was in, and they were kind enough to call us at the hot line. I'm home now, so- I work with the Madison Street Crisis Intervention Center. We just wanted to make sure that he got home safe. Oh, uh, come in, please. I'm Leah. This is my husband, Jerry. - Hi, Larry Sanford. - What can we get you? Come on in. Something to- You're sure? Yes, thank you. You told me you were going for a walk. Did you take the train again? I got lost, I told you. Your dad's gonna be fine, Mrs. Blier. - Why did you take the train? - Please. Daddy. Did you want to go somewhere? I'm going to lie down. Don't wake me up. You want me to go with you? You wanna lie down, I'll stay here. This is how he gets. Two weeks ago, we had to go pick him up in Lake Forest. Why? Did he know someone there? N, not that we're aware of. He doesn't always get this way. - Lately. - He just takes off. Is your father involved in any. activities that might bring him into the city? He isn't involved in anything. We keep telling him to take an interestin life. Is your father suffering from any. mental or neurological disorders? He hasn't been him self since my mother died last fall. He had to move in with us, and- This has been coming on for a while. What has? I'm not saying he can't stay here. He struggled for so many years just to make ends meet. Then when he was ready to retire, boom. We'd just gotten my mother buried. We found out he has lung cancer a few weeks ago. He always complains, so I didn't- I guess I didn't take it serious, and cirrhosis he's had for years. I can't put him away. He doesn't even have a year to live. You know? If you knew the man he used to be- He was a-a self-starter, area I fighter. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Blier. I - - Oh- I think I left the gas on in the kitchen. in the center. Well, should I call someone? No, no. I'm so embarrassed. The fire department? - I apologize. - I'll drive you. - No. - Yes. Uh, no. I have a car. It's just up the street. I'll be fine, thanks. I'll call. So what did she say? Nothing. - Am I sick? - No. This is me, Peter. Remember? You have lung cancer and cirrhosis. She said she thought you had a year to live. Wow. The next six days were the worst, the strangest, of my life. We moved back and forth from room to room. We called her parents. No answer. The next day, the same. And the next. I called Rita's Aunt Dorothy in Cincinnati. She had no idea where they were, and wanted to know why I didn't know. I told her Rita and I had split up. Trust me. The car's gone. Mom never turns the lights out, ever. - They're not here. Then why are we whispering? Some suitcases are gone. I miss your face. How soft it was. I miss it too. Your hair was so great. Oh, come on. And your little white feet. What? You don't like these? At night I could feel the loneliness. coming off both of us like heat. It was as if we'd been married forever, suddenly, without the sex. Rita and I, mean while, kept up the pleasantries. The old married couple we'd become. Time's up. Rita. What? You know, if you think how we're born, and we go through all the struggle of growing up. and learning the multiplication tables. and the nam e for everything. The rules. How not to get runover, braid your hair, pig Latin. Just all the effort. Then getting a job, probably something you don't even like doing. for not enough money, like tending bar. And that's if you're lucky. That's if you're. not born in Calcutta. or the U.S. without money. Then there's your marriage, having your own kids if- You know. And they're going through the same struggle all over again. Only worse, because. somebody's trying to sell them crack in the first grade by now. And all this time, you're paying taxes, your hair starts to fall out, and you're wearing six pairs of glasses. which you can never find. And you can't recognize yourself in the mirror. And if you live long enough, you finally get to watch everybody die. All your loved ones- your wife, your husband. Your kids, maybe. And you're totally alone. And as a final reward for all this, you disappear. No one knows where. I don't want you to die, Rita. I don't want me to die either. And I'm going to. So are you. But. we got to have this. I mean, what a trip. meeting you. and being in love, falling. It was bitchin' for a while. And okay. So this isn't such a turn-on, I admit, but- I adore you. - What? My hearing. No, I'm serious. I said you would've hated Jamaica. Trust me. Come on. Call again. I mean, he's always saying, " Oh, you know- Wow, you have got to come to this club, the Aquamarine. " - Have you been there? - No? Oh, you're kidding. It 's actually pretty cool. They've got all these different bars and huge fish tanks. - It's really pretty amazing- you know, for about a minute. - Hello? - Oh, Marion, it's Peter. - I thought it might be you. - Where have you been? I've been worried. How's Rita? She's terrible, Peter. We took her to London. She was so shook up, Marsha I thought she needed a rest. What happened between the two of you, Peter? If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to. I guess I must've said something about her. not being the same person. But I would do anything. to get Rita back. I love her with all my heart and soul. You can't come here, Peter. If either of them knew I was talking to you, they'd have me shot at sunrise. What if- It's just a thought- but what if you said I was going away on business for a couple of weeks? Oh, I don't know, Peter. And you said that she could stop by. and pick up her things from storage in the basement. All her old letters and diaries from her childhood. And when you came by with her, I'd be here, and we could talk. When would you want us? - Anytime. - I'm not promising anything. - I understand. - Monday? Monday's great! - I'll try. That's all I can do. - I understand. Thank you. What time? - Anytim e. - Noon, say? - Noon's great. - High noon. High noon. - Peter. - Yes? What you said before. about Rita not being the same person- Uh-huh. She may not be the picture of the woman you thought she was, but that's an image, Peter. Just a picture. Words. That's life. That's marriage. But I know she loves you. and misses you. I miss her too. All right. I'll see you Monday then. - Thank you, Mom. - Allri ght. - Bye. - Bye, now. She'll try. He keeps it clean. Now, I want you to talk, Rita. I want you both to talk. That's all. You can do that much, since you took the trouble to marry him. This was my idea, by the way. How have you been? - I wanted to come. - Really? I wouldn't have thought that. But you're here, so- Can I get you something? It's been real lonely without you, Rita. You, uh, went to London, your mom says. H w was it? Okay, tie his feet! Rita, come on! Give me- Gi - Goddamn it! Okay. Give me the knife. Rita! Kiss him. Go on! Rita? No, it didn't work. - Is it you? - I don't know how it happened. - I don't know what I did. - I'll kill you! I swear to God I will! - Peter- - How the hell did you do this? - Put the knife down, please. - It's a trick, Rita. - Don't you know that much? - He doesn't know. Give it to me. - Are you here, Rita? - Yes. I'm right here. - Talk to me if you're here. Please! - Give me the knife. - I can't. - Put it down. All right? Just- - Thank you. - Where did you go? I couldn't imagine what happened to you. Watch him. 4320 Southeast Avenue. - How is Leah? - I think she misses ya. She keeps making soup and offering me another cup. - and another cup- - Your mother? She isn't serious about the peanut butter and mayonnaise. Oh, she made you one? A sandwich? - Stop this. - I haven't had one of those since grade school! I'd almost forgotten. Did you try one? - Rita! - Oh, they're really good! I've been over and over it. so many times, you know? Exactly- Have you tried? I wanted it. That's all I know. I got on a train going nowhere, as far as I knew. There you were- a wedding. Young people starting a life. I wis hed to God I was that brideg room starting out, or the bride, for that matter. Look at the shine in those eyes. Oh, you're ki dding. I was totally freaked from the moment I woke up. I was terrified. I thought, if I could shine. like the light of that girl over there, I'd never take another drink. I'd let my liver hang on another decade. Stay out of the sun. Eat right. This tim e I would floss. I remember now. Oh, God. I wanted to be you. For one second of one day, what it would be like to just be. - Yes. - And not be afraid. - If I could just get inside, - If I could get inside, - I'll kss the bride. - my whole life would be behind me. My whole life would be a head of me again. - Look at her- the soft arms, the white teeth. - That smell. - That sweet smell on her breath. - A man. Not like something rotting coming up from your insides, but soft. - Like a father. - Like a baby. And white. An old man. with nothing- - Nothing to lose. - Nothing to lose. All you got to do is want it. bad enough. My God. Rita? Like an old suit. My wife and daughter had a bond. I loved them both so much I wanted to eat them alive. Women make a life. inside their body. And that life comes out and holds onto them. Clings to them. Calls them up from school and says, " I'm sick, Ma. Come pick me up." That baby is theirs for life. Don't you see? To be able to look back. from their side of the bed, with their eyes, at last. And you, my boy- I tried to be patient. I tried to be interested. I called every hotel in Ocho Rios. What the hell is a Long Island iced tea? You're a sweet kid. No hard feelings, but. you're not my type. - Please. - I don't know. The idea of livin' forever- It's not so good. And those parents of yours you can keep. Thank you. Do yourselves a favor. Floss. Oh, my God! My body! My body! There they are. Look at those. Yes. Your hair. I'm here! I'm not afraid. I know. I'm not afraid! Oh,I love you! Give me a smile. Je hebt erg witte tanden. Je hebt erg witte tanden. Oh! I don't remember what I was supposed to say, Peter. - I know I memorized it. - Om je beter mee op te eten. You promised you'd tell me. What does it mean? The better to eat you with. Never, never to be squandered- the miracle of a nother human being. - You're the miracle. - No, you are.

I'm trading my wife's old car in. Say good-bye to the old gas-guzzler, Russ! It's pretty exciting, isn't it, Rusty? What's that, Dad? Picking up the new car! You can't wait, can you? Hi there, Ed! Good to see you, Mr. Griswold! How are you doing? Rubin right? Rusty. Look at him. He can't wait. So, did you bring your trade-in? Yes, a guy just took it away a couple of seconds ago. Well, let's get to it, then. We were worried that the new car might not be ready yet. We're on our way to California in the morning big vacation, the whole family, Walley World. Walley World? Very exciting, Clyde. Clark. Well, there she is. Where? Right here. The wagon. Dad, this is not the car you ordered! Take it easy, Rusty. Ed, this is not the car I ordered. I distinctly ordered the Antarctic Blue, Super Sportswagon with the C.B. and the optional Rally fun pack. You didn't order the Metallic Pea? Metallic Pea? No, Antarctic Blue. The Sportswagon. This isn't even the right model! You know, I think you're right. I don't think this is the car. This is the new Wagonqueen Family Truckster. This is a fine automobile, if you want my honest opinion. It beats the hell out of the Sportswagon but I want to make you happy. Davenport! I'll get to the bottom of this. Mr. Griswold ordered a blue Sportswagon. Where is it? I don't know, sir. I know what must have happened! It didn't come in! Ed, I'm not your ordinary, everyday fool. Okay? Now, I'd like my Antarctic Blue Super Sportswagon right now. If you can't get it for me, I'm going to take my business elsewhere! Where's my old car? I'm just as upset as you are. Believe me. Davenport! Get Mr. Griswold's car back! Bring it back here! And I can get you the wagon, there's no problem there. The problem is, it might take six weeks. Now, I owe it to myself to tell you, Mr. Griswold if you're thinking of taking the tribe cross-country this is the automobile you should be using. The Wagonqueen Family Truckster. You think you hate it now, but wait until you drive it. I don't want to drive it. I just want my old car back, okay? I'm not falling for this bit. No way. Let's go, Russ. Clark, is that the right car? No, it isn't, honey. I changed my mind. They flattened our old car like a pancake. Are you serious? Is this really our car, Dad? What happened? I thought we were going to get the little Sportswagon. Oh, no! The Sportswagon's much too small. Besides, I got a great deal on this one. Believe me, we're taking the whole tribe across country. This is your automobile. Why is it still running? Oh, all new cars do that. I'll take care of that in a second. You may think you hate it now, but wait until you drive it. An air bag! You know, Clark, it's not too late to fly out to California. We only have two weeks. Let's not get into that again, sweet pie. Please? Lots of families fly, Clark. Especially cross-country. The idea of a family vacation is to be together as a family. On a plane, you put on earphones and you're lost in your own world. It's a very long drive, Clark. I'm looking forward to a long drive. You get to see the kids all the time! I only see them a few minutes in the mornings and evenings and a few hours on the weekends. Someday I'll wake up and realize my babies have grown up! And then what? I just thought it would be easier to fly. Nothing that is worthwhile is easy, Ellen. We know that. Kids? Do you want to see the trip plan? Not now, we're playing a game! Okay, shut off the video games. Come on, Russ. Shut it off. I know you'll enjoy this. I've worked out the whole trip on the computer so that we get the maximum amount of fun time at Walley World without missing any of the good stuff along the way. Here we go! There's us. And there's Walley World! Now, let's just take a look at Day One. Shall we? Honey, come on in! We're going to do Day One! Okay, now, there's the Family Truckster as we leave Chicago. Rusty, please, do not eat the Truckster! Russ, do you mind? I'm trying to work this out here on the computer. Okay, Audrey. Thank you, Audrey. That's just great. Look out, Dad, here I come. All right, that's enough, Russ. Okay, now, I think we're moving further. Good shot, Audrey. Dad, I forgot. Why aren't we flying? Because getting there is half the fun! You know that! I turned off the water, the stove, the heat and the air. Locked the door and notified the police. Stopped the newspapers. I called to get the grass cut. Did I put the timers on the living room lights? Don't forget the mail. So long! Drive careful now, Clark! Watch those freeways! Good-bye! I know I've forgotten something. Walley World, here we come! "Mockingbird, tell me, everybody "Have you heard? "He's gonna buy me. "A mockingbird "And if that mockingbird don't sing "He's gonna buy me a diamond ring "And if that diamond ring don't shine "He's surely gonna break this heart of mine "And that's why I keep on singin' "Did you hear now." Come on, kids. We don't know any of your songs! Dad, is that made up? It sounds made up! I know a song! How about "The Walley World National Anthem"? Okay, you start it. "Who's the moosiest moose we know? Marty Moose! "Who's the star of our favorite show? Marty Moose! " 'M' is for merry, we're merry, you see " 'O' is for 'O' gosh! 'O' golly! 'O' gee! " 'S' is for super-swell family glee " 'E' is for everything you want to be "M-A-R-T-Y "M-O-O-S-E "What's that spell? "Marty Moose, Marty Moose, Marty Moose "That's me!" All right! That's more like it! Here's one you don't know. We used to sing it when you were little kids. "Jimmy crack corn And I don't care." "Swing low. "Sweet chariot. "Comin' for to carry me home "I looked over Jordan and what did I see? "Comin' for to carry me home" What smells in here, honey? Russ! Russ! Your feet. Isn't this the gas tank? Yes, I know, honey. Get in the car. I'm just fixing the license plate. Do you see that, kids? That's the St. Louis Arch. The Gateway to the West. It's over 600 feet tall, and there's an elevator all the way to the top. Dad, can we go up on it? No. Dad, what river is this? That's the Mississippi. The mighty Mississip. The old Miss. The old man. Clark, I think this is the wrong exit. What's the difference, as long as we get across the river? Clark? What are you doing? Just relax, Ellen. This is so dangerous! We have no business being in an area like this! This is a part of America we never get to see. That's good! No, that's bad. We can't close our eyes to the plight of the cities. Kids, are you noticing all this plight? This will just make us appreciate what we have. Roll them up! I'd better ask these fellows how to get back on the expressway. I wonder if you could tell me how to get back on the expressway? Fuck your mama! Thank you very much! Hey, excuse me? What it is, bro'! We're from out of town. No shit? Listen, I'd really appreciate it if you could give me directions back onto the expressway. What? For free? Sure. Five dollars. I'm not going to give you $5 for directions! I think that's fair, Clark. Okay. Here's $10. Keep the change. You see which way you're pointing? You see that place? Do you see the sign, "Rib Tips"? Well, fuck that, you don't want to go that way. I wonder if these guys know The Commodores. You go half a block down the street and you'll see a Torino with no wheels on it. Inside that Torino is my cousin, Jackie. Tell him that you're my boy, and that you're lost. He'll make sure you get where you're going. You don't want to know from me. I'm not from this neighborhood. I'm from the west side of Chicago, here on vacation. Thanks a lot. You've been a great help. "I'm Mister Blue "When you say you love me." Honey? Remember when we were in college and drove to Fort Lauderdale in my Austin Healy? I haven't thought about that for a long time. Remember what we did in the car? It's amazing we didn't get into an accident. Want to relive a fond memory? Are you serious? No! Why not? Because, that's why. The kids are asleep. Let's just wait until we get to a motel. Okay, we'll wait. I'll find the best one on the road. Do you want to put your head in my lap? It's not what I was thinking. Let me adjust the steering wheel. There you go, out of your way. Comfortable? Clark? My head's stuck. Quit kidding around! It hurts! I'm not. It's stuck. Cut it out! I know what you're trying to do, and I think it's sick! The wheel's stuck, honey! That was a dirty trick! The damn wheel is all screwed up. You're tired. You get weird when you get tired. Let's just find a motel. I don't want you dozing off. I'm not tired. Are you kidding? I can drive for another 100 miles. No problem. "I stay at home at night "By the phone at night "But you don't call "And I won't hurt my pride "Call me Mister Blue "I'm Mister Blue without you" Sparky, why don't you turn off the TV and come to bed? Okay, honey. Well, wake up everyone. We're here. Clark! Can I do your back, honey? I've done it already. Can I do your front? Go do your own front. We should call Catherine and Eddie and tell them that we won't be in until tomorrow afternoon. If we're not there by 10:00 a.m., we'll be completely off schedule. I planned very carefully so that we would be at Walley World early Saturday. Sparky, I know what this trip means to you and that you want all of us to have a great time, but it is a long way to Walley World. I think it would be easier on all of us if you would just try to relax. I'm way ahead of you, honey. When did you get these glasses? Oh, I have my little secrets. What a nice thought. Don't drink yet! Ready? I would like to propose a toast. To a very restful vacation. Here's to a very relaxing vacation. To a renewed love affair. To a time of joy with our kids. You know, I've never told you this. I know it's been a rough beginning. I think there's something wrong here! It's the bed. It will slow down in a second. I got it! Here, hold on to these. What are you doing? Let's try this, my darling. We haven't done this in a long time. Oh! Clark! What's that noise? What's going on? Don't you kids knock anymore? Sorry, we thought you were fighting. No one is fighting in here. It is very late. Where is Mom? I'm under here, kids. Go back to bed. Go back to bed now. The bed was very soft. Weirdo-rama! It's the same street Wyatt Earp kept law and order on. It seems kind of dirty and touristy. The Old West was dirty. Everything isn't like home. If it were, there would be no reason for leaving home, right, Rusty? Yeah, Dad. This is great. I'm glad we didn't go to Hawaii. I'll bet you are. Okay, let's go get a drink. Howdy, city slickers! Welcome! No fighting, cussing or gunslinging. Watch what you say to our bartender. He's ornery. Thank you, sheriff. Marshal. Give me five, partner! That guy was a crummy Wyatt Earp! He's wearing jogging shoes! Nah, they used to, Rusty. Hey, knucklehead! Set us up with four red-eyes, will you? Hey, yellow-belly! I'm talking to you! Hey, tenderfoot! Move your chicken wings, turkey! Clark! That's not nice! It's part of the act, honey. Hey, underpants! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm all right! That wasn't funny! A noise like that could impair the kids' hearing. It was real! It looked real, didn't it? I thought it was real gun. Didn't it look real when I fell down? What? Didn't it look real? What? Are you happy now, Clark? She's deaf. What's the difference? It was fun anyway. Let's have a drink. Pardon me, sir? Catherine told us to follow 50. I was thinking of taking a detour to Liberal. What for? The House of Mud. What's that? The largest, freestanding mud dwelling ever built! The pioneers didn't have bricks, so they used mud. They didn't use mud, they used sod! Right, Audrey. When they ran out of sod, they used mud! Let's skip The House of Mud. Dodge City was enough for today. And Catherine and Eddie are expecting us. It's living history. But, if you would rather visit your cousins it's okay with me. I would rather see a pile of mud than Eddie. Stop it! What's going on? Rusty is licking his hand and touching me with it! Tell Rusty to behave himself. Rusty, behave yourself! But Audrey is eating candy and smiling at me with her mouth open! Audrey, eat with you mouth closed! No eating in the car, kids! You suck, you know that? Retard! I am trying to concentrate on the road! "I've had some Ionely nights "And I'll admit I cried sometimes "Cause you were out of my life "But then you called my name "And you came back again "I feel so inspired "Kissing your lips of fire "Little boy sweet, little boy sweet, "Sweet little boy of mine "Come a little closer" You're driving 80 miles an hour! Doesn't seem that fast, honey? Slow down! I don't know why, we're making good time. "Love for sale "Appetizing, yummy love." They're here! Eddie, come on! I can't believe it's been so long! Eddie, you look terrific. Come and meet your cousins! Look how they've grown! You have lost weight, Catherine! She's added a few more mouths to the litter. Rusty and Audrey, cousins Vicki and Dale. And this is Eddie Junior and Junior. The little one hanging onto my skirt is Daisy-Mabel. How old are you, little one. She was born without a tongue, Clark. But don't worry about her. She whistles like a bird and eats like a horse. Take your cousins out back and show them your worm farm. Come in the house, Ellen. I've so much to tell you. Look at that car! That's the Family Truckster. Boy, she's a beaut! I like those "green walls." We had some trouble in St. Louis. Well, you're looking really fit. This is your homestead, huh? Yeah, I don't know for how long, though. The bank's been after me like flies on a rib roast. I know the feeling. Oh, fuck it! I bet you could use a cool one? Now you're talking. I'm going steady. And I French kiss. So? Everyone does that. Yeah, but Daddy says I'm the best. Want a worm? No, thanks. Do you have Pac-Man? No. Space Invaders? No. Do you have Asteroids? No, but my dad does. He can't even sit on the toilet some days. What do you do here, Dale? Well, I have a stack of nudie books this high. She's beautiful! Would you sell me any of them? Shit, no! I cherish them! And I use them a lot! How do you use a magazine? I'll tell you how. A guy taught me something really neat, last year. Have you ever bopped your bologna? I guess we are 11, right? No, we are 12 with Aunt Edna. Aunt Edna? Is she still alive? You bet! I can't wait to see the look on Clark's face when he hears that. She came to help when Eddie ruptured his spleen and she's been here ever since. She wanted to go back to Phoenix last year but Eddie wouldn't let her. Without her Social Security, we'd never be able to live like this. It looks as though you've really got your hands full. Oh, it's not so bad! Eddie says after the baby comes, I can quit one of my night jobs. How do you like yours, Clark? Oh, medium rare, a little pink inside. No! Your bun! Light or dark? Either way, it doesn't matter. Vicki, can I help you stir that? Please? I don't know why they call this Hamburger Helper! It's just fine by itself. I like it better than Tuna Helper, don't you, Clark? You're the gourmet, Ed. No meat in this? You get plenty of meat at home. Be polite. Have some ketchup. Real tomato ketchup, Eddie? Nothing but the best! Aunt Edna! Helper's getting cold. Is that your Aunt Edna? Aunt Edna! After all these years! And you look so good! Hi, Edna! Nice to see you again! You remember Clark, don't you? You were the ones who sent me the fruitcake for Christmas. It made me so sick! I'm sorry. We thought you enjoyed fruitcake. Do you enjoy throwing up every five minutes, Claud? Clark. Well, am I going to eat or starve to death? Catherine? Did you tell Clark and Ellen the good news. No. I was just about to. What's the good news? You are driving me to Phoenix! "Junior Pig Competition"? You won this trophy for racing a pig? Yeah. First Place. Does anyone know about it? Everyone knows. Vicki, don't be offended, but being a farmer is not too cool, you know. Oh, yeah. How cool is this? I'm really glad things are going well for you. I was laid off when they closed that asbestos factory. The Army cuts my disability pension. They claimed the plate in my head wasn't large enough. Clark and Ellen don't want to hear about problems. No, no. It is very interesting. Why don't you just ask him for the money, Eddie? He sure as hell can't take a hint! Well, I didn't want to ask you, Clark. Could you, maybe, spare a little extra cash? Sure, Eddie! How much money do you need? About $52,000. Good-bye, baby! You'll send those checks? It's taken care of. Okay, let's go. Come on, Edna. Lay off, lay off! Well, gotta be going. What's this? This is for you, Clark. Oh, what is it? A gift. You didn't have to buy me a gift! Go on and open it. Eddie, you shouldn't have. Those are great, Dad! Be quiet, Russ. Try them on. No, no, I don't want to get them dirty. I told you he wouldn't like them! I love them. I knew you did because the last time I saw you, Clark you remarked about how much you liked mine. I guess we better be going. Here he is, Uncle Clark, all walked and everything. What is this? A dog? He's Aunt Edna's dog, Dinky. He watches "Family Feud." How are you, little fellow? You didn't get to meet Dinky last night. He had the shits, so he slept in the barn. Great. I'll make some space for him in the back. No! Sit, sit! Roll over! Heel! Here. Have a good trip. Thanks a lot. "I found out long ago "It's a long way down a Holiday Road [Skipped item nr. 548] "Holiday Road! "Holiday Road! " Look at these sandwiches. Here, Aunt Edna. Thank you. Rusty, stop playing with the dog and come and eat your lunch. You're favorite, bologna and cheese. "I've had some Ionely nights "And I'll admit I cried sometimes "Cause you were out of my life "But then you called my name "And you came back again "I feel so inspired "Kissing your lips of fire "Little boy sweet, little boy sweet "Sweet little boy of mine "Come a little closer "I want to show you "What's on my mind "Here in the night, here in the night "Here in the night, together "I want to show you "Love so. warm and tender!" Mom, my sandwich is wet! They're all wet. The dog went on the picnic basket! "Jack be nimble, Jack be quick "Going to take a ride to the West Coast, kids "Holiday Road! "Holiday Road! "Holiday Road! "Holiday Road! " Russ, look! Excellent! They have a pool! Aren't the woods beautiful? Clark! Dinky needs a long walk and a bath. Rusty, take care of Dinky. Dad, he bites! Bite him back! We would like three tents, please. All right. That'll be $37. $37 for three tents?! They're very nice tents. The price includes scenery and wildlife fun. This seems like a nice place, and it has a pool. All right. Would you fill that out? Clark W. Griswold. Do you want my address? Please. What do you need my address for? We like to send out mailers. - I can't wait to get in! - Me, too. Let's go get our bathing suits. Disgusting! You're too cheap to pay for a hotel room. Oh, Clark, this tent smells. Edna, this is your tent. This isn't very romantic. I don't think there's enough room for two in this sleeping bag. Right now, we're one. One heart beating for two. Sparky, there's a wild animal. Yes. I know, I'm going for it, honey. Get off! Down! Go! I'm sorry, honey. It's Dinky. I'll kill that dog! What do you say, honey? In spite of the problems, it's fun isn't it? No! But with each new day there's new hope. Kids, let's go! We're losing daylight. Did you walk him? He took a big one on Aunt Edna's blanket. Good boy. Help! Go take care of Aunt Edna. I'll take the leash. Roll over, Dinky! You're tearing my flesh! Good morning, Edna. Audrey, you're next. No way, Jos√©! What's the problem? I had to sit next to Aunt Edna last time. She smells like mothballs! It's her turn. For your information, Rusty slept in his underpants last night! Easy kids! Stop it! Everyone into the car, we leave in two minutes. Or perhaps you don't want to see the second-largest ball of twine on earth. Which is only four short hours away. Sweetheart, do you hear that rattle? Where is it coming from? Beats the heck out of me. I've been looking for it since we left. It's driving me crazy! Dad, look behind you. Now what have we done? Will you hold my purse? Just hold my purse! Hello, officer, what's the problem? Get out of the car! I don't think I was speeding. Was I weaving or something? Shut up, sir! If I wasn't in uniform, I'd split your skull with the butt of this revolver faster than you could say, "police brutality." Officer, whatever it is I've done, I'm sure I can explain. Explain this, you son of a bitch. Oh, my God! Do you know what the penalty for animal cruelty is in this state? No, sir. It's probably pretty stiff! You can't think I'd do this on purpose? I tied him to the rear bumper when I was packing the car. It was very confusing, I must've forgotten. I'm sorry. I feel terrible. How do you think that little dog feels? I'm sorry, it really was an accident. I guess I can buy that, sir. But it is a shame. I had a dog like that when I was a kid. Poor little guy. He probably kept up with you for a mile or so. Tough little mutt. I was afraid you would get pulled over, Clark. You've been exceeding the speed limit for thousands of miles! Dad wasn't speeding. The officer stopped us because Dad. He was speeding, Rusty! No, he wasn't, Mom. Listen to your mother! I was speeding. I was driving like a maniac. We can all be grateful that this man stopped us! - You see, kids, a car. - Here's the leash, sir. I'm going back to get the rest of the carcass off the road. Thank you, officer. Have a nice day. Is this your idea of a good restaurant? Dog killer! I'm sure the food is just fine. I'll take that. Thank you. Oh, kids! Waitress! "I've had some Ionely nights "And I'll admit I cried sometimes "Cause you were out of my life "But then you called my name "And you came back again "I feel so inspired "Kissing your lips of fire "Little boy sweet, little boy sweet "Sweet little boy of mine" What happened? What happened to your hair? You're sweating! Are you blushing? Don't be silly. Are you all right, Clark? Of course, I'm fine! I'm having a ball! Come on, honey, look at the mountains, breathe the air! Put on a happy face for me. I guess there's not much more that can happen to us. I think the worst is behind us. Clark, I need my vanity case. We have to go back and look for it. All my credit cards are in it. Honey, number one: I've already called the bank and reported the loss. B: We'll never find it when we don't know where it fell off. And three: I've got my credit cards. And we've still got plenty of cash, okay? No, we don't. You gave $500 to Eddie. And everything has cost twice as much as you figured out. Honey, there's nothing in that luggage that can't be replaced. Except for your diaphragm. We can cash a check down the road. Don't you trust me? As long as you don't tie me to the rear bumper. That hurt. Clark, I think we're lost. We're not lost! Ellen, please, let me do the driving. I don't think you'll find the Grand Canyon on this road. Jesus, it's only the biggest goddamn hole in the world! Clark, watch your language! Make that the second largest. Dad, I haven't seen a car for an hour! Shut up, Audrey! Dad knows where he's going. Thank you. You're lost! Ma, I saw some detour signs! I didn't see any. I saw them when you and Mom were trying to fold the map. When they close a road they put up big signs. Like this one. I think I broke my nose! I stabbed my brain. I just got my period. I'm going to check under the hood. Audrey, gather up all the clothes, and put them in a pile. Rusty, find the first aid kit, then bring the suitcases here. Where can I go to the bathroom? Find a bush, Audrey! Dad, you must've jumped the car about 50 yards! It's nothing to be proud of, Rusty. Fifty yards. Ellen, get me out of here! Stay in the car! It's hot and dangerous out here! Don't you tell me what to do! I'll do what I want! I should never have come on this trip with you! I should have taken an airplane! And he, he shouldn't even have a license to drive an automobile. He should be behind bars! Sit down, and shut up! Move out of that seat, and I'll split your lip! Rusty, come up here! I am going to have to hike down the road to find a service station. I want you to stay here and take care of things. Will you be okay? Oh, sure. I haven't had a chance to talk to you, man to man. I've only been a man a few days, Dad. You're growing up so fast. I have spent the past 15 years developing newer and better food additives. I guess I missed a lot. At first, I didn't want to take this vacation. Now I'm glad I did. It has given me a chance to spend more time with you and. Audrey. Audrey. Yeah. It's been fun for me, too, Dad. Except for Aunt Edna. She doesn't mean to be a pain in the rump. It's just the way she is. Let's not let it spoil our fun, okay? I won't. Maybe she would be nicer if she had a family of her own. Instead of always having to latch onto someone else's. You're a pretty bright little guy. Excuse me. man. It's okay. Do you know what I want to do? When I was your age, my dad shared a beer with me. And I thought it was the best thing ever. When I was a boy, just about every summer we'd take a vacation. In 18 years, we never had fun. Now I have my own family. And we're on our own vacation. You know what? What, Dad? We're going to have fun. We're going to have fun. Don't let your mother smell that beer on your breath. She'll take it out on me. I better get moving if I want to get us out of here by dark. Good talk, son. Good talk, Dad. Clark? I just had a good talk with Rusty. You'll be in good hands here, honey. Where are you going?! There must be a phone or a gas station around here, honey. All right, but if you're not back in an hour. I'll be fine. You'll be fine. I'm sure this happens all the time. A patrol car will be by any minute. "Over the river and through the woods "To Grandmother's house we go "A thousand bottles of beer on the wall "Four bottles of beer "If one of those bottles should happen to fall. "I love a parade "The trampling of feet, I love the beat I hear of a drum "I love a parade" We pass a goddamn gas station every 100 yards for 1,000 miles! But when you really need one, you end up walking your ass off. This is no way to run a desert! Jesus! I'm going to die! What an asshole! Taxi. Taxi! I'm dead. I'm dying. I'm dead. I'm finished. Hot! Hot! I'm not sure of his exact height and weight. All I know is the man was a saint with children and a genius with food additives and. Clark! Ellen! Russ! Audrey? Audrey! Are you all right? I'm fine! What happened to you? How did you get here? Well these two nice Indians and a man on a camel called a tow truck. Daddy's back! Kids, are you thirsty? - Yeah, I bet you are too! - You said it! What do I owe you? I never heard of no one so stupid as you driving off that road. You must have manure for brains. Yes, well, I'm from out of town. What's the bill? Come on. How much? How much do you have? No, I'm asking how much the repairs are. I'm asking you, how much do you have. You're crazy. I don't have time to play around. How much is it? All of it, boy. What does your sheriff think of your business practices? Audrey, how much baby-sitting money do you have? How come? How much? What's the matter? I just spent $500 on four bald tires and a tow! How much do you have? $35. She has $40, Dad. How would you know? Unless you went in my purse, you rotten sneak. Have you been going through her private property? I don't give a frog's fat ass who went through what. We need money! Edna, how much do you have? She's asleep, Clark! Russ, do you want to look through Edna's purse? Clark! Unzip it. She has 11 cents, Dad. Terrific. The motel will cash your check. They better. We're going to run out of gas. I'm sorry, sir. I can't accept this credit card. Why not? The computer says it's has been reported lost. My wife lost her credit cards in Colorado and I reported it. The computer is probably reporting that I lost mine also, which I haven't. Well, you'll have to straighten that out with your bank. Will you accept a personal check? For what amount? $300. I can't do that, sir. Look, I've lost all my cash and we're on our way to California. Walley World? Yeah! Walley World! And I'm sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place. You know I'd really appreciate it. We require a major credit card. I have $6.13 to my name so I can see we're going to have to work something out. I've already told you that I can't accept a check without a major credit card. I'll give you a check for $1,000. All you have to give me is $300 in cash. You can then keep $700 for doing nothing more than acting like a total creep. The only thing I can do is have you stay here until the check clears. Ten working days! Let's go, come on! Where is Edna? In the car! Good! Come on, get in the car. Don't you want to look at the Grand Canyon? Great, let's go. Rusty, wake up! Get out those sandwiches I got at the gas station. I'm so hungry, I could eat a sandwich from a gas station. There's one for everyone. Audrey, wake Aunt Edna. It's time for her to eat and take her pill. Please, get off of me! Mom, tell Audrey to stop pushing Aunt Edna on me. I'm sick of her lying on me all the time! Be quiet! Auntie? Honey, it's only a few hours to Phoenix! Let her be, she's fine! She's not fine! She's fine! Don't be silly! She's not fine, Clark! She's dead! She breathed on me! A dead person breathed on me! Her hand touched me! She's stiff already! Goddamn it, anyway! She must have passed away somewhere near Flagstaff. What are we going to do, Clark? Well, we could leave her here and the first phone we pass, we'd call your cousin, Normie and he can come and get her, I guess. That's the meanest, coldest. What do you want me to do, call Federal Express? Mom, we don't have to ride with a dead person, do we? Please say we don't! Come on, Mom. It'd be real easy for Cousin Normie to find her. All he'd have to do is look for the buzzards. Hell! Then we'll drive her to Cousin Normie's. I just didn't want to get caught up in a funeral, inquests and all that crap. You're the most self-centered, egotistical, manipulative. Don't say anything you'll regret, Ellen! I'm being practical. If we drove straight through we'd have three days at Walley World at best. Three. She can't weight more than 100 pounds. Oh, no! You can't put her up on that roof! Yes, he can! Do you want me to strap her to the hood? What's the difference? She'll be fine. It's not as if it's going to rain or something. This is terrible! What a nightmare! Don't just blurt it out about Edna dying! How about if I ask him to play a guessing game? Oh, no, he isn't even home. Maybe the neighbors know where he is. The moron knows we're coming, and he isn't home. Normie's always been flighty. He's always been a jag-off. Will you watch your mouth? There's a note. "Have gone to Flagstaff. Be back on Monday." What a worm! It's locked! Okay, let's go! We can't leave her on the patio! Would you rather I slipped her in the night deposit box at the funeral home?! Come on! It's raining all over her! She can't catch a cold now, Mom! Clark? We have to at least say something. Okay, bow your heads, bow your heads. Oh, God. Ease our suffering in this, our moment of great despair! Admit this good and decent woman into Thine arms and the flock in Thine heavenly area up there. And Moab he laideth down behind the land of the Canaanites. And, yea, though the Hindus speak of karma. Clark! I implore you, give her a break. Clark! Clark, this is a serious matter! I'll do it myself! Honey, I'm not an ordained minister! I'm doing my best, okay? Lord, we love this woman with all our hearts! Let's not overdo it, Mom! Shut up! We know she deserves better than this but my husband wants his beloved family to get to Walley World to have their vacation! I hope you understand! Have mercy on his soul! Amen! Let's go! I hope you children have learned something about life and death! Yeah! Don't die unless someone is home! I think Normie will understand when he sees the note we pinned on Edna's sleeve. Sure! You left his dead mother tied to a lawn chair in his backyard! I'm sure he won't mind! It's all over and done with! We'll find a motel and start fresh in the morning. I don't want to be in the car anymore. I want to go home! I don't want to go to Walley World! Clark? Under the circumstances, I would rather we just go home. In retrospect, driving across country, has been one disaster after another! Yeah, it's been a real drag, Dad! Maybe we can try it some other time. Walley World's overrated anyway. What do you think? I think you're all fucked in the head. We're ten hours from the fucking fun park and you want to bail out. Well, I'll tell you something. This is no longer a vacation! It's a quest! It's a quest for fun. I'm going to have fun and you're going to have fun. We're all going to have so much fucking fun we'll need plastic surgery to remove our goddamn smiles. You'll be whistling zippity-doo-dah out of your assholes! I have to be crazy. I'm on a pilgrimage to see a moose. Praise Marty Moose! Holy shit! Dad, do you want an aspirin or something? Don't touch! The next time you have one of your outbursts I'd appreciate it if you'd have some consideration for your kids. What are you talking about? You don't know? All I know is I'm trying to treat my family to a little fun! Spare me, Clark! I know your brand of family fun. Tomorrow you'll probably kill the desk clerk hold up a McDonald's, and drive us a thousand miles out of the way to see the world's largest ball of mud! You know what your problem is? You have an uncanny knack for looking at the dark side of things. That's your problem. You wouldn't know a good time if it came up and bit you! Where are you going? What do you care? Are you waiting for someone? No! Do you mind if I sit down? Fancy seeing you here. Having a nice little family vacation? It would appear so, wouldn't it? No, the truth of it is, and this is highly confidential I own this motel. I own the whole chain, nationwide. Twenty-two hundred units. Yeah, once a year, I travel across the country, incognito. Check things out, and see how the operation is running. I thought you were going to say you worked for the CIA. That's an old bit, isn't it? Really. No, I'm not with the CIA. I was, but that was a long time ago. I don't like to talk about it. No, I'm mainly interested in my motels now. And my airline. That's great. I'm just trying to have a little fun. It's a shame you're married. I'm in the mood for some fun. Married? You mean those people I'm with? That's my brother's family. My brother's ring. I usually borrow them on these little inspection tours of mine. It helps to complete the disguise. It's fun for them. It's a good disguise. I like the station wagon effect. Yeah? Well, that's a big part of it. In order to be convincing, you have to look and act like an ordinary jerk. You know, stop at all the stupid sites and look like a fool. Basically, be yourself? Yeah! You like the disguise? My credo is, if you have to have a credo you know, "Go for it," pretty much. You only go around this crazy merry-go-round once! You know? I agree. Yeah. That's my credo! You don't have to have a credo, but. "If the shoe fits, wear it." "A penny saved." "Pennies from heaven." My favorite credo you know "A penny saved, and." Thank you. This feels great! Well are you going to go for it? Uh. here? To start with, yes. Why not? Don't you swim? Sure, I took third in the state finals in my senior year. Yeah, I'm really at ease in the water. I'm proficient in many strokes and I dive. As a matter of fact, I could've been in the Olympics. Yeah. I'll be right there. Yeah. This is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazy! How's the water? Exhilarating! I'm in deep, I'm in deep! It's cold! Jesus! Fuck! Clark? Cold! Clark.? Hi, honey. What are you doing? Swimming! Yeah, my back was killing me. And I thought I'd get a swim and loosen up the muscles. Why go to the car and get the bathing suit? Jump right in. It's exhilarating. Guess what, honey? This person here was here! I didn't see this person, so I screamed, that's why I yelled. I was so surprised. You can imagine, can't you, honey? Honey?! Will you excuse me? You have to go. Well, I'd stay if I weren't married, but I am. I know. I hope I didn't spoil your evening. No, it's been interesting. Well, enjoy the rest of your trip. You, too. I can't believe this. I am so humiliated. Cut it out. You don't even know how to inhale. So?! Maybe I don't want to. You're such a dork. How can he do this to Mom? They'll probably get a divorce. I better have a talk with him. What are you doing up? You woke the whole motel up, Dad. I was swimming. Yeah, I saw you. Russ, come here a minute. You know I wouldn't do anything to hurt your Mom. It's been a long drive. I work very hard for you, Audrey and your mom. I guess when you get older you get these feelings and these feelings make you do things you wouldn't normally do. Like swimming naked with girls? Yeah! Like swimming naked with girls. Well, not with girls. You think I was swimming with girls? I saw just one girl. Who, that girl? Oh, no, that's a waitress. No, I was just ordering in. She's a pool waitress. I was ordering some fish for you, Audrey and Mom. She took your order? She took my order, yeah. Swimming waitress. You understand, don't you, Russ? Sure, I understand. Do you think Mom will buy it? Good talk, son. Go to bed, Russ. Goodnight. Ellen? Ellen? Honey? Are you mad? No. Do you like that girl? Is that what you want? Oh, no. How could I like a girl like that? She's ugly. I love you. I'm sorry about everything. I got angry because you were right and I knew it. I was hurt, honey. I'm sorry, too. It's not all your fault. I know you've been trying. I'm going to try, too. I know how to have fun. And I'm going to prove it. Come on. Come on! Come on! Honey, you don't have to prove anything to me. I want us to have some fun together. - Come on! - The water's very. We must be getting close. We're almost there. Everybody just take it easy. I know we're getting close. What is that? What is that? There it is! Walley World, next three exits! We made it dammit! We made it! The Griswolds are one hell of a family, huh? Don't get too much sun, now. It's beautiful! It's just beautiful! Oh, darling! - We made it! - You did it, Clark. Sparky. We're the first ones here! We're the first ones here! But we're so far away, Clark. And, at the end of the day, when the lot's all full and everybody's fighting to get out of here we'll be the first ones to get out, too! Why? Because we're the Griswolds! Come on, I'll race you! Sorry, folks. We're closed for 2 weeks to clean and repair America's favorite family fun park! Clark! What are you doing? We watch his program. We buy his toys. We go to his movies! He owes us! Doesn't he owe us, huh? He owes the Griswolds, right?! Fucking right, he owes us! Clark, you're scaring me! Don't be scared! I just think someone owes us an explanation, that's all! Come on. Clark, now just a minute! Honey, will you check the mileage, please? Where are you going? I'll be right back. I'm just going to get some sporting goods. Clark, will you listen to me? Let's just find a hotel. I'll have my parents wire us money. We'll fly home and forget this vacation ever happened. Relax. I told you I'm not angry anymore, I'm in complete control. They can't be repairing every ride at the same time! I think they owe us an explanation and a little fun. Whatever happens, just trust me. Will you just trust me? Sorry folks, the park's closed. The moose outside should have told you. Yes, we're here to see Mr. Roy Walley. What is your name, sir? Clark W. Griswold. What is this regarding, Mr. Griswold? It's a public. business. summer inspection. Personal matter. Well, nobody notified this office of anything! Well, I'm notifying you. I'll need more than that, sir. Have you lost your mind? Where did you get that? At the sporting goods store. You listen to me, fat ass. You do what I say and there won't be any problems, okay? We drove 2,460 miles, just for a little Roy Walley entertainment. The Moose says you're closed. I say you're open. We're not really violent people. This is our first gun. No, it isn't. What's going on here? You! Freeze! Freeze! Sit! Sit! Lie down! Let's go, lie down! Roll over! Stay! Okay! Let's ride! Let's ride! Come on! Stay! This is scary isn't it? You boys and girls make sure you keep your hands on the handlebars at all times. We don't want any accidents! Is that a real gun, Mom? I don't know. But when this is all over your father may be going away for a little while. Boy, I sure am bushed! Have you had enough yet, sir? What do you mean "bushed"? Where are the big rides? The big ones? Let's go. Get in the front. Come on. Has your father ever killed anyone before? Just a dog. Oh, and my Aunt Edna. Hey! You can't prove that, Rusty. Rusty? May I call you Rusty? I had a bad experience on this ride once before. What happened? I threw up. Now, don't do that again! Goodie, goodie, goodie! The Loop-D-Loop! Come on, get in there. Let's go, huh, kids? Please, don't push! Come on, Audrey. Isn't this fun, honey? That's not a real gun, is it, Clark? What? Are you kidding?! This is a Magnum P.I.! It's a BB-gun! Don't try me. I could put your eye out with this. You couldn't even break skin with that. It could! It could break the skin. It could put a lodge under the skin and cause a bad infection. That's an old wives' tale, Clark! I'm telling. See, I told you! I warned you! If you wrecked the pants, you'll pay for them! Yeah, I'll pay for 'em. Freeze! Don't shoot! Hands behind your heads! Spread your legs! Move up against the wall! You two, over there! It's just a BB-gun! You are all under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Watch your hands, mister! How many are there? A lot of them? Whatever they want. We'll pay 'em! We'll pay 'em! Tell me, what is going on? Everything's under control, sir. They are terrorists! Where? Them? He treated me like a dog! He humiliated me! What did he do with your dog? He kidnapped me, Mr. Wally, but I gotta tell you I had a great time on your rides. It was the most fantastic experience I've ever had! I like the part where you go really way up high. I'm glad you liked it. Now, what's happening? That is Roy Walley, honey! I'm Russ Lasky. I met you at the summer picnic last year. I don't remember. They kidnapped one of my men. I was the one who got sick. Anyway Mr. Wally, I went on all the rides I didn't get sick this time. Normally I get sick on all your rides. Quiet! Mr. Walley. Roy? I think I can make some sense out of this. Well, someone had better explain! Or there will be a lot of explaining to do! I'm Clark W. Griswold. This is my wife, Ellen. Hi. We're big fans of yours. We watch your show all the time. These are my children, Audrey and Rusty. Nice family. We're from Chicago, Roy. "The Windy City." I've been there many times. We just spent two weeks of living hell, driving out here. We lost a dear member of the family on the way. But, the important thing, Roy, is that we could have gone anywhere we wanted to this summer. Anywhere in the world. But when I asked my kids. Kids, remember when I asked you where you wanted to go on vacation? What did you say? Hawaii? Shut up, Russ. Audrey, you remember? Walley World, Dad? "Walley World, Dad! " Roy Walley World. Do you have any children, Mr. Walley? Are you kidding? I have seven. I thought so. Seven, did you hear that, honey? You look so young! Did you ever drive them across country? I took the whole clan to Florida one year. The worst two weeks I ever had in my life. The smell from the backseat was too unbearable. I know that smell. Imagine how your kids would have felt if Florida had been closed. They don't close Florida. I know they don't close the state of Florida. When we got here, to Roy Walley World and it was closed down. If you had seen the look on my kids faces. I guess I went a little haywire. You went a lot haywire, if you ask me! I'm very sorry, sir. I'm sorry to all these people. I didn't mean any harm. I want you to ask yourself one thing. If you were me wouldn't you have done the same thing for your children? No. Mr. Walley, do you want me to take them downtown and book them? No. no. Forget it, officer. I'm not going to press any charges. What did I tell ya? Did I say trust me? "Girl, I love." No. "Girl, I love your." No, that ain't it. "Girl, I love your style. "I love when you get that smile. "You should be in a magazine, because you're a queen. "Our love is everything." - Percy? - Not right now. I'm busy. You got a girl in there? What kind of question is that, "You got a woman in here?" I didn't know. I heard you talking. - I'm in here doing my vows. - Vows? For this ridiculous party my wife is losing her mind over! This extravaganza is costing a lot of money. Now she wants us to renew our vows. What was wrong with what I said the first time? - What's wrong with "I do"? I did, didn't I? - Yes, you did. - Women, boy. - I know. Women, it's just a whole other. You know what? I think it's cool you're just doing the lyrics from that song. I wrote this on the way to work this morning. - You wrote that on the way to work? - Yeah. Were you listening to the radio when you wrote it? 'Cause I think it's B2K. Okay, then. If this is to a song, tell me what the next line is. Baby, turn around And let me see that sexy body go bump, bump, bump That's it. Go. Reggie. See your sexy smile and bump, bump? - Three bumps. - Three bumps. See your sexy smile and you bump, bump See your sexy smile and you Hey, boss. Did I hear Theresa's bringing a new boyfriend to your anniversary party? Yes. What? I'm fine with it. - So, you met him? - Nope. I pulled his credit report. - You didn't. - I sure as hell did. Fred, this young brother is a stockbroker for J.P. Oliver. - Theresa? I don't believe it. - Marilyn said she's crazy about him. And this boy's credit report, I'm telling you, is a thing of beauty. I almost cried. Wow, this guy sounds too good to be true. He probably is. But the brother has a job. - I'm glad you think that way. - That's right, my friend. A J-O-B! .but I quit. - I quit! - Simon, calm down. I'm just trying to explain to you how the world works. It's the clients, I'm just explaining. None of my clients seem to care. This guy didn't seem to care, did he? Come on. Don't be so sensitive. That's not how the world works. It's how your world works. Simon, sit down. Simon! Jerk. I don't need you, Nathan! I don't need J.P. Oliver. My r√©sum√© is good enough. I can get a job anywhere I want. I'm out of here. I'm not going to freak out! What am I going to tell Theresa? What am I going to tell her? "Baby, you know how you're always saying I'm at the office too much? "Well, great news!" I'll meet my future father-in-law and tell him I'm unemployed. That'll be great. Okay. I'll get the next one. I can't quit my job! I'm not gonna beg for this job! - I got $20 says he goes up again. - I'll take some of that. Oh, my God! I just quit my job! I don't need this job! No. Here he comes. - Hi. - Have a good one. Hello, Liz. Simon Green here. Simon! What's up? Every investment I've made in the last six months. Listen. That job you offered me. Tell me it's still open. Why? What happened? I'll tell you about it later. Can you talk to Bartlett for me? Are you kidding? I'm e-mailing him right now. When he finds out you asked about this. he will go nuts! Liz, thank you. Theresa? Baby? You're home early. Really early. Hi. - Got out of there quick. - Good. Then come on, help me with these. What have we got? Tumi. - That's nice. When did we get this? - Got them today. Combined incomes. Bling bling, baby! Yeah. Bling bling. Baby? God. You should have heard Dad's voice on the phone. when I told him you work for J.P. Oliver. I feel like he's more in love with you than I am. - Really? - Yeah. You don't understand. Ever since I can remember, his whole thing has been about: "Theresa, does that boy have a job?" - It's a good thing I do then, huh? - I know. I'm so excited! Aren't you excited? Theresa, a man is never excited about meeting his future father-in-law. You know, I was thinking. Maybe we should postpone telling them. What? - It was your idea. - I know. But I'm thinking now that maybe it was a bad idea. No, I think it's a great idea. Announcing our engagement at my parents' party. is gonna be the best present we can give them. Babe, Mom's gonna flip. See, I'm not worried about your mom. I was thinking about. him. See, he's about ready to pop a blood vessel. in his head, because you guys are losing a basketball game. No, we were winning that game. Yeah. We're bringing in a canopy here. Swags of tulle with festoons. Sprays of roses. Parquet dance floor here. Guests will be seated at tables in Chiavari chairs. Very clean, very simple, very elegant. And rose petals on the lawn. And not just a few. oodles. At my wedding, we had oodles of petals. It was fabulous. At that wedding, was a woman involved? Of course it involved a woman. If she's not a woman, it's gonna be a surprise to both of us. Hello! - Look. - I'll tell you, this is going to be some party. Twenty-five years of marriage. - More power to you, pal. - Thank you. - Hey, baby. - Sorry I'm late. My vice principal called in sick today. so it was just me against 208 middle-schoolers. I swear half of them ate pure sugar for breakfast. Hi, Dante. - So, Percy, which one do you like best? - I like that. Is your name Percy? Which one costs the most? - They cost the same. - They don't cost the same. This one's from Saks. This one's from Macy's. Saks! Thank you. And now I can give my honest opinion. - I'm digging that one, baby. - Really? Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm wearing this one. Hallelujah. Sweetheart. - Yeah? - Listen. Why do you even bother asking me? 'Cause it's a big day for us and I wanted you to feel included. Why couldn't you include Martha Superfreak out there? Dante is a nice man. A nice man. A nice man that part of the time likes to sleep with other nice men. Will you stop it? Would you open your mind, Percy Jones? Dante is a metrosexual. - A what? - He's a straight man with taste. No such thing. You might as well tell me he rode over here on a unicorn. Look, serious face, serious moment. I need to talk to you. I know, baby. I'm working on my vows. Almost got them perfect. - That's sweet, but that's not it. - What is it? This boy that Theresa's bringing home? I don't know who his people are, where he's from. I don't know anything about him. But what I do know is that I need you to be nice. I'm always nice. Let's be nice long enough to find out who the boy is. I already know who he is. - You pulled his credit report? - I did not. You pulled his credit report, Percy? I mean, I glanced at it. But a credit report don't tell you the character of a man. But being a loan officer for 22 years. I can size that boy up in an instant. And you know I got a knack for it. You know that. Five seconds. That's all I need. That's all I need. - Nobody knows that better than me. - Say what? I didn't stutter. I'm not so good with dads, baby. I'm good with moms. I'm better with moms. He's a big guy, right? Scary big. He also has these. piercing eyes that just burn right into your soul. Don't maintain eye contact for a long period of time. At least today, okay? Babe, I'm kidding. Just relax. It's gonna be fun. Okay? - Did you tell them? - What? Tell them what? - Babe, don't. The. - What? - Did you. I'm. - Cute? Clean-shaven? What? Pigment-challenged? Did you tell them that I'm white? You're white? You're white? Stop the car! Oh, my God! Look at what you. Oh, my God. Simon, I'm so sorry. - It was a joke, sir. I was kidding. - Yeah, sister. You're funny. Simon, are you okay? - Who are you? - Are you serious? Why am I in Jersey? - Don't worry. It's gonna be great, okay? - All right. I'm very sorry. It was a bad joke. - So, did you tell them? - No. I only told them the important things. That I love you. That you're an amazing man. That you have a very cute birthmark on your left butt cheek. You just didn't feel the need to mention it's a Caucasian butt cheek. That was. Simon, look. I didn't mention it because I don't think it's gonna matter. It's gonna matter. We're fine, sir. Dad! Look at this here. Oh, my God. Give your daddy a hug. How are you? Mom! - Hey, my man. Percy Jones, baby. - Pleasure to meet you. Man, look at this here. I like this, man. Nice, solid, strong grip. Wow. That's something else. Listen. You doing everything you can to make my daughter happy? - No, Dad, it's. - Hey, sweetheart. You can take that to the front door for me. - Thank you. - No, you see, this. Don't interrupt. I'm giving your friend a once-over here. Sir? Don't stand like a statue. Take it to the front door. That's that square with the hole. Look inside, you see furniture. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. You doing everything in your power to make her happy? I'm not sure if I am, but I'd sure like a crack at it. - Boy, I ought to drill you, man. I like him. - Okay, all right, listen. Young man, don't worry about it. Relax. I figure, what, $30? Get yourself some candy or something. Dad, this is Simon. Simon? - That's her boyfriend's name. - That's right. - Well, who are you? - Wesley Thompson. That's my cab. But if you're still down with me making your girl happy. I'm good to go. - Why don't you just go? - Just. I wish Theresa would have told me you guys were black. That would have saved an awkward moment. - Kind of like this one. - Yeah. - Welcome home, sweetheart. - Thanks, Mom. - Baby, let me get that. - I got it. Lemonade. Damn! Ain't no need, us standing out here. Why don't we go on inside and talk? Come on, we going on inside with a quickness. No use standing out here. Just come on. That boy's white. Nothing gets past you. I guess it's those 22 years as a loan officer. - You knew about this. - I didn't know a thing, I promise you. But I did figure it out after the second "Daddy!" Why she just didn't say nothing? Give us a warning, you know? We taught our girls to see only people, not color. - I know that but. - So, what's the problem? I guess the problem is she just didn't tell us. I'm expecting Denzel Washington to come walking through the door. and I get Whitey McWhiteman instead. - Hi, you guys. - Hi! I'm just showing Simon the house. You've a very beautiful home, Mrs. Jones. - Why, thank you. You can call me Marilyn. - Will do. You, too, Mr. Jones. Thank you. You can call me Mr. Jones. I'm just kidding. You got me. That was funny. I'm making lemonade. You want to sit down? - Yes, thank you. Sit down, babe. - Great. So, Simon, they tell me you work at J.P. Oliver? Yes, sir. - You like it there? You been there long? - Well, it's a couple of years, I suppose. - You moving up? - There's been some recent movement, yes. - You a hard worker? You work hard? - The hardest. - J.P. Oliver has a huge IPO coming up. - He doesn't want to hear about this. But he's asking you about your work. - I know, but you go into details. - He likes to be modest. Shut up. Anyway, they made Simon their IPO. Wait, what is it? Point man? And they're flying him to San Francisco on Monday. I'm not going to see him for three days. - So, Simon, what do your parents do? - Yeah. - My mother is a realtor. - Mom, let me help you with that. And she sells mini-blinds and teaches dance. Damn. How many jobs your mama got? She's a single parent. She's always been a hard worker. What happened to your father? He left when I was two and I haven't seen much of him since. - I'm sorry to hear that. - It happens. You play any sports? I played some foosball in college. - That's the table with the soccer guys. - I know what foosball is. - Stupid joke. - It's not a sport. Dad, stop badgering him. I'm not badgering him. I'm just taking an interest. I don't understand why you don't play sports? It don't make sense. A man who don't play sports isn't a real man, as far as I'm concerned. - I used to run a little. - What? Like track? I mean, you don't look like a sprinter. - What'd you run? Did you steeplechase? - Dad! Come on, man. What was your race? - Cars. - Cars. - NASCAR. - NASCAR! That was the one. I had some hopes and some dreams and. it all ended on a hot August day on a speedway in Charlotte. It was a crash. Just. They said I should've been killed. Actually, I got out without a scratch. I figured that was a sign. NASCAR? Mostly I just worked in the pit. I mean, I test drove for one of the drivers some, but. What was his name? Jay Gordon. You drove for Jeff Gordon? We called him Jay or J.G. It was like a pet name. A pit name, actually. NASCAR? I believe I said I don't like to talk about that time in my life. NASCAR? What was I supposed to do? He was staring at me with those piercing eyes. - He was not. - It was like. filled with piercing disappointment 'cause I don't play sports? "A man who don't play sports isn't really a man now, is he?" I had to give him something! He's big. He's like. You said he was big, but he's big-big. But why did you lie about NASCAR? My father loves NASCAR. It's NASCAR, baby. That's, like, the whitest sport on the planet. Not anymore, Simon. There's, like, NASCAR and hockey. Hockey. I should have went with hockey. Don't worry. He'll forget about it. He's like this with everyone. It always takes him some time to warm up to new people. That's all. - What are we talking about here? - By Sunday, you'll be a part of this family. I can tell he really likes you. I don't like him. And I really don't think the whole racial thing matters to him. - It's not that he's white. - It's not? - Is this yours or mine? - That's mine and that's for later. No. I think it's for now. - Lf memory serves me right, I think it's mine. - No, Simon. Take it off! - Take it off right now. - It's perfect on me. - What are you doing? - Look at it. Red is my color. - Always has been. Look at it. My goodness! - Simon, take it off. But it fits me so perfectly. Look, you're stretching it! - Take it off right now. - It's not ruined. It's nice. You take it off. - I'm not joking. - You want some of this? Stop it, Simon. - Take it off. - You take it off. Coming in. Mom! - I'm going to tell her right now. - Go and tell. - What? - He's taking Simon to a hotel! I'm paying for it. What's the problem? - Can I speak to you? - You sure can. Why are you taking him to a hotel? You didn't see what they were about to do upstairs. - Mom, we were just playing. - Well, playtime is over. Mr. Jones, I'm not a cross-dresser. Just for the record. - A cross-dresser? - No. What are you. It's lingerie. - You shouldn't even be having any. - I'm a grown woman, Percy! - It is not covering up the grown parts! - What! Why does the young man have to go to a hotel? Don't start with me. This is my house and my rules. Your rules? This house can't handle no more testosterone. We cannot exceed the testosterone level. We gotta keep it like that until the girls get married. Maybe even beyond that. And I'm not suggesting anyone get married! Why can't he stay in the basement, in your room? Because that's my room! That's my stuff down there. - How selfish. - That doesn't make sense. It got mold, anyway. Could be black mold. I wouldn't feel comfortable putting him at risk. Do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds? No, it's okay. No, it's not okay! What are you talking about? Look, this is your father's house. We're gonna play it by his rules. Now, he's obviously set a testosterone standard. And I'm going to abide by that. - You falling for that? I'm going with you. - No, you're not gonna do that. - You don't want me to go with you? - Of course I want you to! But what? - You need to stay here. - Hello? You need to stay here. - No. I want to be with you! - We're still here! Are you two gonna be done soon, or maybe we should have a seat? Come on, honey. Let's sit. You need to help your mom with the party arrangements. We don't want to stress them out, do we? No. - All right? - Yes. - All right. We're all set. - I'm glad you all decided. Come on, let's go. - Come on, get your stuff. Let's go. - Yeah. All right. Where is he? Girl! Oh, my God. Are we being audited? - No, Keisha. - What's happening? This is Simon. This is Theresa's boyfriend. This is Keisha, her little sister. Go. - Nice to meet you. - Oh, this. Yes. Nice to meet you, too. Good, you all met. Take it to the car. I'll meet you out there. - Dad, Theresa's boyfriend is white. - I know. I know you know. I just wanted to see your face when you heard it again. Not now. - Don't forget we have dinner reservations. - We'll meet you over there. She was black as the night Louie was whiter than white Danger Take a walk on the wild side And the colored girls go doo do doo do doo Looks like rain. Nope. - Those clouds look pretty threatening. - I live here. I know the weather. So, Theresa tells me you're in charge of the loan department at the bank. That must be a rewarding job. I'm thinking about making a switch to a smaller company. I just think there's less political garbage. You think I don't deal with political garbage? I got political garbage coming out my ass. If I give a guy a loan, I'm married to him for 30 years. If I deny him, I have to deal with him in church on Sunday. - I know that feeling. - Don't try to act like our jobs are alike. Good thing it isn't raining. That's not rain. It's sprinkling. You might want to turn on the windshield wipers. I will once it starts raining. Come on, you two, let's go. - I don't want to be late. Keisha! - Coming! Why you always got to knock on my door first? 'Cause you still live here. Let's go. It's raining. I don't wanna be late. Come on. Okay, tell me what's it like? - What's what like? - Being with a white guy. - Come on, Keisha, what's the sex like? - Yeah. Where's Mom? She's downstairs, girl. Come on! Bring it. Okay. You know that thing they say about the size? Completely the opposite. - Really? - They're huge. And not only are their penises big, but they can sing. When they get excited, they sing up a storm. They know a million tunes. They're like big iPods. Cut it out. Stop it. Keisha, seriously, is he nice? - Yeah, and he's cute, too. - I know. - What about Mom and Dad? - Mom is cool with it. I mean, Dad, he seems, you know, a little on edge, but not more than usual. Isn't he ever? - Girls! - Coming! But can I just say, I love you so much right now because. - Why? .from now on, no matter what I do, if I. - crash Dad's car, or if I. - What's wrong? .rob a bank. - if I burn this house down. - Keisha. .I won't be the one who brought home the white boy! Thank you! Mom! - Can I help you with your bag, sir? - I'm okay. I got it. You don't trust a working man with your bag? No, I just. It's just one bag. What do you think, he'll rifle through your luggage. and steal your toothbrush and your fancy conditioner? - No, that's not it at all. - Let me tell you something. Theresa's grandfather was a bellman for over 60 years and he never stole nothing. Could you get my bag? What, he's your slave now? No. Did you want me to take your bag, sir? I don't know. - Next, please. - Okay. Hi. Reservation for Percy Jones. And that's Jones with a "J"? No, Jones with a "P." I made the reservation last week. You knew you were gonna kick me out a week ago? Son, I knew I was gonna kick you out 24 years ago. when the doctor announced it was a girl. - Here you are. - Good. - We gave your room away. - What? Check-in was at 4:00. It's Thursday night. I'm quite sure you got another room available. I'm sorry, we're completely booked and so is everyone else. There's a Shriners convention in town, actually. May I help you with anything else, Mr. Pjones? I guess I'll have to stay at your house, then. No, there's a crack hotel downtown. You'll be just fine. Come on. Next. Hi. Welcome to Cranford. - I don't know what your basement's like. - It's damp. You'd hate it. I don't think dampness is really an issue at this point. You can't think about anything but getting back in the house with my daughter. Mr. Jones, I'm in your house. I'll obey your rules. Yeah, right. You'll obey Mr. Jones now. but when you're up at 3:00 in the morning. all hot and horny, you'll obey Mr. Johnson. You heard the lady. There's no available hotel rooms in the whole town. - I'm not gonna do anything. I swear. - Put your stuff in there. Come on. You know, dinner's in about 10 minutes. I don't know what Marilyn is like about schedule, but I know Theresa is. Stay out of that storm. All right. You can stay in my basement. But you remember one thing. These eyes, they see everything. Now get in the car. Come on, let's go. Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony Ivory, ebony So, how long have you two been together? - Five months. - Six months. Which one is it? Well, see, Theresa counts from the first day that we met. And I count from the first. - How's the chicken here? - It's really good. Did I tell you two girls. that for the first dance, your father and I are gonna do the tango? - The tango? - You and Dad? You know what? Your father and I used to dance all the time when we were younger. Sweetheart, I told you we're not doing a tango. We're already saying our vows. That's enough. We're doing the tango. Sorry. I forgot to turn it off. Know what? This is an important call. I'm just gonna. No, you can take your call here. Sit down and take your call. It's a business call. It's boring stuff. Business is not boring. Simon, sit down and take your call. Sit down. - Hello. - Simon? - Yeah, this is Simon. - Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier. I hope Theresa makes good money as a photographer. Someone started a rumor that you're being investigated. by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is so Nathan to do something like that. I think it's Nathan, too. 'cause this is the last thing he wants to see, is his best employee going to another firm. You know me. - I'm always up for a new challenge. - Are you listening to me? - You've been blackballed. - Great! Guy, it's not my fault. I'm just telling you what they told me. I'll call you next week. Did Nathan put you up for another award? Nothing. It's embarrassing. - Hello. Can I start you off with some drinks? - Vodka tonic. Celebrating a great phone call. Okay. Bring him his liquor, and bring the rest of us our usual. They have iced tea and I have my lemonade. Actually, I think I'm gonna have a glass of Pinot Grigio. - And I'll have a Cosmo. - Me, too. Okay. Bring them their alcohol and I'll have my usual lemonade. Someone has to act responsibly around here. So, Simon, I hear that you're a singer. What are you, a soprano, an alto, or. No? Maybe bass? I don't really sing. How long can you hold a note? He can hold a note. - Really? - For a very long time. Sing something for me, baby. Are you okay? Drink some water. Jerry, Nathan's got my ankles to my earlobes right now. I'm gonna need. Jerry, Nathan's got my ankles to my earlobes right now. I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need some cash. Call me back as soon as you get this. I need a favor, okay? You've got to be kidding me. "Let me see your sexy body go." I knew you'd be down here sooner or later. Did you bring some of that sexy lingerie for me to try? What is wrong with you, boy? Don't you have your own underwear? You like my space? Yeah. It's very homey. Interesting odor. I told you it had mold. Did you come down here for this? Having a little trouble writing your vows? That's none of your damn business. I'm just saying, I could maybe help you come up with something romantic. Don't start thinking that you know more about romance than I do. With your hand-holding and feeding each other food. and wiping off each other's faces. That's bullshit. Being married 25 years, that's real romance. And believe me, it's a war. Brutal. Exhausting. Sounds like someone just finished their vows. - Ready for lights out? - Looks that way. - Good night. - Good night. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - What are you doing? - Getting ready to go to sleep. - Here? You're sleeping here? - Right here. - Don't you have a bed upstairs? - Sure do. So does Theresa. By me sleeping here assures me that she'll get a good night's sleep. all alone. Good night. Sorry. - What are you doing under there? - It's just a pillow. - We might need a barrier. - A barrier for what? I tend to move around a lot in my sleep. How do you know you move around if you're asleep? Theresa mentioned once that. I mentioned it to her. after someone else told me. that wasn't Theresa. Okay. We can talk about this, right? Theresa and I have a. - No, you can't talk about it. .healthy relationship. - Stop! - We can't talk about this? I don't wanna hear you talking about sleeping with my daughter. You're sleeping with me now. Now, good night! - Good morning. - Good morning. You're up early. Or late, depending on how you look at it. - Coffee? - Yes. Bless you. I don't know how you sleep with that man. - Did he get in your space? - A little bit. Did he spoon you? It was more of a wedge maneuver. Big man likes to cuddle in his sleep. I just wish he were a little bit more cuddly when he was awake. You know, when my father first met Percy Jones, he could not stand him. Really? But eventually they got along, right? No. - Good morning! - Good morning. Good morning, babe. - I missed you. - I missed you. - Did you sleep well? - Yeah. - Who's going with me to get some flowers? - I'll go. Me, too, if we go early, because I have to work this afternoon. Good morning! You're looking awfully chipper this morning. Something about knowing your daughter's not being violated relaxes a man. I thought you said that mattress hurts your back. No, not me. I could sleep on that mattress every night. Every single night. Good morning, boss. Got you some coffee. - So, what's the verdict? - What are you talking about? I'm talking about Theresa's new boyfriend. What is he, a painter? Poet? Did he ask you to borrow some money? My daughter's got great taste in men. That new guy, he's really something. - Tell me a little bit about the brother. - Oh, man, thank you. I'll tell you about the brother. He's a big guy. Nice looking. - What's his name? - Jamal. - Graduated Howard University. - Howard? Played basketball. He almost went pro. Till he changed his career to medicine. There was a big write-up on him in Jet four years ago. No shit. Parents from Atlanta. Friends with Mrs. King, Dr. Cosby, Rev. Jackson. Come on now. - Go down towards the middle. - Go down? Sit up a little bit. - That's it? - Man, yeah. I'm telling you, Reggie. I'm the luckiest man in Jersey. My daughter's dating the great black hope. - You got it. - That's it. - Hold it right there. - I'm not gonna move. Excuse me? Boss? Simon Green here to see you. Lifting, you know. Cut that off, Reggie. Go on, take it out. Come on, Reggie. Get on the ball around the. I'll be right there. I'll be right out. Give me. Sign something. - Fred, who is Simon? - A friend of Theresa's, he says. Oh, shit. He better hope Jamal don't find out. - Be right with you, sir. - Great. - Jerry? Hey. - Simon, what's up? Listen. I need you to get me into that nanotech IPO. I want 10 blocks. That's $50,000! Did you inherit a boatload or something? The initial public offering comes out on Tuesday. What do you expect me to do? I know when it comes out. I set the damn date, okay? Just buy it for me on margin. Dude, you don't work here anymore. I need this IPO to hold me over until I get another job. I know you're really screwed right now. but do you even have $50,000? I'm gonna sell off my IRAs, okay? I'll have it in 10 days. I can't do margin. I need cash. I'm in Jersey right now. Where am I gonna get cash? I'm sure one of those chemical plants has an ATM machine. All right, look. I'll get the cash. Just put in the order. Cash by Tuesday. I'll bring it to you personally on Monday. Don't punk out on me. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? I feel like we didn't get off on the right foot yesterday. so I thought maybe. I'd come here and take you to lunch. Maybe we could bond a little. I think we bonded just fine around 3:10 this morning when your knee was in my crotch. Right. I'll buy. - You want to buy me lunch? - Yeah. I figured it's the proper thing to do after sleeping with each other. Okay. - So, nice bank. - I'm glad you like it. I like the small-town feel. It's less complicated. Somebody needs money, they just come in and say: "Percy, I need a loan." Right? And then, of course, you say, "Well, yeah. How much?" They say, "I don't know. You tell me. $50,000?" What, you need $50,000? - Do I need $50,000? - Yeah. No. I most assuredly do not. I was just admiring the process. How many cylinders does a NASCAR engine have, six or eight? - How. - Yeah. Six. or eight. depending on the gas mileage consumption of the automobile. You never worked in the pit at NASCAR. You might as well admit it. All right, you know, fine. I never really had an aptitude for engines. Jay. Jeff. Jeff Gordon didn't really trust me in the pit that much. But you did drive the cars. - Drive? - Yeah. - Absolutely. - Good. All right! Fine! I never drove NASCAR! But I was nervous and I wanted to impress you. You shouldn't have lied. All right. This is the deal. We go one lap around. If you beat me, I'll loan you the money. - Really? - I knew it! I knew you needed the money. I don't need the money! Move over! Yeah. Fool! Sucker! Move it, man! What the hell are you doing? - I think it's obvious who came in first. - You're doggone right. You know I won. - I was through the bushes before. - I was through first. I had more speed. I was through the bushes and on the asphalt. - before you even were at the bushes. - Look. Dispatch, this is 53 Charlie. Brian, we got a problem. Two cars have jumped. License and registration. - Poppy! - There's my beautiful girl. Simon, I want you to meet my granddad. - Hi, there. Howard Jones. - Simon Green. Good to meet you, sir. Nice to meet you. - Hey, Speed Racer. - Hey! - What's with the white kid? - That's Simon. He's my boyfriend. Your boyfriend? You didn't tell me he was white. - Yes, I did. - When? - Back at the home. - I thought you was kidding. Okay. Well, I think that's it. I think you're forgetting about the vodka. Say grace, Percy. Thank you, Lord. Amen. - That was fast. - The Lord knows I'm busy. - Simon, pass on the broccoli, please. - Yes, sir. So, what, they don't have any available young black men in New York anymore? They just ran out last week, Grandpa. I'm just trying to figure out why you chose to go this way. - Don't mind him. - It's okay. My grandmother loved you when she first met you. But later she said some things. I was like, "Wow, Grandma." - What kind of things? - Yeah, what kind of things? Nothing. Just things. - Such as? - Yeah, such as? - Daddy? I got it. - I know. You know what? You're gonna laugh when you hear this. She said that Theresa was a very pretty girl. - That's so nice. - Good taste. So I ask her what she liked about you the most, right? She said. She says, "I just love her cute, little, nappy little head." - Your grandmother, where does she live? - Brooklyn. Why? I just wanna know how far I'd have to travel to kick her old white ass, that's why! Grandpa. You don't call my grandchild no nappy head! Did she say that while putting on a sheet for the Klan rally? Settle down, now! Hand me the butter. - My grandmother's not a malicious woman. - No, she's not. She's 82. She comes from a different time. I'm 74 and I come from a different time. You don't hear me calling white folks honky and flat-ass! - Casper. - Cracker. - Ofay. - Peckerwood. - Wonder bread. - Bird shit. Bird shit? It's almost white. That's pretty good. Howard. Percy! It's okay. I'm really sorry about what my grandmother said. but there are some people you're just never gonna change. - as much as you'd like to. - Yep. I can tell you this. Last Thanksgiving. my Uncle Dave said a black joke at the table, right? So I said, right in front of the whole family, "Look, that's inappropriate. "We're not gonna have it." I think that's how you change people. You just gotta attack it one at a time. Exactly. What was the joke? Excuse me? Tell the joke. - I don't remember it. - Sure you do. Tell the joke. - Really, I don't remember it. It was. - Dad. Chicken. - Excuse me? - I didn't stutter. Okay, you know what? I'll tell the joke. - No, Simon. You don't. - Baby, it's okay. I'll tell you why. Because by not telling the joke, I'm empowering it. Right? So I'll just. tell the joke and expose how simple-minded. and crude and unfunny it actually is. What do you call. What do you call 100 black men. buried in the ground up to their neck? - What? - Afro-Turf. - That's cute. - What are you laughing at? - It's cute. - Cute don't make it funny. Tell another. - Dad, no. - Let the man tell a joke! I don't know any other ones. Obviously, I've heard other black jokes, but I think I've proven my point. So it's okay to empower the other ones? Okay. I see what you're doing here, you're putting me on the spot. It's okay. Look, it's fine. 'Cause I'm not gonna back down. Back down, Simon. The only way to break down barriers is to have everything out in the open. - Right? - Exactly. So, what do you call. one black man being chased by 300 white men? - What? - The PGA Tour. I get it. Tiger Woods. There it is. That's good. Tell another one. How do we know that Adam and Eve weren't black? How? You ever try to take a rib away from a black man? That's pretty good. - That's pretty good. - I wouldn't take one from you, I know that! - You chewing it down to the bone. - That's a good one. - He's a rib fan. - Don't try. - Tell more. - Okay. - Why don't black people like country music? - Why? 'Cause every time they say "hoe-down," they think someone shot their sister. You gonna be all right? That is so true. - That's a tailored joke for you. - Why I gotta be a ho? Ain't nobody talking about you. - It's a sister joke! - You're sisters. I'm not the "ho sister." Come on now. Can't stop now, baby. What are three things that a black man can't get? What is that he can't he get? A black eye, a fat lip, and a job. I tell you I'm going to kick this boy's ass! - Grandpa. - No, it's. We know you can take him, but just sit down. Be nice. Come on. - Come on, now. It's a joke. - That's right, Daddy. Sit down. It's just a joke. Come on. Hee-hee, ha-ha. That's all it is. Now if you'll excuse me. all of a sudden, I lost my appetite. Think I'll take a walk. - I should have stopped at "hoe-down." - You should have never started. This isn't like us at home, laughing about this bullshit. It's my father's house, Simon. What do you want me to do, go upstairs and apologize to him again? No. Let the storm pass. It'll be fine. Besides, he dared you! - He double-dared! He called me chicken. - I heard! - I can't be called chicken. - You have to watch him on those. You know? I'm fresh out of ideas as to how to impress your father. Telling black jokes is never a good idea, but that's just me. You think? I'll talk to him. Say nice things about me. No, I'm not going to say nice things about you. You are still punished. Baby, I'm a good guy. I like ribs, too. I don't. Why are you being so mean to me? - My grandfather's out there. - He's not going to come in. - This is my mom's kitchen! - She's not going to come in. You're still gonna do the dishes. - Get off me. - Fine, I'll do the dishes. Here, do the broccoli one. - Dad, I have to talk to you. - What? - Why did you do that? - I didn't start it. Mr. Nappy Head did. Dad, Simon's a good man. He has a good heart. - A good man? - You put him on the spot. You really think so? What is your problem with him anyways? Besides the fact, of course, that he's white. You gonna get in a heap of trouble talking to me like that. Don't care nothing about that man being white. He's hiding something. What? NASCAR? You thought I didn't know? Of course I knew. We talk about everything, Simon and I. Daddy, I love him, and you need to start respecting that. Then you respect me enough to tell me in advance who you're bringing home. - I didn't think you'd care. - But you weren't sure. - So you decided to test me. - No, of course not. - So you're looking for a reaction? - No. So what are you looking for? I'm looking for you to tell me that it's okay for me to be with him. I'm scared. Okay? I'm really scared, Dad. I know things are different now and times have changed. but you should really hear the kind of things that people say to us sometimes. And the way they look at us. I need you to tell me that it's okay to be with him. Baby, me telling you it's okay is not gonna change the world. Dad. But it would change my world. It will change my world if I know that you're behind us. I'm always behind you, sweetheart. And I love you. It's my job to keep you safe. And I don't trust that kid. - Hey, baby. - Yes. I'm trying to figure out where he got all those doggone black jokes. What do white people do, take a class. sit around and think of new jokes about the black man? I don't know, Percy. You need to let that one go. Come on, sweetheart. We need to practice the tango. I told you. I ain't doing no doggone tango. Why? You think you can't dance anymore? No. I think the tango's a stupid dance and I ain't doing it. Marilyn. why can't we do the hustle? What's wrong with the hustle? Because the hustle is a stupid dance. and I want to do the tango. Look here, woman, can't we do this some other time? I gotta take Dad back to the home. - I'll be back. - Okay. Shut up! All right, stop. Okay, move a little to your left. - Okay. - All right, kiss me. This is the exact spot where I had my first kiss. No! I'm not going to kiss you in the spot that you had your first kiss. - No. - Why not? It's some other guy's spot. Fine. - What was his name? - Curtis Booker. He had these big old Bucky Beaver teeth. But he was such a nice boy. He was a good kisser, too. - Better than me? - Way better. - Way better? - Yeah. - Did he grab your ass? - No. - Squeeze it? - No. We were 13. - Grab you down here? - No. Come on! - Slow down. - Come on. - There's a car! Get out of the way! - Come on! Yeah! Okay, be careful. So, this is my favorite spot. It's pretty amazing, huh? All right, so it's not. the top of the world, but it's nice. It's a fort. It's a gun placement. When I was little, I would sneak out of the house in the middle of the night. and just come out here and just dream. Yeah? Weren't you afraid of sneaking out of your house? Please. I'm not afraid of Percy Jones. Well, that makes you and. you. Okay, so this is just Cranford. But it's a great place to grow up. It's a good place to raise a family, too. You know, maybe we shouldn't do this. What? Live in the suburbs? No. Tell your parents about our engagement this weekend. Simon, I told you not to look at him straight in the eye. I don't think Percy Jones is ready. I think Percy Jones needs more time. A lot more time for Percy Jones. - Are you getting cold feet, Simon? - No. No, I'm not getting cold feet. I can't wait to marry you. Make babies with you. Give me a daughter that looks just like you. I can work on that. - Yeah? - Yeah. And hopefully, I can be a good dad. I think you'll be a great dad. You're never gonna be like your father, Simon. Maybe I can be like yours. - Like Percy? - Yeah. - No. - Baby, Percy Jones is a good dad. He's there for you. He cares about you. He loves you so much. He does. We just have to get him to love you. Maybe we can start by getting him to take the padlock off the basement door. It's not going to happen. Why don't you give me a little Curtis Booker? I can't believe I told you that. - Come on, baby, a little Bucky Beaver? - No. No. How about some Simon Green? Marilyn, you cut off the porch light? That's my girl. Very stylish. I need to take a quarter inch off the pants. I can do it here. Let me have them. What, you mean take the pants off? I could do with you in them but I don't want to poke you with my needle. You keep your eyes on the pants, you hear me? Mr. Jones, do you know where the extra chairs are? What are you, blind? They're against the wall. - When you go out, close the door. - Right. Percy, put some pants on. We got people in the house. - Thank you. - Thank you, sweetheart. I didn't realize. How long's it gonna take? - Two shakes of a lamb's tail. - Whatever the hell that means. Mercy, Percy! Keep your shirt on! Or take it off. Whatever. Could someone answer that damn phone? Thank you! - Jones residence. - This is Reggie. Who's this? - This is Theresa's boyfriend. - Jamal! What's up, man? - Percy told me all about you. - What's that? My name is Reggie. Percy told me all about you, man. He did? You know what we should do? Get together and play some hoops, man. I don't really play hoops. Come on, man. Don't be shy. Why are you being shy? Percy told me that you went to Howard. He said you almost went pro. - He said that? - Yeah. He was bragging all about you, Jamal. But listen. two things. One: Could you autograph the issue. of Jet for me? And the other thing is, I would love to meet the Cosbys. When I say love to meet them, I mean I love to meet them. - I'll see what I can do. - I feel like I grew up with them. Let me get Percy for you. You know, in the '80s and whatnot and. - It's for you. It's Reggie. - We were talking about the Cosbys. - May I have some privacy, please? - But, yeah, you know what I mean? - And shut the door. - I'd still love to meet them. Theo. Reggie. What did you find out? You were right about Simon Green. He is no longer at J.P. Oliver. Come on. Give me my pants. - Jamal, huh? - Don't start. This isn't about me. It's about you and your job, that you don't have anymore. - What? - Yeah. Move out of my way. Hey, baby! Theresa! Come here, sweetheart. Daddy needs to talk to you. - Don't listen to him. - What are you talking about? Your boyfriend's unemployed, lost his job. He got fired a couple days ago. I did not get fired! I quit! You quit? Why didn't you tell me this? - It's complicated. - It's complicated when you're a liar. I'm a liar? What about the lies you told Reggie? - Jamal? - Who's Jamal? - He's good friends with the Cosbys. - What about NASCAR? That was nothing, and I admitted it. - You admitted that you lied. - You tried to kill me with a go-kart. At least I can drive. This crazy ass almost got us arrested. Now we both got court dates. I can't believe you checked up on me. - You kept asking me for money. - I never asked you for money. - You asked my father for money? - $50,000 loan, baby. - I did not. He trapped me into it. - You're a liar. You were checking up on him? He forced my hand. You're my daughter and he's not worthy! - That's not for you to decide. - Right! And what about you, lying to me? You said you would never lie. You ain't gotta go over there. I thought I could get another job. I was gonna tell you, but I didn't want to ruin the big weekend. You said we would always tell each other the truth. Like how you told your parents about me being white? - I knew they wouldn't care about that. - I don't care. I care that you're a liar. That's bullshit! You care. He has to care. It's human nature. That means that you care that I'm black? - Do you? - Dad! No. It doesn't matter what I say. You people are gonna think I'm a racist. - You hear that? "You people." - I know. I heard. What people? The people in the yard. That's what I'm. See? I say one thing and I'm a racist! - No, Simon, you're a liar. - And a racist. Where do you get off calling me a racist? I have a black girlfriend! - You had a black girlfriend! - Have. Past tense! Had! And let me tell you something else, son. - What the hell is going on? - I'll tell you what's going on. - He got fired from J.P. Oliver! - I did not get fired! I quit! - I told you to stay out of Theresa's life. - Thank you. He can't just walk in our house, telling our baby lies. - I'm not lying! - I don't think so! - The party's off, Percy. - Woman, you must be crazy. I don't want to say my vows with you. It would be a lie before God. Marilyn, we're saying some goddamn vows tomorrow. - Yeah, he got a book and everything. - Would you shut up? You got your vows out of a book? No. Don't listen to him! I got a book. I'm using it for inspiration. - He wrote it down word for word. - You're going to get hurt. - That is so pathetic! - Come on, Marilyn! Because if memory serves me correctly, I used to be inspiration enough. You still are! You'd be inspiration to me. He neglects you. Marilyn, get your ass back here! I got a $200 cake coming tomorrow! Sixty pounds of shrimp! Sixty pounds of shrimp, woman! I had to take a second on the house! - She looked angry. - Marilyn, don't let me raise my voice now! You gonna force me to use the muscle! Hope you like seafood. Theresa! Wait! Come on! - They'll be back. - No, they're not coming back. They gotta come back. Sixty pounds of shrimp! Come on, baby. Pick it up. Answer that phone, sweetheart, and it will be your last. Let me borrow your car. What? You can't go chasing behind no women. Have some dignity! Besides, you can't even drive a damn go-kart! Trouble in paradise? Baby, we need to talk about this. You should call me and we should talk about it like adults. because adults communicate when they have problems. I'm looking at your photos on the wall and they're beautiful. Beautiful photos. I don't think that I compliment you on your work enough. You know what? You're being rude. That's what you're being. So call me back. Baby, I'm sorry. You're not being rude. You have all the reason in the world to be upset with me right now. You shouldn't be calling me back. If I was you, I wouldn't call me back. Baby, call me back. Call me back, baby. I'm looking at your bulletin board and there's a picture of you. sitting next to a guy and I think that that guy might be Curtis Booker. He looks like he's got Bucky Beaver teeth. He looks a lot older than 13! So I don't know how you feel about it, but it's gone! Old Curtis Booker can go bye-bye! Baby, do you have any Scotch Tape? You're acting like I cheated on you, and I've never cheated on you. except for that one time with myself, and you caught me. Hello. Darlene! How you doing? This is Percy Jones. I'm looking for Marilyn. She left a little earlier. I thought she'd be back by now. - I'm sorry. Now, who is this? - Percy Jones. I'm sorry, Percy. I must have fell asleep on the couch. Baby, you say you looking for Marilyn? - Have you seen her? - Well, now, what happened? What'd you say to my sister, Percy Jones? Nothing. Listen, if you hear from her, can you let me know? Will do. And I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the party, right? - Yeah, it should be a lot of fun. - Goodbye. Girl! You will never guess who was just on the phone! - Who? - A Mr. Percy A. Jones. Percy A. Who? Yeah, well, baby, he is feeling the pain now! Mom. Is that gonna be your last one? It might be, baby. And it might not. You should be over there trying to work this out with Dad. I should be over there trying to work it out with Simon. Mom, please. Child, leave your mom alone. They ain't going nowhere. Your man quit his job and didn't tell you. - Got to nip that shit in the bud. - Yes. No. But. Look, I have 15 missed calls. - Fifteen, Mom. Fifteen! - Fifteen? Your baby got 15 missed calls! - Bullshit. Let him wait! - That's true. I'm gonna call him now. - No, you're not! - No. Don't you dare! Child, you take your finger off that trigger! Did he lie to you, Theresa? Did he lie to you? Yes, he did. So, if you don't want him to do it again, let him feel the pain! Look, honey, and if you want him that bad, you've got to train him. My God, if what he's giving you is that good. and then you still don't want him, send his pasty ass to me! - All right, one more! - Two! There you go, baby! Here's to you, baby. I gotta go to work in the morning. Hello? - Sorry, Marcus. - I'm sorry, baby. You want a taste? Thank you, Marcus. This is my house. - She won't answer the phone. - She don't want to talk to you. - Can I get something to drink? - What, vodka? Yes. Vodka. I would like some vodka. Sorry, Charlie. No vodka. There's gotta be something around here. Marilyn was throwing an anniversary party. Is throwing a party. - Was. - Is. - Party's off, dude. - The party is on, dude. You won't find no liquor in here. This is a Christian home. Bingo. With a house full of sinners. Marilyn's got good taste in vodka. This is, like, a $50 bottle. Give me that. Give it here. - Can I at least have a little bit? - No. Just a taste. Come around here and get those two glasses over there. Hurry up. Who's playing? Played. That's history. New York Giants' first Super Bowl win. Talking about Phil Simms. L.T. You ever play? - I told you before, no. - Pitiful. All right, let's do it. Do what? - Fumble! - You said you weren't gonna hit me! Touchdown! Yeah, baby. - This is where your hands go. - Where am I gonna be? - You're on the bottom. I'm on the top. - All right. Okay, so you hold this frame. One and step. Right. - I'm leading. - Okay. Back. Nice. Step. Left. Good. Double-time. - Okay, no. See? This is. - What was wrong with that? - You're screwing around. - I'm not. You're getting crazy here, not holding your frame. There must be space between us. Not like when we're sleeping. You can't be, like, up here. You're not holding your frame. It's a structured dance. - Okay, so back up. - Your mama taught you this? Yes, I used to help her in the dance studio on the weekends. - Step. Two. - You get fired from there, too? No. I didn't get fired from this job. I quit. Was it over money? Because if it wasn't, this doesn't make any sense. I had a difference of opinion with the management. They weren't ready for a guy like me. I don't get it. And heads. No, you're doing great. I ain't talking about this. I'm talking about you and Theresa. You ain't got nothing in common. For example: You don't like sports. Theresa loves sports. You're a businessman. She's an artist. You're white. She's black. Did I miss anything? No. That's just it. She's everything I'm not. You know, she's my other half. Without her, I'm not whole. You know, the thing about meeting your other half is. you're walking around, you think you're happy. you think that you're whole. Then you realize you ain't shit without her. Then you can't go back to being a half. 'cause now you know what it's like to be a whole. You know what I mean? Yeah, I do. And I still got it. - That was nice. - Real nice. - I liked the snap. - You like that? - I think you hurt me. - Percy Jones, boy. Good morning. Looks like I missed a fun night. - Just sitting up here, watching football. - That's how it always starts. - Where's Marilyn? - She stayed all night at Darlene's house. She must be really mad. Wait. You knew where they were the whole time? Yeah. I thought they'd be back by now. - Did you apologize? - I didn't do anything. Exactly! Dante, please. Don't try to play that metrosexual mind game on me, okay? Okay. All right. Let's go get them. You don't understand. They done called all their friends and sat up all night ragging on men. They've worked themselves up into a man-hating frenzy. - How many women? - I guarantee you, large numbers. Sisters. You can't just walk in on a bunch of angry black women. You'll die. Well, we'll just have to go out like men. - He's right, Percy. - I know he's right. But I'm still scared. - Keep talking. What are you saying? - Like that, a little. - I'm liking it. - Thank you. You gonna share your colors? You're one of them sisters who don't share colors. No, I'm not. Give up your secrets, honey. This is gorgeous. Pink Passion. Every woman needs this. A little Pink Passion? You know what I always say? A little bit of makeup, a little bit of hair ain't never hurt nobody. How did I know she would be wearing Pink Passion? - Yes, they're in there. - Maybe I should go first. Are you crazy? I'm the one that got experience in this sort of thing. You just pay attention. I'll show you how it's done. Here, straighten yourself up. If you go up in there, you go in looking like a man. - Wipe this off. - You got something. Thank you. Yeah. - Man, I'm not gonna. - No. We gotta do this. Well, well, well. - Lf it isn't Mr. Percy Jones. - It is I. It's about time you showed up. - What's up? - I'm well. - Percy. - Marilyn. Marilyn, may I speak to you in private over there, please. so the ladies can continue eating? Oh, no! You go on home with that. - It's not going down like that, my brother. - No way, no how. You know better than that, Percy. You got something to say, say it here. In front of everybody. Step up to the chalk line and be a man. I married you, didn't I? Don't that count for something? - Hell, no! - What does he want, an award? That don't count for nothing! It really doesn't count. - Come on, man. - I know, I'm just. Oh, hell. I was wrong, okay? - It's a good start, Percy. - Keep going! I've been wrong for a long time. Ever since I forgot. that you are my better half. Hell, Marilyn, you're everything I'm not. Without you, I'm not whole. Look. Let. Baby, before I met you, I thought I was all that. And then you came into my life, and I realized that I wasn't all that. Wasn't even half of that. I might have been a quarter of that. But then you left me last night! And, baby, I remembered how it felt to be without you. And let me tell you something. I ain't shit without you! - Dad. - Man. And I forgot about that. And I'm sorry. Baby, marry me. Make me whole again. - I love you, Percy. - I love you, too. - That's what I'm talking about, baby. - You go, Marilyn, bad girl! Kiss your baby. - I missed you so much. - I missed you. I couldn't sleep at all last night. I'm sorry, baby. I feel so much better! - Isn't that lovely? - Get off that. I guess it's my turn. All right. That's going to be a tough speech to follow. - It was a great speech, Perce. - Thank you. - I had something similar in mind. - Great minds think alike. Admitting you were wrong would be a great start. Yes, it would. Right. Go ahead, man. Baby, I was wrong! What are you doing? I want to see your sexy body go bump, bump, bump. We have to talk in private. I don't wanna hear it. No. Mom? Just stay here and talk about it in front of everybody! Ladies, please. Take your man and go work out your business. That's right. Go on. Thank you. - Don't let him work on you. - That ain't right. - Did he say "bump, bump, bump"? - Yeah, and it's Percy's fault. It's all your fault! Those kids are in love and they finally liked each other and you all interfere. My love right here. Don't tell me how to define my love! Lord have mercy. Baby. Come on. I was trying to impress your father. I didn't want to show up here and be the unemployed fianc√©. I've never lied to you before and I'll never lie to you again, ever. You lied about asking my father for a loan. That was an omission that was tied to a previous lie. That doesn't. And I look like an idiot to you. No. You look a little bit like Percy Jones, though. I can't believe you're trying to be funny. - Baby, come on. - Why do you have to be funny right now? Don't touch me! You need to calm down. You made me look like an asshole in there. Don't tell me to calm down. I think you were doing a pretty good job of that yourself. Not telling them about me? And then I pitched in and I blew it, okay? I panicked when I found out that Nathan was blackballing me. I thought if I could score this IPO, I'd have enough money until I got another job. - But I was doing that for you. - What am I, your mother? I don't need you to take care of me. I want you to do things with me, not for me, Simon! - Will you just talk to me? - I am talking to you. - You're talking at me. - I am talking to you. But you need to talk to me and tell me how am I supposed to believe in you. when you don't trust me enough to tell me the truth? How do we get past this, with this skin, if we don't have each other's back? - Okay, I'm always gonna be the white boy. - And I'll always be the black girl. But at least I'm here and willing to deal with it, and I don't know about you. I don't know. And eventually, if you're gonna quit on me, just do it and don't. I'm standing right here! What more do you want from me? What do you want from the white boy? I've been here busting my ass to make you happy! Then let me make this easy for you! The engagement is off! Fine. - Good. - Great. Great. I'm in Jersey! - Okay, stand still now. - I'm still. You all right? I'm fine. I'm great. It's going to be a great day, Dad. - It sure is. - Yes. I'm gonna take lots of pictures. - So you better smile big for me, okay? - I will. And no crying. Mom said you cried last time. I was not crying, I was sweating. from my eyeballs. Hell, I was nervous. I knew I was making a big mistake. A 25-year mistake. And going for 25 more. Sweetheart? Why don't you call that man? You know he got his cell phone on. You know he does. He's probably waiting on the 5:15 train. We got a party going on. You get his ass back here! How many missed calls you have last night? Thirty-three. - Thirty-three? - Yeah. - Thirty-three? - Yeah. Thirty-three missed calls? Sweetheart, that's major. And you know the man is unemployed, yes, but he calls you. So give him that. Thirty-three missed calls? And you can't call him once? - Girl, don't be so proud. - No. Daddy, it's not. Pride ain't nothing when it comes to matters of the heart. It's not that. - It's not? - No. - I was going to marry him. - What? We were going to announce our engagement this weekend. So, you see? I have you to thank. because you saved me from a big heartache. Sweetheart, I just don't understand something. - Why did Simon quit his job? - I don't know. He didn't say. Why would a man quit his job on the day he's gonna meet his future father-in-law? Maybe he got tired of waiting for that promotion that never happened. Simon's a rising star, Dad. - He really is. - I believe that. But that boss of his is just not a nice man. - You ever met him? - A couple of times. He was always friendly, kind of. But he always had this look in his eyes, you know? Just not a nice man. But he was Simon's mentor, so. Whatever. Let it go. Today is about you and Mom. Now, first picture of the night. - Let me get my. On my good side. - Smile. I don't want Mom to see me like this. - I love you, Dad. - I love you, too. Damn! No. Do not do this to me, Percy Jones! We have a schedule! Tick-tock. Everything works. Timing. I'll be right back. - Timing! - I'll be right back. - In 10 minutes? - Or so, okay? How so? I'm sorry. Percy, have you met my wife, Diane? I certainly have heard a lot about you, Percy Jones. Nice to meet you. - Does Marilyn know you're going AWOL? - Of course. She does not. So you missed your train, huh? - There's another one at 6:00. - You gonna be on it? I should have been on that one. What are you doing here? I know why you quit your job. You told your boss you was coming here to meet me and he said: "Don't marry that black girl." Those weren't exactly the words. How did you know we were getting married? I told you, son. Don't nothing get past Percy Jones. - Theresa told you. - That, too. Come on, man. Let's get real. What you did with your boss was honorable, impressive. and stupid. You can't quit your job every time somebody rolls their eyes at the two of you. You'll never make any money. - How do you do 25 years? - Painfully. No, seriously. If you're gonna marry one of these women, sometimes it's gonna hurt like hell. All you can do is admit that you're wrong and know that she's always right. - She's right? - That's right. - Always? - Right. - Right. - That's right. All right. Okay, what about all the talk about my dignity? Do you love her? Do you want her? Then she's always right. Look, I know I didn't give you a fair shake. And I was wrong. And my daughter, she'd be lucky to have you. I'm not a quitter, Mr. Jones. I think I know that about you. Theresa doesn't. You just have to show her what you're made of. You know she's hot-headed. She's just like her mama. Every man gets to choose his destiny, son. No matter what his father did. And, Percy, you are not perfect. But that works for me because two perfect people in one relationship. might be too much. And sometimes you bark and bluff and bluster. but I always see the boy I married 25 years ago. And I only wish I loved him as much as I did back then, but I don't. I love him more. Thank you, Marilyn. That was lovely. Percy? Your vows? Marilyn Jones. Everyone knows I didn't write my vows. Everyone knows because you kept beating me up about it for weeks. crying to all your friends. You know? Now, look here, woman. I love you. But you didn't have to do me like that about my vows. You know I don't like writing. She knows that. I'm not a wordsmith. I do numbers. That's me. I don't do words. Damn it, I do money. And after 25 years, all I've asked you. is to let me be me. You'll never find As long as you shall live Oh, Lord. Someone to love you Love you, love you Tender like I do Tender like I do You know that about me, woman. You'll never find No matter where you search I'm not looking. Someone to care about you Care about you, care about you The way I do Oh, I'm not bragging on myself, baby But I'm the only one that loves you I think I forgot what love is until you and Simon showed up. Give that man another chance, daughter. You'll never find Simon! Yes, Simon. It'll take the end of all time Someone who understands you Like I do That's not Jamal. I could probably find a million reasons why we shouldn't be together. But you know what? I don't care. I don't care, either. I love you. And I'm sorry that I lied to you. I'm sorry, too. You're sorry? - Can you say that again? - I'm sorry, Simon. You're sorry? She said she was sorry. I believe she's. I'm sorry, Simon. - Get your man, girl! - Go ahead, sweetie! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure. to introduce to you all my future son-in-law, Simon Green. He's broke, unemployed, and he's white. But he loves my Theresa and that's all right with us. That's right. Welcome to the family, son. Welcome to the family. And cue the magic. Look at this. Will you look at that shit? Drink up! Enjoy! Welcome, man. - Let's watch the tango. - No, let's watch the party. - All right. Get your feet off the table. - Sorry, sir. - I look pretty good out there. - You do, Mom. Baby, you look so good because you're twirling around me. Oh, yeah, there you go, there you go. All right, you blew that part. - That was perfect. - There was hesitation there. - You did it better the night before. - The night before? - What happened? - We had a little dry run the night before. - Really? - You didn't tell me that, Percy! You're hallucinating, Simon. I ain't never danced with no man in my life. Taught him everything he knows. Percy Jones was born knowing how to tango. And let me tell you something about the tango. - It's a structured dance. - I told you that. What was that, Mom? You know what that is, Theresa. You're a grown-ass woman. - Damn, Mama, you still got it. - I know it, Keisha. All right now, watch this. This is when I got funky. - Go, Percy! It's your birthday! - Go, Percy. - Let's watch the vows. - No! - Watch the party. - Okay, fine, whatever. - There you are. - I got her, that girl is mine! I was just shocked you didn't fall down. That is cold. Look. Check me out. I am doing the hustle. I'm doing the hustle in your honor, Percy Jones. That ain't no damn hustle. That's the white man overbite. - You ain't even doing that right. - Why's it gotta be a white thing? Blacks have overbites, too. - He's doing a great hustle! - He's turning it up. - Why is my man looking at your ass? - No, he's not. Why is your man Samoan? - Where is Manu these days? - We broke up last week. - Thank you, Jesus. - What happened? I only started going out with him to mess with Daddy. And, girl, please. He is too big. He is a bone crusher. - Watch your mouth! - What? Do not use the word "bone" in my house. - Where were you all going? - Let's see that again. Your mother and I got a sudden thirst for punch. No. You're old enough to know. We going to shake some sheets. Is that all right with you? I thought you said no bone in the house! No! If everyone wants to see the lift, we do the lift. We're doing the lift! This is good. No. I was so sure you were going to drop me there. I love you! This is Dirty Dancing. I've been doing this since high school. Look at that. - Who's the man? - You did it with other girls? No, I only do that with you. I know that hurt. See that move right there. That's why you're not getting any grandkids. Let me call your mama right now and thank her for those dance lessons. - That's a low blow. - It's just a joke. - Simon! - Come on. I'll catch your big ass. We're down! Good thing is, she didn't break that dress. No, she didn't, but she felt bad about it all week. They gotta go deep. - I knew better. - Oh, my God. - That was a great party. - It was, Mom. Yeah, I guess a party not a party till something get broke.

World of Warcraft - Outland PVP (EU) - Torporr (name) Hello, everyone. We want to welcome a very special guest to our park today, the President's daughter. PHOTOGRAPHER: Big smile. Hello, Alexandra. Where's your father? He'll be here. I'll make sure of it. Hey, there, little Miss First Lady, I'm Dinky Winks, owner of this fine establishment. You ready to ride the ride and shrill to the thrills, spills, and chills? Yes, I am. Right this way! Of course, right behind me, the world-famous Whippersnapper. Guaranteed to make grown men howl like a cub wolf at weaning time. Over on our left, the Nervewracker. (EXCLAIMS) Painful, but fun. On your other left is, well, my personal favorite, the Vomiter. Now, we tell people not to ride it on a full stomach, but you know folks, they just don't listen. But why bother with any of those? You're here for my latest and greatest. For your personal amusement and complete gratification, I humbly offer the Juggler. -But is it fast? -(LAUGHS) Is it fast? Let's see, shall we? The riders are strapped into the bubble. The hydrobot lifts the bubble high into the air. (MECHANICAL CHUCKLING) And spins it round and round as fast as the United States Government will allow. The bubble spins, turns, flips, and bounces. (ALL SCREAMING) And then it juggles you. (SCREAMING) I want to go on! I thought so. Now, understand, the override precautions are top-notch, modified by yours truly. I thought her father was supposed to be here. SECRET AGENT 1 : The President has more pressing business than to spend an entire Sunday in a theme park. No one's that busy. Have fun, kid. We'll take it a little slow, just make it fun. (GASPS) -Can't you get her down? -Somebody's jammed the override. Why, that little troublemaker. SECRET AGENT 1 : Remain calm. Remain calm. We are the Secret Service. Everything is under control. -There's nothing we can do, sir. -What? SECRET AGENT 2: The weight of our agents will prevent us from ascending the shaky precipice on which she now stands. She'll fall. Don't we have any smaller agents? Bring me Agents SK1 and SK2. Coming through. Coming through. -We're ready. -Use this, the latest gear. CARMEN: We get to keep them afterwards? SECRET AGENT 1 : (STAMMERING) No. Yes. Of course. Let's rock. You're sure they can handle this? If not, there are two others who can. Bring me Agents SK3 and SK4 as backup. We got company. JUNI: Gary and Gerti. What are they doing here? -GARY: Excuse me there, sport. -Where did you get that? Latest in electro-riser technology, with new composite materials and AI Brainology. I can see you don't know what I'm talking about. -Gary, this is my rescue. -We'll take it from here. "Latest gear," my butt. No, no, no! You'll just make it worse! Now you done it. -Over here! -Get away from me! -Alexandra, take my hand! -Back off! I want my father to come up here and get me. But he's the President of the United States. No, he's my father. He was my father before he ever became President, and he should still be my father now. I want him up here! Sir, we have a situation. She's got the Transmooker. This is now a code-red situation. Get her down now! The point is, you and your father need to have a talk. Up here may not be the best place. Come with me, and I promise you, the two of you will have that talk. How can you promise that? I'm Level Two. I can order him to talk to you. Hi, Gerti. -What you doing? -I'm trying to stop the ride. -Without disengaging the axis? -Exactly. Then stop what you're doing. You see, the ride is designed to work like a giant magnet. If you reverse the polarization, bye-bye, President's daughter. See you around. -Okay. -Wait! I took this from my father's office this morning. -I'm sure he'll want it back. -Careful! Look, Cortez, you take her down, and I'll take this down. That way, we both look good. I'm not doing this for looks, Gary. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Thank goodness you're all right, Alexandra. We were worried sick. Boys? I think this is what you're looking for. She swiped it from the President. You're in big trouble this time, missy. Wait a minute. I promised her she could talk to her father. She'll talk to him, all right. We'll make sure of that. (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) -Promise me one thing. -What? No more rinky-dink assignments. So, you want the Ukata assignment, huh? Your duties are assigned to you by the agency, same as everyone, same as me. I know. It's just that we've learned so much. Juni and I are more than capable of taking bigger assignments. But that's not your decision to make. The Spy Kids Organization is still new, and if you're a Level Three or even a Level Two, you cannot go on a mission alone. You need more experience. -Come on. -Okay, Mom. If you're looking for top-secret information, just go straight to the source. WOMAN: Welcome to the Pentagon. How did you do that? You can't do that. There is no hacking in this household. I know. Sorry. Show me that again. I know this hair thing is one of my weakest points. Wait one minute. You're gonna look cool. In fact, you're looking cool already. Like me. Like Poppy. And it's kind of emotional to me. You know? A knot. We are gonna. You. Aha! Aha! We got it. That's my boy. Last touch. (GREGORIO CLEARS THROAT) -You want me to tie it for you? -No, it's okay. R.A.L.P.H. can do it. Bow tie, R.A.L.P.H. And not too tight. Thanks, R.A.L.P.H. Interesting. But he can never, ever replace me. Pow! Not yet, but I think that new upgrade comes in next week. GREGORIO: Uh-huh. Only joking. Hey! Kids. Kids. Kids. Kids. Joking? -Thank you. -Yes, ma'am. Okay. Remember, kids, this is a very important night for your father. And if he's named director of the OSS, be sure to stand up and give him a big hug, all right? What if Dad doesn't win? INGRID: Then give him a bigger hug. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) Yao Ling, Wa Ling, this is Danielle and Dione Daluc. -Hello. -Hi. They created Infolink, sort of an online trading system for swapping international secrets. -Hey. -Hello. -Champagne? -Can't have any of that. Sorry. Something doesn't feel right. No wonder, your buddy's here, your buddy with the weird laugh. He does not have a weird laugh. -We were just talking about you. -Really? (HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH) Wow. You look great, Carmen. -You want to dance? -Sure. I don't think that's a good idea, Gary. Family rules say you need to ask my father's permission. You know, you should've had that suit tailored, Juni. It's bunching up around your gut, and it makes your head look way too big. CARMEN: You have to excuse my little brother. He's still a little upset about the Juggler incident. A good agent controls his temper. Just be glad my dad isn't here. He gets really psycho about this sort of thing. Hi, Dad. You remember Gary. He's in our organization. I was just asking your daughter for a dance. -You know how to dance? -Fairly well, sir. -What kind of dances? -All types of dances. -What about tango? -Yes. -Mambo? -Fairly well. -Rumba? -Yes. -Cha-cha-cha? -Seven steps. -Bossa nova? -Mmm-hmm. -Merengue? -Of course. What about waltz? -Yeah, I can waltz. -Show me. Right. (BOTH LAUGHING) Something like that. All right. You can go to dance. Watch your older sister. -JUNI: Alexandra? -Yes? -What are you doing in there? -Dancing. Do you always carry this many Secret Service around? My dad's idea. He's gotten a little paranoid. Well, would you dance with me? No. All right, hold on a second, guys. Level Two, break it up! Why not? I only dance ballet. What an incredible coincidence. So do I. Well, Juni, I must say, you're a man of many talents. One tries. Uh, could you find your seats? We're ready to start. I must go. MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. Thank you. I am proud of the OSS and their newly formed Spy Kids Division for their outstanding accomplishments yesterday. Gary and Gerti Giggles not only saved my daughter. What is he talking about? I saved her! -Juni. -But more importantly, if not most importantly, they safely retrieved the Transmooker device that my daughter accidentally took from my office earlier that day. Now it is my great pleasure to announce the new director of the OSS. Gregor. Donnagon Giggles. Gary and Gerti Giggles are the kind of agents we need to turn the OSS around. I am proud to award them these Level One badges. -What? -Which will enable them to take on real missions, something challenging, like the Ukata assignment. Yes! I wanted that assignment. This is so unfair. I am proud to claim them as our organization's top Spy Kid operatives! Something's not right. And I'm also proud to claim them, of course, as my children. This is all wrong. To our Spy Kids. ALL: To our Spy Kids. To our Spy Kids. (GULPS) This. (ALL GROAN) Sleepers. They're after the Transmooker device! (KNUCKLES CRACKING) Take 'em down. (KIDS SCREAMING) -Pull! -Pull! (YELLS) Back off, squirt. Give me that back! (RUMBLING) (GROANING) -You all right, sir? -Yeah. CARMEN: Juni, get off of him! No, no. They took the Transmooker device! They took the Transmooker device! (PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) WOMAN ON PA: Would the following Spy Kid cadets please report to the psychic abilities seminar, Mike Cardenas and Daniel Duluth. GIRL: It's my turn. WOMAN: Are you sure? All right, your last name is? I had the Transmooker in my hand, but you know Juni, he wanted to claim it for himself. -Okay, that should do it. Thank you, Son. -Right. If that Transmooker device falls into the wrong hands, we're doomed. Thank you, Mr. President. That'll be all. -We're doomed! -Understood, sir. Here. MAN: Floop's Fooglie! Starring Minion. And Carmenita. (SIGHS) Thanks. I was fired. I know. I hacked into the OSS data files and saw the news. It was partly my fault, I suppose. -I'm sorry. -Well, I guess that's that. Let's go to the tree house. I got an idea. I guess I could always set up a small detective agency out here or something. You're thinking small again, Juni. JUNI: The old tree house, needs another helicopter pad. CARMEN: It needs a paint job, is what it needs. AUTOMATED VOICE: Your name? Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Echo Sky Brava Cortez. Your name? Juni Rocket Racer Rebelde Cortez. You know, I'm kind of looking forward to retirement, get back to all the projects and dreams I left behind. Oh, stop it, Juni. (BEEPING) Look, do you want your job back or not? That's right, reinstated Level Two. So now we can get back the missing Transmooker. How? Looks like Gary and Gerti are about to get briefed on the Ukata assignment. We should listen in. -Is R.A.L.P.H. still at your office? -If they haven't cleaned it out yet. (BEEPING) R.A.L.P.H., get to the briefing room. We need you to spy on Gary and Gerti. Make sure no one sees you. DONNAGON: There is a Bermuda Triangle of sorts off the coast of Madagascar. As you may remember, this is an area where some of our OSS cargo ships have been disappearing. Good boy, R.A.L.P.H. The survivors of these disappearances tell delusional tales of a mysterious island populated by strange creatures. Obviously, no land mass is located anywhere near there, so these tales were dismissed, and the agents fired. However, the magnet ship that captured the Transmooker device was last seen in this same area. So, we need a small ship, piloted by two small agents to go in and take a closer look. If you find anything out of the ordinary, you return, you report it back here. -We accept. -We accept. You bet we accept. Come home, R.A.L.P.H. Good work. It's a great assignment, but Gary and Gerti have it, and I'm fired. And I'm reassigning you to the OSS. -Don't tell me you're hacking. -Already done. Level Two status, reinstated. -Carmen, you can't do this. -I already did it. I'd take it one step further. We're assigning ourselves to the Ukata assignment. I'm programming a new destination for Gary and Gerti. Now, that I got to be a part of. AUTOMATED VOICE: State your name, please. (IN GARY'S VOICE) Gary Giggles. Access denied. It knows you're not him. (IMITATES GARY'S HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH) Confirmed. New destination. How about Gobi Desert? Stop it, Juni. What? Don't want your boyfriend to go so far away? -He's not my boyfriend. -Okay, then. Destination confirmed. There. What did we just do again? We're gonna get the Transmooker device back so we can clear your name. We just have to solve the case before anybody finds out what we're up to. -Are you with me? -Okay. Then let's go. (BOTH GASP) Hello? Hello? Hey, what are you doing up there? Sorry, we thought you were somebody else. Who gave you a key? Did you forget who built you this place? Come down from there. I brought you all-new gadgets. Check it out, the very latest spy watch, total communication center, right there on your wrist. Cell phone, Internet access, satellite TV, you name it. That baby will do everything but tell you what time it is. It doesn't tell time? No, there was so much stuffed into it, there was no more room for the clock. -Cool. -Are you sure these are new? We can't be running around with outdated equipment. Close your eyes and hold out your wrist. I'm gonna give you the one gadget you should always carry. A rubber band? No, it's a Machete elastic wonder. It's a rubber band. Yeah, but it's also the world's greatest gadget, 999 uses. And the important thing is you have to figure out what those uses are with this. He's right. Use number one, a stylish bracelet. Use number two. (EXCLAIMS) I'm gonna make a fortune with these. -Are you sure this is going to work? -Just be cool. As far as anybody knows, you're back on the force. Hey, Uncle Felix. (CHUCKLES) I'm not your uncle. I know. It's just easier to call you that. -You don't mind, do you? -Of course not. (CHUCKLES) Welcome back, Juni. Says here you were reinstated. Sure does, doesn't it? He was fired and rehired all in the same day. Okay. Let me bring up the keys to the Dragon Spy Five. Cake. 6 o'clock. Wow. You're looking good with the new gear, Carmen. -The latest stuff. -GERTI: Very cool. Only we had that weeks ago. Here's what's really new. Nanotechnology, everything you're wearing is right here on my wrist. It's super accurate and oh, so light. It even tells time. -How did you get that? -GARY: It's all prototype, Juni. You can't be running around with those mass-produced gadgets. Just means everyone's got them. I always go with the prototype. Sure, they're a little buggy, but I can deal. I accidentally squashed him on my way out of the OSS building. Sorry about that. He was outdated, anyway, so think of it as a mercy killing. Gary and Gerti Giggles, you have assignment SEIKJU9. Good luck. Don't hurt yourselves with that outdated gear. Remember, an agent is only as good as his gadgets. What? You have the Ukata assignment? Very nice. Good luck. Thanks, Uncle Felix. I'm not your uncle. Oh, nice sub. AUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome to the Dragon Spy DLX. Seems like they get more and more sophisticated each month. Everything is automated! Now picking your nose. Ugh. Little brothers. Let's check our lunchboxes for mission updates. Sorry, R.A.L.P.H. You were the best spy on the force. Juni, leave it alone. He's dead. -Thanks to your buddy Gary. -It was an accident. You like him and believe him? I don't like him, that much. -Gary's a bad guy, Carmen. -Maybe I know that. I think I can change him. I do not understand you. And you never will. French fry, sir? Ow! Give me that! Strange, tales of a mysterious island, disappearing ships, mysterious creatures, and yet, no information anywhere on the OSS cargo or the magnet ship. What's Donnagon doing there? He wasn't OSS Director yet. These are old OSS secrets, and I know just the person we can call for advice. Who? (SINGING) Who? What? When? Where? -Who? -What? -When? -Where? And why? I delight in -What. -Do I intend to find This time? -Run around! -Jumping down! Bounce and bound and. Find another way to duck and hide This isle of Dreams (CELL PHONE RINGS) Hello? Yes. One moment, please. Cut! (SIGHS) Who is it again? (GASPS) Juni Cortez! What can I do for you? I mean, you've done so much for me. Your robot counterparts are the surprise hit characters of my show! Say hello. -Hello -Hello Actually, Carmen wants a word with Mr. Minion. Oh. He's right here. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) Minion is practicing a four-part harmony. You have one minute. (GREETS IN SPANISH) How you doing, Minion? Things are a little Floopy around here for my taste, but it's a living. I need some information on your favorite subject, the OSS. I need to make a call. Okay, you ready? Ukata. Transmooker. WOMAN: The President's daughter is unavailable. CARMEN: Manage. Press one to record. Mean anything to you? Smells like the work of Donnagon Giggles. He had first contact with the Transmooker technology. You think Donnagon's the one behind all this? You're talking to a man with four heads. Trust me, the guy is dirt. What should we look for? First, find the island. Then find the Island Man. That would have been Donnagon's contact. Okay. Thanks, Minion. Be a good girl and swat your brother for me. Oh, I will. (BEEPING) Something's wrong! Take the wheel! Got to go. Good luck! Slow down! We're nearing destination zone. The radius where all the disappearances occurred is right here! We've been shut down! Hold onto something! (GROANING) All power is off, even the emergency power. My flashlight doesn't even work. We're stuck, aren't we? Let's get out of here. Rebreathers. Rebreathers. You got to do it by hand. What next? Nope. Hand, Carmen. Unbelievable. Low-tech! Here we go. Should we travel light or heavy? We may not be coming back down here. Let's go heavy. Inflate-a-suits? We don't have much choice. At least the masks work. I think it's because they're valve-operated, not electrical-based. -It's so strange. -Good luck. You, too! Stay close! Oh, great. I'm fat! Was it supposed to do this? It has an electrical automatic shutoff which didn't work. Luckily, we ran out of air before the suits exploded. JUNI: Well, we can still laugh. CARMEN: At what? At whatever you can imagine Gary and Gerti are doing right about now. (BOTH GRUNTING) Gerti, where are we? Well, according to my coordinates, we are. I think that. (BOTH GROANING) Camel poop! Someone's gonna pay! Cortezes. (DOOR BUZZES) I like your new office. It's smaller, cozy. Especially smaller. Oh! So many successful missions. Amazing, isn't it? -Remember this one? -Oh. -Which mission is that? -Mexico. Of course. Actually, that was the one mission we never accomplished. Ingrid, don't start with your parents again. It's funny you should mention them. No. When I mention your parents, it is the exact opposite of funny. Doesn't it bother you that we never got their full blessing? Frankly, you deserve another chance -to show them. -All right, all right. Invite them if you want, but I won't be here. Tell them that I had to go on another mission, that we're having a little problem on the moon. My father loves the moon. You invited them already, didn't you? Define "invite." -DONNAGON: Cortezes. -What? -I have some bad news. May I come in? -(BOTH STAMMERING) -Certainly, sir. -Yes, sir. Great. Here he is. (SIGHS) Two of our Spy Kid operatives are lost on the Ukata assignment. Your children had that assignment. I'm so sorry, Donnagon. How can we help? Actually, my children are safe somewhere in the Gobi Desert, I believe. I'm sorry to say that Carmen and Juni are somehow the ones on the Ukata assignment, a computing error of some kind. -Communications? -None. Their Dragon Spy ship doesn't show up on radar or satellite. Greg, Ingrid, you guys risked your lives once before to save me. Let me go now and personally bring your children back. No. Thank you. Thank you, Donnagon, but, respectfully, we have to do this ourselves. If you could provide tactical backup and surveillance support of our efforts, -we'll leave immediately. -Okay, yeah. Ingrid. I know this may be a bad time, but your parents are here. But you guys told me you were coming next Tuesday. This is a very dangerous assignment, and you have to wait here. We want to help. INGRID: Don't worry. You taught me everything I know. Yes. But not everything we know. Of course not, Dad. See you in a few hours. Thanks, honey. I still don't like him. Juni? Was that there before? That wasn't there a minute ago, was it? Are you kicking me? I'm way over here! I felt something against my foot. There's something under me! Come look! I don't see anything, Juni. Let's just concentrate on getting to shore. Okay, it's about 200 yards. If we kick steadily at one foot per kick, we'll reach it in. JUNI: Twenty-five minutes? I don't know. My calculator doesn't work. (BOTH SCREAMING) Juni, what did you do? JUNI: The air's coming out of our suits! CARMEN: We're heading towards shore! "Travel heavy!" Good idea! All right. Give it a rest. Okay, we're gonna set up a campsite, put up the tent, build a little fire. JUNI: And roast marshmallows? I can't believe this! -What happened? -Nothing, that's just it. That was supposed to make an instant campfire, and that was supposed to make a shelter. None of our gadgets work. You mean we have to use our heads? Yes. Ouch. DONNAGON: Big office. Director of the OSS' office. Big. (SIGHS) Did you find the source of equal or greater power? It emanates from the north side of the island. Have you located the Island Man? He's somewhere underground. Yeah, well, start digging. I'm on my way. Come on, Juni. Let's go check out the island. I just set up camp. See? Sure wish Gary was here. He'd want to find out who was behind all this. Oh, man! All right, let's go. Wow! This place is amazing! Check out that rock! -Looks like a hot dog. -Uh-huh. Well, I've seen enough. Let's go back to the beach. -What? -(WHISPERING) Listen. I hear something humming. Somebody here has power. We need to find out who and for what. AUTOMATED VOICE: Destination, Ukata. Estimated time of arrival, one minute and counting. How fast are we going? -85 knots. -Go faster. With pleasure. Faster. Faster. -Can't go faster. -Faster. I broke the fast thingy. Faster! (ALARM SOUNDING) (THUD) (GERTI GROANING) All right. Now what? This is terrific. You know, this is just great. You really did it this time, Gerti. Are you kicking me? No. I'm way over here, cheese ball. (GROWLING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (BOTH GROANING) I'm gonna zap that sucker to bits! Come here! Wait! Save it for the Cortezes. Excellent idea. I don't get it! I saw it go through this wall. (SIGHS) What's your assessment, Juni? I'd think better with food in my belly. I think we should go up there and check it out. -Up there, to the top of the volcano? -Yep. Not even if my micro grapplers were working. -Gary would be brave enough to do it. -Nope. Nothing you can say can change my mind. (TRUMPETING) -What did you just say? -I didn't. Race you to the top! (BOTH GRUNTING) Volcano. Juni, stay back. It's not active. (SQUEALING) (JUNI SCREAMS) Juni! What are you waiting for? Get me out of here! If my auto retractor was working, I'd get us both back up there! Okay. I'm gonna grab your hand. Okay. Okay. (EXCLAIMS) My cell phone! Why'd you stop? Something wrong? Close your eyes. Why? (BOTH SCREAM) Juni! -What? -I'm sorry! How long have we been falling? I don't know. My watch doesn't tell time. Best guess? I'd say about three hours. Feels like four. How could you be eating at a time like this? You know that tickling sensation you get when you fall? Of course. That pretty much went away after the first hour. -Ground! -(YELLS) What happened? I don't know! We're floating! Who are you? -Do you see something? -Over there, hiding. -What do you want? -I want to get down. I'm Carmen Cortez, Special Agent of the OSS. I'm Romero, sole inhabitant of this island of Leeke Leeke. Sole human inhabitant, that is. -And you are? -Tired and hungry. Nice to meet you, tired and hungry. -Careful! You'll crush my island! -Sorry. We just fell four hours. We're a little clumsy right now. You weren't falling. It was an illusion. Magic? Science. (ANIMALS CRYING) Quickly, we must get somewhere safe! I'm a genetic specialist. I needed a controlled environment for my experiments. The creatures we've been hearing? My experiments, run amok. What happened? I thought I would make a fortune from it. Kids everywhere would have their own miniature zoos, right there in their bedrooms. A miniature zoo? God's creatures on a manageable scale. (ANIMALS SQUAWKING) Unbelievable. I called it "Romero's Zoo," genetically miniaturized animals. Lions, tigers, bears, penguins. Monkeys. (CHITTERING) Monkeys in a barrel. Careful. Careful. One day, I accidentally mixed up two or three different test tubes and created a new species altogether. Romero's Zoo Too. An entirely new miniature zoo where each species is unlike any creature you've ever seen. -Horse-fly? -Uh-huh. -Cat-fish. -(MEWS) Spider-monkey? -Bull-frog. -(SNORTING) -Slizzards. -Whoa! Stay away from those. And so, I started to think, if only I could make them all a wee bit bigger, you know, for kids with meatier hands. That's where things went very wrong. I applied a growth serum, and they took to it all too well. (EXCLAIMING) No! And I've been locked up in here ever since. I'm afraid to go out there again. They've tried to gobble me up on more than one occasion. Why do they despise me so? I created them. Do you think God stays in heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he's created here on Earth? Stop looking at me like that. I'm no loon. What I'm still trying to figure out is why this island doesn't show up on even our most advanced satellites. I created a cloaking device to shield my island from curious eyes. Anything electronically powered that comes within a mile radius instantly shuts down. Any radar that passes over me is displaced, creating the illusion that my island doesn't exist. The Transmooker device. How did you know? Your cloaking device is highly coveted. People everywhere are trying to get their hands on it. (GERTI SCREAMING IN DISTANCE) Are you sure we're the only humans here? There they are. Two children, judging by their size. What is this? It's a miniature of the island. The center point of the volcano provides a gravitational basis for which my miniature creatures can line up exactly to their larger clone counterparts. So, wherever your miniature creatures are on this model, it's where the bigger ones are outside? Correct. I can keep track of their whereabouts this way. See? The two intruder children are being chased by a slizzard. -Gary and Gerti. -Leave 'em. We have to go help them! They shouldn't be snooping around my island to begin with! -I'm with you, dude. -We have to help them. I'm not going out there! I'll be eaten! What a bizarre man. GERTI: Help us! Somebody! GARY: Help! JUNI: What are you guys doing down there? That's real funny, clown. Get us out! We tried to activate our micro grapplers, but they didn't deploy! Nothing works here. Yeah, we know that now. Thanks for the update, carrot top. -Juni, come back. They need our help. -I'll help them. I want to get him back over here so I can push him back over myself. -Hurry up. -Come on. Here, Gary. Give me your hand. Thank you, Carmen. Here, Gerti, give me your hand. Just wait till my father gets here. Your father's coming? -Where are you taking me now, Carmen? -CARMEN: Hold on. Why are you still hiding? We're kids, not monsters. What's the difference? Relax. They're OSS Agents, as well. -Level One. -They're Donnagon's kids. Agent Donnagon? You work for the OSS, don't you? -I work for a man named Donnagon. -Who is this guy? Donnagon's not interested in your creatures. Why not? The Transmooker device that hides your island, that's what Donnagon really wants. That's not nearly as interesting. Now that Donnagon's head of the OSS, he has the power to take it from you. What are you babbling about now, Juni? The Transmooker you took from the President's daughter, Gary. It was just a prototype. The real Transmooker device is here on this island. It's even more powerful and can shut down all technology on the planet. You said your father's on his way. I think he's coming to pick it up. You're all liars. Do you really think you're gonna turn us on our own father? Did your dad tell you the mission you went on was just a setup for Carmen and me? -Why not? -He has his reasons. That's what being a good spy is all about, trust no one. How to Be a Spy, we've read it. Read it again. A good spy makes no binding connections with family or friends. I don't believe in that, do you? GARY: If you want to be a good spy, you better believe it. My father's a great spy, so let's grow up, shall we? Whatever my father's done, it's what it takes to play in the big world. Like it or not. Come on, Gerti. Let's go. -He's right. -Why can't you side with me just once? There are no sides. You're right, and he's right, too. That's what being a spy means. -Well, I don't like it. -Then quit. -I will. -Yeah, right. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) INGRID: Donnagon was right. Their Dragon Spy doesn't show up anywhere on radar. I am not interested in finding the sub. Remember that year I insisted on doing the children's dental work myself? How could I forget? I installed a nonelectrical tracking device in their teeth, my own invention. But I haven't been able to test it, until now. -INGRID: Honey, it works! -Whoa! Hard to believe. But according to this, they're in the middle of the ocean. Above sea level. But where they are on the map, there's no land mass. How can that be?
